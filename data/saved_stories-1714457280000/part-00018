A new world order, Gates\npredicted, would soon be brought on by what he called \"AI agents\" \u2014 digital\npersonal assistants that could anticipate our every want and need. These\nagents would be far more powerful than Siri and Alexa, with godlike knowledge\nand supernatural intuition.\n\n\"Agents are not only going to change how everyone interacts with computers,\"\nGates wrote. \"They're also going to upend the software industry, bringing\nabout the biggest revolution in computing since we went from typing commands\nto tapping on icons.\"\n\nAt the time, the memo struck those who read it as far-fetched. \"It seemed\nsuper futuristic,\" a Microsoft executive who spoke on the condition of\nanonymity said. Microsoft had been widely mocked for its previous attempts at\ncreating personal \"agents,\" from its failed Office assistant Clippy to its\nracist chatbot, Tay. Few at the time would have believed a new generation of\nthese agents would transform Microsoft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, though, it's clear that Gates' secret correspondence anticipated\nCopilot, the artificial-intelligence tool that has helped propel Microsoft to\nbecome the world's most valuable public company. Powered by a version of\nOpenAI's GPT large language model, Copilot debuted last year as a tool within\nMicrosoft products to help users with tasks such as preparing presentations\nand summarizing meetings. \"Copilot now sounds exactly like what he wrote,\" the\nexecutive said.\n\nThat's not by accident.\n\nPublicly, Gates has been almost entirely out of the picture at Microsoft since\n2021, following allegations that he had behaved inappropriately toward female\nemployees. In fact, Business Insider has learned, Gates has been quietly\norchestrating much of Microsoft's AI revolution from behind the scenes.\nCurrent and former executives say Gates remains intimately involved in the\ncompany's operations \u2014 advising on strategy, reviewing products, recruiting\nhigh-level executives, and nurturing Microsoft's crucial relationship with Sam\nAltman, the cofounder and CEO of OpenAI. In early 2023, when Microsoft debuted\na version of its search engine Bing turbocharged by the same technology as\nChatGPT, throwing down the gauntlet against competitors like Google, Gates,\nexecutives said, was pivotal in setting the plan in motion. While Nadella\nmight be the public face of the company's AI success \u2014 the Oz who built the\nyellow-brick road to a $3 trillion juggernaut \u2014 Gates has been the man behind\nthe curtain.\n\n\"What you read is not what's happening in reality,\" another Microsoft\nexecutive said. \"Satya and the entire senior leadership team lean on Gates\nvery significantly. His opinion is sought every time we make a major change.\"\n\nWhen Nadella took over the reins from Steve Ballmer a decade ago, Microsoft\nwas seen as a dinosaur of the computer age it had helped pioneer. Peter Thiel\nbashed the company as \"a bet against technological innovation.\" So Nadella,\nwho had worked at Microsoft since 1992, turned to his former boss for help. On\nthe day Nadella became CEO, he asked Gates to spend 30% of his time as a\ntechnical advisor, in part to help motivate his staff. \"When I say, 'Hey, I\nwant you to go run this by Bill,' I know they're going to do their best job\nprepping for it,\" he told Wired at the time.\n\nIn 2020, when Gates stepped down as chair of Microsoft's board, Nadella\nshowered him with praise. The company, Nadella promised, would \"continue to\nbenefit from Bill's ongoing technical passion and advice to drive our products\nand services forward.\"\n\nBut a year later, Nadella's embrace of Gates appeared to change \u2014 at least\npublicly. In 2021, as Gates and his wife, Melinda, were divorcing, The Wall\nStreet Journal reported that Gates had been forced to step down as the company\ninvestigated him for having an affair with an employee. As news of Gates'\nmisconduct went viral, the squeaky-clean reputation he and his public-\nrelations team had meticulously crafted over the years unraveled. Several\nfemale employees came forward with stories of Gates asking them out, and his\nmeetings with Jeffrey Epstein, including a flight on Epstein's private jet,\ncame under renewed scrutiny. Suddenly, Nadella's mentor had become his\ngreatest liability, and he and Microsoft quickly distanced themselves from\nGates.\n\n\"The Microsoft of 2021 is very different from the Microsoft of 2000,\" Nadella\nsaid at the time. \"The power dynamic in the workplace is not something that\ncan be abused in any form.\" The company's greatest responsibility, he later\nadded, is \"cultivating a culture where everyone is empowered to do meaningful\nwork.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut among the people whom Nadella secretly empowered to do meaningful work, BI\nhas learned, was Gates himself. Rather than banishing him from the company,\nNadella continued to draw on his advice and expertise \u2014 making Gates a key\nplayer in Microsoft's efforts to vie for dominance in AI.\n\nThe common lore about Microsoft's marriage with OpenAI is that it was brokered\nby Kevin Scott, the company's chief technology officer. Scott had known Altman\nfor years, and in summer 2018, he arranged a meeting between Altman and\nNadella. Later that year, the three men hammered out an initial deal, and the\nrest is history.\n\n> \"According to two executives, Gates' memo treated as gospel, sparking\n> Microsoft's push to take the lead in the AI arms race.\"\n\nBut lost in that origin story is that Gates had been regularly meeting with\nOpenAI since 2016. Ever since he published \"The Road Ahead\" in 1995, Gates had\nbeen dreaming of a world in which everyone would navigate the internet using\nsoftware that would \"have a personality you'll be able to talk to in one form\nor another\" and that would \"learn about your requirements and preferences in\nmuch the way that a human assistant does.\" Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft\nhad launched several primitive and widely ridiculed versions of agents \u2014 from\nRover, a cartoon dog that guided you through Windows 95, to Clippy, the most\nhated paperclip of all time. Now, it seemed, OpenAI might offer Microsoft a\nway to help forge the AI future that Gates had long envisioned. After the two\ncompanies formed their partnership, OpenAI's leaders conducted regular\npresentations for Gates at his 66,000-square-foot mansion in Washington,\nkeeping him apprised of critical benchmarks and significant obstacles.\n\nIt was Gates, in fact, who played a pivotal role in turning OpenAI and\nMicrosoft into a power couple. In mid-2022 \u2014 two years after he was ousted\nfrom the board \u2014 he privately challenged Altman and OpenAI to create a model\ncapable of passing an Advanced Placement biology exam. Gates didn't think it\ncould be done. Altman and OpenAI debuted GPT-4 for the first time outside the\ncompany at Gates' house in August 2022 during a dinner; Nadella was among the\nguests. When it aced the test, Gates was shocked, calling it \"the most\nstunning demo I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nThe demo prompted Gates to write another memo \u2014 what one former executive\nreferred to as \"the memo\" \u2014 spelling out how Microsoft should use GPT-4. Gates\nstressed that the large language model, trained on the entirety of the public\ninternet, could finally usher in the era of personal agents. \"Think of it as a\ndigital personal assistant,\" he wrote in a version of that memo later posted\non his blog. \"It will see your latest emails, know about the meetings you\nattend, read what you read, and read the things you don't want to bother\nwith.\"\n\nWhile Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella might be the public face of the company's AI\nsuccess, Bill Gates has been the man behind the curtain. Microsoft\n\nAccording to two executives, Gates' words were treated as gospel, helping\nspark Microsoft's push to take the lead in the AI arms race. Soon after Gates'\ndinner, Nadella hosted a meeting on Microsoft's campus, where he challenged\nthe teams to incorporate AI into search, cybersecurity, and its Microsoft 365\nsuite of business applications, which includes Word and Outlook.\n\nEarly the following year, Microsoft introduced a new version of its\nbeleaguered search engine, Bing \u2014 now turbocharged with a GPT-enabled agent\nthat would later be named Copilot. Almost overnight, thanks to Gates'\nmaneuvering, Microsoft had transformed Bing from a search engine on life\nsupport to an AI-powered tool that had a chance to give Google a run for its\nmoney.\n\nIn February 2023, Microsoft held an event at its headquarters similar to a\nSteve Jobs iPhone launch. Nadella, beaming, declared war on Google. Gates did\nnot appear to be in attendance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Gates remains close with Altman, who visits his home a few times a\nyear, and OpenAI seeks his counsel on developments. There's a \"tight coupling\"\nbetween Gates and OpenAI, a person familiar with the relationship said. \"Sam\nand Bill are good friends. OpenAI takes his opinion and consult overall\nseriously.\" OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood confirmed OpenAI continues to meet\nwith Gates.\n\nLast fall, Nadella and Microsoft scrambled to quell the chaos when OpenAI's\nboard abruptly fired Altman. Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesperson, told BI\nthat if Gates was speaking with Altman, it was not on behalf of the company.\n\"Bill is not at Microsoft and not involved here,\" Shaw told BI at the time.\n\nDuring the five-day fracas that followed, Gates \u2014 with his own recent\nexperience with an ouster \u2014 reached out to Altman to offer support as he\nnegotiated a return to the leadership of OpenAI.\n\nToday, insiders say Gates' sway at Microsoft extends far beyond OpenAI.\n\nExecutives from across the company \u2014 including its business-applications boss,\nCharles Lamanna; its chief scientist, Jaime Teevan; its Teams chat-app boss,\nJeff Teper; and its head of cybersecurity, Charlie Bell \u2014 meet regularly with\nGates to review products. He's also personally involved in recruiting and\nretaining important executives for Microsoft. \"Gates is very involved with\nproduct reviews and one-on-ones with executives,\" a former executive said.\nLast year, Gates told Forbes he spent about 10% of his time in Redmond,\nWashington, advising Microsoft on product road maps.\n\nGates over years has also pushed Microsoft to be more consumer-focused,\ndespite many consumer technology failures. In March, many observers were\nshocked when the company announced it was hiring Mustafa Suleyman, who\ncofounded DeepMind and spent many years at Google, to lead a new consumer-AI\norganization. \"Bill G. thinks the major opportunity is consumers,\" one insider\nsaid. \"If you look at the new consumer-AI organization, that looks like Bill's\ninfluence on Satya.\" Shaw said Gates was not involved in hiring Suleyman.\n\nAll this is a far cry from the perception that Gates has been kept at a\ndistance ever since he was ousted from the board. Gates, who has continued to\nkeep a low profile, has emerged from the scandal largely unscathed; today, the\nallegations of his misconduct aren't even mentioned in his Wikipedia entry.\nThe Microsoft of 2024, it appears, is not as different from the Microsoft of\n2021 as Nadella would have everyone believe. Gates is not gone, but his\ncheckered past has been largely forgotten.\n\nShaw said there hadn't been any substantial changes in Gates' role as a\ntechnical advisor since he left the board in 2020. Gates declined an interview\nrequest and his representative did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNear the end of \"The Road Ahead,\" Gates got existential. \"It's a little scary\nthat as computer technology has moved ahead, there's never been a leader from\none era who was also a leader in the next,\" he lamented at the ripe age of 39.\n\"So from a historical perspective, I guess Microsoft is disqualified from\nleading in the highway era of the Information Age.\"\n\nThen the middle-aged Gates revealed his true ambition: \"I want to defy\nhistorical tradition.\"\n\nNow approaching 70, Gates is still defying history \u2014 this time from behind the\nscenes. And if the revived fortunes of Microsoft are any indication, he\nappears to be winning.\n\nAshley Stewart is a chief technology correspondent at Business Insider.
