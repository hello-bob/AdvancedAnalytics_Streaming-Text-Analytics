The hybridization resulted in a\npolyploid genome, meaning each offspring contains two sets of chromosomes from\neach parent. This may have given C. arabica a survival advantage that enabled\nit to thrive and adapt.\n\n\"It's often argued that a hybrid polyploidy event can give an immediate\nevolutionary advantage given that two sets of chromosomes \u2014 and therefore two\ncomplete sets of genes \u2014 are inherited immediately after,\" study co-author\nVictor Albert, a biologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo,\ntold Live Science. \"Of course, it's always the case that duplicate genes are\nlost on the two genome halves of the polyploid, but there is always a net gain\nin gene numbers and therefore, possibly, a greater capacity to adapt to new\nenvironments.\"\n\nRelated: 'Living fossil' tree frozen in time for 66 million years being\nplanted in secret locations\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that there is a margin of error. Earlier estimates\nof the time of hybridization date it as recently as 10,000 years ago.\n\n\"We had to input an estimated mutation rate, and a generation time (seed to\nseed time). Together, these assumptions allow us to convert to calendar years.\nBut these estimates are of course fraught with error ranges given the usual\nuncertainty on mutation rates and generation times,\" Albert said. Still, he\nthinks their estimate is reasonably accurate. The researchers used genetic\ninformation from 41 samples of C. arabica from various locations, including an\n18th-century specimen.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nArabica coffee now provides about 60% the world's coffee supply.

It was originally believed to\nhave been grown by humans in Ethiopia and then traded to the Middle East,\nwhere it was a well-known beverage by the 15th century. According to one\nlegend, an Indian Sufi Muslim pilgrim smuggled seven seeds out of Yemen and\nestablished coffee farms in Karnataka, India around 1670.\n\nDutch traders began cultivating the plant in other regions \u2014 they first\nplanted C. arabica on the island of Java in 1699 and one was sent to a\nbotanical garden in Amsterdam in 1706. The Dutch and the French, with whom a\nplant was shared, also transported seedlings to their colonies in the 18th\ncentury. The offspring of the original plants are known as Typica while a\nmutation that occurred on the island of Reunion (then called Bourbon) resulted\nin another form called Bourbon. Most current C. arabica plants are derived\nfrom these two lineages, though a handful of wild ecotypes sourced from\nEthiopia are also grown.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014390 million-year-old fossilized forest is the oldest ever discovered\n\n\u2014California redwoods 'killed' by wildfire come back to life with 2,000-year-\nold buds\n\n\u2014World's deepest canyon is home to Asia's tallest tree - and Chinese\nscientists only just found\n\nWhile the polyploid nature of its genome may have provided C. arabica with\nsome advantages, it also left it vulnerable to disease, especially coffee leaf\nrust (Hemileia vastatrix). Genetic bottlenecks \u2014 drastic population reductions\n\u2014 due to climate variations reduced genetic diversity prior to human\ncultivation. The oldest bottleneck may have occurred 350,000 years ago and\nanother at 5,000 years ago. The fact that all the current plants relate back\nto a single parent is another bottleneck.\n\n\"It's not as able to confront rust in an 'arms race' where genetic variation\nin Arabica meets evolving rust populations and fights back and forth to adapt\nto the disease. Instead, the rust has a greater capacity to adapt to any new\nresistance that evolves,\" Albert said.\n\nIn 1927, C. arabica naturally crossed back to one of its parent species, C.\ncanephora, on the island of Timor. This event created a more rust-resistant\nvariety of coffee, but the quality of the beans has been deemed inferior to\nthose produced by C. arabica or Robusta \u2014 another name for C. canephora.\n\nRichard Pallardy\n\nLive Science Contributor\n\nRichard Pallardy is a freelance science writer based in Chicago.
