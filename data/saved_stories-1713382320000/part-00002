The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house).

Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes.

Here\u2019s what the major U.S. airlines require to travel with a\npet.\n\nUnlike this service dog named Orlando on a United Airlines flight, most pets\nflying in cabin must remain in their carriers and must be under a certain\nweight and size. Credit...Julio Cortez/Associated Press\n\nBy Jesus Jim\u00e9nez\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nFlying with a pet can be expensive and confusing, with fees, weight limits,\ncarrier size rules and the need to make sure there\u2019s no loud barking (or\nmeowing) on board.\n\nRecently, American Airlines relaxed its pet policy to allow passengers to\nbring a carry-on bag in addition to a pet in a carrier, and more private\nflight options have been emerging in recent years for pet owners who can\nafford them.\n\nStill, flying with large or medium-size dogs can be tricky, and many travelers\nare wary of leaving a pet in the plane\u2019s cargo hold.\n\nFor those traveling on the major carriers with their pets as carry-ons, here\u2019s\nwhat to know about each major domestic airline\u2019s policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Southwest Airlines\n\nOn Southwest, a Dallas-based carrier, two checked bags can fly at no cost, but\nnot pets. Southwest charges $125 per pet carrier on its flights.\n\nDogs or cats are allowed to travel below a seat in an approved carrier \u2014 up to\n18.5 inches long by 8.5 inches high and 13.5 inches wide \u2014 according to the\nairline.\n\nSouthwest has a few caveats for those traveling with pets: The pet must stay\nin its carrier during the flight, and the carrier is considered a personal\nitem or carry-on bag.\n\nUp to six pets are allowed on Southwest flights. Once six pets are booked onto\na flight, no further customers may add a pet companion to their booking.\n\nImage\n\nUnited charges $125 each way for travel with pets.
