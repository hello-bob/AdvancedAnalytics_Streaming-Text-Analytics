The material has been termed goldene. According to\nresearchers from Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden, this has given the gold new\nproperties that can make it suitable for use in applications such as carbon\ndioxide conversion, hydrogen production, and production of value-added\nchemicals.\n\nTogether with colleagues researchers Lars Hultman and Shun Kashiwaya have\ncreated goldene. Olov Planthaber\n\nScientists have long tried to make single-atom-thick sheets of gold but failed\nbecause the metal\u2019s tendency to lump together. But researchers from Link\u00f6ping\nUniversity have now succeeded thanks to a hundred-year-old method used by\nJapanese smiths.\n\n\u201cIf you make a material extremely thin, something extraordinary happens \u2013 as\nwith graphene. The same thing happens with gold. As you know, gold is usually\na metal, but if single-atom-layer thick, the gold can become a semiconductor\ninstead,\u201d says Shun Kashiwaya, researcher at the Materials Design Division at\nLink\u00f6ping University.\n\n## 3D base material\n\nTo create goldene, the researchers used a three-dimensional base material\nwhere gold is embedded between layers of titanium and carbon. But coming up\nwith goldene proved to be a challenge. According to Lars Hultman, professor of\nthin film physics at Link\u00f6ping University, part of the progress is due to\nserendipidy.\n\nLars Hultman, professor of thin film physics at the Department of physics,\nchemistry and biology (IFM).Olov Planthaber\n\n\u201cWe had created the base material with completely different applications in\nmind. We started with an electrically conductive ceramics called titanium\nsilicon carbide, where silicon is in thin layers. Then the idea was to coat\nthe material with gold to make a contact. But when we exposed the component to\nhigh temperature, the silicon layer was replaced by gold inside the base\nmaterial,\u201d says Lars Hultman.\n\nThis phenomenon is called intercalation and what the researchers had\ndiscovered was titanium gold carbide. For several years, the researchers have\nhad titanium gold carbide without knowing how the gold can be exfoliated or\npanned out, so to speak.\n\n## Japanese forging art\n\nBy chance, Lars Hultman found a method that has been used in Japanese forging\nart for over a hundred years. It is called Murakami\u2019s reagent, which etches\naway carbon residue and changes the colour of steel in knife making, for\nexample. But it was not possible to use the exact same recipe as the smiths\ndid. Shun Kashiwaya had to look at modifications:\n\nShun Kashiwaya, researcher at IFM.Olov Planthaber\n\n\u201cI tried different concentrations of Murakami\u2019s reagent and different time\nspans for etching. One day, one week, one month, several months. What we\nnoticed was that the lower the concentration and the longer the etching\nprocess, the better. But it still wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d he says.\n\nThe etching must also be carried out in the dark as cyanide develops in the\nreaction when it is struck by light, and it dissolves gold. The last step was\nto get the gold sheets stable. To prevent the exposed two-dimensional sheets\nfrom curling up, a surfactant was added. In this case, a long molecule that\nseparates and stabilises the sheets, i.e. a tenside.\n\n\u201cThe goldene sheets are in a solution, a bit like cornflakes in milk. Using a\ntype of \u201csieve\u201d, we can collect the gold and examine it using an electron\nmicroscope to confirm that we have succeeded. Which we have,\u201d says Shun\nKashiwaya.\n\n## Many possible applications\n\nThe new properties of goldene are due to the fact that the gold has two free\nbonds when two-dimensional. Thanks to this, future applications could include\ncarbon dioxide conversion, hydrogen-generating catalysis, selective production\nof value-added chemicals, hydrogen production, water purification,\ncommunication, and much more.\n\nTo create goldene, the researchers used a three-dimensional base material\nwhere gold is embedded between layers of titanium and carbon.Olov Planthaber\n\nMoreover, the amount of gold used in applications today can be much reduced.\n\nThe next step for the LiU researchers is to investigate whether it is possible\nto do the same with other noble metals and identify additional future\napplications.\n\nThe research was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish\nGovernment Strategic Research Area in Materials Science (AFM) at Link\u00f6ping\nUniversity, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the \u00c5forsk Foundation,\nthe Olle Enqvist Foundation, the Carl Trygger Foundation, the G\u00f6ran Gustafsson\nFoundations, MIRAI 2.0, the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing\n(SNIC), and the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden\n(NAISS).\n\nArticle: Synthesis of goldene comprising single-atom layer gold, Shun\nKashiwaya, Yuchen Shi, Jun Lu, Davide G.

This is shown in new research from Link\u00f6ping University, where changes\nin income segregation in Sweden have been investigated for almost 30 years.\n\n### Antiviral drugs could preserve capacity to produce insulin in type 1\ndiabetes patients\n\nAntiviral drug treatment could preserve the remaining capacity to release\ninsulin in children recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, according to a\nnew study by Scandinavian researchers.\n\n### Hans\u2019s part-time retirement on hold following request from the Bonnier\nfamily\n\nNot everyone suddenly gets an email from Carl-Johan Bonnier with an invitation\nto a meeting at Bonnier\u2019s head office in Stockholm. But this happened to\nProfessor Hans Sj\u00f6gren.\n\n### Immune system ageing can be revealed by CT scan\n\nThymus may play a bigger role in the immune system of adults than was\npreviously believed. With age, the glandular tissue in the thymus is replaced\nby fat, but the rate at which this happens is linked to sex, age and lifestyle\nfactors.\n\n### Solar cell material can assist self-driving cars in the dark\n\nMaterial used in organic solar cells can be used as light sensors in\nelectronics. This is shown by researchers at LiU who have developed a type of\nsensor able to detect circularly polarised red light. Their study is published\nin Nature Photonics.\n\n### New network with a focus on women's health\n\nResearcher Lisa Guntram gets funding to launch a network dedicated to\nexploring and confronting the marginalisation of women's health. This will be\nthe world's first research network on women's health with a focus on social\nsciences and humanities.\n\n### SciLifeLab establishes a new research site at LiU\n\nTechnology, expertise, methods and initiatives can be coordinated more within\nand between higher education institutions. Link\u00f6ping University is now one of\nfour new sites in the Swedish research infrastructure SciLifeLab.\n\n### SEK 13 million for research into solving murders using AI\n\nWas it murder, poisoning or was the death maybe caused by disease? Researchers\nhave now been granted SEK 13 million from the Swedish Research Council to\ndevelop a methodology to solve crimes using detailed analyses and artificial\nintelligence.\n\n### Agnes and Emma awarded for their thesis\n\nCivil engineers Agnes Karl\u00e9n and Emma Torstensson received an award of SEK\n30,000, for their master's thesis on composite materials .\n\n### Pioneering safe chemotherapy methods for treating infections\n\nAntibiotic resistant bacteria are a threat to human lives, and yet the\ndevelopment of new drugs is slow. A group of proven cancer drugs could\npossibly be the solution. A new class of antibiotics is now being developed by\nresearchers at LiU.\n\n### Quantum communication tested on a large scale\n\nSo-called quantum encryption will ensure the security of sensitive information\n\u2013 but this new technology has to be tested outside the lab environment. LiU is\ntherefore taking part in a project studying secure communication channels of\nthe future.\n\n### Nixon - with the right to break in\n\nHe has worked all over the world, finding weaknesses in supposedly foolproof\ncomputer systems. He has found hackers that were then brought to justice. This\nyear\u2019s Alumnus of the Year, is ready to crack down on cyber attacks and\ncomputer intrusion.\n\n### \u201cMy motivation is to make a difference\u201d\n\nWith her great drive, knowledge and commitment, Amanda Borneke has come to be\nthe sustainability profile of the construction industry. This year\u2019s Alumna of\nthe Year always sees opportunities and likes an uphill challenge.\n\n## Tags\n\n  * Material Sciences\n  * Advanced Functional Materials\n  * Tunnfilmsfysik\n  * Materials Design\n  * Fundamental Science of Thin Films\n  * Shun Kashiwaya (shuka21)\n  * Lars Hultman (larhu75)\n  * Materials design (MDESIGN)\n  * Thin films and nano-laminated materials (MDTFNANO)\n  * Unit of Fundamental science of thin films (TFTUNN)\n  * Thin Film Physics (TUNNF)\n  * Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology (IFM)\n  * Faculty of Science and Engineering (Institute of Technology) (LITH)\n  * National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS)\n  * \u00c5ngstr\u00f6mhuset - electron microscopy\n  * Research\n  * News item\n\nShow all tags Show Fewer Tags\n\n## Share on\n\nFacebook X LinkedIn Email\n\n## Link\u00f6ping University\n\nSE-581 83 Link\u00f6ping Sweden\n\n  * infocenter@liu.se\n  * +46 13 281000\n\nAbout this website\n\nLiU's Privacy Policy\n\nManage cookies\n\nWebsite manager: webmaster@liu.se\n\n## Follow us\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n\n## Getting here\n\nMap information\n\nCampus Valla\n\nCampus US\n\nCampus Norrk\u00f6ping\n\nCampus Liding\u00f6\n\n## Quick links\n\nCalendar\n\nLiU Alumni\n\nLiU Webstore\n\nOrganisation\n\nPress\n\nWork at LiU\n\n## University library\n\nLibrary\n\n## Internal\n\nLiU Employees\n\nLiU Students\n\n", "frontpage": true}
