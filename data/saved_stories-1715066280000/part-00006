The talented developer was behind some of the most\npopular jailbreak tools for firmware spanning iOS & iPadOS 11 through 14,\nincluding Electra, Chimera, Odyssey, and Taurine. CoolStar even attempted to\nmake an iOS & iPadOS 15 jailbreak called Cheyote, but later gave up on the\nproject and left the community.\n\nWhile we haven\u2019t heard much from CoolStar since then, apart from a couple of\nunexpected updates to the Taurine jailbreak tool to fix jailbreaking A11\ndevices on iOS & iPadOS 14.0-14.4 and some regressions, the seasoned developer\nshared a life update on Monday that will leave a lot of folks feeling\nnostalgic.\n\nCoolStar appears to have been hired by Apple, an achievement that a lot of\njailbreak developers strive for. They didn\u2019t disclose what they will be doing\nat Apple, but they did say in the official Sileo/Odyssey Team Discord server\nthat they begin the job tomorrow (Tuesday).\n\nAs a part of the announcement, CoolStar said that the role will not allow for\nthe continuance of working on jailbreak related projects. As such, CoolStar\nhas removed DRM from several of their jailbreak tweaks and open-sourced the\ncode so that someone else can pick up where they left off.\n\nFor examples, see below:\n\n  * Ventana (iOS 8 -> 14)\n  * ClassicFolders 3 (iOS 13 & 14)\n  * ClassicFolders 2 (iOS 7 -> 12)\n  * 3DSwitcher 2 (iOS 9 & 10)\n  * ClassicLockScreen (iOS 7 -> 9)\n  * Anemone 3 (iOS 11 -> 13)\n  * Anemone 3 Settings App\n  * Anemone 3 (Optional Extensions)\n  * Libhooker\n  * Libhooker-basebins\n\nCoolStar acknowledges that the decision to open source everything was to do\npaid customers right, as these jailbreak tweaks would never see updates\nanymore if someone else didn\u2019t get the chance to work on them. CoolStar did\nadd that an older version of Xcode would be required to work on the tweaks\nsince they were from 2021 at the latest.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that some of these tweaks require libhooker, and it\u2019s\nunknown if they can be adapted to ElleKit, the modern tweak injection method\nused by the palera1n and Dopamine jailbreaks.\n\nLove them or not, CoolStar has been an important figure in the community and\ncontributed a lot of good to the jailbreaking world we know today. Despite all\nthe controversy and so-called \u2018drama\u2019 that always seemed to occur with every\njailbreak release, CoolStar still made good on developing and releasing\njailbreaks for firmware up to and including iOS & iPadOS 14, and should be\nrecognized for that.\n\nIn any case, we would like to congratulate CoolStar for chasing their dream to\nwork for Apple and seizing the opportunity to do so. We hope it amounts to\ngreat things not only for CoolStar, but for the Apple community in general.\n\nTags Apple CoolStar GitHub iOS iPad iPadOS iPhone\n\nFeatured Stories\n\n### This foldable 3-in-1 Anker wireless charging station is back down to $17\n\n### How to fix music playback pausing or stopping on HomePod\n\n### Rumor: Apple Pencil is about to go Pro\n\n### Kick off the cycling season with WaterField Design\u2019s new magnetic iPhone\npouch and a refreshed leather cycling tote\n\n### 3 ways Apple is celebrating Pride 2024\n\nDownload the iDB app\n\n  * About\n  * Contact\n  * Disclosure\n  * Privacy\n  * Unsubscribe\n\n2024 \u00a9 iDownloadBlog.com This website is not affiliated with Apple.\n\nUpdate Privacy Preferences\n\nA Raptive Partner Site\n\n", "frontpage": true}
