And what does finding that answer reveal about the early days of the\npublication?\n\nBy Nate Rogers Apr 2, 2024, 6:30am EDT\n\nDan Evans\n\n## Share this story\n\n  * Share this on Facebook\n  * Share this on Twitter\n  * Share All sharing options\n\n### Share All sharing options for: The Ballad of Ray Suzuki: The Secret Life\nof Early Pitchfork and the Most Notorious Review Ever \u201cWritten\u201d\n\n  * Flipboard\n  * Email\n\nTheThe mystery was hiding in plain sight. Maybe you missed it, too, over the\nyears, even if you\u2019ve come back to the page dozens of times to revisit one of\nthe most popular and influential posts in Pitchfork\u2019s history: a review of the\nAustralian rock band Jet\u2019s 2006 album, Shine On, which consists solely of an\nembedded YouTube video of a chimp peeing in his own mouth.\n\nIt\u2019s plenty to talk about on its own, after all. The review made instant waves\nat the time with Pitchfork\u2019s skyrocketing audience, and it\u2019s remained in the\nhalls of site lore, even as the publication has gone from a scrappy music blog\nto an entire wing in the sparkling quartz tower of Cond\u00e9 Nast. Over the years,\nthe rotating Pitchfork staff has tended to it like a vigilant gardener,\nperiodically replacing the link with a copy when the video goes dead, allowing\nfuture generations to find it and be moved by its wisdom. (Phoebe Bridgers,\nwho was 12 when the post originally went up, called it \u201cthe best review of all\ntime\u201d in 2016.) But it was only recently that I noticed something that had\nnever caught my eye in all the time I\u2019d spent watching a chimp do unspeakable\nthings. Just who in the hell is Ray Suzuki?\n\nClick on the name listed as the author of the Shine On review and you\u2019ll see\none other post with Suzuki\u2019s name attached\u2014a 2003 write-up of N.W.A\u2019s Straight\nOutta Compton and Efil4zaggin. Dig a little deeper and you\u2019ll see that he\u2019s\nalso the author of a few blurbs\u2014good call including White Town\u2019s \u201cYour Woman\u201d\non the Top Tracks of the 1990s list, Ray\u2014dating as late as 2010. Dig even\ndeeper than that, and you\u2019ll find that Suzuki, ever notable for his range, was\nalso writing news posts on the site in 2001.\n\n\u201cOh, Ray,\u201d said Pitchfork founder Ryan Schreiber, when I got him on the phone.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have written that N.W.A review, probably.\u201d\n\nI wanted to know how a person could fill such a strange, unique role in\nPitchfork history and then quietly disappear. And so I began my search for Ray\nSuzuki plainly enough: by hunting for a writer with that name, who perhaps had\ndemonstrated an inconsistent work ethic and an appreciation for the nuances of\nindie rock. But the hunt ended up bringing me much further into the depths of\nPitchfork\u2019s history than I could have anticipated. It illuminated an\nunderground ethos that fueled the publication\u2019s rise\u2014a passionate,\nexperimental, and sometimes childish approach that feels particularly distant\nin 2024, as the site has found itself in dire corporate straits. (In January,\nCond\u00e9 Nast laid off a significant portion of Pitchfork\u2019s staff and announced\nthat it would be folding its operation into GQ.) It also brought me to the\nheart of Jet, the band caught in all this.\n\nWhat I ended up finding is that Suzuki was in some sense the 2000s era of the\nsite personified\u2014which is particularly impressive given his mortal\nlimitations. \u201cThough I have great respect for Ray,\u201d said Chris Kaskie, former\npresident of Pitchfork, \u201cRay Suzuki was not a real person.\u201d\n\nMyMy first breakthrough in the case landed after I began emailing a variety of\n2000s Pitchfork figures\u2014some staff, some contributors\u2014to ask whether they knew\nhow to track down the esteemed Suzuki. One person, who asked to remain\nanonymous, gave me the tip that rearranged my brain on the matter. \u201cRay Suzuki\nwas like Pitchfork\u2019s Alan Smithee,\u201d they told me in an email, referencing the\npseudonym used by directors in the 20th century who didn\u2019t want their name on\na film. This explained Suzuki\u2019s unlikely genre spectrum and the broad time\nframe of his work\u2014and it also likely explained the N.W.A review, which was\noriginally published under the name of a different, seemingly real\ncontributor. (Using the Wayback Machine, you can see that, in 2012, Suzuki was\nswapped in.)\n\nBut it turns out that being an Alan Smithee wasn\u2019t the alias\u2019s initial\npurpose. When it first started appearing as a byline in news posts in 2001, it\nwas actually a punishment. At that time, all the contributors were writing for\nfree, and many of them were less than reliable. Brian Roberts, the then\u2013news\neditor, had asked contributors to make sure to include their bylines with\ntheir news submissions, \u201cprobably so I didn\u2019t have to track what email\naddresses were associated with which writer,\u201d he explained in an email,\nbemused that he\u2019d been tracked down. (\u201cI\u2019m not even a footnote in the history\nof Pitchfork, I\u2019m more like a toe-note,\u201d he wrote.) The threat, if any of the\nhodgepodge of college students and hobbyists failed to honor this request, was\nthat a different writer would be given the credit instead. This writer\u2019s name\nwas Ray Suzuki.\n\nFor no real reason, Roberts took the moniker from \u201cBallad of Ray Suzuki,\u201d a\n1999 song by Looper, the postmodern electronic project of Stuart David, the\noriginal bassist of Belle and Sebastian, and his wife, Karn. (Pitchfork\u2019s\nreview of Looper\u2019s debut LP, Up a Tree, which includes Ray\u2019s theme: 8.1.)\nDavid, in turn, had gotten the name from a friend of his, Adrian Stewart, who\ndid DJ sets as Ray Suzuki and was immortalized by providing the spoken word\nvocals on his namesake track and by riding one of the Vespas in the video.\nStewart, for his part, had taken the name from Mark Gordon, of the Irish band\nTunic, who used to come up with quirky noms de plume for bandmates and\nfriends.\n\nRay Suzuki was an alias that was \u201cgoing spare,\u201d as Gordon explained in an\nemail, and Stewart ended up with it. Gordon said the name was in the tradition\nof \u201cthe Bowie \u201970s thing of sticking random words together and seeing if a\nvery mild form of alchemy occurred.\u201d \u201cSuzuki\u201d came from the motorcycle\ncompany. Through all this kismet, the name found its way back to Pitchfork,\nwhere Ray Suzuki was brought to life, sort of.\n\nThere were other Pitchfork aliases in the early days\u2014G.P. Sippy, John Toes,\netc.\u2014and Schreiber said some of those came from an \u201canything goes\u201d mentality.\n(James P. Wisdom\u2014who gave Pink Floyd\u2019s Animals a perfect 10 in 2000\u2014is an\nactual guy, I was shocked to learn.) But Suzuki had more staying power than\nthe others. \u201cI always loved the name,\u201d Schreiber said. \u201cIt\u2019s got so much\npizzazz.\u201d\n\nIt also developed a different utility in the news department: making readers\nbelieve Pitchfork was more bustling than it actually was. \u201cThere were many\ndays when the only news writing on the site was by Ryan and/or myself,\u201d said\nWill Bryant, a Pitchfork news editor in the early 2000s, via email. \u201cIt would\nbe super-lame to give every byline to ourselves, so we added Ray Suzuki for\nseasoning.\u201d\n\nSchreiber hired Kaskie as his first full-time employee, and soon after brought\nin Ryan Kennedy, Kaskie\u2019s best friend, as general manager. Kaskie and Kennedy\nhad met while working together as interns at The Onion, where they bonded over\nmusic, in between trips lugging sacks of mail to the post office. They also\ndeveloped their own internal sense of humor.\n\n\u201cWe would email each other the stupidest, weirdest stuff back and forth,\u201d\nKennedy remembered of their Onion days, \u201cjust trying to make each other laugh.\nWe really didn\u2019t think or care about the business\u2014it was like a Don Draper\nthing. Like, I want to make Kaskie lose his shit at his desk right now. And he\nwants to do the same.\u201d\n\n\"\u201cWe wanted to lead with quality, to be trusted, to be thoughtful and mindful\nand a beacon to our users. Stunt reviews [like the Shine On review] felt\nclosed off and limiting, like you were talking to members of a club to which I\ndidn\u2019t necessarily want to belong.\u201d \u2014Scott Plagenhoef\"\n\nKennedy\u2019s first day at Pitchfork was spent helping the publication move out of\nSchreiber\u2019s basement, and they carried some of the prankster spirit into the\nnew office, which was in Chicago\u2019s Logan Square neighborhood. With Scott\nPlagenhoef, the first outside editorial hire, also on board, Pitchfork had\ntransformed into a team of young, highly opinionated music nerds with little\nformal editorial experience (little professional experience at all, really),\nwho all saw the latent power of the internet that was lurking.\n\n\u201cI was watching The Onion invest heavily in more print markets for their\nnewspaper,\u201d said Kaskie, \u201clike, \u2018Wait a minute, you know that the internet\u2019s a\nthing?\u2019\u201d He explained that The Onion\u2014satire as it may be\u2014was a crash course in\nhow media companies were failing to meet the moment online, \u201cwhere so much\nopportunity lived that they weren\u2019t paying attention to.\u201d\n\nAs Pitchfork grew in popularity, there was a conscious effort to become more\nserious, more legit. Pseudonyms were used less frequently, and writers with\noutside clout began to contribute substantial pieces\u2014including some of the\nmost legendary perfect-score reviews of the new century. But progress on this\nfront wasn\u2019t a straight line, as anyone regularly checking the site could\ntell. One of the most storied stunt posts in Pitchfork history ran in 2008,\nwhen Black Kids\u2019 Partie Traumatic was reviewed with text that just read \u201csorry\n:-/\u201d over a picture of two pugs (score: 3.3). The post, credited to Plagenhoef\nand featuring Kaskie\u2019s dogs, was meant as a mea culpa for having previously\nhyped the band up.\n\n\u201cSometimes [the tone] could be brash, sometimes it could be super passionate,\u201d\nsaid Kaskie, \u201cbut all of it was rooted in the love of music, and that was\nclear.\u201d He said they weren\u2019t checking their analytics or studying traffic\npatterns to decide what to do that day: \u201cWhat was really exciting was just\nknowing that, when you don\u2019t have rules, you can kind of set your own.\u201d\n\nFiguringFiguring out that Ray Suzuki was an Alan Smithee was one thing, but\nnarrowing down who, exactly, had used it for the Jet review was something else\naltogether. For a while I was getting nowhere by taking guesses at likely\nwriters. There was Nick Sylvester, for example, who wrote the savage Pitchfork\nreview of the first Jet album, 2003\u2019s Get Born (score: 3.7); he never got back\nto me. There was Rob Mitchum, who wrote another memorable Pitchfork pan from a\nfew months after the Shine On review\u2014of Wilco\u2019s Sky Blue Sky (score: 5.2);\nwasn\u2019t him, he told me in an email. (\u201cThe legacy of one notorious review is\nmore than enough, ha,\u201d Mitchum said.)\n\nRelated\n\n#### Pitch Perfect: The History and Influence of the Pitchfork 10.0\n\nI was beginning to fear I was never going to learn who \u201cwrote\u201d the review when\nPlagenhoef said he might have some answers\u2014but warned that he had to get any\ninterview requests approved by Apple, where he works as global head of music\nprogramming. I sent a list of formal questions and waited anxiously, thinking\nabout how Jet\u2019s debut single, \u201cAre You Gonna Be My Girl\u201d\u2014a foot-tapping\nearworm of a bar-rock song\u2014was catapulted into ubiquity by being featured in\nan iPod commercial. (The song reached no. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100, and Get\nBorn ultimately sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.) I had visions of\nPR professionals, black silhouettes at a conference table with white AirPods\nglistening in their ears, telling Plagenhoef to stay out of this one. But then\nthe email came through.\n\n\u201cThree of us,\u201d Plagenhoef wrote, referring to himself, Kaskie, and Kennedy,\n\u201csat at a separate table from the rest of the group and conceived of the\nreview.\u201d\n\nThe scene was Lula Cafe, which is directly downstairs from the old Pitchfork\noffice, where the entire staff\u2014at this point featuring additional employees\nand interns\u2014had gone for a celebratory lunch of some kind. There\u2019s discrepancy\nabout who was explicitly a part of this conversation; Schreiber remembers\nbeing involved, but Plagenhoef, Kaskie, and Kennedy remember being sectioned\noff. Regardless, there was discussion about what to do with this new Jet\nrecord, which, everyone at hand seemed to agree, was terrible.\n\nFor anyone who has ever wanted a Pitchfork review of Shine On with actual\nwords, this explanation from Plagenhoef is as close as you\u2019re going to get:\n\n> We were talking about the central problem as we saw it with the record, how\n> the Return to Rock trend that started with the Strokes, White Stripes, and\n> Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2014and really rock in general\u2014had curdled into a set of lazy\n> signifiers and poses. When the point or driver of what you\u2019re doing is\n> reclamation it\u2019s inherently limiting and resistant to new ideas. It\u2019s a\n> creative cul-de-sac. Progression\u2014whether it was in hip-hop, pop, guitar\n> music, electronic music\u2014was important to us at the time. Seeing mainstream\n> rock music, which of course most of us had grown up with a fondness for,\n> become so knuckle-dragging and Xeroxed was disappointing.\n\nSuch was the verdict of the critical merit of Jet, but after Sylvester\u2019s\nconceptual review for Get Born, which took the form of a made-up conversation\nbetween the band and a venue manager, going back to a straightforward album\nreview for Shine On \u201cfelt unnecessary,\u201d wrote Plagenhoef. \u201cIt was almost\nbetter to not bother reviewing the record and giving space to something else,\u201d\nhe explained. \u201cSo the challenge became, Is there some third approach? And\nthat\u2019s when we started throwing out ideas for something metaphorical and\ndismissive.\u201d\n\nKennedy and Kaskie\u2014two operational employees who never had formal bylines on\nthe site\u2014clicked back into their collaborative shitposting mindset to help\nfigure something out. A third approach that Kennedy considered was in the\nstyle of a recent post he\u2019d enjoyed that was published the previous year on\nTiny Mix Tapes, a music blog that has since been unplugged. It was a review\nfor Nine Inch Nails\u2019 With Teeth that was absent of text or a byline\u2014and\ninstead featured just an embedded image of the album being thrown in a digital\nrecycling bin of a computer (score: 1.5 out of 5).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reader interpretation,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIt\u2019s thrown in the garbage.\nHaha. Done. I\u2019m like, \u2018You know, I would love to do something with that. We\ncould do better.\u2019 And in my head, I\u2019m thinking of images and all these things,\nand nothing\u2019s really hitting. Kaskie\u2019s sitting there, we\u2019re kind of riffing,\ngoing back and forth. And then he\u2019s just like, \u2018The monkey drinking its\npiss.\u2019\u201d\n\n\"\u201cAnd it\u2019s not so much about having hit songs but it is about finding that\nthing in your creativity where it\u2019s going to be remembered. You don\u2019t want to\nbe a fucking footnote, you know what I mean? All artists strive for it, and\nnone of them admit it.\u201d \u2014Chris Cester of Jet\"\n\nThe video\u2014succinctly titled \u201cFunny monkey peeing in his own mouth EPIC\u201d\u2014was\noriginally something that Kaskie had sent Kennedy in their Onion days, after\nKaskie\u2019s mom, Jane, had sent it to him, in an attempt to \u201cspeak their\nlanguage,\u201d as Kennedy reasoned it. (\u201cIf she was to walk into a room you would\nbe like, \u2018No way did she send this.\u2019\u201d) The video had made its way into the\nPitchfork office over time, a sort of proto-meme among a few people. And as\nsoon as Kaskie suggested it for the review, Plagenhoef\u2014by all accounts a stoic\nand serious person\u2014was cracking up, and they knew they had something. \u201cFucking\nKaskie hit the cigarette with the tip of the whip right there,\u201d said Kennedy.\n(It should also be stated directly that despite its name, the clip actually\ncaptures a chimp urinating, not a monkey. To some, that\u2019s an important\ndistinction; to others, they\u2019re practically one and the same.)\n\nJust nine seconds in length, the video contains within it what Kennedy, at\nleast, sees as the perfect narrative for how they felt about Jet and Shine On:\n\u201cThe monkey,\u201d he explained, \u201cthe way he tilts his head and gets blasted in the\nface\u2014and then goes back for seconds! That is where I\u2019m won over. He drinks,\ngets shot in the eye, and then he looks right at the camera, and he goes right\nback for more! He\u2019s communicating, like, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing, you can\u2019t\nstop me.\u2019\u201d Kennedy described Sylvester\u2019s Get Born review as describing a band\n\u201cintoxicated by its own sweat.\u201d \u201cLike the monkey, they go back for more,\u201d\nKennedy said, \u201cbecause they like their own taste.\u201d\n\nWhenWhen the Shine On review was originally published\u2014with the decision to\ngive the collaborative effort of the staff to Ray Suzuki\u2014it had no score. The\nvideo was the score.\n\nThis put it in the canon of Pitchfork reviews that experimented with the\nscoring form, like Bob Pollard\u2019s Relaxation of the Asshole, which was given a\nsimultaneous 10 and 0, or Radiohead\u2019s In Rainbows, which, in the spirit of the\nband\u2019s pay-what-you-want model for that album, provided an option for readers\nto provide their own score. Later on, the Pitchfork CMS required that a\ntraditional number be put in for albums, and the nuance of this type of review\nwas lost. Pollard was stripped of his 10 at that point. Radiohead were given a\n9.3. Jet were given a 0.0.\n\nBut even without the original zero score, the review had an immediate impact\nwhen it went up. Some remember the response to it being negative, some\nremember it being positive\u2014but either way, it got people\u2019s attention, that\nmuch everyone remembers. And without so much as a single word of copy, it\ncommunicated everything about the Pitchfork agenda.\n\n\u201cJet was the whole goal,\u201d Kaskie said. \u201cIrreverence, new ideas, playing with\nthe tools the internet had to offer.\u201d Schreiber reminded me, with a laugh, of\nhow new YouTube was at that time\u2014only a year old\u2014and that embedding videos was\nthen \u201ccutting-edge tech.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing that I really tried to do with Pitchfork in the early days,\u201d\nSchreiber said, \u201cwas think of it as entertainment.\u201d He emphasized that they\n\u201ctook the music extremely seriously,\u201d but also that they wanted to find ways\nto \u201ccatch you off guard and knock you back a step.\u201d In this case maybe two\nsteps.\n\nIn the 2000s, Pitchfork learned how to use its powers for good, putting\nrelatively unknown acts like Arcade Fire on the map. But perhaps just as\nimportantly, it also developed quite a punch. Like a young Mike Tyson,\nPitchfork arrived on the scene with vicious, violent right hooks that could\neasily end the careers of musicians stepping into the ring\u2014musicians who, in\nmany cases, never really had a chance in the first place. The cautionary tale\nin the Pitchfork world is its 2004 review of Travistan, the solo debut of the\nDismemberment Plan\u2019s Travis Morrison, which was given a 0.0. In its wake,\nrecord stores wouldn\u2019t stock the album, and Morrison\u2019s musical reputation was\nseverely damaged. After this, \u201cthe Pitchfork Effect\u201d was recognized in The New\nYork Times and Wired as something to reckon with.\n\nIn 2018, the writer Amos Barshad did a story for Slate in which he attempted\ninterviews with various artists, like Morrison, who had received knockout\nblows of 0.0. With the exception of Sonic Youth\u2019s Thurston Moore, no one\nagreed to be interviewed, including Jet. Morrison, clearly struggling with the\nsubject, sent an email saying it was a \u201creally frightening and awful\nexperience\u201d to be pummeled by Pitchfork, and described the ongoing horrors of\nbeing \u201cbranded\u201d by the review.\n\nMost Pitchfork figures I spoke to noted that Jet was a major-label band and\nsuggested that this made them fairer game than, say, Travis Morrison. But when\nI called Barshad, he emphasized the way status didn\u2019t seem to make a\ndifference in how it felt to the artist. Even with \u201cclear indie-rock legend\nguy\u201d Moore, he said\u2014whose accolades obviously supersede one bad review of the\nSonic Youth album NYC Ghosts & Flowers\u2014Pitchfork\u2019s 0.0 did not come across as\na glancing blow. \u201cHe remembered the details of it, and was putting it into the\ncontext of where the band was at the time,\u201d Barshad said. \u201cSo it obviously\nleft a mark even on him.\u201d\n\nAfter I reached out to Jet to ask for an interview, their manager told me he\ndidn\u2019t think anyone in the group would want to talk. I then emailed Dave\nSardy, the producer of Get Born and Shine On, who initially said OK before\nthinking twice. \u201cIs this a hit job on Jet?\u201d he asked. Despite my best efforts\nto convince him otherwise, I never heard from him again.\n\n\u201cI used to really like my own harsh reviews if they were well written,\u201d said\nStuart David of Looper, calling from Scotland. Our conversation was initially\nabout his group\u2019s unlikely role in this saga via \u201cBallad of Ray Suzuki,\u201d but\nwhile I had him, I asked for his perspective, as a fellow artist, on the Jet\nreview. He could still recall a line from a negative 2005 NME review of\nLooper\u2019s third LP, The Snare\u2014\u201cthe desultory whoosh of a once-promising career\nas it plummets, irretrievably, down the art-pop pan\u201d\u2014and its writer, Sarah\nDempster (score: 1 out of 5). \u201cThat\u2019s clever,\u201d he said. The Shine On review,\nas he saw it, was just \u201ctrolling people who couldn\u2019t reply or couldn\u2019t troll\nback.\u201d \u201cTo do it anonymously,\u201d he considered, \u201cseems quite cowardly, I think.\u201d\n\n\"\u201cYou learn that pretty early on about being in the spotlight, if you get\nreally excited about people kissing your ass, you get really upset when people\nkick you in the balls.\u201d \u2014Cester\"\n\nFor many years, Jet didn\u2019t seem to weigh in on the matter. They released one\nmore album, 2009\u2019s Shaka Rock, and broke up in 2012. But after Phoebe Bridgers\ncommented on a 2021 Instagram post by Pitchfork about the review\u2014\u201cI think\nabout this once a day,\u201d she wrote\u2014Chris Cester, Jet\u2019s drummer, replied to her.\n\n\u201cI think I saw you on SNL recently it was really cool ...\u201d he replied. \u201cDid\nyou smash your guitar or something? It was a huge statement. Dangerous.\u201d He\nended his comment with \u201cIt\u2019s tough out there best of luck to you.\u201d Cester was\ndoing what he couldn\u2019t in 2006: trolling back.\n\nItIt shouldn\u2019t be too surprising that Jet\u2019s opinion on this matter might end\nup being playful in its own right. One of the band\u2019s best-known songs, the\nKinks-ish romp \u201cRollover D.J.,\u201d is essentially a monkey-piss-level review of\nDJ culture. \u201cWell, I know that you think you\u2019re a star,\u201d Chris\u2019s brother Nic\nsings. \u201cA pill-poppin\u2019 jukebox is all that you are.\u201d\n\nWhen I sent Chris Cester\u2014who, with Nic, is a cowriter of most Jet songs\u2014an\nInstagram message, I didn\u2019t really expect a response. I did my best to explain\nthat I was coming from a place of respect, even though I recognized it was a\ndelicate subject.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not delicate,\u201d Chris wrote back, \u201ctbh the first time I saw it I laughed\nmy ass off.\u201d\n\nChris called me a few days later while he was getting his car washed and said\nhe honestly didn\u2019t know who Bridgers was when he saw her comment. He then\nlooked her up and was unimpressed by her SNL performance, in which she broke a\nguitar. (The event was arranged with discreet pyrotechnics to go off when\nBridgers struck a dummy PA; David Crosby called it \u201cpathetic,\u201d and Bridgers\nreplied by calling him a \u201clittle bitch.\u201d) \u201cShe\u2019s got her thing,\u201d Chris said,\nin a thick Aussie accent. \u201cPeople seem to like it, I guess, if you\u2019ve got a\ncardigan or something.\u201d\n\nA (Brief) History of Pitchfork Stunt Reviews\n\nWhile none may be as historically significant as \u201cWhat is this shit?\u201d\u2014or as\nbeloved as \u201cshit sandwich\u201d\u2014Pitchfork has pulled its fair share of stunt\nreviews over the years. Here\u2019s an incomplete timeline:\n\n2001: Tool, Lateralus. Shortly before his infamous Kid A review, Brent\nDiCrescenzo wrote this from the perspective of a fictional high schooler\nobsessed with the band. \u201cThere is simply no way you could just dismiss the\nmusic,\u201d said DiCrescenzo\u2019s stand-in. Well, Pitchfork could\u2014with a 1.9.\n\n2002: Eminem, The Eminem Show. A review light on punctuation and heavy on\npraise that ends with an AIM conversation. It\u2019s a shitpost that captures the\nspirit of Eminem better than anything else said about his music.\n\n2005: Robert Pollard, Relaxation of the Asshole. The Guided by Voices frontman\nreleased a live comedy album. Pitchfork got its jokes off too, giving the\nrecord a 10.0 and 0.0 simultaneously.\n\n2007: Radiohead, In Rainbows. Radiohead allowed listeners to pay what they\nwanted for the album. So Pitchfork followed suit, allowing readers to give In\nRainbows their own score. (But really, it was a 9.3.)\n\n2008: Black Kids, Partie Traumatic. As a mea culpa for praising the band\u2019s\nearlier EP, this review consisted solely of a pic of two pugs with the caption\n\u201cSorry :-/\u201d\n\n2015: Pope Francis, Wake Up! In a lukewarm pan, P4K gave the pontiff a 3.16,\nnaturally. It was eventually given a slightly more reverential grade of 5.0.\n\n2021: Peppa Pig, Peppa\u2019s Adventures: The Album. \u201cPeppa is, of course, a very\nyoung artist,\u201d says this 6.5 review of the animated star\u2019s album. \u201cOne hopes\nthat she will refine her political sensibility as she matures.\u201d She hasn\u2019t\nreleased an album since.\n\nCareful not to be perceived as speaking for the whole band, Chris explained\nthat, after being featured in the iPod commercial, he felt like Jet had an\nApple-shaped target on its back. He noted that it was a wonderful boon to have\nsuch immediate mainstream exposure\u2014if anything rivaled the Pitchfork Effect in\n2004, it was the iPod Effect\u2014but brought up the cost as well. \u201cThat was still\nkind of a faux pas at that point,\u201d he said, joking that, given the encouraging\nattitude about artists having their music in commercials these days, Jet could\nbe called \u201ctrailblazers.\u201d \u201cLike any 22-year-old,\u201d he said, describing himself\nwhen Get Born came out, \u201cyou\u2019re looking outside for validation. I\u2019m 42 now.\nThings have changed in that regard.\u201d\n\nChris said he remembered the band thinking the Shine On review was funny but\nacknowledged that it might have initially bothered them \u201cfor like a week.\u201d\nThat the general feeling was that it was \u201cbullshit,\u201d \u201cpretty snarky,\u201d and\n\u201cunfair.\u201d Still, he insisted, he shook it off because you have to when you\u2019re\nin that position: \u201cYou learn that pretty early on about being in the\nspotlight,\u201d Chris said, \u201cif you get really excited about people kissing your\nass, you get really upset when people kick you in the balls.\u201d\n\nShine On ended up becoming the last non-compilation album to receive a 0.0\nfrom Pitchfork, and that\u2019s likely because it was realized that the score was\nan unnecessarily low blow. \u201cA lot of the records that we had already given the\nzero to,\u201d Schreiber said, \u201cin hindsight, they might have been awful records,\nbut to say that they have absolutely no merit whatsoever is just probably\nfalse.\u201d Kennedy described the zero for Jet as being \u201ca pretty nakedly dirty\ngrade.\u201d \u201cI guess even monkey piss has some value to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s,\nlike, some potassium.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether Pitchfork\u2019s review was \u201cfair\u201d to Jet was something I\nhad spent a decent amount of time thinking about. From a certain angle, the\nreview feels less like a piece of music criticism and more like a Dada-ist\njoke on what music criticism even is. Or at the very least like a shitpost\nthat was prophetic in its use of the visual, flippant language people would\nsoon be employing en masse to post about art online. Squint, and it\u2019s a\nmasterpiece ... of some kind. But it goes down in the stats sheet as an actual\nreview\u2014and in that sense, it wasn\u2019t really fair to Jet.\n\nIn some sense, the review may not even be fair to Pitchfork, either. Amy\nPhillips, who was at the fabled lunch as a new employee\u2014and would stay at\nPitchfork for 18 years, eventually becoming executive editor, until she was\ncaught in this year\u2019s layoffs\u2014described the review as \u201cthe lowest form of\nreacting to something.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of like putting a middle finger up and\nmoving on,\u201d Phillips said. In terms of memorable Pitchfork pans, she\u2019s partial\nto the carefully thought-out ones, like current reviews director Jeremy\nLarson\u2019s more recent takedowns of Greta Van Fleet (score: 1.6) and M\u00e5neskin\n(2.0). Plagenhoef, similarly, feels that the Jet review unduly takes the focus\naway from all the great actual writing that\u2019s been on the site over the years,\nand all he and others did to build Pitchfork into the editorial powerhouse\nthat it became.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to lead with quality,\u201d Plagenhoef wrote, \u201cto be trusted, to be\nthoughtful and mindful and a beacon to our users. Stunt reviews [like the\nShine On review] felt closed off and limiting, like you were talking to\nmembers of a club to which I didn\u2019t necessarily want to belong.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019sWhat\u2019s happened to Pitchfork since 2006 is easy to oversimplify.\nConscious decisions were made to embrace the increased responsibility that\ncame from popularity\u2014and with that, the prankster spirit was eroded over time.\n\u201cWatching that go sucked, for sure,\u201d said Kennedy, who ended his second stint\nwith Pitchfork in 2019. The editorial voice also became less aggressive and\nreactive, as well as more open to the critical value of pop and major-label\nmusic in all its forms. Most Pitchfork figures seem to agree that this was, by\nand large, a good and necessary evolution. (Unless you\u2019re asking Chris Ott.)\nBut simultaneous to any conscious internal evolution, outside market forces\nwere pushing the entire music industry in a direction that publications had to\nadjust to.\n\n\u201cSocial media and late capitalism,\u201d said Plagenhoef, who left Pitchfork as\neditor in chief in 2011, \u201chave each sucked up so much of the energy around\ncultural conversation for different reasons and in different ways to the\ndetriment of not only critics but entire industries.\u201d Kaskie, who left\nPitchfork two years after Cond\u00e9 Nast purchased it in 2015, brought up the way\nthat culture started to homogenize; how Jay-Z was turning up at Grizzly Bear\nshows and Bon Iver was featuring on Kanye West records. \u201cSuddenly you\u2019re\ntrying to cover everything,\u201d he said, \u201cjust so you can make sure you get\neverybody to pay attention to what you\u2019re doing, and you lose focus.\u201d He went\non, \u201cTo see something getting bigger for the sake of scale you start to\ndisconnect, and that seemed like a tension point that may have happened at\nCond\u00e9.\u201d\n\nStill, Pitchfork has remained the most powerful voice in music journalism,\neven if that voice is simply less powerful than it used to be due to forces\nlargely outside its control. Which is why it was such a shock that Cond\u00e9 Nast\ndidn\u2019t see enough value to keep from implementing a red wedding. Pitchfork,\nonce the heavyweight champ, got knocked in the teeth, and it\u2019s staggering. But\nit\u2019s not down yet.\n\n\u201cI think the important thing is to not lose sight of that,\u201d Schreiber said, in\nreference to the fact that Pitchfork, which he left in 2019, remains a highly\npopular site. (A Cond\u00e9 Nast analytics employee stated in January that\nPitchfork had the highest daily site visitors of any CN title; a CN\nrepresentative confirmed this after publication.) \u201cAnd to know that a lot of\nthese layoffs are happening because some people at the top of these\ncorporations are just not making the most informed decisions that they\nprobably could be.\u201d One bright spot after the layoffs, Schreiber said, was\nthat many Pitchfork figures were back in touch again after years of drifting\napart. \u201cI do think there\u2019s an opportunity for a lot of us right now,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a lot of appetite for trying to figure out a way for us all to\nmove forward collectively.\u201d\n\nAs for Jet, they recently reunited and are continuing to do tour dates to\ncelebrate the 20th anniversary of Get Born. Reflecting on the road he\u2019s gone\ndown with the band, Chris Cester doesn\u2019t regret anything.\n\n\u201cThis is the thing with Jet,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one of us individually are quite\ncapable of doing something complicated that\u2019s harder to decipher, wander off\nfor seven minutes, and impress people. But none of that shit gets remembered.\nAnd it\u2019s not so much about having hit songs but it is about finding that thing\nin your creativity where it\u2019s going to be remembered. You don\u2019t want to be a\nfucking footnote, you know what I mean? All artists strive for it, and none of\nthem admit it.\u201d\n\nWhile I was working on this story, a friend sent me a video from a wedding he\nattended. It was the bride and groom\u2019s first dance, and the song they had\nchosen was Jet\u2019s \u201cLook What You\u2019ve Done,\u201d from Get Born. The song, a\nsurprisingly tasteful ballad, sounds fresh\u2014it feels of its time and outside\nit, as well. I wouldn\u2019t call it a detour in a creative cul-de-sac. More like a\nstretch down a peaceful highway at night.\n\n\u201cYou sound like you\u2019ve got your shit together,\u201d Chris said to me, while we\nwere talking about Shine On. \u201cWhat did you think about the album when you\nheard it?\u201d\n\nI told him the truth, which was that Get Born was a formative record for my\n13-year-old self when it came out and helped set me on a path of finding a\nbroader musical world as a teenager. (Pitchfork, in turn, helped substantially\nwith that process.) But partially because of the initial influence of\nPitchfork\u2019s review, I had only really listened to Shine On in recent months\nand thought it demonstrated admirable growth from Jet. I particularly like the\nsong \u201cBring It on Back,\u201d which sounds something like Spoon doing an Oasis\ncover. It is not a glass of monkey piss, by any stretch. \u201cLooking back [on\nShine On] after all this time,\u201d Chris said, \u201cI\u2019m really proud.\u201d\n\nAt one point, I decided to read through other prominent reviews of Shine On\nthat came out in 2006. They may not have gotten the clicks that Pitchfork\ndid\u2014and they don\u2019t make me laugh like that foul, foul chimp\u2014but they were\ndecidedly more measured, thoughtful, and, yes, fair. More than anything, the\nother reviews are just a useful reminder that there are additional opinions of\nShine On worth considering besides Ray Suzuki\u2019s.\n\nOne that stood out was written by Alexis Petridis in The Guardian (score: 3\nout of 5), published a few days before Pitchfork\u2019s review. Petridis isn\u2019t over\nthe moon about the record, but he\u2019s honest about having found some charm in\nit, too. \u201cNobody is going to buy Shine On expecting intellectual\nenlightenment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s trad-rock ordinaire, yet something lifts it\nout of the ordinary: its cheek, maybe, or its freewheeling vitality, or the\noccasional musical surprise it springs. Perhaps most appealingly, given the\ncurrent inhibitions of mainstream rock, Shine On doesn\u2019t appear to give a\nmonkey\u2019s.\u201d\n\nNate Rogers is a writer in Los Angeles.
