While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when dealing with\nfiles larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due to limitations\nin memory, checksumming time, or disk space. Even without file content\ntracking, being able to manage files with git, move files around and delete\nfiles with versioned directory trees, and use branches and distributed clones,\nare all very handy reasons to use git. And annexed files can co-exist in the\nsame git repository with regularly versioned files, which is convenient for\nmaintaining documents, Makefiles, etc that are associated with annexed files\nbut that benefit from full revision control. When a file is annexed, its\ncontent is moved into a key-value store, and a symlink is made that points to\nthe content. These symlinks are checked into git and versioned like regular\nfiles. You can move them around, delete them, and so on. Pushing to another\ngit repository will make git-annex there aware of the annexed file, and it can\nbe used to retrieve its content from the key-value store.minor feature: :\nWhile redundant concurrent transfers were already. Prevented in most cases, it\nfailed to prevent the case where Two different repositories were sending the\nsame content to The same repository. Addurl, importfeed: Added --verifiable\noption, which improves.

From ARM,\nM68K, MIPS, HPPA, PowerPC, RISCV, SPARC to X86-64, Glibc to Musl, T2 supports\nall major CPU architectures, C libraries, GUI systems and desktop environments\nas well as countless of special purpose and embedded firmware packages! While\ninitially focused on the Linux kernel, T2 already has proof-of-concept support\nfor building \"homebrew\" pkg ports for Other OS, including: BSDs, macOS and\nHaiku. With support already wide and versatile, we do not intend to stop here,\nand plan to improve T2's \"home-brew\" support, as well as bootstrapping\nalternative micro kernels, such as L4, Fuchsia, RedoxOS or integrating\nbuilding \"AOSP\" Android as well.minor feature: T2 24.5 \"Future Nostalgia\"\n2024-04-28 T2 24.5 was released as a major milestone release not only\nincluding the latest and greatest Linux kernel, GCC, LLVM / Clang, Glibc,\nMusl, uClibc, X.org, Mesa3D, but also the KDE and GNOME desktop packages\nupdated and fixed to finally mostly cross compile. While at it, we also\nundeleted IA-64 Itanium support! ;-) A total of 36 pre-compiled base install\nISOs for various Glibc, Musl and uClibc combinations are available for for 25\nCPU ISAs: Alpha, Arc, ARM(64), Avr32, HPPA(64), IA64, Loongarch64, M68k,\nMicroblaze, MIPS(64), Nios2, OpenRISC, PowerPC(64), RISCV(64), s390x,\nSPARC(64), SuperH, i486, i686, x86-64 and x32. On most architectures the\nrelease still boots with 512MB of RAM or even less, and are on average just\none GB in size. Most vintage Xorg drivers were fixed to actually work again.\nThe rolling release is updated using the scripted source build system and thus\noptimized for the native system CPU. The release contains a total of 5140\nchangesets, including approximately 5314 package updates, 564 issues fixed,\n317 packages or features added and 163 removed. Around 53 improvements.
