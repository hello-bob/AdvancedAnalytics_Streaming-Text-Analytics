I\u2019m\nreally proud with how it turned it for a reasons technical and non-technical,\nand wanted to gather my thoughts below.\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 When buttons were good\n\nI explored the idea of Windows 98 style button borders with a small codepen\nabout two years prior. The inspiration being your typical nostalgia trip \u2013 my\nlittle jordan brain was forming while sitting in front of my family computer\n(probably playing Pajama Sam or Backyard Soccer) and the \u201cchiseled marble\u201d\nstaircase buttons were always nearby.\n\nI clicked on a lot of these buttons and I read a lot of their labels. The\nfonts, the gray surfaces, and the shadows were as important to me as my color-\ncoded binders (Math is Blue and Science is Green by the way).\n\nThey are an integral part of my early computing story, and because I have\nspent a significant chunk of my waking life on the computer, they are part of\nmy story.\n\n6 year old Jordan, the button-enjoyer. When you\u2019re mean to me online this is\nwho you\u2019re being mean to.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to hear me rant about nostalgia more you can read some pull\nquotes from this post on The Register, my interview with Henry Zhu on Hope in\nSource, or buy buying me a margarita somewhere in lower Manhattan.\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 When everything else was bad\n\nI sat on the idea for a few years while writing computer programs at Stripe,\nranging from customer support chatboxes to our unreasonably-handsome-because-\nwhy-not intranet called Home. It was a really good gig.\n\nAbout two and a half years in however, the world got weird. Small pockets of\npublic life became temporarily inaccessible, I couldn\u2019t get my hair cut,\nrestaurants got really good at take-out, and a bunch of hogs thought masks\nwere engineered to keep them from being patriots or something I don\u2019t know I\ncouldn\u2019t really understand them between their asbestos coughs.\n\nI was fresh off a re-org and started to burn out with the rest of the world.\nMy sleep got worse, I lost the ability to focus, and for the first time in my\ncareer I started to become pretty bad at my job. I had color-coded binders\n(Language Arts is Yellow by the way) so this was new to me and I didn\u2019t really\nknow how to deal with it.\n\nMy doctor informed me we could turn up the Lexapro dose a little, but I\nultimately decided it would be better if I just took a break, so I did.\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 Hello old friend\n\nI spent the first few weeks learning how to sleep and going for long walks (I\ngot really good at both). I wasn\u2019t particularly excited by the idea of writing\ncomputer programs, and was troubled by the idea that I might never be excited\nabout it again.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to turn off my brain was SimGolf, a turn-of-the-\ncentury world-builder/simulator centered around owning a golf course.\n\nI played it on \u2013 you can see where this is headed \u2013 my Windows 98 virtual\nmachine. In between rounds I was once again confronted with the Windows 98 UI.\nThe menus, window edges \u2013 they began calling out to me like a siren\u2019s song.\n\nI grabbed a copy of Visual Studio and made some VB6 UIs. I may have made a\ncalculator app or something, but spent most of my time in the widget explorer\ndragging things onto the canvas.\n\nThe lack of gradient at the top of the window shows this actually Windows 95,\nbut bear with me.\n\nI revisited my old codepen to adjust the buttons. Then started playing around\nwith adding a dialog menubar. That quickly turned into pixel-matching the\nspacing of the buttons and the recreating the icons in Figma. I had my VM on\nmy left monitor, a text editor on my right, and successfully tricked myself\ninto writing computer programs again.\n\nThrow this CSS confirm dialog up next to one created with VB6 and you won\u2019t be\nable to tell which is which.\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 Finding joy again\n\nBuilding out 98.css is actually the least interesting part of this story. I\nhad an idea, wanted people to see it and use it, and coding was just the\nmedium for making that happen. This blog post won\u2019t dive into the details of\npublishing CSS, setting up CI, or the architecture that holds this house of\ncards together \u2013 simply put it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nWhat did matter was I did it because I liked doing it, and I hit git push at\nthe end.\n\nhttps://github.com/jdan/98.css/commits/main/?before=ffa29f4cd976543a2151c3868cecf07e1e074989+245\n\nThe part that is interesting however is how I \u2013 for the first time in about a\nyear \u2013 enjoyed programming again. I regained my focus, sitting for hours at a\ntime inspecting colors and spacing from a year old copy of Visual Studio on my\nleft, and turning into CSS with Visual Studio Code on my right. Using the\nentire 20+ year span of world-changing technology to put accurate pixels on a\nweb browser.\n\nI launched the only way I know how \u2013 tI regained my confidence \u2013 I was really\ngood at this.\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 What has transpired since\n\nI have a new job at Notion where I hack on text editors. It\u2019s a really good\ngig.\n\nSince launch I\u2019ve seen a number of high-quality 98.css deployments from games\n(1) (2), to portfolios, to all sorts of projects that benefit from a fun UI\nlibrary. Most recently 98.css was used on Krazam\u2019s new website, and people\nhave been loving the nostalgia kick \u2013 exactly the same nostalgia kick that got\nme into the mess.\n\n98.css has also since been forked to offer the look and feel of Windows XP and\nWindows 7, both incredibly high-quality works that I encourage you to try out.\n(Someone should do one for the Mac OS X Aqua UI, but that requires extensive\nuse of sprites).\n\nI no longer work on 98.css and I haven\u2019t in a really long time. My only\ncontribution to the project is monitoring the repo for high-quality pull\nrequests. If I get one, I briefly scan through the author\u2019s profile to make\nsure they\u2019re not going to mine cryptocurrency on my user\u2019s machines, and then\nI give them full commit access. \u201cLooks good, go ahead and merge this\nyourself!\u201d\n\nThis is a tip I picked up from my old colleague John Resig and it never ceases\nto amaze me. Some merge and move on with their lives. Some become contributors\nfor months or even years, shipping improvements, merging other PRs, and\ntending to the issues tab. It makes sense if you think about it: I have an\neager volunteer in front of me, someone who cares enough to write code and\noffer to contribute it back \u2013 why not take full advantage of that? People do\nincredibly things when you give them agency.\n\nEvery few weeks I search twitter for \u201c98.css\u201d and smile. Open source pays\ndividends and mine are in the form of \u201cI\u2019m really, really glad I built this.\u201d\n\n", "frontpage": false}
