Sadly, not everyone who purports to\nsupport Palestinians is truly interested in safeguarding our rights.\n\nIt pains me to say this as a Palestinian from Gaza. As my home is destroyed\nand too many killed, I never thought I would find myself criticizing those\nspeaking up. And yet, I cannot be silent about what I am seeing. The truth is\nthat the manner in which many gather to voice their support for Palestinians\ndoes more to hurt our cause than help it.\n\nYou know what would help the Palestinians in Gaza? Condemning Hamas'\natrocities. Instead, the protesters routinely chant their desire to \"Globalize\nthe Intifada.\" Apparently they do not realize that the Intifadas were\ndisastrous for both Palestinians and Israelis, just as October 7 has been\ndevastating for the people of Gaza.\n\nThey should be speaking up for the innocent victims of Hamas\u2014both Palestinian\nand Israeli. Instead, they endorse Hamas's ideology with posters announcing\nresistance \"by any means necessary\" and chants of \"from the river to the sea,\"\neffectively glorifying the Al-Qassam brigades, Hamas' military wing, whose\nideology is entirely based on the elimination of more than 6 million Israelis\nfrom the land.\n\nA person adjusts a scarf on their head as student demonstrators occupy the\npro-Palestinian \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" on the West Lawn of Columbia\nUniversity on April 24, in New York City.

I saw the LGBTQ flag frequently flown among people\nchanting lines from Hamas's charter, and I initially wanted to educate them,\nto warn them that the group they are honoring would most likely toss them from\nthe top of a building or murder them like they did to Mahmoud Ishtiwi, a Hamas\ncommander accused of homosexuality. Hamas harasses women who don't cover their\nheads. Hamas tortures those who demonstrate against their authoritarian rule,\nas they did me when I protested.\n\nNewsletter\n\nThe Bulletin\n\nYour Morning Starts Here\n\nBegin your day with a curated outlook of top news around the world and why it\nmatters.\n\nBy clicking on SIGN ME UP, you agree to Newsweek's Terms of Use & Privacy\nPolicy.

I've seen people yelling antisemitic things at\nJewish students, including \"Jews go back to Poland\" and other horrible\nphrases. It has deteriorated to the point that Jews are no longer attending\nuniversity classes due to the current hostile environment, and they are\nattending their classes online to avoid the demonstrators.\n\nExclusively Available to Subscribers Try it now for $1\n\nRead more\n\n  * Hezbollah flag at US college protest sparks fury\n  * My Fellow Gazans: We Must Demand the Release of the Israeli Hostages\n  * Hamas Tortured Me for Dissent. Here's What They Truly Think of Palestinians\n  * Chinese state media backs US college campus protesters: 'Justified'\n\nIt's unconscionable. But it's not just the antisemitism that has me\ndespairing. It's the hypocrisy. Where were these caring young people when\nHamas took over Gaza and slaughtered hundreds of Gazans, or when Hamas held 2\nmillion Gazans captive for more than 17 years? Why didn't they speak out about\nthe fact that Hamas led Gazans into this conflict, which resulted in more than\n30,000 dead and 80,000 injured, according to Gazan municipal authorities?\nWhere were they when Hamas's failed missiles claimed the lives of hundreds of\nGazans on October 17, or when Hamas murdered young people in order to steal\naid and resell it to Gazans at massively inflated prices?\n\nThe only conclusion that can be drawn from these demonstrators' silence\nconcerning Hamas' atrocities and their antisemitic chanting is that they are\nnot concerned with protecting Palestinians. They are out in their tents\nbecause of a hatred of Jews and Israelis.\n\nAs a Gazan and as a Palestinian, I want the protesters and the organizers of\nthese protests to know that their hateful speech harms us. The Jewish person\nor Israeli you are intimidating during your rally may be the granddaughter of\na Holocaust survivor or a family member of an Israeli slain or abducted by\nHamas on October 7. These folks would be your partners if the protests were\nabout achieving lasting peace and justice for Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nI do not accept hateful speech or terrorist chants, and all of these foolish\ndreams about eradicating Israel are disgusting\u2014and will never be achieved.\nBoth of us\u2014Palestinians and Israelis\u2014are here to stay.\n\nBut the protesters aren't interested in peace. Some of the groups have been\nblocking Palestinian peace activists like me\u2014and I am from Gaza, the very\nplace they claim to care about! Instead of blocking peace activists, they\nshould be inviting us to join these protests and guide them in the right\ndirection\u2014a place without hatred with a focus on calling for the release of\nthe hostages who have been held captive by Hamas for more than 210 days.\n\nIf the protesters cared about Palestinians, they would have one central\ndemand: Hamas must surrender, because we have all suffered from Hamas and can\nno longer live under the rule of a terrorist group. Only then can a ceasefire\nbe achieved.\n\nHamza Howidy is a Palestinian from Gaza City.
