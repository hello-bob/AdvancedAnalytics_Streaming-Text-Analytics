Like so many technologies, though, GM was well ahead of the curve. It\nhad Oldsmobile putting screens in cars all the way back in the 1980s.\nAmazingly, some of these ancient units live on to this day, thanks in part to\nthe efforts of one dedicated Oldsmobile fan.\n\nThe Visual Information Center (VIC) was a brand-new feature for the 1989\nOldsmobile Toronado. The color touchscreen CRT was mounted in the center of\nthe dash, with controls for the radio, HVAC system, and trip computer. It even\nhad a compass, among other features! It could also control the integrated car\nphone, because those were a big deal in the decade before cell phones really\ntook off. It wasn\u2019t the first infotainment system from GM, but it followed\nshortly after the Graphic Control Center that the company threw on the Buick\nRiviera back in 1986.\n\n2025 Toyota 4Runner Walkaround\n\nThese old displays are dripping in retro charm, and they\u2019re a key part of what\nmakes these cars special. Keeping these old electronics humming along is no\nmean feat, and there are precious few qualified to do it. When he could find\nnobody else to help, Jon Morlan decided that he would shoulder this sage duty\nhimself.\n\nThe VIC wasn\u2019t huge, but it previewed the infotainment screens that would\nbecome the norm in decades to come.Hitting the market in 1989, it looked\nsharper than a lot of newer infotainment systems that came out over the next\ntwo decades.\n\n## Electronics Wizard\n\nJon\u2019s journey with the VIC started because of a personal connection. \u201cAs an\nowner of a 1991 Oldsmobile Trofeo myself, I had my own VIC fail on me many\nyears ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI was backing my car out of the garage and heard a short\nhigh-pitched squeal and the VIC had a bright line across the screen.\u201d\nResearching the problem, he found out this was called a \u201cvertical collapse,\u201d\nand he set about finding someone to repair the unit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA long search found him a willing helper at a TV repair shop. The gentleman\nthought he had the problem licked, but wasn\u2019t able to test the repair without\nthe car on hand. Picking up the unit, Jon dropped it back into his car and\nfound it was operating perfectly well once more. Over the years, Jon funneled\nother Oldsmobile owners towards the same shop, until the man eventually\nretired some years later.\n\n\u201cVertical collapse\u201d is a problem on CRTs where the vertical scan of the screen\nis non-functional. Instead, the electron beams just get fired in a flat line.\nIf horizontal deflection also fails, you get a dot.The 6\u2032\u2032 Trinitron cathode\nray tube serves as the VIC\u2019s display. They\u2019re reliable units with crisp\noutput, but they suffer from various failure modes after 30 years in service.\nThankfully, they\u2019re often repairable.\n\nThe owner of the repair shop eventually inspired him to take on the work\nhimself. \u201cHe told me that \u2018if you can become proficient with electronics\nrepair you could do these yourself,'\u201d Jon explains. \u201cThe key thing is that you\nhave to be able to test your repairs.\u201d This was impractical for the TV shop to\nhandle, as the only way to test the VIC unit properly was to plug it into the\ncar\u2019s harness.\n\nBy this point, Jon knew that failing VICs were a fairly common problem among\nToronado and Trofeo owners. He elected to teach himself the basics needed to\nrepair these units and their tiny 6\u2032\u2032 Sony Trinitron CRT displays. Resources\nspecific to the VIC weren\u2019t out there, so Jon looked further afield. \u201cI read\nevery Trinitron repair manual I could get my hands on, watched YouTube videos\non TV and arcade game repair, visited TV museums local to me,\u201d said Jon.\n\nVIC units suffer from a number of common maladies now that they\u2019re cresting\ntheir thirtieth birthdays. Loss of picture, the aforementioned vertical\ncollapse, and a total loss of power are typical symptoms. Often, these units\ncan be fixed, but Jon always seeks to manage expectations for prospective\ncustomers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSometimes, a few failing components can cause problems elsewhere, damaging\nunobtainable parts. \u201cAll of this stuff is considered obsolete,\u201d says Jon. \u201cI\nhave been fortunate to find new old stock components from time to time, but in\ngeneral parts are very hard to come by.\u201d\n\nA VIC that looks so good it\u2019s like it just came out of the factory. And yes,\nthat is a graphic equalizer. Because that mattered to us in the 1990s, for\nsome reason.\n\nHe took on this work without support from the original manufacturers, or even\nbasic documentation. He has no schematics or service manuals. He\u2019s begged Sony\nfor information on the VIC, given it uses a Trinitron-style display, but to no\navail. In lieu of documentation, he\u2019s learned to fix these units with his own\nanalytical skills instead.\n\nThankfully, common passive supporting components like capacitors are readily\navailable and easily replaced. The worst cases involve damage to the CRT tube\nitself, such as failing electron guns. In this case, a display transplant is\nthe only cure, assuming one can be sourced from another unit.\n\nThe VIC controls the air conditioning, the audio system, and the car phone as\nwell, where fitted. If it stops working, it\u2019s not just a minor inconvenience.\n\n## A Good Rig\n\nAfter successfully repairing a handful of VIC units for other owners, Jon\nrealized he really did need a better testing setup. That\u2019s what inspired him\nto create a benchtop unit that could sit in for the car side of things. With\nthis setup, he\u2019s able to plug in a VIC unit and test all its features,\ncovering every button, every function, and the touch screen to boot. He\u2019s also\nable to monitor the current draw of the unit, which can help diagnose if\nsomething\u2019s wrong internally or if a component is leaning toward imminent\nfailure.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJim built a set of desktop test tools fondly known as as the \u201cTrofeo in a\nBox.\u201d This allows him to bench test a unit without having to mess around\ninstalling it in an actual car.\n\nJon\u2019s always on the hunt for spare parts to support his work, but he doesn\u2019t\nsell parts or whole working units himself. For those eager to purchase a\nworking VIC, he strongly recommends the services of his close friend, David\nNorth. Not to be confused with the David North who designed the first\nToronado, this David North is the man behind TrofeoParts.com. Jon jokes that\nthere\u2019s a common saying around the Trofeo community these days. \u201cIf you need\nparts or want an entire car, call David,\u201d he says. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have it, he\ncan get it, if he can\u2019t get it, it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nHe notes that his role comes down largely to economics. \u201cBusinesses that do\nnothing but automotive electronics don\u2019t want to touch anything 30 years old,\u201d\nhe says.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a money maker for a large business\u2019s bottom line.\u201d Like so\nmany obscure cars, ongoing support comes down to dedicated community members.\n\u201cIt\u2019s left to Trofeo nuts like myself and David to keep these cars alive for\neveryone,\u201d he says.\n\nFailures in old electronics are commonly caused when electrolytic capacitors\nleak or dry out. Repair (or preventative maintenance) is often as simple as\nreplacing them.\n\n## The Digital Dash\n\nThe VIC has very basic graphics by today\u2019s standards. However, it perfectly\nmatched the style of the Oldsmobiles of the time, sitting neatly alongside the\ndigital gauge clusters that were so hot in the late 1980s. To that end, Jon\ndoesn\u2019t just spend his time fixing up old VICs. He\u2019s also learned how to\nrepair and maintain the futuristic clusters, too. Much of his work involves\nrepairing damaged traces on circuit boards, swapping out old capacitors, and\ncleaning scratches off of the cover lenses.\n\nJon often recommends preventative maintenance to avoid cascade failures that\ncan render a unit unrepairable. This is true for the VIC, as with just about\nany electronics from the 1980s. But it\u2019s especially relevant to the digital\ngauge clusters manufactured by Yazaki. \u201cProactive restoration on these units\nand replacing those 30-year-old components can stop a cascade failure from\noccurring,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce it happens, you will have a speedometer that is\ndead and cannot be repaired.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThese unique displays were only around for a few years, featured in the\nrefreshed Toronado and Trofeo line. \u201cOnly 19 thousand of these [facelift] cars\nwere actually made,\u201d he says. \u201cI would gather that only a third of them had\nthe VIC option, but every single one had a speedometer.\u201d To that end, Jon\nfinds himself repairing a lot more digital dashes these days than VIC units,\nbut it\u2019s all in support of the same cause.\n\nHe also jokes that perhaps the Toronado took things a little too far forward\nfor the brand\u2019s existing customer base. \u201cIt was also so ahead of its time,\nmany generational Oldsmobile buyers were turned off by all of the futuristic\ntechnology,\u201d he jokes.\n\n## Obscurity\n\nGM killed off the Toronado in 1992, probably after finally admitting they\nshould have called it the Tornado all along. That saw the end of the VIC,\nthough it had a final hurrah as the basis for the TravTek GPS system that was\nkilled off in 1993.\n\nThere aren\u2019t a whole lot of Toronados and Trofeos left on the road today. Even\nfewer have VIC systems in the dash. It\u2019s perhaps the coolest feature of the\nmodel, though, and one that previewed the future direction of automotive\ninterior design by over a decade. It\u2019s neat to know that the VIC will live on\nfor some time in fully functional condition, thanks to the efforts of people\nlike Jon Morlan and David North.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thrill for me each time I work on just a small part of the car,\u201d says\nJim. \u201cSomeday long after I\u2019m gone, someone could pull out a VIC or cluster\nthat I\u2019ve restored and see my own signature on it.\u201d It\u2019s a legacy worth\ncelebrating. Hats off to Jon, and all those like him that are keeping rare\nautomotive relics alive.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nImage credits: Jon Morlan, GM\n\n  * BigFeatured, History, infotainment, Oldsmobile, retro, vic\n\nShare on facebook\n\nFacebook\n\nShare on whatsapp\n\nWhatsApp\n\nShare on twitter\n\nTwitter\n\nShare on linkedin\n\nLinkedIn\n\nShare on reddit\n\nReddit\n\n#### Lewin Day\n\nA madcap engineer who loves a good montage.

Same era electronics, same crt technology (obvs bigger).\n\nSo if you need this and these guys can\u2019t help that\u2019s a good place to look.\n\n0\n\nUnseenCat\n\n7 minutes ago\n\nObligatory callout, again, to just how good GM\u2019s engineering department was\nwhen they were given the money and left alone to do their jobs the way they\nwanted to.\n\nThat\u2019s a touchscreen-plus-physical-buttons interface that looks like it\u2019s\nactually useful. Key functions are still on nice, big, easy-to-find buttons\nand the touchscreen pages are kept simple with easy-to find touch targets\nspread out on the screen. As if it were intended to be used by humans who\ndidn\u2019t want to take their eyes off the road for too long, if at all. Imagine\nthat. It\u2019s not much different from working a radio or casette/cd player in a\ncar, and yet it can neatly handle most if not all infotainment functions.\n(Before \u201cinfotainment\u201d was even a word.)\n\nCan we send some modern infotainment UI designers over to see one of these\nthings in action so they can learn a few things about a useable UI, please?\n\n0\n\nBen\n\n28 minutes ago\n\nI\u2019ve done a little electronics repair (like replacing a damaged USB port) over\nthe years, but it\u2019s a youknowwhat-show every time, so I have huge respect for\npeople who do this kind of work.\n\n0\n\nJTilla\n\n2 hours ago\n\nThere is a guy in the Subaru and Evo world who does this kind of reverse\nengineering to convert km to miles for swaps and such. He has a crazy setup to\nallow it to happen and can even match the mileage on the digital portion of\nthe gauge to your vehicles mileage. Pretty damn cool.\n\n1\n\nBlack Peter\n\n1 minute ago\n\nReply to JTilla\n\nhuh, I did not know that..

I love to see someone try to get\nsomething fixed, finding nobody really does it, so learning to do it\nthemselves. I wonder if it would be a good idea to try to convert it to a\nmodern touchscreen, though that will probably have to be done at some point if\nthey\u2019re to be continued to be used (I have no idea how that would be\ntranslated or anything).\n\n2\n\nFuzzyweis\n\n2 hours ago\n\nI feel like GM should add some of these digital display styles as options on\nthe new cluster screens like Ford\u2019s doing with the Mustangs.\n\nKudos to these guys for keeping the originals alive, underneath that dash\npanel reminds me of my old Colecos I may have accidentally dismantled one\ntime, good memories.\n\n2\n\nMatt Gasper\n\n2 hours ago\n\nDoes he do Reattas? It\u2019s fascinating that there\u2019s a cottage industry for this\ngiven how few of these Toronado Trofeos seem to still exist. I have a 2011 9-5\nand we have a similar small number of niche providers doing very specific\nfixes. I\u2019ve had the car for three years and it\u2019s been interesting seeing\nvendors come and go with their projects, as well as seeing the projects from a\nfew years ago that are no longer available.\n\n1\n\nF.Y.

What a great skill to develop.\n\nI remember the first time I sat in one of those Trofeos, it was brought into\nthe shop to repaint a fender that had been keyed at a sporting event. Up until\nthen I was still planted pretty firmly in the \u201cthey don\u2019t build them like they\nused to\u201d and \u201ccars can\u2019t have cOmPOOters\u201d camp.\n\nSitting in the Trofeo was an experience \u2013 the owner had obviously driven it a\ngreat deal yet kept it quite clean \u2013 I was amazed to see the odometer showing\n195,000 miles. Those screens made everything feel like the future, yet here\nthey were, functioning just fine in a car with more miles than I had ever seen\nor driven at that point.\n\nIt was one of those early moments when I started realizing the \u201celders\u201d maybe\ndidn\u2019t always know what they were talking about.\n\n1\n\nFrontWillDrive\n\n3 hours ago\n\nI always wanted a Trofeo, with or without VIC, it\u2019s awesome to see people\nhelping keep them alive electronically. I have a 91 Riviera, there\u2019s no CRT\nbut it has the facelifted full instrument digital-analog gauges with a vehicle\ndiagnostic mode, all of which I managed to keep functional when I swapped in a\nseries 2 supercharged 3800. The E body is sort of it\u2019s own thing as far as fwd\nGM cars from that era go, but I think that helps them still feel unique today.\n\nIt would be really cool to find a Toro with Navi and a car phone, and set the\nphone up to be a bluetooth unit that pairs with a modern phone, add bluetooth\nmusic playback to the radio and I\u2019d be a happy camper.\n\n1\n\nLTDScott\n\n3 hours ago\n\nI love reading stories of people like this, dedicated to learning new skills\nto keep some arcane technology alive despite no support from manufacturers.\n\n1\n\nShop-Teacher\n\n3 hours ago\n\nMy first car was an \u201989 Trofeo, midnight blue with a matching interior, that\nthankfully did not have a CRT infotainment. That car was already far enough\nahead of it\u2019s time to be problematic. But now I\u2019m far enough removed from the\nproblems, to put the rose colored glasses of nostalgia on, and want another\none.\n\nThis time it will have to be one that is NOT equipped with the problematic\nearly ABS systems that when they failed, you lost most of your braking power,\nand even 20 years ago nobody could fix them.\n\nI also don\u2019t want one with the CRT, but it\u2019s great to know there is somebody\nthat can fix the ultra cool digital dash!\n\n1\n\nRusty S Trusty\n\n3 hours ago\n\nI wonder if the digital gauge clusters were the same as the ones in Cadillacs\nfrom that era.
