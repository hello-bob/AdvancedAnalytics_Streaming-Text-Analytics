Their findings were presented in an illustrated book,\nOccult Chemistry, first published in 1908, although their investigative\nproject continued for many more years, with subsequent editions appearing into\nthe 1930s. \u201cThe atom can scarcely be said to be a \u2018thing\u2019, though it is the\nmaterial out of which all things physical are composed\u201d, they concluded. \u201cIt\nis formed by the flow of the life-force and vanishes with its ebb.\u201d This is,\nto say the least, an unorthodox view of chemistry, which is in some ways the\nleast mysterious of sciences.\n\nBesant was born in 1847. Around 1871, she rejected her previously devout\nChristianity, separated from her clergyman husband, became a freethinker,\nmatriculated for a science degree at London University, but did not take it,\nadvocated for birth control, and then joined the Fabians. In 1888, she turned\nto theosophy, moved to India, translated the Bhagavad Gita, and joined the\nIndian National Congress and the campaign for Indian self-government.\nTheosophy began as a late Victorian spiritualist movement which held that the\nnature of things is deeper than can be discovered by empirical science. In\nBesant\u2019s own definition, \u201cIt is the fact that man, being himself divine, can\nknow the Divinity whose life he shares.\u201d\n\nLeadbeater, born in 1854, turned to theosophy having served as an Anglican\npriest and became a prolific author of the movement\u2019s books and pamphlets. The\nOxford Dictionary of National Biography describes him as \u201can observant\ntraveller on the astral plane\u201d. He met Besant in 1894, and the two began their\nchemical observations almost immediately. Leadbeater used his clairvoyant\ntalents, while Besant, with her scientific inclination, made sure that they\nfollowed a respectable methodology. Their first book together, though, was a\npsychological exploration called Thought-Forms (1901), which depicted\nexperiences and feelings, such as varieties of love and anger, in coloured\ndiagrams resembling abstract art.\n\nTheir chemical method was \u2014 conveniently perhaps \u2014 \u201cunique and difficult to\nexplain\u201d. Its clairvoyant aspect was based on a Yoga principle that one can\nreduce one\u2019s self-conception to minute proportions so that very small objects\nappear large. The observer then simply draws what he sees on paper and his\ncommentary may be taken down by a stenographer. It is much like somebody using\na microscope and, in the view of its adherents, no less objective. Transcripts\nof the dialogue between Leadbeater and their illustrator, Curuppumullage\nJinarajadasa, which were included in Occult Chemistry, display admirable\nfrankness during these observation sessions, but do not really explain much\nmore.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nBesant and Leadbeater\u2019s investigations in Occult Chemistry begin with \u201cfour\ngases in the air\u201d \u2014 hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and \u201ca fourth gas (atomic\nweight=3) so far not discovered by chemists.\u201d These were the simplest\nelements. As the atomic number increased, so did their geometric complexity of\nthe atoms. Sodium, for example, was \u201ccomposed of an upper part, divisible into\na globe and 12 funnels, a lower part, similarly divided; and a connecting\nrod.\u201d The atoms were duly grouped, not as in the periodic table (which is\norganized according to atomic number and reveals different elements\u2019 related\nchemical properties), but according to overall shapes: spikes, dumbbell,\ntetrahedron, cube, octahedron, crossed bases, and star. Thus, boron, nitrogen,\nand vanadium, for example \u2014 elements with little in common chemically \u2014 all\n\u201chave six funnels opening on the six faces of a cube\u201d.\n\nEven the simplest element, hydrogen, was found to comprise eighteen units,\nwhich they called anu, in reference to the indivisible in Jain metaphysics. As\nthe work progressed, Besant and Leadbeater \u201cfound\u201d new elements, such as\n\u201cmeta-neon\u201d and \u201cplatinum A\u201d with positions intermediate between the\nestablished elements, and began to include simple compounds such as copper\nsulphate and benzene. In water, \u201cThe Oxygen double snake retains its\nindividuality, as indeed it usually does, while the two Hydrogen atoms arrange\nthemselves around it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Besant\u2019s and Leadbeater\u2019s science is clearly misguided, their\ninterest was obviously sincere, and their labour fairly exhaustive. At a time\nwhen there was no other means of \u201cseeing\u201d atoms, what is truly remarkable is\nthat their visualizations so closely resemble those developed later by\nchemists relying on Niels Bohr\u2019s theory of atomic structure from 1913 and laws\nof quantum mechanics not worked out until the 1920s. The cloudlike volumes\nknown as atomic orbitals within which the electrons of an atom may circulate\naround its nucleus are today visualized as fuzzy-edged spheres, dumbbells and\ndoughnut rings.\n\nText by Hugh Aldersey-Williams\n\nMedium\n\n  * Books\n\nTheme\n\n  * Science & Medicine\n  * Ghosts & Occult\n\nStyle\n\n  * Illustrations\n\nEpoch\n\n  * 20th Century\n\nTags\n\nchemistry5occult32science10theosophy5\n\nSource| Wellcome Collection  \n---|---  \n  \n  * More Wellcome Collection content on PDR (40)\n\nUnderlying Work Rights| PD Worldwide  \n---|---  \nDigital Copy Rights| No Additional Rights\n\n  * Labelled Public Domain Mark by source\n  * We offer this info as guidance only\n\n  \nDownload| PDF  \n  \nPublished\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nRelated Collections\n\nImages /\n\nGhosts & Occult\n\nThe Key of Hell: an 18th-Century Manual on Black Magic\n\nBooks /\n\nScience & Medicine\n\nFirst Paper to Link CO2 and Global Warming, by Eunice Foote (1856)\n\nImages /\n\nGhosts & Occult\n\nHokusai\u2019s Ghost Stories (ca. 1830)\n\nBooks /\n\nAnimals & Beasts, Ghosts & Occult, Strange Phenomena\n\nFearful Symmetry: Inkblot Books (1857\u20131915)\n\nBooks /\n\nGhosts & Occult, Novelty, Strange Phenomena, Victorian\n\nHieroglyphics of a Rope-Dancer: The Book of Fate (1822)\n\nImages /\n\nAnimals & Beasts, Ghosts & Occult, Religion, Myth & Legend\n\nClavis Artis by \u201cZoroaster\u201d\n\nBooks /\n\nCustoms & Culture, Religion, Myth & Legend\n\nCultus Arborum: A Descriptive Account of Phallic Tree Worship (1890)\n\nImages /\n\nGhosts & Occult, Religion, Myth & Legend\n\nA Hall of Mirrors: Cabala, Spiegel Der Kunst Und Natur, In Alchymia (1615)\n\nIf You Liked This...\n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nOur latest content, your inbox, every fortnight\n\nPrivacy Policy More Info\n\nBecome a Friend of the PDRWe rely on our annual donors to keep the project\nalive.
