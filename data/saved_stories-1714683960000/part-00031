Swedish uses the interval\ndash for that although I hate that and sometimes use the English style. \u2212 is a\nminus sign. Sometimes set a li\u2019l higher up. \u2012 is a figure dash for separating\nphone numbers like 555\u20121234. \u2015 is a horizontal bar, great for dialogs in\nnovel, in front of each statement instead of quote signs around. It\u2019s a\nEuropean style unusual in English text but I love this style, I find it easier\nto read and understand.\n\nThere\u2019s also the - sign which is ASCII clean and I think of it as a\n\u201ctypewriter dash\u201d. It can be used as a hyphen or as a minus. For programming\napps like dc or bc or many programming REPLs, this is what you have to use for\nthem.\n\nMy writing style also uses plenty of newfounded contractions and there I mix\nin interval dashes with typewriter dashes so that the typewriter dashes are\nmore tightly binding, higher operator precedence. (Now I\u2019m thinking I maybe\nshould use real hyphens instead of typewriter dashes.) For example I might\nwrite \u201cextra-large\u2013pizza\u2013order\u201d since the \u201cextra\u201d is supposed to tightly bind\nto the \u201clarge\u201d. I only do this when I need two layers of precedence; otherwise\nI use all typewriter dashes. I also like using the interval dashes when one of\nthe parts is a phrase with spaces.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
