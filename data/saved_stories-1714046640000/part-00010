Urbonas, who has experience as an amusement park employee,\nstated that the goal of his concept roller coaster is to take lives \"with\nelegance and euphoria\".^[2] As for practical applications of his design,\nUrbonas mentioned \"euthanasia\" or \"execution\".^[3] John Allen, who served as\npresident of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, inspired Urbonas with his\ndescription of the \"ultimate\" roller coaster as one that \"sends out 24 people\nand they all come back dead\".^[4]\n\n## Design[edit]\n\nThe concept design of the layout begins with a steep-angled lift that takes\nriders up 500 metres (1,600 ft) to the top,^[1] a climb which would take a few\nminutes to complete allowing the user to contemplate their life.^[5]^[3] For\ncomparison, the tallest roller coaster in the world is Kingda Ka at 139 m (456\nft). From there, the user may exit the coaster. If they do not, they would\nhave some time to say their last words and press a button to continue^[5] to a\n500 m (1,600 ft) drop which would take the train to 360 kilometres per hour\n(220 mph; 100 m/s), close to its terminal velocity, before flattening out and\nspeeding into the first of its seven slightly clothoid inversions.^[3] Each\ninversion would be of a smaller diameter than the last to maintain the lethal\n10 G's of force onto passengers as the train loses speed. After a sharp right-\nhand turn, the train would enter a straight track that goes back to the\nstation, where the dead are unloaded and new passengers can board.^[3]\n\n## Mechanism of action[edit]\n\nUrbonas (left) and Euthanasia Coaster at HUMAN+ display at the Science Gallery\nin Dublin\n\nThe Euthanasia Coaster would kill its passengers through prolonged cerebral\nhypoxia, or insufficient supply of oxygen to the brain.^[1] The ride's seven\ninversions would inflict 10 g (g-force) on its passengers for 60 seconds,\ncausing g-force related symptoms starting with greyout through tunnel vision\nto black out, g-LOC (g-force induced loss of consciousness) and eventually\ndeath.^[3] Subsequent inversions or a second run of the rollercoaster would\nserve as insurance against unintentional survival of more robust\npassengers.^[3]\n\n## Exhibition[edit]\n\nThe Euthanasia Coaster was first shown as part of the HUMAN+ display at the\nScience Gallery in Dublin in 2011.^[1] The display was later named the year's\nflagship exhibition by the Science Gallery,^[6]^[7] Within this theme, the\ncoaster highlights the issues that come with life extension.^[8] The item was\nalso displayed at the HUMAN+ exhibit at Centre de Cultura Contempor\u00e0nia de\nBarcelona in 2015.^[9]\n\n## In pop culture[edit]\n\nIn 2012, Norwegian rock group Major Parkinson released \"Euthanasia Roller\nCoaster\", a digital single with lyrics alluding to Urbonas's Euthanasia\nCoaster.^[10]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d Solon, Olivia (6 April 2011). \"The Future of the Human Species Explored\".
