And humility is probably not the word that comes to\nmind.\n\nHowever, Belfort\u2019s rise was followed by a fall (he ended up in jail). For\nthose who want to reach the top and stay there, it may be best to stay humble.\n\nHumble leaders express their humility in three dimensions. They view\nthemselves accurately and acknowledge their limitations. They show\nappreciation for their followers\u2019 contributions. They are also open to ideas\nand feedback. When leaders show all three attributes, they are considered to\nbe humble.\n\nSo how can humility help those who want to reach the top? We studied how\nhumble leaders can become more promotable and found that they accomplish that\nby growing others in what is known as a \u201chumility route\u201d.\n\nHuman capital theory suggests that employees\u2019 value can be enhanced by\ninvesting in their knowledge, skills and abilities. It\u2019s not only important\nfor employees, it also creates value for organisations.\n\nUsing human capital theory, our research shows that humble leaders focus on\nthe learning and growth of their followers. By doing so, they also create\nhuman capital value for themselves in the process.\n\nHumble leaders tend to engage in more informal mentoring, and through that\nthey gain influence and power in terms of promotability. They provide career\nguidance to their proteges and help them to prosper.\n\nBut at the same time, their engagement in learning also boosts their own human\ncapital. In such a developmental relationship, humble leaders gain respect,\nprestige and prominence, and they gather a group of followers with high human\ncapital.\n\nThis enhances their status in the organisation. It\u2019s a win-win for leaders,\ntheir followers and the organisations they work for.\n\nOur study used survey data from a sample of 610 leaders who worked in 18\nindustries and across 21 job functions. The leaders\u2019 direct followers, peers,\nimmediate bosses and superiors reported back on the leaders.\n\nThe measures in the survey included the leader\u2019s humility, informal mentoring,\nstatus and promotability. We found that humble leaders earn higher status and\nenhanced promotability through engaging in mentoring behaviours.\n\nSo if you want to be more promotable, it may pay to stay humble.\n\n## A more sustainable path to the top\n\nBut why are some leaders so arrogant if there is a \u201chumility route\u201d to\nsuccess? A great deal of evidence shows that humble leaders outperform\narrogant leaders. And yet, many leaders at every level have a hard time\nadmitting mistakes, praising followers\u2019 strengths and being teachable.\n\nThe arrogant, narcissistic, bullying and dominating Wolf of Wall Street\nstereotype may be the most common and immediate route to the top. After all,\nthis sort of behaviour can lead to quick wins which are are easily noticed and\nglamorised, reinforcing the stereotype in popular culture and media.\n\nBut while this path can offer short-term gains, it often lacks stability. Even\nthe famed Renaissance Italian political theorist Niccolo Machiavelli \u2013 a well-\nknown figure of dominance strategy \u2013 ended up being tortured, imprisoned and\nthen exiled.\n\nIn contrast, humility offers a more stable and less visible route to success.\nHumble leaders typically achieve their status through fostering growth in\nothers, engaging in mentoring, and creating a network of highly capable, loyal\nand enthusiastic followers.\n\nThe Machiavellian route to the top can be rapid, but it doesn\u2019t always bring\nstable leadership. Shutterstock\n\nThis network in turn provides the humble leader with high status, leading to\nthem being viewed favourably by superiors. But such an approach may not grab\nattention or fit the dramatic narratives preferred by media, making it less\nvisible to the public.\n\nThe key difference lies in the nature of success each approach brings.\nDominance may lead to a rapid ascent but is often accompanied by volatility.\n\nHumility, on the other hand, cultivates a foundation of strong relationships\nand a positive reputation, leading to a more stable and enduring success. This\nexplains why the Wolf of Wall Street stereotype persists, despite the proven\nbenefits of humility in achieving long-term leadership success.\n\n## How to foster humility\n\nExpressing humility helps leaders earn career success as they increase human\ncapital, which is vital to organisations. In recent years there has been a\ngrowing interest in humility in the workplace, particularly among leaders.\nIt\u2019s time to re-evaluate perceptions about the value of humility in\nleadership.\n\nYou can show more humility as you lead. You can evaluate your own limitations\nand be sensitive to them. You can try to admit them by saying, \u201cThis is\nsomething I could do better.\u201d\n\nYou can also put your focus on the followers, acknowledge what they have done\nwell and give them positive feedback. You can also be more open to feedback\nyourself and consider your followers\u2019 ideas more.\n\nThere are a few ways that organisations can cultivate humility. They can build\nthe perception that expressing humility is valued. They can also organise\ntraining programmes that develop humility in leaders and consider including\nhumility as part of performance evaluations.\n\nAnd lastly, they can encourage feedback on humble behaviours, promote informal\nmentoring and foster a culture of humility that centres on learning. That way,\nthey can develop groups of employees who focus on the \u201chumility route\u201d to\ncareer success.\n\n  * Employment\n  * Management\n  * Careers\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\n  * ##### Research Fellow /Senior Research Fellow \u2013 Implementation Science\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\n  * ##### GRAINS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CHAIRPERSON\n\n  * ##### Faculty of Law - Academic Appointment Opportunities\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
