A man with two watches is never\n> sure.^[1]\n\nAt surface level, the adage emphasizes the consistency that arises when\ninformation comes from a single source and points out the potential pitfalls\nof having too much conflicting information. However, the underlying message is\nto question the apparent certainty of anyone who only has one source of\ninformation. The man with one watch has no way to identify error or\nuncertainty.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe saying was coined by the San Diego Union on September 20, 1930:\n\"Confusion.\u2014Retail jewelers assert that every man should carry two watches.\nBut a man with one watch knows what time it is, and a man with two watches\ncould never be sure.\" Later this was \u2014 mistakenly \u2014 attributed to Lee Segall\nof KIXL, then to be misquoted again by Arthur Bloch as \"Segal's Law\".^[2]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of chronometers on HMS Beagle\n  * The four-faced liar\n  * Triple modular redundancy in chronometers\n  * wikt:a stopped clock is right twice a day\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Bloch, Arthur (2003).
