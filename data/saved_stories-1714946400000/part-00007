Kagan with Kateryna Stepanenko\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nRussia cannot defeat Ukraine or the West - and will likely lose - if the West\nmobilizes its resources to resist the Kremlin. The West\u2019s existing and latent\ncapability dwarfs that of Russia. The combined gross domestic product (GDP) of\nNATO countries, non-NATO European Union states, and our Asian allies is over\n$63 trillion.[1] The Russian GDP is on the close order of $1.9 trillion.[2]\nIran and North Korea add little in terms of materiel support. China is\nenabling Russia, but it is not mobilized on behalf of Russia and is unlikely\nto do so.[3] If we lean in and surge, Russia loses.\n\nThe notion that the war is unwinnable because of Russia\u2019s dominance is a\nRussian information operation, which gives us a glimpse of the Kremlin\u2019s real\nstrategy and only real hope of success. The Kremlin must get the United States\nto the sidelines, allowing Russia to fight Ukraine in isolation and then\nproceed to Moscow\u2019s next targets, which Russia will also seek to isolate. The\nKremlin needs the United States to choose inaction and embrace the false\ninevitability that Russia will prevail in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin\u2019s center of\ngravity is his ability to shape the will and decisions of the West, Ukraine,\nand Russia itself. The Russian strategy that matters most, therefore, is not\nMoscow\u2019s warfighting strategy, but rather the Kremlin\u2019s strategy to cause us\nto see the world as it wishes us to see it and make decisions in that Kremlin-\ngenerated alternative reality that will allow Russia to win in the real world.\n\nThose whose perspective aligns with the Kremlin\u2019s are not ipso facto Russian\ndupes. The Kremlin links genuine sentiment and even some legitimate arguments\nto Russia\u2019s interests in public debate. The Kremlin is also an equal\nopportunity manipulator. It targets the full spectrum of those making or\ninforming decisions. It partially succeeds on every side of the political\nspectrum. Perception manipulation is one of the Kremlin\u2019s core capabilities \u2014\nnow unleashed with full force onto the Western public as the Kremlin\u2019s only\nstrategy for winning in Ukraine.[4] That is not a challenge most societies are\nequipped to contend with.\n\nThe United States has the power to deny Russia its only strategy for success,\nnevertheless. The United States has allowed Russia to play an outsized role in\nshaping American decision-making, but the United States has also made many\nsound choices regarding Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.[5] The key successes achieved\nby Ukraine and its partners in this war have resulted from strategic\nclarity.[6] Lost opportunities on the battlefield, on the other hand, have\nresulted from the West\u2019s failure to connect ground truths to our interests\nquickly enough to act.[7] Fortunately, the United States faces an easier task\nin overcoming the Kremlin's manipulations than Russia does in closing the\nmassive gap between Russia's war aims and its capabilities. The United States\nmust surge its support to Ukraine, and it must do so in time. Delays come at\nthe cost of Ukrainian lives, increased risk of failure in Ukraine, and the\nerosion of the US advantage over Russia, granting the Kremlin time to rebuild\nand develop capabilities that it intends to use against the West \u2014 likely on a\nshorter timeline than the West assesses.[8]\n\nThe United States must defeat Russia\u2019s efforts to alter American will and\ndecision-making for reasons that transcend Ukraine. For the United States to\ndeter, win, or help win any future war, US decisions must be timely, connected\nto our interests, values, and ground truth, but above all \u2013 these decisions\nmust be ours. The US national security community theorizes a lot about the\nimportance of US decision advantage over our adversaries, including\ntimeliness. Russia presents an urgent and real-world requirement for America\nto do so in practice.\n\nI. The Kremlin\u2019s Strategy\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s principal effort is to force the United States to accept and\nreason from Russian premises to decisions that advance Russia\u2019s interests, not\nours. The Kremlin is not arguing with us. It is trying to enforce assertions\nabout Russia\u2019s manufactured portrayal of reality as the basis for our own\ndiscussions, and then allow us to reason to conclusions pre-determined by the\nKremlin. Accepting Russia\u2019s premises and reasoning from them may proceed in a\nformally logical way but is certainly not rational, since it is divorced from\nactual reality and from our interests. Soviet mathematician Vladimir Lefebvre\ndefined this process as \u201creflexive control\u201d\u2013 a way of transmitting bases for\ndecision making to an opponent so that they freely come to a pre-determined\ndecision.[9] A key example: Putin takes the false assertion that discussions\nof Ukraine\u2019s NATO accession posed a clear and imminent danger to Russia along\nwith the false assertion that Ukraine is not a real country and builds them\ninto a false conclusion that he was justified in launching a war of\nconquest.[10] Another assertion: Russia has the right to a self-defined sphere\nof influence, and, therefore, a right to do whatever it wants to those within\nthis sphere \u2013 including invading, killing, raping, and ethnic cleansing \u2013 with\nno repercussions.[11] The degree to which Western discourse includes serious\nconsideration of these falsehoods marks the success of long-running Russian\ninformation operations.\n\nSome sincerely accept the Kremlin\u2019s false predicates and resulting\nconclusions. Others may accept the predicates but stop short of leaping to\nconclusions that any of these arguments justify the Kremlin\u2019s invasion and\natrocities. Many can see past the Kremlin\u2019s manipulations and recognize that\nRussia\u2019s war is an unprovoked war of conquest, however.\n\nThe Kremlin then targets this last category on a different level of reasoning\n\u2013 the predicates that inform our will to do something about Russia\u2019s war and\nthe lengths to which we are willing to go. The Kremlin targets our perceptions\nof costs, priorities, risks, upsides, alignment with our values, and effects\nof our own actions. Two main categories of false assertions that the Kremlin\nis trying to enforce in this respect are that: a) Ukraine cannot win this war;\nsupporting Ukraine is a distraction from \u2018real\u2019 US problems; Ukraine will be\nforced to settle; the United States is at risk of being stuck in another\n\u201cforever\u201d war; and b) the risks in helping Ukraine defend itself, let alone\nwin, are higher than the risks of failure in Ukraine for the United States -\nit is too costly, too risky, and that Ukraine is not worth it. ISW and many\nothers have thoroughly debunked these assertions, yet they remain pervasive in\nUS discussions about opposing Russia.[12] The Russian goal is to have us\nfreely reason to a conclusion that Russia\u2019s prevailing in Ukraine is\ninevitable and that we must stay on the sidelines \u2014 and Moscow is succeeding\nfar too well in this effort.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that by no means all who oppose continuing or\nexpanding support for Ukraine are doing so as the result of Russian reflexive\ncontrol measures. The point, however, is that Americans must recognize the\nenormous effort the Kremlin is putting into these and other assertions in\norder to create a picture of reality that, taken in its totality, is false \u2014\nRussia had no right to invade Ukraine, has no rights to control Ukraine, was\nnot provoked into such an invasion, will not inevitably win, will not\ninevitably escalate to fighting a full-scale war against NATO, and helping\nUkraine liberate its strategic territories as the only viable path to a\ndurable peace remains the most prudent course of action to secure US\ninterests.\n\nThe Kremlin is also flooding Western discourse with false and irrelevant\nnarratives, forcing us to expend energy, time, and decision bandwidth on\nirrelevancies rather than solutions. It is not an accident that the Western\ndebate often becomes impaled on arguing about basic well-established facts\nabout this war. This phenomenon is not merely a function of Western knowledge\ngaps or short memory. It is also a result of the Kremlin\u2019s effort to saturate\nthe Western debate with its assertions. A key example is a myth about Russia\nprotecting Russian speakers in Ukraine.[13] Russia has obliterated\npredominantly Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine, killing, torturing,\nforcefully deporting, and forcing to flee many Russian-speaking\nUkrainians.[14] Russia harmed the very people in the name of whom it waged the\nwar. Despite this well documented reality, discussions about letting Putin\nkeep \u201cRussian-speaking provinces\u201d to stop the war persist in Western debate.\nThese discussions proceed from a false premise that Russia\u2019s war aimed to\nprotect Russian speakers to a false conclusion that ceding portions of Ukraine\nthat have Russian speakers can resolve the war and is, furthermore, reasonable\nor justifiable. Many other basic facts are in question daily as the Kremlin\nfloods the Western debate with its narratives. Putin deliberately chose to\nfocus his interview with an American media personality on historical\njustifications for the war.[15] Putin is retroactively creating casus belli by\ntwisting a historic narrative on the record. The history of Kievan Rus is as\nirrelevant to the current war as the history of the Roman Empire was to World\nWar II. Every country in the world has a historical basis to claim rights to\nsome or all of the territory of its neighbors. The world avoids a Hobbesian\nwar of all against all by rejecting the validity of such arguments. Yet the\nKremlin\u2019s constant driving of them continues to divert Western discussions\nabout what to do now into these historical irrelevancies. The Kremlin also\nforces the West to dedicate energy to an equally irrelevant discussion about\nwhether Ukraine has the \u201cright\u201d to be a state or a nation. No country with a\nseat in the United Nations and recognized by the overwhelming majority of\nstates in the world has an obligation to prove its right to exist no matter\nhow small or ethnically like another state it might be. This principle is\ncentral to the current world order, and its destruction would open the\nfloodgates of war around the world as predators used such reasoning to justify\nattacks on would-be prey. But the flood of false Russian narratives forces us\nto engage in such irrelevancies rather than focusing on war-winning strategies\nand our interests.\n\nRussia is hijacking and substituting key concepts of Western debate about this\nwar, such as notions of peace and defense, contributing to Western category\nerrors about both.\n\nPeace = Surrender. The West naturally and understandably gravitates toward\npeace. Our default instinct is to seize the first opportunity in any conflict\nto \u201cstop the fighting.\u201d The Kremlin has mastered using the Western\npredisposition to peace as a lifeline for Russia\u2019s wars \u2013 from Syria to\nUkraine.[16] The Kremlin has not once supported its euphemism of \u201cpeace\u201d with\naction in the context of Ukraine. The Kremlin has had continuous opportunities\nto choose peace, including a choice not to invade Ukraine \u2013 a country that\nPutin considered to be so militarily unthreatening that Putin assessed he\ncould conquer it in a matter of days. Allowing Russia to keep its gains in\nUkraine in 2015 and having a peace framework in place for seven years did\nnothing to stop the Kremlin\u2019s reinvasion in 2022.[17] Every single version of\nthe Kremlin\u2019s euphemisms of \u201cpeace\u201d since 2022 has included a demand that\namounted to the destruction of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.[18] Russian Security\nCouncil Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev\u2019s recent \u201cpeace formula\u201d explicitly\ncalled for the elimination of the Ukrainian state and its absorption into\nRussia.[19] The Kremlin\u2019s use of the term \u201cpeace\u201d has been incompatible with\nits actions, including Russia\u2019s campaign to eradicate Ukrainian identity in\nthe occupied territories.[20]\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s exploitation of the Western argument for \u201cstopping the\nbloodshed\u201d conceals another critical nuance. Stopping the fighting does not\nstop the killing when it comes to Russia. The killing continues in Russian\ntorture chambers on territory that Russia occupies \u2013 a process that is less\nvisible to Western audiences and in a place where victims are stripped of the\nmeans to defend themselves.[21]\n\nThe Kremlin dangles the concept of \u201cpeace\u201d to steer the West towards Ukraine\u2019s\nsurrender - the outcome that Russia seeks but cannot accomplish militarily on\nits own. When the Kremlin \u201csignals peace,\u201d it actually signals a demand for\nUkrainian and Western surrender. Western debate continues, nevertheless, to\nindulge the Kremlin\u2019s false overtures for \u201c\u2018peace,\u201d\u2019 despite the total lack of\nevidence to support any reasonable assessment that letting the Kremlin freeze\nthe lines in Ukraine can lead to peace rather than more war.[22]\n\nResisting Russian Aggression = Escalation. No one should be confused about\nverbs when it comes to Ukraine\u2019s actions. Russia imposed its war on Ukraine.\nUkraine chose to defend itself. Ukraine\u2019s action is resisting death,\noccupation, and atrocities at the hands of Russian forces. Yet, the Western\ndebate periodically accuses Ukraine (or the West itself) of \u201cescalating\u201d or\n\u201cprolonging the war.\u201d[23] The Kremlin has greatly invested in framing Ukraine\n\u2013 and anyone who dares to resist the Kremlin \u2013 as an aggressor (and Russia as\na victim). The West\u2019s legitimization of Russia, a belligerent in Ukraine since\n2014, as a mediator in the Minsk agreements also gave the Kremlin eight years\nto falsely frame any Ukrainian self-defense action or unwillingness to bend to\nthe Kremlin\u2019s will as Ukrainian aggression.\n\nNo one should be confused about verbs when it comes to Western actions\nregarding Russia. The West has been non-escalatory toward Russia for years to\nthe point of self-deterrence and ceding its own interests. The West has\nconsistently chosen a path of negotiations, resets, and concessions with\nRussia.[24] The United States did not prioritize Russia, while focused on\ncounterterrorism, largely until 2016 when the Kremlin openly interfered in US\npolitics.[25] NATO has been self-deterring for years, discussions about\nUkraine\u2019s NATO accession have stalled, and Putin expected the Western response\nto his invasion of Ukraine to be so weak that he could conquer Ukraine in a\nmatter of days.[26] Russia has been a self-declared adversary of the US and\nNATO, but neither the US nor NATO took meaningful steps to defend against\nRussia, let alone attack it, until after the full-scale Russian invasion of\nUkraine in 2022.[27] The West nevertheless periodically views its actions\nregarding Russia as by default escalatory, conceding the Kremlin\u2019s reasoning.\nThis includes Western actions to defend itself or its partners against\nunprovoked Russian aggression or measures to limit Russia\u2019s access to Western\ntechnologies and markets \u2013 neither of which Russia is entitled to and\ncertainly not when it uses both to sustain its unjust war. The Kremlin\u2019s\nframing that any Western action to resist Russia is aggression does not make\nthose actions aggression. But the Kremlin has conditioned the West to think\nthat way, forcing us yet again to reason from the Kremlin\u2019s assertions, not\nones based in reality. The West also indulged Putin\u2019s grievances and grudges\nand reasoned to a false conclusion that we are somehow responsible for the\nRussian crimes that the Kremlin voluntarily committed against other states and\nits own people.[28]\n\nThese Russian efforts benefit from and strengthen trends already strong in\nWestern discourse, such as the belief on both sides of the political spectrum\nthat US or Western interventions are the source of all or most problems in the\nworld. People, again, are entitled to their own views on these matters\u2014but all\nshould be aware of the degree to which the Kremlin seeks to weaponize our own\ninternal discussions and disagreements to advance the Kremlin\u2019s own\naggressions and protect itself from the consequences of its atrocities. One\ncan in principle condemn US or NATO policies and actions in the past and also\ncondemn Russian aggression\u2014but not in the Kremlin\u2019s world, and not in the\nfalse reality the Kremlin seeks to impose on our internal discourse.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s focus on degrading US decision making is not opportunistic, new,\nor limited to Ukraine. Perception manipulation is a key element of Putin\u2019s\noffset strategy \u2013 a way to achieve goals beyond the limits of Russia\u2019s power.\nIn 2020 ISW assessed that Putin\u2019s center of gravity is increasingly his\nability to shape perceptions of others and project the image of a powerful\nRussia based on limited real power.[29] We wrote: \u201cThe Kremlin often generates\ngains based on perception without changing Russia\u2019s capabilities. These gains\nemerge at the nexus of the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to manipulate perceptions and the\nWest\u2019s inherent blind spots about Russia\u2019s intent and capabilities. Minimizing\nthe West\u2019s perception of its own leverage over Russia is a core component of\nthis effort.\u201d[30]\n\nThe Kremlin depends on this strategy in Ukraine. Russia does not have\nsufficient military capability to achieve its maximalist objectives if\nUkraine\u2019s will to fight persists alongside Western support. Degrading US\ndecision making is one of the few, possibly the only way, to narrow the gap\nbetween Russia\u2019s goals and means in Ukraine.\n\nRussia uses perception manipulation to advance its interests globally.\nInformation operations have been a key part of the Kremlin\u2019s toolkit for\ndecades. Russia\u2019s national security paradigm shifted heavily toward the\ninformation space after 2014, however, as a recognition of the increasingly\nvital requirement to shape global perceptions to advance Russia\u2019s goals.[31]\nThe Kremlin has been working to create an environment that would simply accept\nRussian premises. If the world accepts that Russia can do whatever it wants\nwithin its self-declared sphere of influence, Russia will need fewer sticks\nand carrots to impose its will on its neighbors. Or, for example, if the\nKremlin succeeds in creating conditions in which NATO is forced to abandon its\nprinciples, such as Article 5 or the Open Door Policy, Putin would have\nsucceeded at his goal of breaking NATO.[32]\n\nThe ability to control perceptions inside of Russia has been an existential\nrequirement for Putin. In 2020 ISW wrote that Putin\u2019s rule depends on his\nability to maintain the perception that an alternative to him in Russia is\neither worse or too costly to fight for.[33] The Kremlin has succeeded in\ninstilling inaction as a default instinct within the Russian population\nthrough physical and informational means. Submission takes time to achieve but\nthe self-deterrence it generates pays off. The submission of the Russian\npopulation is the reason Putin can afford to rule with a suppression apparatus\nshort of Putin\u2019s likely suppression needs \u2013 if his regime were ever to be\ntested again (with Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin providing a\nglimpse of such a test during his June 2023 mutiny).[34]\n\nHerein lies Putin\u2019s core problem with Ukraine. Ukraine has demonstrated the\ncapability to defy Putin\u2019s center of gravity \u2013 his ability to shape the will\nand decisions of others. Ukraine is not immune to the Kremlin\u2019s reflexive\ncontrol, but it achieved strategic clarity in pivotal moments. In 2014,\nbarely-equipped Ukrainian volunteers saw past the Kremlin\u2019s hybrid cover and\nrushed to the frontline to combat Russian aggression \u2013 even in the absence of\nUkraine\u2019s conventional military and Western willingness to counter Russia.[35]\nUkraine did not fall prey to the Kremlin\u2019s campaign in 2019 to force Kyiv into\npolitical concessions that would have compromised Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.[36]\nUkraine resisted Russia\u2019s unprovoked full-scale invasion in 2022.[37] Growing\nantibodies to Russian manipulations within Ukraine\u2019s civil society are among\nthe key reasons Ukraine continues to exist as a state. (The Ukrainian instinct\nto run to the sound of the guns whenever Russians invade to \u201cprotect\u201d\nUkrainians from themselves should be a clear indicator of the falsehood of\nmany Kremlin premises for its aggression. The fact that those premises\ncontinue to persist in the Western discourse despite these obvious\ncontradictions is a testament to Russia\u2019s successful reflexive control\ntechniques.)\n\nII. Our Susceptibility\n\nUS susceptibility to the Kremlin\u2019s manipulations is not all of Russia\u2019s\nmaking. It is also a consequence of America\u2019s inherent traits and blind spots.\n\nValues. The United States values peace, life, American interests, freedom of\ndebate, and is trying to act responsibly with the power it wields. These are\nvirtues, not weaknesses. They set us apart from Russia. Russia nevertheless\nuses these concepts against us in its way of war, as discussed throughout this\npaper.[38] The Western way of life also prevents us from grasping the full\nscale of what Russia is. Russia being mostly content with killing and wounding\nover 300,000 of its own citizens to conquer a country that did not pose a\nmilitary threat is a reality unimaginable in a Western country.\n\nDefeatism and the legacy of US wars. America\u2019s past wars are distorting\nAmerica\u2019s understanding of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. US concern about\nendless wars is a result of its experiences in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\nBut US debate about the risks of a long war in Ukraine revolves around a\nprofound category error in discussing this war as if the United States were\nfighting it.[39] The United States is not fighting in Ukraine and should not\ndiscuss the costs to the United States as if it were. Ukraine, a US partner,\nis fighting this war against a US adversary. It is not a US proxy \u2014 Ukraine is\nfighting for its own reasons, not ours. And Ukraine has never asked for\nAmerican soldiers to fight \u2014 only for material and financial support. US\npsychological scars from previous American conflicts have no place in\ndiscussions about what the United States should do vis-a-vis Ukraine.\n\nMisunderstanding of the Russian threat. The United States has learned a lot\nabout Russia\u2019s intent and capabilities. The United States still, however, does\nnot fully grasp the nature of the Russian threat, Russia\u2019s sources of power\nand weakness, and the Russian way of war \u2013 including reflexive control. This\nknowledge gap is reflected in the prevailing US national security assessment\nthat, while Russia poses the most immediate challenge, China is the bigger\nlong-term threat.[40] This may be a valid assessment of China, but the\nframework is limiting for three reasons. First, it ignores the nature of the\nRussian threat to the United States, which goes beyond military power. Second,\nit ignores the path dependency of the Russian threat to the United States on\nthe outcome of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine: the United States will face the\ngreatest threat from Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union if Russia\nprevails in Ukraine.[41] Finally, it ignores the path dependency of China\u2019s\nthreat to the United States and the future of the anti-US coalition on the\noutcome of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. A Russian victory in Ukraine will empower\nUS adversaries in many ways \u2014 the most dangerous of all, perhaps, would be US\nadversaries learning that the United States can be manipulated into abandoning\nits interests in a winnable fight.[42]\n\nIII. Effects on US Decision-Making\n\nThe West accepted and reasoned from the Kremlin\u2019s premises prior to 2022. The\nWest did not react in any meaningful way to the de facto military occupation\nof Belarus in 2020-2021, endorsing Putin\u2019s premise that Belarus is in Russia\u2019s\nsphere of influence.[43] Europe endorsed Russia-driven and Russian-favorable\npeace talks in Ukraine during Russia\u2019s initial military intervention in 2014,\naccepting the false premise that Russia is a mediator in the conflict where it\nactually has been the initiating belligerent.[44] These are two of many\nexamples.\n\nRussia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine temporarily restored the West\u2019s\nstrategic clarity, helping Ukraine defeat Russia\u2019s initial objectives in this\nwar. The world had a moment of clarity in 2022, recognizing Russia\u2019s true\nintent and capability \u2013 including the limits of Russia\u2019s capability, Ukraine\u2019s\nagency, and the civilizational stakes of this war. That strategic clarity\ninformed a myriad of actions by individuals and leaders in Ukraine and\nglobally. These actions yielded critical successes: enabling Ukraine to defeat\nRussia in the battle of Kyiv, which meant the difference between the world\u2019s\nlargest present-day war and what would have been the world\u2019s largest\ninsurgency. It also enabled Ukraine to liberate critical terrain and people\nthroughout 2022.[45]\n\nThe Kremlin shifted its main effort to shaping Western decisions ever since\nRussia\u2019s failed \u2018three-day war.\u2019 This effort has several subordinate\nobjectives:\n\n  * Delaying US provision of military capabilities to Ukraine by reinforcing narratives about the dangers of providing Ukraine materiel; exploiting US approaches to escalation management; and planting discussions of negotiations with the West about Ukraine\u2019s fate around critical Western debate moments.[46]\n  * Driving the West to constrain Ukraine\u2019s right to self-defense, including striking legitimate and necessary military targets in Russia or by limiting how Ukraine can use Western-provided weapons.[47]\n  * Constraining and delaying Western direct actions against Russia, such as transferring frozen Russian assets to Ukraine or applying more effective energy sanctions.[48]\n  * Delaying the West\u2019s ramp up of its own capabilities and divestment from Russia.[49]\n  * Deterring potential Western combat operations in Ukraine by using nuclear blackmail and issuing other ambiguous threats.[50]\n  * Degrading NATO\u2019s ability to resist Russia by exploiting relationships with select NATO members to drive wedges between alliance members.[51]\n  * Preventing the West from developing a long-term policy on supporting Ukraine by manipulating the Western perception about what constitutes a victory or a defeat in Ukraine.[52]\n  * Distracting the West from Russian aggression by playing up US fears over the emergence of other conflicts throughout the world.[53]\n  * Driving the West to concede on behalf of Ukraine via diplomatic backchannels and persistent public messaging.[54]\n\nRussia has regained its ability to alter Western perceptions without\nmeaningfully altering Russia\u2019s capability. The Kremlin-generated information\nbackdrop of mostly groundless fears and irrelevancies has shaped Western\ndecisions, resulting in lost opportunities for Ukraine and an advantage for\nRussia. Western self-deterrence and delays in Western decisions extended the\nKremlin\u2019s runway to sustain this war:\n\n  * Russian perception manipulations cost Ukraine gains in its 2023 counteroffensive.[55] Russia\u2019s nuclear-centric information operations in the fall of 2022 aimed to delay Western provision of tanks and other key capabilities to Ukraine.[56] US failure to proactively resource Ukraine\u2019s initiative after two successful, successive counteroffensive operations in the fall of 2022 contributed to a missed opportunity for Ukraine to conduct a third phase of counteroffensive operations in the winter of 2022-2023.[57] This reprieve allowed Russia to build its defenses in depth and conduct a partial mobilization to shore up manpower, making Ukraine\u2019s 2023 counteroffensive an extraordinarily difficult undertaking.[58]\n  * Western hesitation to provide the longest-range systems to Ukraine \u2013 and foregoing the strategic effect those systems would have generated on the battlefield \u2013 has been driven by the Kremlin-fueled fears that Ukraine might use those systems to strike targets in Russia provoking some unspecified escalation. Putin is not at all likely to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine simply to retaliate for Ukrainian strikes in Russia with Western missiles when he has not done so in response to repeated Ukrainian drone strikes.\n  * Western self-deterrence of its own actions against Russia, such as slow rolling sanctions on Russia or transferring frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, also reflects some fear of retaliation, even though Russia\u2019s ability to escalate in the economic realm is highly limited.\n  * Western self-deterrence has not prevented the Kremlin from ramping up Russia\u2019s capabilities, including by developing anti-satellite weapons and procuring military equipment from North Korea and Iran, and growing military exchanges between these countries.[59]\n\nIV. Defying the Kremlin\u2019s Strategy\n\nEscaping the Kremlin-generated alternative reality requires more than evading\nRussian information operations. The United States must reconnect with its own\ninterests and the ground truths of this war.\n\nThe ebbs and flows on the battlefield in Ukraine are irrelevant to the\nfundamental US interests regarding Russia and Ukraine. Russia aims to erase\nUkraine as a state \u2013 an outcome that is unacceptable to US interests and\nvalues. Any outcome short of Ukraine liberating its critical territory will\nlikely lead to a larger war with higher escalation risks for the US and under\nthe conditions that favor Russia.[60] As long as Ukraine\u2019s will to fight\npersists, the most prudent US strategy remains helping Ukraine liberate its\nterritory and people as the only viable path to a durable peace. A result of\nany individual phase or an operation \u2013 such as the 2023 Ukrainian\ncounteroffensive \u2013 should not affect the fundamental US calculus regarding\nRussia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\nThe future of Russia\u2019s power and Russia\u2019s ability to threaten the United\nStates is path dependent on the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin\u2019s intent to\nundermine the United States and break NATO not only persists but is\ngrowing.[61] The Kremlin is preparing for a large-scale conflict with\nNATO.[62] Russia\u2019s ability to act on this intent is not a given. Russia\u2019s\nability to reconstitute, to threaten the United States and NATO; to control\nits neighbors; the Kremlin\u2019s ability to manipulate the United States will and\nperceptions; and the strength of Russia\u2019s coalitions, including with US\nadversaries, all depend on whether Russia wins or loses in Ukraine.\n\nThe cost of failure in Ukraine would be catastrophic. The threat of a nuclear\nescalation will continue to be the core asset of Russia\u2019s perception\nmanipulation.[63] We must address this issue head on. First, we are already in\na scenario with a heightened risk of a nuclear escalation. We are here not\nbecause Ukraine or the West refuses to settle or deescalate. In fact, both\nsettled for eight years and accepted a Russia-driven peace framework in\nUkraine. But Putin reinvaded anyway, bringing us into this unstable scenario\nwith an increased probably of the use of nuclear weapons. Secondly, the risk\nof a Russia-NATO war increases exponentially if Russia keeps its gains in\nUkraine.[64] A victorious Russia is a faster path to a Russia-NATO war than a\nvictorious Ukraine. Finally, Russia prevailing in Ukraine would constitute a\nconvincing argument for the effectiveness of nuclear blackmail and would lead\nto nuclear proliferation. ISW has assessed other costs of losing Ukraine in\ndetail.[65]\n\nRussian victory in Ukraine would mean a victory of reflexive control. If\nRussia wins in Ukraine, it will mean the Kremlin managed to undermine the\nWestern will and ability to reason from the ground truths and its interests.\nTruth and free will are concepts that the free world cannot exist without.\nHelping Ukraine win and defeating the premises Russia is trying to enforce\nshould be the main effort of the United States and the free world if it wants\nto remain free.\n\nThe upside is high. Ukraine\u2019s victory would enhance NATO\u2019s security. Ukraine\nwould emerge as an invaluable asset for the United States and a testament to\nthe values underpinning Western societies.[66] Ukraine will be able to share\nits experience in how to successfully wage modern war with US allies. Stopping\nRussia in Ukraine will allow the West to regain its deterrence capabilities \u2014\nespecially against Russia. A pro-NATO Ukraine, even if it is not in the\nalliance, would pose a serious military challenge to Russian plans to attack\nthe Baltic States or Poland, enhancing NATO\u2019s ability to deter such aggression\nand avoid future war with Russia.\n\nThe West has the advantage, but it must decide to use it. The West is a giant\nthat \u2013 at times \u2013 behaves like a mouse when it comes to Russia. All it needs\nto do is stand up. That is why Russia needs to develop offsets and ways to\nfight asymmetrically. The power dynamic favors the West \u2014 and Ukraine, if the\nWest decides to mobilize on behalf of Ukraine. Mobilizing would mean surging\nits military production, sparing more of its existing military capabilities\nand economic assets, and accepting a higher threshold for pain and risk now to\navoid more cost and pain and risk in the future.\n\nThe challenges facing the United States are easier to solve than those facing\nRussia. The gap that Ukraine and its partners need to close to help Ukraine\nwin is smaller than the gap that Russia needs to close to achieve its\nobjectives in Ukraine. The Kremlin has mobilized a lot of its resources \u2014 far\nfrom all that the Kremlin can mobilize but orders of magnitude higher than\nwhat the West has mobilized on behalf of Ukraine. Russia had every advantage\nin the last ten years and occupied 18% of Ukraine at an enormous cost. Putin\nwill mobilize more manpower and material, but Russia\u2019s surge capacity is\nneither unlimited nor without costs and constraints.\n\nThe West is not as fragile as Russia wants us to think. Putin sought but\nfailed to freeze Europe.[67] He has been trying but has failed to break NATO\n(though he will have a real chance to do so if Russia wins in Ukraine).\nMinimizing the West\u2019s perception of its own strength is a core component of\nthe Kremlin\u2019s perception manipulation.\n\nThe West is awakening. Many Western leaders and societies have awakened to the\nreality that there is no going back to the status quo ante, that Russia is a\nself-declared adversary, and that the West has two choices: counter the threat\nor surrender to it. Ukraine\u2019s European and Asia-Pacific partners began forming\ncoalitions for weapon procurement to support Ukraine; European countries began\nramping up their defense industrial bases to restock NATO supplies and assist\nUkraine.[68] French President Emanuel Macron warned the West against showing\nany signs of weakness to Russia as he entertained the prospect of sending\nWestern troops into Ukraine.[69] But US leadership remains indispensable.\n\nWestern advantage is not a permanent condition. Ukrainian lives and the\nWestern advantage over Russia are the costs of US and Western decision-making\ndelays. Ukraine\u2019s agency and will to fight are assets of historical\nproportions that should not be taken for granted. Delaying resource\nmobilization decisions in the West will erode this center of gravity. Putin\nhas considered Russia to be at war with the West for a while and has been\nacting like it. Putin recently signed decrees restoring the Moscow and\nLeningrad Military Districts, which may be in preparation for a potential\nfuture large-scale conventional war against NATO.[70] The Kremlin intensified\nthe use of rhetorical threats against Finland and the Baltic countries,\nincluding accusing Baltic countries of intolerance towards ethnic Russians in\nthe region.[71] The erosion of the West\u2019s capability to counter the Russian\nthreat will be proportionate to the delays in the Western realization of the\nthreat itself.\n\nV. The Next Decisions\n\nThe United States must restore its strategic clarity and get the big idea\nright: the best course of action for US interests is to support Ukraine to its\nvictory, as the only path to a durable peace rather than a temporary respite,\nand then help Ukraine rebuild, putting the largest combat-effective friendly\nmilitary in Europe at the forefront of NATO\u2019s defense.[72]\n\nThe United States needs to surge and then persist in support of this\nobjective. A sustained US effort, rather than a one-time surge, will grant\nUkraine the certainty about resourcing that it can expect from international\npartners so Ukraine can plan for future operations. The US decision to persist\nshould also stem from a recognition that Russia is a persistent challenge that\nrequires persistent effort. The costs of persistence are minor compared to the\ncatastrophic and irreversible consequences of letting Russia prevail in\nUkraine.\n\nThe United States and other Ukrainian allies need to take several specific and\nimmediate steps:\n\n1\\. Provide Ukraine with sufficient military aid and other support required\nfor Ukraine to restore maneuver to the battlefield.[73]\n\n2\\. Support Ukraine\u2019s effort to expand its defense industrial base (DIB) but\nalso ramp up the US and allied DIB to support Ukraine in the medium term and\nto strengthen our own deterrence capabilities against Russia and other US\nadversaries.\n\n3\\. Target Russia\u2019s capability to sustain the war against Ukraine.[74]\n\n  * Deny Russia\u2019s sanctuaries. Russia is not entitled to sanctuaries when it is trying to erase a nation. The West must abandon the Russian information line that Russia, having launched an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, can demand immunity from attack with Western or Ukrainian weapons. The United States must remove any existing constraints on Ukraine to target legitimate Russian military and defense industrial capabilities in Russia. The West should also develop a long-term strategy against \u201csacred Russian cows\u201d in the West, such as the Russian state nuclear energy corporation Rosatom. Rosatom is a major arm of the Kremlin, doing its bidding from Ukraine to the Arctic to Africa largely unimpeded due the Western economic interdependencies.[75] The long-term divestment from Rosatom is likely feasible, but it requires just that \u2014 for us to think in terms of a long-term strategy of denying Russia its capability sanctuaries.\n  * Focus on asymmetries. Ukraine has exposed numerous Russian weaknesses from the vulnerabilities of the Black Sea Fleet to the vulnerability of Russian defense industrial assets to Ukrainian drone and missile strikes.[76] The United States should amplify and accelerate not constrain these effective asymmetric warfare approaches that also impact Russia\u2019s battlefield operations and force Putin to make hard choices about resource allocation.\n  * Target Russia\u2019s capability globally. Putin is playing the full board, so should we \u2013 targeting Russia\u2019s capability from Africa to the Arctic.\n  * Strip the Kremlin of its offset capabilities. The United States must defy the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to alter our own decision making and will. The United States must also deny the Kremlin the luxury of time to regroup on the battlefield, and to rebuild Russia\u2019s broader military and perception manipulation capabilities only later to be used against us.\n\n[1]\nhttps://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/JPN/USA/GBR/NOR/IRN/NZ...\n\n[2] https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/RUS\n\n[3] https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/26/russia-ukraine-\nchina-...;\nhttps://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Jan%2016%20Russian%...;\nhttps://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign... ;\nhttps://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign...\n\n[4] https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/target-\nrussia%E2%80%99s-ca... https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/high-\nprice-losing-ukraine-...;\nhttps://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/E40%20-%20Putin%27s...\n\n[5] https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-\ncampaign...;
