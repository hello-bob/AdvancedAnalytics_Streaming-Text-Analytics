This is because\nthe material, which is highly reactive, is a key element in\nbatteries\u2014including of the kind used in electric vehicles (hence the name,\nlithium ion batteries).\n\nDue to this, demand for lithium is soaring. The precious resource can be\nextracted from brines\u2014and also mined in select locations including Argentina,\nAustralia, Bolivia, Chile and China. But scientists have now found it in an\napparently undervalued mineral.\n\nThe strange discovery was made after a team of researchers from West Virginia\nUniversity set out to see whether lithium could be extracted with alternative\nindustrial operations.\n\nA stock photo shows a piece of fools gold, or pyrite. The material could be a\nmajor source of lithium. A stock photo shows a piece of fools gold, or pyrite.\nThe material could be a major source of lithium.
