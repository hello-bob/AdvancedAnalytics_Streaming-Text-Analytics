The entire training cycle is super efficient, which\n> takes 8 hours on one 8xA800 (80G) GPU machine. The resulted model exhibits\n> superior performances across a broad range of evaluation tasks, such as\n> NIHS, topic retrieval, and long-context language understanding; meanwhile,\n> it also well preserves the original capability over short contexts. The\n> dramatic context extension is mainly attributed to merely 3.5K synthetic\n> training samples generated by GPT-4 , which indicates the LLMs' inherent\n> (yet largely underestimated) potential to extend its original context\n> length. In fact, the context length could be extended far beyond 80K with\n> more computation resources. Therefore, the team will publicly release the\n> entire resources (including data, model, data generation pipeline, training\n> code) so as to facilitate the future research from the community: \\url{this\n> https URL}.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.19553 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.19553v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.19553arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Peitian Zhang [view email] [v1] Tue, 30 Apr 2024 13:25:20 UTC (38 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Extending Llama-3's Context Ten-Fold Overnight,\nby Peitian Zhang and 6 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
