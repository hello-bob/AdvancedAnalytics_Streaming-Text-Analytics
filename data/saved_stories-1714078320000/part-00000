But recently, his remains, including a couple of\nwell-preserved molars, came to light. Those teeth tell a new story about the\nconnection between modern diets and cavity-causing bacteria.\n\nLara Cassidy, a geneticist at the Trinity College Dublin who specializes in\nancient human DNA, was surprised to find an abundance of genetic material from\nStreptococcus mutans, one of the major causes of cavities and tooth decay, on\nthe ancient man\u2019s teeth. It\u2019s a species that is rare in the ancient genomic\nrecord\u2014for a few reasons. The bacteria is acid-producing, which degrades DNA\nand prevents fossilization of dental plaque, the material scientists use to\nsample oral bacterial DNA. But the limestone of the cave in which the teeth\nwere found, in Killuragh, County Limerick, is alkaline, which likely helped to\nneutralize the acid and preserve the genetic material.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Cavities are caused by lactic acid produced by a number\nof oral bacteria when they consume sugars and other food on the teeth. This\nacid breaks down the tooth enamel.\n\nCassidy and colleagues used the ancient man\u2019s molars to reconstruct the first\nancient genome for S. mutans. The new data, analyzed in conjunction with\nmodern genomes, allowed them to build a picture of the evolution of the\nbacteria across millennia for the first time. Previous work with modern oral\nmicrobiome genomes suggested that S. mutans populations increased following\nthe adoption of cereal agriculture 12,000 years ago. But the new findings\nindicate they really skyrocketed around 250 to 750 years ago, when sugar and\nprocessed carbs, such as rice and bread, became a big component of human\ndiets. S. mutans particularly loves sucrose, Cassidy says. \u201cIt helps it create\nthe sort of sticky film that this bacteria uses to colonize the tooth surface\nso it can consume all different sugars.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

In addition to S. mutans, the researchers collected and\nanalyzed another bacteria named Tannerella forsythia, which is associated with\ngum disease, from the man\u2019s teeth. They found far greater genetic diversity in\nthe ancient T. forsythia than is present in its modern genome, with a sharp\ndecline occurring at the dawn of the industrial era. This loss of diversity\ncould potentially make humans more susceptible to other oral pathogens, the\nresearchers write. In addition, their analyses allowed them to identify a\nsharp increase in virulence\u2014the ability to infect and cause disease\u2014for both\nbacteria in the post-industrial age. These shifts in genetic diversity and\nvirulence could have important implications for human health overall, as the\noral microbiome has links with the immune system, neurodegenerative disease\nand overall systemic health.\n\nThe researchers published their findings in March in the journal Molecular\nBiology and Evolution. They were able to build an entire genome for ancient S.\nMutans for the first time because of the large quantity of the bacteria\npresent on one of the Bronze Age man\u2019s teeth when he was alive. So much S.\nMutans bacteria would likely have led to cavities had he lived, says Cassidy.\nThe man\u2019s diet would have included some barley, other grains, and some\nfruit\u2014all foods that appeal to the S. Mutans bacteria\u2014but would not have been\nas rich in sugars and processed carbs as the modern diet, she says. Ancient\npeople had their own methods of oral hygiene: Twigs and kinds of different\nfibers were often used to clean the teeth.\n\nThe study left Cassidy with a new appreciation for how quickly the bacteria in\nhuman mouths have changed in a short time frame. Oral microbiomes were quite\nstable for thousands of years\u2014there aren\u2019t huge differences between medieval\ngenomes and prehistoric ones when it comes to the bacteria we carry in our\nmouths. But in the industrial period, our diets began to evolve rapidly, and\noral bacteria evolved with them.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
