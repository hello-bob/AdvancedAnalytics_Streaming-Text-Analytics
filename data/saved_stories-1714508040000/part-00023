The campaign, which has already targeted Taiwan\u2019s\nelections, uses AI-generated audio and memes designed to grab user attention\nand boost engagement.\n\nBut what these headlines and Microsoft itself failed to adequately convey is\nthat the Chinese-government-linked disinformation campaign, known as\nSpamouflage Dragon or Dragonbridge, has so far been virtually ineffective.\n\n\u201cI would describe China's disinformation campaigns as Russia 2014. As in,\nthey're 10 years behind,\u201d says Clint Watts, the general manager of Microsoft\u2019s\nThreat Analysis Center. \u201cThey're trying lots of different things but their\nsophistication is still very weak.\u201d\n\nOver the past 24 months, the campaign has switched from pushing predominately\npro-China content to more aggressively targeting US politics. While these\nefforts have been large-scale and across dozens of platforms, they have\nlargely failed to have any real world impact. Still, experts warn that it can\ntake just a single post being amplified by an influential account to change\nall of that.\n\n\u201cSpamouflage is like throwing spaghetti at the wall, and they are throwing a\nlot of spaghetti,\u201d says Jack Stubbs, chief information officer at Graphika, a\nsocial media analysis company that was among the first to identify the\nSpamouflage campaign. \u201cThe volume and scale of this thing is huge. They're\nputting out multiple videos and cartoons every day, amplified across different\nplatforms at a global scale. The vast majority of it, for the time being,\nappears to be something that doesn't stick, but that doesn't mean it won't\nstick in the future.\u201d\n\nSince at least 2017, Spamouflage has been ceaselessly spewing out content\ndesigned to disrupt major global events, including topics as diverse as the\nHong Kong pro-democracy protests, the US presidential elections, and Israel\nand Gaza. Part of a wider multibillion-dollar influence campaign by the\nChinese government, the campaign has used millions of accounts on dozens of\ninternet platforms ranging from X and YouTube to more fringe platforms like\nGab, where the campaign has been trying to push pro-China content. It\u2019s also\nbeen among the first to adopt cutting-edge techniques such as AI-generated\nprofile pictures.\n\nEven with all of these investments, experts say the campaign has largely\nfailed due to a number of factors including issues of cultural context,\nChina\u2019s online partition from the outside world via the Great Firewall, a lack\nof joined-up thinking between state media and the disinformation campaign, and\nthe use of tactics designed for China\u2019s own heavily controlled online\nenvironment.\n\n\u201cThat's been the story of Spamouflage since 2017: They're massive, they're\neverywhere, and nobody looks at them except for researchers,\u201d says Elise\nThomas, a senior open source analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue\nwho has tracked the Spamouflage campaign for years.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nI Tried These AI-Based Productivity Tools.

Anyone can do so with\n$5 on a credit card.\u201d\n\nThe campaign has also taken place on virtually every social media platform,\nincluding Facebook, Reddit, TikTok, and YouTube. Over the years, major\nplatforms have purged their systems of hundreds of thousands of accounts\nlinked to the campaign, including last year when Meta took down what it called\n\u201cthe largest known cross-platform covert influence operation in the world.\u201d\n\nThe US government has also sought to curb the effort. A year ago, the\nDepartment of Justice charged 34 officers of the Chinese Ministry of Public\nSecurity\u2019s \u201c912 Special Project Working Group\u201d for their involvement in an\ninfluence campaign. While the DOJ did not explicitly link the arrests to\nSpamouflage, a source with knowledge of the event told WIRED that the campaign\nwas \u201c100 percent\u201d Chinese state-sponsored. The source spoke on the condition\nof anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the\ninformation.\n\n\u201cA commercial actor would not be doing this,\u201d says Thomas, who also believes\nthe campaign is run by the Chinese government. \u201cThey are more innovative. They\nwould have changed tactics, whereas it's not unusual for a government\ncommunications campaign to persist for a really long time despite being\nuseless.\u201d\n\nFor the past seven years, however, the content pushed by the Spamouflage\ncampaign has lacked nuance and audience-specific content that successful\nnation-state disinformation campaigns from countries like Russia, Iran, and\nTurkey have included.\n\n\u201cThey get the cultural context confused, which is why you'll see them make\nmistakes,\u201d says Watts. \u201cThey're in the audience talking about things that\ndon't make sense and the audience knows that, so they don't engage with the\ncontent. They leave Chinese characters sometimes in their posts.\u201d\n\nPart of this is the result of Chinese citizens being virtually blocked off\nfrom the outside world as a result of the Great Firewall, which allows the\nChinese government to strictly control what its citizens see and share on the\ninternet. This, experts say, makes it incredibly difficult for those running\nan influence operation to really grasp how to successfully manipulate\naudiences outside of China.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nI Tried These AI-Based Productivity Tools.

It's kind of like trying to flood the sea.\u201d\n\nStubbs agrees. \u201cTheir domestic information environment is not one that is real\nor authentic,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are now being tasked with achieving influence\nand affecting operational strategic impact in a free and authentic information\nenvironment, which is just fundamentally a different place.\u201d\n\nRussian influence campaigns have also tended to coordinate across multiple\nlayers of government spokespeople, state-run media, influencers, and bot\naccounts on social media. They all push the same message at the same\ntime\u2014something the Spamouflage operators don\u2019t do. This was seen recently when\nthe Russian disinformation apparatus was activated to sow division in the US\naround the Texas border crisis, boosting the extremist-led border convoy and\ncalls for \u201ccivil war\u201d on state media, influencer Telegram channels, and social\nmedia bots all at the same time.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest problem is [the Chinese campaign] doesn\u2019t synchronize\ntheir efforts,\u201d Watts said. \u201cThey\u2019re just very linear on whatever their task\nis, whether it\u2019s overt media or some sort of covert media. They\u2019re doing it\nand they\u2019re doing it at scale, but it\u2019s not synchronized around their\nobjectives because it\u2019s a very top down effort.\u201d\n\nSome of the content produced by the campaign appeared to have a high number of\nlikes and replies, but closer inspection revealed that those engagements came\nfrom other accounts in the Spamouflage network. \u201cIt was a network that was\nvery insular, it was only engaging with itself,\u201d says Thomas.\n\nWatts does not believe China\u2019s disinformation campaigns will have a material\nimpact on the US election, but added that the situation \u201ccan change nearly\ninstantaneously. If the right account stumbles onto [a post by a Chinese bot\naccount] and gives it a voice, suddenly their volume will grow.\u201d\n\nThis, Thomas says, has already happened.\n\nA post, written on X by an account Thomas had been tracking that has since\nbeen suspended, referenced \u201cMAGA 2024\u201d in their bio. It shared a video from\nRussian state-run channel RT that alleged President Joe Biden and the CIA had\nsent a neo-Nazi to fight in Ukraine\u2014a claim that has been debunked by\ninvestigative group Bellingcat. Like most Spamouflage posts, the video\nreceived little attention initially, but when it was shared by the account of\nschool shooting conspiracist Alex Jones, who has more than 2.2 million\nfollowers on the platform, it quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of\nviews.\n\n\u201cWhat is different about these MAGAflage accounts is that real people are\nlooking at them, including Alex Jones. It\u2019s the most bizarre tweet I\u2019ve ever\nseen,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nThomas says the account that was shared by Jones is different from typical\nSpamouflage accounts, because it was not spewing out automated content, but\nseeking to organically engage with other users in a way that made them appear\nto be a real person\u2014reminiscent of what Russian accounts did in the lead-up to\nthe 2016 election.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nI Tried These AI-Based Productivity Tools.

If they start doing it with new accounts that don't have\nthose interesting connections to the Spamouflage network and if you then\nhypothetically lay on top of that, if they start using large language models\nto generate text with AI, I think we're in a lot of trouble.\u201d\n\nStubbs says that Graphika has been tracking Spamouflage accounts that have\nbeen attempting to impersonate US voters since before the 2022 midterms, and\nhasn\u2019t yet witnessed real success. And while he believes reporting on these\nefforts is important, he\u2019s concerned that these high-profile campaigns could\nobscure the smaller ones.\n\n\"We are going to see increasing amounts of public discussion and reporting on\ncampaigns like Spamouflage and Doppelganger from Russia, precisely because we\nalready know about them,\u201d says Stubbs. \u201cBoth those campaigns are examples of\nactivity that is incredibly high scale, but also very easy to detect. [But] I\nam more concerned and more worried about the things we don't know.\"\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Get Plaintext\u2014Steven Levy's long view on tech\n\n  * What if your AI girlfriend hated you?
