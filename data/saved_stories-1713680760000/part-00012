The program can also generate images based\non text prompts.\n\nMeta AI is available in the search bar of the applications and uses the Llama\n3 model.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n0:24 Facebook, Instagram users back online after brief Meta platform outage\n\nHowever, some are already reporting unwanted applications of the new program.\n\nBreaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it\nhappens.\n\nFor example, The Associated Press reported that an official Meta AI chatbot\ninserted itself into a conversation in a private Facebook group for Manhattan\nmoms. It claimed it too had a child in school in New York City, but when\nconfronted by the group members, it later apologized before its comments\ndisappeared, according to screenshots shown to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cApologies for the mistake! I\u2019m just a large language model, I don\u2019t have\nexperiences or children,\u201d the chatbot told the group.\n\nTrending Now\n\n  * Aggressive sheep kills New Zealand couple, leaving community shocked\n\n  * What\u2019s next for the man who\u2019s lived in Stanley Park for 30 years?\n\nFacebook\u2019s online help page says that Meta AI will join a group conversation\nif tagged, or if someone \u201casks a question in a post and no one responds within\nan hour.\u201d\n\nGroup administrators can turn the feature off.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhile that feature can be turned off, Meta AI\u2019s more general presence on the\nplatforms cannot, according to a statement from Meta to Global News. However,\na spokesperson said there are feedback tools you can use if you didn\u2019t like a\nresponse received.\n\n\u201cMeta AI aims to be a helpful assistant and is in the search bar to assist\nwith your questions. You can\u2019t disable it from this experience, but you can\nsearch how you normally would to engage with a variety of results,\u201d the\nspokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use this feedback to continue training the models so they are less\nlikely to produce potentially harmful outputs and to improve the ability of\nour systems to automatically detect policy violations.\u201d\n\nAI systems have slowly been popping up after ChatGPT popularized the idea,\nincluding from Google and X. Meta\u2019s integration of AI, though, with its\nbillions of users, would be one of the largest distributions of such\ntechnology so far.\n\n\u2014 with files from The Associated Press.\n\nMore on Canada\n\n  * How capital gains tax changes could affect some family doctors\n  * What\u2019s next for the man who\u2019s lived in Stanley Park for 30 years?\n  * Thousands pack Surrey streets for Vaisakhi celebrations\n  * Fire posing explosion risk in Newfoundland town now under control, RCMP says\n\nJournalistic standards Report an error\n\n\u00a9 2024 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.\n\n## Sponsored content\n\nMore to Explore\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\n## More from Global News\n\n  * Indigenous healing lodges face chronic underfunding across Canada, critics say\n\n  * Thousands pack Surrey streets for Vaisakhi celebrations\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay in the loop\n\nThe email you need for the day\u2019s top news stories from Canada and around the\nworld.\n\n## Trending\n\n  * Aggressive sheep kills New Zealand couple, leaving community shocked\n\n32,431 Read\n\n  * State of emergency declared in Happy Valley-Goose Bay due to uncontrolled fire\n\n23,887 Read\n\n  * Meta says you can\u2019t turn off its new AI tool on Facebook, Instagram\n\n20,685 Read\n\n  * What\u2019s next for the man who\u2019s lived in Stanley Park for 30 years?\n\n19,251 Read\n\n  * How capital gains tax changes could affect some family doctors\n\n18,204 Read\n\n  * Did cloud seeding cause Dubai flooding?
