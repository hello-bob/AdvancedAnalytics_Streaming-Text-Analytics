Today, it expanded on\nthat practice with a new ad format that aims to sell things to Reddit users.\nSimultaneously, Reddit has marketers who are interested in pushing products to\nusers through seemingly legitimate accounts.\n\nIn a blog post today, Reddit announced that its Dynamic Product Ads are\nentering public beta globally. The ad format uses \"shopping signals,\" aka,\ndiscussions with people looking to try a product or brand, machine learning,\nand advertiser product catalogs in order to post relevant ads. Reddit shared\nan image in the blog post that shows ads, including with products and pricing,\nthat seem to relate to a posted question. User responses to the Reddit post\nappear under the ad.\n\n  * A somewhat blurry depiction of the new type of ads Reddit is testing.\n\nReddit\n\n  * A (still blurry) example of a more targeted approach to Reddit's new ad format.\n\nReddit\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nReddit's Dynamic Product Ads can automatically show users ads \"based on the\nproducts they\u2019ve previously engaged with on the advertiser\u2019s site\" and/or\n\"based on what people engage with on Reddit or advertiser sites,\" per the\nblog.\n\n## Reddit is an ad business\n\nReddit's blog didn't imply that Dynamic Product Ads means users would see more\nads than they do currently. However, today's blog highlighted the newly public\ncompany's focus on ad sales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith Dynamic Product Ads, brands can tap into the rich, high-intent product\nconversations that people come to Reddit for,\" Reddit EVP of Business\nMarketing and Growth Jim Squires said in a statement.\n\nThe blog also noted that \"Reddit's communities are naturally commercial,\"\nadding:\n\n> Reddit is where people come to make shopping decisions, and we\u2019re focused on\n> bringing brands into these interactions in a way that adds value for people\n> and drives growth for businesses.\n\nThe stance has been increasingly clear over the past year, as Reddit became\nrather vocal about the fact that it has never been profitable. In June, the\ncompany started charging for API access, resulting in numerous valued third-\nparty Reddit apps closing and messy user protests that left a bad taste in\ncountless long-time users' and moderators' mouths. While Reddit initially\nannounced the change as a way to prevent large language models from using its\ndata for free training, it was also seen as a way to drive users to Reddit's\nwebsite and mobile app, where it can serve users ads.\n\nPer Reddit's February SEC filing (PDF), ads made up 98 percent of Reddit's\nrevenues in 2023 and 2022. That filing included a note from CEO Steve Huffman,\nsaying: \"Advertising is our first business\" and that Reddit's ad business is\n\"still in the early phases of growing.\"\n\nIn September, the company started preventing users from opting out of\npersonalized ads. In June, Reddit introduced a new tool to advertisers that\nuses natural language processing to look through Reddit user comments for\nkeywords that signal potential interest for a brand.\n\nReddit's blog post today hinted at some future evolutions focused on showing\nReddit users ads, including \"tools and features such as new shopping ads\nformats like collection ads that enhance the shopper experience while driving\nperformance\" and \"merchant platform integrations that welcome smaller\nmerchants.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n149\n\nScharon Harding Scharon is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Product Reviewer writing\nnews, reviews, and analysis on consumer technology, including laptops,\nmechanical keyboards, and monitors.
