While there are many techniques for rendering filled paths on\n> GPU, stroked paths have proved more elusive. This paper presents a technique\n> for performing stroke expansion, namely the generation of the outline\n> representing the stroke of the given input path. Stroke expansion is a\n> global problem, with challenging constraints on continuity and correctness.\n> Nonetheless, we implement it using a fully parallel algorithm suitable for\n> execution in a GPU compute shader, with minimal preprocessing. The output of\n> our method can be either line or circular arc segments, both of which are\n> well suited to GPU rendering, and the number of segments is minimal. We\n> introduce several novel techniques, including an encoding of vector graphics\n> primitives suitable for parallel processing, and an Euler spiral based\n> method for computing approximations to parallel curves and evolutes.\n\nSubjects:| Graphics (cs.GR)  \n---|---  \nACM classes:| I.3  \nCite as:| arXiv:2405.00127 [cs.GR]  \n(or arXiv:2405.00127v1 [cs.GR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.00127arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Raph Levien [view email] [v1] Tue, 30 Apr 2024 18:24:51 UTC (13,440 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled GPU-friendly Stroke Expansion, by Raph Levien\nand Arman Uguray\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.GR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2405\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
