Among other plans, my goal was to never give a\nbribe. As westerners we believe avoiding bribes is sacred--it's part of our\nsecular religion that we never think to question.But after some time I\nrealized, Democracy came to Africa on a boat. Before white people, Africans\nhad a perfectly fine system that involved patronage to the local chief. They\ndidn't need a complex system of millions of pages of writing. People back then\ndidn't even need a writing system; they didn't have one.Now Africa has a\nmixture of the traditional systems and Democracy. We call it corruption.Years\nago in Africa I joined a business group which I won\u2019t name to protect the\ninnocent. (The group is widely known for its strong moral values.) I was the\nonly white guy and the youngest.We visited the businesses of each of the other\nmembers. This was eye opening. They all had wonderful businesses. And giving\nbribes was not something some of them did. It was something all of them did.\nFor many, strategically giving bribes was a core competency.Bribes in the US\nonly become important at the level of Tesla, Pfizer, Halliburton, etc but in\nAfrica it\u2019s part of everyday life for startup founders right from the\nbeginning.Now I understood better. Or I thought I understood. Because one day\nan African guest lecturer came to the business group who had founded and ran a\nhuge local company. \"I've never paid a bribe,\" he said. \"The other week I was\ncaught by the police. They said \u2018pay a bribe or go to the police station.\u2019 So\nI said 'Let's go to the Police station.' \"Afterwards I talked to my\ngroupmates, impressed. \"Wow! so he has never paid a bribe,\" I said.They all\nlaughed. \"Kyle, of course he has paid bribes. You don't get where he is\nwithout paying bribes. Everyone pays bribes. When an African says that in\nfront of an audience we are winking at eachother. He must be trying to raise\nmoney from some Americans so he needs to impress them with his purity. Look\nhow impressed you are.\" Sure enough, he soon sold the company to an American\nPE fund.\"So how do you record bribes? You have to say how you spent the money\nin your accounting system, no?\"\" 'Facilitation fees.' \"\"Facilitation?\" said\nanother. \"That's old school. Everyone knows that means 'bribe.' Use 'bush\nclearing.' If anyone asks 'where's the evidence of this bush' you can say 'It\nwas cleared.' Or 'Pest control': if anyone asks you say 'we had a huge\ninfestation, but now, as you can see, the pest control was very effective.' \"\nEveryone laughed.But are bribes bad? If you were driving a truckload of food\nto starving people and at a police check point they asked for $1 or else turn\naround and let people starve. Is that wrong? wouldn't it be wrong not to pay?\nWhat if you were bringing food to hungry people and the bribe was $10? Where\nis the line?And considering the police man makes $150/month and has a wife and\nchildren to take care of, is it really wrong to pay him on a \"base plus\ncommission\" structure?And considering he paid a bribe to become a police\nofficer.And considering democracy could be considered modern\ncolonialism...This is not such a hypothetical example. It is argued (by Alex\nde Waal in Famine Crimes: Politics and the Disaster Relief Industry in Africa)\nthat the genocide in Darfur was funded by International NGOs and multi-\nlaterals like the UN; they paid Khartoum for \u201cpermits\u201d to treat the people\nthat Khartoum was killing. If the big NGOs are giving bribes why are\nentrepreneurs held to a different standard?Until I became more African I\nrealized I could never compete head-to-head in the business world with my\ngroup mates.In a tale as old as the continent, white boy tries to change\nAfrica; Africa changes white boy.Westerners want Africa to transition from a\ntransition from a traditional patronage system to democracy, as if it\u2019s a\nbinary thing. But what if a third option is possible?Want more fundraising\nadvice no one else is talking about?
