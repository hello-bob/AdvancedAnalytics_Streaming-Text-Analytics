The acquisition\nwill create a combined company boasting a fleet of some 100 multi-ton\nsatellites in geostationary orbit, a ring of spacecraft located more than\n22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. This will be more\nthan twice the size of the fleet of the next-largest commercial geostationary\nsatellite operator.\n\nThe problem is that demand is waning for communication services through large\ngeostationary (GEO) satellites. There are some large entrenched customers,\nlike video media companies and the military, that will continue to buy telecom\ncapacity on geostationary satellites. But there's a growing demand among\nconsumers, and some segments of the corporate and government markets, for the\ntypes of services offered by constellations of smaller satellites flying\ncloser to Earth.\n\nThe biggest of these constellations, by far, is SpaceX's Starlink network,\nwith more than 5,800 active satellites in its low-Earth orbit fleet a few\nhundred miles above Earth. Each of the Starlink satellites is smaller than a\nconventional geostationary platform but linked together with laser\ncommunication terminals; thousands of these spacecraft pack enough punch to\neclipse the capacity of Internet networks anchored by geostationary\nsatellites. Starlink now has more than 2.6 million subscribers, according to\nSpaceX.\n\nSatellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) offer some advantages over geostationary\nsatellites. Because they are closer to users on the ground, low-Earth orbit\nsatellites provide signals with lower latency. The satellites for these\nconstellations can be mass-produced at relatively low cost compared to a\nsingle geostationary satellite, which often costs $250 million or more to\nbuild and launch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In a fast-moving and competitive satellite communication industry, this\ntransaction expands our multi-orbit space network, spectrum portfolio, ground\ninfrastructure around the world, go-to-market capabilities, managed service\nsolutions, and financial profile,\" said Adel Al-Saleh, CEO of SES, in a\nstatement announcing the acquisition of Intelsat.\n\n## A trend of consolidation\n\nSome of the largest legacy operators in geostationary orbit have made moves\nover the last decade to respond to the new competition.\n\nThe only operational low-Earth orbit Internet constellation besides Starlink\nwas launched by OneWeb, which primarily sells capacity to existing Internet\nproviders, who then distribute services to individual consumers. This is in\ncontrast to SpaceX's approach with Starlink providing services directly to\nhomes and businesses.\n\nEutelsat, the third-largest operator of geostationary satellites, merged with\nOneWeb last year, creating a company with a blended offering of GEO and LEO\nservices. Viasat, a pioneer in satellite Internet services using dedicated\nspacecraft in geostationary orbit, last year purchased Inmarsat, which\nspecialized in providing connectivity to airplanes and ships.\n\nSES's acquisition of Intelsat stands apart due to the size of their satellite\nfleets. Founded in 1985, SES currently operates 43 geostationary satellites,\nplus 26 broadband spacecraft in medium-Earth orbit (MEO) a few thousand miles\nabove Earth. These MEO satellites operate in a kind of middleground between\nLEO and GEO satellites, offering lower latency than geostationary networks\nwhile still flying high enough to not require hundreds or thousands of\nspacecraft to blanket the globe.\n\nIntelsat has 57 geostationary satellites, primarily for television and video-\nrelay services. Al-Saleh said the combined company will offer coverage over 99\npercent of the world and provide services through a range of communication\nbands. For now, LEO broadband satellites in the Starlink and OneWeb networks\nbeam signals to user terminals in the Ku-band.\n\nAl-Saleh said the combined networks of SES and Intelsat will span Ka-band, Ku-\nband, X-band, C-band, UHF, and secure bands tailored for military use. \"That\ngives us a unique position in the marketplace to be able to deliver to our\nclients,\" he said.\n\nSES and Intelsat have 13 new satellites on order, including six GEO spacecraft\nand seven broadband MEO satellites. Intelsat also brings to the table access\nto OneWeb's LEO constellation. Earlier this year, Intelsat announced it\nreserved $250 million of capacity on OneWeb's network over the next six years,\nwith an option to purchase double that amount.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n62\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
