There were many state run institutions within the USSR that were tasked\nwith making IC\u2019s. These included analogs of various western parts, some with\nadditional enhancements, as well as domestically designed parts. In some ways\nthese institutions competed, it was a matter of pride, and funding to come out\nwith new and better designs, all within the confines of the Soviet system.\nThere were also the various Warsaw Pact countries (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,\nEast Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania), that were aligned with the USSR\nbut not part of it. These countries had their own IC production, outside of\nthe auspices and direction of the USSR. They mainly supplied their own local\nmarkets (or within other Warsaw Pact countries) but also on occasion provided\nICs to the USSR proper, though one would assume an assortment of bureaucratic\npaperwork was needed for such transfers.\n\nThis resulted in some countries developing similar devices, at rather\ndifferent times, or different countries focusing on different designs. East\nGermany was all in on the Z80, Romania, Poland and Czechoslovakia made clones\nof the 8080, Bulgaria, the 6800 and 6502. They were though, seperate from the\nUSSR\u2019s own institutional system, so while East Germany had a working Z80 in\nthe early 1980\u2019s the USSR did not. It is this distinction we will focus on\ntoday\n\nThis article is largely from guest author Vladimir Yakovlev, translated from\nRussian, and edited/expanded by me.\n\nBy the end of the 80s \u2013 beginning of the 90s, clones of the British Sinclair\nZX Spectrum computer, a simple, cheap computer with a huge library of games\noriginally released in 1982, were being distributed in the USSR. The\n\u201cstrapping\u201d of the central processor instead of the original ULA microcircuit\nwas done on small logic microcircuits of the 555 (74LS) series and the like,\nbut the Z80 itself had to be bought from abroad. Naturally, the thought arose,\nto start making the processor yourself. After all, the processor itself,\ndeveloped in 1976 for the microelectronic industry, was not too complicated.\n\nIn 1990, the development of an analogue of the Z80 was organized in Zelenograd\nnear Moscow at the Scientific Research Institute of Precise Technology (NIITT)\nand the \u201cAngstrem\u201d plant. Initially, Zelenograd was conceived as a center of\nthe textile industry, but was later reoriented to the development of\nelectronics and microelectronics by Nikita Kruschev after he visited Silicon\nValley (California, USA) in 1959. To this day, Zelenograd has retained the\nstatus of a scientific center and the informal name \u201cRussian Silicon Valley\u201d.\n\nThe chief designer was appointed Yuri Otrokhov, who had previously led similar\ndevelopments. Otrokhov, who served as a tanker in his youth (military service\nbeing mandatory in the USSR), called the project the T34 microprocessor.\n\nOtrokhov: \u201cT-34VM1 is the internal designation of the KR1858VM1 processor,\nassigned by me at the stage of development and production in honor of my first\ntank, on which I learned to drive.\u201d\n\nHere is one of the versions of the creation of the clone, outlined by one of\nthe employees of NIITT at that time, Boris Malashevich [1]:\n\n\u201cOtrokhov, like his colleagues in the department, knew how to develop original\nmicroprocessors, but they had not yet had to reproduce analogs. Therefore, the\ndevelopers included specialists from NIITT divisions who are able to restore\nthe electrical circuit of the IC according to its topology. For 9 months after\nfour iterations, they managed to make an NMOS microprocessor T34VM1\n(KM1858VM1, KR1858VM1) \u2013 a complete analogue of the Z80A microprocessor, to be\nmade using a 2-micron technology\u201d (The original Zilog version was on a 4\nmicron process).\n\nWhile Otrokhov and his team worked at Angstrem to make a NMOS Z80, a similar\nteam was working at \u2018Transistor\u2019 in Minsk Belarus to make a CMOS version,\nlater known as the KR1858VM3.\n\nDue to the incredible popularity and demand for the Z80, many analogue\nmanufacturers worked without a license, so in total less than half of all Z-80\nproduced were licensed products from Zilog or its official partners (SGS,\nMostek, etc).\n\nFrom an interview with the creators of the Z80 [2]:\n\nFaggin: Yes, we were concerned about others copying the Z80. So I was trying\nto figure what we could do that that would be effective, and that\u2019s when I\ncame across an idea that if we use the depletion load the mask that doesn\u2019t\nleave any trace, then I could create depletion load devices that look like\nenhancement mode devices. And by doing that we could trick the customer into\nbelieving that a certain logic was implemented, when it was not. Then I told\nShima, \u201cShima, this is the idea how to implement traps. Put traps, you know,\nfigure out how to do the worst possible traps that you can imagine,\u201d and then\nShima with his mind, that was steel mind, was able to actually figure out a\nbunch of traps that he could talk about. Shima: I didn\u2019t count [on] talking\nabout that mostly. I placed six traps for stopping the copy of the layout by\nthe copy maker. And one transistor was added to existing enhancement\ntransistors. And I added a transistor looks like an enhancement transistor.\nBut if transistors are set to be always on state by the ion implantations, it\nhas a drastic effect on very much. I heard from NEC later the copy maker\ndelayed the announcement of Z80 compatible product for about six months. That\nis what I got from NEC. And finally a total transistor of Z80 became 8,200\nwhile a total of transistor of 8080 was 4,800.\n\nIn the course of the design, due to the fact that the development team had\nspecialists in both the creation of new ICs and the reproduction of analogs,\nZilog\u2019s tricks aimed at copy protection were identified and decrypted. For\nexample, the topologist saw the 3-Input-NAND Gate element, but this element\nworked as 2-Input-NAND Gate. The topology and layout of the resulting clone\nwas different, but the functionality did not differ from the original. At\nfirst, it was possible to identify such traps, making sure that the circuit\nwas inoperable, only by examining the circuit elements inside the die using\nprobe analyzers. But, having understood the principle of constructing traps, a\nmechanism for their detection was also developed. As a result, it was possible\nto make a full-fledged analog of the Z80, although the electrical circuit and\ntopology of the T34MV1 had some differences.\n\n### The German Connection\n\nIt is known that the T34VM1 and subsequent ones, produced in the USSR, contain\ndifferences in undocumented commands, which exactly coincides with the logic\nof the U880 processor from East Germany. They do not set the CY flag when the\nOUTI command is executed (by the result of adding the number issued to the\nport and the value of the L register after the operation), and the hidden\nsystem bus register, the contents of which are available through the\nundocumented flags F3 and F5, have a different logic of operation.\n\nMicroprocessor from the German Democratic Republic.\n\nMME 80A \u2013 Export Version \u2013 No Date Code\n\n\u041canufactured by VEB Mikroelektronik \u201cKarl Marx\u201d Erfurt (abbreviated as MME;\npart of Kombinat Mikroelektronik Erfurt) in the German Democratic Republic.\n\nAnd here is the microprocessor manufactured by the Angstrem plant.\n\nMME 80A CPU \u2013 Dated early 1991 \u2013 Soviet style package\n\nFirstly, the case of the microcircuit is clearly Soviet, produced by the\nSemiconductor Devices Plant (Yoshkar-Ola) [3]. And secondly, the marking\nfeatures are typical for the products of Zelenograd \u201cAngstrem\u201d.\n\nAfter some time, the marking was changed to a more familiar one.\n\nAngstrem T34VM1 \u2013 Sample Dated 9212\n\nCeramic package of the T34VM1 Z80-compatible processor, manufactured in the\nSoviet Union/Russia by Angstrem in 1992 and later years. The \u2018\u041e\u041f\u2019 marking\nmeans \u201cexperimental batch\u201d.\n\nSometimes there were more exotic markings.\n\nAngstrem T34 008 \u2013 Dated 9332\n\nThe markings suggest an 8MHz version, well within what a 2 micron process is\ncapable of\n\nThe Angstrem plant also produced many microprocessors in plastic.\n\nAngstrem KR1858VM1 \u2013 Dated 9303 \u2013 Sample\n\nAngstrem KR1858VM1 \u2013 Dated 9312 \u2013 Not marked Sample\n\nKR1858VM1 manufactured by the Angstrem plant, produced up to 9303 inclusive,\nalso is marked \u2018\u041e\u041f\u2019. The example issued 9312, no longer has such a mark.\n\nT34 die \u2013 MME U880 Rev 5\n\nLooking at the die of an early T34 marked processor it is noted that there is\nan inscription \u201cU880 / 5\u201d on the T34VM1 [4]\n\nKR1858VM1 die marked MME 1990 Rev 6 \u2013 A ~1.6x shrink of the previous version\nallowed speeds of up to 8MHz\n\nThe die of a later KR1858VM1 contains the inscriptions \u201cU880 / 6\u201d [5]\n\nThe topologists had to copy exactly the East German version one-to-one, except\nin places where it did not comply with the topological restrictions associated\nwith the NMOS manufacturing technology available at the Angstrem plant. Which\nwas eventually done. And the products themselves were made from crystals\nobtained from MME. Indeed, since Soviet times, there have been quite close\nrelationships between MME and NIITT.\n\nOn October 3, 1990, the unification of Germany took place. Stocks of finished\ndies had been accumulated at MME. But the question of patent purity\nimmediately appeared (now joining the West Zilog could have pressed claims of\ncopyright infringement, they ended up not, and Germany continued to make the\nunlicensed U880 with Zilog even using Thesys as a distributor). Most likely\nthe dies and photomasks were transferred to the Soviet Union even before this\nevent. This allowed Angstrem to use MME dies while they finished work on their\nown version.\n\nTowards the end of 1993 Angstrem began making clones using its own photomasks.\nThe inscription U880 disappeared from the die. An image of a heart appeared in\nthe center.\n\nAngstrem die \u2013 Later version with a heart in the middle, and limited other\nmarkings\n\nAngstrem continued to make Z80s through the 1990\u2019s.\n\nAngstrem KR1858VM1 from 1995\n\nOther former Soviet institutions also made clones of the Z80, including Kvazar\n(in Kiev Ukraine) and Electronica (now VSP-Mikron). Details on these are\nlacking greatly, but looking at a die from an early 1993 version of a\nElectronica T34 we see a very similar die to that of the Angstrem, including\nthe heart in the middle of it as well. Dies of the Kvazar look similar to the\nearly Angstrem versions, but lack the heart in the middle of the die. It\u2019s\npossible Angstrem supplied dies (or masks) to other institutions as well.\n\nUnfortunately Angstrem is no more, being hit hard by US Sanctions it was taken\nover by the VEB bank in 2019.\n\nIf you have more info/details that can further fill in some of the blanks\n(especially about Electronica/Kvazar versions) drpop us a line.\n\n[1]. https://www.electronics.ru/journal/article/477 [2].
