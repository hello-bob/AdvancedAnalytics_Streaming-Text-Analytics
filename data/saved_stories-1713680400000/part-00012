I'm Meghna Chakrabarti. Paul Rinaldi is\nour guest today. He's a longtime air traffic controller. President emeritus of\nthe National Air Traffic Controllers Association and president of Rinaldi\nConsultants. And he joins us from Washington. Paul, welcome to On Point.\n\nPAUL RINALDI: Hello, Meghna. How are you?\n\nCHAKRABARTI: I'm doing well. How many years were you in the business as an\nactive air traffic controller?\n\nRINALDI: Just over 30, short of 31.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: 31. So I'm speaking to a true veteran here.\n\nRINALDI: Yes.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: We asked you on the show today, to help us decipher some of the\ncommunications between pilots and air traffic control on a particular day in\nAustin, Texas.\n\nSo we're about to hear bits of a recording from February 4th, just after 6:30\na.m. on a foggy morning in Austin. And the entire interaction is about four\nminutes long. We're going to hear significant sections of it, and here's how\nit starts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFEDEX PILOT: Austin Tower, FedEx 1432 heavy passing 5.4 for the CAT III ILS\n18L.\n\nAUSTIN TOWER: FedEx 1432 heavy, Austin Tower, 18L. RVR: Touchdown 1400,\nmidpoint 600, rollout 1800. 18L, clear to land.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So Paul, this sounds like information between a pilot and the\ntower about a plane approaching for a landing.\n\nRINALDI: Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. FedEx is telling the pilot, the tower, that\nthey're going to do a CAT III approach, which is the most intense approach.\n\nIt's an instrument landing approach, an ILS approach that either has a very\nlow decision height and decision height is when the pilot has to make a\ndecision. If he sees the grounds, sees the runway or he goes around. So he's\ntelling the tower that \"We're on a cat three approach.\n\nWe're five miles out.\" And the tower is actually giving the information. RVR\nis Runway Visual Range. So the tower is telling the pilot exactly what the\nrange is, visual range on the runway, and he gives the touchdown, the midpoint\nand the rollout.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: And the 1,400, 600, what units are those?\n\nRINALDI: In feet.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: In feet. Okay.\n\nRINALDI: 1,400 feet.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Got it. So we're going to have a very a complex landing requiring\na lot of skill from the pilot.\n\nRINALDI: Absolutely.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: We have affirmation from Austin Tower. One quick thing, just as\nan aside when FedEx identifies itself as FedEx 1432 heavy, the heavy indicates\nthat it's like, what, a 737?\n\nRINALDI: No, heavy. Yeah, I don't know the type of aircraft. It's probably, so\nheavy is the weight of the aircraft has a maximum, minimum takeoff weight of\n300,000 pounds or more. It's usually a wide body, is probably Boeing 767\nBoeing 777. I'm pretty sure that's what FedEx uses for their wide bodies.\n\nAnd the reason you say heavy is because it leaves a wake much like a big boat\nin the water leaves a very big wake when it's going fast. Through the sky,\nheavy aircraft will leave a big wake and you want to make sure, they use that\nso that there is a warning of anyone that's going to fly behind heavy.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay. Okay. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. One more thing about\nthis first interaction. Austin Tower says 18L, one eight left. That's an\nimportant designation.\n\nRINALDI: Correct.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: What is it?\n\nRINALDI: That's the runway. Austin has parallel runways. one eight left, one\neight right. So when he says, \"You're clear to land runway 18L.\"\n\nHe's telling the pilot, \"You're lined up for the right runway. This is the\nrunway you're going to land on.\" That's why the approach is being done. So\nit's really, it's a confirmation back and forth between the pilot and the\ncontroller.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Which is standard practice to be sure everyone's --\n\nRINALDI: Absolutely\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Understood each other correctly. Got it.\n\nRINALDI: Correct. Yes.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay. So that's the setup for the approach that FedEx 1432 is\ngoing to take. And then in the recording of the interaction, we hear another\nvoice coming in, and it's from a different pilot.\n\nSOUTHWEST PILOT: Tower, Southwest 708, we\u2019re short of 18L and we\u2019re ready.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, so that's obviously a Southwest Airlines flight, 708.\n\nRINALDI: Which is a Boeing 737, for sure.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay.\n\nRINALDI: Because that's all they fly.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Got it. So then we hear 18L again.\n\nRINALDI: Correct.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Meaning the same runway?\n\nRINALDI: Yes. It's very common for controllers to use the same runway for\narrivals and departures. And I don't know the exact situation in Austin, but\nmaybe they only have RVR Runway Visual Range readings on 18L, and that would\nbe one of the main reasons you would use this. Because obviously the fog is\nvery thick, the ceiling is very low, so you want to be able to give the pilot\nthe most information about the situation, and that's why you would use\n\nRunway 18L and give the RVR readings.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, yeah, so I'm glad that you specified that because, of\ncourse, to my untrained ear, I was wondering if that was the moment where\nsomething had already gone wrong. Because we have a flight scheduled for\ntakeoff and one for landing using the same runway, but that's not where, that\nsounds like it's common,\n\nRINALDI: Very common.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay. Okay. So then after that, here is the reply that the\nSouthwest flight gets from the tower.\n\nAUSTIN TOWER: Southwest 708, Austin Tower. Runway 18L. RVR 1200, midpoint 600,\nrollout 1600. Fly heading 170. Runway 18L, cleared for takeoff. Traffic three-\nmiles final is a heavy B767.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, so here, based on what you said before, Paul, we have the\nAustin Tower giving sort of how much visual range that there is on runway 18L\nto the Southwest flight. Then at the end of that cut, the tower says, \"Traffic\nthree miles final is a heavy Boeing 747.\" So he's telling him that there's the\nFedEx flight out there?\n\nRINALDI: Yep. That's common, right? You let them know. This is what I would\ncall a squeeze play. We would run squeeze plays on a regular basis. We\nnormally wouldn't do it in this weather. That's the first thing that pops up.\nThere's, you're not sitting with 30 departures that time in the morning.\n\nIt's a judgment call, most controllers would sit and wait and make sure that\nFedEx would land safely, on the CAT III approach. There's also some\nrequirements to keep the ILS critical area, the instrument landing system\narea, clear while they're doing such a precision approach as a CAT III\napproach.\n\nYeah, I think we could always Monday morning quarterback, but I'm sure that\ncontroller thinks if I could do it over again, I would probably just let\nSouthwest wait until FedEx landed.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay. So then moving on in the recording. We're going to come\nback to that squeeze play in just a second, Paul, but here's how Southwest 708\nreplies.\n\nSOUTHWEST: Okay. Fly heading 170 and cleared for takeoff 18L. Copy the\ntraffic, Southwest 708.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, interesting, so the pilot, the Southwest pilot there is\nsaying he copies the traffic, meaning he understood the message about the\nBoeing 767 three miles out. Okay, now here, a little bit later, after a few\nseconds of silence the FedEx pilot comes back in.\n\nFEDEX PILOT: Tower confirm FedEx 1432 heavy is cleared to land on 18L?\n\nAUSTIN TOWER: FedEx 1432 heavy, that is affirmative. Runway 18L, you are\ncleared to land. Traffic departing prior to your arrival is a B737.\n\nFEDEX PILOT: Roger.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: I want to understand this, Paul.\n\nRINALDI: All situational awareness right there, right? Okay. FedEx is\nquestioning, that pilot has a display in their cockpit, they could see, they\nhave their own radar and ADS-B is broadcasting. So they could see that\nSouthwest is taking the runway. Southwest knows there's a heavy three mile\nfinal. So just the way that controller would say it, it's almost a key to tell\nSouthwest, take this on a roll.\n\nYou got to move quickly. It's a three-mile final. I want to get you out. So\neverybody has the information. Which and then the controller comes back and\nsays, \"Yep, there's a departure prior to arrival and you're still clear to\nland.\"\n\nCHAKRABARTI: It's interesting because I'm still struggling to hear, you\nmentioned where the first anomaly might've happened regarding that squeeze\nplay, but not long after this, that moment of situational awareness that you\njust described.\n\nWe hear this.\n\nFEDEX: Southwest abort. FedEx is on the go.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, so that's the FedEx pilot, if I understand correctly,\ntalking directly to the Southwest pilot?\n\nRINALDI: Which is, 31 years of experience. That's really unusual. I don't ever\nremember a pilot issuing a control instruction. Now, but the pilot, it wants\nto make this go around as safe as possible.\n\nAnd he knows that Southwest took a while to spool up and start going, which is\ncommon first thing in the morning. This was the first flight in the morning.\nSo they do some runaway checks, and they do a run up, what they would call\nwith their engines, to make sure everything's functioning properly.\n\nAnd then they start their departure roll. FedEx was getting very uncomfortable\nthat Southwest is still on the runway. And that he's approaching the\nsituation. He knows that if he goes around, he's going to go runway heading\nand climb, because that's probably the missed departure, or the go around\nroute that he has to take.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo FedEx knows he's got to climb and go runway heading and he knows this is\ngoing to be a departure climbing run underneath them. That's why FedEx goes,\n\"Avoid.\" Now I don't know the situation where the controller is at this point.\nIt's important to give the controller some, maybe he's doing some collateral\nduties.\n\nIt's first thing in the morning, setting up for the day. And he gave all the\ninformation, cleared Southwest, cleared FedEx, thinking everything's good. The\nimportant thing to know is there is no ground radar here. There's no ASDE-X or\nASSC program that has separation logic that would alert the controller that\nyou have a situation here, and you need to take control of the situation.\n\nSo it's unfortunate that the pilot of FedEx takes control of the situation.\nBut thank God he does at this time, because he's basically saved the day.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay. So there's more to this recording that we're going to hear\nafter the break that we're going to take here. But obviously this is an\nexample of what turned out to be a near miss. Everything, everyone landed and\ntook off safely. We should say that, just before people get nervous, but it\nwas a near miss. And the fact is that the number of near misses or the\npercentage of near misses in the United States in American aviation has been\nrising and quite dramatically in the past several years.\n\nPart II\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Before we get into the reasons why we're seeing an increased\nnumber of near misses, I want to finish up the interaction that we're\nanalyzing between a Southwest flight, a FedEx flight and Austin Air Traffic\nControl in Texas from earlier this year. So Paul, where we left off was the\nFedEx flight telling the Southwest flight directly to abort, because FedEx was\ncoming in for its landing.\n\nSouthwest was still in the process of taking off. And things looked very hairy\nthere for a moment. In the air traffic control recording, this is what we hear\nnext.\n\nTOWER: Southwest 708, roger, you can turn right when able.\n\nSOUTHWEST PILOT: Negative.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, so that's the tower telling Southwest 708, \"You can turn\nright,\" and the Southwest pilot's saying, \"That's not possible.\"\n\nNow, Paul, from the FAA's subsequent investigation, we know that at this point\nthe planes were Perhaps 100 feet or less apart. The next thing we hear is a\ncommand from the controller.\n\nAUSTIN TOWER: FedEx 1432, climb and maintain 3000. When able you can turn left\nheading 080.\n\nFEDEX: Turn 080, 3000. FedEx 1432 heavy.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, so that's interaction with the FedEx 1432 flight.\n\nAnd then quickly after that we hear:\n\nAUSTIN TOWER: Southwest 708, you can turn left heading 170. FedEx 1432, turn\nleft heading 360, contact approach on the 125.32.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, so Paul, what is the Austin Tower telling both of these\nflights right now, in that critical second?\n\nRINALDI: When he says unable, Southwest doesn't take the first turn, I'm\nassuming, after looking at the simulation, the timing is correct.\n\nIt looks like Southwest is still on the ground. It's obviously not going to\ntake a turn in the air, right? Because he's still on the ground. And FedEx was\nright in trying to stop, although it's very unconventional. Like I said, I\ndon't ever remember a pilot taking control of another flight. But FedEx was\ntrying to stop that, knowing that they were both going to fly over the runway.\n\nOne was going to be on the ground taking off. One is landing maybe 150 to 170\nmiles an hour, while one is standing still, starting to speed up. And three\nmiles is faster than 170 miles an hour, right? So you just know that this is a\nvery close one and looking at the situation, not a lot of things scare me.\n\nI've seen a lot, I've been involved in a lot over the years. This one was very\nclose. And the sad thing about this is if we had, if Austin Tower had the\nground radar program that they should have, this could, this would not even\nhave been an issue. Now, granted, we can question the controller's\nperformance.\n\nWe can question Southwest's performance of taking that runway, knowing there's\nthree miles out, and knowing they had to do it. It was going to be a little\nbit, a little time to do a run up. But the system's built on controllers and\npilots communicating with each other, sharing information, and relying on each\nother.\n\nAnd there by the grace of God, the FedEx pilot really did a fantastic job.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: It sounds like what you're saying is that we have controllers and\npilots relying on each other based on the information that they have, right?\nAnd that the ground radar could have given everybody more information at the\ntime.\n\nBut I want to just play the last little bit of this interaction. So after\nthose directives given by Austin Tower. Somehow, the FedEx plane manages to\nland safely.\n\nFEDEX PILOT: FedEx 1432 is exiting L.\n\nAUSTIN TOWER: FedEx 1432 heavy. Roger, report clear of the runway. You can\njoin B and contact Ground on .9.\n\nFEDEX PILOT: We\u2019ll join B, Ground.9. And FedEx 1432 heavy is clear of the\nrunway.\n\nAUSTIN TOWER: FedEx 1432 heavy, roger, sir. You have our apologies. We\nappreciate your professionalism.\n\nFEDEX: Thank you.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: First of all, I just want to note, as a civilian flyer, not a\npilot, but a passenger myself frequently, I am always deeply grateful and\nimpressed by the calm professionalism in every one of these interactions\nkeeping us safe in the skies.\n\nWe hear every person in this tape being the consummate professional, but Paul,\nfrom the perspective of the controller, put yourself in his shoes for a\nmoment. Like what just happened from his perspective?\n\nRINALDI: You could hear it in his voice. At least I can. His cadence has\nchanged tremendously.\n\nHe thanked him for his professionalism. He knows that was way too close for\ncomfort for anybody. And that should have never happened. And, like I said,\nyou can Monday morning quarterback. You're not supposed to roll southwest in\nthat situation. You're just, you're supposed to let FedEx land.\n\nIt's an ILS critical area you need to protect. The fog is super thick. I think\nit even went down from the time that FedEx got his runaway visual range, I\nthink it was 1,400, to the time Southwest was taking off it was 1,200, so it\nwent down 200 feet. These things you all have to take into account, and you\ncould hear in the controller's voice. Like yeah, not my best decision,\ncertainly not my best day. And what you really, you know, as a controller in\nthat situation, everything is report your role. And if he would have just said\nsomething like report your role, he would have saw that Southwest was going to\nget eaten up on the runway by FedEx.\n\nBecause he didn't roll right away. And first thing in the morning, they're not\ngoing to roll right away. They have to do, they have to do their checklist and\nthey have to do their engine run up. So that's just common. I don't know if\nthis controller has a lot of experience, but that's just normal operation,\n\"Don't bet on the come.\"\n\nThat's the famous word of air traffic control. When you train somebody, \"Don't\nbet on the come.\" Control the situation and there was a lack of control and a\nlack of judgment on the controller's part. Okay.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Thank you for that, Paul, because people who are flying in these\naircraft don't get to hear this stuff.\n\nAnd this gave us a clear picture into, in fact, a bunch of the things I'd say\nthat have been going on underneath the surface when it comes to aviation\nsafety in this country. You mentioned technology. Maybe experience, because a\nlot of air traffic controllers are retiring. We're going to talk about all of\nthese in just a moment. Because according to some reporting from the New York\nTimes and the FAA itself, the number of near misses in this country has gone\nup 25% in the past several years.\n\nNow let's put that in context. We're talking about several hundred, perhaps,\nin the past couple of years out of what 10 million passenger flights every\nyear. So I want to put that in a little context. But of course, aviation is\nsuch a particular industry that given the catastrophes that can happen, if\nthere are airplane collisions, we want that number of near misses to be zero,\nnot growing.\n\nSo Paul Rinaldi, hang on for just a second. I want to bring Dorothy Robyn into\nthe conversation. She's also in Washington. She's a senior fellow at Boston\nuniversity. Institute for Global Sustainability and served as aviation point\nperson in the Clinton White House. Dorothy, welcome to you.\n\nDOROTHY ROBYN: Thank you, Meghna.\n\nGreat to be here.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: I'm really glad to have both of you because now let's get into\nthe sort of deeper analysis here that's revealed or that we should be talking\nabout after understanding that tape that Paul walked us through. First of all,\nit seems as if things have been boiling under the surface for, what, 20, 30,\nmaybe even 40 years, that are perhaps just coalescing right now in the number\nof near misses that we're seeing, Dorothy.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nROBYN: I think there is a short-term problem and a longer-term problem. I\nthink in the near term, the number of near misses probably reflects the fact\nthat we have a post pandemic fairly dramatic increase in air travel. And at\nthe same time, so air travel is going up at the same time, the traditional\nexperience level of pilots and controllers is going down, because so many\npilots retired or took a buyout during the pandemic, and because we have a\nshortage of controllers. So I think that is a near term issue. But I think the\nlack of technology at the Austin airport, the shortage of controllers. Those\nare chronic problems.\n\nThose go back to weaknesses in the U.S. air traffic control system that's been\ngoing on for decades.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, so let's talk about the controller shortage for a few\nminutes more. Paul, walk me through a couple of the rules around air traffic\ncontrols. There's a mandatory retirement age, right?\n\nRINALDI: That's correct. Age 56 is the mandatory retirement age, unless the\nFAA issues you a waiver and you want a waiver. And that waiver is for only one\nyear. You have to make sure you maintain your medical security and all your\nbackground checks are up to snuff, so to speak.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, 56. So does that mean that we're seeing like a bump now in\nretirements because of the, I don't know, the average age or median age of an\nair traffic controller.\n\nRINALDI: One of the reasons I retired is because I reached age 56. And I think\nthat it's a very stressful occupation and you could just from that Austin\nevent, you just hope this controller can recover from something like that.\nBecause you could see it, or you can hear it in his voice that, that was a bad\none.\n\nThose type of things will stay with you the rest of your career. And you just\nhave to be able to navigate through that. Most controllers do not make it to\nage 56. They can go with 20 years' experience at age 50. Or they can go 25\nyears of on the job, at any age, and a lot of them just go because it is a lot\nof stress, and you're working nights, you're working weekends, you're working\nholidays, and It's a very demanding job.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, so Dorothy, again, about the number of air traffic\ncontrollers currently in the system. We'll talk a little bit more later about\nwhy Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says they are, what, some 3,000\nshort of the ideal number. But I want to actually go back in time for a\nmoment/ Because many listeners might remember that back in 1981, air traffic\ncontrollers went on strike.\n\nThey walked off the job striking for better pay and working conditions. And\nPresident Ronald Reagan really vowed to crush that strike.\n\nPRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: I must tell those who failed to report for duty this\nmorning, they are in violation of the law. And if they do not report for work\nwithin 48 hours, they have forfeited their jobs.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So Reagan ultimately followed through on that threat, firing more\nthan 11,000 air traffic controllers, and Dorothy, that makes me presume that\nmany more had to be hired in a shortish period of time and is part of what\nwe're seeing. That those people hired right after 1981 or thereafter are aging\nout?\n\nROBYN: Paul may be a better person to answer that, but I do think you have\nseen, there are so many controllers who are hired after the PATCO firing. And\nyou've seen that cohort go through and many of them retire at a similar time.\nSo I don't know how much that, I think you can, I think the shortage is more\nthan that, but I think that contributes to it.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Paul, do you want to just give us your quick take on that?\n\nRINALDI: Sure, I was actually hired 10 years to the date that Ronald Reagan\nfired the airdrop controls on August 3rd, and I aged out in 2021. Anyone that\nwas hired in that wave after the strike and after the firings were already\naged out. The interesting thing is that the agency would, because of budget\nreasons, wouldn't keep a pipeline of controllers coming into the system.\n\nThey would say they reached their number, and then they would stop hiring. And\nthat's, they've changed that mindset. Government shutdowns, threats of\ngovernment shutdowns, budget concerns, certainly COVID, all of this played\ninto the fact that you have to keep the FAA Academy open, which is in Oklahoma\nCity. And keep a pipeline going through there. Because as I said, you can't\ncount on everybody going to 56.\n\nIf they get 25 years and they're 48, they might retire or they retire at any\ntime at age 50. So those are the things you really have to, that agency has to\nfocus on. And it looks like they're actually have a different mindset now.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Just let me jump in here for a second because I just need to\nremind folks that I'm Meghna Chakrabarti and this is On Point.\n\nGo ahead, Paul, pick up your thought.\n\nRINALDI: So I just want to say, as far as the shortage, the only way to get\nhired as an air traffic control there's two ways, but the main way is a bid\nthat comes out for everybody and 50,000 people might want the job. And the FAA\nhas to figure a way to cull out that list and issue test.\n\nAnd when they get down to it, the maximum amount of seats they could put\nthrough their academy every year is 1,800. And the FAA Academy is a screen. So\nyou lose about 50% out of that 1,800. And so you're down to 900. And then you\ntalk about issues with placement, somebody from California, and they place\nthem in New York, and they don't want to go there.\n\nCertainly, once they get to the facility, there's also a washout rate of\nanother 15%, 20%. You're looking maybe about 750 out of the 1,800 three years\nlater become certified. In the meantime, the FAA is projecting to lose 1,600\nthis year.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Oh, that's interesting.\n\nRINALDI: On their best year, they're looking at a net gain of 200.\n\nBut that's their best year.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: That's their best. But in a way, the FAA prior to recent times\nhas been behaving like a lot of even corporations, just hiring when they think\nthey need them. But when you need them, it's actually too late, should have\nprepped for it a long time before that.\n\nPoint well taken, Paul. We'll talk about fixes later, but Dorothy, the other\nmajor sort of vein of reasoning behind why we're seeing those near misses,\nmore near misses now, you said was technology.\n\nROBYN: Yes.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Go ahead and elaborate on that.\n\nROBYN: Runway safety technology incursion prevention technology has come a\nlong way.\n\nArnold Barnett, who's a statistician at MIT and aviation safety expert, who\ntalks a lot about the incredible safety record in aviation. We should say\nthere has not been a commercial aircraft crash since Colgan Air in 2009. And\nthat's a remarkable record. One of the areas where there's been real\nimprovement in technology is airport surfaces where planes are a lot closer\ntogether than at any place else in the whole system.\n\nAnd the National Transportation Safety Board has told the air traffic\norganization, that part of the FAA that runs the air traffic operation, that\nthey should be deploying ASDE-X, which is I think what Paul referred to when\nhe talked about ground radar, much more rapidly. And they have not done that.\n\nI think from what the head of NTSB said at the hearing, it's largely a\nresource issue. She said, whenever I talk about technology, the FAA says we\ndon't have the resources. And she said, you need to get them the resources.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: And by the way, hearing that mentioned, was actually fairly\nrecently, there's been a lot of discussion across the course of this year\nregarding the need for technological and personnel improvements in the FAA.\n\nPart III\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Now, I just want to play a moment from hearings last week.\nDorothy, you had mentioned this, where the current president of the National\nAir Traffic Controllers Association, Rich Santa, testified on aviation safety.\nAnd he called for more funding for the FAA to upgrade its communication\ntechnology and gave folks a picture of what it's like for air traffic\ncontrollers right now at work.\n\nRICH SANTA: Last year's controllers at 40% of our facilities worked six-day\nwork weeks at least once a month. And several of our facilities require six-\nday work weeks and 10-hour days every single week. Air traffic control is\nalready a highly stressful profession, working 200 hours per month layers on\nsignificant fatigue and inserts additional risks into the NAS.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: The NAS being the National Airspace System. We wanted to get the\nperspective of a pilot. Captain Jason Ambrosi is president of the Airline\nPilots Association International. It's the union that represents more than\n70,000 pilots in the United States and Canada.\n\nAnd he told us about just how much pilots and the FAA's air traffic\ncontrollers rely on each other.\n\nJASON AMBROSI: Between the pilots and the air traffic controllers, it's truly\na partnership. You can't do this without the other. The system doesn't work\nwithout at least two well trained, qualified, and rested pilots on the flight\ndeck at any time, as well as having our brothers and sisters in air traffic\ncontrol on the ground to keep us separated and safe.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Ambrosi says that some of the challenges we've seen in the past\nthree years specifically stem from the disruption caused by COVID-19. We've\nheard that already. Air traffic contracted greatly, and a lot of workers left\nthe industry.\n\nAMBROSI: Coming out of the pandemic, there's a lot of new in the system. We\nhave, it's not just new pilots.\n\nIt's not just new controllers. It's new flight attendants. It's new mechanics.\nIt's everybody. There's a lot of new in the system. And airlines pushed a\nlittle quick coming out of the recovery. And you saw early on in the recovery,\nhow the operational reliability of the airlines suffered greatly because they\noverscheduled.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Ambrosi also agrees that at the FAA, the administration is too\nshort staffed.\n\nAMBROSI: We need more air traffic controllers. They'll tell you themselves\nthat we need more air traffic controllers. Everybody is working as hard as\nthey can. They're working a lot of overtime, and we appreciate that, but they\nneed help and reinforcements on the way.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So this issue has really taken the attention or captured the\nattention of the highest levels of America's transportation system. Because\nSecretary Pete Buttigieg said back in May that the FAA was short, is short,\nabout 3,000 controllers and he's talked a lot about that in the media since.\nHere he is on News Nation last month.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: We do see a concern in terms of the availability of enough air\ntraffic control staffers, that you have backups if somebody calls in sick, or\nif there's a lot of pressure on a particular region or tower.\n\nAnd in some areas, we're not at the staffing levels that I want us to see.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Now, we reached out to the FAA for this show. They didn't make\nanyone available for interview. They sent us a written statement, though,\nwhich includes quote, \"The FAA hires controllers annually and have for\ndecades. This year, the agency hired 1,500. Next year, we will hire 1,800.'\n\nKeep that in mind because we heard what that process actually entails from\nPaul Rinaldi and the dropout rate in that hiring process. Now more\nfundamentally, Captain Jason Ambrosi says that the FAA needs funding not just\nto continue day to day operations now, but to invest in the future.\n\nAMBROSI: We need long term stable funding for the FAA. So that we can get\ntechnology in place that assists pilots and controllers to move forward.\nSeveral airports have, for example, ground surveillance radar, and it helps\ncontrollers identify where airplanes are, but not all airports have it.\n\nThere's also simple things like runway status lights. So runway status lights,\nit's a mechanical system that basically just, if somebody crosses a line, it\nputs a red light on and says, \"Don't take off.\" So it's something simple. It's\njust not cheap, right? Because running that wiring at all these long runways\nis not cheap.\n\nBut having those status lights is something that's easy technology that's\nreadily available, and it should be implemented essentially everywhere.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Now, we're going to get back to the current funding situation at\nthe FAA in just a quick second. But Paul, I wanted to interject here. Runway\nstatus lights.\n\nThat seems like a very, I don't want to say simple, but sensible technology.\nIs it in any U. S. airports or how many?\n\nRINALDI: It is. I don't know I have the exact number of runway status lights,\nbut it's something simple. And this Southwest/FedEx situation, that would not\nwork because of the thickness of the fog.\n\nAnd obviously the pilot has technology. You could see the FedEx pilot. Both\nCaptain Ambrosi and President Rich Santa and the Secretary, actually even the\nSecretary of Transportation. They're correct. We're short controllers. We're\nlacking in modern technology, for sure. That's been a common theme for the\nlast two decades.\n\nAnd the important thing when the FAA says they hire controllers, they do. I\ngive them full credit, they do higher controllers, but they've increased the\nnumber of certified controllers from FY 22 to FY 23. And this was in the\ntestimony last week, by six. And they're saying the best year will be\nincreased by 200.\n\nIf we're 3,000 down, and you only hire 1,800 a year. It's going to take 15\nyears to get back to normal, and that's just not acceptable. They have to\nfigure a different way to hire controllers. We have college initiative\ntraining programs in Embry-Riddle, in Vaughn College, in UND, throughout the\nwhole country and they used to use them as a valuable resource, and they\nstopped it.\n\nThey need to get back to that and augment the 1,800 that are going through\nOklahoma City Academy and use them as a screen type facility and get them in\nour facilities. We need the help. We need the help now.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay so all of this, or so much of this, comes down to funding.\nNow, I'll be the first to say that not every government dollar is spent in the\nbest way possible, but the funding question seems to be very urgent here,\nbecause in April, back in April, when the House voted to raise the U.S. debt\nlimit and ensure that the government can't pay its bills, House Republicans\nattached deep cuts to domestic spending, including a potential 8% cut to the\nFAA. Now, to be fair, those cuts are unlikely to pass the Senate. They will\ncertainly be vetoed by President Biden, if they ever made it that far.\n\nBut yesterday, the House passed yet another continuing resolution to narrowly\navoid a government shutdown. So it'll keep the government open until January\nand February of next year, depending on the agency. That just happened\nyesterday. So a narrow avoiding of a government shutdown. But that also means\nthat the debate over federal spending cuts is going to come back again in the\nbeginning of 2024.\n\nAnd just this month, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg described the\nimpact targeted spending cuts could have on the FAA if they passed.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: To absorb the 8% cut that they have proposed, we would have to\ntotally freeze FAA hiring in operations and facilities. We'd be set back in\nmodernizing systems like the NOTAM system that led to nationwide havoc with\njust a 90-minute outage earlier this year, and what's especially galling is\nthat we see some of the same elected officials who have responded even to\nweather delays by blaming the administration. Now turning around and demanding\nthat we cut resources for air traffic control.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Now, avoiding a government shutdown, in regards to that, House\nSpeaker Mike Johnson said yesterday that he feels that making sure the\ngovernment stays open is a matter of conscience for all members of Congress,\nbut he added that he's not going to support another stopgap measure to keep\nthe government open without the cuts that House Republicans have demanded, and\nhe said, quote, \"We're not surrendering. But you have to choose the fights you\ncan win,\" end quote.\n\nOkay, Dorothy we're always looking for solutions here because one thing, one\nthing is for certain, as a federal agency, the FAA is always going to have to\nbear the stress of appropriations. So is there a way to insulate air traffic\ncontrol from the vagaries of government decision making?\n\nROBYN: Meghna, there is a better way. There really is, and we only have to\nlook at Canada to see it. Let me, the air traffic control system is not\ninherently governmental. Doing what Paul did for 30 years is not an inherently\ngovernmental activity. It's safety critical. It's very sophisticated, but the\nsame can be said of building a Boeing 787 or operate in an airline.\n\nThese are things that are done by the private sector, subject to regulation by\nthe FAA. That's number one. Number two, precisely because operating the air\ntraffic control system is operational/commercial in nature. We do it very\npoorly, because we do it out of a traditional government agency, a regulatory\nagency.\n\nThey are subject to the whims of Congress because that's where they get their\nappropriation. The FAA is like a green plant that moves toward the sun. They\ntreat Congress as their customer rather than airline operators, much less the\ntraveling public. They are subject to the stop and go nature of government, of\nthe government budget process.\n\nThey are subject to all of the crazy things that are unavoidable for most\ngovernment activities, but are avoidable.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So I hear you creeping towards the let's just get air traffic\ncontrol out of the FAA.\n\nROBYN: Yeah, yes, exactly.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Privatization, corporatization, whatever you want to call it.\n\nROBYN: Yeah, I prefer corporatization.\n\nThe P word became a pejorative in the most recent debate. We tried to do this\nin the Clinton administration. We tried to spin it off as a government\ncorporation with a board, and a CEO and the ability to borrow money from\ntreasury or go to private debt markets, hugely important.\n\nYou're talking about 20-year investments. You can't make those kind of\ninvestments if you're a government agency, you have to pay for things up\nfront, nor can you make the kind of incremental improvements that air traffic\ncontrol needs. Our proposal was dead on arrival. There was a more sustained,\nnearly successful effort in 2018 led by Bill Shuster, the chairman of the\nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n\nPaul and I testified twice, but that, too, was unsuccessful.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay, let me jump in here. Paul, I want to just get your quick\ntake on this. Maybe Dorothy already gave us a hint of what it might be. As an\nactual air traffic controller, do you see the idea of pulling air traffic\ncontrol out of the regulatory, out of the FAA as a regulatory organization, a\nplausible or even favorable idea.\n\nRINALDI: I supported it in 2018 because you could see exactly, we're not able,\neveryone likes to throw around the FAA is the gold standard in aviation. We\nhave the best air traffic controllers in the world, without a doubt, certainly\nthe best pilots and the best airlines in the world, but we're not the gold\nstandard anymore when it comes to our air traffic control equipment.\n\nIt's aging. It needs to be replaced. You heard on the beginning, our\ninformation systems are updated with, some of them with floppy disks. You\ncan't even turn them off. They're on 3, 6 computers.\n\nWe're walking around our towers with paper strips and Canada's, the UK system,\nAustralia, New Zealand, they've all pulled the operation, the ATO, I call it\nthe ANSP. They pulled it away from the regulatory and the oversight and made\nits own structure. When you buy an airline ticket, you pay a lot of taxes.\nThose taxes go to airport airways trust fund. That trust fund funds the FAA at\nroughly about 90%, 95%.\n\nYou could use that to actually run an organization and it doesn't have to be\nprivate. It could be corporate. It could be, it could even be in government.\nJust can't be subject to the whims of who's in the White House or who's\ncontrolling Congress and the budget. They need money to modernize their system\nor else. In 2018, I stood up for and said do you still support it?\n\nI go, the system, there's alarms going off everywhere about our system. Now's\nthe time to actually address it while they have an FAA reauthorization bill on\nthe table. Say, we've got to do something here. Something serious is about to\nhappen.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Oh my gosh, you're describing a floppy disks and paper\nstrips.\n\nMade me like half wonder if we're having Fortran as a public, as a programming\nlanguage still at the FAA.\n\nRINALDI: Not too long ago it was, just so we're clear.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay. But Dorothy, before we we're running out of time, and I\nwanted to just a quick check on something. You mentioned that just look to the\nnorth in Canada, they've essentially done what you're talking about, but what\nit comes down to is safety record.\n\nDo they have an acceptable safety record even with this different organization\nof their air traffic control?\n\nROBYN: Absolutely. Yes. No, I think safety has only gone up, 60 plus countries\nhave now taken the air traffic operation out of the traditional regular civil\naviation regulatory agency and made it a independent business-like entity.\n\nCanada has a unique model, which I particularly like, but safety has only\nimproved. In fact, right now, I should be explicit. The FAA is both operating\nand regulating the air traffic control system. That is a conflict of interest,\nand it violates a directive from the International Civil Aviation\nOrganization, which is the body that aviation authorities look to for\nguidance.\n\nSo can I just read you a sentence from a column by Scott McCartney who was the\naviation, he wrote the Middle Seat column in the Wall Street Journal for many\nyears, and he is a general aviation pilot and he said that \"Flying north to\nsouth over the U. S. Canadian border is like time travel for pilots, as you\nleave a modern air traffic control system run by a company and enter one run\nby the government struggling to catch up.\"\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Wow. Okay. We have 30 seconds left. I always do this and my staff\nlaughs at me. I'm going to ask a big question. What do you see right now,\nDorothy, as preventing even people in government from listening to an idea\nlike this?\n\nROBYN: The impediment, for as for as long as I've known, is it hasn't been\nlabor.\n\nIt has been general aviation and specifically business aviation, the National\nBusiness Aviation Association, the 0.1% that fly 100 million gulf streams and\npay very paltry fees to use the system.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: I see. So the fees for aviation operators would be part of how a\nprivatized or corporatized air traffic control system would work.\n\nOkay. Wow. It seems like we just got to the beginning of something very\ninteresting, but as both of you mentioned, like the almost immediate term\nprobably FAA has comes with the potential for more cuts or having to ask for\nmore money.\n\nThis program aired on November 15, 2023.\n\n## Related:\n\n  * Airline passengers could be in for a rougher ride, thanks to climate change\n  * A shortage of air traffic controllers is hurting safety, aviation experts warn Senate\n  * Senate votes 98-0 to confirm Biden's nominee to run the FAA\n  * A plane crash in Alaska is raising questions about aviation safety in the state\n  * Lack of air traffic controllers is industry's biggest issue, United Airlines CEO says\n  * Looking Back On When President Reagan Fired The Air Traffic Controllers\n\nDaniel Ackerman Producer Daniel Ackerman is a producer primarily working\nacross WBUR's national shows.\n\nMore...\n\nMeghna Chakrabarti Host, On Point Meghna Chakrabarti is the host of On Point.\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## More from On Point\n\nListen Live\n\nLoading...\n\nWBUR\n\n#### Contact Us\n\n(617) 353-0909\n\ninfo@wbur.org\n\n890 Commonwealth Ave. Boston, MA 02215\n\nMore ways to get in touch.\n\n#### About WBUR\n\n  * Who We Are\n  * Inside WBUR\n  * Careers\n  * WBUR Staff\n  * Community Advisory Board\n  * Board Of Directors\n  * CPB Transparency\n  * Diversity, Equity And Inclusion\n  * Licensing WBUR Content\n  * Ethics Guide\n\n#### Support WBUR\n\n  * Make A Donation\n  * Become A Member\n  * Member Services\n  * Donate Your Car\n  * Join The Murrow Society\n  * Become A Sponsor\n  * Volunteer\n\n#### Follow\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n  * Linkedin\n\n  * \u00a9 Copyright WBUR 2024\n  * WBUR Privacy Policy\n  * WBUR EEO Reports\n  * FCC Public File\n  * FCC Applications\n  * Public File Assistance\n  * Syndication\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
