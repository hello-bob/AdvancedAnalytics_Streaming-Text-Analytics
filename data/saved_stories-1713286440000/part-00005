Now it\u2019s\nattempting a comeback \u2013 banking on the fact that it hasn\u2019t changed at all\n\nKari Paul\n\nShare\n\nIn the early 2000s, Olivia Packenham would get home from school, listen to the\nfamiliar sound of the dial up tone as her family computer connected to the\ninternet, and navigate her AOL browser to the virtual gaming world of Neopets.\n\nStarting at the age of eight, Packenham played for years before losing\ninterest when she was in high school. But in December 2023, after a nearly\n15-year hiatus, she logged back on to neopets.com \u2013 and found the pets she had\nraised as a child waiting for her. Her favorite, a \u201cBruce\u201d (the Neopets\nversion of a penguin) is more than 21 years old now.\n\nOpening Neopets today feels like stepping back into that time of her life,\nPackenham says \u2013 this time without her mother yelling at her for clogging up\nthe family phone line.\n\n\u201cIt was like walking into a museum of the early 2000s internet,\u201d said\nPackenham, 32, one of thousands of players returning to Neopets in the past\nyear.\n\n> There are not many experiences in life where you can revisit your childhood\n> exactly as it was\n\nIt was no accident that Packenham returned. Neopets, which announced a bold\nrebrand in 2023, has been consciously courting its former fans with promises\nof reuniting them with old digital companions that have remained largely\nunchanged.\n\nReturning Neopians \u2013 the community name for users \u2013 cite a number of reasons\nfor their returns. One going by the username of Solabee said she had started\nplaying at age nine, and after returning had begun to play almost daily.\nNeopets\u2019 resurgence felt very specific to millennials, she said. Indeed, 40%\nof users are between the ages of 25 and 34, and the next largest demographic \u2013\n18-24 years old \u2013 is 26%. Revisiting the site recalls a more hopeful time in\ninternet history \u2013 when logging online was still unfamiliar and exciting. Many\nof the Neopians interviewed for this story asked to be quoted by username,\npreferring to keep their online personas separate from their real lives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the most nostalgic generation, so when there are big world events and\ncrises happening, we all want to revert back to the safest time of our lives \u2013\nour childhoods,\u201d Solabee said.\n\nOlivia Packenham\u2019s Neopet, a \u2018Bruce\u2019 variety that resembles a penguin.\nPhotograph: Courtesy of Olivia Packenham\n\n## Neopets\u2019 strong start and long decline\n\nNeopets was launched in 1999 as an early internet universe where users could\ncare for a variety of virtual pets and play mini games. A crude social network\nthat predated Facebook, the site allowed users to add friends, message one\nanother, trade resources or virtual currency, and battle. It peaked at more\nthan 25 million active users in the mid-2000s before seeing a steep decline in\npopularity as competing gaming and social sites exploded across the internet.\n\nThe platform has changed hands a number of times since its inception, and amid\nthe acquisitions, it languished, reporting just 100,000 users when it was\npurchased by the Chinese firm NetDragon in 2017. Deepening its decay was the\ndecline of Adobe\u2019s Flash Player \u2013 the software used to power much of the site\n\u2013 which browsers began to phase out around 2017 before the company officially\nkilled it off in 2020. Neopets fell by the wayside, receiving little attention\nor updates to its interface.\n\nThat was until the entrepreneur and investing consultant Dominic Law, who\njoined NetDragon in 2020 as director of new markets, launched an internal\ncampaign to revive the Neopets brand, which he called \u201ca major leap of faith\u201d.\nLaw, 36, remembered using Neopets to keep in touch with friends in Canada\nafter moving to Hong Kong as a child. As NetDragon shut down a handful of\nunder-performing sites it had acquired, he saw that Neopets was at risk.\n\n\u201cEven through the last decade of its downfall \u2013 the lack of updates, the death\nof flash leaving half the site non-playable \u2013 a quarter of our remaining users\nlog on every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw how tight-knit the remaining community was,\nand as a player myself I resonated with the emotional attachment that led\nthese core users to stand by Neopets. I realized this is probably the most\nsticky customer base you could find.\u201d\n\n\u2018I met my wife on LiveJournal\u2019: stories of love, friendship and joy from the\nweb\u2019s early days\n\nRead more\n\nLaw convinced the higher-ups at NetDragon to give him \u201cone last shot\u201d to save\nNeopets, orchestrating a management buyout deal that spun Neopets out into an\nindependently owned company of which he is now CEO. The move was backed by an\nundisclosed amount of outside investments. Under a group known as the Neopets\nTeam (TNT), the company has begun restoring the site\u2019s functionality, updating\nits design and improving its best-known classic games. Next, TNT hopes to\nenable more mobile capability. Though much of the site is still limping along\nwith some glitches, Law said that its failure to change with the times had\nironically become an asset.\n\n\u201cBecause of the lack of updates, we basically preserved early internet culture\nin its purest form,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people log on, the game still looks 99%\nthe same, and their pets are still there. It\u2019s like meeting back up with an\nold friend. There are not many experiences in life where you can revisit your\nchildhood exactly as it was.\u201d\n\n## The difficulty of reviving Neopia\n\nWith efforts to resuscitate Neopets ramping up, monthly users have nearly\ntripled to 300,000 in the past six months, and the company is on track to be\nprofitable by the end of 2024, Law said.\n\n\u201cI believe this is the beginning of the revival. But there is a lot more work\nto do,\u201d Law said.\n\nIn addition to prioritizing drawing lapsed users back to the site, Neopets is\nflirting with licensing its intellectual property for a trading card game and\na branded Monopoly board.\n\n\u201cWe are already on track to be profitable, but we want to make sure that is\nsustainable, and that we future-proof the IP and make sure we can survive for\nmany more years to come,\u201d Law said.\n\nAmid continuing pressure to make Neopets financially viable in the real world,\nnew leadership at the company also has to contend with the digital financial\ncomponents of the site \u2013 which runs on the virtual currency of \u201cNeopoints\u201d.\nWith few updates to the site over time, a vast black market has emerged for\ncertain pets, and the site\u2019s virtual economy has struggled with\nhyperinflation.\n\nNeopets\u2019 original logo and creatures. Photograph: Neopets\n\nNeopets runs on a complex economy made up of two main components: items and\nNeopoints. Throughout its years of disrepair, Neopets has continued to issue\nNeopoints into the virtual economy, causing the value of individual Neopoints\nto fall. Resellers have taken advantage of the volatility, selling rare items\nat inflated prices that few users can afford.\n\nSome lapsed users have returned to Neopets find that some of their assets have\nbecome extremely valuable. Others haven\u2019t been so lucky. With longtime\nNeopians sitting on stockpiles of appreciated resources, new players are at a\nmajor disadvantage. The company has sought to remedy the inflation by offering\nrandom rewards to all players and is developing other ways to level the\nplaying field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like total free capitalism without any restraints or laws,\u201d said\nPackenham. \u201cIt kind of reflects some of the real-world divides. I feel like I\nam a middle-class Neopian, and I am never going to be able to achieve what\npeople who have stockpiles of Neopoints can achieve.\u201d\n\nLaw said rebalancing the Neopets economy was a top priority for the company,\nand acknowledged that many hackers and black market traders had emerged\nbecause the site was neglected for so long. In 2022, Neopets revealed that it\nhad discovered hackers had obtained access to its databases for 18 months,\nexposing the personal information of more than 69 million members. The breach\nwas discovered when a hacker attempted to sell a Neopets database for bitcoin.\n\n## Healing the rift with Neopets fans\n\nIn the absence of upkeep on the official Neopets site, fans have made their\nown offshoots in the past decade, including fan fiction, puzzles and\nminigames. Law said that rather than cracking down on fan-created components,\nthe company is embracing them. It launched a \u201cNeopass\u201d login system that\nallows users to access games across the Neopets system, including third-party\nand fan-made games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably one of the first gaming companies to open up our system to\ncommunity projects,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many fans who have been pouring\ntheir love and passion into creating these sites and we wanted to build a\npathway for them to co-create with Neopets.\u201d\n\nThose projects are part of an \u201congoing dialogue\u201d with Neopets users that Law\nhas sought to foster since he took the helm of the company. He hosts a monthly\n\u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d thread on Reddit, where there is a very active Neopian\ncommunity, taking questions and suggestions about the future of the site.\n\nNeopets has also created an ambassador program, which chose a handful of\naccounts from dozens of applications to work directly with Neopets teams to\nimprove the site and the user experience. Similar to Reddit\u2019s volunteer\nmoderator system, the ambassador program is an unpaid opportunity for super-\nusers to have a bigger say in how the site is run.\n\nSuch efforts to connect with Neopians have given many users hope that their\nexperiences will be considered, particularly after the parent company\nexperienced major backlash over a 2021 attempt to dive into NFTs and\ncryptocurrency. One user who goes by evilfaerie said the dialogue with fans\nhad course-corrected that debacle.\n\n\u201cThe new owners seem to be actively engaging with the community,\u201d they said.\n\u201cBecause they are millennials who grew up on the site, you can see that their\nefforts are a labor of love \u2013 it makes it more meaningful.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Technology\n  * Internet\n  * Games\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
