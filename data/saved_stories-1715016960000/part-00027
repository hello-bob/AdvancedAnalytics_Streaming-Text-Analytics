It typically is used to stabilize to some\ndegree power grids, to help them stay on the grid frequency, and to serve as a\nshort-term compensation storage. Unlike common storage power plants, such as\nthe pumped storage power plants with capacities up to 1000 MWh, the benefits\nfrom flywheel storage power plants can be obtained with a facility in the\nrange of a few kWh to several tens of MWh.^[1] They are comparable in this\napplication with battery storage power plants.\n\nPossible areas of application are places where electrical energy can be\nobtained and stored, and must be supplied again to compensate for example,\nfluctuations in the seconds range in wind or solar power. These storage\nfacilities consist of individual flywheels in a modular design. Energy up to\n150 kWh can be absorbed or released per flywheel. Through combinations of\nseveral such flywheel accumulators, which are individually housed in buried\nunderground vacuum tanks, a total power of up to several tens of MWh can be\nachieved. The electrical connections power low voltage motors via a DC\nintermediate circuit and the power converter systems are comparable to those\nfound in plants used in the high-voltage direct current transmissions\napplication.^[2]\n\nSometimes battery storage power stations are built with flywheel storage power\nsystems in order to conserve battery power. Flywheels can handle rapid\nfluctuations better.^[3]^[4]\n\n## Application examples[edit]\n\n### Vehicle braking and acceleration[edit]\n\nIn vehicles small storage of power flywheels are used as an additional\nmechanism with batteries, to store the braking energy by regeneration. Power\ncan be stored in the short term and then released back into the acceleration\nphase of a vehicle with very large electrical currents. This conserves battery\npower.^[5]\n\n### Tram braking and acceleration \u2013 power smoothing[edit]\n\nFlywheel storage has proven to be useful in trams. During braking (such as\nwhen arriving at a station), high energy peaks are found which can not be\nalways fed back into the power grid due to the potential danger of overloading\nthe system. The flywheel energy storage power plants are in containers on side\nof the tracks and take the excess electrical energy. For example, up to 200\nMWh energy per brake system is annually recovered in Zwickau.^[6]\n\n### Power grid frequency control[edit]\n\nIn Stephentown, New York, Beacon Power operates in a flywheel storage power\nplant with 200 flywheels of 25 kWh capacity and 100 kW of power. Ganged\ntogether this gives 5 MWh capacity and 20 MW of power. The units operate at a\npeak speed at 15,000 rpm. The rotor flywheel consists of wound CFRP fibers\nwhich are filled with resin. The installation is intended primarily for\nfrequency control. This service is sold to the New York power grid.^[7]\n\nStadtwerke M\u00fcnchen (SWM, Munich, Germany) uses a flywheel storage power system\nto stabilize the power grid, as well as control energy and to compensate for\ndeviations from renewable energy sources. The plant originates from the J\u00fclich\nStornetic GmbH. The system consists of 28 flywheels and has a capacity of 100\nkWh and a capacity of 600 kilovolt-amperes (kVA). The flywheels rotate at a\npeak speed of 45,000 rpm.^[8]\n\nIn Ontario, Canada, Temporal Power Ltd. has operated a flywheel storage power\nplant since 2014. It consists of 10 flywheels made of steel. Each flywheel\nweighs four tons and is 2.5 meters high. The maximum rotational speed is\n11,500 rpm. The maximum power is 2 MW. The system is used for frequency\nregulation. After a successful three-year trial period, the system is to be\nexpanded to 20 MW and then 100 MW.^[9]\n\n### Renewable energy time shift[edit]\n\nThe city of Fresno in California is running flywheel storage power plants\nbuilt by Amber Kinetics to store solar energy, which is produced in excess\nquantity in the daytime, for consumption at night.^[10]\n\n### Deployed systems[edit]\n\nOn the island of Aruba is currently a 5 MWh flywheel storage power plant built\nby Temporal Power Ltd.^[11]^[12] The island intends to convert its energy\nsupply to 100 percent renewables by 2020.^[13]\n\n## Energy loss[edit]\n\nIt is now (since 2013) possible to build a flywheel storage system that loses\njust 5 percent of the energy stored in it, per day (i.e. the self-discharge\nrate).^[14]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Search for the Super Battery (2017 PBS film)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Schwungrad-Speicherkraftwerk in Hazle Township, Pennsylvania (USA), Betreiberseite beaconpower\n  2. ^ Power Electronics, Darstellung der Leistungselektronik, Betreiberseite beaconpower\n  3. ^ zdf-video, ZDF - Planet E - Schwungradspeicher\n  4. ^ utilitydive.com, PG&E contracts for 75 MWh of energy storage which is planned to be increased to 580 MWh of capacity\n  5. ^ zdf-video, ZDF - Planet E - Schwungradspeicher\n  6. ^ zdf-video, ZDF - Planet E - Schwungradspeicher, Minute 17:03\n  7. ^ cleanthinking.de BEACON Power, USA\n  8. ^ \"aachener-zeitung.de Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen vermarkten J\u00fclicher Speicher\".
