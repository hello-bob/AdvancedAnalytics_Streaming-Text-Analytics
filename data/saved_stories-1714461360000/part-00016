This code holds an important place in history and is a fascinating\nread of an operating system that was written entirely in 8086 assembly code\nnearly 45 years ago.\n\nToday, in partnership with IBM and in the spirit of open innovation, we\u2019re\nreleasing the source code to MS-DOS 4.00 under the MIT license. There\u2019s a\nsomewhat complex and fascinating history behind the 4.0 versions of DOS, as\nMicrosoft partnered with IBM for portions of the code but also created a\nbranch of DOS called Multitasking DOS that did not see a wide release.\n\n## MS-DOS 4.00\n\nExplore the source code, binaries, and documents on GitHub\n\nView on GitHub\n\nA young English researcher named Connor \u201cStarfrost\u201d Hyde recently corresponded\nwith former Microsoft Chief Technical Officer Ray Ozzie about some of the\nsoftware in his collection. Amongst the floppies, Ray found unreleased beta\nbinaries of DOS 4.0 that he was sent while he was at Lotus. Starfrost reached\nout to the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office (OSPO) to explore releasing\nDOS 4 source, as he is working on documenting the relationship between DOS 4,\nMT-DOS, and what would eventually become OS/2. Some later versions of these\nMultitasking DOS binaries can be found around the internet, but these new\nOzzie beta binaries appear to be much earlier, unreleased, and also include\nthe ibmbio.com source.\n\nScott Hanselman, with the help of internet archivist and enthusiast Jeff\nSponaugle, has imaged these original disks and carefully scanned the original\nprinted documents from this \u201cOzzie Drop\u201d. Microsoft, along with our friends at\nIBM, think this is a fascinating piece of operating system history worth\nsharing.\n\nJeff Wilcox and OSPO went to the Microsoft Archives, and while they were\nunable to find the full source code for MT-DOS, they did find MS DOS 4.00,\nwhich we\u2019re releasing today, alongside these additional beta binaries, PDFs of\nthe documentation, and disk images. We will continue to explore the archives\nand may update this release if more is discovered.\n\nThank you to Ray Ozzie, Starfrost, Jeff Sponaugle, Larry Osterman, Mark\nZbikowski, our friends at the IBM OSPO, as well as the makers of such digital\narcheology software including, but not limited to Greaseweazle, Fluxengine,\nAaru Data Preservation Suite, and the HxC Floppy Emulator. Above all, thank\nyou to the original authors of this code, some of whom still work at Microsoft\nand IBM today!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to run this software yourself and explore, we have successfully\nrun it directly on an original IBM PC XT, a newer Pentium, and within the open\nsource PCem and 86box emulators.\n\n## Related blog posts\n\n### Join Microsoft at Open Source Summit North America 2024\n\nJoin Microsoft at Open Source Summit North America 2024, taking place in\nSeattle, Washington from Read more\n\n### ONNX Runtime Web unleashes generative AI in the browser using WebGPU\n\nThis blog is thrilled to announce the official launch of ONNX Runtime Web\nfeaturing WebGPU, Read more\n\n### On-Device Training: Training a model in browser\n\nContinuing the ONNXRuntime On-Device Training blog series, we are introducing\nONNX Runtime Training for Web, Read more\n\n## Find out more\n\n  * Microsoft Open Source Programs Office\n  * Microsoft on GitHub\n  * Developer Blogs\n  * Tech Community\n  * Microsoft Docs\n  * Channel 9\n\n## Tags\n\n.NET Ansible Apache Azure Container Service Azure Kubernetes Service Azure\nMarketplace Bitnami Chef Cloudera Cloud Foundry Docker GitHub Go Hadoop\nHashiCorp HDInsight Helm Hortonworks Java JavaScript Jenkins Kubernetes Linux\nMEAN Microsoft Azure MongoDB MySQL Node.js ONNX ONNX Runtime ONNX Runtime\nTraining Open Source Weekly PostgreSQL Python PyTorch R Red Hat Spark Spring\nTerraform Typescript Ubuntu Visual Studio Visual Studio Code Windows\n\n## Follow OpenAtMicrosoft\n\nEnglish (United States) Your Privacy Choices Consumer Health Privacy\n\nNotifications\n\n", "frontpage": false}
