Many OEM products and components\nexist that allow engineers and hobby enthusiasts alike to design their own\nmachines with off-the-shelf parts in a relatively short amount of time. For\nEDM machines however, this is a different story.\n\nThe biggest challenge in building a custom EDM machine is the Arc generator.\nNormally Arc generators are not sold as separate components as they are\ncomplex pieces of hardware that need to be designed specifically for the\nsystem they will be used in. So in order to build a custom machine, a custom\ngenerator needs to be designed, which is a major hurdle for anyone building a\ncustom EDM machine.\n\nTo overcome this problem, BaxEDM has developed an adaptable Arc generator that\nis easy to integrate into custom designs, offering versatility while still\nproviding professional results. With this hurdle now removed, the realization\nof low cost custom EDM machines is now within reach of engineers and hobby\nenthusiasts.\n\n### Happy user \u2013 4300+ Hours operation so far\n\nI\u2019m using the BX17 arc generator to wire-EDM machine parts for model\nengineering. I am the first customer of BAXEDM and purchased my generator\nabout 1.5 year ago. So far I have machined with the generator for 4300+ hours\nwithout any problems and have been able to make many parts. About 10 years ago\nI build the first home build wire EDM machine and also build my own generator,\nhowever when the BAXEDM generator became available I decided to purchase one\nbecause it was more advanced and powerful than mine, since my competence lies\nin mechanics and not in electronics. I\u2019m a really happy user, the only\ndownside I can think of is that the BX17 was hard to integrate into my\nexisting CNC solution, as my CNC control cannot move backwards. The design of\nthe BX17 is such that it is only easy to implement with CNC controllers that\ncan move backwards e.g. Dynomotion. This is a downside for me.\n\nBenny Croonen\n\nwww.youtube.com/user/plasmaboog/videos\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/plasmaboog/videos\n\n### The good kind of sparks from electronics\n\nIn 2013 I built a small tabletop wire EDM just to see if I could and partly as\nI needed such a machine. No information was available, so had to improvise and\nbuilt the machine around an Arduino working as a G code interpreter / machine\ncontroller and a very simple RC-type generator from scrap parts. It worked\n(https://www.youtube.com/TheWireEDM), but was very slow and due to my limited\nknowledge the project stayed in that condition for years. I was about to\nrebuild a PWM type generator for myself and prototyped one which I wasn\u2019t too\nfond of, so everything just halted for a couple of years.\n\nThen a guy called Mike contacted me about building a wire EDM and in months he\nhad a working machine and not soon after he announced that he has a generator\ncapable of some serious output power and with advanced gap measurement.\nDecided to hop on the list of first-buyers and in December of 2018 got my\ngenerator in the mail with an assortment of other bits and pieces from the\nwebshop and spent all the time I could spare from my free time to rebuild my\nelectronics, recoding the Arduino and fitting the new generator on the wall\nabove the machine.\n\nFirst cuts didn\u2019t exactly work as I had hoped, got some interference to my\ncontroller, but after a lengthy discussion of options and things to try to\nhone on the error source with Mikes awesome support, I got the machine cutting\nhappily without issues! Really loving this, the ease of use and being\nconfident that each spark is as supposed to be, I\u2019m able to cut very fast,\nvery accurately and in productive manner, so that I can offer wire EDM work\nfor my customers.\n\nHighly recommending this generator unit, it is built by a professional and it\ndelivers what it promises! The customer support has been amazing to get things\nrunning smoothly and gotten some valuable advice on how to implement the\ngenerator in to my system. Definately worth every penny, especially for\nretrofitters.\n\nJaakko Fagerlund\n\nSuomen Tiirikointipalvelu\n\nhttp://kassakaapinavaus.fi\n\n### Great piece of equipment for custom EDM builds\n\nThe combination of the BX17 arc generator and Dynomotion controller allow the\ncreation of many different custom EDM tools. I built a small-hole EDM drilling\nmachine, and am working on a wire EDM now. It\u2019s convenient to have benchtop-\nsized machines, since most/all commercial EDM tools are huge free-standing\ndevices.\n\nBen Krasnow\n\nApplied Science on Youtube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/bkraz333\n\n### Great product and great company to deal with\n\nAfter receiving the generator, the first thing that I noticed was how\nprofessional it was packed. The delivery was prompt (10 days to the other side\nof the World). Upon opening the box, I noticed how professional the generator\nis made, even the logo is done by wire EDM, using that generator as proof of\nquality control... The machine that I\u2019m developing is a 6 axis (4\ninterpolating ) wire EDM, still in the development and building stage. Can\u2019t\nwait to get it going, and according to testimonials by some of my friends that\nhave the generator going, its going to be a smash hit. The customer support is\ngreat.\n\nMariano Diaz\n\n### A great product worth recommending !!!\n\nWe got the generator some time ago \u2013 the product looks very good and works\naccording to our expectations.\n\nWe are preparing the modernization of several old WEDM machines. One of the\nbiggest problems is the generator. Using the BaxEDM BX17 solution, we were\nable to launch the cut in a very short time.\n\nThe product is definitely worth recommending \u2013 Not only for hobbyists but\nprofessionals.\n\nMarek\n\nMashinada\n\nhttps://www.mashinada.com\n\n### Not built yet, but opened up and poked at....\n\nWell I had to get the generator, and its mine, so I took the covers off to\ngive it a good looking over. Its fabulously well made, solid connections, well\ndesigned layouts, and good quality parts (like the power supplies, which are\nthe most abused parts) This is not a hobbyist selling an arduino and some\ntransistors in a box.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to start the main build. The generator is a quality product.\n\nSteve M. Taylor\n\n### Amazing product\n\nI initially made my own generator from existing designs, but was unable to get\nuseful performance. Now, with the BaxEDM BX17 generator, my custom wire EDM\nmachine got a huge performance boost. Next to the performance of this product,\nthe technical support has been superb, I definitely recommend this product to\nall DIY EDM builders!\n\nAdolfo\n\nTessenCNC\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UClWrvy9nYLFGDne6uT9Zw1A\n\n### Quality product with great support\n\nI was delighted to discover BaxEDM as I was digging into building my own EDM\npower supply. The amount of work that his generator has saved me is truly\nmonumental! I have enjoyed initial experiments with the machine and in every\naspect I have tested sofar it is extremely well built and BaxEDM is incredibly\nresponsive. One instance impressed me very, very much: I was interested in a\nsingle-shot mode, in which it is possible to trigger individual EDM pulse\ndischarges. I spoke with Mike by email on a saturday morning, and on saturday\nafternoon he called me to let me know he had updated the firmware and that\nthere was a software upgrade available for download to allow this\nfunctionality! This kind of responsiveness is incredibly impressive and\ntestifies to the excellent engineering design he has put into this system. I\nwould absolutely buy another unit from him- in fact, I did: I bought another\ngenerator for my work!\n\nGordon Kirkwood - Research Engineer\n\nSRI International\n\nhttps://www.sri.com/\n\n\u00a9 BaxEDM 2024 Built with Storefront & WooCommerce.\n\n  * My Account\n  * Search\n\n  * Cart 0\n\n", "frontpage": false}
