All Rights Reserved.\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nBy Christine Yu\n\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Kissing bugs, or triatomine bugs, are the primary\nvector for Chagas disease, a major public health concern in Central and South\nAmerica and even the southern United States. However, there aren\u2019t many good\ntreatment options available, which means that to stop the spread of the\npotentially life-threatening disease, it\u2019s essential to control the organisms\nthat carry the parasite.\n\nNew research from an international team, including a Penn State researcher,\ndemonstrates \u2014 for the first time \u2014 the use of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in\nkissing bugs and opens the door to research on applied strategies for Chagas\ndisease control. Their results appear in the April print issue of The CRISPR\nJournal.\n\n\u201cPeople have tried to do CRISPR and genetic engineering in triatomine bugs for\na long time, but no one has been able to do it because traditional methods are\nvery difficult in these bugs,\u201d said Jason Rasgon, Dorothy Foehr Huck and J.\nLloyd Huck Endowed Chair in disease epidemiology and biotechnology and co-\nauthor of the study. \u201cFor the last six years, we have been developing tools to\ngenetically modify difficult organisms. Here, we showed that you could\ngenetically modify this vector insect. Our technology has the potential to\nmake gene editing more efficient, easier and cheaper in a wide range of\nanimals.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to gene editing, researchers typically perform what\u2019s called\nembryonic microinjections, injecting the CRISPR gene editing material directly\ninto embryos. But the technique involves expensive equipment and can be\ninefficient with no guarantee that the genetic engineering will work. This\ntechnique is also difficult in kissing bugs because their eggs are too hard to\npierce.\n\n\u201cInstead, we\u2019ve developed a technology \u2014 Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction\nof Cargo or \u2018ReMOT Control\u2019 \u2014 where you can inject the materials directly into\nthe circulatory system of the mother and guide that material to the developing\neggs,\u201d Rasgon said. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of injecting every single egg in her\nbody all at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s goal was to conduct a proof-of-concept of the ReMOT Control\ntechnology in triatomine bugs. They targeted genes associated with eye color\nand cuticle, or outside covering, color. After injecting the female kissing\nbug, the team examined the offspring to see if they had altered eye or cuticle\ncolor. The visible changes indicated that the genetic edits were successful\nand the targeted genes were deleted.\n\nKissing bugs are also a model system to study insect physiology. The\ndevelopment of this new protocol will allow scientists to investigate\nfundamental biological questions about insects and disease transmission, the\nresearchers said.\n\n\u201cThis has important implications for basic research, but it also brings\ntriatomine bugs and Chagas disease into conversations about genetic\ntechnologies for the control of vector-borne pathogens,\u201d Rasgon said. \u201cWe are\non the cusp of having the technology and tools available to be able to do\nthat.\u201d\n\nOther authors on the paper include: Helena Araujo, Leonardo Lima, Mateus\nBerni, Jamile Mota, Daniel Bressan, Alison Julio and Robson Cavalcante from\nthe Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro;\nVanessa Macias from the Department of Biological Sciences, University of North\nTexas; and Ethan Bier and Zhiqian Li from the Department of Cell and\nDevelopmental Biology, University of California, San Diego.\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation EDGE program supported this work.\n\nLast Updated April 22, 2024\n\n### Contact\n\n  * Christine Yu\n\n    * cmy5406@psu.edu\n\n### Tags\n\n  * Research\n  * Faculty and Staff\n  * News of Record\n  * Publications\n  * University Park\n  * Agricultural Sciences\n  * Department of Entomology\n  * Latest News\n  * Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences\n  * Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics\n\n## Related Articles\n\nResearch\n\n### Novel robotic training program reduces physician errors placing central\nlines\n\nHealth and Human Development\n\n### Calorie restriction study reveals complexities in how diet impacts aging\n\nLiberal Arts\n\n### Lone actors more likely to commit terrorist acts than U.S. extremist\ngroups\n\nGet the news by email\n\nSubscribe\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n  * Instagram\n\n## Get News By Email\n\nDiscover News\n\n## Explore\n\n  * News\n  * Careers\n  * Facts and Rankings\n  * Colleges\n  * Campuses\n  * Health Care\n  * Research\n  * Impact\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Prospective Students\n  * Current Students\n  * International Students\n  * Business and Industry\n  * Veterans and Military\n  * Visitors\n  * Faculty and Staff\n  * Alumni\n  * Media\n  * COVID-19 Information\n\n## Popular Links\n\n  * Maps\n  * Directory\n  * Libraries\n  * Academic Calendar\n  * LionPATH\n\n## Stay Connected\n\n  * Emails / Headlines\n  * Emergency Notifications\n  * Penn State Go\n  * Strategic Communications\n  * Report Misconduct\n  * Police\n\n  * 201 Old Main, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802\n  * 814-865-4700\n  * Contact Us\n\n  * Non Discrimination\n  * Equal Opportunity\n  * Accessibility\n  * Legal Statements\n  * The Pennsylvania State University\n\n  * The Pennsylvania State University \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
