This is often done so that the project trademark\nowner can monetize the project. Developer communities that provided their work\nto the project are often upset when this happens and may stop collaborating\nwith the project. License changes do not apply retroactively to previous\nreleases, so developers may consider forking the project under a new name and\nwith an open source license.\n\nRedis and Terraform are recent examples of open source projects that were\nrelicensed as non-open source projects.\n\nThis site seeks to educate developers and users about risks that their\nfavorite open source projects may be relicensed unfavorably.\n\nRelicensing Monitor\n\nWith \u2764\ufe0f for open source software\n\nThis website is dual licensed: MIT or CC BY 4.0\n\nCopyright 2024: Various Contributors\n\nRSS feed\n\n", "frontpage": false}
