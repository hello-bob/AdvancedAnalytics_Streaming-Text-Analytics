Should Mastodon step up?\n\n, and Ankush Das\n\nMay 1, 2024 . 10:33 AM\n\n6 min read\n\n  * X\n  * Share on Facebook\n\n  * Share on Pinterest\n\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n  * Share via Email\n\nSkip Ad\n\nAds by\n\nSkip\n\nSkip Ad\n\nAds by\n\nSkip\n\nSkip ad in\n\nSo, Mastodon is a nice escape from the big tech social media platforms.\n\nWhether it is about ignoring Elon Musk's mood swings on X (or formerly\nTwitter) or refusing to be a part of Mark Zuckerberg's data points, Mastodon\nhas proved to be an impressive open-source social media platform.\n\nWhile it is privacy-friendly, and lets users take control of their data, the\nplatform is not perfect.\n\nNothing is, unless you are arrogant enough to think of it that way.\n\nWhat's the problem I am referring to here? Is it a feature that I'm missing,\nor the user experience?\n\nUnfortunately, I am not complaining about either. There is always room for\nimprovements, but I am not talking about that here.\n\nI am talking about Mastodon's ability to DDoS a website \ud83d\udca3 And, our sites, It's\nFOSS News, and It's FOSS, are some of the sites being affected by the issue.\n\n\ud83d\udccb\n\nDon't get me wrong: Mastodon is not doing this knowingly. The problem occurs\nbecause of federation. But, they have been aware of this concern for a long\ntime now, and it hasn't seen a meaningful fix. Moreover, there is no expected\ndate for a fix on that, which is concerning \ud83d\ude15\n\n## Care to Explain? Sure!\n\nWhen you share a link on Mastodon, a link preview is generated for it, right?\n\nWith Mastodon being a federated platform (a part of the Fediverse), the\nrequest to generate a link preview is not generated by just one Mastodon\ninstance. There are many instances connected to it who also initiate requests\nfor the content almost immediately.\n\nAnd, this \"fediverse effect\" increases the load on the website's server in a\nbig way.\n\nSure, some websites may not get overwhelmed with the requests, but Mastodon\ndoes generate numerous hits, increasing the load on the server. Especially, if\nthe link reaches a profile with more followers (and a broader network of\ninstances).\n\nI believe we have 15k followers, and that gives us a decent reach.\n\nAnd, as a result, we get affected for a couple of minutes in a day, for\nreaders to encounter 504 Gateway Timeout error or the webpage being\nunresponsive for a few seconds, whenever a link is shared on mastodon.social\ninstance (primarily).\n\nFurthermore, when a user with a huge following list or having connections to a\nbigger network of instances boosts that post, the request to the site is\namplified again, as explained by Chris Partridge, a security engineer.\n\n\ud83d\udca1\n\nIt does not affect us when you (readers) with fewer followers share our links.\nBut, when we share our articles along on our profile, it impacts our server\nresources immediately for a couple of minutes.\n\nOne of our readers notified us about this Fediverse effect originally, before\nwe investigated the root cause:\n\nAnd, turns out, the downtimes caused by this issue (as the majority) looks\nlike this:\n\nAnd, such an effect increases the frequency of downtimes, affecting our\navailability times:\n\nMaybe you can also reproduce this issue if you have a higher follower count.\n\nWe tried it on our Mastodon profile, and every time we shared a link, we were\nable to successfully make our website unresponsive or slow to load \ud83d\ude32\n\nPresently, we use Cloudflare as our CDN or WAF, as it is a widely adopted\nsolution.\n\nBut, what if we switch to a separate CDN provider, which would cost us for the\nresources being served? Do you think any web server should pay for extra\nresources being served for no reason? Wouldn't they want it to be blocked or\nfixed?\n\nQuoting Chris Partridge's older findings, he mentioned:\n\n> However, I got a bit of a nasty surprise when I looked into how much traffic\n> this had consumed - a single roughly ~3KB POST to Mastodon caused servers to\n> pull a bit of HTML and... fuck, an image. In total, 114.7 MB of data was\n> requested from my site in just under five minutes - making for a traffic\n> amplification of 36704:1.\n\nAn amplified resource request like this \u2014 should be on top of the priority\nlist for Mastodon to fix, right?\n\nAnd, no, it is not just an older blog post I am referencing. Another software\ndeveloper, Michael Nordmeyer also shared similar findings on his blog post\nabout Mastodon DDoS'ing websites/servers in 2023.\n\nOn Mastodon DDoS\u2019ing Sites\n\nMastodon link previews can lead to excessive requests at the same time, which\nis not Mastodon\u2019s fault.\n\nMichael NordmeyerMichael Nordmeyer\n\nLet's go through some GitHub issues reported on the same:\n\n  * https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/4486 (Concerns about Mastodon being innocently used as a DDoS tool were reported 6 years ago).\n  * https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/27266 (Mastodon sending massive hits to outside websites, Oct, 2023)\n  * https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/23662 (Reduce load of preview fetching, Feb, 2023)\n\nAnd, the issue listed was added to their milestone for the next upcoming\nrelease, 4.3.0 (or so I thought):\n\nUnfortunately, now, it appears that the issue has been deprioritized, and\nmoved as a milestone for a future 4.4.0 release.\n\nAs things stand now, the 4.4.0 release could take a year or more (who knows?).\nAnd, I think that the issue should have been prioritized for a faster fix, not\nput back to their bucket list of doing things.\n\nDo I sound entitled? Do you think it is wrong for me to talk about this?\n\nLet me tell you why I chose to do this...\n\n## It's Mastodon, That's Why!\n\nMastodon is a free and open-source platform that aims to tackle the big tech,\nright?\n\nWe even list it as one of the best open source social media platforms:\n\n11 Decentralized, Open Source Alternative Social Media Platforms\n\nTired of Big Tech prying on your data and invading your privacy? Here are some\nopen source, decentralized alternate social platforms.\n\nIt's FOSSAbhishek Prakash\n\nWell, the thing is \u2014 the big tech platforms are not impacting our website at\nthe moment. But, Mastodon is...\n\nA bug like this could be impacting several independent sites like us with\ndowntimes or amplifying their resource/bandwidth usage for no good reason.\n\nDon't you think as a community-powered, open-source project, it should be\npossible to attend to a long-standing bug, as serious as this one?\n\nSure, one can argue that it's not Mastodon's fault. So, why put it that way? I\nbelieve, with a platform as big as Mastodon (compared to other federated\nsolutions), someone has to take a lead on fixing this bug.\n\nMoreover, if Mastodon wants to become the modern Twitter (or better), it\nshould resolve fundamental issues like this.\n\n> The decentralized social media idea should fix things on the web, and not\n> break the traditional web experience.\n\nHopefully, Mastodon developers see this (along with the community), and get\nthis sorted out as soon as possible. The current solution includes blocking\nMastodon as a user-agent, which would disable our link previews, making it\nlook like spam and uninformative.\n\n\ud83d\udcac What do you think about this?
