As cities have claimed to defund the police, many have quietly\nexpanded their use of private security, reallocating spending from the public\nto the private sector. It is difficult to know what to make of these trends,\nlargely because we know so little about what private security looks like on\nthe ground. On one prevalent view of the facts, a shift from public to private\nsecurity would mean little more than a change of uniform, as the two labor\nmarkets are deeply intertwined. Indeed, academics, the media, popular culture,\nand the police themselves all tell us that private security is some amalgam of\na police retirement community and a dumping ground for disgraced former cops.\nBut if, instead, private officers differ systematically from the public\npolice\u2014and crossover between the sectors is limited\u2014then substitution from\npolicing to private security could drastically change who is providing\nsecurity services.\n\nWe bring novel data to bear on these questions, presenting the largest\nempirical study of private security to date. We introduce an administrative\ndataset covering nearly 300,000 licensed private security officers in the\nState of Florida. By linking this dataset to similarly comprehensive\ninformation about public law enforcement, we have, for the first time, a\nnearly complete picture of the entire security labor market in one state. We\nreport two principal findings. First, the public and private security markets\nare predominantly characterized by occupational segregation, not integration.\nThe individuals who compose the private security sector differ markedly from\nthe public police; they are, for example, significantly less likely to be\nwhite men. We also find that few private officers, roughly 2%, have previously\nworked in public policing, and even fewer will go on to policing in the\nfuture. Second, while former police make up a small share of all private\nsecurity, roughly a quarter of cops who do cross over have been fired from a\npolicing job. In fact, fired police officers are nearly as likely to land in\nprivate security as to find another policing job, and a full quarter end up in\none or the other. We explore the implications of these findings, including\nintersections with police abolition and the future of policing, at the paper\u2019s\nclose.\n\nKeywords: Police, private security, occupational segregation\n\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\n\nGrunwald, Ben and Rappaport, John and Berg, Michael, Private Security and\nPublic Police (February 23, 2024).
