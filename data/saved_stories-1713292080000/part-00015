Its features include:\n\n\\- Multi-cluster mode (viewing the resources of multiple clusters at once).\n\n\\- Viewing built-in resources and custom resources in gorgeous native detail\nviews.\n\n\\- Automatic resource watching with realtime updates.\n\n\\- Watching and searching logs of multiple pods and containers in one combined\nstream.\n\n\\- Attaching to running pods with the integrated terminal.\n\n\\- Attaching shells (exec) to running pods with the integrated terminal.\n\n\\- Editing resources as YAML source with the integrated, customizable text\neditor.\n\n\\- Deleting resources.\n\n\\- Cordoning and uncordoning nodes.\n\n\\- Evicting pods.\n\n\\- Restarting deployments, daemonsets, statefulsets and replicasets.\n\n\\- Accessing clusters stored on a local kubeconfig file.\n\n\\- Accessing clusters stored on the local system keychain.\n\n\\- Optionally syncing stored clusters between devices via iCloud Keychain.\n\n\\- Related events overview on resource detail views.\n\n\\- Related pods overview on workload detail views\n\n\\- Handy overview graphs for workloads and compute resource statuses.\n\n\\- Slideover, split view, Stage Manager and multi-window support.\n\n\\- Performant, truly native implementation in Swift and Rust.\n\n\\- Multi-tab support (on macOS).\n\n\\- Multiple app icons.\n\n\\- Handoff support.\n\n\\- Integration with Siri and Shortcuts.\n\n\\- Integration with Google Cloud Platform.\n\n\\- Integration with Amazon Web Services.\n\n\\- Integration with Microsoft Azure.\n\n\\- Integration with DigitalOcean.\n\n\\- Optional list view caching to speed up loading.\n\n\\- Optional support for gzipped Kubernetes API requests.\n\n\\- Optional base64-decoding of secrets on the secrets UI.\n\n\\- Customizable list sorting.\n\nThe terms of service can be found here: https://nautik.io/tos\n\n## What\u2019s New\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nVersion 1.1\n\nMulti-pod logs, list sorting and child pods on workloads!\n\n\\- You can now open the logs of multiple pods and containers inside of the\nsame window.\n\n\\- You can now customize the sort order of tables and lists and sort them by\none or multiple columns. Changes to a table's or list's sort order will stick\nover app relaunches.\n\n\\- You can now view a list of the related pods on the detail views of\ndeployments, daemon sets, stateful sets, replica sets, jobs and cron jobs.\n\n\\- You can now open the combined logs of all related pods from the list and\ndetail views of deployments, daemon sets, stateful sets, replica sets, jobs\nand cron jobs.\n\n\\- List views can now optionally cache their data to speed up reloading when\nnavigating to another list.\n\n\\- We've fixed a memory leak on macOS causing closed windows or tabs to\nsometimes not be properly deallocated. The app's memory usage on macOS should\nbe a lot lower now.\n\n\\- We've fixed a bug on macOS causing closed windows to sometimes not be\nproperly reopened when clicking the app icon in the dock.\n\n\\- We've fixed a bug causing context menu options on list views to sometimes\nnot work reliably on macOS.\n\n\\- We've improved the performance and reliability of list selections.\n\n## Ratings and Reviews\n\nCleeb. , 03/22/2024\n\n### Great start\n\n> It only released today but I\u2019m really liking being able to see my homelab\n> cluster in a native UI with all the features I\u2019d expect from an app like\n> this. Great work, I\u2019m excited for future updates!\n\nGeekplaya , 03/24/2024\n\n### More like a viewer, less of a true client\n\n> It feels like all you can do is see how things are running. In terms of\n> interactions your options are limited.\n>\n> For instance, most clients let you trigger a job from a cronjob. With\n> Nautik, I can\u2019t seem to do that. I can only view the YAML spec or delete it.\n>\n> If it offered some sort of kubectl terminal that\u2019d be a different story. But\n> right now I feel like I can only just peruse what I\u2019ve deployed and delete\n> stuff.\n\n## App Privacy\n\nThe developer, DWRPD Software UG haftungsbeschraenkt, indicated that the app\u2019s\nprivacy practices may include handling of data as described below.
