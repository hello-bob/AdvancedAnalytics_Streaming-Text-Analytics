This journey forced me to wrestle with\nexistential questions about my true beliefs, and how they intersected my life\nas an entrepreneur. One\u2019s work is rarely a pure reflection of ideology, but\ncompanies need a clear and authentic strategy, which requires a tight\nalignment between company operations and the founder\u2019s philosophy. I have\ndiscovered more about those differences between what I believe and the best\nways to grow a corporation while studying economics - that is, how money is\nmade and exchanged - than any other area.\n\nA worldwide conflict between communism and capitalism defined the latter half\nof the twentieth century. The United States\u2019 ideological battle was the\ncentral drama of my childhood, and it was with a combination of glee, pride,\nand \u201ctold you so!\u201d that my fellow Americans watched the wall fall in Berlin,\nand the USSR dissolve shortly thereafter. I expect few would deny that the US\nis the standard bearer for capitalism.\n\nYet, there\u2019s a flaw at the heart of this claim. While the United States\noperates as a free market economy, the key agent within modern capitalism -\nthe corporation - works more like an authoritarian state. Given how much of\nour world is built around corporations, this truth and its impacts are\ncritical.\n\nI grew up apart from America\u2019s passion for capitalism. In the era of Reagan, I\nwas living on a commune. My parents did not earn money for their labor, and we\ndidn\u2019t have personal property. My family left the Farm when I was 8, and as I\nmatured, my ideological roots were in conflict with the US\u2019s nonstop pro-\ncapitalism message. As I joined the workforce and eventually started my own\ncompany, I found myself attached to neither the communal roots of my childhood\nnor the Wolf of Wall Street world I moved into. I grew slowly in convictions,\nas I encountered problems in the course of scaling a company.\n\nThe first real conflict came when it was time to hire managers. I founded a\ncompany primarily because I did not thrive as someone else\u2019s employee, so what\nled me to think others would? More importantly, anyone who has ever operated\nat the front line is aware of the severe costs imposed by the separation\nbetween the people who do the work and the people who make the decisions in\nhierarchies. Hiring managers was just going to make the company do worse, not\nbetter, right? Right?\n\nI expect three of you are gleefully shouting, \u201cYay, holacracy!\u201d right now,\nwhile the rest are confused and either offended or think I\u2019m an idiot. I did\nconsider a manager-less world, but a little research provided only examples of\ndisaster, because the only available options just replace an explicit power\nstructure with an implicit one. In other words, it\u2019s still hierarchical with\nthe founder on top, but now decision making is opaque and the system is easy\nto exploit because of the lack of controls (which looks surprisingly like the\ncult/commune I grew up in).\n\nThose who are confused or offended by the idea that managers make performance\nworse would be informed by a deep dip in economics. One of the core principles\nof the free market is that central planning committees can never be as\nefficient or as effective as the people doing the work. By definition a free\nmarket economy lacks a decision-making hierarchy; the \u2018free\u2019 means every agent\n(individual or corporation) can decide for themselves, without needing\npermission from a manager above.\n\nWhile there are many aspects of modern American capitalism I reject, this one\nI wholeheartedly support1. The downsides of a strong central executive were\ntaught to me early.\n\nLike many other communes, the one I grew up on routinely failed to feed its\npeople - my parents speak with horror of the \u2018wheat berry winter\u2019, when we\nlived on little else. While his people were short on food, the founder of the\nFarm was off touring Europe as the 3rd drummer in a band, \u201cbringing our\nmessage to the world\u201d.\n\nThankfully none of us starved to death, but the failing was similar to what\nmost communist countries experienced: The central organization could not feed\neveryone. For years, I assumed this was just incompetence, whether at the\nscale of the Farm or China. The truth was far more structural. Millions\nstarved during the Great Leap Forward because the central organization was\ntrying something impossible: Managing the productive output of an entire\ncountry. The Planet Money podcast tells a great story of how this central\nplanning was walked back in China, but the general point here is that these\ncommunist countries did not just nationalize the means of production, they\ntried to centrally control all of it from within a small group.2\n\nWhen people talk about communist countries not being a free market, this is\nwhat they mean: They tell the farms what crops to produce and in what\nquantity, rather than letting them decide for themselves. China even went so\nfar as to dictate what hours a farmer should start and stop working, and then\ndirected managers to ring a bell for transition times to control every little\ngroup of farmers. Anyone who\u2019s ever had to punch a clock into a rigid,\ndysfunctional hierarchy is likely getting painful flashbacks about now.\n\nIt should be immediately obvious why this fails miserably: The distance\nbetween the central planning committee and the farmer is so great that good\ndecisions are nearly impossible. It\u2019s nearly impossible for critical feedback\nto make it from the edge, where the farmers are working, to the central\nplanning committee in time to affect decisions, and then for those decisions\nto make it back to the edge in time to be useful. The podcast linked above\nalso points out how unmotivated the farmers were under this regime, cutting\nproductivity even further. Those who have studied lean manufacturing, agile\ndevelopment, and DevOps are likely seeing parallels here.\n\nThe result was catastrophe. When a corporation is painfully inefficient it\nloses money and might have to do layoffs, but when a country fails at growing\nfood, its people starve to death. I don\u2019t mean to imply that central planning\nwas the only cause of famine under communist rule - there were political\noperations that led to mass starvation, just like in the West - but learning\nmore about these helped crystallize what I do truly prefer about capitalist\nmodels. It also converted the phrase \u2019the free market\u2019 from a catchy slogan\ninto something meaningful to me.3\n\nThe most important feature of free market economies is that each person within\nthem is able to make independent decisions in their own best interests4. If\nyou\u2019re a farmer, you can decide what to grow, how much to grow, and when to\nwork to develop your crop. Heck, you can even choose not to be a farmer any\nmore. Success is merely dependent on your finding a buyer for your work at a\nprice you can tolerate. Any given year might not be perfect, but your decision\nmaking gets better over time as you learn to respond to customer demand.\n\nThis pattern is easy to understand in any system where the people doing the\nwork make the decisions. If you\u2019re a jeweler, you can decide what to make, how\nmuch to sell it for, and what to spend your time on. Same if you run a small\nrestaurant, lead local tours, or are a one-person shop doing house remodeling.\nIt\u2019s a free market, where you can charge what the market will bear, and you\ncan quickly and efficiently respond to its whims, ensuring that you are\ngetting the best use of your time.\n\nThis was a powerful organizing principle for a long time. The history of human\ncommerce developed largely this way: One person, or as many people as could\nfit in one shop, would turn labor into a product, then find a buyer for it.\nMost large-scale efforts were organized by the state of the time: Monarchs and\nthe landed gentry, who were the only ones capable of marshaling enough\nresources to build palaces, roads, and other large construction projects.\n\nThis began to change in the 17th century when corporations like the Dutch East\nIndia Company were able to deliver massive windfalls to investors by pooling\nmoney and using it to extract resources from colonies. There was a step change\nin the 19th century, as corporations went from generating wealth to building\nand owning infrastructure. It\u2019s one thing to outfit a single ship for a year-\nlong voyage, yet another to maintain railroad schedules across the United\nKingdom, or run a telegraph network around the whole US. These aren\u2019t just\nshort-term money-making exercises, they\u2019re long-term commitments with big\ncapital outlays and large returns over years and years.\n\nWe still live in a free market economy, but it\u2019s not one Adam Smith would\nrecognize. Instead of individual or small operators, ours is composed almost\nentirely of corporations. Really big corporations. And these companies, they\nuse the same kind of central planning that we so despise in communist systems.\nI know. I\u2019ve done it.\n\nBy the time my company got near 500 people, we had a multi-week planning\nprocess, where the leadership (i.e., me and my lieutenants) set out top-level\ngoals, built a top-down plan to accomplish them, then drew information from\nthe front line to see where it needed change. We called this a bottom-up plan,\nbut it was only bottom-up from the perspective of numbers - how much money\nwe\u2019d have, what our costs were, etc. - rather than from the bottom of the\norganization. We could see no way to have a system where the people doing the\nwork built a plan for the organization. Even thinking about it now, my\nreaction is, \u201cHow would they know what my goals are?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of question you can only ask in an authoritarian state, not in\na free market economy. My goals became my company\u2019s goals, and the only real\nway to ensure people worked toward them was providing a plan. You might argue\nthat a corporation should focus on shareholder value, but that doesn\u2019t help\nmake decisions about what the company should actually do.\n\nGreat leaders find a way to listen to everyone in the company, but in the end,\nleadership is about making decisions. That\u2019s essentially the definition of the\nword. And we all know leaders who did not bother to listen, or just did not\nneed to in order to be great; today\u2019s most vaunted tech leader, Steve Jobs,\nwas famously disrespectful of the opinions of others, yet made a lot of world-\nchanging decisions (not all for the better).\n\nThis is exactly why working in a big corporation is so stifling. If you\u2019re in\na small company, the executives are close enough to the front line that it\u2019s\nmore like working in a tribe, but in a big company, the leadership is so\nremoved from whose who do the work that executive teams operate like the\npolitburo we so decry in communist countries. Certainly the bureaucracies are\nno more enjoyable or forgiving.\n\nI find it both ironic and painful that my inability to work for someone else\nresulted in my creating a company that involved a lot of smart, capable people\nworking for someone else.\n\nI wish I had a solution. If this were an easy problem, its solution would\nalready be pervasive, because the benefits are massive. Just in terms of\nefficiency, we\u2019ve seen how much better the free market is than planned\neconomies, but it also has a hugely positive impact on quality of life. People\nare happier when they\u2019re in control.\n\nI know the solution is not more freelancing and contract work, which America\u2019s\ncorporations are addicted to. That\u2019s the worst of both worlds: The\nexploitative nature of capitalism with the inefficient bureaucracies of\ncommunism. Transactions on the free market work because they\u2019re good for both\nsides, but most people only accept part-time contract relationships today when\nthey have no other real choices.\n\nHolacracy certainly isn\u2019t the answer. It\u2019s fundamentally flawed because of its\nimplicit power structure - Tony Hsieh still runs Zappos, even if he does not\nuse a central planning committee to do it - but the biggest problem is it\nmakes no mention of economics. Without a clear system for scoring the\ntransactions (i.e., money) it\u2019s impossible to build a free market.\n\nThis problem of how to handle economics within a non-hierarchical company\nmight lead some to think of using blockchain tokens as an internal currency.\nThis is impossible today, beyond the fact that the world of blockchain is\nmostly about fraud and black market sales. The biggest problem is that we have\nno idea how to value most of the work people do. I mean, we might know that\nwhat a developer should get paid for a year\u2019s work, but how much is that work\nworth? The majority of the work done in modern corporations is incredibly hard\nto value, which is partially why companies are so inefficient and make so many\nbad decisions.\n\nThat brings up an even bigger problem - companies today hire workers to make\nmoney from their labor. In other words, they generate profit because they pay\ntheir employees less than they\u2019re worth. If everyone could trade their labor\nfor exactly the amount of money it was worth, the corporations that employ\nthem would have a much harder time making money. Instead, in modern\ncorporations the shareholders and the executive team - again, the central\nplanning committee we so despise - make the majority of the money, while the\nfront line does all the work and makes very little. This is true even at the\nbig tech firms; software developers might be well paid relative to hotel\nworkers, but they\u2019re paid a pittance compared to the founders and executives.\nThis might speak to why we have no solution yet - free market corporations\nwould tend to reduce concentrations of wealth, which would be terribly\ndisruptive to the current system.\n\nLike I said, I don\u2019t have a solution. But at least now I know what makes the\ncurrent system so painful, and it gives me some hope that we actually can come\nup with a better answer. I know I\u2019ll be working harder in the future to manage\nthe downsides of what we have today.\n\n  1. Although I might stress the \u201cwell regulated\u201d part more than most modern economists. \u21a9\n  2. Of course, capitalism is just as capable of killing its citizens, whether through starvation or lack of health care. \u21a9\n  3. Note that I\u2019m not taking the capitalist side of the cold war here; while Americans were decrying the oppression of the Soviets, we were actively clawing back progress on civil rights and knocking over democratically elected governments. This article is about principles, which political regimes rarely show a great track record in following. \u21a9\n  4.
