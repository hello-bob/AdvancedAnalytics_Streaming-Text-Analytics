The memo specifically\nmentions iPhones among the prohibited items.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable to block any kind of voice recording, not just formal\ncommunications including meetings, office conversations, business\nannouncements and complaints from and consultations with the public, but also\ninformal communications such as private phone calls (within military\nbuildings),\u201d reads the internal announcement.\n\nFrom what we understand, the South Korean military wants to ban the iPhone\nbecause their mobile device management app (MDM) isn\u2019t able to lock down the\niPhone\u2019s inherent features, including voice recording.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThe report, claims that Android-based smartphones, mostly those from Samsung,\nwill be exempted from the ban. While the reason behind this exemption is\nunclear, it\u2019s possible that the said MDM can easily lock down voice recording\non Android. It\u2019s also worth noting that Samsung is a South Korean\nconglomerate.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for militaries to restrict certain electronics in secure\nareas to prevent security breaches. However, a complete ban on a specific\ncompany\u2019s products is a rare occurrence.\n\nThere seems to be a technical issue with the South Korean military\u2019s MDM\nsystem, as Apple\u2018s official documentation on MDM support suggests that most\niPhone features, including voice recording, can be controlled through such a\nsystem.\n\n## Related Topics\n\napple\n\n## About The Author\n\nAnurag Singh\n\nAnurag is a Tech writer at Dexerto.
