This research\nexplores whether these are the same as the bugs exploited in more conventional\nsoftware.\n\nNintendo\u2019s Super Mario is the quintessential video game. To understand the\nsorts of glitches speedrunners exploit, they examined four of the earliest\nMario platforming games - Super Mario Bros (1985), Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988),\nSuper Mario World (1990) and Super Mario 64 (1996). Whilst these games are\nold, they are still competitively run by speedrunners with new records\nreported in the news. The games are well also well understood, having been\nstudied by speedrunners for decades, ensuring that there are large numbers of\nwell researched glitches for analysis.\n\nCurrently the world record time for conquering Super Mario World stands at a\nblistering 41 seconds. The team set out to understand 237 known glitches\nwithin them, classifying a variety of weaknesses to see if they can help\nsoftware engineers make applications more robust.\n\nIn the Super Mario platforming games Mario must rescue Princess Peach by\njumping through an obstacle course of various platforms to reach a goal,\navoiding baddies or defeating them by jumping on their heads. Players can\ncollect power-ups along the way to unlock special abilities, and coins to\nincrease their score. The Mario series of games is one of Nintendo\u2019s flagship\nproducts, and one of the most influential video game series of all time.\n\nDr Joseph Hallett from Bristol\u2019s School of Computer Science explained: \u201cMany\nearly video games, such as the Super Mario games we have examined, were\nwritten for consoles that differ from the more uniform PC-like hardware of\nmodern gaming systems.\n\n\u201cConstraints stemming from the hardware, such as limited memory and buses,\nmeant that aggressive optimization and tricks were required to make games run\nwell.\n\n\u201cMany of these techniques (for example, the NES\u2019s memory mapping) are niche\nand can lead to bugs, by being so different to how many programmers usually\nexpect things to work.\n\n\u201cProgramming for these systems is closer to embedded development than most\nmodern software, as it requires working around the limits of the hardware to\ncreate games. Despite the challenges of programming these systems, new games\nare still released and retro-inspired.\u201d\n\nCategorizing bugs in software allows developers to understand similar problems\nand bugs.\n\nThe Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for hardware and\nsoftware weaknesses and vulnerabilities. The team identified seven new\ncategories of weakness previously unspecified.\n\nDr Hallett said: \u201cWe found that some of the glitches speed runners use don\u2019t\nhave neat categorizations in existing software defect taxonomies and that\nthere may be new kinds of bugs to look for in more general software.\u201d\n\nThe team thematically analysed with a code book of existing software\nweaknesses (CWE) - a qualitative research method to help categorize complex\nphenomena.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe cool bit of this research is that academia is starting to\ntreat and appreciate the work speedrunners do and study something that hasn\u2019t\nreally been treated seriously before.\n\n\u201cBy studying speedrunners\u2019 glitches we can better understand how they do it\nand whether the bugs they use are the same ones other software gets hacked\nwith.\n\n\u201cIt turns out the speedrunners have some tricks that we didn\u2019t know about\nbefore.\u201d\n\nNow the team have turned their hand to studying Pok\u00e9mon video games.\n\nPaper:\n\n\u2018Super Mario in the Pernicious Kingdoms: Classifying glitches in old games\u2019 by\nLlewellyn Forward, Io Limmer, Joseph Hallett and Dan Page was presented at the\nWorkshop on Games and Software Engineering (GAS) at the International\nConference on Software Engineering (ICSE).\n\nFeedback\n\nEdit this page\n\nUniversity of Bristol Beacon House Queens Road Bristol, BS8 1QU, UK Tel: +44\n(0)117 928 9000 Contact us\n\n#### Information for\n\n  * New students\n  * Current students\n  * Current staff\n\n#### Connect with us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Flickr\n\nMore social media\n\n#### Study at Bristol\n\n  * Undergraduate study\n  * Postgraduate study\n  * International students\n  * Accommodation\n  * Library\n  * Students' Union\n  * Sport, exercise and health\n\n#### Research\n\n  * Find a researcher\n  * Faculty research\n  * Impact of our research\n  * Research quality and assessment\n  * Engaging with the public\n\n#### About the University\n\n  * Maps and travel\n  * Tours and visits\n  * Events\n  * The University on film\n  * Explore the city of Bristol\n  * Board of Trustees\n\n#### Support the University\n\n  * Alumni and friends\n  * Donate\n\n#### Jobs\n\n  * Working at Bristol\n  * Job listings\n\n#### A\u2013Z of the University\n\n  * #\n  * A\n  * B\n  * C\n  * D\n  * E\n  * F\n  * G\n  * H\n  * I\n  * J\n  * K\n  * L\n  * M\n  * N\n  * O\n  * P\n  * Q\n  * R\n  * S\n  * T\n  * U\n  * V\n  * W\n  * X\n  * Y\n  * Z\n  * See all\n\n  * Help\n  * Terms and conditions\n  * Accessibility statements\n  * Privacy and cookie policy\n  * Modern Slavery statement\n  * \u00a9 2024 University of Bristol\n\n", "frontpage": false}
