Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister,\nannounced plans for a consultation on a package of measures that could include\nlooking at key university personnel being given security clearance and a\nstrengthened process to improve the transparency of funding, particularly with\nforeign institutions.\n\nThe measures will be focused on a small proportion of academic work, with a\nparticular focus on research with potential dual uses in civilian and military\nlife.\n\nMcCallum told the vice-chancellors that hostile states are targeting\nuniversities to steal technology that can \u201cdeliver their authoritarian,\nmilitary and commercial priorities\u201d, the Times reported.\n\nThe government ordered a review of protections for higher education in its\nrefreshed foreign and security policy last year amid concerns that hostile\nstates \u2013 and particularly China \u2013 were gaining undue influence over the\nsector.\n\nDowden has previously warned that some universities\u2019 reliance on overseas\nfunding could leave them open to being \u201cinfluenced, exploited, or even\ncoerced\u201d by a foreign power.\n\nAfter the security briefing, Dowden said: \u201cFor a millennium, our universities\nhave thrived on being open \u2013 open to ideas, open to innovation, open to being\nindependent of government.\n\n\u201cThis is not about erecting fences, this is about balancing evolving threats\nand protecting the integrity and security of our great institutions.\u201d\n\nThe consultation will explore proposals to protect cutting-edge technology\nunder development in sensitive sectors that are being targeted by states\nintent on stealing intellectual property to enhance their own economic and\nmilitary capabilities.\n\nThe NCSC and the National Protective Security Authority have also launched a\ntool to help universities assess their research security.\n\nMichelle Donelan, the science and technology secretary, said: \u201cI believe that\nuniversities are on the frontlines of a battle for information.\n\n\u201cMaintaining the UK\u2019s world-leading reputation as an academic superpower\nrelies on having strong safeguards to protect research from those who wish to\ndo us harm.\u201d\n\nTim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of leading research\nuniversities, said: \u201cRussell Group universities take their national security\nresponsibilities incredibly seriously and already work closely with government\nand the intelligence community to help protect UK breakthroughs in fields like\nAI, which are important to our national interest.\n\n\u201cBut we also recognise security is a dynamic and evolving challenge which\nmeans we need the right expertise and intelligence to keep pace with this.\u201d\n\nUniversities UK chief executive Vivienne Stern said: \u201cFor several years,\nUniversities UK has worked with government to ensure that universities are\nsupported and equipped to recognise and mitigate risks to national security.\n\n\u201cThis is important and necessary, and we welcome the government\u2019s approach to\nworking hand in hand with us to get the mechanisms right.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Universities\n  * University of Oxford\n  * University of Cambridge\n  * Imperial College London\n  * MI5\n  * GCHQ\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Bernardine Evaristo joins calls to save Goldsmiths\u2019 Black British literature MA\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### How the dung queen of Dublin was swept from history\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### German university rescinds Jewish American\u2019s job offer over pro-Palestinian letter\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Creative arts courses at English universities face funding cut\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Tory immigration policies risk over-reliance on Chinese students, ex-universities minister warns\n\n31 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Sunak\u2019s student visas clampdown continues boom-and-bust pattern\n\n31 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Sadiq Khan pledges new Erasmus-style overseas study scheme for London youngsters\n\n30 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Britain\u2019s universities are in freefall \u2013 and saving them will take more than funding\n\n29 Mar 2024\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Education\n  * Schools\n  * Teachers\n  * Universities\n  * Students\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
