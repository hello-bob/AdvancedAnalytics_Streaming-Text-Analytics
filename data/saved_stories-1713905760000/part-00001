By making prompt engineering possible directly in Langfuse, we take\nanother step in our mission to build a feature-complete LLM engineering\nplatform that helps you along the full live cycle of your LLM application.\n\nWith the LLM playground, you can now test and iterate your prompts directly in\nLangfuse. Either start from scratch or jump into the playground from an\nexisting prompt in your project. You can then tweak the prompt and the model\nparameters to see how the model responds to different inputs. This way, you\ncan quickly iterate on your prompts to get the best results for your LLM app.\n\nThe LLM playground currently support all major models from both OpenAI and\nAnthropic, and we're planning on adding more model providers in the future.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using the LLM playground. Let us know what you think in the\nGitHub discussion (opens in a new tab), and stay tuned for more updates during\nLangfuse Launch Week 1 \ud83d\ude80\n\n### Learn more\n\nPlayground docs\n\nLast updated on April 23, 2024\n\n### Was this page useful?\n\n### Questions?
