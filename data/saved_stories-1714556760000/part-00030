But\nexperts disagree\n\nPublished Tue, Apr 30 20241:04 AM EDT\n\nSawdah Bhaimiya\n\nShare\n\nJose Luis Pelaez Inc | Digitalvision | Getty Images\n\nIs being nice holding you back at work?\n\nOne viral TikTok has young workers up in arms about the perils of being\npleasant in the workplace.\n\nA TikToker who goes by the name Jacqueline recently posted a TikTok video\nwhere she claimed that people who are \u201ca pleasure to work with\u201d will \u201cnever\nget promoted.\u201d\n\nThe video has struck a nerve and has now racked up 8 million views and 900,000\nlikes.\n\nJacqueline says in the video that executives \u201cwill never allow an employee who\nis both good at doing the work and good at keeping a smile on their face while\ndoing the work move up the ladder, because they know they can keep serving you\nsh-t on a platter and you\u2019ll eat it with a smile.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cYou will never be promoted out of a hardworking more junior\nposition where a lot of the hard work exists ... If you are in an executive\nsuite, you do not have to be a pleasure to work with or good at your job.\u201d\n\nTikTok users in the comment section largely agreed with Jacqueline and put a\nname to her theory called \u201cperformance punishment\u201d where good workers are\nassigned more tasks as a consequence of being reliable and effective.\n\nAlthough the stereotype that jerks are more successful has long persisted,\nevidence suggests otherwise.\n\nA 2020 study by Cameron Anderson, a professor of organizational behavior at\nthe Haas School of Business at University of California, Berkeley, found that\npeople with disagreeable personalities do not progress any faster in the\nworkplace than agreeable people.\n\nThe study used results from a personality test taken by college students and\ngraduates 14 years prior and how their careers turned out after.\n\nIt found that disagreeable people had two distinct traits that canceled out\nany career gains. This is that they were dominant and assertive which helped\nthem attain power, but they were also more selfish and less communal which is\na trait viewed negatively by coworkers.\n\n### How to get ahead\n\nYou can reap certain benefits by being pleasant at work, especially if you can\nmake your colleagues\u2019 lives easier, according to Andrew Brodsky, a management\nprofessor at the University of Texas at the McCombs School of Business.\n\n\u2032\u2032Helping other people and being other-oriented can give you the benefit that\npeople trust you more, which means access to a variety of resources, like\ninformation that not everyone in the organization has access to,\u201d Brodsky said\nto CNBC Make It.\n\n\u201cYou can also gain status by being seen as someone who\u2019s useful to everyone\nand others like to reward those who they feel like are deserving. There\u2019s a\nlot of benefits to being other-oriented like we like nice people and we do\nnice things for those people,\u201d he added.\n\nA 2022 study by researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the\nUniversity of Iowa and Purdue University looked at the outcomes of prosocial\nmotivation in the workplace \u2014 meaning people who like to help others.\n\nIt found through an analysis of 200 studies that workers with high levels of\nprosocial motivations experience greater wellbeing, career advancement, and\njob performance.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s a popular view that most CEOs are narcissists, Ryan Vogel, an\nassociate professor at the Fox School of Business and Management at Temple\nUniversity, said this isn\u2019t necessarily true.\n\nPeople who do things for others and are open to the idea of reciprocating good\nthings \u201cdo better for themselves in their careers,\u201d Vogel told CNBC Make It.\n\u201cPeople want to be associated with those kinds of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cNarcissists are quite good at pulling the wool over people\u2019s eyes momentarily\nbut eventually people catch on,\u201d he added. \u201cYes, there are a lot of CEOs that\nare narcissists but there\u2019s a lot of CEOs that are not narcissists as well.\nNot every narcissist wins the tournament and ends up as a CEO.\u201d\n\nHowever, there are some caveats to being too nice.\n\n### \u2032Pleasant people don\u2019t bend over backwards\u2019\n\nIn Jacqueline\u2019s TikTok video, she conflates having a pleasant personality with\nbeing a pushover, according to Vogel.\n\n\u201cA pushover would be like anchoring the far end of the scales of high\nagreeableness,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cI would say, pleasant is not necessarily as high\non agreeableness. Pleasant people don\u2019t bend over backwards. They\u2019re not\nnecessarily people pleasers but they treat people civilly.\u201d\n\nBrodsky agrees with this view and says that being too \u201cother-oriented\u201d can\nsometimes backfire because you lose focus on your own self-interests.\n\n\u201cWhen that happens, you might not fight for your self-interest as much as you\nneed which at times can be necessary in organizations.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason the video has been such a hit on social media is that\npeople\u2019s expectations of corporate loyalty has been violated in recent years\nand workers have become much more critical of leaders as a result, according\nto Brodsky.\n\n\u201cThe work relationship has changed over the past number of decades. It used to\nbe you work 40 years at an organization, you get a gold watch or whatever and\nthen you retire. Now, there isn\u2019t very much corporate loyalty and especially\nright now, in the time of layoffs,\u201d Brodsky says.\n\n\u201cWhen you have organizations that aren\u2019t loyal to their employees, you would\nexpect that employees become less loyal to their organizations.\u201d\n\n#### Stay in the loop\n\nGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inbox\n\nSign Up\n\n#### About Us\n\nLearn more about the world of CNBC Make It\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Follow Us\n\nCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel\n\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.
