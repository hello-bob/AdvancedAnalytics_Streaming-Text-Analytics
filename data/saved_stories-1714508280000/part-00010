[+] online.\n\nGetty Images\n\n## Key Facts\n\nAn AI chatbot, called \u201cgpt2-chatbot,\u201d made a low-profile appearance on a\nwebsite used to compare different AI systems, LMSYS Chatbot Arena.\n\nThe bot\u2019s origins are not clear but its name references OpenAI\u2019s GPT-2, a\nlarge language model that preceded the lab\u2019s more advanced GPT-3 and GPT-4\nsystems that it uses to power tools like ChatGPT.\n\nThe mystery chatbot appears to match, and potentially exceed, the capabilities\nof GPT4, OpenAI\u2019s most advanced AI system yet, according to VentureBeat,\nciting a variety of AI experts posting about the model on social media; OpenAI\ndid not immediately respond to Forbes\u2019 request for comment on the chatbot.\n\nIt does, however, appear to fall short of what would be expected for OpenAI\u2019s\nhotly anticipated model GPT-5, the outlet reported, sparking speculation it\ncould be a potential update to its current system, GPT-4, perhaps in the form\nof GPT-4.5.\n\nSpeculation that the model is the work of OpenAI grew after the lab\u2019s CEO and\ncofounder Sam Altman said \u201cI do have a soft spot for gpt2\u201d in a post on X,\nformerly Twitter.\n\nAltman\u2019s post was later edited after posting to bring the model\u2019s name in line\nwith mystery chatbot\u2019s name \u2014 an earlier version referred to the model as\n\u201cgpt-2,\u201d in fitting with OpenAI\u2019s nomenclature \u2014 which, alongside the tweet\u2019s\ntiming, suggests he is talking about this new system rather than fondly\nremembering the past.\n\n## Tangent\n\nThe term \u201cGPT-2\u201d is trending on X following the release of the mystery\nchatbot, with many users speculating as to the mystery bot\u2019s origin and\nsharing thoughts on its capabilities.\n\n## What To Watch For\n\nOpenAI is widely expected to be gearing up for the release of its next major\nmodel, GPT-5, this summer. GPT-4 was released just over a year ago and since\nthen companies have raced to build and deploy better models to stay relevant\nin the fast-moving AI space. This race is heating up ahead of GPT-5\u2019s expected\nrelease and big players including Meta, Google and Mistral have all released\nnew versions of their leading systems within the past month or so, with even\nmore updates expected over the coming months.\n\n## Forbes Valuation\n\nAltman is worth $1 billion, Forbes estimates. While best known for cofounding\nand leading OpenAI, Altman has no equity in the company. Instead, Altman owes\nhis fortune and billionaire status to a series of valuable investments,\nincluding stakes in newly floated Reddit, fintech darling Stripe and nuclear\nfusion venture Helion. Prior to his work at OpenAI, Altman founded social\nmapping company Loopt and served as partner and president at startup\naccelerator Y Combinator.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nForbesData Activists Target OpenAI In Challenge To ChatGPT's 'Hallucination'\nProblemBy Robert Hart\n\nForbesChip Stocks Boom As Google And Microsoft's Big Bets On AI Start Paying\nOffBy Robert HartForbesElon Musk Says Tesla's Humanoid Optimus Robot Could\nLaunch Next Year-Here's What Experts ThinkBy Robert Hart\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
