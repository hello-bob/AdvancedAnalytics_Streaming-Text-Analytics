This meta-analysis was performed to assess the dose-\nresponse relationship between sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\n\nPubMed and Embase were searched up to 20 March 2014 for prospective\nobservational studies that assessed the relationship of sleep duration and\nrisk of type 2 diabetes. Both semiparametric and parametric methods were used.\n\nRESULTS\n\nTen articles with 11 reports were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis.\nA total of 18,443 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were ascertained among\n482,502 participants with follow-up periods ranging from 2.5 to 16 years. A\nU-shaped dose-response relationship was observed between sleep duration and\nrisk of type 2 diabetes, with the lowest risk observed at a sleep duration\ncategory of 7\u20138 h per day. Compared with 7-h sleep duration per day, the\npooled relative risks for type 2 diabetes were 1.09 (95% CI 1.04\u20131.15) for\neach 1-h shorter sleep duration among individuals who slept <7 h per day and\n1.14 (1.03\u20131.26) for each 1-h increment of sleep duration among individuals\nwith longer sleep duration.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOur dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies shows a U-shaped\nrelationship between sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes, with the\nlowest type 2 diabetes risk at 7\u20138 h per day of sleep duration. Both short and\nlong sleep duration are associated with a significantly increased risk of type\n2 diabetes, underscoring the importance of appropriate sleep duration in the\ndelay or prevention of type 2 diabetes.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAccording to the International Diabetes Federation, the estimated number of\ndiabetic patients worldwide was 382 million in 2013 and will rise to 592\nmillion by 2035 (1). Given its significant burden, it is imperative to\nidentify modifiable lifestyle factors associated with lower risk of diabetes.\nSleep is a biobehavioral phenomenon that is regulated by circadian,\nhomeostatic, and neurohormonal processes (2). In the past few years,\nsuboptimal sleep duration, especially short sleep, as a disorder character\nrising out of the 24-h lifestyle of modern societies, has increasingly been\nshown to represent an additional behavioral factor adversely affecting public\nhealth (3\u20137).\n\nSeveral studies have reported a U-shaped association between sleep duration\nand type 2 diabetes (8,9), but other studies have not found a uniform\nrelationship (10,11). One previous meta-analysis suggested that both short and\nlong sleep duration were associated with risk of type 2 diabetes (12).\nHowever, the definitions of short and long sleep duration differed between\nstudies, which complicated the interpretation of the pooled results. In\naddition, without a dose-response analysis, it remains unknown how many hours\nof habitual sleep are associated with the lowest risk of type 2 diabetes. In\nthe past several years, the number of prospective studies with enough\nquantitative categories has nearly doubled (13\u201322). Therefore, we conducted a\nmeta-analysis of prospective studies to determine the overall shape of the\nrelationship between sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\n## Research Design and Methods\n\n### Data Sources and Searches\n\nWe conducted a literature search (up to 20 March 2014) of PubMed (Medline) and\nEmbase for prospective studies examining the association between sleep\nduration and risk of type 2 diabetes. PubMed search terms were (\u201cDiabetes\nMellitus\u201d [Mesh] OR \u201cdiabetes\u201d [All Fields]) AND sleep. Similar search terms\nwere used for Embase. In addition, we reviewed references from relevant\noriginal papers and review articles to identify additional eligible studies.\nNo language restrictions were imposed. We followed the standard guidelines for\nconducting and reporting meta-analyses of observational studies (23).\n\n### Study Selection\n\nStudies were included in this meta-analysis if they satisfied the following\ncriteria: the study design was prospective, the exposure of interest was sleep\nduration, the outcome was type 2 diabetes, and the investigators reported\nrelative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs for at least three quantitative categories\nof short sleep or long sleep duration. We excluded animal studies, clinical\ntrials, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, reviews, commentaries,\nletters, and studies that examined other associations. If study populations\nwere reported more than once, we used the result with the longest follow-up\nduration. Two investigators (Z.S. and M.X.) independently screened all studies\nby title or abstract and then by a full text evaluation. Any discrepancy\nbetween the two authors was solved by discussion with the senior investigator\n(W.B.).\n\n### Data Extraction and Quality Assessment\n\nWe extracted the following information from each study: authors, year of\npublication, study name, study location, years of follow-up, sample size\n(number of participants and incident cases), participant characteristics (age\nand sex), type 2 diabetes assessment, sleep duration categories, covariates\nadjusted in the multivariable analysis, and RRs (95% CIs) for all categories\nof sleep duration.\n\nQuality assessment was performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality\nAssessment Scale (NOS) (24), which is a validated scale for nonrandomized\nstudies in meta-analyses. This scale awards a maximum of 9 points to each\nstudy: 4 for selection of participants and measurement of exposure, 2 for\ncomparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis, and 3 for\nassessment of outcomes and adequacy of follow-up. We assigned scores of 0\u20133,\n4\u20136, and 7\u20139 for low, moderate, and high quality of studies, respectively.\nWhen studies had several adjustment models, we extracted those that reflected\nthe maximum extent of adjustment for potentially confounding variables.\n\nTo perform a dose-response meta-analysis, we assigned the median or mean sleep\nduration in each category of duration to the corresponding RR for each study.\nIf the mean or median duration per category was not reported, the midpoint of\nthe upper and lower boundaries in each category was assigned. When the\nshortest or the longest category was open-ended, we assumed that the open-\nended interval length had the same length as the adjacent interval.\n\n### Data Synthesis and Analysis\n\nIn this meta-analysis, the RRs and 95% CIs were considered as the effect size\nfor all studies. Since the incidence of type 2 diabetes is sufficiently low,\nodds ratios were deemed equivalent to RRs.\n\nTo analyze the trend of sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes, we used\nboth semiparametric and parametric methods. For the semiparametric method,\ntaking the analysis of short sleep duration for example, three groups (namely\nshortest, second shortest, and reference) were generated. For each included\nstudy, the shortest and the reference categories corresponded to the shortest\nand reference groups, respectively. For studies with three categories, the\nsecond categories corresponded to the second shortest group. If the study had\nmore than three categories, one group, other than the shortest and reference,\nwas chosen on the basis of their similarity of the duration of sleep in that\ncategory to the second shortest group. For each group, a random-effects model\nwas used to pool the RR of type 2 diabetes. The same method was used in the\nanalysis for long sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFor the parametric method, we used a random-effects dose-response meta-\nanalysis described by Greenland (25) to calculate the trend from the\ncorrelated estimates for log RR across categories of sleep duration. The\ndistributions of cases and participants, and RRs and 95% CIs, in each sleep\nduration category were extracted according to this method. Additionally, we\ntested for potential nonlinearity in the association between sleep duration\nand type 2 diabetes using a fixed-effect restricted cubic spline model with\nfour knots at percentiles 5, 35, 65, and 95% of the distribution. We\ncalculated absolute risk differences as background incidence rate \u00d7 (RR \u2212 1).\n\nThe heterogeneity among studies was estimated by the Cochran Q test and I^2\nstatistic. Heterogeneity was considered statistically significant at P \u2264 0.10.\nThe I^2 statistic describes the percentage of total variation in point\nestimates that can be attributed to heterogeneity. For the I^2 metric, we\nconsidered low, moderate, and high I^2 values to be 25, 50, and 75%,\nrespectively (26). To explore the sources of heterogeneity among studies and\nto test the robustness of the associations, we conducted subgroup analyses by\nstudy location, number of participants, duration of follow-up, and study\nquality, as well as several sensitivity analyses. The possibility of\npublication bias was assessed using the Egger regression asymmetry test (27).\nFor sensitivity analysis, we also used the fixed-effects model for all the\nabove analyses. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed by omitting one\nstudy at a time and calculating a pooled estimate for the remainder of the\nstudies to evaluate whether the results were affected markedly by a single\nstudy. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 12 (Stata\nCorp), and all tests were two sided with a significance level of 0.05.\n\n## Results\n\n### Literature Search\n\nFigure 1 shows the results of our literature research and study selection. We\nidentified 610 articles from PubMed and 759 articles from Embase prior to 20\nMarch 2014. After exclusion of duplicates and studies that did not fulfill the\ninclusion criteria, 14 remaining articles seemed to be relevant for this meta-\nanalysis. After evaluating the full texts of these 14 publications, we further\nexcluded 4 articles (10,11,28,29) due to a lack of sufficient data for\nestimation of dose-response analysis. In addition, we included the report of\nthe control group, and not the intervention group, in the study by Tuomilehto\net al. (18). In the study by Kita et al. (16), the results were separated\naccording to the presence or absence of a family history of diabetes (FHD), so\nwe treated it as two separate reports. In total, our meta-analysis included 10\narticles (13\u201322) with 11 independent reports.\n\nFigure 1\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nFlow diagram of literature search and study selection.\n\nFigure 1\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nFlow diagram of literature search and study selection.\n\nClose modal\n\n### Study Characteristics\n\nCharacteristics of all 10 studies were shown in Table 1. The duration of\nfollow-up for incident type 2 diabetes ranged from 2.5 to 16 years, with a\nmedian follow-up of 7.5 years. Five studies were conducted in the U.S.\n(14,17,20\u201322), two in Europe (15,18), two in Asia (16,19), and one in\nAustralia (13). Sleep duration was assessed by questionnaire in all studies.\nIn six studies (13\u201315,17,20,21), type 2 diabetes was ascertained by medical\nrecords or self-reports; the outcome of four studies (16,18,19,22) was\nassessed by means of a fasting plasma glucose or a glucose tolerance test. One\nstudy was a substudy of a prospective lifestyle intervention trial (18), and\nthe remaining nine were prospective cohort studies. The mean NOS score was 6.7\n(of a possible 9 points), suggesting the high quality of the studies included\nin the meta-analysis.\n\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of prospective studies of sleep duration intake in relation to\nincident type 2 diabetes\n\nAuthor .| Publication year .| Country .| Sex of population .| Sample size .|\nNo. of diabetes cases .| Age at baseline (years) .| Follow-up (years) .| Study\noutcome and ascertainment .| Comparison categories and corresponding RR (95%\nCI) .| Covariates in fully adjusted model .| NOS (0\u20139 points) .  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nHolliday (13)| 2013| Australia| Both| 156,902| 3,641| \u226545| 2\u20133| Hospital\nrecord| <6, 1.29 (1.08\u20131.53);

Figure 3 shows the RRs for type 2 diabetes\nwith different levels of short sleep duration relative to the reference\ncategory. Compared with the reference category of sleep duration (7 h per\nday), the pooled RR for incident type 2 diabetes was 1.06 (95% CI 1.01\u20131.11,\nI^2 = 7.5%, P for heterogeneity = 0.37) for the second shortest (6 h per day)\nand 1.37 (1.18\u20131.59, I^2 = 57.1%, P = 0.017) for the shortest (\u22645 h per day)\ncategory of sleep duration (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, there was evidence\nfor substantial between-study heterogeneity in results for the shortest\ncategory of sleep duration.\n\nFigure 3\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nThe dose-response relationship plot between sleep duration (per hour) and risk\nof type 2 diabetes for short sleep (A) and long sleep (B).\n\nFigure 3\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nThe dose-response relationship plot between sleep duration (per hour) and risk\nof type 2 diabetes for short sleep (A) and long sleep (B).\n\nClose modal\n\nThe aforementioned nine reports were included in the dose-response analysis of\nshort sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes. We found no evidence of a\ncurvilinear association between short sleep duration and risk of type 2\ndiabetes (P = 0.22 for nonlinearity). Compared with 7 h sleep duration per\nday, the pooled RR for type 2 diabetes was 1.09 (95% CI 1.04\u20131.15) per 1-h\nreduction of sleep duration, with evidence of heterogeneity (I^2 = 63.5%, P =\n0.005) (Fig. 3A). Using the most recent incidence rate of type 2 diabetes for\nthe U.S. population (7.6 cases/1,000 population aged 18\u201379 years) (30), we\nestimated that 68 cases of diabetes per 100,000 individuals would occur each\nyear for every 1-h reduction of habitual sleep duration compared with 7 h per\nday.\n\n### Long Duration of Sleep and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes\n\nSeven studies were included in the semiparametric analysis on long sleep\nduration and risk of type 2 diabetes. The pooled RR for type 2 diabetes was\n1.11 (95% CI 0.97\u20131.28, I^2 = 59.0%, P = 0.023) for the second longest (8 h\nper day) and 1.40 (1.08\u20131.80, I^2 = 75.8%, P < 0.001) for the longest (\u22659 h\nper day) category of sleep duration (Supplementary Fig. 2). Substantial\nbetween-study heterogeneity was shown in results for both categories of long\nsleep duration.\n\nFor the dose-response analysis of long sleep duration with diabetes, six\nstudies above except one were included. No potentially nonlinear dose-response\nrelationship was detected (P = 0.90 for nonlinearity). The pooled RRs for type\n2 diabetes were 1.14 (95% CI 1.03\u20131.26) per 1-h increment of sleep duration\ncompared with 7 h, with evidence of heterogeneity (I^2 = 79.1%, P < 0.001)\n(Fig. 3B). The corresponding absolute risk difference was estimated to be 106\ncases of type 2 diabetes per 100,000 individuals per year per 1-h increase of\nsleep duration compared with 7 h per day.\n\n### Subgroup and Sensitivity Analysis\n\nSupplementary Table 1 shows the different subgroup dose-response analyses. The\nassociations between short and long sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes\ndid not differ substantially by study location, number of participants,\nduration of follow-up, or study quality.\n\nTo explore potential source of heterogeneity across studies, we carried out\nseveral sensitivity analyses. After excluding the study of Boyko et al. (14)\nfrom short sleep analysis, the heterogeneity decreased dramatically (I^2 =\n63.5\u201323.5%), but no similar impact of a single study was observed on the\nheterogeneity of long sleep analysis. From the results of the subgroup\nanalyses by number of participants (\u226510,000 or <10,000), it was implied that\nthe number of participants might be a potential source of heterogeneity for\nlong sleep duration analysis (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nTo further confirm the robustness of the results, the dose-response analyses\nwere repeated using a fixed-effects model; the pooled estimates were\nconsistent for short and long sleep duration in relation to risk of type 2\ndiabetes. Sensitivity analyses omitting one study at a time did not\nsubstantially alter the pooled results for short sleep duration and risk of\ntype 2 diabetes, but the pooled results of the remaining studies were\nborderline (1.09 [0.99\u20131.12]) by omission of the study by Tuomilehto et al.\n(18) for long sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes (Supplementary Fig.\n3).\n\n### Assessment of Publication Bias\n\nBegg and Egger regression tests provided no evidence of substantial\npublication bias (P > 0.05 for both tests).\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this meta-analysis of prospective studies, we found that the association\nbetween sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes followed a U-shaped manner;\nboth short and long sleep duration were associated with a significantly\nelevated risk of type 2 diabetes. Compared with 7 h per day, an hour decrease\nwas associated with a 9% and an hour increase of sleep duration was associated\nwith a 14% increased risk of diabetes in the overall population.\n\n### Results in Relation to Other Studies\n\nThere has been some debate about the relationship between sleep duration and\ntype 2 diabetes, and the results of published epidemiologic studies have been\ninconsistent (31). One possible reason is that categories of sleep duration\ndiffered across studies. For example, the definitions of short sleep duration\nranged from \u22645 to \u22647 h per day (10,21,29). Consistent with our results, a\nprevious meta-analysis indicated both short and long sleep duration were\nassociated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but they did not use a\ndose-response analysis to determine the overall shape of the association (12).\nIn our analysis, we found a U-shaped association between sleep duration and\nrisk of type 2 diabetes, with the lowest risk of type 2 diabetes at a sleep\nduration of 7\u20138 h per day in our analysis, which could contribute to\nrecommendations regarding appropriate sleep duration for future intervention\nstudies. A recent study has shown that both habitual short and long sleep\nduration were indicated to be associated with risk of obesity in younger (<40\nyears) but not in older women (>40 years) (32). However, the U-shaped\nassociation was still observed when we restricted to the studies that were\nconducted in subjects older than 40 years. Furthermore, racial/ethnic and sex\ndifferences have been reported in the risk of type 2 diabetes by sleep\nduration (10,11), but we could not investigate these differences due to\nlimited data from the original studies.\n\nPotential mechanisms linking sleep to diabetes may differ between short and\nlong sleep. Several potential biologic mechanisms may contribute to the\nrelation of short sleep duration and diabetes. First, laboratory studies have\ncorroborated and extended the decreases in glucose tolerance and insulin\nsensitivity after sleep restriction, as shown by increased hepatic glucose\nproduction and reduced peripheral glucose disposal (33\u201337). A recent research\nindicated that slow wave sleep suppression but not rapid eye movement sleep\ndisturbance during nocturnal sleep plays a key role in the regulation of\nglucose (38). Changes in the activity of neuroendocrine systems seem to be\nmajor mediators of the detrimental metabolic effects of insufficient sleep\n(31). Increased sympathetic nerve activity may result in reduced \u03b2-cell\nresponsiveness and inadequate pancreatic insulin secretion (33,39), while\nincreased uptake of glucose by total sleep\u2013 or slow wave sleep\u2013deprived brain\ncould result in increased circulating levels of glucose and postprandial\ninsulin-to-glucose ratio (38). Both inadequate insulin and enhanced glucose\ncould lead to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.\nMeanwhile, sleep disruption during the night is associated with decreased\ntestosterone and melatonin secretion, and it was possible that sleep\ndisruption was related to diabetes via a mechanism of testosterone or\nmelatonin (40,41). However, a recent study also found that restricting sleep\ncould result in an insulin-resistant state in human adipocytes through\nreduction of phosphorylation of AKT, which indicated that sleep might be an\nimportant regulator of energy metabolism in peripheral tissues (42). AKT\nsignaling plays a central role in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in both\nmuscle and adipose tissue, which was established in rat and human studies\n(43,44). Reduced phosphorylation of AKT is linked to insulin resistance\nthrough negative insulin receptor substrate functions (45), reduced\nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity (46), and impaired\nphosphorylation of the AKT substrate AS160 (47). Second, associated with\nhunger/appetite and caloric intake due to increases in ghrelin and decreases\nin leptin, short sleep may lead to greater time to eat as well as fatigue\nleading to lower physical activity levels, thereby increasing risk of weight\ngain and subsequent health risks (39,48). Meanwhile, short sleep duration was\nassociated with depressive symptoms, low socioeconomic status, low education,\nand other risk factors of diabetes (8,49). Individuals with sleep loss,\nespecially shift workers, also have irregular sleep schedules, which could\nresult in circadian misalignment and augment markers of insulin resistance and\ninflammation independently of sleep loss (50). Finally, short sleep duration\nhas been associated with increases of inflammatory markers (51), such as\nC-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which indicate low-level systemic\ninflammation and play a role in diabetes development (52).\n\nThe potential mechanisms underlying the association between long sleep\nduration and increased diabetes risk are currently considered more\nspeculative. First, long sleep duration was suggested to be associated with\nsome risk factors of incidence of diabetes such as depression, low\nsocioeconomic status, undiagnosed medical disease, poor physical health, and\nlow physical activity (49,53). However, using the maximum extent of adjustment\nfor potentially confounding variables in our study, the pooled result between\nlong sleep duration and risk of diabetes is still significant. Second,\nobstructive sleep apnea is a known cause of increased need for sleep and has\nbeen identified as a risk factor for insulin resistance and diabetes (54).\nFinally, short and long sleep duration were associated with increased levels\nof inflammation markers (55,56), and it is possible that sleep disruption is\nrelated to diabetes via a mechanism of low-grade systemic inflammation.\nHowever, it is also possible that long sleep is a consequence of the sleep-\ninducing effects of the inflammatory state (57).\n\n### Strengths and Limitations\n\nThis meta-analysis has several strengths. All studies included in our meta-\nanalysis used a prospective design; thus, the differential misclassification\nof sleep duration attributable to recall bias was minimized. The mean NOS\nscore of 6.7 ensured the relatively high quality of the included studies.\nMoreover, we investigated a dose-response relation between sleep duration and\nrisk of type 2 diabetes, allowing us to examine the shape of this possible\nassociation. Linear and nonlinear relations were also tested to quantify the\nassociations.\n\nSeveral limitations of our study should also be acknowledged. First, we may\nnot have identified some studies that were unpublished or published in other\nlanguages. Second, all the studies relied on self-reported sleep duration,\nwhereas actigraphy and polysomnography (the gold standard) may provide more\nobjective measures. However, objective measures of sleep duration are\nexpensive and therefore they may not be feasible in large prospective cohort\nstudies. In addition, a previous validation study observed a moderate\ncorrelation (r = 0.47) between self-reported sleep duration and measured sleep\nduration using wrist actigraphy (58). In addition, only one included study\ndefined diabetes based upon formal glucose tolerance testing. Third, sleep\nduration was assessed at one time point in most studies, and participants may\nhave changed their sleep pattern during the follow-up. Thus, it is possible\nthat a single measure of exposure may not fully capture the sustained effects\nof sleep duration over time on long-term risk of type 2 diabetes. Fourth, a\nmeta-analysis of observational data, though prospective, cannot directly\ncontrol for residual or unmeasured confounding. We made an attempt to allow\nfor multiple confounding by including adjusted estimates from multivariate\nmodels from each contributing study. However, due to limited data from the\noriginal studies, we were unable to stratify studies by race/ethnicity and\nsex, although this represents an important area for future research. Finally,\nsleep quality affected by factors like sleep apnea is an independent predictor\nof diabetes risk (12), but it was not assessed in our study.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, our dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies shows a\nU-shaped relationship between sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes, with\nthe lowest type 2 diabetes risk at 7\u20138 h per day of sleep duration. Both short\nand long sleep duration are associated with an elevated risk of type 2\ndiabetes. Longer-term randomized controlled trials are needed to establish\ncausality and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.\n\n## Article Information\n\nFunding.
