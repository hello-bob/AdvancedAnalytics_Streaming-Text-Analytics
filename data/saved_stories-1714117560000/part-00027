Garry, the eponymous creator of the game, confirmed on\nTwitter/X today that there is no mistake, Nintendo themselves issued the major\ntakedown notice.\n\n> I have been assured that the takedowns have been verified by Nintendo as\n> legit, so this will now continue as planned. Sorry. \ud83e\udef8\ud83c\udf44\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0fApril 25, 2024\n\nSee more\n\nGarry's Mod players spent the first hours after the announcement questioning\nwhether Nintendo truly issued the takedown, pinning the potential blame on\ntrolls. However, Garry took to the internet to confirm Nintendo's involvement.\nHe tweeted, \"I have been assured that the takedowns have been verified by\nNintendo as legit, so this will now continue as planned. Sorry. \ud83e\udef8\ud83c\udf44\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\" The\nGarry's Mod Steam page notes that the process of complying with the takedown\nwill take much time, adding \"If you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo\nrelated uploads and never uploading them again, that would help us a lot.\"\n\nNintendo has a reputation for bringing litigation to companies that it belives\nharm its brand. The company received news coverage most recently for a lawsuit\nagainst the Yuzu Switch emulator, arguing in their suit that all emulation in\nany form is illegal. This move angered game preservation and emulation\nenthusiasts. Today's Garry's Mod takedown is harder to argue with, as ripping\nor copying copyrighted assets is fair game for a DMCA request.\n\nGarry's Mod will likely spark good memories longtime PC gamers. The Steam\ndarling has been a fixture of the PC gaming landscape since 2006, inspiring\nmany eras of internet culture like the multiplayer game modes Prop Hunt and\nMafia-like Trouble in Terrorist Town which have seen extensive imitations in\nAAA games, and years of YouTube animations culminating in 2023 megahit Skibidi\nToilet. The sandbox game is known for the massive workshop of user-made\ncreations, which Nintendo took issue with when it discovered years' worth of\nripped Nintendo assets in-game.\n\nIf you're feeling nostalgic and looking to boot Garry's Mod back up on your\nPC, it will thankfully run on almost any computer produced in the last 10\nyears. But if you're looking for an excuse to upgrade anyways, consider our\nmost recent build guide on PCs at any budget.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

Why can\u2019t they just let people\nuse their work non commercially? I would understand if people were making\nmoney off it, but this isn\u2019t the first time that nintendo has done something\nanti consumer.\n\nReply\n\n  * bigdragon\n\nNintendo is absolutely out of control. This is the sort of action that does\nbrand and reputation damage. Most of these mods obviously fall under fair use.\nA lot of the mods create ways for people to engage with Nintendo properties in\na way that amplifies the value of their IP too. There is no negative\ncommercial impact here.\n\nI'm going to be looking for ways to stick it to Nintendo in retaliation for\nthese takedowns. Hopefully many people feel the same way.\n\nReply\n\n  * FR33L35T3R\n\ni have a thought to people who spent time to makes all that content. Then\nNintendo throw away all that work for no reason.\n\nReply\n\n  * YouFilthyHippo\n\n> Order 66 said:\n>\n> Why does Nintendo have to be so anti consumer?!

If they sue some 10 year old kid who uses\na self-hand-drawn blown up Mario background as his backdrop for a school\nspeech about the video game industry, and the school awarded him a 100$ gift\ncard to a toy store because of how well done his speech was, Nintendo will\nclaim that the child made money off their IP.\n\nThey will sue, and Nintendo will win, or the students parents will settle for\n$50K in damages that don't actually exist because it would cost less than\ngoing to court. There are no actual damages. Nintendo just does this to \"send\na message\" to the world. Problem is: Copyright laws enable this. The copyright\nlaws as they are need a serious overhall and rework, as right now they\nseverely stifle innovation and creativity amongst gamers. This is just one\nexample.\n\nReply\n\n  * hotaru251\n\nsadly for Nintendo once soemthigns on the net it doesnt go away.\n\nAlready a subreddit getting people together to preserve the content being\nremoved.\n\nReply\n\n  * oofdragon\n\nNintendo became the scum of gaming world not only by keeping themselves their\nIP from growing and shining selling really lackluster potat.. I mean hardware,\nbut also by trashing their fans and customers. Anytime now they are going\nafter Kaizo Mario lol, and that's actually a really good example of level\ndesign done right. They could have learnt something with mods instead of\ntrying to take em down\n\nReply\n\n  * BigBoi69420\n\n> hotaru251 said:\n>\n> sadly for Nintendo once soemthigns on the net it doesnt go away.\n>\n> Already a subreddit getting people together to preserve the content being\n> removed.\n\n\"Sadly for nintendo\" lmao\n\nYeah, and luckily for us we can always find just about anything they try to\nnuke off of the internet. They tried to kill Switch emulation too but it ain't\ngoing anywhere. Can't wait to emulate the heck out of TTYD next month\n\nReply\n\n  * cryoburner\n\nYou guys do realize that the bulk of Garry's Mod content tends to be pretty\ntrash, right? I'm guessing much of the Nintendo related content on it was\nusing Nintendo's characters and properties in ways that was making them look\nbad. This isn't just user-generated content either. A lot of this is content\ndirectly ripped from Nintendo's games and ported into this game.\n\nAnd keep in mind that Garry's Mod is not just some free mod, as its name might\nimply. It's a title being sold on Steam that's made tens of millions of\ndollars, so its developer definitely has a responsibility to make sure content\nuploaded by its users is not infringing on the property of others.\n\nReply\n\n  * hotaru251\n\n> cryoburner said:\n>\n> so its developer definitely has a responsibility to make sure content\n> uploaded by its users is not infringing on the property of others.\n\nnormally yes but the games been out for 18 yrs....\n\nReply\n\n  * bit_user\n\n> The article said:\n>\n> Nintendo took issue with when it discovered years' worth of ripped Nintendo\n> assets in-game.\n\nFunny thing is, I dreamed of being able to do this as a young child, back in\nthe days of NES. I know I'm not the only one, and I had no idea how it would\nwork, but it seemed to me that it must somehow be possible to bring characters\nfrom one game into another.\n\nWell, I'm glad people had fun with it, while it lasted. And I do hope their\ncrackdowns somehow backfire on Nintendo.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nTSMC readies lower-cost 4nm manufacturing tech: Up to 8.5% cheaper\n\nQualcomm responds to benchmark cheating allegations \u2014 Snapdragon X Elite/Plus\nbenchmarks claimed to be fraudulent (Updated)\n\nTSMCs 2nm nodes get NanoFlex, N2P loses backside power delivery\n\nTSMC unveils 1.6nm process technology with backside power delivery, rivals\nIntel's competing design\n\nMore AMD Zen 5 CPUs spotted in Linux patch notes\n\nUS investigates China's access to RISC-V \u2014 open standard instruction set may\nbecome new site of US-China chip war\n\nFallout-inspired game runs in Excel \u2014 a spreadsheet-powered wasteland escape\nfrom your daily corporate wasteland\n\nAMD Strix Point engineering sample underwhelms in early Geekbench 6 results\n\nAMD-powered classic Macintosh Classic-Inspired mini PC available for retail \u2014\nAyaneo's new AM01 released after a successful Indiegogo campaign\n\nRaspberry Pi Compute Module 4S memory variants announced\n\nTSMC's labor practices draw serious concern in Arizona \u2014 the company's new\nchip plant allegedly plagued by worker abuses\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
