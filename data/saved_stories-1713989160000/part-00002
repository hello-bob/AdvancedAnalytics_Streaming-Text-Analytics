Imagine reclaiming up to 20 hours a month that\ndevelopers typically spend fixing minor bugs.\n\nWe're introducing FlyCI Wingman, your new AI partner that not only fixes your\nbuild errors but also integrates the solutions as comments directly into your\npull requests.\n\nSign-up for the beta version we expect to be available until the end of April.\nThen, continue reading to learn more about how FlyCI Wingman works and how to\nstart using it.\n\n## The Challenge of Failing Builds\n\nThrough more than 20 customer interviews conducted in the past few months, we\nhave learned that debugging a failing GitHub workflow ranks highly among the\nmost tedious and time-consuming tasks for developers. Various types of trivial\nfailures demand their attention and consume their time. This includes:\n\n  * lint errors\n  * workflows with if conditions that are not calculated properly\n  * a failing test among many\n  * updated 3rd party GitHub actions\n  * new version of tools installed on the runner\n  * etc.\n\nSo, instead of focusing on what matters most, developers need to switch\nbranches, do fixes, re-run workflows, and repeat paying the highest cost -\ntheir precious time.\n\n## Introducing FlyCI Wingman\n\nThis is where FlyCI Wingman - your AI debugging assistant, steps in to fix\nyour failing builds and allow you to focus on what matters most. Usage is\nsimple:\n\n  1. Login to the FlyCI Dashboard\n  2. Re-run the failing workflow with FlyCI AI\n  3. Let FlyCI Wingman fix the build for you\n\nAll you need to do after that is just review the PR with the suggested fixes\nand merge it to your working branch.\n\n## Benefits of Using FlyCI Wingman\n\nWith FlyCI Wingman\n\n  * Developers save time from debugging trivial CI failures\n  * Developers manage to focus on innovating the product they're building\n  * Businesses launch their products faster\n  * Products maintain consistent high quality\n\n## How It Works?\n\nWhat happens behind the scenes when you re-run a workflow with FlyCI Wingman?\n\n  1. FlyCI Wingman analyzes the error logs from the failure\n  2. The agent iteratively builds its context with the assistance of an LLM and it generates a fix\n  3. Once the fix is ready, FlyCI Wingman makes sure the build is successful\n  4. Finally, it suggests code changes to your PR\n\nAll you need to do is review and accept the code suggestions.\n\n## Security Note\n\nWe run the LLM in our private cloud without data or code leaving our\ninfrastructure. On the other hand, FlyCI Wingman service is part of the FlyCI\nephemeral runner where your workflow runs. So, no code or data is leaked. Once\nthe workflow finishes and you get your fixes, the runner is destroyed, and no\ncode or data is preserved.\n\nRead more about FlyCI Security measures.\n\n## Join the Beta Program\n\nAre you curious?
