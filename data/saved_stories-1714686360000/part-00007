Now, scientists have identified cells\nin the brainstem that sense immune cues from the periphery of the body and act\nas master regulators of the body\u2019s inflammatory response.\n\nThe results, published on 1 May in Nature^1, suggest that the brain maintains\na delicate balance between the molecular signals that promote inflammation and\nthose that dampen it \u2014 a finding that could lead to treatments for autoimmune\ndiseases and other conditions caused by an excessive immune response.\n\nThe discovery is akin to a black-swan event \u2014 unexpected but making perfect\nsense once revealed, says Ruslan Medzhitov, an immunologist at Yale University\nin New Haven, Connecticut. Scientists have known that the brainstem has many\nfunctions, such as controlling basic processes such as breathing. However, he\nadds, the study \u201cshows that there is whole layer of biology that we haven\u2019t\neven anticipated\u201d.\n\n## The brain is watching\n\nAfter sensing an intruder, the immune system unleashes a flood of immune cells\nand compounds that promote inflammation. This inflammatory response must be\ncontrolled with exquisite precision: if it\u2019s too weak, the body is at greater\nrisk of becoming infected; if it\u2019s too strong, it can damage the body\u2019s own\ntissues and organs.\n\nPrevious work has shown that the vagus nerve, a large network of nerve fibres\nthat links the body with the brain, influences immune responses. However, the\nspecific brain neurons that are activated by immune stimuli remained elusive,\nsays Hao Jin, a neuroimmunologist at the US National Institute of Allergy and\nInfectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, who led the work.\n\nTo investigate how the brain controls the body\u2019s immune response, Jin and his\ncolleagues monitored the activity of brain cells after injecting the abdomen\nof mice with bacterial compounds that trigger inflammation.\n\nHow the brain senses a flu infection \u2014 and orders the body to rest\n\nThe researchers identified neurons in the brainstem that switched on in\nresponse to the immune triggers. Activating these neurons with a drug reduced\nthe levels of inflammatory molecules in the mice\u2019s blood. Silencing the\nneurons led to an uncontrolled immune response, with the number of\ninflammatory molecules increasing by 300% compared with the levels observed in\nmice with functional brainstem neurons. These nerve cells act as \u201ca rheostat\nin the brain that ensures that an inflammatory response is maintained within\nthe appropriate levels\u201d, says study co-author Charles Zuker, a neuroscientist\nat Columbia University in New York City.\n\nFurther experiments revealed two discrete groups of neurons in the vagus\nnerve: one that responds to pro-inflammatory immune molecules and another that\nresponds to anti-inflammatory molecules. These neurons relay their signals to\nthe brain, allowing it to monitor the immune response as it unfolds. In mice\nwith conditions characterized by an excessive immune response, artificially\nactivating the vagal neurons that carry anti-inflammatory signals diminished\ninflammation.\n\n## Dampening autoimmune symptoms\n\nFinding ways to control this newly discovered body\u2013brain network would offer\nan approach to fixing broken immune responses in various conditions such as\nautoimmune diseases and even long COVID, a debilitating syndrome that can\npersist for years after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, Jin says.\n\nCracking the genetic code of autoimmune disease\n\nThere\u2019s evidence that therapies targeting the vagus nerve can treat diseases\nsuch as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that targeting\nthe specific vagal neurons that carry immune signals might work in people,\nZuker says. But, he cautions, \u201cit\u2019s a lot of work to go from here to there\u201d.\n\nBesides the neuronal network identified in the study, there might be other\nroutes through which the body transmits immune signals to the brain, says\nStephen Liberles, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School in Boston,\nMassachusetts. What\u2019s more, the mechanisms by which the brain sends signals\nback to the immune system to regulate inflammation remain unclear. \u201cWe\u2019re just\nscratching the surface,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to understand the rule book of how\nthe brain and the immune system interact.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01259-2\n\n## References\n\n  1.
