He won\u2019t share an\nexact playbook though, because such a thing doesn\u2019t exist: each individual has\na different path but can get inspiration from others. If you want to ask\nyourself the right questions, read on. By the way, a surprise may await you at\nthe end of this article ;-)\n\nAnd if you aren\u2019t subscribed yet, well, you know what to do (FREE weekly in-\ndepth articles in your inbox)\n\nThis article all started from Anant\u2019s talk at Elevate 2023:\n\nYou can follow Anant Gupta on LinkedIn.\n\n#\n\nHow to Thrive as an Engineering Leader (in a Pre-IPO Company)\n\nThere\u2019s no single playbook you can apply as an engineering leader \u2014 that\u2019s\npart of what makes this career so thrilling.\n\nBut because there are so many variables, including the stage of the company\nyou join, the maturity of your team, and the nature of the problems you\u2019re\nsolving, you could easily find yourself in a leadership position that\u2019s not\nright for you.\n\nI\u2019m Anant Gupta, Senior Vice President of Engineering and Data Science at\nIncluded Health. Throughout my career, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to take on\nleadership roles at several tech companies, both leading up to and after their\nIPO. I\u2019d like to share my learnings and observations on how to thrive as an\nengineering leader.\n\nIn my role at Included Health, where I\u2019ve been for about five years, I lead\nEngineering and Data Science\u2014a team of about 200 people. And if you\u2019re not\nfamiliar with Included Health, we\u2019re a health tech startup with a mission of\nbringing data and technology to raise the standard of healthcare. Prior to\nIncluded Health, I was a manager at LinkedIn and an engineering leader at\nUber, both pre- and post-IPO.\n\nThroughout each phase of my career, I have encountered moments \u2013 both through\ndirect experience and indirect observation \u2013 of what thriving can look like.\n\n##\n\nMy definition of thriving\n\nThriving is a term that\u2019s open to interpretation\u2014it means different things for\ndifferent people and it might even mean different things to the same person\nover the course of their life.\n\nThe way I look at it is that thriving is the alignment between your values,\nstrengths, and areas of growth.\n\nMy reflections on what I need to thrive in a role. I\u2019d encourage you to spend\ntime defining this for yourself!\n\nI believe you can thrive when you find the intersection of your values,\nstrengths, and areas of growth in a role and company.\n\nYour values are the things that matter to you, and you can use values as a way\nto filter the type of company you\u2019d like to work for. This can include\nelements like the company\u2019s mission, its stage of growth, the title or\nrecognition you\u2019d receive there, the technology you\u2019d be working with, and the\nimpact you\u2019d be likely to have in the role.\n\nYour strengths are the things that you are in the top 10% of. But it\u2019s not\njust about being good at something\u2014you need to find a place where you can use\nthose skills in a way that benefits the business and where you feel good about\nusing them.\n\nAnd your areas of growth are the things you\u2019ve decided you\u2019d like to get\nbetter at. Consider how you\u2019ll have the chance to develop these skills. Will\nyou get to practice? Will you have access to a mentor or coach? Again, it\u2019s\nimportant to look for ways your growth is aligned with the business\u2019s, or else\nit could easily get put on the back burner.\n\n##\n\n4 tactics to help you thrive\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got a working definition of thriving, let\u2019s consider a few\nstrategies to help you make this a reality in your own career.\n\n###\n\n1\\. Be at the right place for you\n\nIf you\u2019ve gone through the exercise of defining your values, strengths, and\nareas of growth that I outlined in the previous section, you\u2019ll now have a\nblueprint to help you find a company that\u2019s the right fit for you.\n\nHere\u2019s how I think about my values, strengths, and areas of growth.\n\nMy values mean I want to work at a mission-oriented company, a spot where I\nget to grow and be with people who are changing the world. I love working at\nstartups that are disrupting an industry. That gives me personal happiness and\nsatisfaction.\n\nMy top 10% strengths are building teams and organizations and making an impact\nat the pre-IPO to post-IPO stages.\n\nMy areas of growth are being the best leader I can be and creating excellent\norganizations.\n\nWhenever I evaluate a new role or company, I try to find alignment in these\nthree areas, and this is my advice to you. You first need to take the time to\ndefine what your ideal role and company would be and then try to find\nopportunities that are aligned with that.\n\nMy reflections on what I need to thrive in a role. I\u2019d encourage you to spend\ntime defining this for yourself!\n\nIdeally, you\u2019d define your values, strengths, and areas of growth and you\u2019d\nfind a company that\u2019s a perfect match in every area \u2014 But the reality is often\nmuch more ambiguous.\n\nEvery role can teach you something, every role can leverage your skills, and\nevery role could give you some of what you value. The clearer you are on what\nyou want (e.g. learning AI or working at a post-IPO company), the more limited\nyour choices will be.\n\nThe decision to choose a company will largely be a function of what you value.\nIf you get the value part right, the other two will follow. If you value\ngrowth, then you might need to be willing to compromise on compensation. Or if\nyou value cash compensation or title, you might need to be willing to forgo\nworking on a more appealing mission or working with a great manager or team.\n\nThis means you have to get values right. Are you being honest about what you\nvalue? I have seen this all too often when manager candidates say they want to\nwork at a small company (because they value growth and career upside) but they\nwant to run large teams when they start (because that\u2019s what they want to be\ndoing).\n\nThey\u2019ll need to make a decision: Do they value the growth they\u2019d get from\nmanaging a small team that\u2019s directly, causally changing the trajectory of the\nbusiness? Or is it more important for them to have the title and clout they\u2019d\nget from managing more people within a larger organization? There\u2019s no\njudgment or right answer here\u2014it\u2019s something everyone needs to reflect on and\nanswer for themselves.\n\nIf you\u2019re facing this type of decision, one tactic that can help is to ask\nyourself, \u201cWhat is the job after this one?\u201d If you fast-forwarded a few years\nin the future, what would that role look like? How do you feel about the\npotential future state of that role and its alignment with your values?\n\nAnother framework I\u2019ve used is to consider what will help you become the top\n10% of the role you seek. We tend to get fixated on title, status, and role,\nand celebrate \u201csuccess\u201d as getting the role; not being great at the role.\nHonestly ask yourself if this role gives you what you need to get there and if\nit increases your probability of success.\n\nOften applying these frameworks can help you narrow it down quite a bit. And\nif the answer is none of the roles, then it is better to wait if you can. I\nrecognize that waiting is a privilege and not always possible. If you\u2019re in a\nposition where you can\u2019t wait, it means that you value compensation or the job\nover the other items on the list. Again, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this\napproach. The important part is that you do this consciously because doing so\ncan accelerate your career and get you to where you want to be.\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll add that what \u201cthriving\u201d means to you will change throughout\nyour career. As I\u2019ve mentioned, what you value can fluctuate, your strengths\nwill evolve, and of course, the areas where you want to grow will also change,\ntoo. I\u2019d recommend taking time to re-evaluate your values, strengths, and\nareas of growth every three to five years. Doing it more frequently means you\nrisk day-trading your career.\n\n###\n\n2\\. Lean into the challenges\n\nWhen you join a startup, you\u2019re making trade-offs.\n\nYou may choose a future reward (in the form of equity, career growth, or\nimpact), which means losing out on certainty. Similarly, you may have greater\nautonomy, which comes with more ambiguity.\n\nSome of the common trade-offs we make when we choose to work at startups.\n\nWe may make these trade-offs consciously, or we may have done so without\nrealizing it. I\u2019ll often talk to managers who will tell me, \u201cIn my next role,\nI want to be able to have a strategic impact at my company.\u201d And five minutes\nlater, they\u2019ll ask me what they need to do and to tell them exactly what the\nroadmap is for their team for the next 12-18 months. They don\u2019t necessarily\nsee that these two things might be at odds.\n\nFirst, I\u2019d recommend you consider some of the trade-offs you\u2019re making when\nyou join a startup. I\u2019ve outlined several of them on the slide above. Do you\nfeel comfortable with prioritizing the things on the left (growth, future\nreward, faster learning, etc.) over the things on the right (comfort,\ncertainty, structured learning)? Great. A startup is probably the ideal\nsetting for you.\n\nNext, it\u2019s helpful to look at the types of challenges companies are likely to\nencounter based on their stage of growth and how that lines up with your\ninterests and strengths. Early-stage companies are trying to figure out how to\nship a 0 to 1 product and find product/market fit. Mid-stage companies are\nfocused on scaling the product. And late-stage companies are looking for how\nto scale the product across different verticals.\n\nSome of the common challenges startups face at different stages of growth.\nExperience has taught me I thrive in the mid-stage, but you\u2019ll need to explore\nwhat works best for you.\n\nOnce you\u2019re aware of the challenges you\u2019re likely to encounter, consider\nleaning into them rather than fighting them. Easier said than done, right?\n\nIf you join an early-stage company and it doesn\u2019t have product/market fit, you\ncan fight that, or lean into it and decide you\u2019re going to solve it. You may\nalso realize it\u2019s not a challenge you want to solve and you\u2019re not at the\nright place, in which case you\u2019d be better off finding another company and\nrole.\n\nWhen I was at LinkedIn, we went through a process where we re-evaluated our\ntechnical architecture and stack during a multi-month pause. It was a big\ndeal, but it propelled the company to be more successful.\n\nWe went through something similar at Uber\u2014we had a project called Darwin that\nwas trying to break up the monolith that Uber had and move faster.\n\nAnd we\u2019re undergoing a similar process at Included Health, where we\u2019re\nrefounding our technical systems that incorporate AI and product experiences\nat scale for millions of members.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that all startups are the same, but there are broad\nsimilarities that you can find in companies at various stages of growth\n(whether team size, product-market-fit stage, funding round, etc).\n\nIf you don\u2019t like working in a company that\u2019s optimizing to ship fast (and at\ntimes incurring tech debt), chances are working at an early-stage startup is\ngoing to be difficult for you because they generally start off working in a\nmonolith in order to move fast and find product/market fit. If you want to\nwork in a company where you get to break up that monolith, don\u2019t join an\nearly-stage startup because you\u2019ll be fighting the business. Join a mid-stage\nor later-stage company and seek those experiences out.\n\nLearn to recognize which trade-offs you\u2019re making and which problems are to be\nexpected at your company\u2019s stage. Instead of being perpetually unhappy or\nblaming where you are, consider whether the pain or frustration you\u2019re\nexperiencing is the flipside of the trade-off you\u2019ve made. This ties back to\nmy previous point about really understanding what you\u2019re looking for and\nmaking sure you\u2019re at the right place.\n\nBringing it back to my personal experience\u2014I\u2019m a technologist, and love\nbuilding products and experiences that make a user\u2019s experience 10x better.\nImagine trying to make search 10x better. Now imagine trying to make\nhealthcare 10x better. For me, making healthcare 10x better is a more\ninteresting problem, both technically and also around the dimensions of\nimpact.\n\nWhen I imagine my experience at a search company vs. a healthcare company, one\nis likely more known and is optimizing their software algorithms. The is other\nlesser known, with no less difficult technical problems to solve, but coupled\nwith real-world messiness. I could be upset that working in healthcare means\nit has lesser brand recognition, or I can embrace it and work to change that\nand create a world where our healthcare experiences are 10x better and\ntechnology-driven.\n\nAs an anecdote, I remember doing a tech talk at Uber explaining the technical\nchallenges at the company when I had first joined because I often had\ncandidates mention they couldn\u2019t understand what was difficult about Uber. In\nhindsight, that feels like an odd question, but this is the journey of\ndisrupting and changing an industry through technology, and because I\u2019ve been\nthrough it and seen the other side, I feel excitement for the opportunity and\nfuture ahead.\n\nYou need to have a point of view on where the world is going.\n\nOne final thing to note here: In order to choose the right company for you\n(especially if we\u2019re talking about early-stage, pre-IPO companies), you need\nto have a belief about the future. You need to have a point of view on where\nthe world is going. This can\u2019t be a reactive decision.\n\nIn today\u2019s landscape, for example, generative AI is already the next big\nthing. Having a long view allows you to focus on building your set of skills\nthat give you a competitive advantage in the long run (as opposed to trying to\nshoehorn your skills to match a job description). So think long term, and pick\nthe trade-offs you want.\n\nFocusing on the areas where I wanted to have a competitive advantage, I chose\nto join LinkedIn, Uber, and Included Health because, at that time, it gave me\nexposure and experience at the size and scale I was looking for. Being at Uber\nor LinkedIn today is vastly different from where they were when I joined, and\nit was precisely that learning and growth that I was optimizing for.\n\n###\n\n3\\. Make the \u201cand\u201d\n\nMy next piece of advice is to make the \u201cand.\u201d What does this mean? At\nstartups, you\u2019re going to constantly find yourself facing choices. Here are\njust a few examples:\n\n  * At LinkedIn, we acquired a company called Connected that was built entirely on Python/Django. LinkedIn\u2019s entire tech stack was all in Java. What do you do in that situation? Do you rebuild it all in Java or ship it faster?\n\n  * At Uber, we had to decide whether to build our own bikes and scooters or go with a partner. Building is capital-intensive, but partnering up could make our partner dominant in the space. There aren\u2019t many companies that can operate at Uber\u2019s scale.\n\n  * At Included Health, the market and industry are moving faster and faster. How do we keep up? Do we press our technical advantage in the market or pause and work through our tech stack?\n\nSome of the choices I\u2019ve faced at different points in my career. How would you\napproach these decisions?\n\nBut what if we reframed our approach? What if we thought of these problems as\nAND rather than OR?\n\nFor example:\n\n  * At LinkedIn, what if we rebuilt it in Java to integrate AND shipped faster?\n\n  * At Uber, what if we built our own scooters AND partnered with a company?\n\n  * At Included Health, what if we keep pressing the technical advantage AND investing in our tech stack for the future?\n\nNow let me be clear \u2013 the idea is not just to do it all, but it\u2019s to think\nabout the AND so you create a different set of choices. Are two things\nmutually exclusive? They may not be unless you change a different set of\nvariables.\n\nContinuing on with the same examples:\n\n  * At LinkedIn, we integrated the UI to learn sooner while building the data layer on LinkedIn\u2019s stack. This allowed us to make progress toward integration while gaining useful learnings about the product.\n\n  * At Uber, we jointly partnered to build Jump and Lime. This allowed us to prove a business model and have optionality in the future with Lime.\n\n  * At Included Health, we\u2019re prioritizing technology investments that unlock AI, Orchestration, and Total Care Platform. This means that while we may slow down in the short term, we plan to be considerably faster in the future.\n\nRemember that making the \u201cand\u201d isn\u2019t about dodging trade-offs.\n\nRemember that making the \u201cand\u201d isn\u2019t about dodging trade-offs\u2014you\u2019ll always\nhave trade-offs. It\u2019s about changing the \u201cor\u201d to an \u201cand,\u201d which produces a\ndifferent set of choices. More often than not, the different set of choices\nends up being a lot better.\n\nFinding the \u201cand\u201d doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for trade-offs, but it should\nhelp you end up with a better set of choices.\n\n###\n\n4\\. Invest in people\n\nOne of the challenges of a startup is you can\u2019t hire people fast enough to\nkeep up with what you want to do. Startups are trying to change the world and\nit\u2019s hard to do that with a small number of people, but that\u2019s the idea.\n\nWhen I was at LinkedIn, we were trying to take on companies like Indeed or\nMonster.com. Uber was trying to take on the entire taxi industry. Included\nHealth is aiming to raise the standard of healthcare for everyone and make an\nimpact on the $4 trillion US healthcare industry. Engineering creates leverage\nfor these types of businesses. We cannot make change at that scale unless we\nhave the right people and have invested in those people.\n\nYes, it sounds obvious that you need to invest in your people. But you need to\nspend time defining what that means for you as a leader.\n\nYou might be thinking, \u201cOf course, we need to invest in our people. No one\u2019s\ngoing to argue with that!\u201d While most people would agree that it\u2019s important\nto invest in your people, if you press them to elaborate, you\u2019ll find all\nkinds of different ways to interpret that phrase.\n\nSince we\u2019re focusing on technology leaders specifically, let\u2019s consider some\nof the different styles of leadership you\u2019re likely to come across:\nauthoritarian leadership, servant leadership, and transformational leadership.\n\n  * Authoritarian leadership allows a leader to impose their expectations and define outcomes. This style of leadership works when a leader is the most knowledgeable person on the team or when team members need clear guidelines.\n\n  * Servant leadership involves leaders meeting others\u2019 needs, helping them grow, and providing them with opportunities to be rewarded materially and emotionally. This style of leadership means the leader goes beyond self-interest and serves other people, organizations, and society.\n\n  * Transformational leadership means the leader inspires their followers with a vision and then challenges, encourages, and empowers them to achieve it. The leader also serves as a role model for the vision.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no single right or wrong way to do this. A leader's job is\nto create positive change and these are different styles that help.\n\nAsk yourself, \u201cWhich style is the most effective in creating the change you\nare seeking to achieve?\u201d\n\nYou can arrive at this answer by determining what your team needs, the ideal\nstate of how they should work, and if there is a delta, what is the value of\ngetting to the ideal.\n\nAll of those questions require judgment. If you get what the team needs wrong,\nor how it should work, then it\u2019s not a leadership style problem, but a more\nfundamental problem on either problem-solving or critical reasoning.\n\nWhile authoritarian leadership might sound bad and like it\u2019s something to be\navoided at all costs, the truth is there are some situations when it\u2019s the\nbest option, like at a very early-stage startup when you have a small team\nthat just needs to execute.\n\nThere are several types of leadership styles, which tend to be more or less\neffective depending on a company\u2019s maturity level.\n\nIn contrast, servant leadership sounds cool and I think it\u2019s what a lot of\nindividuals say they want from a leader. However, as I\u2019ve gained more\nexperience, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that servant leadership is not the\nmost strategic style. It depends on the people in your team having a clear\nidea of what success looks like and you doing that to make them successful.\nLarger companies tend to embrace servant leadership and measure a leader\u2019s\nsuccess by the happiness of their team. These companies already have\nestablished processes and optimized their organizations to generate\nsignificant value for the business as long as they have happy contributing\nsmart engineers.\n\nHowever, that isn\u2019t always the case in a pre-IPO hypergrowth company. There is\noften less process, higher ambiguity, and frankly a greater appetite for\nimpact relative to the capacity of the organization. That requires a different\nleadership style.\n\nTransformational leadership means you have a point of view on what the company\nneeds to be successful and you inspire and motivate people against that\nvision. I now believe this is a more suitable style of leadership for me given\nthe types of companies I seek out\u2014fast-growing, pre-IPO companies.\n\nAs I learned more about transformational leadership, I discovered it was the\nright fit for the stage of company and type of team I want to work with.\n\nOne of the reasons I\u2019m now drawn to the transformational leadership style is\nthat I believe I\u2019m here to create a step-function change in someone\u2019s career.\nThat step function change will take them from where they are to where they\nneed to go.\n\nAnother critical piece of this puzzle is your role as a hiring manager. Just\nas I said you need to find the job that\u2019s right for you, you also need to hire\nthe right people for your team. This means finding people who are aligned with\nthe values you hold true for the company, the strengths you will leverage, and\nthe areas they want to grow in. If you find that, in my experience, the\ntransformational leadership style will resonate with people.\n\nTo recap: Being a transformational leader starts with having a vision of where\nyou are heading and what success looks like, followed by what would need to be\ntrue in order to achieve success. Finally, it involves finding the most\nefficient and high-probability path toward that.\n\nTo share an example from my own life, I believe healthcare can be a whole lot\nbetter and there are a lot of inefficiencies and waste in the system, where\npeople, even with the best of intentions, don\u2019t end up achieving the best\nresults (outcomes, preference, cost). For a company to realistically change\nthis you need:\n\n  1. Member trust/preference: If I\u2019m going to change the way people interact with their healthcare, I need their trust.\n\n  2. Knowing what to do (the brain): I need the ability to figure out what is the optimal path for a member given their situation.\n\n  3. Integration and access into healthcare; access to data to best determine course\n\nIf so, then as I'm building the org, determining the technical architecture,\nhiring people, deciding to build vs. buy, defining processes, etc., I am\nalways looking at what gets me closer to that goal, the probability of that\nbeing true, and if there are things I could do to improve the probability of\nsuccess.\n\nAt Included Health, we\u2019ve invested heavily in building consumer-grade\nhealthcare experiences on top of a robust data and AI stack because we believe\nthose will get us there and we\u2019ve hired some amazing people toward that goal.\nWe are also using a lot of open-source and supplementing where it is less\nnecessary.\n\n##\n\nFinal thoughts and takeaways\n\nTo sum up, I\u2019ve shared the importance of being at the right place for you,\nleaning into the challenges, making the \u201cand,\u201d and investing in people.\n\nBeing in the right place for you\u2014is the most important factor. People tend to\nbase their decisions on things like comfort (I know someone who works there),\ncompetence (they use Java, I know Java), or extrinsics (the company will look\ngreat on my resume). Basing your decision on these factors is different from\nchoosing a company based on principles.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve taken a more thoughtful approach to finding the right company for\nyou, it\u2019s much easier to lean into the challenges you\u2019re facing. If you\u2019re\nfocusing on pre-IPO startups, accept that it\u2019s going to be chaotic and messy.\nThat\u2019s what you\u2019re there for. You\u2019re not there to spot problems; you\u2019re there\nto solve them.\n\nMake the \u201cand.\u201d Remember you\u2019re always going to face choices, but they\u2019re\nrarely either/or choices, even if they seem to be at first. Look for the \u201cand\u201d\nchoices and you\u2019ll find the better path.\n\nFinally, invest in people by finding the leadership style that resonates with\nyou. I introduced three styles here and talked a bit about the environments\nwhere they tend to be most successful, but this is your leadership journey, so\nspend some time exploring the topic more and find what works best for you.\n\n###\n\nOpening\n\nI have a passion for my work and for helping people find a work environment\nwhere they can thrive.
