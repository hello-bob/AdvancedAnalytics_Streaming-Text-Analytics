Join Slack channel to discuss join\n#apisix channel! \u2b50\ufe0f\n\n# Full Lifecycle API Management\n\n## API Gateway, Ingress Controller, etc.\n\n### Apache APISIX provides rich traffic management features like Load\nBalancing, Dynamic Upstream, Canary Release, Circuit Breaking, Authentication,\nObservability, etc.\n\nDownloads\n\nView the docs\n\n### Building for large-scale, high value systems\n\nApache APISIX provides open source API Gateway to help you manage\nmicroservices, delivering the ultimate performance, security, and scalable\nplatform for all your APIs and microservices.\n\nApache APISIX is based on NGINX and etcd. Compared with traditional API\nGateways, APISIX has features like dynamic routing and hot-loading plugins,\netc.\n\n## Why APISIX Gateway?\n\n### Reduce time fighting bugs, focus on designing world-class systems with API\nGateway\n\nApache APISIX is the first open-source API Gateway that includes a built-in\nlow-code Dashboard, which offers a powerful and flexible UI for developers to\nuse.\n\n## Easy-to-use Dashboard\n\nThe Apache APISIX Dashboard is designed to make it as easy as possible for\nusers to operate Apache APISIX through a frontend interface. It\u2019s opensource\nand ever evolving, feel free to contribute.\n\nDownloads\n\nView the docs\n\n## User Flexible\n\nThe Apache APISIX dashboard is flexible to User demand, providing option to\ncreate custom modules through code matching your requirements, alongside the\nexisting no-code toolchain.\n\n## Pluginised Workflow\n\nNo need to reinvent the wheel again and again. Use inbuilt plugins to create\nhigh performance systems in tight deadlines. For something custom, there is\noption of building custom plugins.\n\n### Performance\n\n## Ultimate performance\n\nApache APISIX Gateway uses radixtree-route-matching and etcd under the hood to\nprovide you the ability to create high speed synchronized systems. From\nrouting to built-in plugins, all these are designed and implemented to be uber\nperformant with the minimum latency possible.\n\n### Security\n\n## Shield against the malicious\n\nApache APISIX Gateway provides multiple security plugins for identity\nauthentication and API verification, including CORS, JWT, Key Auth, OpenID\nConnect (OIDC), Keycloak, etc. We put stability and security first. For more\ninformation, check here.\n\n### Scalability and availability\n\n## Scales with your users\n\nApache APISIX Gateway provides the ability to write your own custom plugins,\nuse custom Load Balancing Algorithms during the balancer phase for scaling and\ncustom Routing algorithms for fine control on routing.\n\n### Fully dynamic\n\n## Save dev-time, design what matters\n\nAs API Gateway, Apache APISIX provides Hot updates and Hot plugins, which\ncontinuously update configurations without restarts, saving development time\nand stress. In addition, health checks, circuit breakers, and many more\nfeatures keep the system balanced.\n\n### Multi-platform and protocol\n\n## Create once, run anywhere\n\nPlatform agnostic, no vendor lock-in. Apache APISIX as API Management\nsolution, can run from bare-metal to Kubernetes. It supports HTTP to gRPC\ntranscoding, websockets, gRPC, Dubbo, MQTT proxy and multiple platforms\nincluding ARM64, don't worry about the lock-in of the infra technology.\n\n### Among the best, and always improving\n\nApache APISIX Gateway is open source and ever-evolving. Here's a general\ncomparison of APISIX with other API Gateway options, choose your right API\nGateway.\n\nFeature| APISIX| Other API Gateways  \n---|---|---  \nSingle-core CPU, QPS (enable limit-count and prometheus plugins)| 18000| ~1700  \nLatency| 0.2 ms| 2 ms  \nDubbo, MQTT, Tengine and REST API to gRPC transcoding  \nConfiguration rollback  \nCustom Load Balancing and routing  \nPlugin hot loading  \nDashboard  \nSupport any NGINX variable as routing condition  \n  \n### Building API Gateway Together\n\nApache APISIX is open source and ever-growing.
