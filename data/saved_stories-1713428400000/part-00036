It is definitely possible to go smaller than this. My version of the\nOmega trim keeps all four main mounting holes, which makes it around 7mm wider\nthan a classic Omega trim. Additionally Wesk has managed to get a Wii\nmotherboard down to 52x52mm on his final destination trim, which is a a full\n10mm narrower than my trim. I estimate you could reduce the volume by a\nfurther 25-30% without losing any functionality, but it would be an incredibly\ntight fit and tricky to assemble.\n\n## Components\n\nAs the name implies, Short Stack is built from a stack of custom PCBs, and a\ncustom heatsink, that are all designed to fit together in a compact and\nmodular way.\n\n### A modular motherboard\n\nMaking a tiny build like this is made possible by trimming the Wii motherboard\ndown to the bare essentials. The result is a board which is just 62x62mm, but\nstill contains the CPU, GPU, RAM and flash memory.\n\nSince we removed the original power circuitry and trimmed off the USB,\nBluetooth, and GameCube connectors, we need to provide power and data to the\nboard another way. I designed a couple of boards which solder directly to the\nfront of a trimmed Wii motherboard to provide power and data, which help avoid\na tangled mess of wires.\n\nThe Wii Power Strip supplies power to the Wii motherboards using a Molex Pico-\nLock connector, and additionally has footprints to help relocate of a couple\nof capacitors which are typically removed when trimming a Wii.\n\nPeriphlex is a flex PCB which breaks out the Bluetooth, USB and GameCube\ncontroller data lines, as well as the power, shutdown, and reset GPIOs. These\nare then made available via a 14-pin FFC connector. This approach replaces 11\nmagnet wires with a single, removable ribbon cable.\n\nOn the back of the motherboard, I'm using two open-source boards designed by\nthe very talented YveltalGriffin. fujiflex provides digital A/V output using\nGCVideo, and nandFlex relocates the Wii's NAND memory chip, to enable the\ntight trim.\n\n### Custom PCBs\n\nIn addition to the modular boards on the motherboard, I designed two PCBs\nspecific to Short Stack which provide the rest of the functionality for the\nconsole.\n\nThe main board PCB hosts the power regulators, USB to microSD logic, HDMI\nconnector, GameCube ports, and a microcontroller for power management. A\n14-pin ribbon cable connects this board to the Wii motherboard via Periphlex,\nand a power cable delivers power to the Power Strip.\n\nThe front panel PCB hosts the power, reset, and sync buttons, as well as the\npower LED and disc slot LEDs. This board connects to the main board via a\nshort 8-pin ribbon cable.\n\n### Cooling\n\nThe final part of the \"stack\" is a custom heatsink which is designed to be as\nlow profile as possible, while still providing adequate cooling for the Wii's\nCPU and GPU. The heatsink is designed to be machined from aluminum or copper,\nand incorporates mounting holes which align with those on the Wii motherboard.\n\nI managed to find a tiny 5V blower fan (Pelonis AGB208N) which measures just\n20x20x8mm and somehow puts out 0.84 CFM of air. This blows air through the\nheasink fins, out the side of the case.\n\n### Case\n\nThe stack is housed in a custom 3D printed case, secured with four M2.5 screws\nand spacers. The rest of case is assembled using self-tapping M1.2 screws. The\nscrew locations and fan vents are positioned to match the original Wii case as\nclosely as possible, to minimize visible screws.\n\nYou can access files on the SD card by connecting the console to a computer\nvia USB, but I also included an access panel on the front of the case where\nthe original Wii SD card slot is found. This panel is held in place by magnets\nand can be removed to access the SD card without opening the case. Shout out\nto Wesk for the magnet idea!\n\nTo keep the clean aesthetic of the original Wii I wanted to hide the GameCube\ncontroller ports behind a panel. I always hated the hinged design of the\noriginal, and it is quite difficult to replicate at this scale, so I\nredesigned this panel to be a sliding panel.\n\nThe Wii's iconic disc slot lights are recreated using a 1.5mm thick custom cut\nacrylic light diffuser, which is illuminated by two side-mounted addressable\nLEDs on the front panel board. The power, reset, and sync buttons are all also\n3D printed, and the power button hosts a tiny light pipe to allow the power\nLED to shine through.\n\nI FDM printed the case on a Voron 2.4 in ABS using a 0.4mm nozzle at 0.1mm\nlayer height, but it should print fine in PLA or PETG on a well-tuned printer.\nAt this scale, dimensional accuracy is important. In theory it should be\npossible to print this on an SLA printer, but I haven't tried it.\n\n## Build Guide\n\nCaution\n\nThis is not a beginner project! This build requires performing a challenging\nmotherboard trim, fine pitch soldering, and PCB assembly. If you are not\ncomfortable with these tasks, I would recommend starting with a simpler\nproject and working your way up - check out the BitBuilt forums for some\nawesome project worklogs.\n\n### What you'll need\n\n  * 4-layer Wii motherboard\n  * nandFlex board (or 4Layer Technologies RVL-NAND)\n  * Assembled fujiflex (or ElectronAVE)\n  * Assembled Wii Power Strip - must be revision 1!\n  * Assembled Periphlex\n  * Short Stack main board - 1.2mm thickness, stencil recommended\n  * Short Stack front panel - 0.8mm thickness, black soldermask, stencil recommended\n  * Heatsink - machined from aluminum or copper\n  * Light diffuser - cut from 1.5mm thick acrylic\n  * The components and hardware from the bill of materials\n\n### Assembly\n\n  * Assemble main board and front panel PCBs\n\n    * I recommend using a solder stencil and a hot plate or reflow oven\n    * If using a hot plate, hand solder the headphone connectors after reflowing the rest of the components\n    * Secure two 3 x 1mm magnets inside the holes on the front panel board using a dab of CA glue\n  * Flash the main board firmware\n  * Prepare and trim the Wii motherboard\n\n    * Relocate the NAND, test it still boots\n    * Perform a wireless U10 relocation, test it still boots - you may wish to wire a magnet wire to the SHUTDOWN via first\n    * Install fujiflex, and test digital A/V output works\n    * Trim the motherboard (see trim dimensions)\n  * Assemble and install Power Strip (see instructions)\n  * Assemble and install Periphlex (see instructions)\n  * Connect the boards\n\n    * Connect the main board to the motherboard via a 14-pin FFC cable to Periphlex\n    * Connect the main board to the motherboard via a 5-pin Molex Pico-Lock cable to Power Strip\n    * Connect the front panel board to the main board via an 8-pin FFC cable\n    * Connect the fan to the main board\n    * Apply thermal paste to the CPU and GPU\n    * Stack the components: heatsink, motherboard, M2.5 x 3mm spacers, main board\n    * Install the stack to the case bottom using M2.5 x 12mm wafer head screws\n  * Secure the top of the case to the bottom using four M1.2 x 4mm screws\n  * Secure the front panel PCB to the front of the case using two M1.2 x 3mm screws\n  * Secure the front of the case to the bottom of the case using two M1.2 x 4mm screws\n  * Press-fit two 3 x 1mm magnets into the holes on the sd card cover, make sure they match polarity with the magnets on the front panel PCB\n  * Slide the side panel into the case\n\n## License\n\nPermissively released under the Solderpad Hardware License v2.1\n\n## About\n\nWorld's Smallest Nintendo Wii, using a trimmed motherboard and custom stacked\nPCBs\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nView license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n30 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * C 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
