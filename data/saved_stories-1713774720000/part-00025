Below are the various\nrequirements for button cell or coin batteries as well as consumer products\nthat contain or can use such batteries. The requirements range from\nperformance to labeling and certification.\n\n## Products Containing or Designed to Use Button Cell or Coin Batteries \u2013\nReese\u2019s Law Section 2\n\nSection 2 of Reese\u2019s Law requires CPSC to promulgate a rule for button cell or\ncoin batteries and consumer products that contain such batteries. CPSC has\npublished a direct final rule (88 FR 65274) that incorporates by reference\nANSI/UL 4200A-2023 as the mandatory safety standard. The requirements are\ncodified at 16 CFR part 1263 and apply to consumer products that contain\nbutton cell or coin batteries manufactured or imported on or after October 23,\n2023 (unless significant adverse comment is received by October 5, 2023).\nThird party testing and certification of children\u2019s products subject to 16 CFR\npart 1263 is not required until on or after December 20, 2023. The Commission\nrecognizes that there may be limited testing availability and potential\nhardship with meeting the mandatory requirements; therefore, the Commission\nhas granted an enforcement discretion such that these requirements will apply\nto products manufactured or imported after March 19, 2024.\n\nA \u201cbutton cell or coin battery\u201d that is subject to the requirements of 16 CFR\npart 1263 means a single cell battery with a diameter greater than the height\nof the battery. The rule excludes zinc-air button cell or coin batteries from\nthe scope of 16 CFR part 1263.\n\nPer ANSI/UL 4200A-2023, the requirements for consumer products containing or\ndesigned to use button cell or coin batteries are as follows:\n\n  * Battery compartments containing replaceable button cell or coin batteries must be secured such that they require the use of a tool or at least two independent and simultaneous hand movements to open.\n  * Button cell or coin battery compartments must not allow such batteries to be accessed or liberated as a result of use and abuse testing.\n  * The packaging for the overall product must bear a warning.\n  * The product itself must bear a warning, if practicable.\n  * Accompanying instructions and manuals must include all of the applicable warnings.\n\nA read-only copy of ANSI/UL 4200A-2023 is available for free at\nwww.ulstandards.com/IBR/logon.aspx.\n\nBy statute, the rule does not apply to toy products designed, manufactured, or\nmarketed as a plaything for children under 14 years of age if the toy products\nare in compliance with the battery accessibility and labeling requirements of\n16 CFR part 1250, which incorporates by reference ASTM F963. Section 4.25 of\nthe toy standard contains requirements for battery-operated toys.\n\nAlso pursuant to section 2 of Reese\u2019s Law, CPSC published a separate final\nrule (88 FR 65296) to establish warning label requirements for the packaging\nof button cell or coin batteries, including batteries that are packaged\nseparately with a consumer product, per 16 CFR \u00a7 1263.4. This requirement will\napply to products manufactured or imported after September 21, 2024.\nAdditional requirements apply to the packaging of button cell or coin\nbatteries (see below).\n\n## Packaging for Button Cell or Coin Batteries \u2013 Reese\u2019s Law Section 3\n\nSection 3 of Reese\u2019s Law requires \u201cany button cell or coin battery sold,\noffered for sale, manufactured for sale, distributed in commerce, or imported\ninto the United States, or included separately with a consumer product sold,\noffered for sale, manufactured for sale, distributed in commerce, or imported\ninto the United States\u201d to utilize packaging that meets the requirements of 16\nCFR \u00a7 1700.15. This requirement is effective after February 12, 2023.\nTherefore, any subject product manufactured or imported after February 12,\n2023, must meet this packaging requirement. These packaging requirements do\nnot apply to button cell or coin batteries manufactured or imported on or\nbefore February 12, 2023.\n\nOn March 8, 2023, the Commission voted to instruct the Office of Compliance\nand Field Operations to exercise enforcement discretion for the packaging\nrequirements of section 3 for zinc-air button cell or coin batteries\u2014a\ntechnology used to power hearing aids and other hearing assistive\ntechnologies. Pursuant to the exercise of enforcement discretion, at this time\nspecial packaging for zinc-air button cell or coin batteries will not be\nenforced until March 8, 2024. For more information on the enforcement\ndiscretion, see the Commission\u2019s Statement of Policy.\n\nFor more information on the requirements of 16 CFR \u00a7 1700.15 and special\npackaging, visit our Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) business guidance\npage.\n\nBy statute, button cell or coin battery packaging compliant with the marking\nand packaging provisions of ANSI C18.3M is not subject to the special\npackaging requirements in section 3 of Reese\u2019s Law. You can access a read-only\ncopy of the ANSI C18.3M standard here: NEMA IBR Standards Available\n(ansi.org).\n\n## Certification\n\nSection 14(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) requires manufacturers\nof consumer products subject to a regulation, standard, or ban enforced by the\nCPSC to certify that those products meet the requirements of the standard by\nissuing a Children\u2019s Product Certificate (CPC) for children\u2019s products or a\nGeneral Certificate of Compliance (GCC) for general-use products. Certificates\nfor products subject to section 2 of Reese\u2019s Law must include the citation \u201c16\nCFR \u00a7 1263.3 \u2013 Consumer products containing button cell or coin batteries\u201d or\n\u201c16 CFR \u00a7 1263.4 \u2013 Button cell or coin battery package labeling\u201d depending on\nwhich requirements apply. Certificates for products subject to section 3 of\nReese\u2019s Law must include the citation \u201cP.L. 117-171 \u00a7 3(a)\u2013 Button cell or\ncoin battery packaging\u201d.\n\nNote, testing to the special packaging requirements of the PPPA per section 3\nof Reese\u2019s Law is not required to be conducted by a third-party, CPSC-accepted\nlaboratory. As a result, button cell or coin batteries that are packaged\nseparately but included with a children\u2019s product do not need to be tested by\na third-party, CPSC-accepted laboratory. The CPC for such children\u2019s products\nmust still include the citation for section 3 of Reese\u2019s Law (see previous\nparagraph) along with the other applicable children\u2019s product safety rules.\nSections of the CPC related to testing may list multiple pieces of information\nas needed (e.g., multiple dates and place of testing).\n\nFor more information on certification, please visit our CPC business guidance\npage or GCC business guidance page.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n  * Button Cell and Coin Battery FAQs\n  * CPSC Business Education | CPSC Webinar: Breaking Down Reese\u2019s Law \u2013 YouTube & Webinar Slide Deck\n  * Reeses Law Implementation Dates\n\n## Contact\n\nFor more information, please contact the Small Business Ombudsman (SBO) team:\n\n  * SBO contact form\n  * Toll-free: (888) 531-9070\n  * Email: SBO@cpsc.gov\n\nReport an unsafe product\n\nReturn to top\n\nU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission 4330 East-West Highway Bethesda, MD\n20814\n\nContact Us: 800-638-2772 (TTY 800-638-8270) Toll-Free Consumer Hotline | Time: 8 a.m. - 5.30. p.m. ET\n\nConnect\n\nfacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nYoutube\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedin\n\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\n\nfacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWebsite Feedback\n\nCPSC.gov is an official website of the United States government.\n\n#### You are about to leave the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)\npublic website.\n\nThe link you selected is for a destination outside of the Federal Government.\nCPSC does not control this external site or its privacy policy and cannot\nattest to the accuracy of the information it contains.
