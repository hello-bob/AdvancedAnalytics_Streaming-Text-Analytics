News Blog\n\n# Your MySQL 5.7 and PostgreSQL 11 databases will be automatically enrolled\ninto Amazon RDS Extended Support\n\nby Channy Yun | on 21 DEC 2023 | in Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS, AWS Support, Customer Enablement, Database, Launch, MySQL compatible, News, PostgreSQL compatible, RDS for MySQL, RDS for PostgreSQL | Permalink | Comments | Share\n\nToday, we are announcing that your MySQL 5.7 and PostgreSQL 11 database\ninstances running on Amazon Aurora and Amazon Relational Database Service\n(Amazon RDS) will be automatically enrolled into Amazon RDS Extended Support\nstarting on February 29, 2024.\n\nThis will help avoid unplanned downtime and compatibility issues that can\narise with automatically upgrading to a new major version. This provides you\nwith more control over when you want to upgrade the major version of your\ndatabase.\n\nThis automatic enrollment may mean that you will experience higher charges\nwhen RDS Extended Support begins. You can avoid these charges by upgrading\nyour database to a newer DB version before the start of RDS Extended Support.\n\nWhat is Amazon RDS Extended Support? In September 2023, we announced Amazon\nRDS Extended Support, which allows you to continue running your database on a\nmajor engine version past its RDS end of standard support date on Amazon\nAurora or Amazon RDS at an additional cost.\n\nUntil community end of life (EoL), the MySQL and PostgreSQL open source\ncommunities manage common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) identification,\npatch generation, and bug fixes for the respective engines. The communities\nrelease a new minor version every quarter containing these security patches\nand bug fixes until the database major version reaches community end of life.\nAfter the community end of life date, CVE patches or bug fixes are no longer\navailable and the community considers those engines unsupported. For example,\nMySQL 5.7 and PostgreSQL 11 are no longer supported by the communities as of\nOctober and November 2023 respectively. We are grateful to the communities for\ntheir continued support of these major versions and a transparent process and\ntimeline for transitioning to the newest major version.\n\nWith RDS Extended Support, Amazon Aurora and RDS takes on engineering the\ncritical CVE patches and bug fixes for up to three years beyond a major\nversion\u2019s community EoL. For those 3 years, Amazon Aurora and RDS will work to\nidentify CVEs and bugs in the engine, generate patches and release them to you\nas quickly as possible. Under RDS Extended Support, we will continue to offer\nsupport, such that the open source community\u2019s end of support for an engine\u2019s\nmajor version does not leave your applications exposed to critical security\nvulnerabilities or unresolved bugs.\n\nYou might wonder why we are charging for RDS Extended Support rather than\nproviding it as part of the RDS service. It\u2019s because the engineering work for\nmaintaining security and functionality of community EoL engines requires AWS\nto invest developer resources for critical CVE patches and bug fixes. This is\nwhy RDS Extended Support is only charging customers who need the additional\nflexibility to stay on a version past community EoL.\n\nRDS Extended Support may be useful to help you meet your business requirements\nfor your applications if you have particular dependencies on a specific MySQL\nor PostgreSQL major version, such as compatibility with certain plugins or\ncustom features. If you are currently running on-premises database servers or\nself-managed Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, you can\nmigrate to Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-\nCompatible Edition, Amazon RDS for MySQL, Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL beyond the\ncommunity EoL date, and continue to use these versions these versions with RDS\nExtended Support while benefiting from a managed service. If you need to\nmigrate many databases, you can also utilize RDS Extended Support to split\nyour migration into phases, ensuring a smooth transition without overwhelming\nIT resources.\n\nIn 2024, RDS Extended Support will be available for RDS for MySQL major\nversions 5.7 and higher, RDS for PostgreSQL major versions 11 and higher,\nAurora MySQL-compatible version 2 and higher, and Aurora PostgreSQL-compatible\nversion 11 and higher. For a list of all future supported versions, see\nSupported MySQL major versions on Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora major versions\nin the AWS documentation.\n\nCommunity major version| RDS/Aurora version| Community end of life date| End\nof RDS standard support date| Start of RDS Extended Support pricing| End of\nRDS Extended Support  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nMySQL 5.7| RDS for MySQL 5.7| October 2023| February 29, 2024| March 1, 2024|\nFebruary 28, 2027  \nAurora MySQL 2| October 31, 2024| December 1, 2024  \nPostgreSQL 11| RDS for PostgreSQL 11| November 2023| February 29, 2024| April\n1, 2024| March 31, 2027  \nAurora PostgreSQL 11  \n  \nNote: RDS Extended Support for PostgreSQL 11 starts on March 1, 2024, but will\nnot be charged until April 1, 2024. Between March 1 and March 31, all\nPostgreSQL 11 instances on Aurora and RDS are covered under RDS Extended\nSupport. RDS Extended Support for Aurora MySQL 2 starts on November 1, 2024,\nbut will not be charged until December 1, 2024. Between November 1 and\nNovember 30, all Aurora MySQL 2 clusters are covered under RDS Extended\nSupport.\n\nRDS Extended Support is priced per vCPU per hour. Learn more about pricing\ndetails and timelines for RDS Extended Support at Amazon Aurora pricing, RDS\nfor MySQL pricing, and RDS for PostgreSQL pricing. For more information, see\nthe blog posts about Amazon RDS Extended Support for MySQL and PostgreSQL\ndatabases in the AWS Database Blog.\n\nWhy are we automatically enrolling all databases to Amazon RDS Extended\nSupport? We had originally informed you that RDS Extended Support would\nprovide the opt-in APIs and console features in December 2023. In that\nannouncement, we said that if you decided not to opt your database in to RDS\nExtended Support, it would automatically upgrade to a newer engine version\nstarting on March 1, 2024. For example, you would be upgraded from Aurora\nMySQL 2 or RDS for MySQL 5.7 to Aurora MySQL 3 or RDS for MySQL 8.0 and from\nAurora PostgreSQL 11 or RDS for PostgreSQL 11 to Aurora PostgreSQL 15 and RDS\nfor PostgreSQL 15, respectively.\n\nHowever, we heard lots of feedback from customers that these automatic\nupgrades may cause their applications to experience breaking changes and other\nunpredictable behavior between major versions of community DB engines. For\nexample, an unplanned major version upgrade could introduce compatibility\nissues or downtime if applications are not ready for MySQL 8.0 or PostgreSQL\n15.\n\nAutomatic enrollment in RDS Extended Support gives you additional time and\nmore control to organize, plan, and test your database upgrades on your own\ntimeline, providing you flexibility on when to transition to new major\nversions while continuing to receive critical security and bug fixes from AWS.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about increased costs due to automatic enrollment in RDS\nExtended Support, you can avoid RDS Extended Support and associated charges by\nupgrading before the end of RDS standard support.\n\nHow to upgrade your database to avoid RDS Extended Support charges Although\nRDS Extended Support helps you schedule your upgrade on your own timeline,\nsticking with older versions indefinitely means missing out on the best price-\nperformance for your database workload and incurring additional costs from RDS\nExtended Support.\n\nMySQL 8.0 on Aurora MySQL, also known as Aurora MySQL 3, unlocks support for\npopular Aurora features, such as Global Database, Amazon RDS Proxy,\nPerformance Insights, Parallel Query, and Serverless v2 deployments. Upgrading\nto RDS for MySQL 8.0 provides features including up to three times higher\nperformance versus MySQL 5.7, such as Multi-AZ cluster deployments, Optimized\nReads, Optimized Writes, and support for AWS Graviton2 and Graviton3-based\ninstances.\n\nPostgreSQL 15 on Aurora PostgreSQL supports the Aurora I/O Optimized\nconfiguration, Aurora Serverless v2, Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL, pgvector\nextension, Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL (TLE), and AWS\nGraviton3-based instances as well as community enhancements. Upgrading to RDS\nfor PostgreSQL 15 provides features such as Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments,\nRDS Optimized Reads, HypoPG extension, pgvector extension, TLEs for\nPostgreSQL, and AWS Graviton3-based instances.\n\nMajor version upgrades may make database changes that are not backward-\ncompatible with existing applications. You should manually modify your\ndatabase instance to upgrade to the major version. It is strongly recommended\nthat you thoroughly test any major version upgrade on non-production instances\nbefore applying it to production to ensure compatibility with your\napplications. For more information about an in-place upgrade from MySQL 5.7 to\n8.0, see the incompatibilities between the two versions, Aurora MySQL in-place\nmajor version upgrade, and RDS for MySQL upgrades in the AWS documentation.\nFor the in-place upgrade from PostgreSQL 11 to 15, you can use the pg_upgrade\nmethod.\n\nTo minimize downtime during upgrades, we recommend using Fully Managed\nBlue/Green Deployments in Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS. With just a few steps,\nyou can use Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments to create a separate,\nsynchronized, fully managed staging environment that mirrors the production\nenvironment. This involves launching a parallel green environment with upper\nversion replicas of your production databases lower version. After validating\nthe green environment, you can shift traffic over to it. Then, the blue\nenvironment can be decommissioned. To learn more, see Blue/Green Deployments\nfor Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL or Blue/Green Deployments for RDS for\nMySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL in the AWS documentation. In most cases,\nBlue/Green Deployments are the best option to reduce downtime, except for\nlimited cases in Amazon Aurora or Amazon RDS.\n\nFor more information on performing a major version upgrade in each DB engine,\nsee the following guides in the AWS documentation.\n\n  * Upgrading the MySQL DB engine for Amazon RDS\n  * Upgrading the PostgreSQL DB engine for Amazon RDS\n  * Upgrading the Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster\n  * Upgrading Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters\n\nNow available Amazon RDS Extended Support is now available for all customers\nrunning Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS instances using MySQL 5.7, PostgreSQL 11,\nand higher major versions in AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US)\nRegions beyond the end of the standard support date in 2024. You don\u2019t need to\nopt in to RDS Extended Support, and you get the flexibility to upgrade your\ndatabases and continued support for up to 3 years.\n\nLearn more about RDS Extended Support in the Amazon Aurora User Guide and the\nAmazon RDS User Guide.
