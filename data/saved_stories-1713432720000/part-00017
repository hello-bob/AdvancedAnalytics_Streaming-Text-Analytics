That's because a lot of these devices are going to be\nunveiled at an event in May, but if you just can't wait, the leaks are\nstarting to come in.\n\nRelated\n\n##### Snapdragon X: Everything you need to know about Qualcomm's Arm computing\nchips\n\nThe Snapdragon X Elite will finally reach laptops very soon, and here's\neverything you need to know about the X series.\n\nLenovo is going to be one of the earliest companies launching a device with\nQualcomm's newest family of Arm processors, and thanks to to X (formerly\nTwitter) user WalkingCat, we know what one of these laptops looks like. That\nlaptop is the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 14 Snapdragon Edition, and we can see it from\njust about every angle here.\n\n## It's fanless and very thin\n\nThere isn't a ton to glean from the images above, which don't say anything\nabout the specs, aside from the fact it will seemingly have a 14.5-inch\ndisplay. However, the images do reveal some interesting information. For\nstarters, as you'd probably expect, the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 14 Snapdragon\nEdition appears to be completely fanless, as there are no ventilation holes on\nany side of the laptop seen in the images.\n\nSource: WalkingCat (X/Twitter)\n\nWe can also see that the laptop is extremely thin and lacks any ports aside\nfrom three USB Type-C inputs, which are as wide as the laptop itself allows.\nBoth of these are advantages we expect from Arm-based laptops, which run much\ncooler than typical x86-based machines, thus removing the requirement for\nfans, which would otherwise add a lot of bulk.\n\nOtherwise, we see features like a Copilot key on the keyboard, suggesting this\nwill be labeled as an AI laptop, Lenovo's usual \"communications bar\" for the\nwebcam at the top, and some new branding with the Lenovo logo in the center of\nthe lid, rather than in the corner. This design may not be finalized, though.\n\nIt's also interesting to note the wallpaper on this laptop, which is a\ncolorful version of the original Windows 11 Bloom background. The colors here\nare very similar to the Microsoft Copilot logo, though to be fair, those are\nmostly just all the colors you'd see in a typical rainbow effect.\n\n## More premium Arm laptops are coming\n\nOne other thing this leak hints at is the fact that we'll see more premium\nlaptops featuring Qualcomm processors this year. The Lenovo Yoga Slim series\nisn't the company's most prolific lineup, but it's one of the more premium\nmodels, unlike some of the previous Arm-based Lenovo laptops that came from\nthe IdeaPad series. We did have the ThinkPad X13s last year with the\nSnapdragon 8cx Gen 3, but this is the closest we've come to a premium consumer\nlaptop with Windows on Arm.\n\nAnd Lenovo is just one of the players to consider here. Microsoft will be\nlaunching the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 exclusively with Snapdragon\nprocessors, and other brands will also join the fray. It's only a matter of\ntime before we learn more about all these devices. Remember, a big hardware\nevent is planned for May 20, just before Microsoft Build starts.\n\nRelated\n\n##### 3 big changes coming in the Surface Pro 10 and Laptop 6 consumer models\n\nThe real Surface Pro 10 and Laptop 6 will include even more improvements over\nthe business models that are coming in April.
