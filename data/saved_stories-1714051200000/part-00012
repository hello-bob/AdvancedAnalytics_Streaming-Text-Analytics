Capoot@in/ashley-capoot-02496b173/\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg unnerved investors on the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call Wednesday by focusing on its long-term investments in AI and the metaverse.\n  * Shares of Meta tumbled as much as 19% in extended trading Wednesday.\n  * \u201cWe\u2019ve historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * META-74.65 (-15.13%)\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee\nat the Dirksen Senate Office Building on January 31, 2024 in Washington, DC.\n\nAlex Wong | Getty Images\n\nMark Zuckerberg started Meta\u2019s earnings call by talking about artificial\nintelligence. Then he moved onto the metaverse, touting his company\u2019s\nheadsets, glasses and operating system. He spent almost the entirety of his\nopening remarks focused on the many ways Meta loses money.\n\nInvestors weren\u2019t into it. Meta shares tumbled as much as 19% in extended\ntrading on Wednesday, wiping out more than $200 billion in market cap. The\ndrop came despite Meta reporting better-than-expected profit and revenue for\nthe first quarter.\n\nZuckerberg appeared ready for the sell-off.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s worth calling that out, that we\u2019ve historically seen a lot of\nvolatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we\u2019re\ninvesting in scaling a new product but aren\u2019t yet monetizing it,\u201d Zuckerberg\nsaid. He cited past efforts like short-video service Reels, Stories and the\ntransition to mobile.\n\nMeta generates 98% of its revenue from digital advertising. But to the extent\nZuckerberg talked about ads, he was looking to the future and the ways the\ncompany could potentially turn its current investments into ad dollars. In\ndiscussing Meta\u2019s effort to build a \u201cleading AI,\u201d he said, \u201cThere are several\nways to build a massive business here including scaling business messaging,\nintroducing ads or paid content into AI interactions.\u201d\n\nHe spent time talking about Meta Llama 3, the company\u2019s newest large language\nmodel, and the recent rollout of Meta AI, the company\u2019s answer to OpenAI\u2019s\nChatGPT.\n\nZuckerberg then moved onto potential opportunities for expansion within the\nmixed reality headset market, like a headset for work or fitness. Meta opened\nup access to the operating system that powers its Quest headsets on Monday,\nwhich Zuckerberg said will help the mixed reality ecosystem grow faster.\n\nHe also talked up Meta\u2019s AR glasses, which he called \u201cthe ideal device for an\nAI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you\nhear.\u201d\n\nThe Ray-Ban Meta Headliner smart glasses.\n\nJake Piazza | CNBC\n\nIn the meantime, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs unit, which houses the company\u2019s hardware\nand software for development of the nascent metaverse, continues to bleed\ncash. Reality Labs reported sales of $440 million for the first quarter and\n$3.85 billion in losses. The division\u2019s cumulative losses since the end of\n2020 have topped $45 billion.\n\nZuckerberg has bought himself some time.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock price almost tripled last year and, as of Wednesday\u2019s close, was\nup 40% in 2024. It reached a record $527.34 in early April.\n\nAfter a brutal 2022, during which the company lost about two-thirds of its\nvalue, Zuckerberg appears to have regained the confidence of Wall Street.\n\nThe driver for the rally has been a cost-cutting plan that the Meta CEO put in\nplace early last year, when he told investors that 2023 would be the \u201cyear of\nefficiency.\u201d The company slashed headcount and eliminated unnecessary projects\nin an effort to become a \u201cstronger and more nimble organization.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg said Wednesday that Meta will continue to operate efficiently, but\nthat shifting existing resources to investments in AI will \u201cgrow our\ninvestment envelope meaningfully.\u201d\n\nCapital expenditures for 2024 are anticipated to be in the $35 billion to $40\nbillion range, an increase from a prior forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion\n\u201cas we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our\nartificial intelligence (AI) roadmap,\u201d Meta said.\n\nZuckerberg said he expects to see a \u201cmultiyear investment cycle\u201d before Meta\u2019s\nAI products will scale into profitable services, but noted that the company\nhas a \u201cstrong track record\u201d in that department.\n\nMeta finance chief Susan Li echoed Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks, saying the company\nneeds to develop advanced models and scale products before they will drive\nmeaningful revenue.\n\n\u201cWhile there is tremendous long-term potential, we\u2019re just much earlier on the\nreturn curve,\u201d Li said.\n\nEven before the call began, investors were trimming their holdings. That\u2019s\nbecause Meta issued a light revenue forecast for the second quarter,\novershadowing the first-quarter beat.\n\nAs the stock plunge intensified, Zuckerberg told investors that if they\u2019re\nwilling to come along for the ride, they may well be rewarded.\n\n\u201cHistorically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has\nbeen a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who stuck with\nus and the initial signs are quite positive here too,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut\nbuilding a leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other\nexperiences we\u2019ve added to our apps and this is likely going to take several\nyears.\u201d\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Here are Wednesday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Tesla, Amazon, Airbnb, Domino\u2019s, Walmart, Disney & more\n  * Forget Nvidia: Morgan Stanley says Intel\u2019s much-hyped AI chip will boost 3 global stocks\n  * Analysts love this gold explorer\u2019s stock \u2014 and even the most cautious expect it to soar 114%\n  * Bank of America upgrades Tesla, says first-quarter report opens door for strong gains ahead\n  * This biotech stock specializing in targeted cancer treatments can surge 50%, Jefferies says\n  * Here\u2019s where to invest $1 million right now, according to the pros\n\nWATCH: AI not yet the \u2018lift\u2019 for Meta that Wall Street was expecting\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO4:5504:55\n\nAI not yet the \u2018lift\u2019 for Meta that the Street was expecting, says Deepwater\u2019s\nGene Munster\n\nFast Money\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
