This\npost is about how the piece was done, so it might be useful to read the story\nbefore you read this.\n\nI\u2019m often asked how long a project takes and what that process looks like. I\nusually give a vague answer like, \u201cProbably a total of four weeks, spread\nacross several months.\u201d But I always knew that was a bullshit answer, because\ntime is actually a really bad measure for what it takes to finish a project.\n\nBig Charts is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support\nmy work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSo this time, I kept a diary of what I did every single day I worked on this\nproject.\n\n####\n\nFall 2023: Inspiration\n\nA few years ago, I started teaching full-time at the New School after being an\nadjunct for many years. As I spent more time on campus, I witnessed small life\nevents derailing students\u2019 lives.\n\nTeaching a workshop on how to make a portfolio site.\n\nIt often started with something as small as getting sick and missing a few\nclasses. That quickly snowballed into losing a job, getting overwhelmed with\nschool work, or experiencing a mental health crisis. For some, that meant\ndropping out of school, which meant they had loads of debt without a degree.\nWhile their classmates graduated and worked fulfilling jobs, their lives\nstalled as they figured out their place in the world.\n\nSo I decide to start thinking about this question as a data journalist.\n\n####\n\nWinter 2023: Getting to know the data\n\nI\u2019ve committed to working with the Pudding on a more regular basis. My start\ndate is January 1, so I do some data exploration to get prepared for my next\nPudding story.\n\nI\u2019ve long known about the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. It\u2019s a survey\nthat follow people throughout their life, starting from their teenage years.\nThere is a lot of data here \u2013 questions about family, school, work, life,\nhealth, relationships, and more. Most importantly, this data let\u2019s me track\npeople\u2019s experiences and outcomes over time.\n\nThere is one cohort of people that this survey started following in 1979, so\nthat group is now in their 50s. And there\u2019s another cohort that the survey\nstarted following in 1997, and that group is now in their late-30s. I chose\nthe latter, since their experiences reflect the current reality much more\nclosely.\n\nLongitudinal data can be pretty intimidating to work with. The Bureau of Labor\nStatistics actually has a portal that lets you create a subset of the data and\ndownload it. But there\u2019s a learning curve \u2013 and I\u2019m saying that as someone who\nworks with data all the time. That said, once you understand how to access and\nunderstand the data, it yield an incredible amount of information.\n\n####\n\nJanuary 2: Data download\n\nI learn how to use the data download portal, read up on the documentation, and\nload the data into a Jupyter notebook so I can analyze the data in Pandas.\n\n####\n\nJanuary 3: Data analysis\n\nI write two scripts to analyze the data. One of them let\u2019s me see one person\nat a time, just so I get a feel for what one datapoint looks like. The other\nanalyzes the full dataset so I can see what\u2019s happening with the full cohort.\n\nI can see college students getting derailed in the data, but I\u2019m enamored with\nthe data on childhood variables \u2013 like parenting style, family/home\nenvironments, first dates, attitudes on school, SAT scores, whether they were\nbullied, and more. So I\u2019m exploring the possibility of a pivot.\n\n####\n\nJanuary 4: Visualization sketches\n\nI have an idea of how I want to visualize this data. When I teach data\njournalism, I have students stand up and group themselves by various traits \u2013\nmaybe it\u2019s their age, where they\u2019re from, or their favorite music genre. From\nthere, I have them calculate something within their groups \u2013 average number of\nsteps taken each day, average number of books read this year, average number\nof Instagram followers. It turns the students into datapoints, so they can\nexperience data analysis with their bodies, rather than in a spreadsheet.\n\nWith that in mind, my initial plan is to visualize the data with people\nrunning around the screen and grouping themselves:\n\n####\n\nJanuary 5-18: Setting up the interactive\n\nOver the next few days, I start setting up the interactive code. I connect the\ndata to the app and set up a scrolly interface.\n\nI decide that, in order to have these people run around the screen in the way\nI want, I\u2019m going to use P5.js. This is a library that is basically the\nJavascript version of a programming language called Processing. It\u2019s a coding\nlanguage geared toward visual artists, and it has a special place in my heart\nbecause I learned Processing during grad school at NYU ITP. Thanks to\nProfessor Dan Shiffman (who has an amazing YouTube channel, Coding Train), I\nlearned how to code a crude physics engine to have my people icons run across\nthe screen exactly how I want them to. If you\u2019re interested in learning, read\nthis.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m still playing with the data. I\u2019m realizing at this stage that I\nwant to see the data visualized, rather than just seeing it analyzed in\nPandas. But how should these people be grouped? Well, my initial thought is\nthat they should be grouped based on whether they are in high school, college,\nor working.\n\nBelow are some working sketches. Notably, they aren\u2019t wireframes. They are\njust me thinking through some ideas on paper.\n\nYou can see some of these ideas were kept in the final story.\n\n####\n\nJanuary 19: Exploring data with visuals\n\nI\u2019m still playing around with data in my Jupyter notebook. But I also want to\nsee what I can see in the data.\n\nRight now I\u2019m having rectangle fly around the screen and group themselves. I\u2019m\ncoloring them in by what I\u2019m calling a \u201cderailment index.\" But the conclusion\nis that I can\u2019t see anything in the data with this current design.\n\nSoon I will property organize the people on the screen so I can see what\u2019s\nhappening.\n\n####\n\nJanuary 23: Honing the visual structure\n\nI think this reorganization worked!\n\n####\n\nJanuary 24: Honing the physics\n\nOne big issue was that, when the rectangle fly around the screen, they don\u2019t\nsmoothly arrive at the intended destination. Instead it flies past it. So I\nfixed that code, and now the animation looks good.\n\n####\n\nJanuary 25: The desert. Ugh.\n\nDuring every big project, I experience what I call \u201cThe Desert.\u201d It\u2019s when I\nquestions everything about my project, my abilities, and my career path. It\u2019s\nwhen I can\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel. Everything feels broken.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t feel good.\n\nBut I\u2019ve done this enough times to know that The Desert is a normal part of\nthe process.\n\nJohn Wick made it through the desert. You can, too.\n\nToday is the start of The Desert.\n\nI woke up this morning feeling a bit uneasy about this story... because I\ndon\u2019t actually have a clear story here. So I spend the day fleshing out the\nstory, and I think I have a new idea.\n\nIt\u2019s called \u201cThe Great Equalizer\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s about how the education system\nactually exacerbates inequality. It\u2019s a common theme in my work, so perhaps\nthis is playing it safe.\n\nAnyway, the idea is to have two groupings of icons: people in school and\npeople in the workforce.\n\n  * Part 1: Let the reader scroll through 20-some years and see people on the screen getting more and more education, and sort them by educational attainment. When they go into the workforce, sort them by income or happiness or health.\n\n  * Part 2: Go back in time. Let the reader scroll through again. But this time, color it in by something else out of the kid\u2019s control \u2013 maybe parental education level? Or family wealth?\n\nStill not sure how I feel about this.\n\n####\n\nJanuary 29: Still walking through The Desert\n\nThere is a lot of data.\n\nThere are 9,000 people in the data. Each person is tracked for 24 years. And\neach year, I grabbed hundreds of datapoints.\n\nSo I spend the day getting my head around how to organize the data. I\neventually decide that, for each person, my data structure will be something\nlike this:\n\n    \n    \n    [ // 1997 [0, 8.0, 0, 500.0, 14.0, 61.0, 85.0, -1, -1, -1, 0.0, 1.0, -1, -1, 1.7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.0, 0, -1, 27006.0, 1.0, 1, 1], // 1998 [0, 9.0, 0, 500.0, 15.0, 67.0, 112.0, -1, -1, -1, 0.0, 2.0, -1, -1, 170.0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.0, 0, -1, -4.0, 2.0, 1, 1], ... ]\n\nOnce I get my head around the data, it isn\u2019t bad at all.\n\n####\n\nJanuary 30: In the middle of The Desert\n\nI still feel a bit uncertain. I think I know what the story is. I think I know\nwhat the video is. (Oh, right, did I tell you I\u2019m making a video, too?) But...\nsometimes it's tough to tell until you put it on the screen. I suppose I have\nfaith it will work out. I have an exciting plan. But it doesn't feel like I'm\nrefining yet. It feels like I'm still conceptualizing. I feel like I\u2019m in the\ndesert.\n\nBy the end of the day, I have something that looks like this:\n\nThe colors show the highest educational attainment.\n\nI\u2019m able to see the data more clearly. Still don\u2019t know if I have a good\nstory.\n\n####\n\nFebruary 1: Figuring out the visual structure\n\nI have a three-column layout working. The first column is high school, the\nsecond is college, the third is work, and at the bottom are the \u201cleftovers\u201d \u2013\nthe people who aren\u2019t engaged in any of the above.\n\nA little more tweaking:\n\n####\n\nFebruary 2: Cleaning up visuals, avoiding the big problems\n\nI feel good about where I am! Am I out of The Desert? (Spoiler alert: I was\nnot.)\n\n####\n\nFebruary 3: Figuring out technical things, still ignoring the story\n\nI wanted to test out sprites in P5.js. So I used a sample from here. It works!\n\nI used this sample code (also from Dan Shiffman) to get me started. This\nhelped me figure out what kind of sprites I needed to animate the people\nsmoothly.\n\n####\n\nFebruary 5 to 9: Figuring out design, still ignoring story\n\nI come up with a color palette:\n\nI make a list of all the sprite I need to make.\n\n  * [yellow, orange, red, lightpurple, purple, darkpurple, blackpurple, no data]\n\n  * [male, female]\n\n    * [running left, running up, running down, standing]\n\nI draw all these sprites in Aseprite. I spend a lot of time making these.\n\nMy first attempt is terrible.\n\nNotably I also teach two of these days, so I\u2019m a bit tired from doing work\nconstantly. But... it pays off! Here\u2019s one of the sprite sheets:\n\nHere are the sprites on the page:\n\n####\n\nFebruary 12 to 19: Figuring out UI + tech, ignoring story... still\n\nI want to clean up the interface as much as possible. Normally this would be\nannoying, but given that this is the only easy thing left in the project, it\u2019s\na bit relaxing to clean up code, clean up design, and write some code to\nautomate several parts of the project.\n\nOne thing I automate is the ability to add new variables to the data.\n\nThis determines how each variable is used and how it\u2019s visualized.\n\nAnother thing I add is the ability to use the Google Doc to drive the entire\nstory. What that means is that, when I work on the story, I can work entirely\nin Google Docs and not at all in the code. Being able to just focus on story \u2013\nand not code is huge. (It uses ArchieML to parse this into a Javascript array\nof objects.)\n\nThis determines which year of data is shown, how the people icons are colored,\nhow the people icons are sorted, what is shown in the interface, what kind of\ntext card is shown in the scrolly \u2013 and, finally, the actual content.\n\nI also realize that I need to go back and get some more data from the National\nLongitudinal Survey of Youth. I missed some columns about home/family\nenvironment risk and mental health. So I begrudgingly go back and get that\ndata.\n\n####\n\nEnd of February: Time to get out of The Desert\n\nI decide I need to do the thing I\u2019ve been putting off: Figure out the damn\nstory. I\u2019ve done this before, so it isn\u2019t too daunting.\n\n  * I read a bunch of research on everything from emerging adulthood to derailment to resilience.\n\n  * I go back to my data to see if any of these themes are apparent.\n\n  * When I see some themes, see if it\u2019s visible in the data. (Sometimes it\u2019s easy to see something in the data but hard to see it in the visualization.)\n\nGoing through this process helps me realize something: What I see in the data\nis that derailment \u2013 and getting \u201cleft behind\u201d \u2013 is real. But what\u2019s more\napparent is how kids get left behind much earlier in life, based on\ncircumstances out of their control.\n\nAbout a decade ago, I helped my colleague, Arielle Levin Becker, with a story\non the long reach of childhood trauma while working at the Connecticut Mirror.\n(Sorry the page is somewhat broken; that\u2019s my fault.) First of all, it\u2019s an\nincredible story. Secondly, it helps me realize that the big story in my data\nis how childhood and teenage experiences play a huge part in shaping our adult\nlives. I\u2019d read a lot of literature on these stressors and traumas \u2013 Adverse\nChildhood Experiences \u2013 but didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what I was looking at in the\ndata.\n\nIt was devastating to see kids growing up in difficult environments. They were\nmostly optimistic about the future, which told me that they assumed they\u2019d\neventually have the agency to better their lives. But the research showed that\nour adult outcomes are largely shaped by our childhood experiences.\n\nThen, when they turn 18, we punish them if they\u2019re poor, hungry, unhealthy,\nuneducated, etc.\n\n####\n\nMarch 1 to 7: Refocusing the story\n\nI have a new idea. The start begins with something like: \u201cOnce upon a time,\nthere was an optimistic kids...\u201d\n\nI\u2019m attached to the idea that most of these kids are optimistic, but their\nlives don\u2019t quite turn out the way they\u2019d hoped.\n\nI write through a new version of the story.\n\n####\n\nMarch 11: A good editor tells me it\u2019s confusing\n\nMy partner, Amanda, is a great editor. So I have her take a look, and she\ngives me some honest feedback on things that don\u2019t work. The summary is: A lot\nof this story is confusing, and there\u2019s way too much happening.\n\n####\n\nMarch 12: Further focusing the story\n\nMy takeaway from the feedback is that I need one clear and concise point, and\nI need each part of the story to reiterate that point. So what is the point?\n\nHere\u2019s what I come up with: These are teenagers, and we've created a world\nwhere it's their fault for failing when they grow up. But the evidence shows\nthat their futures are shaped by the environment we put them in when they're\nkids.\n\nI rewrite the story.\n\n####\n\nMarch 13 to 15: Feedback from the Pudding team\n\nThe Pudding team gives me feedback. Like I mentioned for my previous piece,\nthey give great feedback.\n\nI clean up a bunch of UI issues. I clean up a bunch of accessibility issues. I\nclean up a bunch of code.\n\n####\n\nMarch 16: Debugging and cleaning up\n\nI clean up a bunch of mobile issues.\n\nI clean up a bunch of small bugs.\n\nI have a final version that looks pretty good.\n\n####\n\nMarch 17: Adding a last-minute feature\n\nI decide it\u2019s a good idea to allow the user to click on each person to see\ndetails. I spend my Sunday morning building out this feature.\n\n####\n\nMarch 18 to 31: Scripting the video and prepping the video animations\n\nI start working on the video. I\u2019ve already been thinking about it, so this\nisn\u2019t a huge lift.\n\nI first write through a script. (I worked on the Vox video team, so I just\ndefaulted to the process we used there. I have some ideas of how I want to\nchange my process for next time... but more on that next time.)\n\nWhat I\u2019m especially excited about is a version of the interactive that\ngenerates out huge portions of the video. It\u2019s essentially an app that runs\nthrough a script, with my preferred timings. I also have an interface that\nlets me override the script.\n\n####\n\nApril 1 to 8: Motion graphics and video editing hell\n\nI track the voiceover. I spend time in motion graphics hell, aka After\nEffects. And I edit the video together in Premiere. I source music, sound\neffects, and some stock footage. (This is notably harder outside of a big\nnewsroom.)\n\nI was super busy, so I didn\u2019t do a great job documenting this.\n\n####\n\nApril 9: Publication\n\nPublication date.\n\nThe video was the last thing out the door. I need to figure out a better\nprocess for producing an interactive piece and a video piece at the same time.\n\n####\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe piece published this morning. I have no idea whether it\u2019s good. This is\nhow I usually feel about my pieces.\n\nAs for how long this took: It was at least two days a week for about three\nmonths.\n\nWhen I think back on the last few months, I think this process had more twists\nand turns than most projects because I didn\u2019t want to confront that I didn\u2019t\nhave a clear story. This is partially because I started with one focus and\npivoted halfway through. But it\u2019s also because there were parts of this\nproject that were technically difficult or time-consuming, and I was more\nworried about those things than actually figuring out the story. It\u2019s\nsomething I tell warn my students about constantly. But I didn\u2019t heed my own\nadvice.\n\nThat said, I try not to be too prescription about \u201cprocess.\u201d We all have\ndifferent ways of working and, more importantly, different ways of thinking\nthrough our ideas. Over time, we go through bumps, we hear from smart people,\nand we refine and improve our process.\n\nThanks for reading and subscribing.
