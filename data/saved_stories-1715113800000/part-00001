Credit: Karl Berg\n\nInfanticide and adoption in the animal kingdom have long puzzled scientists.\nWhile both males and females of many species are known to kill the babies of\ntheir rivals to secure sexual or social advantage, other animals have been\nobserved caring for the young of dead or missing comrades.\n\nA team of University of California, Berkeley-led biologists has discovered\nthat both these extreme behaviors are surprisingly common among green-rumped\nparrotlets, a small South American parrot. In a new study in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers present\nnearly 30 years of observations revealing what drives the parrotlets to either\ncare for\u2014or kill\u2014one another's babies.\n\n\"In parrotlets, infanticide and adoption revolve around real estate and love,\"\nsaid study author Steven Beissinger, a professor of environmental science,\npolicy and management at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Most of the\ninfanticide attacks happened when a breeding pair was attacked by another pair\nthat was trying to take over a coveted nest site. It also occurred when males\nwanted to breed with a widow who already had offspring\u2014but we were surprised\nto find that these new males were just as likely to adopt the offspring as\nattack them.\"\n\nSince 1988, Beissinger has led a team of biologists observing a community of\ngreen-rumped parrotlets residing on a cattle ranch in Gu\u00e1rico, Venezuela.\nWhile most wild parrots live in the forest canopy\u2014making them very difficult\nto track and study\u2014green-rumped parrotlets prefer to nest in hollowed-out\ntrees and fence posts in grasslands. To observe the family dynamics of these\nbirds, Beissinger crafted artificial nesting sites out of large PVC pipes and\ninstalled them throughout the ranch. He also began color-banding the\nparrotlets to track individuals and their relationships.\n\nAn artificial nesting site, constructed from a large PVC pipe, at Hato\nMasaguaral Biological Station in Gu\u00e1rico, Venezuela. Credit: Karl Berg\n\nEarly in the study, Beissinger and his former graduate student Scott Stoleson\nwere surprised to find dead babies in a nest, with no clear indication of what\nhad killed them.\n\n\"We couldn't tell if something had attacked them, or if they had died from\ndisease, or something else,\" Beissinger said. \"But when we were watching some\nof the nests, all of a sudden in went a male who didn't belong\u2014who wasn't a\nparent at that nest\u2014and out he came with a little bit of blood on his beak.\"\n\nThe sight gave Beissinger the first clue that infanticide might be happening\namong the parrotlets, and he began tracking instances of the behavior. The\nstudy includes observations of more than 2,700 nests between 1988 and 2015.\n\nWhile infanticide in mammals and birds is still poorly understood, it often\nappears to be motivated by sexual selection, or the drive to reproduce. For\ninstance, a male may kill the offspring of a widowed female so that he can\nmate with her more quickly.\n\nA male and female green-rumped parrotlet inside their nesting box. Credit:\nKarl Berg\n\nHowever, among parrotlets, competition over nesting sites appears to be the\nprimary motivation for attacks. Parrotlets killed or wounded nestlings and\neggs at 256 of the nests that the biologists monitored. In most cases, the\nattacks were carried out by a single parrotlet or a breeding pair that later\nclaimed the nesting site for themselves.\n\nThese attacks occurred more often when the parrotlet population was high and\ncompetition for good nesting sites was fierce.\n\n\"At low population levels, it's all love and peace, right? But then when you\nget to high population densities, it's a bloodbath,\" said study co-author Karl\nBerg, an associate professor in the School of Integrative Biological and\nChemical Sciences at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Brownsville\nwho has worked with Beissinger on the project for more than 20 years.\n\nTwo nestlings poke their heads out of a natural nest cavity shortly after the\ndeath of their father.

When the resources provided by the environment aren't enough for all\nindividuals to breed, they seek out alternative strategies. Unfortunately,\nthat involves killing innocent little offspring.\"\n\nInfanticide also occurred in nests where one parent had died and the surviving\nparent had found a new mate. However, these new mates were just as likely to\nadopt the unrelated offspring as kill them\u2014and choosing to become a stepparent\nultimately did not hurt the parrotlet's reproductive success.\n\n\"Adoption may be a lot easier to accept than infanticide, but it's actually\nmore difficult to understand because it challenges Darwin's ideas about\nnatural selection,\" Berg said. \"It was very interesting to see that the\nreproductive fitness outcomes were about even between adoption and infanticide\nand suggests that they have an alternative strategy\u2014adoption may be a non-\nviolent means of getting genes into the next generation.\"\n\nThe study also found that males who adopted unrelated offspring went on to\nnest with widowed females and started breeding at younger ages than their\ncompetitors.\n\n\"Stepfathers scored love, a new mate; and real estate, a nest site,\" said\nBeissinger.\n\nMore information: Steven R.
