The FTC \"has determined that it is\nan unfair method of competition, and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the\nFTC Act, for employers to enter into noncompetes with workers and to enforce\ncertain noncompetes.\"\n\nYou can safely assume there will be lots of litigation over this new rule. And\nI wouldn't hold my breath that the Supreme Court in its current makeup will\nuphold it. Meanwhile, until a court says otherwise, the rule is in place. What\ndoes it mean?\n\nEffective date: The rule isn't effective until 120 days after publication in\nthe Federal Register, so presumably that will be from yesterday. That means\nthe rule will be in effect on August 21, 2024.\n\nExisting noncompetes: Most of them are now deemed illegal and unenforceable,\nexcept those involving \"senior executives,\" defined as those earning more than\n$151,164 who are in a \u201cpolicy-making position\u201d. But most noncompetes are\nillegal anyhow, with or without the rule, in my opinion. There are many\ndefenses to noncompetes that exist even if this rule is tossed, and that can\nhelp people who are waiting for the effective date.\n\nFuture noncompetes: Most will be illegal except those for business purchases.\n\nNoncompete clause defined: \"Non-compete clause means: (1) A term or condition\nof employment that prohibits a worker from, penalizes a worker for, or\nfunctions to prevent a worker from: (i) seeking or accepting work in the\nUnited States with a different person where such work would begin after the\nconclusion of the employment that includes the term or condition; or (ii)\noperating a business in the United States after the conclusion of the\nemployment that includes the term or condition. (2) For the purposes of this\npart 910, term or condition of employment includes, but is not limited to, a\ncontractual term or workplace policy, whether written or oral.\"\n\nNonsolicitation agreements: These are provisions saying you can't solicit\nemployees or clients of the company for 1 - 2 years or so. They aren't\nspecifically banned. However, many will be banned in my opinion. The FTC says\nthis:\n\n> Non-solicitation agreements are generally not non-compete clauses under the\n> final rule because, while they restrict who a worker may contact after they\n> leave their job, they do not by their terms or necessarily in their effect\n> prevent a worker from seeking or accepting other work or starting a\n> business. However, non-solicitation agreements can satisfy the definition of\n> non-compete clause in \u00a7 910.1 where they function to prevent a worker from\n> seeking or accepting other work or starting a business after their\n> employment ends. Whether a non-solicitation agreement\u2014or a no-hire agreement\n> or a no-business agreement, both of which were referenced by commenters, as\n> discussed previously\u2014meets this threshold is a fact-specific inquiry.\n\nWeasel words: \u201cIt is not an unfair method of competition to enforce or attempt\nto enforce a non-compete clause or to make representations about a noncompete\nclause where a person has a good-faith basis to believe that this part 910 is\ninapplicable.\u201d Not particularly helpful to give a weaselly way out. But the\nCourt or FTC would have to determine that there was a good faith basis to\nbelieve that it fell within an exception or that the rule had been stayed by a\ncourt.\n\nNotice required: Employers will have to send notices to everyone they have\nnoncompetes with to advise them that the noncompete clause won't be enforced.\nIt has to be hand-delivered or emailed/mailed.\n\nExisting causes of action: If you're sued for a noncompete or breached one\nbefore the effective date, the new rule doesn't apply. However, the FTC did a\nvery nice brief on why these things shouldn't be enforced, and you should be\nable to use some of their analysis to argue issues like lack of a legitimate\ninterest other than preventing competition, lack of good faith, and some other\ndefenses.\n\nHow will this play out? I think the rule will be stayed by a red-friendly\ncourt and will be litigated. So it's unlikely it will actually go into effect\nthis year, if at all.\n\nBut let's say employers send out those notices and then the rule is stayed or\nreversed? What will happen then? Can they say never mind? Or is the noncompete\nvoid? Will employers who send the notices have to get new ones signed? I would\nthink that they would be difficult to enforce after the notice goes out.\n\nOne thing is for sure - employment lawyers will be plenty busy for awhile\nafter this.\n\nNoncompete law is very state-specific until this rule goes into effect, so if\nyou have a noncompete agreement, talk to an employee-side employment lawyer in\nyour state if you want to understand your rights and responsibilities.\n\nPosted by Donna Ballman at\n\n6:28 PM\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\nLabels: noncompete agreements\n\n#### No comments:\n\n#### Post a Comment\n\nI appreciate your comments and general questions but this isn't the place to\nask confidential legal questions.
