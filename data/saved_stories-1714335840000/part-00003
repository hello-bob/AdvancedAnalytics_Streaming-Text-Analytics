Configuration is either\nunnecessary or simple.\n\nThat takes care of the \"configuration\" problem, but in order to use LazyVim\neffectively, you must first know how to use LazyVim.\n\nThis course was written for developers who want to ramp up on modal editing\nwith Neovim. It is approachable and digestible, but most of all, it is\ncomprehensive. It collects tips and tricks gained from over two decades of\nusing Vim, and is written with the gentle humour Dusty Phillips brings to all\nhis work.\n\n## About the Author\n\nDusty Phillips is a software developer and author. His most popular book,\nPython Object Oriented Programming is now in its 4th edition, though Dusty is\nno longer a fan of OOP!\n\nDusty began coding in QBasic, Visual Basic, and Java as a teenager, but\nsettled on a career in Python long before it became popular. He was the first\nperson to write a book on Python 3 and was part of the team instrumental in\nbringing Python 3 to Instagram and Facebook. More recently, he enjoys\nexperimenting with esoteric programming languages, many articles on which can\nbe found on his blog.\n\nDusty has worked for a wide variety of companies, from two person startups to\nthe world's largest social network (and the world's largest government), and\ncompanies of all sizes in between.\n\nDusty lives with his wife and 75 acres of trees in New Brunswick, Canada. The\ntwo of hthem recently co-founded Fablehenge, a platform for novelists to\norganize and write their stories.\n\n## Support\n\nDusty welcomes your support on Patreon or GitHub. There is a textbook's worth\nof content here, but please value it as you see fit.\n\n## Release Cadence\n\nI will be releasing chapters as they are edited, targeting a new chapter every\nweek or two. Early drafts will be posted to my Patreon account at least two\nweeks before the edited versions are made public.\n\nStart Reading\n\n\u00a9 2024 Dusty Phillips\n\n", "frontpage": true}
