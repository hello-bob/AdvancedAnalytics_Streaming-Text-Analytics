I think the degree of targeting to specific users actively interested\nin buying the product is more focused w/ this versus other marketing methods\"\n\nTim Johnson consum.io\n\n\"Just kicked the tires on this a bit and I was super impressed. The subtly\ncrafted message that ReplyGuy whipped up was the perfect acknowledgement of\nthe features and benefits that were raised in the initial post along with a\nstealthy introduction of an alternative brand option with out the slightest\nwhiff of spam! Amazing\"\n\nTerrence Kelleman mightywallet.shop\n\n\"This was such a nice find. It uses AI to reply on Twitter and Reddit based on\na context you give and some keywords to scrape relevant posts.

You can try ReplyGuy for free and see the magic for yourself.\n\n#### What platforms do you support?\n\nWe currently support Twitter (X) and Reddit. We are currently adding support\nfor LinkedIn, Tik Tok, Hacker News, and other social networks.\n\n#### Do you mention the product name or the full URL?\n\nWe highly recommend only mentioning the brand name of your product since\nmentioning links in posts makes the post more likely to be reported as spam\nand hidden. We find that humans don't usually type out full URLs in natural\nconversation and plus, most internet users are happy to do a quick Google\nSearch.\n\n#### Can I cancel my subscription anytime?\n\nYes! You can cancel/pause/upgrade/downgrade your subscription anytime from the\ndashboard.\n\n#### What accounts send the replies?\n\nWe send the replies from our pool of high quality Twitter and Reddit accounts.\nYou may optionally connect your own account if you'd like the replies to come\nfrom a brand page.\n\n#### How long does it take to start seeing results?\n\nWithin 1-2 weeks, many customers report an uptick in users coming from the\nreplies.
