Or, you could support my work by buying a\ncopy of my new book, FLUKE: Chance, Chaos, and Why Everything We Do Matters.\n\nThis is a story about the hubris of data analytics; about the perils of\ntreating Calvinball problems as though they are Moneyball problems; and how\nmodern attempts to control our world have fundamentally misunderstood the\nnature of the complex systems that govern our lives.\n\nIt\u2019s also a story of cultural sludge, convergence toward boring averages, and\nthe catastrophic consequences that occur when you treat mysteries as though\nthey are puzzles. In short, this is the story of how and why we misunderstand\nmodern society in the age of Big Data\u2014and how we can learn to be smarter.\n\n###\n\nI: Moneyball and the Wizardry of Analytics\n\nWhen I was a kid, I learned to read partly by perusing the Minnesota Twins\u2019\nbaseball box scores\u2014the original mechanism for quantifying sports and\ntranslating on-field performances into numbers that could be analyzed and\ncompared. It was a crude method, capturing hits, runs, and averages for\nindividual ballplayers.\n\nBut crucially, box scores focused on individuals, not systems. You could read\na box score and figure out how a player was doing, but not understand what\nmade a winning team. For more than a century, baseball\u2014like most\nsports\u2014remained stuck in this primitive form of atomized analysis.\n\nWith only crude stats as a guide, players were drafted based on hunches.\nCoaches followed folk superstitions. Front offices poured most of their budget\ninto big name stars to please fans, even though the result often was just a\nhighly paid All Star on a losing team. For the baseball gurus, numbers could\nnever replace fundamentals and intangibles, the good or bad feeling a scout\ngot when they watched a prospective player up close.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Earnshaw Cook, a professor at Johns Hopkins, and Bill\nJames, a security guard at a bean canning plant, began to evangelize about the\nvalue of more robust data analytics for baseball. Nobody listened. Bill James\ninitially found just 75 buyers for his statistical analysis, Baseball\nAbstract. They persisted in obscurity.\n\nThen, as Michael Lewis documented in his hit book-turned-Brad-Pitt-film\nMoneyball, the Oakland Athletics under Billy Beane decided to harness the\npower of data\u2014to spend less money but win more.\n\nThe thesis of Moneyball is that Beane outsmarted the competition because he\nrealized that wins are made by teams, not by individual stars. Using\nsophisticated data analytics, the Oakland A\u2019s were able to spot value where\nothers overlooked it, realizing that understanding a team, like understanding\nany system, often requires more than just analyzing constituent parts. This\nsystems-based, data-driven approach\u2014aided by so-called\nsabermetrics\u2014revolutionized the game, making statistics central to modern\nsports. And it worked: new data tools were really effective at making teams\nwin. The analytics boom transformed sports.\n\nMoneyball was the book and film that launched a thousand insufferable LinkedIn\nposts. \u201cEverything should be moneyballed,\u201d proclaimed the hordes of business\nbros. Trying to drive your lagging Q3 profits through the roof? No success on\nthe dating apps? Well, why don\u2019t you step away from your typewriter, join the\nmodern world, and take a page out of the Billy Beane playbook, you\nantediluvian fool!\n\nThe world, the LinkedIn bros claimed, was only broken because antiquated\nidiots were ignoring the obvious lesson that Michael Lewis had spotted: if you\njust deploy data analytics on any problem, you need only wait for the Poof!\nsound as it\u2019s magically fixed before your eyes. Modern wizards should no\nlonger wrap their fingers around wands, but extend them to dance across\nkeyboards, unleashing a powerful form of 21st century digital magic: Excel\nformulas.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t want to alarm you, but if you were to take a little look around\nyou, it may not escape your notice that, even two decades after Moneyball, the\nworld has not been magically fixed.\n\nWhat went wrong? Are all of our problems simply derived from the sad fact that\nthe powerful evangelism of the business bros has been callously ignored?\n\n###\n\nII: Treating mysteries as puzzles will destroy us\n\nAlas, our problems run deeper and cannot be solved with LinkedIn wisdom. Data\nanalytics are revolutionary in some contexts, solving problems that were\npreviously impossible to tame.1 But in other situations, worshipping analytics\nas a digital gospel creates avoidable catastrophic risks.\n\nHow can we spot the difference?\n\nIn their book, Radical Uncertainty, Mervyn King2 and John Kay draw a\ndistinction between two kinds of problems: puzzles and mysteries.\n\nPuzzles are easy.\n\nThey\u2019re well-defined problems, often with clear-cut rules, and a\nstraightforward set of possible outcomes. This is the Land of Nate Silver,\nwhere data analytics offer the best guide and better number crunching is\nalways the answer.\n\nKay and King highlight that puzzles are easy because the underlying process is\nmore or less understood; the nature of cause and effect remains constant over\ntime; and the process isn\u2019t altered by our beliefs or behavior. NASA missions\noffer a puzzle. The calculations have to be perfect, but if they are, a\nspacecraft can land on a distant asteroid and there will be no mystery as to\nwhy it worked. Puzzles can be solved in a relatively straightforward way\u2014with\nmore data, better models, smarter analytics. Some puzzles are harder than\nothers, but they follow those general principles.\n\nBaseball is a classic puzzle. The rules are basically unchanging. There are\ntwo teams competing. The same teams battle it out season after season. And\nthere are only two outcomes: Team A or Team B will win. A third team can\u2019t\nwin. Rules can\u2019t change midway through. There\u2019s no conceivable way that the\ngame will last four days or that one team will score 1,000 runs. We know, with\ncertainty, that the 9th inning won\u2019t spark a political revolution. It\u2019s\ncontained, constrained, with a small set of possible, repeatable outcomes.\nIt\u2019s more akin to a series of coin flips\u2014we understand the causal dynamics and\nthe more you do it, the better you understand what\u2019s going on.\n\nIn the realm of puzzles, past patterns offer an accurate guide to future\noutcomes. Moneyball works in those situations, so the LinkedIn bros are proven\nright.\n\nMysteries, by contrast, are hard.\n\nThese are loosely defined problems with radically uncertain outcomes.3 \u201cWhat\nwill the world look like in 2050?\u201d is a mystery, not a puzzle. You can\u2019t just\nfeed data into an Excel spreadsheet and find out the answer. The limitations\nof our understanding within the realm of mysteries becomes particularly clear\nwhen you consider that every forecast for 2020 and beyond\u2014even those made\nmonths earlier\u2014was obliterated by the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn the realm of mysteries, the past offers no credible guide to future\noutcomes. In some areas of life, we don\u2019t\u2014and can\u2019t\u2014know what\u2019s going to\nhappen, no matter how adept we become with spreadsheets and statistics.\n(Trying to determine, right now, who will win between Trump and Biden is a\nmystery, not a puzzle. It\u2019s literally impossible to know).\n\nKing and Kay, in Radical Uncertainty, accurately diagnose a key problem: we\ntreat too many mysteries as though they are puzzles. They use the analogy of a\nman stumbling home drunk, having lost his keys. He begins his search on a dark\nroad, gravitating toward the area of pavement bathed in the glow of a lone\nstreetlamp. \u201cIs that where you lost your keys?\u201d his friend asks. \u201cNo,\u201d the\ndrunk replies, \u201cbut the light\u2019s better here.\u201d Just because a strategy is\npossible doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wise.\n\nThat analogy helps explain why perils lurk when we confuse a mystery for a\npuzzle, deploying data analytics as the sole tool for decision-making in a\nradically uncertain environment. When that happens, it often blows up in our\nfaces, a human-engineered catastrophe borne from the hubris of misapplied Big\nData. Powerful tools used incorrectly are dangerous.4 They can make us behave\nwith arrogant certainty in the face of radical uncertainty.\n\nThe smart strategy, then, isn\u2019t to Moneyball everything, but rather to\nrecognize when we are in a world that\u2019s more akin to Calvinball\u2014and then to\ntread carefully.\n\n###\n\nIII: Closed systems, open systems, and Calvinball\n\nIn the much-beloved comic \u201cCalvin and Hobbes,\u201d the young boy and his pet tiger\nplay a game known as Calvinball. The game has precisely two rules:\n\n  1. The rules must be different every time.\n\n  2. All players must wear a mask at all times.\n\nWhile both rules applied best to the unsettling masking period during the\npandemic, the central notion of Calvinball is the opposite of Moneyball: if\nthe rules are constantly changing, then data analytics will be useless. After\nall, past performance is no guide for future success. You could win Tuesday\u2019s\nCalvinball game by being a fast runner, only to have that same speed turn into\na hindrance under the Wednesday rules. Past isn\u2019t prologue.\n\nA completely unique game of Calvinball.\n\nCalvinball therefore presents a world of non-stationarity, where the patterns\nof cause and effect are constantly shifting. You might think that you\u2019ve\ncracked the code by inferring patterns from previous games, but you\u2019d only be\nfooling yourself. The patterns would be illusory, subject to constant flux,\nand if you bet on Calvinball based on those analytics, you\u2019d eventually lose a\nlot of money. Forecasting Calvinball is impossible; the game will always be a\nmystery, never a puzzle\u2014no matter the computing power.\n\nIn many realms of the world, we pretend that we are playing by the rules of\nMoneyball when we\u2019re actually playing Calvinball. Our world is defined by non-\nstationarity. So, how do we grapple with this problem? Well, I regret to\ninform you that most of the time, we just pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. That\u2019s why\nmany of you have never heard the phrase \u201cnon-stationarity\u201d before this\ninstant.\n\nMost models of our insanely complex world also pretend that the world is a\nstationary closed system, a make-believe fantasyland with stable cause and\neffect relationships, a finite set of inputs, and a constrained set of\noutputs.\n\nBy contrast, the real world is an open system, in which cause and effect\nrelationships are ever-changing, reality is far more chaotic than any model\ncan process, and (so long as events follow the laws of physics), just about\nanything can happen. As with Calvinball, the same event can play out with\ntotally different rules and outcomes, across time and space.\n\nWhat might have happened if covid-19 had struck in 1990 instead of 2020?\nImagine the exact same virus, infecting someone in Wuhan, but thirty years\nearlier. Everything would have unfolded differently. For starters, in 1990,\njust three million people had access to the internet. Working from home would\nhave been impossible. The economic and social effects of the same virus would\nhave diverged immensely.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning. Who knows what would have happened with the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union if the pandemic hit right before the 1990 mass\nprotests began? It\u2019s impossible to say. In a chaotic world, changing anything\ncan change everything.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just decades that need to pass for our world to lurch into\nCalvinball territory. If September 11th, 2001 had been September 10th, 2001,\nsome of the hijackers might have never taken off, stuck on delayed flights.\nThere were storms on the 10th, but blindingly blue skies on the 11th.\nMoreover, as I wrote in Fluke:\n\n> The passengers on United Airlines Flight 93 took down their hijacked plane\n> before it could reach its intended target, but it\u2019s perfectly plausible that\n> a different set of passengers on September 10th or 12th might have acted\n> differently\u2014and the White House or U.S. Capitol might\u2019ve been destroyed.\n\nConsider this question:\n\nWould the attack on January 6th, 2021 have happened if the US Capitol had\npreviously been blown up by a hijacked airplane two decades earlier?\n\nWho knows! Our world would be different if the US Capitol had become rubble.\nBut it\u2019s absurd to believe that data analytics could help answer that\nquestion. It\u2019s an area of radical uncertainty, not one in which better\nspreadsheets or regressions can help you find the right answer. A mystery\u2014not\na puzzle.\n\nShare\n\nAnd yet, modern life is governed, to an alarming extent, by those who are\nusing Moneyball tactics to solve Calvinball problems. It laces catastrophic\nrisk into our societies. Why? Because we think we know the answer to questions\nthat are fundamentally unknowable. And that produces hubristic decision-\nmaking.\n\n###\n\nIV: The optimization / resilience trade-off\n\nIn Moneyball systems\u2014the stable world of puzzles\u2014there is limited downside to\never-greater analytics. NASA, for example, wants to converge toward perfect\nprecision within the stable systems of space objects. If the rocket nerds can\nget even 0.0001 percent more accurate in their measurements, that could be\ndecisive in their ability to land a human-made object on a distant rock\nhurtling through space while following the predictable laws of physics. For\nNASA, there\u2019s no downside to better data, fed through improved analytics,\nexploited more effectively.\n\nBut in most complex systems\u2014the social systems we inhabit and use to govern\nourselves\u2014there is a tradeoff between optimization and resilience. Puzzles can\nbe optimized. Mysteries can\u2019t\u2014or at least not with significant risk of\ndisaster.\n\nIn the world of mysteries\u2014like whether a pandemic lurks around the corner, or\nwhat might happen if global temperatures continue to surge\u2014focusing on\nresilience is a wiser strategy. When you know exactly how something works and\nthose dynamics don\u2019t change over time, then, by all means\u2014optimize to the\nlimit using past data. But when you are unsure of exactly what\u2019s going on in a\nsystem, or the underlying dynamics might shift, then optimization to the limit\ncourts disaster. Never Moneyball a mystery.\n\nBeyond resilience, it\u2019s also wise to approach mysteries through\nexperimentation. I previously explained the virtues of experimentation, but in\nthe face of uncertainty, experimenting helps you trial possible solutions.\nThis yields the following lessons, which are rarely followed in modern, data-\ndriven life:\n\n  1. Use data analytics only to optimize when solving puzzles\u2014and when you know exactly what you\u2019re trying to solve.\n\n  2. If facing a mystery that you don\u2019t, or can\u2019t, fully understand, dial down efforts to optimize, rely less on flawed data models, and focus instead on resilience and experimentation.\n\nEven then, the misapplication of data analytics can backfire if it turns out\nyou\u2019re optimizing for the wrong metric, getting ever-better at solving the\nwrong puzzle.\n\n###\n\nV: The McNamara Fallacy, the Surefire Mediocre, and the emptiness of a\nLifehack Lifestyle\n\nRobert McNamara was the original King of Big Data. He used metrics for\neverything, from his work at Ford Motor Company to overseeing the disastrous\nVietnam War. But he was seduced by the flawed notion that only that which\ncould be measured is important\u2014and in the process forgot what actually\nmattered. In one instance at Ford, he insisted that all spare parts be used up\nbefore production could continue. Eventually, his subordinates met their data\ntarget by dumping all the spares in the nearby river.\n\nIn Vietnam, he fetishized the \u201cbody count,\u201d a tally\u2014often exaggerated to\nplacate McNamara\u2014of American versus Viet Cong casualties. Not only did\nMcNamara underestimate how much more Americans cared about US deaths than\nthose of the Viet Cong, he also completely ignored difficult-to-measure\naspects that decide wars, such as the hearts and minds of the local people.\n\nOne general, Edward Lansdale, told McNamara that he should include the\nfeelings of rural Vietnamese people in his analysis of the war. McNamara\napparently scribbled this suggestion down in pencil, then erased it, telling\nLansdale that it must not be important since it couldn\u2019t be measured.\n\nThe Vietnam data boondoggle gave rise to the McNamara Fallacy, the false\nnotion that every problem can be analyzed\u2014then solved\u2014exclusively with\nquantitative data and better metrics. McNamara thought he should optimize for\nbody count, when in fact, the only thing that mattered was whether the US\ncould win the war. They were not remotely the same.\n\nWith much lower stakes, Moneyballing fell into a similar trap of mismatching\nthe optimization metric with the broader goal. Again, from Fluke:\n\n> \u201cThe analytics were so effective that the game became boring...Baseball\n> became more like two spreadsheets of convergent probabilities battling it\n> out on a diamond. The sport was optimizing for the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nWe watch sports for excitement, not statistical optimization. As teams\nfollowed the data, fans stopped watching. In response, Major League Baseball\nwas forced to change several rules to \u201cde-moneyball\u201d the game, creating more\nuncertainty\u2014and excitement. They had fixated on the analytics, but solved the\nwrong puzzle.\n\nIn creative realms, Moneyballing can create an explosion of cultural sludge,\nas companies chase the \u201csurefire mediocre,\u201d converging toward banal\nblockbusters, McMansion architecture, and simply replicating that which worked\npreviously. If applied incorrectly, data analytics can lead to convergence\ntoward bleak averages, with dreary consequences for human culture.\n\nThe same lesson, alas, applies to us.\n\nWe have been sold the lie that the good life is one that is fully optimized,\nwhere life hacks obliterate any lingering demons of inefficiency, with\nsuccessful days measured solely by the numbers of items crossed out on to-do\nlists. When trying to get to the airport on time, Google Maps is a godsend.\nBut when we choose to take an optimized route to shave off a minute\u2014even it\ndiverts us from a slower but better road toward awe, or wonder, or\nexploration\u2014we strip out and murder part of our humanity, sacrificing it on\nthe altar of hyper-efficient, data-driven control.\n\n13.8 billion years of the Universe\u2019s tinkering has culminated in us, creatures\nwith the most extraordinary and seemingly unique consciousness. It would be a\nwaste to devote that cognitive magic and the overwhelming improbability of our\nexistence to a Lifehack Lifestyle, with an unquenchable thirst for\noptimization.\n\nModern data wizardry allows us unprecedented opportunities to tame truly\ndestructive scourges: crippling poverty, devastating disease, premature death.\nIt will help us solve important puzzles. But we would be wise to avoid taming\nthe wildness that makes us human\u2014all while ensuring that we don\u2019t make the\ncatastrophic, Sisyphean error of imagining that we can and should try to use\ndata analytics to tame the world\u2019s enduring, unknowable mysteries.\n\nThank you for reading The Garden of Forking Paths.

(Seriously, though,\nRadical Uncertainty is an excellent book\u2014and an important corrective).\n\n3\n\nWe recognize, instantly, that questions such as \u201cwhat is the meaning of life?\u201d\nor \u201cIs there a God?\u201d cannot be answered with data analytics. But many more\nconcrete questions are mysteries, even if we too often mistake them for\npuzzles.\n\n4\n\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me here: I am a huge believer in the power of data to\nsolve puzzles. This is about which realms are beyond the scope of analytics.\nIt\u2019s possible to believe in the power of Big Data while suggesting that it\u2019s\nbeing over-used, inappropriately, in some realms where it is useless or\ndangerous. That\u2019s my argument.\n\n### Subscribe to The Garden of Forking Paths\n\nBy Brian Klaas \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nWandering around an infinitely complex, ever changing world.\n\n127 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n16 Restacks\n\n127\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Perils of Moneyballing Everything\n\nwww.forkingpaths.co\n\n11\n\nShare\n\n11 Comments\n\nDan LyndonForces of Culture14 hrs agoLiked by Brian KlaasI was just working on\nan essay with this premise, but sharing yours will have to do for now.
