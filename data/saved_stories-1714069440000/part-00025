Why would Europe need a digital euro?\n\nDigitalisation is changing the way we pay. The use of cash to make payments is\ndeclining and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the shift\ntowards online shopping and digital payments. A digital euro would be an\nelectronic form of cash for the digitalised world. It would give consumers the\noption to use central bank money in a digital format, complementing banknotes\nand coins.\n\nA digital euro would make people\u2019s lives easier by providing something that\ndoes not currently exist: a digital means of payment universally accepted\nthroughout the euro area, for payments in shops, online or from person to\nperson. Like cash, a digital euro would be risk-free, widely accessible, user-\nfriendly and free for basic use.\n\nMoreover, a digital euro would strengthen the strategic autonomy and monetary\nsovereignty of the euro area by boosting the efficiency of the European\npayments ecosystem as a whole, fostering innovation and increasing its\nresilience to potential cyberattacks or technical disruptions, such as power\noutages.\n\nFurther information on why we need a digital euro.\n\n### Q2. How could a digital euro contribute to Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy?\n\nA digital euro would offer a pan-European payment solution, available\nthroughout the euro area, under European governance. It could therefore help\nreduce Europe\u2019s dependence on private, non-European payment providers, while\nacting as a counterweight to their market dominance. In turn, a digital euro\nwould make the European payments landscape more competitive and innovative by\noffering a platform that makes it easier for payment service providers to\noffer pan-European solutions of their own.\n\nOverall, a successful digital euro could turn Europe into a global frontrunner\nin digital finance and central bank digital currencies.\n\n### Q3. Would a digital euro replace cash?\n\nNo. A digital euro would complement cash, not replace it. A digital euro would\nexist alongside cash in response to people\u2019s growing preference to pay\ndigitally, in a fast and secure way. Cash would continue to be available in\nthe euro area, as would the other private electronic means of payment\ncurrently being used.\n\n### Q4. Would a digital euro be an alternative currency within the Eurosystem?\n\nNo. A digital euro would be another way to pay using the euro, our single\ncurrency, in Europe. It would be convertible one-to-one with banknotes. A\ndigital euro would respond to people\u2019s and firms\u2019 growing preference to pay\ndigitally.\n\n### Q5. Where does the digital euro project currently stand?\n\nAfter a two-year investigation phase, the ECB\u2019s Governing Council decided to\nproceed to a preparation phase, starting on 1 November 2023.\n\nThe preparation phase will comprise two stages: The first stage began on 1\nNovember 2023 and will last for two years. Based on the results of the first\nstage and developments in the legislative process, the Governing Council would\nthen decide whether to move to a second stage, and define its scope and\nduration.\n\nThe purpose of the entire phase is to further develop and test a digital euro,\nin line with the design choices and technical requirements defined during the\ninvestigation phase.\n\nThe preparation phase would allow extensive analysis, testing, experimentation\nand stakeholder consultation to take place, ensuring the digital euro meets\nthe highest standards of quality, security and usability.\n\nThe start of the preparation phase marks a significant step, but it does not\npre-empt any decision by the Governing Council on the issuance of a digital\neuro. That decision can only be considered after the relevant legislation has\nbeen adopted.\n\n### Q6. How are European legislators involved in the process?\n\nOn 28 June 2023, the European Commission presented a draft legislative\nproposal for a possible digital euro. The purpose of the legislation is to\nensure that any future digital euro would give people and businesses an\nadditional choice to pay digitally using a widely accepted, cheap, secure and\nresilient form of public money anywhere in the euro area.\n\nThe two processes \u2013 legislation and digital euro design \u2013 will develop in\nparallel so that the Eurosystem can be in a position to promptly issue a\ndigital euro, if and when the decision is warranted once the legislative\nframework for the digital euro has been adopted.\n\nThe Eurosystem will consider any necessary adjustments to the design of a\ndigital euro that may emerge from legislative deliberations. The ECB also\nstands ready to provide support and technical input during the legislative\nprocess, as required.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s Governing Council will decide on whether to issue a digital euro\nonly after the legislative act has been adopted.\n\n### Q7. Who is involved in the digital euro project?\n\nThe Eurosystem \u2013 the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area \u2013\nmust ensure that a digital euro meets users\u2019 needs. For this reason, the\nEurosystem cooperates closely and engages regularly with policymakers,\nlegislators, market participants and civil society organisations. Focus\ngroups, as fora for listening directly to people\u2019s views and preferences, have\nalso been invaluable.\n\nThese engagements take place in different contexts, such as the Euro Retail\nPayments Board, a forum chaired by the ECB, gathering all stakeholders of the\npayments market; or the Market Advisory Group, comprising experts who provided\ninput on the product design and distribution of a digital euro during the\ninvestigation phase.\n\nMoreover, the ECB regularly participates in Eurogroup meetings with the\nfinance ministers of the euro area countries and appears on a regular basis\nbefore the European Parliament to present the latest project updates to\nEuropean policymakers. It also organises seminars with European civil society\norganisations to listen to their views.\n\n### Q8. Who would be able to use a digital euro?\n\nAs stated in the legislative proposal presented by the European Commission, a\ndigital euro would be made available to people, businesses and public entities\nthat reside or are established in a euro area Member State on a temporary or\npermanent basis.\n\nPeople who travel to the euro area for personal or professional purposes, or\nwho used to reside or be established in a euro area country, might also have\naccess to the digital euro.\n\nMoreover, people, businesses and public entities residing or established\noutside the euro area may access the digital euro by opening digital euro\naccounts with payment service providers established or operating in a country\nwhich is a Member of the European Economic Area^[1]\n\nThe European Economic Area consists of the EU Member States and Iceland,\nLiechtenstein and Norway.\n\nor in a third country, subject to a prior agreement concluded between the EU\nand third countries, and/or arrangements concluded between the European\nCentral Bank and national central banks in non-euro area Member States and in\nthird countries.\n\n### Q9. Why would people want to use a digital euro?\n\nA digital euro would be a payment solution for every occasion, for use anytime\nand anywhere in the euro area. It would be a universally accepted digital\nmeans of payment that consumers could use free of charge in shops, online or\nfrom person to person. It would give people the option to pay digitally, while\nstill using a public means of payment. And it would be available both online\nand offline.\n\nA digital euro would be designed to provide a superior level of privacy to\nother digital payment methods. The Eurosystem would not be able to identify\npeople based on their payments. Personal transaction details from offline\ndigital euro payments would be known only to the payer and the payee.\n\nA digital euro would be safe and easy to use and would also seek to promote\ndigital financial inclusion by ensuring that no one is left behind. A digital\neuro would accommodate the needs of people with disabilities and those with no\naccess to a bank account or lacking digital or financial skills.\n\nTo ensure a digital euro would be usable and accessible throughout the euro\narea, the draft legislative proposal presented by the European Commission\nforesees mandatory acceptance by merchants and mandatory distribution by\nsupervised intermediaries to their clients.\n\n### Q10. What value would a digital euro bring to merchants?\n\nA digital euro would be a truly pan-European solution, accepted throughout the\neuro area. It could provide an easier and cheaper alternative to the currently\nfragmented payments landscape in which merchants work. A digital euro would\nput merchants in a stronger position to negotiate conditions with payment\nsolution providers and thus reduce their own costs. These lower costs could\nthen be passed on to customers.\n\nThanks to a digital euro, merchants could also benefit from higher conversion\nrates. This is particularly relevant for online shopping, as customers are\nless likely to turn down a purchase if they are familiar with the payment\ninstrument. Moreover, a digital euro would also allow merchants to receive\npayments instantly without any additional costs.\n\n### Q11. What value would a digital euro bring to intermediaries?\n\nSupervised intermediaries, such as banks, would have a key role in the\ndistribution of a digital euro. They would act as the main point of contact\nfor individuals, merchants and businesses for all digital euro-related issues\nand would perform all end-user services.\n\nA digital euro would allow intermediaries to have immediate reach throughout\nthe entire euro area, unlike most private innovations, which tend to focus on\nspecific domestic markets. Thus, a digital euro could serve as a platform for\nintermediaries to foster further innovation and competition in the growing\ne-commerce and digital payment markets across the euro area.\n\nA digital euro could also bring additional business opportunities for\nintermediaries. For instance, as proposed by the Eurosystem, if merchants\noutside the euro area wanted to operate in digital euro, they would need to\nhave an account with a payment service provider from the euro area.\n\nMoreover, the digital euro compensation model, as currently foreseen in the\nEuropean Commission\u2019s draft legislative proposal, provides intermediaries with\neconomic incentives comparable to other digital means of payment. In this\nregard, a digital euro also opens the door for intermediaries to invest in\nadditional value-added services for their customers.\n\n### Q12. Would people have to pay to use a digital euro?\n\nA digital euro would be a public good. It would therefore be free for basic\nuse by the people who want to use it.\n\nNevertheless, supervised intermediaries, including banks, could use the basic\nfunctionalities of a digital euro as a basis to further develop their own\nplatforms and solutions. These intermediaries could then potentially go on to\noffer their customers other value-added services at a cost.\n\n### Q13. How would a digital euro work?\n\nA digital euro would allow people to make secure instant payments in physical\nand online stores and between individuals, irrespective of the euro area\ncountry they are in or the payment service provider they have an account with.\nThe ECB is currently exploring how this could work in practice.\n\nFor instance, the Eurosystem would develop a dedicated digital euro app that\neveryone could have equal access to. Alternatively, intermediaries, including\nbanks, could integrate digital euro services within their existing apps, which\ntheir customers are already familiar with. In any case, people without access\nto a bank account or digital devices would also be able to pay with a digital\neuro using a physical card provided by public intermediaries, such as post\noffices.\n\nIn any case, a digital euro would offer both online and offline\nfunctionalities, anticipating situations of limited connectivity. When digital\neuro payments are made offline, personal transaction details would only be\nknown to the payer and the payee.\n\nFurther information on how a digital euro would work.\n\n### Q14. How private would a digital euro be?\n\nPrivacy is one of the most important design features of a digital euro. The\nEurosystem has no interest in people\u2019s personal payment data or payment\nhabits. The Eurosystem would not be able to identify people based on their\ntransactions.\n\nA digital euro would allow people to make online payments without sharing\ntheir data with third parties, other than those that are required to prevent\nillicit activities, in line with European regulations.\n\nOffline digital euro payments would provide an even higher level of privacy.\nPersonal transaction details would only be known to the payer and the payee.\n\n### Q15. How would the ECB ensure that a digital euro is inclusive?\n\nA digital euro would be a public good, like banknotes and coins are today \u2013\nbut in a digital form.\n\nA digital euro would be free for basic use, via a mobile app or a physical\ncard, by people who want to use it. A digital euro would also work offline, in\ncase users have limited connectivity.\n\nThe draft legislation presented by the European Commission establishes that\ncredit institutions distributing a digital euro would be required to provide\nbasic digital euro payment services when requested by their customers.\n\nMoreover, to ensure that everyone \u2013 including people with disabilities, those\nwith functional limitations or limited digital skills, and elderly people \u2013\ncan pay using digital euro, public entities, such as post offices, will be\nidentified in each euro area country. These entities would provide people\nvulnerable to digital financial exclusion with free support and access to\ndigital euro services, such as face-to-face support and dedicated assistance\nwhen opening a digital euro account and using all basic digital euro services.\nFree access to the basic services of a digital euro would also be offered to\npeople without a bank account.\n\nMoreover, a particular focus will be placed on the inclusion of vulnerable\ngroups, such as individuals with no fixed address, asylum seekers or\nbeneficiaries of international protection.\n\nA digital euro would be designed to accommodate the needs of everyone, leaving\nno one behind.\n\n### Q16. Would a digital euro be programmable money?\n\nA digital euro would never be programmable money.\n\nProgrammable money is a digital form of money used for a predefined purpose,\nlike a voucher, with limitations on where, when or with whom people can use\nit.\n\nAs also envisaged in the digital euro legislative proposal presented by the\nEuropean Commission, a digital euro would not be programmable money but could\nfacilitate automated payments, if users want to use this function. For\nexample, a user could decide to set up an automatic monthly payment to\ninstantaneously transfer digital euro to family members or friends.\n\n### Q17. Would intermediaries be compensated for distributing a digital euro?\n\nThe Eurosystem proposes a compensation model that would create fair economic\nincentives for payment service providers, like banks, to address the\noperational costs of distributing a digital euro.\n\nAs is currently the case with other payment systems, payment service providers\ndistributing a digital euro would be able to charge merchants for these\nservices. Price setting for merchants and payment service providers would be\nsubject to a cap, as proposed by the European Commission in their digital euro\nlegislative proposal.\n\nAs with the production and issuance of banknotes, the Eurosystem would bear\nthe costs of the establishment of a digital euro scheme and infrastructure.\nMoreover, the Eurosystem would aim to minimise additional investment costs for\nintermediaries by re-using existing infrastructures as much as possible.\n\n### Q18. Would a digital euro pose a threat to financial stability by\ndisintermediating banks?\n\nOur financial system \u2013 with the banking system at its centre \u2013 functions well,\nand the Eurosystem wants to preserve banks\u2019 key role in ensuring the efficient\nprovision of credit to the real economy.\n\nThe ECB will minimise any potential threat a digital euro may pose to the\nfinancial system. Thus, the amount of digital euro that users can hold in\ntheir accounts will be limited to prevent outflows of bank deposits, even in\ntimes of crisis.\n\n### Q19. How would the ECB ensure that people can pay with digital euro in the\nsame way throughout the euro area?\n\nSupervised intermediaries would be in charge of distributing a digital euro in\nthe euro area. To ensure harmonious implementation, the Eurosystem is\ndesigning a digital euro scheme that consists of a single set of rules,\nstandards and procedures for the standardisation of digital euro payments\nacross the euro area, ensuring pan-European reach.\n\nThis single set of rules, standards and procedures is currently being\ndeveloped in close collaboration with market representatives, including users,\nretailers and intermediaries, by the Rulebook Development Group.\n\n### Q20. How is the single set of rules, standards and procedures for a\ndigital euro being developed?\n\nTo support the drafting of the digital euro single set of rules, standards and\nprocedures, the Eurosystem has established a digital euro scheme Rulebook\nDevelopment Group to obtain input from the financial industry, consumers and\nmerchants.\n\nThe group, which is composed of Eurosystem staff and market representatives\nwith relevant experience, is working on the basis of the digital euro design\nchoices that have already been approved by the ECB\u2019s Governing Council.\n\nIn addition to the group, a number of dedicated rulebook development\nworkstreams have been created to work on specific sections of the rulebook\nthat require particular expertise.\n\n### Q21. What will be the scope of the digital euro rulebook?\n\nThe digital euro rulebook will lay out the single set of rules, standards and\nprocedures that supervised intermediaries would have to follow when\ndistributing a digital euro. These rules, standards and procedures will cover\nthe:\n\n  * functional and operational model of a digital euro (e.g. end-to-end flows, core requirements for supervised intermediaries, minimum user experience standards, etc.);\n  * adherence model of the digital euro scheme (e.g. scheme eligibility criteria, participant obligations, etc.);\n  * technical scheme requirements (e.g. IT infrastructure, application programming interface implementation, technical standards, etc.);\n  * risk management requirements;\n  * digital euro scheme management rules (e.g. scheme governance, change management processes, etc.).\n\n### Q22. What would be the link between instant payments and a digital euro?\n\nToday, consumers rarely have the option to use instant payments when paying in\nshops, which also means that merchants don\u2019t receive their money immediately.\nA digital euro would change that \u2013 all digital euro payments would be instant.\n\nThe single set of rules, standards and procedures developed and, if approved,\nimplemented for a digital euro would mean that instant payment solutions could\nbe further developed to reach all euro area countries. This would reduce the\ndependence on private non-European companies that are currently dominating the\npayments sector.\n\n### Q23. Would a digital euro be based on a distributed ledger technology such\nas blockchain?\n\nThe Eurosystem is experimenting with different technologies \u2013 both centralised\nand decentralised \u2013 in the development of a digital euro, including\ndistributed ledger technologies. However, a decision has not yet been taken.\n\n### Q24. Would the introduction of a digital euro make payments in Europe more\nvulnerable to cyberattacks?\n\nAs with other digital infrastructures, a digital euro could be a target for\ncyberattacks. To mitigate this risk, the design of a digital euro would rely\non state-of-the-art technologies that would create a cyber-resilient and\nfuture-proof environment.\n\n### Q25. How would a digital euro be different from stablecoins and crypto-\nassets?\n\nA digital euro would be central bank money. This means that it would be backed\nby a central bank and designed to meet the needs of the people using it. As\nsuch it would be risk-free. Moreover, it would respect privacy and data\nprotection. Central banks have a mandate to maintain the value of money,\nwhether it be in physical or digital form.\n\nThe stability and reliability of stablecoins ultimately depend on the entity\nthat issues them and the credibility and enforceability of their pledge to\nmaintain the money\u2019s value over time. Private issuers may also use personal\ndata for commercial purposes.\n\nThere is no identifiable entity that is liable for crypto-assets, which means\nthat claims cannot be enforced.\n\n  1.
