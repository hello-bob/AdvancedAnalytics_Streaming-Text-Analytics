We would not sit\nquietly in our white-bodied privilege, nor would our corrections be given\napologetically or packaged with niceties. There I was, one of about 30 people\nattending a four-day-long Zoom seminar called \u201cThe Toxic Trends of Whiteness,\u201d\nhosted by the group Education for Racial Equity.\n\nAn older white woman whom I\u2019ll call Stacy had confessed to the group that she\nwas ashamed of being white, and that she hoped in her next life she wouldn\u2019t\nbe white anymore. This provided us with a major learning moment. One\nparticipant began by amping herself up, intoning the concepts we\u2019d been taught\nover the past two days: \u201cGrounding, rooting, removing Bubble Wrap.\u201d Then she\ngot into it. \u201cWhat I heard you say about wanting to come back as a dark-\nskinned person in your next life was racist, because as white people we don\u2019t\nhave the luxury of trying on aspects of people of color.\u201d\n\n\u201cNotice how challenging that was,\u201d our facilitator, Carlin Quinn, said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what getting your reps in looks like.\u201d\n\nAnother woman went next, explaining that Stacy seemed to see people of color\nas better or more desirable, that her statement was \u201can othering.\u201d Quinn\nprompted her to sum it up in one sentence: \u201cWhen you said that you wish you\nwould come back in your next life as a dark-skinned person, I experienced that\nas racist because ...\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was racist because it exoticized Black people.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Quinn said. She pushed for more from everyone, and more came. Stacy\u2019s\nstatement was romanticizing. It was extractive. It was erasing. Stacy sat very\nstill. Eventually we finished. Stacy thanked everyone, her voice thin.\n\nThe seminar would culminate with a talk from Robin DiAngelo, the most\nprominent anti-racist educator working in America. I had signed up because I\nwas curious about her teachings, which had suddenly become so popular.\nDiAngelo\u2019s 2018 book, White Fragility: Why It\u2019s So Hard for White People to\nTalk About Racism, had been a best seller for years by the time I joined the\ntoxic whiteness group in May 2021. But during the heat of the Black Lives\nMatter protests, her influence boomed. She was brought in to advise Democratic\nmembers of the House of Representatives. Coca-Cola, Disney, and Lockheed\nMartin sent their employees through DiAngelo-inspired diversity trainings;\neven the defense company Raytheon launched an anti-racism DEI program.\n\nIn the DiAngelo doctrine, the issue was not individual racists doing singular\nbad acts. All white people are racist, because racism is structural. To fix\none\u2019s inherent racism requires constant work, and it requires white people to\ntalk about their whiteness. Seminars like hers exploded as anti-racism was\nshifted from a project of changing laws and fighting systems into a more\npsychological movement: something you did within yourself. It was therapeutic.\nIt wasn\u2019t about elevating others so much as about deconstructing yourself in\nhopes of eventually deconstructing the systems around you.\n\nRead: Abolish DEI statements\n\nAnti-racism courses are less popular today. This may in part be because more\npeople have become willing to question the efficacy of corporate DEI programs,\nbut it\u2019s surely also because their lessons now show up everywhere. In March at\nUCLA Medical School, during a required course, a guest speaker had the first-\nyear medical students kneel and pray to \u201cMama Earth\u201d before saying that\nmedicine was \u201cwhite science,\u201d as first reported by The Washington Free Beacon.\nThe course I took was just a preview of what\u2019s come to be expected in\nworkplaces and schools all over the country.\n\nDiAngelo and her fellow thinkers are right in many ways. The economic fallout\nof structural racism persists in this country\u2014fallout from rules, for example,\nabout where Black people could buy property, laws that for generations have\ninfluenced who is rich and who is poor. The laws may be gone, but plenty of\nracists are left. And the modern anti-racist movement is right that we all\nprobably do have some racism and xenophobia in us. The battle of modernity and\nliberalism is fighting against our tribal natures and animal selves.\n\nI went into the workshop skeptical that contemporary anti-racist ideology was\nhelpful in that fight. I left exhausted and emotional and, honestly, moved. I\nleft as the teachers would want me to leave: thinking a lot about race and my\nwhiteness, the weight of my skin. But telling white people to think about how\ndeeply white they are, telling them that their sense of objectivity and\nindividualism are white, that they need to stop trying to change the world and\nfocus more on changing themselves ... well, I\u2019m not sure that has the\npsychological impact the teachers are hoping it will, let alone that it will\nlead to any tangible improvement in the lives of people who aren\u2019t white.\n\nMuch of what I learned in \u201cThe Toxic Trends of Whiteness\u201d concerned language.\nWe are \u201cwhite bodies,\u201d Quinn explained, but everyone else is a \u201cbody of\nculture.\u201d This is because white bodies don\u2019t know a lot about themselves,\nwhereas \u201cbodies of culture know their history. Black bodies know.\u201d\n\nThe course began with easy questions (names, what we do, what we love), and an\nicebreaker: What are you struggling with or grappling with related to your\nwhiteness? We were told that our answers should be \u201cas close to the bone as\npossible, as naked, as emotionally revealing.\u201d We needed to feel\nuncomfortable.\n\nOne woman loved gardening. Another loved the sea. People said they felt\nexhausted by constantly trying to fight their white supremacy. A woman with a\nbiracial child said she was scared that her whiteness could harm her child.\nSome expressed frustration. It was hard, one participant said, that after\nfighting the patriarchy for so long, white women were now \u201csort of being told\nto step aside.\u201d She wanted to know how to do that without feeling resentment.\nThe woman who loved gardening was afraid of \u201cbeing a middle-aged white woman\nand being called a Karen.\u201d\n\nA woman who worked in nonprofits admitted that she was struggling to overcome\nher own skepticism. Quinn picked up on that: How did that skepticism show up?\n\u201cWanting to say, \u2018Prove it.\u2019 Are we sure that racism is the explanation for\neverything?\u201d\n\nJohn McWhorter: The dehumanizing condescension of White Fragility\n\nShe was nervous, and that was good, Quinn said: \u201cIt\u2019s really an important\ngauge, an edginess of honesty and vulnerability\u2014like where it kind of makes\nyou want to throw up.\u201d\n\nOne participant was a diversity, equity, and inclusion manager at a consulting\nfirm, and she was struggling with how to help people of color while not taking\nup space as a white person. It was hard to center and decenter whiteness at\nthe same time.\n\nA woman from San Francisco had started crying before she even began speaking.\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m a racist. I\u2019m here because my body has a trauma response\nto my own whiteness and other people\u2019s whiteness.\u201d A woman who loved her cats\nwas struggling with \u201chow to understand all the atrocities of being a white\nbody.\u201d Knowing that her very existence perpetuated whiteness made her feel\nlike a drag on society. \u201cThe darkest place I go is thinking it would be better\nif I weren\u2019t here. It would at least be one less person perpetuating these\nthings.\u201d\n\nThe next day we heard from DiAngelo herself. Quinn introduced her as\n\u201ctransformative for white-bodied people across the world.\u201d DiAngelo is quite\npretty, and wore a mock turtleneck and black rectangular glasses. She started\nby telling us that she would use the term people of color, but also that some\npeople of color found the term upsetting. She would therefore vary the terms\nshe used, rotating through imperfect language. Sometimes people of color,\nother times racialized, to indicate that race is not innate and rather is\nsomething that has been done to someone. Sometimes she would use the acronym\nBIPOC (Black, Indigenous, people of color), but she would then make a\nconscious grammatical mistake: \u201cIf I say \u2018BIPOC,\u2019 I find that\u2019s a kind of\nharsh acronym. I usually add people at the end to humanize it a bit, even\nthough grammatically that\u2019s not correct,\u201d she said.\n\nLanguage is a tricky thing for the movement. The idea is that you should be\nopen and raw when you speak, but you can get so much wrong. It\u2019s no wonder\nthat even Robin DiAngelo herself is worried. (At one point she recommended a\nbook by Reni Eddo-Lodge\u2014\u201ca Black Brit,\u201d DiAngelo said. For a moment she looked\nscared. \u201cI hope that\u2019s not an offensive term.\u201d Quinn chimed in to say she\nthought it was okay, but DiAngelo looked introspective. \u201cIt sounds harsh. The\nBrit part sounded harsh.\u201d)\n\nDiAngelo wanted to remind us that she is white. She emphasized the wh\u2014, giving\nthe word a lushness and intensity. \u201cI\u2019m very clear today that I am white, that\nI have a white worldview. I have a white frame of reference. I move through\nthe world with a white experience.\u201d\n\nShe introduced some challenges. First was white people\u2019s \u201clack of humility\u201d:\n\u201cIf you are white and you have not devoted years, years\u2014not that you read some\nbooks last summer\u2014to sustained study, struggle, and work and practice and\nmistake making and relationship building, your opinions while you have them\nare necessarily uninformed and superficial.\u201d\n\n\u201cChallenge No. 2 is the precious ideology of individualism, the idea that\nevery one of us is unique and special.\u201d\n\nShe prepared us for what would come next: \u201cI will be generalizing about white\npeople.\u201d She was sharing her screen and showed us an image of middle-aged\nwhite women: \u201cThis is the classic board of a nonprofit.\u201d She threw up a\npicture of high-school students in a local paper with the headline\n\u201cOutstanding Freshmen Join Innovative Teacher-Education Program.\u201d Almost all\nthe teenagers were white. \u201cThis education program was not and could not have\nbeen innovative. Our educational system is probably one of the most efficient,\neffective mechanisms for the reproduction of racial inequality.\u201d Lingering on\nthe picture, she asked, \u201cDo you feel the weight of that whiteness?\u201d\n\nFrom the September 2021 issue: Robin DiAngelo and the problem with anti-racist\nself-help\n\nAnother image. It was a white man. \u201cI don\u2019t know who that is,\u201d she said. \u201cI\njust Googled white guy, but most white people live segregated lives.\u201d\n\nWhen someone calls a white person out as racist, she told us, the white person\nwill typically deny it. \u201cDenying, arguing, withdrawing, crying. \u2018I don\u2019t\nunderstand.\u2019 Seeking forgiveness. \u2018I feel so bad, I feel so bad. Tell me you\nstill love me.\u2019\u201d She paused. \u201cEmotions are political. We need to build our\nstamina to endure some shame, some guilt,\u201d she said. Quinn broke in to say\nthat intentions are the province of the privileged. But consequences are the\nprovince of the subjugated.\n\nSomeone who has integrated an anti-racist perspective, DiAngelo told us,\nshould be able to say: \u201cI hold awareness of my whiteness in all settings, and\nit guides how I engage. I raise issues about racism over and over, both in\npublic and in private ... You want to go watch a movie with me? You\u2019re going\nto get my analysis of how racism played in that movie. I have personal\nrelationships and know the private lives of a range of people of color,\nincluding Black people. And there are also people of color in my life who I\nspecifically ask to coach me, and I pay them for their time.\u201d\n\nI was surprised by this idea that I should pay Black friends and acquaintances\nby the hour to tutor me\u2014it sounded a little offensive. But then I considered\nthat if someone wanted me to come to their house and talk with them about\ntheir latent feelings of homophobia, I wouldn\u2019t mind being Venmoed afterward.\n\nWhen DiAngelo was done, Quinn asked if we had questions. Very few people did,\nand that was disappointing\u2014the fact that white bodies had nothing to say about\na profound presentation. Silence and self-consciousness were part of the\nproblem. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are on the line. This is life or death for bodies of\nculture.\u201d We needed to work on handling criticism. If it made you shake, that\nwas good.\n\nOne of the few men in the group said he felt uncomfortable being told to\nidentify as a racist. Here he\u2019d just been talking with all of his friends\nabout not being racist. Now he was going to \u201csay that I might have been wrong\nhere.\u201d He noticed he felt \u201cresistance to saying \u2018I\u2019m racist.\u2019\u201d\n\nQuinn understood; that was normal. He just needed to try again, say \u201cI am a\nracist\u201d and believe it. The man said: \u201cI am racist.\u201d What did he feel? He said\nhe was trying not to fight it. Say it again. \u201cI am racist.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you feel sadness or grief?\u201d\n\n\u201cSadness and grief feel true,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nSome members of the group were having a breakthrough. Stacy said she was\n\u201cseeing them finally ... Like, wow, are there moments when this white body\nchooses to see a body of culture when it isn\u2019t dangerous for them?\u201d One woman\nrealized she was \u201ca walking, talking node of white supremacy.\u201d Another finally\nsaw how vast whiteness was: \u201cSo vast and so, so big.\u201d\n\nFor a while, a dinner series called Race to Dinner for white women to talk\nabout their racism was very popular, though now it seems a little try-hard.\nThe hosts\u2014Saira Rao and Regina Jackson\u2014encourage women who have paid up to\n$625 a head to abandon any notion that they are not racist. At one point Rao,\nwho is Indian American, and Jackson, who is Black, publicized the dinners with\na simple message: \u201cDear white women: You cause immeasurable pain and damage to\nBlack, Indigenous and brown women. We are here to sit down with you to\ncandidly discuss how *exactly* you cause this pain and damage.\u201d\n\nOne could also attend a workshop called \u201cWhat\u2019s Up With White Women? Unpacking\nSexism and White Privilege Over Lunch,\u201d hosted by the authors of What\u2019s Up\nWith White Women? Unpacking Sexism and White Privilege in Pursuit of Racial\nJustice (the authors are two white women). Or you could go to \u201cFinding\nFreedom: White Women Taking On Our Own White Supremacy,\u201d hosted by We Are\nFinding Freedom (a for-profit run by two white women). The National\nAssociation of Social Workers\u2019 New York City chapter advertised a workshop\ncalled \u201cBuilding White Women\u2019s Capacity to Do Anti-racism Work\u201d (hosted by the\nfounder of U Power Change, who is a white woman).\n\nSo many of the workshops have been run by and aimed at white women. White\nwomen specifically seem very interested in these courses, perhaps because\nself-flagellation is seen as a classic female virtue. The hated archetype of\nthe anti-racist movement is the Karen. No real equivalent exists for men.\nMaybe the heavily armed prepper comes close, but he\u2019s not quite the same, in\nthat a Karen is someone you\u2019ll run into in a coffee shop, and a Karen is also\nsomeone who is disgusted with herself. Where another generation of white women\nworked to hate their bodies, my generation hates its \u201cwhiteness\u201d (and I don\u2019t\nmean skin color, necessarily, as this can also be your internalized\nwhiteness). People are always demanding that women apologize for something and\nwomen seem to love doing it. Women will pay for the opportunity. We\u2019ll thank\nyou for it.\n\nTyler Austin Harper: I\u2019m a black professor. You don\u2019t need to bring that up.\n\nAfter DiAngelo, I went to another course, \u201cFoundations in Somatic\nAbolitionism.\u201d That one was more about what my white flesh itself means and\nhow to physically manifest anti-racism\u2014\u201cembodying anti-racism.\u201d Those sessions\nwere co-led by Resmaa Menakem, a therapist and the author of My Grandmother\u2019s\nHands: Racialized Trauma and the Pathway to Mending Our Hearts and Bodies.\n\nMenakem stressed how important it was not to do his exercises with people of\ncolor, because it would wound them: \u201cDo not have bodies of culture in a group\nof white bodies. White bodies with white bodies and bodies of culture with\nbodies of culture.\u201d\n\nThe harm caused by processing your whiteness with a person of color had also\nbeen stressed in the previous course\u2014the book DiAngelo had recommended by Reni\nEddo-Lodge was called Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race.\nBut at the same time, Quinn had said that we should talk with people of\ndifferent races about our journey and let them guide us. It all seemed a bit\ncontradictory.\n\nOne participant had a question for Menakem about community building. She was\nconcerned because she had a mixed-race group of friends, and she wanted to be\nsure she wasn\u2019t harming her Black friends by talking about this work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to be able to keep Black women safe,\u201d Menakem\nsaid. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about race, if race is part of the discussion, those\nBlack women are going to get injured in the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my worry,\u201d she said. The problem was that she and her friends were\nactually already in \u201clike, an anti-racism study group.\u201d Menakem was\ndefinitive: \u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want white folks gazing at that\nprocess.\u201d\n\nA few years have passed since I was in these workshops, and I wonder if the\nother participants are \u201cbetter\u201d white people now. What would that even mean,\nexactly? Getting outside their ethnic tribe\u2014or the opposite?\n\nAt one point Menakem intoned, \u201cAll white bodies cause racialized stress and\nwounding to bodies of culture. Everybody say it. \u2018All white bodies cause\nracialized stress and wounding to bodies of culture.\u2019\u201d We said it, over and\nover again. I collapsed into it, thinking: I am careless; I am selfish; I do\ncause harm. The more we said it, the more it started to feel like a release.\nIt felt so sad. But it also\u2014and this seemed like a problem\u2014felt good.\n\nWhat if fighting for justice could just be a years-long confessional process\nand didn\u2019t require doing anything tangible at all? What if I could defeat\nwhite supremacy from my lovely living room, over tea, with other white people?\nPersonally I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works. I\u2019m not sold. But maybe my\nwhiteness has blinded me. The course wrapped up, and Menakem invited us all to\nan upcoming two-day workshop.\n\nThis essay is adapted from the forthcoming book, Morning After the Revolution:\nDispatches from the Wrong Side of History.\n\nMorning After The Revolution: Dispatches From The Wrong Side Of History\n\nBy Nellie Bowles\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
