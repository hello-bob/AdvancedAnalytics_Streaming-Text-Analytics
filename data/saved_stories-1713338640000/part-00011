The business model then\nwas an SAP consulting organisation, filling a niche position between the\nBusiness and IT teams. Hence, the company name is Integrating Systems and\nBusiness.\n\nIn 2005, we pivoted, becoming an SAP reseller and focusing on the\nenvironmental and waste management sector.\n\nI was brought into ISB Global to grow the consulting side of the business, and\nwhen I joined in 2015, we were a close-knit team of 13 people. We have since\nscaled our teams substantially. We had 14 clients on the books at the time,\nall of which were SMEs, and whilst boasting modest revenues back in 2015, we\nhave 6X our revenues since then.\n\n## Tell me about the business \u2013 what it is, what it aims to achieve, who you\nwork with, how you reach customers and so on?\n\nISB Global develops and implements our software, Waste & Recycling One (WR1),\nwhich integrates, automates and simplifies to drive greater operational\nefficiency and profitability for organisations operating in the waste,\nrecycling, clean energy, and environmental sectors. We are committed to making\na significant difference globally in how the world deals with waste and\nrecyclable materials.\n\nWe seek to deliver greater productivity for organisations by implementing a\nsuite of integrated cloud software platforms from leading software vendors\nwith a team of industry and software technology experts.\n\nThe benefits of our software solution span the entire business process,\nincluding accuracy, profitability, cost control, sustainable operations,\ncustomer service and competitive advantage. We are creating clean, efficient\noperations that contribute positively to the environment and changing economy.\n\nWe work with businesses of varying sizes that operate in the waste, recycling,\nclean energy, and environmental sectors, and we reach those businesses in\nvarious ways. We knew early on that it was not enough just to be a \u2018tech\u2019\nbusiness like many others; we needed to be immersed in the sector, attend\ntrade events, show thought leadership, and be present where our customers are,\nwhich is what we look to do with our commercial efforts.\n\n## How has the business evolved since you joined?\n\nThe business has learnt a lot about the waste sector since 2005 and pre-2015.\nMany environmental, waste and recycling companies would rather employ more\nstaff or buy another truck than invest in software, but we can see the market\nslowly changing.\n\nI joined shortly before the onset of BREXIT in 2016; we felt we had to spread\nour marketing efforts and looked towards larger businesses and, more\nspecifically, into the US. We had some outstanding success then in 2019 with a\nlarge US Waste Haulage and Recycling Company. From there, we embarked on an\nambitious project to re-write our existing software onto a new Low Code\nplatform, giving us the scale, security, and brilliant user experience the\nsector demanded.\n\nThis project has set us apart from our core competitors, who continue to re-\ndesign and de-develop their legacy systems, creating more technical debt in\ntheir products, hampering their support organisations, and frustrating their\ncustomers.\n\nTo date, we have invested over \u00a315M in this project, with the major launch of\nthe Rumpke and WastePro USA application in 2023. This has all been organically\nfunded.\n\n## Tell us about the working culture at ISB Global\n\nThe committed individuals working at ISB Global are much more than employees;\nthey are a close-knit team of eco-warriors. It\u2019s vital that we create and\nenable a culture that ensures people feel part of the family and part of the\nmission. The team and I have a long way to go in doing our bit for the planet,\nand we take great strength in being in it together.\n\nWe have grown rapidly and are conscious of the challenges that come with that,\nand so to support this growth, we have been successful in our application to\nan Innovate UK Edge Scaleup Program, which started in January 2022. A key\nfocus of the program has been to address Organisational Change, covering the\nrapid changes in employment needs, particularly after COVID. During the year,\nthere were several significant projects to scale up our employee programmes,\nincluding revamping the review system, conducting culture surveys to assess\nhow people felt about working at ISB, and implementing new benefits structures\nto ensure we were doing everything possible to look after our people.\n\nWe encourage flexibility in our team\u2019s day-to-day lives and aim to be as\naccommodating as possible to the individual needs of our people.\n\n## How are you funded?\n\n100% self-funded.\n\n## What has been your biggest challenge so far and how have you overcome this?\n\nThe biggest challenge has been truly understanding the waste industry and all\nof its nuances. To provide the most advanced software in the sector, it\u2019s\ncritical that we understand it better than anyone. We overcame this with the\nhelp of our incredibly knowledgeable team, many of whom came from backgrounds\nworking in the waste sector, and the strong relationship with our customers,\nwho helped teach me invaluable things about the industry sub-verticals in\nwhich they operate.\n\n## How does ISB Global answer an unmet need?\n\nWith the constant changing of environmental regulations and legislation, there\nis a continued need for compliance and management of environmental information\nand data.\n\nISB Global provides the only fully integrated software in the sector with\nintegration all the way through to finance. The results are one source of\ntruth and the ability to use accurate real-time information for organisations\nutilising the software.\n\n## What\u2019s in store for the future?\n\nThe world is waking up to waste, and we want to remain at the forefront of\ndriving the needed change. There is finally a worldwide focus now on poor\nwaste management practices. A lot of discussions were held at COP26 and again\nat COP27 and 28. These conferences align with the Paris Agreement\u2019s terms,\nwhereby Global Warming should be no more than 1.5%. It\u2019s recognised that\nimproving waste management practices towards the circular economy and net zero\ncan significantly positively contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nISB\u2019s part of helping the planet meet global targets is through technology,\nand we are incredibly proud of the products we have built to date. Waste &\nRecycling One sits in the crosshairs between environmental and economic\nprogress.\n\nTo ensure we are ready to meet the challenge, we are doubling down on\nspecialism in our sectors and commitment to our mission.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2023, we have increased our personnel by 350% (from 30 to 130)\nand our revenue from 2mil GBP to 8mil GBP, with forecasted revenue growth of\n20% year on year.\n\nWe have developed locations in Cape Town, North America, Portugal, and a\ncentre of excellence in Lahore, Pakistan. In Cape Town and Lahore, we have\nacquired our own offices to secure our tenure and highlight our commitment to\ngrowth, particularly in Lahore. In West London, we have doubled our office\nspace to accommodate the much larger team (on a hybrid basis).\n\n## What one piece of advice would you give other business leaders?\n\nLimitations are self-imposed, so think outside the box. The tech landscape is\nconstantly evolving, offering endless possibilities. Don\u2019t be confined by\ntraditional thinking. Embrace bold ideas and challenge assumptions to discover\ngroundbreaking solutions.\n\n## And finally, a more personal question! What\u2019s your daily routine and the\nrules you\u2019re living by at the moment?\n\nMy typical day has a 5am start and begins with a double espresso and workout\nin the gym, followed by meditation and breakfast with the family. Then it\u2019s\ninto the working day, ensuring our teams have everything they need to succeed\nthat day and that our customers are happy. I focus on maintaining a positive\nattitude and outlook to all challenges that come my way and pass this on to my\nteam, too.\n\nA positive attitude is contagious; don\u2019t wait to catch it\u2014be the carrier. As a\nhusband and father and the leader of a thriving commercial team, there is a\nlot to pack in, but I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world.\n\nPritesh Pattni is Chief Commercial Officer at ISB Global.\n\nArticle by Pritesh Pattni\n\nSHARE\n\nREPORT AN ERROR DOWNLOAD PDF / EXPORT\n\nNewsletter\n\nSign up\n\nRelated articles\n\nPortfolio By Steve Hearsum\n\n16 April 2024\n\n\u2018Why pressure to be a \u201chero leader\u201d is holding you back and what you can do\nabout it\u2019\n\nPortfolio By Paul Yewman & Keith Lewin\n\n16 April 2024\n\nMeet PostTag, making deliveries easier, faster and more sustainable\n\nPortfolio By Jia-Lin Yong\n\n15 April 2024\n\nDelivering positive systemic change, a profile of Giant\n\nThank you,\n\nNewsletter\n\nno spam, pinky promise\n\nThank you,\n\nyou're all set, keep an eye on your inbox for all the latest news\n\nThank you,\n\nGet in touch\n\nMaddyness \u00a92021\n\nLegal\n\nMedia\n\n  * Articles\n  * Verticals\n  * Calendar\n\nMaddyTalent\n\n  * MaddyJobs\n  * MaddyTalent\n\nAbout\n\n  * About\n  * Contact us\n  * Submit an article\n  * Legal\n\nFR Edition MaddyPlay MaddyStudio MaddyEvent MaddyShop MaddyJobs\n\nMaddyness\n\n", "frontpage": false}
