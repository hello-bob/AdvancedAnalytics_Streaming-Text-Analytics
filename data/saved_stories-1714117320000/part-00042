With the\nrelease of our initial Llama 3 models, we wanted to kickstart the next wave of\ninnovation in AI across the stack\u2014from applications to developer tools to\nevals to inference optimizations and more, and we\u2019re already seeing amazing\nthings. From projects that have doubled Llama 3\u2019s context window, to work on\nquantization, web navigation, tool use, low precision fine tuning, local\ndeployment, and so much more, the reception from the community has been\ntremendous.\n\nSince our launch last Thursday, the models have been downloaded over 1.2\nmillion times, with developers sharing over 600 derivative models on Hugging\nFace. The Llama 3 GitHub repo has already passed 17,000 stars, and Llama 3 70B\nInstruct is tied for first for English-only evals on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena\nLeaderboard, and sits at six overall making it the highest ranked openly\navailable model, just behind closed proprietary models.\n\nOur partners across silicon, hardware, and cloud providers have begun to\ndeploy Llama 3 to their users, and we\u2019ve seen the community quickly fine-tune\nLlama 3 for their individual needs. For example, at Yale\u2019s School of Medicine,\nteams alongside the EPFL School of Computer and Communication Sciences fine-\ntuned Meta Llama 3 within 24 hours of release, introducing\nLlama-3[8B]-MeditronV1.0\u2014the first fine-tuned Llama 3 8B for medicine. This\nnew model outperforms all state-of-the-art open models within its parameter\nclass on standard benchmarks such as MedQA and MedMCQA. You can read more\nabout how Yale and the EPFL built their first version of Meditron on top of\nLlama 2 here.\n\nAs we shared at launch, this is just the beginning for Llama 3. Over the\ncoming months, we\u2019ll release models with new capabilities including\nmultimodality, the ability to converse in multiple languages, a longer context\nwindow, and enhanced overall capabilities. We\u2019re excited to share more soon\nand see the next-wave of community-driven innovation.\n\nShare:\n\nOur latest updates delivered to your inbox\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to keep up with Meta AI news, events, research\nbreakthroughs, and more.\n\nJoin us in the pursuit of what\u2019s possible with AI.\n\nSee all open positions\n\nRelated Posts\n\nIntroducing Meta Llama 3: The most capable openly available LLM to date\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nRead post\n\nMeditron: An LLM suite for low-resource medical settings leveraging Meta Llama\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nRead post\n\nOur responsible approach to Meta AI and Meta Llama 3\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nRead post\n\nOur approach\n\nAbout AI at Meta\n\nResponsibility\n\nPeople\n\nCareers\n\nResearch\n\nInfrastructure\n\nResources\n\nDemos\n\nProduct experiences\n\nMeta AI\n\nLatest news\n\nBlog\n\nNewsletter\n\nFoundational models\n\nMeta Llama\n\nOur approach\n\nOur approachAbout AI at MetaResponsibilityPeopleCareers\n\nResearch\n\nResearchInfrastructureResourcesDemos\n\nProduct experiences\n\nMeta AI\n\nLatest news\n\nLatest newsBlogNewsletter\n\nFoundational models\n\nMeta Llama\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms\n\nCookies\n\nMeta \u00a9 2024\n\nAllow the use of cookies from Meta on this browser?\n\nWe use essential cookies and similar technologies to help:\n\nProvide and improve content on Meta Products\n\nProvide a safer experience by using information we receive from cookies on and\noff Meta Products\n\nProvide and improve Meta Company Products for people using a Meta or Oculus\naccount\n\nWe use tools on Meta from other companies that also use cookies.
