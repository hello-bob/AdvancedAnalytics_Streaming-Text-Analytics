Is Nikola Tesla\nthe True Father of Radio? What Was the Wardenclyffe Tower? What Happened to\nTesla\u2019s Death Ray? Was Tesla Motors Named For Nikola Tesla? How Did Nikola\nTesla Change the World?\n\nOften called eccentric in his time, Nikola Tesla was a controversial figure\nwho died alone, penniless, and largely forgotten.\n\nToday, Nikola Tesla is recognized as one of the fathers of modern electricity.\nHis contributions to the science of energy rival those of his chief\ncompetitor, Thomas Edison. An energy visionary, Nikola Tesla laid the\ngroundwork for the electricity generation and delivery systems that we know\ntoday.\n\nNikola Tesla once said, \u201cIf you want to find the secrets of the universe,\nthink in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration.\u201d As we look at his life\nand work, we\u2019ll see that he did just that.\n\n## Who Was Nikola Tesla?\n\nBorn in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia (formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire), Serbian-American Nikola Tesla was one of history\u2019s important\ninventors. His work with electricity was well ahead of his time; as a result,\nhe was often ridiculed. However, his inventions and thinking continue to\ninfluence modern technology.\n\nTesla\u2019s father was a Serbian Orthodox priest, writer, and poet. His mother,\nwho had no formal education, was an inventor herself. Among other things, she\ninvented a mechanical eggbeater. Tesla credited his mother\u2019s interests in\nmachinery as inspiration for his investigations.\n\nTesla was determined to become an engineer despite his father\u2019s insistence on\nthe priesthood. While Tesla was sick with cholera, he extracted a promise from\nhis father \u2014 if Tesla survived his illness, he could attend the Austrian\nPolytechnic School at Graz, Austria, to study engineering. Upon his return to\nhealth, Tesla enrolled at the Polytechnic School, where he studied\nmathematics, physics, and mechanics. That was followed by two years at the\nUniversity of Prague studying philosophy.\n\nWhile working at the Central Telegraph Office in Budapest, Tesla began\ndeveloping the principles of rotating magnetic fields. His work, which formed\nthe basis of his later inventions and discoveries, is still used today in\nelectromechanical devices, such as asynchronous induction motors.\n\nFollowing his arrival in New York City in 1884, Nikola Tesla worked with\nThomas Edison at Edison Electric Light Company, best known today as General\nElectric. The relationship between Tesla and Edison was complicated by their\nvery different personalities, interests, and approaches to inventing.\n\nTesla left his partnership with Edison over a contract dispute. In 1885, Tesla\nopened his own lab, Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company. There, he\nexperimented with several ideas: perfecting arc lamps, early X-rays, and\nelectrical resonance. He also continued his work with polyphase alternating\ncurrent.\n\nThroughout his life, Tesla would live and work in Manhattan. He held more than\n300 patents that laid the groundwork for the way we generate and use\nelectricity today. He died alone at the New Yorker hotel in 1943.\n\n## Did Thomas Edison or Nikola Tesla Invent Electricity?\n\nElectricity is a natural phenomenon that neither Tesla nor Edison invented.\nHowever, both made significant contributions to how we understand and use\nelectricity. For example, Nikola Tesla\u2018s ideas about electricity and how it\nworks led him to develop the polyphase alternating current system that we use\nin our homes today.\n\n## How Many Patents Did Nikola Tesla Hold?\n\nGlobally, Tesla held more than 300 patents. In addition to his 112 U.S.\npatents, Tesla\u2019s patents totaled 192 in 26 other countries. Because of the\nterritorial limitations of patents, many were for the same invention.\n\nHowever, a review of those patents shows that Tesla had 126 basic patents. A\nbasic patent is the first one registered for a design or invention. Those\nbasic patents protected 125 of Tesla\u2019s inventions.\n\n## What Was the War of the Currents?\n\nsource\n\nEdison, who developed and advocated for direct current electricity, had a\nvirtual monopoly on electricity in New York. But there was such demand for\nelectricity that the likes of J.P. Morgan rushed to have his home wired for\nelectricity.\n\nHowever, direct current had its drawbacks. The primary problem for Edison was\none of transmission; it\u2019s challenging to transmit direct current voltage over\nenough distance to be effective. In addition, direct current voltage can\u2019t be\neasily stepped up or down, making it impractical for electrical appliances. It\nwas also expensive and dangerous.\n\nTesla\u2019s work with alternating current virtually guaranteed that he and Edison\nwould clash. Tesla believed alternating current was more effective for\neveryday use.\n\nIn 1888, Tesla delivered his groundbreaking paper, \u201cA New System of\nAlternating Current Motors and Transformers,\u201d to the American Institute of\nElectrical Engineers. His paper attracted the attention of George\nWestinghouse, an American inventor and industrialist. Westinghouse visited\nTesla\u2019s lab where Tesla had built a large model electrical generation and\ntransmission system that powered an AC motor. Impressed by what he saw,\nWestinghouse bought Tesla\u2019s work.\n\nThe pair went on to light the Chicago World Fair in 1893, also known as the\nWorld\u2019s Columbian Exposition. President Grover Cleveland turned on the lights\nwith a press of the button. Called the Illuminated City, the dramatic\nspectacle of 100,000 incandescent lamps served as an example of alternating\ncurrent\u2018s power to change the world.\n\nThe War of the Currents ended at Niagra Falls, where Tesla and Westinghouse\nachieved Tesla\u2019s long-held dream of harnessing the falls. Westinghouse won the\ncontract to build the world\u2019s first hydroelectric power plant using Nikola\nTesla\u2018s water turbines and system of polyphase alternating current. In\nNovember 1896, the power plant transmitted electricity to Buffalo, New York,\nand, eventually, to New York City.\n\n## What Is a Tesla Coil?\n\nDreaming of wireless electrical transmission, Nikola Tesla developed his now-\nfamous coil in Manhattan in 1891. The Tesla coil was the first electrical\nsystem to use wireless transmission. Telephone circuits, radio antennas, and\nlighting systems used the Tesla coil.\n\nA simple idea using resonance and electromagnetic force, the Tesla coil has a\nprimary and secondary coil, each with its own capacitor. The rings are open\nelectrical circuits connected by a spark gap, essentially open-air space\nbetween the coils.\n\nEssentially an air-core transformer, the Tesla coil works as a step-up\ntransformer. So not only does it generate high-voltage electricity, but it\nalso creates very high-frequency electricity. High-frequency AC has advantages\nwhen size or weight is considered, and HFAC has implications for parallel\npower generation applications.\n\n## What Did Nikola Tesla Do In Colorado Springs?\n\nIn 1899, Tesla moved to Colorado Springs to investigate his ideas about\nwireless transmission at high altitudes. There, on the prairie, Tesla\nconstructed an 80-foot wooden tower, topped by a 142-foot metal mast with a\ncopper ball on top.\n\nThrough his work at the Tesla Experimental Station, he hoped to transmit\nwireless power over long distances with sufficient capacity for industrial\napplications. The tower at Colorado Springs was a forerunner of his later\nbuilding at Wardenclyffe.\n\nIn addition, it was at Colorado Springs that Tesla correctly calculated the\nresonant frequency between the Earth\u2019s surface and the ionosphere at 8 hertz.\nIt\u2019s also widely believed that he may have been the first to detect radio\nwaves from space.\n\n## Is Nikola Tesla the True Father of Radio?\n\nTesla worked with radio waves and filed the United States\u2019 first radio patent\nin 1897. Later, he introduced a remote control boat at a Madison Square Garden\nelectrical exhibition, which serves as the precursor to today\u2019s modern remote\ncontrols. Tesla continued his work with radio waves, eventually receiving more\nthan a dozen patents related to radio wave technology.\n\nIn the meantime, Guglielmo Marconi was also working on radio. However, the\nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office turned down his patent application in 1900\nbecause of Tesla\u2019s prior patents. About Marconi\u2019s first successful radio\ntransmission on December 12, 1901, Tesla said, \u201cMarconi is a good fellow. Let\nhim continue. He is using 17 of my patents.\u201d The patent office reversed itself\nin 1904, awarding Marconi\u2019s patents retroactively.\n\nDespite Tesla\u2019s apparently complacent response, he sued the Marconi Company\nfor infringement. The decades-long lawsuit was eventually decided in 1943 when\nthe U.S. Supreme Court overturned Marconi\u2019s patent. But unfortunately, the\nreversal came too late; Tesla had died a few months before the decision.\n\n## What Was the Wardenclyffe Tower?\n\nTesla proposed a prototype tower that would wirelessly transmit power, a long\nheld dream.\n\nTesla\u2019s ideas about wireless transmission caught the interest of financier\nJ.P. Morgan, who invested $150,000 (roughly $4 million in today\u2019s dollars).\nWith Morgan\u2019s financial backing, Tesla began constructing a 187-foot wooden\ntower and telecommunications station at Wardenclyffe near Shoreham, Long\nIsland.\n\nWith Marconi\u2019s successful wireless transmission, Morgan began to doubt that\nTesla\u2019s ideas were worth the expense. Morgan refused further funding. With his\nfailure to find financial backers, together with the stock market crash and\nensuing Depression, Tesla finally had to abandon the project in 1905.\n\nToday, Wardenclyffe is the site of the Tesla Science Center, one of several\nTesla museums that commemorate Tesla\u2019s groundbreaking work in power\ntransmission.\n\n## What Happened to Tesla\u2019s Death Ray?\n\nsource\n\nPopularly called a death ray, Nikola Tesla conceived his idea as a war-ending\ntechnology. With another world war on the horizon in 1937, Tesla sent \u201cNew Art\nof Projecting Concentrated Non-Dispersive Energy Through Natural Media\u201d to the\nU.S. government and several of its allies, including the Soviet Union.\n\nThe highly technical paper outlined Tesla\u2019s proposal for what is now called a\ncharged particle beam. The most unique feature was the vacuum chamber. Tesla\ndesigned the apparatus to have one end of the device open to the atmosphere.\n\nA high-velocity air stream directed at the device\u2019s tip sealed the vacuum. It\nwas all powered by a Tesla turbine.\n\nImmediately following his death, the FBI seized the contents of his hotel\nroom, even though Tesla\u2019s journal and some technical reports had already\ndisappeared. Some papers ended up at Patterson Air Force Base, where the\nmilitary conducted experiments \u2013 the results of which have never been\nreleased.\n\nIn 1952, Tesla\u2019s nephew, Sava Kosanovic, received Tesla\u2019s remaining papers and\npossessions and returned to Belgrade. As a result, a Tesla museum was\nestablished there.\n\nWhile Western scientists had limited access to the papers, their Soviet\ncounterparts had free access under Tito\u2019s communist regime. Eight years later,\nin 1960, Nikita Khruschev announced a startling new (but undisclosed) weapon\nwas in the \u201chatching stage.\u201d\n\nDespite the military interest of the American and Soviet governments, Tesla\u2019s\nbeam has failed to become a reality. Some could say that his dream of peace\ndied with him. Without the inventor\u2019s genius to guide research experiments,\nhis vision failed to come to fruition.\n\n## Was Tesla Motors Named For Nikola Tesla?\n\nSome reports credit Nikola Tesla with inventing the battery-less electric car\nin 1931. As the story goes, he converted a Pierce-Arrow in Buffalo, New York.\nIn place of the gas-powered combustion engine was an AC electric motor. The\nreport, for which there is no hard evidence, gains credence based on the\ninventor\u2019s work with wireless electrical transmission at Wardenclyffe.\n\nRegardless of the truth, Tesla Motors founders Martin Eberhard and Marc\nTarpenning (Elon Musk joined the company later as CEO) chose to honor the work\nof Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla by naming their electric car company\nTesla Inc., after him.\n\n## How Did Nikola Tesla Change the World?\n\nBefore he died, Nikola Tesla had dozens of inventions to his credit. In a few\nways, he was a man ahead of his time despite living during the Gilded Age,\nwhich was a period of incredible invention.\n\nAn electrical engineer by training and an inventor by nature, Nikola Tesla was\nalso a philosopher. His vision of how the universe works inspired his quest to\nharness electricity to change the world. His work with AC power and AC\nsystems, the Tesla coil, and AC motors gave us the electric power we know and\nuse today. The next time you\u2019re looking for an electricity company or using\nyour remote control, you can remember that Tesla had something to do with it.\n\nBrought to you by justenergy.com\n\nAll images licensed from Adobe Stock.
