The film tells the story of Alex Rogan (Lance Guest), a teenager\nrecruited by an alien defense force to fight in an interstellar war. It also\nfeatures Robert Preston, Dan O'Herlihy, Catherine Mary Stewart, Norman Snow,\nand Kay E. Kuter.\n\nThe Last Starfighter, along with Disney's Tron, has the distinction of being\none of cinema's earliest films to use extensive \"real-life\" computer-generated\nimagery (CGI) to depict its many starships, environments, and battle scenes.\n\nThe Last Starfighter was Robert Preston's final role in a theatrical film. The\ncharacter of Centauri, a \"lovable con-man\", was written with him in mind and\nwas a nod to his most famous role as Professor Harold Hill in The Music\nMan.^[2]\n\nThere was a subsequent novelization of the film by Alan Dean Foster, as well\nas a video game based on the production. In 2004, it was also adapted as an\noff-Broadway musical.\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\nAlex Rogan is a teenager living in a trailer park with his mother and younger\nbrother, Louis. After being rejected for a scholarship, Alex becomes angry at\nhis go-nowhere existence. The only entertainment in the trailer park comes\nfrom an arcade game called \"Starfighter\", in which the player defends \"the\nFrontier\" against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada in a space battle. After Alex\nbecomes the game's highest-scoring player, he is approached by the game's\ninventor, Centauri, who invites him to take a ride in his fancy car as a prize\nfor winning the game. Centauri is actually an alien and his car a spacecraft;\nAlex is essentially abducted, and Beta, a doppelg\u00e4nger android, is used to\ncover Alex's absence.\n\nAlex learns that the Starfighter arcade game represents a real-life conflict\nbetween the Rylan Star League and the Ko-Dan Empire; the latter is led by Xur,\na native Rylan traitor and son of Ambassador Enduran, the Starfighter\ncommander, to whom the Ko-Dan Emperor has promised control of Rylos.\nStarfighter is, in fact, an elaborate recruiting tool, designed as a test to\nfind those \"with the gift\" (Centauri is actually criticized in one scene for\nplacing the game on Earth, as humans were not considered capable of becoming\nStarfighters). Alex, expected to be the gunner for a Starfighter spacecraft\ncalled the Gunstar, is partnered with a reptilian pilot named Grig. He also\nlearns that the Frontier is a forcefield protecting Rylos and its surrounding\nplanets from invasion; Xur has given the Ko-Dan the means to breach it.\n\nXur reveals he has discovered an infiltrator in his ranks and broadcasts the\nspy's execution to the Star League. He then proclaims that once Rylos' moon is\nin eclipse, the Ko-Dan Armada will begin their invasion. Unnerved by\neverything he has seen, Alex asks to be taken home. On Earth, Centauri tells\nAlex to contact him should he change his mind. Meanwhile, a saboteur\neliminates the Starfighter base defenses and thus enables the Ko-Dan to attack\nthe base, causing heavy damage, killing the Starfighters and destroying the\nGunstars. Only Grig and an advanced prototype Gunstar survive.\n\nAlex discovers Beta and contacts Centauri to retrieve him. Centauri arrives\njust as Alex and Beta are attacked by an alien assassin, a Zando-Zan, in Xur's\nservice; Centauri shoots off its right arm. He then explains that more Zando-\nZan will be coming to Earth, and the only way for Alex to protect his family\n(and Earth) is to embrace his ability as a Starfighter. Before Alex can reply,\nthe assassin attempts to shoot Alex. Centauri jumps in the way, taking the hit\nand killing the alien. Alex and Centauri fly back to the Starfighter base,\nwhere Centauri succumbs to his injuries. Alex finds Grig, and they prepare the\nGunstar to battle the Ko-Dan Armada.\n\nWhile Grig trains Alex, Beta finds it difficult to maintain his impersonation,\nparticularly with Maggie Gordon, Alex's girlfriend. After discovering that a\ngroup of Zando-Zan have set up a communication center from their spaceship\noutside the trailer park, Beta reveals everything to Maggie. She does not\nbelieve him until the Zando-Zan discover the pair and Beta is shot, exposing\ndamaged circuitry. They steal a friend's pickup truck and charge it at the\nZando-Zan ship; Beta has Maggie jump out before sacrificing himself by\ncrashing into the ship, destroying it.\n\nAlex and Grig attack the Ko-Dan mothership, crippling its communications. Once\nAlex's weapons are depleted, he desperately activates a secret weapon on the\nGunstar, the \"Death Blossom\", that destroys the remaining Ko-Dan fighters.\nWith the fleet destroyed, Lord Kril orders Xur executed for his arrogance and\nfailure to ensure victory, but Xur escapes the mothership just before Alex\ncripples its guidance controls, causing it to crash into Rylos' moon.\n\nAlex is proclaimed the savior of Rylos and invited to help rebuild the Star\nLeague by Enduran, as it is still vulnerable: the Frontier has collapsed and\nXur escaped. An unknown alien approaches, revealing himself as Centauri and\nexplaining he was in a healing stasis. Alex agrees to stay, but he returns to\nEarth, landing his ship in the trailer park. Grig tells Alex's mother and the\npeople of the trailer park of Alex's heroism; Alex asks Maggie to come with\nhim, and she agrees. Louis is inspired to join Alex and begins playing the\nStarfighter game.\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n  * Lance Guest as Alex Rogan / Beta Alex Rogan\n  * Robert Preston as Centauri\n  * Dan O'Herlihy as Grig\n  * Catherine Mary Stewart as Maggie Gordon\n  * Norman Snow as Xur\n  * Kay E.

Pictured at the IMI-500 workstation is a simulation of the\nStarcar.\n\nThe Last Starfighter was shot in 38 days,^[3] mostly night shoots in Canyon\nCountry. It was one of the earliest films to make extensive use of computer\ngraphics for its special effects. In place of physical models, 3D rendered\nmodels were used to depict space ships and many other objects. The Gunstar and\nother spaceships were the design of artist Ron Cobb, who also worked on Dark\nStar, Alien, Star Wars and Conan the Barbarian.\n\nThe computer graphics for the film were rendered by Digital Productions (DP)\non a Cray X-MP supercomputer. The company created 27 minutes of effects for\nthe film. This was considered an enormous amount of computer generated imagery\nat the time.^[4] For the 300 scenes containing computer graphics in the film,\neach frame of the animation contained an average of 250,000 polygons and had a\nresolution of 3000 \u00d7 5000 36-bit pixels. Digital Productions estimated that\nusing computer animation required only half the time and between a third to\nhalf of the cost of traditional special effects. The result was a cost of $14\nmillion for a film that made about $29 million at the box office.^[4]\n\nDP used Fortran, CFT77 for programming:\n\n> Everything was in FORTRAN, because it was the only language with\n> vectorization when we started and remained the only language with good\n> vectorization through the life of DP.\n>\n> \u2014 email from Larry Yaeger (lead software programmer in Digital Productions)\n> (2020.03.30)\n\nNot all special effects in the film were done with computer animation. The\ndepiction of the Beta unit before it had taken Alex's form was a practical\neffect, created by makeup artist Lance Anderson. The Starcar, created by Gene\nWinfield and driven by Centauri, was a working vehicle based on Winfield's\nSpinner designs from Blade Runner.^[5]\n\nBecause the test audiences responded positively to the Beta Alex character,\ndirector Nick Castle added more scenes of Beta Alex interacting with the\ntrailer park community. Because Lance Guest had cut his hair short after\ninitial filming had been completed and he contracted an illness during the re-\nshoots, his portrayal of Beta Alex in the added scenes has him wearing a wig\nand heavy makeup. Wil Wheaton had a few lines of dialogue that were ultimately\ncut from the film, but he still is visible in the background of several\nscenes.^[5]\n\n## Music[edit]\n\nMain article: The Last Starfighter (soundtrack)\n\nComposer Craig Safan wanted to go \"bigger than Star Wars\" and therefore\nutilized a \"Mahler-sized\" orchestra, resulting in an unusual breadth of\ninstruments, including \"quadruple woodwinds\" and \"eight trumpets, [trombones],\nand horns!\"^[6]\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\nAt the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Last Starfighter\nreceived an approval rating of 76%, based on 86 reviews, with an average\nrating of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"While The Last\nStarfighter is clearly derivative of other sci-fi franchises, its boundary-\npushing visual effects and lovably plucky tone make for an appealing\nadventure\".^[7] Metacritic gave the film a score of 67 based on 8 reviews,\nindicating \"generally favorable reviews\".^[8] Over time it has developed a\ncult following.^[9]\n\nRoger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two-and-a-half out of four\nstars. While the actors were good, particularly Preston and O'Herlihy, Ebert\nwrote The Last Starfighter was \"not a terrifically original movie\" but it was\nnonetheless \"well-made\".^[10] Colin Greenland reviewed The Last Starfighter\nfor Imagine magazine, and stated that \"apart from a mildly amusing little sub-\nplot with the android replica left on Earth to conceal his absence, Alex's\nadventure is strictly the movie of the video game: simple as can be, and\npitched at a pre-teen audience who can believe Alex and Grig blasting a\nhundred alien ships and escaping without a scratch.\"^[11] Halliwell's Film\nGuide described the film as \"a surprisingly pleasant variation on the Star\nWars boom, with sharp and witty performances from two reliable character\nactors and some elegant gadgetry to offset the teenage mooning\".^[12]\n\nIn 2017, Variety described it as having \"a simple yet ingenious plot\" and\ncontinued \"the action is suitably fast and furious, but what makes the movie\nespecially enjoyable are the quirky character touches given to Guest and his\nfellow players.\" Variety also noted that film critic Gene Siskel described The\nLast Starfighter as the best of all Star Wars imitators.^[13] Alan Jones\nawarded it three stars out of five for Radio Times, writing that it was a\n\"glossy, space-age fairy tale\" and \"highly derivative \u2014 Star Trek-like aliens\nhave Star Wars-inspired dog-fights against a computer-graphic backdrop \u2014 but\nthe sensitive love story between Guest and Catherine Mary Stewart cuts through\nthe cuteness and gives the intergalactic adventures a much-needed boost.\"^[14]\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\nThe Last Starfighter's popularity has resulted in several non-film adaptations\nof the storyline and uses of the name.\n\n### Musical[edit]\n\nA musical adaptation was first produced at the Storm Theatre Off-Off Broadway\nin New York City in October 2004 with music and lyrics by Skip Kennon and book\nby Fred Landau.^[15]^[16] In November 2005, the original cast recording was\nreleased on the Kritzerland label.^[17]\n\n### Books[edit]\n\nAlan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of the film shortly after it was\nreleased (ISBN 0-425-07255-X).\n\n### Comics[edit]\n\nIn the same year as the release of the film, Marvel Comics published a comic\nbook adaptation of the film by writer Bill Mantlo and artists Bret Blevins and\nTony Salmons in Marvel Super Special #31.^[18] The adaptation was also\navailable as a three issue limited series.^[19]\n\n### Games[edit]\n\nIn 1984, FASA, a sci-fi tabletop game maker, created a gaming system The Last\nStarfighter: Tunnel Chase for The Last Starfighter.\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n#### Arcade[edit]\n\nA real The Last Starfighter arcade game by Atari, Inc. is promised in the end\ncredits, but was never released. If released, the game would have been Atari's\nfirst 3D polygonal arcade game to use a Motorola 68000 as the CPU. Gameplay\nwould have been taken from game scenes and space battle scenes in the film and\nwould have included the same controller that was used on the first Star Wars\narcade game. The game was abandoned once Atari representatives saw the film in\npost-production and decided it was not going to be a financial success.^[20]\n\n#### Home computer and console[edit]\n\nHome versions of the game for the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200^[21] consoles and\nAtari 8-bit home computers were also developed, but never commercially\nreleased under the Last Starfighter name. The home computer version was\neventually renamed and released (with some minor changes) as Star Raiders\nII.^[22] A prototype exists for the Atari 2600 Last Starfighter game, which\nwas in actuality a game already in development by Atari under the name\nUniverse. This game was eventually released as Solaris.^[23]\n\nIn 1990, an NES game titled The Last Starfighter was released, but it was\nactually a conversion of Uridium for Commodore 64, with modified sprites,\ntitle screen and soundtrack.^[24]\n\nA freeware playable version of the game, based on what is seen in the film,\nwas released for PC in 2007. This is a faithful reproduction of the arcade\ngame from the film and features full sound effects and music from the game.\nThe creators of this game, Rogue Synapse, have also built a working arcade\ncabinet of the game.^[25]\n\n## Potential sequel[edit]\n\nIn February 2008, production company GPA Entertainment added \"Starfighter \u2013\nThe sequel to the classic motion picture Last Starfighter\" to its list of\nprojects and two months later the project was reported to be \"stuck in the\npre-production phase\".^[26] It was still there as of January\n2012^[update].^[27] Hollywood directors, including Seth Rogen and Steven\nSpielberg, as well as screenwriter Gary Whitta, have expressed interest in\ncreating a sequel or remake, but Jonathan R. Betuel has allegedly indicated\nthat he does not want another film made.^[28]\n\nThe rights to the film have not been clearly defined due to conflicting\ninformation. Multiple sources say Universal Pictures still owns the theatrical\nand home media distribution rights while Warner Bros., which absorbed Lorimar-\nTelepictures (Lorimar's successor) in 1990, has the international distribution\nrights. Another source states that Universal has the option to remake the film\nwhile Betuel has sequel rights. Further complicating the situation is a claim\nthat both Universal and Warner Bros. each have remake and sequel rights.^[29]\n\nIn July 2015, it was reported that Betuel will write a TV reboot of the\nfilm.^[30]\n\nOn April 4, 2018, Whitta posted concept art for The Last Starfighter sequel on\nhis Twitter account.^[31] In the same tweet he also indicated that Betuel will\nbe collaborating with him on the project. In a follow-up interview with\nGizmodo, Whitta referred to the project as \"a combination of reboot and sequel\nthat we both think honors the legacy of the original film while passing the\ntorch to a new generation.\"^[32]\n\nOn October 20, 2020, Betuel stated that, with Whitta, a script for a sequel is\nbeing written and the rights to the film were recaptured.^[33]\n\nOn March 25, 2021, Whitta posted a sequel concept reel on YouTube called The\nLast Starfighters with concept art by Matt Allsopp and music by Chris Tilton\nand Craig Safan and featuring an audio clip from the original movie by Robert\nPreston.^[34]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Ender's Game - a 1977 short story/novelette by Orson Scott Card\n  * Armada - A 2015 novel by Ernest Cline with a similar premise\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"The Last Starfighter (1984)\".
