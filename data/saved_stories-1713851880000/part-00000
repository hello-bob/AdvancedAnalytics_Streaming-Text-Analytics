Hackers threaten to leak a copy of the World-Check database used to assess\npotential risks associated with entities\n\nPierluigi Paganini April 22, 2024\n\n## A financially motivated group named GhostR claims the theft of a sensitive\ndatabase from World-Check and threatens to publish it.\n\nWorld-Check is a global database utilized by various organizations, including\nfinancial institutions, regulatory bodies, and law enforcement agencies, for\nassessing potential risks associated with individuals and entities. It\ncompiles information from diverse sources like public records, regulatory\nfilings, and proprietary databases to create profiles of entities susceptible\nto financial crime, terrorism, or corruption. World-Check aids organizations\nin conducting due diligence and adhering to regulatory standards concerning\nanti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF).\n\nWorld-Check is currently owned by LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group).\n\nAd\n\nA financially motivated threat actor, called GhostR, announced the theft of a\nconfidential database containing 5.3 million records from the World-Check.\n\nThe threat actor said that he stole the database in March and threatened to\npublish the data online.\n\nThe hackers told TechCrunch that they stole the database from a Singapore-\nbased company that has access to the sensitive database, however, they did not\nname the victim organization.\n\nThe threat actors shared a portion of the stolen data with TechCrunch as proof\nof the hack, it includes records on current and former government officials,\ndiplomats, and politically exposed people. The list also includes criminals,\nsuspected terrorists, intelligence operatives and a European spyware firm.\n\nCompromised data vary by individuals and organizations, it includes names,\npassport numbers, Social Security numbers, online crypto account identifiers\nand bank account numbers, and more.\n\nWorld-Check had different owners across the years, it was originally founded\nas an independent company. Curiously, in 2011, Thomson Reuters acquired World-\nCheck, then in October 2018, Thomson Reuters closed a deal with The Blackstone\nGroup. As a result of this merger, World-Check became part of the new company,\nRefinitiv. LSEG acquired Refinitiv is 2021.\n\nThe disclosure of data in the archive poses a threat to the individuals whose\ndata it contains. This is sensitive information that could lead to\ndiscrimination, persecution, or otherwise cause harm to individuals by\nviolating their privacy and exposing them to various types of cyberattacks.\n\nThe database was criticized because it includes names of people and\norganizations that are mistakenly considered terrorists.\n\nIn June 2016, security researcher Chris Vickery found a copy of the World-\nCheck database dated 2014 that was accidentally exposed online.\n\nIn August 2015, journalists from BBC\u2019s Radio 4 gained 30 minutes of access\nthanks to the support of a disgruntled customer and demonstrated that the\ndesignations in the archive were inaccurate.\n\nThe Vice News also gained access to the World-Check archive in February 2016\narriving at the same conclusion after it analyzed some profiles in the\ndatabase\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\n(SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, GhostR)\n\nfacebook linkedin twitter\n\nCybercrime data breach GhostR Hacking hacking news information security news\nIT Information Security Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs Security News\nWorld-Check\n\n#### you might also like\n\nPierluigi Paganini April 22, 2024\n\n##### Windows DOS-to-NT flaws exploited to achieve unprivileged rootkit-like\ncapabilities\n\nRead more\n\nPierluigi Paganini April 22, 2024\n\n##### A flaw in the Forminator plugin impacts hundreds of thousands of\nWordPress sites\n\nRead more\n\n#### leave a comment\n\n#### newsletter\n\n###### Subscribe to my email list and stay up-to-date!\n\n#### recent articles\n\n###### Hackers threaten to leak a copy of the World-Check database used to\nassess potential risks associated with entities\n\nCyber Crime / April 22, 2024\n\n###### A flaw in the Forminator plugin impacts hundreds of thousands of\nWordPress sites\n\nSecurity / April 22, 2024\n\n###### Akira ransomware received $42M in ransom payments from over 250 victims\n\nCyber Crime / April 21, 2024\n\n###### DuneQuixote campaign targets the Middle East with a complex backdoor\n\nHacking / April 21, 2024\n\n###### Security Affairs newsletter Round 468 by Pierluigi Paganini \u2013\nINTERNATIONAL EDITION\n\nSecurity / April 21, 2024\n\nTo contact me write an email to:\n\nPierluigi Paganini : pierluigi.paganini@securityaffairs.co\n\nLEARN MORE\n\n#### QUICK LINKS\n\n  * Home\n  * Cyber Crime\n  * Cyber warfare\n  * APT\n  * Data Breach\n  * Deep Web\n  * Digital ID\n  * Hacking\n  * Hacktivism\n  * Intelligence\n  * Internet of Things\n  * Laws and regulations\n  * Malware\n  * Mobile\n  * Reports\n  * Security\n  * Social Networks\n  * Terrorism\n  * ICS-SCADA\n  * POLICIES\n  * Contact me\n\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2024\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by\nremembering your preferences and repeat visits.
