Quake 2 was\nreleased on the PC by id Software in 1997. In 2002, Hyperion Entertainment\nreleased a version for AmigaOS 3.x, based on the GPL source code of the game.\nIn addition to the AmigaOS 4 version, Steffen H\u00e4user has now also realised a\nnew port for AmigaOS 3 (68k) with numerous features that did not previously\nexist for any Quake 2 port for 68k.\n\nThis game, based on the GPL source code, also requires the data files of the\nPC version, either as a CD or the data of the Steam or Gog Classic version\n(for the latter two, simply copy them to a directory on your hard drive and\nselect this directory during installation).\n\nFeatures\n\n  * 68040, 68060 and 68080 compiled version (selectable during installation)\n  * MiniGL and software renderer\n  * Full support for mission CDs \"The Reckoning\" and \"Ground Zero\"\n  * Ports to the unofficial mission CD \"Zaero\" and to about 50 multiplayer mods will be released on Aminet soon, these downloads require the new version of Quake 2, they do not work with other ports\n  * For Vampire users: The USB gamepad of the Vampire is supported\n  * For Vampire V4 users: Background music will be played via AIFF (the Ogg Vorbis music files of the Gog/Steam version of Quake2 will be converted to AIFF format during the installation of the 080 version)\n  * For PiStorm users: background music is played via Ogg Vorbis (requires the Gog or Steam version of Quake 2, which includes the Ogg Vorbis files)\n\nSystem requirements\n\n  * Software: AmigaOS 3.x and the data files from Steam, Gog or CD version.\n  * Hardware: At least Vampire V2 or PiStorm Pi3 (currently not fast enough on a 68060, but possibly a future update will run fast enough on 100 MHz 060 systems)\n  * 1 GB free hard disc space\n\n#### Product Features\n\nSoftware works on ...Software works on...:Classic AmigaSoftware works on\nclassic Amiga\n\n#### Customers who bought this product also bought the following products:\n\n## ArtEffect 4 Plugins Collection Download Version\n\nShipping time: 3-4 Days\n\n\u20ac 9,99\n\n19 % VAT incl. excl.
