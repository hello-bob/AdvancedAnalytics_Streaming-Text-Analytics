This week will be the last fully free week.\n$15/month or $150/year will get you at least three issues per week, only one\nof which will be available to subscribers in the free tier.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nThere\u2019s a very obvious reason to do this: I like getting paid. But I also like\nthe incentives. A paid publication is a double opt-in incentive plan: it gives\nme a good reason to write more consistently, and it gives subscribers a good\nreason to read what I write. We\u2019re both committing to a better product.\n\nSubscriptions offer another layer of incentives, too: they change the payoff\nfunction of controversy. In ad-supported media, there\u2019s a tendency to say the\nmost outrageous stuff possible for clicks, usually by omitting details that\nexplain the bad guys\u2019 behavior. Subscription-based media can use the outrage-\ncultivation model, at least in general news, but the drift is slower and thus\neasier to stop. But the other side of online outrage is innocuous stuff that\ngets taken out of context, and paywalls significantly reduce the viral\ncoefficient of anger.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n### Private Equity and Software are Competing to Eat the World\n\nSome friends of mine run a B2B software company focused on a very specific\nsector of the economy\u2014one of those \u201cOh, I suppose that exists, and sure, it\nmakes sense that it\u2019s a multi-billion dollar industry, and it doesn\u2019t surprise\nme at all to find out that everyone in the industry thinks that fax machines\nare essential and that Excel is high-tech\u201d sorts of situations.\n\nThey sell software to independent companies. Meanwhile, private equity firms\nare buying up and slimming down companies in the same industry.\n\nIn a way, these are both the same business\u2014every fragmented market eventually\ngets gobbled up by Harvard MBAs armed with spreadsheets or Stanford CS majors\nwielding text editors. In both cases, the goal is to standardize, and\nimplement best practices, to profit from paying a fixed cost that can be\namortized over as many end users as possible.\n\nIt makes sense that finance and software would compete, because they\u2019re both\nhighly abstract businesses. In software, you make a model of the world and\nencode it; in finance, you build an operating model and then optimize it. In\nfact, they often solve exactly the same problems: better management of\ninventory and receivables, more efficient advertising, optimizing workloads,\ngetting rid of employees who don\u2019t add much value.\n\nSo which model wins? The answer comes down to transaction costs: is it cheaper\nto convince a small business owner to sign up for a subscription product, or\nto convince them to sell? And that depends on a whole slew of other factors:\n\n  * How cheap is debt financing compared to equity financing?\n  * How sophisticated are these business owners?\n  * How likely is it that anyone would want to inherit this business from their parents?\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate the last one. One of the greatest beneficiaries of the\nbaby boomer retirement wave is a small company called RCI Hospitality. \u201cRCI\u201d\nis an abbreviation for \u201cRick\u2019s Cabaret,\u201d and \u201cCabaret\u201d is a euphemism for\nstrip club. Strip clubs are a profitable business, but most people don\u2019t want\nto own one, which means the odds of someone a) owning one, and b) having a kid\nwho wants to inherit it, are quite low. As a consequence, RCI can pay bottom-\ndollar to buy strip clubs, cut some costs, and turn a healthy profit.\n\nIn other cases, the buy-out-vs-sell-to divide is harder to parse. WeWork was,\nin part, a bet that if you built software for managing and marketing short-\nterm office leases, it was cheaper to just lease the space and resell it than\nto convince landlords that WeWork\u2019s product was worth using.\n\nSome industries get totally transformed by a software product\u2014recruiting pre-\nand post-LinkedIn are totally different. Others get transformed when they get\nbought up by PE operators; Invitation Homes permanently changed the way\nresidential real estate functions, mostly by providing a well-funded marginal\nbuyer.\n\nAnd even the definition of \u201cSoftware\u201d is blurry. Hamburger University is\nbasically a piece of technology that very slowly and painstakingly writes how-\nto-run-a-burger-joint source code into store managers\u2019 brains. Marriott and\nHilton are so abstract that they barely even exist; they\u2019re an interface\nbetween guests and hotel operators, but they themselves don\u2019t own the assets.\n\nThis thesis has two corollaries: for every enterprise software company with a\nsurprisingly slow and expensive sales cycle, there ought to be a private\nequity-backed rollup. And, conversely, for every rollup that finds it hard to\nsqueeze out incremental cost benefits, there\u2019s a software company waiting to\nhappen.\n\n### Classifieds\n\nA New York-based VC is incubating a new business in the fintech space, and\nlooking for a new hire on the business development side. If you or someone you\nknow is interested in early-stage tech, has sales experience, and wants to\njoin something exciting in the very early days, please reply to this email and\nsay so. Fluency in Mandarin a big plus.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nI have a new piece in CoinDesk today on why China\u2019s leadership is excited\nabout blockchain. And no, it\u2019s probably not because they love the idea of a\npermissionless, anonymizable currency system\n\nMatt Levine articulates a theory\u2014with hat tips to me and my Girardian mimetic\nrival Alex Danco\u2014that gnomic VC tweets are a competitive advantage.\n\nI asked a famously gnomic and successful VC about this a while ago, and he had\nanother take: VC tweets are vague because the insights are born out of\nincidents they can\u2019t or won\u2019t talk about. You can occasionally find good takes\non the dramatic backstories of successful startups (Hatching Twitter is pretty\ndishy, for example), and compare investors\u2019 public pronouncements to their\nboardroom behavior. Ever investor who says \u201cAlways invest in smart people who\nwork hard\u201d is saying that because they\u2019ve been part of a board that deposed\nsomeone for being stupid or lazy. At least by CEO standards.\n\nIn a way, it implies that venture capitalists are nicer than they\u2019d otherwise\nbe. Given the failure rate of startups, and the sample size of investors\ncompared to founders, they came by all that gnomic wisdom the expensive way.\nIt\u2019s nice to know that venture-backed startups are one domain where you can\ncost someone millions of dollars and when they complain about you it won\u2019t be\nby name.\n\nMartin Casado and Matt Bornstein of a16z have a great piece on why \u201cAI\u201d\ncompanies have worse margins than other software companies. The root of the\ncomparison is that traditional software companies find something with a high\nfixed cost and low marginal cost, then scale it and get high and rising\nmargins. In AI, the high fixed cost is born by academic researchers, and they\npublish their results. The business tends to involve a lot more data-labeling\nand model-training, all of which is a) expensive, and b) scales right along\nwith the top line. It always feels like an AI-based company is a software\ncompany, like Google or Microsoft, but it\u2019s really one layer down; an AdWords\nagency, or a consulting shop where everyone gets really efficient once they\nlearn Excel.\n\nScott Locklin has more, from a practitioner\u2019s standpoint. Key quote: \u201cI\u2019ll go\nout on a limb and assert that most of the up front data pipelining and\norganizational changes which allow for it are probably more valuable than the\nactual machine learning piece.\u201d The right business plan for an AI company\nmight be to raise money as a software company and then use that capital to\ntransition into a consulting model.\n\nAnd the first half of this Ben Horowitz interview has even more, including a\ndiscussion of Databricks. Databricks is a great product, but it\u2019s also the\nsingle most efficient way to convert interesting hypotheses into colossal AWS\nbills.\n\nOn this topic, The Economist pointed out a few weeks ago that China\u2019s AI\ncompanies don\u2019t just benefit from lots of local engineering talent\u2014they also\nbenefit from cheap data-labelers in poorer provinces.\n\nAnd, two more points on China and the limits of scale. First, a detailed\nwriteup of a Chinese academic paper mill. As Google has discovered in its\nbattle with black-hat SEO, any sufficiently scalable way to automatically\nproduce text lends itself to detection. China is a special case in academic\npublishing, because many non-academic jobs require publications for career\nadvancement; there\u2019s demand for something that looks like an academic paper,\nbut that nobody will read. And, in an example of the demerits of an entirely\ndifferent sort of scaling: Hainan province is planning to take over HNA. HNA\nwas originally a small airline servicing a tropical island, but spent\n2015-2017 frantically levering up to buy a crazy grab-bag of assets\u2014Ingram\nMicro ($6bn), a quarter of Hilton Worldwide ($6.5bn), 10% of Deutsche Bank,\nreal estate, more hotel brands, 20% of Dufry, the third-largest aircraft\nleasing company ($10.4bn), and various airlines. They\u2019ve been in trouble for a\nwhile, hitting employees up for reverse-payday loans, and now they\u2019re\nunwinding. HNA seemed to exist to transform non-RMB cash in the Chinese\nbanking system into assets anywhere else in the world. But any company that\ngrows thanks to readily available financing will eventually find that it\u2019s too\ndependent on financing, and vulnerable to random external events.\n\nThe NYT has a great piece on what was either a high-margin retailer or a\nfraud, involving rare books in France. The basic model was to buy rare books\nand letters, and sell shares in them to retail investors. The sale contract\nmay or may not have promised a minimum return of 8%; the Times is\nfrustratingly vague on this. Notable because a few US-based companies like\nRally Rd. and Otis have started offering shares in old cars, rare books,\nexpensive sneakers, and modern art. The entire business is itself a form of\nmodern art, forcing us to confront the definition of \u201cownership\u201d in an\nabstracted and financialized world. If you owned a pair of Air Jordan 1s, you\nprobably wouldn\u2019t wear them, so why not \u201cown\u201d them in a more approximate\nsense? If owning a 1% share in them gives you more than 1% of the joy of\nowning the entire thing, slicing collectible objects into shares is a net win\nfor everyone. On the other hand, \u201ccollectible\u201d is a misnomer, since the other\nreason to own it is that if you have it, nobody else does. So these businesses\nmight reduce the aggregate \u201ccollectibility\u201d of collectibles, while keeping\nbuyers happy. It\u2019s Solomonic justice meets financial engineering!\n\nI wrote a few months ago about how \u201cdeepfakes\u201d are just an easier way to do\nwhat the media already do\u2014reprocess video to fit a predefined narrative. We\u2019re\nseeing the first test of this theory, with a new Bloomberg campaign video that\ntechnically violates Twitter\u2019s strict rules against manipulative edits, but\ndoesn\u2019t violate Facebook\u2019s. The Twitter rule is broad enough that it can\u2019t be\nfully enforced as written\u2014it would ban quoting \u201cWe are all Keynesians now\u201d and\n\u201cInformation wants to be free,\u201d both of which are truncated versions of full\nquotes with very different meanings. Perhaps social media moderation will be a\ngood live case study for the a16z argument that any software company that\nneeds to continuously learn from real-world inputs will have structurally low\nmargins.\n\nFinally, Kris Abdelmessih has some useful thoughts on investment fees. The\nfundamental point: for a given investment strategy and fee structure, lower\nvolatility generally constitutes a fee increase. It\u2019s very convenient for\nhedge funds that so many large investors are volatility-sensitive, since that\nconstitutes a wealth transfer to asset managers. As a corollary, if capital\nallocators start to figure this out, we\u2019ll finally see a swing away from large\nmultistrategy shops and back to more focused operators.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n### Share this edition!\n\n#### Sign up\n\n### Become a member\n\nSign Up Now\n\nJoin 50,000+ industry professionals and curious generalists by subscribing to\nThe Diff.\n\n  * Data & Privacy\n  * People\n  * Manifesto\n  * Log In\n\n\u00a9 Copyright The Diff, Byrne Hobart\n\n", "frontpage": false}
