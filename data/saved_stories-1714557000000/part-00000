The agency stated that the carriers sold access to\ncustomers' location data to aggregators, which in turn sold that information\nto third parties, and in doing so \"attempted to offload its obligations to\nobtain customer consent onto downstream recipients of location information\"\nwhich meant that valid customer consent wasn't obtained in some cases, an FCC\npress release (PDF) stated Monday.\n\n\"These carriers failed to protect the information entrusted to them. Here, we\nare talking about some of the most sensitive data in their possession:\ncustomers' real-time location information, revealing where they go and who\nthey are,\" said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel.\n\nThese cases were brought up during the last administration, Rosenworcel\npointed out, and cover incidents from years ago. AT&T was fined $57 million,\nwhile Verizon was fined $46 million. Sprint, which merged with T-Mobile in\n2020, was fined $12 million; T-Mobile itself was fined $80 million.\n\nRead more: All the Ways Your Cellphone Carrier Tracks You and How to Stop It\n\nThe carriers have pushed back on the agency's case and the fine amounts, with\nAT&T decrying that the FCC calculated its fines without a hearing or citing a\nspecific example in which its customers' data was unlawfully shared. The\ncarriers noted that the agency's order concerns a customer location-sharing\nprogram to support services like roadside assistance and medical alerts that\nwas shut down over five years ago, and it required opt-in customer consent.\n\nBoth AT&T and Verizon acknowledged a single related incident of fraud wherein\n\"one bad actor\" got unauthorized access to a very small number of customers'\nlocation data, which the carriers responded to by cutting off access and\nbolstering protections.\n\n\"The order penalizes us for trying to maintain valued consumer services\noffered by companies with absolutely no track record of misconduct and ignores\nthat we took immediate steps to address the failures of one bad apple,\" said\nAlex Byers, AT&T's director of communications and PR.\n\nT-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon plan to appeal the fines.\n\nThe FCC noted in its press release that this investigation was kicked off by\npublic reports that US carriers were sharing customer location information\nwithout consent to a Missouri sheriff via third-party data vendor Securus,\nwhich provides services to correctional facilities.\n\n## Mobile Guides\n\nPhones\n\n  * Best iPhone\n  * Best Galaxy S24 Deals\n  * Best Phone\n  * Best iPhone Deals\n  * Samsung Galaxy S24 Review\n  * Best Android Phones\n  * Best Samsung Galaxy Phone\n  * Pixel 8 Pro Review\n  * iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max Review\n  * Best iPhone 15 Deals\n\nFoldable Phones\n\n  * Best Foldable Phones\n  * Galaxy Z Fold 5 Review\n  * OnePlus Open Review\n  * Best Galaxy Z Flip Deals\n\nHeadphones\n\n  * Best Wireless Earbuds\n  * Best Noise Canceling Headphones\n  * Best Headphones\n  * Best Over Ear Headphones\n  * Best Wireless Earbuds and Headphones for Making Calls\n  * Best Headphones for Work at Home\n  * Best Noise Canceling Wireless Earbuds\n  * Best Sounding Wireless Earbuds\n  * Best Cheap Wireless Earbuds\n  * Best Wireless Headphones\n\nMobile Accessories\n\n  * Best iPhone 15 Cases\n  * Best iPhone 14 Cases\n  * Best Power Bank for iPhone\n  * Best Airpods Pro Accessories\n  * Best Magsafe iPhone Accessories\n  * Best Speakerphone\n  * Best Wireless Car Charger and Mount\n  * Best iPhone Fast Charger\n  * Best Portable Chargers and Power Banks for Android\n\nSmartwatches\n\n  * Apple Watch Series 8 vs Series 7\n  * Best Apple Watch Bands\n  * Best Android Smartwatch\n  * Apple Watch Ultra Review\n  * Best Smartwatch\n\nWireless Plans\n\n  * Best Prepaid Phone Plans\n  * Best Cheap Phone Plans\n  * Best Unlimited Data Plans\n  * Best Phone Plans\n  * Best Phone Plan Deals\n  * Best Senior Phone Plans\n  * Best Family Phone Plans\n  * Best Travel Phone Plans\n  * Best Verizon Plans\n\nMobile coupons\n\n  * Samsung Promo Codes\n  * Consumer Cellular Coupons\n  * Verizon Promo Codes\n  * AT&T Wireless Promo Codes\n  * Best Buy Coupons\n  * Motorola Coupon Codes\n  * OnePlus Promo Codes\n  * Sony Coupon Codes\n  * Apple Store Promo Codes\n\nYour guide to a better future\n\n  * Deals\n  * Reviews\n  * Best Products\n  * Gift Guide\n  * Coupons\n  * Videos\n  * Software Downloads\n  * About CNET\n  * Press Room\n  * Newsletters\n  * Sitemap\n  * Careers\n  * Manage Preferences\n  * Help Center\n  * Licensing\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\nUS France Germany Japan Korea\n\n\u00a9 2024 CNET, a Red Ventures company.
