Is that really a\nreinvention at all?\n\nBy Matteo Wong\n\nIllustration by Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic.

A clawlike\ncontraption lurched forward, like a bird pecking at feed, to snatch dishes\nholding a faux-chicken cutlet and potatoes, then inserted them onto a metal\ntrack that snakes through a 650-degree-Fahrenheit oven. Seven minutes, some\nautomatic food dispensers, and two conveyor belts later (with a healthy assist\nfrom human hands), my meal was sitting on a shelf of mint-green cubbies. It\nwas a vegan fried-chicken sandwich, a cucumber salad, crispy potatoes, and a\nsmattering of other sides.\n\nThis is Kernel, a fast-casual venture that opened its first store, in\nManhattan, this February. Its founder, Steve Ells, kicked off the lunch-bowl\nboom when he started Chipotle in 1993. Now, he told me during my visit, he is\nbetting that machines will trigger a \u201creinvention of how a fast-food or fast-\ncasual restaurant can run.\u201d Robots, he prophesied, will bring faster and more\naccurate service at lower overhead costs. Plenty of chains have tested out\nsemi-automated cooking, with mixed success\u2014including deep-frying robots at\nJack in the Box and robotic bowl assembly at Sweetgreen and Chipotle. But\nKernel has been built from the ground up for robots. Just three employees are\nneeded in the restaurant at any time, compared with the dozen required for a\ntypical fast-casual restaurant. Soon many more people may be eating robot-\nprepared vegan chicken: Ells has raised $36 million and hopes to expand\nquickly, starting with several more locations throughout New York City this\nyear.\n\nBut robots may represent less of a fast-food revolution than the obvious next\nstep in its evolution. For more than a century, technology has made fast food\nmore efficient\u2014and, in particular, more automated. That\u2019s what turned\nMcDonald\u2019s into a giant 60 years ago. Such restaurants can be considered \u201csort\nof mini-factories,\u201d Dave Henkes, a food-industry analyst at Technomic, told\nme, and have always used \u201cautomation to drive speed and convenience.\u201d And,\nlike the simpler cooking technology before them, today\u2019s robots are speeding\nup humans\u2019 work without fully replacing them. For now, Kernel is no different.\n\nRead: A robot\u2019s nightmare is a burrito full of guac\n\nKernel\u2019s entirely vegan menu is limited (Ells prefers \u201cfocused\u201d), but\neverything looked and tasted like it came from fine dining. That is no\ncoincidence: Kernel\u2019s chief culinary officer, Andrew Black, was a sous-chef at\nEleven Madison Park, a three-Michelin-star restaurant with a $365 tasting\nmenu, located a block away from Kernel. While I ate, he and Ells gave\npassionate spiels about each item: The marinated beets, a surprise best\nseller, are topped with quinoa, green hummus, and a seed crunch to make the\ndish nutritionally complete. For the crispy potatoes, Black specially selected\na spud variety for its sugar, starch, and water content, and they\u2019re then\ncooked three times\u2014steamed, fried, baked\u2014to achieve a shattering crunch and\npillowy interior. Black and his staff dredge and fry every piece of \u201cchicken\u201d\nby hand; as I bit into my sandwich, Ells mused that they should try swapping\nimitation meat for a block of tofu.\n\nSimply put, Kernel is a group of excellent chefs equipped with the world\u2019s\nmost high-tech toaster oven. All the food is cooked by chefs at a central\nkitchen about 10 minutes away, delivered hourly by a bicycle courier, and\nheated by a robot. That off-site preparation, Ells told me, provides at least\n80 percent of the menu\u2019s quality. The food then has to be assembled by still\nthree other people. Human one, the \u201creplenisher,\u201d loads the hourly delivery of\nprepared food onto a shelf that the robotic arm can reach. The \u201cassembler\u201d\nputs together every sandwich and side, and a third person, the \u201cbundler,\u201d bags\neach order and places it in a cubby.\n\nCourtesy of Kernel\n\nThe setup is \u201cextraordinarily fast, accurate, and predictable,\u201d Ells told me,\nnothing less than a \u201cparadigm shift.\u201d Employees barely have to move their\nfeet. But a robot that heats and moves around your food is just the next\niteration in the pursuit of speed and standardization. The restaurant with the\nstrongest claim to inventing fast food may be White Castle, which, in 1921,\n\u201cdid something that was unusual for the time\u2014they tried to standardize their\noperations from restaurant to restaurant,\u201d David Hogan, a fast-food historian\nat Heidelberg University, in Ohio, and the author of Selling \u2019em by the Sack:\nWhite Castle and the Creation of American Food, told me. Cooking procedures\nwere precise and uniform; cooking implements were manufactured in a single\nlocation; even the physical buildings came out of a central factory.\n\nThe playbook hasn\u2019t substantively changed since. Before buying McDonald\u2019s and\nlaunching its global success, Ray Kroc sold the chain automatic milkshake\nmixers. What first captivated him about the restaurant, he wrote in his 1977\nmemoir, was how \u201ceach step in producing the limited menu was stripped down to\nits essence and accomplished with a minimum of effort.\u201d That year, the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics published a study noting that fast-food chains had\n\u201cintroduced principles of industrial engineering\u201d to restaurants. In\nparticular, \u201cthe off-premise preparation of foods\u201d and improved \u201ccooking\ndevices,\u201d such as microwaves and convection ovens, reduced preparation time\nand added uniformity. Restaurants today use specialized equipment, extensive\ntraining manuals, and various trackers to ensure speed and consistency.\nSweetgreen has an app that instructs employees exactly how to heat and prepare\nfood, and McDonald\u2019s cooks beef patties for precisely 42 seconds. If anything,\nKernel\u2019s off-site kitchen is conceptually closer to the centrally prepared,\nfrozen patties and fries served by fast-food burger joints of old than the\nchicken grilled on-site at a Chipotle.\n\nRead: Too many Americans are missing out on the best kitchen gadget\n\nTo the extent that Kernel is a reinvention, Ells hasn\u2019t invented a new\nparadigm so much as found another. Sweetgreen already acts like a tech\ncompany, and Domino\u2019s has touted itself as one. Now Ells talks about his\nrobot-assisted process as an \u201coperating system.\u201d What may one day distinguish\nKernel\u2019s automation is that the space is designed for robots from inception.\nSo far, other chains have retrofitted human kitchens with robots, which\ncreates confusion and disaster, Stanislav Ivanov, who studies robotics and\nrestaurants at Bulgaria\u2019s Varna University of Management, told me. Robots\nmalfunction, and even when they don\u2019t, bulky machines interfere with\nequipment, stations, and a floor plan designed for human movement. In 2018, an\nearly burger-flipping robot that was tested at a CaliBurger in Pasadena was\ntemporarily decommissioned because it couldn\u2019t be incorporated into the human\nworkflow.\n\nKernel is, at least in theory, built for \u201cthe technology that we know is\ncoming,\u201d Ells said. The equipment is all mobile and can be swapped or\ncalibrated for newer gadgets (permanent counters, ovens, and stovetops, for\ninstance, are unnecessary because robots don\u2019t care if workstations are waist-\nheight). Drones could bring prepared food from the central kitchen to\nrestaurants, and robots might assemble burgers in their entirety. Efficient\nrobots and a vegan menu, he said, will continue to reduce the restaurant\u2019s\ncarbon footprint. Gesturing to the \u201cbundler\u201d who bagged all the food, Ells\nsaid, \u201cInstead of Carlos, imagine a robot arm.\u201d (Carlos kept bundling without\nso much as a flinch.)\n\nWith automation, of course, comes the risk of disappearing jobs. Kernel and\nother restaurants are experimenting with robots not only in pursuit of\nefficiency, but because the industry is facing a chronic labor shortage. The\nlow pay doesn\u2019t help, and the jobs are also exhausting as well as, at times,\nhazardous. Deep-frying, for instance, is extremely dangerous, which is why one\nof the most popular cooking robots in the industry simply runs the fry\nstation. Fast-food chains pursuing automation are trying to reduce head count,\nespecially as some states raise their minimum wages. But for now, Henkes said,\nrobots have typically led restaurants to redeploy people to different\npositions. Ells claimed that Kernel\u2019s existing employees, who are currently\npaid $25 an hour, will eventually be moved to more front-of-house jobs,\nhelping guests and monitoring the robots.\n\nBut a burger prepared, cooked, and served without a human touch is still more\naccurately described as speculation. Faster and more automated cooking\ntechnology may well be imminent, but humans will still be involved for years\nto come. Automated pizzaiolos, line cooks, and salad tossers have failed;\nsuccessful robots typically target a specific task, such as plunging fries\ninto boiling oil.\n\nJust as the quality of Kernel\u2019s food depends on human chefs, the quality of\nits automation will depend less on technology than on human vision and\nfeedback. Each day, employees meet to discuss what worked and what didn\u2019t,\nwhich will help iterate the technology: Dozens of bugs, including stalled\nproduction and locked cubbies, have been smoothed out. On the first day, the\ncubbies didn\u2019t open; last month, a stray potato shut down Kernel\u2019s production\nline. Kernel is building new tools, but relying on the same human logic that\nmade White Castle, McDonald\u2019s, and Chipotle successful. I came to the\nrestaurant to witness fancy robots, but I would return simply for the faux-\nchicken sandwich and the cucumbers topped with cashews and chili jam. Kernel\nthe restaurant is far more impressive than Kernel the tech company.\n\nMatteo Wong is an associate editor at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
