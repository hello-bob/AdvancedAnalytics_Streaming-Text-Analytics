It\u2019s as cool as I imagined, even more!\n\n## Constructionist Education\n\nBoth Yoot Tower and SimCity/Micropolis share the same goals and benefits of\nconstructionist education, inspired by Seymour Papert and Alan Kay.\n\n### Micropolis: Constructionist Educational Open Source SimCity\n\nA lightning talk at HAR 2009 about applying Seymour Papert's and Alan Kay's\nphilosophy of Constructionist Education to Micropolis, the open source version\nof SimCity. Illustrated and edited transcript of the YouTube video playlist:\nHAR 2009: Lightning talks Friday. Videos of the talk at the end.\n\nhttps://donhopkins.medium.com/har-2009-lightning-talk-transcript-\nconstructionist-educational-open-source-simcity-by-don-3a9e010bf305\n\n## LGR: Yoot Tower: The Sequel to SimTower\n\nMaybe somebody can even fix the bug in the Windows version that Clint Basinger\n(LGR) kept getting zapped by in his in-depth review of Yoot Tower:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqNECXCd9iU\n\n## Micropolis Core (Open Source SimCity for the browser, using WebAssembly)\n\nI\u2019ve been getting a head start on porting Yoot Tower to the browser by working\non renovating the existing open source C++ version of SimCity / Micrcopolis to\nrun in the browser too, using Emscripten and Embind to wrap the C++ code in a\nJavaScript/TypeScript API.\n\nBoth projects will share the same modern tech stack and web interface\n(Emscripten, Embind, WebAssembly, TypeScript/JavaScript, SvelteKit, Node,\nCanvas/WebGL/HTML/CSS, etc), and I'm developing a JavaScript based SDK and\nplugin system for them both, so they'll eventually plug together with multiple\nYoot Towers embedded into your live Micropolis city! And then you can plug a\nvideo arcade into Yoot Tower, which includes a Micropolis game console that\nyou can play, to wrap back around to the outer city simulator! (No nasty\ninfinite regression, just a nice clean loop!)\n\nhttps://github.com/SimHacker/MicropolisCore\n\n### Emscripten MicropolisEngine Wrappers\n\nThis is where the magic happens that binds the C++ MicropolisEngine simulator\nclass and structures to JavaScript, so you can call back and forth between C++\nand JavaScript, and implement the user interface and plug-ins in JavaScript.\nSee the comments in the code for a description of the approach and design\nconsiderations. We will take the same approach with Yoot Tower.\n\nhttps://github.com/SimHacker/MicropolisCore/blob/main/MicropolisEngine/src/emscripten.cpp\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI examined the timestamps in the files in the Yoot Tower code drop, and\norganized the sources and releases by date, translating the Japanese directory\nnames.\n\nThe file names and function and variable names are all in English, but there\nare lots of Japanese comments, and some user visible Japanese strings that\nwill need to be translated.\n\nI'll continue comparing and analyzing the different versions to figure out how\nthey changed over time and what to use for the open source version.\n\nIt includes the old Maxis SimTower code, some Japanese Windows versions, and\nversions for the GameBoy Advance SP and Nintendo DS.\n\nThe most recent version is the Nintendo DS version. It has some interesting\nadditions and changes, but I presume a lot of that stuff is Nintendo's\nproperty and branding, like Mario and other characters we can't use in the\nopen source version.\n\nWe have to remove / fictionalize / rename / rewrite / redraw any trademarked\ncontent for the open source version, but we can archive the original sources\nfor academic research purposes.\n\nJeff Braun told me happened with Maxis and Godzilla, so I want to be careful\nto avoid stomping on anybody\u2019s property:\n\n\"Maxis was sued by Toho. We never referred to the name Godzilla, our monster\non the box cover was a T-Rex looking character, but... a few magazine reviews\ncalled the monster, Godzilla. That was all it took. Toho called it \"confusion\nin the marketplace\". We paid $50k for Godzilla to go away. In all honesty,\nToho liked Maxis, they said $50k was the minimum they take for Godzilla\ninfringement. I doubt you will need to worry about Toho, as long as there are\nno magazine reviews that call the monster Godzilla.\"\n\nI guess the lesson is to always make sure to give your monsters a unique name,\nand don\u2019t leave that up to the user\u2019s imagination.\n\nThanks for your attention and any advice or collaboration you can contribute!\n\n-Don (don@donhopkins.com)\n\n## Directories of code drop:\n\n  * The_Tower\n\n    * Windows sources.\n    * 1993-02-01 .. 2005-07-05\n  * The_TowerSP\n\n    * GameBoy Advance SP sources.\n    * 2004-08-03 .. 2005-04-07\n  * The_TowerDS\n\n    * Nintendo DS sources.\n    * 2008-05-26 .. 2009-08-01\n  * The_TowerII\n\n    * Windows releases, no sources.\n    * 1999-01-19 .. 1999-11-09\n\n## Sources:\n\n  * 1993-02-01 .. 1996-09-22 ./The_Tower/Old NT Backup 2/95ntback2/tow_EX2/Maxis-ST-code\n\n    * Original Maxis SimTower sources.\n    * Old short upper case file names.\n  * 1993-07-20 .. 1995-09-07 ./The_Tower/Tower \u79cb\u30e4\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3 Final Data/SOURCE/WIN/TOWER/SRC1_2 \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Tower Autumn Version Final Data\n\n    * Old short upper case file names.\n  * 1994-04-02 .. 1997-02-04 ./The_Tower/Old NT Backup 1/95ntback2/tow_EX2/tower 8-22 working version stuff/SRC_CD\n\n    * Old short upper case file names.\n  * 1994-08-14 .. 1996-03-18 ./The_Tower/Old NT Backup 1/95ntback2/tow_EX2/tower 8-22 working version stuff/Demo95\n\n    * Old short upper case file names.\n  * 1994-08-14 .. 1996-09-29 ./The_Tower/Old NT Backup 1/95ntback2/tow_EX2/tower 8-22 working version stuff/Src_cde\n\n    * Old short upper case file names.\n  * 1994-08-14 .. 1996-10-09 ./The_Tower/Old NT Backup 1/95ntback2/tow_EX2/tower 8-22 working version stuff/SRC1_295\n\n    * Old short upper case file names.\n  * 1997-05-23 .. 1997-05-23 ./The_Tower/Old NT Backup 1/95ntback2/tow_EX2/Src_cd2\n\n    * Old short upper case file names.\n  * 2004-08-03 .. 2004-08-03 ./The_TowerSP/The Tower SP 2004.05.25\u7248 \u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fcROM/TowerSP040525/TowerSP_J_040525/beta/tower \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 The Tower SP 2004.05.25 version Master Source Documents & Master ROM\n\n    * Newer long mixed case file names.\n    * GameBoy Advance SP.\n  * 2005-07-05 .. 2005-07-05 ./The_Tower/Tower\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc 2005,7,5/tower \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Tower Master 2005,7,5\n\n    * Newer long mixed case file names.\n  * 2005-04-07 .. 2005-04-07 ./The_TowerSP/The Tower SP 2005.02.25\u7248 \u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc (\u88fd\u54c1\u7248)\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fcROM/TowerSP050225/TowerSP_J_050225/overseas/tower \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 The Tower SP 2005.02.25 version Master (Final Version) Source Documents & Master ROM\n\n    * Almost identical to above but for a few added psd and other files.\n  * 2008-05-26 .. 2009-08-01 ./The_TowerDS/The Tower DS \u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af \u5168\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf 2009,9,7/TowerDS_NAND/tower \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 The Tower DS Classic Full Backup Data 2009,9,7\n\n    * Nintendo specific additions and modifications.\n\n## Releases:\n\n  * The_TowerII/99121\u81ea\u7531\u306e\u5973\u795e \u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc2\u7248 \u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8 CD-ROM GM No2 \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 99121 Statue of Liberty Master 2 version Hybrid CD-ROM GM No2\n\n    * 1999-01-19\n  * The_TowerII/99226 1400 \u4eac\u90fd\u99c5\u30d3\u30eb \u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8 CD-ROM GM no.2 \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 99226 1400 Kyoto Station Building Hybrid CD-ROM GM no.2\n\n    * 1999-02-26\n  * The_TowerII/120 1700 \u81ea\u7531\u306e\u5973\u795e windows\u7248 \u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc2 \u672c\u4f53+movie\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092MacinTosh\u306b\u79fb\u3059\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u300creadme\u300d\u306f\u5909\u66f4 219\u30ac\u30e1\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc Windows\u7248\u3092Mac\u306b\u79fb\u3059 \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 120 1700 Statue of Liberty Windows version Master 2 Body + movie data to transfer to Macintosh \"readme\" is to be changed.

Published by Maxis, the game,\ninitially released as \"SimTower: The Vertical Empire\" (or \"The Tower\" in\nJapan), is a construction and management simulation game for Windows and\nMacintosh System 7, developed by OPeNBooK and published in November 1994. It\ninvolves building and managing a tower, placing various facilities to achieve\na five-star rating while dealing with random events like terrorist acts.\n\nThe Tower II introduced the Tower Kit an optional software allowing players to\nadd new maps and stages, enhancing gameplay with new features. It also\nincluded a crossover element between redevelopment and a love story, set in\nNew York. The game links to the movie \"Gamera 3,\" featuring battles between\nGamera and Gyaos in Tokyo, and offers a final showdown in Kyoto. Additionally,\nit offers a special package with maps related to the movie and various\ntowerkit maps, enhancing the gaming experience.\n\nDiscussions on Hacker News reflect the game's impact and its innovative\napproach to game design, including its start as an elevator simulator and its\ninfluence on the gaming community. Yoot Saito, the game's creator, also worked\non other projects like \"Mario Motors\" and expressed interest in open-source\ndevelopment. His relationship with key figures in the gaming industry, such as\nSatoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto, is highlighted, showcasing the game's\nsignificance in the industry and pop culture.\n\n## Description\n\nMaxis published SimTower by Yoot Saito, which later developed and published as\nYoot Tower in the US and The Tower II in Japan, along with many plug-ins using\nTower Kit.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimTower\n\nSimTower: The Vertical Empire (known as The Tower in Japan) is a construction\nand management simulation video game developed by OPeNBooK and published by\nMaxis for the Microsoft Windows and [Macintosh System 7 operating systems in\nNovember 1994. In Japan, it was published by OPeNBook that same year and was\nlater released for the Sega Saturn and 3DO in 1996. The game allows players to\nbuild and manage a tower and decide what facilities to place in it, in order\nto ultimately build a five-star tower. Random events take place during play,\nsuch as terrorist acts that the player must respond to immediately.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20000521002924fw_/http://www.openbook9003.co.jp/tower2/towerkit/whats_tk.html\n\n## What's Tower Kit?\n\nTower Kit is optional software for The Tower II. In The Tower II, you can\nselect the stage where you want to start the game using the concept of a\n\"map.\" The Tower II package comes with three maps: \"Shinjuku Subcenter,\"\n\"Hawaii Diamond Head,\" and \"Kegon Falls,\" and the \"Tower Kit\" adds these maps.\nBy installing this tower kit, a new stage game will begin. Tower kits don't\njust add more stages. Each map has new features, allowing you to play a\ncompletely new game.\n\n> Please try the \"Tower Kit\" which allows for infinite variations.\n\nA love story between you, the person in charge of the Liberty Island\nredevelopment project, and two men and women who are your subordinates.

I met Mr. Will Wright, who had just\nreleased Simcity. When I showed him The Tower under development in the event\nwaiting room, he was so impressed that he recommended it to Jeff, the founder\nof MAXIS, the publisher of Simcity. I remember jumping up and down when I\nheard that there was something going on. Even after 15 years, I don't think\nI've ever experienced news comparable to this.\n\n# The Open Source SimTower Clone\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SimTower/comments/18r2s7f/would_anyone_like_to_develop_an_open_source/\n\nReddit: I would love a opensource version/clone of simtower/yoottower but it\nseems all the ones i found are abandoned\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SimTower/comments/oc6glc/i_would_love_a_opensource_versionclone_of/\n\nReddit: What would you like to see in a Yoot Tower sequel?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SimTower/comments/jlufze/what_would_you_like_to_see_in_a_yoot_tower_sequel/\n\n# Article about Yoot\n\nhttps://www.destructoid.com/yoot-saito-worked-on-mario-motors-a-canceled-ds-\ngame-about-building-engines/\n\nYoot Saito worked on Mario Motors, a canceled DS game about building engines\nPosted 21 April 2018 by Jordan Devore\n\nHe also explained what it\u2019ll take for a new Seaman to happen\n\nIn a talk about game design philosophy at Reboot Develop 2018, SimTower,\nSeaman, and Odama creator Yoot Saito revealed that he once worked on an\nunusual Nintendo DS game codenamed Mario Motors.\n\nSaito told some heartwarming stories about his friendship with Nintendo\u2019s\nSatoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto, some of which he has shared before in\ndetail. Back in the early 2000s, the three would have get-togethers in which\nthey would \u201cchat over tea casually\u201d and talk about ideas for games.\n\n\u201cDuring one meeting, Iwata-san asked me a question: \u2018Saito-san, what have you\nbeen interested in lately?\u2019 I immediately understood what he was getting at,\nso I answered \u2018sculpting chunk.\u2019 Miyamoto-san said \u2018huh?!'\u201d (To help explain\nto the audience what he was referring to, Saito talked a bit about how things\nlike watches, camera frames, and MacBooks are made. Sculpting objects out of\nmetal chunks spoke to him and it was an idea he \u201creally wanted\u201d to make into a\ngame.)\n\n\u201cThis kind of sculpting is really appealing to a middle-aged guy like me,\u201d\nSaito said.\n\n\u201cI explained this crazy idea to them and they really listened to me very\ncarefully in complete silence, and finally said \u2018that sounds interesting,\nlet\u2019s give it a try.'\u201d\n\nThe concept eventually morphed into Mario Motors, \u201ca game where you created\nengines.\u201d\n\nSaito summed it up as \u201cshaving and sculpting out of a chunk of metal to make a\ncylinder [which then] decides the ability of your engines.\u201d For part of the\ngame he wanted to teach players how acceleration works in an interesting way\nand thought about having them blow into the DS microphone. \u201cI scrapped this\nidea because this would cause children to get out of breath,\u201d he explained.\n\nReflecting back on his meetings with Iwata and Miyamoto, Saito said \u201cI really\nunderstand just how much they respected each other, and how they formed the\ntwo wheels that pulled Nintendo\u2019s game business forward. They paid attention\nto me because they were always hungry for something new.\u201d\n\nAs for why Mario Motors never moved ahead, Saito said \u201cI can\u2019t tell you why,\nbut please guess.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t have any formal announcements to make during the talk, but it seems\nas if he\u2019s still interested in a SimTower-style game (he asked the entire\naudience to come up mid-presentation and look at a basic prototype on his\niPad) as well as Seaman. For the latter, Saito would want it on mobile\n\u201cwithout any endings for years\u201d and that would require a sophisticated and\nnuanced AI engine that talks back to players. \u201cUntil that engine is done, I\u2019m\nnot going to create a sequel to Seaman, but I am working on that.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.destructoid.com/yoot-saito-on-iwata-canned-seaman-3ds-game/\n\nYoot Saito on Iwata, canned Seaman 3DS game Posted 15 July 2015 by Steven\nHansen\n\n# Some words from Yoot\n\nCanned fish\n\nWe\u2019ve covered Seaman frequently throughout the years on Destructoid with\noverflowing hearts. And it\u2019s under tragic circumstances that we get\nconfirmation: Seaman 3DS was a planned project that fell through.\n\nOriginal Seaman developer Yoot Saito wrote a blog post, translated over at\nNeogaf, reflecting on his relationship with the late Satoru Iwata.\n\nI first met Iwata-san back in 1996, so it was a time before you would\ntypically see him in a suit. It was at HAL in Kofu. I remember that he always\ncarried around a Mac (PowerBook), which was quite rare in the games industry.\nI think that formed a bit of connection between us\u2014a feeling that we shared\nthe same interests. It was around the year after that when I saw him with a G3\nPowerBook, which even I had hesitated to buy, and I remember thinking, \u2018this\nguy really loves Macs.\u2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a bit later that I got a chance to work with him. It was\naround the time when Seaman was taking the world by storm and I was really\nbusy working on planning for the sequel and taking interviews and such.\n\nIwata-san got in touch and asked if we could meet, and he even came all the\nway out to the apartment I was renting in Tokyo to see me.\n\nAs anyone who has met him probably understands, Iwata-san always has this aura\nabout him that makes you feel happy and at ease. When you\u2019re around him, you\njust feel good, even if you\u2019re talking about work. That day, Iwata-san wasn\u2019t\nin his typical casual garb, but had donned a blazer that he didn\u2019t look quite\ncomfortable in. He handed me his business card and awkwardly said, \u2018this is\nwhat I\u2019m up to these days.\u2019 I looked at the card and he had a title that named\nhim as part of the Office of the President. He said that he had distanced\nhimself from HAL (the company at which he got his start in the games industry)\nand was now helping out at Nintendo (HAL was under the umbrella of Nintendo).\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been given a special assignment to go out and get new types of games\nthat haven\u2019t been on Nintendo platforms before.\u2019 That\u2019s the reason Iwata-san\ngave me for why he wanted to meet that day. He told me that Seaman was the\nkind of thing he was looking for. Thinking about it now, his role at this time\nwas probably given to him as preparation for taking over management of\nNintendo down the road, but it didn\u2019t look like that was on his mind at all at\nthe time.\n\nIt\u2019s worth reading in full for the interesting tidbits, such as Saito\u2019s\nconfirmation that his suggestion led to the Wii controller\u2019s speaker, or Saito\nand Iwata\u2019s experimentation with StreetPass sort of technology back in the\nGame Boy days. I was so bright eyed over the sincerity and passion of this\nnostalgia I almost forgot how Saito\u2019s blog post had to end.\n\nWhen Iwata-san came to ask me to create Seaman for the 3DS, I like to think he\nwas in the same frame of mind as when he first came to visit me at my\napartment back in 1999. I did start working on the project, but things got\nreally complicated and I eventually let go of it. Unfortunately that brought\nan end to our relationship, where I could just casually visit him in Kyoto and\nhave fun exchanging new ideas. I felt like we needed some time before we could\ngo back to the kind of creativity-filled relationship.\n\nIt was early last summer that I first heard about him taking some time off to\nrecover from an unfortunate illness. I distinctly remember it, because I was\nactually sharing a taxi at the time with two super famous people: Yuji Horii-\nsan of Dragon Quest fame and Takafumi Horie, otherwise known as Horiemon.\n\nIwata-san, when I later saw you appear before the press, I was really happy to\nsee that you had recovered, but it looks like the gods aren\u2019t that lenient...\nTezuka-san (from Nintendo) suggested that I make an appointment to see you,\nbut I couldn\u2019t find the nerve to do so. Now, after all my hesitation, I\u2019ve\nlearned that we truly passed each other by, and I\u2019ll never be able to see you\nagain. I wish I had a StreetPass feature that could connect with heaven. I\nwould run out and buy a DS with that feature right now just so I could send\nyou my thanks. Yeah, I know that sounds a bit too convenient for me. When I\nleft the Seaman project, I sent you a book and a letter. Whether you actually\nread them or not has been on my mind ever since. Also, I\u2019m really sorry for\nbeing late with Odama, causing it to completely miss the window for it to be a\nsuccess. There\u2019s so much more I want to tell you, but I really don\u2019t know what\nto do with myself after hearing about your sudden departure in the news.\n\nLife is always just a succession of regrets.\n\nIwata-san, thank you for everything. I don\u2019t typically look up to a lot of\npeople, but I really respected you. I would always be thinking from afar just\nhow amazing of a person you are.\n\n\u5ca9\u7530\u3055\u3093\u3001\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u3055\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3089\u3002[Yoot]\n\n# More News articles\n\n## Hacker News: Railroad Tycoon:\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13898241\nhttps://www.filfre.net/2017/03/railroad-tycoon/\n\n# Words from the Gamers themselves (Shocking)\n\nSomewhat of a competitor, but any Sim Tower fans here?

The study revealed seven descriptions of what the Maxis Sim player\nthought a Sim game should be. While the \u201cSeven Points of Sim\u201d descriptions\nreflect customer expectations, they are not all necessarily the ingredients\nfor a Sim game. To understand why Sim players perceive Sim games the way they\ndo, we can look at the key factors that make a game a \u201cSim\u201d.\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR A MAXIS SIM GAME\n\nDilemma\n\nPlayers must always grapple with difficult decisions. In SimCity, pollution\nmay be a problem, but there might be a strong industrial demand. In SimTower,\ncondo-dwellers will need elevators heading down, while office workers will\nneed elevators heading up.\n\nCrisis\n\nCrisis can also mean disasters. Players occasionally need to abandon long term\nstrategy in favor of short-term success. If a fire is burning in SimCity or\nSimTower, players might need to destroy all their creations in the surrounding\narea.\n\nBudgeting\n\nThe amount of funding a player has acts as both a limiting factor and a kind\nof score. Every action by the player costs money - even mistakes - and there\nare no refunds. \u201cCheats\u201d to gain more money are the most popular cheats.\n\nAesthetics\n\nArtwork is important for players to admire their creations. Also, the ability\nto place buildings, zones, crops, etc. in various places that may not have\nrelevance to the Sim, fakes players into believing that their city or tower\ndesigns are \u201cbetter\u201d than other\u2019s. Finally, aesthetics are a form of reward\nfor the player. In SimTower, an aesthetic reward for reaching the 100th floor\nis the ability to place a cathedral. This is akin to \u201cwinning\u201d.\n\nChange in Rules over Time\n\nRule changes cause players to change their playing strategy. In SimCity,\ndemand for Industry is high at first, but then swings to Commerce. In\nSimTower, the placement of condos is important at first, but nearly irrelevant\nafter the 3rd Star.\n\nVisual/Graphical Feedback\n\nA Simulator is nothing but formulae operating on a data set. The player\u2019s main\ninterpretation of the change in data is graphical, in the form of tall\nbuildings in SimCity, and long elevator lines in SimTower. An example failure\nin graphical feedback is Outpost from Sierra, where player feedback is in the\nform of numbers in a dialog box.\n\nCause & Effect are not Immediately Apparent\n\nBecause of the interleaving data sets in the simulators, players may not\ninitially understand why certain actions have unexpected effects. One of the\ncompelling reasons to play is to discover and understand various causes and\neffects.\n\nPlayers are allowed to destroy their Creations\n\nWho says there is no violence in Sim games? A favorite activity of the Sim\nplayer is to save a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d copy of their creation, then unleash\ndisaster after disaster, and bulldoze like crazy.\n\nHacker News: So You Think You Can Program an Elevator\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10889075\n\nhttps://github.com/mshang/python-elevator-challenge/blob/master/README.md\n-DonHopkins on Jan 31, 2022\n\nThis makes me want a hackable version of SimTower. -logn on Jan 13, 2016\n\nI have a pet theory that Sim Tower came out of someone playing around with\nelevator algorithms for fun and then turning that into a game. -prutschman on\nJan 13, 2016\n\nNot a theory, reality. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimTower#Gameplay\n-cridenour on Jan 13, 2016\n\nAwesome, my favorite game when I was younger.\n\nHacker News: Elevator Dispatch Algorithms:\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4347568\n\nhttp://www.smartplanet.com/blog/pure-genius/intelligent-elevators-answer-\nvertical-challenges/8191\n\n  * Jcsnv on Jan 13, 2016\n\nSo how long before they can predict the future to be at the right place at the\nright time every time?\n\nIt's certainly how interesting how critical a good setup can be to get a large\nskyscraper to actually work well.

Additionally zoning is either\nresidential, commercial or industrial, so there's no concept of mixed-use\nzoning (ie. commercial on the bottom of a building, residential on top) which\nyou see everywhere.\n\nI'd love to see a smaller scale game that really focuses on these details.\nSimCity 4 and other games went in the other direction, building systems around\nhow a metropolitan region of multiple cities would interact.\n\n-rmserror on Aug 7, 2012\n\nSimTower sort of did this, within the context of a single skyscraper. I'm not\nsure if it is on GOG or anywhere else legitimate these days - odds are it\nmight not be a simple matter to run on modern Windows, unless you want to spin\nup an XP VM.\n\nI spent way too many hours playing SimTower as a kid. It was pretty fun,\nespecially if you took advantage of the infinite money cheat involving\nbuilding a specific type of room in one certain place on the bottom of the\nlevel... Not bad for a game that was built around an elevator simulator\n\nThe Designer's Notebook: The Perils of Bottom-up Game Design:\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130510184845/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130563/the_designers_notebook_the_.php\n\n-douche on Sept 4, 2015\n\nI've very much enjoyed playing SimTower, and I still have a legitimate exe of\nit sitting around. But the game is a Win16 game, and my latest experience\nrunning it in WINE was crap (it became very easy to completely lock up X).\nPossibly it might make more sense running in Windows 3.1 in dosbox.\n\nIncidentally, this is a motivation for why I'm playing a bit with statically\nrecompiling x86-16 code to run on x86-32.\n\n-jcranmer on Sept 4, 2015\n\nIt's actually available on iPad under it's Japanese release name:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yoot-tower/id379197311?mt=8\n\n-mosheroperandi on Sept 4, 2015\n\nYoot Tower was actually the sequel to SimTower, not the Japanese name for it.\n\nHacker News: Elevator Expert on How to Move 10k People Up a 118-Floor\nSkyscraper\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39064171\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK6XZvIt22w\n\n-amyjess on Sept 4, 2015\n\nIf I remember the story correctly, the creator of Sim Tower wondered the same,\nand discovered that the algorithms governing that were closely-guarded\nsecrets.

Anybody interested? ;)\n\n-DonHopkins 22 days ago\n\n-END\n\n## About\n\nYoot Tower\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n3 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n4 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
