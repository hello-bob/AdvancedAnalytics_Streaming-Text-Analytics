(AP) \u2014 The video is unsettling, with haunting images of\nfaceless people, fire and soldiers. The voiceover is a cascade of recognizable\nhistorical voices as the screen pulses cryptic messages touting the power of\nwords, ideas and \u201cinvisible hands.\u201d\n\nHints of its origin are tucked into frames as they flash by: PSYWAR. The\nArmy\u2019s psychological warfare soldiers are using their brand of mental combat\nto bring in what the service needs: recruits. And if you find the video\nintriguing, you may be the Army\u2019s target audience as it works to enlist\nsoldiers to join its Special Operations Command.\n\nReleased in the early morning hours Thursday, the video is the second\nprovocative recruiting ad that, in itself, exemplifies the kind of work the\npsyop soldiers do to influence public opinion and wage the war of words\noverseas. Called \u201cGhost in the Machine 2,\u201d it is coming out two years after\nthe inaugural video was quietly posted on the unit\u2019s YouTube site and\ngenerated a firestorm of online chatter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a recruiting video,\u201d said the Army major who created it, speaking with\nThe Associated Press before the release. \u201cSomeone who watches it and thinks,\nwow, that was effective, how was it constructed \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of creative\nmindset we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE\n\nMississippi city council member pleads guilty to federal drug charges\n\nUnited Methodist delegates repeal their church\u2019s ban on its clergy celebrating\nsame-sex marriages\n\nRunaway steel drum from Pittsburgh construction site hits kills woman\n\nThe soldier, a member of the 8th Psychological Operations Group based at Fort\nLiberty, North Carolina, also made the first video. He asked that his name not\nbe used to protect his identity, as is common among special forces troops.\n\nPsyop units are used for an array of missions that can range from simple\nleaflet drops to more sophisticated propaganda and messaging aimed at\ndeceiving the enemy or shaping opinion on foreign soil. It\u2019s illegal for the\nU.S. military to conduct psychological operations on Americans.\n\nArmy Special Operations Command leaders and special forces recruiters hope\nthat a new stream of chatter inspired by the video will help bring in recruits\nto an often unseen and little known job.\n\n\u201cFrom a tactical level, the psyop mission is extremely hard to show and tell,\u201d\nsaid Lt. Col. Steve Crowe, commander of the Special Forces Recruiting\nBattalion. And it\u2019s the job in Army special forces that recruiters say is the\nhardest to fill.\n\nAcross the military, the armed services have been struggling to meet\nenlistment goals, with most falling far short of their targets in recent\nyears. The Army, which is the largest service, has had the most trouble,\nmissing its goal by about 15,000 soldiers for the past two years. But most of\nthe services say things are improving this year.\n\nThe Army\u2019s Special Operations recruiters who recruit from already-serving\nsoldiers say they are making about 75% of their overall goal, which is between\n3,000 and 4,000. Of that, they have to bring in about 650 active-duty soldiers\nto psychological operations per year.\n\nOfficials blame the nation\u2019s low unemployment, increased competition from\ncorporate businesses, which can pay more and offer similar benefits, and a\nsluggish return from several years of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions that\nprevented recruiters from visiting schools and attending other public events.\n\nRecruiting struggles in Army Special Operations Command have mirrored those of\nthe larger Army. The recruiters said they are responsible for bringing in\nseveral types of special forces \u2014 the most well-known are the Green Berets and\nDelta Force, but there are also Civil Affairs, Psychological Operations and\nthe 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the Night Stalkers.\n\nThe Army has said it intends to trim the number of psyop soldiers, but still\nhas struggled to fill the ranks.\n\nPerhaps the most celebrated psyop was in World War II, when the so-called U.S.\nGhost Army outwitted the Germans using inflatable tanks, radio trickery,\ncostumes and impersonations. In what was dubbed Operation Viersen, the\nsoldiers used the inflatables, sound trucks and phony headquarters to draw\nGerman units away from the point on the Rhine River where the 9th Army was\nactually crossing. Several of the last surviving members of the unit were\nrecently awarded the Congressional Gold Medal at a ceremony in Washington.\n\nThese days, psyop activities are often classified. But one of the last U.S.\nservice members to die in Afghanistan \u2014 killed by a suicide bomber at Abbey\nGate during the chaotic evacuation in 2021 \u2014 was a psyop soldier: Army Staff\nSgt. Ryan Knauss, 23, of Corryton, Tennessee. His task that day was largely\ncrowd control and influence, by using a bullhorn to communicate with the\nfrantic throngs of Afghans and get them moving in the right direction.\n\nA more recent example would be assistance to Ukraine. U.S. psychological\noperations soldiers have advised and assisted Ukrainian troops in their\nefforts to counter Russian disinformation campaigns since 2014. After the\nRussian invasion in February 2022, Ukrainian forces used a range of tactics \u2014\nincluding leaflets and social media \u2014 to entice Russian troops to surrender\nand tell them how and where to give themselves up.\n\nAbout half of the psychological operations troops are young people who join\nwhen they enlist. The rest are recruited from within the Army\u2019s existing\nranks. The command\u2019s recruiters focus on the internal audience, which has its\nown challenges.\n\nA growing hurdle, according to Crowe and Army Maj. Jim Maicke, executive\nofficer of the Special Forces recruiting battalion, is that these days regular\nsoldiers across the Army have less interaction with special operations forces\nthan they did during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nIn those conflicts, soldiers often worked side-by-side with commandos, or were\ndeployed at the same bases and had a better view of what they did.\n\n\u201cBusiness was generally pretty good. And the reason, we believe, was all the\ninteraction that was happening between special operations and conventional\nforces,\u201d said Crowe, adding that soldiers \u201cgot to see behind the curtain, how\nwe operate. We don\u2019t have that anymore.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s particularly difficult for psyops soldiers, whose work is often less\nvisible than that of the more celebrated Army commandos and not always\nunderstood.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all nerds for sure,\u201c said the Army major who created the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019re\nall nerds in different ways.\u201d Usually, those who are drawn to the job are\n\u201cplanners,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re writers, they\u2019re great thinkers. They\u2019re idea\npeople.\u201d\n\nOften, he said, they are creative, such as artists and illustrators, but\nothers are tech experts who can bring those ideas to life in videos or online\nmessaging.\n\nThe new \u201cGhost in the Machine\u201d video is aimed at that audience.\n\nRecruiters say the first video was successful.\n\n\u201cI think what he does with \u2018Ghost in the Machine\u2019 is it tells you what\npsychological operations is, and shows you it, without telling you in words,\u201d\nsaid Crowe. \u201cYou watch the video and you\u2019re like, okay, this is how I\u2019ll\ninfluence and change behavior.\u201d\n\nOn a recent recruiting trip to the Citadel, the Military College of South\nCarolina, the recruiters brought a psyop officer and a civil affairs officer\nalong to speak with the cadets.\n\n\u201cWe had a very limited amount of time to engage about 450 cadets,\u201d said\nMaicke, a graduate of the college. \u201cAnd the psyop officer chose to give a\nbrief introduction and then immediately turn on the \u2018Ghost in the Machine\u2019\nvideo. He ended with, \u2018if anyone has any questions about this, I\u2019m right over\nhere,\u2019 and business was booming.\u201d\n\nIn fact, about six months after the first video was released, the command\nbegan surveying soldiers who applied for the psyop mission and got into the\nassessment and selection course. More than 51% said the video had a medium to\nhigh level of influence on their decision to try out for the job, recruiters\nsaid.\n\nThat, said the Army major, is the goal of the second video, which ends with a\ncrescendo of music, shots of marching military troops with their arms raised\nin surrender, and a question streaming across the screen: \u201cDo you believe in\nthe power of words and ideas. Will You. We Believe.\u201d The final frames say\nPSYWAR and show the website: goarmysof.com.\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nAaron Rodgers not expected to have any restrictions in the Jets' next phase of\noffseason workouts\n\nTreppenlift-VergleichAd Content\n\nAdvertisement Rentner in Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-\nVergleich:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDoug Liman, Matt Damon and the Afflecks made a heist comedy for Apple.
