In some cases, the affected mobile devices\nare running malicious apps. In other cases, users have enrolled their devices\nin proxy services in exchange for various incentives.\n\nUnidentified adversaries then use these devices in credential-stuffing\nattacks, which use large lists of login credentials obtained from previous\ndata breaches in an attempt to access online accounts. Because the requests\ncome from IP addresses and devices with good reputations, network security\ndevices don\u2019t give them the same level of scrutiny as logins from virtual\nprivate servers (VPS) that come from hosting services threat actors have used\nfor years.\n\n\u201cThe net sum of this activity is that most of the traffic in these credential-\nstuffing attacks appears to originate from the mobile devices and browsers of\neveryday users, rather than from the IP space of VPS providers,\u201d according to\nan advisory that Okta published over the weekend.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nAttackers are pummeling networks around the world with millions of login\nattempts\n\nOkta\u2019s advisory comes two weeks after Cisco\u2019s Talos security team reported\nseeing a large-scale credential compromise campaign that was indiscriminately\nassailing networks with login attempts aimed at gaining unauthorized access to\nVPN, SSH, and web application accounts. These login attempts used both generic\nand valid usernames targeted at specific organizations. Cisco included a list\nof more than 2,000 usernames and almost 100 passwords used in the attacks,\nalong with nearly 4,000 IP addresses that are sending the login traffic. The\nattacks led to hundreds of thousands or even millions of rejected\nauthentication attempts.\n\nWithin days of Cisco\u2019s report, Okta\u2019s Identity Threat Research team observed a\nspike in credential-stuffing attacks that appeared to use a similar\ninfrastructure. Okta said the spike lasted from April 19 through April 26, the\nday the company published its advisory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkta officials wrote:\n\n> Residential Proxies are networks of legitimate user devices that route\n> traffic on behalf of a paid subscriber. Providers of residential proxies\n> effectively rent access to route authentication requests through the\n> computer, smartphone, or router of a real user, and proxy traffic through\n> the IP of these devices to anonymize the source of the traffic.\n>\n> Residential Proxy providers don\u2019t tend to advertise how they build these\n> networks of real user devices. Sometimes a user device is enrolled in a\n> proxy network because the user consciously chooses to download \u201cproxyware\u201d\n> into their device in exchange for payment or something else of value. At\n> other times, a user device is infected with malware without the user\u2019s\n> knowledge and becomes enrolled in what we would typically describe as a\n> botnet. More recently, we have observed a large number of mobile devices\n> used in proxy networks where the user has downloaded a mobile app developed\n> using compromised SDKs (software development kits). Effectively, the\n> developers of these apps have consented to or have been tricked into using\n> an SDK that enrolls the device of any user running the app in a residential\n> proxy network.\n\nPeople who want to ensure that malicious behavior isn\u2019t routed through their\ndevices or networks should pay close attention to the apps they install and\nthe services they enroll in. Free or discounted services may be contingent on\na user agreeing to terms of service that allow their networks or devices to\nproxy traffic from others. Malicious apps may also surreptitiously provide\nsuch proxy services.\n\nOkta provides guidance for network administrators to repel credential-stuffing\nattacks. Chief among them is protecting accounts with a strong\npassword\u2014meaning one randomly generated and consisting of at least 11\ncharacters. Accounts should also use multifactor authentication, ideally in a\nform that is compliant with the FIDO industry standard. The Okta advisory also\nincludes advice for blocking malicious behavior from anonymizing proxy\nservices.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n7\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
