Leaving the Balkans\nbehind, my body traveled at a speed of 400 miles an hour over the Great\nHungarian Plain, the snowy mountain passes of the Alps, the forests of\nsouthwest Germany, the Rhine and the Low Countries. Through the blurry\nwindowpane I watched the continent slide by, its greens and browns smeared\ntogether like a spill of paint. Mountain ranges passed in minutes, great\nrivers in seconds. I tried to spot landmarks \u2014 Had I walked through that\nwoodland? Had I crossed a bridge down there? \u2014 but none of it seemed remotely\nreal. As the plane touched down in London, I had the sense that somehow,\nsomething had gone extremely wrong.\n\nSeven months before, I had embarked on that journey in reverse. In the winter\nof 2011, I took the overnight ferry from Harwich to the Hook of Holland. Then\nI started walking and continued for 2,500 miles. My journey followed the\nfootsteps of the travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, who completed his \u201cgreat\ntrudge\u201d on New Year\u2019s Day 1935, and took me through the Netherlands, Germany,\nAustria, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey to the shore of the\nBosporus.\n\nI slept on couches, in the ruins of castles and abandoned hunting hides. I got\nlost in graffitied city streets and in snowbound forests. I spent the vast\nmajority of those months alone, talking to myself with a lack of self-\nconsciousness that at times alarmed me. Birdsong, the roar of cars, church\nbells, cowbells, outraged dogs, the rush of rivers and the patter of rain kept\nme steady company. The sound I heard more than anything else was the crunch,\ncrunch, crunch of my boots on the road.\n\nBy the time I got to Istanbul, those boots were full of holes. My skin was\nscorched from the sun, and I had a matted beard and a stench I hardly\nrecognized; even after multiple baths, I couldn\u2019t shift that smell for weeks.\nFor hundreds of miles, through rain and snow, skirting autobahns and being\nchased by dogs, I\u2019d been dreaming of my arrival in the place that Leigh Fermor\nhad set his sights on 79 years before: \u201cThe chief destination was never in a\nmoment\u2019s doubt,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe levitating skyline of Constantinople pricked\nits sheaves of thin cylinders and its hemispheres out of the sea-mist.\u201d\n\nBut my arrival didn\u2019t feel like that. I was beyond exhaustion. I limped to the\nquayside, sat down and dragged off my stinking boots. The call to prayer was\nsounding, and the sky was full of seagulls. I felt happy, but in a distant\nway. Mostly, I felt like crying.\n\nOriginally, I\u2019d planned to return home slowly, a gradual re-acclimatization\nover weeks by way of trains and buses. But having reached my destination, I\nwas just too tired. I\u2019d done what I set out to do. My purpose seemed\nconcluded.\n\nHence the flight, and a walk that had taken 221 days compressed, with a\nviolence that startled me, into 240 minutes.\n\n\u201cTravel has a warping effect on time, elongating it in some ways while\ncompressing it in others.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nReturning home after being away for any length of time is strange. The\nMoroccan explorer Ibn Battuta, who journeyed 70,000 miles across much of the\n14th-century Islamic world, wrote that \u201ctraveling gives you home in a thousand\nstrange places, then leaves you a stranger in your own land.\u201d I\u2019d venture that\nall travelers, whether they have been away for years, months or only weeks,\nknow something of this estrangement. What gap year student hasn\u2019t returned\nfrom their rite-of-passage journey to find that the \u201cgap\u201d now lies between\nthem and their former life? This peculiar dislocation \u2014 a kind of out-of-body\nexperience \u2014 might wear off after several days, or it might last much longer.\n\nFor me it lasted for at least the same period as my absence. During that time\nI tried and failed to slot back into my old life, but everything seemed\nmisaligned. The familiar sights around me had become foreign. One of the most\nconfounding things was that my mental map of London \u2014 a city I\u2019d learned\nstreet by street in the era before Google Maps, cycling for hours each day\nwith a battered A-Z map \u2014 had completely vanished, as if the data had been\nwiped. I constantly found myself lost in neighborhoods I had known for years.\n\nThis cartographic distortion was accompanied by a temporal one. Travel, as has\noften been noted, has a warping effect on time, elongating it in some ways\nwhile compressing it in others. Like Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity,\nthe bigger the journey and the greater its gravitational pull on the\ntrajectory of your life, the more the temporal field around it seems to become\ndilated. It can feel like you\u2019ve been gone for a lifetime and have changed\nirrevocably, and yet when you return, time has apparently stood still. George\nOrwell described something like this in \u201cHomage to Catalonia\u201d on his\nhomecoming from the chaos of the Spanish Civil War:\n\nDown here it was still the England I had known in my childhood [...] the\nfamiliar streets, the posters telling of cricket matches and Royal weddings,\nthe men in bowler hats, the pigeons in Trafalgar Square, the red buses, the\nblue policemen \u2014 all sleeping the deep, deep sleep of England, from which I\nsometimes fear that we shall never wake till we are jerked out of it by the\nroar of bombs.\n\nOf course I hadn\u2019t come home from a war, but I was struck by a similar sense\nthat, during the time I\u2019d been gone, the place I\u2019d left had been in a state of\nsuspended animation. Nothing had changed, and yet, confusingly, nothing was\nwhat I remembered. It was a geographical version of the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d\neffect, in which ostensibly normal things take on an alien quality. It was as\nif my body had arrived but some other vital part of me had not. I seemed to\nhave dropped it on the road to Istanbul.\n\nUnderlying this was another impression, even more disturbing. I couldn\u2019t shake\nthe nagging sense that the achievement of my walk \u2014 all the struggles,\nhardships, joys and revelations \u2014 had in some way been negated by the manner\nin which I\u2019d returned. Flying had undone the walking, raveling it all back in.\n\nMuch later I came to understand that, on a spiritual level, it had. I had not\ncompleted a walk, but half a pilgrimage.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t shake the nagging sense that the achievement of my walk had in\nsome way been negated by the manner in which I\u2019d returned.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nIn the West, pilgrimages are much in vogue these days, often stripped of\nreligious baggage and repackaged as \u201cslow travel.\u201d Spain\u2019s Camino de Santiago,\nby far Europe\u2019s best known pilgrim path, was tramped by more than 446,000\npairs of boots in 2023, double the number from a decade before and six times\nmore than two decades ago, according to the Pilgrim\u2019s Reception Office in\nSantiago de Compostela. Of course, many of these peregrinos, bearing their\ntraditional scallop shells, go to revere the shrine of Saint James, but\nincreasing numbers are drawn to the walk for secular reasons. The British\nPilgrimage Trust, a charity formed in 2014, talks of a \u201cglobal renaissance,\u201d\nenthusing on their website:\n\nToday\u2019s pilgrims have often come to a crossroads in their life, and want the\nslowing, socially levelling and revitalizing benefits that pilgrimage brings.\nOthers want to connect with themselves, others, their ancestors, spirituality\nor nature. Pilgrimage is, at its essence, the story of discovery and quest \u2014\nof Odysseus, Aeneas and Frodo.\n\nThis choice of names at first seems strange, but what these unlikely\ncharacters share is the so-called \u201chero\u2019s journey,\u201d a motif popularized by the\nmythologist Joseph Campbell. A pilgrimage is a hero\u2019s journey in the\narchetypal sense, but one in which the victory over \u201cfabulous forces\u201d is an\ninternal one.\n\nCampbell identified three key stages of such journeys: departure, initiation\nand return. Of these, the latter is the least examined yet perhaps the most\nimportant. After leaving ordinary life and overcoming obstacles, a pilgrim,\ncrucially, must return home to integrate whatever knowledge they gained into\ntheir community.\n\nThe journey is not a straight line but a completed circle. The supposed\ndestination \u2014 whether Rome, Jerusalem, Mecca, the banks of the Ganges or\nanywhere else \u2014 is not the end of the road but the exact halfway point. The\nreal destination is your own front door.\n\nIn the days before high-speed travel, you either reached the pilgrimage site\non foot or on a ruminant\u2019s back, and you had no option but to go home the same\nway. The outward journey and the return, therefore, were of equal lengths \u2014\nnot only in terms of distance but in terms of time.\n\nMy journey wasn\u2019t a pilgrimage in the religious sense. But \u2014 although I wasn\u2019t\naware of it then \u2014 it matched that archetypal shape, and only afterward did I\nrealize my archetypal mistake. I had completed the return, but I didn\u2019t do it\nslowly.\n\n\u201cThe journey is not a straight line but a completed circle. The real\ndestination is your own front door.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nThere\u2019s an old idea that the soul travels at the speed of walking. In an\nArabic saying, according to the philosopher Alain de Botton, this is pegged\nspecifically to the walking speed of a camel, which, at around three miles an\nhour, is the same as the average human\u2019s. In \u201cEssays on Love,\u201d he wrote:\n\u201cWhile most of us are led by the strict demands of timetables and diaries, our\nsoul, the seat of the heart, trails nostalgically behind, burdened by the\nweight of memory.\u201d\n\nRebecca Solnit put it much the same way in her history of walking,\n\u201cWanderlust\u201d: \u201cI suspect that the mind, like the feet, works at about three\nmiles an hour. If this is so, then modern life is moving faster than the speed\nof thought.\u201d In other words, thoughts \u2014 or souls \u2014 can get left behind if\ntheir hosts move too quickly.\n\nRead Noema in print.\n\nAnother writer who thought deeply about the importance of walking speed was\nBruce Chatwin, to whom Leigh Fermor was a friend and mentor. Chatwin believed\nhumanity\u2019s original state was nomadism, and that a golden age was lost when\nmost cultures settled down. In \u201cThe Songlines,\u201d he wrote that \u201cman is a\nmigratory species\u201d and described an experiment performed at a London clinic\nthat showed that babies soon stopped crying when rigged up to a device that\n\u201cimitated, exactly, the pace and action of a mother\u2019s walk.\u201d \u201cDay in, day out,\na baby cannot have enough walking,\u201d Chatwin wrote. \u201cAnd if babies\ninstinctively demand to be walked, the mother, on the African Savannah, must\nhave been walking too.\u201d\n\nThe act of walking engages something fundamental about being human, an\natavistic memory of our ancient origins. When I set out on my walk, that sense\ntook time to emerge. I found myself constantly frustrated at how slowly I was\nmoving compared to everything around me. Passing bicycles felt like personal\ninsults; cars and trains were like demons from another dimension.\n\nIt took many days to accept slowness. I was past the German border before my\nconsciousness adapted to an ambulatory pace, and my thoughts began to move in\nrhythm with my footsteps. Then the idea of moving faster felt unnatural and\nvaguely alarming.\n\nAfter about a month, I broke my own rules on a rainy day and accepted a lift\nfrom one city to the next. A journey that should have taken a day collapsed\ninto 30 minutes. Sitting mutely in the passenger seat, I had a minor panic\nattack at how the experience disjointed me from the world around, violently\ntearing me from the state I had spent weeks cultivating.\n\nChatwin recounted being driven through the Australian Outback in the company\nof an Aboriginal man. The man was singing his songline, which, in much-\nsimplified terms, is a spiritual or ancestral map where every landmark forms a\npart of the Dreamtime story. When the vehicle sped up, the song\u2019s cadence sped\nup too; when the vehicle slowed, it slowed. The land and its song were\ninnately linked and cannot be decoupled.\n\n\u201cThe soul travels at the speed of walking.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nThe journalist Paul Salopek, currently 11 years into a walk along the path of\nhuman migration from Africa\u2019s Rift Valley to the tip of South America (a\njourney of Ibn Battutan ambition), also talks of walking in terms of\nmusicality. In a recent interview with Emergence, he likened it to \u201ca stylus\ndropping into a groove on the surface of a planet and making this music. And\nwe are, our bodies are, that stylus, and we\u2019re meant to move at this RPM that\ncomes with the movement of our body.\u201d Solnit put it more succinctly: Walking\n\u201cis how the body measures itself against the Earth.\u201d\n\nA few days after my ride down the road, I found myself following signs that\nshowed an image of a woman driving an antique vehicle alongside the words\n\u201cBertha Benz Memorial Route.\u201d These markers commemorated the maiden voyage of\nthe world\u2019s first car. In 1888, Bertha Benz tested her husband Karl\u2019s\nprototype automobile on what was then the rough carriageway between Bruschal\nand Pforzheim. Even Karl was doubtful about the outcome of this test, but, by\nconnecting the two cities, Bertha proved the viability of a new form of\ntransport. Less than 50 years later, Germany would lay tarmac for the world\u2019s\nfirst autobahn.\n\nPart of my journey thus became an inadvertent pilgrimage along a route of\ngreat historical significance: one of the birthplaces of modernity, the\nbeginning of a time when we would be propelled headlong into the high-speed\nage. The fact that I badly injured myself tramping down that very road \u2014\nsuffering weeks of Achilles tendonitis that almost put an end to my walk \u2014 was\nan appropriate, if painful, flagellation.\n\nAt three miles an hour, the world is a continuum. One thing merges into the\nnext: hills into mountains, rivers into valleys, suburbs into city centers;\ncultures are not separate things but points along a spectrum. Traits and\nlanguages evolve, shading into one another and metamorphosing with every mile.\nEven borders are seldom borders, least of all ecologically. There are no\nbeginnings or endings, only continuity.\n\nIf driving breaks that continuity, flying explodes it. It shatters reality\ninto bits that have to be pieced back together. We label this \u201cjet lag\u201d \u2014 a\ndisruption of the circadian rhythm caused by different time zones \u2014 but what\nreally lags behind is much more fundamental.\n\nAt a travel event some years ago, I met a computer programmer who wanted to\ndesign an app \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether she ever did \u2014 that worked as a soul-\ntracker. You plot your origin and destination on a map before getting on a\nplane, and when you land, a tiny dot will be inching toward your new location:\nyour displaced soul, patiently plodding after your body. If you stay where you\nare, it will eventually catch you up, but if you jet off somewhere else, it\nwill have to keep chasing; presumably, if you kept on moving, it might never\ncatch you. The idea was meant to be entertaining, but I found it haunting. In\nthe age of mass transit, our restless world must be thick with ceaselessly\nroving souls, wandering imagined maps with no hope of reunification.\n\nI don\u2019t really believe in souls, or at least not eternal ones, but the concept\nresonates. When I flew home from Istanbul, it did feel like some intangible\npart of me took seven months, the same period as my walk, to catch up with my\nbody again, to restore my wholeness. Perhaps I was waiting for De Botton\u2019s\n\u201cseat of the heart ... burdened by the weight of memory,\u201d or perhaps, in less\npoetic terms, I was simply processing. A pilgrimage works on two levels,\nexternal and internal, and while outwardly I was home, inwardly I was still\nplodding along, trying to make sense of what I had been through and what I had\nreturned to. Only when that process was done could the circle be completed.\n\n\u201cYou cannot know home by staying at home; you must first have gone away.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nA rich man from Baghdad loses all his wealth and is left with nothing but his\nhouse and the fountain in his garden. One night, this man has a dream: a\nmysterious figure appears and tells him that only by going to Cairo will he\nfind his fortune. But Cairo is far away, through difficult, dangerous\nterritory. So, like any sensible person, he ignores the dream.\n\nBut on the next night and the next, the figure appears again with the same\ninstructions. So the man packs his bags and sets out across the desert. When\nat last he arrives in Cairo, exhausted from the long road, he finds shelter in\na mosque, but is promptly accused by the chief of police of being part of a\nband of robbers. After being thoroughly beaten, he is thrown in prison.\n\nThere he languishes for days, until the chief of police visits him and demands\nto know why he came to Cairo, leaving his home in Baghdad behind. The traveler\ndescribes the dreams, and the chief roars with laughter. When he was young,\nthe chief says, he also had three dreams, in which a mysterious figure told\nhim to go to Baghdad. There, in such and such a district, he would find a\nhouse with a fountain in its garden. By digging underneath the fountain he\nwould find his fortune. But he ignored that foolishness: \u201cI went not; and\nthou, through the smallness of thy sense, hast journeyed from city to city on\naccount of a thing thou hast seen in sleep, when it was only the effect of\nconfused dreams.\u201d He throws the traveler some coins and tells him to go home.\n\nWhen he arrives back in Baghdad, the traveler goes straight to his garden and\nstarts digging. Sure enough, underneath the fountain, he discovers treasure.\nIt had been there all along. He lives happily ever after.\n\nThis story, based on a poem by Rumi, appears in \u201cOne Thousand and One Nights,\u201d\na volume compiled over centuries of stories from across the Middle East. Like\nthe man from Baghdad, the tale has traveled far. In an English version, a\npeddler journeys from Swaffham in Norfolk to London Bridge, only to learn that\nhis fortune lies beneath an oak tree at home. Another version is set in\nSomerset and the man is a cobbler. In an Ashkenazi Jewish variant, a rabbi\ntravels from Krakow to Prague (or from Prague to Warsaw, depending on who is\ndoing the telling).\n\nThe bones of the tale can be glimpsed in Scotland, Ireland, Denmark,\nSwitzerland, the Netherlands, Austria, Turkey and Iran. Jorge Luis Borges\nadapted the original into \u201cThe Tale of the Two Dreamers,\u201d replacing the\nfountain with a fig tree, and Paulo Coelho borrowed its structure for his\nnovel \u201cThe Alchemist,\u201d which begins with a Spanish shepherd boy\u2019s dream of\ntreasure in a ruined church.\n\n\u201cIn memories, journeys never end.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nI have been telling this story for years, mostly around campfires with\nfriends, but it is only recently that its meaning has bedded down. The man\nfrom Baghdad is not a pilgrim, but the structure of his tale maps the same\nhero\u2019s journey. He departs on a quest. He overcomes suffering to receive\nknowledge. He returns to integrate that knowledge into what he knows and gains\nnew insight into his home because of how the journey has changed him.\n\nThe moral \u2014 that true treasure lies at home \u2014 initially seems obvious, but\nwhat really strikes a chord is the deeper suggestion: that you cannot see that\ntreasure until you have seen the wider world. You cannot know home by staying\nat home; you must first have gone away.\n\nAs a travel writer, my attention has always been on the \u201caway,\u201d on setting out\ninto the desert \u2014 or the mountains, or the woods, or the streets of unknown\ntowns \u2014 rather than grubbing about beneath the soil of home. The treasure has\nalways been elsewhere; home is where I bring it back to.\n\nThe fear that I had dropped my treasure on the road or jettisoned it from the\nplane turned out to be misplaced. It was there waiting for me \u2014 I just had to\ndig for it.\n\n\u201cTo travel without arriving would be as incomplete as to arrive without having\ntraveled,\u201d Solnit wrote. Twelve years on from my unwitting pilgrimage, I\nremember raindrops falling on the Rhine, the snow of the Carpathians, the bend\nof a dusty road in Romania, sunlight glittering on the Black Sea. Solnit calls\nthese moments \u201cthe tangible landscape of memory.\u201d I consider them part of the\ndeeper meaning of home.\n\nOn some subconscious level, my feet are still on that road. In memories,\njourneys never end. This is the treasure.\n\nEnjoy the read?
