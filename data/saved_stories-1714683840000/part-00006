One of the bonuses will expire on Friday, May 10th, so\nbe sure you pre-order the book before then to get it! Hardcover, Kindle, and\nAudible all count.\n\n\"Like Ready Player One and The Social Network, but with an underlying, Liam\nNeeson 'just trying to protect my family' vibe. It's really f#@*% good.\" -\nNathan Baschez, founder of Lex\n\nWhen I told other online writers that I was working on Crypto Confidential,\none of the first questions I would get was:\n\n\u201cAre you self-publishing? Or traditionally publishing?\u201d\n\nIt was the first question I had asked myself, too, when I decided to write it.\nI\u2019d seen self-publishing influencers on Twitter discussing all the incredible\nbenefits of doing it yourself. I\u2019d seen the success of people like David\nGoggins, Eric Jorgenson, and Paul Millerd. And I\u2019d heard all the horror\nstories from people working with traditional publishers.\n\nIt felt like everywhere I looked, people were complaining about what an\noutdated, dysfunctional, obsolete industry publishing was, and how ripe it was\nfor disruption.\n\nBut... I had a nagging suspicion that I might not be getting the full story.\nThat maybe I was being lied to. That maybe traditional publishing was actually\nway better than I was being led to believe, and the critics weren\u2019t making an\nhonest representation of the pros and cons.\n\nIt turns out I was right. Traditional publishing is fantastic, and many of the\nself-publishing-influencer talking points are anywhere from misleading to\nstraight-up lies.\n\nAnd to be clear, I am not against self-publishing. There are great reasons to\ndo it, and I outline some later in the article. I don\u2019t want this to be seen\nas an anti-self-publishing piece. It isn\u2019t!\n\nI am against the self-pub influencers on Twitter and elsewhere misleading\npeople into thinking tradpub is a terrible decision.\n\nIf you\u2019re working on a book, I don\u2019t want you to be misled like I was. So\nhere\u2019s what I learned once I was on the inside.\n\n##\n\nWhy Would You Self-Publish?\n\nTo keep this fair, it\u2019s important to explain the very-convincing-sounding\narguments in favor of self-publishing before I explain why they\u2019re wrong.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard some of these before, you might even believe them!\n\n###\n\nYou Earn More with Self-Publishing\n\nWhen you traditionally publish your book, you sell the rights to publish it to\na publisher. They handle putting it together and getting it out in the world,\nand then you get paid a share of each sale.\n\nTypically, that share is 10% for paperback, 15% for hardcover, and 20-25% for\ndigital (kindle, audible, etc.).\n\nBut if you self-publish, you get much more. You\u2019ll earn 60% on paperback if\nyou publish through Kindle Direct Publishing, and you\u2019ll earn 70% on ebook.\nAudible it\u2019s less clear, but it\u2019s somewhere around 50%.\n\nThat\u2019s incredible! You\u2019ll earn 6x as much on paperback, 2-4x on digital. You\u2019d\nbe stupid not to do this.\n\nAnd this is the most important point. If you\u2019re giving up THAT much of your\nearnings on each book, then what you\u2019re getting back from a publisher would\nhave to be wayyy better than what you get self-publishing.\n\n###\n\nYou Have Creative Control\n\nEveryone\u2019s heard the horror stories about an author selling their book to a\npublisher and being so proud of it, only to have them slap on some awful\ntitle, hack together an ugly cover, and then say \u201ctoo bad we\u2019re shipping it\u201d\nwhen the author protests.\n\nIf you self-publish, no one can say no to you. You can title it whatever you\nwant, get the perfect cover art, meticulously lay it out, it\u2019s your baby.\n\n###\n\nYou\u2019re Going to Do All the Marketing Anyway\n\nTraditional publishers are these old relics of companies who think that\ngetting you in the newspaper or on TV is somehow going to help you. They might\narrange a few interviews, but you won\u2019t see any sales off of them.\n\nInstead, you\u2019re going to have to do tons of outreach to podcasts, newsletters,\nTikTok dancers, and the other people who really sell books to get your book\nout there.\n\nSince you\u2019re going to do all of the marketing anyway, selling your book to a\npublisher and making much less money per book is just dumb.\n\n###\n\nEvery World Class Editor Freelances on the Side, You Can Hire them Directly\n\nPart of why you might want to traditionally publish your book is so you get\naccess to a professional editorial team to help get your book to the finish\nline.\n\nBut all of these great editors are so strapped for cash at their normal jobs\nthat they\u2019re willing to take freelance gigs on the side. So you can simply\nemail them and ask if they can help with your book, and they\u2019ll often say yes!\n\nSo again, instead of giving up 50-75% of your revenue from the book just to\nget an editor, you can keep your money and hire the editor directly.\n\n###\n\nYou Can Build a Network On Your Own, You Don\u2019t Need the Connections\n\nThe beauty of the Internet, especially Twitter, is that it unlocks the door to\nso many opportunities for you.\n\nIf you\u2019re putting your work out there and building an audience, then you can\neasily contact professional authors or influencers to talk about your book.\nYou don\u2019t need a publisher, agent, or editor to make intros for you.\n\nPublish your work online, DM people, make friends, this isn\u2019t worth giving up\na huge chunk of your earnings for.\n\n###\n\nThe Incentives Aren\u2019t Aligned, Publishers Want You to Do All the Work While\nThey Make Most of the Money\n\nOnce a publisher has bought the rights to your book, they\u2019re going to get the\nmajority of the profit regardless of how much work they put into it.\n\nSo the incentives aren\u2019t aligned at all. They\u2019re incentivized to do as little\nas possible and let you do all the work, while they collect all the money.\n\n###\n\nSelf-Published Books Look Just as Good as Traditionally Published Books\n\nYou can hire the same cover and interior designers that the big five\npublishers use for a few thousand dollars, and then you can get your book\nprinted on demand based on those specs. And it will look just as good as a\ntraditionally published book!\n\nWhy would you give up so much of your profit for a \u201cprofessional looking book\u201d\nwhen you can make a professional-looking book on your own?\n\n###\n\nYou Can\u2019t Just \u201cBe a Writer.\u201d You Have to Be a Business Person Too\n\nGone are the days when you can just pen books, ship them off, and let a\npublisher do the rest. If you want to succeed as a writer today, you need to\nthink of your writing like a business. Your book needs to be leading to some\nlarger, more profitable purchase. You need to have other revenue streams.\n\nAnd a smart business person doesn\u2019t give up most of their profit to someone\nelse!\n\n###\n\nTraditional Publishing is Too Slow\n\nOnce you get a book deal, it might be a year or more before you turn in your\nfinal manuscript. And then even after you turn it in, it might be another year\nbefore your book is published.\n\nWhy would you waste two years getting your book out there when you could get\nit out there in 6 months?\n\n###\n\nAre You Convinced?\n\nThis sounds pretty great right?! You\u2019d be an idiot to traditionally publish\nyour book given all of these very compelling reasons.\n\nBut now let me show you why they\u2019re wrong.\n\n##\n\nThe Money Problem\n\nMany of the self-publishing arguments hinge on the idea that instead of giving\nyour book to a publisher and letting them produce it for you, you can pay\nfreelancers and use tools to get your book produced instead.\n\nWhen I talk about \u201cproduction,\u201d I\u2019m talking about:\n\n  * Editing (structural, copyediting, legal, sensitivity, etc.)\n\n  * Indexing\n\n  * Cover / spine / back design\n\n  * Interior design (fonts, kerning, spacing, page layout, chapter headers, etc.)\n\n  * Printing\n\nBasically everything that goes into turning your draft into a finished book.\n\nNow to be clear, the self-pub crowd is correct that you can do all of these\nthings on your own, and that you can hire professionals to help you with them.\n\nBut if you do that, you will end up somewhere between two poles: on one end,\nyou can do it all yourself, for free. But your book will look cheap. It will\nhave errors. The interior will look off. The cover will scream that it\u2019s a\nself-published book.\n\nIt will be clear that you did not put serious expertise and time into\nfinishing it, and if you didn\u2019t respect it enough to make it beautiful, why\nshould anyone respect it enough to read it?\n\nPicking up a book is a big commitment; you\u2019re deciding to put 4, 10, 20 hours\ninto downloading whatever\u2019s inside of it. So the production quality of the\nbook is the first test we use to decide whether it\u2019s worth our investment or\nnot.\n\nSo, recognizing that, you go in the other direction. You hire the best\neditors, the best designers, the nicest printers, you go all out to make it\nlook the best it possibly can.\n\nIn that situation, you could easily be spending $100,000 to $200,000. I know\nmany serious authors spending $100k+ on editing alone. Then you throw in\nthousands of dollars for a great cover, thousands more for an interior design,\nthousands more for legal reads and copyediting... your book is getting\nextremely expensive, and you haven\u2019t even gotten to the marketing yet! You\ndon\u2019t even know if anyone is going to pay you for this!\n\nNow, the six-figure number is extreme. I\u2019ll grant that. But unless you\u2019re\nalready a professional author who can comfortably lighten the editing load,\nyou\u2019re probably looking at a minimum of $25,000 to $50,000 to get a book done\nproperly.\n\nSo your options are to throw tens of thousands of dollars at it for the chance\nof making something that might earn back the investment. Or go cheap and make\nsomething that looks like it was slapped together by a high schooler.\n\nOr... and here\u2019s a wild thought... you work with a publisher, and they cover\nall of these costs for you!\n\nFor Crypto Confidential, here\u2019s all of the resources Portfolio committed to\nthe book:\n\n  * My editor, who did a full read with feedback three or four times over six months\n\n  * His assistant, who also did two or three full reads for feedback\n\n  * A legal editor\n\n  * Two or three copyeditors\n\n  * A cover designer\n\n  * A layout designer\n\n  * A sales team, whose job it is to get the book into stores, lists, etc., also read it for feedback on positioning.\n\n  * A PR lead who\u2019s reaching out to newspapers, traditional media, podcasts, etc.\n\n  * A marketing lead who\u2019s reaching out to influencers, preparing launch packaging, designing visual assets for the launch, etc.\n\n  * Not to mention them printing it, getting it into warehouses, managing the Amazon listing, managing all the other web listings, selling the foreign rights...\n\nIf I hired all of these people on my own, at the quality level Portfolio is\nproviding, I would easily be spending well over $100,000.\n\nBut, instead, they\u2019re paying for all of it, and they gave me a nice advance on\nthe future earnings of the book! Fantastic deal if you ask me.\n\n##\n\nYour Time & Your Limited Expertise\n\nNow you might look at that reasoning and go:\n\n\u201cSure, but after a certain number of copies you\u2019ll make much more money. You\njust have to get over the initial cost hurdle.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s correct! Sorta. The problem is that finding and managing all of\nthese people takes a considerable amount of time and energy.\n\nYou\u2019re becoming a project manager who now has to manage anywhere from three or\nfour to a dozen freelancers to get your book produced. That\u2019s a significant\nadditional mental load which is taking away from your writing time, or your\nbusiness time.\n\nOr, you do it all yourself, and now you\u2019re wasting time tweaking the fonts\ninstead of writing or running your business.\n\nWhichever route you take though, doing it yourself or hiring a team, you will\nstill have the problem of expertise. However smart and talented you think you\nare, you are not a multi-billion-dollar publishing behemoth with decades of\ninstitutional expertise on creating books that sell.\n\nPublishers aren\u2019t always right, but they know much more than the expertise you\ncobbled together from reading a few blog posts and listening to a couple\npodcasts.\n\nI\u2019ll give you one brief example from my process. The original title for Crypto\nConfidential was Is Everyone Getting Rich Without Me?\n\nI loved it, my agent loved it, my editor loved it. It was fun, piqued your\ninterest, and it was something many people have thought to themselves over the\nlast few years.\n\nBut as we neared finishing the book, the sales team started their work on it\nand came back to us saying the title had to change. It was too hard to pitch\nit, because it wasn\u2019t obvious that it was about crypto. It could have been\nabout anything.\n\nNow, one reaction I could have had would have been to go \u201cUGH THESE IDIOTS\nDON\u2019T GET IT HOW DARE THEY CHALLENGE MY ARTISTIC EXPRESSION\u201d but as I thought\nabout it I realized that the sales team knows much, much more about selling\nbooks than I do, and they were probably right. So we changed it.\n\nI lost some creative control, but that was a good thing. Because their\nexpertise is much higher than what you can get by doing it yourself or putting\ntogether a team of freelancers.\n\n##\n\nThe Network, Connections, and Media Opportunities\n\nSelf-pub maxis like to say that you can meet anyone influential just by\nbuilding an online audience, or that you can line up all the useful media\npromotion you might need by again having an online audience, but it\u2019s not\nentirely true.\n\nPodcasters, news people, influencers, and other authors will take you much\nless seriously if you self-publish your book. Anyone can do it, there\u2019s no\nbarrier to entry, and if you self-pub then it implies that you weren\u2019t good\nenough to get your book accepted by a publisher. And if you couldn\u2019t cross\nthat hurdle, or weren\u2019t willing to invest in getting that seal of approval,\nthen they\u2019re much more hesitant to take you seriously.\n\nNow, this can be overcome. But it\u2019s a much longer road. You need to have a\nsignificant amount of respect in your field already, or you need to sell a ton\nof books. You don\u2019t get the badge of approval simply for publishing it the way\nyou do in a tradpub setting.\n\nReaching out for press, trying to get other authors to endorse your book,\ntrying to get included in book reviews and traditional media roundups, it will\nall be considerably harder.\n\nAnd not only is it easier to do this outreach once you\u2019re with a traditional\npublisher, they help do a considerable amount of it for you. We have a\nspreadsheet with hundreds of podcasts, traditional media, new media, etc.\npeople we\u2019re reaching out to, and we review it every two weeks to make tweaks\nand give each other updates. It\u2019s a massive amount of outreach work and it\nwould be an incredible challenge to do on my own.\n\nAnd some people will scoff at that and say \u201cwell the data show that\ntraditional media doesn\u2019t sell books!\u201d but they\u2019re being naive. It\u2019s a narrow-\nminded view of marketing that is endemic to the online world. Legacy media has\na massive impact on book sales, but it is not attributable in the analytical\nway that we Internet people like to rely on.\n\nThink about the last 10 books that you bought. When did you buy them? Was it\nthat you clicked on a link in a podcast or something and then went and bought\nthe book, or did you hear about the book from a few people and then also on a\ncouple of podcasts?\n\nIt often takes 10+ impressions of a book before you buy it, and each of those\nimpressions is contributing to your ultimate decision. Most people do not whip\nout their phone and buy a book on Amazon when they see it in the news, yes.\nBut when they\u2019re in the bookstore or on Amazon next week and see the book that\nthey heard about while getting ready for work, they\u2019re much more likely to buy\nit than one they\u2019ve never heard of.\n\nObsessing over direct attribution is a trap that stops you from doing things\nthat move the needle long term. But it's fundamentally short-term thinking and\na big mistake when thinking about growing your audience and your sales over\ntime. All of these big connections help get your book sold, and it\u2019s much\neasier to make the connections if you\u2019re on the inside instead of the outside.\n\n##\n\nYou\u2019re a Writer, not a Business Person\n\nYou could go the route of building a business around your writing. Speaking,\ncourses, consulting, memberships.\n\nOr... you could just write. If you get good enough and publish often enough,\nyou can absolutely make an incredible living from writing. The idea that it\u2019s\nimpossible and you need to diversify is simply a defeatist mentality.\n\nAnd someone might retort by saying \u201cbut you need other income streams until\nthe writing takes off!\u201d And that\u2019s true, but they don\u2019t have to be writing\nrelated.\n\nGo work a job where you\u2019re mostly a warm body in case something comes up, and\nwrite while you\u2019re at work (that\u2019s what Sanderson did). Or work some kind of\nmanual labor that leaves your creative energy free for the evening (King).\n\nYou probably need to pay the bills, but if your goal is to BE A WRITER don\u2019t\nwaste your creative energy building a business. Spend it on writing. It\ncertainly won\u2019t be easy and it will take a long time to succeed, but it\u2019ll be\nmuch harder and much longer if you don\u2019t fully commit to it.\n\n##\n\nPublishers Are More Aligned than Freelancers\n\nOnce a publisher buys the rights to your book and pays you an advance, they\nare committing a huge amount of resources to putting your book into the world.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t sell, they lose money. And they don\u2019t want to lose money!\n\nBut a freelancer makes money whether or not your book succeeds. They\u2019re much,\nmuch less aligned with your interests than a publisher is.\n\nAnd you might say: \u201cBut publishers make most of their money from big wins and\ntheir back catalogue, not their new authors.\u201d That\u2019s true to an extent, but\nthey\u2019re always looking for the next big winner, and if you make a book that\ncould be their winner, they\u2019ll move heaven and earth to sell it.\n\nThe truth is that publishers CAN make a book succeed when they really want to,\nbut most authors DON\u2019T deliver a book the publisher ends up being that excited\nabout. The advance just gets your foot in the door. After that, you have to\nwrite something they\u2019re excited to get out there, and that they believe in. If\nyou don\u2019t do that, and they don\u2019t put as many resources behind it, that\u2019s on\nyou for delivering a poor product. Not on them.\n\nOn top of that, when you work with a publisher, you have a whole team who is\ninvested in helping you get the best possible book to the finish line. It\u2019s a\nlong, challenging process, and having people who you can talk with and bounce\nideas off of along the way helps immensely.\n\n##\n\nLast, a Note on Speed\n\nWorking with a publisher will certainly be slower than doing it yourself. I\nwas very concerned about this going into the process; it seemed like a\ncolossal waste of time.\n\nBut, I now realize it\u2019s a feature, not a bug. Having a year to work through\nfive drafts of the book was very helpful, in part because it gave me around a\nmonth in between each draft to let it sit and to let my subconscious work out\nproblems with it.\n\nAnd the nine months between when I turned it in and when it will be published\nis a good amount of time too. It let us strategically line up publicity, plan\nthe launch, get all the additional editing done, spend time on the cover and\ninterior. If I had tried to push to get the whole thing done in a year,\ninstead of two, it would have been a much worse product.\n\nA book is a product that can continue to sell for decades if you do it well.\nThat demands a certain degree of care and attention; it isn\u2019t something that\nshould be sped through like a blog post.\n\n##\n\nSo Who Should Self-Publish?\n\nNow like I said in the intro, I like self-publishing, and I do intend to do it\nat some point. I think it makes a lot of sense for certain situations.\nSpecifically:\n\n###\n\nYou TRULY Can Do It All Yourself\n\nIf you can comfortably throw $100,000 at the project, if you\u2019re already very\nwell established and can get publicity intros and make connections before the\nbook succeeds, and if you have some business built around you where other\npeople can take on managing the process, go for it.\n\nExamples: Can\u2019t Hurt Me, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant.\n\n###\n\nYou Can\u2019t Get a Good Book Deal\n\nIf you know you want to write a certain book and no one will pick it up, or\nthey\u2019ll only pick it up for a small advance, then you should probably just\nself-publish it.\n\nWith small advances, publishers put much lower resources into the success of\nthe book, and your odds of succeeding will be lower anyway.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t get it picked up at all, then there\u2019s no reason to throw it\naway. Just self-publish it. Having it out there at a lower production value is\nbetter than not having it out there at all.\n\nExamples: Tons of fiction fits in here.\n\n###\n\nYou Like the Challenge\n\nSome people could get a good book deal but they prefer the ownership, and the\nchallenge, of doing it themselves. And that\u2019s great! Admirable really.\n\nThis is honestly the main thing that attracts me to it, I just think it would\nbe a fun thing to try at some point.\n\nExamples: The War of Art, The Pathless Path\n\n###\n\nThe Book is a Business Card\n\nThis is a niche category, but it's worth mentioning. Many professionals\npublish books to secure better speaking gigs, give them to businesses, or get\nbetter consulting deals. You will always look like more of an authority in\nyour field if you\u2019re also an author in your field, and self-publishing a book\nis a great way to create that authority for yourself.\n\nIf that\u2019s you, then it\u2019s definitely worth self-publishing it, since you can\nprobably afford to do it and you don\u2019t need all of the bells and whistles of\ntraditional publishing.\n\n##\n\nThe Important Thing is to Write It\n\nAt the end of the day, whichever route you choose, the most important part is\nto write the damn book.\n\nIf you don\u2019t fit into one of those four categories I mentioned at the end, I\nstrongly believe you should try to get a trad deal.\n\nBut if your goal is to be a writer then you need to write, and you need to\npublish. Publishing it in some fashion is better than not publishing at all.\n\nThanks for reading! Remember, the first pre-order bonuses for Crypto\nConfidential will be announced next week. One of the bonuses will expire on\nFriday, May 10th, so be sure you pre-order the book before then to get it!\nHardcover, Kindle, and Audible all count.\n\n### Subscribe to Nat Eliason's Essays\n\nLaunched 2 years ago\n\nExplorations of how to live, the limits of knowledge, our relationship with\ntechnology, and finding meaning in a confusing and noisy world.
