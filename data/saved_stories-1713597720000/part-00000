There is obviously a lot more to explore there, but for now we can\nturn our attention to another significant part of the code, which is the\ndefinition of processes.\n\nWhat exactly is a process? It\u2019s ultimately a set of behaviors that create a\ntransformation from a starting point to an ending point. Swimming is not fully\ndefined by the specific strokes or movements made, but by the result. If\nyou\u2019re in the water, and you\u2019re moving through the force of your own body,\nyou\u2019re swimming, unless someone has a more specific definition, in which case\nthey\u2019ve added constraints to the process for determining membership of that\nset. Each action can be broken down into arbitrary sub-actions. These sub-\nactions are only relevant to the definition of the greater goal if they\u2019re\nexplicitly defined and promoted or inhibited. When you\u2019re walking, it really\ndoesn\u2019t matter how exactly your legs move step by step... whether you have\nsome mechanical assistance, etc. If you\u2019re taking steps, you\u2019re walking.\n\nClearly stories or re-enactments can convey some of this code\u2014that is,\ndefinitions of processes. We can see in myths the ability to convey what a\nmember of a certain role should or should not do. By using the ability of\nstories to neurally simulate an experience, a story or re-enactment can\nconstrain a persons behavior in a similar way, though less intensely, to\nactually experiencing the thing described. By repeating this over and over,\nthis constraint can be strengthened. Without language, these stories could not\nbe told orally yet, but a re-enactment could that the place of language in\nneurally simulating a narrative, and could be more effective\u2013especially paired\nwith masks or other iconic symbols, as well as music. But this presupposes the\nexistence of music, iconic symbols, and re-enactments, of which there is no\nevidence earlier than the evidence we have of language.\n\nA dance could also be used to create neural constraints, as the repetitive\nmotion would cause certain actions to be much more likely to follow others.\nThis could be used to convey and propagate skills like fighting, making\nimportant items, etc. In the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the\nbicameral mind, Jaynes suggests that the origin of language could have been a\nperson repeating a word they\u2019re hearing in their head while doing a repetitive\ntask such as making a tool. This is certainly a possibility. It\u2019s also\npossible that this repetition was done to a certain rhythm in a group, with\nmultiple people repeating their words at different rates and different\npitches. In other words, it could have been music and communal work which\ndrove the creation of processes, which are what define the relations between\nroles.\n\nA code would have defined what resources should go to members of these roles\nunder what conditions. Defining resources as belonging to a person rightfully\nby a code is primordial property rights, however this inherently defines\npublic property as well. The resources which are bestowed on a person due to\ntheir role are collective resources first, and it is through this that public\nenforcement of their rightful owner is compelled.\n\nSuch rights are relationships between roles (e.g. owner / non-owner,\nbuyer/seller, etc.). These relationships are defined by processes, and these\nprocesses must result in the constraint of behavior of participants. Some of\nthe processes they are composed of consist of: a process for identifying an\nowner. A process for transferring ownership. A process for enforcing ownership\n/ dissuading theft etc. These processes may roughly consist of those which\nidentify, or sensory processes, and those which enact some change of state, or\nmotor.\n\nBut how could these ways of creating neural constraints combine to define\nmechanisms for modifying the code itself? This would include the addition of\nnew roles, the definition of new procedures, the prohibition of certain\nprocedures, the constraint of existing procedures in the case of a participant\nbeing a member of a certain role.\n\nA mechanism for enforcement / incentivizing is shame. Religion uses this to\ngreat effect and is certainly a candidate for a primordial institution. It\nappears that religion may predate writing. Dance and reenactment appear in\nreligious rituals through many societies. These could convey shame in order to\nsuppress behaviors as a form of neural constraint. Narrative reenactment\nallows the definition of new roles, and the association of strong emotions\nlike shame, humor, or lust with certain processes, providing neural\nconstraints. This is one possible mechanism for defining and transferring\ninstitutional code in a society without language. A few of the many things\nthat merit further discussion are (1) A thorough description of how (and\nwhether) these processes could have bootstrapped language (2) an enumeration\nof more characteristic roles and processes, as well as evidence that they were\nconveying institutional \u201ccode\u201d (3) an illustration of how information flows\nthrough the system described (4) Identifying the mechanism for these \u201csensor\u201d\nand \u201cmotor\u201d processes and showing the parallel to living organisms.
