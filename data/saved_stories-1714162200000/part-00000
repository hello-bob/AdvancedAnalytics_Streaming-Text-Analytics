We could say that is a cultural\npreference in behavior, much like (apparent) German directness vs Americans\nlike myself who cannot end a conversation without saying \u201cthanks!\u201d 15 times.\nOr New Yorker efficiency (which I appreciate!)\n\nBut it\u2019s not.\n\nIn tech, it feels we are always looking for problems. We spend our time\nfighting outages and preventing them. We do code review. We try to get the\nmost done with the least amount of time possible. Everything is about not\nscrewing up.\n\nIf you have a startup you are leading, not screwing up may also mean avoiding\ncompany death, navigating political hellscapes, avoiding bad hires, and\nfighting through competition in the market. All of this involves imagining all\nthat can go wrong and trying to steer around it.\n\nI feel this does two things that aren\u2019t healthy.\n\nOne, we become focused on the negative, so we train ourselves to see flaws.\nThis focuses us to be negative by a fault, and we see this online when say,\nthere\u2019s a post about a cool article. The first comment will be a criticism of\na minor point wrong in the article, and then there will be chains of comments\ncriticizing the criticism. It\u2019s like nobody even read the article. This also\nleads to a lack of appreciation and gratitude where nobody says \u201cthat was a\nreally great idea\u201d, \u201cI like that they said this...\u201d or \u201cthanks for sharing!\u201d.\n\nTwo, we become too wired for logic, rather than meaning. I for one developed\nthis thing when talking to normal people, I can spot when the sentence\ngrammars are not constructed the way that is most efficient for communication,\nor when there is a logical flaw in the usage of \u201cand, or, or not\u201d. I spot\ncardinality errors with casual uses of phrases like \u201calways\u201d, \u201cnever\u201d,\n\u201ceveryone\u201d, or \u201cnobody\u201d. Being too wired for logic convinces us that our own\nlogic is always correct.\n\nBoth of these viewpoints I feel are strengthened by practice, at least\naccording to my theory that we get better at what we do, and slowly changed by\nwhat we read, do, and think.\n\nFurther, when in groups, we are likely to emulate the central attitude of the\ngroup and then try to apply our own spin. When we see others being too logical\nor too negative or too anxious about failure modes, we copy those behaviors,\nand there becomes a bit of an online feedback loop. Not specific to just tech,\nbut when people are online, we are subceptible to viral ideas. The original\nconcept of \u201cmemes\u201d was not about unfunny GIFs, but was about the idea that\nideas travel in their own ways. And ideas too, morph and evolve like\nbiological organisms. If tech tends to put idea-spores out into the world that\nvalidates the concept of negative and failure, those ideas rub off on us more.\n\nI\u2019d like to see more optimism because I think that\u2019s good for creativity, but\nI\u2019d also like to see people be less stuck in the future instead of the\npresent, because I think that generates anxiety and keeps people from enjoying\nthings.\n\nHow would we change our industry to make it encourage optimism and presense\nmore? That\u2019s a good question! Expressing gratitude and appreciation more is a\nstart, being less focused on velocity and roadmap, and having more time to\npour over designs and make beautiful work might be another. Allowing everyone\nto brainstorm and bring their own design into the picture may also help, so\nengineers can dream more instead of just being those responsible for avoiding\nfault and failure, and finding fault and failure in others.\n\nMaybe this theory is crazy, but maybe it\u2019s something useful to think about.\n\nI tend to think my skills in navigating a successful startup course (about\navoiding politics and disaster) set my brain up to over-optimize for thinking\nabout disaster later. Is our widespread burnout in the industry caused by a\nsimilar industrial focus on negative things? Is that one of our occupational\nhazards that we should avoid?\n\nGood question. I would say maybe yes.\n\nSome of us noticed we were sitting too long and got into standing desks and\ntaking walks and things like that. What have we done about the positivity and\nexcessive focus on testing and uptime, in lieu of creation, appreciation,\ncraftsmanship, originality, and design?\n\n### Subscribe to Michael\u2019s Substack\n\nBy Michael DeHaan\n\nMy personal Substack\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What We Train Our Brains For\n\nmichaeldehaan.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nWho Is Going To Replace Google For Us?\n\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I think Google is failing.
