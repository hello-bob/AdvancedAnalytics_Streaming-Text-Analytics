I didn\u2019t miss\ncomputers while travelling around the world. Not for a second. When you hike\nup a volcano and engorge yourself in the beautiful views only this planet can\nreward you with it\u2019s hard to think of computers let alone hacking.\n\nBut now that I\u2019m back and re-engaged my hacking mode I\u2019ve gained a whole new\nappreciation for what the act of building software gives me. I like building\nthings. Silly things. Any things. It\u2019s fun. I find it engaging and fulfilling\nfor reasons I don\u2019t quite fully understand. To be honest, I\u2019ve never really\nthought about the reasons. Is it the dopamine I get from solving problems with\ncode? Is it the feeling of accomplishment? Is it just the IKEA effect at play?\nI don\u2019t know. Frankly, I don\u2019t really care that much about the actual reasons\nbehind it. It\u2019s the effect the activity has on me what matters.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m not the only person feeling this way. Having been working with\nsome really talented folks recently who love building things at least as much\nas I do I\u2019m starting to notice a real difference between the builders and the\nLARPers. I\u2019ve never really paid much attention to it in the past, but I\u2019ve\nalways suspected LARPing can\u2019t be as satisfying as the financial rewards that\ncome with it. Builders seem happier. They find a lot of satisfaction not only\nin the building itself but equally in building with other like-minded people.\n\nI have been hacking a lot on LLMs and AI agents recently for both fun and\nprofit as part of my consulting engagements. I dont just build things on top\nof LLMs, I also build with LLMs. Sometimes it feels like pure magic other\ntimes it feels like a chore that spirals out to sheer frustration,\nparticularly when some of these models are built to be apologetic by default.\nThere is nothing that can push my buttons more than when I ask an LLM why it\u2019s\ngenerated a specific piece of the code and it responds with:\n\n> I apologise for my mistakes...\n\nNaturally, when you spend a reasonable amount of time interacting with LLMs\nyou can\u2019t help but think about where SW engineering as craft is headed. Sure,\nthe now infamous Devin demo has turned out to be a pretty cool PR stunt but\nnevertheless it did show a glimpse of things to come. Maybe not exactly as\n\u201cadvertised\u201d but if you ever used any of the existing code assistants you\ncan\u2019t help but feel the change has been put in motion. The first ripple in the\nocean has been triggered. How do we meet it at the shore?\n\nA lot of people in the industry are starting to feel the shift. Not just me.\nAt least the ones that have been paying attention and especially the ones who\nhave been building with LLMs and are learning to appreciate some of of the\npowers they can grant us if we learn to wield the LLM axe the \u201cright\u201d way\n(NOTE: I still don\u2019t think industry fully knows how to do it but the progress\nhas been steady to make prompting more like SW engineering than witchcraft)\n\nI particularly like this tweet by Darren Shepherd. He\u2019s the person who has\ncreated the GPTscript. A nifty tool that leverages LLMs for all kinds of\nfascinating SW engineering and automation tasks. He\u2019s seeing the future\nunravelling in front of his eyes better than most of us in the industry.\n\n> Perfect. That's what it always meant to be IMHO. SW is a means to an end -\n> solving [business] problems, not an industry in its own right \ud83e\udd37\u2642\ufe0f\n>\n> \u2014 Milos Gajdos (@milosgajdos) April 22, 2024\n\nMy response to Darren was a pragmatic attempt at coping with the reality.\nThough I love building software I\u2019ve always thought of SW as a means to an\nend, not the end itself. At least in a professional setting, we write software\nto solve business goals. It\u2019s an enjoyable activity for most of us who are in\nit not necessarily for the financial rewards, but also for the intrinsic\nmotivation of creating things people enjoy using.\n\nWhich is what made me think of, what happens when the thrill of building goes\naway. Not entirely but to a large extent. What happens when SW does become the\nart of prompting and assembling the results generated by specialised LLMs?\nBusinesses will naturally benefit from this shift. But what about the\nbuilders? Will the dopamine rush we get from solving a problem with code be as\nrewarding as it is when an LLM spits out the solution? Will we get the same\nsatisfaction from making things for users when we end up playing a marginal\nrole in the making itself? Perhaps. Or not. I\u2019m not sure.\n\nI\u2019m not panicking. Neither am I nostalgic about the profession that\u2019s earned\nits place in history as a craft that few of us fully understood and fewer\nstill mastered. I\u2019m merely wondering about what lies ahead. As SW engineers we\ntook pride in automating people out of their jobs. Literally. It\u2019s our turn\nnow, I suppose. At least partially. I know it\u2019s not the end. But it\u2019s\ncertainly starting to look like the end of the old ways and the beginning of\nsomething very new. The door has opened and we must walk through or we risk\nbeing left behind. But what\u2019s on the other side is yet to be seen.\n\nessay essay ai ai software engineering software engineering\n\n#### See also\n\n  * A Small Tool for Exploring Text Embeddings\n  * On The Importance of Getting The Foundations Right\n  * Fun With AI Embeddings in Go\n  * Some [career] advice for engineers\n  * A Few Counterintuitive Ideas\n\n  * \u2190 Previous Post\n\nMilos Gajdos \u2022 \u00a9 2024 \u2022 Cybernetist\n\nHugo v0.124.1 powered \u2022 Theme Beautiful Hugo adapted from Beautiful Jekyll\n\n", "frontpage": false}
