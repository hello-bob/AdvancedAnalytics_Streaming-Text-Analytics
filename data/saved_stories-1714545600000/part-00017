AI can write SQL queries for you. It can understand your database\nschema, generate SQL queries, and even interact with you to enhance them.\n\nLet's create a bot that helps you write SQL queries, and invite the bot to\nyour communication platforms, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams. It takes 20\nminutes to create this without coding.\n\nThe image below shows how it works in Slack. Awesome, isn't it?\n\n## How to Create It\n\nDon't worry. You don't need engineering knowledge to create yours.\n\nHere are the simple steps:\n\n  1. Extract database schema.\n  2. Create an Assistant using OpenAI or Anthropic.\n  3. Invite the Assistant to your communication platform using PlugBear.\n\nLet's go through one by one.\n\n### 1\\. Extracting database schema\n\nThis is the only step you may need help from engineers.\n\nYou can extract database schema in many ways. For example, you can extract\nPostgreSQL database schema using this command:\n\n    \n    \n    psql -c \"\\d *\"\n\nWith proper parameters, you will get table descriptions like this:\n\n    \n    \n    Table \"public.User\" Column | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default ------------+--------------------------------+-----------+----------+------------------- id | uuid | | not null | email | text | | not null | createdAt | timestamp(6) with time zone | | not null | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP updatedAt | timestamp(6) with time zone | | not null | firstName | text | | | lastName | text | | | orgId | text | | not null |\n\n### 2\\. Creating an Assistant\n\nIf you are a PlugBear user, simply visit the \"LLM Apps\" page and click the\n\"Create\" button to create your Assistant that uses OpenAI or Anthropic.\n\nAll you need is to write simple instructions and attach the table\ndescriptions. Here is an example:\n\n    \n    \n    You are the SQL Bot tasked with generating SQL queries based on user requests. Utilize the provided table schema to retrieve the information. Only use the specified tables and columns. Do not assume the existence of any tables or columns not listed. If you are unable to construct SQL for a given user query, acknowledge the limitation rather than producing arbitrary SQL. Table descriptions: Table \"public.User\" Column | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default ------------+--------------------------------+-----------+----------+------------------- id | uuid | | not null | email | text | | not null | createdAt | timestamp(6) with time zone | | not null | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ...\n\n### 3\\. Inviting the Assistant to your communication platform\n\nUsing PlugBear, this can be done with several clicks.\n\nClick a button to integrate your communication platform, such as Slack or\nMicrosoft Teams, connect the Assistant and the channel, and you're all set.\n\nSnow Lee\n\n, Co-founder & CEO of\n\nPlugBear\n\non April 30, 2024\n\n3\n\nLikes\n\nSay something nice to snowhale...\n\nPost Comment\n\nTrending on Indie Hackers\n\nHere's how we got our first 200 users 30 comments Reaching $100k MRR\nOrganically in 12 months 25 comments What you can learn from Marc Lou 20\ncomments Software Developers Can Build Beautiful Software 13 comments Worst\nHire - my lessons 11 comments Competing with a substitute? \ud83d\udccc Here are 4 ad\nexamples you can use [from TOP to BOTTOM of funnel] 7 comments\n\nby @csallen\n\nLearn from the founders behind hundreds of profitable online businesses, and\nconnect with others who are starting and growing their own companies.\n\n\u00a9 Indie Hackers, Inc. \u00b7 FAQ \u00b7 Terms \u00b7 Privacy \u00b7 Manage Cookies/ Policy \u00b7\n\n#### Community\n\nGroups Meetups Top Today Top This Week Top This Month Join\n\n#### Products\n\nAll Products Highest Revenue Side Projects Self-Funded Add Yours\n\n#### Learn\n\nExplore Start Here Podcasts Contribute\n\nWe use cookies to improve your experience and for marketing.
