However, it\nprovides many opportunities, and can even be dangerous.\n\n#### German Tebiev\n\nApr 26, 2024 \u2014 5 min read\n\nPeople are good at ignoring the great phenomena thanks to which we exist and\nsometimes live well. Among them are the solid ground under your feet, gravity,\nair, microorganisms, plants, and animals. Throw out any of these components,\nand there would be no us.\n\nI would like to say a little more about the air. The air is like a void for\nus, we don't see it. And the void is like air, look at the photo of a chamber\nwith vacuum created in it.\n\nNothing special is visible. Here is a rather eloquent example from the book\n\u201cBabakin Craters\u201d [1] regarding air and its absence:\n\n> And now I remember how once the radio operator Mikhail Sinitsa reported in\n> the Chief's office. \u2014 Georgy Nikolaevich, we managed to get these four\n> lamps, \u2014 Sinitsa began to speak expecting a certain impression. As soon as\n> he said this, the lamps immediately appeared in Babakin's thin fingers. It\n> seemed that they completely captured his attention. The speaker even stopped\n> silent for a while. \u2014 Yes... Babakin said, thinking about something of his\n> own. One spherical lamp, shining from the inside with a silver coating,\n> particularly interested him. \u2014 Yes... He repeated it non\u2013committally.\n> Sinitsa listed all the technical characteristics of the lamps. \u2014 That's\n> just, \u2014 he concluded, \u2014 none of them, according to technical conditions,\n> will withstand the overloads that the structural engineers gave out. In my\n> opinion, they always give it with a guaranteed margin. Babakin looked at the\n> sample he liked, squeezed it as if passing the warmth of his hand. Then he\n> put it on the table and asked indifferently: \u2014 And what exactly will not\n> stand? \u2014 Binding, as they say, of a cylinder to a base. \u2014 So what? This\n> shouldn't scare you. The lamp works on the moon, and there, as you know,\n> there is an absolute vacuum. Even if the balloon not only breaks, but also\n> evaporates, the lamp should work on the Moon. If, of course, it will only be\n> a matter of binding the cylinder with a cap.\n\nJust as the ability to notice the air, and sporadically, its absence, opens\namazing possibilities for us, so does the ability to count something. It\ncannot be said that without counting we would not have survived at all, but we\nwould have lived very differently. At least, you wouldn\u2019t be able to read\nthese lines right now. After all, if people did not put the characters in a\ncertain order, did not give each character an ordinal number and did not\nexplain to the computer how to draw each of the characters, then there would\nbe no way to write text that is displayed the same way on different devices.\n\nThe ability to count something allows you to structure your activities very\nwell. Recently, I watched my five-year-old daughter trying to solve a computer\ngame puzzle, in which you need to build a funny mechanism doing a strange job.\nSuch things are also called Rube Goldberg machines [2].\n\nAt some point, my daughter got stuck. She decided to switch to the brute force\nmethod by moving her finger quickly across the screen to try numerous options.\nBut the fun of the situation is that she tried only a few options. The speed\nof her finger movements created only the illusion of a comprehensive search.\nBut if she thought about the parts of the mechanism in terms of \u201cfirst\u201d,\n\u201csecond\u201d, ..., \u201clast\u201d, she could really try everything. It was enough just to\ncount.\n\nWhere else would it be useful to count? Where the garden plants grow.\nSometimes in the yards you can see that some plants receive proper care, and\nsome seem to miss it. A human's ability to focus on many things is not very\ndeveloped. In the process of caring for a dozen or two dozen of plants, you\ncan skip something. Missed once, missed twice, and that's it \u2014 hello, yellow\njuniper. Another thing is, if the plants are counted, numbers are assigned to\nthem.\n\nWith the numbers assigned to the plants, many things appear at once. This is\nthe order of care, from number 1 onwards in the ascending order. Furthermore,\nit\u2019s a quick identification of plants, for example, number 8 \u2014 rose. Fans of\nprocess optimization can rearrange the numbers to speed up care or minimize\nthe use of tools, for example, a pruner. Statisticians can accumulate\ninformation and quickly correspond it to a particular plant by using a number.\n\nIf this is still not impressive, then read the following story. There were\ntimes when people were horrified by the counting, or in other words, the\ncensus. Here is the evidence of the times of the Golden Horde [3]:\n\n> The population of the captured countries met the scribes with hatred. For\n> example, according to the Novgorod Chronicle, \"the common people would not\n> give their numbers for tribute,\" and the Georgian chronicles write that\n> after the census \"the entire population fell into great grief.\" The matter\n> was complicated by the fact that the local rulers uncontrollably exploited\n> the population, exhausting it with endless extortion, brutally cracking down\n> on the recalcitrant. The Golden Horde rule was imposed and supported by such\n> methods.\n\nYou can count not only clearly distinct things, but also the non-discrete\nones. All you need is a method. For example, you can count France. And no, the\nscore will not end with the word \u201cone\u201d, meaning one France on the whole Earth.\nFor the first time, France was accurately counted by the number 400 [4]:\n\n> France was the first country to undertake a national triangulation, which it\n> did in 1668. The most difficult single challenge in any triangulation is to\n> measure the baseline. Abb\u00e9 Jean Picard used an 11km stretch of straight road\n> on the outskirts of Paris, between a mill at Villejuif and the pavilion at\n> Juvigny, which he measured meticulously with wooden rods. He then headed\n> northwards, using landmarks like clock towers and the tops of hills as the\n> points of his triangles, measuring only the angles between them. When Picard\n> reached the Atlantic Ocean he discovered that the French coastline was\n> significantly nearer to Paris than had previously been thought. 'Your work\n> has cost me a major part of my realm!' harrumphed King Louis XIV. Picard's\n> triangulation continued for a century after his death, until France was\n> covered by 400 triangles. The celebrated map of the nation it produced had\n> more detail than any previously made, with almost the same scale as the\n> standard yellow Michelin tourist maps available now.\n\nAs you can see, the power of counting impressed not only common people, but\nalso by great kings.\n\nThis blog is dedicated to lists, and the demanding reader will ask, what does\na list have to do with it?! The counting forms the basis of such a phenomenon\nas an ordered list. Before reading this post, it was possible to treat it\nwithout the respect, but now that's over, I caught you in the trap of\nknowledge\ud83d\ude0b\n\nBecause of falling into this trap, you may want to start panicking and looking\ncarelessly at an unordered list. Don\u2019t be that hasty, there is another\npowerful mathematical concept behind it, the concept of a set.\n\nList of links: [1] Mikhail Borisov, \u201cBabakin Craters\u201d book (Russian \u201c\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044b\n\u0411\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0430\u201d), excerpt taken from the website \u201cEpisodes of Space\u201d (Russian).\nTranslation from Russian by German Tebiev [2] \u201cRube Goldberg machine\u201d from\n\u201cWikipedia\u201d [3] V.I.
