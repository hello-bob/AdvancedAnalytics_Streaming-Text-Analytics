It is not usable in its current state.\n  * The source code has been modified by Microsoft -- even after the publication this week -- reducing the historical value of the code.\n  * Also Microsoft claims to have lost some source code.\n\nYeah. You read that first bullet point right. It does not compile. I'll walk\nyou through the details (including a step-by-step guide for how you can fail\nto compile MS-DOS 4.0 yourself).\n\nBut, first, a little backstory.\n\n### The MS-DOS 4.0 Story (The Short, Short Version)\n\nMS-DOS 4.0, released back in 1986, was a bit of an oddity. It was a\nmultitasking version of DOS (similar in that way to Wendin-DOS). And,\nimportantly, it was not a direct continuation of the existing MS-DOS line --\nin fact \"MS-DOS 4.0\" was released between versions \"3.1\" and \"3.3\" (almost\nexactly coinciding with the \"3.2\" release).\n\nFun Side Note: There are multiple multitasking variants of DOS (or ways to\nmultitask in DOS). Most of which were not built or supplied by Microsoft. In\ncase you didn't know that... now you do.\n\nThis Multitasking MS-DOS 4.0 was not commercially successful -- to put it\nmildly -- and that line of \"Multitasking MS-DOS\" was quickly abandoned.\n\nLuckily -- or not luckily, depending on how you look at it -- IBM co-developed\na completely different version of \"MS-DOS 4.0\" that had almost nothing to do\nwith the multitasking version Microsoft created. This IBM-made version, a\ncontinuation of MS-DOS 3.x, continued to be single-tasking. But, oh-boy, was\nit buggy. Legendarily buggy.\n\nUltimately, when it was obvious that the Multitasking \"MS-DOS 4.0\" was a dead-\nend, Microsoft took IBM's totally unrelated \"MS-DOS 4.0\" and released it also\nas \"MS-DOS 4.0\". (Two different Operating Systems, same name and same version\nnumber. Because that's not at all confusing.) Then -- quickly -- re-worked a\nbunch of it -- releasing that as \"MS-DOS 4.01\".\n\nThat single-tasking version (\"4.01\") went on to have some success -- though it\nis widely regarded as one of the buggier releases of MS-DOS.\n\n### The MS-DOS 4.0 Source Release\n\nTwo totally different things named \"MS-DOS 4.0\". So what, exactly, is\nMicrosoft releasing the source code for?\n\nWell. There are two parts.\n\n  * A version of the source code for the IBM-developed, not Multitasking version of MS-DOS 4.0.\n  * An earlier Beta build of the Multitasking version of MS-DOS 4.0 (from 1984, long before it was even called \"4.0\"). No source code is available (other than for BIOS related utilities for OEMs), but there are some scanned documentation, which is nice from a historical viewpoint.\n\nFloppies of an early Beta of Multitasking MS-DOS 4.0\n\nBoth are available via GitHub. And everything is released under the MIT\nlicense.\n\nWhich means that, yes, if you can get that single-tasking 4.0 code to build...\nyou can, in theory, fork these releases and continue developing them. (Though\nyou'll need to change the name, as Microsoft still holds the trademarks.)\n\nThis work was announced in a joint blog post by Jeff Wilcox (Head of Open\nSource Programs Office) and Scott Hanselman (Vice President of Developer\nCommunity) at Microsoft.\n\nFun Side Note #2: That Vice President, Scott Hanselman, is the same Microsoft\nexecutive who has previously encouraged people to commit crimes against people\nbased on their skin color and gender. Telling people to be ready to \"go to\njail\" for those crimes. While that bit of information has absolutely nothing\nto do with the MS-DOS 4.0 source code release... it's nice to have background\non the people in the story.\n\n### What code, exactly, did we get?\n\nThis release, from Microsoft, is a valuable and interesting one. It contains a\ngreat deal of historically significant information -- and I am absolutely\nfilled to the brim with nerdy joy as I go through it.\n\nUnfortunately... it does not include code for the multitasking version of\n\"4.0\".\n\nFrom the announcement:\n\n> \"Jeff Wilcox and OSPO went to the Microsoft Archives, and while they were\n> unable to find the full source code for MT-DOS, they did find MS DOS 4.00,\n> which we\u2019re releasing today, alongside these additional beta binaries, PDFs\n> of the documentation, and disk images. We will continue to explore the\n> archives and may update this release if more is discovered.\"\n\nAs a former Microsoft employee... this is... strange. And, quite honestly, not\nat all believable.\n\nDuring my time working at Microsoft, I knew of backed up copies of source code\nfor darned near everything -- including almost every version of MS-DOS from\n3.3 onward (that I, personally, saw).\n\nYet they were unable to find code for the Multitasking MS-DOS 4.0? Knowing,\nintimately, how the various groups within Microsoft handled backing up source\ncode and binaries for releases... this statement from Microsoft makes me\nhighly skeptical.\n\nUnless Microsoft completely forgot how to backup source code in the last few\nyears, I'm going to call this claim utterly bogus.\n\n### Is it Actually MS-DOS 4.0?\n\nJust to make everything far more confusing than it already is... this may not\nactually be MS-DOS 4.0. It might be MS-DOS 4.01... or PC-DOS 4.01... or some\nstrange combination.\n\nTake a look at SETENV.BAT in the source code release and you will find the\nfollowing line:\n\n> echo setting up system to build the MS-DOS 4.01 SOURCE BAK...\n\nWhat files I have been able to build appear to exactly match the MS-DOS 4.0\n(not 4.01) release images. But, being as some of this source code release is\nmangled beyond use, unfortunately we can't really be sure that everything\nmatches the actual 4.0 release. It might be an interim build between 4.0 and\n4.01.\n\nOh! That's right.\n\nDid I mention that this source code release of MS-DOS 4.0 doesn't successfully\nbuild?\n\n### The Code Does Not Compile\n\nAllow me to repeat myself:\n\nThe code that has been supplied contains significant problems which will\nprohibit it from compiling a complete, working version of MS-DOS 4.0.\n\nI attempted build under multiple environments (including on a released version\nof MS-DOS 4.01, MS-DOS 5, PC-DOS, and under DOSBox) -- and dug through the\nerrors until I was confident of the issues (and, importantly, was confident\nthat we weren't simply looking at an obvious case of user error).\n\nERROR! ERROR!\n\nNote: If you want to skip the \"How To Build It\" portion, simply scroll down to\nthe \"BOOM! ERROR!\" section below.\n\nWant to unsuccessfully build MS-DOS 4.0 yourself? Here are some super easy to\nfollow steps.\n\n  1. Download the contents of the MS-DOS 4.0 GitHub repository.\n  2. Install DOSBox. (Seriously, this works just as well in DOSBox as it does anywhere else.)\n  3. Within DOSBox run the following command: \"MOUNT D PATH\" (replace \"PATH\" with the path to that folder you downloaded in step 1).\n\nIf you did everything correctly, you will now -- within DOSBox -- have a D:\\\ndrive with a directory named \"SRC\" in it.\n\nNote the D:\\SRC directory. That's important.\n\nThe BAT and make files which build MS-DOS 4.0 expect all of the files to be in\nD:\\SRC. So replicating that environment will make it so you don't need to\ntweak any files at all.\n\nNow we actually do the build.\n\n  1. Change to the D:\\SRC directory. \"D:\" then \"CD SRC\".\n  2. Now run \"SETENV.BAT\". This will setup the paths and whatnot for the build environment.\n  3. Then simply run \"NMAKE\". That will kick off the build for everything.\n\nEasy, right?\n\n### BOOM! ERROR!\n\nAt this point you will quickly see that several files compile cleanly. Until\nyou get to GETMSG.ASM and, later, USA.INF. Both of these files are mangled. I\nwas able to force GETMSG.ASM to compile by commenting out some lines... but\nUSA.INF is completely hosed.\n\nI don't see how whoever uploaded this source could have possibly done a\nsuccessful compile prior to releasing it.\n\nSeriously. Hosed, I say! Hosed!\n\nIt's not all bad news, luckily. The majority of the code does appear to be\nhere -- and most of it builds without any catastrophic errors. With some work\n(a replaced file here, some re-written code there) I am confident a variant on\nthis MS-DOS 4.0 release will be able to be built... unfortunately, because of\nchanges needed to make it compile, it won't be a historically perfect replica\nof the system.\n\nNot without Microsoft figuring out what they did wrong and re-releasing the\nsource code. Which, considering how rarely Microsoft releases source code for\nthese historical pieces of software... I won't be holding my breath.\n\nFun Side Note #3: After Microsoft announced the source code release of MS-DOS\n4.0, a huge number of articles have popped up on a number of Tech News sites.\nTech Journalist after Tech Journalist praising the release. Yet not one of\nthem has reported that the code does not actually compile. Which means that\nnone of them even tried to verify the claims from Microsoft. Not. One. Except\nfor The Lunduke Journal, of course. I'll let you draw your own conclusion\nabout what that means.\n\n### The historical record has been compromised... a little.\n\nIt doesn't build. That's a problem.\n\nAlso, it's kind of hard to be 100% sure what this specific release even is (is\nit 4.0... is it 4.01... is it from IBM or MS? An interim build? It looks\nmostly like 4.0... but there's some weird bits that could use clarification.).\n\nBut what makes this even worse... is that not only has some of the code been\nmangled and corrupted... but some of the code comments were actively modified\nin the few hours after the source code was publicly posted!\n\nThus further destroying the historical value of this source code. Which, to\nput it mildly, kinda sucks.\n\n### Brain-damaged Tim Patterson\n\nBut, as luck would have it, that source code change... is really, really\namusing. And pretty minor.\n\n\"Brain-damaged Tim Patterson\"\n\nA modified comment. \"Brain-damaged Tim Patterson\" becomes \"Brain-damaged TP\".\n\nIt's a simple change -- obscuring an insult of Tim Patterson (the original\ncreator of Quick & Dirty DOS)... replacing his full name with his initials.\nBut, if this is a historical record, this change should not occur.\n\nHere's a fun question: Who, exactly, made this change? Microsoft is not\naccepting any changes to this source code repository from the outside world.\nSo, whoever made the change has the blessing of Microsoft.\n\nWell, hold on to your butts!\n\nThis change was made by GitHub user \"mzbik\", with the simple comment \"MZ is\nback!\".\n\nOk. Great. But who the heck is \"MZ\"?\n\nNone other than the legendary Mark Zbikowski. One of the early Microsoft\nemployees (joining in 1981) -- and the programmer who took over the MS-DOS\nproject (from Tim Patterson) starting with version 2.0... and leading DOS\nthrough version 4.0.\n\nMark Zbikowski and his epic moustache.\n\nClearly Mark -- who usurped Tim as the Dev Lead / Manager of MS-DOS -- did not\nwant that little \"Brain-damaged\" insult of Tim to be part of the historical\nrecord.\n\nOr, perhaps, he really wanted to call attention to it by making the change.\n\nEither way, we now can be somewhat sure that Mark Zbikowski, himself, wrote\nthat comment way back in the 1980s. And, even more fascinating, Mark\nremembered that comment -- from the '80s -- so clearly that he knew to quickly\ngo and change it -- almost immediately -- once the source was made public. (I\nbarely remember source code comments I made last week, let alone almost 40\nyears ago... this really stuck with him!)\n\nAnd that level of irreverent whimsy -- one historically significant programmer\ninsulting another historically significant programmer... in source code\ncomments -- makes me smile.\n\nOk, sure. That change isn't a huge deal. In fact, I'm now glad it happened as\nit drew my attention to it.\n\nBut what else has been changed? What else will be changed? It's worth asking.\nThis is for the preservation of history, after all.\n\n### Lots and Lots of Questions\n\nIn fact, this release raises a lot of questions.\n\n  * Why was building of this source code not tested prior to release?\n  * What process caused these source code files to be mangled?\n  * What all was changed from the original source archive?\n  * Why has Microsoft only released source code for the 3 least popular versions of MS-DOS (1.25, 2.0, & 4.0)? Microsoft does not profit from versions 3.3, 5.0, or 6.x (far more popular and/or useful releases). Why are those being held back?\n  * Microsoft loves to tell people how much they love Open Source... yet they have released source code for only a very small number of products (far less than 1% of their total software releases). Even ancient software, unsuported for decades, remains closed source. Why?\n  * The last release of MS-DOS source code (versions 1.25 and 2.0) occurred 10 years ago (2014). Why has it taken 10 years to release source code that Microsoft hasn't used since the 1980s? Will the next release of source code be 10 years from now... in 2034?\n  * And, shoot, why has not one other Tech News publication actually tried to compile this code... or notice the changes being made... or look into the details at all?\n\nI don't mean to sound like a Negative Nancy, here. This release is, without a\ndoubt, incredibly interesting and important.\n\nAnd Microsoft is under no obligation to release the source code for these\npieces of software. No obligation whatsoever. If they wanted to keep it all\nlocked away in their vault, that's entirely their call.\n\nThat said, Microsoft's near constant declarations of their \"love for Open\nSource\" -- including their ownership of GitHub -- would suggest to me that\nthey would be eager to release the source for 30 and 40 year old software that\nthey haven't earned a penny on in decades.\n\nIf they truly loved the idea of \"Open Source\"... they would do it. In a\nheartbeat. But they don't. Which tells me a lot about their actual views on\n\"Open Source\".\n\n### Some things never change...\n\nWhen I worked at Microsoft -- in the late 1990s and early 2000s -- I pushed,\nregularly, to release code, binaries, and documentation of historicaly\nsignificant Microsoft software. The old stuff that nobody used anymore, but\nwhich should be preserved and studied for posterity.\n\nBack in those days, I got a lot of push-back. To put it mildly.\n\nMicrosoft management was extremely hesitant to release code -- and even free\nbinaries -- of these historic products. And, honestly, it looks like that\nsituation has barely improved since then. Shoot. What they do release doesn't\neven compile.\n\nJust the same: I applaud Microsoft for releasing this MS-DOS 4.0 code! Truly,\nI do!\n\nNow... release some more! Preferably without mangling the code this time.\n\nAnd don't give me any of that \"we can't find the code for our most famous\nproducts\" malarkey.

And their only known plan to fix it involves a\n\"Professional Shaman\" & \"sustainability, diversity, and inclusion\". Seriously.\n\nIt's no secret that many Open Source organizations struggle to fund themselves\n-- with the GNOME Foundation being on more of a shoestring budget than you\nwould expect for a project as widely used as GNOME.\n\nTo make matters worse, the GNOME Foundation has been paying for most of their\nexpenses by draining their savings account (as they spend far more than they\ntake in).\n\nNow, apparently, those savings are running out.\n\nWhat's more: The GNOME Foundation has been unusually silent about their\noperations -- not publishing any public reports for closing in on 2 years now.\nAnd their strategy to save themselves from bankruptcy appears to center around\n\"sustainability, diversity, and inclusion\".\n\nSeriously.\n\n### GNOME has \"hit the buffers\"\n\nFrom an April 26th announcement from GNOME Foundation President, Robert\nMcQueen:\n\n> \"As you may be aware, the GNOME Foundation has operated at a deficit\n> (nonprofit speak for a loss \u2013 ie spending more than we\u2019ve been raising each\n> year) for over three years, essentially running the Foundation on reserves\n> from some substantial donations received 4-5 years ago. The Foundation has a\n> reserves policy which specifies a minimum amount of money we have to keep in\n> our accounts. This is so that if there is a significant interruption to our\n> usual income, we can preserve our core operations while we work on new\n> funding sources. We\u2019ve now \u201chit the buffers\u201d of this reserves policy,\n> meaning the Board can\u2019t approve any more deficit budgets \u2013 to keep spending\n> at the same level we must increase our income.\"\n\nIn short: GNOME has run out of money. In order to \"keep spending at the same\nlevel\" GNOME needs to find some money.\n\n### What sort of money are we talking about?\n\nTo fully understand the dire straits the GNOME Foundation finds itself in,\nlet's take a look at what we know about their finances.\n\nUnfortunately, the GNOME Foundation has not published any data in close to two\nyears. They have not published an annual report for 2023, and their most\nrecent IRS records only cover their fiscal year up through September of 2022.\n\nWhich means we are forced to look at previous year's data and extrapolate\nforward based on what information we do have.\n\nSource: GNOME Foundation 2022 Annual Report\n\nIn short, total expenses for the GNOME Foundation:\n\n  * 2021: $926,821\n  * 2022: $659,537\n\nAnd the revenue for those same years...\n\n  * 2021: $286,708\n  * 2022: $363,380\n\nNotice how the expenses far exceed the revenue? Not good. Subtract the\nexpenses from the revenue and you have the net income. And, boy howdy, is it\ndeep into the negative. Which means this is the amount they need to take out\nof their savings, every year, just to keep the lights on.\n\n  * 2021: - $640,113\n  * 2022: - $296,157\n\nWe know that GNOME is burning through between $296K and $640K, of savings, per\nyear. Which begs the question... how much do they have left in terms of cash\nreserves?\n\n### The GNOME Foundation Nest Egg\n\nThe most recent information we have, on the GNOME assets, comes from their IRS\nfilings up through September of 2022 (their last publicly available filing).\n\nSource: GNOME Foundation 990 IRS Filing for September, 2022\n\nWhile those numbers don't exactly line up with the numbers stated in the GNOME\nFoundation's annual report, that's not entirely surprising. Oftentimes, for\nthese foundations, the annual reports and IRS filings will cover slightly\ndifferent time periods (and be filed at different times, when different data\nis available).\n\nJust the same, the numbers are close enough to the annual report that we can\nwork with it.\n\nBut the listed assets on this page, as of 2022, really don't give us enough\ninformation. This lists $909,107 in total net assets... but what we really\nneed to know is how much \"Savings and temporary cash investments\" they have.\n\nIn other words: How much money can GNOME get their hands on, in short notice,\nto actively use for funding their immediate expenses? For that, we'll need to\nlook a few pages further down their IRS 990 form... at this line:\n\nSource: GNOME Foundation 990 IRS Filing for September, 2022\n\nBoom. There we go. $765,011.\n\nThat's how much the GNOME Foundation had, in September of 2022, in available\nsavings.\n\n### How much money does GNOME have left... today?\n\nNow here's where we're going to need to make some assumptions based on the\ndata above.\n\nI hate making assumptions... but, considering the lack of data from the GNOME\nFoundation, we're left with no other choice.\n\nLet's assume that, in 2023, GNOME managed to keep their annual expenditures\ndown to their 2022 levels (which was far, far lower than the 2021 levels... so\nthis is close to \"best case scenario\"). And let's also assume that their\nincome stayed steady as well. How much savings would they have left?\n\nMath time. Savings minus the amount they need to withdraw from savings.\n\n  * Oct, 2022 through Sep, 2023: $765,011 - $296,157 = $468,854\n\nNow let's make the same assumption from that point (October 2023) through to\npresent (April, 2024). 7 months in total.\n\nWe know that the total amount that GNOME would need to draw from their savings\n-- every month -- is roughly $24,679.75 ($296,157, the yearly savings\nwithdrawal, divided by 12 months). Thus, to get the amount of savings they've\nspent over the last 7 months... we simply multiply that number by 7. For which\nwe get $172,758.25.\n\n  * Oct, 2023 through Apr, 2024: $468,854 - $172,758.25 = $296,095.75\n\nIn theory, that's how much money the GNOME Foundation has left in savings.\n$296,095.75.\n\nWhy is that number significant? Because that is almost exactly the amount of\nsavings they will need to withdraw to stay afloat... for one year.\n\nRemember. From the announcement this week: \"The Foundation has a reserves\npolicy which specifies a minimum amount of money we have to keep in our\naccounts.\"\n\nCould this be related to that number we came up with above? It's possible. It\ncertainly would seem reasonable. But, without better records and communication\nfrom the GNOME Foundation, we won't know for sure.\n\n### GNOME Foundation has One Year Left?\n\nIf their numbers have stayed consistent since September of 2022 -- which is a\nbig if -- this means that The GNOME Foundation has enough funds to continue\ncurrent operations through April of 2025.\n\nAt which point... the GNOME Foundation will need to significantly scale back\ntheir expenditures.\n\nThey will be forced to lay off the majority of their staff.\n\nAll of which raises a number of questions.\n\n### What is the new Executive Director doing to save GNOME?\n\nIn October of 2023, the GNOME Foundation hired a new Executive Director. A\nperson whose previous job was as a self-described \"Professional Shaman\" -- not\nreligiously associated with Shamanism, mind you, but a person who sold\n\"flavored Shaman water\" and offered paid \"Start your own Shaman business\"\ntraining.\n\nIn the half year since that time, the new GNOME Executive Director, Holly\nMillion, has had very little public presence -- no blog posts (after a short\nintroduction), no social media activity, no major interviews, no response to\npress requests... totally quiet. During the one publicly held event (a \"Meet\nand Greet\" last year), journalists were kicked out before it started and the\nplanned recording was canceled for unknown reasons.\n\nWhat has this GNOME Executive Director been doing to make sure that the GNOME\nFoundation does not go out of business? It is a mystery. Total silence.\n\nIn fact, one of the few indications we have as to the direction that the GNOME\nFoundation is taking, comes from Twitter posts by other GNOME Board members.\nNamely, one from the GNOME Vice President, stating:\n\n> \"excited about the progressive conversation we had with the executive\n> director Holly Million. We engaged in extensive discussions regarding the\n> strategic direction of @gnome, focusing on #sustainability, #diversity, and\n> #inclusion. The future looks green\"\n\nSource: Twitter account for GNOME Vice President, Regina Nkenchor\n\nFrom what little information we have, it appears that the GNOME profitability\nefforts are centered around \"sustainability, diversity, and inclusion\".\n\nOh, and \"Hashtag: Technology\". With a shamrock emoji.\n\n\"How does that result in GNOME not going out of business,\" you ask? I wish I\ncould tell you.\n\nBut, according to this week's announcement by the GNOME President, fundraising\nis one of the key reasons why Holly Million was hired away from her Shaman\njob.\n\n> \"One of the board\u2019s top priorities in hiring Holly was therefore her\n> experience in communications and fundraising, and building broader and more\n> diverse support for our mission and work. Her goals since joining \u2013 as well\n> as building her familiarity with the community and project \u2013 have been to\n> set up better financial controls and reporting, develop a strategic plan,\n> and start fundraising.\"\n\nCommunications. Fundraising. Financial reporting.\n\nThat's why their Executive Director was hired -- and those were her goals\nsince she started work over half a year ago.\n\nIn that time the GNOME Executive Director has:\n\n  * Given no interviews.\n  * Been totally radio silent (no articles, social posts, podcasts, videos... nothing).\n  * Not published any financial reports of any kind. We have no clue what GNOME has been doing, financially, for almost 2 years now.\n  * And, from what little we're being told, she has continued GNOME's deathmarch towards running out of money.\n\nThose goals again: Communications. Fundraising. Financial reporting.\n\nSounds like a massive, unmitigated failure of all three goals to me. And their\nplan to turn things around sounds like it centers on \"sustainability,\ndiversity, and inclusion\"... which is not exactly a strong business plan.\n\n### What happens now?\n\nIt sounds like things are getting desperate. And the GNOME Foundation will be\nannouncing their plan to save The GNOME Foundation in the weeks ahead.\n\n> \"The biggest prerequisite for fundraising is a clear strategy \u2013 we need to\n> explain what we\u2019re doing and why it\u2019s important, and use that to convince\n> people to support our plans. I\u2019m very pleased to report that Holly has been\n> working hard on this and meeting with many stakeholders across the\n> community, and has prepared a detailed and insightful five year strategic\n> plan. The plan defines the areas where the Foundation will prioritise,\n> develop and fund initiatives to support and grow the GNOME project and\n> community. The board has approved a draft version of this plan, and over the\n> coming weeks Holly and the Foundation team will be sharing this plan and\n> running a consultation process to gather feedback input from GNOME\n> foundation and community members.\"\n\nWhat is that plan? How likely is that plan to succeed in bringing in enough\nfunding to keep the foundation float?\n\nAt this point, we simply don't know. The GNOME Foundation -- and their\nExecutive Director -- is staying tight lipped and secretive.\n\nAll we know is that it includes \"sustainability, diversity, and inclusion\".\n\n### Wait. What about that Million Euro investment?!\n\nRight about now you might be remembering that, last year, the GNOME Foundation\nannounced that they would be receiving 1 Million Euros from the Sovereign Tech\nFund.\n\nIt sounds like those funds aren't for the foundation, but for specific\ndevelopment purposes:\n\n> \"This money is received in the form of a contract for services rather than a\n> grant to the Foundation, and must be spent on the development areas agreed\n> during the planning and application process. It\u2019s included within this\n> year\u2019s budget (October 23 \u2013 September 24) and is all expected to be spent\n> during this fiscal year, so it doesn\u2019t have an impact on the Foundation\u2019s\n> reserves position.\"\n\nIn other words: That million Euro? It won't be beefing up their savings\naccount.\n\n### What about Red Hat, SUSE, & Canonical?\n\nGNOME is heavily relied upon by some of the biggest Linux companies on Earth.\n\nRight about now it's worth considering... why haven't Red Hat (or SUSE &\nCanonical, for that matter) stepped up to provide the needed funding for the\nfoundation which supports their default Desktop Environment?\n\nMaybe they can't. Maybe they don't want to. The reason for the lack of funding\nis entirely unknown. But it's worth asking, just the same.\n\nFor that matter, where is The Linux Foundation? This seems like exactly the\nsort of thing a \"Linux\" foundation -- with over a quarter of a Billion dollars\nin annual revenue -- could do to help \"Linux\".\n\n### This isn't the first time... but...\n\nIs the GNOME Foundation poised to run out of money? It certainly appears so.\nAnd, clearly, the foundation leadership is concerned.\n\nBut this isn't the first time they've had money trouble.\n\nBack in 2014 (10 years ago), there were serious concerns about the financials\nof the GNOME Foundation. So much so that a spending freeze was put into place.\n\nGNOME survived that 2014 financial dip, just as it could certainly survive\nthis new one. Yet the actions of the GNOME Foundation raises serious concerns\nand doubts.\n\n  * Why is GNOME staying so secretive? No published plans, no communication at all from their Executive Director, no published recent reports.\n  * The only known details of their secret plan to avert a shut down are... \"sustainability, diversity, and inclusion\". That can't be real... can it? No serious software foundation would stare at possible bankruptcy... and make that a significant part of their strategy.\n  * What has the Executive Director been doing for half a year? Why hasn't there been any noteworthy fundraising or sponsorships? Considering GNOME's unique place in the Linux and Open Source world, funding GNOME should not be an issue for anyone even slightly familiar with fundraising and the Linux corporate world.\n  * Why have the large Linux & Open Source companies -- and The Linux Foundation -- not gotten involved? What's going on there?\n\nIn the coming weeks, the GNOME Foundation has said that they will announce\ndetails of their secretive plan to keep their foundation alive.\n\nFor what it's worth, The Lunduke Journal is rooting for them -- and their\nsecret plan. Whatever it may be. I truly hope it succeeds.\n\nBut, considering the bad financials and all of the other reasons outlined\nhere, I remain less than optimistic.\n\nRead full Article\n\n18\n\nView All\n\n14\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nThe Internet Archive's last-ditch effort to save itself\n\nA lost lawsuit, a flimsy appeal, and misleading public statements... things\naren't looking good for the Internet's archivist.\n\nOn April 19th, The Internet Archive filed the final brief in their appeal of\nthe \"Hachette v. Internet Archive\" lawsuit (for which, judgment was handed\ndown, against Internet Archive, last year).\n\nWhat is curious, is that this final brief fails -- almost completely -- to\nreasonably address the core issues of the lawsuit. What's more, the public\nstatements that followed, by The Internet Archive, appeared to be crafted to\ndrum up public sympathy by misrepresenting the core of the case itself.\n\nWhich suggests that The Internet Archive is very much aware that they are\nlikely to lose this appeal.\n\nAfter a careful reading of the existing public documents relating to this\ncase... it truly is difficult to come to any other conclusion.\n\nThe Internet Archive does some critically important work by archiving, and\nindexing, a wide variety of culturally significant material (from webpages to\ndecades old magazine articles). In this work, they help to preserve history. A\nextremely noble, and valuable, endeavor. Which makes the likelihood of this\nlegal defeat all the more unfortunate.\n\n### What is \"Hachette v. Internet Archive\"?\n\nHere's the short-short version of this lawsuit:\n\nThe Internet Archive created a program they called \"Controlled Digital\nLending\" (CDL) -- where a physical book is scanned, turned into a digital\nfile, and that digital file is then \"loaned\" out to people on the Internet. In\n2020, The Internet Archive removed what few restrictions existed with this\nDigital Lending program, allowing an unlimited number of people to download\nthe digital copy of a book.\n\nThe result was a group of publishers filing the \"Hachette v. Internet Archive\"\nlawsuit. That lawsuit focused on two key complaints:\n\n  1. The books were \"digitized\" (converted from physical to digital form) -- and distributed -- without the permission of the copyright holders (publishers, authors, etc.).\n  2. The Internet Archive received monetary donations (and other monetary rewards) as a result of freely distributing said copyrighted material. Again, without permission of the copyright holders. Effectively making the Internet Archive's CDL a commercial enterprise for the distribution of what is best described as \"pirated material\".\n\nThat lawsuit was decided, against The Internet Archive, in 2023 -- with the\njudge declaring that \"no case or legal principle supports\" their defense of\n\"Fair Use\".\n\nThat judgment was appealed by The Internet Archive. Which brings us to today,\nand thier final defense (in theory).\n\n### What is the final defense of The Internet Archive?\n\nLet's take a look at the final brief in The Internet Archive's bid to appeal\nthis ruling.\n\nIn true Internet Archive form, a PDF of the final brief in their appeal has\nbeen posted to Archive.org.\n\nThe general defense of The Internet Archive is fairly simple: The Internet\nArchive's \"Controlled Digital Lending\" falls under \"Fair Use\". And, therefor,\nis legal.\n\nLet's look at two of the key arguments within the brief... and the issues with\nthem.\n\n### Not \"For Anyone to Read\"\n\n> \"Controlled digital lending is not equivalent to posting an ebook online for\n> anyone to read\"\n\nThis argument -- part of the brief's Introduction -- is quite a strange\ndefense to make.\n\nThe \"Controlled Digital Lending\" program, starting in March of 2020, literally\nposted a massive book archive \"online for anyone to read\". This was branded\nthe \"National Emergency Library\".\n\nGood intentions aside, the Internet Archive is now attempting to claim that\nthey did not do... the exact thing that they proudly did (they even issued\npress releases about how they did it).\n\nAs such, I don't see a judge being swayed by this (poorly thought out)\nargument.\n\n### \"Because of the Huge Investment\"\n\n> \"... because of the huge investment required to operate a legally compliant\n> controlled lending system and the controls defining the practice, finding\n> fair use here would not trigger any of the doomsday consequences for\n> rightsholders that Publishers and their amici claim to fear.\"\n\nDid you follow that?\n\nThe argument here is roughly as follows:\n\n\"It costs a lot of money to make, and distribute, digital copies of books\nwithout the permission of the copyright holder... therefore it should be legal\nfor The Internet Archive to do it.\"\n\nAn absolutely fascinating defense. \"Someone else might not be able to commit\nthis crime, so we should be allowed to do it\" is one of the weirdest defences\nI have ever heard.\n\nAgain, I doubt the judge in this case is likely to be convinced by this logic.\n\nThere are many other arguments made within this final brief -- in total, 32\npages worth of arguments. But none were any more convincing -- from a logical\nperspective -- than the two presented here. In fact, most of the arguments\ntended to be entirely unrelated to the core lawsuit and judgment.\n\n### The Court of Public Opinion\n\nLet's be honest: The Internet Archive looks destined to lose this court\nbattle. They lost once, and their appeal is, to put it mildly, weak.\n\nMaybe you and I are on the side of The Internet Archive. Maybe we are such big\nfans of Archive.org that we want to come to their defense.\n\nBut feelings don't matter here. Only facts. And the facts are simple. The\nArchive's actions and statements (and questionable legal defense) have all but\nensured a loss in this case.\n\nSo... what happens next?\n\nWhat do you do when you have a profitable enterprise (bringing in between $20\nand $30 million per year) that is on the verge of a potentially devastating\nlegal ruling which could put you out of business?\n\nWhy, you turn to the court of public opinion, of course!\n\nAnd you spin. Spin, spin, spin. Spin like the wind!\n\nHere is a statement from Brewster Kahle, founder of The Internet Archive\", who\nis working to frame this as a fight for the rights of Libraries:\n\n> \"Resolving this should be easy\u2014just sell ebooks to libraries so we can own,\n> preserve and lend them to one person at a time. This is a battle for the\n> soul of libraries in the digital age.\"\n\nA battle for the soul of libraries! Woah! The soul?!\n\nThat's an intense statement -- clearly crafted to elicit an emotional\nresponse. To whip people up.\n\nBut take another look at the rest of that statement. The Internet Archive\nfounder says that resolving this case \"should be easy\". And he provides a\nsimple, easy-to-follow solution:\n\n> \"just sell ebooks to libraries so we can own, preserve and lend them to one\n> person at a time\"\n\nGo ahead. Read that again. At first it makes total sense... until you realize\nthat it has almost nothing to do with this specific case.\n\nLet's ignore the \"one person at a time\" statement, which is a well established\nlie (the Internet Archive proudly distributed digital copies of physical books\nto anyone who wanted them, not \"one at a time\").\n\nBut take a look at this proposed resolution... note that it has very little to\ndo with the actual case. The case is about the digitizing of physical books,\nand distributing those digital copies without permission of the copyright\nholder. This proposed resolution is about... selling eBooks to lenders.\n\nYes. Both have to do with eBooks. And, yes, both have to do with lending\neBooks.\n\nBut that is where the similarities end. And the differences, in this case, are\nabsolutely critical.\n\nLet's take a look at the actual ruling -- which The Internet Archive is\nattempting to appeal:\n\n> \"At bottom, [the Internet Archive\u2019s] fair use defense rests on the notion\n> that lawfully acquiring a copyrighted print book entitles the recipient to\n> make an unauthorized copy and distribute it in place of the print book, so\n> long as it does not simultaneously lend the print book. But no case or legal\n> principle supports that notion. Every authority points the other direction.\"\n\nThe Internet Archive's publicly proposed resolution does not address this\nruling at all. Which means that, when talking to the public, The Internet\nArchive is being dishonest about this case.\n\nBut they are using flowery language -- \"battle for the soul of libraries\" --\nso they'll likely manage to convince many people that they're telling the\ntruth and representing the facts of the case fairly and honestly. Even if they\nare not.\n\n### There Are Important Disagreements Here\n\nNone of which is to say that the points which The Internet Archive is\nmaking... are necessarily wrong.\n\nFrom the announcement of their appeal, the Archive states the following:\n\n> \"By restricting libraries\u2019 ability to lend the books they own digitally, the\n> publishers\u2019 license-only business model and litigation strategies perpetuate\n> inequality in access to knowledge.\"\n\nWhile this statement is designed to evoke specific feelings and responses --\namong specific political demographics (see: \"perpetuate inequality\") -- there\nis an underlying set of issues here that are worth thinking about.\n\n  * Is it important that libraries be able to lend official digital editions of books?\n  * Should publishers, authors, and other copyright holders be forced to supply digital versions of their written works to libraries?\n  * If digital works, borrowed from a library, are then copied and distributed more than the rights allow... who is ultimately responsible for that? The library? The creator of the software system which facilitated the lending? Nobody at all?\n  * Should Libraries or Publishers be able to censor or modify digital works... or should a published digital work be maintained as it is at time of publication? (This issue comes up a lot when talking about censorship and revisions of works.)\n\nThese are legitimate questions. And, while the answers may appear obvious,\nthere truly are distinct disagreements among publishers, authors, and\nlibraries.\n\nSome of these issues are raised by The Internet Archive,\nBattleForLibraries.com, and others.\n\nThe \"Battle for Libraries\" campaign\n\nBut none of these questions -- not one -- are part of the ruling in \"Hachette\nv. Internet Archive\".\n\nThe question that has been answered in this case is simply:\n\n  * If you buy physical media (such as a book), can that media be digitized and distributed on the Internet (without authorization or notification of the copyright owner)?\n\nAnd the answer is, thus far, a resounding... \"No\".\n\n### The Can of Worms\n\nWhat happens if the judge chooses to uphold the existing judgment against The\nInternet Archive?\n\nA number of things seems possible (with some seeming like a downright\ncertainty).\n\n  * Publishers, authors, and copyright holders of works distributed by The Internet Archive may choose to seek damages. Which could put The Internet Archive in a precarious financial position (to say the least).\n  * The Internet Archive may be forced to remove other content of questionable copyright. Including software, video, and audio archives.\n  * Other archival projects may now come under increased scrutiny... thus making it riskier to archive and distribute various types of material.\n  * And, of course, The Internet Archive could attempt to appeal the case ever higher. Which may be tricky.\n\nThen again... The Internet Archive could win this appeal.\n\nUnlikely. But, hey, weirder things have happened.\n\nRead full Article\n\n20\n\nView All\n\n19\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nRed Hat Whistleblowers say Company Ignores Ethics Violations\n\n... when those violations are in line with racist or sexist policies.\n\nOver the last several months, we've learned a great deal about the racist and\nsexist policies within Red Hat (the largest Linux company on Earth) and parent\ncompany, IBM.\n\nThis includes corporate training which teaches that \"Whiteness\" is a bad\nthing, racist \"pledge\" systems, skin-color based hiring quotas, and more.\n\nNow, thanks to whistleblowers continuing to provide leaked material to The\nLunduke Journal, we have learned that Red Hat ignores reports of corporate\nethics violations... when those violations are in line with Red Hat's\nestablished racist policies.\n\n### Red Hat's Ethics Violation Reporting System\n\nRed Hat provides only one system which allows employees to anonymously report\nethics violations: The \"Red Hat Ethics Hotline\" provided by a company named\nConvercent.\n\nThe Red Hat \"Ethics Hotline\"\n\nThe \"Ethics Hotline\" includes this note from Tom Savage, Senior Vice President\n(and General Counsel) for Red Hat:\n\n> \"Whether you speak up through this Compliance and Ethics Hotline or another\n> reporting channel, take comfort in knowing, as outlined in the Code of\n> Business Conduct and Ethics, that Red Hat is committed to protecting\n> associates from retaliation.\"\n\nFrom the Red Hat \"Ethics Hotline\"\n\nHowever, this statement from Red Hat's General Counsel appears to be untrue.\nOr, at the very least, Red Hat employees do not believe it to be true. As\nreported by whistleblowers within Red Hat, it is felt that making purely\nanonymous complaints is the \"only safe way of reporting politically sensitive\ntopics.\"\n\n### Ethics Violations Ignored by Red Hat\n\nAccording to one whistleblower, reports of ethics violations are \"always\nignored\".\n\nAnother whistleblower submitted multiple reports using the \"Ethics Hotline\",\nonly to have each one \"Closed\" with no details or resolution of any kind.\nReports were closed \"suddenly, with no notice or explanation or marking.\"\n\nThe following is a screenshot of one such ethics violation report, using the\n\"Ethics Hotline\", which has been \"Closed\" with no messages, attachments, or\nresponse of any kind.\n\nSource: Red Hat Whistleblower\n\nYou'll note that this ethics violation report deals directly with race and\nsex-based discrimination within the hiring and career advancement programs at\nRed Hat. A topic which, regardless of outcome, is the type of potential\n\"ethics violation\" (with severe legal consequences) which any company would\nwant to take seriously.\n\nYet this \"Ethics Hotline\" report -- along with several others provided to The\nLunduke Journal for review -- was marked as \"Closed\" with not so much as a\nnote explaining why.\n\nWhether it be the fault of the system being used, an issue with Red Hat\ncorporate policy, or actions of the individuals responsible for reviewing\nthese violation reports... one Red Hat whistleblower says \"there is no real\nway for employees to report ethics violations.\"\n\nWhat we know:\n\n  * Red Hat (along with parent company, IBM) has multiple racist & sexist programs -- of, at best, dubious legality -- many of which would constitute clear ethics violations.\n  * While Red Hat provides a mechanism for employees to report such ethics violations, those reports (at least when dealing with the racist & sexist actions of individiuals within the company, and corporate policy) are ignored and \"Closed\" without a stated reason.\n  * Red Hat employees feel \"unsafe\" reporting such violations in any non-anonymous way.\n\nThese facts paint a highly unsavory picture of Red Hat's commitement (or lack\nthereof) to behaving and doing business in an ethical way.\n\nAs always, The Lunduke Journal invites Red Hat (and parent company, IBM) to\nrespond if any information within this report is inaccurate in any way. The\nLunduke Journal prides itself on accurate, factual reporting and will publish\ncorrections, comments, or clarifications provided by the company.\n\n### Become a Tech Whistleblower\n\nThe Lunduke Journal takes the privacy of whistleblowers incredibly seriously\n-- we have a firm rule of never revealing any information regarding the\nidentidy of whistleblowers, and all leaked material is meticulously researched\nand scrubbed (with all possibly identifying metadata removed) prior to\npublication.\n\nDo you work in the Tech industry?
