While the campaign was popular during the tenure of the\ncountry\u2019s previous government, Invest.com is a site of a Cypriot currency\ntrading company, and has no connections whatsoever with\nInvestInMacedonia.gov.mk.\n\nStarting in 2015 and until mid-2017, Invest.com stickers were mandatory for\nall trucks, vans and buses registered in North Macedonia. These same vehicles\nwould later be driven throughout the region and Europe, and the stickers were\nmeant to showcase the country as the ideal investment destination.\n\nThe domain Invest.com was never owned by any Macedonian institution or\ncompany. It has never been part of any campaign, not excluding the \u2018Invest in\nNorth Macedonia\u2019 campaign, formerly known as \u2018Invest In Macedonia\u2019.\n\nThe domain is the property of the Cypriot company PRODIGIT INVESTMENTS LTD,\nregistered since 2012. According to the information from the corporate\nregister of Cyprus, no Macedonian citizens appears to be in a managerial\ncapacity.\n\nSome of the representatives of the Macedonian transporters thought at the time\nthat the whole ordeal wasn\u2019t a mix up, but rather \u201cselling a website and a\nscheme that should have been implemented by the lower echelons of that\ngovernment\u201d.\n\nHowever, given the fact of state of the country\u2019s digital transformation and\nknowing that the most important government website \u2018vlada.mk\u2019 has been hacked\nfor 2 years, it is hard to believe that it\u2019s all part of a scheme and\norganized manipulation. It is more likely that it is a rookie mistake that\nsimply got overlooked during the preparation process. Then, there are also the\ndecades of unwillingness of the transporters and the state to accept\nresponsibility.\n\nIT.mk has sent a request for a comment from the Agency for Foreign\nInvestments, and are yet to receive a reply.\n\n## Good idea, bad implementation\n\nThe mandatory obligation to promote the domain was first published in the\nOfficial Gazette no. 160 on October 31, 2014. In it, it clearly specifies the\nnature and the location of the message that needs to be on each transport\nvehicle. The official gazette, however, lists the correct domain\nInvestInMacedonia.com, along with the dimensions of the stickers.\n\nThe obligation stemmed from the Law on road transport. In 2017, this became a\nmandatory obligation of carriers.\n\nThe goal of the campaign, according to the Government, was to use the stickers\nto spread a message about investing in North Macedonia, as a form of a\nguerilla marketing campaign that\u2019s meant to promote the Agency for Foreign\nInvestments, the state and investment opportunities.\n\nTo this day, most of the transporters have stickers for Invest.com \u2013 a domain\nwhich, whether due to someone\u2019s mistake or some \u201cgenius marketing plan\u201d, ended\nup on the Macedonian transporters. For years, transporters have been\nadvertising the domain not only throughout the country, but also all over\nEurope.\n\nTankers of the largest Macedonian oil company Oilko also take part in the\n\u2018initiative\u2019.\n\nTo this day, it remains a mystery how the advertisements for Invest.com ended\non Macedonian transporters.\n\n## InvestInMacedonia.com promotes thai online casino\n\nThe domain InvestInMacedonia.com has become infamous due to the many\ngovernment campaigns to promote the country as an ideal opportunity for\nforeign investment.\n\nHowever, if you were to open the investinmacedonia.com domain today, you would\nvisit a site for a Thai online casino. Obviously, the domain is no longer in\nthe service of the Agency for Foreign Investments, or if it is (due to private\nregistration data, the owner is not known), the domain may have been hacked.\n\nThe Agency for Foreign Investments is active since 2005. At the beginning, the\nagency used the domain InvestInMacedonia.com. Now, however, it uses the\ndomains invest.gov.mk and investinnorthmacedonia.gov.mk.\n\nThe InvestInMacedonia.com domain has been building a reputation for years (it\nhas a domain authority of 47); it was also used for official business emails.\nThe biggest and most obvious omission is that the domain does not redirect to\nthe new invest.gov.mk domains. To this day, it simply leads to a website for a\nThai casino.\n\nInvestInMacedonia.com is still referenced on government and media sites; even\nall emails on the contact list of economic promoters of the Chamber of\nCommerce are with the domain investinmacedonia.com. You will come across the\ndomain on the private Twitter profiles such as the former Minister of Foreign\nInvestments, Gligor Tashkovic.\n\nEven if the reason for moving from the domain is due to the policy imposed by\nthe Prespa Agreement between North Macedonia and Greece, a redirect to the new\nsites would still be the best option. And, in case you were wondering,\ninvestinnorthmacedonia.com is not yet registered and is up for sale.\n\nIn addition, there are the trucks, tankers and vans with visible\nadvertisements that you can see on the Macedonian roads.\n\nWhile we are at it, we would also like to make an appeal: \u2013 if you happen to\nspot a vehicle with Invest.com while on Macedonian and foreign roads, send us\npictures and we will happily add them to our growing collection.\n\nSubscribe\n\nLogin\n\n0 Comments\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\n# related topics\n\ninvest invest in macedonia invest.com invest.gov.mk it.mk\n\n# career compass\n\nProxiad SEE\n\n#### PROJECT COORDINATOR \u2013 NETWORK ENABLEMENT LEAD WITH WITH ITALIAN OR\nSPANISH\n\nProxiad SEE\n\n#### SUPPORT CONSULTANT PROCUREMENT SOLUTIONS WITH FRENCH/ GERMAN OR SPANISH\n\nProxiad SEE\n\n#### SENIOR FRONT-END DEVELOPER WITH ANGULAR, CSS, HTML\n\nProxiad SEE\n\n#### CUSTOMER ADVISOR WITH GERMAN\n\nsee all ads on career.itlogs.com\n\n# market\n\n  * ## Promoted Job Listing\n\n$29,00 Add to cart\n\n  * ## Standard Job Listing\n\n$9,99 Add to cart\n\n  * ## PR Article\n\n$199,00 Add to cart\n\n  * ## Submit an Event\n\n$4,99 Add to cart\n\nfor full range of items visit market.itlogs.com\n\n## \u0414\u0435\u043b\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0448 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0438 \u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043b it.mk \u0441\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0443\u043c \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e.\n\n\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0443\u043c \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0458 \u043a\u0443\u043f \u0431\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0444\u0438\u0442\u0438 - \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0443\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0438\n\u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438 \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438.\n\n\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u0430\n\n#### Let\u2019s create the largest SEE tech community!
