Maybe you have allergies,\npets, or both. Perhaps you live somewhere with smog or in a region where the\nland is frequently and uncontrollably on fire. It\u2019s 2024. You don\u2019t really\nneed to explain why you want an air purifier. But which one should you get?\n\nYou narrow your request \u2014 your problem is seasonal allergies, you think \u2014 and\ntype best air purifier pollen into your search bar. Google obliges and you\nscan the results. First up is an ad for an Amazon listing with a star rating\nattached. Next up is another ad, this one for an article on a site called\nBuyersGuide.org. The page contains language about \u201cour picks\u201d and a team that\nhas spent \u201chours doing research, combing through forums, and reading consumer\nreviews\u201d but also, less visibly, a disclaimer: \u201cProducts and services that\nappear on Buyer\u2019s Guide are from companies from which Buyer\u2019s Guide receives\ncompensation.\u201d Result No. 2, in other words, is an ad for ads.\n\nOnward to result No. 3: Another ad, this one for a mysterious site,\nHealthnWell, which, when clicked, leads you, confusingly, to an imitation of\nthe same Google-search-results page hosted on HealthnWell\u2019s domain. How this\nscam works is not your concern \u2014 back.\n\nNext up is a Google \u201cfeatured snippet\u201d that sort of reads like a review \u2014\n\u201cisn\u2019t just the best air purifier ...\u201d \u2014 but is in fact an excerpt of a\nproduct description from the website of an air-purifier company. After that,\nGoogle suggests a list of questions you might have asked instead of the one\nyou submitted just seconds ago: \u201cDo air purifiers help with pollen?\u201d The\nanswer, it turns out, is \u201cyes,\u201d so you scroll on, past a set of Reddit links\nfull of deleted comments and an invitation to check out an old thread on a\nniche forum called Bogleheads, for fans of Vanguard investor John Bogle. As\nwith many Google searches these days, the first page of results is effectively\na pop-up ad that needs to be dismissed.\n\nFinally, way down the page, you start to see some familiar names: magazines,\nnewspapers, and online publications of all sorts. U.S. News & World Report\nquotes an expert and lists \u201creviews\u201d but makes no claim to have tested the\nproducts directly, and doesn\u2019t it mostly do colleges and cars anyway? \u201cThe 8\nBest Air Purifiers for Allergies of 2024,\u201d from health.com, claims to\n\u201cindependently evaluate all recommended products and services\u201d; makes\nreference to a \u201cHealth Lab,\u201d where products were tested; includes photos; and\nis written in clear, human language. Promising, but at this point, your guard\nis up \u2014 and rightly so. In February, HouseFresh, a product-recommendation site\nthat specializes in air purifiers and humidifiers, published a scathing\nassessment of its peers and competitors. Health, HouseFresh editors wrote,\nmentions testing \u201c67 air purifiers in their lab in Des Moines, Iowa, but\nsomehow, they have published zero product reviews and they don\u2019t make their\ntest data available anywhere,\u201d while the recommendations \u2014 variations of which\nwere published across Health owner Dotdash Meredith\u2019s dozens of properties,\nincluding People, Better Homes & Gardens, Real Simple, and the Spruce \u2014 are\n\u201cplagued by high-priced and underperforming units\u201d and \u201csubpar devices\u201d from\nnotorious brands with high name recognition. (Dotdash Meredith did not respond\nto a request for comment.)\n\nYou scroll deeper and deeper and deeper, through a seemingly infinite list of\nbarely distinguishable recommendations and past dozens of direct links to\nproducts you can buy, contextualized only by star ratings. Everyone suddenly\nseems to know an awful lot about Air Quality Index, not to mention phone\nbatteries, credit cards, ice cream\u2013makers, and socks. It\u2019s a familiar feeling.\nOnline spaces once plastered with ads \u2014 not just publications but social\nnetworks, too \u2014 are now full of salespeople working on commission. Product\nrecommendations have eaten the web and broken Google in the process.\nMeanwhile, the search giant is testing a plan \u2014 recommending more products\nitself \u2014 that might fix things, at least for Google.\n\nMost modern media product-recommendation sites owe at least something to the\nWirecutter, now just Wirecutter, which was created by Gizmodo editor Brian Lam\nin 2011 and purchased by the New York Times in 2016. Its proposition was\nsimple: It would publish straightforward tech recommendations from expert\neditors who knew what they were talking about, launching with short articles\nwith titles like \u201cThe Great TV I\u2019d Get\u201d \u2014 a pointedly concise, authoritative\ncounterpoint to churned out gadget coverage. It would show its work,\ndescribing research methods, asserting its writers\u2019 authority, and, when\nrelevant, sharing testing methodology. Gradually, it grew into an operation\nthat more closely resembled Consumer Reports, its clear predecessor, with a\nsizable staff, testing facilities, and, eventually, detractors invested enough\nin its credibility to argue that it had, at various points, lost its way.\n\nThe Wirecutter\u2019s most consequential feature, however, was how it made money:\naffiliate fees, mostly from Amazon. When available and competitively priced,\nrecommendations from the Wirecutter would include links to the retailer and\neventually others; if a reader ended up making a purchase, the Wirecutter\nwould get a small commission. While Amazon has offered some version of this\narrangement to partners since the mid-\u201990s, many major publishers had either\nignored it, rejected the model on ethical grounds, or scraped together modest,\nincremental income from tagged links included in the bodies of stories that\nmentioned, for example, popular books. The Wirecutter, in contrast, was\nrecommending big-ticket items directly and had started making real money. By\n2016, the site reported driving more than $150 million in purchases; it was\nreceiving commissions of a few percent and was profitable with a staff of 60.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the media was confronting a future in which social\nplatforms would not just dominate online advertising but also stop sending\ntheir audiences to \u2014 or sharing them with \u2014 publishers. Ad rates were\ncollapsing. Sponsored content wasn\u2019t paying off. Some publishers took this as\na sign to start building, or rebuilding, their subscription businesses. Others\npivoted until dizzy. Practically all of them, though, took a swing at some\nsort of affiliate business. All of us, I should say: New York launched the\nStrategist in 2016, and you can read our air-purifier recommendations here.\n(According to our editors, you should get the Coway AP-1512HH Mighty Air\nPurifier, now on sale from Amazon, which may pay us a small commission should\nyou choose to purchase it.)\n\nFrom the jump, these initiatives varied in credibility. Some simply\ncapitalized on shifting norms around taking affiliate fees to better monetize\nexisting review and service-journalism operations \u2014 lots of publications were\nand are, in some sense, fundamentally about lifestyle and stuff and had been\nmaking purchase recommendations for years. Others built commerce brands around\nenthusiast subject areas in which their publication already had competence or\nexpertise. At their best, they answered questions, called out bad products, or\nsimply indulged consumerist desire. The decline of Amazon\u2019s own interface and\nsearch tools into a junk-filled, ad-laden mess meant that even modest category\nroundups and posts promoting deals had some utility.\n\nEstablished publishers seeking relief from the whims of social-media platforms\nand a brutal advertising environment found in product recommendations steady\ngrowth and receptive audiences, especially as e-commerce became a more\ndominant mode of shopping. Today, these businesses are materially significant\n\u2014 in a 2023 survey, 41 percent of surveyed media companies said that\ne-commerce accounted for more than a fifth of their revenue, which few can\nafford to lose. It is a relatively new way in which publishers have become\nreacquainted \u2014 after social-media traffic disappeared and \u201cpivots to video\u201d\ncompleted their rotations \u2014 with queasy feelings of dependence on massive tech\ncompanies, from Facebook and Google to Amazon and, well, Google.\n\nAs commerce verticals became a standard strategy among traditional media\nbrands, lots of other players piled into the game, too. Thousands of\nentrepreneurs, ranging from domain experts looking to make a few bucks to\nlongtime internet arbitrageurs, churned out product recommendations and built\nbaby Wirecutters, vying for the same pool of potential buyers and searchers.\nSocial-media influencers were seeing the appeal, too, with extremely strong\nconnections to their audiences and fewer quaint hang-ups about kickbacks,\nconflicts of interest, or bias. Their efforts were helped by the fact that the\nplatforms on which they\u2019d found their audiences were eager to get into the\nbusiness of selling stuff, too.\n\nAt the same time, the big tech companies presiding over all this economic\nactivity were adjusting the rules and protecting their own interests. Amazon\nreserves the right to unilaterally change its affiliate policies and rates,\nand it has. Meta and TikTok established guidelines around affiliate content\nand experimented with programs of their own. Google, which is a huge source of\ntraffic for the affiliate economy, has found itself in a complicated but\nfamiliar position, trying to set guidelines and best practices around a\nlucrative category of content without giving bad actors enough information to\ngame results, making adjustments to its search algorithms that it can describe\nbut not share. (A spokesperson for Google responded, \u201cOur recent Search\nupdates are designed to surface the most helpful, high-quality content on the\nweb, from a diverse range of sites, and we\u2019ve launched specific improvements\nto show more original reviews based on expertise and first-hand experience on\nSearch. Our shopping features are designed to connect people to a wide range\nof merchants and content \u2014 including reviews \u2014 that can help make a purchase\ndecision.\u201d The spokesperson also said that the company had not increased the\nnumber of ads over the years and that its efforts have \u201ccollectively reduced\nlow-quality, unoriginal content in search results by 40%.\u201d)\n\nThis, in part, is what bothered the editors at HouseFresh: Despite the\nexistence of those narrowly targeted guidelines and policies for review and\nrecommendation content from Google, sites publishing what the company calls\n\u201cthin\u201d posts, sometimes created with the help of AI, or by piecework\ncontractors, still seemed to be floating to the top. They might do this on the\nstrength of their parent brands or by playing games with SEO, making\nconspicuous and frequent mentions of \u201ctesting,\u201d \u201cexperts,\u201d and \u201cmethodology.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s hard to say for sure \u2014 Google shares best practices, not rules, which\nit enforces privately and at its own discretion.\n\nThat there is money to be made here is now common knowledge outside the media\nindustry: Shuttered magazines and diminished legacy brands have become\nappealing to private-equity firms as pure affiliate plays. A supplemental\nbusiness model for publishers has, in other words, started reshaping the lower\nend of the content-generation industry in its image with no signs of slowing\ndown.\n\nThese sorts of recommendations are all, on some level, a reputation game. Some\npublishers are building reputations around product reviews and\nrecommendations, while others are leveraging existing reputations to recommend\nproducts their readers might be inclined to buy. Whether this amounts to\ncapitalizing on or spending down your reputation depends in large part on\nexecution.\n\nA few publishers have pushed such arrangements to their logical end point.\nLast year, Time magazine announced a brand called Time Stamped, \u201ca project to\nmake perplexing choices less perplexing by supplying our readers with trusted\nreviews and common sense information,\u201d with \u201ca rigorous process for testing\nproducts, analyzing companies,\u201d and making recommendations. In early 2024, the\nAssociated Press announced its own recommendation site, AP Buyline, as an\n\u201cinitiative designed to simplify complex consumer-made decisions by providing\nits audience with reliable evaluations and straightforward insights,\u201d based on\n\u201ca thorough method of testing items, evaluating companies and suggesting\nchoices.\u201d Both sites currently recommend money-related products and services,\nincluding credit cards, debt-consolidation loans, and insurance policies,\ncategories that can command very high commissions; the AP reportedly plans to\nexpand to home products, beauty, and fashion this month.\n\nTime Stamped and AP Buyline share strikingly similar designs, layouts, and\nsensibilities. Their content is broadly informative but timid about making\nstrong judgments or comparisons \u2014 an AP Buyline article about \u201cThe Best\nCapital One Credit Cards for 2024\u201d heartily recommends nine of them. The\nwriter credited for the article can also be found on Time Stamped writing\nabout Chase credit cards, banks, and rental-car insurance. On both sites, if\nyou look for it, you\u2019ll also find a similar disclaimer. For Time: The\ninformation presented here is created independently from the TIME editorial\nstaff. For the AP: AP Buyline\u2019s content is created independently of The\nAssociated Press newsroom. By independently, both companies mean that their\nproduct-recommendation sites are operated by a company called Taboola.\n\nIf you\u2019re aware of Taboola, it\u2019s probably from the company\u2019s infamous\n\u201cRecommended from the Web\u201d widgets, colloquially known as chumboxes, which\nhave for years shown up below and around online content (ahem) with an endless\nsupply of tantalizing and often low-quality semi-related links, some of which\nare sponsored. Over the years, Taboola, which is best understood as an\nadvertising company, became a major player in affiliate marketing, too,\nthrough its acquisition of Skimlinks, a popular service for adding affiliate\ntags to content. In 2023, it started pitching a product called Taboola Turnkey\nCommerce, which claims to offer the benefits of starting a product-\nrecommendation sub-brand minus the hassle of actually building an operation.\n\nSetting aside the question of the quality of the recommendations, the basic\narrangement is a stretch: a venerable news agency lending its brand to a\nchumbox firm to recommend credit cards in exchange for a slice of a sign-up\ncommission. Or, as the AP put it, \u201ca great opportunity to connect the\nconsumers of AP\u2019s nonpartisan, fact-based journalism with Taboola-powered\nindependent product reviews and recommendations.\u201d (The AP, which also has a\nteam of reporters doing non-commission-based personal-finance journalism on\nsimilar topics, did not return a request for comment.)\n\nArrangements like this, to give Google some credit, present an irritating\nchallenge. Here we have an organization that has been supplying hundreds of\nthousands of high-quality links to Google for years now getting into something\n... different, in a manner that might give an informed reader pause, but which\nisn\u2019t fraudulent \u2014 and which is formally and practically quite similar to more\nand less credible and authoritative information published elsewhere by a wide\nrange of brands.\n\nStill, it\u2019s largely because of Google that these arrangements are expected to\nwork and exist in the first place, and this general type of problem isn\u2019t\nremotely new \u2014 guiding and fighting with websites that are trying to succeed\nin or game the search marketplace has been a core challenge of running Google\nsince it became the dominant search engine. For years, the strange economics\nof search have conspired to turn the simplest of questions into seemingly\ninsurmountable problems, or at least bizarre spectacles. In 2011, it\u2019s\nthousands of sites competing to write the definitive article about what time\nthe Super Bowl starts; in 2024, it\u2019s thousands of sites hustling to recommend\nthe same nine air purifiers.\n\nLast month, Google began rolling out its latest comprehensive update to its\nsearch rankings. It called out a particular problem and took the rare step of\nproviding a deadline for compliance:\n\n> Sometimes, websites that have their own great content may also host low-\n> quality content provided by third parties with the goal of capitalizing on\n> the hosting site\u2019s strong reputation. For example, a third party might\n> publish payday loan reviews on a trusted educational website to gain ranking\n> benefits from the site. Such content ranking highly on Search can confuse or\n> mislead visitors who may have vastly different expectations for the content\n> on a given website.\n\nAs of May 5, such content will be considered spam. What users will see in its\nplace, however, is unclear. The Wirecutter, like Consumer Reports, is now part\nof a paid offering, meaning that in the long term, its search placement will\nlikely suffer as nonsubscribers bounce off its paywall and Google records\ntheir clicks as failures.\n\nBut whether these changes will help, for example, HouseFresh is unclear.\nBefore publishing its post, HouseFresh had seen its audience drop by 41\npercent since September, according to managing editor Gisele Navarro. Since\npublishing the post, its referrals have continued to drop, and its revenues \u2014\nrecently in the low six figures \u2014 have plunged. (In 2023, according to\ninternal metrics, about 139,000 purchases were made by visitors who had read\nHouseFresh\u2019s recommendations, and those are just the ones the company got paid\nfor.)\n\nThe messaging from Google, Navarro says, has been frustrating. \u201cWhat they say\nis \u2018The update is still rolling out.\u2019 The advice from Google so far has been\nto wait. Wait for what?\u201d As her site has disappeared from view on Google,\nNavarro has been keeping an eye on popular search terms to see what\u2019s showing\nup in its place. Legacy publishers seem to be part of Google\u2019s plan, but a\nrecent emphasis on what the company calls \u201cperspectives\u201d could also be in\nplay. Reddit content is getting high placement as it contains a lot of\nconversations about products from actual customers and users. As its\nvisibility in Google has increased, though, so has the prevalence of search-\nadjacent Reddit spam. Since the update has started rolling out, Navarro says,\nshe has \u201cseen a lot of generic review sites\u201d getting ranked with credible-\nsounding names, .org domains, and content ripped straight from Amazon reviews.\nOne vexing development is the new prominence of Quora \u2014 \u201cSo much Quora,\u201d says\nNavarro \u2014 the Q&A site that peaked in usefulness years ago and has massive\nspam and credibility problems of its own. \u201cYou can search all day and learn\nnothing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to find information inside of Walmart.\u201d\nShe\u2019s experimenting with other search engines, she says. If current trends\ncontinue, \u201cthere\u2019s no future for us in Google Search.\u201d\n\nShe might be right for reasons beyond hotly contested search rankings \u2014 the\n\u201cten blue links\u201d that have been the core of Google Search for decades. Google\nhas been testing AI-powered results with users around the world in a program\ncalled Search Generative Experience (SGE), first with users who opted in and\nmore recently on small groups of regular users. In response to a wide range of\nqueries, SGE will simply attempt to provide an answer rather than providing\nlinks or snippets of links. One area in which the product is taking shape \u2014\nand has become quite assertive in the course of my months of testing \u2014 is\nproduct recommendations. With SGE turned on, searches about air purifiers\nproduce results like this:\n\nThis is classic Google in that it attempts to reproduce, within its product, a\ncategory of content that was previously supplied by outside sites (now, Google\nwill boldly tell you what time the Super Bowl starts). Its partners have\nidentified an opportunity in its product, exploited it to an extreme, and left\nGoogle wondering, Why not us?\n\nIt\u2019s also typical of LLM-based AI products in being plausible, fuzzily sourced\nand inspired, and subtly, weirdly, but significantly off. Despite a specific\nsearch request, only one of these three recommendations is a true \u201cbudget\u201d\noption. SGE has inserted subcategories that I didn\u2019t ask for and that don\u2019t\nmake much sense: The \u201cgood for smoke\u201d purifier is, among the three listed,\nalmost certainly the least good at clearing smoke; all, one assumes, are meant\nand good for \u201chome.\u201d In SGE, links are demoted from headlines to footnotes.\nThere, we can click to reveal sources: a spammy affiliate site called A-Z\nAnimals, which has scraped together some Amazon reviews, as well as \u201cGoogle\u2019s\nShopping Data.\u201d (According to a Google spokesperson, SGE shopping features are\nstill \u201cexperimental\u201d and represent one option of many for searchers. The\ncompany says its systems \u201ctake input from various sources into consideration\u201d\nand \u201creference data from one or more sources, including web content or\nlicensed content.\u201d)\n\nFor now, Navarro is unimpressed with these AI experiments. \u201cIt\u2019s just shut-up-\nand-buy,\u201d she says \u2014 if you\u2019re doing this search in the first place, you\u2019re\nprobably looking for a bit more information. In its emphasis on aggregation,\nits reliance on outside sources of authority, and its preference for positive\ncomparison and recommendation over criticism, it also feels familiar: \u201cGoogle\nis the affiliate site now.\u201d\n\n### Tags:\n\n  * screen time\n  * google\n  * amazon\n  * the media\n  * publishing\n  * advertising\n  * marketing\n  * air purifiers\n  * More\n\nShow 6 Comments / 6 New Leave a Comment\n\nHow Product Recommendations Broke Google\n\nThings you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\n### Most Viewed Stories\n\n  1.
