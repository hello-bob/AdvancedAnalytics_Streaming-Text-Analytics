The New Yorkers were joined by a\nsimultaneous sit-in inside of Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian\u2019s office in\nSunnyvale, California. The protestors demand their company drop Project\nNimbus, a $1.2 billion contract held by Google and Amazon to provide AI and\ncloud computing services to the Israeli government and military.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nNew Google Trial Docs May Explain Why Search Sucks So Bad Now\n\nSundar Pichai Defends Google Paying Billions to Remain Top Search Engine\n\nNo Google AI Search, I Don\u2019t Need to Learn About the \u201cBenefits of Slavery\u201d\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nNo Google AI Search, I Don\u2019t Need to Learn About the \u201cBenefits of Slavery\u201d\n\n\u201cOur desired outcome would be for Google to drop Project Nimbus, and really\nall support for the Israeli military,\u201d said Cheyne Anderson, a Google software\nengineer and No Tech For Apartheid organizer in a phone interview with\nGizmodo. \u201cHow can you stand by and continue to do business as usual with the\nnews that\u2019s coming out of Gaza?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nNew Google Trial Docs May Explain Why Search Sucks So Bad Now\n\nSundar Pichai Defends Google Paying Billions to Remain Top Search Engine\n\nNo Google AI Search, I Don\u2019t Need to Learn About the \u201cBenefits of Slavery\u201d\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nNo Google AI Search, I Don\u2019t Need to Learn About the \u201cBenefits of Slavery\u201d\n\nProtestors lined outside of Google\u2019s Chelsea office on Tuesday.Photo: Maxwell\nZeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movement opposing Google\u2019s ties to the Israeli military is growing within\nthe company, Anderson tells Gizmodo. The Israeli Finance Ministry called\nGoogle and Amazon\u2019s Project Nimbus an all-encompassing cloud solution for the\ncountry\u2019s \u201cdefense establishment\u201d in 2021. No Tech for Apartheid seeks greater\ntransparency around how Israel\u2019s military is using Google\u2019s services. A Google\nDeepMind researcher told Time last week that cloud providers often have\nlimited insight into the servers of their government clients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrent and former Google employees spoke to a crowd of riled-up protestors on\nthe streets of Manhattan Tuesday. One current Google employee at the rally,\nwho asked to remain nameless, told Gizmodo that the building\u2019s security asked\nhim and other protestors to leave Google\u2019s office during their sit-in. He said\nother Googlers refused to leave, and would stay sitting until they were\nremoved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother one of the speakers was Eddie Hatfield, a 23-year old software\nengineer who Google fired last month for interrupting an executive\u2019s\npresentation by yelling \u201cNo tech for apartheid!\u201d at an Israeli tech\nconference.\n\n\u201cI absolutely think my firing was to intimidate my coworkers from doing\nsomething like this today,\u201d said Hatfield in an interview with Gizmodo with\nprotestors chanting behind him. \u201cEveryone\u2019s always asking how they can support\nme. This is what supporting me looks like.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of Tuesday\u2019s No Tech for Apartheid protest is about reinstating Hatfield.\nA Google spokesperson told The Verge that Hatfield was fired for interfering\nwith a company-sponsored event, not for the specific thing the employee\nyelled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGoogle claims Eddie was fired for interrupting another employee\u2019s\npresentation, which apparently is a greater breach of ethics than the war\nprofiteering that Google\u2019s executives engage in,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest Google or Amazon\u2019s technology has been used in\nthe killing of civilians. However, recent reporting from +972 magazine\nsuggests that Israel is using an advanced AI system called \u201cLavender\u201d to label\ncitizens in Gaza as targets on a kill list. Israel is known for using another\nAI system in warfare called \u201cThe Gospel,\u201d to select bombing targets in Gaza.\nThe cloud provider powering these AI systems is not currently known, though a\nfairly advanced computing infrastructure is likely required.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo Tech for Apartheid represents a growing concern within tech about how AI is\nused in warfare. Time previously reported that two workers quit over the\nconcerns about Google\u2019s involvement with the Israeli government. Tech has\nalways played a role in warfare, though some of Google\u2019s workers would like it\nnot to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
