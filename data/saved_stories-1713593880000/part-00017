Source: Getty.\n\nApril 19, 2024, 2:20 PM ET\n\nIn October 2003, Mark Zuckerberg created his first viral site: not Facebook,\nbut FaceMash. Then a college freshman, he hacked into Harvard\u2019s online dorm\ndirectories, gathered a massive collection of students\u2019 headshots, and used\nthem to create a website on which Harvard students could rate classmates by\ntheir attractiveness, literally and figuratively head-to-head. The site, a\nmean-spirited prank recounted in the opening scene of The Social Network, got\nso much traction so quickly that Harvard shut down his internet access within\nhours. The math that powered FaceMash\u2014and, by extension, set Zuckerberg on the\npath to building the world\u2019s dominant social-media empire\u2014was reportedly, of\nall things, a formula for ranking chess players: the Elo system.\n\nFundamentally, what an Elo rating does is predict the outcome of chess matches\nby assigning every player a number that fluctuates based purely on\nperformance. If you beat a slightly higher-ranked player, your rating goes up\na little, but if you beat a much higher-ranked player, your rating goes up a\nlot (and theirs, conversely, goes down a lot). The higher the rating, the more\nmatches you should win.\n\nThat is what Elo was designed for, at least. FaceMash and Zuckerberg aside,\npeople have deployed Elo ratings for many sports\u2014soccer, football,\nbasketball\u2014and for domains as varied as dating, finance, and primatology. If\nsomething can be turned into a competition, it has probably been Elo-ed.\nSomehow, a simple chess algorithm has become an all-purpose tool for rating\neverything. In other words, when it comes to the preferred way to rate things,\nElo ratings have the highest Elo rating.\n\nThe simplest way to rank chess players, or players in any competitive game,\nreally, is by wins and losses. But that metric is obviously flawed: For one\nthing, a mediocre player could amass an undefeated record by beating up on\nnewbies while a grand master wins some and loses some against other grand\nmasters. For another, a simple win-loss tally indicates more about how good a\nplayer has been than about how good a player is now. Even before Elo, chess\nhad a rating system that was more complex than just wins and losses, but in\nthe mid-1950s, a 13-year-old chess prodigy named Bobby Fischer broke it. He\nhad gotten so good so fast that the rankings\u2014which didn\u2019t sufficiently account\nfor the quality of a player\u2019s opposition\u2014couldn\u2019t keep up. Apparently in\nresponse, the U.S. Chess Federation convened a committee to correct these\ndeficiencies, and in 1960 adopted a system devised by a Hungarian American\nchess master and physics professor named Arpad Elo. The International Chess\nFederation followed suit a decade later.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n  * ### The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake\n\nDavid Brooks\n\n  * ### Kill Your Gas Stove\n\nSabrina Imbler\n\n  * ### How China Sees the World\n\nH. R. McMaster\n\nMore than 50 years later, Elo\u2019s is still the go-to ranking system. It has been\nmodified over time, and different chess governing bodies use slightly\ndifferent versions (some, for example, are more or less \u201cswingy\u201d to wins and\nlosses), but all of them are still close variations on the original. Elo has\nbecome the most important number in chess. \u201cWhenever anyone finds out you play\nchess, the immediate question is always, \u2018What\u2019s your rating?\u2019\u201d Nate Solon, a\nchess master and data scientist who writes a weekly chess newsletter, told me.\nThe Elo system has been modified over time, and different governing bodies use\nslightly different versions, but all of them are still close variations on the\noriginal.\n\nBut Elo ratings don\u2019t inherently have anything to do with chess. They\u2019re based\non a simple mathematical formula that works just as well for any one-on-one,\nzero-sum competition\u2014which is to say, pretty much all sports. In 1997, a\nstatistician named Bob Runyan adapted the formula to rank national soccer\nteams\u2014a project so successful that FIFA eventually adopted an Elo system for\nits official rankings. Not long after, the statistician Jeff Sagarin applied\nElo to rank NFL teams outside their official league standings. Things really\ntook off when the new ESPN-owned version of Nate Silver\u2019s 538 launched in 2014\nand began making Elo ratings for many different sports. Some sports proved\ntrickier than others. NBA basketball in particular exposed some of the\nsystem\u2019s shortcomings, Neil Paine, a stats-focused sportswriter who used to\nwork at 538, told me. It consistently underrated heavyweight teams, for\nexample, in large part because it struggled to account for the meaninglessness\nof much of the regular season and the fact that either team might not be\ntrying all that hard to win a given game. The system assumed uniform\nmotivation across every team and every game.\n\nPretty much anything, it turns out, can be framed as a one-on-one, zero-sum\ngame. You may well have been evaluated by an Elo rating without even knowing\nit. Elo ratings can be used to grade student assessments and inspect fabric.\nThey can be used to rank venture-capital firms and prioritize different kinds\nof health-care training. Until a few years ago, Tinder used Elo scores to rate\nusers by desirability and show them potential matches with similar ratings.\nComputer scientists have begun keeping an Elo-based leaderboard of large\nlanguage models. Primatologists use Elo ratings to model social-dominance\nbehaviors. At least one person has used them to decide which of their T-shirts\nto chuck.\n\nThe allure of Elo is clear: People are obsessed with data and statistics and\nranking things, and Elo provides a sense of quantitative rigor, of objective\nmeritocracy. \u201cThe good thing about it in chess is that you have this single\nnumber that captures your ability pretty accurately,\u201d Solon told me. Of course\non some level you\u2019d want something similar in other aspects of life. \u201cBut then\nthe dark side of that is that it can determine your standing within the chess\nworld and even your self-worth ... It\u2019s sort of a curse for a lot of players\nbecause they\u2019re just fixated on that number.\u201d The great thing about Elo\nratings is that you know exactly where you stand relative to everyone else,\nand the terrible thing about Elo ratings is that you know exactly where you\nstand relative to everyone else.\n\nIn truth, though, Elo doesn\u2019t guarantee anything. The rankings are only as\ngood or meritocratic as the underlying competitions. There\u2019s nothing magic\nabout them: However sophisticated your formula, if your inputs are junk, your\noutputs will be too. Last summer, someone built a website called Elo\nEverything, which does exactly what you\u2019d think it would. When you visit the\nsite, it serves up two things and asks, \u201cWhich do you rank higher?\u201d A few\nexample face-offs include the U.S. government versus spiders, testosterone\nversus crispiness, and the One Ring from Lord of the Rings versus the death of\nAdolf Hitler. Your selection affects the Elo score of the two things in\ncontention, and that in turn affects the overall leaderboard. Currently atop\nthe standings are: (1) The universe, (2) water, (3) knowledge, (4)\ninformation, and (5) love. Language, matter, and the \u201cfemale body shape\u201d were,\nas of this afternoon, locked in a three-way tie for 24th.\n\nElo himself understood the limitations of his invention. In his conception,\nits function was quite narrow: \u201cIt is a measuring tool, not a device of reward\nor punishment,\u201d he once remarked. \u201cIt is a means to compare performances,\nassess relative strength, not a carrot waved before a rabbit, or a piece of\ncandy given to a child for good behavior.\u201d Inevitably, that is what it has\nbecome.\n\nJacob Stern is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
