This addresses\n> two foundational problems in nonequilibrium quantum dynamics. (1) It sets\n> the earliest possible time for the applicability of equilibrium statistical\n> mechanics in a quantum system coupled to a bath at a finite temperature. (2)\n> It proves a version of the fast scrambling conjecture, originally motivated\n> in models associated with black holes, as a fundamental property of quantum\n> mechanics itself. Our result builds on a refinement of the energy-time\n> uncertainty principle in terms of the infinite temperature spectral form\n> factor in quantum chaos. We generalize this formulation to arbitrary initial\n> states of the bath, including finite temperature states, by mapping\n> Hamiltonian dynamics with any initial state to nonunitary dynamics at\n> infinite temperature. A regularized spectral form factor emerges naturally\n> from this procedure, whose decay is universally constrained by analyticity\n> in complex time. This establishes an exact speed limit on information\n> scrambling by the most general quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, without any\n> restrictions on locality or the nature of interactions.\n\nComments:| 4 pages + references; 11 pages + 2 figures in supplement  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-\nmech); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph);\nChaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.15403 [quant-ph]  \n(or arXiv:2404.15403v1 [quant-ph] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Amit Vikram [view email] [v1] Tue, 23 Apr 2024 18:00:01 UTC (336 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Proof of a Universal Speed Limit on Fast\nScrambling in Quantum Systems, by Amit Vikram and Laura Shou and Victor\nGalitski\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nquant-ph\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncond-mat cond-mat.stat-mech hep-th math math-ph math.MP nlin nlin.CD\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * INSPIRE HEP\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
