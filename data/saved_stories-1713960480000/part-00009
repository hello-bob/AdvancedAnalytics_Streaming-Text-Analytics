And yet, it still\nfaces the risk of losing vast amounts of customers' sensitive medical data.\n\nIn a statement sent to WIRED and other news outlets on Monday evening, Change\nHealthcare wrote that it paid a ransom to a cybercriminal group extorting the\ncompany, a hacker gang known as AlphV or BlackCat. \u201cA ransom was paid as part\nof the company\u2019s commitment to do all it could to protect patient data from\ndisclosure,\u201d the statement reads. The company's belated admission of that\npayment accompanied a new post on its website where it warns that the hackers\nmay have stolen health-related data that would \u201ccover a substantial proportion\nof people in America.\u201d\n\nCybersecurity and cryptocurrency researchers told WIRED last month that Change\nHealthcare appeared to have paid that ransom on March 1, pointing to a\ntransaction of 350 bitcoins or roughly $22 million sent into a crypto wallet\nassociated with the AlphV hackers. That transaction was first highlighted in a\nmessage on a Russian cybercriminal forum known as RAMP, where one of AlphV's\nallegedly jilted partners complained that they hadn't received their cut of\nChange Healthcare's payment. However, for weeks following that transaction,\nwhich was publicly visible on Bitcoin's blockchain and which both security\nfirm Recorded Future and blockchain analysis firm TRM Labs told WIRED had been\nreceived by AlphV, Change Healthcare repeatedly declined to confirm that it\nhad paid the ransom.\n\nChange Healthcare's confirmation of that extortion payment puts new weight\nbehind the cybersecurity industry's fears that the attack\u2014and the profit AlphV\nextracted from it\u2014will lead ransomware gangs to further target health care\ncompanies. \u201cIt 100 percent encourages other actors to target health care\norganizations,\u201d Jon DiMaggio, a researcher with cybersecurity firm Analyst1\nwho focuses on ransomware, told WIRED at the time the transaction was first\nspotted in March. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one of the industries we don\u2019t want ransomware\nactors to target\u2014especially when it affects hospitals.\u201d\n\nCompounding the situation, a conflict between hackers in the ransomware\necosystem has led to a second ransomware group claiming to possess Change\nHealthcare's stolen data and threatening to sell it to the highest bidder on\nthe dark web. Earlier this month that second group, known as RansomHub, sent\nWIRED alleged samples of the stolen data that appeared to come from Change\nHealthcare's network, including patient records and a contract with another\nhealth care company.\n\nAs of Monday, strangely, the listing for that data on RansomHub's dark-web\nsite had been taken down. Change Healthcare's post to its website, however,\nwarns that 22 screenshots of its data had been posted to the dark web by an\nunnamed hacker group, and that they included \u201cprotected health information\n(PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII),\u201d though it said it hadn't\nseen any sign that medical records like doctor's charts or full medical\nhistories for any patients were among the stolen data.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Politics\n\nThis Is the Beginning of the End of TikTok\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nNoncompetes Are Dead\u2014and Tech Workers Are Free to Roam\n\nAmanda Hoover\n\n  * Gear\n\nTesla Promises \u2018More Affordable Models\u2019 and a \u2018Cybercab\u2019\n\nAarian Marshall\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 35 Best Shows on Hulu Right Now\n\nJennifer M. Wood\n\nFor Change Healthcare and the beleaguered medical practices, hospitals, and\npatients that depend on it, the confirmation of its extortion payment to the\nhackers adds a bitter coda to an already dystopian story. AlphV's digital\nparalysis of Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, snarled\nthe insurance approval of prescriptions and medical procedures for hundreds of\nmedical practices and hospitals across the country, making it by some measures\nthe most widespread medical ransomware disruption ever. A survey of American\nMedical Association members conducted between March 26 and April 3 found that\nfour out of five clinicians had lost revenue as a result of the crisis. Many\nsaid they were using their own personal finances to cover a practice\u2019s\nexpenses. Change Healthcare, meanwhile, says it has lost $872 million to the\nincident and projects that number to rise well over a billion in the longer\nterm.\n\nChange Healthcare's confirmation of its ransom payment now appears to show\nthat much of that catastrophic fallout for the US health care system unfolded\nafter it had already paid the hackers an exorbitant sum\u2014a payment in exchange\nfor a decryption key for the systems the hackers had encrypted and a promise\nnot to leak the company's stolen data. As is often the case in ransomware\nattacks, AlphV's disruption of its systems appears to have been so widespread\nthat Change Healthcare's recovery process has extended long after it obtained\nthe decryption key designed to unlock its systems.\n\nAs ransomware payments go, $22 million wouldn't be the most that a victim has\nforked over. But it's close, says Brett Callow, a ransomware-focused security\nresearcher who spoke to WIRED about the suspected payment in March. Only a few\nrare payments, such as the $40 million paid to hackers by CNA Financial in\n2021, top that number. \u201cIt\u2019s not without precedent, but it\u2019s certainly very\nunusual,\u201d Callow said of the $22 million figure.\n\nThat $22 million injection of funds into the ransomware ecosystem further\nfuels a vicious cycle that has reached epidemic proportions. Cryptocurrency\ntracing firm Chainalysis found that in 2023, ransomware victims paid the\nhackers targeting them fully $1.1 billion, a new record. Change Healthcare's\npayment may represent only a small drop in that bucket, but it both rewards\nAlphV for its highly damaging attacks and may suggest to other ransomware\ngroups that health care companies are particularly profitable targets, given\nthose companies are especially sensitive to both the high cost of those\ncyberattacks financially and the risks they pose to patients' health.\n\nCompounding Change Healthcare's mess is an apparent double-cross within the\nransomware underground: AlphV, by all appearances, faked its own law\nenforcement takedown after receiving Change Healthcare's payment in an attempt\nto avoid sharing it with its so-called affiliates, the hackers who partner\nwith the group to penetrate victims on its behalf. The second ransomware group\nthreatening Change Healthcare, RansomHub, now claims to WIRED that they\nobtained the stolen data from those affiliates, who still want to be paid for\ntheir work.\n\nThat has created a situation where Change Healthcare's payment provides little\nassurance that its compromised data won't still be exploited by disgruntled\nhackers. \u201cThese affiliates work for multiple groups. They\u2019re concerned with\ngetting paid themselves, and there\u2019s no trust among thieves,\u201d Analyst1's\nDiMaggio told WIRED in March. \u201cIf someone screws someone else, you don\u2019t know\nwhat they\u2019re going to do with the data.\u201d\n\nAll of that means Change Healthcare still has little assurance that it has\navoided an even worse scenario than it has yet faced: paying what may be one\nof the biggest ransoms in history and still seeing its data spilled onto the\ndark web. \u201cIf it gets leaked after they paid $22 million, it\u2019s pretty much\nlike setting that money on fire,\u201d DiMaggio warned in March. \u201cThey\u2019d have\nburned that money for nothing.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
