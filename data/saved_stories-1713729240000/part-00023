Experts, though, have safety concerns.\n\nVisual: iStock / Getty Images Plus\n\nBy Christina Szalinski\n\n04.17.2024\n\nRepublish Print\n\nAbout seven years ago, Aaron Silverbook and his then-girlfriend, a biologist,\nwere perusing old scientific literature online. \u201cA romantic evening,\u201d joked\nSilverbook. That night, he came across a study from 2000 that surprised him.\nScientists had genetically engineered an oral bacterium that they said could\npossibly prevent tooth decay: \u201cI read it and sort of boggled at it and said,\n\u2018Wow, this is a cavity vaccine. Why don\u2019t we have this?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo, Silverbook tracked down the primary author, Jeffrey Hillman, a now-retired\noral biologist formerly at the University of Florida, to see if he could pick\nup the torch.\n\nIn 2023, Silverbook founded Lantern Bioworks, which made a deal with\nOragenics, the company Hillman co-founded and that owned the technology, for\nthe materials. Lantern Bioworks then launched the genetically engineered\nbacteria under the name Lumina Probiotic. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to happen in my\nlifetime,\u201d said Hillman.\n\nAbout seven years ago, Aaron Silverbook came across a study of a genetically\nengineered oral bacteria that he described as a \u201ccavity vaccine.\u201d Now, his\ncompany is launching the bacteria as a one-time home application product\ncalled Lumina Probiotic.\n\nVisual: Courtesy of Aaron Silberbook\n\nAs recently as last month, a website for the product included language about\ncavity prevention. And a previously available press kit stated that \u201ca one-\ntime brushing with this genetically modified bacteria could indefinitely\nprevent dental cavities.\u201d By the time Lumina became available for pre-orders\nlast week, however, that wording and the press kit had been removed.\nSilverbook \u2014 who does not have a background in dentistry or microbiology \u2014\ntold Undark that his lawyer advised the change in wording on the website, as\nLantern Bioworks is bringing the product to market as a cosmetic, meaning it\ncan\u2019t make health claims about Lumina. Cosmetics don\u2019t need to go through the\nsame rigorous trials a drug would. \u201cIf anything I said sounded like a medical\nclaim,\u201d Silverbook told Undark in an interview earlier this year, \u201cit wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe product can be applied to teeth as a one-time application either at home\nor by a dentist. Additional applications can \u201cexpedite inoculation,\u201d\nSilverbook wrote in a follow-up email. He said the company anticipates Lumina\nwill ship by mid-June.\n\nSome people have already received it. Silverbook said he introduced Lumina\ninto his own mouth in October of 2023, and that Lantern Bioworks has also\nprovided it to about 60 people, including attendees of Vitalia, a\nbiotechnology conference held in Honduras earlier this year. At the\nconference, Lumina was offered for $20,000 per treatment, though the pre-order\nprice has been reduced to $250 before taxes and shipping fees. (Silverbook\nwould not comment on how many people went for Lumina at the conference.)\n\nExperts, though, have safety and ethical concerns: Despite earlier efforts by\nOragenics, the treatment has never successfully moved through human clinical\ntrials. \u201cWithout human trials, you really can\u2019t determine whether it\u2019s safe or\nefficacious,\u201d said Jennifer Kuzma, a professor and co-director of the Genetic\nEngineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University. In fact,\nit\u2019s possible it could do the opposite of its original intention: She noted\nthat subtle changes in the oral microbiome might lead to more cavities or\nother problems.\n\n> \u201cI read it and sort of boggled at it and said, \u2018Wow, this is a cavity\n> vaccine. Why don\u2019t we have this?\u2019\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also no data about whether it could spread between people, which\nbrings up questions of informed consent. If someone doesn\u2019t want to risk\ntaking the untested bacteria, but kisses or shares spoons with someone who got\nthe product, would it be transmitted? No one is quite sure.\n\nAlthough Lantern Bioworks is bringing Lumina to market as a cosmetic product,\nprecisely how it should be categorized isn\u2019t entirely obvious, Kuzma points\nout: \u201cThe regulatory system isn\u2019t 100 percent clear on this.\u201d\n\nThe human mouth contains hundreds of species of bacteria that function\ntogether in a community \u2014 an oral microbiome. A healthy bacterial balance\nkeeps teeth and gums in good shape.\n\nCavities are caused by acid-producing bacteria. Several kinds of oral bacteria\ncan make acid, explained Jonathon Baker, an assistant professor of dentistry\nat Oregon Health & Science University. But one bacterium, Streptococcus\nmutans, especially wreaks havoc because it can make both acid and biofilms,\nincluding dental plaque. That sticky coating traps acid on teeth, eroding\ntooth enamel and creating cavities.\n\nIn the 1980s, Hillman discovered a naturally occurring version of S. mutans\nthat secretes the antibiotic mutacin 1140. Because mutacin broadly kills other\nspecies of bacteria, he realized it could potentially outcompete other harmful\nstrains. (It\u2019s not known how many people naturally have mutacin-producing S.\nmutans in their mouths; Hillman found this version in one sample out of 115.)\n\nAn electron microscope image of plaque-forming bacteria (red) on the enamel of\na child\u2019s tooth.

Bacteria often swap genetic material, so he also tweaked the strain to\nprevent it from taking genes from other bacteria; other bacteria can still\ntake genes from the genetically modified Streptococcus.\n\nHillman announced the new strain, called BCS3-L1, in 2000. Around that same\ntime, Oragenics sought to begin a clinical trial. But due to concerns that the\nbacteria could be transmitted between people, have unintended consequences, or\nrevert back to a cavity-causing strain, the company told The New York Times in\n2004, the Food and Drug Administration put constraints on the trial, which was\nthen never completed.\n\nHillman continued his research: A 2009 study showed that his bacteria appeared\nto colonize rats\u2019 mouths and outcompete other Streptococcus strains that can\ncontribute to tooth decay. But studies have been limited since, and Hillman\nand Oragenics eventually abandoned the project. About 12 years ago, he\nretired.\n\n> \u201cWithout human trials, you really can\u2019t determine whether it\u2019s safe or\n> efficacious.\u201d\n\nSilverbook picked up where Hillman left off: The genetically modified version\nof Streptococcus mutans is the basis of Lumina. After considering whether to\nmarket it as a cosmetic product, as teeth whiteners are, or as a probiotic,\nwhich falls under FDA regulation as a dietary supplement, Silverbook decided\nto go the cosmetic route. In the U.S., only drugs and medical devices must go\nthrough the strict process for the FDA to deem them safe and effective.\n\nThe FDA did not provide direct comment in response to a list of questions sent\nby Undark. Courtney Rhodes, an FDA spokesperson, did, however, point to the\nagency\u2019s website which notes that drugs are defined by their intended use for\n\u201cdiagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,\u201d and that\nmismarketing a product is against the law.\n\nLumina isn\u2019t the first genetically engineered bacteria to hit the market: A\ncompany called ZBiotics launched a hangover preventive probiotic in 2019. The\nsmall drink contains Bacillus subtilis bacteria, common in other probiotic\nblends, but with an added gene that helps break down acetaldehyde, a byproduct\nof alcohol linked to headaches. (There is no published evidence that it helps\nwith hangovers, nor colonizes the gut \u2014 there\u2019s only a small toxicity study in\nrats.)\n\n###### Get Our Newsletter\n\nSent Weekly\n\nLumina is different, though, in that it\u2019s a modified version of what is\ntechnically a pathogen that causes dental decay, said Paul Jensen, a\nbiomedical engineering professor who studies oral microbiology at the\nUniversity of Michigan. Other probiotic supplements are \u201cgenerally regarded as\nsafe,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cThey\u2019re usually in our food to begin with. We know that\nthey\u2019re not pathogens.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about concerns that distributing a modified bacteria could\npotentially cause harm, Silverbook responded, \u201cI think that this is not the\nkind of air-quotes pathogen that will make anything worse.\u201d\n\nHillman\u2019s goal, was to make \u201can affordable product that helps prevent a very\npainful disease,\u201d he said, \u201cbut, you want it to be safe and effective.\u201d When\nasked if more research is needed to determine its safety and effectiveness, he\nresponded \u201cI was certainly always planning to do more studies,\u201d but declined\nto comment further.\n\nSilverbook sees his product as a way to save people time and money: Dental\ncare costs $136 billion a year in the U.S. according to the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. Untreated dental infections can also be\ndangerous, \u201cand there\u2019s plenty of people who, for whatever reason, have a lot\nof trouble going to the dentist at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be really nice to\nhave something that helps with that.\u201d\n\nSilverbook stressed that he is not making a medical claim \u2014 a key strategy, he\nsaid, in terms of regulation. \u201cA lot of our regulatory system is based on\nclaims, and if you\u2019re really careful about not making a disease treatment\nclaim, then you can get around the drug safety and efficacy trials,\u201d said\nKuzma, the North Carolina State University professor.\n\nClinical trials in the U.S. are especially difficult to carry out, said Jeff\nBanas, a professor and microbiology researcher at the University of Iowa\nCollege of Dentistry, because they are expensive, take time, and face stricter\nguidelines.\n\n> \u201cIf you\u2019re really careful about not making a disease treatment claim, then\n> you can get around the drug safety and efficacy trials.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we do a clinical trial, then we are a drug and we cannot sell it unless I\nhave half a billion dollars and 10 years,\u201d Silverbook said.\n\nScott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist and professor at the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, volunteered to take Lumina after reading about\nit on a blog, and got it during a trip to Berkeley, California. He had lost\ntrust in the FDA during the pandemic, such as when the agency delayed the\nrollout of Covid tests. When he heard that Lumina might help with cavities,\nAaronson \u201cwas completely ready to believe that if something like this existed,\nthen it would not have been approved by the FDA.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave this a try simply because it was fast and easy,\u201d he wrote in an email\nto Undark. \u201cAnd the downside risk seemed negligible.\u201d\n\nJensen, the biomedical engineering professor, cautions that more research is\nneeded to show that genetically engineered microbes can improve oral health\nand don\u2019t have unintended side effects.\n\nThe antibiotic in Lumina, he noted, could potentially wipe out other\nStreptococcus species that are associated with good oral health. And there are\nother microbes at play that determine gum health. \u201cThey\u2019re not the same\nbacteria that cause tooth decay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to be worried about\nmessing up those communities at the same time.\u201d\n\nLumina Probiotic is applied to the teeth much like a toothpaste, which Lantern\nBioworks says inoculates the mouth with a type of bacteria that normally can\ncause tooth decay. This strain of the bacteria, however, is genetically\nengineered to avoid making acid and also to produce an antibiotic that kills\nharmful bacteria.\n\nVisual: Courtesy of Aaron Silberbook\n\nAdditionally, people swallow about a liter of saliva every day, meaning the S.\nmutans\u2019 antibiotic could end up in the intestine, potentially disrupting the\ngut microbiome, Jensen said. And because Lumina produces alcohol as a\nbyproduct, it\u2019s possible that might have an impact too, though the amounts are\ntiny and it\u2019s hard to know without more research, he added.\n\nIn an email to Undark, Silverbook wrote that the company has been following\nthe \u201cfifty or so\u201d people who have volunteered to take Lumina, and that no\nadverse events have been noted so far. Their follow-ups, according to\nSilverbook, consist of a self-reported survey and taking swabs to track\nwhether S. mutans has successfully colonized the mouth. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet\ndecided how long the follow up will be,\u201d Silverbook wrote in another email,\n\u201cbut we anticipate colonization of the mouth to take about two years.\u201d\nRegarding concerns about the gut microbiome, he wrote that Lumina \u201cisn\u2019t\nespecially intended to be swallowed.\u201d\n\nGiven the lack of evidence, Jensen said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I would take it.\u201d\n\nQuite a few oral probiotics have been tested in clinical trials as a solution\nfor better oral health, though none of those are genetically modified. These\nproducts aim to add beneficial bacteria to the mouth. For instance, ProBiora,\na chewable oral probiotic already available in the U.S., showed a modest\nreduction in cavities in children in one clinical trial. (ProBiora3, the\nbacterial blend in the tablets, was developed by Hillman at Oragenics.)\n\nThe Lumina microbe, though, was intended to be a kind of oral replacement\ntherapy, so that the genetically modified bacteria would fight and overtake\nbad bacteria. Replacement therapy, Hillman said, \u201cis doing what nature would\neventually do given enough time. Pathogens, especially organisms that live\nwith us on a day-to-day basis, do not want to harm their host. It\u2019s contrary\nto their own self-interest.\u201d\n\n> The antibiotic in Lumina could potentially wipe out other Streptococcus\n> species that are associated with good oral health.\n\nThough the idea isn\u2019t new, no one has made it work yet. Banas said that 10 to\n20 years ago, \u201cit seemed like every grant application or manuscript justified\ntheir work by saying, well, this can be used for replacement therapy.\u201d But he\npointed out that so far, the field hasn\u2019t seen any replacement strategies come\nto fruition. He\u2019s currently screening thousands of oral microbe strains for\npotential probiotic properties to develop an oral probiotic for children.\n\nSome experts are skeptical that introducing bacteria could successfully\ncolonize adult mouths. Once the oral microbiome is established, it\u2019s hard to\nchange, said Isamar Rivera-Ramos, a pediatric dentist and dentistry professor\nat the University of Rochester \u2014 though not impossible.\n\nIndeed, Hillman said it\u2019s not easy to introduce new bacteria into someone\u2019s\nmouth \u2014 his team was \u201cuniformly unsuccessful\u201d until they found the naturally\noccurring strain that makes mutacin 1140. Decades ago, Hillman introduced that\nstrain into his own mouth, and he said it was still there the last time he\nchecked before he retired. He added, though, that he never put the genetically\nmodified version in his mouth, or anyone else\u2019s.\n\nJensen, Baker, and Kuzma also expressed concern about the potential for the\nbacteria to be transmitted between adults, as well as children, especially\ngiven the lack of relevant data. People acquire their oral microbiome as\nchildren from caregivers and other close contacts, so if a new microbe could\ncolonize an adult\u2019s mouth, it could spread to their child.\n\n> \u201cIf you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to become pregnant,\n> consider carefully before sticking our magic tooth sauce onto your teeth.\u201d\n\nBaker said studies show that microbes transfer within families and\ncohabitating people, and noted that \u201cit\u2019s definitely possible\u201d for Lumina to\nspread. And according to Jensen, S. mutans has \u201cbeen passed from human to\nhuman since it became a species. So it\u2019s obviously very good at moving between\nhumans; otherwise, it\u2019d be an evolutionary dead end.\u201d Hillman, though, noted\nthat introducing microbes for oral replacement requires 100 to 1,000 times\nmore than would be exchanged in normal interactions.\n\nSilverbook told Undark that he is not overly concerned about the raised safety\nand ethical concerns, though he acknowledged some risks, such as the\nlikelihood for it to spread to children: \u201cIf you are pregnant, breastfeeding,\nor expecting to become pregnant, consider carefully before sticking our magic\ntooth sauce onto your teeth.\u201d\n\nChristina Szalinski is a freelance science writer with a Ph.D. in cell biology\nbased near Philadelphia.\n\n#### Share This Story\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on FlipBoard (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\nRepublish\n\nRead Next\n\nShreds of Evidence\n\n##### The Uncharted World of Emerging Pathogens\n\nBy Rene Ebersole\n\n02.14.2024\n\nShreds of Evidence\n\n##### The Story of Environmental DNA\n\nBy Peter Andrey Smith\n\n02.12.2024\n\n###### Get Our Newsletter\n\nSent Weekly\n\n  * Usage Guidelines\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Corrections\n  * Funding\n  * Submit a Proposal\n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.\nIf you continue to use this site we will assume that you are happy with it.Ok\n\nNotifications\n\n### Share this Story\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on FlipBoard (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
