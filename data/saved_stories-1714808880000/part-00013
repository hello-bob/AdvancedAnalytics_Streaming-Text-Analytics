The divide between Tesla's users\nguides and how drivers use Teslas is so notable, federal investigators cited\nit as a 'critical safety gap' when launching a recent probe into a Tesla\nrecall.\n\nWhich brings us to a California woman who said she found herself stuck inside\nher Tesla at a Chick-Fil-A parking lot while installing a vehicle update.\n\nThe TikToker, who is named Brianna Janel on her page, said she installed\nsoftware update 2024.3.10 which was estimated to take 24 minutes but ended up\ntaking around 40. Afraid to damage the car, she decided not to use the manual\nexit and wait out the process.\n\n\"Inside my car it's 103 degrees, so I'm slightly freaking out. I hope I don't\nrun out of air,\" Janel said in the initial video posted last month. \"I can't\nopen up the doors or the windows otherwise I could potentially damage my car,\nso I'm just stuck in here roasting like a frickin chicken dripping sweat.\"\n\nA message displayed on the screen of the car said that driving and charging\nwere disabled until the update was complete.\n\nShe advised viewers to not make the same mistake she did.\n\n\"My Chick-fil-A order has been done for 30 minutes. I'm literally sitting\noutside,\" she said.\n\n## TikToker regained control of car, turned on AC\n\nIn a follow-up video, she notified her followers that safely regained access\nto her vehicle and turned on air conditioning.\n\nThe interior temperature had reached 115 degrees, she added.\n\n\"I literally made it out of my car. Look I'm sweating,\" Janel said. \"The A.C.\nhas never felt so good and I\u2019ve never felt better. I feel like I just took a\nbath.\"\n\nIn the caption of the video, she said that users commented that she could have\nexited the vehicle sooner but she was \"afraid to mess up my car.\"\n\n## Tesla among many with electronic interior door release\n\nTesla isn't the only car maker that features electronic interior door release.\nOther vehicles include the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Corvette, Audi\nE-Tron, Lexus NX and the Lucid Air, according to Consumer Reports.\n\nIn fact, according to Consumer Reports, the driver of a 2006 Cadillac XLR was\ntrapped in his car for 14 hours after the battery died. Even though the\nelectronic door was inoperable without power, he could have freed himself if\nhe had known how to use the manual door release.\n\nTesla's manual release is seamlessly integrated into the front arm of the car\n-- if you don't know it's there, you could completely miss it.\n\nIt's important to note that many cars that use electronic door releases --\nwhich are more like a button to push than a door handle to pull -- don't\nactually have manual releases in the back seats. Tesla notes that some Model\nYs do not.\n\n## Driver did not feel in danger\n\nA Tesla vehicle owner for six years, Janel said she has never tried updating\nher car while she was inside.\n\nJanel tried turning on air conditioning through the mobile app but said no\ncool air was released. She read somewhere online that doing so while the power\nis off could damage the car. Had she really felt in danger she would have\nexited safely, she said.\n\nDespite the experience, she clarified that she holds no hard feelings toward\nher ride.\n\n\"I will continue to have it for years and years,\" she said. \"Do not update it\nwhen you're sitting in the car. Stick to updating it at 2 a.m. like I used to\ndo it.\"\n\nTesla recommends pulling up the manual door release found in front of the\nwindow switches \u201cin the unlikely situation when Model Y has no power.\u201d\n\nNormal operation of the door lowers the window slightly every time the door is\nopened \u2013 and raises it when closed \u2013 to avoid damage from the door frame. The\nmanual release, while opening the car, does not lower the window. It's unclear\nwhether the car windows would lower in this particular circumstance, while the\ncar technically has power and is engaged in a software update.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Tesla for comment on claims that opening the\nvehicle without power could cause damage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nShare your feedback to help improve our site!\n\n  * Help\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Subscription Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Site Map\n  * Accessibility\n  * Our Ethical Principles\n  * Responsible Disclosure\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024\n\n## About Your Privacy\n\nClicking on the \"Reject All\" Button retains the default setting of only\nstrictly necessary cookies.\n\nWe and our 77 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
