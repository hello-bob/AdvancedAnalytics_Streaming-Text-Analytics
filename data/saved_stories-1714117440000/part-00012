Do\nyou also plan to support mysql's grant command and methods of db\nadministration?\n\n16h\n\nsebsauvage @sebsauvage@framapiaf.org\n\n@tobyhede wooo.... nice !\n\n16h\n\ntimthelion @timthelion@emacs.ch\n\n@tobyhede will that mean it'll finally possible to have proper error messages\nwhen working with mysql ?\n\n16h\n\nFahri Reza @dozymoe@mastodon.social\n\n@tobyhede CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXIST ?\n\n16h\n\nobrhoff @obrhoff@chaos.social\n\n@tobyhede Jonah Harris is the CTO of MariaDB? Does it mean it's dead?\n\n15h\n\nAndrew (LinuxJedi) Hutchings @LinuxJedi@fosstodon.org\n\n@obrhoff @tobyhede he left as the CTO of MariaDB Plc. No, it is definitely not\ndead. Also, the MariaDB Foundation exists to keep MariaDB Server development\ngoing. We work with the Plc, but are a completely separate entity.\n\n15h\n\nLovis IX @lovisix@social.zdx.fr\n\n@tobyhede\n\nWhaou, that's great. Congratulation\n\n15h\n\nOtto Rask @ojrask@piipitin.fi\n\n@tobyhede\n\nOn the flipside this also could allow teams to shift from PostgreSQL towards\nMySQL/MariaDB as well!\n\n14h\n\nManami @reticence@mastodon.social\n\n@tobyhede super exciting!\n\n13h\n\nDaniel Casanueva @danielcasanueva@mastodon.social\n\n@tobyhede Excuse my ignorance, but this all assumes that PostgreSQL is just\nbetter than MySQL and that you should use PostgreSQL if given the option. I'm\nno database expert. Can someone kind explain to me in which way PostgreSQL is\nbetter? Is this for all use cases? Thanks.\n\n12h\n\nLatte macchiato @privateger@plasmatrap.com\n\n@danielcasanueva@mastodon.social @tobyhede@hachyderm.io Full ACID compliance,\nmassively more advanced indexes, NoSQL (JSONB) support, stored procedures in\nmultiple languages, more powerful triggers, support for full concurrency on\nboth reads and writes (MVCC), big plug-in ecosystem and more.\n\nPostgres is in my opinion simply the superior choice in everything but the\nlearning curve. It also scales better than MySQL does.\n\n12h\n\nLatte macchiato @privateger@plasmatrap.com\n\n@danielcasanueva@mastodon.social @tobyhede@hachyderm.io Oh, not to forget Row\nLevel Security. With something like Supabase you can forego backend code on\nsome applications entirely.\n\n1h\n\nMathias Panzenb\u00f6ck @bloody_albatross@chaos.social\n\n@privateger @tobyhede @danielcasanueva And transactional database schema\nchanges! No more wrecked database state after a failed migration! That's a big\none for me. (SQLite also supports this.) And then extensions like PostGIS and\npgvector are also nice.\n\n1h\n\nDaniel Casanueva @danielcasanueva@mastodon.social\n\n@bloody_albatross @privateger @tobyhede Oooh, that's a good one!\n\n1h\n\nLatte macchiato @privateger@plasmatrap.com\n\n@bloody_albatross@chaos.social @tobyhede@hachyderm.io\n@danielcasanueva@mastodon.social Wait, that's not a MySQL feature? Good lord,\ncouldn't work without that nowadys...\n\n12h\n\nDaniel Casanueva @danielcasanueva@mastodon.social\n\n@privateger @tobyhede Thanks for the answer! It was my understanding that\nMySQL is also ACID-compliant through InnoDB. This is something important. The\nmost advanced features I'm not sure I will use. However, I'll look a bit more\ninto it and see if it's worth a migration.\n\n7h\n\nLatte macchiato @privateger@plasmatrap.com\n\n@danielcasanueva@mastodon.social @tobyhede@hachyderm.io InnoDB is ACID\ncompliant, but myISAM isn't. It was the default for a long time and is still\nused quite often.\n\n1h *\n\nMarcelo Garbarino @marcegarba@mastodon.sdf.org\n\n@privateger @tobyhede @danielcasanueva Also, proper behavior when using SUM(),\nMAX(), etc. without a GROUP BY clause.\n\nThat is, PostgreSQL generates an error, which is the right thing to do.\n\nAs far as I know, MySQL allows this, unless it was fixed in newer versions.\n\n12h\n\nf\u266f a\u266f \u221e @tsadiq@rivals.space\n\n@tobyhede wow, that's incredible\n\n12h\n\nLatte macchiato @privateger@plasmatrap.com\n\n@tobyhede@hachyderm.io HELL YEAH\n\n10h\n\nmatuzalem @matuzalem@bsd.cafe\n\n@tobyhede this is cool\n\n9h\n\nKermode @gemlog@tilde.zone\n\n@tobyhede And just in time too!
