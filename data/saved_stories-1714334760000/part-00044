You create\na new astronaut, gain levels and experience for every move you make by\ncompleting missions in space. You will have access to missions similar to what\nhappened in real life, or fictional missions designed to challenge you as an\nastronaut.\n\nSpacecrafts are highly complicated machines with the primary task of exploring\nand understanding what's outside the atmosphere of Earth, while keeping the\nastronauts alive for long periods. This is achieved by hundreds of individual\nsystems and backup systems working together. With the help from the in-game\nSpace Flight Academy, the provided flight manual for each spacecraft, and\nchecklists, you will learn how to fly and operate these machines, and explore\nspace in a high resolution and realistic environment.\n\nReentry provides a balance between realism and gamification. It's main focus\nis not to create one 100% accurate implementation of one space craft but to\nprovide you with a gamified but still realistic experience on multiple\nspacecrafts.\n\nYou will learn how to operate these spacecrafts using procedures used by the\nreal astronauts, see the sunset and sunrise while orbiting orbiting Earth with\nspeeds exceeding 25,500 ft/s. It will let you explore the surface of Earth and\nthe Moon from Orbit, and let you enjoy the solitude of being in space.\n\n## ROCKETS!\n\nImagine the final few seconds before launching into space. You are sitting on\ntop of a 111 meter high rocket, looking at the instruments of a spaceship\nabout to leave the oasis we call Earth. The engines are igniting, mechanical\nsystems are clinging below you, while thousands of gallons of fuel is pumping\nthrough the systems. The loud roar of the five F1 engines are producing close\nto 8,000,000 pounds of thrust, violently shaking the cockpit and lifting 3\nmillion kg off the pad. The launch pad tower is slowly moving away from you\nwhile the engines are balancing the rocket like a skyscraper on a needle.\nSophisticated engineers has created the systems that will safely accelerate\nyou to 25,500 ft/s, into a free fall orbit, with the Moon as the destination.\n\nWelcome to Reentry, an orbital simulator.\n\n## REALISTIC SYSTEMS & PROCEDURES\n\nBecoming a good astronaut requires you to know your spacecraft.\n\nEach spacecraft is very different when it comes to how they behave, and how\nthey are operated. Hundres of switches are used to configure systems and\nsubsystems. Some have on-board computers, while others don't. Multiple power\nsources such as eletrical batteries, inverters or fuel cells are powering\nelectrical components, while valves, pipes and tanks guide substances to where\nthey belong. Reaction Control Systems can modify the spacecraft attitude, or\neven modify its trajectory. While many of these systems are automatic, some\nrequire manual control, or provide manual override if needed.\n\nThe simulator comes with flight manuals for each spacecraft and hundreds of\nchecklists based on those the real astronauts used. In-game mechanics guide\nyou through them using interactive elements and guidance tools.\n\nThe game also comes with an in-game checklist editor so you can add your own\nchecklists, or modify the default ones.\n\n## LEARN TO OPERATE THESE SPACECRAFTS\n\n### PROJECT MERCURY\n\n1958 - 1963\n\n### PROJECT GEMINI\n\n1961 - 1966\n\n### APOLLO COMMAND MODULE\n\n1961 - 1972\n\n### APOLLO LUNAR MODULE\n\n1962 - 1972\n\n### LUNAR ROVING VEHICLE\n\n1969 - 1972\n\n## THE ACADEMY\n\nLet's face it. Flying and operating a spacecraft is no simple task. Given the\namount of subsystems, procedures and controls, the learning curve to even get\nthe rocket off the pad in a safe and controlled manner can be hard. After\nignition, the only way out of the capsule is through an abort. Thousands of\ngallons of fuel are consumed to produce enough thrust to bring the rocket\nthrough the initial layer of the atmosphere, where the dangers of maximun\ndynamic pressure are pushing the structural limits of the launch vehicle. The\nautomatic guidance logic carefully guides the spacecraft into space. At the\nsame time, the astronauts are busy monitoring the available data and completes\nchecklists while the cockpit shakes violently.\n\nOnce in orbit, the next maneuvers are planned, while also constantly verifying\nthat the essential systems needed to keep you alive are functional, and that\nyou have a way of returning back to Earth.\n\nReentry - An Orbital Simulator uses realistic orbital mechanics, and every\nforce applied to the spacecraft will affet its attitude and trajectory.\nLuckily, you don't have to learn it all at once to get started. The in-game\nAcademy provides multiple lessons for each spacecraft available. Each lesson\nis focused on one or two procecures, and explain them at a basic level. Slowly\nyou will be able to put the pieces together, and attempt to get certified in a\ngiven spacecraft by taking the exam.\n\n## THE CAMPAIGN\n\nEach of the available space crafts has a dedicated campaign. This is a set of\nmissions put together to challenge what you have learned. Once you have\ncompleted the Academy of a spacecraft, you will be ready to complete the\nCampaing. You will need to use what you have learned to complete multiple\nmissions in fictional story largely based on real life events and missions.\n\nOne campaing and space craft builds on your knowledge from the previous era so\nI recommend you to complete the campaings in order. This will let you learn\nand see the evolution of the technologies used in human space flight like in\nreal life. You will see how to reach your first orbits in the Mercury\nCampaingn, how to rendezvous and dock in the Gemini campaing, how to reach the\nMoon in the Apollo Command Module campaing, and finally how to land on the\nMoon in the Lunar Module campaign.\n\nI hope you will enjoy this experience as you explore the frontiers of space\nflight in these historic space crafts.\n\n## OUT NOW AS EARLY ACCESS!\n\nReentry - An Orbital Simulator is out now as Early Access. The game has been\nin development since 2015, and has received many updates since then.\n\nThe price will always reflect the current value of the game. What you see\nright now is what the 1.0 version of the game will become. After 1.0, I wish\nto further expand on the realism of the spacecrafts already in the game, and\nexpand on the Reentry Universe with more space crafts.\n\nThe game is distributed through Steam and is currently the only way to\npurchase the game.\n\nBUY FROM STEAM\n\n## JOIN THE OFFICIAL REENTRY COMMUNITY\n\n### Hundreds of other virtual astronauts has joined the official Reentry\ndiscord cannel.
