Her friend, \u201cRose,\u201d was her college\nroommate from '\u201cup north,\u201d who now lived in Stamford, Connecticut. Rose was\nvisiting North Carolina for the first time during the 2023 Easter weekend.\n\nTheir dinner was a little over two hours long. They talked about Maya\u2019s life\nin North Carolina and Rose\u2019s life in Connecticut, what was new with their\nrespective families, Rose\u2019s upcoming wedding, Maya\u2019s work situation, and more.\nMaya had parmesan cream gnocchi with braised short ribs, roasted okra, and\ngreen tomatoes, topped with pecorino. Rose had the quarter Joyce Farms natural\nBBQ chicken with Carolina gold rice.\n\n> Contents The Dinner Concerns and Frustrations CR, 32, from Montr\u00e9al \u201c...An\n> Exciting Career Opportunity\u201d An Escalated Alert The Investigation\n\n##\n\nConcerns and Frustrations\n\nMaya, 34, had been in her junior software developer role for nine years. That\nwork anniversary in February 2023 was recognized alongside hundreds of other\nwork anniversaries with a one-line blurb at the bottom of a company-wide email\nnewsletter that went out to over 5,000 employees. In her nine years in the\nsame role, Maya had repeatedly voiced her concerns and frustrations regarding\nthe lack of recognition for her efforts and contributions, limited\nopportunities for career advancement, and a perceived inequity in the\ndistribution of challenging projects among her and her colleagues. On top of\nall that, she felt her compensation and benefits package had not been\ncommensurate with her skills and experience since day one.\n\nAs Maya\u2019s frustrations grew, she expressed her dissatisfaction more openly.\nShe posted about her feelings of being undervalued and stuck in her current\nposition on social media and popular professional networking sites. Her posts\non social media included subtle cues such as liking and sharing articles about\ncareer stagnation, and the importance of recognizing employee contributions.\nMaya also participated in discussions on both public and private online forums\nthat criticized certain management practices.\n\n##\n\nCR, 32, from Montr\u00e9al\n\nSometime in August 2022, Maya received the first of many empathetic messages\nfrom one of the professional networking sites she was most active on. It was a\nconnection request from CR, someone she recognized as a frequent liker,\ncommenter, and reposter of her several work-related posts, and it contained a\nnote: \u201cHi Maya, I really resonate with your insights on employee recognition\nand the challenges of feeling stagnant. I\u2019d love to connect and learn more\nabout your experiences.\u201d The connection request came in as Maya was about to\nfly out of Charlotte Douglas International Airport for a 1-week vacation in\nMexico via Orlando, Florida.\n\nOver the following months, Maya and CR exchanged messages back and forth about\ntheir respective career paths, backgrounds, and personal tidbits.\n\nCR, 32, was born and raised in Montr\u00e9al, Canada. In 2012, she got her Bachelor\nof Computer Science at McGill University in Montr\u00e9al, where she was an active\nmember of a software coders\u2019 club. Her capstone project was on machine\nlearning optimization techniques. She spent four years at her first job as a\njunior software developer right after graduation. There, she was responsible\nfor developing and maintaining client-server applications in Java and unit-\ntesting code for robustness, including edge cases, usability, and general\nreliability. According to her, one of her achievements at Job #1 was\ndeveloping a real-time analytics feature that increased user engagement by\n20%.\n\nBecause there were no career advancement opportunities, CR said she had to\nleave Job #1 in 2016 and took a pay cut to land her current role at Job #2. It\nwas a much bigger organization, and the software developers had more\nopportunities to make a company-wide impact. She told Maya that her day-to-day\ninvolved designing, building, and maintaining reliable code in Python and C#,\nengaging with stakeholders to gather requirements and convert them into\nactionable technical specifications, and overseeing the deployment of software\npatches and updates across enterprise applications. In 2019, CR told Maya she\nsuccessfully led an ad-hoc team that developed a scalable cloud storage\nsolution, significantly reducing operational costs by 30%.\n\nDespite all her achievements, and considering she had to take a pay cut from\nJob #1 to Job #2, CR still didn\u2019t feel like she was advancing in her career.\nShe kept getting all the not-so-challenging projects on her team, and there\nwas little to no meaningful recognition of her achievements. She said she has\ntried to stay optimistic, learn as much as possible by attending tech meetups\nand cybersecurity conferences to stay updated with industry trends, and\nregularly contribute to open-source projects on GitHub and Stack Overflow.\n\nLearning about CR\u2019s experiences from a thousand miles away in another country\nfurther convinced Maya that her feelings of career stagnation were not\ninvalid. It strengthened her resolve to keep doing all she can to raise\nawareness of what\u2019s going on in the tech industry.\n\n##\n\n\u201c...An Exciting Career Opportunity\u201d\n\nIn late March 2023, the week before Rose visited Maya from Connecticut, CR\nmessaged Maya that she would attend FutureCon Montr\u00e9al, a one-day hybrid\ncybersecurity conference, on Thursday, April 6, 2023. She mentioned she would\nbe attending with a few of her work colleagues and some folks from one of her\nlocal cybersecurity groups on Meetup. Interestingly, the day before the\nconference, a relatively unusual winter storm led to blackouts across large\nparts of Montr\u00e9al. Maya remembered reading about it on the news and she\nmessaged CR to check-in. CR didn\u2019t reply until late on Thursday while at the\nconference after she was able to get her phone charged. She had lost power and\nWiFi at her apartment.\n\nThe following week, after Rose returned to Connecticut and after CR\u2019s extended\nEaster break following FutureCon, Maya and CR caught up over a video call: CR\ndebriefed Maya on FutureCon, and Maya recapped Rose\u2019s visit. During the video\ncall, CR brought up an online forum she recently came across that had quite a\nfew other software developers who seemed to share the same frustrations as\nthem. Maya made a note to check out the forum later and then shared updates\nwith CR on her job search progress so far. CR reminded Maya to let her know if\nshe needed anything during the job search\u2014referrals, recommendation letters,\nmock coding sessions, resume/portfolio review, and so on.\n\nSometime after lunch on Tuesday, May 2, 2023, Maya received an email on her\npersonal Gmail from a recruiter offering \u201can exciting career opportunity.\u201d The\nemail was an opportunity for a Senior Software Developer role based in the\nResearch Triangle area of North Carolina: remote for a year, followed by a\nhybrid model\u2014any two days in the office per week. The overview and\nqualifications seemed to match Maya\u2019s current skill set, and the benefits all\nlined up with what she had been demanding from her current employer.\n\nMaya marked the email as unread, and set a reminder on her phone to go back to\nit after work and begin the application process. She remembered the forum CR\nhad shared with her a while back and also set a reminder to check it out,\nhoping to see if like-minded individuals might have job openings or other\nrecommendations they could share with her.\n\n##\n\nAn Escalated Alert\n\n\u201cMike\u201d is a reasonably structured individual. On weekday mornings, he gets\ncoffee with his wife around 7:30 a.m. at their favorite local coffee shop in\ntheir quiet suburb of Eastover in Charlotte, North Carolina. After coffee, he\ndrops her off at her job where she works as a medical lab technician and then\nhe returns home to begin his remote work as a senior network security analyst.\nHis normal day-to-day often involves a lot of concentration and attention to\ndetail. Around 9:30 a.m., he logs into his work systems, where he monitors\nnetwork security, analyzes cyber threats, and sometimes collaborates with\nother teams and business units within his employer\u2019s organization.\n\nWednesday, May 3, 2023, began as a typical chilly and sunny North Carolina\nday. On the way back from dropping his wife off at work, Mike noticed the\nwinds had picked up significantly. He wondered whether he closed the east-\nfacing windows in the upstairs living room to protect the Dracaenas on the\nwindow sill from breakage.\n\nAfter logging into his work computer, Mike saw an escalated alert on his\nteam\u2019s network monitoring tool from one of the junior analysts on his team\u2014it\nwas for a series of alerts triggered on an employee\u2019s assigned work computer\nearlier that morning. A quick check of the asset ID showed that the owner of\nthe affected device was a member of the software development team.\n\nPuzzled, Mike settled in to take a look.\n\nAccording to the junior analyst\u2019s notes, the alert included signs of network\nreconnaissance by an external threat actor who was simultaneously trying to\nestablish a foothold within the network. Then, around 7:28 a.m. (EDT), a click\non a suspicious link contained in an email followed by unusual outbound\ntraffic\u2014starting around 8:36 a.m. (EDT)\u2014to a website that seemed to have been\ncompromised through a watering hole attack.\n\nFor the traffic associated with the watering hole attack, Mike noticed a\nmalicious script executed in the background of one of the internet browsers on\nthe infected device. The script was then observed trying to install malware on\nthe device by exploiting vulnerabilities in specific browser plugins. Further,\nMike observed additional technical indicators:\n\n  * Suspicious HTTP requests containing obfuscated iframe tags.\n\n  * Unusual spikes in data exfiltration activities to unfamiliar IP addresses.\n\n  * Signs of exploitation such as attempts to escalate privileges, evade detection, create backdoors, and execute additional payloads.\n\n##\n\nThe Investigation\n\nMike began his investigation within minutes of seeing the escalated alert.\nUsing network logs, endpoint security systems, and cross-references with\nthreat intelligence databases, he confirmed the malicious nature of the\nobserved activities. He identified the employee\u2019s account linked to the device\nfrom where the alert originated\u2014Maya, a junior developer on the software\ndevelopment team.\n\nMike immediately implemented containment measures, including isolating Maya\u2019s\ndevice from the network to prevent the threat actors from exfiltrating data\nand/or further spreading or moving laterally within the network. Mike also\ntagged the digital forensics team and shared the incident records with them so\nthey could initiate a deeper forensic analysis to understand the full scope of\nthe attack and any potential data breaches.\n\nAfter confirming the containment measures in place, Mike drafted an email to\nMaya\u2019s manager to notify her of the recent security incident and the actions\nhe had just taken to isolate Maya\u2019s device, which would invariably affect\nMaya\u2019s day-to-day roles in the short term. He shared the draft with his own\nmanager and other senior members of his team for their input and edits before\nsending it to Maya\u2019s manager.\n\nDays later, with several teams now investigating different parts of the\nincident, a clearer picture began to emerge. They found some of Maya\u2019s public\nposts, which tied directly to the spear-phishing email she received regarding\na real-enough job posting, which then kick-started a series of malicious\nnetwork activities after she clicked on the link in the email. Security\nanalysts also found the source of the watering hole attack: a website shared\non the forum CR mentioned to Maya sometime in April 2023.\n\nIn essence, threat actors exploited Maya\u2019s publicly expressed dissatisfaction\nwith her current role at her workplace.\n\nAs the bigger picture of the incident unfolded, it became necessary for Mike\nand the other security teams to involve other departments and business units:\n\n  * Human Resources (HR): HR was brought in to address the internal implications of Maya\u2019s public postings and the potential breach of company policy regarding public discourse about job dissatisfaction.\n\n  * Legal: The legal team was consulted to understand the ramifications of the network breach, including data protection laws and regulatory compliance issues within the company\u2019s industry.\n\n  * Compliance: Compliance officers started a review to ensure all response measures adhered to legal requirements, especially concerning data breach notifications if client or sensitive corporate data was compromised.\n\nThe investigation remained active for several months with several\ncybersecurity-related follow-up actions:\n\n  * Mike\u2019s team continued to monitor the company\u2019s network and other potential entry points to prevent further incidents.\n\n  * The scope of the forensic analysis was extended to other potentially compromised systems and devices.\n\n  * Programs were enhanced to educate employees about cybersecurity risks and the importance of maintaining operational security, especially in public forums.\n\nThis complex case of \u201cMaya\u201d in North Carolina presents the need for businesses\nto be aware of these risks and educate their employees about the dangers of\nsharing too much information online, especially in public or semi-public\nforums. Companies should also pay attention to their online reputation and\naddress employee grievances proactively to prevent them from becoming\nvulnerabilities.\n\nThere is also the critical need for robust and comprehensive cybersecurity\nmeasures, including proactive monitoring, employee education, and cross-\ndepartmental collaboration to effectively handle and mitigate sophisticated\ncyber threats.\n\nIf you like what you just read, let\u2019s connect on LinkedIn and/or buy me a\ncoffee.\n\nPhoto by Daniel Weiss on Unsplash\n\nShare\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Inadvertent Insider: A Target of Opportunity\n\nbidemiologunde.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nCloudy with a Chance of Unusually High Bills\n\nA sanitized war story about credential stuffing attacks involving a high-\nprofile cloud service account used for cryptocurrency mining in Los Angeles\n\nApr 12 \u2022\n\nBidemi Ologunde\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Cloudy with a Chance of Unusually High Bills\n\nbidemiologunde.substack.com\n\nSecond-Order Consequences\n\nAn ad-hoc, all-hands-on-deck, in-person-only briefing in New York City\n\nApr 5 \u2022\n\nBidemi Ologunde\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Second-Order Consequences\n\nbidemiologunde.substack.com\n\nOperation Golden Dome\n\nA DDoS Extortion Incident in Denver, Colorado, Followed by Tampering with MX\nRecords\n\nMar 29 \u2022\n\nBidemi Ologunde\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Operation Golden Dome\n\nbidemiologunde.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bidemi Ologunde\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n", "frontpage": false}
