Outside Fairway, the supermarket on\nBroadway at Seventy-fourth Street that is a fixture of the Upper West Side,\nshoppers were hurrying to beat the rain. Moms were clutching the hands of\nsmall children in a post-school-day daze, while elderly ladies barrelled\nthrough the entrance wielding wheeled walkers and snarling, \u201cEx-CUSE me!\u201d\n\nInside, in a claustrophobic produce aisle that was piled high with apples and\nmusky with the scent of ripeness, stood twenty-eight-year-old Dan Glickberg,\nFairway\u2019s executive vice-president and the great-grandson of the store\u2019s\nfounder, Nathan Glickberg. He watched as his customers tried to decide among\nthe twelve varieties of apples on display. There was a new apple in town,\nSweeTango, and Glickberg wanted his customers to know about it, but he wasn\u2019t\npushy. He wore the placid expression of a man who has heard every conceivable\ncomplaint and experienced every possible eccentricity when it comes to food.\n\nAn older woman with blond highlights approached.\n\n\u201cThis is a great apple, Ma\u2019am,\u201d Glickberg said, and held up the newcomer.\n\u201cGreat apple,\u201d he repeated, and smiled.\n\n\u201cI want to make strudel,\u201d the woman said, in a German accent.\n\n\u201cWell, this is a fantastic eating apple. It\u2019s crisp and it\u2019s juicy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut for strudel?\u201d\n\n\u201cGolden Delicious would be good for strudel, Ma\u2019am. But why don\u2019t you take one\nof these to eat?\u201d\n\nHe handed the apple to her. She looked it over, and then sniffed the calyx,\nthe apple\u2019s bottom. It was a large apple, but not supersized, like the Fujis\ndown the aisle. It had sunburned shoulders, yellow sides, and a splash of\ngreen around the stem bowl, and it was freckled with \u201clenticels,\u201d through\nwhich it was imperceptibly breathing. Like young Glickberg, the SweeTango was\nof fortunate lineage\u2014its father was Zestar, which Fairway also had in stock,\nand its mother was the famous Honeycrisp, which Fairway would be getting a\nlittle later in the season.\n\nThe woman shrugged. \u201cO.K., I will let you know,\u201d she said, putting the apple\ninto her cart.\n\n\u201cShe will, too,\u201d Glickberg said, watching her walk away.\n\nThis was SweeTango\u2019s second fall in the city. In its d\u00e9butante season,\nsupplies were so limited that few New Yorkers got to taste it; this year,\nthere were three times as many nationwide. Tweets from SweeTango\u2019s Twitter\naccount and posts on its Facebook page tracked the apple\u2019s progress from\nMinnesota, where it was bred, to stores around the country. Like Honeycrisp,\nSweeTango has much larger cells than other apples, and when you bite into it\nthe cells shatter, rather than cleaving along the cell walls, as is the case\nwith most popular apples. The bursting of the cells fills your mouth with\njuice. Chunks of SweeTango snap off in your mouth with a loud cracking sound.\nAlthough a crisp texture is the single most prized quality in an apple\u2014even\nmore desirable than taste, according to one study\u2014crispness is more a matter\nof acoustics than of mouthfeel. Vibrations pass along the lower jaw and set\nthe cochlea trembling. Biting into a really crisp apple, one feels, in the\nwords of Edward Bunyard, the author of \u201cThe Anatomy of Dessert,\u201d \u201ca certain\njoy in crashing through living tissue, a memory of Neanderthal days.\u201d\n\nBut, no matter how celebrated its parents, any new apple in the Big Apple is\ngoing to face a tough crowd.\n\n\u201cHave you tried SweeTango?\u201d Glickberg asked another customer. \u201cIf you like a\ncrisp apple, this one is good.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo expensive,\u201d the woman said. It was $2.99 a pound, which was a dollar more\nthan the Gala and Fuji apples, but a lot less than the SweeTango was selling\nfor online (twelve for thirty-eight dollars, on one site).\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nThe next customer began filling a bag with them. \u201cI just like the way they\nlook,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother woman stopped in front of SweeTango. \u201cNow, I read about these new\napples on the Web, and I think this was one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably was.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are they like?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery crisp and very sweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good. My dogs will like them.\u201d\n\nGlickberg nodded.\n\n\u201cWell, we share them,\u201d the woman went on. \u201cI have four dogs.\u201d She lowered her\nvoice conspiratorially. \u201cI have to peel them for one. He doesn\u2019t like the\nskin.\u201d\n\nLike every invention, SweeTango is both a work of individual genius and a\nproduct of its times. As a piece of intellectual property\u2014branded, patented,\nand trademarked\u2014it has more in common with the apple on my laptop than the one\nI used to carry in my lunchbox. Anyone can judge for himself how it\ntastes\u2014very sweet, though saved from saccharine, in my opinion, by a lemony\nfinish\u2014but to appreciate what SweeTango represents, as a product and as a\ncultural construct, it helps to understand something about its antecedents.\nAnd since apples and humans go way back\u2014Thoreau begins his essay \u201cWild Apples\u201d\nby noting, \u201cIt is remarkable how closely the history of the Apple-tree is\nconnected with that of man\u201d\u2014a little backstory is necessary.\n\nMalus pumila, of the family Rosaceae and the tribe Pyreae, was domesticated\nsome four thousand years ago, in the fruit forests of what is now southeastern\nKazakhstan, near the city of Almaty. Frank Browning, the author of \u201cApples,\u201d\nreports seeing apple trees growing up through cracks in the pavement there.\nThe wild horses of the nearby steppe liked to eat apples, and could cover long\ndistances, carrying the seeds in their guts. Apples travelled westward along\ntrade routes, and show up in Persia around the time of Alexander the Great,\nand in Europe not long after; the Romans cultivated them widely. (The apple in\nthe Garden of Eden was most likely a pomegranate, or possibly an orange.) The\nspecies came to the New World with the first European settlers, in the form of\nseeds, and the pioneers, as they pushed westward, took apples with them.\n\nBy the time of the Civil War, there were many kinds of apples growing across\nthe United States, but most of them didn\u2019t taste very good, and as a rule\npeople didn\u2019t eat them. Cider was cheaper to make than beer, and many settlers\nbelieved fermented drinks were safer than water. Everyone drank hard cider.\nPresident John Adams drank a tankard before breakfast. Babies drank it before\ngoing to bed. At the end of the nineteenth century, when Carry Nation took up\nher axe in the service of the temperance movement, she likely employed it on\napple trees as well as saloons. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the\napple had a serious public-relations problem.\n\nThe solution, as Michael Pollan relates in his book \u201cThe Botany of Desire,\u201d\nwas to promote the eating of apples as a healthy snack. J. T. Stinson, a fruit\nspecialist, first used the phrase \u201cAn apple a day keeps the doctor away\u201d at\nthe St. Louis World\u2019s Fair, in 1904. (He adapted the slogan from the\ntraditional English proverb \u201cAn apple before going to bed keeps the doctor\nfrom earning his bread.\u201d) Many cider-makers had long prized the chance\nseedlings, discovered in their fields and orchards, that yielded unexpectedly\ndelectable eating apples. As the industry moved away from cider-making and\ntoward table fruit, some of these apples were named, propagated by cloning\u2014the\nmethod of grafting a piece of one tree onto the trunk of another, which\nproduces fruit that is an exact genetic copy of the first tree\u2019s\u2014and promoted\nlike pop stars. The Northeast had Jonathan, Esopus Spitzenburg, and Blue\nPearmain (Thoreau\u2019s favorite); the South claimed Winesap, Sally Gray, and\nDisharoon; the Midwest boasted Hawkeye and Detroit Red; and from the West came\nthe Gravenstein and the Yellow Newtown Pippin. Their flavors were shaped by\ntheir respective climates\u2014the shorter the growing season the tarter the apples\ntended to be.\n\nIn the twenties and thirties, refrigerated railcars allowed growers to\ntransport apples over great distances, and, thanks to cold-storage warehouses,\nwholesalers and retailers could keep them for long periods of time. As\nregional markets gave way to supermarket chains, the number of available apple\nvarieties shrank, and those which endured shed their regional associations. By\nthe nineteen-sixties, most supermarkets carried three types of apple:\nMcIntosh, a small, tart apple that John McIntosh had found growing on his farm\nin Ontario, Canada, in 1811; Red Delicious, originally the Hawkeye, a sweet\napple discovered on a farm in Iowa in the eighteen-seventies; and Golden\nDelicious, found in a hay field in West Virginia in the eighteen-nineties.\nApple breeders tweaked these apples, to enhance their industrial\npotential\u2014they had to be durable, long-lasting, and attractive\u2014generally at\nthe expense of texture and taste (unlike many fruits, apples can look\nwonderful and taste terrible, and so they lend themselves to horticultural\nsleight of hand). Price, rather than quality, became the determining factor,\nas growers and retailers engaged in a headlong race to see who could produce\nthe largest yields and the lowest prices. By the sixties, the apple industry\nhad managed to turn the perfect convenience food\u2014a tasty, healthy, portable,\ndurable snack wrapped in an edible peel\u2014into the insipid and cottony hardball\nthat soured several generations of children on apples. Today, the average\nAmerican eats less than half as many apples in a year as the average European\neats. And that\u2019s where the story of SweeTango begins.\n\nDavid Bedford, its inventor, is a wiry, bushy-browed, sixty-year-old\nhorticulturist, who speaks with a residual drawl from his early years in North\nCarolina, where his father was a preacher and his mother was an amateur\nbiologist. As a child, he loved all kinds of fruit except apples. \u201cI can still\nremember that Red Delicious apple\u2014that sweet but overripe smell and that mealy\nsoft texture,\u201d he told me. \u201cKids trade their snacks, but no one would trade\nfor a Red Delicious.\u201d\n\nBedford attended Wheaton College in Illinois, where, as a biology major, he\nbecame interested in plant breeding, and where he tasted a really good apple\nfor the first time. Another student had brought a bushel back from Michigan.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Oh, my gosh, this is what I\u2019ve been missing.\u2019 It was the beginning\nof my awakening.\u201d Upon graduation, he worked for three years in a nursery in\nRapid City, South Dakota, and then went back to school for a master\u2019s degree\nin horticulture at Colorado State University. In 1979, he took a job at the\nUniversity of Minnesota\u2019s horticultural station, which maintains one of only\nthree large-scale apple-breeding programs in the country.\n\nIn the United States, apple production happens mainly in the shoulders of the\nnation\u2014Washington State is the largest producer, and New York is the next\nlargest. Not surprisingly, each of those states has a breeding program, at\nWashington State University and at Cornell. Minnesota is twenty-third among\nthe twenty-nine apple-growing states, in volume of production; up through the\neighteen-fifties almost no apples grew there, because it was too cold. Its\nbreeding program was born not of abundance but of necessity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t live\nin Minnesota,\u201d Horace Greeley once said, while visiting the state, \u201cbecause\nyou can\u2019t grow apples here.\u201d That remark inspired a cantankerous apple breeder\nnamed Peter Gideon to prove Greeley wrong with an apple he named Wealthy,\nafter his wife. The success of the Wealthy apple, introduced in 1861 and still\ngrown in heritage orchards around the country, was the inspiration for the\nuniversity\u2019s apple-breeding program, in 1878, which was followed by the\nfounding of the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station, where Bedford\nworks. The station was built with funds authorized by the Hatch Act of 1887,\nwhich provided research-and-development money to land-grant universities for\nthe promotion of agriculture.\n\n\u201cWhat time did you say you wanted me to start drinking?\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nOver the course of its existence, the \u201cU\u201d \u2019s breeding program has released\ntwenty-seven new varieties of apples. Their names\u2014Beacon, Haralson, Prairie\nSpy\u2014are not widely known outside the state, but they are cherished by\nMinnesotans. At harvest time, it is not uncommon to see enormous buses\u2014the\nkind you see taking gamblers to casinos on the East Coast\u2014pull up in front of\nroadside stands around the state and disgorge scores of apple tourists. For\ngrowers, the university\u2019s breeding program meant a steady supply of new\nvarieties that could withstand the state\u2019s cold winters and hot summers. The\nmarket was tiny, but that meant the university\u2019s breeders didn\u2019t face the\ncommercial pressure felt by breeders in New York and Washington.\n\nFor Bedford, this was both good and bad. \u201cWhen I started here, in 1979, Red\nDelicious was still king\u2014it ruled the empire in the Star Wars universe of\napples, as it were\u2014and I remember thinking to myself, Oh, gosh, is this really\nwhat the world wants from an apple? It was so discouraging! It was big and it\nwas red, but that\u2019s all it was.\u201d On the other hand, he added, \u201cwe weren\u2019t\nbreeding apples for the industry, and we were not breeding apples for\nmiddlemen\u2014they didn\u2019t want anything to do with us Northern hillbillies up here\nwith our cold-hardy apples. We never worked with Red Delicious here, so we had\na totally different set of germplasm in our apples. Which, it eventually\nturned out, was a very good thing.\u201d\n\nWhen Bedford assumed control of the apple-breeding program, in the early\neighties, the U.S. apple industry was poised for a profound transformation.\nSomething like the pre-industrial world of apples, where an apple lover had\nthe choice of many varieties, was returning, not through heirlooms but through\nnew breeds of super apples from other countries. Instead of standing mostly\nfor places and people, the new apples would stand for images, sounds, and\nideas\u2014Royal Gala, Pink Lady, Jazz. This transformation had begun in 1975, when\na Washington grower named Grady Auvil introduced a tart, green, hard-fleshed\napple originally from Australia that Maria Ann Smith, a farmer\u2019s wife, had\ndiscovered growing on the family\u2019s compost pile in New South Wales, in the\neighteen-sixties. The Granny Smith apple was widely propagated in New Zealand,\nbecame famous in the United Kingdom in the nineteen-sixties as the logo on the\nBeatles\u2019 Apple Records, and, on arriving in the United States, expanded the\npantheon of supermarket apples to four, demonstrating to apple breeders\neverywhere that U.S. consumers would respond favorably to a new apple. In the\nearly seventies, President Nixon had imposed price freezes on all foods except\nfresh produce. Grocery retailers, looking to increase profits, expanded their\nproduce sections. After controls were lifted, they continued to seek out new\nvarieties of fruits and vegetables that could be marketed at a premium.\n\nIn the eighties, the Fuji, a large, sweet apple that was originally bred in\nJapan, was brought to the U.S., and quickly caught on. That decade, Braeburn\nand Gala apples, both from New Zealand, were also introduced to the U.S., to\ngreat acclaim; the Gala is now one of the most popular apples in many parts of\nthe country. To Bedford these successes demonstrated that \u201cif the consumer is\ngiven choices, and if they realize, by eating some of these apples, how good\nan apple can be, then the market can\u2019t keep supplying lousy apples, because\nthe consumer is not going to tolerate that.\u201d The other thing the new apples\nproved, Bedford added, was that \u201can apple doesn\u2019t have to look that good. The\noriginal Fuji was an ugly apple. It showed that if the flavor was pleasing,\nthe customer could get past the appearance.\u201d Meanwhile, Red Delicious began to\ndecline. Washington produced roughly sixty million bushels in 1995; the state\nproduces a little more than half that much now. In 2002, Congress spent\nninety-two million dollars to assist struggling apple growers.\n\nBedford\u2019s apple laboratory, a thirty-acre parcel of rolling land about thirty\nmiles west of Minneapolis, is planted with about twenty thousand apple trees.\nIn May, during blossom time, Bedford and his student assistants make crosses\nbetween promising varieties: taking pollen from one variety and swabbing it\nonto the stamen of another, and then bagging those flowers to keep pollen from\nother trees out. Although the apple that grows on that branch will be true to\nthe mother tree\u2019s DNA, the seeds will be heterozygous, combining equal and\nunique parts of both parents\u2019 genes so that every seed is distinct\u2014another\nthing apple trees and humans have in common. Bedford hopes to get the best\ncharacteristics of both parents into the offspring, while producing an apple\nwith an identity all its own. \u201cSome apples look great but don\u2019t pass those\ntraits on,\u201d he told me, \u201cwhile others are not so great-looking but make good\nparents.\u201d Each one of the three to five thousand seeds that result from a\nseason of crosses will be unlike all the others and will produce a different\ntree. Bedford plants the seeds in a greenhouse, and grafts the budding trees\nonto outdoor rootstock the following summer. In about five years, he will have\nfour thousand or so brand-new apples to taste.\n\nIn the fall, during the apple harvest, Bedford tastes apples from blossom\ntimes past, up to five hundred apples a day, in the hope of finding that one\napple in ten thousand that will be released as a commercial variety. I spent\nan afternoon with him in early September, walking through long rows of young\ntrees, and tasting apples of every imaginable size, shape, hue, and flavor,\nfrom musky melonlike apples to bright lemony apples and apples that tasted\nlike licorice. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually swallow, and we don\u2019t really even have time\nto spit,\u201d Bedford explained. \u201cYou just kind of hold a bit in your mouth for a\nwhile, until you get the flavor, and then let it fall out.\u201d\n\nIf a tree produces exceptionally good apples for several years in a row, it\nachieves \u00e9lite status and is awarded a number. Four clones are made from the\nmother tree\u2019s wood, and those trees are grown in another orchard on the\nproperty, under commercial conditions. To evaluate the \u00e9lite trees, Bedford\ncarries a field notebook with twenty categories on a page, which, in addition\nto the \u201corganoleptics\u201d\u2014all the sensory stuff, like flavor, texture, and\ncolor\u2014include tree size, shape, and yield. He scores each category from one to\nnine. He generally continues these yearly evaluations for a decade or longer,\nin order to subject the trees to a representative range of extreme summers and\nwinters and drought and flood, and in the hope of ferreting out all the quirks\nthat apple trees are heir to. Some are wild in their youth but eventually\nsettle down, while others bear fruit every other year; some bear smaller\nfruits as the trees age, while others drop their apples before they\u2019re ripe.\n\nFinally, a truly outstanding apple is named, the tree is patented, and clones\nare released to nurseries, where thousands of copies of the trees are made and\nsold to growers, for which the university collects a royalty of around a\ndollar per tree during the life of the patent. Large color posters of the five\napples released during Bedford\u2019s time at the agricultural station decorate his\noffice, their swollen flesh glistening with beads of moisture, like centerfold\npinups in a mechanic\u2019s shop.\n\nAs we walked the rows, Bedford carried a can of orange spray paint. If an\napple wasn\u2019t reasonably tasty\u2014and only two of the scores of varieties we\ntasted made the grade\u2014and if he determined the apple to be fully ripe (which\nhe did by cutting it open with a long-bladed knife and spraying iodine on the\nflesh; the starch in an unripe apple will turn black) then he coldly marked\nthe tree for extermination by spraying orange paint on its trunk. That day, I\nwatched him terminate dozens of unique hybrids whose like the world will never\nsee again, and by the end of the day I had a newfound respect for the breeder\nas the godlike master of his domain, the ultimate arbiter of life and death in\nthe orchard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to give a tree a couple chances, but I just don\u2019t have the mouth\ntime for that,\u201d Bedford explained. \u201cSo it\u2019s one strike and you\u2019re out. With\nall these new trees coming on each year, you won\u2019t have space unless you thin\nout the duds.\u201d He sprayed another tree trunk with the mark of death. \u201cBut it\nis kind of nerve-racking, because you want to give the tree a chance to do its\nbest. No one wants to be known as the guy who killed the next Honeycrisp.\u201d\n\nBedford was very nearly that guy. In 1982, the year he took over the breeding\nprogram, he was looking through the trees that his predecessor in the job\nwanted removed. One was MN 1711, a variety that had achieved \u00e9lite status and\nbeen cloned, but had not done well for several years. The mother tree had been\ndamaged by a particularly cold winter the year before, and the four clones had\nbeen marked for termination. In studying the data, however, Bedford noticed\nthat the mother tree had been planted in one of the lowest, wettest parts of\nthe orchard. \u201cSo I thought, We\u2019ll give that apple one more year,\u201d he said.\nThat apple turned out to be Honeycrisp. Released in 1991, thirty-one years\nafter the original cross was made, it has become the apple of Bedford\u2019s\ndreams\u2014the humble Minnesota apple that made it onto the national, and then the\ninternational, stage. It brought a new kind of texture to apples: flesh that\nwas crunchy but not hard or dense. \u201cThat changed the whole game,\u201d Fred\nWilklow, the owner of Wilklow Orchards, told me one Saturday this fall when I\ndropped in at the greenmarket in Borough Hall, Brooklyn, to buy some of his\napples. As we were talking, another customer overheard the word \u201cHoneycrisp.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my God, Honeycrisp\u2014they are the best!\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Farmer Fred said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing about Honeycrisp,\u201d Brian Nicholson, the president of Red\nJacket Orchards, in New York\u2019s Finger Lakes region, told me recently, \u201cis that\nit brings in people who don\u2019t even like apples that much\u2014people who prefer\npeaches or berries or whatever. So it just expands the apple\u2019s share of the\nfruit basket, and that helps all growers.\u201d The patent, which expired in 2008,\ncombined with sales rights abroad, earned the University of Minnesota more\nthan ten million dollars in royalties, making it the third-most-valuable\ninvention ever produced there, after Ziagen, a drug used to treat H.I.V., and\na vaccine that prevents P.R.R.S., a reproductive and respiratory virus in\npigs. In 2006, the Association of University Technology Managers named\nHoneycrisp one of twenty-five innovations that changed the world, along with\nGoogle and the V-chip.\n\nDennis Courtier, the owner of Pepin Heights Orchards, is a stocky, in-your-\nface guy in his late fifties. He walks with his legs slightly apart, as if he\nhad just climbed off a motorcycle, and has a puffy upper lip that gives him a\npugilistic appearance. His orchards sit atop five-hundred-foot-high bluffs\nthat overlook the Mississippi River at Lake City, in the southeastern corner\nof Minnesota. Turkey buzzards hover in the air around the edges of the bluff,\nborne aloft by convection breezes rising from the river that warm the apples\non cold nights and cool them on hot days. In August, the diurnal changes in\ntemperature combine with the \u201cethylene cascade\u201d to help the apple redden and\nget sweet.\n\n\u201cHas that one guy we\u2019ve been sending all the spam to responded yet?\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nCourtier\u2019s father grew apples, mostly Red Delicious, on the same spot, but the\nbusiness was marginal, and when Dennis told him he wanted to take over, his\nparents tried to talk him out of it. But Courtier had spent time working in an\norchard in Londonderry, New Hampshire, where, he told me, \u201cthe growers were\nscientific in their approach. I thought, Gee, there\u2019s a hell of a lot more to\nthis than loading crates onto a truck.\u201d He went on, \u201cComing from a tiny apple-\nproducing state like Minnesota, with no local infrastructure, forced me to go\nout into the world and get more ideas. Also I got a sense of the big picture,\nand how Pepin fit into it. I could see how the apple industry was going to\ndrive prices down, and how the only way guys like me were going to survive was\nto plant unusual varieties and grow them to a higher standard, and charge a\npremium for them.\u201d\n\nIn the eighties, Courtier tried planting some of the newer apples\u2014Fujis and\nGalas. Although the Minnesota growing season was too short for the Fuji, the\nGala did very well for him. As the Gala caught on around the country, however,\nand more acreage was planted, the same market forces that had destroyed the\nRed Delicious began to sap flavor from the Gala. As Courtier said, \u201cOnce\nenough trees get planted in the ground, a certain number of them are going to\nbe different. You get what we call \u2018sports,\u2019 or limb mutations. Growers look\nfor mutations that are redder\u2014retailers like them because they think customers\nbuy with their eyes. The original Gala was a yellow apple with a red cheek on\nit, but they started to get redder, and they got called Royal Gala, and then\nRegal Gala\u2014each one redder than the last.\u201d A solid-red apple also hides\nbruises, so it is going to get the highest \u201cpack-out\u201d\u2014 the fewest number of\napples lost to cosmetic defects. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the apple is green on\nthe inside when the marketplace is telling you that color is more important\nthan taste,\u201d Courtier said.\n\nIn the late eighties, Courtier began to hear from David Bedford about MN 1711,\nand he signed up to be one of its test growers. The apple proved \u201cpersnickety\u201d\nto grow and harvest\u2014the fruit ripened unevenly, so the trees required four\npickings, rather than the standard two\u2014but the texture and flavor were \u201coff\nthe charts,\u201d Courtier said. \u201cOnce we saw how much people liked the taste of\nit, we planted as many as we could.\u201d Honeycrisp prospered, and today Courtier\nis the largest grower in Minnesota. He was determined not to let the\nmarketplace destroy this apple. \u201cWe always said that if we find a red sport on\na Honeycrisp we would burn it.\u201d\n\nBut still there were problems. \u201cTerroir turned out to be very important for\nthis apple,\u201d Courtier explained. \u201cA lot of growers just grew it in the wrong\nspot, or didn\u2019t know how to grow it at all. Hey, these things don\u2019t come with\nan owner\u2019s manual! Also, it\u2019s a mid-to-late-September apple, but some growers\nstarted jumping the market by harvesting unripe apples in early September.\u201d\nThe quality varied widely, and as consumers found they could not count on the\nHoneycrisp crunch every time, the brand suffered. And, despite Courtier\u2019s best\nefforts, \u201cred drift\u201d began to set in. \u201cYou can see them getting redder,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThe wheel is turning again, and one day the red sports will take over\nand Honeycrisp will be just as flavorless as the next apple.\u201d\n\nTo Bedford and his colleagues at the university, who had spent more than three\ndecades developing Honeycrisp, that didn\u2019t seem right. Bedford told me, \u201cIt\u2019s\nlike Nabisco releasing a baked wheat chip and saying, \u2018O.K., you can take\nthis, make it to your own standards, and when you\u2019re done call it a Triscuit.\u2019\n\u201d In 2003, as a result of a four-billion-dollar state budget deficit, the\nbreeding program\u2019s budget had been slashed by nearly two-thirds and it was\ndepending on the royalties the Honeycrisp generated to support its work.\nHurting the brand could damage the whole program.\n\nMeanwhile, Bedford had his eye on a new apple, MN 1914, one of the offspring\nof a 1988 cross he made of Honeycrisp and Zestar, another Minnesota-bred\napple. He mentioned it to Courtier, who visited the mother tree, tasted the\napple, and loved it. \u201cIt had everything Honeycrisp had, and it had this other\nthing, too, this tropical thing,\u201d Courtier recalled. In 2006, the university\nreleased it as a named variety. But instead of an \u201copen release,\u201d which meant\nthat anyone could grow the apple, the university decided to release MN 1914 as\na \u201cmanaged variety,\u201d or what\u2019s known in the business as a \u201cclub apple.\u201d The\nuniversity would grant a license to an outside company, which would establish\na consortium that could market and grow the apple nationally. Growers could\napply to the consortium for permission to grow the apple and, if accepted,\nwould be obliged to sign a lengthy contract stipulating how and where they\ncould grow it, as well as where they could sell it.\n\nManaged varieties of apple had been pioneered by Australia\u2019s state-run apple-\nbreeding program in the nineties, with its Pink Lady variety, and the\nHoneycrisp had been released as a managed variety in Europe in 2000. But no\nlarge-scale university breeding program had ever released a managed variety of\napple in the U.S. As Jim Luby, the head of the Fruit Breeding Program at the\nuniversity and Bedford\u2019s boss, explained to me, \u201cThere was some discussion\nabout how this would be perceived by the state\u2019s growers.\u201d After all, the new\napple, like the twenty-six varieties that had come before it, had been\ncreated, in part, with public funds (though, with budget cuts, the tax-based\nshare of the funding was declining). And, as a land-grant institution, the\nuniversity had a long and distinguished record of passing its agricultural\nadvances along to the state\u2019s farmers. Nevertheless, in the interest of\nquality control, and to maximize the revenue stream from the apple, the\nuniversity decided to manage the release. Also, in addition to patenting the\napple tree, which was called Minneiska, the university would trademark the\napple itself. Growers would be obliged to pay royalties on both the tree and\nits fruit.\n\nThe university asked for proposals to lead the consortium from some of the\nstate\u2019s growers. Pepin Heights Orchards won the job. Bedford and Courtier came\nup with a name for the apple, SweeTango, and Courtier called the consortium,\nwith some hubris, Next Big Thing. Minnesota growers who did not wish to join\nwere allowed to plant up to a thousand trees\u2014subsequently increased to three\nthousand\u2014but could sell the apples only at farmers\u2019 markets, local grocery\nstores, and farm stands. Only Next Big Thing was entitled to sell the apples\ncommercially\u2014i.e., to wholesalers and grocers. \u201cWhen you sell the apples at\nyour farm stand, people know who grew them,\u201d Luby explained. \u201cBut when you\nsell them to a grocery store you the grower are anonymous, as far as the\nconsumer is concerned, and that\u2019s where quality issues creep in. We wanted to\navoid that.\u201d Growers outside Minnesota weren\u2019t allowed to grow SweeTango at\nall, unless they joined Next Big Thing.\n\nFred Wescott, an apple grower in Elgin, Minnesota, had also wanted to lead the\nSweeTango consortium. He didn\u2019t really mind that he lost out to Dennis\nCourtier, he said. \u201cWhat bothers me is the way the university set this up.\nDennis Courtier is the big winner, and we are the losers, and it didn\u2019t have\nto be that way.\u201d By denying Minnesota growers the right to grow and market the\nSweeTango as they see fit, he went on, including selling it commercially, the\nuniversity was threatening their livelihood; many of the state\u2019s growers were\nunhappy with the SweeTango model, he added. \u201cLet\u2019s say this turns out to be\nanother Honeycrisp, one of the biggest national varieties\u2014which I don\u2019t think\nit will, because it\u2019s not an apple of that calibre\u2014but if it did, and we\nweren\u2019t able to grow it for commercial production, that would have a\ndevastating impact on our business. Devastating.\u201d\n\nAnother grower, Karl Townsend, noted that both Cornell and Washington State\nUniversity were preparing to release new varieties of apples, which out-of-\nstate growers would not be able to grow, while all in-state growers could. (In\nNew York, growers must join an industry-wide co\u00f6perative, New York Apple\nGrowers.) \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t the university have come up with a hybrid model like\nthat as opposed to the model of letting one grower, Pepin Heights, control the\nwhole thing? It would have brought just as much revenue for the university.\u201d I\nmentioned quality control. \u201cThat is all smoke,\u201d Wescott replied. \u201cLook, the\namount of apples grown in Minnesota is minuscule\u2014we are talking about a couple\nhundred thousand boxes of fruit, out of two hundred and thirty million boxes\ngrown nationwide. Most of SweeTango is coming from Nova Scotia, Washington,\nNew York, and Michigan. And, based on the SweeTangos I am seeing in the store,\nthe quality varies just as widely as any other apple.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s another thing,\u201d Wescott added, his voice rising. \u201cI\u2019m seeing\nSweeTangos grown in Michigan being marketed in grocery stores in Minnesota as\na local variety, right alongside the varieties we are growing. So in effect\nwhat\u2019s happening is the university has become our competitor, and they have a\ngreat advantage, because they\u2019re the only ones that have this new apple\neveryone is bragging on, and you know how people in Minnesota are when it\ncomes to apples.\u201d\n\nI could understand why Wescott would see Dennis Courtier as the villain, but I\nhad also heard Courtier described as a \u201cvisionary\u201d by an out-of-state\ngrower\u2014Brian Nicholson, of Red Jacket Orchards\u2014for more or less the same\nreasons. In any case, Courtier\u2019s ambitions are larger than Minnesota. Pepin\nHeights and the university have discussed a multiyear plan to take SweeTango\nto Europe, the Antipodes, and the Far East, where its candy-sweet flesh is\nexpected to appeal to Asian palates. I once asked Courtier if his plan was\nworld domination. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to grow a great apple,\u201d he replied, \u201cand I\ndon\u2019t know how else you do it.\u201d\n\nSweeTango may prove to be the crown on Minnesota\u2019s unlikely triumph as an\napple-breeding state, but it will be a crown of thorns to some. It could only\nhave come from Minnesota, but its potential is too great to give it to\nMinnesota\u2019s growers without restrictions. It appears that what\u2019s best for an\napple is not always best for the people who grow it. In the case of SweeTango,\nthe apple\u2019s interests prevailed.\n\nI went back to Fairway not long ago, to get some more SweeTangos. I had come\nto love the apple, and although I agree with a friend of mine who described\nthe taste as \u201cPhotoshopped,\u201d I found myself remembering the crunch of the\napple\u2019s flesh against my teeth. It was like hearing with your mouth, or\ntasting music. I wanted that experience again.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any SweeTangos in the produce aisle, and when I asked an\nemployee where they had gone she had no idea what I was talking about. I\nfollowed her around while she asked several clerks where the apple had gone.\nOne thought it might be upstairs in Organic (I checked; it wasn\u2019t); another\nsuggested I return in a couple of weeks. Finally, a third clerk, who was\nwheeling a pallet of Gala apples along the aisle, told me there were some\nboxes downstairs, and he would go and bring one up.\n\nI bought as many SweeTangos as I could carry, walked out onto Broadway, and\nstood on the sidewalk with an apple in my hand, my fingers not quite\nencircling its girth, feeling the chill of the Fairway basement in the center\nof my palm. I stared at the skin, and the lenticels gazed indifferently back\nat me, as I contemplated man\u2019s long and sometimes discordant relationship with\nthis fruit. Then I set my teeth on its skin, and crunched. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the November 21, 2011, issue.\n\nJohn Seabrook has been a contributor to The New Yorker since 1989 and became a\nstaff writer in 1993.
