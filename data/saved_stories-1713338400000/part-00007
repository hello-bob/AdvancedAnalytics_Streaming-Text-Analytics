Due in part to its utility in other disciplines as well as\n> its role in student learning, institutions of higher education (IHEs) often\n> have large numbers of mathematics faculty with different balances of\n> teaching and research in different ranks and appointment structures. Most\n> flagship IHEs, especially state land-grant institutions, have large\n> undergraduate populations taking mathematics courses in many cases built\n> around the widespread use of calculus and the connections between\n> mathematics and science, technology, and engineering. These connections have\n> made mathematics departments essential to universities\\cite{olson2012engage}\n> and emphasized the critical role math plays in supporting student success\n> \\cites{reinholz2020time,calcscience} in all areas of post-secondary\n> education. We tend to take that essential nature of mathematics at the\n> undergraduate level, and for research universities at the graduate level, as\n> a given, but that characterization no longer holds for some IHEs.\n\nSubjects:| History and Overview (math.HO)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.09360 [math.HO]  \n(or arXiv:2404.09360v1 [math.HO] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.09360arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \nJournal reference:| Notices of the American Mathematical Society, 71 (2024\nMay), no. 5, 656-663  \nRelated DOI:| https://doi.org/10.1090/noti2934DOI(s) linking to related\nresources  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Edgar Fuller Jr [view email] [v1] Sun, 14 Apr 2024 21:22:55 UTC (1,540\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Are University Budget Cuts Becoming A Threat to\nMathematics? with Additional Discussion, by Edgar J.
