(2022) propose three methods for estimating a\n> compute-optimal scaling law. We attempt to replicate their third estimation\n> procedure, which involves fitting a parametric loss function to a\n> reconstruction of data from their plots. We find that the reported estimates\n> are inconsistent with their first two estimation methods, fail at fitting\n> the extracted data, and report implausibly narrow confidence intervals--\n> intervals this narrow would require over 600,000 experiments, while they\n> likely only ran fewer than 500. In contrast, our rederivation of the scaling\n> law using the third approach yields results that are compatible with the\n> findings from the first two estimation procedures described by Hoffmann et\n> al.\n\nSubjects:| Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.10102 [cs.AI]  \n(or arXiv:2404.10102v1 [cs.AI] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Tamay Besiroglu [view email] [v1] Mon, 15 Apr 2024 19:19:56 UTC (947 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Chinchilla Scaling: A replication attempt, by\nTamay Besiroglu and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AI\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2024-04\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
