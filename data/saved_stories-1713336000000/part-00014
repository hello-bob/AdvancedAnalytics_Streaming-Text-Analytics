Sponsored by Senators Bill Cassidy\n(R-Louisiana) and Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) and House members Maria Elvira\nSalazar (R-Florida) and Adriano Espaillat (D-New York), the Americas Act seeks\nto create a partnership to increase trade and prosperity a well as counter\nChina\u2019s growing influence in the region. In this explainer we examine the\nAmericas Act, its key provisions and impact for the region, and the prospects\nfor its passage.\n\nWhat exactly is the Americas Act, and why is it significant?\n\nThe Americas Act aims to rally countries across the Western Hemisphere,\ncreating regional trade, investment, and people-to-people partnerships to\nstimulate growth and integration through viable long-term private sector\ndevelopment. Intended, in the first instance, for Americas Partnership for\nEconomic Prosperity (APEP) member states (Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia,\nCosta Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay),\nthe bill establishes a set of guiding principles on democratic governance,\ntrade, and rule of law. Benefits for participating countries include better\naccess to the U.S. market, loans and grants to near-shoring industries from\nChina, targeted programs to increase the competitiveness of strategic regional\nsupply chains, among others.\n\nThe bill stands out for three reasons. First, it represents the most\ncomprehensive U.S. policy attempt to deepen relations with the Western\nHemisphere in more than two decades. Following the collapse of the\nnegotiations to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) in 2003,\nsuccessive U.S. administrations opted for negotiating less comprehensive\nbilateral trade deals. The Americas Act marks a return to policies inspired by\ndeeply rooted hemispheric values of regional integration, cooperation, trade,\nand democracy promotion. Expectations are high. Historically, the most\neffective U.S. policies towards the region, such as President Franklin Delano\nRoosvelt\u2019s Good Neighbor policy and President Kennedy\u2019s Alliance for Progress,\ncontained a strong pan-American integration component.\n\nSecond, the bill is a major effort to offset China\u2019s increasing influence in\nthe hemisphere. Coincidentally, just as the U.S. moved away from broader\nregional integration plans two decades ago, China\u2019s economic ties with the\nLatin American and the Caribbean region began to grow exponentially. Today,\nChina has surpassed the U.S. as Latin America\u2019s largest trading partner. The\nAmericas Act comes amid mounting concerns about Washington\u2019s lack of strategic\nvision for its role within its traditional sphere of influence. From securing\nthe critical minerals supply chains to investments on infrastructure and the\nintroduction of telecommunications technology, the region has become a\ndecisive battleground in the great power struggle between the United States\nand China.\n\nThird, the American Act is backed by a bipartisan coalition. In the context of\nextreme political polarization and an election year, the introduction of a\npiece of legislation that includes provisions on politically sensitive issues\nsuch as expanding free trade represents a significant step forward. After four\ndecades negotiating free trade agreements, the election of president Donald\nTrump in 2016 marked a turning point for trade liberalization for the United\nStates. Ever since, despite renegotiating NAFTA (today USMCA) in 2020,\nDemocrats and Republicans alike backed away from major trade negotiations\nincluding the Trans-Pacific Partnership and EU-U.S. trade talks. The Americas\nAct could signify a step towards returning to trade liberalization as a tool\nto increase geopolitical influence.\n\nWhat are the specific provisions within the Americas Act and their potential\nimpact?\n\nThe bill contains a series of provisions on three key issues, including\ninvestment promotion, free trade expansion, and people-to-people cooperation.\nBenefits are available to U.S. citizens and businesses, as well as countries\nthroughout the hemisphere. Membership to the partnership requires a commitment\nto a set of standards on democratic principles, rule of law, and trade.\nIneligible countries include the member states of the Bolivarian Alliance for\nthe Peoples of the Americas, as well as countries that do not comply with the\nInter-American Democratic Charter. By seeking to close trade loopholes \u2013\nincluding banning China and Russia to be eligible for de minimis privilege \u2013\nthe bill aims to be fully funded, raising an estimate of over $15 billion a\nyear in new revenue.\n\nAmong the most significant provisions, the bill aims to create a series of\nmechanisms to harmonize regional trade agreements as well as expand free\ntrade. This would create economies of scale and reduce the cost of investment\nand manufacturing in the region. Today the U.S. maintains bilateral trade\ndeals with Chile, Colombia, Panama, and Peru, as well as regional trade\nagreements, including the CAFTA-DR (Costa Rica, El Salvador,Guatemala,\nHonduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic), and the USMCA (Canada and\nMexico).\n\nThe mechanisms for trade harmonization include the potential establishment of\na docking mechanism to the USMCA\u2014considered the gold standard of trade\nagreements\u2014opening a path for partnership countries to become USMCA members.\nThe bill identifies Uruguay and Costa Rica as ideal candidates to pilot an\naccession process, due to their income levels and relatively small populations\nand economies. The bill seeks to unilaterally provide Ecuador and Uruguay\nmarket access for certain goods under the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership\nAct (CBTPA).\n\nAimed at countering Chinese control over global manufacturing industries,\ninvestment provisions include financing for re-shoring and near-shoring\nindustry from China. It establishes up to $70 billion in loans and grants to\ncompanies in the U.S. and partnership countries to re-shore and re-near\nindustry and an additional tax-credit system of $10 billion for associated\nexpenses. The bill prioritizes increasing the competitiveness of the regional\ntextile and apparel industry as well as bolstering the region\u2019s energy sector.\nTo this end, it establishes a $105 million per year textile and apparel\nmanufacturing program and a program to advance regional energy independence\nand channel renewable energy investments. The bill increases the Development\nFinance Coorporation\u2019s (DFC) total borrowing authority from $60 billion to $90\nbillion, eliminating restrictions on high income countries in the region.\n\nAdditionally, the Americas Act strengthens people-to-people cooperation\nefforts, including enhancing funding for USAID projects as well as the\nestablishment of The American University of the Americas. Among other\nprovisions it also aims at expanding the State Department\u2019s visa waiver\nprogram to Uruguay and Costa Rica.\n\nWhat are the prospects for the Americas Act\u2019s passage?\n\nThe Americas Act contains provisions that can appeal to a broader group of\nlawmakers with different interests. The bill not only builds on existing\ninitiatives such as APEP or the USMCA, but also it represents a major\nopportunity for the U.S. to increase its political and economic ties with the\nregion as well as countering China\u2019s economic influence in the Western\nHemisphere. Expanding trade remains one of the U.S. most effective tools for\nincreasing U.S. geopolitical influence. In a recent annual U.S. Congress House\nhearing General Laura Richardson of United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM)\nstated that increasing American investments remains imperative to counter\nChina, adding that \u201cEconomic Security is National Security, and many of the\nchallenges in the Americas are directly tied to a lack of economic investment\nand opportunity.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite securing bipartisan support as well as interest from private\nsector leaders, the White House, and countries across the region, it is\nunlikely that the Americas Act will get passed in the current Congress. In an\nhigh-stakes election year and with little appetite to discuss comprehensive\npieces of legislation, Washington remains extremely polarized. The 118th\nCongress will likely become the least productive congressional session in\nmodern times: with 34 bills passed in the first year, it has become the\ncongressional session with the lowest number of bills passed since the Great\nDepression.\n\nSome provisions of the Americas Act have a good chance of being passed by a\nfuture Congress, though support from the executive branch remains uncertain.\nFor these provisions to become law, their visibility must be increased,\nemphasizing the benefits for the U.S. economy and the U.S. position vis-\u00e0-vis\nChina in the region. Stronger consensus and support from members of Congress\nand the next administration will be crucial for its enactment in the short\nterm. Additionally, garnering support for the bill in capitals throughout the\nregion could help to secure greater backing from the executive branch.\n\nPrevPrevious\n\n## More Commentary\n\n### Once Flying High, Chile\u2019s Boric Falls to Earth\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nRealizing the need to make adjustments, Boric has shifted towards the center\nin his selection of ministers and trimmed his legislative priorities, but it\nincreasingly looks like he has missed his moment.\n\nRead more >\n\n### Explaining and Predicting: Why Ecuador Flouted International Norms to\nArrest Its Former Vice President\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nShould Noboa be successful, we are likely to see more such leaderships emerge\nin the region, and a public willing to sacrifice some liberties in favor of a\nsense of increased security.\n\nRead more >\n\n### Who Will Lead Panama?
