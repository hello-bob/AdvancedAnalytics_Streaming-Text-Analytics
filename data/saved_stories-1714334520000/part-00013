GPT-2 may be older\nbut is perfectly relevant, being the granddaddy of modern LLMs (large language\nmodels) with a clear heritage to more modern offerings.\n\nLLMs are fantastically good at communicating despite not actually knowing what\nthey are saying, and training them usually relies on PyTorch deep learning\nlibrary, itself written in Python. llm.c takes a simpler approach by\nimplementing the neural network training algorithm for GPT-2 directly. The\nresult is highly focused and surprisingly short: about a thousand lines of C\nin a single file. It is a highly elegant process that does the same thing the\nbigger, clunkier methods accomplish. It can run entirely on a CPU, or it can\ntake advantage of GPU acceleration, where available.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time [Andrej Karpathy] has bent his considerable skills\nand understanding towards boiling down these sorts of concepts into bare-bones\nimplementations. We previously covered a project of his that is the \u201chello\nworld\u201d of GPT, a tiny model that predicts the next bit in a given sequence and\noffers low-level insight into just how GPT (generative pre-trained\ntransformer) models work.\n\nPosted in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Software\nDevelopmentTagged ai, GPT, GPT-2, LLM\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.\n(Comment Policy)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
