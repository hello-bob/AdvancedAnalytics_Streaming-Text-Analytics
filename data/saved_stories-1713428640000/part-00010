Sham\n\nChemistry professor Tson-Kong (T.K.) Sham and his colleagues recently\nconfirmed a new synchrotron imaging technique they developed is just as\neffective for retrieving corroded daguerreotypes \u2013 the earliest form of\nphotographs \u2013 as a strategy they first reported in 2018, and can also be used\nno matter how badly damaged the image surface is from natural corrosion or\ncleaning attempts. The new research, which used beamlines at the Canadian\nLight Source (CLS) at the University of Saskatchewan, is published in the\nJournal of Cultural Heritage.\n\n\u201cThis technique can be used widely in all walks of science, from looking at\ntissues to materials science,\u201d Sham said.\n\n\u201cYou could determine whether or how a metal may be corrosion-resistant. Or in\nthe case of an already corroded material, you can learn what the product of\nthat corrosion is and its distribution on the surface, and then you can work\nback and think about how to prevent that corrosion from happening.\u201d\n\nSham said many applications are possible because synchrotron X-ray is very\ntunable, which means it can pick out any element and find out what its\nchemical surrounding is and where it is placed in the sample, even imaging it\nlayer by layer.\n\nWhen it comes to the conservation of antiques, Sham\u2019s research could be a game\nchanger, especially for studying artifacts or fossils that have severe surface\ndeterioration.\n\nAs part of his new research, he uncovered images of a man and woman\nfashionably dressed in mid-1850s garments, and one of a baby wrapped in\ncovers. All of these daguerreotypes, belonging to private collectors and the\nNational Gallery of Canada, were badly damaged \u2014 slow deterioration mixed with\ncleaning attempts may have caused the tarnish.\n\nSham proved this synchrotron technique is always effective as long as the\nimage particles underneath the tarnish remain intact, a discovery advancing\nhis 2018 study in Scientific Reports. This research was done using the VESPERS\nand the SXRMB beamlines at the CLS and at the Advanced Photon Source at\nArgonne National Laboratory near Chicago.\n\n\u201cRevealing images that seemed lost forever is what\u2019s most exciting,\u201d Sham\nsaid. \u201cWe get a glimpse of people living in the 19th century that we wouldn\u2019t\nhave otherwise and learn about their history and culture.\u201d\n\nTarnished daguerreotype of a baby (left) and image retrieved using the\nAdvanced Photon Source (right) through CLS@APS partnership agreement.\n(National Gallery of Canada, via Canadian Light Source)\n\nTarnished daguerreotype portrait of an elegant lady (left, from private\ncollection).

Images published in\nthe Journal of Cultural Heritage 67 (2024) 53\u201361. (Canadian Light Source)\n\nEach daguerreotype is unique \u2013 there are no negatives. Invented in 1839 and\nonly popular for about 25 years, daguerreotypes are silver-coated copper\nplates treated with specific chemicals such as bromine gas to make them light-\nsensitive. Once placed in a camera, the cap would be removed to \u201cimpress\u201d the\nimage on the plates \u2013 a time-consuming process. Then, the plates would be\ntreated with mercury vapor to fix the images permanently.\n\nSham\u2019s new research also showed the same X-rays that can help researchers\n\u201csee\u201d through the corrosion on the surface of daguerreotypes can also \u2013\nindirectly \u2014 lead to damaging the plates.\n\n\u201cX-ray usually doesn\u2019t damage metals visibly, so I didn\u2019t think it would\naffect the plates, but perhaps chemical impurities or the corrosion itself on\nthe daguerreotype got heated and left a small mark where the X-ray beam light\nwent through,\u201d he said.\n\nSham recently returned to CLS for a follow-up study to learn how to preserve\nthe plates. This ongoing research will investigate the chemical composition of\nthe tarnish, and how glass covers and frames that store daguerreotypes could\naffect deterioration.\n\nTopic Research\n\n#### SHARE THIS STORY\n\n## Up Next ...\n\n## Western partnership drives push for international standard on flushable\nproducts\n\nStudents work with City of London to seek data, solutions for flushable wipes\n\n## Related Stories\n\n#### New nanomaterial may solve long-standing fuel cell issue\n\nWestern research team uses cobalt to make fuel cells more robust, sustainable\n\n#### Expert insight: Cobalt nanoparticles could be a significant player for\nclean energy\n\nResearch team at Western University is innovating ways to make more\nsustainable fuel cells\n\n#### Funding for Western nuclear energy projects fuels a safe future\n\nResearchers Hamidreza Abdolvand and Samantha Gateman are studying safe\nproduction and used fuel storage for small modular reactors\n\n## Popular This Week\n\n  * \u2018Revealing images that seemed lost forever:\u2019 Research revives 1800s photos 246 views\n  * Two-dimensional nanomaterial sets record for expert-defying, counter-intuitive expansion 209 views\n  * Western team designs platform to illustrate census data since 1951 165 views\n\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n  * Follow\n\n\u00a9 1878 \u2013 2024 Western University\n\nWestern University 1151 Richmond Street London, Ontario, Canada, N6A 3K7 Tel:\n519-661-2111\n\nContact Us Privacy | Web Standards | Terms of Use | Accessibility\n\nTopics\n\n  * All News\n  * Research & Innovation\n  * Campus & Community\n  * Students\n  * Alumni\n  * Teaching\n  * Expert Commentary\n\nWestern News\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Media Relations\n  * Western Communications\n  * Western University\n\n", "frontpage": false}
