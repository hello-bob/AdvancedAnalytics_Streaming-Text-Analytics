This is our lineup for the latest edition of the Animation\nObsessive newsletter:\n\n  * 1) How Don Bluth started an animation revolution in his garage.\n\n  * 2) The animation news worldwide.\n\nA tidbit before we start \u2014 a legal YouTube channel called Filmy \u010desky has been\nsharing classic Czech animation. That includes the funny and very weird\nCleansing Bath by V\u00e1clav Bed\u0159ich, and (deeper in its catalog) the even\nstranger Crabs.\n\nWith that, here we go!\n\n#\n\n1 \u2013 An accidental uprising\n\nStudying the art of animation has never been easier \u2014 even if you don\u2019t go to\nschool for it. Blender is a powerhouse, and the software that Studio Ghibli\nused to make Spirited Away has been free for years. On the internet, all the\nworld\u2019s animation is at your fingertips. And online tutorials break down every\npart of production.\n\nToday, popular animators like Ian Worthington and Preston Mutanga are teaching\nthemselves.\n\nSo, it\u2019s hard to picture Don Bluth\u2019s situation. Back in the early 1970s, he\nwas the up-and-comer at Disney. Walt had died a few years before, and the\nfamous Nine Old Men were getting older. The studio still trained new talent \u2014\nbut Disney\u2019s classic filmmaking had started to slip away, right alongside the\nveterans who\u2019d pioneered it.\n\nIt was a scary time. The reins hadn\u2019t been passed at Disney quite like this\nbefore, and much had already been lost since the studio\u2019s best years.\n\nAs Bluth remembered, older technical tricks like the \u201cshadows or the\nreflections or the double passes through the camera\u201d were \u201cevaporating before\nour very eyes.\u201d1 The problem was bigger than that, too. Bluth and many of the\nother young trainees didn\u2019t know how to make a movie, and they weren\u2019t sure\nhow to learn. According to Bluth\u2019s colleague Gary Goldman, \u201cWe didn\u2019t even\nknow what questions to ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were learning to animate,\u201d Goldman explained. \u201cWe were learning to in-\nbetween, clean up ... and we said, \u2018Wait, there\u2019s so much more we need to\nknow.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat included writing, scene planning, editing and more. Even the Nine Old Men\nhad \u201cforgotten\u201d much of what went into Disney\u2019s older films, said animator\nJohn Pomeroy. Speaking to the press in the \u201870s, Bluth described this\nunsettling moment:\n\n> I was watching The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice part of Fantasia recently and I\n> marveled to Ken Anderson, one of the veterans, about the water. It was so\n> transparent. So wet. I asked Ken how they did it. ... The man who created\n> that water is long gone, Ken told me, and no one ever did get around to\n> writing the process down. \u201cNice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never gotten it\n> that way again.\u201d\n>\n> If that happens in too many areas, the whole heritage is gone.2\n\nBut how to stop the decline? That was the thing \u2014 the new recruits weren\u2019t\neven allowed to use the studio\u2019s tools to rediscover techniques through trial\nand error. As Bluth said:\n\n> Disney was a union house. We couldn\u2019t touch any of their equipment to\n> experiment ... We couldn\u2019t even plug the Moviola in to look at what we were\n> doing. Or use a cutter, or anything, because it was all union. And we were\n> not in that union.\n\nManagement said that the Nine Old Men would retire within five or six years.\nBluth, Goldman and the rest would soon fill their shoes \u2014 with only a\nrudimentary sketch of what the masters once knew. They needed, and wanted, to\nlearn faster.\n\nHoping to bridge the gaps in their knowledge, Bluth started a side project. An\nindependent cartoon made with independent equipment. In his garage.\n\nPhotos from Bluth\u2019s home studio (courtesy of the Banjo DVD and the Don Bluth\nFacebook page). Top right is Heidi Guedel in the garage, bottom left is Bluth,\nbottom right is Bluth and Skip Jones.\n\nMore photos of the studio (courtesy of the DVD and Facebook page)\n\nThe idea to make a garage film didn\u2019t stem from a desire to escape Disney. \u201cWe\nwere actually very enthusiastic about working at Walt Disney Productions,\nalmost obsessive about it,\u201d Goldman noted. What they needed was a space to\nlearn \u2014 by doing, by trying things and by making lots of mistakes.\n\nThe Disney studio couldn\u2019t offer that, and so the garage became their school.\nBluth called it their \u201csanctuary.\u201d\n\nAccording to Goldman, Bluth already owned a Moviola and an editing bench that\nhe used to study \u201cold 16 mm Warner Bros. animation reels.\u201d Gathering a few\nmore production tools, a small team formed in 1972. They wanted to make a\nshort called The Piper, based on a long limerick written by Bluth\u2019s brother.\n\nBluth, Goldman, Pomeroy and a rotating cast of others spent years on The Piper\nalongside their Disney work.3 The de facto head of Disney\u2019s animation branch\nsince Walt\u2019s death, Woolie Reitherman, supported their efforts to learn.\n\nAnd they learned quite a bit, often the hard way. They ended up storyboarding\n20 minutes of The Piper and animating around four (watch a few seconds here).\nIn 1975, they brought in the legendary John Lounsbery to assess it. Bluth:\n\n> It was excruciatingly painful, actually embarrassing to watch with one of\n> the Disney animation masters sitting in my living room. It was then that we\n> realized that the story wasn\u2019t appropriate for a short; too much information\n> in too short of a time ... The very next weekend we decided to scrap The\n> Piper and chose something simpler.4\n\nThat simpler project became Banjo the Woodpile Cat. The idea was based on a\nkitten from Bluth\u2019s childhood. They planned to make the film in a year \u2014 which\nseemed doable enough when work began in March 1975.\n\nBanjo wouldn\u2019t pull across the finish line until December 1979.\n\nSome of Bluth\u2019s storyboards for Banjo (from \u201cThe Story Behind Banjo\u201d)\n\nBluth story sketches for the film (courtesy of the Bluth Facebook page)\n\nBanjo turned into \u201can underground animation campus,\u201d in Pomeroy\u2019s words. The\nlearning environment proved magnetic \u2014 many Disney staffers came through to\nwork part-time. Animator Linda Miller remembered that she \u201cwanted to learn\nmore about filmmaking ... and it also seemed more exciting than the projects\nthat Disney was working on.\u201d\n\nLooking back, artist Vera Pacheco was effusive. \u201cI was able to learn things\nthat Disney didn\u2019t even offer training for at the studio,\u201d she said. That\nincluded inking and painting, animation checking and even \u201chow to fill out an\nX-sheet.\u201d\n\nDisney\u2019s people showed up at Bluth\u2019s garage after work and on weekends. \u201cThey\nwould teach animation to any artist interested,\u201d animator Dorse Lanpher wrote.\nA number of women from the studio got involved \u2014 around four minutes of Banjo\nwere animated by Linda Miller, Heidi Guedel, Emily Jiuliano and Lorna Cook. If\nsomeone wanted to learn, Bluth said, they \u201cnever turned anyone away.\u201d\n\nThis was a very-1970s guerrilla production. Before it was over, Goldman had\nstolen rain and snow overlays from Disney\u2019s garbage. A young Glen Keane\ncreated the sound effects for a truck\u2019s exhaust pipe. Bluth, Goldman and\nPomeroy animated most of the film, but Bluth\u2019s main memory of Banjo was mixing\ncel paint by his swimming pool.\n\nPhotos from the home studio in the \u201870s \u2014 top is Bluth and Jim George, bottom\nis Sally Voorheis working on an animation desk (they had to build their own).\nCourtesy of the Bluth Facebook page.\n\nGradually, the production (and the rows of work desks) outgrew Bluth\u2019s garage\nand took over his whole Culver City home. Guedel recalled that Bluth\n\u201cliterally lived with only his own single bed and a dresser in his small\nbedroom\u201d \u2014 every other space \u201cwas filled with animation equipment.\u201d During the\nbusiest periods, Banjo artists slept where they worked and sleeping bags\ndotted Bluth\u2019s house.\n\nThe storyboards for Banjo were all Bluth\u2019s. He handled them in his detailed\nstyle \u2014 trying to create a clear blueprint for the team. John Pomeroy built on\nthese sketches with ink and sometimes color. A single Bluth drawing could act\n\u201cas layout, pose test for the animator and then eventually a ... color sketch\nfor background and lighting and effects,\u201d as Pomeroy said.\n\nWhile they learned about film production, Bluth and his colleagues also\nstudied the storytelling rules that had once powered Snow White and Bambi. In\nhis autobiography, Bluth made mention of \u201cdog-eared books about\nscreenwriting,\u201d and of discussions about conflict, motivations, character\nflaws, themes.\n\nAll of the learning quickly started to pay off. The group went into The\nRescuers (1977) energized, with \u201can eye focused on the story, not merely the\nquality of the animation,\u201d according to Bluth. When he got the co-director\nrole on Pete\u2019s Dragon (1977), he consistently relied on lessons from Banjo.\nPomeroy did the same as an animator on Pete\u2019s Dragon, solving complex problems\nby thinking back to his work at Bluth\u2019s place.\n\nPictured at Disney during The Rescuers, from left to right: John Pomeroy, Don\nBluth, Gary Goldman and Andy Gaskill. Courtesy of the Bluth Facebook page.\n\nNot everyone at Disney, though, was amused by Bluth and the Banjo project.\nFeuds formed at the studio, and some were derogatory toward the \u201cBluthies\u201d in\nthe garage. The younger set from CalArts, like Brad Bird and John Musker,\nshared Bluth\u2019s unhappiness with Disney \u2014 but they didn\u2019t get along with him,\neither.\n\nBluth was a traditionalist and a charismatic figure. To some CalArts upstarts,\nhe may have resembled a cult leader, and they called him \u201carrogant, self-\nserving and an elitist.\u201d They were on Bluth\u2019s team when he directed The Small\nOne (1978) at Disney, and the fighting was explosive. The area of the studio\noccupied by the CalArts people came to be known, proudly, as \u201cThe Rat\u2019s Nest\u201d\n\u2014 after Bluth described it that way.5\n\nIn the late \u201870s, Bluth went public with his thoughts on the Disney youth.\n\u201cThe new bunch were arrogant, they refused to listen and got mad if you tried\nto press them. You\u2019d explain a drawing to them, then look around and see they\nhad wandered off,\u201d he told the papers. Neither side could understand the\nother.6\n\nAdding to the trouble, Banjo itself was dragging on and on. Bluth again:\n\n> About four years into this ... we wondered if we would ever recoup our\n> investment of time and money. Then, in late 1978, we thought, what if we\n> took it to Disney, they might agree to buy it and let us finish it there\n> during regular work hours.\n\nDisney wasn\u2019t interested. Combined with Bluth\u2019s bad experience on The Small\nOne, the writing was on the wall. Only some of the younger people at Disney\nwanted to follow his lead \u2014 and there was a sense among the garage artists\nthat Disney\u2019s management didn\u2019t care to implement most of the lessons from\nBanjo.\n\n\u201cAll of our learning is only going to do us any good,\u201d Pomeroy remembered\nthinking, \u201cif the higher-ups will accept what we\u2019re trying to make happen.\u201d\n\nDon Bluth and his fellow defectors in September 1979 (courtesy of the Bluth\nFacebook page)\n\nMuch has been written about the moment when Bluth, Goldman and Pomeroy quit\nDisney in September 1979. It was a huge event in the animation world, even\nhitting the national news. The late Michael Sporn once wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t\nexaggerate the excitement this caused in the \u2018young\u2019 animators at the time \u2014\neven 3,000 miles away.\u201d\n\nQuite a few who\u2019d learned at Bluth\u2019s school-studio came along, including\nDisney\u2019s entire staff of women animators. At Disney, Bluth told The New York\nTimes, women were rarely allowed to advance past the assistant role in\nanimation. Given a chance to learn more, figures like Lorna Cook became forces\nof nature.\n\nBanjo made the departure possible \u2014 and not just because it taught the team\nhow to make a movie. Outside investors had asked Bluth and Goldman, while they\nwere at Disney, if they\u2019d be willing to quit and do their own film. Bluth only\nhad to prove he could make one. He showed them Banjo, which was \u201cabout 90\npercent animated and about 70 percent in color,\u201d and got handed millions to\nfinish it and to make The Secret of NIMH.\n\nAt the newly official Don Bluth Productions, Banjo had a nail-biting final\ncrunch. It managed a limited run in California during December 1979, and later\naired on television. Bluth has readily admitted that the film isn\u2019t a classic.\nBut it did give him and his team the skills to craft one.\n\nAfter four and a half years of learning on Banjo, they had a hunger to make a\ntruly great feature film \u2014 and they finally knew how to do it. Even Banjo\u2019s\nflaws were fuel, in the end. \u201cWhat we were not able to do on Banjo and we were\nlearning on Banjo,\u201d Pomeroy concluded, \u201cwe carried on through The Secret of\nNIMH.\u201d7\n\n#\n\n2 \u2013 Newsbits\n\n  * In Canada, Icon Creative Studio is trying to unionize. This comes at a time of huge union wins in North American animation, including the new one at DreamWorks.\n\n  * In Russia, a group called Vidachestvo is tracking down and scanning prints of old Soviet cartoons in HD, then dropping them on YouTube. Among them are a first-of-its-kind 2K upload of The Tale of Tsar Saltan (1943) and, a few weeks ago, a 2K version of the classic oddity Hen, His Wife (1990).\n\n  * Cartoon Brew has started a weekly Friday livestream \u2014 revealing in the latest one that the American film Coyote vs. Acme is not yet dead. (There were some kind words about our newsletter, too, which we\u2019re very grateful for.)\n\n  * Also on Cartoon Brew, we enjoyed this week\u2019s write-up on Bobe Cannon, the great (greatest?) American animator.\n\n  * In China, the box-office success of The Boy and the Heron continues, despite online controversy over the film\u2019s bewildering story. It\u2019s earned more than $92 million in the country as of this writing, per Maoyan.\n\n  * The stop-motion studio that revived Clangers in England is being liquidated. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said a spokesperson, \u201cover the last 12 months the number of projects being greenlit by broadcasters around the world has been severely cut.\u201d\n\n  * Japanese animator Kazuya Kanehisa talked to Tokyo Sports about his fake ads for products like ChatGPT and the iPhone, done in the style of mid-century cartoons (watch). Kanehisa says he\u2019s planning a new video \u201cbased on a fictional, long-running anime,\u201d tracing the changes it undergoes across the decades.\n\n  * Also in Japan, animator Hidekazu Ohara shared some rare pieces of his concept art for Katsuhiro Otomo\u2019s Cannon Fodder.\n\n  * Vaibhav Studios of India won two awards stateside for Return of the Jungle, its long-awaited feature.\n\n  * As the French film Chicken for Linda! hits America and Japan, its directors have had a roundtable discussion with Sunao Katabuchi (who loves the film), and GKIDS has shown off the special recording process used for the voices.\n\n  * Lastly, we looked into the development of animator Kunio Kato (The House of Small Cubes) over the decades, through his artwork.\n\nSee you again soon!\n\n1\n\nThese quotes from Bluth, and a good deal of the article\u2019s other quotes and\ninformation, come from extras on the Banjo the Woodpile Cat DVD.\n\n2\n\nFrom the Dayton Daily News (November 28, 1978).\n\n3\n\nAs John Cawley wrote in his book The Animated Films of Don Bluth, loose\nexperiments in the garage from 1972 onward gave way to The Piper over time:\n\n> These were initially exercises to relearn some of the techniques of the\n> past. Using their salaries and exercising their stock options they purchased\n> a number of pieces of equipment including a Moviola.\n>\n> These weekend workouts saw almost everyone at the Disney studio drop by. If\n> they felt invigorated, they stayed. If they wanted to go other directions\n> they never came back. Don saw this as a good weeding-out period, helping him\n> locate talent that agreed with his vision.\n\n4\n\nFrom Bluth\u2019s interview in the second volume of On Animation: The Director's\nPerspective.\n\n5\n\nFor more details on this conflict, see the books Pulling a Rabbit Out of a\nHat: The Making of Roger Rabbit, Directing for Animation and Somewhere Out\nThere.\n\n6\n\nSee The Lincoln Star (October 18, 1979).\n\n7\n\nToday\u2019s lead story is a revised and expanded version of an article we first\nran on June 14, 2021.\n\n### Subscribe to Animation Obsessive\n\nHundreds of paid subscribers\n\nExploring the best in animation from all around the world \u2014 part\ninvestigation, part treasure hunt.\n\n75\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Don Bluth's Garage Band\n\nanimationobsessive.substack.com\n\n11\n\nShare\n\n11 Comments\n\nIra FriedwaldApr 15Liked by Animation Obsessive StaffThe Secret of NIMH is a\nclassic.
