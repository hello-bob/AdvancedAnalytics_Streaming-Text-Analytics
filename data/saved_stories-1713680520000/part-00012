It doesn\u2019t take Jude\nlong to realise that he and his fellow craftsmen are, so to speak, the\nmaterial base without which the intellectual superstructure of the colleges\ncouldn\u2019t exist: without their work, as he says, \u2018the hard readers could not\nread, nor the high thinkers live.\u2019 He comes to recognise, in a word, that the\norigin of culture is labour. This is true etymologically as well. One of the\noriginal meanings of the word culture is the tending of natural growth, which\nis to say agriculture, and a cognate word, coulter, means the blade of a\nplough. The kinship between culture and agriculture was brought home to me\nsome years ago when I was driving with the dean of arts of a state university\nin the US past farms blooming with luxuriant crops. \u2018Might get a couple of\nprofessorships out of that,\u2019 the dean remarked.\n\nThis is not the way culture generally likes to see itself. Like the Oedipal\nchild, it tends to disavow its lowly parentage and fantasise that it sprang\nfrom its own loins, self-generating and self-fashioning. Thought, for idealist\nphilosophers, is self-dependent. You can\u2019t nip behind it to something more\nfundamental, since that itself would have to be captured in a thought. Geist\ngoes all the way down.\n\nThere\u2019s an irony here, since few things bind art so closely to its material\ncontext as its claim to stand free of that context. This is because the work\nof art as autonomous and self-determining, an idea born sometime in the late\n18th century, is the model of a version of the human subject that has been\nrapidly gaining ground in actual life. Men and women are now seen as authors\nof themselves, as a result of the deepening influence of liberalism and\npossessive individualism and \u2013 to perpetrate a dreadful clich\u00e9 \u2013 the rise of\nthe middle classes. (If you open a history book at random, it will say three\nthings about the period you light on: it was essentially an age of transition;\nit was a period of rapid change; and the middle classes went on rising. That\u2019s\nthe reason God put the middle classes on earth: to rise like the sun, but,\nunlike the sun, without ever setting.)\n\nYou can\u2019t have culture in the sense of galleries and museums and publishing\nhouses unless society has evolved to the point where it can produce an\neconomic surplus. Only then can some people be released from the business of\nkeeping the tribe alive in order to constitute a caste of priests, bards, DJs,\nhermeneuticists, bassoon players, LRB interns, gaffers on film sets and the\nlike. In fact, you might define culture as a surplus over strict need. We need\nto eat, but we don\u2019t need to eat at the Ivy. We need clothes in cold climates,\nbut they don\u2019t have to be designed by Stella McCartney. The problem with this\ndefinition is that a capacity for surplus is built into the human animal. For\nboth good and ill, we\u2019re continually in excess of ourselves. Culture is\nreckoned into our nature. King Lear is much concerned with this ambiguity.\n\nSince the material production that gives birth to culture is racked by\nconflict, bits of this culture tend to be used from time to time to legitimate\nthe social order that strives to contain or resolve the conflict, and this is\nknown as ideology. Not all culture is ideological at any given time, but any\npart of it, however abstract or high-minded, can serve this function in\nspecific circumstances. At the same time, however, culture can muster vigorous\nresistance to the dominant powers. This resistance is more likely to occur,\ncuriously enough, once art becomes just another commodity in the marketplace\nand the artist just another petty commodity producer. Before that, in\ntraditional or pre-modern society, culture generally serves as an instrument\nof political and religious sovereignty, which means among other things that\nthere are steady jobs for cultural workers as court poets, genealogists,\nlicensed fools, painters and architects patronised by the landed gentry,\ncomposers in the pay of princes and so on. In those situations you also know\nmore or less whom you are writing or painting for, whereas in the marketplace\nyour audience becomes anonymous.\n\nThe world no longer owes the cultural worker a living. Ironically, however,\nit\u2019s the integration of art into the market that gives it a degree of freedom.\nOnce it\u2019s primarily a commodity, culture becomes autonomous. Deprived of its\ntraditional features, it may curve back on itself, taking itself as its own\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre in the manner of some modernist art; it is also free to serve as\ncritique on a sizeable scale for the first time. The miseries of\ncommodification are also an enthralling moment of emancipation. History, as\nMarx reminds us, progresses by its bad side. In the very process of being\npushed to the margin, the artist begins to claim visionary, prophetic,\nbohemian or subversive status \u2013 partly because those on the edges can indeed\nsometimes see further than those in the middle, but also to compensate for a\nloss of centrality. A movement called Romanticism is born.\n\nAt roughly the same time, so is industrial capitalism, which with admirable\nconvenience gives culture a job to do just as it\u2019s in danger of being driven\nout by philistine mill-owners. There\u2019s now a growing divide between the\nsymbolic realm and the world of utility, a divide that runs all the way down\nthe human body. Values and energies for which there isn\u2019t much call in the\nworkaday world of bodily labour are siphoned off into a sphere of their own,\nwhich consists of three major sectors: art, sexuality and religion. One of\nthese endangered values is the creative imagination, which was invented in the\nlate 18th century and is nowadays revered among artistic types, though\norganising genocide in Gaza requires quite a lot of it too.\n\nThe distance that opens up between the symbolic and the utilitarian, while\nthreatening to rob culture of its social function, is also the operative\ndistance you need for critique. Culture would expose the crippled, diminished\ncondition of industrial-capitalist humanity through its full and free\nexpression of human powers and capacities, a theme that runs from Schiller and\nRuskin to Morris and Marcuse. Art or culture can issue a powerful rebuke to\nsociety not so much by virtue of what it says but because of the strange,\npointless, intensely libidinal thing that it is. It\u2019s one of the few remaining\nactivities in an increasingly instrumentalised world that exists purely for\nits own sake, and the point of political change is to make this condition\navailable to human beings as well. Where art was, there shall humanity be.\n\nThe harmonious realisation of one\u2019s powers as a delightful end in itself: if\nthis is what the aesthetic comes to be about, it\u2019s also the ethics of Romantic\nhumanism, which includes the ethics of Karl Marx. The aesthetic becomes\nimportant when it isn\u2019t simply about art. Marx\u2019s thought concerns the material\nconditions that would make life for its own sake possible for whole societies,\none such condition being the shortening of the working day. Marxism is about\nleisure, not labour. The only good reason for being a socialist, apart from\nannoying people you don\u2019t like, is that you don\u2019t like to work. For Oscar\nWilde, who was closer in this respect to Marx than to Morris, communism was\nthe condition in which we would lie around all day in various interesting\npostures of jouissance, dressed in loose crimson garments, reciting Homer to\none another and sipping absinthe. And that was just the working day.\n\nThere are problems with this vision, as there are with any ethics. Are all\nyour powers to be realised? What about that obsessive desire to beat up Tony\nBlair? Or should one realise only those impulses that spring from the\nauthentic core of the self? But by what criteria do we judge this? What if my\nself-realisation clashes with yours? And why should all-round expression beat\ndevoting oneself to a single cause, like Alexei Navalny or Emma Raducanu? Do\nhuman capabilities really grow malevolent only by being alienated, lopsided or\nrepressed? And what if we\u2019re half in love with the powers that alienate and\nrepress us, installed as they are inside the human subject rather than purely\nexternal to it?\n\nHegel and Marx have an answer of a kind to the problem of clashing self-\nfulfilments, which goes like this: realise only those capabilities which allow\nothers to do the same. Marx\u2019s name for this reciprocal self-realisation is\n\u2018communism\u2019. As the Communist Manifesto puts it, the free development of each\nis the condition for the free development of all. When the fulfilment of one\nindividual is the ground or condition of the fulfilment of another, and vice\nversa, we call this love. Marxism is about political love. I mean love, of\ncourse, in its real sense \u2013 agape, caritas \u2013 not the sexual, erotic, romantic\nvarieties by which late capitalist society is so mesmerised. We\u2019re speaking of\nthe kind of love that can be deeply disagreeable and isn\u2019t necessarily to do\nwith feeling, that is a social practice rather than a sentiment, and which is\nin danger of getting you killed.\n\nEarly industrial capitalism had another mission for culture to accomplish. A\nnew actor had just appeared on the political scene \u2013 the industrial working\nclass \u2013 and was threatening to be obstreperous. Culture, in the sense of the\nrefined and civilised, was needed to buy off the other half of Matthew\nArnold\u2019s title, anarchy. Unless liberal values were disseminated to the\nmasses, the masses might end up sabotaging liberal culture. Religion had\ntraditionally bred a sense of duty, deference, altruism and spiritual\nedification in the common people. But religious belief was now on the wane, as\nthe industrial middle classes demythologised social existence through their\nsecular activities and, ironically, ended up depleting what had been a\nprecious ideological resource. Culture, then, had to take over from the\nchurches, as artists transubstantiated the profane stuff of everyday life into\neternal truth.\n\nWhat else was happening around the time of Romanticism and the industrial\nrevolution? The revolution in France. One might do worse than claim that this\nwas what thrust culture to the fore in the modern age \u2013 but culture as a\nriposte to the revolution, as an antidote to political turbulence. Politics\ninvolves decision, calculation, practical rationality, and takes place in the\npresent, whereas culture seems to inhabit a different dimension, where customs\nand pieties evolve for the most part spontaneously, unconsciously, with almost\nglacial slowness, and may therefore pose a challenge to the very notion of\nthrowing up barricades.\n\nThe name for this contrast in Britain is Edmund Burke, who came from a nation,\nIreland, where the sovereign power had failed to root itself in the affections\nof the people because it was a colonialist power. In Burke\u2019s view, this\nrooting wasn\u2019t happening in revolutionary France either, since the Jacobins\nand their successors didn\u2019t understand that if the law is to be feared, it is\nalso to be loved. What you need in Burke\u2019s opinion is a law which, though\nmale, will deck itself out in the alluring female garments of culture. Power\nmust beguile and seduce if it isn\u2019t to drive us into Oedipal revolt. The\npotentially terrifying sublimity of the masculine must be tempered by the\nbeauty of the feminine; this aestheticising of power, Burke writes in A\nPhilosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and\nBeautiful, is what the French revolutionaries calamitously failed to achieve.\nYou mustn\u2019t, to be sure, aestheticise away the masculinity of the law. The\nugly bulge of its phallus must be visible from time to time through its\ndiaphanous robes, so that citizens may be suitably cowed and intimidated when\nthey need to be. But the law can\u2019t work by terror alone, which is why it must\nbecome a cross-dresser.\n\nBurke believed that the cultural domain \u2013 the sphere of customs, habits,\nsentiments, prejudices and the like \u2013 was fundamental in a way that the\npolitics to which he devoted a lifetime were not, and he was right to think\nso. There have been some suspect ways of elevating the cultural over the\npolitical, but Burke, who began his literary career as an aesthetician,\nneither despises politics from the Olympian standpoint of high culture, nor\ndissolves politics into cultural affairs. Instead, he recognises that culture\nin the anthropological sense is the place where power has to bed itself down\nif it is to be effective. If the political doesn\u2019t find a home in the\ncultural, its sovereignty won\u2019t take hold. You don\u2019t have to detest the\nJacobins or idealise Marie Antoinette to take the point.\n\nDespite his aversion to Jacobinism, Burke ended up feeling some sympathy for\nthe revolutionary United Irish movement, an extraordinary sentiment for a\nBritish Member of Parliament. The Irish playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan,\nalso an MP, was even more dedicated to the United Irish cause. He was, in\nfact, a secret fellow-traveller \u2013 a fact that, had it been widely known, might\nhave wiped the smiles off the faces of his London audiences. The United\nIrishmen were Enlightenment anti-colonialists, not Romantic nationalists, but\nthe rise of Romantic nationalism in the early 19th century once more brought\nculture to the centre of political life.\n\nNationalism was the most successful revolutionary movement of the modern age,\ntoppling despots and dismantling empires; and culture in both its aesthetic\nand anthropological senses proved vital in this project. With revolutionary\nnationalism, culture in the sense of language, custom, folklore, history,\ntradition, religion, ethnicity and so on becomes something people will kill\nfor. Or die for. Not many people are prepared to kill for Balzac or Bowie, but\nculture in this more specialised sense also plays a key role in nationalist\npolitics. There are jobs for artists once more, as from Yeats and MacDiarmid\nto Sibelius and Senghor they become public figures and political activists. In\nfact, nationalism has been described as the most poetic form of politics. When\nthe British shot some Irish nationalist rebels in 1916, a British army officer\nis said to have remarked: \u2018We have done Ireland a service: we have rid it of\nsome second-rate poets.\u2019\n\nThe nation itself resembles a work of art, being autonomous, unified, self-\nfounding and self-originating. As this language might suggest, both art and\nthe nation rank among the many surrogates for the Almighty that the modern age\nhas come up with. Aesthetic culture mimics religion in its communal rites,\npriesthood of artists, search for transcendence and sense of the numinous. If\nit fails to replace religion, this is, among other things, because culture in\nthe artistic sense involves too few people, while culture in the sense of a\ndistinctive way of life involves too much conflict. No symbolic system in\nhistory has been able to rival religious faith, which forges a bond between\nthe routine behaviour of billions of individuals and ultimate, imperishable\ntruths. It\u2019s the most enduring, deep-rooted, universal form of popular culture\nthat history has ever witnessed, yet you won\u2019t find it on a single cultural\nstudies course from Sydney to San Diego.\n\nFor the liberal humanist heritage, culture mattered because it represented\ncertain fundamental, universal values that might constitute a common ground\nbetween those who were otherwise divided. It was a ground on which we could\nconverge simply by virtue of our shared humanity, and in this sense it was an\nenlightened notion; you didn\u2019t have to be the son of a viscount to take part.\nSince our shared humanity was rather an abstract concept, however, something\nthat brought it back to lived experience was needed, something you could see\nand touch and weigh in your hand: this was known as art or literature. If\nsomeone asked you what you lived by, you gave them not a religious sermon or a\npolitical pamphlet but a volume of Shakespeare. The self-interest of this\nproject, as with almost all appeals to unity, is obvious enough: culture, like\nthe bourgeois state for Marx, represents an abstract community and equality\nwhich compensate for actual antagonisms and inequities. In the presence of the\nessential and universal, we are invited to suspend superficial distinctions of\nclass, gender, ethnicity and the like. Even so, liberal humanism captured a\ntruth, albeit in a self-serving form: what human beings have in common is in\nthe end more important than their differences. It\u2019s just that, politically\nspeaking, the end is a long time coming.\n\nThe vision of culture as common ground was challenged from the late 1960s by a\nseries of developments. Students were entering higher education from\nbackgrounds that made them disinclined to sign up to this consensus. The\nconcept of culture began to lose its innocence. It had already been\ncompromised by its association with racist ideology and imperialist\nanthropology in the 19th century, and contaminated by political strife in the\ncontext of revolutionary nationalism. From the end of the 19th century,\nculture became a highly lucrative industry, as cultural production was\nincreasingly integrated into production in general, and the manufacture of\nmass fantasy became deeply profitable. This, we might note, isn\u2019t yet\npostmodernism. Postmodernism happens not just with the arrival of mass culture\nbut with the aestheticising of social existence, from design and advertising\nto branding, politics as spectacle, tattoos, purple hair and ridiculously\nlarge glasses. Culture, once the antithesis of material production, has now\nbeen folded into production.\n\nModernism, now a century behind us, was the last time culture offered itself\nas a full-blooded critique of society, a critique launched mainly from the\nradical right. If it does so no longer, neither does culture in the sense of a\nspecific form of life. Most such life-forms today are out not to question the\nframework of modern civilisation but to be included within it. Inclusion,\nhowever, isn\u2019t a good in itself, any more than diversity is. One thinks fondly\nof Samuel Goldwyn\u2019s cry: \u2018Include me out!\u2019 All of this is sometimes known as\ncultural politics, and has given rise in our time to the so-called culture\nwars. For Schiller and Arnold, the phrase \u2018culture wars\u2019 would have been an\noxymoron like, say, \u2018business ethics\u2019 (Beckett is said to have remarked that\nhe had a strong weakness for an oxymoron). Culture in their eyes was the\nsolution to strife, not an example of it. Now, culture is no longer a way of\ntranscending the political but the language in which certain key political\ndemands are framed and fought out. From being a spiritual solution, it has\nbecome part of the problem. And we have shifted in the process from culture to\ncultures.\n\nBoth types of culture are currently under threat from different kinds of\nlevelling. Thinking about aesthetic culture is increasingly shaped by the\ncommodity form, which elides all distinctions and equalises all values. In\nsome postmodern circles, this is celebrated as anti-elitist. But distinctions\nof value are a routine part of life, if not between Dryden and Pope then\nbetween Morrissey and Liam Gallagher. In this respect, anti-elitists who like\nto see themselves as close to common life are deluded. At the same time,\ncultures in the sense of distinctive forms of life are levelled by advanced\ncapitalism, as every hairdressing salon and Korean restaurant on the planet\ncomes to look like every other, despite the prattle about difference and\ndiversity. In an era when the culture industry\u2019s power is at its most\nformidable, culture in both of its main senses is being pitched into crisis.\n\nCulture in our time has become nothing less than a full-blooded ideology,\ngenerally known as culturalism. Along with biologism, economism, moralism,\nhistoricism and the like, it is one of the major intellectual reductionisms of\nthe day. On this theory, culture goes all the way down. The nature of humanity\nis culture. Behind this doctrine lurks an aversion to nature (one of culture\u2019s\ntraditional antitheses) as obdurate, inflexible, brutely given and resistant\nto change. At precisely the point where nature is capricious, unpredictable\nand alarmingly fast-moving, culturalism insists on regarding it as inert and\nimmobile.\n\nIt\u2019s not that culture is our nature, but that it is of our nature. It\u2019s both\npossible and necessary because of the kinds of body we have. Necessary,\nbecause there\u2019s a gap in our nature that culture in the sense of physical care\nmust move into quickly if we are to survive as infants. Possible, because our\nbodies, unlike those of snails and spiders, are able to extend themselves\noutward by the power of language or conceptual thought, as well as by the way\nwe are constructed to labour on the world. This prosthesis to our bodies is\nknown as civilisation. The only problem, as Greek tragedy was aware, is that\nwe can extend ourselves too far, lose contact with our sensuous, instinctual\nbeing, overreach ourselves and bring ourselves to nothing. But that\u2019s another\nstory.\n\nShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmailPrintLetters\n\nSend Letters To:\n\nThe Editor London Review of Books, 28 Little Russell Street London, WC1A 2HN\n\nletters@lrb.co.uk\n\nPlease include name, address, and a telephone number.\n\n### Terry Eagleton\n\nTerry Eagleton has written around fifty books, including, most famously,\nLiterary Theory: An Introduction (1983), and around eighty LRB pieces.
