And how did you deduce that seemingly\ntrivial fact, I wonder?\n\nYes, dear reader, determining your location is no longer an arduous task. But\nyou should quickly remember that for the average Joe or Jolie it\u2019s only been\nthat way for a very short while.\n\nIt took the pervasive proliferation of those pocket computers we now all carry\naround to make it so.\n\nBut only by 2016 did global penetration of smartphones cross 50%^1, so you\ncould argue that it\u2019s only been 8 years since the majority of people on this\nplanet have been able to quickly determine their location.\n\nThat\u2019s actually a pretty astounding fact.\n\nYeah, yeah \u2014 I know \u2014 there was a way to quickly determine your location prior\nto the dawn of iPhone. You could use your favorite personal navigation device\n(PND). But that only helped if you were in your car. And global penetration of\nPNDs never got a smidgeon close to smartphones.\n\nThis innate ability to determine your location can take so much stress out of\nyou life. No longer do you have to roll down the window of your car in shame\nand, most of the time at least, no longer do you have to be so stressed about\ngetting lost when you\u2019re on a leisurely country walk.\n\nFor those of you that don\u2019t remember, this is what it used to be like [click\nto play]:\n\nWhat it used to be like asking for your location. Credit: California Map &\nTravel Center\n\nYup, that fear of being maced and tasered has receded somewhat.\n\nHowever, I should also offer the rebuttal to say that easy location\ndetermination has substantially increased our stress levels: it\u2019s made\npossible by all those slimy apps that track your every move. See Map\nHappenings post: \u201cLocation Harvesters, Personal Information Brokers &\nAssholes\u201c.\n\nMoving on.\n\nWhat effect has all this easy location determination had on our world? The\nlist is of course somewhat substantial:\n\n  * Real-time navigation \u2014 by car, by train, by bicycle or on foot\n  * An explosion of tracking apps for vehicles, shipments, rides, deliveries, aircraft, boats \u2014 and let\u2019s not forget tracking birds and animals\n  * A complete revolution for search & rescue\n  * A complete revolution for surveying & construction\n  * Enabling a geo-index of nearly everything (photos anyone?)\n  * The foundation for self-guided machines \u2014 tractors and bulldozers, drones and perhaps one day: cars & trucks\n\nSo, it\u2019s pretty easy to make the case that this phenomenon should win a spot\non the list of \u201c12 Map Happenings That Rocked Our World\u201d. But how did it all\ncome about? And what remains to be done?\n\nIf you\u2019re so inclined I\u2019ll take you though the story of how we got to where we\nare... and a little bit of where we\u2019re headed. It ain\u2019t all down to GPS.\n\n## Determining Your Location: First Things First\n\nA couple of things had to happen:\n\n  * Someone had to invent maps (see \u201c12 Map Happenings That Rocked Our World: Part 1: The First Map\u201c)\n  * Someone had to invent a coordinate system (see\u201d12 Map Happenings That Rocked Our World: Part 2: The Birth of Coordinates\u201c)\n\nThen someone had to invent how to determine your location. Figuring out your\nlatitude (how far north or south you are) was a relative breeze. But by\ncomparison, determining your longitude (how far east or west you are) turned\nout to be a real stinker of a bitch.\n\nThe story of how this problem was solved is an epic tale. TL;DR: the problem\nwas solved by an uneducated carpenter from the north of England in the year\n1759. It was all about clocks.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to delve deeper may I suggest three options:\n\n  * Option 1: if you have 15 minutes: read \u201c12 Map Happenings That Rocked Our World: Part 4: The Epic Quest for Longitude\u201c\n  * Option 2: for the full story: read Dava Sobel\u2018s amazing and best-selling book \u2018Longitude\u2018.\n  * Option 3: if you\u2019re like certain politicians and have difficulty reading: watch the PBS video \u201cLost at Sea\u201d narrated by Richard Dreyfuss. Actually \u2014 even if you can read \u2014 watch the video anyway. It\u2019s such a cool story.\n\n## Precursors to GPS: Acoustic Locators, Gee & LORAN\n\nAcoustic locators came first. They were used in World War I to determine the\nlocation of enemy artillery. The system employed microphones to measure the\ndirection that artillery fire was coming from. With the use of two or more\nmicrophones at different known locations it was possible to determine the\nlocation of artillery using simple trigonometry.\n\nBut these weren\u2019t like your average Shure microphones you use for podcasting.\nTake a look at this one from 1927:\n\nT3 Sound Locator 1927 \u2014 Credit: Wikimedia\n\nOr these Japanese ones from before World War II:\n\nPre-World War II photograph of Japanese Emperor Sh\u014dwa (Hirohito) inspecting\nmilitary acoustic locators mounted on 4-wheel carriages \u2014 Credit: Wikimedia\n\nNext up: Gee.\n\nGee, not to be confused with the clarified butter you might find in an Indian\ndeli, was a radio navigation system invented by the Brits during World War II.\nBy measuring the time delay from radio signals emanating from multiple known\nlocations it was possible to measure position using a method called hyperbolic\nnavigation. Gee\u2019s main purpose was to allow bombers returning from a night\nbombing raid find their landing strips, thereby providing a blind landing\nsystem.\n\nThe methodology was a follows:\n\n> Two transmitting antennas positioned about 10 miles (16 km) apart on either\n> side of a runway. A transmitter midway between the two antennas would send a\n> common signal over transmission lines to the two antennas, which ensured\n> that both antennas would broadcast the signal at the same instant.\n>\n> A receiver in the aircraft would tune in these signals and send them to an\n> [oscilloscope]-type display... If the aircraft were properly lined up with\n> the runway, both signals would be received at the same instant, and thus be\n> drawn at the same point on the display. If the aircraft were located to one\n> side or the other, one of the signals would be received before the other,\n> forming two distinct peaks on the display. By determining which signal was\n> being received first, pilots would know that they were closer to that\n> antenna, and would be able to recapture the proper direction by turning away\n> from it.\n\nThe guy that invented Gee, one Robert Dippy, later went on to help the\nAmericans develop a longer range version, called LORAN \u2014 short for LOng RAnge\nNavigation.\n\nHow did LORAN Work? Well here\u2019s a short 2 minute video courtesy of the\nSmithsonian Institution:\n\nHow LORAN positioning system works \u2014 Credit: Smithsonian Institution\n\nLORAN evolved over the years. It first went live in June 1942 and was declared\noperational in early 1943. The original system begat LORAN-B (which was a\nfailure), but that begat LORAN-C. The US LORAN-C transmitters became\noperational in 1958 and were managed by the US Coast Guard. The original\nLORAN-A systems remained operational until about 1985. LORAN-C was opened to\ncivilian use in 1974 and the US transmitters were finally shut down on 8\nFebruary 2010.\n\nHas it all been replaced by GPS? Well as a matter of fact just like vinyl\nrecords, it is getting a revival. With the potential vulnerability of today\u2019s\nsatellite positioning systems due to GPS interference a new version of LORAN\nis being explored and selectively deployed. Called Enhanced LORAN or \u2018eLORAN\u2019\nit is under consideration by a number of nations. Other countries continue to\noperate LORAN transmitters around the world.\n\n## GPS and its Catalyst\n\nI think pretty much everyone has at least heard the term \u2018GPS\u2019. It of course\nstands for Global Positioning System. And, surprise, surprise, it has its\norigins in the US military. The GPS system is owned by the US government and\nis now operated by the US Space Force.\n\nThe catalyst for developing GPS all started after the USSR launched the first\nman made satellite, Sputnik 1, way back on 4 October 1957. Within hours of its\nlaunch two enterprising chaps, William Guier and George Weiffenbach, who were\nphysicists at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) realized they\ncould determine the satellite\u2019s position by monitoring the radio signals and\nmeasuring the changes in frequency of the signals at known locations on the\nearth due to the doppler effect.\n\nWilliam H. Guier (1926-2011) Credit: Johns Hopkins APLGeorge C. Weiffenbach\n(1921-2003) Credit: Johns Hopkins APL\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the laboratory\u2019s deputy director, Frank McClure, asked\nthem to invert the problem: could they pinpoint a user\u2019s location given a\nknown position of the satellite\u2019s?\n\nAnd why was this so interesting? Well it all comes down to the fact that the\nUS needed more effective ways to blow up the planet and one of them was by\nputting nuclear warheads on submarines. But a missile fired from a submarine\ncouldn\u2019t turn Moscow into a blob of molten glass unless you knew the exact\nposition of the submarine relative to Moscow, preferably within a few hundred\nfeet.\n\nIt turns out we can pinpoint the exact date on which the whole idea for\nsatellite navigation was birthed. Guier and Weiffenbach\u2019s recount the story in\ntheir 1998 paper:\n\n> From here on, we were in for the adventure of our lives. On Monday, 17 March\n> 1958, Frank McClure called us to his office and asked us to close the door.\n> He asked us if anything new suggested that we had exaggerated our claim that\n> we could find an approximate orbit from a single pass of Doppler data. When\n> we replied that nothing had really changed, \u201cMac\u201d asked if we could invert\n> the solution, i.e., determine the station position while assuming the orbit\n> is known.\n\nThis all led to the development of something called the Transit Navigation\nSystem. The first attempt to launch a prototype satellite for Transit was in\nSeptember 1959 and the whole thing became fully operational in 1964. It was\nused primarily by the US Navy to provide accurate location to its fleet of\nPolaris ballistic missile submarines. Transit had a long history and didn\u2019t\ncease its navigation service until 1996 by which time it was made obsolete by\nGPS.\n\nA Transit 2A Satellite during launch preparations \u2014 Credit: Wikimedia\n\nIf you want to dig deeper into the technical methodology behind Transit then\nI\u2019d suggest reading Wikipedia\u2019s page.\n\n## What of GPS?\n\nAlthough groundbreaking the Transit system was deemed too slow and too\nintermittent to keep up with the speed of airplanes. A more accurate and\nreliable system was needed.\n\nFortunately Transit was not alone and in the 1950s and 60s several other\nsystems were developed in parallel. All of them had one goal in mind: getting\nan accurate fix of land or sea based missile launchers before they launched\nnuclear armageddon. These other systems included:\n\n  * MOSAIC (1950-61): \u2018MOSCAIC\u2019 was developed by the Missile Division of Raytheon and stood for \u201cMObile System for Accurate ICBM Control\u201d It was essentially a 3D LORAN.\n  * Project 621B (1963-73): Developed by the Aerospace Corporation (1960-present) this proof of concept project had over 1400 scientists and engineers on staff. Aerospace had been commissioned by the US Air Force to continue work on determining navigation coordinates from satellite signals and in particular meeting an accuracy requirement of 15 meters. Through its fundamental research Project 621B laid many of the foundations for GPS. By the late 1960s Aerospace recommended a design that used 20 satellites placed in geosynchronous orbit.\n  * The Timation Satellites (1964-74): these proved the feasibility of orbiting accurate clocks in space, a necessary requirement for GPS. In essence this was a 20th century version of John Harrison\u2019s H4 chronometer from 1759 (see \u201c12 Map Happenings That Rocked Our World: Part 4: The Epic Quest for Longitude\u201c). The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was the July 1974 launch of the third Timation satellite which was the first to fly an atomic clock.\n\nBy the late 1960s it was clear that a solution to meet all the requirements\nwas going to need a boat load of coordination and a boat load of money. So in\n1968 the US Army, Navy and Air Force combined forces to form NAVSEG\n(Navigation Satellite Executive Group).\n\nAlas, the group had no power to enforce any decisions it made. So in 1969 the\npresident of Aerospace, Ivan Getting, asked president Nixon\u2019s science advisor\nfor help. Rather than advocating for a presidential commission the advice was\nto continue to push the ideas through the military customers. It turned out to\nbe an astute move.\n\nIvan Getting (1912-2003) As the first president of Aerospace, Getting oversaw\nthe development of Project 621B, the precursor to GPS. Credit: Aerospace\nCorporation\n\nThe main customer ended up being a chap called Air Force Colonel Bradford\nParkinson. Put in charge of Project 621B in 1972 he concluded that some\nelements of Project 621B, Timation and Transit were all needed if satellite\nnavigation were to be truly successful.\n\nOn April 17, 1973 the US Department of Defense authorized the creation of the\nGPS Join Program Office with Parkinson as its lead. Over large meeting held\nover the Labor Day weekend in 1973, Parkinson was able to convince his cohorts\nin the military on a design for a system. The decisions about the system made\nat that meeting still prevail today.\n\nBrad Parkinson (b.1935) served as the first program manager of the GPS Joint\nProgram Office, established in 1973. Credit: Aerospace Corporation\n\nApproval was given to start work on 22 December 1973. Initially called\n\u201cNavstar\u201d and later \u201cNavstar/GPS\u201d and then simply \u201cGPS\u201d it was given a\nstarting budget of US$150 million. It eventually cost around US$12 billion to\nbuild and deploy. Today the operational costs of GPS are about US$2 million\nper day.\n\nOver the next 15 years GPS development proceeded apace. Between 1977 and 1979\nmore than 700 different tests were conducted and various test satellites were\nlaunched.\n\nWell after midnight on 19 July 1977, a Rockwell Collins engineer named David\nVan Dusseldorp sat on the rooftop of a company building in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,\nadjusting an antenna every five minutes to receive a signal from the world\u2019s\nfirst Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite, known as NTS-2.\n\nHis GPS receiver was a little more cumbersome than one you might be used to\nusing today:\n\nThe World\u2019s First GPS Receiver manufactured in 1977 by the Collins Government\nAvionics Division of Rockwell International. It weighed more than 270 pounds.\nCredit: The Institute of Navigation\n\nOver the subsequent years more and more satellites were deployed. It took\nuntil 1985 before the production and development stage began. The first \u201cBlock\nII\u201d operational satellite was launched in February 1989:\n\nA GPS Block II Satellite from 1989 \u2014 Credit: Aerospace Corporation\n\nGPS got its first test in 1990 following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait where\nthe system provided invaluable navigational information to all branches of the\nallied forces. Media\u2019s coverage of GPS\u2019s use in the war helped increase\nawareness of the system and helped stimulate commercial interest.\n\nBy the time GPS was fully operational its future success was virtually\nguaranteed.\n\n## Getting to Where We Are Today\n\nInitially the US Department of Defense kept GPS just for themselves. There was\nno access for commercial or consumer use.\n\nBut everything changed on September 1, 1983 when a Korean Airlines 747 jumbo\njet en route from Anchorage to Seoul strayed into Soviet airspace and was shot\ndown by a Sukhoi Su-15 interceptor. All 269 passengers and crew on board\nperished.\n\nAs a result of the incident president Ronald Reagan issued a directive making\nGPS freely available for civilian use.\n\n\u201cThe Tower of Prayer\u201d, a monument to KAL 007 at Cape S\u014dya, Japan. The monument\nis at the closest land point to where the aircraft was downed. Credit:\nWikimedia\n\nBut Reagan\u2019s directive wasn\u2019t sufficient to support consumer navigation as we\nknow it today. The US government had implemented a filter called \u2018Selective\nAvailability\u2019 which degraded the accuracy of the GPS signal for civilian use.\nIt added intentional time varying errors of up to 100 meters (>300 feet) to\nprevent enemies of the US using civilian receivers for weapons guidance. So...\nno sat-nav systems yet suckers!\n\nBut there was a workaround. Because Selective Availability affected every GPS\nreceiver in a given area almost equally, a fixed station with a known position\ncould transmit the error to other receivers in the area. This methodology got\na name: Differential GPS or DGPS.\n\nDGPS became so effective that it essentially overcame the original intent of\nSelective Availability. Eventually common sense prevailed and president\nClinton ordered Selective Availability to be switched off on 1 May 2000.\n\nWhat of nefarious groups using GPS? Well the US military developed a new\nsystem that provided them the capability to deny GPS to hostile forces in a\nspecific area of crisis.\n\nOf course with the advent of GPS other nations around the world were suddenly\nat a serious disadvantage. Friendly nations were beholden to the US. Enemies\nof the US were suddenly in deep, deep yoghurt. So of course other systems\nsprung up:\n\nOf note: you\u2019ll see all these systems listed in the location specs for iPhone.\n\n## Now Don\u2019t Go Thinking GPS is Infallible...\n\nSo when you open up you favorite mapping app you\u2019ll see that little blue dot\nmagically zooming to your current location.\n\nSo you might think all the app is doing is simply taking a GPS reading and\nplotting it on the map.\n\nHa, sucker. It turns out it ain\u2019t that simple.\n\nFirst: it\u2019s common that you aren\u2019t going to get any GPS signal when you have a\nroof over your head.\n\nSecond: if you\u2019re in a city with tall buildings those GPS signals are going to\nbounce of the side of the buildings like a ping pong ball and as a result give\nyou all kinds of false readings.\n\nThird: it helps to stay still. If you\u2019re moving you\u2019re going to get a less\naccurate GPS reading. The faster you move the worse it gets.\n\nThe iPhone specs give you a clue that it takes more than GPS to get that nice\nblue dot:\n\nNotice \u201cWi-Fi\u201d and \u201cCellular\u201d? Those two in particular play a big role in\nkeeping your blue dot roughly correct.\n\nIn lieu of GPS a rough position of your phone can be determined by looking at\nwhich cell phone towers your device is seeing and triangulating a position\nfrom that:\n\nDetermining location from Cell Phone Towers \u2014 Credit: GP Yes\n\nIt works, but only roughly (typically in the region of a few hundred meters).\n\nWi-Fi positioning works using a harvested database of known Wi-Fi router\n(a.k.a. Wi-Fi access point) locations. Similar to the idea behind cell phone\ntower triangulation where you know the location of the cell phone towers, this\nmethodology works in roughly the same way.\n\nBut you need to build up a database of Wi-Fi router locations to make it work.\nGoogle got into a shit load of trouble for harvesting this data secretly back\nin 2008-10. How did Apple get access to similar information? Frankly, I\u2019m not\nsure, but I\u2019m guessing it was harvested from those billions of iOS devices\nthat have a habit of wondering around.\n\nAnother way to keep the location accurate is to use location history. If at\none point you know you\u2019re at a specific location and then your phone\u2019s compass\nand movement sensors see you heading in a particular direction at a particular\nspeed then you can deduce your position at a later point in time. This\nmethodology is called \u2018Dead Reckoning\u2018. It has its limitations, but it stops\nthe blue dot from jumping around too much.\n\nAnother method is to use known information about your current method of\ntraveling. If you\u2019re in navigation mode in your car, then hopefully it\u2019s quite\nlikely that you\u2019re actually driving on a road. So the app can \u2018snap\u2019 the blue\ndot to the road.\n\nAs I\u2019ve already opined there is a need for an accurate location across many,\nmany applications and industries. As such much effort, time and money is being\nspent to improve location accuracy.\n\nOne method is called RTK (Real Time Kinematic) and was invented in the early\n1990s. Basically it\u2019s an evolution of the Differential GPS methodology that\nwas used as a workaround for Selective Availability. It relies on a group of\ngeographically distributed basestations on the ground that are at known\nlocations.\n\nIn the last few years the big boys have introduced yet another way of\ndetermining your location. It\u2019s called \u2018Visual Localization\u2019 and matches what\nyour phone\u2019s camera sees to a known database of 3D buildings. Apple Maps\nintroduced this capability three years ago:\n\nApple Maps launched Visual Localization in 2021 \u2014 Credit: Apple\n\n## Indoor Positioning\n\nGetting your position inside a building is a tough cookie. Several approaches\nhave been tried and one of the most common \u201csolutions\u201d has been to push the\nidea of triangulation using Bluetooth beacons. Little do people know that in\norder to make it work you have to carpet bomb buildings with hundreds (if not\nthousands) of beacons. And then you have to replace the batteries in them\nevery few months. Net/net: it doesn\u2019t scale baby.\n\nAnother approach, used by Apple, is to employ a method called Wi-Fi\nfingerprinting. Apple\u2019s Indoor Positioning system relies on this method by\nrecording the interference patterns of the Wi-Fi radio signals inside a\nbuilding. It\u2019s also not infallible but at least you don\u2019t have to install huge\nmountains of beacons.\n\nThe topic of indoor positioning is worthy a whole separate Map Happenings\npost. There are just so many misconceptions about so called \u201csolutions\u201d.\n\n## Underground Positioning\n\nHave you ever wondered how two tunnel boring machines can start burrowing a\ntunnel many miles apart and miraculously end up meeting in near perfect\nalignment? It\u2019s always fascinated me anyway. Particularly when these machines\nweigh thousands of tonnes and, well, have a tendency to sink.\n\nGPS, Wi-Fi and Cellular methods are obviously not suitable. So how do they do\nit? The answer is using laser guidance. One of the leading companies to\nprovide a solution in this space is a German company called VMT. Here\u2019s a\nshort video from their web site [click to play]:\n\nVMT Navigation System for Tunnelling Machines \u2014 Credit: VMT\n\n## Where Next?\n\nWith recent scary stories like the one about the Russians equipping their\nsatellites with nuclear weapons, nations around the world are naturally\nnervous about the vulnerability of their satellite positioning systems. For\nexample, GPS relies only on 24 active satellites to make it all work. You only\nhave to knock a few out and GPS is pretty much kaput.\n\nAs a result the US Space Force is eyeing smaller, cheaper satellites to\naugment the GPS constellation. This would not only reduce the costs of the\noverall system but it could additionally reduce its vulnerability.\n\nAnd it also sounds like everyone\u2019s BFF, Elon Musk, could be considering a\ncommercial positioning system.\n\nBut I\u2019ll leave you with one more positioning technique that is currently being\nresearched by Hiroyuki Tanaka at the Earthquake Research Institute of The\nUniversity of Tokyo. Here\u2019s his paper in published in the esteemed journal,\nNature, and a subsequent one published in Cell.com.\n\nThe concept is to utilize the relativistic and penetrative nature of cosmic-\nray muons, thereby developing a completely new wireless navigation technique\ncalled wireless muometric navigation system (MuWNS). To quote the paper\u2019s\nauthors:\n\n> This paper shows the results of the world\u2019s first physical demonstration of\n> MuWNS used on the basement floor inside a building to navigate (a person) in\n> an area where global navigation satellite system (GNSS)/ global positioning\n> system (GPS) signals cannot reach. The resultant navigation accuracy was\n> comparable or better than the positioning accuracy attainable with single-\n> point GNSS/GPS positioning in urban areas\n\nYes, dear reader. Muons.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n  1.
