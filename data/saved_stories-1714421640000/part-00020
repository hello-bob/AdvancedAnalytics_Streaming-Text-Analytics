(Raul Arboleda/AFP)\n\nIn a small town high in the Colombian Andes, Clovisnerys Bejarano kneels\nbefore a glass box holding the petrified corpse of her mother, who died 30\nyears ago, but looks as if she might just be asleep.\n\nSaturnina Torres de Bejarano is dressed in the same rose-print dress and green\nwoolen jersey she was interred in, clasping a fake red carnation in her eerily\nwell-preserved hands.\n\n\"She still has her little brown face, round, her braids, her hair,\" Bejarano,\n63, told AFP at her mother's final resting place in a museum displaying her\nbody and those of 13 others from the town of San Bernardo who became\nspontaneously, and mysteriously, mummified after death.\n\n\"If God wanted to preserve her... it must be for a reason,\" said Bejarano, a\nresident of the town some 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Bogota.\n\nClovisnerys Bejarano visits her mother Saturnina Torres, who died in 1993 and\nwas exhumed in 2001, and now rests in the museum of mummies at the Jose\nArquimedes Castro mausoleum at the cemetery in San Bernardo municipality,\nCundinamarca department, Colombia. (Raul Arboleda/AFP)\n\nTorres was interred in a vault in the San Bernardo municipal cemetery in 1993.\n\nExhumed in 2001 \u2013 as is customary to make space for new bodies \u2013 her relatives\nfound her still with hair, nails and much of her tissue unspoilt.\n\nIt came as no major surprise. Dozens of mummified bodies have come out of the\nvaults since the first one in 1963.\n\n\"When all this began, people were a little incredulous about what was\nhappening; they thought these were going to be isolated events,\" said museum\nguide Rocio Vergara.\n\n\"As time went on, it became more and more frequent to find bodies in this\ncondition,\" she told AFP.\n\nSome even still had their eyes, usually quick to decompose.\n\nIn the late 1980s, some 50 mummies were found in the mausoleum every year, but\nthe rate has declined to a handful per year, said Vergara.\n\n## Reward after death?\n\nDespite numberous attempts by experts to explain the phenomenon \u2013 which has\nalso been observed in countries such as Mexico and Italy \u2013 the reason for the\nspontaneous mummification in San Bernardo has never been pinned down, said\nVergara.\n\nSome locals \"believe \"that the process (mummification) is due to the fact that\nthe person was too good, and it is a reward after death,\" said Vergara.\n\n\"There are others who consider that... it is a punishment.\"\n\nAn unidentified mummy is displayed in the Jose Arquimedes Castro mausoleum\nmuseum. (Raul Arboleda/AFP)\n\nMost are convinced it is because of the healthy diet of the residents of\ntemperate San Bernardo, and an active, farming lifestyle.\n\nBut this is not always borne out by the evidence: one of the mummies belongs\nto Jorge Armando Cruz, who spent most of his life in the big city of Bogota,\nwhere he died before being brought back to his birthplace for burial.\n\nThere is no clear pattern to the mummifications: those who are involved are of\nall different ages when they died, and no particular gender or body type\npredominates.\n\nVergara said there is no particular sector of the cemetery that yields more\nmummies than others.\n\n## Like an oven\n\nMany believe the answer must lie in the burial vaults.\n\nThe first mummies were found in San Bernardo only after the cemetery, which\nhas no underground graves, was inaugurated.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, the town had two burial grounds with not a single known\ncase of mummification, said Vergara.\n\nThe climate in the area is humid, which would ordinarily aid decomposition,\nnot hinder it, she added.\n\nAnthropologist Daniela Betancourt of the National University of Colombia said\nthe phenomenon could be due to the cemetery's placement on a steep mountain\nslope.\n\n\"The wind is constantly blowing as it is hot. It is possible to assume that\nthe vaults work like an oven... they dehydrate you.\"\n\nThis hypothesis still needs to be tested, Betancourt told AFP.\n\n\"There has been a lack (of) studies about what is happening and what specific\nconditions are the ones that cause people to mummify,\" she said.\n\nRelatives of the mummified corpses must authorize their display in the museum.\n\nMost opt to have the remains cremated instead, but the Bejarano family did not\nwish that fate for Torres.\n\n\"God wanted to leave her to us, and here we have her... Seeing her like that,\nhow could one let her be cremated,\" asked Bejarano, who regularly brings\nTorres's great-grandchildren to visit her tomb.\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse\n\nTrending News\n\nCommon Blood Pressure Drug Increases Lifespan And Slows Aging in Animals\nHealth2 days ago\n\nCannabis Use Linked to Epigenetic Changes, Study Reveals Health3 days ago\n\nIt's Official: Scientists Finally Confirmed What's Inside The Moon Space6 days\nago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
