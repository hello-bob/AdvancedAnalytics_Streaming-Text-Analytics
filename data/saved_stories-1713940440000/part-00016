These problems were designed to prevent Jews and other\n> undesirables from getting a passing grade. Among problems that were used by\n> the department to blackball unwanted candidate students, these problems are\n> distinguished by having a simple solution that is difficult to find. Using\n> problems with a simple solution protected the administration from extra\n> complaints and appeals. This collection therefore has mathematical as well\n> as historical value.\n\nComments:| 21 pages, 14 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| History and Overview (math.HO)  \nCite as:| arXiv:1110.1556 [math.HO]  \n(or arXiv:1110.1556v2 [math.HO] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1110.1556arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \nJournal reference:| published as \"KIller Problems\" in The American\nMatheamtical Monthly Vol. 119, No. 10 (2012), pp815-82  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Alexey Radul [view email] [v1] Fri, 7 Oct 2011 14:55:23 UTC (27 KB) [v2]\nSat, 15 Oct 2011 17:09:11 UTC (27 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Jewish Problems, by Tanya Khovanova and Alexey\nRadul\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\nmath.HO\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 1110\n\nChange to browse by:\n\nmath\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\n### 2 blog links\n\n(what is this?)\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
