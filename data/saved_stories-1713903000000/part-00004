We find that\n> Claude has remarkable \\textit{resource efficiency} -- the degree to which\n> the quality of the translation model depends on a language pair's resource\n> level. Finally, we show that advancements in LLM translation can be\n> compressed into traditional neural machine translation (NMT) models. Using\n> Claude to generate synthetic data, we demonstrate that knowledge\n> distillation advances the state-of-the-art in Yoruba-English translation,\n> meeting or surpassing strong baselines like NLLB-54B and Google Translate.\n\nComments:| 17 pages, 15 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.13813 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.13813v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Maxim Enis [view email] [v1] Mon, 22 Apr 2024 01:22:23 UTC (11,241 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled From LLM to NMT: Advancing Low-Resource Machine\nTranslation with Claude, by Maxim Enis and Mark Hopkins\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
