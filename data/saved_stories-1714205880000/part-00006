The ruling is a loss for six trade groups that\nrepresent ISPs, although it isn't clear right now whether the law will be\nenforced.\n\nNew York's Affordable Broadband Act (ABA) was blocked in June 2021 by a US\nDistrict Court judge who ruled that the state law is rate regulation and\npreempted by federal law. Today, the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit\nreversed the ruling and vacated the permanent injunction that barred\nenforcement of the state law.\n\nFor consumers who qualify for means-tested government benefits, the state law\nrequires ISPs to offer \"broadband at no more than $15 per month for service of\n25Mbps, or $20 per month for high-speed service of 200Mbps,\" the ruling noted.\nThe law allows for price increases every few years and makes exemptions\navailable to ISPs with fewer than 20,000 customers.\n\n\"First, the ABA is not field-preempted by the Communications Act of 1934 (as\namended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996), because the Act does not\nestablish a framework of rate regulation that is sufficiently comprehensive to\nimply that Congress intended to exclude the states from entering the field,\" a\npanel of appeals court judges stated in a 2-1 opinion.\n\nTrade groups claimed the state law is preempted by former Federal\nCommunications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai's repeal of net neutrality rules.\nPai's repeal placed ISPs under the more forgiving Title I regulatory framework\ninstead of the common-carrier framework in Title II of the Communications Act.\n\n2nd Circuit judges did not find this argument convincing:\n\n> Second, the ABA is not conflict-preempted by the Federal Communications\n> Commission's 2018 order classifying broadband as an information service.\n> That order stripped the agency of its authority to regulate the rates\n> charged for broadband Internet, and a federal agency cannot exclude states\n> from regulating in an area where the agency itself lacks regulatory\n> authority. Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and\n> VACATE the permanent injunction.\n\n##\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Be careful what you lobby for\n\nThe judges' reasoning is similar to what a different appeals court said in\n2019 when it rejected Pai's attempt to preempt all state net neutrality laws.\nIn that case, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\nsaid that \"in any area where the Commission lacks the authority to regulate,\nit equally lacks the power to preempt state law.\" In a related case, ISPs were\nunable to block a California net neutrality law.\n\nSeveral of the trade groups that sued New York \"vociferously lobbied the FCC\nto classify broadband Internet as a Title I service in order to prevent the\nFCC from having the authority to regulate them,\" today's 2nd Circuit ruling\nsaid. \"At that time, Supreme Court precedent was already clear that when a\nfederal agency lacks the power to regulate, it also lacks the power to\npreempt. The Plaintiffs now ask us to save them from the foreseeable legal\nconsequences of their own strategic decisions. We cannot.\"\n\nJudges noted that there are several options for ISPs to try to avoid\nregulation:\n\n> If they believe a requirement to provide Internet to low-income families at\n> a reduced price is unfair or misguided, they have several pathways available\n> to them. They could take it up with the New York State Legislature. They\n> could ask Congress to change the scope of the FCC's Title I authority under\n> the Communications Act. They could ask the FCC to revisit its classification\n> decision, as it has done several times before But they cannot ask this Court\n> to distort well-established principles of administrative law and federalism\n> to strike down a state law they do not like.\n\nCoincidentally, the 2nd Circuit issued its opinion one day after current FCC\nleadership reclassified broadband again in order to restore net neutrality\nrules. ISPs might now have a better case for preempting the New York law. The\nFCC itself won't necessarily try to preempt New York's law, but the agency's\nnet neutrality order does specifically reject rate regulation at the federal\nlevel.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n23\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
