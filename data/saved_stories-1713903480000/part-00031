The shift isn\u2019t limited to\noffice work\u2014in New York, restaurants are pioneering use of remote cashiers\nbased in the Philippines.\n\nThe change doesn\u2019t introduce a significant hurdle for sales tax calculation\npurposes; New York\u2019s tax policies will still control any transaction taking\nplace in the Empire State. The challenges come when the state department of\nrevenue or other tax authority audits the business that performs remote\ncheckouts and offshore payment processing.\n\nWithout physical records at the business location, local tax authorities will\nface a daunting task. Efforts to demand records from offshore payment\nprocessors or remote checkout businesses may prove fruitless depending where\nthey are sited.\n\nIf tax authorities can\u2019t see transaction logs, sales tax suppression will be\neasy to accomplish and difficult to prove. To counteract these challenges,\nindividual customers could be enticed to obtain and scan their receipts,\ncreating a shadow record of transactions that can provide a robust foundation\nfor audits.\n\nScanning receipts could automatically enter consumers into a lottery\u2014either by\nproviding tickets for an existing state-run lottery or creating a separate\nprize fund via the revenue generated from enhanced compliance.\n\nAs far-fetched as this may seem, such programs have been created and\nadministered by countries around the world, and increased compliance followed\nsuit.\n\n## Remote Suppression\n\nIf offsite, or even offshore, payment processing isn\u2019t going to be eliminated,\nthen the next best step to compel business owners to maintain a local\ntransaction record is to facilitate a shadow record for consumers that will\nalso reflect in tax agency records. This approach creates a source of\ntransaction data outside the control of the business owner.\n\nImagine a simple scenario involving a restaurant in New York City. A customer\napproaches the counter to pay for a meal with a credit or debit card and\nencounters the functional equivalent of a Zoom call, with a cashier located a\nworld away.\n\nIf the customer pays by credit card, and the processing of that transaction is\nhandled by the same company offering the remote cashier services, there may be\nno record of the transaction in the restaurant itself. The cashier will\nprocess the transaction in conjunction with a payment-processing company, and\nthe customer will be given a receipt\u2014digital or otherwise.\n\nAt that moment, three individuals or entities can speak to the details of the\ntransaction that has just been conducted: the customer, cashier, and payment\nprocessor. The cashier and payment processor may forget the transaction\nhappened.\n\nThis may be one of the service\u2019s selling points, essentially sales suppression\nas a service, because it allows the restaurant owner to retain the sales tax\ncharged to the customer\u2014up to 8.875% in New York City\u2014and reduce their income\ntax liability by the amount of the transaction.\n\nIf the transaction record doesn\u2019t exist, the restaurant owner can retain the\nfull value of the transaction, without needing to report that value as income,\nand any sales tax collected on behalf of the customer. When the average\nrestaurant profit margin is as little as 7%, pocketing 8.875% on every cash\ntransaction can mean the difference between a profitable enterprise and a\nfoundering one.\n\nOnly the customer can be made to stand separate from the business owner and\nused as a source of true transaction data, which is where a lottery system\nwould come in.\n\nEncouraging customers to tell the tax authority what they know about a given\ntransaction by scanning their receipt into a tax authority database would\nsignificantly reduce the ability of the restaurant to suppress sales.\n\n## Tax Lottery\n\nThe crux of the sales suppression issue revolves around tax authorities not\nhaving sufficient access to unmanipulated data\u2014data reflecting actual totals\nfor sales made and sales taxes collected, without any manipulation by the\nbusiness owner.\n\nA fraudster business knows how much they made in sales and how much tax they\ncollected, but they\u2019re motivated to lie. Customers know how much they paid but\nare difficult to track down and are unlikely to retain receipts for de minimis\npurchases even if you could find them.\n\nIncentivizing customers to scan and submit their receipts to the tax authority\nshortly after purchase through entry in a lottery for a cash prize is a\nscalable solution.\n\nA number of states in Europe have already done this to combat value-added tax\nfraud. Results have been mixed\u2014some African states adopting such lotteries\nhave seen minimal revenue increases, but Brazil and China have had success.\n\nThe extent that sales suppression was occurring before the introduction of a\nnew policy can determine the possibility of success. If the sales tax gap in a\ngiven state chiefly comprises sophisticated evaders, a lottery system may not\nmake a significant difference in terms of tax revenue. Similarly, if there is\na general anti-tax culture, fraudster businesses may succeed in offering\ndiscounts for goods and services purchased without a receipt\u2014bringing the\ncustomer unwittingly in on the fraud.\n\nBut these international experiences don\u2019t reflect what will be possible if\nremote cashiers become the norm. Putting all the transaction data for a\nbusiness outside the reach of state departments of revenue is a recipe for\nrampant fraud\u2014it will be too easy for fraudsters to resist exploiting.\n\nA lottery system essentially would deputize customers to help tax authorities\ncreate a near-complete record of the transactions conducted by a given\nbusiness.\n\nTo the extent that not every receipt is scanned, the business wouldn\u2019t be able\nto know at the point of the transaction which customers will and won\u2019t use\ntheir receipt to enter the lottery. They\u2019d be forced to gamble themselves,\nbetting that any transaction they choose to delete and suppress isn\u2019t one for\nwhich the customer has submitted a receipt.\n\nBalancing penalties for failure to issue receipts and payouts for the lottery\nwould be key for efficiency\u2014the point at which adding another dollar to the\nlottery or another dollar to the penalty won\u2019t enable another dollar to be\ncontributed in tax revenue.\n\nAt best, a customer doesn\u2019t care if a business charges them sales tax on their\ntransaction and then pockets the tax and suppresses the sale. The effect on\nthe individual\u2019s wallet is the same, and they have nothing to gain from\nencouraging or discouraging it.\n\nAppealing to customers\u2019 monetary interests through a tax lottery can be a\npowerful breakwater against what may otherwise be a cresting wave of fraud.\n\nAndrew Leahey is a tax and technology attorney, principal at Hunter Creek\nConsulting, and adjunct professor at Drexel Kline School of Law.
