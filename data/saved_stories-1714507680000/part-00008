But why? Let me explain.\n\nA wristwatch provides more than just telling the time. Any additional\ninformation is called a \"complication\". For example, showing the date can be\ndone in various ways, and there are numerous \"date\" complications. But some\nwatches also show the day of the week, the month, the year, and many other\nthings.\n\nDigital watches have it easy, but things get complicated with mechanical\nwatches. I've discovered that showing something as simple as a date is tricky\nfor mechanical watches. Mechanical watches that can show a date correctly are\npretty rare, and the ones that do are very expensive (starting at ~$10k).\n\nBut why? Let me explain.\n\n### No date\n\nThis is the simplest form of a watch. Some prefer mechanical watches,\nespecially if they are not self-winding (automatic) because, in the old days,\nyou had to be very careful when adjusting a watch that had a date complication\nwhen it was midnight. No date means just adjusting your time. But the topic of\nthis blog calendars, so let's move on.\n\nRolex Explorer 36mm. A simple tool watch with no date complications. (Ref:\n124270)\n\n### Date\n\nA watch that many use and many have seen in their life. In the simplest form,\nthere is a small cutout at the 3 or 6 o'clock position. A date watch always\ngoes up to 31 days. It doesn't matter in which month you are, and because only\nseven months have 31 days, every other month requires you to update your date\ncomplication (these are February, April, June, September, and November). These\nwatches are sometimes called \"simple calendars\".\n\nKing Seiko, in 39mm, comes with a classic date complication.Nonos Metro\nneomatik 41 update. The date complication is circular around the bezel. The\ntwo neon orange markers frame the current date.\n\n### Day-date\n\nIn addition to the date, a complication shows the day of the week (such as\nMonday, Tuesday, etc..). Some show them as a full name (i.e., Rolex Day-date),\nsome only show the first three characters (i.e., Mon, Tue, Wed), and some\nwatches have complications that show these in a subdial or retrograde\ncomplication. It depends on the watch style. As with the Date watches, you\nmust configure the date and day for all 5 months of the year.\n\nRolex Day-Date 40mm with an iconic day complication on the 12 o'clock indices.\nRef: 228236Seiko 5 has a day complication that only shows the first three\ncharacters. Made in 1998 (Ref: 840267)\n\n### Triple Calendar\n\nSo far, we only know the day of the week and the date. Watches that also show\nthe Month are called triple calendars. The month complication is also\ndemonstrated in different ways. It could be a cutoff display, like the date\nthat shows the year in Arabic numbers, or as three characters shortcuts (Jan,\nFeb, Mar, etc...). Or it could reuse the indices of the watch (because there\nare 12 indices, one per month).\n\n1952 \"Citizen Triple Calendar\" (source:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jdm_horologist/). The date is shown around the bezel\nwith an additional date hand. The Month and Day are shown below the 12 o'clock\nindices.\n\nHaving a month doesn't mean the watch knows how many dates a month has. You\nstill have to manually adjust the date on months that are not 31 days.\n\n### Complete/Full Calendar\n\nShowing the moon's phase, whether full or new (or in between), makes the watch\na Complete or Full Calendar. These watches are very aesthetically pleasing.\nThe moon phase adds another complexity to the dial, making it busier for some\ndials.\n\nIWC Portofino Complete Calendar. Here, you can see the moonphase complication\nat the 12 o'clock (Ref: IW359002)\n\nLike the Triple calendar, it does not consider the variable lengths of the\nmonths and needs to be corrected five times a year at the end of those months\nshorter than 31 days.\n\n### Annual calendar\n\nThe annual calendar was a tremendous innovation when Patek Phillipe released\nit to the public with their 5053 ref watch. Unlike a complete calendar, it\nautomatically adjusts the calendar complication for the months of 30 or 31\ndays, leaving the owner to manually adjust the date once a year at the end of\nFebruary. It was less complex than other calendar types, such as Perpetual\nCalendars.\n\nThe first commercial Annual Calendar for sale: Patek Phillipe 5053JIWC\nPORTUGIESER ANNUAL CALENDAR (Ref: IW503501), no longer produced.\n\n### Quadrennial / Four-year / Semi-Perpetual calendar\n\nThis type of calendar is an improvement over the Annual calendar. With\nquadrennial calendars, as the name implies, you don't need to adjust the\ncalendars for four years until a leap year occurs. When February has 29th\ndays, these watches need to be readjusted, and the date complication needs to\nbe moved a day forward.\n\nSo, the main difference between quadrennial and annual calendars is that\nquadrennial calendars take into account the shorter days of February, which\nthe annual calendar ignores.\n\nAn example of this type of watch is the Breitling Navitimer 1461. Because it\nonly needs adjustment on February 29th, it takes 1461 days between each\nadjustment, hence the name.\n\nBreitling Navitimer 1461 Calendar Steel Mens Watch A38022\n\n### Perpetual calendar\n\nPerpetual calendars are the most famous and well-known and also one of the\nmost expensive calendar watches out there. Unlike annual or Quadrennial\nwatches, these watches also consider the leap year until 2100. If you buy one\nnow, you can use it for 76 years without having to readjust your watch.\n\nPatel Philippe 5270J Perpetual Calendar.\n\nThe complexity of these watches also means once the mechanical watch is not\nworn for quite a time, it'll stop working (nit: hence, most watchmakers also\ngive you a winder, an electrical motor that spins the watch when you're not\nwearing). If the watch stops, readjusting the Perpetual calendar is not as\neasy as adjusting a simple date calendar. Certain watches make it simple, but\nsome watches need several small holes to be pushed on a specific order.\nBecause of these complexities, perpetual calendars also show a power-reserve\ncomplication, which shows how much the watch will run if it is not worn.\n\nA. Lange & S\u00f6hne has a short video showing how various levers and hands\noperate to support Perpetual Calendars in watches.\n\nTo configure it correctly, perpetual calendars always have an additional \"leap\nyear\" complication. A simple dial that shows four numbers, one of them red,\nindicating the leap year. Hence, the user can configure the watch correctly by\nconfiguring the leap year.\n\nLANGE 1 PERPETUAL CALENDAR, also known in German as the \"Ewiger Kalender\" (Ref\n345.033 E).\n\nBut in daily life, knowing the leap year is not that important; hence, some\nwatchmakers put them on the back of the watch to make room on the dial.\nSecond, it's important to note that not all perpetual calendars show the year.\nSome don't have any year complications, but they can still compute the leap\nyear, and the watch user doesn't have to configure the watch every four years.\n\nH. Moser & Cie's ENDEAVOUR PERPETUAL CALENDAR (REF. 1800-0204). There is no\nyear complication. The month is shown via a tiny hand that is depicted between\nthe hour and minute hand. On the back of the watch, you can see a gear that\nshows the years 1,2,3, and the leap year via the black indicator.\n\n#### Secular Perpetual Calendar\n\nThe pinnacle of calendars in mechanical watches is the Secular Perpetual\nCalendar, a true masterpiece, and there are limited watches in this section.\nFirst of all, Perpetual means forever. However, as seen in the previous\nsection, they only last until 2100. Why?\n\nBecause the year 2100 is not a leap year until 2400. The rules for leap years\nin the Gregorian calendar (the most widely used calendar) are:\n\n  * Every four years is a leap year.\n  * No leap years on 100-year cycles (i.e. 2100, 2200, etc..).\n  * Leap year on 400-year cycles (i.e. 2400, 2800).\n\nSecular Perpetual Calendars are calendars that take into consideration this\nrule. They are the most superior calendar type you can find in a watch.\n\nThere are few examples of this watch type, but watch manufacturers create them\nto showcase their craftsmanship and show the world what they can achieve.\nRecently, IWC released a Secular Perpetual Calendar called the \"Eternal\nCalendar.\"\n\nIWC Eternal Calendar (Ref: IW505701) is IWC's first secular perpetual\ncalendar. It automatically takes into account the Gregorian calendar's complex\nleap year exceptions by skipping three leap years over 400 years.\n\n### Verdict\n\nAs you have seen, displaying the date is not easy, and most of the mechanical\nwatches you see daily are quite limited in how they show you the date, month,\nor year. Watches capable of being Perpetual Calendars are expensive because\nthey require high engineering, special materials, and excellence. The most\nimportant fact is, that mechanical watches need to store some state over the\nyears, and certain gears should be wound and triggered only when the time\ncomes. That's not an easy feat.\n\nNot many watchmakers can do it. This was why Patek Phillipe released an Annual\nCalendar; adjusting it once a year was a good compromise. Many watchmakers\neven don't provide a perpetual calendar at all. Most watches are simple date\nwatches, and that's enough for many people.\n\nThanks for reading.
