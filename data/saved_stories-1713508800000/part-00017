Rotation is driven by a flagellar motor, which is a supercomplex\ncontaining multiple rings. Architectural uncertainty regarding the cytoplasmic\nC-ring, or \u2018switch\u2019, limits our understanding of how the motor transmits\ntorque and direction to the flagellar rod. Here we report cryogenic electron\nmicroscopy structures for Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium inner\nmembrane MS-ring and C-ring in a counterclockwise pose (4.0 \u00c5) and isolated\nC-ring in a clockwise pose alone (4.6 \u00c5) and bound to a regulator (5.9 \u00c5).\nConformational differences between rotational poses include a 180\u00b0 shift in\nFliF/FliG domains that rotates the outward-facing MotA/B binding site to\ninward facing. The regulator has specificity for the clockwise pose by\nbridging elements unique to this conformation. We used these structures to\npropose how the switch reverses rotation and transmits torque to the\nflagellum, which advances the understanding of bacterial chemotaxis and\nbidirectional motor rotation.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Structural basis of directional switching by the bacterial flagellum\n\nArticle 08 March 2024\n\nSteven Johnson, Justin C.

Jun Liu\n\n## Main\n\nThe biased random walk of chemotaxis is essential for bacterial survival and\npathogenesis^1,2,3. This process relies on bidirectional flagellar\nrotation^1,2,3 (Fig. 1a) by a motor composed of four rings. The C-ring (C =\ncytoplasmic), which contains multiple copies of protein subunits called FliG,\nFliM and FliN, switches the rotation of the flagellum between counterclockwise\n(CCW) and clockwise (CW). For this reason, it is termed the \u2018switch\u2019. CCW\nrotation allows bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica to\nswim straight. Conversely, CW rotation induces tumbling and reorientation with\na new trajectory^1,2,3. The switch is also the site of torque generation for\nthe flagellum, through an electrostatic interaction with a stator called\nMotA/B^4. The switch also connects to the MS-ring (MS =\nmembrane\u2013supramembrane), which transmits both the direction and the speed of\nrotation to the flagellar rod. Finally, the P- (P = peptidoglycan) and L-rings\n(L = lipid), which are the bushings of the motor, surround this rod to support\nand buffer the rotation. High-resolution structures of the rod, export\napparatus, MS-ring, P-ring, L-ring, flagellar hook and flagellar filament have\nprovided insight into the function of these flagellar\ncomponents^5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. However, past structures for the C-ring are\nat low resolution (for example, refs. ^14,15).\n\nFig. 1: The flagellar motor and structure of the switch.\n\na, Schematic diagram of the flagellar motor showing the L-ring, P-ring, MS-\nring and C-ring, as well as the flagellar rod, hook and filament. The switch\nis housed within the C-ring and is composed of the FliG, FliM and FliN\nsubunits. OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane. b, Cropped view of a\nrepresentative cryoEM micrograph for wild-type MS- and C-rings (1 of 34,381\nmicrographs) showing the quality of particles used in structure determination.\nMost particles contain both the MS- and C-rings, although a small number of\nisolated MS-rings are present. En face views (three are highlighted with black\ncircles) and side views (three are highlighted with white circles) are\nobserved. Tilted views are also observed and give the appearance of a smaller\ndiameter in some cases. Scale bar, 200 \u00c5. The uncropped micrograph is\navailable in the Source data file. Raw micrographs for all structures have\nbeen deposited with EMPIAR^76 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/) and accession\ncodes EMPIAR-11597, EMPIAR-11891 and EMPIAR-11892. c, Surface representation\nof the C-ring density maps in the CCW pose superimposed on the final model.\nFliF subunits are shown in blue, FliG subunits are shown in red, FliM subunits\nare shown in yellow and FliN subunits are shown in shades of pink and purple.\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\nResponse regulators affect flagellar rotation and speed. The best studied is\nthe excitatory response regulator CheY (for chemotaxis)^16,17, which biases\nthe flagellum toward CW rotation. Others include the fumarate-sensing\nquinol:fumarate reductase^18,19,20, the spermidine-sensing SpeE^21 and the\ncyclic-di-GMP-sensing YcgR^22,23. The CW pose^18 may also support switch\nassembly, as well as assembly and disassembly of the entire flagellum^24,25.\n\nKey unknowns in chemotaxis are how the motor drives both CCW and CW rotation,\nhow response regulators affect rotation and how torque transfers from the\nstator to the flagellum. To help inform on these controversies, we determined\nthe structures of the S. enterica serovar typhimurium combined MS- and C-rings\nin the CCW pose, the C-ring in the CW pose and the CW pose bound to a response\nregulator. This complements concomitant work from the Lea group showing the\nisolated C-ring in the CCW pose, the CW pose and the MotA/B interaction with\nthe C-terminus of FliG^26.\n\n## Results\n\n### Structure of the wild-type C-ring\n\nWe formed particles from coexpressed FliF, FliG, a region of FliL, FliM, FliN\nand FliO^27. We purified the resultant 6 MDa supercomplex containing both the\nMS-ring and the C-ring, collected cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) data\nand determined the structure (Fig. 1b,c, Extended Data Fig. 1a,b,\nSupplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Video 1). Standard cryoEM workflows\ncould not improve the resolution beyond ~8 \u00c5. We, therefore, used particle\nsubtraction at the level of the micrograph (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This\ntechnique improves alignment by obscuring unwanted features in the primary\ndataset^28, with common applications including removing nanodiscs or detergent\nmicelles from membrane protein particles. We removed the MS-ring and\ndetermined the structure of the C-ring, where the predominant species was a\n34-mer (~50% of the particles). Local resolutions ranged from 2.9 to 6.6 \u00c5,\nand the average resolution was 4.0 \u00c5 (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary\nVideo 1). Other symmetries included a 33-mer (4.5 \u00c5 resolution), 35-mer (4.5 \u00c5\nresolution) and 36-mer (6.7 \u00c5 resolution).\n\nWe interpreted the 34-mer maps by docking AlphaFold (v.2.0)^29 models of\nisolated S. enterica domains and manually connecting them (Fig. 2a\u2013f, Extended\nData Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Video 2). This identified that the switch\nsubunits loosely organize into layers. Beginning at the side of the C-ring\nthat faces the MS-ring and the membrane, the layers contain\nFliF_514\u2013560/FliG_1\u2013331 in two layers at the top, FliM_52_\u2013237 (FliM_mid) in\nthe middle, and FliM_257\u2013330 (FliM_C)/FliN_45/59/63\u2013137 in a 3:1 ratio at the\nbottom (Fig. 2e).\n\nFig. 2: The CCW pose of the switch.\n\nIn the global views, FliF is blue, FliG is red, FliM is yellow and FliN is\npink and purple. In the insets of a\u2013e, each of the subunits is coloured from\nthe N-terminus (blue) to C-terminus (red) to highlight the fold. a, FliF_C\nwraps around FliG_D1. b, A FliG protomer folds into five domains: FliG_D1\n(FliG_1\u201367), FliG_D2 (FliG_73\u201399), FliG_D3 (FliG_107\u2013186), FliG_D4\n(FliG_196\u2013233) and FliG_D5 (FliG_243\u2013331). c, The FliM subunit, highlighting\nFliM_L1 (FliM_31\u201350), FliM_mid (FliM_51\u2013230), FliM_L2 (FliM_231\u2013256) and\nFliM_C (FliM_257\u2013330). d, A 180\u00b0 rotated view of panel (c). e, Three FliN_C\nsubunits are similar but non-equivalent. To highlight the fold, only one\nprotomer (FliN_3) is coloured from the N-terminus (blue) to C-terminus (red).\nThe remaining two (FliN_1 and FliN_2) are coloured pink and purple. f, A side\nview of a single FliFGMN unit. An ~30 \u00c5 cleft between FliF_C\u2013FliG_D1/D2 and\nFliG_D5 is highlighted. g, A single FliFGMN unit participates in three staves.\nh, Density for FliG_D5 appears to be separated, with the domain having little\ncontact with adjacent subunits. i, Interactions between the PAA motif of\nFliG_D3 and the adjacent FliG_L1 linker. j,k, Formation of a curved spiral by\nthe FliM_C:3FliN_C heterotetramer. j, A schematic that compares the open ring\nof FliM_C:3FliN_C in the cryoEM structure to the closed ring of the crystal\nstructure of T. maritima FliN_C (1YAB^42). This comparison highlights that a\npure FliN_C superstructure would favour stacked discs in a linear array.\nFliM_C breaks the symmetry, which is necessary to form the helix along the\nbottom of the C-ring. k, The FliM_C:3FliN_C forms a spiral that curves along\nthe base of the C-ring to form a closed circle. A single arc is shown.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe density (Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013o) was consistent with AlphaFold models and\nX-ray crystal structures of isolated domains of\nFliG^14,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38, FliM^21,32,37,39,40,41 and FliN^39,42 from\nhomologues (Extended Data Fig. 2c). However, crystal structures of multi-\ndomain FliG^31,35,38 required substantial interdomain adjustment to match the\ncryoEM structure (Extended Data Fig. 4a\u2013f). In addition, past work supports\nFliG as a three-domain protein^38; however, FliG contains five domains when it\nis assembled into the switch (Fig. 2b). Therefore, the FliG domains are\nredefined here as FliG_D1\u2013FliG_D5 (FliG_1\u201367, FliG_73\u201399, FliG_107\u2013186,\nFliG_196\u2013233 and FliG_243\u2013331; Supplementary Table 2). Interdomain linkers are\ntermed FliG_L1\u2013FliG_L5.\n\nMutagenesis is commonly used to validate cryoEM structures. Given the\nextensive number of published mutants, designing new mutations was\nunnecessary. From this, we identified many assembly-deficient\nmutations^30,32,43 that affect residues that form strong interactions at\nsubunit interfaces (Extended Data Fig. 4g), which explains their impact on\nswitch assembly.\n\n### The CCW pose of the switch\n\nPurified wild-type C-rings exclusively rotate CCW under physiological\nconditions^44, assigning this as the CCW pose. Furthermore, this structure\nconcurs with the CCW pose shown by tomography^45,46 (Extended Data Fig. 4h).\nIn this structure (Fig. 2a\u2013f), individual FliG subunits form a V shape. When\nassembled into a 34-mer, the upper regions form inner and outer rings\nseparated by a 30 \u00c5 cleft. The inner ring contains FliF_C, FliG_D1 and\nFliG_D2, and the outer ring contains FliG_D5. At a more detailed level, FliF_C\nforms a curved helix that extends radially from the MS-ring on the membrane\nside (Fig. 2a). This FliF_C interacts intimately with FliG_D1 (Fig. 2b) and\nhas strong density for all C-terminal residues of FliF_C (Extended Data Fig.\n3a). As FliG_D1 extends into FliG_D2, it forms an armadillo motif, which is an\n\u03b1-helical hairpin that permits rotations. This armadillo motif of FliG_D2\ncompletes the fold of the next FliG_D1 to form an intercalated structure (Fig.\n2g). By contrast, FliG_D5 of the outer ring distinctly separates from\nneighbouring subunits (Fig. 2h).\n\nBelow these upper rings, armadillo motifs of FliG_D3 and FliG_D4 (Fig. 2b,f)\nintercalate around the ring via domain swaps, as proposed by ref. ^38. FliG_D4\nalso forms the base of the cavity between the upper rings, and FliG_D3 binds\nto FliM (Fig. 2f). The FliG_L1\u2013FliG_L4 linkers between these domains have\nstrong density suggesting rigidity (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c,e,f). FliG_L3 is\nnoteworthy because it both stabilizes the position of FliG_D2 and makes\nintimate interactions with a Pro-Ala-Ala (PAA) sequence motif (FliG_169\u2013171)\nin an adjacent FliG_D3 protomer (Fig. 2b,i). Deletion of this PAA motif\nresults in flagellar motors that predominantly rotate CW^35,47.\n\nFliM_mid (Fig. 2c,d,f) and its interface with FliG_D3 resemble crystal\nstructures^21,32,37,39 except for a new helix containing FliM_231\u2013\u2013256\n(FliM_L2). This helix domain swaps with the adjacent subunit and extends to\nthe bottom of the structure. Here FliM_C and FliN_C adopt an organization\ncalled a SpoA fold^39,42 and form a heterotetrameric building block that\nresembles a split lock washer (Fig. 2j,k). These FliM_C:3FliN_C building\nblocks pack into a spiral with FliM_C at the lower edge of the C-ring (Fig.\n2c,d,j,k) that is consistent with past biochemical and structural\nstudies^38,48.\n\n### The CW pose of the switch\n\nA distinct pose of the switch supports CW rotation^45,46 and switch\nassembly^18,19. To inform on this pose, we determined the 4.6 \u00c5 resolution\nstructure of switch particles containing the extreme CW-biased FliG_\u0394PAA\nmutation^47. Symmetry expansion followed by local refinement gave superior\nresults to particle subtraction (Extended Data Fig. 5a). To build the model\n(Fig. 3a\u2013f), we docked modules from the assembled CCW pose as rigid bodies\ninto the CW maps. Linkers between domains were then built manually.\n\nFig. 3: The CW pose of the switch.\n\na\u2013e, Individual folds of the C-ring subunits in the CW pose: FliF (a), FliG\n(b), FliM (c), a 180\u00b0 rotated view of FliM (d), FliN (e). The relative\norientation and the colouring are the same as for Fig. 2. f, A side view of\nthe CW pose showing an expanded cleft between FliG_D1/D2 and FliG_D5. g,\nComparison of the CCW pose (transparent) with the CW pose (solid) of a single\nC-ring subunit. h, A 90\u00b0 rotation of panel (g) highlights the magnitude of the\nconformational change. i, Comparison of a top-down view of the CCW and CW\nposes shows the reversed orientation of the FliF_C helix, which changes the\nconnection to the MS-ring. The increased size of the cleft in the upper ring\nof FliG is also apparent. j, Colouring a single subunit in the context of the\nC-ring highlights the increased domain swaps in FliG of the CCW pose compared\nto the CW pose. In the CCW pose, FliF_C\u2013FliG_D1 is in the inner ring above\nFliM and crosses staves three times. In the CW pose, FliF_C\u2013FliG_D1 is in the\ninner ring behind FliG_D5 and crosses staves twice. k, A side view of a single\nunit aligned to the FliM_C:3FliN_C spiral highlights the 25\u00b0 rotation of\nFliM_mid in the CW pose.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe CW pose contains significant domain rearrangement, particularly in FliG.\nHere FliF_C\u2013FliG_D1 and FliG_D2 of the inner ring and FliG_D5 of the outer\nring each rotate by ~180\u00b0 (Fig. 3a,b,g\u2013i). As a part of this, FliG_D2 changes\nthe subunit that it binds, altering the domain swaps (Fig. 3j). These changes\nhave multiple impacts. They reverse the orientation FliG_D5, which binds the\nMotA/B stator, and they also reverse FliG_D1, which binds to the MS-ring.\nFinally, these rotations increase the size of the cleft between the inner and\nouter rings from 30 \u00c5 to 40 \u00c5 (Figs. 2f and 3f). FliG_D3\u2013FliM_mid undergoes\nsmaller positional changes, rotating approximately 25\u00b0 as a unit with a slight\nadjustment in the binding interface (Fig. 3c,d,k).\n\nThe altered domain swaps in the CW pose (Fig. 3j) may have biological\nimplications. First, the reduced number of swaps could facilitate C-ring\nassembly^18,19. The altered domain swaps also suggest how the C-ring supports\ndirectional cooperativity^49,50, where a change from CCW to CW in one subunit\nmay trigger a similar change in an adjacent subunit. The likely steric clash\nin a ring of mixed poses would induce one subunit to change the conformation\nof the adjacent subunit.\n\nComparison of the CCW and CW poses (Fig. 3g\u2013k) suggests a mechanism for\nswitching in the switch_\u0394PAA mutant (Fig. 4a). Loss of the PAA motif shortens\nthe FliG_L3 linker and adjusts the position between FliG_D3 and FliG_D4. It\nalso moves FliG_D2 to eliminate a domain swap. Finally, the PAA motif in\nFliG_D3 normally interacts with the first helix of FliM_mid, which is held\nunder tension in the CCW pose^51. Removing this interaction allows FliM to\nrotate. To support this proposal, we mapped directionally biasing mutants^52\nonto the CCW structure (Fig. 4b). CCW-biasing mutations group to a surface\nsuggested to be a CheY binding site^51,53,54. These likely\u2013 disrupt CheY\nbinding to reduce CW transitions. Conversely, CW-biasing mutations dominate\nthe ~100 \u00c5 pathway that connects the N-terminus of FliM_mid to FliG_D5 (Fig.\n4a,b). These mutations may prevent allosteric conformational changes of FliM\nand FliG.\n\nFig. 4: Allostery in the switch.\n\na, Allosteric pathway from the FliM N-terminus to the torque helix in FliG_D5.\nDifferent steps of signal transmission are coloured from blue to red and\nnumbered. The transfer of information starts at (1) the N-terminus of FliM\nnear the FliM_L1 linker at the FliM-FliN interface. The information passes\nthrough the first helix of (2) FliM_mid to FliG_D3 near the (3) PAA motif,\nwhich supports (4) FliG_D4. A rotation of (5) the C-terminal FliG_D5 changes\nthe orientation of the torque helix. Note that allosteric signal transmission\nmay involve both the pathway that is shown and a concerted signal transmission\nin adjacent subunits of the ring. A single subunit of the C-ring with a\nneighbouring FliG (FliG_N \u2212 1) is shown. b, Locations of directionally biased\nmutations in the switch. Red balls highlight CCW-biasing mutations, with the\nmajority of these located in the proposed binding site for CheY. Their\nmutation could affect CheY binding. Yellow balls mark locations of CW-biasing\nmutations, which cluster along the pathway in a. Their mutation could release\nthe CCW pose.\n\nFull size image\n\n### The CW pose bound to a regulator\n\nIn one of our CW switch_\u0394PAA datasets, we observed density for a binding\npartner within the cleft in the FliG subunit (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig.\n5b). This identifies one way that a regulatory protein might interact with the\nCW switch. The bound protein moved both FliF_C/FliG_D1/D2 of the inner ring\nand FliG_D5 of the outer ring, as a unit, by ~10 \u00c5 toward the centre of the\nring. This decreased the diameter from 460 \u00c5 in the CW pose (470 \u00c5 in the CCW\npose) to 440 \u00c5 in the CW pose with the binding partner.\n\nFig. 5: A regulator bound to the CW pose of the switch.\n\na, On the left, twelve repeats of the protein-bound CW pose of the switch are\nshown in grey, with three repeats of the density in the cleft shown in green.\nFor comparison, the right shows the CW pose of the switch not bound to a\npartner protein. The cleft is still visible but lacks density within it. b,\nCross-section of a single subunit with the density for the regulator in green.\nFor comparison, the CW pose with an empty cleft is shown on the right.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe size of the density is consistent with a globular domain of ~120 amino\nacids. Because it bridges FliF_C/FliG_D1 and FliG_D5, which differ between CCW\nand CW, this protein should be specific for the CW pose (Fig. 5a,b).\nAdditional density above the cleft resembles an intertwined helical coiled\ncoil and forms a ring. The position of this ring differs from the position of\nthose that appear on the outer perimeter of FliG during assembly and\ndisassembly^55.\n\nThe local resolution for this density was 9 \u00c5, making it difficult to identify\nthe species from the maps. We used manual docking to evaluate several\npossibilities: YcgR, CheY-FliM_1\u201316, quinol:fumarate reductase and FliO (5Y6H\nref. ^56, 4IGA ref. ^57, 1KF6 ref. ^58,\nhttps://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A5C2LXN8)^29. YcgR and CheY could be\ndocked, while quinol:fumarate reductase and FliO fit the density poorly.\nYcgR^22,23 is unlikely because it physiologically stabilizes the CCW pose.\nWhile CheY is relevant to the CW pose^16,17, past work identifies that CheY\nbinds to the switch at the N-terminus of FliM (FliM_1\u201316)^53, in the central\ndomain of FliM (FliM_51\u2013228)^54 with FliM_R94 suggested as key^51 and at a\nhydrophobic patch of a FliN homodimer^59 containing FliN_V113, FliN_V114 and\nFliN_A115. Moreover, past tomography identifies that CheY correlates with the\nappearance of density on the exterior of the FliM subunit^45,46. Thus, we\ncannot identify the bound species.\n\n### Torque transmission\n\nTorque transmits between the MotA/B binding site on the FliG_D5 torque\nhelix^4,26,60 and FliF. To trace the path of torque transmission, we evaluated\nthe two ends of this pathway. In wild-type C-rings, torque enters the C-ring\nat the outer FliG_D5 (Fig. 6b). In the CW pose, FliG_D5 rotates and presents\nthe MotA/B binding site to the inside of the ring, with torque likely\ntransmitted along the same path, albeit in the opposite direction. Tracing the\npath of torque transmission to the rod requires understanding how the switch\nconnects to the MS-ring^1,2,3. To evaluate this, we determined the structure\nof the MS-ring in the CCW switch (Fig. 6a) by obscuring the C-ring using\nparticle subtraction (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The resultant 3.4 \u00c5 resolution\nstructure contained 33-mer MS-rings (FliF_50\u2013428) in 58% of 34-mer C-rings\n(Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). The remaining MS-rings could not be classified into\na stoichiometry. MS-rings that could not be classified correlated with grids\nthat had thinner ice, suggesting that the MS-ring preferentially partitions at\nthe air\u2013water interface. However, we cannot exclude the presence of other\nstoichiometries that we could not classify.\n\nFig. 6: Torque transmission during flagellar rotation.\n\na, A model for the flagellar motor from Gram-negative bacteria was built from\nour structure and that of the S. enterica flagellar basal body (7CGO ref.\n^12). The L-ring (light purple) contains FlgH subunits. The P-ring (dark\npurple) contains the FlgI subunits. In the centre of the LP-ring is a rod\n(grey). The distal region of the rod (FlgG) connects to the hook and\nflagellum, while the proximal region of the rod (FliE, FlgB, FlgC and FlgF)\nconnects the LP-ring to the MS-ring. The MS-ring (blue) localizes within the\ninter-membrane space and contains FliF subunits. Finally, the C-ring (orange),\ncontains FliF C-termini as well as FliG, FliM, and FliN of the switch. b,\nPathway of torque transmission through the flagellar motor. The C-ring\ntransmits torque from the MotA/B stator to the MS-ring and flagellar rod. The\nfigure shows a map of the torque transmission pathway highlighted with black\narrowheads and coloured from blue (stator) to red (MS-ring). Torque transfer\nbegins with the interaction between the MotA/B stator and the torque helix of\nFliG_D5 of the C-ring. Interactions across the FliG subunit allow the torque\nto be transmitted to FliG_D1, where there is a direct interaction with FliF.\nThis is expected to turn the MS-ring and the flagellar rod within.\n\nFull size image\n\nWhile the fold of each FliF subunit is generally consistent with previous\nreports^5,9,10,11, there are two notable differences. The first is the 33-mer\nstoichiometry. Some past structures show variable stoichiometry^5,10. Others\nsuggest that the native stoichiometry is a 34-mer^9. A second difference in\nthe MS-ring structure compared to past work was additionally observed regions\nof N-terminal ring-building motif 1 (RMB1, FliF_50\u2013106; Extended Data Fig.\n6a). Past MS-ring structures identified either 9 or 11 RBM1s^5,9,10,11, but\ncoordinates were not assigned. The present map contained density for 33 RBM1\ndomains in two positions and allowed coordinates to be assigned to 11\n(Extended Data Fig. 6b).\n\nTo complete the connections, we modelled FliF_1\u201349 and FliF_429\u2013514 with\nAlphaFold^29. The prediction showed high confidence that these were helices\n(Fig. 6a). Because the particles have a symmetry mismatch between the MS- and\nC-rings, there could be multiple ways to model the MSC-ring species. A\nFliF_33:FliG_34:FliM_34:FliN_102 assignment is consistent with the symmetric\nappearance of the C-ring before averaging. By contrast, loss of a FliG\nsubunit, that is, FliF_33:FliG_33:FliM_34:FliN_102, does not match our data\nand suggests that the FliF:FliG ratio need not be 1:1. We propose that these\nMSC-rings contain 203 subunits: 33 FliF, 34 FliG subunits, 34 FliM subunits\nand 102 non-equivalent FliN subunits.\n\nA global view of the resultant model shows that the MS- and C-rings stack with\na tilt angle of 4\u00b0 (Fig. 6a). This non-coaxial stacking is similar to what was\nobserved between MS-ring and LP-ring in previous structures^6,12 (Fig. 6a).\nWhen considering the intact motor (Fig. 6a), it is tempting to align the axis\nof the C-ring with the LP-ring, which results in a tilted MS-ring between\nthese features. This tilt could explain why the MS-ring looks thicker on edge\nin low-resolution MSC-ring structures^14,15 than in structures of the isolated\nMS-ring^5,9,10,11. A tilt could be expected in any motor with a symmetry\nmismatch between the MS- and C-rings.\n\nWith this tilt, axial rotation of the C-ring and rod during flagellar rotation\nwould make the MS-ring of the motor appear to wobble when viewed edge on\n(Supplementary Video 3). Symmetry mismatches have other characterized\nbiological effects. They promote a low-energy state and allow efficient\nrotation^61 at high speed, which requires that there be no significant energy\nminima. Symmetry mismatch between the 33-mer MS-ring and 34-mer C-ring\nobserved in these particles (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 1) could help\nsupport this. This wobble could prevent an energetic minimum during flagellar\nrotation^10 or influence the inherently asymmetric export apparatus^62,63 at\nthe interior of the C-ring. Because FliF_C is tightly tethered to FliG_D1, the\nability of the MS- and C-rings to be flexibly attached may be important for\nboth torque transmission and the shift between the CCW to CW poses.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this Article, we report cryoEM structures of three states of the flagellar\nswitch, answering questions about torque transmission, directional control and\nbinding of a response regulator. Torque input (Fig. 6b) involves the MotA/B\nstator^1,2,3 (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), which uses the transmembrane\nelectrochemical gradient to induce rotation and transmits this to the torque\nhelix on FliG_D5 (refs. ^4,60,64,65,66). MotA/B and the C-ring then act like\ninterlaced cogwheels to drive flagellar rotation^64,65 (Extended Data Fig.\n7c). Supporting this model, the interface between MotA subunits^64,65 is\nperfectly positioned to grasp the FliG_D5 torque helix (Extended Data Fig.\n7a,b). Torque transmits through FliG to FliF of the MS-ring, which connects to\nthe flagellar rod.\n\nFliG has a conformational difference between CCW and CW poses (Figs. 2 and 3)\nthat moves the binding site for MotA/B from facing outward in the CCW pose to\nfacing inward in the CW pose (Fig. 3), which changes the direction of rotation\nof the C-ring (Supplementary Video 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c). This model is\nsupported by tomography of the stator bound to the C-ring in the CCW and CW\nposes^46 and is consistent with past proposals for powering rotation in\nopposite directions^64,65. The concomitant ~180\u00b0 FliF_C/FliG_D1 rotation\noptimizes the connection between the C-ring and the MS-ring in these two\ndirections (Fig. 3i).\n\nThe CCW and CW poses of the switch also help explain cooperativity^49,50,\nwhich induces the subunits of the C-ring to preferentially adopt the same\npose. Three conformational differences between the CCW and CW would result in\nsteric clash unless the next subunit adjusted. These are the FliF_C\u2013FliG_D1\nrotation, the change in domain swapping of FliG_D2 and the ~25\u00b0 rotation of\nFliM_mid (Fig. 3g,h,k). Biologically, bound signalling proteins influence both\nthe direction and rate of rotation. One of our CW data sets showed density\nwithin an ~40 \u00c5 cleft between FliG domains, identifying one binding site for\nregulatory proteins (Fig. 5). This density is consistent with an ~120 amino\nacid protein that locks FliF_C\u2013FliG_D1/D2 and FliG_D5 into the CW pose. The\n~30 \u00c5 cleft in the CCW pose may also be large enough to bind to a regulatory\nprotein (Fig. 2f).\n\nThe architectures of FliM and FliN also inform on the mechanism of\nconformational transitions between the CCW and CW poses^45,46 (Figs. 2\u20134). It\nhas previously been unclear how the motor could be conformationally dynamic\nenough to function and yet stable enough to survive these large structural\ntransitions. Domain swapping with subunit intercalation is a structural\nfeature known to both enhance stability and allow superstructures to\ndynamically adopt multiple stoichiometries. This has been best studied during\nprotein aggregation that causes disease^67. The substantial domain exchange of\nFliM and FliN within the switch may help to accommodate large molecular\nreorganization during the transitions between the CCW and CW poses (Figs.\n2\u20134).\n\nNotably, there is currently no consensus over the stoichiometry for the MS-\nring^5,9,10,12. Some cryoEM studies showed a range of stoichiometries^5,10.\nOther studies only identify a 34-mer^9. The variable stoichiometry was\ninterpreted as the MS-ring adapting to load. This largely leveraged parallels\nto the C-ring\u2019s stoichiometry^68 and the number of bound stators^69, which can\nchange in response to the strength of the attractant or load.\n\nStudies showing only a 34-mer suggest that other stoichiometries arise from\nartefacts due to C-terminal proteolysis of FliF or incorrect templating during\nplasmid expression^9. We can exclude C-terminal proteolysis affecting\nstoichiometry in our structure because we observe density for the full\nC-terminus of FliF bound to FliG (Figs. 2a and 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a).\nIn terms of templating, this 33-mer MS-ring and the previously published\nstrict 34-mer^9 were similarly expressed in E. coli. This suggests that the E.\ncoli templating machinery can be recruited to assemble the Salmonella MS-ring\n(~95% identical) and is also unlikely to underlie the stoichiometric\ndifference. Nevertheless, we did not test conditions proposed to affect\nstoichiometry, which would be required to distinguish between an adaptive and\na strict stoichiometry. For example, we did not coexpress the S. enterica\ntemplating machinery with the pKLR3 plasmid, and we did not grow cells under\nconditions with different attractants or different loads. Taken together, the\norigins of symmetry differences in MS-ring structures remain unclear at this\ntime.\n\nIn aggregate, this work reports the high-resolution structure of the most\ncritical piece of the flagellar motor in three states. The structure suggests\nmechanisms for torque transmission and directional switching during chemotaxis\nin Salmonella and related bacteria. This structure also allows a large body of\ndata on bacterial chemotaxis to be understood in the context of an\narchitecture.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Constructs\n\nPlasmid pKLR3 (ref. ^27) containing the S. enterica serovar typhimurium fliL,\nfliF, fliG, fliM, fliN and fliO genes was a generous gift to M.E. from S.\nKhan.\n\n### Protein purification\n\nThe S. enterica serovar typhimurium FliFGMN subunits were expressed in E. coli\nBL21-Gold cells in LB medium supplemented with 0.034 mg ml^\u22121 chloramphenicol.\nAt an OD_600 of 0.6, expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl\n\u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Following induction, cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C\nfor 18 h with shaking, then collected by centrifugation at 6,750 \u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C.\n\nFollowing growth, bacterial cells were resuspended in 100 mM Tris\u2013HCl with pH\n8.0, 8 mM EDTA and one protease inhibitor tablet for every 50 ml of buffer.\nCells were lysed with 1% w/v Triton X100 detergent and 10 mg lysozyme. The\ncell suspension was stirred at 4 \u00b0C for 4 h before adding MgCl_2 to a final\nconcentration of 10 mM. For every 50 ml of buffer, 100 U of DNase and 5 mg of\nRNase were also added. The lysed cells were stirred for 1 h before\ncentrifuging at 18,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min to remove cell debris. Membranes were\nseparated from this supernatant by centrifugation at 60,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h. The\ncell membranes were resuspended in 100 mM HEPES with pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1%\nv/v Triton X100 for 30 min on ice. Partial purification was achieved via\ndifferential membrane extraction. First, the Triton X100 concentration was\nincreased to 10%, and the suspension was mixed gently for 1 h. These partially\nextracted membranes were centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min, and the\nsupernatant was centrifuged at 60,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h to collect the membranes.\nThis pellet was resuspended in 100 mM HEPES with pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% v/v\nTriton X100 and 0.05% lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (Anatrace, NG310), then\nmixed gently for 1 h. The suspension was then spun at 14,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min,\nand the supernatant was filtered through a 0.4 \u03bcm syringe filter. The filtered\nsample contained MSC-ring particles and was used for preparing cryoEM grids.\n\n### Cryo-EM sample preparation and imaging\n\nA 300 mesh R1.2/1.3 Au Quantifoil grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences) was glow\ndischarged for 15 s. Purified MSC-rings (2 \u03bcl of 23 mg ml^\u22121) were added to\neach grid at 4 \u00b0C and 100% humidity. After 15 s of incubation, blotting was\nperformed for 4 s. Grids were plunged into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark\nIV system (Thermo Fisher). Grids were screened on 200 keV Glacios microscope\n(Thermo Fisher). Data were collected from the best grids using a 300 keV Titan\nKrios G4 microscope with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector (Thermo Fisher).\n\nFor wild-type MSC-ring, 34,831 movies were motion-corrected using patch\nmotion-based correction in cryoSPARC (v.4.2.1)^70. The contrast transfer\nfunction (CTF) was estimated using Patch CTF Estimation in cryoSPARC^70. Using\ntemplate picker, we picked 3,906 particles from 3,427 micrographs (10% of the\ndataset). An ab initio model was created from this and was used as a template\nto pick particles from the complete dataset.\n\nFor the CW MSC-ring, 35,552 movies were first motion-corrected using patch\nmotion-based correction in cryoSPARC^70. The CTF was estimated using Patch CTF\nEstimation in cryoSPARC. Using template picker, we picked 3,906 particles from\n3,500 micrographs (10% of the dataset). An ab initio model was created from\nthis and was used as a template to pick particles from the complete dataset.\n\nFor the CW MSC-ring with bound partner protein, 26,130 movies were processed\nusing the same steps as for CW C-ring. Using cryoSPARC template picker, we\npicked 4,546 particles from 3,700 micrographs (14% of the dataset). Using the\nCW C-ring as an input model, the C-ring was created and was used as a template\nto pick particles from the complete dataset.\n\n### Structure determination\n\nFor the wild-type MSC-rings, 295,031 particles were picked, and 50,000 of them\nwere used to build ab initio models without enforcing symmetry. These initial\n3D class averages separated into four classes. In the next step, all 295,031\nparticles were used to perform heterogeneous refinement on the four ab initio\nclasses. Upon completion, only one class contained MSC-rings (21% of\nparticles; Extended Data Fig. 1a). In addition, one class was isolated MS-\nrings, and two classes were junk classes. Inspection of the density showed the\nC-ring at low resolution, ~15 \u00c5, and showed clear staves. However, the\nassociated density for the MS-ring was uninterpretable.\n\nBecause the lower quality density for the MS-ring may have resulted from a\nsymmetry mismatch between the MS- and C-rings, potentially combined with\nalignment that was biased toward the larger C-ring, a particle subtraction\ntechnique was used to improve the resolution. First, MS-rings were identified\nfrom the 3D model. This consensus map was used to build a mask around the MS-\nring. The MS-ring was then subtracted at the level of the micrograph (Extended\nData Fig. 1a). The MS-ring-subtracted particles were then used to determine\nhigh-resolution structures for the C-ring.\n\nInitial heterogeneous refinement resulted in five classes with different\nsymmetries. One class contained 33-fold symmetry (13,081 particles), two\nclasses contained 34-fold symmetry (15,301 and 13,081 particles), one class\ncontained 35-fold symmetry (11,346 particles) and one class contained 36-fold\nsymmetry (6,041 particles). Non-uniform refinement^3 was performed on each of\nthe above classes (33-, 34-, 35- and 36-fold symmetry) with the final\nresolution of the C33 map at 4.5 \u00c5 resolution, the C34 map at 4.1 \u00c5\nresolution, the C35 map at 4.5 \u00c5 resolution and the C36 map at 6.7 \u00c5\nresolution. To improve the resolution of the 34-fold symmetric map even\nfurther, particles from all the classes were passed through heterogeneous\nrefinement with C34 symmetry imposed. Following this procedure, the best\nclasses were refined using homogeneous and non-uniform refinement. The final\nresolution was 4.0 \u00c5.\n\nFor the CW MSC-rings, 43,741 particles were picked. Using the ab initio model,\nthese particles were classified into three classes. Upon completion, only one\nclass contained MSC-rings (16% of particles; Extended Data Fig. 5a). In\naddition, one class was isolated MS-rings, and one class was junk class.\nInspection of the density showed the C-ring at low resolution, ~20 \u00c5, and\nshowed clear staves. However, the associated density for the MS-ring was\nuninterpretable. From the CCW C-ring previous knowledge, we applied C34\nsymmetry to refine the C-ring. Due to the low number of particles, we were\nunable to improve the resolution of the map using particle subtraction.\nTherefore, we expanded the particles by applying C34 symmetry and locally\nrefined a small section by masking three staves of the C-ring. This improved\nthe resolution to 4.6 \u00c5. We used RELION (v.4.0.1) image handler to form a\n34-mer C-ring from the refined sectional map^71.\n\nFor the CW MSC-rings with bound partner protein, 59,404 particles were picked.\nUsing the CW MSC-ring model, these particles were classified into three\nclasses. Upon completion, only one class contained MSC-rings (34% of\nparticles; Extended Data Fig. 5b). In addition, one class was isolated MS-\nrings, and one class was a junk class. Inspection of the density showed the\nC-ring at low resolution, ~25 \u00c5, and showed clear staves. However, the\nassociated density for the MS-ring was uninterpretable. We then applied C34\nsymmetry to refine the C-ring. As we had more particles in this dataset, we\nboth applied particle subtraction to improve the map quality and also applied\nlocal refinement on C34 symmetry-expanded particles from three masked staves.\nThis improved the resolution to 5.9 \u00c5. We used RELION image handler to form a\n34-mer C-ring from the refined sectional map^71.\n\nTo evaluate the MS-ring associated with CCW C-rings, the particle subtraction\nprotocol was reversed. The 34-mer class has the most particles and the highest\nresolution. Thus, 34-mer particles were next extracted from the micrographs,\nand the C-ring was then subtracted (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Classes were then\ndeveloped for the MS-ring. This procedure identified that for the 34-mer\nC-ring, the MS-ring classified exclusively as a 33-mer (Extended Data Fig. 1b)\nand was associated with a final resolution of 3.4 \u00c5.\n\n### Model building and refinement\n\nTo assist in model assignment, alphaFold^29 was used to develop homology\nmodels of appropriate subunits and domains. For FliG domains, FliG_D3:FliM_mid\nheterodimers, FliN_C homodimers and FliM_C:FliN_C heterodimers, packing\ninteractions from crystal structures of various unassembled domains from\nthermophiles were used to create a library of multi-domain models with\npotential domain exchanges. This library was manually developed using COOT\n(v.0.9.8.8)^72.\n\nThe model of FliG_D3:FliM_mid (developed from PDB entry 4FQ0 (ref. ^32))was\nfirst docked into the corresponding density in COOT, then optimized in\nChimeraX (v.1.7)^73. This was followed by docking the models for FliG_D4 and\nFliG_D5 into the density at the exterior of the ring (developed from PDB\nentries 3HJL (ref. ^38) and 1LKV (ref. ^30)). Next, a model containing the\nFliF_C, FliG_N and the domain-swapped armadillo repeat (developed from PDB\nentry 5WUJ (ref. ^36)) was docked into the density on the interior of the ring\nin COOT^72 and optimized in ChimeraX^73. Linkers between these domains were\nbuilt manually in COOT^72. The base of the ring used a combination of docked\nFliN_C homodimers and FliM_C:FliN_C heterodimers (developed from PDB entry\n4YXB (ref. ^39)), with the linking helix between FliM_mid and FliM_C built\nmanually in COOT^72.\n\nDocking of each of these structures in COOT^72 followed by optimization in\nChimeraX^73 gave an unambiguous match with the density. Refinement was\nperformed by standard methods that alternated rounds of manual model\nimprovement in COOT^72 with refinement in PHENIX (v.1.20.1-4487)^74. Figures\nwere made using ChimeraX^72, and videos were made using Blender v.3.5\n(https://www.blender.org/) and Molecular Nodes (v.2.8)^75.\n\n### Manuscript editing using artificial intelligence\n\nManuscript length and accessibility were both edited using the formalizer\nsubroutine in goblin.tools.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll raw, processed, and interpreted data that support the findings of this\nstudy are available in public repositories.

Following 2D classification, only particles\ncontaining both MS- and C-rings were retained. Symmetry could not be\nunambiguously classified from the combined MS- and C-rings. To identify the\nstructure of the C-ring, MS-rings were removed through particle subtraction\nfrom the micrograph. This was saved as a separate dataset so that the original\nmicrographs were retained. Classification of the separate C-ring revealed\nrings with 33- to 36-fold symmetry dominated by a prevalent of a 34-mer (~50%\nof particles). The 34-mer C-ring was subjected to C34 heterogeneous refinement\nand had a final overall resolution of 4.0 \u00c5 after this procedure. (b) To\nrefine the associated MS-ring, the particles containing 34-mer C-rings were\nre-identified in the original micrographs and the C-ring was subtracted from\nthese 34-mer particles. The subsequent heterogeneous refinement process used\nfive parallel calculations to individually impose multiple C33-C36 symmetries.\nAmong these, only the C33 MS-ring refinement (58% of particles) yielded\ndistinct secondary structure features. The remaining particles (42%) did not\nclassify as any observable symmetry. To ensure that we had not missed a subset\nof MS-rings with other stoichiometries, we removed the C33 particles from the\ncalculation and separately imposed C34, C35, and C36 symmetry. This did not\nresult in a class with interpretable density. To identify why 42% of the MS-\nrings that were bound to C-rings could not be classified, we re-evaluated the\nraw micrographs. We identified that the MS-rings that could not be classified\nwere associated with micrographs that had thinner ice, suggesting a\npreferential orientation with the MS-ring at the air-water interface. We\ncannot, however, exclude that other symmetries exist at lower abundance in our\nsamples or in the biological system. Notably, C33 symmetrization revealed the\nRBM3 and \u03b2-collar, but masked the details of RBM1 and RBM2. To achieve high-\nresolution insights into all domains, we subsequently conducted refinement\nusing C11 symmetrization.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 2 Assignment of the CCW pose of the C-ring.\n\n(a) Surface representation of the C-ring colored by local resolution. The\nhighest resolution (2.9 \u00c5) is in blue, and the lowest resolution (6.6 \u00c5) is in\nred. (b) AlphaFold models of individual domains were used as starting points\nin building the structure. The structures are colored by confidence from blue\n(very high confidence) to orange (very low confidence). (c) Comparison of the\nfinal model from the cryoEM structure to isolated domains from crystal\nstructures of homologs. Insets show different regions of the structure.\nFliG_D4-D5 is superposed with the equivalent domains from Thermotoga maritima\n(rcsb.org/structure/1lkv^30). FliG_D3 is shown superposed with the equivalent\ndomain from Helicobacter pylori (rcsb.org/structure/3usw^31). FliG_D1-D2 and\nFliF_C are shown superposed with the equivalent domains from T. maritima\n(rcsb.org/structure/5tdy^34). The FliM_mid domain and FliG_D3 are superposed\nwith the equivalent domains from H. pylori (rcsb.org/structure/4fq0^32).\nFliM_C and FliN are superposed with the FliN dimer from T. maritima\n(rcsb.org/structure/1yab^42) and the fused FliM_C-FliN_C dimer from Salmonella\nenterica (rcsb.org/structure/4yxb^39).\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 3 Density for subunits of the C-ring in the CCW pose.\n\nDensity for: (a) FliF_C; (b)\u2013(g) regions of the FliG subunit; (h)\u2013(l) regions\nof the FliM subunit (m)\u2013(o) each of the three FliN_C domains. The resolution\nof FliM_mid is < 3 \u00c5. In panel (i), the side chains are shown for FliM_51-75\nto highlight the map quality.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 4 Validation of the assembled C-ring.\n\n(a)\u2013(f) Individual domains of the FliG subunit concur with the domains of this\nstructure. However, the global appearance of FliG differs due to the different\ninterdomain angles. (g) Locations of flagellum-deficient mutations^30,31,40,80\nin the context of two adjacent protomers of the C-ring. All flagellum-\ndeficient mutations are highlighted with a sphere. Flagellum deficient\nmutations that map to the interior of folded domains and are likely to prevent\nflagellar assembly through misfolding of an individual subunit is colored\nblack. Flagellum deficient mutants that interact with adjacent protomers in\nthe ring are the same color as the associated chain. Insets highlight key\nselect intersubunit interactions (yellow dash) that may be disrupted with\nthese mutations. (h) comparison between the CCW pose and a CCW tomogram from\nVibrio algintolyticus^45.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 5 Workflow for cryoEM structures of CW C-rings.\n\n(a) Workflow for the unbound CW C-ring at 4.6 \u00c5 resolution. Representative 3D\nreconstructions used symmetry expansion followed by local refinement. (b)\nWorkflow for the CW C-ring with a bound partner at 5.9 \u00c5 resolution.\nRepresentative 3D reconstructions used particle subtraction followed by non-\nuniform refinement, symmetry expansion, and local refinement. The raw\nmicrographs for CW rings all had thinner ice than the micrographs for CCW\nrings. Because of this, the MS-ring structure could not be classified in any\ncase, and the structure could be determined without the application of\nparticle subtraction.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 6 Structure of the MS-ring.\n\n(a) The MS-ring is composed entirely of copies of the FliF subunit. Past\nstructures have been determined with different stoichiometries^5,6,9,10,12,\nalthough there remains debate on whether there is a biologically-relevant\nexact stoichiometry. Three views of representative cryoEM density (blue mesh)\nfor the 33-mer MS-ring, calculated at 3.4 \u00c5 resolution and superposed onto the\nfinal model. RBM1 is red, RBM2 is olive and RBM3 is blue. Regions of density\ncorresponding to other positions of RBM1 but where the quality was not\nsufficient to assign are circled. (b) Model of the MS-ring highlighting the\nrelative positions of the ring-building motifs.\n\n### Extended Data Fig. 7 Bidirectional rotation of the C-ring by MotA/B.\n\nMotA subunits are labeled A \u2013 E in the panels. (a) Comparison of MotA/B^64,65\nand MotA^79 cryoEM structures identifies varying levels of asymmetry that\nchange the width of the cleft between subunits. The most symmetric structure\nis that of isolated MotA^79. In the context of past biochemistry and\nstructures of MotA/B, the MotA/B stator binds to the torque helix on FliG_D5.\nA compelling model would use a cleft between MotA subunits, a concept with\nparallels to interlocking cogwheels in macroscopic motors. However, these\nmolecular cogwheels in the chemotaxis machinery undergo shape changes during\nfunction, which may benefit from the symmetry mismatch of MotA/B. One\npossibility is that the open MotA/B clefts^64,65 allow rapid binding or\nrelease of the torque helix without the need for a rate-limiting induced-fit\nprocess. Cleft closure would grasp the FliG_D5 torque helix tightly. (b)\nComplementary electrostatics and sterics of the torque helix of FliG_D5 and\nthe MotA/B stator. An electrostatic surface representation of the FliG_D5\ndomain shows that the torque helix is presented as an isolated feature and is\nnegatively charged. (c) A schematic mechanism for bidirectional\nMotA/B-dependent rotation of the C-ring by moving the MotA/B binding site from\nthe outside to the inside of the ring.\n\n## Supplementary information\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Tables 1 and 2.\n\n### Reporting Summary\n\n### Peer Review File\n\n### Supplementary Video 1\n\nOverview of the cryoEM density in the CCW pose. A rocking view of the MS- and\nC-ring density, displayed as a solid surface. The MS-ring is in blue, and the\nC-ring is in gold.\n\n### Supplementary Video 2\n\nOverview and organization of the C-ring and flagellar switch in the CCW pose.\nThe subunits are shown individually during the rotation of the C-ring to\nhighlight how these interact in the assembled structure.\n\n### Supplementary Video 3\n\nA tilted MS-ring and wobble during rotation. The movie shows the MS- and\nC-rings rotating. This highlights how the symmetry mismatch could result in\nthe wobble of the MS-ring during rotation.\n\n### Supplementary Video 4\n\nCCW and CW rotation induced by MotA/B. The movie starts with MotA/B powering\nthe MS- and C-ring in the CCW direction. The MS-ring and MotA/B disappear to\nhighlight how a single FliGMN_3 changes from the CCW to CW pose. Finally, the\nMS-ring and MotA/B reappear to demonstrate CW rotation.\n\n## Source data\n\n### Source Data Fig. 1\n\nUncropped micrograph for Fig. 1b.\n\n## Rights and permissions\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate\ncredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
