At one\npoint, they stopped on the side of the road to pray \u2014 and to launch a drone.\nTracking their antics from afar on X, A16z founder Marc Andreessen spurred\nthem on: \u201cDrive faster, the party\u2019s starting!\u201d\n\nThe \u201cUnofficial Stanford Defense Tech Kickoff Party\u201d was advertised as a\npublic rebuke to the university, where, weeks earlier, a student panel at the\nStanford Graduate School of Business had denied an application to form a\ndefense tech club. In the years since an employee revolt at Google prompted\nthe tech giant to drop a major Pentagon contract in 2016, venture capital\nfirms have responded by pouring more than $100 billion into defense tech\ncompanies, giving rise to a new generation of military-facing startups led by\ncolorful, patriotic founders like Palmer Luckey, the billionaire founder of\nAnduril known for donning aloha shirts, a mullet and signature goatee.\n\nIn Luckey\u2019s mold, the \u201cGundo\u201d delegation has emerged as the face of this\ntrend, loudly promoting their new flavor of Silicon Valley hustle. They pump\niron while they code, host weekly bonfires on the beach, and shotgun energy\ndrinks. They\u2019re calling for a return to America\u2019s hardware-building roots in\nEl Segundo, where pioneers like Jack Northrop and Allan Lockheed built the\npillars of America\u2019s arsenal. And they embrace Effective Accelerationism, a\nphilosophy that calls for technology to advance no matter the cost (and which\ncounts Andreessen as its poster endorser).\n\nEntrepreneur Isaiah Taylor, who started his nuclear reactor company, Valar\nAtomics, in El Segundo last summer, described the \u201cGundo founder\u201d zeitgeist\nas, essentially, a 1950\u2019s cigarette ad. \u201cThe vibe is that America is back,\ndudes rock, nicotine is good actually, we\u2019re going to the moon again (and\nMars), we\u2019re tired of only software companies coming out of America,\u201d he wrote\nin a message to Forbes. \u201cIt\u2019s good and awesome to defend our country and to\nbuild weapon systems that do that.\u201d\n\nIt helps that the vibe is also endorsed by a $500 million fund launched by\nAndreessen last year in support of \u201cAmerican Dynamism,\u201d the belief that\nAmerican companies should be building America\u2019s future. General partner\nKatherine Boyle debuted the term two years ago in a manifesto arguing that the\nAmerican superpower was in decline, kneecapped by special interest groups,\nregulatory capture and \u201cperverse structural incentives.\u201d (Last year, lobbyists\nfor the venture firm spent more than $1 million targeting lawmakers, and\nAndreessen employees separately donated more than $20 million to recent\npolitical campaigns.) Led by Boyle and fellow partner David Ulevitch, the fund\nhas pledged to invest in sectors like defense, aerospace and public safety,\nand has become a powerful credo for young founders hoping their creations will\nshape the future of war. (Andreessen Horowitz and Boyle declined to comment.)\n\n#### ^Got a tip?

John\nCoogan, entrepreneur-in-residence at Founders Fund, made a video tour with\nfounders of the neighborhood: \u201cAmerican innovation in hardware is making a\ncomeback, and it\u2019s happening in El Segundo.\u201d This month, some El Segundo\nfounders were even praised in a Tucker Carlson segment for having rejected\n\u201cthe lies of liberal modernity.\u201d\n\n> \u201cNot everyone is going to be attracted to our unapologetic style.\u201d\n>\n> Isaiah Taylor, CEO Valar Atomics\n\nNot everyone has been so enthusiastic. Online commentators have wondered about\nthe movement\u2019s glaring gender disparity. One source familiar with the El\nSegundo defense tech scene estimated that at one event there were just two\nwomen in a scrum of 150 hackers. Another noted the same issue, but claimed the\nGundo bros are not representative of the larger landscape.\n\nTaylor acknowledged there have been few women at their hackathons but\ndismissed this as simple self-selection.\u201cAnybody literally in the world can\nshow up to our bonfires, and talk about defense tech,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's opt in,\nright? Not everyone is going to be attracted to our unapologetic style of\nsaying like, \u2018you should build missiles or rockets because this country is\ngreat or worth defending.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis batch of young startups wasn\u2019t first to El Segundo, a 5.5 square mile lot\nabutting LAX airport with a long history of powering American industry.\nStandard Oil, now Chevron, credits itself with founding the town where, on a\nplot of land in 1911, it established its second (or \u201csegundo\u201d) oil refinery\nafter outgrowing its Bay Area facilities. The refinery still occupies more\nthan half of the neighborhood, which became an aircraft manufacturing hub\nduring World War II. Today, some of its largest employers are Boeing, Raytheon\nand Northrop Grumman.\n\nBut the neighborhood\u2019s counter-Silicon Valley culture has been bubbling away\nsince the arrival of SpaceX in 2002 and Anduril in 2017, both overseen by\nleaders \u2014 Elon Musk and Palmer Luckey \u2014 who now reject many of Silicon\nValley\u2019s conventions. Though he did not found Tesla, Musk has claimed the idea\nfor an electric car company came to him while at a fish restaurant in El\nSegundo, and the city is happy to be a part of these origin stories. \u201cYou had\nSpaceX move here and all these bright people in the industry have gone on to\ndo these incredible things, it\u2019s a resurgence,\u201d El Segundo\u2019s mayor Drew Boyles\ntold Forbes. \u201cWhat\u2019s real is people are literally packing up and moving here.\u201d\n\n> Doricko is a prototypical \u201cGundo\u201d founder: religious, patriotic and swole.\n> His X bio reads, \u201cDM to discuss deadlifts #beastmode.\u201d\n\nOne recent arrival is Augustus Doricko, a muscled, mulleted 23-year-old who\ndropped out of college to launch Rainmaker, a startup building drones and\nsoftware that aim to change weather patterns by making clouds rain. Doricko,\nwho has raised $1.5 million for his company, is a prototypical \u201cGundo\u201d\nfounder: religious, patriotic and swole. His X bio reads, \u201cDM to discuss\ndeadlifts #beastmode.\u201d\n\nAt a local cafe frequented by El Segundo entrepreneurs, Doricko said, over\nthree sides of bacon, that the current Gundo psyche really coalesced after\nAndreessen Horowitz announced its American Dynamism fund last May, to invest\nin new hardware and software companies that serve America\u2019s national security\ninterests.\n\n\u201cThey planted the seeds of the idea for which I'm grateful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the\nnarrative is totally beyond their control, and we've taken it and it's ours\nnow.\u201d He described the ideal Gundo founder as \u201cextremely intense. And cool,\nunlike the sort of hunchback quiet software founders notorious in San\nFrancisco.\u201d\n\nAt Doricko\u2019s Rainmaker factory, nearly a dozen college-age entrepreneurs\nrecently held a week-long event to draw up pitch decks for their companies.\nJakob Diepenbrock, a student at Northeastern University who organized the\ngathering, packed a fridge with 50 pounds of ground beef and racks of Monster\nenergy drinks to feed the group. \u201cFuel of legends,\u201d the 20-year-old\nDiepenbrock told Forbes.\n\nAmong the attendees was Ulys Sorok, a University of Waterloo dropout who did a\nstint at Sam Altman\u2019s crypto venture WorldCoin. He\u2019s building a company he\nhopes will someday make \u201cself-replicating machines.\u201d \u201cThis is the type of\nvision that changes the literal trajectory of humanity,\u201d Sorok said. \u201cAnd I'm\nexcited to be on the forefront of what we're doing.\u201d\n\nSome engineers in the area aren\u2019t quite sure what to make of all this. \u201cWhat's\non Twitter is not based in reality,\u201d Chris Power, founder of Hadrian, which\nhas raised more than $100 million and automates the manufacture of components\nfor military hardware, told Forbes. \u201cLike all great momentum waves and venture\ncapital, you gotta turn hype into reality,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it's mostly\ndetermined by how many of the founders are serious versus those that can't\ntransition from a running start.\u201d\n\nDelian Asparouhov, a partner at Founders Fund who has raised more than $180\nmillion for his space drug-testing company Varda, recently said it more\nforcefully, dismissing a group of El Segundo-based entrepreneurs as \u201cunserious\npeople,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cGo do something meaningful with your life before\nthrowing stones.\u201d (Asparouhov didn\u2019t respond to a comment request.)\n\nJust a few years ago, university campuses were protesting the recruiting\nefforts of defense contractors like Palantir. But conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza,\nand rising tensions with China, have made the idea of El Segundo a dog whistle\nfor patriotic college students looking to build tech for the battlefield.\n\"Talking about defense in the classroom was a taboo,\" said Rasmus Dey Meyer, a\nGeorgetown University student who hosted a hackathon in El Segundo earlier\nthis year. \"You'd get eyes if you were seen as an advocate of the defense tech\nindustry.\"\n\nThe hackathon was led by Dey Meyer\u2019s company Apollo Defense, which he\ncofounded with Catarina Buchatskiy, Nathaniel Salander and Tommy Tietjen.\nThere, engineers toiled late into the night working on systems for the\nfrontlines in Ukraine to be considered by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.\nBuchatskiy, an international relations student at Stanford who, last summer,\ntrained alongside soldiers in Kyiv to become a licensed drone pilot, said the\ngoal of the event was \u201cto be mission oriented, which differentiated it from\nmany of the hackathons we\u2019re seeing,\u201d she told Forbes. \u201cIn defense tech, you\nhave to be building for something.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s a sense of collective purpose. \"I think that's\nemblematic of the same American Dynamism-like, McCarthy-esque, nuclear family,\nsupportive and integrated community that's representative of El Segundo at\nlarge,\u201d Dey Meyer said.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the spectacle of it all. The party bus, the beef-stuffed\nfridge, the bicep curls. To more seasoned entrepreneurs, it's a potential\ndistraction from the real business building at hand. Bryon Hargis, a former\ntop SpaceX engineer who started a hypersonic missile company called Castelion\nlast year, said he set up the company in El Segundo because of access to\nmanufacturing talent. Hargis, who\u2019s raised $14 million from Andreessen and\nlast month oversaw the company\u2019s first weapons test, said he loves the energy\nof the scene, but he could do without the bluster.\n\n\u201cHaving an excited new generation interested in American values is\nphenomenal,\u201d Hargis said. Though \u201cfrom our perspective, getting caught up in\nmeme culture doesn't necessarily help us reach our super, super conservative\ncustomer. But God bless them.\u201d\n\n#### MORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesPentagon Kills A Key Tech Program, Dealing A Blow To Silicon Valley's\nDefense AmbitionsBy David JeansForbesThis Startup Sells Access To Data\nLocating People At Foreign Military Bases And EmbassiesBy Sarah\nEmersonForbesEric Schmidt's Secret Military Project Revealed: Attack Drones.By\nSarah EmersonForbesDefense Contractor Scale AI Quietly Scrapped Deal With\nChinese-Owned TikTok Over Security ConcernsBy David Jeans\n\nDavid Jeans\n\nI'm a senior writer at Forbes covering AI, defense and national security.
