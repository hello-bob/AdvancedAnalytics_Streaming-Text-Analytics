More specifically, given a JPEG\nimage signed with our signature scheme, a third party can compress the image\nusing JPEG compression, and, as long as the quantization tables only include\npowers of two, derive a valid signature for the compressed image, without\naccess to the secret signing key, and without interaction with the signer. Our\nscheme is constructed using a standard digital signature scheme and a hash\nfunction as building blocks. This form of signatures that allow image\ncompression could be useful in mitigating some of the threats posed by\ngenerative AI and fake news, without interfering with all uses of generative\nAI. Taking inspiration from related signature schemes, we define a notion of\nunforgeability and prove our construction to be secure. Additionally, we show\nthat our signatures have size 32.5 kb under standard parameter choices. Using\nimage quality assessment metrics, we show that JPEG compression with\nparameters as specified by our scheme, does not result in perceivably reduced\nvisual fidelity, compared to standard JPEG compression.\n\n##### Metadata\n\nAvailable format(s)\n\n    PDF\nCategory\n\n    Applications\nPublication info\n\n    Preprint.\nKeywords\n\n    digital signaturesJPEG Compressionhomomorphic signatures\nContact author(s)\n\n    simon @ serfurth dk\nHistory\n\n    2024-04-16: approved\n    2024-04-16: received\n    See all versions\nShort URL\n\n    https://ia.cr/2024/588\nLicense\n\n    CC BY\n\nBibTeX\n\n    \n    \n    @misc{cryptoeprint:2024/588, author = {Simon Erfurth}, title = {Digital Signatures for Authenticating Compressed JPEG Images}, howpublished = {Cryptology ePrint Archive, Paper 2024/588}, year = {2024}, note = {\\url{https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/588}}, url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/588} }\n\nNote: In order to protect the privacy of readers, eprint.iacr.org does not use\ncookies or embedded third party content.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
