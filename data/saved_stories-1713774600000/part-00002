They\noffer no way to link to something that I look at. (Oh, I know there are\nexceptions to this rule, but they typically require effort \u2014 a lot more than\nmany developers are prepared to invest). They are bloated and slow to load,\neven though the actual information they display and the interaction they offer\nis very simple.\n\nAm I just an old, grumpy guy? Yes, but that\u2019s beside the point. My point is\nthat from an architectural perspective, most single page apps are the result\nof making the wrong choices and missing important opportunities.\n\nMy main beef with single page apps, or SPAs for short, is that they\u2019re not \u201con\nthe web\u201d. In that regard, they are very similar to a SOAP web service. They\nhave a URI, but only for the whole thing, not for all of those valuable things\nthat are inside of it. (Again, I know you can build your SPA differently, but\nmost people don\u2019t.) I believe that if you build a web application, it should\nhave a web UI that merits the name, similarly to a web service that should\nhave something to do with the web.\n\nIf this all seems very abstract to you, think about what makes the web the\nweb. The single most important feature of the web is that you can link to\nindividual things. Every important concept within your application should be a\npossible entry point. This enables anyone, anywhere, to use it as the target\nof a link. The fact that a user can move forwards and backwards through the\nhistory of the things they have visited is not a bug, it\u2019s an essential\nfeature. It is crucial that each of those targets returns a response quickly,\nbecause any overhead you create will have to be paid for multiple times. The\nback and forward buttons are not supposed to navigate between applications.\n\nI can almost hear you say: \u201cBut I don\u2019t care about the web. I\u2019m building an\napplication, not a website.\u201d To which I say: Go ahead then, build an\napplication, using your desktop\u2019s or mobile operating systems native toolkit,\nor build an applet, or a Flash or Silverlight application. That\u2019s all fine by\nme. I don\u2019t even object to you building the same thing using the browser as an\napplication runtime. Just be aware that when you do things this way, your\napplication is on the web just as much as if you had built it as a Java\napplet. Be aware of what you\u2019re sacrificing.\n\nThis is where I believe people\u2019s wrong choices come in. It seems as if for\nmany people, building an SPA has become synonymous with building a modern web\napplication. Anybody who criticizes this architectural approach has obviously\nnot made the move to the modern world. I couldn\u2019t disagree more. People choose\nan SPA without being aware of the downsides, including such things as\nframeworks that go out of maintenance, almost unmanageable complexity in\nclient-side code, as well as performance and accessibility issues.\n\nBut more importantly, they miss out on the benefits of not choosing an SPA.\nThey\u2019re not aware of the benefits of the alternative. What is this\nalternative, then? It is to build a classic web application, including\nrendering server-side HTML, and use JavaScript only sparingly, to enhance\nbrowser functionality where possible. In this architectural approach, it is\nabsolutely clear that the responsibility for actual business logic resides\ncompletely on the server. This includes the server-side state machine that\ngoverns the transitions between pages. And again, this is not a bug, but a\nfeature: It is what enables a quick change on the server side to take effect\nimmediately, everywhere \u2014 including the other kinds of clients that you might\nend up building in addition to your web UI. Business logic does not belong in\nthe client, unless you like having to redundantly maintain the same logic in\nevery kind of client you support (in addition to maintaining it on the server,\nof course \u2014 remember that you can never trust any client). From a server-side\nviewpoint, the best architecture you can have is the one you could (and\nshould) have built a decade ago: following REST principles, including\nstateless communication and identification of resources.\n\nSome people object to this because they believe that SPA gives you a better\narchitecture. I disagree: With an SPA, your architecture typically is the one\nsuggested by your framework because from a web perspective, your SPA is a\nsingle thing the web is concerned with. With a non-SPA approach (which I\u2019m\ngoing to call ROCA from now on), the architecture governing your applications\nis the one of the web itself. Again, the fact that your server takes on the\nboring task of rendering HTML is an asset, not a burden. I, for one, don\u2019t\nhave a lot of trust in the stability and long-term maintainability of any of\nthe currently existing, client-side JavaScript frameworks.\n\nA fantastic example of the problems created by the SPA approach is\nparallelization of work. If you have a team of multiple people, or God forbid,\nmultiple teams working on the same SPA, you need to come up with a good way to\nsupport this. Instead, you can just have each of those teams build their own\nweb application. Each of those applications can be connected to every other\none built at the same time by the same organization (as well as to every other\nweb application residing anywhere, if you want to) \u2014 in fact relying on the\ncore strength of the web.\n\nIn terms of accessibility, rendering semantic HTML on the server-side provides\nan out-of-the-box support. There is only a limited set of things that you can\ndo with HTML, and again this is a feature, not a bug.\n\nYou can address some of those problems within an SPA, too. But it takes\neffort. With the ROCA approach, you have a well-known, extremely mature,\nproven architecture to rely on.\n\nOf course, this does not at all suggest you do not use JavaScript and Ajax. I\nam completely aware that you cannot build a modern user interface without\nJavaScript to enable some in-page modification. But that is an optional\nenhancement, not the driving factor of your architecture. (Even from a REST\nperspective, using JavaScript is perfectly fine: It is actually mentioned as\nan optional constraint in the REST dissertation as \u201ccode on demand\u201d. But its\nintended purpose is to serve as a means to extend the browser to support\ncontent it does not support natively.) In almost every case I\u2019m aware of, your\nSPA has zero benefit for the user, and there are only positive sides to\nembracing browser features instead. You might believe there are benefits for\nthe developer, but first of all, you should put those behind the interest of\nthe user, and secondly, they\u2019re mostly make-believe, especially in the long\nrun.\n\nSo build your SPAs, I don\u2019t mind, as long as I don\u2019t have to use them. Just be\naware of what it is you\u2019re giving up.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf this article was helpful, .\n\nLearn to code for free. freeCodeCamp's open source curriculum has helped more\nthan 40,000 people get jobs as developers.
