By Lisa\nJennings on Apr. 24, 2024\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n\nAlexis Ohanian (left) and Jenny Nguyen plan to multiply The Sports Bra\nnationwide. |Photo courtesy of FSI Social.\n\nWomen\u2019s sports are in the spotlight this year and a bar in Portland,\nOregon\u2014cleverly called The Sports Bra\u2014is poised to take advantage.\n\nThe Sports Bra, which is dedicated to female athletes and the sports they\nplay, on Monday announced an undisclosed investment designed to help the\nconcept expand with franchising.\n\nThe investment, which was not characterized, comes from 776 Foundation, a\nventure firm founded in 2022 by Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder of Reddit, who is\nalso a principal owner of Angel City Football Club and Los Angeles Golf Club.\nHe is also married to tennis champion Serena Williams.\n\nFounded two years ago in Portland, The Sports Bra is among the first to\nexclusively televise women\u2019s sports, but similar concepts have been popping up\nacross the country.\n\nLast month, A Bar of Their Own opened in Minneapolis, for example. Rough &\nTumble opened in late 2022 in Seattle. Watch Me Sports Bar is hosting popups\nin Southern California with the goal of opening this summer in Long Beach. In\nNew York, a sports bar inspired by Althea Gibson, the first Black athlete in\nwomen\u2019s tennis, is reportedly coming in the fall. In Denver, the 99ers Sports\nBar is also in the works.\n\nThe Sports Bra founder and CEO Jenny Nguyen appears to have struck a chord at\na time when female athletes are breaking records.\n\nViewership of the 2024 NCAA women\u2019s basketball tournament reached 18.7\nmillion, eclipsing the men\u2019s tournament and outpacing the 2023 World Series\nand NBA Finals, the foundation said.\n\nFormer Iowa Hawkeye Caitlin Clark, who was recently drafted by the Indiana\nFever in the WNBA, was an all-time scoring leader in college basketball\nhistory and on Tuesday was the first to win for the second time the James E.\nSullivan Award given to most outstanding college players.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer Team broke viewership records for\nthe FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nNguyen, in a statement, said, \u201cWhen I first opened The Sports Bra two years\nago this month, I had no idea the impact it would have on so many so quickly.\nNow I can see we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\n\nThe investment will support the concept\u2019s growth, but also \u201cto advance future\ngenerations of women athletes,\u201d but exactly how is unclear.\n\nThe bar has a full menu with starters like baby back ribs and Aunt Tina\u2019s\nVietna-Wings, salads and a lineup of burgers and sandwiches. There\u2019s also a\nkid\u2019s menu, and desserts.\n\nDrinks include signature and specialty cocktails, as well as zero-proof\noptions, and, of course, beer and wine and other non-alcohol options.\n\nNguyen in an email said it's not clear yet where the concept will grow, but\nthe application process will open within the next couple months. The bar is\nworking with iFranchise to assist the process, and Nguyen hopes to open\nanother location in Portland.\n\n\u201cThis is an exhilarating time for women\u2019s sports, and The Sports Bra has\nproven the strong need for more places to celebrate them,\u201d Nguyen said in the\nstatement. \u201cI envision a future full of Sports Bras everywhere doing what we\ndo best: supporting women.\u201d\n\nMembers help make our journalism possible.
