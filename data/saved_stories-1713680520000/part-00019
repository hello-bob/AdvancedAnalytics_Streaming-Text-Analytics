Delays due to Solana congestion.\n\nNOTICE: For Uphold users, payments will now appear as one deposit into your\nUphold account, rather than an individual deposit for each Rewards profile\nconnected to your Uphold account. Example: If you have 3 browsers verified\nwith Uphold, each earning 1 BAT for the month, you will receive a deposit into\nUphold for 3 BAT.\n\nNote that this status update post is for Brave Ads earnings payouts to Brave\nbrowser users . This thread is not for creator payouts.\n\nPlease make sure that you are using the latest version of the browser as it\nincludes important fixes and updates that help ensure a smooth payout process\n\nDidn\u2019t receive your payout or only received a portion of it? Here are some\nthings to consider first.\n\n  1. Are payouts still processing? It may take several days to fully process the large list of transactions. You may therefore see other users receiving their payouts before yours arrives. Additionally, if you are using Brave Rewards on multiple devices, they may be paid out at separate times \u2013 that is, you may receive payment for one of your devices before the other(s). The browser, and this thread, will tell you when all payouts are complete.\n\n  2. Are you included in the payout period? Please note that the payout beginning in April is for Brave Ads earnings throughout February. If you only recently enabled Brave Ads (for example, after March 31st, 2024), you will receive your payout in next month\u2019s payout period.\n\n  3. Why is my payment amount different than what my \u2018estimated earnings\u2019 was showing? This is perfectly normal! Sometimes ads do not fully reconcile (\u201ccash in\u201d) before the end of the payment period. So while this does appear in your Estimated earnings in real time, unreconciled funds will not appear in the current month\u2019s payout and will instead be \u201crolled over\u201d into next month\u2019s payment.\n\n  4. Maybe you received it! Your payout will be deposited directly into your account, so be sure to check your transaction history in your Uphold, Gemini, ZebPay, or bitFlyer account.\n\n#\n\nWhy is the iOS app updated so sparingly?\n\nBrowser SupportMobile Support\n\nios\n\nYou have selected 0 posts.\n\nselect all\n\ncancel selecting\n\nmigsyboy\n\nOct 2023\n\nJust curious.

Apple doesn\u2019t\nallow third party developers to use any other browser engine other than the\nWebKit which is the engine developed by Apple. This is also the case why there\nmight be difference in showing the websites on your iPhone and Android. Or why\nsome features might be exclusive for PCs and Android.\n\nBrave for PCs and Android devices is built on top of Chromium which is open\nsource project developed by Google. And because Chromium is updated very\nfrequently (unlike Safari), Brave is also frequently updated on the platforms\nwhere it\u2019s based of Chromium.\n\nSafari isn\u2019t frequently updated so there\u2019s no need to update Brave more\nfrequently on the iOS. When Apple updates Safari, Brave team will release an\nupdate as well.\n\nmigsyboy\n\nOct 2023\n\nIs this correct?\n\nSo when I install Edge or Chrome on iOS, I\u2019m still really using Safari/Webkit?\n\nI\u2019m finding that hard to believe!\n\nmarko30\n\nOct 2023\n\nmigsyboy:\n\n> So when I install Edge or Chrome on iOS, I\u2019m still really using\n> Safari/Webkit?\n\nCorrect.\n\nmigsyboy:\n\n> I\u2019m finding that hard to believe!\n\nTake a look at this\u2014https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/01/web-developers-challenge-\napple-to-allow-other-browser-engines-on-ios/ 228\n\nmigsyboy\n\nOct 2023\n\nWow, I wasn\u2019t aware of it! Thanks a lot.\n\nSaoirayCommunity Ninja\n\nOct 2023\n\n@migsyboy Yeah, essentially all web browsers use one of three engines (with\nsome exceptions, but small enough to not count)\n\n  * Webkit = Safari and all browsers on iOS, as it\u2019s mandated by Apple\n\n  * Chromium/Blink = Chrome, Vivaldi, Brave, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Samsung Internet Browser, Kiwi, etc. that run on anything other than iOS.\n\n  * Gecko = Firefox and Thunderbird email client\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\n  * Goanna = Pale Moon, Basilisk, K-Meleon\n\nIn any case, they all pretty much share the same core and the differences are\nthen just what gets added and removed. Like Vivaldi adds more for cosmetic\nchoices, Brave does a lot for crypto and privacy, etc.\n\nBut much like the article shared by @marko30, we\u2019re bound to be seeing some\nchanges here in the future. It\u2019s just a question of what Brave is going to do\nabout it.\n\nhttps://www.applemust.com/eu-industry-chief-warns-apple-will-be-forced-to-\nopen-up/ 19\n\nComputerworld\n\n### \u2018We hoped not to use WebKit at all,' says Vivaldi CEO, as iOS browser\nships 15\n\nWith Europe's DMA in place, \u201cthe gatekeeper is no longer going to be able to\ndictate what you use or try to force you to use software you do not like,\"\nsays Vivaldi chief Jon von Tetzchner.\n\nBasically, EU has made rulings that Apple has to open up to competition and\ncan\u2019t demand Webkit only for browsers. This means Brave might be able to use\nthe same Chromium core as Android and all.\n\nEU also is one that pushed Apple to switch iPhone over to USB-C instead of\ntheir own special charger.\n\n** NOTE **\n\nOne thing I will point out is that Brave has been using iOS as testing app as\nwell. Like iOS version got Playlist before any others. It also was the first\nto get VPN. So as much as it often gets updated less and falls behind on\nversion numbers, it\u2019s usually stayed ahead a bit in terms of features.\n\nmarko30\n\nOct 2023\n\n@Saoiray I\u2019d like to add that, apparently, Apple has plans to limit these\nchanges to the EU market only. Meaning, nothing will change for the users in\nother markets. Just for us in the EU.\n\nSaoirayCommunity Ninja\n\nOct 2023\n\nmarko30:\n\n> Apple has plans to limit these changes to the EU market only\n\nHave a source for that? Keep in mind it\u2019s usually a major pain for such things\nto go into play like that and opens up a lot of possibility for troubles. Just\nas they made sure not to make any regional specific iPhone for the ruling on\ncharger, they very much won\u2019t create different rules in their app store and OS\nto differentiate between regions.\n\nmarko30\n\nOct 2023\n\nSaoiray:\n\n> Have a source for that?\n\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2023/06/13/ios-17-beta-sideloading/ 11\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2023/04/21/ios-17-side-loading-feature-us/ 5\n\n9to5Mac \u2013 25 Apr 23\n\n### iOS 16 has new system to restrict features based on user\u2019s location 2\n\nYou can use an iPhone or iPad almost anywhere in the world, but some iOS\nfeatures are only available in...\n\nEst. reading time: 3 minutes\n\nSaoiray:\n\n> Keep in mind it\u2019s usually a major pain for such things to go into play like\n> that and opens up a lot of possibility for troubles. Just as they made sure\n> not to make any regional specific iPhone for the ruling on charger, they\n> very much won\u2019t create different rules in their app store and OS to\n> differentiate between regions.\n\nEveryone has USB-C iPhone because it\u2019s not viable for Apple to make two\ndifferent versions with two different chargers. Too much hassle especially\nwhen Lightning was only used on iPhones when other Apple products embraced\nUSB-C long time ago.\n\nThis one is different because it wouldn\u2019t need hardware change, just a simple\nsoftware one. They could create two different software versions like Android\nbrands do. Besides, they want to force users to use AppStore because then they\nearn money; it\u2019s not in their interest to make sideloading available\nworldwide, so they\u2019ll make it available only where they have to.\n\nMy guess is Apple won\u2019t change their policy of the AppStore. They still won\u2019t\nallow 3rd party browsers with any engine, they\u2019ll still require WebKit to be\nused. BUT they will add ability to install other AppStores that won\u2019t have the\nsame limitation.\n\nSaoirayCommunity Ninja\n\nOct 2023\n\n@marko30 Ah, so you\u2019re just going by people speculating, but nothing official.\nNothing in those links have had anyone from Apple say it or anything. As such,\nI wouldn\u2019t say Apple has plans to limit these changes to the EU market only.\nIt\u2019s just that some reporters or other individuals THINK that Apple COULD\nlimit it.\n\nGood to know thoughts, but just the way you had it phrased made it seem like\nit was something official. It will be interesting to see which way it goes.\n\nmarko30\n\nOct 2023\n\nSaoiray:\n\n> it seem like it was something official. It will be interesting to see which\n> way it goes.\n\nI said apparently. I never said Apple confirmed it. But I really do believe\nsideloading will only be available in the EU. I mean, Apple earns a lot of\nmoney through the AppStore. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to make sideloading and\nallow 3rd party app stores everywhere because that would mean less money to\nthem.\n\nDid you see how much they complained when EU forced them to adapt USB-C? It\u2019s\nnot without the reason. They made so much money from rights/certification of\n3rd party accessories. Huh, there were even reports that Apple planned to\nlimit charging speed for 3rd party cables, but EU warned them again that\u2019s\nagainst the law and they will be fined if they do that and potentially have\niPhones banned in the EU.\n\nIt\u2019s the same story how they don\u2019t want to make iMessage available for\nAndroid. Or add RCS support. All of that could only have negative effect on\nApple.\n\nApple\u2019s business model is pretty much to try to lock you in their ecosystem so\nyou only leave your money with them and no one else. And they do it in a way\nthat\u2019s gray line here in the EU. This is why EC has to intervene.\n\n1 month later\n\nClosed on Nov 21, 2023\n\nThis topic was automatically closed 30 days after the last reply.
