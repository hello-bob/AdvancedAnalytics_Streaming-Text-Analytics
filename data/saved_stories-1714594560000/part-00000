It\u2019s powerful because it offers exquisite control over the nanoworld\nof molecular, atomic, and subatomic phenomena. It\u2019s weird because, while we\nhave a complete mathematical formalism, we physicists have been arguing for\nmore than a century over what that formalism means. In other words, unlike\nother physical theories, the mathematics of quantum mechanics has no clear\ninterpretation. That means physicists and philosophers have been left arguing\nabout which interpretation makes the most sense. Sometimes the idea of\n\u201csimplicity\u201d is invoked to answer that question.\n\nSo today, based on a wonderful discussion that began on X of all places, I\nwant to argue that Quantum Bayesianism, or QBism, offers the \u201csimplest\u201d\naccount of that all-powerful quantum formalism.\n\n## The \u201csimplest\u201d explanation\n\nThere are two main parts of the quantum formalism. The first is what\u2019s called\nthe dynamical equation. This part gives us a mathematical description of how\nundisturbed systems evolve. We physicists love our dynamical equations \u2014\nthings like Newton\u2019s equations for particles or Maxwell\u2019s equations for\nelectromagnetic waves. In classical physics, the dynamical equation was pretty\nmuch the end of the story. Nothing else was required and we came to think of\nthose equations as existing \u201cout there.\u201d They were timeless laws of physics\nthat never required any reference to what physicists were doing.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case for quantum mechanics. In non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation serves as the fundamental dynamical\nequation. Schrodinger\u2019s equation yields what\u2019s called the \u201cwave function,\u201d the\nmathematical object describing the state of the system as it evolves in time.\nBut here is where the monkey wrench gets thrown into the story. The wave\nfunction is weird in a bunch of ways. In particular, it tells us that the\nsystem (say, a particle) can have many values of its physical properties (like\nposition or spin) at the same time. Another way of saying this is that the\ndifferent values are superposed. The ambiguity about non-preexisting\nproperties in a superposition is where all the hoopla over Schrodinger\u2019s\nfamous cats, with their simultaneous \u201cdeadness\u201d and \u201cnot deadness,\u201d\noriginates. \u201cDeadness\u201d and \u201cnot deadness\u201d could not occur in classical\nphysics, where there\u2019s no question about the reality of system properties\nother than experimental uncertainty. So, what determines the actual value a\ngiven property takes in quantum physics?\n\n## The role of measurement\n\nThe answer, strangely enough, is measurement itself. Along with the dynamical\nSchrodinger equation, the quantum formalism adds the Born rule. The Born rule\ntells us that when a measurement is made, the dynamics of the Schrodinger\nequation are interrupted. The superposed wave function \u201ccollapses\u201d to a single\nvalue. In particular, the Born rule tells us we must use probabilities\nextracted from the wave function itself to predict what will be measured.\n\nSchrodinger\u2019s dynamical equation \u2014 the wave function with its strange\nsuperposition of properties and the Born rule: That\u2019s the quantum formalism.\nThe century-long debate about quantum interpretation has spun around how to\nunderstand these things in terms of reality. But in the long history of that\ndebate, most of the effort has come from trying to work around the Born rule.\nBecause we physicists love our timeless dynamical laws so much, the Born rule\nwas seen as a scar on an otherwise beautiful theory. For many researchers, the\ntask became to preserve that beauty and think your way out of the Born rule\nstrictures. This involved explaining (or explaining away) the role of\nmeasurement and, by implication, measurers.\n\nIt\u2019s an effort that\u2019s led to some pretty wild extrapolations. For example, the\nfamous many worlds interpretation (MWI) claims that each time a measurement is\nmade, a new \u201cworld\u201d emerges. In the MWI, there\u2019s one world for each part of\nthe wave function. When a measurement is made, these worlds become\ndisconnected from each other, existing side by side like ghosts (which is why\nI call it the \u201cmany ghosts interpretation\u201d). In that X conversation I\nmentioned, my friend and colleague Jason Wright asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t the MWI the\nsimplest interpretation because it just takes the wave function as is?\u201d Within\na certain kind of logic, the question makes sense. Those different (and\npossibly infinite) superposed pieces of the wave function just pop out of\nSchrodinger\u2019s equation. Why not treat all of them as real in some way? (It\u2019s\nworth noting that Wright says he is not a proponent of MWI, he\u2019s just asking\nthe question.)\n\nMy answer is there\u2019s an even simpler way to see what\u2019s going on, which is\nexactly what QBism does. Rather than see the wave function as the holy of\nholies whose reality must be preserved at all costs, focus instead on what\u2019s\nnew in the quantum formalism, i.e. the Born rule. Quantum mechanics has been\nscreaming at us that measurement matters for 100 years. Hearing that and\ntaking it to heart is exactly what QBism brings to the table.\n\n## Focusing on the Born rule\n\nSo, how does QBism accomplish this so simply? It treats the wave function as\nencoding information about our interaction with the world, not the world\nitself as seen from some perfect God\u2019s-eye view. As my colleague, the eminent\nquantum physicist Joe Eberly, put it, \u201cIt\u2019s not the electron\u2019s wave function,\nit\u2019s yours.\u201d Take this position and you don\u2019t need infinite numbers of\nunobservable ghost worlds or other science-fiction entities. That certainly\nseems a lot simpler to me.\n\nThe thing about quantum mechanics, however, is every interpretation pays some\nprice that takes you beyond the easy-to-picture-in-your-head perspective of\nclassical physics. QBism\u2019s price is to see quantum mechanics revealing\nfundamental aspects of us and the world together, not the world alone. The way\nit pursues this is a relentless focus on the Born rule. Why is there a Born\nrule? Where does it arise? How does it arise? What is it telling us about us\nas agents responding to the world as it pushes back against us when we do\nexperiments?\n\nRather than trying to sidestep the Born rule and see it as a scar, QBism takes\nit as quantum mechanics\u2019 central and very beautiful mystery. How it does this\nand what it may mean for science will be the next installment in my QBism\nseries.\n\nTags\n\nparticle physics\n\nIn this article\n\nparticle physics\n\nRelated\n\n13.8\n\nQBism and the philosophical crisis of quantum mechanics\n\nThe perfectly accessible, perfectly knowable Universe of classical physics is\ngone forever, no matter what interpretation you choose.\n\n13.8\n\n\u201cQBism\u201d: The most radical interpretation of quantum mechanics ever\n\nA relatively new interpretation of quantum mechanics asks us to reimagine the\nprocess of science itself.\n\n13.8\n\nWhat reality does quantum theory describe?
