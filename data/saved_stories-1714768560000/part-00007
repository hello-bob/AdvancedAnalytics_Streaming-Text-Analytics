We\u2019re bringing this lawsuit to give people more\ncontrol over their social media experience and data and to expand knowledge\nabout how platforms shape public discourse.\"\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit seeks a declaration that Zuckerman's browser\nextension \"does not violate Meta\u2019s Terms of Service, the Computer Fraud and\nAbuse Act, or California\u2019s Computer Data Access and Fraud Act.\" It argues that\nthrough Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, US lawmakers sought \"to\npromote the development of filtering tools that enable users to curate their\nonline experiences and avoid content they would rather not see.\"\n\nSection 230 offers interactive computer services safe harbor from liability\nunder certain conditions. It's been challenged in recent years by those who\nargue social media sites have been given too much latitude to avoid being\naccountable for distributing harmful user-generated content.\n\nZuckerman hopes his yet-to-be-released browser extension will free people from\nthe algorithmically-optimized psychological pressure to engage with the\nFacebook newsfeed. It automates the cumbersome process of unfollowing Facebook\nusers, groups, and pages.\n\nAs the lawsuit explains, there's growing public concern that the business\nmodel of social media, which seeks to keep people engaged so they see ads, is\nmanipulative and harmful to public discourse.\n\n\"For example, many experts argue that the platforms' engagement-driven\nalgorithms contribute to the spread of false, extreme, or polarizing content,\nwhile also stoking division and violence offline,\" the complaint says. \"Many\nusers want more control over their social media experiences, but the companies\nhave largely refused to give it to them.\"\n\nBased on those arguments, Meta is currently being sued by at least 33 US\nstates and hundreds of US school districts for alleged mental harms suffered\nby children exposed to its social media services. And CEO Mark Zuckerberg was\nrecently browbeaten into apologizing to social media victims at a Senate\nJudiciary Committee hearing.\n\n### Need to check with the lawyers\n\nUnfollow Everything 2.0 hasn't been released because in 2021 Meta threatened\nto sue Louis Barclay, a UK-based developer who made a similar tool, Unfollow\nEverything. Barclay, who was banned from Facebook for life for his efforts,\nsaid via another social media service, \"I'm absolutely over the moon at the\nnews of this lawsuit.\"\n\nThe complaint notes that Meta has made similar legal threats against others,\nincluding the makers of the Friendly Social Browser and the NYU researchers\ninvolved with the Ad Observer project, which aimed to monitor social media\nadvertising patterns. Thus, Amherst's Zuckerman seeks a declaration from the\ncourt that his tool is lawful.\n\nMeta declined to comment.\n\nSanta Clara University law professor Eric Goldman expressed skepticism about\nthe complaint's prospects to The Register.\n\n\"The complaint raises important and interesting social, legal, and technical\nquestions, none of which I expect the court to resolve,\" said Goldman, who\nwrites regularly about Section 230.\n\n\"The case probably will be dismissed on procedural grounds for lack of\n'standing.' Most likely, a court will say that Zuckerman's fears of possible\nfuture legal liability are currently insufficient for him to initiate a legal\nbattle.\"\n\n  * Post Office slapped down for late disclosure of documents in Horizon scandal inquiry\n  * US Republican party's spam filter lawsuit against Google dismissed\n  * Malwarebytes may not be allowed to label rival's app as 'potentially unwanted'\n  * Can YouTube be held liable for pushing terror vids? Asking for a Supreme Court...\n\nJennifer Jones, staff attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute at\nColumbia University, doesn't believe that will be an issue. \"Professor\nZuckerman has standing because he has a real and reasonable fear that Meta\nwould sue him if he released Unfollow Everything 2.0,\" she told The Register.\n\n\"Meta has threatened other researchers for releasing similar tools, and it\neven threatened the developer of a nearly identical tool called Unfollow\nEverything.\"\n\nThe outcome of the case could have implications for other content filtering\nsoftware, including content blocking applications. \"Section 230 protects the\ndevelopment of tools that empower users of internet services to filter the\ncontent they see,\" explained Jones.\n\n\"This protection reflects Congress\u2019s desire to allow people to control their\nonline experiences. It would apply to tools that allow users to block\nharassing content, pornographic content, or any other kind of content that\nthey would just prefer not to see online.\"\n\nGoldman also questioned Zuckerman's plan to use his user empowerment tool for\na second purpose, conducting research.\n\n\"While Zuckerman would surely follow ethical research practices, other\nresearchers making identical legal arguments may pose significant\ncybersecurity and privacy risks that could worry a court,\" he explained.\n\n\"In contrast, if the only question in the lawsuit was whether it was legal to\nrelease a tool that helped Facebook users automatically unfollow other users,\nthe case would not raise as many thorny policy questions.\"\n\n### A hopeless cause\n\nAnother concern of Goldman's is that the complaint fails to adequately deal\nwith questions about whether Meta/Facebook might still block Unfollow\nEverything 2.0, even if Zuckerman prevailed in court.\n\n\"In other words, if the case resolves Zuckerman's legal questions, but\nFacebook can still exercise 'self-help' to protect its interests, what exactly\nwould the case accomplish?\" Goldman asked.\n\nMeta already does so. In 2022, the social ad biz started encrypting the\nparameters it adds to its web links for tracking, to prevent privacy-oriented\nbrowsers and extensions from removing that information. And the social network\nhas taken other steps that obfuscate its web page structure and deter data\ngathering.\n\nYouTube similarly has admitted to running scripts to detect ad blocking tools\n\u2013 a practice challenged in Ireland \u2013 and it recently implemented changes that\naffect video performance when ad blocking tools are detected. So were\nZuckerman to prevail, that wouldn't necessarily prevent Meta from changing its\nservice to break Zuckerman's extension.\n\n\"Of course, Meta and other companies could try to frustrate the use of these\ntools through technical countermeasures, but there\u2019s only so much they can do\nto control information that is ultimately presented on a user\u2019s computer,\"\nopined Jones. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Law\n  * Meta\n  * Social Media\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Law\n  * Meta\n  * Social Media\n  * Software\n  * Web Browser\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * Antitrust\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Brave\n  * Chrome\n  * Confluence\n  * cookies\n  * Cross-border data flow\n  * Database\n  * Digital Services Act\n  * Facebook\n  * Firefox\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * HTTP\n  * IDE\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Jenkins\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Map\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * Open Compute Project\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Opera\n  * Privacy Shield\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Safari\n  * Search Engine\n  * Social Network\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Text Editor\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * Vivaldi\n  * WebAssembly\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Andrew McCollum\n  * Chris Hughes\n  * Dustin Moskovitz\n  * Eduardo Saverin\n  * Mark Zuckerberg\n\n#### More about\n\n12 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Law\n  * Meta\n  * Social Media\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Law\n  * Meta\n  * Social Media\n  * Software\n  * Web Browser\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * Antitrust\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Brave\n  * Chrome\n  * Confluence\n  * cookies\n  * Cross-border data flow\n  * Database\n  * Digital Services Act\n  * Facebook\n  * Firefox\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * HTTP\n  * IDE\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Jenkins\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Map\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * Open Compute Project\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Opera\n  * Privacy Shield\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Safari\n  * Search Engine\n  * Social Network\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Text Editor\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * Vivaldi\n  * WebAssembly\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Andrew McCollum\n  * Chris Hughes\n  * Dustin Moskovitz\n  * Eduardo Saverin\n  * Mark Zuckerberg\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Open Source world's Bruce Perens emits draft Post-Open Zero Cost License\n\nInterview Software doyen hopes to achieve a third impossible thing\n\nSoftware3 days | 123\n\n#### EU tells Meta it can't paywall privacy\n\nPlatforms should not confront users with 'binary choice' over personal data\nuse\n\nSecurity15 days | 73\n\n#### Senate passes law forcing ByteDance to sell off TikTok \u2013 or face a US ban\n\nUpdated Somewhere in Beijing, someone's screaming: Mother, PFACAA!\n\nPersonal Tech9 days | 88\n\n#### Easing the cloud migration journey\n\nHuawei\u2019s Net5.5G converged IP network can improve cloud performance,\nreliability and security, says the company\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Law prof predicts generative AI will die at the hands of watchdogs\n\nVideo Big tech backlash and animus against the machines will invite stifling\nred tape\n\nAI + ML9 days | 21\n\n#### Australia secures takedown order for terror videos, which Elon Musk wants\nto fight\n\n+Comment Yet X remains a supporter of The Christchurch Call, an international\nagreement to stop video nasties\n\nPersonal Tech10 days | 62\n\n#### Australia\u2019s spies and cops want \u2018accountable encryption\u2019 -
