But some Tesla owners discovered that they can\ntrick the system on hot, sunny days to get a little extra juice from a\nSupercharger station and save a few minutes during a top-up session. And\nbelieve it or not, it really seems to work.\n\nWith all the doom and gloom news about Tesla cutting deep into its workforce,\nincluding sacking the entire team responsible for the Supercharger network in\nthe United States, skepticism about the company\u2019s ability to maintain the high\ncharging standards is running high. But it's worth remembering that people\nlove those chargers for a reason, and hey, this lifehack may make them work\neven better.\n\n### Get Fully Charged\n\nThe Supercharger Situation\n\nTesla's Supercharger DC fast charging network is the largest and most reliable\nin the United States. It has over 2,000 stations across North America and the\ncompany consistently reported near-perfect uptime rates.\n\nThe wet towel trick has circulated on Tesla forums and other online\ncommunities for a few years now, but with summer coming in hot, we thought it\nwould be a good idea to make this little DIY solution more widely known.\n\nAs its name suggests, it implies putting a wet piece of cloth over the\ncharging cable handle. This is especially useful during a hot day when the sun\nshines directly on the handle, making its temperature rise. On older, V2\nSupercharger stalls that don\u2019t have actively cooled cables, the handle can get\nhot very quickly.\n\nAs a result, the sensor that\u2019s inside the handle tells the charger to lower\nthe charging speed so that a safe temperature can be maintained. But by\nputting a wet towel over the handle, it\u2019s shielded from the sun\u2019s light and\ncan stay at a lower temperature, thus facilitating a higher charging rate.\n\nMore Tesla Supercharging Stories\n\n'Detached From Reality': Welcome To The Tesla vs. $TSLA Showdown\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Supercharger Chaos Could Slow The EV Transition. But It Doesn\u2019t\nHave To.\n\nTesla's Supercharger Retreat Could 'Threaten' EV Transition: Analysts\n\n'Quality Is Going To Deteriorate': Laid-Off Tesla Employees On Superchargers'\nFuture\n\nOne Tesla owner documented that putting a damp cloth over the charging handle\nconvinced the V2 Supercharger to up the rate from 60 kilowatts to 95 kW during\na hot day. Meanwhile, our friends at Out of Spec Studios experienced an even\nbetter result.\n\nThey plugged in at a 2% state of charge and the Supercharger quickly ramped up\nto 147 kW, but then it thermal throttled to just 58 kW when the state of\ncharge reached 34%. Putting a wet rag at room temperature over the cable\nhandle convinced the stall to ramp back up to 119 kW.\n\n### Cookie Settings\n\nThis content is blocked by security settings.\n\nPlease click on button for showing it.\n\nOpen settings\n\nOn the newer, V3 stalls, this trick won\u2019t help at all on almost all of Tesla\u2019s\nEVs, except the Cybertruck. The angular pickup is the company\u2019s first\npassenger vehicle to feature an 800-volt battery setup (the others have a 400V\nsystem), but all the Supercharger stations that are currently online in the\nUnited States aren\u2019t capable of dispensing at 800V.\n\nAs a result, the electric pickup splits the battery pack into two 400V sub-\nunits, making the Superchargers ramp up the electrical current rate to over\n700 amps. This can make even the actively cooled V3 handle get hot, which is\nwhy the wet towel trick only works for Cybertruck owners who go to V3 stalls\nto top up their batteries.\n\n### Cookie Settings\n\nThis content is blocked by security settings.\n\nPlease click on button for showing it.\n\nOpen settings\n\nThat said, prolific EV driver Brandon Flasch said on X that he noticed a\nslight improvement in the charging curve while using the DIY trick on a Tesla\nModel S that was hooked up to a V3 DC fast charger, so it might come in handy\nfor other Tesla owners, too.\n\n### Cookie Settings\n\nThis content is blocked by security settings.\n\nPlease click on button for showing it.\n\nOpen settings\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that whatever the Supercharger version, this\nslightly unorthodox solution will only do so much to improve the charging\nexperience. The charging rate will still taper when the state of charge gets\ncloser to 100%, so it\u2019s no magic bullet.\n\n### Cookie Settings\n\nThis content is blocked by security settings.\n\nPlease click on button for showing it.\n\nOpen settings\n\nAs for the safety concerns that some owners threw into the online discussions\nthat popped up over the years, it shouldn\u2019t be too big of a problem. For\nstarters, Tesla\u2019s Superchargers are more than capable of working safely when\nit rains, so a damp cloth shouldn\u2019t do any harm.\n\nThen, the cars themselves can monitor the temperature of the charging pins, so\neven if the charging cable handle is \u201ctricked\u201d into believing it\u2019s cooler\noutside than it actually is, the car will still instruct the dispenser to slow\ndown the flow of current to keep everything safe.\n\nSo, what do you think?

WATER AND ELECTRICITY DO NOT MIX. EVER. DO NOT DO THIS!!!\n\nCypress 8 mai 2024, 01:45\n\nIt\u2019s not the water. It\u2019s the faking out the temp sensor.\n\nMy car charges in the rain all the time. I literally live in a temperature\nrainforest zone.\n\nFMimMI 7 mai 2024, 19:29\n\nSo you never charge when it rains? Or do you stand out there with an umbrella\nover your car?\n\nRadu Florea 7 mai 2024, 22:04\n\nI agree w/ the sentiment expressed by other commenters. It is the HEIGHT of\nirresponsibility to post this. Reducing the temperature seen by the\ntemperature sensor (which is supposed to keep the cable safe and below it's\nmax rated temperature) does nothing for the rest of the cable. You can end up\nwith a melted/shorted out charging cable and a potential fire and you can\nthank Iulian Dnistran for being so incompetent at their job to think that it's\nOK to post this. Unbelievable!\n\nBill Kerr 8 mai 2024, 00:45\n\nI came here to post the same. It is lunacy to tamper with a safety device on\nhigh power electrical systems. It is even more so to publish instructions on\nhow to do it. The temp sensor is there to protect you, your car, and the\ncharging equipment itself.\n\nModernMarvelFan 7 mai 2024, 23:58\n\nThe handle is often the hottest part.\n\nThe contact surface is often the largest \"choke point\" in connection where it\ngenerates the largest amount of heat.\n\ndrronc 7 mai 2024, 17:13\n\n45 years as EE/ME design engineer here... propagating this \"hack\" is totally\nirresponsible. Cooling the handle thermocouple by doing this does not \"fix the\nproblem\" that it's trying to alleviate... the SOURCE of the heat is the\nConnections... not the sun! Yes, you can cool the handle, but that does not\nget to the root-cause... the SOURCE of the heat. \"Lying\" to the charge station\nwill cause the connections to drastically over-heat... possibly causing the\ncharge handle connection-interface to melt, and/or the Car connector housing.\n\nModernMarvelFan 8 mai 2024, 00:01\n\nIf you are truly an EE, and a good legit one, then you would know if the\nhandle sensor is \"properly\" designed, then the method won't trick the sensor\nbut actually take away more handle from the handle than just simple dry\nhandle.\n\nFor an EE/ME, they would know that using this method will potentially suck\nmore heat out of the charging handle by lowering the surface temperature and\nincrease surface area which does cool the handle more.\n\nThis is no different than \"internal liquid cooling\", just happens to be\n\"external liquid cooling\".\n\nBenjamin D 7 mai 2024, 19:56\n\nCooling the handle allows the handle to move more heat away from the source,\nso I'd say it is a legitimate win. Even just getting it wet might be enough,\nsince the water can move heat more effectively than the air. The black handle\non a sunny day can get hot just from the sun, and I've seen this kind of\nfailure on my CHAdeMO adapter, as well. So maybe it isn't just a trick, it\nmight actually be solving the issue.\n\nJoin the conversation 29 Comments / 29 New\n\nGot a tip for us?
