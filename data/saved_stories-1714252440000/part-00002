Surprisingly, despite their age, they are still in pretty good\ncondition.\n\nThese trousers were likely custom-made by weaving three separate pieces of\ncloth \u2013 for the legs and crotch area \u2013 which were then sewn together using\nmatching thread.\n\nThe fabric also features intricate geometric designs woven directly into it,\ncreating a visually appealing and comfortable pair of pants.\n\nResearchers suggest that pants likely evolved among equestrian tribes in the\nregion around 4,000 years ago, providing both protection and comfort while\nriding horses.\n\nThe arid desert conditions surrounding the Yanghai tombs have played a crucial\nrole in preserving a variety of delicate textiles and fabrics.\n\nOther finds from the site include colorful sheepskin boots, feathered hats, a\nfringed skirt, and even a tiny loincloth.\n\n## Oldest Socks (1,600 years old)\n\nConsiderably younger than most items on this list, the world\u2019s oldest socks\nstill boast an impressive age, dating back to somewhere between 250 and 420\nAD.\n\nThese socks, believed to be Romano-Egyptian in origin, were unearthed in a\nburial ground located in an ancient Greek colony in central Egypt during the\nlate 1800s.\n\nDescribed by some as \u201calien socks\u201d or \u201clobster toes,\u201d these knitted wool socks\nare strikingly bright red and feature a unique split toe design.\n\nResearchers speculate that this split toe was intentional, allowing the wearer\nto comfortably wear the socks with sandals.\n\nThey are considered a rare example of a knitting technique known as\n\u201cN\u00e5lbindning,\u201d or single-needle knitting, which is a slow technique more akin\nto sewing than modern knitting.\n\nThese socks would have been started at the toe and gradually worked up to the\nankle.\n\n## Oldest dress (5,000 years old)\n\nOften hailed as the world\u2019s oldest known garment, the Tarkhan dress was\nunearthed in an ancient Egyptian cemetery located approximately 30 miles from\nCairo.\n\nDating back to the First Dynasty or Old Kingdom period, this dress (or tunic)\nis a testament to early textile craftsmanship, being made entirely of linen.\nIt boasts tightly pleated sleeves and a yoke sewn onto a skirt.\n\nResearchers have noted distinct creasing at the elbows and armpits, indicating\nthat the garment was indeed worn during the wearer\u2019s lifetime.\n\nInterestingly, the dress was discovered inside out, leading some to speculate\nthat it was intentionally placed in the tomb in this manner, possibly as a\nsymbolic or funerary gesture.\n\nDiscovered in 1913, the true significance of the find surrounding the tunic\nwas not fully realized until 1977.\n\nInitially, the tunic was part of a linen pile that had been excavated but was\nnot cleaned or thoroughly examined for over 60 years.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until conservators at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London\nmeticulously mounted the garment on a backing of fine silk that its full glory\ncould be appreciated, allowing it to be displayed as it would have been worn\nin life.\n\n## Oldest Footwear (9,300 years old)\n\nIn a discovery in Oregon\u2019s Fort Rock Basin in 1938, archaeologists uncovered\nthe world\u2019s oldest known pair of shoes, still intact and together.\n\nThese ancient footwear marvels, known as the Fort Rock Sandals, were crafted\nfrom twined sagebrush bark, featuring a flat sole and a toe wrap design.\n\nMultiple pairs of these sandals have been found, with the oldest believed to\nbe between 9,300 and 10,000 years old.\n\nResearchers speculate that the sandals were fastened by wrapping the thongs\naround the ankle and securing them on the opposite side.\n\n## Oldest Sweater (1,700 years old)\n\nBack in 2013, the world\u2019s oldest sweater was discovered on a Norwegian\nglacier, which seems like the perfect spot for such a cool find.\n\nThis old-school garment was crafted from lamb and sheep wool, woven into a\nfunky diamond twill fabric. It\u2019s got this cool greenish-brown color and a\nboatneck style, tailored for a guy around 5-foot-9.\n\nWhat\u2019s really neat is that this sweater\u2019s style was probably all the rage back\nin Iron Age Europe. It\u2019s pretty similar to another old piece found in a bog\nmore than 150 years ago.\n\nThe sweater seems to have been well-loved and well-maintained, as it shows\nsigns of having been patched twice.\n\nIt may also be one of the oldest surviving examples of upcycling \u2013 some\nresearchers believe it may have originally been a sleeveless tunic, with the\nsleeves added around the time of the second repair.\n\n## Oldest Bra (600 years old)\n\nFour linen brassieres adorned with lace were discovered among more than 2,700\ntextile fragments in the floor joists of Austria\u2019s Lemberg castle in 2008.\n\nResearchers estimate that these bras date back to sometime between 1390 and\n1485 when they were quaintly referred to as \u201cbreast bags.\u201d\n\nEach bra features distinct cups and shoulder straps, with two of them\nresembling a blend of a bra and a short shirt.\n\nThese hybrid pieces include a row of eyelets on the left side for lacing.\n\n## Oldest Purse (4,500 years old)\n\nIn 2012, archaeologists uncovered the world\u2019s oldest purse in a grave near\nLeipzig, Germany.\n\nThe purse, crafted from leather or fabric that has long disintegrated, was\nadorned with more than a hundred dog teeth from various animals.\n\nThe arrangement of the teeth resembles a modern handbag flap, suggesting a\nlevel of sophistication in its design.\n\nInterestingly, similar dog teeth adornments were also found in hair ornaments\nand necklaces, indicating a fashionable trend of the time.\n\nThe excavation site has yielded a variety of artifacts from Stone and Bronze\nAge settlements, including stone tools, bone buttons, and an amber necklace.\n\nResearchers also unearthed the grave of a woman buried around 50 BC, adorned\nwith approximately a pound of gold jewelry.\n\n## Oldest Sunglasses (2,000 years old)\n\nThe oldest snow goggles ever found, made of bone, leather, or wood, date back\n2,000 years to the Old Bering Sea culture, ancestors of the modern Inuit, who\nlived along Alaska\u2019s west coast.\n\nThese particular snow goggles, pictured above, were discovered some 800 years\nago on Canada\u2019s Baffin Island.\n\nThey were specifically crafted to shield the eyes from snow blindness caused\nby the intense spring sunlight.\n\n## Oldest Leather Shoe (5,500 years old)\n\nThe world\u2019s oldest leather shoe was found in southeastern Armenia\u2019s Areni-1\ncave in 2010.\n\nThis shoe, estimated to be around 5,500 years old, is a brown leather lace-up\ndesigned for a small right foot, roughly equivalent to a US size 7, indicating\nit was likely worn by a woman.\n\nCrafted from a single piece of leather, the shoe was tanned using vegetable\noil and carefully shaped to fit its wearer\u2019s foot.\n\nIt was also filled with grass, possibly for insulation or to maintain its\nshape when not in use.\n\n## Oldest Condom (370 years old)\n\nThis reusable condom, crafted from pig\u2019s intestine, was utilized in Lund,\nSweden, in 1640.\n\nIt was accompanied by instructions (in Latin) advising users to clean it with\nwarm milk to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n## Oldest Skirt (5,900 years old)\n\nThe skirt fragment was unearthed in the Areni-1 cave in southeastern Armenia.\n\nThough only a fragment remains, it provides enough evidence to suggest that\nthe fabric was crafted from woven reeds, featuring a counter-weave band along\nthe edge.\n\nIt is impossible to reconstruct the full appearance of the original skirt or\ndetermine whether it was worn by a woman or a man.\n\nNevertheless, researchers consider this discovery to be the oldest known\nexample of reed clothing in the world.\n\n## Oldest Crown (6,000 years old)\n\nThe crown was unearthed as part of the \u201cNahal Mishar Hoard,\u201d a collection of\nover 400 objects discovered in a cave in the Judean desert near the Dead Sea\nin 1961.\n\nDating back to the Copper Age (4000-3300 BC), this remarkable crown is crafted\nfrom blackened copper and measures approximately seven inches in diameter.\n\nThe crown\u2019s upper rim is adorned with five figures, including two long-necked\nbirds (thought to be vultures), two stylized gates or doors, and a T-shaped\nobject that resembles the hilt of a sword.\n\nIt was discovered alongside a scepter featuring horned animals, a copper woven\nbasket, and numerous clay bowls and goblets.\n\nResearchers aren\u2019t convinced the crown was worn by an actual king in the area\nthough \u2013 instead, they believe the crown was used in public ceremonies, and\nduring burial rites for important people.\n\n## Oldest Known Human-Made Fibers (34,000 years old)\n\nDuring excavations in a cave in the Republic of Georgia, a team of\narchaeologists made a remarkable discovery: the oldest fibers ever found,\ndating back more than 34,000 years.\n\nThese fibers, believed to be from wild flax, were likely not cultivated but\ngathered from the surrounding environment.\n\nEarly humans ingeniously used these fibers to create garments for warmth,\nstitching leather pieces together with the thread.\n\nThey also used the thread to tie packs, aiding in the transport of essentials\nand facilitating mobility between camps.\n\nOfer Bar-Yosef, the leader of the archaeology team from Harvard University\u2019s\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences, stated, \u201cWe know that this is wild flax that\ngrew in the vicinity of the cave and was intensively or extensively exploited\nby modern humans.\u201d\n\nSome of the fibers were twisted, indicating that early humans used them to\nmake ropes or strings. Moreover, evidence suggests that they dyed the fibers\nusing plants native to the area.\n\n(Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons / TopTenz.net / Britannica / Google Books).\n\nUpdated on: April 26, 2024\n\nAny factual error or typo?
