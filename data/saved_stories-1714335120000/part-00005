In this reality,\nevery word you utter depletes your life\u2019s savings.\n\nFrom the day you are born, you are given a set number, and it\u2019s the same as\neveryone else\u2019s. Just like a board game, it\u2019s up to you to choose how you use\nyour points.\n\nLet me ask you..\n\nHow would you use your words?\n\nHow would this shape the way you communicate, and how often you do?\n\nHow would you measure the importance of the words coming out of your mouth?\n\nWhen would you speak, when would you rather stay quiet?\n\nWell. That\u2019s the reality I used to live in for a few years when I was 6 years\nold.\n\nI don\u2019t remember why I came up with this, or where I heard it, but it was a\nknown fact. I lived within these parameters.\n\nI genuinely believed we were each given a set number of words for a lifetime.\nThat once used, that was it, I could not get them back.\n\nThis odd belief shaped the way I interacted with the world and the people\naround me. It made me a listener by default, teaching me the silent power of\nobservation.\n\nToday, I am still am impacted by this lesson.\n\nI still carry it into every conversation, negotiation, and interaction as an\nadult.\n\nIt turned into a life philosophy that I want to talk about today.\n\n## 1\\. The Culture of Noise\n\nThe world can\u2019t stop talking. Silence is mistaken for absence.\n\nThe hustle culture tricks you into thinking you always need to be busy and\nloud.\n\nThis is a pursuit that is relentless, disguised as ambition. It constantly\nwhispers that for you to be seen and to succeed, you must be the loudest, the\nfastest.\n\nMarketing campaigns like Nike's \"Just Do It\" pushes you to act without pause.\nIt\u2019s glorifying the grind above all else.\n\nThese slogans become mantras, they embed themselves into our culture. They\nurge you to keep moving, keep shouting, keep striving \u2014 at the expense of\nquiet reflection and the deep, meaningful progress it can bring.\n\nPlatforms like Instagram and TikTok have transformed how we view success and\nvisibility. Louder voices and rapid content creation mean greater achievement.\n\nThe fast pace of news cycles pressures you to remain perpetually informed and\nvocal.\n\nReality TV glorifies those who dominate the conversation. They promote the\nvalue of speed and volume deep within your cultural consciousness.\n\nThis shift is pushing society into a state of engagement. The noise of\nceaseless posting and sharing drowns out moments of quiet introspection.\n\nWorse yet\u2014you're told that silence is failure, that stillness is a step back.\n\nWhat cost does your voice pay in a race where everyone speaks but no one\nlistens?\n\nYou think: \"I must do more, speak up, stand out\".\n\nYou're trading depth for volume, mistaking the echo of your own voice for\nprogress.\n\nThis drive never stops. It pushes you to respond, react, and move forward.\nBut, it often comes at the expense of understanding, depth, and real\nconnection.\n\nWhat if this bias towards action is costing you more than you realize?\n\nWhat if your failure to listen and observe is the silent thief of innovation,\nempathy, and meaningful progress?\n\n## 2\\. Gaining Through Observance\n\nWhen you embrace the quiet power of observation, you unlock the potential for\nmore precise and impactful actions.\n\nSilence becomes your strategy. It enables you to gather data and understand\nthe world in a way that loudness never could.\n\nIt equips you with unparalleled advantages.\n\nObservation is a gift. It's like gathering free intelligence. Each piece of\ndata sharpens your decisions. It makes your moves not just calculated but more\nimpactful.\n\nThis is what\u2019s on the other side of loudness:\n\nStrategic Advantage: Real G\u2019s move in silence. Like the most skilled players\nin the game of life, you'll learn that the more you observe, the more precise\nyour actions become.\n\nEnhanced Communication: Listen more. You will speak a language everyone\ncraves: understanding. This not only boosts your communication skills but\nmakes every word you choose to speak more powerful. You also tune into\nnonverbal cues and understand the unspoken. Don\u2019t underestimate eye contact,\nfacial expressions, body language and tone of voice.\n\nDeeper Connections: People gravitate towards those who truly listen. By giving\nothers the floor,you give them the gift of being heard, fostering deeper and\nmore meaningful connections. This attentiveness makes people feel valued and\nunderstood. It naturally draws them closer to you.\n\nImproved Problem-Solving Skills: You're often the first to spot potential\nproblems \u2014 you pick up on subtle cues. This allows you to address issues\nbefore they escalate.\n\nBetter Decision-Making: Getting more info before deciding leads to better\noutcomes. It also leads to more effective ones.\n\nIncreased Creativity: Being observant makes you more likely to notice the\nbeauty and complexities of the world. This fuels creativity and innovation.\n\nGreater Self-Awareness: Recognizing behavior patterns allows for personal\ngrowth. It improves emotional intelligence, making you more adaptable and\nempathetic.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to take my word for it. Take it from the master of obvervation\nand quiet strategy himself: \u201cthe wolf in cashmere\u201d, aka Bernard Arnault.\n\nHe masterfully demonstrated the power of observance in the luxury goods market\nin the late 90\u2019s.\n\nIn two short years, he navigated the complexities of negotiations between\nLouis Vuitton and Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, and managed to play both sides effectively.\n\nHis strategic silence and keen observation allowed him to gain control. This\nled to the creation of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate. It\npropelled him to become one of the richest individuals globally.\n\n## 3\\. The Misconception of Quietness\n\nYou might be thinking \u201cBernard Arnaud is unrelatable. Plus, I need to be the\nAlpha male in the room, otherwise people will think I am weak.\u201d\n\nThey think you are weak?\n\nGood.\n\nLet them think that. That\u2019s how you play chess.\n\nBeing underestimated IS your greatest advantage.\n\nThe most effective leaders often operate under the radar, observing and\nplanning before making their move. Quietness allows you to\n\n  * Gather information\n\n  * Understand the dynamics at play\n\n  * Strike with precision when the time is right.\n\nTrue strength doesn't need constant validation through noise.\n\nQuiet confidence commands respect in a way that constant talking cannot. It's\nthe mark of someone who is secure in their abilities and doesn't need the\nspotlight to know their worth.\n\nWhile others are busy talking, you're absorbing, learning, and gaining\ninsights that they miss.\n\nListening gives you a deeper understanding of people and situations.\n\nIt makes you a more empathetic friend. A more astute businessperson. A more\neffective problem-solver.\n\nWhen you're quiet, people can't predict your next move. This gives you the\nelement of surprise.\n\nThis is a powerful tactic in both personal and professional realms. It allows\nyou to navigate situations with an advantage they never see coming.\n\nLet the world underestimate you.\n\nIt only amplifies the impact you'll make when you choose to speak with your\nactions and the carefully chosen words that follow.\n\n\"I know silent people, and they are disengaged and disinterested.\"\n\nYou think that silence signals disengagement?\n\nThink again.\n\nIn the world of communication, silence is often misinterpreted.\n\nWhen you are silent, you are not on the sidelines; you are deeply immersed in\nthe game.\n\nBeing silent is simply engaging differently.\n\nI was often called \u201cabsent from the conversation\u201d, when in fact I was:\n\n  * Actively listening and absorbing every word.\n\n  * Processing information, making connections they overlooked.\n\n  * Waiting for the moment my input can make the most significant impact.\n\nThe interactions are thoughtful, not impulsive.\n\nSo if you are still on the fence, embrace the silence.\n\nIt doesn't mute your impact\u2014it magnifies it. It ensures that when you do\nspeak, the world listens.\n\n## 4\\. Observations from the Quiet Corner\n\nNo strategy is perfect.\n\nIn observing my own childhood beliefs that led me to gravitate towards a world\nof observation, I must also admit that I went a little too far.\n\nI want to bring this up, because you might be on one side of the equation, or\nthe other. And it doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t adjust along the way.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nWhen I was convinced that humans had a limited quantity of speech, I took it\nto the extreme.\n\nI remember various times when that happened.\n\nAn example would be a disagreement in the car between my mom and my brother,\nfor which I had the answer to break the argument.\n\nI asked myself: Is this worth my words? The answer was no, and so I let them\nargue some more, and went on with my thoughts.\n\nObviously, at some point, I realized that this was not sustainable, nor was it\naccurate.\n\nBut after years of doing this, it shaped the way I saw and interacted with the\nworld.\n\nI choose my words carefully.\n\nI always listen and speak to a 90/10 ratio.\n\nI only talk when it\u2019s pertinent, or necessary.\n\nThe good:\n\nI always let people speak before me, whether in a group or with one on one. I\nusually have more information about their thoughts and intentions. They have\nless about me at any given point. This gives me leverage.\n\nI am pretty comfortable with silence. I use this tool for negotiations, sales.\n\nI gather data before making decisions. This applies to all areas of life.\n\nSome people shoot, then aim.\n\nOthers aim, the shoot.\n\nI aim, I take a deep breath to steady myself. I tune into the subtle signs\naround me. I notice the shift of the wind, the whisper of leaves, and the\nhidden trails in the underbrush. I align my focus.\n\nThen, I deliver a kill shot.\n\nThe not so good:\n\nThe fear of public speaking stemmed from my belief that every word I spoke had\nto carry weight. The more people there were listening, the more crucial it\nbecame for my words to resonate equally with everyone.\n\nThis amplifyed the pressure on each statement I made.\n\nEventually, this expectation I set for myself became overwhelming.\n\nIt led me to moments where I was simply paralyzed, unable to speak.\n\nTo sum it up, the self-imposed pressure created social anxiety.\n\nThere are two lesson I learned from this:\n\n  1. When you believe in something hard enough, it has the power to shift your reality. It changes who you are and how you act.\n\n  2. Fully committing in one direction means you\u2019re getting further from the other side. Duality is real, and sometimes, you need to adjust.\n\n## 5\\. Frameworks: Cultivating Observant Living\n\nEmbracing a lifestyle of observance doesn't mean you have to adopt silence as\na permanent state. The goal is for you to find a balance that enhances your\nperception, decision-making, and interactions.\n\nThere's a saying that my grandmother used to share:\n\n\"Tourne 7 fois la langue dans ta bouche avant de parler,\" which litteraly\ntranslates to \"turn your tongue in your mouth seven times before speaking.\"\n\nThis French proverb emphasizes the value of thoughtful communication.\n\nIt's about giving your words the weight they deserve, ensuring what you say\ntruly matters.\n\nNow, stepping into a room full of voices, you probably have an impulse to join\nthe chorus immediately. Here\u2019s a thought: try holding back; observe first.\n\nThe insight you gain from watching the others go first gives your words an\nedge.\n\nWhat comes out of your mouth will resonate more deeply because it's informed.\n\n### Sharpening Your Observational Skills: A Personal Guide\n\nSlow Down: Everything's super fast these days. Try hitting the pause button\nnow and then. Look around you, soak it all in. You'll be surprised at what\nyou've been missing.\n\nUse All Your Senses: Life is a multisensory experience. Remember to smell the\nrain, feel the texture of an old book, listen to the inflection in someone's\nvoice. It's about embracing the world in its entirety.\n\nStudy the Details: The smallest things can hold the greatest meanings. Pay\nattention to the nuances, the slight frowns, the hesitation before speaking.\nThese details tell a story louder than words.\n\nWrite It Down: Get a notebook. Use it to write down what you see, hear, feel.\nIt's not just about remembering things, but recognizing patterns in your life.\nIt's about the repeats and the changes.\n\nWatch and Listen: 70 to 93% of all communication is non verbal. There's a\nwhole world of meaning in how someone stands, the look in their eyes, or the\ntone of their voice. Start paying attention to these. Then, you'll get what\npeople are really saying, far beyond their words.\n\nDoing all this doesn't just make you more observant. It connects you more\ndeeply with life, with people, and yeah, with yourself too.\n\n## 6\\. The Quiet Revolution \u270a\n\nThe power of observation isn't just its strategic advantages in decision-\nmaking. It also adds depth to relationships.\n\nIt's about fostering a deeper connection with the world around us and with\nourselves.\n\nThis quiet revolution is a call to embrace the subtleties of life, to find\nstrength in silence.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with this.

You were just too busy and loud\nto notice them.\n\nRemember\u2014 you're not withdrawing from the world; you're engaging with it on a\ndeeper level.\n\nFriend, welcome to the quiet revolution.\n\nThat's all for today, thank you for reading.\n\nStrategizingly Yours,\n\nBen\n\nP.S.
