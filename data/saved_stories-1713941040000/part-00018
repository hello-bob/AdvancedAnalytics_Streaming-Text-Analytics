Just put the device you want to charge on\nthe wireless charger without worrying about plugging in a cable. Yet as it\nturns out, the disadvantages of wireless charging may be more severe than you\nthink, at least according to tests by iFixIt\u2019s [Shahram Mokhtari] and\ncolleagues. In the article the basics of wireless charging are covered, as\nwell as why wireless charging wastes a lot more power even when not charging,\nand why it may damage your device\u2019s battery faster than wired charging.\n\nThe inefficiency comes mostly from the extra steps needed to create the\nalternating current (AC) with wireless coupling between the coils, and the\nconversion back to DC. Yet it is compounded by the issue of misaligned coils,\nwhich further introduce inefficiencies. Though various protocols seek to fix\nthis (Qi2 and Apple\u2019s MagSafe) using alignment magnets, these manage to lose\n59% of the power drawn from the mains due to these inefficiencies. Wireless\nchargers also are forced to stay active, polling for a new device to charge,\nwhich keeps a MagSafe charger sucking up 0.2 W in standby.\n\nIf the losses from wired charging for a year come down to leaving a 10 W LED\nlamp on for eight hours total, wireless charging with MagSafe or Qi2 has you\nleaving that lamp on for 24 days straight. Since your phone is not a lamp,\nthis means that much of this wasted power is dissipated as heat, both on the\ntransmitting and receiving end. With the wireless receiving coil being placed\npractically on top of the battery in smartphones, this means that you are\nbumping the battery temperature up by about 8\u00b0C in the best scenario (fully\naligned MagSafe/Qi2) over wired charging, and a sustained 40+\u00b0C in the case of\na misaligned Qi charger, or the worst of all: the Tesla Charging Platform with\nits many overlapping coils.\n\nThus if plugging in a cable to connect a device is that much of a hassle, be\nsure to at the very least get a wireless charging solution that doesn\u2019t\nsimultaneously bump up your power bill and shorten the lifespan of the\ndevice\u2019s battery.\n\nPosted in Phone HacksTagged wireless charging\n\n## 70 thoughts on \u201cHow Wireless Charging Works And Why It\u2019s Terrible\u201d\n\n  1.

I\u2019ve migrated to using a 3d printed base on my old wireless\ncharger to properly center/locate my phone. Sadly, many chargers are tiny\nmedallions that you need to balance your phone on, so this 3d printed base\nalso served to better secure the phone as well. If you want to move away from\nwireless charging, I found a \u2018decent\u2019 alternative is to use magsafe usb\nchargers. Not the real thing of course, the cheap knock-offs for usb-micro and\nusb-C work decently well. If you are careful about the product you find/buy,\nthen you can use the same cord for apple/micro/USB-C items as long as you have\nthe appropriate \u2018nub\u2019 in the device to accept the cord.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    2. andrewjhull says:\n\nApril 22, 2024 at 9:14 am\n\nI have a box full of old phone chargers for various obsolete connectors.

There are a handful of oddball variants like Micro-A, Micro-B 3.0, and\nthe very rare Mini-A and related Mini-AB receptacle. And the relatively nicely\ndesigned Apple Lightning is on its way out.\n\nOne nice thing about USB is that you can often connect one type to another\nwith the right passive adapter. And in this day an age, microcontrollers are\nfast enough to bit bang old interfaces. So now something relatively affordable\nlike a Teensy can talk old variants of SCSI, Shugart-like floppy interfaces,\nSony CDU-535 CD-ROM interface, and old keyboards. (I\u2019m using a\nmicrocontroller-based PC/XT to USB adapter).\n\nI suspect in decades in the future someone will have an adapter to connect to\nobsolete technology. Such as DVI, USB 1.2, and even twisted pair Ethernet (a\nfew pairs of copper has an upper limit on performance).\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n          1.

It can be\nconvenient, and I\u2019m willing to accept the power loss being that in the grand\u2019s\ngame of things it\u2019s a very small amount. The issue I have with wireless\ncharging a phone, is that my current phone, and the manufacturer\u2019s supplied\ncharging base have no alignment mechanism whatsoever. Which means it\u2019s not\nreally much more convenient than plugging in, and tends to be even more\ninefficient than it needs to be. The other big issue I have is people are now\npushing for wireless charging for things like cars. And there it is a horrible\nidea. Even if you manage the efficiency that cell phones get, that is an\nincredible amount of wasted power when you were talking the scale of a\nvehicle, but there\u2019s no way you\u2019re even going to get to that efficiency\nconsidering that you have several inches of air gap to deal with, and likely\neven worse alignment than cell phones. So yes, I want to keep wireless\ncharging for cell phones, but no I don\u2019t want my car to charge that way!\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  11.

Much better than yesteryear,\nwhen these things sucked a watt or more each while standing by.\n\n\u201cIf the losses from wired charging for a year come down to leaving a 10 W LED\nlamp on for eight hours total, wireless charging with MagSafe or Qi2 has you\nleaving that lamp on for 24 days straight. \u201d A mystifying mishmash of units\nand confusing analogies. What does a lamp have to do with it? Why not just say\n\u201c80 watt-hours\u201d and \u201c5760 watt-hours\u201d?\n\nAnd where does the former number (10 watts for eight hours) come from anyway?\nIf that\u2019s the purported quiescent draw from a wall-wart on standby, that\u2019s an\nincredible (literally, \u201cnot believable\u201d) number: less than 10 milliwatts\naverage power. Are there *any* plug-in power supplies that draw that little\npower?\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. Chris Dotson says:\n\nApril 22, 2024 at 8:30 pm\n\nThe concern over wireless charging really seems to be a case of false economy\nand bad math.\n\nThe additional electricity is something like $0.50 per year per phone. Sure,\nthere are a lot of phones, but (even ignoring the convenience factor) if this\nprevents a phone from being discarded due to a broken charging/data port,\nyou\u2019ve avoided a cost 1000-2000x as large. Priorities, people.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  12. George White says:\n\nApril 22, 2024 at 4:00 pm\n\nI have an outlet near the kitchen counter, it has a power strip plugged into\nit. Into that power strip are the following chargers: ICOM IC-92AD charger, 2\nSamsung phones. When I\u2019m not charging, the power strip is off. Granted,\nplugging and unplugging the cables can be a pain, but I baby the connectors,\nand they\u2019re like new. I\u2019m hoping USB-C stays the standard as changing\nconnector formats really is getting to be tiresome. Of course, being a ham\noperator, I do like to be prepared with an extra battery for the HT etc.\nUnfortunately, a lot of the more modern phones don\u2019t have a battery that is\neasily replaceable. Batteries Plus can do it at a cost, but i had a Motorola\nRazr flip phone that I had to replace the battery. I would still be using that\nphone today, but had to upgrade to a smart phone because Verizon was no longer\nsupporting the 3G network. Forced obsolescence. I\u2019ve seen youtube videos of\nelectronics and phones that are still in perfect working order trashed because\nthey\u2019re no longer supported. Nowadays, people use their phones for taking\npictures, email etc. I guess I\u2019m a bit of a Luddite because I use my phone\nfor....I dunno, just making and receiving phone calls? No banking, browsing\netc. I had the same computer for 20 years before it\u2019s motherboard failed. Is\nthe new computer faster etc.? Yes it is, but I still miss the old system.\nSometimes change is good, but like I said, I\u2019m a ham operator and can\u2019t stand\nto see perfectly good working equipment trashed.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  13.

Foldi-One says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 12:56 am\n\nBecause the best solar can manage efficiency wise isn\u2019t very good and the\ncosts involved relatively high. That \u2018light table\u2019 of yours would have to be\npretty darn dazzling to charge a phone at a reasonable rate, and would come\nwith all the same if not more unwanted heat on the delicate battery than the\nwireless charging coils.\n\nAt least for now phones are so power hungry that just isn\u2019t practical, things\nlike TV remotes, calculators and maybe even your portable Bluetooth audio\ndevices might really gain enough to be worth it \u2013 the sort of stuff that\nusually at least is one or more of low power draw, large(ish), or low on time.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    2. Greg A says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 11:32 am\n\nnot coincidentally, it has the exact same problem as the RF optical charging\ndescribed in this article (RF, IR, visible, ultraviolet, it\u2019s just a\ndifference in wavelength). it isn\u2019t very efficient and the inefficiency\nmanifests specifically as heat directed at a heat-sensitive component (the\nbattery). if you\u2019re willing to accept those downsides, i think the RF\nwavelengths are easier to make efficient.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  14. Bob the builder says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 3:21 am\n\n\u201cHOW WIRELESS CHARGING WORKS AND WHY IT\u2019S TERRIBLE\u201d\n\nReality: It\u2019s great. It\u2019s easy to use, stops you from destroying USB ports,\nlengthening the lifespan of the phone, is a great way to make sure that your\nphone is charged, the power usage is so little it\u2019s not even worth mentioning.\n+\n\nMy previous phones all went the way of the dodo because of the USB plug.\nChanging it on a waterproof device can be rather tricky and I ended up\nditching the phones instead. My current phone is now 3 years old and works\njust as well as when it was new. I use wireless charging every day and it\u2019s\nthe reason I can still use the phone in the first place.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.\n(Comment Policy)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
