The curvature of the crystal array stops\nthe light waves in the crystal from moving. Credit: AMOLF\n\nAMOLF researchers, in collaboration with Delft University of Technology, have\nsucceeded in bringing light waves to a halt by deforming the two-dimensional\nphotonic crystal that contains them. The researchers show that even a subtle\ndeformation can have a substantial effect on photons in the crystal. This\nresembles the effect that a magnetic field has on electrons.\n\n\"This principle offers a new approach to slow down light fields and thereby\nenhance their strength. Realizing this on a chip is particularly important for\nmany applications,\" says AMOLF-group leader Ewold Verhagen.\n\nThe researchers have published their findings in the journal Nature Photonics.\nSimultaneously, a research team from Pennsylvania State University has\npublished an article in the same journal about how they\ndemonstrated\u2014independently from the Dutch team\u2014an identical effect.\n\nManipulating the flow of light in a material at small scales is beneficial for\nthe development of nanophotonic chips. For electrons, such manipulation can be\nrealized using magnetic fields; the Lorentz force steers the motion of\nelectrons. However, this is impossible for photons because they do not have\ncharge.\n\nResearchers in the Photonic Forces group at AMOLF are looking for techniques\nand materials that would enable them to apply forces to photons that resemble\nthe effects of magnetic fields.\n\n## Electrons\n\n\"We looked for inspiration at the way in which electrons behave in materials.\nIn a conductor, electrons can in principle move freely, but an external\nmagnetic field can stop this. The circular movement caused by the magnetic\nfield stops conduction and as such electrons can only exist in the material if\nthey have very specific energies. These energy levels are called Landau\nlevels, and they are characteristic for electrons in a magnetic field,\" says\nVerhagen.\n\n\"But, in the two-dimensional material graphene\u2014that consists of a single layer\nof carbon atoms arranged in a crystal\u2014these Landau levels can also be caused\nby a different mechanism than a magnetic field. In general, graphene is a good\nelectronic conductor, but this changes when the crystal array is deformed, for\ninstance by stretching it like elastics.\n\n\"Such mechanical deformation stops conduction; the material turns into an\ninsulator and consequently the electrons are bound to Landau levels. Hence,\nthe deformation of graphene has a similar effect on electrons in a material as\na magnetic field, even without a magnet. We asked ourselves if a similar\napproach would also work for photons.\"\n\n## Photonic crystal\n\nIn a collaboration with Kobus Kuipers of Delft University of Technology, the\ngroup of Verhagen indeed demonstrated a similar effect for light in a photonic\ncrystal.\n\n\"A photonic crystal normally consists of a regular\u2014two dimensional\u2014pattern of\nholes in a silicon layer. Light can move freely in this material, just like\nelectrons in graphene,\" says first author Ren\u00e9 Barczyk who successfully\ndefended his Ph.D. thesis on this topic in 2023. \"Breaking this regularity in\nexactly the right manner will deform the array and consequently lock the\nphotons. This is how we create Landau levels for photons.\"\n\nIn Landau levels light waves no longer move; they do not flow through the\ncrystal but stand still. The researchers succeeded in demonstrating this,\nshowing that the deformation of the crystal array has a similar effect on\nphotons as a magnetic field on electrons.\n\nVerhagen says, \"By playing with the deformation pattern, we even managed to\nestablish various types of effective magnetic fields in one material. As a\nresult, photons can move through certain parts of the material but not in\nothers. Hence, these insights also provide new ways to steer light on a chip.\"\n\n## Simultaneous experiments\n\nThe work of Verhagen and his team was inspired by theoretical predictions of\nresearchers at Pennsylvania State University and Columbia University. Verhagen\nrecalls, \"When we were doing our first measurements, I happened to speak to\none of the authors of this other study. When it turned out that they were also\nlooking for experimental evidence of the effect, we decided not to compete in\nbeing first to publish but instead to submit the work simultaneously to the\npublisher.\"\n\nWhile some details in the approach differed, both teams were able to stop\nlight waves from moving and observe Landau levels by deforming a two-\ndimensional photonic crystal.\n\n\"This brings on-chip applications closer,\" says Verhagen. \"If we can confine\nlight at the nanoscale and bring it to a halt like this, its strength will be\nenhanced tremendously. And not only at one location, but over the entire\ncrystal surface. Such light concentration is very important in nanophotonic\ndevices, for example for the development of efficient lasers or quantum light\nsources.\"\n\nMore information: Ren\u00e9 Barczyk et al, Observation of Landau levels and chiral\nedge states in photonic crystals through pseudomagnetic fields induced by\nsynthetic strain, Nature Photonics (2024).
