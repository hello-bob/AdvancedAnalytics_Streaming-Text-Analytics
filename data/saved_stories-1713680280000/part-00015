Take for instance Mr. Bennett, the patriarch in Pride and\nPrejudice, whose \u00a32,000 a year makes him amongst the wealthier members of the\ngentry. With that sum, he can comfortably maintain a large household, with a\nfull complement of servants and carriages. On the other hand, he is no Mr.\nDarcy, who with his \u00a310,000 a year has an immense manor house and accompanying\ngrounds.\n\nThis attention paid to money accelerated as Romanticism gave way in the mid\n19th century to Realism. In Balzac\u2019s Lost Illusions, a man from the provinces\nsees exactly how the machinery of the arts world works to create celebrated\nauthors. As late as 1891, we have a protagonist in George Gissing\u2019s New Grub\nStreet plotting how he\u2019ll use his small inheritance to secure literary\nstardom.\n\nBut after World War I, writers started to use a kind of code. Look at, say,\nThe Sun Also Rises. We know that Brett Ashley, Jake Barnes, and Robert Cohn\nall travel in the same social circles, but we\u2019ve much less idea of their\nrelative means. In an aside within Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the\nFrench economist Thomas Piketty theorized that the high inflation of the post-\nwar period is what led writers to stop using dollar amounts in their\nfiction\u2014but I would say this increasing vagueness is about more than amounts,\nit\u2019s also about our understanding of what\u2019s at stake for characters and of\nwhat their futures hold. Money forms a backdrop to The Sun Also Rises, but\nit\u2019s pretty light on the specifics of how much of it each character has.\n\nJake presumably has no money, as he must work as a journalist (a low-class\noccupation), but he knows Cohn from Princeton. Lady Brett Ashley alludes to\nhaving married money, but in a 19th-century novel we would understand her\nprecise financial situation, while in The Sun Also Rises these form no part of\nthe plot. We understand that these people belong to some sort of demimonde,\nwhere the classes mix, but we\u2019re given much less information about their money\nwoes and worries than we would\u2019ve had even thirty years earlier.\n\nThis vagueness becomes an endemic part of Anglophone letters after WWII, as\nnovels develop an intensely interior quality that divorces them from the world\nof money and manners. Take the work of Donna Tartt. Her scholarship boy in the\nThe Secret History is debauched through his association with the upper-class\nkids at pseudo-Bennington, but none of the characters are particularly legible\nin terms of their income. Their falling-out with Bunny, who has social class\nbut not status, is particularly perplexing: if they\u2019re truly upper-class and\nmoneyed, they ought to be alert to the existence of poor cousins. Their\nsensitivity to being sponged off seems a bit declasse and at odds with the way\nthey\u2019re portrayed. These kids are rich New Englanders, but they have a kind of\nstatus anxiety\u2014a fear of being poor and being seen as poor\u2014that\u2019s at odds with\nthe rest of their old-money portrayal.\n\nI think this lack of clarity about money arises because the stories literary\nauthors want to tell are fundamentally upper-middle and upper-class stories.\n\nThe Secret History at least attempts to discuss money. Most modern novels\nelide the subject entirely, even when it\u2019s seemingly quite relevant. Take Ben\nLerner\u2019s Leaving Atocha Station. He\u2019s in Spain on a Fulbright, but I know,\nfrom my friends who\u2019ve done Fulbrights, that the stipend isn\u2019t particularly\ngenerous: between about $2,000 and $3,000 a month, give or take. If you\u2019re a\nstudent in Madrid on a Fulbright and you have other money coming in and you\ndon\u2019t have outstanding student loans, your life is very different than if\nyou\u2019re relying on that stipend to make ends meet. But in the case of Lerner\u2019s\nprotagonist, we simply don\u2019t know, even though the novel is intensely\nconcerned with whether or not the protagonist should pursue some kind of\nfuture in the arts (a decision that surely has money implications).\n\nThe same is true for Adelle Waldman\u2019s The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P. We know\nthat he lives alone, and that studio apartments in Brooklyn cost, what, $2,000\na month in 2013? Somewhere in that ballpark. He got a big book advance, and\nhe\u2019s dating a newspaper reporter in her thirties. When I was in my thirties,\ndating women with real jobs, living off a big book advance, the constant\nsubtext was, \u201cWill this last? Will you be able to support a family?\u201d But in\nNathaniel P it\u2019s not a major conflict.\n\nA similar issue dogs Detransition, Baby, whose intricate comedy of manners is\nmarred by the complete economic illegibility of one of its main characters:\nAmes works an upper-middle-class office job, but we\u2019ve no idea if he has debt\nand can\u2019t guess his salary to within even an order of magnitude. When he and\nhis pregnant boss, Katrina, consider entering into a co-parenting relationship\nwith his ex-girlfriend, Reese, the obvious question never comes up: since she\nearns the least amount of money and isn\u2019t particularly career-oriented, will\nReese stay home with the child? If so, how we will she be compensated? If she\nisn\u2019t going to take care of the child, then what will their childcare\nsituation be, and how can they afford childcare while maintaining three\nseparate child-ready households in New York City?\n\nWhat is the reason for this increasing vagueness? One possibility is that\nmodern people simply aren\u2019t as legible, in financial terms, as people in the\npast. In Jane Austen\u2019s day, the size of a man\u2019s income was a source of open\ndiscussion\u2014this is no longer the case.\n\nIt could certainly be the case that in modern America we simply do not notice\nhow much money a person has, or how much they\u2019re likely to come into. But this\nflies in the face of my own and, I think, most people\u2019s experience of daily\nlife. Because the truth is that while we don\u2019t openly discuss how much money\npeople have, we certainly spend a lot of time thinking about it.\n\nFor instance, a friend once told me the easiest way to know if a college-\neducated person has rich parents is to ask if they have student loans. Does\nthe MC in Leaving Atocha Station have student loans? Does Bunny in The Secret\nHistory have student loans? Which characters in Nathaniel P have student\nloans? This is a simple and extremely legible financial marker that one would\nexpect to appear routinely in novels, but it doesn\u2019t.\n\nIn Jane Austen\u2019s day, the size of a man\u2019s income was a source of open\ndiscussion\u2014this is no longer the case.\n\nWhen I wrote on this topic previously for Lit Hub a commenter said these\nlacunae were a result of the meritocracy\u2014modern novelists are very concerned\nwith creating the image that they succeeded through their own efforts, because\nof the way that America idealizes self-made people.\n\nI don\u2019t disagree that novelists have an interest in mythologizing their own\norigins\u2014I simply don\u2019t see why this ought to affect the content of their\nnovels. An author can be honest in their own books even as they disguise their\nown origins in interviews\u2014I\u2019m being conspicuously clear and honest in this\narticle, even as I studiously avoid discussing my own financial background,\nfor instance.\n\nI think this lack of clarity about money arises because the stories literary\nauthors want to tell are fundamentally upper-middle and upper-class stories.\nIf Ben Lerner\u2019s protag has student loans, then he is right to worry about\nwhether poetry or art are really life-sustaining endeavors. Similarly, if\nNathaniel P can\u2019t ever support a family, then he is right to eschew commitment\nwith the upper-middle-class mid-thirties professional women that he tends to\ndate. If these protagonists aren\u2019t well off, then the authors have no business\ntelling these particular stories about them. Thus, the logic of the books\ndemands that they have some kind of financial privilege\u2014so why elide that\nprivilege from the text?\n\nFor whatever reason, authors of literary fiction seem very invested in\ncreating dramas of the meritocracy: stories about the internal, emotional\nturmoil of talented people who, it is assumed, deserve all their current or\nfuture success. I can only assume this is because in the 21st century there is\nsome market for these dramas in a way there was not in the 19th-century. And\nbecause to write about money honestly would inevitably puncture the illusion\nthat it plays no role in contemporary life, authors find ways of gliding over\nthe parts of the book where money would naturally come up.\n\nOne could imagine that a majority of readers\u2014a middle-class, let\u2019s call\nthem\u2014is asking for these stories, perhaps because they want to be reassured\nthat the world is fair. But the middle-class also loves TV shows and movies\nabout useless and undeserving people, whether it\u2019s the Real Housewives,\nSuccession, Gossip Girl, or any of literally hundreds of other examples. If\nanything, the middle-class seems to want to be reassured that the Nathaniel Ps\nof the world are actually feckless and undeserving rich kids.\n\nPerhaps it is the upper- and upper-middle-class itself that desires these\ndramas. They want to read about self-determining individuals who are stymied\nonly by their own internal conflict. But I\u2019m a member of this class myself,\nand I can\u2019t see why we should want such a thing when in our daily lives we are\nso aware that this is simply not how the world works.\n\nIt is suggestive that it\u2019s in literary fiction where money-talk is the most\ntaboo. Commercial novels frequently touch on money and occupation\u2014it\u2019s a main\ndriver of conflict in romance and crime novels in particular. But literary\nfiction is largely removed from mass opinion and is shaped by a small number\nof critics, editors, and agents, mostly from elite backgrounds themselves.\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that part of the class replication strategy for upper-\nand upper-middle-class literati involves suppressing mention of money in\nliterature. If so, I can only lament the harm this suppression does to the\nwork in question.\n\nI\u2019m not particularly moved by considerations of fairness\u2014most literary writers\ncome from privileged backgrounds. That\u2019s true today, and it was true in\nAusten\u2019s time as well, and I don\u2019t see it ever changing (even in the Soviet\nUnion, it was rare for a successful writer to be from a peasant or proletarian\nbackground). But I do think this silence about money seriously harms the work\non an artistic level.\n\nLeaving Atocha Station, The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P, and Detransition,\nBaby are amongst the best and most honest novels of the last decade, and yet\nthese stories are seriously compromised by silence about money. In the attempt\nto have it both ways\u2014to tell stories about moneyed people without mentioning\nmoney itself\u2014the authors end up writing tales that don\u2019t make any\npsychological sense. Characters become hysterical over subjects that seem not\nto merit worry, and they don\u2019t worry about things that ought to be of great\nconcern.\n\nMoney can\u2019t be expunged from the text, it can only be repressed, and in being\nrepressed, these novels become the site of a neurosis that can be endlessly\ndiscussed but never quite explained.\n\nAdelle WaldmanBen LernerclassJane Austenliterary criticismmoneyNaomi\nKanakiaThe Myth of the Middle Class WriterTorrey Peterswealth\n\nShare:\n\n  * Share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n  * More\n\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n###### Naomi Kanakia\n\nNaomi Kanakia is the author of three YA novels (HarperTeen and Little, Brown),\nliterary short stories (Gulf Coast, American Short Fiction), science fiction\nstories (Analog, Asimov's, F&SF), poetry (Cherry Tree, Storm Cellar), literary\ncriticism (The Chronicle Review, Los Angeles Review of Books), and a self-\npublished cynical guide to the publishing industry.
