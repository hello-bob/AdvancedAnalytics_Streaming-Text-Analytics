Zoom in far enough on a patch of space, the\ntheory says, and you won\u2019t see a menagerie of particles or jittery quantum\nfields. There will only be identical strands of energy, vibrating and merging\nand separating. By the late 1980s, physicists found that these \u201cstrings\u201d can\ncavort in just a handful of ways, raising the tantalizing possibility that\nphysicists could trace the path from dancing strings to the elementary\nparticles of our world. The deepest rumblings of the strings would produce\ngravitons, hypothetical particles believed to form the gravitational fabric of\nspace-time. Other vibrations would give rise to electrons, quarks and\nneutrinos. String theory was dubbed a \u201ctheory of everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople thought it was just a matter of time until you could compute\neverything there was to know,\u201d said Anthony Ashmore, a string theorist at\nSorbonne University in Paris.\n\nBut as physicists studied string theory, they uncovered a hideous complexity.\n\nWhen they zoomed out from the austere world of strings, every step toward our\nrich world of particles and forces introduced an exploding number of\npossibilities. For mathematical consistency, strings need to wriggle through\n10-dimensional space-time. But our world has four dimensions (three of space\nand one of time), leading string theorists to conclude that the missing six\ndimensions are tiny \u2014 coiled into microscopic shapes resembling loofahs. These\nimperceptible 6D shapes come in trillions upon trillions of varieties. On\nthose loofahs, strings merge into the familiar ripples of quantum fields, and\nthe formation of these fields could also come about in multitudinous ways. Our\nuniverse, then, would consist of the aspects of the fields that spill out from\nthe loofahs into our giant four-dimensional world.\n\nString theorists sought to determine whether the loofahs and fields of string\ntheory can underlie the portfolio of elementary particles found in the real\nuniverse. But not only are there an overwhelming number of possibilities to\nconsider \u2014 10^500 especially plausible microscopic configurations, according\nto one tally \u2014 no one could figure out how to zoom out from a specific\nconfiguration of dimensions and strings to see what macroworld of particles\nwould emerge.\n\n\u201cDoes string theory make unique predictions? Is it really physics? The jury is\njust still out,\u201d said Lara Anderson, a physicist at Virginia Tech who has\nspent much of her career trying to link strings with particles.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nLara Anderson, a physicist at Virgina Tech, helped develop machine learning\nalgorithms to approximate the shapes of Calabi-Yau manifolds.\n\nLaura Schaposnik\n\n## Introduction\n\nNow, a fresh generation of researchers has brought a new tool to bear on the\nold problem: neural networks, the computer programs powering advances in\nartificial intelligence. In recent months, two teams of physicists and\ncomputer scientists have used neural networks to calculate precisely for the\nfirst time what sort of macroscopic world would emerge from a specific\nmicroscopic world of strings. This long-sought milestone reinvigorates a quest\nthat largely stalled decades ago: the effort to determine whether string\ntheory can actually describe our world.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t at the point of saying these are the rules for our universe,\u201d\nAnderson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a big step in the right direction.\u201d\n\n## The Twisted World of Strings\n\nThe crucial feature that determines what macroworld emerges from string theory\nis the arrangement of the six small spatial dimensions.\n\nThe simplest such arrangements are intricate 6D shapes called Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds \u2014 the objects that resemble loofahs. Named after the late Eugenio\nCalabi, the mathematician who conjectured their existence in the 1950s, and\nShing-Tung Yau, who in the 1970s set out to prove Calabi wrong but ended up\ndoing the opposite, Calabi-Yau manifolds are 6D spaces with two\ncharacteristics that make them attractive to physicists.\n\nFirst, they can host quantum fields with a symmetry known as supersymmetry,\nand supersymmetric fields are much simpler to study than more irregular\nfields. Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider have shown that the\nmacroscopic laws of physics are not supersymmetric. But the nature of the\nmicroworld beyond the Standard Model remains unknown. Most string theorists\nwork under the assumption that the universe at that scale is supersymmetric,\nwith some citing physical motivations for believing so while others do so out\nof mathematical necessity.\n\nSecond, Calabi-Yau manifolds are \u201cRicci-flat.\u201d According to Albert Einstein\u2019s\ngeneral theory of relativity, the presence of matter or energy bends space-\ntime, causing so-called Ricci curvature. Calabi-Yau manifolds lack this kind\nof curvature, though they can (and do) curve in other ways unrelated to their\nmatter and energy contents. To understand Ricci flatness, consider a doughnut,\nwhich is a low-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold. You can unroll a doughnut and\nrepresent it on a flat screen on which moving off the right side teleports you\nto the left side and likewise with top and bottom.\n\nSix-dimensional shapes called Calabi-Yau manifolds (3D slices of which are\nshown here) come in increasingly complicated varieties. In string theory, a\nmicroscopic manifold lies at every point in our 4D universe and determines the\nlaws of physics we experience.\n\nO. Knill and E. Slavkovsky\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe general game plan for string theory, then, boils down to searching for the\nspecific manifold that would describe the microstructure of space-time in our\nuniverse. One way to search is by picking a plausible 6D doughnut and working\nout whether it matches the particles we see.\n\nThe first step is to work out the right class of 6D doughnuts. Countable\nfeatures of Calabi-Yau manifolds, such as the number of holes they have,\ndetermine the countable features of our world, such as how many distinct\nmatter particles exist. (Our universe has 12.) So researchers start by\nsearching for Calabi-Yau manifolds with the right assortment of countable\nfeatures to explain the known particles.\n\nResearchers have made steady progress on this step, and over the last couple\nof years a United Kingdom-based collaboration in particular has refined the\nart of doughnut selection to a science. Using insight gathered from an\nassortment of computational techniques in 2019 and 2020, the group identified\na handful of formulas that spit out classes of Calabi-Yau manifolds producing\nwhat they call \u201cbroad brush\u201d versions of the Standard Model containing the\nright number of matter particles. These theories tend to produce long-distance\nforces we don\u2019t see. Still, with these tools, the U.K. physicists have mostly\nautomated what were once daunting calculations.\n\n\u201cThe efficacy of these methods is absolutely staggering,\u201d said Andrei\nConstantin, a physicist at the University of Oxford who led the discovery of\nthe formulas. These formulas \u201creduce the time needed for the analysis of\nstring theory models from several months of computational efforts to a split\nsecond.\u201d\n\nThe second step is harder. String theorists aim to narrow the search beyond\nthe class of Calabi-Yaus and identify one particular manifold. They seek to\nspecify exactly how big it is and the precise location of every curve and\ndimple. These geometric details are supposed to determine all the remaining\nfeatures of the macroworld, including precisely how strongly particles\ninteract and exactly what their masses are.\n\nCompleting this second step requires knowing the manifold\u2019s metric \u2014 a\nfunction that can take in any two points on the shape and tell you the\ndistance between them. A familiar metric is the Pythagorean theorem, which\nencodes the geometry of a 2D plane. But as you move to higher-dimensional,\ncurvy space-times, metrics become richer and more complicated descriptions of\nthe geometry. Physicists solved Einstein\u2019s equations to get the metric for a\nsingle rotating black hole in our 4D world, but 6D spaces have been out of\ntheir league. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the saddest things as a physicist that you come\nacross,\u201d said Toby Wiseman, a physicist at Imperial College London.\n\u201cMathematics, clever as it is, is quite limited when it comes to actually\nwriting down solutions to equations.\u201d\n\nEugenio Calabi (right) conjectured the existence of shapes with a certain type\nof symmetry and mathematical flatness. Shing-Tung Yau (left) set out to prove\nhim wrong, but discovered he was right. Today these shapes, known as Calabi-\nYau manifolds, play a crucial role in string theory.\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Dars\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs a postdoc at Harvard University in the early 2000s, Wiseman heard whispers\nof the \u201cmythical\u201d metrics of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Yau\u2019s proof that these\nfunctions exist helped win him the Fields Medal (the top prize in\nmathematics), but no one had ever calculated one. At the time, Wiseman was\nusing computers to approximate the metric of space-times surrounding exotic\nblack holes. Perhaps, he speculated, computers could also solve for the\nmetrics of Calabi-Yau space-times.\n\n\u201cEveryone said, \u2018Oh, no, you couldn\u2019t possibly do that,\u2019\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cSo me\nand a brilliant guy, Matthew Headrick, a string theorist, we sat down and\nshowed it could be done.\u201d\n\n## Pixelated Manifolds\n\nWiseman and Headrick (who works at Brandeis University) knew that a Calabi-Yau\nmetric had to solve Einstein\u2019s equations for empty space. A metric satisfying\nthis condition guaranteed that a space-time was Ricci-flat. Wiseman and\nHeadrick picked four dimensions as a proving ground. Leveraging a numerical\ntechnique sometimes taught in high school calculus classes, they showed in\n2005 that a 4D Calabi-Yau metric could indeed be approximated. It might not be\nperfectly flat at every point, but it came extremely close, like a doughnut\nwith a few imperceptible dents.\n\nI thought, if [a neural network] can outperform the world champion in Go,\nmaybe it can outperform mathematicians, or at least physicists like me.\n\nFabian Ruehle\n\nAround the same time, Simon Donaldson, a prominent mathematician also at\nImperial, was also studying Calabi-Yau metrics for mathematical reasons, and\nhe soon worked up another algorithm for approximating metrics. String\ntheorists including Anderson started trying to calculate specific metrics in\nthese ways, but the procedures took a long time and produced overly bumpy\ndoughnuts, which would mess up attempts to make precise particle predictions.\n\nAttempts to complete step 2 died out for nearly a decade. But as researchers\nfocused on step 1 and on solving other problems in string theory, a powerful\nnew technology for approximating functions swept computer science \u2014 neural\nnetworks, which adjust huge grids of numbers until their values can stand in\nfor some unknown function.\n\nNeural networks found functions that could identify objects in images,\ntranslate speech into other languages, and even master humanity\u2019s most\ncomplicated board games. When researchers at the artificial intelligence\ncompany DeepMind created the AlphaGo algorithm, which in 2016 bested a top\nhuman Go player, the physicist Fabian Ruehle took notice.\n\n\u201cI thought, if this thing can outperform the world champion in Go, maybe it\ncan outperform mathematicians, or at least physicists like me,\u201d said Ruehle,\nwho is now at Northeastern University.\n\nImpressed by the ability of machines to best humans at board games, Fabian\nRuehle, a physicist now at Northeastern University, wondered if similar\nalgorithms could calculate shapes of 6D manifolds in string theory.\n\nCourtesy of Fabian Ruehle\n\n## Introduction\n\nRuehle and collaborators took up the old problem of approximating Calabi-Yau\nmetrics. Anderson and others also revitalized their earlier attempts to\novercome step 2. The physicists found that neural networks provided the speed\nand flexibility that earlier techniques had lacked. The algorithms were able\nto guess a metric, check the curvature at many thousands of points in 6D\nspace, and repeatedly adjust the guess until the curvature vanished all over\nthe manifold. All the researchers had to do was tweak freely available machine\nlearning packages; by 2020, multiple groups had released custom packages for\ncomputing Calabi-Yau metrics.\n\nWith the ability to obtain metrics, physicists could finally contemplate the\nfiner features of the large-scale universes corresponding to each manifold.\n\u201cThe first thing I did after I had it, I calculated masses of particles,\u201d\nRuehle said.\n\n## From Strings to Quarks\n\nIn 2021, Ruehle, collaborating with Ashmore, cranked out the masses of exotic\nheavy particles that depend only on the curves of the Calabi-Yau. But these\nhypothetical particles would be far too massive to detect. To calculate the\nmasses of familiar particles like electrons \u2014 a goal string theorists have\nchased for decades \u2014 the machine learners would have to do more.\n\nLightweight matter particles acquire their mass through interactions with the\nHiggs field, a field of energy that extends throughout space. The more a given\nparticle takes notice of the Higgs field, the heavier it is. How strongly each\nparticle interacts with the Higgs is labeled by a quantity called its Yukawa\ncoupling. And in string theory, Yukawa couplings depend on two things. One is\nthe metric of the Calabi-Yau manifold, which is like the shape of the\ndoughnut. The other is the way quantum fields (arising as collections of\nstrings) spread out over the manifold. These quantum fields are a bit like\nsprinkles; their arrangement is related to the doughnut\u2019s shape but also\nsomewhat independent.\n\nRuehle and other physicists had released software packages that could get the\ndoughnut shape. The last step was to get the sprinkles \u2014 and neural networks\nproved capable of that task, too. Two teams put all the pieces together\nearlier this year.\n\nAn international collaboration led by Challenger Mishra of the University of\nCambridge first built on top of Ruehle\u2019s package to calculate the metric \u2014 the\ngeometry of the doughnut itself. Then they used homegrown neural networks to\ncompute the way the quantum fields overlap as they curve around the manifold,\nlike the doughnut\u2019s sprinkles. Importantly, they worked in a context where the\ngeometry of the fields and that of the manifold are tightly linked, a setup in\nwhich the Yukawa couplings are already known. When the group calculated the\ncouplings with the neural networks, the results matched the known answers.\n\n\u201cPeople have been wanting to do this since before I was born in the \u201980s,\u201d\nMishra said.\n\nAndrei Constantin, a physicist at the University of Oxford, recently used a\nhorde of machine learning algorithms to calculate the precise masses of\nfundamental particles in specific examples of string theory.\n\nThe Royal Society\n\nA group led by string theory veterans Burt Ovrut of the University of\nPennsylvania and Andre Lukas of Oxford went further. They too started with\nRuehle\u2019s metric-calculating software, which Lukas had helped develop. Building\non that foundation, they added an array of 11 neural networks to handle the\ndifferent types of sprinkles. These networks allowed them to calculate an\nassortment of fields that could take on a richer variety of shapes, creating a\nmore realistic setting that can\u2019t be studied with any other techniques. This\narmy of machines learned the metric and the arrangement of the fields,\ncalculated the Yukawa couplings, and spit out the masses of three types of\nquarks. It did all this for six differently shaped Calabi-Yau manifolds. \u201cThis\nis the first time anybody has been able to calculate them to that degree of\naccuracy,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nNone of those Calabi-Yaus underlies our universe, because two of the quarks\nhave identical masses, while the six varieties in our world come in three\ntiers of masses. Rather, the results represent a proof of principle that\nmachine learning algorithms can take physicists from a Calabi-Yau manifold all\nthe way to specific particle masses.\n\n\u201cUntil now, any such calculations would have been unthinkable,\u201d said\nConstantin, a member of the group based at Oxford.\n\n## Numbers Game\n\nThe neural networks choke on doughnuts with more than a handful of holes, and\nresearchers would eventually like to study manifolds with hundreds. And so\nfar, the researchers have considered only rather simple quantum fields. To go\nall the way to the Standard Model, Ashmore said, \u201cyou might need a more\nsophisticated neural network.\u201d\n\nBigger challenges loom on the horizon. Attempting to find our particle physics\nin the solutions of string theory \u2014 if it\u2019s in there at all \u2014 is a numbers\ngame. The more sprinkle-laden doughnuts you can check, the more likely you are\nto find a match. After decades of effort, string theorists can finally check\ndoughnuts and compare them with reality: the masses and couplings of the\nelementary particles we observe. But even the most optimistic theorists\nrecognize that the odds of finding a match by blind luck are cosmically low.\nThe number of Calabi-Yau doughnuts alone may be infinite. \u201cYou need to learn\nhow to game the system,\u201d Ruehle said.\n\nOne approach is to check thousands of Calabi-Yau manifolds and try to suss out\nany patterns that could steer the search. By stretching and squeezing the\nmanifolds in different ways, for instance, physicists might develop an\nintuitive sense of what shapes lead to what particles. \u201cWhat you really hope\nis that you have some strong reasoning after looking at particular models,\u201d\nAshmore said, \u201cand you stumble into the right model for our world.\u201d\n\nLukas and colleagues at Oxford plan to start that exploration, prodding their\nmost promising doughnuts and fiddling more with the sprinkles as they try to\nfind a manifold that produces a realistic population of quarks. Constantin\nbelieves that they will find a manifold reproducing the masses of the rest of\nthe known particles in a matter of years.\n\nTo make it interesting, there should be some new physical predictions.\n\nRenate Loll\n\nOther string theorists, however, think it\u2019s premature to start scrutinizing\nindividual manifolds. Thomas Van Riet of KU Leuven is a string theorist\npursuing the \u201cswampland\u201d research program, which seeks to identify features\nshared by all mathematically consistent string theory solutions \u2014 such as the\nextreme weakness of gravity relative to the other forces. He and his\ncolleagues aspire to rule out broad swaths of string solutions \u2014 that is,\npossible universes \u2014 before they even start to think about specific doughnuts\nand sprinkles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that people do this machine learning business, because I\u2019m sure we\nwill need it at some point,\u201d Van Riet said. But first \u201cwe need to think about\nthe underlying principles, the patterns. What they\u2019re asking about is the\ndetails.\u201d\n\nPlenty of physicists have moved on from string theory to pursue other theories\nof quantum gravity. And the recent machine learning developments are unlikely\nto bring them back. Renate Loll, a physicist at Radboud University in the\nNetherlands, said that to truly impress, string theorists will need to predict\n\u2014 and confirm \u2014 new physical phenomena beyond the Standard Model. \u201cIt is a\nneedle-in-a-haystack search, and I am not sure what we would learn from it\neven if there was convincing, quantitative evidence that it is possible\u201d to\nreproduce the Standard Model, she said. \u201cTo make it interesting, there should\nbe some new physical predictions.\u201d\n\nNew predictions are indeed the ultimate goal of many of the machine learners.\nThey hope that string theory will prove rather rigid, in the sense that\ndoughnuts matching our universe will have commonalities. These doughnuts\nmight, for instance, all contain a kind of novel particle that could serve as\na target for experiments. For now, though, that\u2019s purely aspirational, and it\nmight not pan out.\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### The Mathematician Who Sculpted the Shape of Space\n\n  2. ### In a Numerical Coincidence, Some See Evidence for String Theory\n\n  3. ### What Is a Particle?\n\n\u201cString theory is spectacular. Many string theorists are wonderful. But the\ntrack record for qualitatively correct statements about the universe is really\ngarbage,\u201d said Nima Arkani-Hamed, a theoretical physicist at the Institute for\nAdvanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nUltimately, the question of what string theory predicts remains open. Now that\nstring theorists are leveraging the power of neural networks to connect the 6D\nmicroworlds of strings with the 4D macroworlds of particles, they stand a\nbetter chance of someday answering it.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, there are loads of string theories that have nothing to do\nwith nature,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe question is: Are there any that do have\nsomething to do with it? The answer might be no, but I think it\u2019s really\ninteresting to try to push the theory to decide.\u201d\n\nBy Charlie Wood\n\nStaff Writer\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nfundamental physicsneural networksparticle physicsphysicsstring\ntheorytheoretical physicsAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Physics\n\nfundamental physics\n\n### Hopes of Big Bang Discoveries Ride on a Future Spacecraft\n\nBy Elise Cutts\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n8\n\nRead Later\n\ngeometry\n\n### Geometers Engineer New Tools to Wrangle Spacecraft Orbits\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n2\n\nRead Later\n\nThe Joy of Why\n\n### Can Information Escape a Black Hole?\n\nBy Janna Levin\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n5\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
