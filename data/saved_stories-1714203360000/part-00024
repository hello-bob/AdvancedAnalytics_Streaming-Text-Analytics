And then I type my line.\n>\n> \u2014Kurt Leucht\n\nOh, you can do that with line numbers? Not just GOTO 10?\n\nWait, it gets better:\n\n> Let\u2019s say I wasn\u2019t happy with line 15 and I wanted it to be different.

No files, no compiling.\n\nYou simply write into the computer\u2019s memory, and tell it to run\u2014from the\nmoment you turn it on.\n\nEven on my childhood TI-83 calculator, the program editor is a separate mode.\nBut on an Apple II, it\u2019s the default environment.\n\nDefaults matter; they express a product\u2019s purpose.\n\n  * A Macintosh shows you the Finder. I guess I\u2019ll arrange some files and windows.\n  * An iPhone shows you the Home Screen. I guess I\u2019ll browse some music and websites.\n  * A Game Boy? Put in a game, silly.\n  * And an Apple II? This thing is for programming.\n\nThat\u2019s what inspired a generation about what computers should be.\n\nNow I grok this complaint:\n\n> Every step between turning on the computer and running your program loses\n> 30% of the students.\n>\n> \u2014paraphrasing David Brin\n\nImagine having to log in to your guitar and create a music document before you\ncould start strumming.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
