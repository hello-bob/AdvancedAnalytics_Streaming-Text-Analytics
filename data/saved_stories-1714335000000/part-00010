And then, somehow, miraculously we did.\n\nWhen you score a table at Noma, there\u2019s no screwing around: you pay for your\nfull meal immediately upfront or you\u2019ll lose the table. The meal almost cost\nmore than our flight to Europe, but we were celebrating some recent good news\nand decided to splurge.\n\nThe reservation fell smack dab in the middle of our trip: we were going from a\nFriday to a Friday and our reservation was for a Wednesday at 5 o\u2019clock. The\nnights leading up to it we ate terrific meals at restaurants created by Noma\nalumni: Restaurant Barr, in the old Noma space; Sanchez, a Mexican restaurant\ncreated by Noma\u2019s former pastry chef; and a few non-Noma restaurants,\nincluding our favorite meal of the trip \u2014 dinner at Kodbyens Fiskebar. (I\u2019ll\nwrite about all of this in my next post.)\n\nIt was the meal that we ate the night before our dinner at Noma, though, that\nset into motion this unfortunate series of events. We had dinner at another\nhighly-recommended restaurant, on all of the \u201cBest Restaurants in Copenhagen\u201d\nguides. I have no idea what was in the food \u2014 we mostly enjoyed what we ate \u2014\nbut we both woke up the next morning feeling queasy.\n\nI spent the day convincing myself that I was fine: we ate a light breakfast, I\njogged around the hotel room to get my system moving. Craig wasn\u2019t buying it:\n\u201cI\u2019m worried you\u2019re not going to be well enough for this meal.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nAt four o\u2019clock, we set off on foot to Noma, about a 45 minute walk, which got\nus there just in time to have a little iced tea in the greenhouse. Everyone\nwas so welcoming and friendly, at first I thought we actually knew the people\nwho greeted us as we approached, they seemed so happy to see us.\n\nWhen it was time for the actual dinner, we were sent form the greenhouse to\nthe main structure that you see above with the most gorgeous, seashell-covered\ndoor. It felt like the gateway to Narnia or some kind of mermaid kingdom.\n\nWhen we opened it, standing there to greet us was the entire staff of the\nrestaurant. It was such a shocking moment, Craig said: \u201cI feel like I should\ngive a speech.\u201d Everyone laughed and then as we were led past the kitchen into\nthe dining room, all of the chefs \u2014 what felt like twenty of them \u2014 were lined\nup to greet us and say hello. It was kind of overwhelming, seeing all these\neager, expectant faces of the people who were about to pull apart crustaceans\nwith tweezers just for our gastronomical pleasure.\n\nThe lead picture of this post shows you the first thing that we saw when we\nsat down at the table: an entire cod\u2019s head. An explanation was made about\ncelebrating local ingredients, how the fish were all caught in Denmark or\nNorway, and how we were going to experience taste sensations from the ocean\nthat we most likely had never experienced before.\n\nAfter negotiating a wine pairing or a juice pairing for a supplemental fee (I\nwent with wine, Craig went for a combo of juice and wine), we were presented\nwith our first course: a whole cooked langoustine that was, indeed, pulled\napart on an almost microscopic level. It came with mussel broth that was\ntopped with seaweed: you were supposed to sip the broth through the seaweed\nand indeed it was like the most potent seafood elixir you\u2019ve ever tasted.\n\nThere was also a pickled magnolia bud because of course you want a pickled\nmagnolia bud with your langoustine and seaweed mussel soup\n\nChecking in with myself, I thought: \u201cOkay, so far so good. Nothing too\nshocking except for that cod\u2019s head, which we didn\u2019t have to eat. I think I\u2019m\ngoing to be okay.\u201d\n\nThe next course was seaweed a la cr\u00e9me which was exactly as the name implied:\npieces of beautiful seaweed (one wrapping an oyster leaf) over a creamy sauce.\nSort of like eating the bottom of an aquarium, but a very clean one.\n\nThe next course involved lifting a rock off a mussel only to have it open by\nitself, revealing the meat of the mussel to be wrapped intricately with golden\nbeets.\n\n00:00\n\n00:07\n\n00:00\n\nIronically, at this point in the meal, I was turning a bit clammy and Craig\ncouldn\u2019t help but notice.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like yourself,\u201d he said, concern in his voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look haunted.'\u201c\n\nI excused myself from the table and walked back past the kitchen to the\nbathrooms. This is a good point to mention that the kitchen was run like an\narm of the military. A head chef would yell something out, everyone would yell\nit back, and it was so intimidating, I was scared someone was going to yell at\nme to \u201cdrop and give me twenty.\u201d\n\nIn the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face and took some deep breaths.\nI didn\u2019t feel like I was going to throw up, but I also didn\u2019t not feel like I\nwas going to throw up. I figured \u201cmind over matter,\u201d and tried to will myself\nto feel better. I prayed that the next course would be somewhat more\npalatable, maybe a PB&J or a matzoh ball soup.\n\nInstead it was raw squid on grilled koji.\n\nKoji, it turns out, is the product of soya beans that have been inoculated\nwith a fermentation culture, Aspergillus oryzae \u2014 aka: moldy soy beans. They\nbrought a whole tray of white mold for us to examine and enjoy while chewing\nthe raw, translucent cephalopod. This may have also been the moment that Craig\nwas presented with an iced tea made out of blossoms that were digested by\nbeetles and then pooped out. They brought out some of the poop tea for us to\nsniff.\n\nAs I grew queasier and queasier, it became harder and harder to find culinary\nmerit in all of this this. Were we being scammed? Punk\u2019d? What\u2019s wrong with a\ngood old-fashioned baked ziti? Or a prime rib with Yorkshire pudding and all\nthe fixings? Wouldn\u2019t The Olive Garden be really good right about now, with\nthose bottomless breadsticks? Breadsticks! Bread! Did they have bread?\n\n\u201cWould it be possible to get some bread?\u201d I asked a waiter and then I imagined\nhim going into the kitchen, announcing that Table 12 wanted bread, and the\nhead chef shooting the man who prepared my squid for it not satisfying the\ncustomer enough. (The Menu was clearly on my mind.)\n\nWe had two more courses \u2014 cod roe waffle and hand-dived scallop \u2014 before the\ndish that brought me to my knees. It was a dish that stared us right in the\nface.\n\nThat\u2019s right: cod head with tongue on the bone and \u201ceye pie.\u201d That\u2019s really\nwhat they called it. \u201cEye pie.\u201d\n\nThe waitress who served it explained that it wasn\u2019t exactly a whole eyeball,\nit was just the white of the eyeball, and they used squid ink to make the\npupil \u2014 as if that made it better?\n\nImagine feeling nauseous and then somebody hands you this.\n\nRemember that scene in Bridesmaids where Kristin Wiig has to eat the Jordan\nalmond to prove that she didn\u2019t feel sick, even though sweat was pooling on\nher forehead and she was almost completely green? That\u2019s what I looked like\nsomehow forcing this down my gullet. And, reader, I really did eat that. I\nalso gnawed a little on the cod tongue, which felt like making out with Shamu.\n\nThis is the moment where Craig, looking at me, said: \u201cIf you need to leave,\nyou can leave. Seriously. It\u2019s totally okay.\u201d\n\nIt felt absolutely ridiculous: after how far we\u2019d come, how much money we\u2019d\nspent, how much work went into every component of this meal by this hard-\nworked army of chefs?\n\nBut in that moment, I realized that I would pay the price of a whole other\nmeal at Noma just for the ability to leave the restaurant. That\u2019s what I\nwanted more than anything: to get away from the fish eyes and the beetle poop\ntea and the moldy squid. I just wanted to go back to the hotel, get into bed,\nand fantasize about pasta and cake and all of the things that made me love\nfood in the first place.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said to Craig. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t mind eating here alone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he assured me even though he too was feeling a little queasy.\n\nI summoned over one of the managers and very discreetly told her that I wasn\u2019t\nfeeling well and that I needed to leave. Her face flushed a bit \u2014 leave Noma!\nare you mad?! \u2014 but then she asked if there was anything they could do and\nwhen I told her there wasn\u2019t, she sweetly called me a cab and sent me home\nwith some mushroom garum.\n\nDuring the cab ride home, I lowered the window and breathed in the fresh air\nand felt such a sense of relief, such a sense of liberation, they may as well\nhave played the theme from The Shawshank Redemption.\n\nCraig, meanwhile, texted me throughout the rest of the meal, which he mostly\nenjoyed, especially this \u201csweet oyster\u201d dessert which was really ice cream.\n\nThis whole experience taught me many things.\n\nOne: context is everything. If I\u2019d felt 100%, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve gotten a\nkick out of this avant-garde meal, even the fish eyeballs.\n\nTwo: just because somebody tells you that a restaurant is \u201cthe best restaurant\nin the world,\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the best restaurant in the world for\nyou.\n\nAnd, three: no situation is worth enduring if it\u2019s actively making you feel\nunwell. Just ask anyone who\u2019s seen Matchbox Twenty live.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is my Noma story. I\u2019m glad I went before the restaurant\nclosed forever and I\u2019m glad I was able to taste some of these challenging,\ngenre-pushing dishes. Beauty, it turns out, really is in the eye of the\nbeholder and that eye now lives in my stomach.\n\nrestaurantscopenhagentravelstoriesfish\n\nAdam Roberts\n\n### Comments (35)\n\nNewest First\n\nPreview Post Comment...\n\nTejas 19 hours ago Pending Awaiting Moderation \u00b7 0 Likes\n\nFantastic.

But\nafter a few disgusting courses, we also felt like we were being punked. We are\nadventurous eaters, so that was not the issue. The problem was that, while\nundeniably creative, the food was not tasty. Every course was some sort of\ngreen soupy lichen, burnt root, or unripe berry. Being provocative is fine, as\nlong as what you serve is still delicious. The chefs at Noma never seemed to\nunderstand that. The emperor has no clothes at Noma!\n\nPreview Post Reply\n\nGail Calluori 3 days ago Pending Awaiting Moderation \u00b7 0 Likes\n\nOh my Lord!!
