Tuesday.\n\nProject ACDC (Apple Chips in Data Center), which has been in the works for\nseveral years, has no clear timeline, WSJ reported, citing people familiar\nwith the matter.\n\nThe iPhone maker has been working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\non the chip\u2019s design and production, though it remains uncertain whether the\nefforts have yielded any positive results, the report said.\n\nWSJ said Apple\u2019s server chip will likely be focused on AI inference, rather\nthan on training AI models \u2014 an area which experts have said will continue to\nbe dominated by American chip giant Nvidia.\n\nIn AI, inference is the process that trained machine learning models use to\ndraw conclusions from brand-new data. Other large tech companies, such as\nGoogle, have invested in the development of their own AI inference server\nchips as part of efforts to untether themselves from chip designers.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO6:4806:48\n\nApple is on board with AI, \u2018not just hype there\u2019s substance around it\u2019:\nDeepwater\u2019s Gene Munster\n\nFast Money\n\nExperts have pointed out that Apple was behind in the AI race while rivals\nsuch as Microsoft have invested billions into AI technology and\ninfrastructure.\n\nCEO Tim Cook said in February that the company was \u201cinvesting significantly\u201d\nin the technology and would make an AI-related announcement later this year.\nAnalysts expect the company to make the announcement at its Worldwide\nDevelopers Conference slated for June.\n\nIn Apple\u2019s latest quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Cook told investors\nthat the company was continuing to invest in AI. \u201cWe believe in the\ntransformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that\nwill differentiate us in this new era,\u201d he said.\n\nApple\u2019s fiscal second-quarter earnings beat expectations despite overall\nrevenue dropping 4% amid falling iPhone sales. The company also announced a\n$110 billion share buyback on Thursday, the largest in its history, resulting\nin a jump in share price.\n\nRead the full report on The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTV\n\nMoney MoversWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Fast Money Halftime 12:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
