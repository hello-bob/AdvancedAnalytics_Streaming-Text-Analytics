The model-as-a-service approach has transformed AI from an esoteric\ndiscipline into a powerful development tool that anyone can use. Everyone,\nincluding those with minimal or no prior AI experience, can now leverage AI\nmodels to build applications. In this book, author Chip Huyen discusses AI\nengineering: the process of building applications with readily available\nfoundation models.\n\nThe book starts with an overview of AI engineering, explaining how it differs\nfrom traditional ML engineering and discussing the new AI stack. The more AI\nis used, the more opportunities there are for catastrophic failures, and\ntherefore, the more important evaluation becomes. This book discusses\ndifferent approaches to evaluating open-ended models, including the rapidly\ngrowing AI-as-a-judge approach.\n\nAI application developers will discover how to navigate the AI landscape,\nincluding models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, and the seemingly infinite\nnumber of use cases and application patterns. You'll learn a framework for\ndeveloping an AI application, starting with simple techniques and progressing\ntoward more sophisticated methods, and discover how to efficiently deploy\nthese applications.\n\n  * Understand what AI engineering is and how it differs from traditional machine learning engineering\n  * Learn the process for developing an AI application, the challenges at each step, and approaches to address them\n  * Explore various model adaptation techniques, including prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, agents, and dataset engineering, and understand how and why they work\n  * Examine the bottlenecks for latency and cost when serving foundation models and learn how to overcome them\n  * Choose the right model, dataset, evaluation benchmarks, and metrics for your needs\n\nChip Huyen works to accelerate data analytics on GPUs at Voltron Data.\nPreviously, she was with Snorkel AI and NVIDIA, founded an AI infrastructure\nstartup, and taught Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford. She\u00e2??s the\nauthor of the book Designing Machine Learning Systems, an Amazon bestseller in\nAI.\n\n## Publisher resources\n\nView/Submit Errata\n\n## Table of contents\n\n  1.
