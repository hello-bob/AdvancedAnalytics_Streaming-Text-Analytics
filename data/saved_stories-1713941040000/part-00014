Characterized by its speed, lightweight\narchitecture, and localalized operation, FlowTestAI safeguards privacy while\nfacilitating the seamless integration of API driven workflows.\n\nIt works as a normal desktop app and interacts directly with your local file\nsystem as other IDE(s) like VSCode, Intellij etc. This not only safeguards\nprivacy but helps one to collaborate with others via git or any version\ncontrol system.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 We are actively working on launching a CLI. The CLI allows you to run API\nfirst workflows created using FlowTestAI from command line interface making it\neasier to automate and run them in a CI/CD (continuous\nintegration/development) fashion.\n\n## Documentation \ud83d\udcdd\n\nhttps://flowtestai.gitbook.io/flowtestai\n\n## Setup\n\n## Production \ud83d\ude80\n\nFlowTestAI is an electron app that runs entirely in your local environment\ninteracting with your local file system just like other IDE(s) out there like\nVSCode, Intellij etc. The platform-specific binaries are available for\ndownload from our GitHub releases. We currently offer binaries for macOS, with\nversions for Windows and Linux under development \ud83d\udea7. If you require a binary\nfor a specific platform, please let us know in the Discussions section. We\nwill prioritize your request accordingly.\n\n## Development \ud83d\udd27\n\n  1.
