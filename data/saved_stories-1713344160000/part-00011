It\naims to have a modular implementation, in which different components can be\nreused or replaced based on the use-case.\n\nTvix is developed as a GPLv3-licensed open-source project by TVL, with source\ncode available in the TVL monorepo.\n\nThere are several projects within Tvix, such as:\n\n  * //tvix/castore - subtree storage/transfer in a content-addressed fashion\n  * //tvix/cli - preliminary REPL & CLI implementation for Tvix\n  * //tvix/eval - an implementation of the Nix programming language\n  * //tvix/nar-bridge - a HTTP webserver providing a Nix HTTP Binary Cache interface in front of a tvix-store\n  * //tvix/nix-compat - a Rust library for compatibility with C++ Nix, features like encodings and hashing schemes and formats\n  * //tvix/serde - a Rust library for using the Nix language for app configuration\n  * //tvix/store - a \"filesystem\" linking Nix store paths and metadata with the content-addressed layer\n  * ... and a handful others!\n\nThe language evaluator can be toyed with in Tvixbolt, and you can check out\nthe Tvix README (GitHub mirror) for additional information on the project and\ndevelopment workflows.\n\nDeveloper documentation for some parts of Tvix is available online.\n\nBenchmarks are run nightly on new commits by windtunnel.\n\nCheck out the latest Tvix-related blog posts from TVL's website:\n\n  * Tvix Status - February '24\n  * Tvix Status - September '22\n  * Tvix: We are rewriting Nix\n\ncode | reviews | ci | bugs | todos | search\n\n\u0ca0_\u0ca0\n\n", "frontpage": true}
