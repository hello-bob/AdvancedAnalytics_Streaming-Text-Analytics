I am not concerned\nwith the mathematics \u2014 I\u2019m not qualified \u2014 but with why they think that paying\nattention to distance errors and what they call \u201cboundary cuts\u201d is important.\nThese are the two factors, in addition to the general metric, that underpin\ntheir claim to have created the most accurate map to date. (See my previous\npost.)\n\n### 1\\. The Unobjectionable Treatment of Map Projection Distortions by\nGoldberg and Gott (2007)\n\nA persistent element of any general text on map projections is that each\nprojection is defined in part by how it \u201cdistorts\u201d the surface of the earth in\ntransforming it from a curved surface in three dimensions to a plane in two.\nOne set of projections do not distort angles and shapes; they are variably\ncalled as eumorphic, conformal, or isotropic projections. Another set do not\nalter the relative areas of defined entities; they are generally called equal-\narea. A further set is often defined, but not always, in which the scale\nfactor along many meridians or parallels, or other great or lesser circles, is\nconstant; this is not to say that scale factor is consistent along any and\never circle on such \u201cequidistant\u201d map projections, just on a defined subset.\nAnother set are those projections designed in the nineteenth and twentieth\ncenturies to balance or in some other way minimize shape and areal\ndistortions; these are called \u201ccompromise\u201d or \u201cminimum-error\u201d projections. And\nthen there are a great many other map projections that have some other special\nproperties, or none at all.\n\n(Important: Goldberg and Gott [2007] quite properly refer to lines across the\nellipsoid as geodesics; given that for most purposes the difference in mapping\nthe entire earth approximated as an ellipsoid or approximated as a sphere is\nnegligible, I\u2019ll continue using standard geographical terms like \u201cgreat\ncircle\u201d intended for the earth approximated as a sphere.)\n\nGoldberg and Gott (2007) extended the usual discussion of conformality and\nequal-areaness to also consider further kinds of distortion that are evident\n\u201con continental scales\u201d and on world maps. Specifically, they defined and gave\nexamples of \u201cflexion\u201d (or the degree of bending of great circles from the\nstraight line of the great circle across the earth\u2019s surface) and of\n\u201cskewness\u201d which they gloss as \u201clopsidedness\u201d (i.e., scale factors are not\nequal to either side of a point, so that the weight of distortion at a point\nleans one way or another). Flexion and skewness are interesting concepts and\nare mathematically defined. So far, so good. And, actually, the authors\u2019\napplication of these factors to modify the usual Tissot indictrix generates\nrevealing nuances and precision in the pattern of distortion on a map\nprojection.\n\n### 2\\. Problems with Goldberg and Gott (2007)\n\nThings start to get weird when Goldberg and Gott (2007, \u00a76) pursue a numerical\nanalysis to define the \u201coverall quality\u201d of any given projection. Mercator\u2019s\nprojection makes a good fit close the equator (or central meridian in\ntransverse aspect, which is one reason it is used for the multiply projected\nzones of UTM), so that the fact that it goes off to infinity at the poles does\nnot make it \u201cinfinitely bad\u201d (p. 315). What then, the author\u2019s ask is the\noverall quality of the projection as compared to others?\n\nThey create a single metric in two steps. First, they randomly selected 30,000\npoints across the globe and calculated the root mean square (RMS) of all their\nisotropic and areal distortions (I and A) and also the indices for flexion and\nskewness (F and S). But then they also throw in two other undefined factors:\n\nD, \u201ccorresponding to distance errors,\u201d which is to say the RMS of the ratio of\nmap to globe distances along the great circles between the pairs of points;\n\nB, \u201ccorresponding to the average number of map boundary cuts crossed by the\nshortest geodesic connecting a random pair of points\u201d which is calculated as B\n= Lb/4\u03c0 where \u201cLb is the total length (in radians) of the boundary cuts\u201d It is\nnot explained how this calculation gives the specified correspondence.\n\nThey presented these metrics in a big table for a number of common map\nprojections:\n\nScience, amirite?\n\nFinally, Goldberg and Gott (2007, 317) combine all the summary metrics for the\ndifferent kinds of distortion, I, A, F, S, D, B to create a single metric,\nwhat the recent pre-pub paper called the \u201cfidelity metric\u201d (Gott, Goldberg,\nVanderbei 2021). How did they weight these different values in combining them?\nEqually: each kind of error is as important as the rest.\n\nSo, the problems:\n\n  1. It is unexplained why \u201cdistance error\u201d is important to consider. Although, Gott, Mugnolo, and Colley (2007) state as axiomatic that \u201cMaps convey important information about distances between pairs of points. It is therefore desirable to minimize the errors made in representing distances between pairs of points on maps.\u201d\n\n  2. It is unexplained why \u201cboundary cuts\u201d are a significant kind of error.\n\n  3. Nor is it explained how the provided formula matches the verbal definition. As stated, B seems to require the calculation of intersections cutting boundaries/edges along many great circles and then taking the RMS.\n\n  4. And the big one: the equal weighting of the contributory factors is neither explained nor justified. At all. Just a brief statement that someone else made such a single metric, so we can too. No analysis of how that previous scholar had constructed his metric, how it succeeded, and how it failed (because why else do they present their own?).\n\n  5. If flexion and skewness are derivatives of isotropy and areal distortions, as the authors state right up front, then they are dependent variables and have no place in the (un)weighted metric alongside the independent variables I and A.\n\nProblems 1\u20133, at minimum, should in my book have been occasion for revisions.\nProblem 4 is such a basic flaw that the paper should be rejected, or the\nentire discussion and conclusions (together \u00a76) should be cropped in its\nentirety. And, if I am correct, problem 5 is just bad and a sign the journal\neditors should have just run away from the paper. Screaming.\n\nAll of this is to say:\n\nthe metric of quality\n\nthat these authors present\n\non which they have determined the absolute quality (from 6 to 0 [perfect]) of\nany map projection and\n\nby which they have exalted their own new map as the best thing since sliced\nbread,\n\nfeatures six parameters\n\ntwo of which are of undefined relevancy (D and B)\n\ntwo more of which are probably dependent and as such have no place in the\nmetric (F and S)\n\nthat are combined by weighting that\n\nis simply unjustified and unexplained and\n\nhas been made up at the drop of a hat to give equal weight to the spurious\nparameters.\n\nTo base any comparison of the quality or value of different map projections\nthrough this metric is a load of fetid dingoes\u2019 kidneys. (To quote the late,\ngreat Douglas Adams.) It simply cannot be taken seriously as a mathematical\nexercise.\n\nTo then base claims of the amazingly quality of one\u2019s own map projection by\nrelying primarily on the disputable parameters D and B, especially when B is\ndropped to zero by simply declaring the interruption to be a fold, is\nmathematically sloppy, utterly self-serving, and borders on the disreputable.\n\n### 3\\. Why Bother?\n\nAnd we haven\u2019t even started on issues of why world map projections should be\nsubjected to a competition for \u201cthe best.\u201d If you want the best world map,\nwhen \u201cbest\u201d is defined strictly by geometrical parameters, then buy a globe\n(and squish it a bit to make it an ellipsoid). If you want a flat world map,\nthen accept that you are engaging in one of several different spatial\ndiscourses in which geometrical accuracy and mathematical principles are\nlargely irrelevant, beyond the basic issue of visual propriety (using equal-\narea projections in analytical mapping) and thoroughly idiosyncratic reactions\nto shapes. World mapping is ineluctably a social and cultural act and social\nand cultural considerations should take precedence.\n\nA map projection manifests in two ways: as the graphic network of meridians\nand parallels, and as a set of two or more mathematical formulae. Under the\nmodern idealization of cartography, discussion of the projections of world\nmaps means discussion of their formulae and their geometry and their\n\u201caccuracy.\u201d These are indeed matters of absolute importance to certain\ncommunities of mapping, notably engineers seeking to modify the earth\u2019s\nsurface contours, artillerymen seeking to lob shells against an enemy, or\nhikers seeking to know how far they have yet to walk to get to food, drink,\nand rest. But they are not important at all in world mapping. World maps do\nnot just denote the earth\u2019s features, they connote \u201cthe world.\u201d Treating world\nmaps as anything else is a fools errand.\n\n### References\n\nGoldberg, David M., and J.
