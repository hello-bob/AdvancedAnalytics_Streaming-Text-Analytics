Unless\nDemocrats sweep to power in a wave election (which doesn\u2019t look likely), most\nof these proposals aren\u2019t going to make it into law. But it\u2019s worth examining\nthe proposal anyway, because...well, because this is an economics blog, and\nthat\u2019s what we do!\n\nMy take on this plan is basically that yes, we need to raise taxes in the\nU.S., because of big deficits and higher interest rates. And most \u2014 though not\nall \u2014 of Biden\u2019s suggestions about how to do that are actually pretty good\nideas. Capital gains taxes and estate taxes, which are the mainstay of the\nproposal, could both stand to go up in this country.\n\nBut there are a number of big problems with the plan as well. First of all,\nthe idea of taxing unrealized capital gains \u2014 which is now unfortunately a\nfixture among progressive intellectual circles \u2014 is a bad one, since it\ndefeats much of the purpose of taxing capital gains in the first place.\nSecond, Biden is proposing to use much of the tax increases to fund health\ncare subsidies, which will increase the price of health care, at a time when\npeople are mad about rising service prices. And third, the rhetoric in the\nplan is all about reducing racial wealth gaps, which seems likely to alienate\na lot more voters than if it were couched in terms of deficit reduction\n(though this is a political concern rather than an economic one).\n\nSo I think the plan has some very good pieces, but needs a lot of work. I\u2019ll\ntry to keep these points fairly succinct, so as not to bore you, but here\ngoes.\n\n####\n\nWhy we need to raise taxes (and cut spending)\n\nThe U.S. government is running a big deficit:\n\nThis doesn\u2019t look good. The pandemic is over, and the economy is doing great.\nAccording to the principles of standard Keynesian macroeconomic management,\nthis should be the perfect time to get deficits under control. For one thing,\ninflation is still above target, and fiscal deficits may be contributing to\ninflation. Also, interest rates are fairly high, so borrowing right now\nincreases interest costs by a lot. That\u2019s a problem the U.S. hasn\u2019t faced\nsince the 1990s:\n\nPerhaps the MMT people would advise us to just keep borrowing more and more to\ncover these interest costs, and then borrow even more to cover that interest,\netc. That is a bad idea; eventually something in the economy will break. We\u2019ll\neventually get a default premium on government bonds, or hyperinflation, etc.\nIn order to avoid the possibility of that, and to avoid having the rest of the\nbudget crowded out by interest costs, the U.S. government will have to get\ndeficit spending under control.\n\nThere are two ways we can get deficits under control: 1) cut government\nspending, and 2) raise taxes. That\u2019s it \u2014 those are the only options. So which\nshould we do in this case? Breaking down the deficit into taxes and spending\n(both as a percent of GDP, of course), we can see that spending is\nhistorically high right now, while taxes are historically low:\n\nI drew the purple lines to mark where we are right now. As you can see,\nspending is higher than it\u2019s been in recent history, except for during the\nGreat Recession. And taxes are lower than they were under Reagan, Clinton, and\n(mostly) Bush. If we think that the 80s, 90s, and early 00s are a good guide\nto what our taxes and spending should be, it means we should cut spending and\nraise taxes right now.\n\nNow you could make a libertarian argument that we should do deficit reduction\nentirely with spending cuts, because taxation is theft, because government\nspending is wasteful, and so on. And you could make a progressive argument\nthat we should do deficit reduction entirely with tax increases, because\nreducing inequality is good, and because pretty much everything the government\nis spending money on now is good and important. I could argue with both of\nthese cases, but I\u2019m not going to, because A) a political compromise on\ndeficit reduction will inevitably end up with some mixture of spending cuts\nand tax increases, B) this is what we did in the 90s and it worked, and C)\nthis is what other countries do when they successfully reduce deficits.\n\nSo taxes should go up. And two of the best kinds of taxes we could raise right\nnow are capital gains taxes and estate taxes.\n\n####\n\nCapital gains taxes, estate taxes, and accrual taxes\n\nBiden\u2019s plan has three ideas for tax hikes:\n\n  1. Raise capital gains tax rates to the same rate as the tax rate on other kinds of income,\n\n  2. Eliminate the \u201cstep-up basis\u201d that allows people to dodge capital gains taxes if they inherit assets, and\n\n  3. Create a 25% minimum income tax for the wealthy that includes unrealized capital gains as income.\n\nBasically, I think the first two of these are good ideas, and the third should\nbe dropped.\n\nWhen deciding what kinds of taxes to raise, we have to take a few\nconsiderations into account. First, there\u2019s the question of fairness \u2014 who we\nthink should be paying taxes. Second, there\u2019s the question of what kind of\nbehavior taxes encourage and discourage; if you want people to save more\nmoney, you probably shouldn\u2019t tax their savings. Changing economic behavior\ncan also distort the economy and make the whole country poorer. Finally,\nthere\u2019s the question of how much revenue you can feasibly raise from a\nparticular tax.\n\nIn general, capital gains taxes are a decently good way to tax an economy. On\nthe fairness side, they affect rich people a lot more. Rich people own a\ndisproportionate share of assets in the first place, even relative to their\nincome; this is why wealth inequality is much higher than income inequality.\nThis means capital gains taxes will hit rich people a lot harder than everyone\nelse.\n\nAlso, capital gains taxes don\u2019t seem to distort economic behavior very much.\nTheoretically, taxing capital gains more gives people an incentive to invest\nless in the stock and housing markets, because the rate of return they can\nmake is less. This could cause markets to fall in the short term, and make it\nharder for businesses to find financing in the long term. If so, it would also\nincrease consumption, because the only thing you can really do with your money\nother than save it is to spend it today. But higher capital gains taxes may\nalso keep money in the market, via a \u201clock-in\u201d effect \u2014 if you wait longer to\nsell your stocks or houses, your gains can compound more, reducing your\noverall tax bill. Economists argue about how big these effects are.\n\nHistorically, though, changes in capital gains tax rates don\u2019t seem to do much\nto the stock market. For example, when Biden started talking about raising\ncapital gains taxes in 2021, some Goldman Sachs people noted that we\u2019ve\nactually changed the tax rate a bunch of times, and didn\u2019t see much action in\nthe market:\n\nSource: John Authers\n\nThere is plenty of evidence that higher capital-gains taxes make people sell\nstocks less often, but this could just be because they\u2019re waiting for the tax\nrate to go down again in the future. In general, people just don\u2019t change\ntheir behavior much in order to try to avoid capital gains taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, dividend tax cuts, which are somewhat similar to capital gains tax\ncuts, don\u2019t seem to induce businesses to increase capital spending. So the\neconomic distortion of higher capital gains taxes is probably not huge. And on\nthe revenue question, Sarin et al. (2022) argue that capital gains taxes would\nbe a big revenue raiser, because people aren\u2019t likely to take their money out\nof the market in the long term \u2014 especially now that most stock investment is\nthrough index funds and ETFs.\n\nSo capital gains taxes are probably not a bad way to fund the government.\nBiden\u2019s plan, which would raise the long-term tax rate on capital gains to be\nthe same as the tax rate on ordinary income, would likely raise a lot of money\nfrom wealthy people, without hurting the overall economy that much. There are\na number of small problems with it, but that\u2019s generally true of any other tax\nas well, and there are small fixes that could be applied. This is why Bill\nGates has been calling for a higher capital gains tax for years.\n\nCurrently, a big way that people dodge capital gains taxes completely is to\ninherit the money. The \u201cstep-up basis\u201d policy says that if you inherit stocks\nor a house, you never have to pay taxes on the amount those assets appreciated\nfrom the time they were purchased. In fact, that tax never gets paid by\nanyone. Inheritance just washes the tax liability away forever.\n\nThis is pretty obviously a huge loophole in the U.S. tax code. Even tax\nplanners who advise you to use this strategy call it a \u201cloophole\u201d. There\u2019s\nzero economic rationalization for why inheritance should be taxed less than\nother income; in fact, most people probably believe that rich heirs are\nespecially undeserving of their windfalls of dynastic wealth. Over time, the\nstep-up basis loophole contributes to a society of dynastic, entrenched\ninequality. Also, there\u2019s evidence that estate taxes don\u2019t change savings\nbehavior, so eliminating the step-up basis loophole probably wouldn\u2019t cause\nAmericans to save less.\n\nBiden\u2019s tax plan would eliminate the step-up basis loophole entirely, taxing\nthe capital gain income at the time it\u2019s inherited. This seems like an\nobviously good idea. (There\u2019s also another well-known estate tax loophole that\nBiden\u2019s plan would close; this is also good, though I won\u2019t go into it here.)\n\nBut Biden\u2019s third proposal \u2014 taxing unrealized capital gains as income \u2014 is\njust more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Capital gains taxes are collected only when\nyou sell an asset. This has long irked progressives, who grumble at the idea\nthat rich people are seeing their wealth increase by leaps and bounds every\nyear without being taxed a penny.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan would \u201cfix\u201d this problem by taxing asset appreciation before the\nassets are sold \u2014 an idea that\u2019s sometimes called an accrual tax. But as I\nwrote in Bloomberg back in 2019, this could seriously hurt startup formation:\n\n> [T]axing unrealized gains would force asset owners to sell some of their\n> holdings [each year] in order to pay their taxes. For some assets, like\n> publicly traded stocks, that\u2019s no big deal, because their markets are big\n> and liquid, with many buyers and sellers. But imagine the stock of a\n> startup...When the startup\u2019s stock appreciates in value because it accepts\n> funding at a higher valuation, the founders, early employees, and early\n> investors would probably have to sell some of their stake in order to make\n> the tax payments. Finding a buyer would be difficult and time-consuming, and\n> they might have to sell at a big loss, hurting the company\u2019s development.\n\nA much less chaotic and disruptive way to address the issue of unrealized\ngains, suggested by Alan Auerbach, would be to simply charge people interest\non their past gains when they eventually sell their assets. If the step-up\nbasis loophole is fixed, retroactive capital gains taxation does the same\nthing as accrual taxation, but without the liquidity problem.\n\nSo Biden should switch from suggesting accrual taxes to proposing charging\ninterest on past capital gains. If he doesn\u2019t make that switch, the accrual\ntax proposal is probably dead on arrival, since it would be too disruptive to\nthe startup economy \u2014 which is a key engine of American economic growth.\n\nWith that one important exception, the tax proposals here are pretty good. But\nwhen it comes to spending proposals, the plan has major problems.\n\n####\n\nWe don\u2019t need to throw more money at overpriced services\n\nThe money from higher taxes should be used either for deficit reduction, or\nfor high-priority spending items. Biden\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t talk about deficits at\nall; instead, it proposes using the revenue from higher taxes to expand the\nwelfare state in two ways:\n\n  1. Restoring the expanded Child Tax Credit from the American Rescue Plan, and\n\n  2. Making permanent the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s tax credit for health insurance premiums.\n\nThe first of these is a good idea. It\u2019s the closest thing America is going to\nget to a universal basic income anytime soon. Unconditional cash transfers are\nprobably the most efficient form of welfare state possible, and focusing the\ntransfers on families with kids is a pro-natalist policy as well. Mitt Romney\nproposed something a bit like this.\n\nBut it\u2019s questionable whether we can afford a UBI-type spending proposal right\nnow, given higher interest rates, high deficits, and the demands of other\nmajor spending items like industrial policy and national security. It might be\na good idea to shelve the expanded CTC for right now, especially because it\ndidn\u2019t turn out to be very politically popular the first time around.\n\nBiden\u2019s health care spending proposal, meanwhile, is just plain misguided.\nHealth care is one of our most overpriced industries; the growth in medical\ncare prices has outstripped median income by leaps and bounds over the last\nfour decades.\n\nThese high prices are the reason why the U.S. health care system costs more\nthan twice as much as other rich countries\u2019 systems, despite not being better\nin quality. Bringing these prices down should be our number one priority.\n\nHealth care subsidies move us in the exact opposite direction. When you\nsubsidize the demand for something, its price goes up. This generates calls\nfor more subsidies, perpetuating the cycle \u2014 what the Niskanen Center calls\n\u201ccost disease socialism\u201d. Ultimately, we end up with a health system that\u2019s\nboth dreadfully inefficient and ruinously expensive. Arguably, we\u2019re there\nalready.\n\nThe urge to shovel money at already-overpriced service industries was always\nthe weakest part of Bidenomics. Not only can the money be better spent\nelsewhere, but there\u2019s reason to believe increased health insurance subsidies\nare just exacerbating America\u2019s cost disease.\n\n####\n\nRacial justice rhetoric is probably not the best justification here\n\nI should probably mention one more big problem with Biden\u2019s plan, which is the\nrhetorical justification it gives for all of these proposals. The title of the\nTreasury Department\u2019s plan is \u201cAdvancing Equity through Tax Reform: Effects of\nthe Administration\u2019s Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue Proposals on Racial Wealth\nInequality\u201d. The entire document basically just talks about how the various\ntax and spending proposals will shrink racial wealth gaps.\n\nNow, racial wealth gaps are big, and I don\u2019t like them at all. Racial wealth\ngaps are bad. But if that\u2019s the only justification the Biden people have to\noffer for raising taxes on the American people, I doubt this plan will pass in\nany form. The idea of racially redistributionary policies is not popular with\nthe American people. For example, reparations for slavery are highly\nunpopular, including among the growing Hispanic and Asian swing\nconstituencies:\n\nSource: Pew\n\nThe thing is, we have plenty of reasons to raise taxes \u2014 and to spend money on\nthe welfare state \u2014 that have nothing to do with racial wealth gaps at all.\nThe deficit needs to be reduced. Child poverty needs to be reduced even among\nWhite people. The revitalization of American manufacturing needs to be funded.\n\nInstead of making racial wealth gaps the single overriding reason for this tax\nplan, the Biden people should cite all these other reasons as well. I don\u2019t\nthink the rhetoric about racial wealth gaps should be dropped, but I don\u2019t\nthink it should take center stage as well. A proposal like this will have\nenough trouble passing without making it seem like a zero-sum racially\ntargeted thing.\n\nAnyway, to sum up, I think this Biden tax plan has some extremely promising\nelements, but it needs a lot of work. Changing the accrual tax proposal to a\nretroactive capital gains tax, eliminating the health insurance subsidies in\nfavor of deficit reduction and industrial policy, and adding a bunch more\nreasons for the plan other than closing racial wealth gaps would all go a long\nway toward increasing both the plan\u2019s effectiveness and it\u2019s chances of\npassing.\n\nShare\n\n126 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n11 Restacks\n\n126\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Biden is right that we need to raise taxes\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n164\n\nShare\n\n164 Comments\n\nAlan Goldhammer11 hrs agoLiked by Noah SmithWhile I agree with the post, what\nis missing from the discussion is the absolute need for tax simplification.\nRaising taxes on an over complex tax code is always a fool's errand. I\ncontinue to reference TR Reid's fine book, \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest for a\nSimpler, Fairer, and More Efficient Tax System.\" there is an absolute need to\neliminate all tax preferences and increase the personal deduction in return.\nWe need a Value Added Tax in return for lower corporate income taxes (which\nare always gamed and can never keep up with clever accountants and tax\nlawyers). This would lead to an elimination of off shore tax havens.In my\ncase, the government knows all of my income through various income reporting\nforms and under any reasonable tax system, I should simply be able to signoff\non my tax return in five minutes without having to us Turbo Tax every filing\nseason.Tax simplification can relieve taxpayer headaches and raise more\nrevenue at the same time.
