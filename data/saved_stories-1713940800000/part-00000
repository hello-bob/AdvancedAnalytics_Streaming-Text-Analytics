April 2024\n\nAfter I missed this year's CSS Naked Day on 9th of April, I'm happy to\nparticipate to the JS Naked Day on 24th of April.\n\nMy website is not yet ready to work without CSS. All images miss static size\ntags and everything is messed up and is not usable without CSS right now. So\nhopefully next year, my website will be ready for CSS Naked Day.\n\n## Why no JS is important?\n\nThe web should work without JavaScript.\n\nThis is the first statement on the JS Naked Day's website. I totally agree\nwith this. So many sites are overblown with JS scripts that could work also\nwithout it.\n\nI can understand that in some cases JS is useful and makes sense, but I feel\nthat more times the opposite is true. My favorite \"overblown JS moments\" are,\nwhen I open a website and my laptop fan starts blowing out of nowhere. That\nalways reminds me how important the right usage of JS is.\n\nYou can find more interesting reasons to avoid JS on the JS Naked Day's\nwebsite.\n\n## This will never have JS\n\nMy main philosophy for this website is to have no JS at all, never, period. So\nI had no JS to be removed or similar for JS Naked Day, just write this blog\npost :-)\n\nI use zola, a static site generator, similar to hugo, but in my opinion still\nless bloated and kept simple. JS could be used, but I try to do everything\nwithout it, like here: CSS only dark mode without JS\n\nOf course my website is really simple and has no sophisticated user\ninteraction or similar, but shouldn't be most websites like this?\n\n### Every feedback is welcome\n\nFeel free to write me an email at info@simondalvai.org and comment on Mastodon\nor HackerNews.\n\nPrivacy Policy \u00a92022-2024 Simon Dalvai CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n", "frontpage": false}
