Bigfoot? Some elaborate practical joke by a prank TV\nshow? It's likely none of those \u2014 so why do people sometimes hear their names\nor other words being called when no one is actually saying anything? And is it\never something to worry about?\n\nThe phenomenon of hearing intelligible voices or noises in meaningless\nbackground noise is known as \"auditory pareidolia.\" The sources of this noise\nvary; they may include electric fans; running water; airplane engines; the\nhums of washing machines; or white-noise machines, according to audiologists.\nIt is an auditory sub-type of pareidolia, in which people see faces or other\nmeaningful patterns in ambiguous images.\n\nAuditory pareidolia isn't considered a type of auditory hallucination, which\noccurs when a person hears sounds that don't exist in reality and transpire\nappear without any external stimulus, such as white noise. Such hallucinations\nare common in various mental conditions, including schizophrenia, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder. Non-psychiatric hallucinations\nhave also been reported by those with hearing loss, although the condition,\nknown as musical ear syndrome, is relatively rare and understudied.\n\nBut people with and without these conditions can experience auditory\npareidolia, which emerges specifically from background noise.\n\nRelated: Why do people feel like they're being watched, even when no one is\nthere?\n\nBut why does auditory pareidolia happen in the first place?\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\"Think of your brain as having this big database of patterns. All the words\nthat you know, and you've ever heard in your life are in there,\" Neil Bauman,\nan audiologist and CEO of the Center for Hearing Loss Help based in\nWashington, told Live Science. \"It chooses what it thinks is the best pattern.\nThat best pattern may not be right at all. In fact, it could be way out.\"\n\nThe sounds a person hears when experiencing auditory pareidolia aren't\ncompletely invented by our brains. Rather, they stem from a misperception of\nreal sounds \u2014 for example, an unexpected peak in a static signal or in the\nbackground noise coming from a forest.\n\n\"The patterns in most noise sources change all the time,\" Andrew King,\ndirector of the Centre for Integrative Neuroscience at the University of\nOxford, told Live Science. \"Take white noise: Averaged over time, it becomes\nflat, but there will be certain points where the pattern is slightly\ndifferent. That may be enough to trigger a person to recognize something.\"\n\nKing attributes auditory pareidolia to our brain's constant attempts to make\nsense of and find patterns in the world around us. It can be especially likely\nto occur when somewhat recognizable noises are masked by the background hum of\na noisy environment, such as a restaurant or a bar.\n\nIn these cases, the brain utilizes a process called contrast gain control,\nadjusting the sensitivity of brain cells that respond to auditory and visual\ndata so they can adapt to the constant input.\n\n\"A highly evolved capacity to maximize the likelihood of being able to hear\ncommunication or other sounds may be very important,\" King said. In other\nwords, humans may be wired to listen for snippets of language in a din of\nbackground noise, even if they\u2019re not necessarily there.\n\nRELATED Mysteries\n\n\u2014Can you hear yourself snore?\n\n\u2014What happens in our brains when we 'hear' our own thoughts?\n\n\u2014Misophonia: Why do some sounds drive people crazy?\n\nDespite being commonly reported, auditory pareidolia is not as well studied by\nneuroscientists as its visual counterpart. That's in part because the triggers\nthat can make people mishear certain sounds are not as consistent or\npredictable as those that may make them falsely recognize faces, such as the\nman in the moon.\n\n\"To what extent this is a \"bottom-up\" process \u2014 driven by the statistics of\nthe stimuli \u2014 as opposed to a \"top-down,\" attention-based mechanism is pretty\nunclear,\" King said. Bottom-up processing relies on the brain piecing together\nbits of stimuli to make sense of them, while top-down processing is more\ndriven by our expectations and prior knowledge.\n\n\"You will be more likely, probably, to pick out something that's familiar to\nyou, but that's purely speculation,\" King said. He thinks it's \"probably a\ntop-down process.\"\n\nSo, if you ever hear your name called from the dark depths of an abandoned\nforest, you might not need to turn and flee in the other direction. But if you\nare concerned you\u2019re hearing voices where no sound exists, it may be worth\ngetting professional help.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer\nmedical advice.\n\nBen Turner\n\nStaff Writer\n\nBen Turner is a U.K. based staff writer at Live Science.
