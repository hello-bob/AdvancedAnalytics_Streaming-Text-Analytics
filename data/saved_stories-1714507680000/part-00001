Moreover, also the relations of these and so on.With a double click\non \"PROJECT\" the table \"PROJECT_PARTICIPATION\" opens and with it connected\n\"PROJECT\".We can minimize the \"PROJECT_PARTIPITATION\" table......to see the\nrelationship between employees and projects directly.\n\n### The way to the SQL console\n\nFrom the network of interconnected tables on the desktop, we can automatically\ncreate an SQL query that will retrieve exactly the same data that can be seen\nhere.Use the menu item \"Query Builder (Ctrl+Q)\" to make some adjustments to\nthis query first. Use \"SQL Console (Ctrl+Enter)\" to go directly to the SQL\nconsole.Using the console, we can then make whatever queries we want, view the\nresults, and do all the things we usually do with such tools.\n\n### Video\n\n### Exporting data using the Data Browser  \n  \n---\n\n", "frontpage": false}
