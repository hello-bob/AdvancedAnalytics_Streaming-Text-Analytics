The\nplatform is a thorn in the side of the movie industry and a prime exhibit in\nthe quest for local site-blocking measures. According to SimilarWeb's Top 10\nchart of U.S. 'Streaming & Online TV' sites, FMovies beats Disney+ and\nCrunchyroll.\n\nFor a long time, pirate site blocking was regarded as a topic most U.S.\npoliticians would rather avoid.\n\nThat\u2019s no longer the case...\n\nIn recent years calls for a U.S. site-blocking regime have started to flare\nup. Last week, MPA CEO Charles Rivkin used his keynote speech at CinemaCon to\ndouble down on this demand, urging U.S. lawmakers to seriously consider site\nblocking, now that it\u2019s proven to work in dozens of other countries.\n\n## Exhibit A: FMovies\n\nMPA\u2019s boss wasn\u2019t secretive about the top target either. At a previous hearing\nin Congress, MPA\u2019s Karyn Temple already gave lawmakers a walkthrough of the\npopular pirate streaming site FMovies and, in his CinemaCon speech, Rivkin put\nthe same site under the spotlight.\n\n\u201cOne of the largest illegal streaming sites in the world, FMovies, sees over\n160 million visits per month and because other nations already passed site\nblocking legislation, a third of that traffic still comes from the United\nStates,\u201d Rivkin said.\n\nRightsholders can dramatize statistics but, in this case, the \u2018threat\u2019 might\neven be somewhat underplayed. According to SimilarWeb\u2019s most recent traffic\nstatistics, FMovies had more than 190 million visits in March. Nearly 40% of\nthose visits are attributed to U.S. visitors.\n\n## More Visits Than Disney+\n\nThe site\u2019s popularity continues to grow; FMovies just climbed to the 9th spot\nin SimilarWeb\u2019s U.S. \u201cStreaming & Online TV\u201d category. This top ten listing is\neven more impressive if we consider the level of competition the pirate site\nis up against.\n\nThe top three slots are occupied by YouTube, Max, and Netflix, which are all\nmulti-billion dollar operations. FMovies doesn\u2019t come close to these, but it\nbeats Disney+ in 10th place, and Crunchyroll just behind at 11th.\n\nTop \u2018Streaming & Online TV\u2019 sites\n\nThese comparisons don\u2019t show the full picture. While FMovies has more U.S.\nweb-based visits than the other two, app traffic isn\u2019t counted. Disney+ likely\nhas more app-related traffic. Still, the top ten listing signals that FMovies\nis massively popular in the United States.\n\n## U.S. Congress Visit\n\nAt the House Subcommittee Hearing last December, many lawmakers were surprised\nto see how easily the site can be accessed. U.S. Representative Ted Lieu\ntested this live as he accessed FMovies on his phone during the proceeding.\n\n\u201cI just went on my phone and went on FMovies and it\u2019s still up. And I can\nwatch Willy Wonka for free without paying for it. Why don\u2019t the online service\nproviders block it right now, like today?\u201d Lieu asked.\n\nWith no Internet providers present at the hearing, this question remained\nunanswered. However, ISPs are not likely to act voluntarily, at least not\nwithout assurances.\n\nOne of the main reasons why site blocking hasn\u2019t come to the U.S. yet is the\nabsence of no-fault injunctive relief. That would allow for court orders,\ncompelling Internet providers to take action, without imposing any type of\nliability.\n\n## Lots to Gain, Much to Lose\n\nThe recent traffic numbers confirm that FMovies is a major threat to Hollywood\nand we expect it to serve as \u201cExhibit A\u201d in the site blocking discussions\ngoing forward.\n\nBlocking access to websites isn\u2019t a perfect anti-piracy tool and rightsholders\nknow that. There are plenty of options to circumvent these measures, as we\nhave seen in other countries where these were implemented.\n\nThat said, blockades undoubtedly make it harder to access websites and\nacademic research suggests that the overall effects on legitimate consumption\nare positive.\n\nWhile FMovies hasn\u2019t responded to the controversy, there must be some concern\nthere too. The site isn\u2019t fazed by copyright law but does rely on advertising\nrevenue, and it\u2019s no secret that advertisement rates for U.S. traffic are the\nhighest, by far. If U.S. traffic tanks, that will certainly be felt.\n\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * Fmovies\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\nLaw and Politics\n\n### Pirate Site Blocking Demands Intensify as U.S. Lawmakers Get Fmovies\nWalkthrough\n\n  * December 14, 2023, 19:28 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nPiracy\n\n### Vietnam Forms Specialist Unit to Tackle Pirate Sites Linked to \u201cOrganized\nCrime\u201d\n\n  * October 18, 2023, 18:51 by Andy Maxwell\n\nPiracy\n\n### Fmovies Gets Huge Visitor Boost, Users Spooked By Surge in Malware\nWarnings\n\n  * August 24, 2023, 21:07 by Andy Maxwell\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nDisaster as \u201cNFT Music Stream\u201d Enrages Artists By Pulling Music From YouTube\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nDisaster as \u201cNFT Music Stream\u201d Enrages Artists By Pulling Music From YouTube\n\nDisney Wants to Reinforce Its \u2018Piracy Intelligence\u2019 Team\n\nPublisher Targets University Researchers for \u201cPirating\u201d Their Own Articles\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14951\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": false}
