Measure EEG with Arduino\n\nMany years ago, like probably many others, I began to learn about electronics\nthrough amazing Arduino boards. Now, I created and started testing the ardEEG\nshield for Arduino UNO R4 WiFi to read EEG, EMG, and ECG signals. In other\nwords, the ardEEG shield can convert Arduino UNO R4 WiFi into a brain-computer\ninterface which soon will be available in our partner market place Elecrow\nMost importantly, if anyone wants to contribute software to open source for\nArduino, write to me, and do it together Dear Friends, great news!
