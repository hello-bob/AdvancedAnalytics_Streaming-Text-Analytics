Soda and Pop are\nthe most common terms for soft drinks nationally, although other terms are\nused, such as, in the South, Coke (a genericized name for Coca-Cola). Since\nindividual names tend to dominate regionally, the use of a particular term can\nbe an act of geographic identity.^[1]^[2] The choice of terminology is most\nclosely associated with geographic origin, rather than other factors such as\nrace, age, or income. The differences in naming have been the subject of\nscholarly studies. Cambridge linguist Bert Vaux, in particular, has studied\nthe \"pop vs. soda debate\" in conjunction with other regional vocabularies of\nAmerican English.^[3]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nAccording to writer Andrew Schloss, \"soda\" derives from sodium, a common\nmineral in natural springs, and was first used to describe carbonation in\n1802.^[4]\n\nShort article from the Washington Daily Star, District of Columbia, published\non July 6, 1854, using the word \"pop\" to describe a beverage\n\nThe earliest known usage of \"pop\" is from 1812; in a letter to his wife, poet\nRobert Southey says the drink is \"called pop because pop goes the cork when it\nis drawn, & pop you would go off too if you drank too much of it.\"^[5] The two\nwords were later combined into \"soda pop\" in 1863. Schloss gives the following\nyears as the first attestations of the various terms for these beverages:^[4]\n\nYear| Term  \n---|---  \n1798| Soda water  \n1809| Ginger pop  \n1812| Pop  \n1863| Soda pop  \n1880| Soft drink  \n1909| Coke  \n1920| Cola  \n  \n## Coke[edit]\n\nIn the Southern United States, \"coke\" is used as a generic term for any type\nof soft drink\u2014not just a Coca-Cola product or another cola. This terminology\nis also used in areas adjacent to the traditional southern states such as\nwestern Kentucky, Southern Indiana and New Mexico. Several other locations\nhave been found to use the generic \"coke\", such as Trinity County, California\nand White Pine County, Nevada,^[6] although the small populations of these\ncounties may skew survey results. A Twitter data scientist, however, found\nthat while \"soda\" and \"pop\" dominate in the United States, the word \"coke\"\n(incl. \"coca\" or \"cola\") is by far the most common in other countries,\nincluding English-speaking ones.^[7]\n\n## Pop[edit]\n\nPrice list at Chicago's Express Grill, showing the word \"pop\" at the bottom\n\n\"Pop\" is most commonly associated with the Midwest and in most of the West,\nincluding the Mountain West and the Pacific Northwest. These include Illinois,\nOhio, Minnesota, Michigan, Kansas, Oklahoma, Indiana, Iowa, Colorado, Oregon,\nWashington and Alaska.^[8]^[6]\n\n## Soda[edit]\n\n\"Soda\" is most common in the northeastern states, California, Nevada,\nArizona,^[9] as well as Hawaii and a wide enclave or pocket around the\nMidwestern cities of St. Louis, Missouri, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.^[6] To a\nlesser extent soda is also fairly common further down the east coast in\neastern Virginia, eastern Carolinas and coastal Florida. Here, soda is not too\ndominant but competes with multiple other terms such as \"coke\". Unlike other\nregions, the coastal south-east has a relatively higher degree of variance\nbetween local individuals in terms of what they prefer to designate their soft\ndrink.\n\nThe sharper \"soda/pop\" divide line runs through western Pennsylvania and\nwestern New York, approximately through the Rochester area. Those west of the\nline (e.g., in Pittsburgh and Buffalo) say \"pop\" while those east of the line\n(e.g. Syracuse) use \"soda\".\n\n## Other names[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

In some areas, \"tonic\" is still understood to mean \"soft drink\", but many regard it as an antiquated term.^[11]\n  * \"Soda pop\" is used by some speakers, especially in the Mountain West. \"Soda\" or \"drinks\" is common in Idaho and Utah.\n  * \"Drink\", \"cold drink\", \"carbo\", and \"soda\" are locally common in southern Virginia and the Carolinas, spreading from there as far as Louisiana.\n  * \"Soda water\" or \u201csodiewater\u201d is occasionally used in some rural parts of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.\n  * \"Soft drink\", \"cold drink\", or \"fountain drink\" is the phrase of choice in New Orleans and most of east Texas as far west as the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex (although in the DFW Metroplex itself the usage is somewhat colloquial). It is also commonly used along with \"soda\" and/or \"coke\" in Eastern North Carolina.^[12]\n  * \"Refresco\" is the term used in American Spanish, which literally translates to \"Refreshment\".\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of soft drinks by country#United States\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Friedman, Megan (September 15, 2012). \"Pop vs. Soda: A Regional Throwdown\".
