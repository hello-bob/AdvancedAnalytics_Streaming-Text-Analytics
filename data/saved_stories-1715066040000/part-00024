It\u2019s that we don\u2019t yet have enough trained\nworkers to install heat pumps for full-tilt decarbonization.\n\nPhotograph: Tristan Spinski/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nIf billionaires actually cared about saving the planet, they\u2019d pool their vast\nwealth and buy everyone a heat pump. Instead of burning planet-warming fossil\nfuels, these appliances extract warmth from even freezing outdoor air and\ntransfer it into a building, thanks to neat tricks of physics. In the summer,\nthey reverse to act like an air-conditioning unit. One recent study found that\nif everyone in the United States got a heat pump, it\u2019d slash emissions in the\nbuilding sector by 36 to 64 percent, and cut overall national emissions by 5\nto 9 percent. (Because they\u2019re fully electric, heat pumps run on a grid\nincreasingly loaded with renewable energy.)\n\nNot that billionaires would ever have the altruism or desire to buy us all\nheat pumps\u2014megayachts aren\u2019t going to buy themselves, after all. But if they\ndid, there\u2019d be one critical hurdle they\u2019d run into\u2014the one thing that\u2019s\nholding heat pumps back from their full potential more generally: There aren\u2019t\nenough trained workers yet to install them.\n\n\u201cNo one talks about supply chain constraints anymore. What is now the\nbottleneck is actually the installer,\u201d says Philipp Krinner, CEO and cofounder\nof Arch, a platform that helps HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-\nconditioning) companies manage customers. \u201cIn the winter and in the summer\u2014in\nthe peak seasons\u2014when most people actually want to install a system, it\u2019s\nactually still a contractor-constrained market.\u201d\n\nFeatured Video\n\nThe result is classic \u201cgreenflation,\u201d a temporary rise in the costs associated\nwith decarbonization due to market constraints, says climate economist Gernot\nWagner of the Columbia Business School in New York. \u201cYes, there is a shortage\nof qualified contractors,\u201d he says. But it\u2019s a good problem to have, he\nargues, and \u201cone where there\u2019s an obvious solution\u201d on the road to\ndecarbonizing our civilization. It\u2019ll be costly to train more workers in the\ngreen economy, but that\u2019ll end up paying huge dividends.\n\n\u201cElectricians get talked about a lot, and used as sort of an avatar for all of\nthe jobs that are going to be needed to install heat pumps and decarbonize the\neconomy,\u201d says Alexandria Herr, senior research associate at Rewiring America,\na nonprofit that promotes electrification. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just\nelectricians\u2014it\u2019s actually a whole range of different jobs across the\nconstruction trades.\u201d Qualified workers are needed to determine what kind of\nheat pump a home or business requires, to install the things, and then to\nservice them. A heat pump is fundamentally different from a gas-fired furnace,\nand it requires fundamentally different training.\n\nThat would include workers specializing in \u201cweatherization\u201d\u2014better insulating\nhomes so heat pumps get even more efficient. And we\u2019ll need specialists to\nretrofit the grid so it can smoothly transition to handling the ebb and flow\nof renewable energy, which is what makes heat pumps so climate-friendly. And\nwe\u2019ll need workers in manufacturing to produce the units themselves.\n\nAnd we need these people ASAP. Heat pump sales are already outpacing the sale\nof gas furnaces in the US. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides\nthousands of dollars in tax rebates and credits for households to both switch\nto a heat pump and pay for the electrical upgrades that may be required to run\nthe appliances. Last year, the Biden administration announced $169 million to\nsupercharge the domestic manufacturing of whole heat pumps and their\nindividual components. And in February, nine states signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding to accelerate the adoption of heat pumps.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 17 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

What\u2019s lagging is the workforce\u2014at least temporarily. And the US\nis nowhere near alone: Wherever heat pump adoption is growing, more workers\nneed to train up to meet demand. \u201cIf you look at a place like, say, Finland,\nwhere pretty much all your heating systems are heat pumps, this is not really\nan issue anymore,\u201d says Jan Rosenow, who studies electrification at the\nRegulatory Assistance Project, a policy NGO for the energy community. \u201cIf you\nwanted to buy an electric car 10 years ago, it was quite difficult, wasn\u2019t it?\nNow, you can go to any showroom and you can find them. I think the same is\ngoing to be the case with heat pumps. It\u2019s already the case with heat pumps in\nmore mature markets.\u201d\n\nIn the US, though, we don\u2019t have some sort of giant, national program to\nquickly get more people trained in HVAC. \u201cIt would just make sense that there\nwould be this path to learn more about heat pumps, and then there would be a\nwhole armed force to go out and install these things,\u201d says Ed Janowiak,\nmanager of HVAC and refrigeration design education at the nonprofit Air\nConditioning Contractors of America. \u201cThere is such an opportunity right now\nfor people to get in on the ground level. It should not take them very long to\nmake a decent wage at it. And I still sit here at times with my palms in the\nair as to why it isn\u2019t just automatically happening.\u201d\n\nThere isn\u2019t one official pathway in the US for HVAC workers, but several.\nTrade schools and community colleges provide HVAC training. Trade unions offer\napprenticeships, and many HVAC companies run their own training programs to\nget people into the trade. \u201cThe most successful companies right now that are\nfinding these people to install, they\u2019re not necessarily hiring people that\nare already in the field,\u201d says Janowiak. \u201cBut if you look at the number of\ntechnicians that go through those programs nationally, versus the demand, it\u2019s\njust not there. So we need a lot more people.\u201d\n\nFor veteran HVAC workers already trained in fossil-fuel systems, like\ninstalling gas furnaces, heat pump manufacturers provide their own training to\ninstall their products, which is of course in their interest. HVAC companies\nalso do their own heat pump training for established workers, which usually\ntakes two days. If a home has ducting, a heat pump will work similarly to a\ntraditional AC unit, so the installation is nearly identical.\n\nBut all these workers don\u2019t just have to be trained, but trained well, lest\nthey inadvertently turn customers off of the energy-efficient appliances just\nas the heat pump revolution is getting going. If the size of the heat pump\ndoesn\u2019t suit the size of the home, or the ducting within, it won\u2019t be as\nefficient. If you don\u2019t have ducting, a contractor might recommend a simpler\nductless heat pump, which is set into an outside-facing wall. \u201cMy biggest hope\nis that those people who do end up installing these, do get trained wisely,\u201d\nsays Janowiak, \u201cand they do install pieces of equipment that work the way we\nwant them to.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 17 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

The company\nuses the homes to train workers new to the heating industry\u2014it directly\nemploys these folks during the education process, so they get paid\u2014but also to\nreskill veterans who\u2019ve been installing fossil-fuel systems. \u201cActually, we\ndon\u2019t really have a skill shortage at all\u2014we just have a set of people that\nare installing the wrong product,\u201d says John Szymik, CEO of Octopus Energy\nServices. \u201cWe built those [model homes] in order to show people how you\u2019d\noptimize a rollout for the mass market.\u201d\n\nWorking in an older UK home, for instance, technicians need to account for\nmuch worse insulation than in a modern home. The size of the home matters, as\ndoes the number of occupants and kinds of windows. All that data goes into a\ncalculation that Octopus uses to determine the size of the heat pump. \u201cThose\nhomes are really, really helpful for our surveyors\u2019 understanding of how to go\naround and measure up,\u201d says Szymik. Then during a heat pump installation in\nthe real world, a newly trained worker would join a crew of more experienced\ntechnicians. \u201cWhat you get there is the opportunity to blend your people that\nhave been working on this for a while, have more experience, with the people\nthat are coming into it fresh with slightly less experience.\u201d\n\nA new breed of heat pumps is also making it possible for some people to skip\nhiring a trained installer entirely. The New York City Housing Authority, for\ninstance, is deploying units that slip over a window sill and plug into the\nwall. One of the companies making that type, Gradient, says that a resident\ncan install one in less than an hour, in contrast to a team of technicians\ninstalling a traditional heat pump in about a day. For an apartment dweller\nwithout ducting, this might be an ideal option that skips the extra step of\nhaving a contractor analyze the space and deploy a more complicated system.\n\nThe other option is to just hope the heat pump revolution unfolds smoothly on\nits own: Maybe the HVAC industry will meet that demand with American-made\ndevices installed by newly trained workers. Finland, after all, eventually\nfound its way. \u201cThere may well be the need for large-scale retraining\nprograms,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m too much of a business school\neconomist\u2014please excuse me of that\u2014but frankly, one answer is to simply get\nout of the way and let the market do its thing.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * He emptied a crypto exchange onto a thumb drive\u2014then disappeared\n\n  * The real-time deepfake romance scams have arrived\n\n  * Boomergasms are booming\n\n  * Heading outdoors?
