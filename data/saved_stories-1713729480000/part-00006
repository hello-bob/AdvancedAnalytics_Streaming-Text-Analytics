Most of this advice won't\nnecessarily apply to fiction writing, academic writing, or technical\ndocumentation writing... but it might help.\n\n## Opening Essays and Other Pieces of Narrative Writing\n\nMost of the\n\nnarrative non-fiction\n\nopinion pieces I read online do not grip me in the first sentence. People\noften start pieces somewhere sensible, but boring. Like the chronological\nstart of a story.\n\n\u201cI first became interested in data structures 17 years ago while pursuing my\nundergraduate degree. I was reminded of them last week, and decided to write\nup some notes on what I've learned since then.\u201d\n\nThe beginning is almost never the most compelling or important part. It's just\nthe bit you thought of first, based on your subjective chronology.\n\nOr far worse, people begin at The Beginning Of Time. Invoking\n\npaleolithic people\n\nis an overplayed way to convince us your topic is cosmically important.\n\n\u201cFor tens of thousands of years, humans have relied on their fingers to do\nthings in the world. Fingers have carved rocks, thrown spears, sewn clothes,\nand held Doritos. Fingers are essential to our survival. And now, I want to\nshow you how to treat your fingers well by reviewing the top 10 mechanical\nkeyboards on the market in 2024.\u201d\n\nAnother bad way to start a piece of writing is with a statement of what you're\ngoing to write about, followed by a definition.\n\n\u201cThis post will outline the most common misconceptions in astronomy. Astronomy\nis the scientific study of celestial objects such as the stars and planets,\nand misconceptions are falsely held beliefs by a large number of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad\u201d is obviously subjective and contextual here. I find up-front outlines\nand definitions dull for\n\nnarrative non-fiction\n\nwriting. But they're standard practice for technical documentation and\nacademic papers. Signposting what you're going to write about is good, but\nstarting with an exhaustive list of definitions is extremely boring.\n\nTo be clear, I make these mistakes too. I am a mediocre opener trying to\nbecome a good opener. Opening well isn't just about snapping up someone's\nattention and keeping them reading for a few lines. You can't write good\nopenings without having good ideas, good arguments, good structure, and good\nstorytelling skills. Everything hangs off that starting point, so it's worth\nlearning how to nail it.\n\n### Tense, Paradoxical, and Problematic Openings\n\nIn trying to become a better opener, I've collected explicit advice from a few\nbooks on writing: Stephen Pinker's\n\nA Sense of Style\n\n, John McPhee's\n\nDraft No.4\n\n, and Joseph Williams'\n\nProblems into PROBLEMS\n\n. Alongside implicit advice from studying lots of classic essayists like\n\nDavid Foster Wallace\n\n,\n\nRebecca Solnit\n\n,\n\nDavid Graeber\n\n, and\n\nJoan Didion\n\n.\n\nI'm not going to be winning any originality awards for this lot \u2013 hard to pick\na more clich\u00e9 array.\n\nIf you dislike the way these authors write, it's best to check out now.\n\nPinker, McPhee, and Williams each lay out different sets of principles for\ncompelling openings, which I'll get into in a moment, but for me they all boil\ndown to this: Openings need tension \u2013 paradoxes, unanswered questions, and\nunresolved action.\n\nGood openings propose problems, pose questions, drop you into an unfinished\nstory, or point at fundamental tensions within a topic. Ideally within the\nfirst paragraph or two.\n\n\"Good writing starts strong. Not with a clich\u00e9 (\"Since the dawn of time\"), not\nwith a banality (\"Recently, scholars have been increasingly concerned with the\nquestions of...\"), but with a contentful observation that provokes curiosity.\"\n\nA Sense of Style\n\nStephen Pinker\n\nHere's a good example of this from the opening of David Graeber's book\n\nBullshit Jobs\n\nwhere he sets up a clear paradox: our technological advances should have led\nto fewer working hours, but they haven't. Strange.\n\n\u201cIn the year 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that, by century's end,\ntechnology would have advanced sufficiently that countries like Great Britain\nor the United States would have achieved a 15-hour work week. There's every\nreason to believe he was right. In technological terms, we are quite capable\nof this. And yet it didn't happen. Instead, technology has been marshaled, if\nanything, to figure out ways to make us all work more.\u201d\n\nBullshit Jobs\n\nDavid Graeber\n\nHere's another one from David Foster Wallace that asks a series of rhetorical\nquestions to which the presumed answers is \u201cof course not!\u201d And also, \u201chow in\nthe world is something as dull as lexicography filled with drama?\u201d An\nunexpected contrast.\n\n\u201cDid you know that probing the seamy underbelly of U.S. lexicography reveals\nideological strife and controversy and intrigue and nastiness and fervor on a\nnearly hanging-chad scale? For instance, did you know that some modern\ndictionaries are notoriously liberal and others notoriously conservative, and\nthat certain conservative dictionaries were actually conceived and designed as\ncorrective responses to the \"corruption\" and \"permissiveness\" of certain\nliberal dictionaries?\u201d\n\nTense Present: Democracy, English, and the Wars Over Usage\n\nDavid Foster Wallace\n\nI'm certainly not against a slightly slower narrative opening that sets the\nscene before making the puzzle or conundrum clear, but you can't take too long\nto get there. Here's a more drawn out one from Rebecca Solnit that gives you\nsome scenic details before pointing out the curiosity; priviledged tech\nworkers in San Fransisco fail to understand why locals hate them.\n\n\u201cThe young woman at the blockade was worried about the banner the Oaklanders\nbrought, she told me, because she and her co-organisers had tried to be\ncareful about messaging. But the words FUCK OFF GOOGLE in giant letters on a\npurple sheet held up in front of a blockaded Google bus gladdened the hearts\nof other San Franciscans. That morning \u2013 it was Tuesday, 21 January \u2013 about\nfifty locals were also holding up a Facebook bus: a gleaming luxury coach\ntransporting Facebook employees down the peninsula to Silicon Valley.\n\nOne protester shook a sign on a stick in front of the Google bus; a young\nGoogle employee decided to dance with it, as though we were all at the same\nparty. We weren\u2019t. One of the curious things about the crisis in San Francisco\n\u2013 precipitated by a huge influx of well-paid tech workers driving up housing\ncosts and causing evictions, gentrification and cultural change \u2013 is that they\nseem unable to understand why many locals don\u2019t love them.\u201d\n\nGet Off the Bus\n\nRebecca Solnit\n\nLondon Review of Books\n\nPutting the word FUCK in all caps in your opening is a valid way to get\npeople's attention, but you'll need to back it up with a good story.\n\nUnlike the dozens of Mark Manson-ites who have cheaply used the sacred word to\nsell crappy self-help books like Unf\u2736ck Yourself, Grow the F\u2736ck Up, and The\nF\u2736ck It Diet.\n\nLet's have another Rebecca Solnit one because she's so damn good at this.\nHere's an opening for a piece on how we shouldn't think about fixing climate\nclimate as a swift, immediate task, but instead a slow, gradual, persistent\nchallenge.\n\n\u201cSomeone at the dinner table wanted to know what everyone\u2019s turning point on\nclimate was, which is to say she wanted us to tell a story with a pivotal\nmoment. She wanted sudden; all I had was slow, the story of a journey with\nmany steps, gradual shifts, accumulating knowledge, concern, and commitment. A\nlot had happened but it had happened in many increments over a few decades,\nnot via one transformative anything.\n\nPeople love stories of turning points, wake-up calls, sudden conversions,\nbreakthroughs, the stuff about changes that happen in a flash. Movies love\nthem as love at first sight, dramatic speeches that change everything, trouble\nthat can be terminated by shooting one bad guy, and other easy fixes and\ndefinitive victories. Old-school radicals love them as the kind of revolution\nthat they imagine will change everything suddenly, even though a change of\nregime isn\u2019t a change of culture and consciousness.\u201d\n\nSlow Change Can Be Radical Change\n\nRebecca Solnit\n\n### Finding Tension, Paradoxes and Problems\n\nFiction writers have it easy. When they hear that stories should start \u201cin the\nmiddle of the action,\u201d they can make it so. They can open with the main\ncharacter's feet dangling off the edge of a cliff with a fiery pit below (or\nsomething less heavy-handed and melodramatic).\n\nCreating tension in non-fiction work is trickier because your story is\n(hopefully) constrained by reality. You are not at liberty to invent\nsuspicious murders, salacious extramarital affairs, or newly-discovered-\nmagical-powers to create tension and mystery. You have to deal with the plain,\nunexotic facts of the world.\n\nYour challenge is finding the compelling problem in your topic, and clearly\npresenting it up front. That problem might be deeply buried under a bunch of\nboring facts and informational details. It might be hard to figure out what it\nis, and hard to describe once you've found it.\n\nYour job becomes much harder if you pick topics with no tension, problems, or\npuzzles within them. To paraphrase Williams, it is more of a failure to pose\nan uninteresting problem, than to poorly articulate an interesting one.\n\nYour interest in the topic is your best directional clue for finding the\ntension or interesting paradox. Your urge to write about the thing hopefully\ncomes from a place of curiosity. You have unanswered questions about it. It\nfeels important or consequential for unexplained reasons. You think you've\nseen things in it other people haven't. Pay attention to that interest.\n\nJoseph Williams has some good advice for finding and clearly stating these\nparadoxes and problems. In Part I of \u201c\n\nProblems into PROBLEMS\n\n\u201d, he lays out a slightly formulaic, but useful way of thinking about\nproblems.\n\nProblems are a destabilising condition that has a cost for a community of\nreaders that needs a solution. Destabilising condition is just a fancy word\nfor \u201cchange\u201d here \u2013 a change in the status quo. Put another way, a problem is\nan expected turn of events, that has undesireable consequences, for an\naudience who will care about it, that we want to explore solutions to.\n\nThe change here could be a new technological or cultural development like\ncarbon sequestration, web components, critical race theory, or crowd funding.\nOr it could be a single event like someone making an influential speech or\nstepping down as a leader.\n\nThe change doesn't have to be bad and the consequences aren't necessarily\nnegative. It's simply that the state of the world has shifted, and there are\nknock-on effects that your community (a.k.a. your readers, or\n\nassumed audience\n\n) should care about and explore solutions or responses to. These are changes\nthey need to react to in some way, even if we don't yet have a clear solution.\n\nHere's an examples from Williams:\n\nRecently, the thinning of the ozone layer has allowed sunlight to reach the\nearth unfiltered. CHANGE As a result, we are going to have more cancer and\nhigher medical costs. CONSEQUENCES for a COMMUNITY We can avoid these\nconsequences only if we ban chemicals that degrade ozone. SOLUTION / RESPONSE\n\nProblems into PROBLEMS\n\nJoseph Williams\n\nIt's a good exercise to read openings in essays or news articles and try to\nidentify these. They don't always appear in order, and they're usually spread\nover the first few paragraphs. Here's another example from a New York Times\nopinion piece:\n\nAadhaar, India\u2019s grand program to provide a unique 12-digit identification\nnumber to each of its 1.3 billion residents, appears to be collapsing under\nits own ambitions. CHANGE\n\nSo far, [it] seems to have helped neither with welfare nor against corruption,\nall the while creating new problems, including by exposing people\u2019s personal\ndata to theft or predation by the private sector. CONSEQUENCES for a COMMUNITY\n\nGiven the many ways in which the system is broken, at the very least it should\nbe made voluntary again, and the data of anyone who opts out should be\ndestroyed. SOLUTION / RESPONSE\n\nWhy India\u2019s Big Fix Is a Big Flub\n\nReetika Khera\n\nThe New York Times\n\nThese examples are clearly a bit simplified and boring. Williams is speaking\nto a community of academic writers in his book. They're trying to present\nscientific and research problems in plain, objective language, which isn't\nnecessarily what we want to do with narrative writing like blogging or\npersonal essays.\n\nWe have a little more liberty to put interesting padding around the change,\nconsequences, and solution, such as telling an opening anecdote, or drawing\nreaders in with characters, rich details, and sensory descriptions.\n\n### Consequential Problems\n\nOur first idea of the \u201cproblem\u201d is often not consequential enough and we have\nto dig deeper to find more compelling underlying problems. Williams suggests\nwe try to state our problem and then ask a series of so what?'s to get at the\nunderlying problem. Let's try it.\n\nStarting problem Language models are able to write text that looks just like a\nhuman wrote it.\n\nSo what?\n\nWe won't be able to tell whether a language model or a human wrote something.\nLanguage models can write much faster than humans, and the volume of text they\ngenerate will overtake the volume humans can make.\n\nSo what?\n\nLanguage models don't have accurate knowledge of the world and often\nhallucinate. Our already brittle and broken systems for vetting and\ndiseminating true statements about the world will become weaker.\n\nSo what?\n\nMisinformation and disinformation will spread even further and faster,\nfracturing our shared reality as a society. Shared truths and common ground\nwill die, threatening democratic governance systems and societal cohesion.\n\nWhether I can support that final problem with solid evidence and argue for it\nconvincingly is my job for the rest of the writing piece, but at least I've\nbegun with a compelling problem.\n\nFor your writing to be worth reading, you need to be exploring something of\nconsequence for someone. You have to have some kind of problem that matters.\nEven if it's a personal problem like a medical issue, career challenge, or\ndifficult technical bug, you're hopefully writing about it to help others\nencountering a similar situation.\n\n### Time, Place, Character, and Dramatic Action\n\nOnce you know you have a consequential problem for a community and some sense\nof a solution, you get to play with narrative details. This is the fun\nstorytelling part.\n\nThere's an opening style I've seen a lot in publications like The New Yorker\nand The Atlantic that effectively places us in a real time and place, with\nreal characters we want to follow along with. It goes like this:\n\nOn {date} in {place}, {character} did {strange / compelling / dramatic thing}.\n\nThe strange, compelling, or dramatic thing has to be extreme enough that we\nnow want to know much more about the character and how they came to be doing\nthis thing in this time and place.\n\nHere are some good examples of it:\n\n\u201cOn 23 May 2014, Elliot Rodger, a 22-year-old college dropout, became the\nworld\u2019s most famous \u2018incel\u2019 \u2013 involuntary celibate. The term can, in theory,\nbe applied to both men and women, but in practice it picks out not sexless men\nin general, but a certain kind of sexless man: the kind who is convinced he is\nowed sex, and is enraged by the women who deprive him of it. Rodger stabbed to\ndeath his two housemates, Weihan Wang and Cheng Hong, and a friend, George\nChen, as they entered his apartment on Seville Road in Isla Vista,\nCalifornia.\u201d\n\nDoes anyone have the right to sex?\n\nAmia Srinivasan\n\nLondon Review of Books\n\n\u201cOn the morning of August 26, 2021, a sweaty young American diplomat named Sam\nAronson stood in body armor near the end of a dusty service road outside the\nKabul airport, contemplating the end of his life or his career. Thirty-one and\nrecently married, 5 foot 10 without his combat helmet, Sam surveyed the scene\nat the intersection near the airport\u2019s northwest corner, where the unnamed\nservice road met a busy thoroughfare called Tajikan Road. Infected blisters\noozed in his socks.\u201d\n\nScrew the Rules\n\nMitchell Zuckoff\n\nThe Atlantic\n\nIt's a little formulaic, but it works well. It's pulling us into the scene\nwith rich sensory descriptions and specific details that point at the core\nproblems or tensions the writing will explore.\n\nHere's a more creative way of dropping the reader into the rich details of a\nscene without relying the time / place / character / action framework:\n\n\u201cI have now seen sucrose beaches and water a very bright blue. I have seen an\nall-red leisure suit with flared lapels. I have smelled suntan lotion spread\nover 2,100 pounds of hot flesh. I have been addressed as \"Mon\" in three\ndifferent nations. I have seen 500 upscale Americans dance the Electric Slide.\nI have seen sunsets that looked computer-enhanced. I have (very briefly)\njoined a conga line. I have seen a lot of really big white ships. I have seen\nschools of little fish with fins that glow. I have seen and smelled all 145\ncats inside the Ernest Hemingway residence in Key West, Florida.\u201d\n\nShipping Out\n\nDavid Foster Wallace\n\nHarpers Magazine, 1996\n\nDavid Foster Wallace is very good at rhythmic lists like this. It made me love\nlists.\n\n### Starting in the Middle\n\nI said before the chronological beginning is rarely the most compelling or\nimportant part of a story. If your story has a narrative over time (and almost\nall do, even if it's about why you like a hot\n\nnew JavaScript framework\n\n), you might need to start telling it in the middle, then jump back to the\nbeginning later on to fill readers in.\n\nJohn McPhee is the master of structuring narrative writing. If you're\nunfamiliar with his work, start with his\n\nessays\n\n, or consider his Pulitzer Prize winning\n\ntome\n\non the geological history of the United States. Anyway, the guy knows how to\nmake rocks consistently fascinating for 660 pages.\n\nIn his writing guide\n\nDraft No. 4\n\n, the chapter on structure is filled with wonderful diagrams like this:\n\nThese are the shapes of stories. When McPhee writes, after first immersing\nhimself in his raw material (field notes, interview transcripts, official\ndocuments) for weeks, he then draws a structure for the work. The structure\nlays out the major themes and scenes he'll work through, in the order that\nwill make them most compelling and coherent.\n\nDeveloping a structure requires navigating the tension between chronology and\ntheme. Chronology is what we default to, but themes that repeatedly appear\nwant to pull themselves together into a single place. The themes that really\nmatter should be in your opening. Even if the moment that best defines them\nhappens right before the end of the timeline.\n\n## Opening Conference Talks\n\nMost of the rules for opening pieces of writing apply to opening conference\ntalks, but they require more traditional signposting of what you're going to\ncover.\n\nLive conference talk audiences are trapped in a way reading audiences are not.\nThey can't close the tab on your presentation. So I try to quickly give them\nmore explanation of where my story is going and why it's worth their valuable\nattention.\n\nI've been trapped in plenty of audiences where we're 5 minutes into an\nanecdote about the speaker's childhood, and the whole room is desperately\ntrying to figure out what The Point is. This is cruel and frustrating.\n\nYou should make The Point clear as soon as possible. Somewhere in the first\nminute I make sure to say:\n\n  * This talk is about X: a compelling problem with consequences for this audience, for which I have some suggested solutions\n  * We're going to talk about A, B, C, and D, in that order\n\nHere are two of the opening slides from my\n\nExpanding Dark Forest and Generative AI\n\ntalk:\n\nThis outline isn't especially detailed, but now the audience has a map of\nwhere we're going. They understand the structure of my argument and can tell\nwhat I am and am not going to cover.\n\n## Opening Jam Jars\n\nTo open a jam jar, you should run it under a very hot tap. Resort to the\nkettle if your tap is lukewarm. The heat makes the metal lid expand faster\nthan the glass, which creates space between the lid and the jar.\n\nThen place a tea towel over lid, firmly grip the top, and twist. Repeat until\nyou run out of grip strength, and then recruit someone else to help. They will\neffortlessly pop it off for you. Do not skip the last step.\n\nSome people advise banging the jar lid on the counter-top to loosen it, but I\nonce smashed a pickle jar this way, showering myself in vingear, soggy dill,\nand tiny glass shards. I now believe it's not worth the risk.\n\nWant to share?\n\n### Want to stay up to date?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Maggie Appleton\n\n  * The Garden\n\n  * Essays\n\n  * About\n\n  * Notes\n\n  * Now\n\n  * Patterns\n\n  * Library\n\n  * Projects\n\n  * Colophon\n\n", "frontpage": false}
