Pic: Tracey Williams\n\nIn what Ms Williams calls a \"quite exciting\" development, a second Lego\noctopus was found just two days after Liutauras's discovery, this time in\nPorthleven.\n\n\"I think that's because we had a very high spring tide coupled with strong\nonshore winds and when the two collide, the waves eat into the dunes that then\nrelease a lot of the plastic that has washed up,\" she explained.\n\nMs Williams has been working on research related to the cargo spill and wrote\na book, called Adrift: The Curious Tale of The Lego Lost At Sea.\n\nImage: Other Lego pieces that have washed ashore. Tracey Williams/PA Wire\n\n\"I'm recording where it all washes up so we're working on a map that will form\npart of a scientific paper to show how far plastic from a cargo spill drifts\nand what happens to it over time,\" she said.\n\n\"What we'd like to find out is whether those containers still exist or whether\nthey've long since rusted away.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nShe added: \"I mean, it's intriguing to know what's happened to all the rest of\nthe Lego that we've never seen.\n\n\"There are so many cargoes spilled every year, but you very rarely hear what\nhappens to the goods inside and what we know from the Lego story is that\n27-year-old plastic that was inside that shipping container is still being\nfound.\"\n\n### Related Topics\n\n  * lego\n\n## Sky News footer\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n\n### About Sky News\n\n  * About Us\n  * Sky News Profiles\n  * Sky News International\n  * Sky News Library Sales\n  * Site Map\n  * Editorial Guidelines\n  * Sky News Board\n\n### Sky News Services\n\n  * Sky News RSS\n  * Sky News For Your Phone\n  * Sky News Radio\n\n### Sky Channels\n\n  * Sky Witness\n  * Sky Atlantic\n  * Sky Arts\n  * Sky Cinema\n  * Sky Sports\n\n### More Sky Sites\n\n  * NOW\n  * Sky Zero\n  * Sky Academy Studios\n  * Bigger Picture\n  * Sky Group\n  * Sky Bet\n  * Sky.com\n  * Sky News Arabia\n  * Advertise With Us\n\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy & Cookies\n  * Privacy Options\n  * Accessibility\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Sky UK\n\n", "frontpage": false}
