And generally, their software has\nbeen pretty good, too.\n\nBut a recent update added an \"AI Prompt generator\" feature to the mouse side\nof things, which is absolute garbage\u2014I'm not saying it's bad, as I've never\ntried it. It's garbage as in there's no reason my mouse needs an AI prompt\ngenerator connected to a button. Even worse, as Stephen Hackett discovered, it\ncreates a folder (at the top level of your home folder, no less!) with the\nugly name of ai_overlay_tmp.\n\nThankfully, when Stephen posted about this on Mastodon, user @flipneus posted\nthe solution. And in case that post ever goes away, here it is:\n\nIn Finder, open the top-level Library ? Application Support folder, then\nnavigate to Logitech ? LogiOptionsPlus, and open app_permission.json in your\nfavorite pure text editor. Add a comma after the last } in the file, then add\nthese lines:\n\n    \n    \n    \"aipromptbuilder\": { \"value\": false} }\n\nWhen done, the end of the file should look like this (though the commands in\nyours may differ):\n\n    \n    \n    ... \"backlight\": { \"value\": true }, \"aipromptbuilder\": { \"value\": false} }\n\nThe important part is the added comma after (in my file) the backlight-related\nsection. Save the file when done editing, and reboot.\n\nAfter the reboot, you can delete the ai_overlay_tmp folder\u2014and there won't be\nan AI generator option in the Logi Options+ app any more. (Alternatively,\nStephen points out you can use SteerMouse to program the buttons on the\nLogitech.)\n\nThank you, Stephen and @flipneus!\n\n### Related Posts:\n\n  * The Impossible MoveTM\n  * Speedier screen sharing startup in Sonoma\n  * Archiving and version control for Keyboard Maestro\n  * Search sites from anywhere via shortcuts, version 3.0\n  * Remove tracking data from copied URLs\n  * Search sites from anywhere via shortcuts, version two\n\nTags:Logitech\n\n## 1 thought on \u201cRemove the AI bloatware from Logitech\u2019s mouse driver\u201d\n\n  1.
