The chemical structure of most polymers is stable and\ndifferent enough from existing food sources that bacteria didn't have enzymes\nthat could digest them. Evolution has started to change that situation,\nthough, and a number of strains have been identified that can digest some\ncommon plastics.\n\nAn international team of researchers has decided to take advantage of those\nstrains and bundle plastic-eating bacteria into the plastic. To keep them from\neating it while it's in use, the bacteria is mixed in as inactive spores that\nshould (mostly\u2014more on this below) only start digesting the plastic once it's\nreleased into the environment. To get this to work, the researchers had to\nevolve a bacterial strain that could tolerate the manufacturing process. It\nturns out that the evolved bacteria made the plastic even stronger.\n\n## Bacteria meet plastics\n\nPlastics are formed of polymers, long chains of identical molecules linked\ntogether by chemical bonds. While they can be broken down chemically, the\nprocess is often energy-intensive and doesn't leave useful chemicals behind.\nOne alternative is to get bacteria to do it for us. If they've got an enzyme\nthat breaks the chemical bonds of a polymer, they can often use the resulting\nsmall molecules as an energy source.\n\nThe problem has been that the chemical linkages in the polymers are often\ndistinct from the chemicals that living things have come across in the past,\nso enzymes that break down polymers have been rare. But, with dozens of years\nof exposure to plastics, that's starting to change, and a number of plastic-\neating bacterial strains have been discovered recently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis breakdown process still requires that the bacteria and plastics find each\nother in the environment, though. So a team of researchers decided to put the\nbacteria in the plastic itself.\n\nThe plastic they worked with is called thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU),\nsomething you can find everywhere from bicycle inner tubes to the coating on\nyour ethernet cables. Conveniently, there are already bacteria that have been\nidentified that can break down TPU, including a species called Bacillus\nsubtilis, a harmless soil bacterium that has also colonized our digestive\ntracts. B. subtilis also has a feature that makes it very useful for this\nwork: It forms spores.\n\nThis feature handles one of the biggest problems with incorporating bacteria\ninto materials: The materials often don't provide an environment where living\nthings can thrive. Spores, on the other hand, are used by bacteria to wait out\notherwise intolerable conditions, and then return to normal growth when things\nimprove. The idea behind the new work is that B. subtilis spores remain in\nsuspended animation while the TPU is in use and then re-activate and digest it\nonce it's disposed of.\n\nIn practical terms, this works because spores only reactivate once nutritional\nconditions are sufficiently promising. An Ethernet cable or the inside of a\nbike tire is unlikely to see conditions that will wake the bacteria. But if\nthat same TPU ends up in a landfill or even the side of the road, nutrients in\nthe soil could trigger the spores to get to work digesting it.\n\nThe researchers' initial problem was that the manufacturing of TPU products\nusually involves extruding the plastic at high temperatures, which are\nnormally used to kill bacteria. In this case, they found that a typical\nmanufacturing temperature (130\u00b0 C) killed over 90 percent of the B. subtilis\nspores in just one minute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, they started out by exposing B. subtilis spores to lower temperatures and\nshort periods of heat that were enough to kill most of the bacteria. The\nsurvivors were grown up, made to sporulate, and then exposed to a slightly\nlonger period of heat or even higher temperatures. Over time, B. subtilis\nevolved the ability to tolerate a half hour of temperatures that would kill\nmost of the original strain. The resulting strain was then incorporated into\nTPU, which was then formed into plastics through a normal extrusion process.\n\nYou might expect that putting a bunch of biological material into a plastic\nwould weaken it. But the opposite turned out to be true, as various measures\nof its tensile strength showed that the spore-containing plastic was stronger\nthan pure plastic. It turns out that the spores have a water-repelling surface\nthat interacts strongly with the polymer strands in the plastic. The heat-\nresistant strain of bacteria repelled water even more strongly, and plastics\nmade with these spores was tougher still.\n\nTo simulate landfilling or litter with the plastic, the researchers placed\nthem in compost. Even without any bacteria, there were organisms present that\ncould degrade it; by five months in the compost, plain TPU lost nearly half\nits mass. But with B. subtilis spores incorporated, the plastic lost 93\npercent of its mass over the same time period.\n\nThis doesn't mean our plastics problem is solved. Obviously, TPU breaks down\nrelatively easily. There are lots of plastics that don't break down\nsignificantly, and may not be compatible with incorporating bacterial spores.\nIn addition, it's possible that some TPU uses would expose the plastic to\nenvironments that would activate the spores\u2014something like food handling or\nburied cabling. Still, it's possible this new breakdown process can provide a\nsolution in some cases, making it worth exploring further.\n\nNature Communications, 2024.
