Board sprint which is already\ndone, and a KDE Goals mega-sprint, which begins today! My \u201cAutomate and\nsystematize internal processes\u201d goal is represented there and I\u2019m hoping we\nhave a great time brainstorming and fixing stuff. And also that we eat lots of\nD\u00f6ner kebabs. So many D\u00f6ner kebabs. All the D\u00f6ner kebabs.\n\n## New Features\n\nSpectacle regains its \u201cblur factor\u201d feature, so now if you want your blurred\nareas to be even blurrier, you can do that without having to draw a blur over\nthe same area multiple times (Noah Davis, Spectacle 24.05. Link)\n\nYou can now copy the text of a column in System Monitor (Joshua Goins, Plasma\n6.1. Link)\n\n## UI Improvements\n\nThe Plasma Digital Clock\u2019s Islamic calendar feature now respects the locale-\nspecific numbering system, which means for example that people living in\nArabic-speaking countries that use western-style Arabic numerals will now see\nthose rather than eastern-style Arabic numerals (Fushan Wen, Plasma 6.0.5.\nLink)\n\nRemoved the \u201cClear all\u201d button on the fingerprint authorization enrollment UI,\nbecause it was a big obvious footgun you could use to destroy all your work to\nenroll fingerprints (Arthur Zamarin, Plasma 6.1. Link)\n\nNormally I don\u2019t mention changes to Welcome center, but this is a fairly large\none: the \u201cSimple by default\u201d page is no longer a big dumb picture of System\nSettings, but rather shows you a nice mock desktop where you can hover or\nclick on elements to learn what they are and what they do. System Settings is\nnow mentioned on the \u201cPowerful When Needed\u201d page (me: Nate Graham and Oliver\nBeard, Plasma 6.1. Link):\n\nOn System Settings\u2019 Night Light page, the time input fields for manual time\nmode are no longer a nightmare, because they\u2019ve been replaced with a set of\nspinboxes (Natalie Clarius, Plasma 6.1. Link):\n\nYes, ideally these would use a dedicated time picker UI component, but one\nthing at a time\n\nInformation about Night Light transition times is now shown in the tooltip for\nthe Brightness and Color widget (Natalie Clarius, Plasma 6.1. Link):\n\nSystem Settings\u2019 Screen Locking page has also now adopted the \u201cbuttons in the\nheader\u201d paradigm, this time for its \u201cConfigure Appearance\u201d button (Jakob\nPetsovits, Plasma 6.1. Link):\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\nFixed a number of issues in various pieces of KDE software caused by changes\nin Qt 6.7 (Felix Ernst, Noah Davis, and Fushan Wen, Dolphin & Spectacle 24.05\nand Plasma 6.0.4. Link 1, link 2, and link 3)\n\nSpectacle no longer badly misbehaves when asked to take a screenshot of a\nscreen with a scale factor of less than 100% (Noah Davis, Spectacle 24.05.\nLink)\n\nFixed an issue whereby Spectacle\u2019s feature to save screenshots with an\nincreasing number sequence would number the screenshots incorrectly in certain\ncircumstances (Noah Davis, Spectacle 24.05. Link)\n\nClosing your laptop\u2019s lid with the keyboard backlight illuminated now\ncorrectly restores its brightness level when you open the lid again (Anthony\nVital, Plasma 6.0.4. Link)\n\nFixed multiple issues whereby parts of Plasma would fail to save changed\nsettings if Plasma quickly crashed, exited unexpectedly, or was terminated in\nan unclean way (David Edmundson, Plasma 6.0.5. Link)\n\nPlasma no longer crashes when removing standalone launcher widgets for apps\nwith no \u201cOpen With\u201d context menu action (Fushan Wen, Plasma 6.0.5. Link)\n\nFixed multiple issues with keyboard focus and selection with search results in\nPlasma\u2019s Application Dashboard widget\u2014which you may notice is visibly on life\nsupport, but this constitutes some of that support (Marco Martin, Plasma\n6.0.5. Link)\n\nPlasma\u2019s screen chooser OSD once again works as expected on X11 (Fushan Wen\nand David Redondo, Plasma 6.0.5. Link 1 and link 2)\n\nThe Grid layout for System Monitor sensors once again looks good in\nconstrained spaces, such as a thick Plasma panel (Akseli Lahtinen, Plasma\n6.0.5. Link)\n\nFixed a major regression that prevented LUKS-encrypted disks from being\ndecrypted by KDE software using the Solid framework (Kai Uwe Broulik,\nFrameworks 6.2, but distros should be backporting it to their 6.1 packages\ntoo. Link)\n\nThose increasingly ubiquitous contextual help buttons that open explanatory\ntooltips when clicked no longer have a weird empty space on the right side of\ntheir tooltips (Shubham Arora, Frameworks 6.2. Link):\n\nFixed a Breeze icon that was not changing its color properly when using non-\ndefault color schemes (Evgeniy Harchenko, Frameworks 6.2. Link)\n\nOther bug information of note:\n\n  * 3 Very high priority Plasma bugs (same as last week). Current list of bugs\n  * 38 15-minute Plasma bugs (up from 36 last week). Current list of bugs\n  * 137 KDE bugs of all kinds fixed over the last week Full list of bugs\n\n## Performance & Technical\n\nKolourpaint has been ported to Qt6 (Carl Schwan, Kolourpaint 24.05. Link)\n\nOn Wayland, implemented support for the remote desktop portal\u2019s ConnectToEIS\nmethod. This enables applications like Synergy and Barrier that have Wayland\nsupport for sending emulated input events to do so in a more convenient way\nthan using the existing methods. Full support for input-leap is pending, but\nin progress (David Redondo, Plasma 6.1. Link)\n\nSystem Settings\u2019 Keyboard page has been ported to QML, retaining most of its\nprior styling but with a modern and extensible codebase (Evgeny Chesnokov,\nPlasma 6.1. Link)\n\n## ...And Everything Else\n\nThis blog only covers the tip of the iceberg! If you\u2019re hungry for more, check\nout https://planet.kde.org, where you can find more news from other KDE\ncontributors.\n\n## How You Can Help\n\nThe KDE organization has become important in the world, and your time and\nlabor have helped to bring it there! But as we grow, it\u2019s going to be equally\nimportant that this stream of labor be made sustainable, which primarily means\npaying for it. Right now the vast majority of KDE runs on labor not paid for\nby KDE e.V. (the nonprofit foundation behind KDE, of which I am a board\nmember), and that\u2019s a problem. We\u2019ve taken steps to change this with paid\ntechnical contractors\u2014but those steps are small due to growing but still\nlimited financial resources. If you\u2019d like to help change that, consider\ndonating today!\n\nOtherwise, visit https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved to discover other ways\nto be part of a project that really matters. Each contributor makes a huge\ndifference in KDE; you are not a number or a cog in a machine! You don\u2019t have\nto already be a programmer, either. I wasn\u2019t when I got started. Try it,\nyou\u2019ll like it! We don\u2019t bite!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nThis week in Usability & Productivity, part 4February 3, 2018In \"Usability &\nProductivity\"\n\nKDE Usability & Productivity: Week 78July 6, 2019In \"Usability & Productivity\"\n\nKDE Usability & Productivity: Week 79July 13, 2019In \"Usability &\nProductivity\"\n\n## Published by Nate\n\nView all posts by Nate\n\nPublished April 19, 2024\n\n## 3 thoughts on \u201cThis week in KDE: sprints, enhancements, and kebabs\u201d\n\n  1.

This feature made dealing with systemd convenient and easy in Plasma 5.\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nJoin 933 other subscribers\n\n# Follow via RSS\n\n  * RSS - Posts\n\n# Tip jar\n\nLiberaPay:\n\nPayPal:\n\n# Popular posts\n\n  * This week in KDE: Explicit Sync\n\n  * This week in KDE: sprints, enhancements, and kebabs\n\n  * So let's talk about this Wayland thing\n\n  * Does Wayland really break everything?\n\n  * Plasma 6: \"Better defaults\"\n\n# Categories\n\n  * Automation & Systematization\n  * Call to Action\n  * Discover\n  * FOSS culture\n  * Fundraising\n  * High DPI\n  * Inside KDE\n  * Linux Hardware\n  * New Contributor Friendliness\n  * Planning\n  * Plasma Mobile\n  * Presentations & Interviews\n  * The KDE Community\n  * This Week in KDE\n  * Tips & Tricks\n  * Uncategorized\n  * Usability & Productivity\n  * User Interface Design\n  * World Domination\n\n# Archives\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Adventures in Linux and KDE\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
