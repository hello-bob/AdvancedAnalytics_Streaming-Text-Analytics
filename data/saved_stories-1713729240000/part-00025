Two\nyears earlier, he had returned from his voyage aboard H.M.S. Beagle with the\nobservations that would eventually form the basis of \u201cOn the Origin of\nSpecies.\u201d In the meantime, he faced a more pressing analytical problem. Darwin\nwas considering proposing to his cousin Emma Wedgwood, but he worried that\nmarriage and children might impede his scientific career. To figure out what\nto do, he made two lists. \u201cLoss of time,\u201d he wrote on the first. \u201cPerhaps\nquarreling. . . . Cannot read in the evenings. . . . Anxiety and\nresponsibility. Perhaps my wife won\u2019t like London; then the sentence is\nbanishment and degradation into indolent, idle fool.\u201d On the second, he wrote,\n\u201cChildren (if it Please God). Constant companion (and friend in old age). . .\n. Home, & someone to take care of house.\u201d He noted that it was \u201cintolerable to\nthink of spending one\u2019s whole life, like a neuter bee, working, working. . . .\nOnly picture to yourself a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire and books\nand music perhaps.\u201d\n\nBeneath his lists, Darwin scrawled, \u201cMarry, Marry, Marry QED.\u201d And yet, Steven\nJohnson writes, in \u201cFarsighted: How We Make the Decisions That Matter the\nMost,\u201d \u201cwe have no evidence of how he actually weighed these competing\narguments against each other.\u201d Johnson, the author of \u201cHow We Got to Now\u201d and\nother popular works of intellectual history, can\u2019t help but notice the\nmediocrity of Darwin\u2019s decision-making process. He points out that Benjamin\nFranklin used a more advanced pro-and-con technique: in what Franklin called\n\u201cPrudential Algebra,\u201d a numerical weight is assigned to each listed item, and\ncounterbalancing items are then eliminated. (\u201cIf I find a Reason pro equal to\nsome two Reasons con, I strike out the three . . . and thus proceeding I find\nat length where the Ballance lies,\u201d Franklin explained to a friend.) Even this\napproach, Johnson writes, is slapdash and dependent upon intuition. \u201cThe craft\nof making farsighted choices\u2014decisions that require long periods of\ndeliberation, decisions whose consequences might last for years,\u201d he\nconcludes, \u201cis a strangely under-appreciated skill.\u201d\n\nWe say that we \u201cdecide\u201d to get married, to have children, to live in\nparticular cities or embark on particular careers, and in a sense this is\ntrue. But how do we actually make those choices? One of the paradoxes of life\nis that our big decisions are often less calculated than our small ones are.\nWe agonize over what to stream on Netflix, then let TV shows persuade us to\nmove to New York; buying a new laptop may involve weeks of Internet research,\nbut the deliberations behind a life-changing breakup could consist of a few\nbottles of wine. We\u2019re hardly more advanced than the ancient Persians, who,\nHerodotus says, made big decisions by discussing them twice: once while drunk,\nonce while sober.\n\nJohnson hopes to reform us. He examines a number of complex decisions with\nfar-reaching consequences\u2014such as the choice, made by President Barack Obama\nand his advisers, to green-light the raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s presumed\ncompound, in Abbottabad, Pakistan\u2014and then shows how the people in charge drew\nupon insights from \u201cdecision science,\u201d a research field at the intersection of\nbehavioral economics, psychology, and management. He thinks that we should\napply such techniques to our own lives.\n\nI\u2019ve never had to decide whether to launch a covert raid on a suspected\nterrorist compound, but I\u2019ve made my share of big decisions. This past summer,\nmy wife and I had a baby boy. His existence suggests that, at some point, I\ndecided to become a father. Did I, though? I never practiced any prudential\nalgebra; rather than drawing up lists of pros and cons and concluding, on\nbalance, that having kids was a good idea, I gradually and unintentionally\ntransitioned from not particularly wanting children to wanting them, and from\nwanting them to joining my wife in having them. If I made a decision, it\nwasn\u2019t a very decisive one. In \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d Tolstoy writes that, while an\narmchair general may imagine himself \u201canalyzing some campaign on a map\u201d and\nthen issuing orders, a real general never finds himself at \u201cthe beginning of\nsome event\u201d; instead, he is perpetually situated in the middle of a series of\nevents, each a link in an endless chain of causation. \u201cCan it be that I\nallowed Napoleon to get as far as Moscow?\u201d Tolstoy\u2019s General Kutuzov wonders.\n\u201cWhen was it decided? Was it yesterday, when I sent Platov the order to\nretreat, or was it the evening before, when I dozed off and told Bennigsen to\ngive the orders? Or still earlier?\u201d Unlike the capture of Moscow by Napoleon,\nthe birth of my son was a joyous occasion. Still, like Kutuzov, I\u2019m at a loss\nto explain it: it\u2019s a momentous choice, but I can\u2019t pinpoint the making of it\nin space or time.\n\nFor Tolstoy, the tendency of big decisions to make themselves was one of the\ngreat mysteries of existence. It suggested that the stories we tell about our\nlives are inadequate to their real complexity. Johnson means to offer a way\nout of the Tolstoyan conundrum. He wants to make us writers, rather than\nreaders, of our own stories. Doing so requires engaging with one of life\u2019s\nfundamental questions: Are we in charge of the ways we change?\n\nIdeally, we\u2019d be omniscient and clearheaded. In reality, we make decisions in\nimperfect conditions that prevent us from thinking things through. This,\nJohnson explains, is the problem of \u201cbounded rationality.\u201d Choices are\nconstrained by earlier choices; facts go undiscovered, ignored, or\nmisunderstood; decision-makers are compromised by groupthink and by their own\nfallible minds. The most complex decisions harbor \u201cconflicting objectives\u201d and\n\u201cundiscovered options,\u201d requiring us to predict future possibilities that can\nbe grasped, confusingly, only at \u201cvaried levels of uncertainty.\u201d (The\nlikelihood of marital quarrelling must somehow be compared with that of\nproducing a scientific masterwork.) And life\u2019s truly consequential choices,\nJohnson says, \u201ccan\u2019t be understood on a single scale.\u201d Suppose you\u2019re offered\ntwo jobs: one at Partners in Health, which brings medical care to the world\u2019s\nneediest people, and the other at Goldman Sachs. You must consider which\noption would be most appealing today, later this year, and decades from now;\nwhich would be preferable emotionally, financially, and morally; and which is\nbetter for you, your family, and society. From this multidimensional matrix, a\ndecision must emerge.\n\nProfessional deciders, Johnson reports, use decision processes to navigate\nthis complexity. Many of the best processes unfold in stages\u2014a divergence\nstage might precede a convergence stage\u2014and are undertaken by groups. (Darwin\nmight have divided his friends into two opposing teams, in the divergence\nstage, and then held a debate between them.) The decision might be turned into\nan iterative adventure. In a series of meetings known as a \u201cdesign\ncharrette\u201d\u2014the concept is borrowed from the field of product design\u2014a large\nproblem is divided into subproblems, each of which is assigned to a group; the\ngroups then present their work to the whole team, receive feedback, regroup,\nand revise, in a cycle that loops until a decision has been made. (For\narchitects in nineteenth-century Paris, working en charrette meant revising\nuntil the very last minute, even in the cart on the way to deliver a design to\na panel of judges.) Charrettes are useful not just because they break up the\nwork but because they force groups with different priorities and\nsensibilities\u2014coders and designers, architects and real-estate developers\u2014to\ninteract, broadening the range of available viewpoints.\n\nAt firms like Royal Dutch Shell, where growth requires investing in expensive\nventures, such as ports, wells, and pipelines, deciders use \u201cscenario\nplanning\u201d to imagine how such investments might play out. (A scenario-planning\nstarter kit, Johnson writes, contains three possible futures: \u201cYou build one\nmodel where things get better, one where they get worse, and one where they\nget weird.\u201d) Military planners use immersive war games, carried out in the\nfield or around a table, to bring more of the \u201cdecision map\u201d into view. In\nsuch games, our enemies discover possibilities that we can\u2019t foresee,\nameliorating the poverty of our individual imaginations. And since the games\ncan be played over and over, they allow decision-makers to \u201crewind the tape,\u201d\nexploring many branches of the \u201cdecision tree.\u201d\n\nIt would be strange to stage a war game about a prospective marriage. Still,\nJohnson writes, decision science has lessons for us as individuals. Late in\n\u201cFarsighted,\u201d he recounts his own use of decision-scientific strategies to\npersuade his wife to move, with their two children, from New York City to the\nBay Area. Johnson starts with intuitions\u2014redwoods are beautiful; the tech\nscene is cool\u2014but quickly moves beyond them. He conducts a \u201cfull-spectrum\nanalysis,\u201d arriving at various conclusions about what moving might mean\nfinancially, psychologically (will moving to a new city make him feel\nyounger?), and existentially (will he want to have been \u201cthe kind of person\nwho lived in one place for most of his adult life\u201d?). Johnson summarizes his\nfindings in a PowerPoint deck, then shows it to his wife, who raises\nobjections that he hasn\u2019t foreseen (all her friends live in Brooklyn).\nEventually, they make a contract. They\u2019ll move, but if after two years she\nwants to return to New York they\u2019ll do so, \u201cno questions asked\u201d\u2014a rewind.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nRoger J. Carter: Rebel Revolutionary\n\nSeven years later, they\u2019re happy with a bicoastal existence. Would Johnson\nhave benefitted from \u201cconducting a multidisciplinary charrette\u201d to explore his\nfamily\u2019s move? Probably not. Still, he writes, the principles of decision\nscience\u2014\u201cseeking out diverse perspectives on the choice, challenging your\nassumptions, making an explicit effort to map the variables\u201d\u2014constituted \u201ca\nstep up\u201d from the pro-and-con lists that Franklin and Darwin would have made.\nLooking back on his decision, Johnson can at least feel confident that he made\none.\n\nJohnson\u2019s book is part of a long tradition. For centuries, philosophers have\ntried to understand how we make decisions and, by extension, what makes any\ngiven decision sound or unsound, rational or irrational. \u201cDecision theory,\u201d\nthe destination on which they\u2019ve converged, has tended to hold that sound\ndecisions flow from values. Faced with a choice\u2014should we major in economics\nor in art history?\u2014we first ask ourselves what we value, then seek to maximize\nthat value.\n\nFrom this perspective, a decision is essentially a value-maximizing equation.\nIf you\u2019re going out and can\u2019t decide whether to take an umbrella, you could\ncome to a decision by following a formula that assigns weights to the\nprobability of rain, the pleasure you\u2019ll feel in strolling unencumbered, and\nthe displeasure you\u2019ll feel if you get wet. Most decisions are more complex\nthan this, but the promise of decision theory is that there\u2019s a formula for\neverything, from launching a raid in Abbottabad to digging an oil well in the\nNorth Sea. Plug in your values, and the right choice pops out.\n\nIn recent decades, some philosophers have grown dissatisfied with decision\ntheory. They point out that it becomes less useful when we\u2019re unsure what we\ncare about, or when we anticipate that what we care about might shift. In a\n2006 article called \u201cBig Decisions: Opting, Converting, Drifting,\u201d the late\nIsraeli philosopher Edna Ullmann-Margalit asked us to imagine being one of\n\u201cthe early socialist Zionist pioneers\u201d who, at the turn of the twentieth\ncentury, dreamed of moving from Europe to Palestine and becoming \u201cthe New Jews\nof their ideals.\u201d Such a change, she observed, \u201calters one\u2019s life project and\ninner core\u201d; one might speak of an \u201cOld Person\u201d who existed beforehand,\nbrowsing bookshops in Budapest, and a \u201cNew Person\u201d who exists afterward,\nworking a field in the desert. The point of such a move isn\u2019t to maximize\none\u2019s values. It\u2019s to reconfigure them, rewriting the equations by which one\nis currently living one\u2019s life.\n\nUllmann-Margalit doubted that such transformative choices could be evaluated\nas sound or unsound, rational or irrational. She tells the story of a man who\n\u201chesitated to have children because he did not want to become the \u2018boring\ntype\u2019 \u201d that parents tend to become. \u201cFinally, he did decide to have a child\nand, with time, he did adopt the boring characteristics of his parent\nfriends\u2014but he was happy!\u201d Whose values were maximized\u2014Old Person\u2019s or New\nPerson\u2019s? Because no value-maximizing formula could capture such a choice,\nUllmann-Margalit suggested that, rather than describing this man as having\n\u201cdecided\u201d to have children, we say that he \u201copted\u201d to have them\u2014\u201copting\u201d (in\nher usage) being what we do when we shift our values instead of maximizing\nthem.\n\nThe nature of \u201copting situations,\u201d she thought, explains why people \u201care in\nfact more casual and cavalier in the way they handle their big decisions than\nin the way they handle their ordinary decisions.\u201d Yet it\u2019s our unexplored\noptions that haunt us. A decision-maker who buys a Subaru doesn\u2019t dwell on the\nToyota that might have been: the Toyota doesn\u2019t represent a version of herself\nwith different values. An opter, however, broods over \u201cthe person one did not\nmarry, the country one did not emigrate to, the career one did not pursue,\u201d\nseeing, in the \u201cshadow presence\u201d implied by the rejected option, \u201ca yardstick\u201d\nby which she might evaluate \u201cthe worth, success or meaning\u201d of her actual\nlife.\n\nOne might hope that a little research could bridge the divide between Old\nPerson and New Person. In a 2013 paper titled \u201cWhat You Can\u2019t Expect When\nYou\u2019re Expecting,\u201d L. A. Paul, a philosopher at Yale, writes, \u201cPerhaps you\nthink that you can know what it\u2019s like to have a child, even though you\u2019ve\nnever had one, because you can read or listen to the testimony of what it was\nlike for others. You are wrong.\u201d Paul cites the philosopher David Lewis, who\nproposed what might be called the Vegemite Principle: if you\u2019ve never tasted\nVegemite, a mysterious and beloved Australian \u201cfood spread\u201d made from brewer\u2019s\nyeast, then neither a description of what it\u2019s like (black, gooey, vegetal)\nnor experience with other spreads (peanut butter, marmalade, Nutella) will\nsuffice to tell you whether you\u2019d like it. Similarly, Paul argues, \u201cbeing\naround other people\u2019s children isn\u2019t enough to learn about what it will be\nlike in your own case.\u201d She explains:\n\n> Babysitting for other children, having nieces and nephews or much younger\n> siblings\u2014all of these can be wonderful (or horrible) experiences, but they\n> are different in kind from having a child of your very own, perhaps roughly\n> analogous to the way an original artwork has aesthetic value partly because\n> of its origins. . . . Experience with other people\u2019s children might teach\n> you about what it is like to hold a baby, to change diapers or hold a\n> bottle, but not what it is like to create, carry, give birth to and raise a\n> child of your very own.\n\nBefore having children, you may enjoy clubbing, skydiving, and LSD; you might\nfind fulfillment in careerism, travel, cooking, or CrossFit; you may simply\nrelish your freedom to do what you want. Having children will deprive you of\nthese joys. And yet, as a parent, you may not miss them. You may actually\nprefer changing diapers, wrangling onesies, and watching \u201cFrozen.\u201d These\nactivities may sound like torture to the childless version of yourself, but\nthe parental version may find them illuminated by love, and so redeemed. You\nmay end up becoming a different person\u2014a parent. The problem is that you can\u2019t\nreally know, in advance, what \u201cbeing a parent\u201d is like. For Paul, there\u2019s\nsomething thrilling about this quandary. Why should today\u2019s values determine\ntomorrow\u2019s? In her 2014 book, \u201cTransformative Experience,\u201d she suggests that\nliving \u201cauthentically\u201d requires occasionally leaving your old self behind \u201cto\ncreate and discover a new self.\u201d Part of being alive is awaiting the\n\u201crevelation\u201d of \u201cwho you\u2019ll become.\u201d\n\nIn the months before our son was born, our sense of our ignorance mounted. \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t know what we\u2019re waiting for,\u201d my wife said. We knew in advance when he\nwould be born\u2014an ultrasound had revealed that he was unusually big, and a\nC-section had been scheduled\u2014but the morning of his arrival unfolded with a\nstrange familiarity. I had coffee, toasted an English muffin, and read the\nnews; I packed clothes for the hospital into the bag that I take to work every\nday. At eleven, my wife and I got into the car. Her mother and a family friend\ndrove us. At the front entrance, we hugged them goodbye.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet tonight.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\n\u201cGood luck!\u201d my mother-in-law said. \u201cYour lives are about to change forever!\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere are you guys going?\u201d\n\n\u201cCostco,\u201d she said.\n\nWe walked inside. Upstairs, in a curtained-off nook, my wife settled into a\nhospital bed. For about an hour, we made small talk with the nurses, who\nguessed at the baby\u2019s weight, and with the surgeon, who happened to be a\ncollege classmate of ours. (\u201cHeyyyyy! \u201d she said when she arrived.)\nOccasionally we were left to ourselves. We held hands and looked at each\nother.\n\nEventually, an aide helped my wife into a wheelchair. Flanked by two nurses\nand wearing oversized scrubs, I pushed her down a long hallway toward the\noperating room. Inside, the doctors were listening to \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d on\nthe radio. In the midst of it all, I admired Jimmy Page\u2019s guitar solo.\nAfterward, I sat in the same hallway holding our baby. I had wondered if,\nmeeting him for the first time, I would feel transformed. I felt like the same\nold me. And yet none of the words I knew matched the experience I was having.\nWith my hands, I felt him breathing. Quiet and still, warm and awake, he\nwatched me with dark-blue eyes\u2014an actual new person.\n\nAgnes Callard, a philosopher at the University of Chicago, is skeptical about\nthe idea of sudden transformation. She\u2019s also convinced that, no matter how it\nlooks or feels, we choose how we change. In her often moving, quietly profound\nbook \u201cAspiration: The Agency of Becoming,\u201d she writes that \u201cbecoming a parent\nis neither something that just happens to you nor something you decide to have\nhappen to you.\u201d Instead, Callard maintains, we \u201caspire\u201d to self-transformation\nby trying on the values that we hope one day to possess, just as we might\nstrike a pose in the mirror before heading out on a date. Of the man in\nUllmann-Margalit\u2019s article who feared becoming a boring dad, Callard writes,\n\u201cBy the time he says, \u2018Let\u2019s go for it,\u2019 he is actively trying to appreciate\nthe values distinctive of parenthood.\u201d In place of a moment of decision,\nCallard sees a more gradual process: \u201cOld Person aspires to become New\nPerson.\u201d\n\nSuppose that you sign up for a classical-music-appreciation class, in which\nyour first assignment is to listen to a symphony. You put on headphones, press\nPlay\u2014and fall asleep. The problem is that you don\u2019t actually want to listen to\nclassical music; you just want to want to. Aspiring, Callard thinks, is a\ncommon human activity: there are aspiring wine lovers, art appreciators,\nsports fans, fashionistas, d.j.s, executives, alpinists, do-gooders, parents,\nand religious believers, all hatching plans to value new things. Many ordinary\ndecisions, moreover\u2014such as choosing between Goldman Sachs and Partners in\nHealth\u2014also touch on the question of who we aspire to become.\n\nCallard distinguishes between aspiration and ambition. Some of the people\ntaking the music-appreciation class are ambitious; they enrolled not because\nthey aspire to love classical music but because the class is an easy A. From\nthe first day, they know what they value: their grades. (\u201cTurning ambition\ninto aspiration is one of the job descriptions of any teacher,\u201d Callard\nnotes.) The ambitious students find it easy to explain why they\u2019re taking the\nclass. But the aspirants must grow comfortable with a certain quantity of\nawkward pretense. If someone were to ask you why you enrolled, you would be\noverreaching if you said that you were moved by the profound beauty of\nclassical music. The truth, which is harder to communicate, is that you have\nsome vague sense of its value, which you hope that some future version of\nyourself might properly grasp.\n\nUntil aspirants can fully explain their motivations, they often understate\ntheir aims. An aspiring painter will say that she finds painting relaxing\nrather than try to explain what she hopes to express through her art. An\naspiration, Callard concludes, has two faces: a near face, which represents it\n\u201cas lesser than it is,\u201d and a distant one, which an aspirant is reluctant to\ndescribe, because it \u201cennobles her current activity beyond its rightful\nstatus.\u201d\n\nBeing a well-meaning phony is key to our self-transformations. \u201cConsider what\nkind of thinking motivates a good student to force herself to listen to a\nsymphony when she feels herself dozing off,\u201d Callard writes:\n\n> She reminds herself that her grade and the teacher\u2019s opinion of her depend\n> on the essay she will write about this piece; or she promises herself a\n> chocolate treat when she gets to the end; or she\u2019s in a glass-walled\n> listening room of the library, conscious of other students\u2019 eyes on her; or\n> perhaps she conjures up a romanticized image of her future, musical self,\n> such as that of entering the warm light of a concert hall on a snowy\n> evening.\n\nThese are \u201cbad\u201d reasons for listening to classical music, Callard says, but \u201c\n\u2018bad\u2019 reasons are how she moves herself forward, all the while seeing them as\nbad, which is to say, as placeholders for the \u2018real\u2019 reason.\u201d\n\nWhen we\u2019re aspiring, inarticulateness isn\u2019t a sign of unreasonableness or\nincapacity. In fact, the opposite may be true. \u201cEveryone goes to college \u2018to\nbecome educated,\u2019 \u201d Callard observes, \u201cbut until I am educated I do not really\nknow what an education is or why it is important.\u201d If we couldn\u2019t aspire to\nchanges that we struggle to describe, we\u2019d be trapped within the ideas that we\nalready have. Our inability to explain our reasons is a measure of how far we\nwish to travel. It\u2019s only after an aspirant has reached her destination,\nCallard writes, that \u201cshe will say, \u2018This was why.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBecause aspirations take a long time to come to fruition, they\u2019re always at\nrisk of interruption. Ullmann-Margalit\u2019s 2006 paper makes mention of someone\nwho opts \u201cto leave the corporate world in order to become an artist.\u201d Callard\nsees that sort of move as the result of an aspiration\u2014a process that starts\nsmall, perhaps with a random stroll through an art museum, and culminates,\nyears later, after one opens a pottery studio. The trouble is that some values\npreclude others. An aspiring artist must reject the corporate virtues to which\nhe once aspired and embrace creative ones in their place. If a family illness\nforces him to abandon his artistic plans, he may end up adrift\u2014disenchanted\nwith corporate life, but unable to grasp the real satisfactions of an artistic\nexistence. To aspire, Callard writes, is to judge one\u2019s present-day self by\nthe standards of a future self who doesn\u2019t yet exist. But that can leave us\nlike a spider plant putting down roots in the air, hoping for soil that may\nnever arrive.\n\nCallard revisits Paul\u2019s \u201cWhat You Can\u2019t Expect When You\u2019re Expecting.\u201d In that\npaper, Paul explored a strange consequence of the Vegemite Principle: if\nthere\u2019s no rational way to decide to have a child\u2014because you can\u2019t know what\nyou\u2019ve never experienced\u2014then there\u2019s also no rational reason for being\ndisappointed about not having one. (Such disappointment isn\u2019t \u201cwrong, or\nblameworthy, or subjectively unreasonable,\u201d Paul notes\u2014just nonrational.)\nCallard disagrees. She sees infertility as a form of interrupted aspiration.\nAn aspiring mother who can\u2019t have children is rational in feeling sad, she\nwrites, and \u201cthis is so even if\u2014indeed, it is true in part because\u2014she cannot\nquite see what she would be missing.\u201d\n\nBefore we had our son, I began exploring the \u201cnear face\u201d of being a parent. I\nnoticed how cute babies and children could be and pictured our spare room as a\nnursery; I envisaged my wife and I taking our child to the beach near our\nhouse (my version of \u201centering the warm light of a concert hall on a snowy\nevening\u201d). I knew that these imaginings weren\u2019t the real facts about having\nchildren\u2014clearly, there was more to having kids than cuteness. All the same, I\nhad no way of grasping the \u201cdistant face\u201d of fatherhood. It was something I\naspired to know.\n\nAs it turned out, my wife and I had trouble having children. It took us five\nyears to navigate the infertility maze. For much of that time, we lived with\nwhat Callard describes as the \u201cdistinctive kind of sadness appropriate to\nlosing something you were only starting to try to get to know.\u201d This sadness,\nCallard points out, has a complement in the disappointment one might feel\nafter \u201chaving to abandon one\u2019s educational aspirations for motherhood\u201d: \u201cThe\naspiring college student who must give up those dreams to raise a child is\nliable to feel that she was counting on the college experience to make her\nlife meaningful.\u201d Callard quotes from \u201cBarren in the Promised Land,\u201d a book\nabout infertility by the historian Elaine Tyler May. \u201cThe grief\u2014the loss,\u201d a\nwoman tells May. \u201cI spent six years of my life trying to be a mom, and it was\nbeyond my control. For a while I couldn\u2019t look ahead. I thought, how do I\ndefine myself if I don\u2019t do this? What am I if not a parent?\u201d It might be\neasier if our biggest transformations were instantaneous, because then we\nwouldn\u2019t need to live in states of aspiration. Certain of who we were, we\u2019d\nnever get stuck between selves.\n\nI read \u201cAspiration\u201d last spring, before my son was born, and I talked about it\noften with my wife. We were especially struck by Callard\u2019s argument that\nparenthood is intrinsically aspirational. Parents look forward to a loving\nrelationship with a specific person. And yet that person doesn\u2019t pop into\nexistence fully formed; he emerges, in all his specificity, over many years.\nFor this reason, it makes little sense to be an \u201cambitious parent\u201d\u2014someone who\nplans, in advance, what he will love about his child. It\u2019s better to \u201center\nparenthood for the most inchoate of reasons,\u201d Callard concludes, since that\n\u201cputs our children in a position to fill out what parenthood means for us\u201d; in\nturn, parental love must \u201cbe capable of molding itself to the personality that\nis, itself, coming to take a determinate shape.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, Callard\u2019s book is a systematic overview, situated outside\nthe moment. Still, she writes, for aspirants \u201cwhat happens in the meanwhile is\nalso life.\u201d Now that our son is here, we live entirely in the meanwhile. We\ndon\u2019t want the present, or its mystery, to end. Each day is absorbing and\nendlessly significant. Recently, I watched my father\u2019s face as he watched my\nson\u2019s. Later, we listened as my son learned a new kind of laugh. Each time he\nlooks at us, he sees us more in his own way. Like pages that turn themselves,\nthe meaningful instants follow one another too soon. It\u2019s hard to think of\nthem as stepping stones on the way to anywhere else. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the January 21, 2019, issue, with the\nheadline \u201cChoose Wisely.\u201d\n\nJoshua Rothman, the ideas editor of newyorker.com, has been at The New Yorker\nsince 2012.\n\nMore:Steven JohnsonDecisionsFatherhoodFathersBooks\n\n### Weekly\n\nEnjoy our flagship newsletter as a digest delivered once a week.\n\nRead More\n\nBooks\n\nBaby Talk\n\nBy Jill Lepore\n\nA Critic at Large\n\nShut Up and Sit Down\n\nBy Joshua Rothman\n\nVideo\n\nWhat the Government Shutdown Means for Americans\n\nPresident Trump has threatened to keep the government shut down for days,\nweeks, months, or even years, urging Congress to give him $5.7 billion to\nbuild an extension of the wall along the southern border.\n\nAnnals of Psychology\n\nSo You Think You\u2019ve Been Gaslit\n\nWhat happens when a niche clinical concept becomes a ubiquitous cultural\ndiagnosis.\n\nBy Leslie Jamison\n\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
