(AP) \u2014 Three women who were diagnosed with HIV after getting\n\u201cvampire facial\u201d procedures at an unlicensed New Mexico medical spa are\nbelieved to be the first documented cases of people contracting the virus\nthrough a cosmetic procedure using needles, federal health officials said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its Morbidity and\nMortality Report last week that an investigation into the clinic from 2018\nthrough 2023 showed it apparently reused disposable equipment intended for\none-time use.\n\nAlthough HIV transmission from contaminated blood through unsterile injection\nis a well-known risk, the report said this is the first documentation of\nprobable infections involving cosmetic services.\n\nMany popular cosmetic treatments are delivered with needles, such as Botox to\niron out wrinkles and fillers to plump lips. A \u201cvampire facial,\u201d or platelet-\nrich plasma microneedling procedure, involves drawing a client\u2019s own blood,\nseparating its components, then using tiny needles to inject plasma into the\nface to rejuvenate the skin. Tattoos also require needles.\n\nMORE U.S. NEWS\n\nIsrael-Hamas war protesters and police clash on Texas campus, Columbia\nUniversity begins suspensions\n\nOklahoma towns hard hit by tornadoes begin long cleanup after 4 killed in\nweekend storms\n\nSuspect killed after 3 police officers wounded by gunfire in standoff near New\nOrleans\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Health began investigating the spa in the summer\nof 2018 after it was notified that a woman in her 40s had tested positive for\nHIV even though she had no known risk factors. The woman reported exposure to\nneedles through the procedure at the clinic that spring.\n\nThe spa closed in fall 2018 after the investigation was launched, and its\nowner was prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license.\n\n0:00 / 47\n\n# AP AUDIO: CDC says it\u2019s identified 1st documented cases of HIV transmitted\nthrough cosmetic needles.\n\nAP correspondent Jennifer King reports on a case of HIV transmission at a\nsouthwestern medical spa.\n\nThe report said the investigation showed how important it is to require\ninfection control practices at businesses that offer cosmetic procedures\ninvolving needles.\n\nIt also noted that the investigation was slowed by poor record keeping and\nsaid businesses providing such services should keep better records in case\nclients need to be contacted later.\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nDead infant found at Florida university campus; police investigating\n\nUndo\n\nTreppenlift-VergleichAd Content\n\nAdvertisement Kein Scherz: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-\nVergleich:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUndo\n\nFocus turns to demeanor of girlfriend charged in Boston officer's death on\nsecond day of trial\n\nUndo\n\nJudge upholds disqualification of challenger to judge in Trump\u2019s Georgia\nelection interference case\n\nUndo\n\nA Colorado woman was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020.
