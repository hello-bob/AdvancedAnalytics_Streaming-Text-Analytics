The fundamental phase shifting\nunit of the transmitarray unit cell consists of a resonant cavity composed of\na pair of orthogonal metal gates and dielectric layers, with a cross-sectional\nheight of 0.17 \u03bb. The middle layer of the phase-shifting unit is composed of\ncircular gaps and C-shaped patches, and two diodes with opposite directions\nare loaded. By turning the diodes ON and OFF, current reversal is\naccomplished, allowing the unit to transition between its 0 and 1 states and\nachieve transmission-phase quantization. The unit\u2019s minimal insertion loss is\n0.37 dB in state 0 and 0.35 dB in state 1, respectively. In order to verify\nour design, we designed and processed a 16 \u00d7 16 transmitarray in the C-band.\nThe simulated results are consistent with the experimental results. The\nexperimental results show that the transmitarray can achieve \u00b1 45\u00b0 beam\nscanning on both the E-plane and H-plane, and the maximum gain is 20.59 dBi at\n5 GHz, with an aperture efficiency of 20.5%.\n\nKeywords:\n\ntransmitarray; reconfigurable; beam scanning\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nBeam-scanning technology plays a pivotal role in enhancing the target tracking\ncapabilities of radar, communication, and navigation systems. Traditionally,\nthis functionality has been achieved through phased array antennas, which\nmanipulate the beam direction by adjusting the phase difference between\nindividual antenna units. However, the design of transmit/receive (T/R)\nmodules for phased array antennas is complex, expensive, and requires the\ndesign of complex phase-shifting network [1,2]. Recent advancements in antenna\ntechnology have seen the emergence of reconfigurable metasurfaces as a\npromising alternative. Distinguished by their ability to dynamically alter\noperating modes and achieve multiple radiation patterns on the same platform,\nreconfigurable metasurfaces offer several advantages over traditional\napproaches. These include reduced antenna sizes, lower costs, and enhanced\nsystem integration capabilities [3]. Therefore, reconfigurable metasurfaces\nwhich include reflectarrays and transmitarrays have become a research hotspot\nin the field of antenna theory and technology. The pursuit of\nreconfigurability has led to innovations in mechanical structures as well as\nthe adoption of tunable devices such as MEMS switches [4], varactor diodes\n[5], and particularly PIN diodes, due to their low cost, mature technology,\nand straightforward design [6,7]. PIN diodes have been extensively utilized to\nenhance the reconfigurability of antennas, contributing to advancements in\nbeam-switching and scanning capabilities, and the development of dual-\npolarization [8] and 2 bit circularly polarized [9] beams. Despite these\ninnovations, the reflectarray approach has been limited by its narrow\nbandwidth [10,11] and feed shielding issues, which compromise performance. The\ntransmitarray, devoid of feed shielding problems, represents a significant\nstep forward.\n\nThere are some reconfigurable transmitarray (RTA) designs that have shown good\nperformances such as linear polarization, dual-linear polarization, and wide-\nangle beam scanning. A linear polarization RTA has been proposed by Antonio\nClemente et al. They utilized the structure of U-shaped and O-shaped grooves,\nconnected with metal via holes, and achieved 1 bit phase control by loading a\nPIN diode [12]. Nguyen\u2019s team proposed a C-shaped patch and a C-shaped\ncoupling groove [3,13], and loaded PIN diodes into the gap to achieve a 1 bit\nlinear polarization transmission metasurface design in the X-band. In 2021,\nthey accomplished 1 bit transmission in the Ka-band by putting metal through\nholes [14]. Min Wang et al. proposed integrating PIN diodes in the C-shaped\nmicrostrip feed layer, thereby achieving a good radiation performance [15]. In\norder to achieve a stable wide-angle beam scanning performance, reference [16]\nproposed an equivalent magnetic dipole unit structure, with a gain loss of\nonly 3.6 dB for the 60\u00b0 scanned beam in the E-plane. In order to achieve dual-\nlinear polarization, Ref. [17] proposes a receiver\u2013transmitter structure with\nan active receiving dipole and a passive asymmetric transmitting dipole. Ref.\n[18] uses space wave coupled to the feeder through gaps, and then achieves a\n180\u00b0 phase shift by selecting different paths. Finally, a linearly polarized\nwave is emitted through the gap, which is orthogonal to the direction of the\nincoming polarization wave. In reference [19], the author uses slot waveguide\nfeeding instead of air feeding to achieve a reduction in the overall height\nprofile. In these cases, active devices are typically used to reverse the\ncurrent in order to produce the unit\u2019s phase difference. However, there is a\nproblem with the above design structure. The receiving layer receives\nelectromagnetic energy and transforms it into guided waves. These waves are\nthen phase-shifted via tunable devices and radiated out through the radiating\nlayer. As a result, tunable devices will receive practically all of the\nelectromagnetic power, leading to large Ohmic losses. Research on how to\nrealize low Ohmic loss structures to raise the array\u2019s aperture efficiency has\nlong been a challenge for transmitarrays.\n\nPolarization conversion has also been studied and applied in some research.\nNathaniel\u2019s team proposed a polarization conversion reflective and\ntransmissive metasurface in the terahertz band, which utilizes an oblique\nmetal cut wire array to achieve a reflective polarization converter. It can\nconvert linearly polarized electromagnetic waves into orthogonal linearly\npolarized electromagnetic waves, and has the characteristics of a wide\nfrequency band and a high polarization conversion rate [20]. Ref. [21]\nintroduces a polarization conversion with excellent roll-off features, an\nultra-thin thickness, low insertion losses, and wide rejection bands. By\ndesigning a transmission structure based on polarization conversion and\namplitude, a phase-independent adjustable transmitarray is realized [22],\nwhich has the characteristics of a low profile and low cost. A novel\ntransmitarray structure is proposed in [23] that achieves line polarization to\ncross polarization through orthogonal polarization gates and a middle\nrectangular gap, and can achieve 2D beam scanning. In the above structural\ndesigns, the flat-phase shift characteristic required is achieved using\npolarization conversion.\n\nThis article introduces a 1 bit electronically reconfigurable transmitarray\ndesigned for 2D beam scanning in the C-band with a high efficiency and low\nloss. Through the use of a polarization conversion made up of dielectric\nlayers and orthogonal metal gates, along with two reverse PIN diodes inserted\nin the middle, our design is able to produce a 180\u00b0 phase difference. The\n\u201cUnit Cell\u201d section has a thorough structural description. A 16 \u00d7 16\ntransmitarray prototype validates the concept, demonstrating the ability to\nperform \u00b145\u00b0 two-dimensional beam scanning on both the E-plane and H-plane\nwith a maximum gain of 20.59 dBi. This research contributes to the field by\naddressing the limitations of previous designs and offering a streamlined,\ncost-effective solution for dynamic beam scanning.\n\n## 2\\. Design and Optimization of Proposed Unit Cell\n\nFor reconfigurable transmitarrays, phase control must be achieved while\nmaintaining a high level of transmittance. Therefore, in transmission design,\nnot only should phase characteristics be considered, but transmission\namplitude should also be taken into account. The foundational aspect of\ndeveloping a 1 bit electronically reconfigurable transmitarray is the creation\nof a unit cell that is capable of incorporating active devices to facilitate a\n180-degree phase shift. Our approach employs PIN diodes for dynamic phase\nshift control within the transmitarray unit, capitalizing on their cost-\neffectiveness and simplistic design. Typically, transmitarray elements are\nconstructed from multi-layer frequency selective surfaces (FSS) or\nreceive\u2013transmit (Rx-Tx) structures. Achieving a comprehensive 360\u00b0 phase\nshift with FSS demands multiple layers [24], complicating integration and\nenlarging the transmitarray\u2019s overall volume. The receive\u2013reradiate (Rx-Tx)\nstructure is the most commonly used structure in the design of reconfigurable\ntransmitarray. Its unit structure usually includes a receiving layer and a\nradiating layer, which are then connected through metals via holes or coupling\ngaps. However, traditional Rx-Tx architectures suffer from a limited bandwidth\nand notable losses. The structure proposed in this article circumvents these\nlimitations.\n\n#### 2.1. Unit Cell\n\nAs shown in Figure 1a, the side length P of the unit-cell is 25 mm, slightly\nless than 0.5 at 5 GHz, where is the free space wavelength. The unit cell\nconsists of two layers of F4B () substrate composition. The height of the top\nlayer substrate is h_1 = 1.5 mm, and the height of the bottom layer substrate\nis h_2 = 3 mm. The interval between the top and bottom substrates is air with\na height of h_air = 5 mm. There is an orthogonal metal polarization grating on\nthe top and bottom layers of the medium, with a width of W_2 = 3.6 mm and a\ngap of g = 1.6 mm. In order to achieve the phase shift, a C-shaped structure\nis designed to be in the middle layer as shown in Figure 1b. As shown, in\norder to achieve the phase shift, a circular gap has been designed and two\nrectangular gaps are designed to be on the circular patch. The angles between\nthese two rectangular gaps and the y-axis are \u00b145\u00b0. Two diodes with opposite\ndirections are installed on the gap, and their model is SMP1340-040LF of\nSkyworks Solutions Inc. When setting the feeding voltage, there is always only\none diode in the ON state. When the diode is connected, the equivalent circuit\nis a series resistor and inductor, with R = 1 \u03a9 and L = 0.45 nH; when the\ndiode is OFF in reverse, the equivalent circuit is a series of a resistor,\ninductor, and capacitor, with R = 10 \u03a9, L = 0.45 nH, and C = 126 fF.\n\nFigure 1. The structure of unit cell: (a) overall structure of the unit. (b)\ntop view of the middle layer of the unit-cell.\n\nThe results obtained using the HFSS master\u2013slave boundary condition and\nFloquet ports to simulate the unit cell are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen\nthat, in the range of 4.7\u20135.3 GHz, the transmission loss is low (S_21 > \u22123\ndB). We refer to the situation where Diode 1 is OFF and Diode 2 is On as State\n0, and the situation where Diode 1 is On and Diode 2 is OFF as State 1. From\nthe simulation results, it can be seen that there is almost no difference in\nthe S_21 amplitudes between state 0 and state 1, with only a phase difference\nof 180\u00b0. Moreover, the phase response curve has a good linearity, and the\nphase difference remains constant within the operating frequency band. An air\nlayer is positioned between the top and bottom layers in order to position the\ndiodes. To achieve an optimal transmission performance, the air layer\u2019s height\nh_air is swept. As shown in Figure 3, it can be seen that, with the increase\nin h_air, the transmission loss of the unit cell gradually decreases. In the\nend, we settled on h_air = 5 mm since it has a decent transmission coefficient\nwithin the useful frequency range.\n\nFigure 2. The transmission amplitude and phase of the unit cell: (a)\ntransmission coefficient (S_21) and reflection coefficient (S_11). (b) Phase\nshift.\n\nFigure 3. The transmission coefficient of the unit cell corresponding to\ndifferent h_air.\n\nA Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavity is an optical resonant cavity composed of two parallel\nhighly reflective mirrors (or reflective surfaces), through which\nelectromagnetic waves bounce back and forth, generating interference. The unit\ncell designed in this article consists of two orthogonal layers of metal\ngratings and a metal layer with a diagonal symmetric structure in the middle.\nThe orthogonal layers of metal gratings form a Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot-like cavity. When\nthe polarization direction of the incident wave is perpendicular to the metal\ngrating (x-polarized), the electromagnetic wave can be fully transmitted. When\nthe polarization direction is parallel to the metal grating (y-polarized), the\nelectromagnetic wave can be fully reflected. As the x-polarized wave is\nincident, the electromagnetic wave propagates along the oblique rectangular\ngap in the middle metal layer, generating polarization decomposition in the x\nand y directions. After the electromagnetic wave propagates to the bottom\nmetal grating, the y-polarized wave perpendicular to the bottom metal grating\nwill be transmitted, and the x-polarized wave will be reflected. After\nmultiple reflections by the top and bottom metal gates, the electromagnetic\nwave in the F-P resonant cavity will form interference, and the beam will\nproduce a phase effect, while the inverted beam will be cancelled. By\nadjusting parameters such as medium thickness, the cross polarized waves are\nsuperimposed and enhanced, while the co-polarized waves are eliminated,\nthereby achieving high polarization conversion rates and controlling the\ntransmission rate of the electromagnetic waves. Compared to FSS, which\nrequires four or even more layers to achieve a 360\u00b0 phase shift range, this\nstructure has a low profile height, which reduces the volume of the\ntransmitarray significantly and makes it easy to integrate active devices. The\ntraditional Tx-Rx structure is connected to the Tx-Rx part by metal fed\nthrough holes or gaps, using the principle of guided waves. The incident\nspatial wave is first coupled to the guided wave by the antenna. Then, the\nguided wave is phase shifted and finally it is reradiated, resulting in an\nantenna-phase shifter-antenna topology. Compared to the Tx-Rx structure, the\ntransmission efficiency of the F-P resonant cavity is higher, and the phase\nresponse has a good linearity with frequency variation.\n\nThe current distribution, J_surf, when Diode 1 is turned on and Diode 2 is\nturned off is shown in Figure 4a. The current distribution when Diode 1 is\nturned off and Diode 2 is turned on is shown in Figure 4b. It can be seen that\nthe current distribution in State 0 and State 1 is oblique symmetric at the\ncenter frequency of 5 GHz, and the current is mainly concentrated at the diode\nin the off state. In addition, the top and bottom metal gratings are\northogonal, and the current distribution of the entire structure is mirrored\nand symmetrical for State 0 and 1. The transmission amplitude responses of the\ntwo states are almost the same, and the transmission phase difference is 180\u00b0.\n\nFigure 4. Unit Cell current diagram: (a) surface current distribution in State\n0. (b) Surface current distribution in State 1.\n\n#### 2.2. Bias Line\n\nDiodes are active devices, and their DC feeding method is generally achieved\nby designing additional feeding lines in the array. However, the introduction\nof feeding lines can affect the transmission of a unit structure, reducing\ntransmission efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the feeding\nline design. According to the equivalent circuit model, the unit needs to have\ntwo set feeding points, and the voltage difference between these two points\nshould be \u00b10.85 V, which is the working voltage of the Skyworks Solutions\nInc\u2019s SMP1340-040LF diode. In order to achieve this function, this article\nadds a dielectric layer under the bottom metal gratings and designs the feeder\nbelow the dielectric layer as shown in Figure 5. In order to minimize the\ninfluence of the feeder, the direction of the feeder is designed along the\nx-axis, parallel to the bottom metal grating, and the feeder is extremely\nnarrow, which gives it strong characteristics to impede microwave current. The\nadhesive layer is marked and highlighted with brown in Figure 5a and is\nbetween the bottom metal gratings and the feeding layer. The material used is\nRogers RO4450F, exhibiting an epsilon value of 3.52. Other parameters of the\nunit cell include: the thickness of the feeding layer medium h_3 = 1 mm, the\nadhesive layer thickness h = 0.1 mm, and the total cross-sectional height of\nthe structure is 10.6 mm, equal to 0.17 \u03bb at the central frequency. The\nposition of the metal through-hole is d = 5 mm, and the inner radius of the\nthrough-hole is 0.35 mm. The structure of the bottom metal grating has been\nimproved. In order to prevent microwave surface current from flowing to the\nground through the feeder, a 10 nH inductor is installed between the circular\npatch in the middle layer and the outer metal ground. In theory, inductors\nhave the highest impedance at their self-resonant frequency. When an inductor\nis installed on a circular groove, the circular groove will generate a higher\nparasitic capacitance, resulting in the total parasitic capacitance of the\ninductor being higher than its original parasitic capacitance. So, the self-\nresonant frequency of the inductor is chosen as 5.1 GHz, which is slightly\nhigher than the center frequency. The bias circuit of the PIN diode on the\nsubstrate is shown in Figure 5. The influence of the bias circuit on S_21 is\nstudied through simulation, and it can be seen that the introduction of the\nbias circuit has a relatively small impact on the unit in the working\nfrequency band after optimization.\n\nFigure 5.

(b) Comparison of\namplitude response of transmitarray with and without feeding layer. (c) Top\nview of bottom metal grating. (d) Bottom view of feeding layer.\n\n## 3\\. Transmitarray Design and Measurement\n\n#### 3.1. Transmitarray Beam Scanning Theory\n\nIn order to achieve two-dimensional beam scanning of the transmitarray, phase\ncompensation needs to be applied to each unit of the transmitarray, as shown\nin Figure 6. The phase distribution can be calculated using the following\nformula [25]:\n\nwhere is phase distribution, , is the free space wavelength, is the position\nvector from the phase center of the feed source to the unit, is the position\nvector from the center of the transmitarray to the (m, n) unit, is the\ndirection of the transmission beam of the transmitarray, and is a constant,\nrepresenting the relative transmission phase. Here, we set = 0 for simplicity.\n\nFigure 6. Schematic diagram of transmitarray antenna: (a) side view of\ntransmitarray antenna. (b) Three-dimensional diagram of transmitarray antenna.\n\nAfter calculating , the 1 bit transmitarray needs to quantify to the . The\nspecific quantization method is as follows:\n\nAccording to Formula (2), 0\u00b0 corresponds to State 0, and 180\u00b0 corresponds to\nState 1 in the unit design section. The maximum quantization error caused by\nthis method is 90\u00b0, and the average quantization error is 45\u00b0. When a two-\ndimensional beam scanning needs to be achieved, the compensating phase of the\nunit can be changed by changing the diode state, thereby achieving real-time\ndynamic beam scanning.\n\n#### 3.2. Transmitarray Design\n\nTo verify the beam scanning function of the transmitarray, the above units are\nused to form a 16 \u00d7 16 array using a horn antenna with a gain of 10 dBi as the\nfeed source. The focal diameter ratio (F/D) is an important optimization\nparameter of a transmitarray. F is the distance between the phase center of\nthe antenna feed and the center of the aperture surface of the array. D is the\nsize of the aperture surface. Too large or too small an F/D will affect the\nperformance of the transmitarray. When the feed antenna\u2019s electromagnetic\nwaves reach the aperture surface\u2019s edge, they should be at a level of around\n\u221210 dB relative to the surface\u2019s center to design F/D. The designed focal\nlength F is 268 mm and the focal to diameter ratio F/D is 0.67. Each row of 16\nunits is divided into two groups, and sockets are designed on both sides of\nthe antenna to connect control circuit modules. One feeding end is provided by\nthe through-hole linked feeder, while the other feeding end is provided by the\nphase control layer\u2019s cut ring patch located in the center of the unit. By\ndesigning a bias circuit, each unit can operate at \u00b10.85 V and 0 V, allowing\nthe diode to operate in two states. The operating current of each control\ncircuit is 10 mA. The radiation pattern in both principal planes at 5 GHz can\nbe obtained through the simulation shown in Figure 7. It can be seen that the\n3 dB beam width on the E-plane is 9.7\u00b0, the sidelobe level (SLL) is \u221211.8 dB,\nand the cross-polarization level within the main lobe is below \u221224 dB. The 3\ndB beam width on the H-plane is 9.7\u00b0, the SLL of \u221212.3 dB and cross-\npolarization level within the main lobe is below \u221220.7 dB.\n\nFigure 7. The radiation pattern of reconfigurable transmitarray antenna at 5\nGHz. (a) E-plane simulated radiation pattern. (b) H-plane simulated radiation\npattern.\n\n#### 3.3. Measurement Results\n\nIn order to verify the reconfigurable function of the proposed unit structure\nin this article, a 16 \u00d7 16 transmitarray, as shown in Figure 8, was\nmanufactured and tested on the anechoic chamber. Next, the discrete phase\ndistribution could be calculated using Formulas (1) and (2) and used to adjust\nthe state of the diodes for beam scanning. The representative phase\ndistribution of beam scanning angles is shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure\n10, the E-plane and H-plane\u2019s antenna patterns of beam scanning were simulated\nand tested.\n\nFigure 8. Fabricated prototype of transmitarray and experimental setup in the\nanechoic chamber. (a) Top layer. (b) Middle layer. (c) Experimental scene.\n\nFigure 9. Phase distribution of measurement/simulated pattern for different\nscanning angles. (a) . (b) . (c) .\n\nFigure 10. Reconfigurable transmitarray antenna beam scanning pattern obtained\nthrough simulation and testing at 5 GHz: (a) E-plane. (b) H-plane.\n\nIn Figure 10, it can be observed that the test results and simulation results\nare in good agreement. The maximum beam pointing error is within 2\u00b0 due to the\n1 bit quantization. When the scanning angle is large, there is a slight\ndeviation in the beam direction. The main reason for this is that the 1 bit\nphase resolution accuracy is relatively lower compared to the continuous phase\ndistribution, and there is an approximate error. The measured beam scanning\nangle can accurately meet the designed scanning angle. The measured beam gain\ngradually decreases as the scanning angle increases. In the design of\ntransmission array, the gain and aperture efficiency are reduced due to\nvarious losses, including spillover loss, taper loss, phase quantization loss,\nand unit insertion loss. In addition, there are losses from fabrication and\nmeasurement errors. The measured maximum gain at 5.0 GHz is 20.59 dBi with an\naperture efficiency of 20.5%, and the gain error between simulation and\nmeasurement is 0.5 dB.\n\nThe maximum losses the gain in the E-plane and H-plane are 2.96 dB and 2.11 dB\nat scanning angle, respectively. This is acceptable in practical applications\nand does not affect the overall performance of the RTA beam scanning. The\nabove test results have verified the good beam-scanning performance of the\ndesigned reconfigurable transmitarray. A comparison of measured performance of\n1 bit RTAs is given in Table 1. It can clearly be seen, that compared with the\nother studies from the literature shown in Table 1, the work proposed by us\nhas a relatively high gain and aperture efficiency, and a relatively low loss\nwhen the beam scanning angle reaches 45\u00b0.\n\nTable 1. Comparison between this work and previous research.\n\n## 4\\. Conclusions\n\nThis article introduces an innovative 1 bit electronically reconfigurable\ntransmitarray featuring a high polarization conversion rate. The core of this\ndesign lies in the strategic use of orthogonal metal gratings to construct an\nF-P resonant cavity, which significantly enhances the linear polarization\nconversion efficiency. Central to the unit\u2019s functionality are circular gaps\nand patches within the middle layer, with a unit footprint of 25 \u00d7 25 mm (0.42\n\u03bb \u00d7 0.42 \u03bb) and a slim profile of 0.17 \u03bb. The incorporation of PIN diodes,\noriented in opposite directions across the patch gaps, facilitates a 180\u00b0\nphase shift, ensuring that the unit exhibits a robust linear phase response\nacross the operational bandwidth.\n\nThe practical application of this unit cell design is demonstrated through a\n16 \u00d7 16 reconfigurable transmitarray, which successfully achieves two-\ndimensional beam scanning capabilities. This system is capable of adjusting\nthe beam direction up to \u00b145\u00b0 in both the E-plane and H-plane, with gain\nlosses of 2.96 dB and 2.11 dB, respectively. Such performance underscores the\ntransmitarray\u2019s exceptional gain and polarization conversion efficiency,\nmaking it an ideal candidate for advanced applications in radar and satellite\ncommunication.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, Z.Z.; Methodology, Z.Z.; Formal analysis, Z.Z.;\nInvestigation, W.R.; Writing\u2014original draft, Z.Z.; Writing \u2013 review & editing,\nZ.Z.; Project administration, W.L.; Funding acquisition, W.R. and Z.X.
