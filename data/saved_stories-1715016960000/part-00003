Foucault argues that prison did not become\nthe principal form of punishment just because of the humanitarian concerns of\nreformists. He traces the cultural shifts that led to the predominance of\nprison via the body and power. Prison is used by the \"disciplines\" \u2013 new\ntechnological powers that can also be found, according to Foucault, in places\nsuch as schools, hospitals, and military barracks.^[1]\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\nThe main ideas of Discipline and Punish can be grouped according to its four\nparts: torture, punishment, discipline, and prison.^[1]\n\n### Torture[edit]\n\nFoucault begins by contrasting two forms of penalty: the violent and chaotic\npublic torture of Robert-Fran\u00e7ois Damiens, who was convicted of attempted\nregicide in the mid-18th century, and the highly regimented daily schedule for\ninmates from an early-19th-century prison (Mettray). These examples provide a\npicture of just how profound the changes in Western penal systems were after\nless than a century. Foucault wants the reader to consider what led to these\nchanges and how Western attitudes shifted so radically.^[2]\n\nHe believes that the question of the nature of these changes is best asked by\nassuming that they were not used to create a more humanitarian penal system,\nnor to more exactly punish or rehabilitate, but as part of a continuing\ntrajectory of subjection. Foucault wants to tie scientific knowledge and\ntechnological development to the development of the prison to prove this\npoint. He defines a \"micro-physics\" of power, which is constituted by a power\nthat is strategic and tactical rather than acquired, preserved or possessed.\nHe explains that power and knowledge imply one another, as opposed to the\ncommon belief that knowledge exists independently of power relations\n(knowledge is always contextualized in a framework which makes it\nintelligible, so the humanizing discourse of psychiatry is an expression of\nthe tactics of oppression).^[3]^: 26\u201327 That is, the ground of the game of\npower is not won by \"liberation\", because liberation already exists as a facet\nof subjection. \"The man described for us, whom we are invited to free, is\nalready in himself the effect of a subjection much more profound than\nhimself.\"^[3]^: 30 The problem for Foucault is in some sense a theoretical\nmodelling which posits a soul, an identity (the use of soul being fortunate\nsince \"identity\" or \"name\" would not properly express the method of\nsubjection\u2014e.g., if mere materiality were used as a way of tracking\nindividuals then the method of punishment would not have switched from torture\nto psychiatry) which allows a whole materiality of prison to develop. In \"What\nis an Author?\" Foucault also deals with notion of identity, and its use as a\nmethod of control, regulation, and tracking.^[2]\n\nHe begins by examining public torture and execution. He argues that the public\nspectacle of torture and execution was a theatrical forum, the original\nintentions of which eventually produced several unintended consequences.\nFoucault stresses the exactitude with which torture is carried out, and\ndescribes an extensive legal framework in which it operates to achieve\nspecific purposes. Foucault describes public torture as a ceremony.\n\nThe intended purposes were:\n\n  * To make the secret public (according to Foucault, the investigation was kept entirely secret even from the accused). The secret of the investigation and the conclusion of the magistrates was justified by the publicity of the torture.\n  * To show the effect of investigation on confession. (According to Foucault, torture could occur during the investigation, because partial proofs meant partial guilt. If the torture failed to elicit a confession then the investigation was stopped and innocence assumed. A confession legitimized the investigation and any torture that occurred.)\n  * Reflecting the violence of the original crime onto the convict's body for all to see, in order for it to be manifested then annulled by reciprocating the violence of the crime on the criminal.\n  * Enacting the revenge upon the convict's body, which the monarch seeks for having been injured by the crime. Foucault argues that the law was considered an extension of the sovereign's body, and so the revenge must take the form of harming the convict's body.\n\n> \"It [torture] assured the articulation of the written on the oral, the\n> secret on the public, the procedure of investigation on the operation of the\n> confession; it made it possible to reproduce the crime on the visible body\n> of the criminal; in the same horror, the crime had to be manifested and\n> annulled. It also made the body of the condemned man the place where the\n> vengeance of the sovereign was applied, the anchoring point for a\n> manifestation of power, an opportunity of affirming the dissymmetry of\n> forces.\"^[3]^: 55\n\nFoucault looks at public torture as the outcome \"of a certain mechanism of\npower\" that views crime in a military schema. Crime and rebellion are akin to\na declaration of war. The sovereign was not concerned with demonstrating the\nground for the enforcement of its laws, but of identifying enemies and\nattacking them, the power of which was renewed by the ritual of investigation\nand the ceremony of public torture.^[3]^: 57\n\nSome unintended consequences were:\n\n  * Providing a forum for the convict's body to become a focus of sympathy and admiration.\n  * Redistributing blame: the executioner rather than the convict becomes the locus of shame.\n  * Creating a site of conflict between the masses and the sovereign at the convict's body. Foucault notes that public executions often led to riots in support of the prisoner. Frustration for the inefficiency of this economy of power could be directed towards and coalesce around the site of torture and execution.\n\nPublic torture and execution was a method the sovereign deployed to express\nhis or her power, and it did so through the ritual of investigation and the\nceremony of execution\u2014the reality and horror of which was supposed to express\nthe omnipotence of the sovereign but actually revealed that the sovereign's\npower depended on the participation of the people. Torture was made public in\norder to create fear in the people, and to force them to participate in the\nmethod of control by agreeing with its verdicts. But problems arose in cases\nin which the people through their actions disagreed with the sovereign, by\nheroizing the victim (admiring the courage in facing death) or in moving to\nphysically free the criminal or to redistribute the effects of the\nstrategically deployed power. Thus, he argues, the public execution was\nultimately an ineffective use of the body, qualified as non-economical. As\nwell, it was applied non-uniformly and haphazardly. Hence, its political cost\nwas too high. It was the antithesis of the more modern concerns of the state:\norder and generalization. So it had to be reformed to allow for greater\nstability of property for the bourgeoisie.\n\n### Punishment[edit]\n\nFirstly, the switch to prison was not immediate and sudden. There was a more\ngraded change, though it ran its course rapidly. Prison was preceded by a\ndifferent form of public spectacle. The theater of public torture gave way to\npublic chain gangs. Punishment became \"gentle\", though not for humanitarian\nreasons, Foucault suggests. He argues that reformists were unhappy with the\nunpredictable, unevenly distributed nature of the violence the sovereign would\ninflict on the convict. The sovereign's right to punish was so\ndisproportionate that it was ineffective and uncontrolled. Reformists felt the\npower to punish and judge should become more evenly distributed, the state's\npower must be a form of public power. This, according to Foucault, was of more\nconcern to reformists than humanitarian arguments.\n\nOut of this movement towards generalized punishment, a thousand \"mini-\ntheatres\" of punishment would have been created wherein the convicts' bodies\nwould have been put on display in a more ubiquitous, controlled, and effective\nspectacle. Prisoners would have been forced to do work that reflected their\ncrime, thus repaying society for their infractions. This would have allowed\nthe public to see the convicts' bodies enacting their punishment, and thus to\nreflect on the crime. But these experiments lasted less than twenty years.\n\nFoucault argues that this theory of \"gentle\" punishment represented the first\nstep away from the excessive force of the sovereign, and towards more\ngeneralized and controlled means of punishment. But he suggests that the shift\ntowards prison that followed was the result of a new \"technology\" and ontology\nfor the body being developed in the 18th century, the \"technology\" of\ndiscipline, and the ontology of \"man as machine.\"\n\n### Discipline[edit]\n\nThe emergence of prison as the form of punishment for every crime grew out of\nthe development of discipline in the 18th and 19th centuries, according to\nFoucault. He looks at the development of highly refined forms of discipline,\nof discipline concerned with the smallest and most precise aspects of a\nperson's body. Discipline, he suggests, developed a new economy and politics\nfor bodies. Modern institutions required that bodies must be individuated\naccording to their tasks, as well as for training, observation, and control.\nTherefore, he argues, discipline created a whole new form of individuality for\nbodies, which enabled them to perform their duty within the new forms of\neconomic, political, and military organizations emerging in the modern age and\ncontinuing to today.\n\nThe individuality that discipline constructs (for the bodies it controls) has\nfour characteristics, namely it makes individuality which is:\n\n  * Cellular\u2014determining the spatial distribution of the bodies\n  * Organic\u2014ensuring that the activities required of the bodies are \"natural\" for them\n  * Genetic\u2014controlling the evolution over time of the activities of the bodies\n  * Combinatory\u2014allowing for the combination of the force of many bodies into a single massive force\n\nFoucault suggests this individuality can be implemented in systems that are\nofficially egalitarian, but use discipline to construct non-egalitarian power\nrelations:\n\n    Historically, the process by which the bourgeoisie became in the course of the eighteenth century the politically dominant class was masked by the establishment of an explicit, coded and formally egalitarian juridical framework, made possible by the organization of a parliamentary, representative regime. But the development and generalization of disciplinary mechanisms constituted the other, dark side of these processes. The general juridical form that guaranteed a system of rights that were egalitarian in principle was supported by these tiny, everyday, physical mechanisms, by all those systems of micro-power that are essentially non-egalitarian and asymmetrical that we call the disciplines.^[3]^: 222\n\nFoucault's argument is that discipline creates \"docile bodies\", ideal for the\nnew economics, politics and warfare of the modern industrial age \u2013 bodies that\nfunction in factories, ordered military regiments, and school classrooms. But,\nto construct docile bodies the disciplinary institutions must be able to\nconstantly observe and record the bodies they control and ensure the\ninternalization of the disciplinary individuality within the bodies being\ncontrolled. That is, discipline must come about without excessive force\nthrough careful observation, and molding of the bodies into the correct form\nthrough this observation. This requires a particular form of institution,\nexemplified, Foucault argues, by Jeremy Bentham's panopticon. This\narchitectural model, though it was never adopted by architects according to\nBentham's exact blueprint, becomes an important conceptualization of power\nrelations for prison reformers of the 19th century, and its general principle\nis a recurring theme in modern prison construction.\n\nThe panopticon was the ultimate realization of a modern disciplinary\ninstitution. It allowed for constant observation characterized by an \"unequal\ngaze\"; the constant possibility of observation. Perhaps the most important\nfeature of the panopticon was that it was specifically designed so that the\nprisoner could never be sure whether they were being observed at any moment.\nThe unequal gaze caused the internalization of disciplinary individuality, and\nthe docile body required of its inmates. This means one is less likely to\nbreak rules or laws if they believe they are being watched, even if they are\nnot. Thus, prisons, and specifically those that follow the model of the\npanopticon, provide the ideal form of modern punishment. Foucault argues that\nthis is why the generalized, \"gentle\" punishment of public work gangs gave way\nto the prison. It was the ideal modernization of punishment, so its eventual\ndominance was natural.\n\nHaving laid out the emergence of the prison as the dominant form of\npunishment, Foucault devotes the rest of the book to examining its precise\nform and function in society, laying bare the reasons for its continued use,\nand questioning the assumed results of its use.\n\n### Prison[edit]\n\nIn examining the construction of the prison as the central means of criminal\npunishment, Foucault builds a case for the idea that prison became part of a\nlarger \"carceral system\" that has become an all-encompassing sovereign\ninstitution in modern society. Prison is one part of a vast network, including\nschools, military institutions, hospitals, and factories, which build a\npanoptic society for its members. This system creates \"disciplinary\ncareers\"^[3]^: 300 for those locked within its corridors. It is operated under\nthe scientific authority of medicine, psychology, and criminology. Moreover,\nit operates according to principles that ensure that it \"cannot fail to\nproduce delinquents.\"^[3]^: 266 Delinquency, indeed, is produced when social\npetty crime (such as taking wood from the lord's lands) is no longer\ntolerated, creating a class of specialized \"delinquents\" acting as the\npolice's proxy in surveillance of society.\n\nThe structures Foucault chooses to use as his starting positions help\nhighlight his conclusions. In particular, his choice as a perfect prison of\nthe penal institution at Mettray helps personify the carceral system. Within\nit is included the Prison, the School, the Church, and the work-house\n(industry) \u2013 all of which feature heavily in his argument. The prisons at\nNeufchatel and Mettray were perfect examples for Foucault, because they, even\nin their original state, began to show the traits for which Foucault was\nsearching. Moreover, they showed the body of knowledge being developed about\nthe prisoners, the creation of the 'delinquent' class, and the disciplinary\ncareers emerging. ^[4]\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\nThe publication of the book was \"widely noted in major French cultural venues\"\nof the time such as Le Nouvel Observateur and Le Monde.^[5]^: 148 After its\npublication in English in 1977 it was \"widely reviewed in non-academic\nvenues\", however scholarly reviews were \"far less common\".^[5]^: 149\n\nThe historian Peter Gay described Discipline and Punish as the key text by\nFoucault that has influenced scholarship on the theory and practice of 19th\ncentury prisons. Though Gay wrote that Foucault \"breathed fresh air into the\nhistory of penology and severely damaged, without wholly discrediting,\ntraditional Whig optimism about the humanization of penitentiaries as one long\nsuccess story\", he nevertheless gave a negative assessment of Foucault's work,\nendorsing the critical view of Gordon Wright in his 1983 book Between the\nGuillotine and Liberty: Two Centuries of the Crime Problem in France. Gay\nconcluded that Foucault and his followers overstate the extent to which\nkeeping \"the masses quiet\" motivates those in power, thereby underestimating\nfactors such as \"contingency, complexity, the sheer anxiety or stupidity of\npower holders\", or their authentic idealism.^[6]\n\nLaw Professor David Garland wrote an explication and critique of Discipline\nand Punish. Towards the end, he sums up the main critiques that have been\nmade. He states, \"the major critical theme which emerges, and is independently\nmade by many different critics, concerns Foucault's overestimation of the\npolitical dimension. Discipline and Punish consistently proposes an\nexplanation in terms of power\u2014sometimes in the absence of any supporting\nevidence\u2014where other historians would see a need for other factors and\nconsiderations to be brought into account.\"^[7]\n\nAnother criticism leveled against Foucault's approach is that he often studies\nthe discourse of \"prisons\" rather than their concrete practice; this is taken\nup by Fred Alford:\n\n> \"Foucault has mistaken the idea of prison, as reflected in the discourse of\n> criminologists, for its practice. More precisely put, Foucault presents the\n> utopian ideals of eighteenth-century prison reformers, most of which were\n> never realized, as though they were the actual reforms of the eighteenth and\n> nineteenth centuries. One can see this even in the pictures in Discipline\n> and Punish, many of which are drawings for ideal prisons that were never\n> built. One photograph is of the panopticon prison buildings at Stateville,\n> but it is evidently an old photograph, one in which no inmates are evident.\n> Nor are the blankets and cardboard that now enclose the cells.\"^[8]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Discourse, a Foucauldian concept developed in Discipline and Punish, among other works.\n  * Drill commands\n  * Foucauldian discourse analysis\n  * Governmentality\n  * The History of Sexuality\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Schwan, Anne; Shapiro, Stephen (2011).
