(317.9 kB)\n\n### Overview\n\nDuring 2020, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b\nviruses arose from previously circulating influenza A(H5Nx) viruses and spread\npredominantly via migratory birds to many parts of Africa, Asia and Europe.\nThe epizootic has led to unprecedented numbers of deaths in wild birds and\ncaused outbreaks in domestic poultry. In late 2021, these viruses crossed to\nNorth America and subsequently South America in October 2022. Additionally,\nglobally, there have been increased detections of A(H5N1) viruses in non-avian\nspecies including wild and domestic (including companion and farmed)\nterrestrial and marine mammals and, more recently in goats and dairy cattle in\nthe United States of America. The majority, with some regional exceptions, of\nthe HPAI A(H5N1) viruses characterized genetically since 2020 belong to the\n2.3.4.4b clade. Since the beginning of 2021, 28 detections of A(H5N1) in\nhumans have been reported to WHO, including a case who had exposure to dairy\ncattle presumed to be infected with A(H5N1) virus. Of these human cases, where\nthe haemagglutinin (HA) H5 clade is known, 13 have been caused by clade\n2.3.4.4b viruses. This joint FAO/WHO/WOAH risk assessment focuses on A(H5N1)\nviruses characterized since 2021 and assesses the public health risk as well\nas the risk of the virus spread among animals.\n\nWHO Team\n\nGlobal Influenza Programme (GIP), Global Influenza Surveillance and Response\nSystem\n\n  * Regions\n\n    * Africa\n    * Americas\n    * Eastern Mediterranean\n    * Europe\n    * South-East Asia\n    * Western Pacific\n  * Policies\n\n    * Cyber security\n    * Ethics\n    * Permissions and licensing\n    * Preventing sexual exploitation\n    * Terms of use\n  * About us\n\n    * Careers\n    * Library\n    * Procurement\n    * Publications\n    * Frequently asked questions\n    * Newsletters\n\n## Contact us\n\nReport misconduct\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\u00a9 2024\n\nWHO\n\n", "frontpage": false}
