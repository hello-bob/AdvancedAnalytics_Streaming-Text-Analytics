Magellan\u2019s carracks sailed from Sanl\u00facar, a\ndozen or so sleek, swift Portuguese caravels put to sea from Lisbon. Taking\nadvantage of the same favorable wind as Magellan\u2019s fleet but making much\nbetter time than that tubby collective, they headed for a point in the\nAtlantic Ocean about 150 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of the Canary\nIslands, where they had orders to take patrolling stations, setting up a sort\nof blockade.\n\nThe Portuguese fleet\u2019s instructions had come down directly from King Manuel\nhimself. With reason and threats having failed to sway Magellan from his\npurpose, he had decided to use force. His fleet would be waiting for\nMagellan\u2019s after it left the Canaries to undertake the long Atlantic crossing.\nThe Portuguese ships were smaller than the Spanish ones, to be sure, but these\nwere proper warships, fast and maneuverable and bristling with cannons. They\nought to have no trouble intimidating their quarry into raising the white flag\nof submission. They would then arrest the captain general along with any other\nPortuguese onboard, seize all of the maps and charts, and \u201cescort\u201d the Spanish\nships back where they had come from.\n\nIt was an audacious if not desperate last-ditch gamble, but Manuel believed it\nwas one well worth taking in the name of protecting his Asian empire from\nSpanish incursion, even if just for a little while longer. He was counting on\nyoung King Charles not being ready go to war over the incident \u2014 not when he\nalready had so many other problems on his plate, from the unrest being stirred\nup by Martin Luther in Germany to his still-precarious standing in Spain.\n\nMeanwhile, blissfully unaware of what its captain general\u2019s sovereign had\ncooked up for it, the Spanish fleet made its way toward the Canary Islands\nproper. As any commander worth his salt would have done, Magellan used this\nfirst, routine leg of his fleet\u2019s epic voyage to inculcate the habits that\nwould hopefully see it through the later, far more perilous stages of the\njourney.\n\nA sailing ship was an intricate system, one of the most complex yet invented\nby humans. Even when the weather was fair and the winds were favorable, as\nthey were now, it required constant attention to stay on course and in good\nworking order.\n\nThe chain of command aboard each ship descended from the captain to the pilot\nand then on to the ship\u2019s master, the man who knew the vessel better than\nanyone else and was responsible for ensuring that it was always in tiptop\nshape. Each of this trio of officers was in charge of his own company of the\ncrew, who worked the sails, ropes, and rudder for him when he was on the\nquarterdeck. Each watch lasted four hours, measured by the officer of the deck\nusing a half-hour glass; when the glass had run out for the eighth time, that\nwatch was over. To keep the three companies from always working the same hours\nof the day and night, the usual progression of watches was scrambled at\nmidnight, with one of the companies coming on duty again after a rest of just\nfour rather than eight hours. This helped to prevent complacency, which could\nbe as insidiously deadly for a ship at sea as any storm.\n\nDuring the daylight hours, the ship\u2019s master mobilized that part of the crew\nthat wasn\u2019t on watch for the additional swabbing, pumping, caulking, tying,\nand adjusting that were required to keep a vessel shipshape. In reality, it\nwas the master who really ran a ship in a day-to-day sense, in close\npartnership with the boatswain, the officer who was fourth in the chain of\ncommand. (In their duties and status, these positions roughly correspond to\nthe executive officer and warrant officer of a modern ship.) The masters and\nboatswains of Magellan\u2019s fleet were especially vital, given that three of the\nfive captains knew almost nothing of ships; even Magellan himself was, as we\nhave seen, more of a soldier who went to sea than a sailor born and bred.\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t an easy life for the ordinary seamen of the crew, it wasn\u2019t a\nterrible one either; many a European peasant laborer would happily have traded\nplaces with them. If the humanity of their officers wasn\u2019t enough to ensure\nthat they were treated reasonably well whenever circumstances allowed for it,\npracticality did the trick. A content and well-fed crew was much better to\nhave in a pinch than an angry, hungry one.\n\nThe early stages of a longer voyage were generally the most pleasant for\neveryone onboard, and this crazily long voyage was no exception. The cows and\npigs that had been loaded in Spain were slaughtered one by one to provide\nfresh meat. No one was permanently assigned to the role of cook. Instead the\nsailors shared the duty of roasting the great slabs of meat in olive oil and\nspices in a firebox on the forecastle. (Fire of any sort being a dangerous\nthing to have aboard a ship made of wood, barrels of seawater were kept ready\nnear the firebox to douse the flames if they got out of hand.) There was\nplenty of wine to wash the meat down with, and there were fresh fruit and\nvegetables to heap beside it. Even the rats \u2014 every sailor\u2019s bane \u2014 hadn\u2019t\ngotten too out of control yet this early in the voyage.\n\nSo, it was a life of hard work, but one not without its pleasures and its\ncamaraderie. The ship\u2019s boy rang the changes of each day in a high, clear\nsoprano:\n\n> On deck, on deck, Mr. Mariners of the right side, Hurry up on deck, Mr.\n> Pilot\u2019s watch, For it\u2019s already time. Shake a leg!\n\nEach new rosy-fingered dawn was greeted with a chanted prayer:\n\n> Blessed be the light of the day and the Holy Cross, we say, And the Lord of\n> V\u00e9rit\u00e9 and the Holy Trinity. Blessed be the immortal soul, And the Lord who\n> keeps it whole. Blessed be the light of day, And He who sends the night\n> away.\n\nIn a glorious early autumn like this one, there were worse places to be than\nskimming along the ocean\u2019s broad back, worse fates than that of curling up to\nsleep with hearty food in one\u2019s belly, the fresh air in one\u2019s lungs, the\ncomforting creaking and flapping of a well-ordered sailing ship in one\u2019s ears,\nand the pleasant tingle in one\u2019s limbs of a body worked well but not to\nexhaustion. There was a peculiar, paradoxical freedom amidst the rules and\nregulations of life at sea: a freedom from the social structures and\nstrictures of Old Europe, which had kept peasants bound to their land for time\nimmemorial. Sailors were by definition unbound to the earth. The guiding ethic\nof a well-run ship was efficiency; it was a place where smarts and skill could\ntake even a low-bred man surprisingly far. Small wonder that people talked of\nrunning away to sea. The hermetically sealed society of a ship at sea offered\nan escape from the suffocating norms of home, where a man could be only that\nwhich he was born to be \u2014 no more, no less.\n\nThe fleet stayed together and stayed in touch using visual signals. The\nflagship Trinidad kept a bright fire burning on its poop deck throughout the\nnight, so that the others could see it and follow. (Needless to say, plenty of\ncasks of seawater surrounded this fire as well...) Changes in course, in sail\nconfiguration, and much else were signaled using four lanterns on the poop\ndeck, which were lit in different combinations that corresponded to different\ninstructions; the other ships then lit lanterns of their own to signal that\nthey had received and would follow the new orders.\n\nThe fleet reached Tenerife, the largest of the seven Canary Islands, on\nSeptember 26, just six days after leaving Spain. This archipelago of eternal\nspring, where the sun shined always warmly but never hotly, lay at the extreme\nedge of the world that the ancient Romans had known. It had been a place of\nmyth and magic to them, sometimes associated with Plato\u2019s legendary Atlantis.\nThe Romans had marveled at its strange beaches of black and white sand. It was\nsaid that one of the islands had nary a pool nor fountain upon it, but got all\nof its freshwater from a single cloud that descended at precisely noon each\nday to pour down mana from heaven on a single giant tree at its center. The\nrain that pattered down from the leaves of the tree sustained everything else\nthat grew and lived upon the island, including the people, who required no\nother nourishment.\n\nAnother, more recent legend said that that the people the Portuguese and\nSpaniards had encountered when they returned to the Canary Islands at the dawn\nof the Age of Exploration had belonged to a tribe on the African mainland\nduring ancient times. This tribe had resisted Roman efforts to subjugate it so\nimplacably that it had finally won a measure of respect from the centurions,\nwho had offered the tribespeople a watery exile in lieu of annihilation \u2014\nalbeit not before cutting out all of their tongues so as to ensure that they\ncouldn\u2019t boast to any chance visitors about how they had fought the imperial\nlegions to a standstill.\n\nOther contemporary Europeans looked at the blond hair and blue eyes that were\ncommon among the native Canarians and concluded that they must be the\ndescendants of some shipwrecked Viking or Celtic wanderers of old. Regardless\nof what story you believed, no one could deny that the natives of the island\nhad fought the superior weapons of their European colonizers with admirable\ntenacity. Tenerife hadn\u2019t been fully, definitively subdued by the Spanish\nuntil 1495, sixteen years after Portugal and Spain signed the Treaty of\nAlc\u00e1\u00e7ovas, in which Portugal agreed to cede the Canary Islands to Spain in\nreturn for Spanish recognition of its right to the Azores, the Cape Verde\nIslands, and Madeira.\n\nChristopher Columbus had stopped at the Canaries before crossing the Atlantic\non three of his four trips to the New World, a practice that was still\nmaintained by most Spanish ships bound for the Americas. Santa Cruz, the\nprincipal port near the northeastern tip of Tenerife, was wild enough to make\nSeville look tame, its streets, wharves, bars, and brothels teeming with\nsailors who were either about to attempt a perilous ocean crossing or were\njust returning from one, secure in the knowledge that their financial reward\nwas waiting for them back in Spain. In either case, they were ready to let off\nsteam. Their drunken singing was the constant background note of life in the\ntown, punctuated by the occasional percussive accent of fisticuffs or worse.\nThe spent and bedraggled revelers traditionally ended their stay on Tenerife\nby gathering in the Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n \u2014 the Church of the Immaculate\nConception \u2014 to confess their recent sins and beg the Virgin Mary for safe\npassage to their next destination.\n\nThe sailors of Magellan\u2019s fleet presumably behaved no better nor worse than\nany of the others who came to Santa Cruz. Magellan himself, however, took to\nthe crowded streets with soberer objectives in mind. He needed to top up his\nsupplies for the long Atlantic crossing, even though it meant paying the\nexorbitant prices of a last port of call. Additionally, this was the first and\nlast place the expedition would visit with reasonably good links to the\nEuropean mainland, giving him a final chance to send and receive\ncorrespondence. And indeed, Magellan found a letter from his father-in-law\nDiogo Barbosa already waiting for him in the Santa Cruz post office. It said\nthat Juan de Cartagena, Gasper de Quesada, and Luis de Mendoza, those three\nloyalists to Bishop Fonseca who also happened to be the captains of three of\nthe five ships of the expedition, had been heard openly boasting about their\nplans to pitch their Portuguese captain general overboard and take over\nthemselves as soon as they were well away from Europe. \u201cKeep a good watch,\u201d\nwrote Barbosa. Magellan dashed off a reply stating the usual: that he would do\nso, but that he would above all do the duty he had pledged to King Charles to\ndo.\n\nIn addition to dead-enders and cutthroat businessmen, a town like Santa Cruz\ncollected scuttlebutt like ships\u2019 holds collected rats. Magellan\u2019s crew came\nback from the bars with disquieting reports of a fleet of Portuguese caravels\nthat had just come tearing past the Canaries, their purpose unknown. Magellan\ndigested the reports with equanimity, showing no outward sign of concern,\nrevealing his thoughts to no one.\n\nBut he was concerned. Very much so. On October 1, he removed his fleet down\nthe coast of Tenerife to a much smaller port called Monterose. There it took\non a fresh load of pitch, an essential caulking material aboard ships such as\nthese, without which they would sink within hours. (Even with it, they leaked\nconstantly; a sailor or two was always kept busy pumping seawater out of the\nbilges.) On the afternoon of October 2, with the pitch duly loaded, Magellan\nissued an unexpected order: the ships were to sail that very night at\nmidnight, sneaking out of the Canaries like the fugitives they were.\n\nThe men wondered at this; the cover of darkness was all well and good, but it\nwas not going to get them past a determined Portuguese blockade, if that was\nreally what they were facing. Were they giving up and going home?\n\nAh, they of little faith! They hadn\u2019t yet learned that their captain general\nwas, every bit as much as Homer\u2019s Odysseus, a man of twists and turns. He had\na plan. He always had a plan.\n\nDid you enjoy this chapter? If so, please think about pitching in to help me\nmake many more like it.
