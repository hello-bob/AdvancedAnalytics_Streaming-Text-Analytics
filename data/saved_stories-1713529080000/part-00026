You can buy it here.\n\nThis is a long human life in years:\n\nAnd here\u2019s a human life in months:\n\nBut today, we\u2019re going to look at a human life in weeks:\n\nEach row of weeks makes up one year. That\u2019s how many weeks it takes to turn a\nnewborn into a 90-year-old.\n\nIt kind of feels like our lives are made up of a countless number of weeks.\nBut there they are\u2014fully countable\u2014staring you in the face.\n\nBefore we discuss things further, let\u2019s look at how a typical American spends\ntheir weeks:\n\nSources: 12345\n\nThere are some other interesting ways to use the weeks chart:\n\nBut how about your weeks?\n\nSometimes life seems really short, and other times it seems impossibly long.\nBut this chart helps to emphasize that it\u2019s most certainly finite. Those are\nyour weeks and they\u2019re all you\u2019ve got.\n\nGiven that fact, the only appropriate word to describe your weeks is precious.\nThere are trillions upon trillions of weeks in eternity, and those are your\ntiny handful. Going with the \u201cprecious\u201d theme, let\u2019s imagine that each of your\nweeks is a small gem, like a 2mm, .05 carat diamond. Here\u2019s one:\n\nIf you multiply the volume of a .05 carat diamond by the number of weeks in 90\nyears (4,680), it adds up to just under a tablespoon.\n\nLooking at this spoon of diamonds, there\u2019s one very clear question to ask:\n\u201cAre you making the most of your weeks?\u201d\n\nIn thinking about my own weeks and how I tend to use them, I decided that\nthere are two good ways to use a diamond:\n\n1) Enjoying the diamond\n\n2) Building something to make your future diamonds or the diamonds of others\nmore enjoyable\n\nIn other words, you have this small spoonful of diamonds and you really want\nto create a life in which they\u2019re making you happy. And if a diamond is not\nmaking you happy, it should only be because you\u2019re using it to make other\ndiamonds go down better\u2014either your own in the future or those of others. In\nthe ideal situation, you\u2019re well balanced between #1 and #2 and you\u2019re often\nable to accomplish both simultaneously (like those times when you love your\njob).\n\nOf course, if a diamond is enjoyable but by enjoying it you\u2019re screwing your\nfuture diamonds (an Instant Gratification Monkey specialty), that\u2019s not so\ngood. Likewise, if you\u2019re using diamond after diamond to build something for\nyour future, but it\u2019s not making you happy and seems like a long-term thing\nwith no end in sight, that\u2019s not great either.\n\nBut the worst possible way to use a diamond is by accomplishing neither #1 nor\n#2 above. Sometimes \u201cneither\u201d happens when you\u2019re in either the wrong career\nor the wrong relationship, and it\u2019s often a symptom of either a shortage of\ncourage, self-discipline, or creativity. Sometimes \u201cneither\u201d happens because\nof a debilitating problem.\n\nWe\u2019ve all had Neither Weeks and they don\u2019t feel good. And when a long string\nof Neither Weeks happens, you become depressed, frustrated, hopeless, and a\nbunch of other upsetting adjectives. It\u2019s inevitable to have Neither Weeks,\nand sometimes they\u2019re important\u2014it\u2019s often a really bad Neither Week that\nleads you to a life-changing epiphany\u2014but trying to minimize your Neither\nWeeks is a worthy goal.\n\nIt can all be summed up like this:\n\nThe Life Calendar\n\nOne of the ways we end up in NeitherLand is by not thinking about things hard\nenough\u2014so one of the most critical skills is continual reflection and self-\nawareness. Otherwise, you can fall into an unconscious rut and waste a bunch\nof precious diamonds.\n\nTo help both you and ourselves stay conscious and avoid NeitherLand, we\u2019ve\ncreated a Life Calendar that lays out every week of your life on one sheet of\npaper. We don\u2019t typically bring products into posts, but in this case, they go\nhand-in-hand.\n\nThe calendar is a 24\u2032\u2032 by 36\u2032\u2032 poster on high-quality poster paper, made to be\nwritten on and last for decades. It costs $20 and you can buy it here.\n\nBesides the purpose of encouraging regular reflection, we hope the calendar\ncan help you feel more oriented in your life, help you set goals and hold\nyourself to them, and remind you to be proud of yourself for what you\u2019ve\naccomplished and grateful for the diamonds in your spoon.\n\nHow you use the calendar is totally open for creativity. Some possibilities:\n\n  * Highlight the weeks in the past in different colors to segment them into \u201clife chapters\u201d\u2014i.e. High School, College, Job 1, Job 2, New City, Engagement, Marriage, etc., or maybe a whole other conception of what a life chapter means to you. You can also mark special boxes where key turning points happened.\n  * Write something in each week\u2019s box as it goes by\u2014the boxes are large enough to write a few words in with a sharp pencil.\n  * Plot out goals for the future by making a mark on a future box and visually seeing exactly how many weeks you have to get there.\n  * If you\u2019re a new parent, it might be fun to make one for your child so they can look at it later and have some info on what happened in the first few years of their life.\n  * Or maybe you\u2019d rather leave it totally untouched.\n\nBoth the week chart above and the life calendar are a reminder to me that this\ngrid of empty boxes staring me in the face is mine. We tend to feel locked\ninto whatever life we\u2019re living, but this pallet of empty boxes can be\nabsolutely whatever we want it to be. Everyone you know, everyone you admire,\nevery hero in history\u2014they did it all with that same grid of empty boxes.\n\nThe boxes can also be a reminder that life is forgiving. No matter what\nhappens each week, you get a new fresh box to work with the next week. It\nmakes me want to skip the New Year\u2019s Resolutions\u2014they never work anyway\u2014and\nfocus on making New Week\u2019s Resolutions every Sunday night. Each blank box is\nan opportunity to crush the week\u2014a good thing to remember.\n\nThe Calendar:\n\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new\nposts when they come out.\n\nTo support Wait But Why, visit our Patreon page.\n\n______\n\nTo print this post or read it offline, you can buy the PDF.\n\nMore ways to put life in perspective:\n\nLife is a Picture, But You Live in a Pixel\n\nPutting Time in Perspective\n\nYour Family: Past, Present, and Future\n\nTaming the Mammoth: Why You Shouldn\u2019t Care What Other People Think of You\n\n  1. http://www.gallup.com/poll/168707/average-retirement-age-rises.aspx\n\n  2. http://www.babycenter.com/0_surprising-facts-about-birth-in-the-united-states_1372273.bc\n\n  3. http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/12/14/barely-half-of-u-s-adults-are-married-a-record-low/\n\n  4. http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p70-125.pdf\n\n  5. http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/08/14/job-hopping-is-the-new-normal-for-millennials-three-ways-to-prevent-a-human-resource-nightmare/\n\n317Save\n\n#### About Tim Urban\n\nView all posts by Tim Urban \u2192\n\nPrevious Post\n\nNext Post\n\n### RECOMMENDED POSTS\n\n  * ##### A Short History of My Last Six Years\n\nFebruary 17, 2023\n\n  * ##### How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)\n\nApril 11, 2018\n\n  * ##### 100 Blocks a Day\n\nOctober 21, 2016\n\nHome Archive\n\nPowered by Ajaxy\n\n#### Post Types\n\n  * Post (216)\n  * Forum Topic (85)\n  * Page (44)\n  * Mandarin (10)\n\n#### Categories\n\n  * Uncategorized (127)\n  * Dinner Table Topics (84)\n  * Category #1 (59)\n  * Minis (42)\n  * The Shed (31)\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * funny (38)\n  * science (29)\n  * psychology (21)\n  * society (21)\n  * selfhelp (16)\n\n#### Year\n\n  * 2024 (2)\n  * 2023 (43)\n  * 2021 (2)\n  * 2020 (4)\n  * 2019 (2)\n\nJoin 601K other humans and have new posts emailed to you.\n\nFollow these special men\n\n408,687\n\n771,601\n\n203,395\n\n  * ##### Popular Posts\n\n  * ##### The AI Revolution\n\nJanuary 22, 2015 1,157\n\n  * ##### Why Procrastinators Procrastinate\n\nOctober 30, 2013 592\n\n  * ##### The Fermi Paradox\n\nMay 21, 2014 1,420\n\n  * ##### How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars\n\nAugust 16, 2015 976\n\n  * ##### How to Pick a Life Partner\n\nFebruary 12, 2014 314\n\n  * ##### Why Gen Y Yuppies Are Unhappy\n\nSeptember 9, 2013 1,232\n\n  * ##### Putting Time In Perspective\n\nAugust 22, 2013 568\n\n  * ##### How to Name a Baby\n\nDecember 11, 2013 330\n\n  * ##### Why You Should Stop Caring What Other People Think\n\nJune 13, 2014 365\n\n  * ##### Religion for the Nonreligious\n\nOctober 19, 2014 848\n\n  * ##### From Muhammad to ISIS: Iraq's Full Story\n\nSeptember 12, 2014 328\n\n  * ##### The Tail End\n\nDecember 11, 2015 316\n\nFollow these special men\n\n408,687\n\n771,601\n\n203,395\n\n#### Popular Posts\n\n  * Tales From the Eclipse\n  * All My Thoughts After 40 Hours in the Vision Pro\n  * The Ant-Honey Problem\n  * 10 Thoughts From the Fourth Trimester\n  * Idea Labs Opt-Out\n  * Audiobook\n  * A Short History of My Last Six Years\n  * What\u2019s Our Problem?
