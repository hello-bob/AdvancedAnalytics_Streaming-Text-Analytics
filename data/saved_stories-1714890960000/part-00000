And we\u2019ve got two major stories from the gaming world this\nweek.\n\nThe first story comes from the game Helldivers 2, which is one of the biggest\nbreakout hit games of the last year. It\u2019s true success story - the first\nHelldivers was moderately successful but nothing special, while the second one\nhas sold more than 8 million copies in its first two months, rocketing to the\ntop of the charts. The game\u2019s player base is so large and enthusiastic that\nthey\u2019re even creating unique cultural moments - I\u2019ve previously talked about\nthe community\u2019s fun Joel Conspiracies here.\n\n#### Weekly Scroll - Spotify Struggling\n\nJeremiah Johnson\n\n\u00b7\n\nMar 10\n\nRead full story\n\nThe game, developed by Arrowhead Studios and published by Sony, is playable on\neither PlayStation or Windows/PC, with cross-platform play enabled. That\u2019s\nboth a source of strength and the cause of their downfall.\n\nYesterday, Sony posted a notice that Helldivers players who play on PC would\nneed to link to a PlayStation Network account in order to keep playing. And\nthe community, to put it lightly, is not happy:\n\nThe game has received more than 80,000 negative reviews in the last two days.\nFans are sharing tips for how to request refunds. The Helldivers subreddit is\nin full meltdown, with the mood being almost universally against the game\nthey\u2019re all there to play. Why is it such a big deal to link a PlayStation\naccount?\n\nThere are a few reasons the players are so upset. The first is that there\u2019s no\nactual reason for the change - the game has been out for around three months\nat this point and never required PC players to have a PlayStation account\nbefore. Making it a requirement months after release when there\u2019s no technical\nneed seems stupid. And of course, it\u2019s not like Sony is known for their data\nsecurity - Helldivers fans are pointing out the long history of Sony data\nbreaches.\n\nThe response from the game\u2019s team has also been... mixed at best. One\ncommunity manager posted this message:\n\n> It\u2019s not like this is the first or even the fourteen mainstream game to\n> require a third-party account that takes a couple of minutes to create, but\n> if it\u2019s a dealbreaker to have to take 120 seconds out of your day to enter\n> an email and a password and then forget about it, change your Steam review\n> and make your displeasure known on a platform where it matters.\n\nSome free PR advice: might be a bad idea for your community manager\u2019s tone to\nbe \u2018Why don\u2019t you cry about it?\u2019 when the fanbase is melting down. Apparently\nfans took his advice, and now are absolutely tanking the game\u2019s rating\nanywhere they can.\n\nThe deeper problem, beyond the changing requirements for no reason, is that\nPlayStation accounts aren\u2019t even available in a large number of countries. If\nyou live in the Baltic States, or Russia, or the Philippines, or virtually\nanywhere in Africa - you\u2019re just shit out of luck. You\u2019ll be locked out of the\ngame. And trying to fake your country of origin could get you banned from the\ngame entirely. I have to sympathize with the gamers here. They\u2019ve got a point!\n\nThe developers of the game seem - that one community manager aside - seem\nsympathetic. Arrowhead Studio\u2019s CEO tweeted out that the review bombing was\nwarranted, and expressed regret this was happening at all. Other community\nmanagers have made it clear this was not an Arrowhead Studios decision but\nrather came directly from Sony, and that they\u2019re trying to fix it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the puzzle piece that makes me say \u2018Aha!\u2019. Sony is the game\u2019s\npublisher but also owns PlayStation. Of course they\u2019d want every player on\nthis very, very popular game to create a PlayStation account. From Sony\u2019s\nperspective, this move has benefits in terms of getting a bunch of new user\ndata1 and potentially getting new customers on their platform. Unfortunately\nfor them, they may have tanked the popularity of one of their biggest breakout\nhits to do so.\n\nTo me this underscores how important it is to be able to understand the\ncurrents behind online communities and social media. Most PR fiascos come from\na decision maker\u2019s inability to understand how popular sentiment works online.\nOf course this was going to backfire! A smarter move would have been to create\nsome desirable in game item or feature, and restrict that to only players with\na PSN account. You\u2019d be pulling in users gently and voluntarily rather than\nforcing them in, and complaints from players would seem less urgent and more\npetty. But Sony was thinking of players as numbers they can just move around a\nspreadsheet, when it turns out the numbers have feelings of their own and\ndon\u2019t like being treated that way.\n\n##\n\nGamergate, but more pathetic\n\nIf the last story made you sympathetic, this one will give you whatever the\nopposite of sympathy is. Schadenfreude? Yeah, let\u2019s go with schadenfreude.\nThis one\u2019s embarrassing and messy in a classic, neckbeard gamer kind of way.\n\nStellar Blade is an action-adventure game released on PlayStation2 in late\nApril. You don\u2019t need to know much about the game other than two facts: it\u2019s\ngot strongly positive reviews, and the main character Eve is a sexy anime\nlady.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with having a sexy female protagonist. Games like Nier\nAutomata and Bayonetta are critically beloved while leaning heavily into that\ntrope. There\u2019s a reason Angelia Jolie was chosen to play Lara Croft: Tomb\nRaider. We\u2019re all adults here.\n\nBut some gamers are mad! No, they\u2019re not mad that Eve wears revealing\nclothing. They\u2019re mad that the clothing isn\u2019t revealing enough. They\u2019ve\ncreated a whole campaign decrying the \u2018censorship\u2019 of Eve\u2019s sexy, sexy outfits\nthat they feel entitled to, I guess. I\u2019m trying to put this in a neutral tone,\nbut there\u2019s really no way to present this without making them out to be the\nsaddest virgins you\u2019ve ever encountered.\n\nFor reference, this is the level of \u2018censorship\u2019 we\u2019re talking about. The left\nimage was from the game\u2019s marketing material, the right in the actual in-game\ncostume. She\u2019s wearing maybe 5% more clothing.\n\nOther examples of horrifying censorship here, but you get the point.\n\nIn response to the main character showing 10% less cleavage, a group of\ndisgruntled fans have thrown enormous tantrums and created a Change.org\npetition which now has over 75,000 signatures. This is really a kick in the\npants for a certain kind of gamer, because anti-woke partisans were\ncelebrating the game before it came out as an unabashedly sexualized game that\nwas \u2018uncensored\u2019.\n\nI try not to be overly cruel to anyone on this blog, but I really do want to\nemphasize how sad this all is. These are some of the most disaffected losers\nI\u2019ve ever seen and I\u2019ve been online for decades. Just check out the\ntestimonial videos they\u2019ve voluntarily uploaded to the anti-censorship\npetition. I mean this seriously - if can report back to me that you watched\nthose four videos without cringing, I\u2019ll give you a free month paid sub. It\u2019s\nimpossible to portray them worse than they portray themselves. This is\nGamerGate reborn, only somehow sadder, whinier and more pathetic.\n\nUnlike Helldivers, where the entire community seems outraged, the Stellar\nBlade drama is an isolated phenomenon to anti-woke weirdos obsessed with their\nlittle corner of the culture war. Despite their tantrums, reviews for the game\nare very strong and the game is doing well. It this seems like a prime example\nof how cooked GamerGate is as a movement. GamerGate was instrumental in the\ncreation of the modern alt-right, but all those types have moved on from\ntaking advantage of gamers in to actual politics. The sad, angry gamers who\nwant more booba are now just ineffective losers, raging alone against a world\nthat has passed them by.\n\n##\n\nReruns on Twitch\n\nOne of the realities of being a full-time streamer is that you have a\nlooooooooooooot of time to fill on air. Most full time streamers are streaming\n4+ days a week, 6-12 hours per session. You\u2019ve got dozens of hours of airtime\neach week, and you\u2019ve got to fill it with something. This why gaming is so\npopular - it\u2019s an easy way to keep your audience engaged while you burn\nthrough those hours.\n\nSomething else that can eat up the hours is watching TV with your audience.\nJust pop on some DragonBall Z, some Game of Thrones, you know? Those are\nhugely popular shows, your chat likes your commentary and personality, what\ncould go wrong?\n\nWell, it turns out copyright is a thing that still exists online! Lots of\nstreamers - famous and non-famous - still watch TV shows and movies on stream\nwithout permission. But they do tend to catch bans for that behavior, even big\nnames like Pokimane and xQc. And as streaming has gotten bigger, the sites\nhave been taking copyright more seriously.\n\nAll of that background is to introduce a startup with a fairly exciting new\nidea: Why not just buy the licenses for shows so that they can be shown\nlegally? Gaggl has a nifty video showing off how the concept works:\n\nRight now the only license they seem to have is for older reruns of the Price\nis Right, and they\u2019re in a limited release test mode. But the tests seem to\nhave gone well, and there\u2019s no reason Gaggl couldn\u2019t expand and eventually\nbuild a profitable business model. Buy up the rights to older/cheaper shows\nthat you can get at a heavy discount. Sell access to streamers who desperately\nneed content to fill the 50+ hours a week they stream. Seems like it could\nwork!\n\nI\u2019m very interested to see if this sort of thing can grow. And I think game\nshows are the perfect type of content to do this with - they\u2019re inherently\ninteractive, fast-paced and reaction-based in a way that makes them chat-\nfriendly and streamer-friendly.\n\n##\n\nThe value of OC\n\nA couple stories caught my eye recently. The first is from Instagram, who are\nmaking changes to benefit original content:\n\n> Historically because of how we\u2019ve ranked content, creators with large\n> followings and aggregators of reposted content have gotten more reach in\n> recommendations than smaller, original content creators. We think it\u2019s\n> important to correct this to give all creators a more equal chance of\n> breaking through to new audiences.\n>\n> To do this, we\u2019re introducing four changes:\n>\n>   * A new input to ranking that will give smaller creators more\n> distribution.\n>\n>   * Replacing reposts with original content in recommendations.\n>\n>   * Adding labels to reposted content, linking to the original creator.\n>\n>   * Removing content aggregators from recommendations.\n>\n>\n\nYou may also remember a link from last week\u2019s Weekly Scroll mentioning that\nReddit seems to have changed their algorithm to benefit small subreddits and\noriginal content.\n\nThe wisdom of the ancients says that once is happenstance, twice is\ncoincidence, three times is enemy action.3 I\u2019m ready to call it after only two\nexamples: we\u2019ve got a trend going on here. Original content is vital, social\nmedia companies know it, and they\u2019re acting on it to make sure the original\ncontent is on their site - not somewhere else.\n\nThere\u2019s a couple of reasons for this. In the age of AI, as everyone is\nhoovering up as much data and text as they can, original content is king.\nYou\u2019re in a much stronger position in the AI wars (or just as a data broker)\nif your site is filled with original posts rather than copies. But beyond AI,\noriginal content is what drives cultural relevance and ultimately power. The\ngraph below might be the single most interesting and important graph in the\nhistory of the social internet:\n\nThis comes courtesy of the site Know Your Meme, who document notable memes,\nevents, people and trends from across the internet. This graph shows the\n\u2018place of origin\u2019 of every meme or trend that the site documented for more\nthan a decade. And it essentially functions as a history of social media.\n\nEarly on YouTube and 4chan were dominant, but both have declined in relative\nimportance over time. This graph shows the rise of Twitter - not as the\nbiggest site in revenue or number of users, but as the dominant cultural force\nit became. It shows that yes, Tumblr had about a 2-3 year period around 2014\nwhere it really was one of the most influential places on the internet. We see\nReddit as a fairly steady presence. We see that Facebook, despite their size,\nhasn\u2019t been a prime driver of internet culture in more than a decade. And we\nsee how the death of Vine led directly into the explosive popularity of\nTikTok.\n\nWhat the sites are beginning to realize is that while you don\u2019t need cultural\nrelevance to make money (hello Facebook!) it sure helps with your site\u2019s\nstaying power. You\u2019d much rather be the site where all the memes and discourse\noriginate from, rather than the site where the memes are reposted from\nsomewhere else. You can goose your engagement numbers by resorting to the\nlowest-common-denominator of reposted content, but that\u2019s unlikely to work as\na long term strategy.\n\n##\n\nLinks\n\n  * YouTube accounted for 10% of all TV viewing time in March, according to Nielsen. Netflix is around 8% and all cable networks combined are 28%.\n\n  * Substack has big plans for Notes. Notes can now be embedded on external sites, and Substack seems to be growing more and more towards a social network model. I\u2019m not sure whether this will work, but I don\u2019t fault them for trying.\n\n  * In the wake of last week\u2019s commentary on how gambling is metastasizing everywhere - Dave and Buster\u2019s is introducing gambling on their arcade games. We may be taking things too far.\n\n  * TikTok finally struck a deal with Universal Music Group, making the music for a vast array of artists available once more on the platform. Dance away, kids (while you still can).\n\n  * In the \u2018Well, yeah, duh\u201d category - Google warns that tech companies and AI companies will lose out on top talent if the US doesn\u2019t update their immigration policies.\n\n  * Reddit users finally identified the previously unidentified viral song \u2018Everyone Knows That\u2019 after a multi-year search that drove tens of thousands of people to try to identify the catchy tune. Turns out it was from porn.\n\n##\n\nPosts\n\n  * I am deeply unsure why The Economist needed to cover this\n\n  * A LinkedIn sicko\n\n  * A hater til the end\n\n  * A Radical Chicken\n\n  * A good Hold My Beer story\n\n  * Hot dogs save lives\n\n  * Pat Pat\n\n1\n\nI genuinely would not be surprised if some executive at Sony read a \u2018Data is\nthe new oil\u2019 blog post and then forced this move through just to get a couple\nmillion emails.\n\n2\n\nNot involved in the drama this time! Just a coincidence.\n\n3\n\nThis is actually a quote from James Bond, but it\u2019s more fun to imagine it was\nDescartes.\n\n### Subscribe to Infinite Scroll\n\nBy Jeremiah Johnson \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nThe Power of Posting\n\n4 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Weekly Scroll: Gamers Rise Up\n\nwww.infinitescroll.us\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nWorst Tweets 2023 - Dishonorable Mentions\n\nAll of the most horrifying posts on Twitter that didn't make the final bracket\n\nDec 11, 2023 \u2022\n\nJeremiah Johnson\n\n44\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Worst Tweets 2023 - Dishonorable Mentions\n\nwww.infinitescroll.us\n\n20\n\nUgh, Capitalism\n\nThe laziest form of persuasion on the internet\n\nMay 16, 2023 \u2022\n\nJeremiah Johnson\n\n102\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Ugh, Capitalism\n\nwww.infinitescroll.us\n\n24\n\nActivism is not a Social Club\n\nPolitics is for improving people's lives, not gaining status or looking cool\nonline\n\nApr 11 \u2022\n\nJeremiah Johnson\n\n66\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Activism is not a Social Club\n\nwww.infinitescroll.us\n\n7\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Jeremiah Johnson\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
