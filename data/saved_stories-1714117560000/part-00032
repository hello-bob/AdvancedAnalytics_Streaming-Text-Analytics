But they typically require access to the Internet. This is a\nproblem for developers who work in air-gapped environments or places with\nlimited Internet access. We are building Cody, an AI coding assistant that has\na deep understanding of your entire codebase to help you write and understand\ncode faster.\n\nA few months ago we added an experimental feature to Cody for Visual Studio\nCode that allows you to have local inference for code completion. This feature\nuses Ollama to run a local LLM model of your choice. Our developer community\nhas been very excited about this feature and we wanted to officially write\nabout it and show you how to use it.\n\n> Note: This feature is experimental and only available to Cody Free and Pro\n> users at this time.\n\n## Ollama - run LLMs locally\n\nOllama is a tool for running large language models (LLMs) locally. Ollama\nbundles model weights, configurations, and datasets into a unified package\nmanaged by a Modelfile.\n\nOllama supports many different models, including Code Llama, StarCoder,\nDeepSeek Coder, and more. Ollama supports both general and special purpose\nmodels. Check out the full list here.\n\n### Getting started with Ollama\n\nOllama is a CLI tool that you can download and install for MacOS, Linux, and\nWindows. Head over to the download page and download the appropriate package\nfor your operating system. Once you have downloaded and installed Ollama,\nverify that it is working by running the following command:\n\n    \n    \n    ollama --help\n\nThis should output the following:\n\n### Downloading LLMs\n\nNow you are ready to download and install a LLM. To download a model, you can\nuse the following command:\n\n    \n    \n    ollama pull <model-name>\n\nFor example, to download the codellama model, you would run the following\ncommand:\n\n    \n    \n    ollama pull codellama\n\nYou can also download a model from a specific version by specifying the\nparameter size:\n\n    \n    \n    ollama pull codellama:7b\n\nImportant Note: Your ability to run a model is heavily dependent on your\nhardware. The larger the model, the more resources you will need to\nsuccesfully run it.\n\n### Running LLMs locally\n\nOnce you have downloaded a model, you can run it locally by specifying the\nmodel name. For example, to run the codellama model, you would run the\nfollowing command:\n\n    \n    \n    ollama run codellama\n\nBy default, Ollama will run the model directly in your terminal. Once the\nmodel is running, you can interact with it by typing in your prompt and\npressing enter. For example, once the model is running in your terminal, you\ncan type in the following prompt:\n\n    \n    \n    Write a JavaScript function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in the string.\n\nAnd press enter. Ollama will respond with an output like this:\n\n### Ollama REST API\n\nOllama also provides a REST API that you can use to interact with your\ndownloaded models. By default the REST API to generate completions is\navailable at http://localhost:11434/api/generate. The REST API exposes a\nnumber of additional endpoints for chat, managing models, and more. You can\nfind more information about the REST API here.\n\nTo use the REST API, you make a POST request to the /api/generate endpoint\nwith the following JSON payload:\n\n    \n    \n    { \"prompt\": \"Your prompt\", \"model\": \"The model that you want to use\", \"stream\": false }\n\nThe prompt field is the text you want to generate a completion for. The model\nfield is the name of the model you want to use. There are additional\nparameters you can pass in such as stream, context, format, and others, but\nthe only required parameters are the prompt and model fields.\n\nLet's try it out! Let's make a POST request to the /api/generate endpoint with\nthe following JSON payload:\n\n    \n    \n    { \"prompt\": \"Write a Python function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in the string.\", \"model\": \"codellama\", }\n\nYou can use a tool like Postman to make the request. Once you have the request\nset up, you can send it to the /api/generate endpoint and see the response.\n\n## Local code completion with Ollama and Cody\n\nNow that you have Ollama installed and running locally, you can use it with\nCody to get local code completion. By default, Cody uses a remotely hosted\nversion of the StarCoder LLM for code completion.\n\nTo switch the local code completion, you first need to install the Cody VS\nCode extension. Once you have the extension installed, update your VS Code\nsettings to use Ollama with Cody:\n\n    \n    \n    \"cody.autocomplete.advanced.provider\": \"experimental-ollama\", \"cody.autocomplete.experimental.ollamaOptions\": { \"url\": \"http://localhost:11434\", \"model\": \"codellama\" },\n\n(Choose your preferred model; codellama is shown in the example above, but it\ncan be any Ollama model name.)\n\nOnce you have done this, Cody will now use Ollama to get local code completion\nfor your VS Code files. To verify that it is working, open the Output tab and\nswitch it to Cody by Sourcegraph. Next, open a file and start typing. You\nshould see the following message in the Output tab when a completion is\ngenerated:\n\nThe above image shows that we are sending the prompt and context to Ollama.\nThe response from Ollama is then sent back to Cody and displayed in the Output\ntab as well as reflected in the editor.\n\nNow you can also try out other models by changing the model value in the\ncody.autocomplete.experimental.ollamaOptions setting. As soon as the\nsettings.json file is saved, Cody will automatically update to use the new\nmodel. Happy experimenting!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith Ollama and Cody, you can now have local code completion. This is a great\nway to improve your development workflow whether you're trying new LLMs or\ncatching a flight and lacking Internet access. As mentioned in the intro to\nthis post, Ollama for Cody is still experimental and we are working on\nimproving the experience and bringing you more features.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, please let us know by opening an issue\non our GitHub repository and if you haven't already, give Cody a try yourself!\n\n### Get Cody, the AI coding assistant\n\nCody makes it easy to write, fix, and maintain code.\n\nLearn more\n\n## Products\n\n  * Cody\n  * Code Search\n\n## Solutions\n\n  * Enterprise\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Blog\n  * Library\n  * Newsletter\n  * Customer stories\n  * Changelog\n  * Documentation\n  * Community\n  * Support forum\n\n## Company\n\n  * About\n  * Careers - We're hiring!\n  * Contact\n  * Handbook\n  * Sourcegraph strategy\n\n  * \u00a9 2024 Sourcegraph, Inc.\n  * Terms\n  * Security\n  * Privacy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
