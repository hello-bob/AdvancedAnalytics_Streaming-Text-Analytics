China Unicom reportedly went to market for 2,500 boxes last month,\nand China Telecom has also worked to secure some kit.\n\nWhat the telcos plan to do with the servers remains a mystery. China Mobile\noperates a hyperscale cloud \u2013 one obvious role for its AI servers. Or perhaps\nthe telco will use generative AI for customer service \u2013 an application The\nRegister often hears is ideal for the tech.\n\n  * Banned Nvidia GPUs sneak into sanction-busting Chinese servers\n  * Microsoft aims to triple datacenter capacity to fuel AI boom\n  * China orders its telcos to rip and replace US chips with homegrown silicon by 2027\n  * China scientists talk of powering hypersonic weapon with cheap Nvidia chip\n\nWhatever the carrier and its peers plan to do with AI servers, the source of\ntheir GPUs is a subject of considerable interest.\n\nChina is yet to develop a domestic GPU capable of handling modern AI workloads\nin a timely fashion.\n\nWhile US-based GPU-makers are able to export their high-end product to China\nif granted a license to do so, such permission is not likely to be given to\nChina Mobile as it is state-controlled and, like its mega-carrier peers China\nTelecom and China Unicom, has been named on the US Department of Defense\u2019s\n\"entities identified as Chinese Military Companies.\"\n\nUS tech export bans were created specifically to stop China's military\naccessing advanced tech.\n\nThat leaves performance-limited GPUs from US manufacturers as one possible and\nlegitimate option for China's colosso-carriers.\n\nOther options include illegal smuggling, or simply acquiring servers with\nthose lesser GPUs inside \u2013 transactions of a sort that Dell, Supermicro, and\nGigabyte are reportedly happy to conduct. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * China\n  * China Mobile\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * China\n  * China Mobile\n  * GPU\n  * Server\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Apple M1\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Great Firewall\n  * GTC\n  * Home lab\n  * Hong Kong\n  * JD.com\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * APAC\n  * Hardware\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n8 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * China\n  * China Mobile\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * China\n  * China Mobile\n  * GPU\n  * Server\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Apple M1\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Great Firewall\n  * GTC\n  * Home lab\n  * Hong Kong\n  * JD.com\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * APAC\n  * Hardware\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### HPE sues China's Inspur Group over server patents\n\nMiddle Kingdom biz accused of IP theft and changing names to evade sanctions\n\nSystems8 days | 1\n\n#### Intel Gaudi's third and final hurrah is an AI accelerator built to best\nNvidia's H100\n\nIntel Vision Goodbye dedicated AI hardware and hello to a GPU that fuses Xe\ngraphics DNA with Habana chemistry\n\nSystems16 days | 1\n\n#### Intel preps export-friendly lower-power Gaudi 3 AI chips for China\n\nBeijing will be thrilled by this nerfed silicon\n\nAI + ML13 days | 5\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### With Run:ai acquisition, Nvidia aims to manage your AI kubes\n\nNow Jensen has a control plane to play with his army of NIMs\n\nAI + ML19 hrs |\n\n#### What's up with AI lately?
