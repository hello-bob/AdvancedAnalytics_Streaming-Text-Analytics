For Weber's book, see The Protestant Ethic\nand the Spirit of Capitalism.\n\nThe Protestant work ethic,^[1] also known as the Calvinist work ethic^[2] or\nthe Puritan work ethic,^[3] is a work ethic concept in sociology, economics,\nand history. It emphasizes that a person's subscription to the values espoused\nby the Protestant faith, particularly Calvinism, result in diligence,\ndiscipline, and frugality.^[4]\n\nThe phrase was initially coined in 1905 by pioneering sociologist Max Weber in\nhis book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.^[5] Weber asserted\nthat Protestant ethics and values, along with the Calvinist doctrines of\nasceticism and predestination, enabled the rise and spread of capitalism.^[6]\nJust as priests and caring professionals are deemed to have a vocation (or\n\"calling\" from God) for their work, according to the Protestant work ethic the\n\"lowly\" workman also has a noble vocation which he can fulfill through\ndedication to his work.\n\nIt is one of the most influential and cited books in sociology, although the\nthesis presented has been controversial since its release. In opposition to\nWeber, historians such as Fernand Braudel and Hugh Trevor-Roper assert that\nthe Protestant work ethic did not create capitalism and that capitalism\ndeveloped in pre-Reformation Catholic communities. Historian Laurence R.\nIannaccone has written that \"the most noteworthy feature of the Protestant\nEthic thesis is its absence of empirical support.\"^[7]\n\nThe concept is often credited with helping to define the self-view of\nsocieties of Northern, Central and Northwestern Europe as well as the United\nStates of America.^[8]^[9]\n\n## Weber's theory[edit]\n\nFollowing a study trip to America, Weber developed his theory of the\nProtestant Ethic, which included more considerations than attitude to work.\nThose with the ethic believed that good fortune (e.g. from hard work) is a\nvindication of God in this life: a theodicy of fortune; this supported\nreligious and social actions that proved their right to possess even greater\nwealth. In contrast, those without the ethic instead emphasized that God will\nbe vindicated by granting wealth and happiness in the next life: a theodicy of\nmisfortune. These beliefs guided expectations, behaviour and culture,\netc.^[10]^: 348\u2013349\n\n## Basis in Protestant theology[edit]\n\nAccording to the theory, Protestants, beginning with Martin Luther,\nconceptualized worldly work as a duty which benefits both the individual and\nsociety as a whole.^[11] Thus, the Catholic idea of good works^[12] was\ntransformed for Protestants into an obligation to consistently work diligently\nas a sign of grace. Whereas Catholicism teaches that good works are required\nof Catholics as a necessary manifestation of the faith they received, and that\nfaith apart from works is dead and barren, the Calvinist theologians taught\nthat only those who were predestined to be saved would be saved.^[13]\n\nFor Protestants, salvation is a gift from God; this is the Protestant\ndistinction of sola gratia.^[14] In light of salvation being a gift of grace,\nProtestants viewed work as stewardship given to them. Thus Protestants were\nnot working in order to achieve salvation but viewed work as the means by\nwhich they could be a blessing to others. Hard work and frugality were thought\nto be two important applications of being a steward of what God had given\nthem. Protestants were thus attracted to these qualities and strove to reach\nthem.\n\nThere are many specific theological examples in the Bible used to support a\nwork ethic. Old Testament examples abound, such as God's command in Exodus\n20:8\u201310 to \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall\nlabor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your\nGod.\"^[15] Another passage from the Book of Proverbs in the Old Testament\nprovides an example: \"A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of\nthe hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like\nan armed man.\"^[16]\n\nThe New Testament also provides many examples, such as the Parable of the Ten\nMinas in the Book of Luke.^[17]\n\nThe Apostle Paul in 2 Thessalonians said \"If anyone is not willing to work,\nlet him not eat.\"^[18]\n\n## American political history[edit]\n\nCaptain John Smith, admiral of New England (1624)\n\nThe first permanent English settlement in America in the 17th century, at\nJamestown, was led by John Smith.^[19] He trained the first English settlers\nto work at farming and fishing. These settlers were ill-equipped to survive in\nthe English settlements in the early 1600s and were on the precipice of dying.\nJohn Smith emphasized the Protestant work ethic^[citation needed] and helped\npropagate it by stating \"He that will not work, shall not eat\" which is a\ndirect reference to 2 Thessalonians 3:10.^[20] This policy is credited with\nhelping the early colony survive and thrive in its relatively harsh\nenvironment.^[21]\n\nWriter Frank Chodorov argued that the Protestant ethic was long considered\nindispensable for American political figures:\n\n> There was a time, in these United States, when a candidate for public office\n> could qualify with the electorate only by fixing his birthplace in or near\n> the \"log cabin\". He may have acquired a competence, or even a fortune, since\n> then, but it was in the tradition that he must have been born of poor\n> parents and made his way up the ladder by sheer ability, self-reliance, and\n> perseverance in the face of hardship. In short, he had to be \"self made\".\n> The so-called Protestant Ethic then prevalent held that man was a sturdy and\n> responsible individual, responsible to himself, his society, and his God.\n> Anybody who could not measure up to that standard could not qualify for\n> public office or even popular respect. One who was born \"with a silver spoon\n> in his mouth\" might be envied, but he could not aspire to public acclaim; he\n> had to live out his life in the seclusion of his own class.^[22]\n>\n> \u2014 Frank Chodorov, The Radical Rich\n\nOthers have connected the concept of a Protestant work ethic to racist\nideals.^[23]^[24] Civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. said:\n\n> We have deluded ourselves into believing the myth that capitalism grew and\n> prospered out of the Protestant ethic of hard work and sacrifice. The fact\n> is that capitalism was built on the exploitation and suffering of black\n> slaves and continues to thrive on the exploitation of the poor\u2014both black\n> and white, here and abroad.^[25]\n\n## Support[edit]\n\nLate 20th century works by Lawrence Harrison, Samuel P. Huntington, and David\nLandes revitalized interest ^[where?] in Weber's thesis.^[citation needed]\n\nIn a New York Times article, published on June 8, 2003, Niall Ferguson\nclaimed, using data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (OECD), that \"the experience of Western Europe in the past\nquarter-century offers an unexpected confirmation of the Protestant ethic\",\nthat the reason that people in modern Protestant Western European nations\nactually work fewer hours on average than in the Catholic ones or in the\nUnited States is due to a decline in active Protestantism.^[26]\n\n### Individuals[edit]\n\nThere are studies of the existence and impact of the so-called Protestant\nEthic on individuals.^[27] A study at the University of Groningen shows that\nunemployed Protestants fare much worse than the general population\npsychologically.^[28]\n\n### United States[edit]\n\nThe original New England Colonies in 1677 were mostly Protestant in origin and\nexhibited industriousness and respect for laws.^[29]\n\nSome of the original New England Colonies in 1677\n\nPastor John Starke writes that the Protestant work ethic \"multiplied myths\nabout Protestantism, Calvinism, vocation, and capitalism. To this day, many\nbelieve Protestants work hard so as to build evidence for salvation.\"^[30]\n\nSome support exists that the Protestant work ethic may be so ingrained in\nAmerican culture that when it appears people may not recognize it.^[31] Due to\nthe history of Protestantism in the United States, it may be difficult to\nseparate the successes of the country from the ethic that may have\nsignificantly contributed to propelling it.^[citation needed]\n\n### Contrast with prosperity theology ethic[edit]\n\nTshilidzi Marwala asserted in 2020 that the principles of Protestant ethic are\nimportant for development in Africa and that they should be secularized and\nused as an alternative to the ethic of Prosperity Christianity, which\nadvocates miracles as a basis of development.^[32]\n\nIn a recent journal article, Benjamin Kirby agrees that this influence of\nprosperity theology, particularly within neo-Pentecostal movements,\ncomplicates any attempt to draw parallels between, first, the relationship\nbetween contemporary Pentecostalism and neoliberal capitalism, and second, the\nrelationship between Calvinistic asceticism and modern capitalism that\ninterested Weber. Nevertheless, Kirby emphasises the enduring relevance of\nWeber's analysis: he proposes a \"new elective affinity\" between contemporary\nPentecostalism and neoliberal capitalism, suggesting that neo-Pentecostal\nchurches may act as vehicles for embedding neoliberal economic processes, for\ninstance by encouraging practitioners to become entrepreneurial,\nresponsibilised citizens.^[33]\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\nSee also: The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism \u00a7 Criticism\n\n### Historicity[edit]\n\nAustrian political economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism began in\nItaly in the 14th century, not in the Protestant areas of Europe.^[34]\n\nDanish macroeconomist Thomas Barnebeck Andersen et al. found that the location\nof monasteries of the Catholic Order of Cistercians, and specifically their\ndensity, highly correlated to this work ethic in later centuries;^[35] ninety\npercent of these monasteries were founded before the year 1300 AD. Economist\nJoseph Henrich found that this correlation extends right up to the twenty-\nfirst century.^[36]\n\nOther factors that further developed the European market economy included the\nstrengthening of property rights and lowering of transaction costs with the\ndecline and monetization of feudalism, and the increase in real wages\nfollowing the epidemics of bubonic plague.^[37]\n\nSocial scientist Rodney Stark commented that \"during their critical period of\neconomic development, these northern centers of capitalism were Catholic, not\nProtestant\", with the Reformation still far off in the future. Furthermore, he\nalso highlighted the conclusions of other historians, noting that, compared to\nCatholics, Protestants were \"not more likely to hold the high-status\ncapitalist positions\", that Catholic Europe did not lag in its industrial\ndevelopment compared to Protestant areas, and that even Weber wrote that\n\"fully developed capitalism had appeared in Europe\" long before the\nReformation.^[38] As British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper stated, the concept\nthat \"large-scale industrial capitalism was ideologically impossible before\nthe Reformation is exploded by the simple fact that it existed\".^[39]\n\nFrench historian Fernand Braudel wrote that \"all historians\" opposed the\n\"tenuous theory\" of Protestant ethic, despite not being able to entirely quash\nthe theory \"once and for all\". Braudel continues to remark that the \"northern\ncountries took over the place that earlier had been so long and brilliantly\nbeen occupied by the old capitalist centers of the Mediterranean. They\ninvented nothing, either in technology or business management\".^[40]\n\nHistorian Laurence R. Iannaccone has written that \"Ironically, the most\nnoteworthy feature of the Protestant Ethic thesis is its absence of empirical\nsupport\", citing the work of Swedish economic historian Kurt Samuelsson^[41]\nthat \"economic progress was uncorrelated with religion, or was temporally\nincompatible with Weber's thesis, or actually reversed the pattern claimed by\nWeber.\"^[7]\n\nGerman economists Sascha Becker and Ludger W\u00f6\u00dfmann have posited an alternate\ntheory, claiming that the literacy gap between Protestants (as a result of the\nReformation) and Catholics was sufficient explanation for the economic gaps,\nand that the \"results hold when we exploit the initial concentric dispersion\nof the Reformation to use distance to Wittenberg as an instrument for\nProtestantism\".^[42] However, they also note that, between Luther (1500) and\nPrussia during the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u201371), the limited data available\nhas meant that the period in question is regarded as a \"black box\" and that\nonly \"some cursory discussion and analysis\" is possible.^[43]\n\n### Modern effect[edit]\n\nA 2021 study argues that the values represented by the Protestant ethic as\ndeveloped by Max Weber are not exclusively related to Protestantism but to the\nmodernization phase of economic development. Weber observed this phase of\ndevelopment in areas dominated by Protestants at the time of his observations.\nFrom these observations, he concludes that a worldly asceticism consisting of\na preference for work and a sober life are associated with Protestantism.\nHowever Dutch management economists Annemiek Schilpzand and Eelke de Jong\nargue that this value pattern is associated with the modernization phase of a\nregion's economic development and thus, in principle, can be found for any\nreligion or for non-religious persons.^[44]\n\nA 2013 study of 44 European countries found that religious heritage of\ncountries explains half of the between-country variation in Europe in Work\nEthic, more than modernity, while factors such as income, education, religion\nand (in another study) secularization explain relatively little. However, the\nstudy showed that Protestant heritage was actually the least correlated with a\nstrong work ethic, with Moslem, then Orthodox, then Catholic heritages being\nthe strongest.^[45]\n\nA 2009 study of 32 mainly developed countries found no difference in work\nethic between Catholics and Protestants, after correcting for demographic and\ncountry effects; however, it found substantial support for a social ethic\neffect due to e.g. the Catholic attention to production within the family and\nto personal contacts: \"Protestant values are shown to shape a type of\nindividual who exerts greater effort in mutual social control, supports\ninstitutions more and more critically, is less bound to close circles of\nfamily and friends, and also holds more homogenous values.... (which\nultimately works) in favour of anonymous markets, as they facilitate legal\nenforcement and impersonal exchange.\"^[46]^: 890, 908\u2013910 A similar result is\nin the 2003 analysis of Western Europe by Riis.^[47]\n\n> A re-examination of Weber\u2019s Protestant Ethic indicates that what was\n> important for long-term economic growth was not a greater propensity to save\n> and work of individual Protestants but rather the manner in which a group of\n> Protestants interacted compared with a group of Catholics.^[48]\n>\n> \u2014 Ulrich Blum, Leonard Dudley, Religion and Economic Growth: Was Weber\n> Right? \u2013 Journal of Evolutionary Economics, Vol 11, issue 2, pp. 217\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Reformed Christianity portal\n\n  * Achievement ideology\n  * Anglo-Saxon economy\n  * Critical responses to Weber\n  * Critique of work\n  * God helps those who help themselves \u2013 Religious saying\n  * Imperial German influence on Republican Chile\n  * Industrial Revolution\n  * Laziness\n  * Merton thesis\n  * Pray and work\n  * Predestination in Calvinism\n  * Prosperity theology \u2013 Material wealth\u2013based Christian belief\n  * Prussian virtues\n  * Refusal of work\n  * Sloth (deadly sin)\n  * Underclass\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Gini, Al (2018). \"Protestant Work Ethic\".
