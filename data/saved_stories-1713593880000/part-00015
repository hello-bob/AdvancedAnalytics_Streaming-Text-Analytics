One such technology is\nthe Datapoint 2200, a programmable terminal that laid the foundation for the\npersonal computer revolution. Launched in 1970 by Computer Terminal Corp.\n(CTC) in San Antonio, the machine played a significant role in the early days\nof microcomputers. The pioneering system integrated a CPU, memory, and\ninput/output devices into a single unit, making it a compact, self-contained\ndevice.\n\nApple, IBM, and other companies are often associated with the popularization\nof PCs; we must not overlook the groundbreaking innovations introduced by the\nDatapoint. The machine might have faded from memory, but its influence on the\nevolution of computing technology cannot be denied. The IEEE Region 5 life\nmembers committee honored the machine in 2022 with its Stepping Stone Award,\nbut I would like to make more members aware of the innovations introduced by\nthe machine\u2019s design.\n\n## From mainframes to microcomputers\n\nBefore the personal computer, there were mainframe computers. The colossal\nmachines, with their bulky, green monitors housed in meticulously cooled\nrooms, epitomized the forefront of technology at the time. I was fortunate to\nwork with mainframes during my second year as an electrical engineering\nstudent in the United Arab Emirates University at Al Ain, Abu Dhabi, in 1986.\nThe machines occupied entire rooms, dwarfing the personal computers we are\nfamiliar with today. Accessing the mainframes involved working with text-based\nterminals that lacked graphical interfaces and had limited capabilities.\n\nThose relatively diminutive terminals that interfaced with the machines often\nprovided a touch of amusement for the students. The mainframe rooms served as\nsocial places, fostering interactions, collaborations, and friendly\ncompetitions.\n\nOperating the terminals required mastering specific commands and coding\nlanguages. The process of submitting computing jobs and waiting for results\nwithout immediate feedback could be simultaneously amusing and frustrating.\nStudents often humorously referred to the \u201cblack hole,\u201d where their jobs\nseemed to vanish until the results materialized. Decoding enigmatic error\nmessages became a challenge, yet students found joy in deciphering them and\nsharing amusing examples.\n\nDespite mainframes\u2019 power, they had restricted processing capabilities and\nmemory compared with today\u2019s computers.\n\nThe introduction of personal computers during my senior year was a game-\nchanger. Little did I know that it would eventually lead me to San Antonio,\nTexas, birthplace of the PC, where I would begin a new chapter of my life.\n\n## The first PC\n\nIn San Antonio, a group of visionary engineers from NASA foundedCTC with the\ngoal of revolutionizing desktop computing. They introduced the Datapoint 3300\nas a replacement for Teletype terminals. Led by Phil Ray and Gus Roche, the\ncompany later built the first personal desktop computer, the Datapoint 2200.\nThey also developed LAN technology and aimed to replace traditional office\nequipment with electronic devices operable from a single terminal.\n\nThe Datapoint 2200 introduced several design elements that later were adopted\nby other computer manufacturers. It was one of the first computers to use a\nkeyboard similar to a typewriter\u2019s, and a monitor for user interaction\u2014which\nbecame standard input and output devices for personal computers. They set a\nprecedent for user-friendly computer interfaces. The machine also had cassette\ntape drives for storage, predecessors of disk drives. The computer had options\nfor networking, modems, interfaces, printers, and a card reader.\n\nIt used different memory sizes and employed an 8-bit processor architecture.\nThe Datapoint\u2019s CPU was initially intended to be a custom chip, which\neventually came to be known as the microprocessor. At the time, no such chips\nexisted, so CTC contracted with Intel to produce one. That chip was the Intel\n8008, which evolved into the Intel 8080. Introduced in 1974, the 8080 formed\nthe basis for small computers, according to an entry about early\nmicroprocessors in the Engineering and Technology History Wiki.\n\nThose first 8-bit microprocessors are celebrating their 50th anniversary this\nyear.\n\nThe 2200 was primarily marketed for business use, and its introduction helped\naccelerate the adoption of computer systems in a number of industries,\naccording to Lamont Wood, author of Datapoint: The Lost Story of the Texans\nWho Invented the Personal Computer Revolution.\n\nThe machine popularized the concept of computer terminals, which allowed\nmultiple users to access a central computer system remotely, Wood wrote. It\nalso introduced the idea of a terminal as a means of interaction with a\ncentral computer, enabling users to input commands and receive output.\n\nThe concept laid the groundwork for the development of networking and\ndistributed computing. It eventually led to the creation of LANs and wide-area\nnetworks, enabling the sharing of resources and information across\norganizations. The concept of computer terminals influenced the development of\nmodern networking technologies including the Internet, Wood pointed out.\n\n## How Datapoint inspired Apple and IBM\n\nAlthough the Datapoint 2200 was not a consumer-oriented computer, its design\nprinciples and influence played a role in the development of personal\ncomputers. Its compact, self-contained nature demonstrated the feasibility and\npotential of such machines.\n\nThe Datapoint sparked the imagination of researchers and entrepreneurs,\nleading to the widespread availability of personal computers.\n\nHere are a few examples of how manufacturers built upon the foundation laid by\nthe Datapoint 2200:\n\nApple drew inspiration from early microcomputers. The Apple II, introduced in\n1977, was one of the first successful personal computers. It incorporated a\nkeyboard, a monitor, and a cassette tape interface for storage, similar to the\nDatapoint 2200. In 1984 Apple introduced the Macintosh, which featured a\ngraphical user interface and a mouse, revolutionizing the way users interacted\nwith computers.\n\nIBM entered the personal computer market in 1981. Its PC also was influenced\nby the design principles of microcomputers. The machine featured an open\narchitecture, allowing for easy expansion and customization. The PC\u2019s success\nestablished it as a standard in the industry.\n\nMicrosoft played a crucial role in software development for early\nmicrocomputers. Its MS-DOS provided a standardized platform for software\ndevelopment and was compatible with the IBM PC and other microcomputers. The\noperating system helped establish Microsoft as a dominant player in the\nsoftware industry.\n\nCommodore International, a prominent computer manufacturer in the 1980s,\nreleased the Commodore 64 in 1982. It was a successful microcomputer that\nbuilt upon the concepts of the Datapoint 2200 and other early machines. The\nCommodore 64 featured an integrated keyboard, color graphics, and sound\ncapabilities, making it a popular choice for gaming and home computing.\n\nXerox made significant contributions to the advancement of computing\ninterfaces. Its Alto, developed in 1973, introduced the concept of a graphical\nuser interface, with windows, icons, and a mouse for interaction. Although the\nAlto was not a commercial success, its influence was substantial, and it\nhelped lay the groundwork for GUI-based systems including the Macintosh and\nMicrosoft Windows.\n\nThe Datapoint 2200 deserves to be remembered for its contributions to computer\nhistory.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * How the IBM PC Won, Then Lost, the Personal Computer Market \u203a\n  * Chip Hall of Fame: Intel 8088 Microprocessor \u203a\n  * The Surprising Story of the First Microprocessors \u203a\n\ncomputersconsumer electronicsieee historymicroprocessortype:tirobotics\n\nQusi Alqarqaz\n\nQusi Alqarqaz is an electrical engineer, engineering manager, and consultant\nwith more than 33 years of experience in the electric power industry and in\nthe analysis and performance improvement initiatives involving electric\nutilities.
