As a reminder, Google will enforce that\nnew policy on May 5th both algorithmically and through manual actions.\n\nLaura Chiocciora notified me of this change on X saying, \"It seems like Forbes\nput a noindex x-robots-tag on its Coupon folder a few days ago.\" I checked the\nHTTP header for the coupon directory and indeed there is an x-robots-tag:\nnoindex directive now placed on that directory.\n\nLaura showed this chart showing a drop in visibility after Google began\ndeindexing those coupon pages from Forbes:\n\nIt seems it was first spotted over here:\n\n> This is more wild than I originally thought. @Forbes deindexed several\n> thousand pages! https://t.co/bp7wPkfdyU\n>\n> \u2014 BowTiedWookie (@BowTiedWookie) April 16, 2024\n\nLily Ray wrote about this after saying Forbes seems to be seeing a double-\nwhammy hit not just from the removal of the coupons directory. Here is that\ntweet:\n\n> Just dug into the data.\n>\n> The coupon noindexing / traffic drop is separate from this.\n>\n> This Forbes Vetted situation appears to be an algorithmic hit and nothing to\n> do with noindexing.\n>\n> Although both things happening at once... yeah, that\u2019s a traffic drop double\n> whammy. https://t.co/qhA1dSJmdD\n>\n> \u2014 Lily Ray \ud83d\ude0f (@lilyraynyc) April 20, 2024\n\nAs a reminder, site reputation abuse \"is when third-party pages are published\nwith little or no first-party oversight or involvement, where the purpose is\nto manipulate Search rankings by taking advantage of the first-party site's\nranking signals,\" Chris Nelson from the Google Search Quality team wrote. This\nincludes sponsored, advertising, partner, or other third-party pages that are\ntypically independent of a host site's main purpose or produced without close\noversight or involvement of the host site, and provide little to no value to\nusers, he explained.\n\nThis coupon directory is likely one of the more well-known examples of this in\naction. By Forbes noindexing it, they should not run into wider issues with\nthis policy.
