Now it\u2019s\nheading to production, but with a somewhat more plain name.\n\nAt the time we had almost no details, but now we\u2019re learning all about the\nupcoming electric off-roader here in the wilds of... Beverly Hills, California\n(a simultaneous reveal happened in China at the Beijing Auto Show).\n\nSo, maybe no heavy off-roading demonstrations are in the cards for today.\n\nBut the electric G-Class does have off-roading chops. It comes with 4\nindependent electric motors putting out a combined 579hp and 879 lb-ft of\ntorque. Each motor has its own 2-speed transmission, giving access to a low-\ngear with 2:1 gear reduction for off-roading, and the 4 independent motors\nmean the car can vector torque to whichever wheels need it \u2013 even better than\na locking differential.\n\n4 wheel motors also means the G580 will be capable of what Mercedes calls\nG-Turn, its branding of what we\u2019ve previously seen referred to as \u201ctank turn\u201d\nwhen Rivian was working on it (but later abandoned and pivoted to \u201cfront dig\nmode\u201d instead). This means it will be able to do 2 full rotations on the spot\nby spinning the wheels on the left and right sides of the car in opposite\ndirections at once.\n\nHowever, this feature is more of a toy, just for fun. Mercedes also has a\nG-steering feature, which is sort of a mini-version of the G-turn, which will\nhelp you make extremely tight turns by activating torque vectoring and giving\nyou just a little bit of spin (though unlike the EQS, it doesn\u2019t have rear-\nwheel steering). Neither of these features will be great for tire wear.\n\nThe G580 can climb up to a 100% (45o) grade and hold stable on lateral slopes\nof up to 35o, ford 33.5 inches of water (6 inches deeper than the gas\nversion), with 9.8 inches of ground clearance, a 32o approach angle, 30.7o\ndeparture angle and 20.3o breakover angle, with independent double wishbone\nsuspension in the front and a solid de Dion axle in the rear.\n\nTo help you see where you\u2019re going, the G580 has a \u201ctransparent hood\u201d feature,\nwhich uses a camera to show what\u2019s in front of and under the car on the\ninternal display. This is important for off-roading, because if you\u2019re going\nover a ridge or something and can\u2019t see under the hood, the transparent hood\ncan help you see where you\u2019re going.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a Mercedes, which means it\u2019s fancy inside. And the 2025 model\nwill be particularly fancy, as it\u2019s only available in EDITION ONE trim with\nlots of exclusive interior and exterior touches. EDITION ONE will have a\nlimited number of color options, but you can customize later editions of the\ncar basically any way you want through Mercedes\u2019 MANUFAKTUR car customization\nprocess.\n\nSo whether you\u2019re conquering a real jungle or just the concrete jungle of...\nRodeo Drive, or Las Vegas for the latest cryptocurrency convention, you\u2019ll\nfeel right at home in the Mercedes G-Class.\n\nThat fanciness is certainly needed to justify its price, which Mercedes hasn\u2019t\nyet released, but said that it will be \u201cin the ballpark\u201d of the G63 (which\nstarts at around $180,000).\n\nIn terms of exterior design, the G580 is basically the same as the gas\nG-Class, with the same boxy design. Unlike many EVs, it doesn\u2019t adopt a\nparticularly curvy exterior, and still has a textured grille area.\n\nThe decision to stick with a traditional-looking grille goes hand in hand with\nMercedes\u2019 recent decision to add a \u201cmore classic grille option\u201d to its EQS.\nAnd it turns out, if you want the G580 with the traditional G-Class grille,\nyou can just get the standard grille, directly from the gas version, if you\nprefer it (but then you don\u2019t get those cool lights).\n\nAnd overall, Mercedes said it was very important to maintain the overall\ndesign of the G-Class. So it hasn\u2019t tweaked it to make it look electric, other\nthan some grille modifications and a couple aero bits.\n\nMercedes says the vehicle has \u201coptimized aerodynamics,\u201d which was surely a\nprimary design intent of this vehicle that consists solely of straight lines.\nBut actually, there have been a couple small changes, like a slightly modified\nA-pillar and a strip above the windshield to smooth out the front edge of the\nroof. This balances out to a drag coefficient of... 0.44 (better than other\nG-Classes, but worse than, say, a Tesla Semi).\n\nAs for details on its electric drive capabilities, the aforementioned 4 motors\ncan sprint to 60mph in an estimated 4.6 seconds, and reach a top speed of\n112mph/180kmh. These aren\u2019t the fastest numbers out there, but the car isn\u2019t\nmeant to be a racecar \u2013 Mercedes could have gone with a bigger battery, or\nmore power, but that would have meant other compromises elsewhere, and\nMercedes said that it was far more important to focus on the total package.\n\nMercedes hasn\u2019t told us a range number yet, but with a 116kWh battery and a\nface that\u2019s even flatter than its electric-triangle-on-wheels competition, we\ncan imagine its somewhere in the mid-200s. It\u2019s 473km on WLTP, which is 293mi,\nbut WLTP is a little more lenient than EPA numbers.\n\nMore importantly than overall range, Mercedes says the G-Class will DC charge\nfrom 10-80% in 32 minutes, with a 200kW peak charging rate (and an 11kW AC\ncharge rate). That maths out to an average charge rate of approximately 150kW\non DC over the full session, which is reasonable, but not great. Also: the\nmodels we saw had CCS, not NACS.\n\nGiven the car\u2019s big 116kWh (usable) battery, it still doesn\u2019t charge nearly as\nfast as a Hyundai/Kia E-GMP car, but it\u2019s still reasonably good compared to\nother chunky EVs. The G580 weighs ~6,800lbs/3,805kg, with a GVWR of exactly\n3,500kg \u2013 the maximum allowed by German law. Part of that weight is a 127lb,\ninch-thick carbon skidplate under the car to protect the battery during\nextreme off-roading tasks (a steel plate would weigh ~3x as much).\n\nThe G580 comes with 5 regenerative braking settings, including Mercedes\n\u201cD-auto\u201d setting, where the car intelligently decides to apply regenerative\nbraking based on traffic conditions (we recently tried this setting on the\neSprinter, but struggled to find a situation where it would be useful). Regen\nactivates off-throttle, suggesting the possibility of one-pedal driving, but\nwe haven\u2019t had a chance to try it out and see if its max 217kW regen braking\ncapacity is really strong enough to avoid most brake pedal usage.\n\nIt also has a feature Mercedes calls \u201cG-Roar,\u201d a noise generator that allows\nyou to simulate various electric drivetrain noises. Thankfully, this can be\nturned off.\n\nFor a final cool electric touch, the car has done something new with its\niconic rear end. In place of the spare tire carrier that typically adorns the\nbackside of the G-Class, there\u2019s an optional compartment which can be used to\nstore charging cables or the like. You can still opt for the spare tire, too,\nbut I really like the charging box.\n\nMercedes was mum about what sort of electric/gas sales mix is expects out of\nthe next generation, but it says that it has retained significant flexibility\nin its production plans so that it can adjust based on what customers and\ndealers ask for. It doesn\u2019t plan to tell its dealers to push one or the other\n(which probably means the dealers will push the gas model, sigh), and its\nmanufacturing partner (Magna Steyr) is ready to adapt to wherever the market\ngoes.\n\n## Electrek\u2019s Take\n\nLook, this is a G-Class. It\u2019s a statement car, it\u2019s an image car. If you like\nit, you know that you like it (personally, I don\u2019t, but I also don\u2019t post on\nInstagram, so I guess I\u2019m not the target audience). For the majority of\ndrivers, its off-road capabilities really won\u2019t matter all that much \u2013 but\nit\u2019s still cool that it has them.\n\nWhat matters here is whether it stays true to the G-Class, and as far as we\ncan tell, it does. It looks like a G-Class and it feels like a G-Class. The\ndoors thunk closed like a G-Class.\n\nAnd an important note \u2013 Mercedes said, \u201cif the G can go electric, any car can\ngo electric.\u201d We, of course, agree. This is a car that has been defined in\nmany ways by excess, with the gas version getting just 14 miles per gallon.\nAnd yet here it is, in electric trim, with a huge battery (but not out of line\nwith other huge EVs), beating the gas version\u2019s performance both on- and off-\nroad.\n\nAs for the name \u2013 while \u201cG580 with EQ technology\u201d is a bit of a mouthful, I\nactually like the simple designation \u201cG580.\u201d Surely people will refer to it as\n\u201cthe electric G-Class\u201d or the like, but by giving the car a regular model\nname, Mercedes is saying that it\u2019s treating the car like a regular car.\n\nInstead of siloing EVs into their own sub-brand, Mercedes is saying that this\nis a G-Class, and if you want a G-Class, this is that. Mercedes was clear that\nthis is not a rational vehicle, that its customers don\u2019t need a G-Class, they\nwant a G-Class.\n\nSo there you go. If you want a G-Class, this is a G-Class.\n\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
