Those\ninside fear being sent far from family.\n\nBy\n\n    Victoria Law ,\n    Truthout\n\nPublished\n\n    April 16, 2024\n\nFederal Correctional Institution, Dublin (FCI Dublin) is photographed in\nDublin, California, on September 13, 2014.Anda Chu / MediaNews Group/The\nMercury News via Getty Images\n\n#### Part of the Series\n\n##### The Road to Abolition\n\nThe sudden April 15 announcement that FCI Dublin, the federal women\u2019s prison\nin California dubbed \u201cthe rape club,\u201d is slated to be closed came as a shock\nto those inside \u2014 as well as to their attorneys, a federal judge and the\nmonitor she recently appointed for independent oversight. For the women who\nhave been raising an alarm for decades about the widespread and systemic\nsexual abuse committed by its prison guards, it should have been a victory.\nBut they warn that if the closure simply results in shuffling them to other\nprisons across the country rather than access to compassionate release and\nearly release, the decision simply compounds the harms they have already\nexperienced.\n\nRhonda Fleming, a 58-year-old woman currently incarcerated at FCI Dublin, told\nTruthout that prison officials have already transferred people whose families\nare in California to states in the South and Midwest. An increasing number of\nother women were being processed for the lower-security prison camp. Seeing\nthe dwindling numbers of people inside the prison, Fleming suspected that\nofficials were planning to close the prison.\n\n\u201cPrison transfers are not the solution,\u201d Fleming wrote in a brief to Judge\nGonzalez Rogers on April 10, five days before the Bureau of Prisons publicly\nannounced that FCI Dublin would be closing. \u201cIn many respects, these transfers\nare punishment.\u201d\n\nSusan Beaty, an attorney with the California Collaborative for Immigrant\nJustice who is representing survivors of staff sexual abuse at Dublin,\nconcurred.\n\n\u201cSexual abuse, medical neglect and retaliation exists across the system,\u201d\nBeaty told Truthout. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problems to move people who have\nalready been through so much to other places \u2014 farther away from their\nfamilies and their attorneys \u2014 where they\u2019re going to be subjected to very\nsimilar kinds of harm.\u201d\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nPrisons & Policing\n\n## Women Speaking Up About Sexual Abuse Behind Bars Face Retaliation in\nCalifornia\n\nDespite highly publicized arrests and promises of change, sexual abuse and\nretaliation continue at the prison in Dublin.\n\nBy\n\n    Victoria Law ,\n    Truthout\n\nFebruary 22, 2024\n\nTruthout\n\nBeaty is hoping that the planned prison closure becomes an opportunity for the\nBOP to release many people from prison altogether. \u201cThere are so many people\neligible for early release, release to home confinement or transitional\nhousing, and compassionate release,\u201d they said.\n\n## A Sudden Announcement\n\n\u201cKelly,\u201d who is currently incarcerated at Dublin, told Truthout that on Monday\nmorning, staff ushered the incarcerated people into a town hall. (Kelly asked\nthat her real name not be published to avoid retaliation.)\n\nThere, she said, the interim warden made a brief announcement. The prison\nwould be closing and everyone would be removed by April 19. They ordered\npeople to return to their cells, pack their belongings, and stay quiet. Staff\nwould knock on the doors of those who would leave that day.\n\n> \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problems to move people who have already been through\n> so much to other places where they\u2019re going to be subjected to very similar\n> kinds of harm.\u201d\n\nKelly spent the rest of the morning looking around her cell and deciding what\nshe would be able to fit into the two boxes each person was allowed. \u201cI have\nroom for pictures of my kids, but not for hygiene,\u201d she told Truthout. That\nmeant that, at her destination, she would have to spend her hard-earned\ndollars to buy hygiene products and other items she had been forced to discard\nbecause of the move.\n\nIt was a dilemma shared by the 605 people incarcerated at FCI Dublin and its\nsatellite camp. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) confirmed that both would be\nclosed.\n\nDublin has long been plagued by widespread staff sexual abuse. Eight employees\nhave been criminally charged with sexually abusing people in custody; seven\nhave been found guilty and sentenced to prison. Sixty-three lawsuits have been\nfiled by incarcerated people about the systemic sexual abuse. In mid-March,\nshortly after the FBI raided the prison, federal judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers\nordered a special master, or independent monitor, to oversee changes to the\nprison \u2014 the first ever in the history of the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nThe interim warden provided no further information about the closure. KTVU\nreported that buses were seen in the prison parking lot that morning,\npresumably to begin transferring the incarcerated people elsewhere.\n\n## \u201cPrison Transfers Are Not the Solution\u201d\n\nThe news came as a surprise to the attorneys and legal organizations\nrepresenting survivors of sexual assault at Dublin as well as to Judge Rogers\nand the newly appointed special master.\n\n\u201cWe remain concerned that the BOP is trying to evade accountability and\ntransparency of a facility plagued by abuse, retaliation and dangerous\nconditions a week after a special master was appointed to bring outside\noversight,\u201d Beaty, one of the attorneys who is representing survivors of staff\nsexual abuse at the prison, told Truthout.\n\nIn a statement emailed to Truthout, BOP director Colette Peters wrote that\n\u201cFCI Dublin is not meeting expected standards and ... the best course of\naction is to close the facility. This decision is being made after ongoing\nevaluation of the effectiveness of those unprecedented steps and additional\nresources.\u201d\n\nPeters\u2019s statement said those currently incarcerated at Dublin will be\ntransferred to other prisons. \u201cAs we determine placement, each woman will be\nassessed, and their programming needs will be taken into account. Per policy\nand practice, we will endeavor to keep them as close to their release\nlocations as possible and ensure that they have access to counsel at their\nreceiving institution,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBut Rhonda Fleming told Truthout that as early as last Thursday, prison\nofficials had transferred several people, many of whom had families in\nsouthern California, to federal prisons in Oklahoma and Illinois. \u201cThey\nbelieved they were going to Victorville camp [88 miles from Los Angeles].\nInstead, they are on their way to Pekin or Greenville, Illinois,\u201d she told\nTruthout. \u201cThe evil is beyond comprehension. A false rumor was put out to make\nthem believe they were going closer to their families in L.A. or San Diego. I\nknow several that would have gone to the SHU [Special Housing Unit] before\nthey would have willingly been shipped like slaves to Illinois.\u201d\n\n> The BOP has stated that no employees will lose their jobs as a result of the\n> closure, leading to the probability that they, too, may be transferred to\n> other prisons.\n\nKelly\u2019s family must drive nearly 20 hours to visit her at Dublin. But, she\nreminded Truthout, FCI Dublin is the only low-security federal women\u2019s prison\nin the area and many of those incarcerated have families in California or\nparts of Mexico. Transferring to another low security women\u2019s prison would\nmean sending them to Minnesota or Alabama or Florida. And, she added, she and\nothers would encounter the same medical neglect and staff misconduct in other\nprisons. The sudden closure and move, she said, \u201cis just re-traumatizing us.\u201d\n\nDanielle Metz agrees. Shortly after she entered Dublin in 1993, her family\nmoved from New Orleans to California so that she could maintain a bond with\nher young children. She remained at Dublin for 23 years before being granted\nclemency by Obama and released in 2016. Now the clemency director for the\nNational Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls,\nshe told Truthout that she would have been devastated if she had been\ntransferred away from her family.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed instead of transfers, she said, is decarceration. \u201cWe don\u2019t need\na face lift,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need relief. They need to let people start going\nhome. We could start by granting clemency and compassionate relief to the\npeople inside.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, Judge Gonzalez Rogers essentially paused the BOP\u2019s plans to\nempty the prison by April 19. She ordered the BOP instead to update casework\nfor each incarcerated person, including their classification and release date.\nShe also ordered that each case be reviewed with the newly appointed special\nmaster prior to transfer.\n\nAccording to another woman inside, as a result of the judge\u2019s order, 40 women\nwere taken off a transfer bus. (She herself was not on the bus.)\n\nThe BOP declined to comment on the judge\u2019s order or how it might change the\ntimeline for closing Dublin. The initial statement from Director Colette\nPeters ended cryptically: \u201cThe closure of the institution may be temporary but\ncertainly will result in a mission change.\u201d\n\nWhile she sees the closure of FCI Dublin as a victory, Fleming knows that\nsimply transferring people to other prisons will not address the pervasive\nstaff abuse, lack of medical care or host of other problems. The BOP has\nstated that no employees will lose their jobs as a result of the closure,\nleading to the probability that they, too, may be transferred to other\nprisons.\n\n\u201cNo matter where the FBOP transfers women, we are subjected to the same\nindividuals and their family members, sexually abusing us and/or retaliating\nagainst us,\u201d she wrote in a brief to Judge Gonzalez Rogers in early April,\nnoting that many prisons employ multiple members of the same family. \u201cIf I am\nnot sent to home confinement, I will be at another prison with the friends\nand/or family members of present and former FBOP employees.\u201d She continues to\npress for release to home confinement \u2014 both for herself and others.\n\nHowever, Peters\u2019s statement limited transfers only to other BOP prisons. Judge\nRogers\u2019s order, on the other hand, expanded options to include not only\ntransfer to other prisons, but also home confinement, halfway houses or\ncompassionate release.\n\nMeanwhile, an air of uncertainty and fear hangs over hundreds.\n\n\u201cToday was one of the most stressful days \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t even on the bus,\u201d\nKelly reflected.\n\n\u201cEvelyn\u201d agrees. She has been at Dublin for over five years, where she has\ncontinually requested medical care for seizures. Now, she told Truthout,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here is harming us psychologically and emotionally.\u201d (She\nasked to be identified by a pseudonym to prevent retaliation.) \u201cWe don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s going to happen tomorrow. Are we going to the SHU or be transferred?\u201d\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
