magnetic material to hold small magnetized areas, known as bubbles or\ndomains, each storing one bit of data. The material is arranged to form a\nseries of parallel tracks that the bubbles can move along under the action of\nan external magnetic field. The bubbles are read by moving them to the edge of\nthe material, where they can be read by a conventional magnetic pickup, and\nthen rewritten on the far edge to keep the memory cycling through the\nmaterial. In operation, bubble memories are similar to delay-line memory\nsystems.\n\nBubble memory started out as a promising technology in the 1970s, offering\nmemory density of an order similar to hard drives, but performance more\ncomparable to core memory, while lacking any moving parts. This led many to\nconsider it a contender for a \"universal memory\" that could be used for all\nstorage needs. The introduction of dramatically faster semiconductor memory\nchips pushed bubble into the slow end of the scale, and equally dramatic\nimprovements in hard-drive capacity made it uncompetitive in price terms.^[1]\nBubble memory was used for some time in the 1970s and 1980s in applications\nwhere its non-moving nature was desirable for maintenance or shock-proofing\nreasons. The introduction of flash storage and similar technologies rendered\neven this niche uncompetitive, and bubble disappeared entirely by the late\n1980s.\n\n## History[edit]\n\n### Precursors[edit]\n\nMain article: Twistor memory\n\nBubble memory is largely the brainchild of a single person, Andrew Bobeck.\nBobeck had worked on many kinds of magnetics-related projects through the\n1960s, and two of his projects put him in a particularly good position for the\ndevelopment of bubble memory. The first was the development of the first\nmagnetic-core memory system driven by a transistor-based controller, and the\nsecond was the development of twistor memory.\n\nTwistor is essentially a version of core memory that replaces the \"cores\" with\na piece of magnetic tape. The main advantage of twistor is its ability to be\nassembled by automated machines, as opposed to core, which was almost entirely\nmanual. AT&T had great hopes for twistor, believing that it would greatly\nreduce the cost of computer memory and put them in an industry leading\nposition. Instead, DRAM memories came onto the market in the early 1970s and\nrapidly replaced all previous random-access memory systems. Twistor ended up\nbeing used only in a few applications, many of them AT&T's own computers.\n\nOne interesting side effect of the twistor concept was noticed in production:\nunder certain conditions, passing a current through one of the electrical\nwires running inside the tape would cause the magnetic fields on the tape to\nmove in the direction of the current. If used properly, it allowed the stored\nbits to be pushed down the tape and pop off the end, forming a type of delay-\nline memory, but one where the propagation of the fields was under computer\ncontrol, as opposed to automatically advancing at a set rate defined by the\nmaterials used. However, such a system had few advantages over twistor,\nespecially as it did not allow random access.\n\n### Development[edit]\n\nBubble domain visualization by using CMOS-MagViewBubble memory driver\ncoils/windings/field coils and guides (T bar guides in this case); the guides\nor propagation elements, are on top of a magnetic film, which is on top of a\nsubstrate chip. This is mounted to a PCB (not shown) and then surrounded by\ntwo windings shown in yellow and blue.\n\nIn 1967, Bobeck joined a team at Bell Labs and started work on improving\ntwistor. The memory density of twistor was a function of the size of the\nwires; the length of any one wire determined how many bits it held, and many\nsuch wires were laid side-by-side to produce a larger memory system.\n\nConventional magnetic materials, like the magnetic tape used in twistor,\nallowed the magnetic signal to be placed at any location and to move in any\ndirection. Paul Charles Michaelis working with permalloy magnetic thin films\ndiscovered that it was possible to move magnetic signals in orthogonal\ndirections within the film. This seminal work led to a patent application.^[2]\nThe memory device and method of propagation were described in a paper\npresented at the 13th Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials,\nBoston, Massachusetts, 15 September 1967. The device used anisotropic thin\nmagnetic films that required different magnetic pulse combinations for\northogonal propagation directions. The propagation velocity was also dependent\non the hard and easy magnetic axes. This difference suggested that an\nisotropic magnetic medium would be desirable.\n\nThis led to the possibility of making a memory system similar to the moving-\ndomain twistor concept, but using a single block of magnetic material instead\nof many twistor wires. Starting work extending this concept using\northoferrite, Bobeck noticed an additional interesting effect. With the\nmagnetic tape materials used in twistor, the data had to be stored on\nrelatively large patches known as domains. Attempts to magnetize smaller areas\nwould fail. With orthoferrite, if the patch was written and then a magnetic\nfield was applied to the entire material, the patch would shrink down into a\ntiny circle, which he called a bubble. These bubbles were much smaller than\nthe domains of normal media like tape, which suggested that very high area\ndensities were possible.\n\nFive significant discoveries took place at Bell Labs:\n\n  1. The controlled two-dimensional motion of single wall domains in permalloy films\n  2. The application of orthoferrites\n  3. The discovery of the stable cylindrical domain\n  4. The invention of the field access mode of operation\n  5. The discovery of growth-induced uniaxial anisotropy in the garnet system and the realization that garnets would be a practical material\n\nThe bubble system cannot be described by any single invention, but in terms of\nthe above discoveries. Andy Bobeck was the sole discoverer of (4) and (5) and\nco-discoverer of (2) and (3); (1) was performed by P. Michaelis in P.\nBonyhard's group. At one point, over 60 scientists were working on the project\nat Bell Labs, many of whom have earned recognition in this field. For\ninstance, in September 1974, H.E.D. Scovil, P.C. Michaelis and Bobeck were\nawarded the IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award by the IEEE with the\nfollowing citation: For the concept and development of single-walled magnetic\ndomains (magnetic bubbles), and for recognition of their importance to memory\ntechnology.\n\nIt took some time to find the perfect material, but it was discovered that\nsome garnets had the correct properties. Bubbles would easily form in the\nmaterial and could be pushed along it fairly easily. The next problem was to\nmake them move to the proper location where they could be read back out:\ntwistor was a wire and there was only one place to go, but in a 2D sheet\nthings would not be so easy. Unlike the original experiments, the garnet did\nnot constrain the bubbles to move only in one direction, but its bubble\nproperties were too advantageous to ignore.\n\nThe solution was to imprint a pattern of tiny magnetic bars onto the surface\nof the garnet, called propagation elements. When a small magnetic field was\napplied, they would become magnetized, and the bubbles would \"stick\" to one\nend. By then reversing the field they would be attracted to the far end,\nmoving down the surface. Another reversal would pop them off the end of the\nbar to the next bar in the line, and so on, controlling or guiding the\ndirection of travel of the bubbles. T bars/guides, shaped like the letters,\nwere used in early bubble memory designs, but were later replaced by other\nshapes such as asymmetrical chevrons.^[3] In practice the magnetic field\nrotates and is provided by a pair of coils, that produce a rotating magnetic\nfield in the X and Z axes, it is this rotating magnetic field that moves the\nbubbles in the memory.\n\nAmorphous magnetic films were also considered as they had greater potential\nfor improvement of bubble memories vs garnet magnetic films, however the\nexisting experience with garnet films meant that they did not gain a foothold.\nGarnet films have the same or better magnetic properties than orthoferrite\nfilms which were considered less promising by comparison. Garnet materials (as\nfilms on top of a substrate) could allow for higher propagation speeds of the\nbubbles (bubble speed) than orthoferrites. Hard bubbles are slower and more\nerratic than normal bubbles, a problem that is often overcome by ion-\nimplantation of the garnet magnetic film with neon,^[4] and can also be done\nby coating the garnet magnetic film with permalloy.^[5]\n\nA memory device is formed by lining up tiny electromagnets at one end with\ndetectors at the other end. Bubbles written in would be slowly pushed to the\nother, forming a sheet of twistors lined up beside each other. Attaching the\noutput from the detector back to the electromagnets turns the sheet into a\nseries of loops, which can hold the information as long as needed.^[3]\n\nBubble memory is a non-volatile memory. Even when power was removed, the\nbubbles remained, just as the patterns do on the surface of a disk drive.\nBetter yet, bubble memory devices needed no moving parts: the field that\npushed the bubbles along the surface was generated electrically, whereas media\nlike tape and disk drives required mechanical movement. Finally, because of\nthe small size of the bubbles, the density was in theory much higher than\nexisting magnetic storage devices. The only downside was performance; the\nbubbles had to cycle to the far end of the sheet before they could be read.\n\nA bubble memory device consists of a case, that houses a PCB with connections\nto one or more bubble memory chips which may be translucent. The area around\nthe chips on the PCB is surrounded by two windings made of copper wire or\nother electrically conductive material, that mostly wrap the area, leaving\nsome space for the PCB to pass through the windings and connect to the chips.\nThe windings are wound in directions opposite to each other, for example one\nwinding has wires oriented along the X axis and the other winding has wires\nalong the Z axis. The windings, in turn, are surrounded by two permanent\nmagnets, one below and another above the windings. This forms an assembly that\nis housed inside the case which acts as a magnetic shield and forms a magnetic\nreturn path for the magnetic field from the magnets. The permanent magnets are\ncritical; they create a static (DC, direct current) magnetic field, used as a\nbias field that enables the contents of the memory to be retained, in other\nwords they allow bubble memories to be non-volatile. If the magnets are\nremoved, all bubbles will disappear and thus all contents will be deleted. The\nwindings create a rotating magnetic field parallel to the orientation of the\nbubble memory, at around 100 to 200 kHz. This will move or drive the bubbles\nin the magnetic film in a somewhat circular fashion, guided or restrained by\nthe propagation elements. For example, the rotating magnetic field can force\nthe bubbles to constantly circulate around loops, which may be elongated and\nare defined by the locations of the guiding elements.^[3]^[6]\n\nTo allow the bubbles to move around the bubble chips and to guide them through\nthe chip, the chips have some sort of pattern made of ferromagnetic metal that\ncan include for example asymmetrical chevrons.^[3] For example, the bubbles\ncan move around the edges of the chevrons. The patterns can be called\npropagation elements as they allow the bubbles to move or propagate across it.\nThey define pathways for the bubbles to be stored and retrieved for reading\nand the rotating magnetic field moves the bubbles along these paths. For\nbubble memory, a material like Gadolinium Gallium Garnet is used as the\nsubstrate in the chips.^[3] On top of the substrate is a magnetic film (bubble\nhost or bubble film/layer)^[5]^[4] such as a Gadolinium-containing garnet^[5]\nor more often, single crystal substituted yttrium iron garnet^[4] which holds\nthe magnetic bubbles, that is grown epitaxially with liquid-phase epitaxy with\nlead oxide flux as the liquid with yttrium oxide and other oxides, and then\nthe film is doped with ion-implantation of one or several elements, to reduce\nundesirable characteristics.^[5]^[3] The epitaxy process would be carried out\nwith a platinum crucible and wafer holder.^[4] The chevrons and other parts\nare built on top of the film.^[3] The propagation elements, including the\nchevrons, can be made of a material such as Nickel-Iron permalloy. The\nmaterials in bubble memories are chosen mainly for their magnetic\nproperties.^[3] Gadolinium Gallium Garnet is used as a substrate because it\ncan support the epitaxial growth of magnetic garnet films, and is\nnonmagnetic,^[4] although some bubble memories used Nickel-Cobalt substrates\ninstead.\n\nThe use of propagation elements formed by ion implantation instead of\npermalloy, was proposed to increase the capacity of bubble memory to 16\nMbit/cm^2.^[4]\n\n### Commercialization[edit]\n\nBubble Memory by Texas InstrumentsBubble memory by MemTech (purchaser of Intel\nMagnetics). The long sequence of letters encodes a map of the defective\nstorage loops in the memory.Bubble memory made in the USSR.4 MBit expansion\ncard for IBM XT with four Intel 71101 MBit expansion card for Apple II and IIe\nwith one Intel 7110^[7]\n\nBobeck's team soon had 1 cm (0.39 in) square memories that stored 4,096 bits,\nthe same as a then-standard plane of core memory. This sparked considerable\ninterest in the industry. Not only could bubble memories replace core but it\nseemed that they could replace tapes and disks as well. In fact, it seemed\nthat bubble memory would soon be the only form of memory used in the vast\nmajority of applications, with the high-performance market being the only one\nthey could not serve.\n\nThe technology was included in experimental devices from Bell Labs in\n1974.^[8] By the mid-1970s, practically every large electronics company had\nteams working on bubble memory.^[9] Texas Instruments introduced the first\ncommercial product that incorporated bubble memory in 1977, and introduced the\nfirst commercially available bubble memory, the TIB 0103 with 92 kilobit\ncapacity.^[10]^[11]^[12] By the late 1970s several products were on the\nmarket, and Intel released their own 1-megabit version, the 7110, in\n1979.^[13]^[14]^[15] By the early 1980s, however, bubble memory technology\nbecame a dead end with the introduction of hard disk systems offering higher\nstorage densities, higher access speeds, and lower costs. In 1981 major\ncompanies working on the technology closed their bubble memory\noperations,^[16] notably Rockwell, National Semiconductor, Texas Instruments\nand Plessey, leaving a \"big five\" group of companies still pursuing \"second-\ngeneration bubble\" by 1984: Intel, Motorola, Hitachi, SAGEM and Fujitsu.^[17]\n4-megabit bubble memories such as the Intel 7114, were introduced in\n1983^[18]^[19]^[20] and 16-megabit bubble memory was developed.^[21]^[22]\n\nBubble memory found uses in niche markets through the 1980s in systems needing\nto avoid the higher rates of mechanical failures of disk drives, and in\nsystems operating in high vibration or harsh environments. This application\nbecame obsolete too with the development of flash storage, which also brought\nperformance, density, and cost benefits.\n\nOne application was Konami's Bubble System arcade video game system,\nintroduced in 1984. It featured interchangeable bubble memory cartridges on a\n68000-based board. The Bubble System required a \"warm-up\" time of about 85\nseconds (prompted by a timer on the screen when switched on) before the game\nwas loaded, as bubble memory needs to be heated to around 30 to 40 \u00b0C (86 to\n104 \u00b0F) to operate properly. Fujitsu used bubble memory on their FM-8 in 1981\nand Sharp used it in their PC 5000 series, a laptop-like portable computer\nfrom 1983. Nicolet used bubble memory modules for saving waveforms in their\nModel 3091 oscilloscope, as did HP who offered a $1595 bubble memory option\nthat extended the memory on their model 3561A digital signal analyzer. GRiD\nSystems Corporation used it in their early laptops. TIE communication used it\nin the early development of digital phone systems in order to lower their MTBF\nrates and produce a non-volatile telephone system's central processor.^[23]\nBubble memory was also used on the Quantel Mirage DVM8000/1 VFX\nsystem.^[citation needed]\n\nTo store the bubbles, the propagation elements are in pairs and side to side,\nand are arranged in rows called loops to store the bubbles, thus they are\nstorage loops since the bubbles that are stored in a loop will constantly\ncirculate around it, forced by the rotating magnetic field that can also move\nthe bubbles elsewhere. Bubble memories have extra spare loops to allow for\nincreased yield during manufacturing as they replace defective loops. The list\nof defective loops is programmed onto the memory, on a special, separate loop\ncalled a boot loop, and it is also often printed on the label of the memory. A\nbubble memory controller will read the boot loop every time a bubble memory\nsystem is powered on, during initialization the controller will put the boot\nloop data in a boot loop register. Writing into a bubble memory is done by a\nformatter within the memory controller and signals from bits read in the\nbubble memory are amplified by the sense amplifier of the controller and they\nwill reference the boot loop register to avoid overwriting, or further reading\nof the data in the boot loop.^[3]\n\nThe bubbles are created (the memory is written) with a seed bubble that is\nconstantly split or cut by a hairpin-shaped piece of electrically conductive\nwire (such as aluminum-copper alloy) using a current strong enough to locally\novercome and reverse the magnetic bias field generated by the magnets, thus\nthe hairpin-shaped piece of wire acts as a small electromagnet. The seed\nbubble regains its original size quickly after cutting. The seed bubble\ncirculates under a circular permalloy patch which keeps it from moving\nelsewhere. After generation, the bubbles then circulate into an \"input track\"\nand then into a storage loop. Old bubbles could be moved out of the loop into\nan \"output track\" for destruction later. The space left behind by the old\nbubbles would then be available for new ones.^[3] If the seed bubble is ever\nlost, a new one can be nucleated via special signals sent to the bubble memory\nand a current 2 to 4 times higher than necessary for cutting of bubbles from\nthe seed bubble.^[4]\n\nThe bubbles in a storage loop (and empty spaces for bubbles) constantly\ncirculate around it. To read a bubble, it would be \"replicated\" by moving it\nto a larger propagation element to stretch the bubble, then it would be passed\nunder a hairpin-shaped conductor to cut it into two with a current pulse which\nlasts 1/4 of a hertz and is shaped as a spike waveform with a long trailing\nedge, this would split the bubble in two, one of which would continue\ncirculating in the storage loop, keeping the bubble and thus data safe in case\nof power failure. The other bubble would be moved to an output track to move\nit to a detector which is a magnetoresistive bridge, made of a column of\ninterconnected permalloy chevrons where the chevrons are one behind the other,\nand before it there are similar columns of chevrons that are not\ninterconnected. These stretch the bubbles to generate a larger output at the\ndetector. The detector has a constant electric current, and when bubbles pass\nunder it, they change slightly the electrical resistance and thus current in\nthe detector, and the movement of the bubbles creates a voltage in the order\nof millivolts, and this is read as either a 1 or a 0. Because the bubble must\nbe moved to a specific area to be read, there are latency constraints. After\nthe detector the bubbles are run into a guard rail to destroy them. A 1 is\nrepresented by a bubble, and a 0 is represented by the absence of a\nbubble.^[3]\n\nThe gadolinium gallium garnet wafers used as substrates for the bubble chips,\nwere 3 inches in diameter and cost $100 each in 1982 as their production\nrequired the use of iridium crucibles.^[4]\n\n### Further applications[edit]\n\nIn 2007, the idea of using microfluidic bubbles as logic (rather than memory)\nwas proposed by MIT researchers. The bubble logic would use nanotechnology and\nhas been demonstrated to have access times of 7 ms, which is faster than the\n10 ms access times that contemporary hard drives had, though it is slower than\nthe access time of traditional RAM and of traditional logic circuits, making\nthe proposal not commercially practical. ^[24]\n\nIBM's 2008 work on racetrack memory is essentially a 1-dimensional version of\nbubble, bearing an even closer relationship to the original serial twistor\nconcept.^[25]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Gadolinium gallium garnet, used in many bubble memories as a substrate\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Bubble Memory\". 10 Technologies that were Supposed to Blow Up but Never Did.
