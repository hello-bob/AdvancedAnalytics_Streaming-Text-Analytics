And with privacy concerns mounting\nand Safari starting to gain web browser leadership, it\u2019s becoming more\ndifficult for Apple to continue the partnership.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Apple to end this partnership and find a more suitable\nalternative.\n\n## Google Search is Dying\n\nGoogle\u2019s search quality has been decreasing for years, with more ads, less\nuseful links, and more knowledge-based content. Many people are commenting\nthat Google is no longer producing high-quality search results. Some searches\nshow the entire screen filled with Google ads instead of organic search\nresults. In fact, an increasing number of users have even turned to\nalternative sites like Reddit for their search queries.\n\nTo make matters worse, the rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT has become a one-\ntwo punch to Google\u2019s search dominance. The large language models (LLMs), on\nwhich ChatGPT is based, are writing Google\u2019s obituary.\n\nInitially, they\u2019ll assist in the creation of large-scale SEO spam content,\nlikely exacerbating existing problems of search relevance.\n\nSecondly they\u2019ve given Bing, Google\u2019s biggest search competitor, momentum that\nit was sorely missing. The integration of ChatGPT functionality in Bing led to\nover 100M daily active users in just the first month of release.\n\nBing\u2019s ChatGPT integration has also shown that Google is no longer on the\nleading edge of machine learning innovation. As a response, Google hurriedly\nannounced and released Bard, their LLM chatbot. Comparisons show that Google\u2019s\nBard chatbot to be less useful and less sophisticated than both ChatGPT or\nBing\u2019s chatbot.\n\nFinally, no-one has yet demonstrated a proven business model for AI chatbots.\nAt least none that can replace the billions that Google currently makes via\nsearch and cost-per-click keyword advertising.\n\nWith nothing to lose, a smaller competitor could go all-in on chatbots as an\nalternative to the Google search box habit. But for Google itself, until\nthere\u2019s a proven and lucrative business model, the strategy cost would be too\nlarge.\n\n## Privacy. That\u2019s (sometimes) Apple.\n\nPrivacy is a key concern for many users, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why Apple\nhas been so successful with its privacy focused marketing campaigns. However,\none area where Apple falls short is with its default use of Google Search in\nSafari.\n\nGoogle\u2019s placement in Safari undermines Apple\u2019s core brand value of privacy\nand security. Incomplete web address text, manually typed addresses, and much\nof your browsing behaviour is transmitted to Google due to this partnership.\n\nGiving a significant amount of user data, which can be used for targeted\nadvertising and other purposes to Google, violates users\u2019 privacy and is\nsomething that Apple needs to address.\n\nIf Apple decides to remove Google as its default search engine, does it have\nthe pieces to replace it?\n\nApple\u2019s Spotlight Search is already a powerful tool for finding files and\ndocuments on both a user\u2019s device, and on the web. With its own web crawler,\nthe Apple Bot, Apple crawls the web and indexes pages to be used in Spotlight\nSearch results. Although Spotlight\u2019s web results are currently limited in both\nscale and placement, Apple could expand its reach and index more pages to\nprovide greater relevancy.\n\nApple could also supplement its own results with a more limited partnership,\nif necessary, to integrate third-party web results. Microsoft happily partners\nwith several search engines, such as DuckDuckGo, to provide users with more\ndiverse search data and would likely be a willing partner to Apple. By\npartnering with Microsoft, Apple could quickly offer comprehensive search\nresults while still maintaining control and a focus on privacy and security.\n\nApple has already demonstrated that they can create successful alternatives to\nGoogle products. Apple Maps, launched in 2012, initially faced several hiccups\nand criticisms, but today, it arguably matches or exceeds Google Maps in many\nareas.\n\nWith that in mind, Apple has the necessary expertise and components to replace\nGoogle as its search partner.\n\n## How Can Apple Replace $15 Billion in Revenue?\n\nApple\u2019s partnership with Google generates a significant amount of revenue,\nreportedly between $8-12 billion in 2020 alone, and potentially as much as $15\nbillion in 2021.\n\nThis agreement apparently includes terms stating that Apple will not develop\nits own internet search engine. So, how can Apple replace such a significant\nrevenue stream?\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know, Apple is an ad company now. It\u2019s estimated that ads brings\nin $4 Billion per year in revenue, primarily through the App Store. With\nexperience in large-scale keyword based cost-per-click advertising in the App\nStore, it would be straightforward to bring this technology to a web-based\nApple Search product.\n\nSeamlessly, through a software update to their two billion active devices,\nApple could direct almost 20% of global search traffic (Safari\u2019s current\nbrowser marketshare) to their own search solution.\n\nThat would also redirect 20% of Google\u2019s $162 Billion search market (in 2022)\n\u2013 or over $30 Billion annually \u2013 to Apple\u2019s search advertising product.\nRedirected revenue that is more than double the amount that Apple is reported\nto receive through the existing Google search partnership.\n\nSo the question becomes not if Apple can replace $15 Billion in revenue. The\nquestion becomes why is Apple currently forgoing an additional $15 Billion in\nrevenue?\n\n## It\u2019s time\n\nApple should end its long-standing partnership with Google Search and find a\nmore suitable alternative. All of the pieces are in place for Apple to\nsuccessfully take on the web search business \u2013 with no technical, product or\nbusiness impediments remaining.\n\nWith the necessary components and expertise, it\u2019s time for Apple to take the\nbold step of replacing Google Search and bring more competition to the space.\n\n## Insights\n\nThoughts on privacy, tracking and advertising on the internet.\n\n#### View all insights\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Magic Lasso Redesigned\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Improvements to YouTube ad blocking\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Digital Advertising May Be Causing Almost 2% of Global Carbon Emissions\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Introducing Adblock Performance Insights\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Introducing Tap to Block, Custom Rules and Strict Mode\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Magic Lasso Adblock 2023 Year in Review\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Safari's Dangerous Defaults\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Is Chrome the new IE?\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### The Triumph of Safari\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### The Tragedy of Safari\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Introducing best in class YouTube ad blocking\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Magic Lasso: Adblock that doubles your battery life\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Introducing Magic Lasso Adblock 2.0\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### \u201cHey Google, stop tracking me\u201d\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Is advertising immoral?\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Google\u2019s attempts to undermine ad blockers\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### What difference does an adblocker really make?\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Magic Lasso Adblock 2018 Year in Review\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### Why use an adblocker?\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n###### Insights\n\n### The problem with internet ads and the inevitable rise of adblocking\n\n#### Read more \u2192\n\n## Stay up-to-date\n\nSign-up to our newsletter to receive special offers, news and insights.\n\n###### Magic Lasso Adblock\n\n###### Why Magic Lasso?\n\n###### Features\n\n###### Insights\n\n###### Download Magic Lasso\n\n###### Adblock for iPhone\n\n###### Adblock for iPad\n\n###### Adblock for Mac\n\n###### Support\n\n###### Twitter\n\n###### Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": true}
