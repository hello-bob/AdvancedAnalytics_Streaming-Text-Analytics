But given the nebulous nature of the term \"AI,\" which can apply\nto a broad spectrum of computer technology, it's unclear if this group will\neven be able to agree on what exactly they are safeguarding us from.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nBiden issues sweeping executive order that touches AI risk, deepfakes, privacy\n\nPresident Biden directed DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to establish the\nboard, which will meet for the first time in early May and subsequently on a\nquarterly basis.\n\nThe fundamental assumption posed by the board's existence, and reflected in\nBiden's AI executive order from October, is that AI is an inherently risky\ntechnology and that American citizens and businesses need to be protected from\nits misuse. Along those lines, the goal of the group is to help guard against\nforeign adversaries using AI to disrupt US infrastructure; develop\nrecommendations to ensure the safe adoption of AI tech into transportation,\nenergy, and Internet services; foster cross-sector collaboration between\ngovernment and businesses; and create a forum where AI leaders to share\ninformation on AI security risks with the DHS.\n\nIt's worth noting that the ill-defined nature of the term \"Artificial\nIntelligence\" does the new board no favors regarding scope and focus. AI can\nmean many different things: It can power a chatbot, fly an airplane, control\nthe ghosts in Pac-Man, regulate the temperature of a nuclear reactor, or play\na great game of chess. It can be all those things and more, and since many of\nthose applications of AI work very differently, there's no guarantee any two\npeople on the board will be thinking about the same type of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis confusion is reflected in the quotes provided by the DHS press release\nfrom new board members, some of whom are already talking about different types\nof AI. While OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic are monetizing generative AI\nsystems like ChatGPT based on large language models (LLMs), Ed Bastian, the\nCEO of Delta Air Lines, refers to entirely different classes of machine\nlearning when he says, \"By driving innovative tools like crew resourcing and\nturbulence prediction, AI is already making significant contributions to the\nreliability of our nation\u2019s air travel system.\"\n\nSo, defining the scope of what AI exactly means\u2014and which applications of AI\nare new or dangerous\u2014might be one of the key challenges for the new board.\n\n## A roundtable of Big Tech CEOs attracts criticism\n\nFor the inaugural meeting of the AI Safety and Security Board, the DHS\nselected a tech industry-heavy group, populated with CEOs of four major AI\nvendors (Sam Altman of OpenAI, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Sundar Pichai of\nAlphabet, and Dario Amodei of Anthopic), CEO Jensen Huang of top AI chipmaker\nNvidia, and representatives from other major tech companies like IBM, Adobe,\nAmazon, Cisco, and AMD. There are also reps from big aerospace and aviation:\nNorthrop Grumman and Delta Air Lines.\n\nUpon reading the announcement, some critics took issue with the board\ncomposition. On LinkedIn, founder of The Distributed AI Research Institute\n(DAIR) Timnit Gebru especially criticized OpenAI's presence on the board and\nwrote, \"I've now seen the full list and it is hilarious. Foxes guarding the\nhen house is an understatement.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n45\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.

I mean, I know this is how \"boards\" generally end up\ngoing but this seems like it'll be moderately more impactful than the average\nand I don't have great confidence in any of these people knowing what they're\ndoing.\n\nAlso noticeably absent is anyone with a direct stake in open-source AI,\nalthough the big cloud providers tend to be vaguely for it. There's no Meta or\nHuggingface.\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 8:46 pm\n\nSajuuk\n\nAre you telling me America continues to be 4 corporations in a trenchcoat?
