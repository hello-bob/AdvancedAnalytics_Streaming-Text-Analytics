Chappell mentions the historical diaries of people\n> like Anne Frank, saying they\u2019re more than one person\u2019s thoughts \u2013 they tell\n> us about both the individual life and how society functioned around them.\n\nlearning from other people, even in the things they feel are mundane, tells us\nso much about the world around us and how people really think, how they feel,\ntheir motivations, their relatability\u2014the real kind, not the commodified form\nin social media influencing. there's so much online that thrives on extreme\nemotions like outrage; it's a fundamental part of the sharing and attention\neconomy. i continually find myself being inspired and having my soul's cup\nfilled from being able to slow down, appreciate others' hard work into the\nwebsites they're creating, and see their lives through the way they arrange\ntheir pages or write their blog.\n\nwhenever i feel myself being pulled again by the dopamine receptors in my\nbrain, i take a step back and become much more intentional with my time,\nefforts, and my energy. i ask myself, \"what am i getting out of this, truly?\nis this actually the path i want to be on? how does this actually affect my\nlife?\" that helps me reset and feel motivated to keep going in the way that i\nknow makes me feel joy in my everyday life.\n\nit's not particularly easy to do this, hence why i don't call this \"the easy\nway.\" in my view, the easy way is to lean into the manipulations around you,\nyearning and vying for your attention at every turn. it's falling into the\nhabit of allowing entities that are not looking out for you, no matter how\nsmall, to control your behavior through things like doomscrolling and checking\nnotifications. i am not available on the internet 24/7, and i don't want to\nbe. i definitely have been, and i have always felt burnt out, depleted, and\ndepressed afterward.\n\nit is a deep deprogramming that must be done, and it even happens with web-\nbuilders who are making their own websites and participating in the personal\nweb. because i like to keep up with folks new to this hobby, it is not\nuncommon to see webgardeners no longer interested in the hobby after consuming\nthemselves with it. instead of thinking your life has to become this hobby,\nthink of how building a website complements your life. how does building a\nwebsite give you an opportunity to show the things in your life that do\nmatter, the parts of you that you want to share? to me, building a website is\na means to an end\u2014it is a way to express ourselves, to make it accessible and\nlong-lasting across time and space; it is not the end itself.\n\nsocial media has programmed us to believe our digital presences require\nfrequent updating, glossy completed projects, apologies when you spend any\ntime away from it; this just isn't necessary in the personal web. you dictate\nyour own time schedule. you alone control how much time, effort, and at what\npace you learn and build.\n\nopting out of that way of thinking is difficult; it has been perfected by\ncompanies to explicitly target how your brain works. what i describe might be\nconsidered \"the hard way,\" but i think i prefer the small way, the slow way.\ni'm okay with living slower and being more intentional, even with my behavior\non the web, even within building websites for fun. it's OK to miss out on\nwhat's happening elsewhere if it doesn't really affect me. it allows me to see\nmore of what this life has to offer and what means most to me. i get to read\nso much more of others' perspectives and learn how other people live by\nexploring the personal web. i grow empathy, i gain perspective, i flesh out my\npersonal beliefs, i reprogram my brain so i can live happier, healthier, and\nwith a better relationship with the world around me.\n\nwhen i re-read that to myself, it doesn't really feel so small anymore.\n\n#internet\n\nPowered by Bear \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\n\n", "frontpage": false}
