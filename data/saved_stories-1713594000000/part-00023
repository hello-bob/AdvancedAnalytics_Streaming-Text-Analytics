He later obtained a Ph.D. in biology at Harvard\nUniversity. His thesis, defended in 1970 and supervised by Torsten Wiesel, was\ntitled Insect Retinas: Information processing in the compound eye.\n\nAfter the 1973 military coup led by Augusto Pinochet, Varela and his family\nspent 7 years in exile in the United States before he returned to Chile to\nbecome a professor of biology at the Universidad de Chile.\n\nVarela became familiar, by practice, with Tibetan Buddhism in the 1970s,\ninitially studying, together with Keun-Tshen Goba (n\u00e9 Ezequiel Hernandez\nUrdaneta), with the meditation master Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, founder of\nVajradhatu and Shambhala Training, and later with Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche.\n\nIn 1986, he settled in France, where he first taught cognitive science and\nepistemology at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, and later neuroscience at the\nUniversity of Paris. From 1988 until his death, he led a research group, as\nDirector of Research at the CNRS (Centre National de Recherche Scientifique).\n\nIn 1987, Varela, along with R. Adam Engle, founded the Mind and Life\nInstitute, initially to sponsor a series of dialogues between scientists and\nthe Dalai Lama about the relationship between modern science and Buddhism.^[3]\nThe Institute continues today as a major nexus for such dialog as well as\npromoting and supporting multidisciplinary scientific investigation in mind\nsciences, contemplative scholarship and practice and related areas in the\ninterface of science with meditation and other contemplative practices,\nespecially Buddhist practices.^[4]\n\nVarela died in 2001 in Paris of Hepatitis C after having written an account of\nhis 1998 liver transplant.^[5] Varela had four children, including the\nactress, environmental spokesperson, and model Leonor Varela.\n\n## Work and legacy[edit]\n\nVarela was trained as a biologist, mathematician and philosopher through the\ninfluence of different teachers, Humberto Maturana and Torsten Wiesel.\n\nHe wrote and edited a number of books and numerous journal articles in\nbiology, neurology, cognitive science, mathematics, and philosophy. He\nfounded, with others, the Integral Institute, a thinktank dedicated to the\ncross-fertilization of ideas and disciplines.\n\nVarela supported embodied philosophy, viewing human cognition and\nconsciousness in terms of the enactive structures in which they arise. These\ncomprise the body (as a biological system and as personally experienced) and\nthe physical world which it enacts.^[6]\n\nVarela's work popularized within the field of neuroscience the concept of\nneurophenomenology. This concept combined the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl\nand of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, with \"first-person science.\" Neurophenomenology\nrequires observers to examine their own conscious experience using\nscientifically verifiable methods.\n\nIn the 1996 popular book The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of\nLiving Systems, physicist Fritjof Capra makes extensive reference to Varela\nand Maturana's theory of autopoiesis as part of a new, systems-based\nscientific approach for describing the interrelationships and interdependence\nof psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena.^[7]\nWritten for a general audience, The Web of Life helped popularize the work of\nVarela and Maturana, as well as that of Ilya Prigogine and Gregory\nBateson.^[8]\n\nVarela's 1991 book The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience,\nco-authored with Evan Thompson and Eleanor Rosch, is considered a classic in\nthe field of cognitive science, offering pioneering phenomenological\nconnections and introducing the Buddhism-informed enactivist and embodied\ncognition approach.^[9] A revised edition of The Embodied Mind was published\nin 2017, featuring substantive introductions by the surviving authors, as well\nas a preface by Jon Kabat-Zinn.^[10]\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\nVarela wrote numerous books and articles:^[11]\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n  * 1979\\.
