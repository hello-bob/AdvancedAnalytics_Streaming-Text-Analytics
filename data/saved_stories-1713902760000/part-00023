Consumers are driving a revolution in the way they\naccess, store, and use digital content. With constant upgrade cycles and data\ncapacity increases, securing personal data becomes a more important problem\nevery day. Cryptographic file systems allow a consumer to encrypt and\npassword-protect removable drives, including universal serial bus (USB)\ndrives, memory sticks, and flash cards. Linux and open source provide\ndifferent solutions for this matter. Linux is a popular choice for application\ndevelopers of today's the Internet of Things (IoT)and wireless consumer\ndevices because of its flexibility and ease of use. However, wide usage of\ncryptographic file systems is limited due to its lack of standardization. The\nwrong choice of API could leave users with a false sense of performance, or\nworse, with a false sense of security. This paper performs a comprehensive\ncomparison of cipher algorithms and investigates the usage of the Linux\nCryptoloop and Dm-crypt Crypto application programming interfaces (APIs) and\ndemonstrates their performance in cryptographic file systems most commonly\nused in CE, to help users decide which encryption method and algorithm should\nbe used.\n\nFull Text: PDF DOI: 10.15640/jcsit.v11n1a1\n\n### Browse Journals\n\n  * View Related Journals\n  * Journals by Subjects\n  * Multilanguage Journals\n  * Complete List of Journals\n\n### Journal Policies\n\n  * E-Publication First^TM\n  * Read the Journal's Plagiarism Policy\n  * Read the Journal's Copyright Policy\n  * Submission & Review Policy\n\n### Information\n\n  * For Contributors\n  * For Reviewers\n  * For Readers\n  * For Librarians\n\n### Useful Links\n\n  * Call for Papers\n  * Submit Your Paper\n  * Publish in Your Native Language\n  * Subscribe the Journal\n  * Frequently Asked Questions\n  * Contact the Executive Editor\n  * Recommend this Journal to Librarian\n  * View the Current Issue\n  * View the Previous Issues\n  * Recommend this Journal to Friends\n  * Recommend a Special Issue\n  * Comment on the Journal\n  * Publish the Conference Proceedings\n\n### Latest Activities\n\n  * Recruitment of Reviewers\n  * Publication Plan\n  * Resources for Authors\n\n### Resources\n\n  * Manuscript Preparation Guidelines\n  * APA Style (6th Edition)\n  * How to review a book\n  * Writing a good research paper\n  * Google Language Translator\n  * Research Guidelines\n\n### Visiting Status\n\nToday| 945  \n---|---  \nYesterday| 192  \nThis Month| 2845  \nLast Month| 2188  \nAll Days| 1425023  \nOnline| 98  \n  \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Brooklyn Research and Publishing Institute.
