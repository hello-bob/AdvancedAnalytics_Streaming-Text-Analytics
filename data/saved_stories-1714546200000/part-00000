If you start counting with my paid internship in college,\nI\u2019ve had a roughly 30-year career in the software industry, give or take a\nyear. I feel extremely lucky that the web came along just as I was getting my\nfeet wet as a developer. World-changing technologies are rare.\n\nTiming matters. This is part of what Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s book Outliers is\nabout.\n\nAs I get older, I\u2019m increasingly aware of how easy it is to become bitter and\nset in my ways. There are many episodes of Core Intuition where I complain\nabout Swift or SwiftUI. Why do we need a new programming language when the old\none is still perfectly fine? \ud83e\udd2a\n\nThe tech and startup world has had no shortage of over-hyped sidetracks.\nBlockchain is the most recent flop. Just because a technology is novel,\ndoesn\u2019t mean a practical purpose and business model will emerge.\n\nI almost never jump on trends because you can waste so much time chasing\nproductivity gains that you actually end up going backwards. I run my servers\nwith old tech. I use tried and true programming languages and frameworks. I am\nnot cutting edge.\n\nSome people think generative AI is in the same line as other problematic new\ntechnologies, fads that come and go, leaving a string of wrecked businesses\nand broken apps in their wake. I understand the hesitation. We have been\ninundated with tech companies that don\u2019t care about data privacy, don\u2019t care\nabout how energy use affects the climate, and don\u2019t care as much about user\ncontrol as they do about profit.\n\nIt is with this backdrop that I get to the point: this AI shit is real. It\nwill change almost everything. I\u2019m not expecting to see another truly game-\nchanging technology for the rest of my career. This is the one.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we should move fast and break things. I\u2019m trying to be\nthoughtful about this. The new photos search and accessibility feature we\nintroduced in Micro.blog today is a first step, and perhaps we won\u2019t take the\nnext step for another year or longer. It\u2019s useful today, as a tool to help\npeople do more with their time, and that\u2019s enough for now.\n\nAlso on Bluesky\n\nThe Art Of Not Asking Why\n\noh man, do I have a long (and probably grumpy) discussion about the \"Oh no,\nAI!\" wagon. As you say, AI shit is real, but the immediate reaction many have,\nwell, let's just say it reminds me of other familiar patterns.\n\nI noticed how you were super careful in your latest clip about AI and trying\nto assure everyone that MB is not being sold to the AI devil and I was\nwondering if I should mention it... well, here you go.\n\n11:43 am\n\nManton Reece @manton\n\n  * RSS\n  * JSON Feed\n  * Surprise me!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
