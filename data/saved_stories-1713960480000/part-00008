According to a leak that\nsurfaced on the internet today, Elektron\u2019s first new hardware in two years\nwill come with a big memory boost, stereo samples, 16 flexible tracks, and\nmore.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Elektron Digitakt II\n\nEver since the Syntakt came out two years ago, fans have been waiting for new\nhardware from the Swedish manufacturer. While Elektron has been busy keeping\nthe current models up to date with several important software updates, the\nmachines themselves stayed the same. Until now: It looks like the Elektron\nDigitakt II is coming soon \u2013 the first major hardware refresh for a Digi-\nseries machine.\n\nAccording to the leak, the basic concept of a sampling drum machine that can\nalso run your external MIDI gear remains unchanged. Apart from a couple of new\nbuttons and labels, the Elektron Digitakt II closely resembles its\npredecessor. But the manufacturer has reportedly implemented a bunch of\nimportant upgrades under the hood.\n\nFirst and foremost, the Digitakt II boasts 400 MB of sample memory, as opposed\nto the predecessor\u2019s 64 MB. The internal storage has also been increased to a\nwhopping 20 GB, firmly establishing the Digitakt II in MPC territory.\n\nElektron Digitakt II\n\n## 16 Tracks for Audio or MIDI\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe other big news concerns the audio and MIDI tracks. While the original\nDigitakt offered eight audio and MIDI tracks each, the new version has 16\ntracks that you can freely assign to the internal sampling engine or external\nMIDI. Moreover, each audio track is now apparently capable of playing back\nstereo or mono samples \u2013 finally! From 16 stereo audio tracks to 16 pure MIDI\ntracks, it looks like any combination is possible. This should make the\nElektron Digitakt II much more flexible when it comes to adapting the machine\nto your workflow and setup. Consequently, the track labels (Kick, Snare, Tom,\netc.) are now history.\n\nApart from the track button labeling, you really have to squint to discover\nany major changes to the user interface. If you look closely, though, you\u2019ll\nnotice two new buttons. The row of buttons beneath the encoders has been\nexpanded with a new FX button, and there\u2019s a new keyboard button on the left.\nWhat exactly they do remains to be seen.\n\nWith a big memory boost, stereo sampling, and much more flexibility in the\nhandling of audio and MIDI tracks, it looks like the Elektron Digitakt II\naddresses many of the predecessor\u2019s shortcomings. Does the upgrade live up to\nthe expectations? That\u2019s for you to decide.\n\n## Price and availability\n\nElektron has yet to announce the Digitakt II. But the leak states a price of\n\u20ac949.
