All Photos: Courtesy of Marina\nSimeone/Campo Hobbit\n\nBilbo Baggins is hardly the stuff of Aryan racial fantasy. It\u2019s hard to\nimagine Tolkien\u2019s furry, gluttonous protagonist goose-stepping the halls of\nBag End or organizing mass rallies in the idyllic Shire countryside.\n\nBut for thousands of Italian fantasy fans, hobbits are the symbol of a radical\nmovement to reimagine fascism and restore far-right movements to glory.\n\nAtlas Obscura Trips\n\nNEW \u2014 Italian Food & Wine: Eating Regionally\n\nView This Trip\n\nTolkien\u2019s misanthropic halflings make for unlikely fascist heroes, and their\nrise to iconic status among Italy\u2019s far right is a story almost circuitous\nenough to be worthy of the author himself.\n\nNot long before Tolkien first published The Hobbit in 1937, Italy was a great\nlaboratory of experimental thought. Futurists composed music made entirely of\nmotor noises, Marxists preached against \u201ccultural hegemony\u201d from jail cells,\nand Theosophists hunted for evidence of the primordial \u201croot race\u201d.\n\nFrom this heady mix emerged Julius Evola, one of history\u2019s most influential\nphilosophers of fascism. Borrowing from Eastern philosophy and Western lore,\nEvola\u2019s magnum opus, Revolt Against the Modern World, describes the history of\nEuropean civilization as one of inexorable decline. The stated cause of this\ndecline, paradoxically, was progress\u2014progress away from mythical traditions\nand perennial wisdom, toward industrialization and cultural miscegenation.\n\nCamp Hobbit imitated left-wing youth movements, bringing together musicians,\njournalists, artists, and militants in a festival atmosphere. Among some\nattendees, fascist haircuts were traded for long hair and beards.\n\nAs a solution, Evola proposed a radical program to resurrect the myths of\n\u201ctraditional\u201d societies through art, religion, and, initially, politics. At\nfirst, Evola saw fascist leader Benito Mussolini as his great hope for the\nrebirth of \u201ctraditional\u201d society, even authoring for the dictator a doctrine\nof \u201cspiritual racism\u201d that would rank the world\u2019s races according to their\ncloseness to the \u201cperennial\u201d tradition.\n\nBut as the Second World War unfolded, Mussolini failed Evola\u2019s ideological\npurity test. Italy embraced \u201cscientific\u201d racism and the rhetoric of\n\u201cprogress,\u201d and modern fascism revealed itself to be a kind of Evolian\nantichrist\u2014a once-heralded usher of a Golden Age turned catalyst of an even\nmore rapid decline.\n\nEdged out of the mainstream, Evola faded from fashion. But elements of his\nphilosophy, known as \u201cTraditionalism,\u201d lingered sacrilegiously on the edges of\nmainstream thought. Like Tolkien\u2019s ring of power, they lay dormant, waiting\nfor their moment to rise again.\n\nA poster for Campo Hobbit I. Camp Hobbit was advertised as a place where\npolitical activists, musicians, and graphic artists could build a new\n\u201calternative\u201d cultural movement.\n\nWhile Evola was theorizing a radical break with modernity, J.R.R. Tolkien was\nliving it. After decades cloistered in the English department of a medieval\nuniversity, rearranging the elements of Anglo-Saxon lore, Tolkien published\nThe Hobbit, in 1937, followed, almost 20 years later, by The Lord of the\nRings.\n\nSince their publication, many critics have labored to decode hidden allegories\nof real-world events in the adventures of the Fellowship. Because of its\nracial essentialism and black-and-white morality, Tolkien has often been\naccused of crypto-fascism.\n\n\u201cGood and evil are separated like oil and water,\u201d wrote Robert Westall in a\n1981 review. \u201cThe orcs are simple hero-bait, to be slaughtered ad infinitum,\npiled in heaps and burnt. They are given a lower status than rats.\u201d\n\nCritics have read Bilbo\u2019s furious love of rural Shire life as a sign of\nbourgeois elitism. Some have even suggested that Mordor\u2019s hordes, with their\ninnumerable number and cockney accents, are a parallel for the working poor of\nTolkien\u2019s day and the threat of proletarian revolt.\n\nOthers point to his protagonists\u2019 casual attitude to the mass murder of orcs\nas an indication of their suppressed genocidal nature.\n\nThe tent city at Camp Hobbit. The celtic cross, used here on a banner based on\nthe Nazi flag, became a symbol of the movement emerging from Camp Hobbit.\n\n\u201c[Hobbits] are not merely good natured, comfort-loving, seedcake-eating\nhedonists,\u201d wrote literary critic Peter Firchow. \u201cUnder the influence of a\npowerful wizard and a group of assorted warlike companions, [they can become]\nvery different sorts of beings whose actions are at times reminiscent of some\nof the worst phenomena of recent European history.\u201d\n\nTolkien never answered these criticisms by admitting any parallels with real\npolitics. Yet his project of resurrecting and reinterpreting the ancient lore\nof England had much in common with Julius Evola.\n\nTolkien and Evola\u2019s paths never actually crossed. Even in the post-war years,\nwhen they shared a mutual dislike of American cultural imperialism, Tolkien\u2019s\nwork was never associated with Traditionalism in the English-speaking world.\n\nBut when The Lord of the Rings was first published in Italian, in 1971, the\nlatent politics of his stout-hearted heroes bubbled to the surface. Appearing\nwhen it did, The Lord of the Rings had an outsized influence on the Italian\ncultural scene. In the early 1970s, Italy was in the midst of a cultural\nupheaval as great as that Evola felt in the aftermath of the First World War.\n\nA sign at Camp Hobbit reads, \u201cEuropean youth fight against / communist\nsubversion / capitalist slavery.\u201d Camp Hobbit attendees saw themselves as\nstaking out a \u201cthird position\u201d in Italian politics beyond right and left.\n\nAcross Europe, the cultural dominance of the Left, cemented by the defeat of\nfascism, was beginning to be challenged by a new movement called the nouvelle\ndroite or \u201cNew Right.\u201d The central claim of the New Right was that they were\nnot your father\u2019s fascists, and not to blame for the horrors of Nazism. They\nwere your grandfather\u2019s fascists, better, your great-great grandfather\u2019s,\nfascists who still worshipped the pagan gods and yearned for simpler times of\ncultural homogeneity and ethnocentrism.\n\nThe movement found great success in Italy, where Evola had already laid much\nof the philosophical groundwork. For Italy\u2019s disillusioned youth, Tolkien\u2019s\nbooks seemed to affirm the noble struggle of traditional societies against the\nencroaching menace of industrialization, progressive politics, and groupthink.\n\nTolkien quickly became required reading for the serious among Italy\u2019s \u201cneo-\nfascist\u201d youth groups. But even with the adventures of Sam and Frodo to bond\nover, many in this crowd felt isolated and overwhelmed in the face of a\nculturally dominant Left.\n\nIn 1977, leaders from Italy\u2019s far right party and youth movement planned to\nchange that. They proposed a fascist Woodstock, a two-day \u201cback to nature\u201d\nretreat organized around the celebration of Tolkien\u2019s work. They called it\n\u201cCamp Hobbit.\u201d\n\nGeneroso Simeone, head of Italy\u2019s far right Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI),\nspeaks at Camp Hobbit. The MSI was one of the organizers of Camp Hobbit, but\nquickly fell to infighting following a widely successful Camp Hobbit III in\n1981.\n\nHeld in the oppressive heat of July, among the rolling hills of southern\nItaly, Camp Hobbit was equal parts music festival, Tolkien seminar, and\nanarchist commune. \u201cA stage covered with musical instruments and amplifiers, a\ncolorful tent city, stalls selling posters, trinkets, books and t-shirts,\u201d\nrecorded one diarist.\n\nIt was Occupy Wall Street meets the Glastonbury music festival, but the\nspecter of fascism was not far away. \u201cAbout a dozen muscular guys maintaining\norder, distinguished by an armband with a Celtic cross,\u201d the diarist wrote,\nadding, somewhat optimistically, \u201cThe crowd was quite diverse, dominated,\nnaturally, by [fascist haircuts], military clothing, [and] black\nhandkerchiefs, but also some long hair and beards.\u201d\n\nBy bringing together youth from the radical right and left in an orgy of\ncreative activity, organizers had hoped to spawn new Traditionalist\nliterature, cinema, music, and art, and indeed, a few bands formed among the\ntents of Camp Hobbit.\n\nCamp Hobbit included teach-ins, lectures, and live concerts, with the aim of\ninitiating a new cultural movement for the far right.\n\n\u201c[It was] freedom, liberation from old patterns and mental habits,\u201d says Mario\nBartoluzzi, the frontman for Compagnia dell\u2019Anello (\u201cThe Fellowship of the\nRing\u201d), a Traditionalist band founded at Camp Hobbit. \u201cThere was in all of us\nthe desire to get out of the ghetto of exclusion.\u201d\n\nMany attendees saw themselves as transcending the binary of Italian politics\nby fusing Leftist social critiques with the militancy of fascism. Beneath its\nfestive spirit, Camp Hobbit had hoped to \u201crecode\u201d the language of the hippie\nleft with the Traditionalist philosophy of Evola, according to historian of\nfascism Roger Griffin.\n\nCamp Hobbit spawned two successful sequels, drawing several thousand\nattendees. But the coalition emerging from Camp Hobbit quickly fell to\ninfighting. By the mid-\u201980s, the New Right was again on the margins, primarily\nassociated with anti-communist terrorism. Though it experienced moments of\npolitical power, it never succeeded in achieving cultural dominance over its\nenemies on the progressive Left.\n\nCompagnia dell\u2019Anello (\u201cFellowship of the Ring\u201d), a \u201cTraditionalist\u201d band\nformed at Camp Hobbit, plays their first show for campers.\n\nIn recent years, however, the movement has seen somewhat of a resurgence. In\nJuly, members of Italy\u2019s new New Right organized \u201cCampo Hobbit 40,\u201d an attempt\nto resurrect the spirit of the original camp on its fortieth anniversary.\nEvola, too, is enjoying renewed popularity, beloved by adherents of the\nAmerican Alt-Right.\n\nAs for Tolkien, the political meaning of his work is as murky as it ever was.\nDespite a cast of hundreds, Middle Earth remains an empty stage onto which\nideologues of all stripes can project their politics. Even six feature films\nand countless imitators have failed to bring Traditionalist critiques into the\nmainstream.\n\nPerhaps his revolutionary fans should have considered the view of his harshest\ncritic, Michael Moorcock: \u201cIn Tolkien, everyone\u2019s in their place and happy to\nbe there. We go there and back, to where we started. There\u2019s no escape,\nnothing will ever change and nobody will ever break out of this well-ordered\nworld.\u201d So much for revolution.\n\nRead next\n\n### The Mysterious Tree Carvings of America's Basque Sheepherders\n\nArborglyphs document a lonely life out West.\n\ntolkienfascismfeatures\n\nWant to see fewer ads?
