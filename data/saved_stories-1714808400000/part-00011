Instead of\nburning it to recover gold and copper, this new method separates the\ncomponents for reuse.\n\nBy Anthropocene Team\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nLet the best of Anthropocene come to you.\n\nSign up for our free newsletters\n\nInside the phone or computer you are reading this story on is a fiberglass\nboard bearing all the circuit chips, wires and other electronic components\nthat make the device work. And every year, hundreds of thousands of tons of\nthese printed circuit boards (PCBs) get dumped in landfills as electronics\nbecome obsolete.\n\nThere has been a lot of research on finding ways to extract valuable metals\nfrom electronic waste. But recycling the PCBs themselves, which are made of a\ntype of tough plastic, is challenging.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington now report a possible solution.\n\u201cWe have created a new formulation for circuit boards that has performance on\npar with the industry standard material and can be recycled repeatedly without\ndegradation,\u201d says Vikram Iyer, a professor of computer science and\nengineering and co-author of a paper appearing in Nature Sustainability.\n\nPCBs are made of sheets of glass fibers laminated in a epoxy plastic similar\nto the epoxy glues found in hardware store. This composite material gives PCBs\nthe heat and chemical resistance they need for electronics. But the plastic\nand glass are hard to separate so the material is typically burned to recover\nvaluable metals like gold and copper used in electronics. This creates waste\nthat contaminates the air, soil, and water.\n\nAlso, much of the world\u2019s e-waste is sent to poor countries, \u201cwhere people try\nto extract small amounts of valuable minerals from the waste in unsafe\nconditions that release toxic fumes,\u201d Iyer says.\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nEngineers print recyclable electronics using nothing but water\n\nSo he, mechanical engineer Aniruddh Vashisth and their colleagues replaced the\nepoxy in PCBs with a type of plastic known as a vitrimer. \u201cVitrimers flow and\nform new, strong chemical bonds when they are heated past a certain\ntemperature,\u201d he says, \u201callowing them to be recycled over and over, unlike the\nplastic in water bottles that degrade with each recycling cycle.\u201d\n\nTo separate the vitrimer from the glass fibers, the researchers dip the board\nin a solvent and heat it to a mild temperature. The vitrimer softens and\nswells, and the researchers can separate the raw materials and use them to\nmake a new PCB. In experiments, the team was able to reuse 98 percent of the\nvitrimer and 91 percent of the solvent. They were able to recycle the material\nmultiple times without losing its properties.\n\nWhat is most exciting about the approach, Iyer adds, is that the new PCBs give\nperformance comparable to conventional materials, and are compatible with\nstandard processing used to make circuits so the costs of manufacturing PCBs\nshould be similar. While the team has not done a detailed cost analysis, he\nsays, \u201cwe use off-the-shelf chemicals that are produced at industrial scale,\nand the processing steps here are largely the same as industrially produced\nmaterials like epoxy, suggesting it has potential to be cost competitive in\nlarger volumes.\u201d\n\nSource: Zhihan Zhang et al.
