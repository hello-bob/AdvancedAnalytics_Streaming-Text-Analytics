Bryce was a spacecraft engineer at\nLockheed Martin, where he worked on satellites orbiting Jupiter and Mars, and\nthe OSIRUS-REx mission, which returned America\u2019s first asteroid sample in\nOctober 2023. Jason spent five years at Palantir where he led a key team\ndeploying Foundry, giving him perspective on the integration lift and GTM\nmotion Nominal plans to take in the hardware world.

Cameron\nhas known Jason for almost 15 years, since their time at MIT.\n\nIn hardware testing & measurement, there\u2019s little room, if not zero, room for\nerror. The Nominal team is very aware that the systems they build will ensure\nthe reliability of critical technology that lives depend on. All three\nfounders share a deep sense of responsibility to the mission, optimism about\nthe future that advanced hardware can unlock, and pragmatism about the\nchallenges of building it. Modernizing critical infrastructure is an ever-\ngrowing national security imperative, and we are delighted to partner with\nCameron, Bryce, Jason, and the entire Nominal team to help accelerate a\nrenaissance of industrial innovation.\n\n________________\n\n^1.
