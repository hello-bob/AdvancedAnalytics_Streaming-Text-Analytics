Today, we\u2019re announcing passkey support\nfor Microsoft consumer accounts, the next step toward our vision of simple,\nsafe access for everyone.\n\nIn 2015, when we introduced Windows Hello and Windows Hello for Business as\nsecure ways to access Windows 10 without entering a password, our identity\nsystems were detecting around 115 password attacks per second.^1 Less than a\ndecade later, that number has surged 3,378% to more than 4,000 password\nattacks per second.^2 Password attacks are so popular because they still get\nresults. It\u2019s painfully clear that passwords are not sufficient for protecting\nour lives online. No matter how long and complicated you make your password,\nor how often you change it, it still presents a risk.\n\nThe good news is that we\u2019ve made a lot of progress toward making passwords a\nrelic of the past. For a while, you\u2019ve been able to sign in to apps and\nwebsites using FIDO security keys, Windows Hello, or the Microsoft\nAuthenticator app instead of a password. Since September 2021, you\u2019ve not only\nbeen able to sign in to your Microsoft account without a password, but you\u2019ve\nalso been able to delete your password altogether.^3 We\u2019re almost there.\n\nAnd now there\u2019s an even better way to sign in to more places without\npasswords: passkeys.\n\n## The future of signing in\n\nIf you\u2019re like many people, you probably still use passwords to sign in to\nmost of your websites and apps, most likely from multiple devices. This can\ntranslate into hundreds of passwords to remember, unless you use a password\nmanager. With passkeys, instead of creating, managing, remembering, and\nentering passwords, you access your digital accounts the same way you unlock\nyour device\u2014usually with your face, fingerprint, or device PIN. More and more\napps and services are adding support for passkeys; you can already use them to\nsign in to the most popular ones. Passkeys are so much easier and more secure\nthan passwords that we predict passkeys will replace passwords almost entirely\n(and we hope this happens soon).\n\nStarting today, you can use a passkey to access your Microsoft account using\nyour face, fingerprint, or device PIN on Windows, Google, and Apple platforms.\nYour passkey gives you quick and easy access to the Microsoft services you use\nevery day, and it will do a much better job than your password of protecting\nyour account from malicious attacks.\n\n## Easier and more secure than passwords\n\nThink of how many times and places you sign in with a password every single\nday. Is it 10? 50? Not only is this a frustrating experience, it\u2019s also an\nunreliable way to protect a digital account. Here\u2019s why: When you enter a\npassword to sign in to an account, you\u2019re essentially sharing a secret with\nthe website or app to prove that you should have access to the account. The\nproblem is that anyone who gets a hold of this secret can gain access to your\naccount, and if your password gets compromised and appears on the dark web,\nthe repercussions can be serious.\n\nTo make your credentials stronger, an app or website might require you to make\nyour password longer or more complex. But even if you follow all the best\npractices for creating \u201cstrong\u201d passwords, it\u2019s still a trivial exercise for\nhackers to guess, steal, or trick you into revealing them.\n\nWhat is phishing?\n\nLearn more\n\nYou may have experienced an attack yourself\u2014you click on a link in an email\nthat seems legitimate, which leads to a website that looks just like the one\nyou\u2019re used to, asking you to enter your credentials. But when you do, nothing\nhappens, or you get an error message. By the time you notice that the URL in\nyour browser address bar is different from the usual one, it\u2019s too late.\nYou\u2019ve just been phished by a malicious website.\n\nMany app and website providers understand that even complicated passwords\naren\u2019t good enough to protect your account, so they give you the choice to use\ntwo-step or multifactor authentication with approvals and codes sent to your\nphone, email, or an app. While traditional multifactor authentication can help\nprotect your account, it\u2019s not attacker-proof, and it creates another\nfrustrating barrier between you and your content: all these access attempts,\npasswords, and codes on all your devices can really add up.\n\nThis is why we\u2019re so enthusiastic about passkeys.\n\n## How passkeys work\n\nPasskeys work differently than passwords. Instead of a single, vulnerable\nsecret, passkey access uses two unique keys, known as a cryptographic key\npair. One key is stored safely on your device, guarded by your biometrics or\nPIN. The other key stays with the app or website for which you create the\npasskey. You need both parts of the key pair to sign in, just as you need both\nyour key and the bank\u2019s key to get into your safety deposit box.\n\nBecause this key pair combination is unique, your passkey will only work on\nthe website or app you created it for, so you can\u2019t be tricked into signing in\nto a malicious look-alike website. This is why we say that passkeys are\n\u201cphishing-resistant.\u201d\n\nEven better, all the goodness and strength of cryptographic authentication\nstays behind the scenes. All you have to do to sign in is use your device\nunlock gesture: look into your device camera, press your finger on a\nfingerprint reader, or enter your PIN. Neither your biometric information nor\nyour PIN ever leaves your device and they never get shared with the site or\nservice you\u2019re signing in to. Passkeys can also sync between your devices, so\nif you lose or upgrade your device, your passkeys will be ready and waiting\nfor you when you set up your new one.\n\nThe best part about passkeys is that you\u2019ll never need to worry about\ncreating, forgetting, or resetting passwords ever again.\n\n## Creating a passkey for your Microsoft account\n\nCreating a passkey for your Microsoft account is easy. On the device where you\nwant to create the passkey, follow this link, and choose the face,\nfingerprint, PIN, or security key option. Then follow the instructions on your\ndevice.\n\nTo learn more about creating passkeys for your Microsoft account, visit this\nguide.\n\n## Signing into your Microsoft account using a passkey\n\nWhen you sign in to your Microsoft account, you can use your passkey by\nchoosing Sign-in options and then selecting face, fingerprint, PIN, or\nsecurity key. Your device will open a security window, and then you can use\nyour passkey to sign in.\n\nFigure 1. Signing in to your Microsoft account on mobile devices.\n\nToday, you can use a passkey to sign in to Microsoft apps and websites,\nincluding Microsoft 365 and Copilot on desktop and mobile browsers. Support\nfor signing into mobile versions of Microsoft applications using your passkey\nwill follow in the coming weeks.\n\nIf you want to use passkeys to sign in to work-related apps and services, your\nadmin can configure Microsoft Entra ID to accept passkeys hosted on a hardware\nsecurity key or in the Microsoft Authenticator app installed on your mobile\ndevice.\n\nIn this era of AI, there\u2019s unprecedented opportunity for creativity and\nproductivity that empowers every person on the planet\u2014including billions of\nMicrosoft users who access services for work and life every day\u2014to achieve\nmore. Protecting and accessing your digital life doesn\u2019t need to be a hassle,\nand you shouldn\u2019t have to choose between simple access and safe access.\nAccessing your Microsoft account with a passkey lets you put the frustration\nof passwords and codes behind you, so you can focus on being creative and\ngetting things done.\n\nHappy World Password(less) Day!\n\n## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about Microsoft Security solutions, visit our website.
