In Elon Musk\u2019s case, part of\nit involves making workers in China put in hours that would be unacceptable\naccording to labor norms elsewhere.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Tesla boss praised Chinese factory workers for pulling extreme\nhours while taking a shot at American workers. \u201cThere is just a lot of super\ntalented hardworking people in China who strongly believe in manufacturing,\u201d\nthe billionaire said. \u201cThey won\u2019t just be burning the midnight oil, they will\nbe burning the 3am oil, they won\u2019t even leave the factory type of thing,\nwhereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s comment comes as Tesla\u2019s massive Shanghai \u201cGiga-factory\u201d pushes its\nworkers to the limit to meet production targets amid an ongoing pandemic\nlockdown.\n\nIn April, Tesla restricted its Shanghai workers from leaving the factory under\na so-called \u201cclosed-loop\u201d system originally developed by Chinese authorities\nto contain Beijing Olympics participants. While locked inside, the workers\nwere reportedly made to work 12-hour shifts, six days in a row, and to sleep\non factory floors. Production at the plant was forced to halt this week due to\nparts shortages, the company said.\n\nLabor rights and safety violations have been reported at Tesla\u2019s Shanghai\nfactory since it opened in 2018, with some workers making as little as $1,500\na month in what an investigation by local journalists called the \u201cGiga-\nsweatshop.\u201d\n\nEven in the United States, Musk is well known for his disregard for labor\nnorms and work-life balance: the tech billionaire infamously declared \u201cnobody\never changed the world on 40 hours a week\u201d. He has bragged about making\nTesla\u2019s US employees work 100-hour weeks, while claiming to have worked\n120-hour weeks himself. In March, Musk called an all-hands meeting for his\nother company, SpaceX, at 1am.\n\nThese practices are on par with China\u2019s extreme work culture, nicknamed \u201c996\u201d,\nin which workers are expected to work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. The\npractice has been the source of protests in recent years and has been\ncharacterized as a form of modern slavery.\n\nWorkers walk outside the Tesla Giga-factory in Shanghai, China, in November\n2019.

But that\u2019s not what happens in practice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no pretence anywhere that that\u2019s enforced,\u201d said Friedman. \u201cExcessive\novertime is kind of a built-in feature of the whole model of industrial\ndevelopment in China. Very long hours and compulsory overtime, while not\nlegal, are also completely the norm. And this is done regularly in\nconsultation with local governments who are also tasked with enforcing the\nlabor law.\u201d\n\nEmployees in China are often asked to sign a \u201cstriver\u2019s pledge\u201d which waives\ntheir right to overtime pay and paid time off. And while many corporations in\nChina have unions, the unions are funded by the employer, which makes them\nessentially powerless to negotiate against management, Friedman noted.\n\nTesla did not respond to questions about its factory\u2019s work hours and\npolicies.\n\nChina\u2019s gruelling culture of extreme hours has been celebrated by tech\nbillionaires in the country, including Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma, who has called the\n\u201c996\u201d system a \u201chuge blessing\u201d, and rival company JD.com\u2019s Richard Liu, who\nhas called workers who work fewer hours \u201cslackers\u201d.\n\nIn recent years, a growing movement of Chinese workers has stood up to oppose\noverwork, with some activists using tools like GitHub to compile lists of\nChinese companies accused of violating labor laws. Anger over the country\u2019s\nextreme work culture intensified last January after a 22-year-old worker for\nShanghai-based e-commerce firm Pinduoduo collapsed and died after leaving work\nat 1.30am, after a run of brutally long shifts.\n\nIncidents like these helped drive a trend among young Chinese social media\nusers early last year promoting \u201ctang ping\u201d, or \u201clying flat\u201d as a passive\nprotest against work, which has since been restricted on the Chinese internet.\nLater in the year, China\u2019s top court ruled that forced and excessive overtime\nwas illegal, but the ruling has not been well enforced. Work stoppages, often\nunofficial \u201cwildcat\u201d strikes, continue to occur regularly in China.\n\nChinese and American labor norms have clashed in recent years, as bosses pit\nteams against each other.\n\nThe 2019 Netflix documentary \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d described the conflicts that\narose after a Chinese billionaire, Cao Dewang, opened a factory in an\nabandoned General Motors plant in Ohio. \u201cAmerican workers are not efficient,\nand output is low,\u201d Cao complained at one point in the film. \u201cI can\u2019t manage\nthem.\u201d\n\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal revealed that some of the US-based\nemployees at Chinese-owned TikTok were expected to pull back-to-back all-\nnighters and spend as many as 85 hours a week in meetings to keep up with\ntheir Chinese colleagues.\n\nIn the United States, employees covered by the federal Fair Labor Standards\nAct must receive overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. But the\nlaw places no cap on the number of hours an employee can work.\n\nThe grim backdrop to Musk\u2019s comments is that \u201cAmerican workers are in a very\nsubjugated position as well, unfortunately\u201d, said Friedman.\n\n\u201cThe not-at-all subtle threat is that these Chinese workers are a threat to\nyou white American workers. If you don\u2019t meet that standard, then your jobs\nare on the line.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Tesla\n  * China\n  * US work & careers\n  * Work & careers\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Money\n  * Property\n  * Pensions\n  * Savings\n  * Borrowing\n  * Careers\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
