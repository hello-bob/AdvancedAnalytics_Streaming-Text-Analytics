In other words, they're not exactly ideal conditions for\ndriverless vehicles, which already struggle to account for ever-changing built\nenvironments.\n\nAs US-based robotaxi companies have already found out, it's an extremely\ndifficult task \u2014 and that's in a far more predictable environment where cars,\nat least generally speaking, stop at red lights and respect lane markings.\n\nSwaayatt, however, isn't dissuaded. A video shared by the startup last month\nshows its sensor-laden vehicle \"driving through an absolute chaos, on suburban\nunstructured roads in India,\" as the company put it in the caption.\n\n\"This is the most complex that it can get for an autonomous vehicle,\" Swaayatt\nCEO Sanjeev Sharma told IEEE Spectrum. \"If you\u2019re able to build here, this\ntechnology is universal.\"\n\n## Chaos Theory\n\nThe results speak for themselves. The vehicle lurches back and forth, almost\nmimicking the erratic movement of the other cars around it. With its hazard\nlights blinking, the white SUV isn't afraid to veer into the path of oncoming\ntraffic, forcing other drivers to swerve around it.\n\nTo the company, that terrifying behavior is entirely intentional.\n\n\"There were no traffic rules to abide by on this road, other than to perform a\nleft-sided avoidance,\" the company wrote in the caption of its video. \"If the\nother obstacles follow the same, else the vehicle will have to change its plan\nin a stochastic manner, in several of the adversarial multi-agent negotiation\nsettings encountered throughout the autonomous navigation.\"\n\nTo Swaayatt, it's a ruthless environment where every vehicle, driverless or\notherwise, has to fend for itself.\n\n\"It can be seen throughout navigation that the incoming vehicles didn't allow\nany gaps for our autonomous vehicles, forcing it to negotiate passively-\naggressively its own path through the chaos,\" the company wrote.\n\nIn short, is it an impressive feat of engineering \u2014 or a disaster waiting to\nhappen? We'll let you decide.\n\nMore on self-driving: Apple's Failed Car Was a Disaster Behind the Scenes\n\nShare This Article\n\nWaymo Reckless\n\nSelf-Driving Waymo Spotted Plowing Down Wrong Side of Street\n\nApr 26, 10:35 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nTarnished Tesla\n\nFired Tesla Workers Say Elon Musk Is in Big Trouble Without Them\n\nApr 22, 9:45 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nUnprepared for the Worst\n\nThere's Something Very Suspicious About Tesla's Big Robotaxi Announcement\n\nApr 12, 2:31 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nCruise Control\n\nCalifornia Just Yanked Cruise's Robotaxi Permit After a Bizarre Incident\n\n10.24.23, 3:49 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
