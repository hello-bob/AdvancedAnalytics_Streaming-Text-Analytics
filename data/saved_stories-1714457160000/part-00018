Genetic data from the bacteria causing\nthese infections \u2013 think CSI for E. coli \u2013 tells another story: Most health\ncare-associated infections are caused by previously harmless bacteria that\npatients already had on their bodies before they even entered the hospital.\n\nResearch comparing bacteria in the microbiome \u2013 those colonizing our noses,\nskin and other areas of the body \u2013 with the bacteria that cause pneumonia,\ndiarrhea, bloodstream infections and surgical site infections shows that the\nbacteria living innocuously on our own bodies when we\u2019re healthy are most\noften responsible for these bad infections when we\u2019re sick.\n\nOur newly published research in Science Translational Medicine adds to the\ngrowing number of studies supporting this idea. We show that many surgical\nsite infections after spinal surgery are caused by microbes that are already\non the patient\u2019s skin.\n\n## Surgical infections are a persistent problem\n\nAmong the different types of heath care-associated infections, surgical site\ninfections stand out as particularly problematic. A 2013 study found that\nsurgical site infections contribute the most to the annual costs of hospital-\nacquired infections, totaling over 33% of the US$9.8 billion spent annually.\nSurgical site infections are also a significant cause of hospital readmission\nand death after surgery.\n\nIn our work as clinicians at Harborview Medical Center at the University of\nWashington \u2013 yes, the one in Seattle that \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d was supposedly\nbased on \u2013 we\u2019ve seen how hospitals go to extraordinary lengths to prevent\nthese infections. These include sterilizing all surgical equipment, using\nultraviolet light to clean the operating room, following strict protocols for\nsurgical attire and monitoring airflow within the operating room.\n\nHospitals follow strict protocols to prevent infections resulting from\nsurgical procedures.

While rates of many other medical complications\nhave shown steady improvement over time, data from the Agency for Healthcare\nResearch and Quality and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show\nthat the problem of surgical site infection is not getting better.\n\nIn fact, because administering antibiotics during surgery is a cornerstone of\ninfection prevention, the global rise of antibiotic resistance is forecast to\nincrease infection rates following surgery.\n\n## BYOB (Bring your own bacteria)\n\nAs a team of physician-scientists with expertise including critical care,\ninfectious diseases, laboratory medicine, microbiology, pharmacy, orthopedics\nand neurosurgery, we wanted to better understand how and why surgical\ninfections were occurring in our patients despite following recommended\nprotocols to prevent them.\n\nPrior studies on surgical site infection have been limited to a single species\nof bacteria and used older genetic analysis methods. But new technologies have\nopened the door to studying all types of bacteria and testing their antibiotic\nresistance genes simultaneously.\n\nWe focused on infections in spinal surgery for a few reasons. First, similar\nnumbers of women and men undergo spine surgery for various reasons across\ntheir life spans, meaning our results would be applicable to a larger group of\npeople. Second, more health care resources are expended on spinal surgery than\nany other type of surgical procedure in the U.S. Third, infection following\nspine surgery can be particularly devastating for patients because it often\nrequires repeat surgeries and long courses of antibiotics for a chance at a\ncure.\n\nOver a one-year period, we sampled the bacteria living in the nose, skin and\nstool of over 200 patients before surgery. We then followed this group for 90\ndays to compare those samples with any infections that later occurred.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is a common cause of hospital-acquired bacterial\ninfections. CDC/Janice Haney Carr/Jeff Hageman, M.H.S.\n\nOur results revealed that while the species of bacteria living on the back\nskin of patients vary remarkably between people, there are some clear\npatterns. Bacteria colonizing the upper back around the neck and shoulders are\nmore similar to those in the nose; those normally present on the lower back\nare more similar to those in the gut and stool. The relative frequency of\ntheir presence in these skin regions closely mirrors how often they show up in\ninfections after surgery on those same specific regions of the spine.\n\nIn fact, 86% of the bacteria causing infections after spine surgery were\ngenetically matched to bacteria a patient carried before surgery. That number\nis remarkably close to estimates from earlier studies using older genetic\ntechniques focused on Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nNearly 60% of infections were also resistant to the preventive antibiotic\nadministered during surgery, the antiseptic used to clean the skin before\nincision or both. It turns out the source of this antibiotic resistance was\nalso not acquired in the hospital but from microbes the patient had already\nbeen living with unknowingly. They likely acquired these antibiotic-resistant\nmicrobes through prior antibiotic exposure, consumer products or routine\ncommunity contact.\n\n## Preventing surgical infections\n\nAt face value, our results may seem intuitive \u2013 surgical wound infections come\nfrom bacteria that hang out around that part of the body. But this realization\nhas some potentially powerful implications for prevention and care.\n\nIf the most likely source of surgical infection \u2013 the patient\u2019s microbiome \u2013\nis known in advance, this presents medical teams with an opportunity to\nprotect against it prior to a scheduled procedure. Current protocols for\ninfection prevention, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics, follow a\none-size-fits-all model \u2013 for example, the antibiotic cefazolin is used for\nany patient undergoing most procedures \u2013 but personalization could make them\nmore effective.\n\nPersonalizing infection prevention protocols for each patient can help make\nthem more effective.

In the future, clinicians\ncould use information about your microbiome to select more targeted\nantimicrobials. But more research is needed on how to interpret that\ninformation and understand whether such an approach would ultimately lead to\nbetter outcomes.\n\nToday, practice guidelines, commercial product development, hospital protocols\nand accreditation related to infection prevention are often focused on\nsterility of the physical environment. The fact that most infections don\u2019t\nactually start with sources in the hospital is probably a testament to the\nefficacy of these protocols. But we believe that shifting toward more patient-\ncentered, individualized approaches to infection prevention has the potential\nto benefit hospitals and patients alike.\n\n  * Infectious diseases\n  * Surgery\n  * Microbiology\n  * Microbiome\n  * Microbes\n  * Antibiotic resistance\n  * Infection\n  * Hospital infections\n  * New research\n  * Skin microbiome\n  * Multidrug-resistant microbes\n  * STEEHM new research\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Executive Dean, Faculty of Health\n\n  * ##### Regional Engagement Officer - Shepparton\n\n  * ##### Lecturer/Senior Lecturer, Earth System Science (School of Science)\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
