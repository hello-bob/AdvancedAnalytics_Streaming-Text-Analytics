Credit: Feihu Xu, University of Science and Technology of\nChina\n\nResearchers have developed a compact and lightweight single-photon airborne\nlidar system that can acquire high-resolution 3D images with a low-power\nlaser. This advance could make single-photon lidar practical for air and space\napplications such as environmental monitoring, 3D terrain mapping and object\nidentification.\n\nSingle-photon lidar uses single-photon detection techniques to measure the\ntime it takes laser pulses to travel to objects and back. It is particularly\nuseful for airborne applications because it enables highly accurate 3D mapping\nof terrain and objects even in challenging environments such as dense\nvegetation or urban areas.\n\n\"Using single-photon lidar technology on resource-limited drones or satellites\nrequires shrinking the entire system and reducing its energy consumption,\"\nsaid research team member Feihu Xu from University of Science and Technology\nof China.\n\n\"We were able to incorporate recent technology developments into a system\nthat, in comparison to other state-of-the-art airborne lidar systems, employs\nthe lowest laser power and the smallest optical aperture while still\nmaintaining good performance in terms of detection range and imaging\nresolution.\"\n\nThe video shows 3D images acquired using the single-photon airborne lidar\nsystem aboard a small plane. Credit: Feihu Xu, University of Science and\nTechnology of China\n\nIn Optica the researchers show that the system has the capability to achieve\nan imaging resolution that surpasses the diffraction limit of light when used\nwith sub-pixel scanning and a new 3D deconvolution algorithm. They also\ndemonstrate the system's ability to capture high-resolution 3D images during\ndaytime over large areas aboard a small plane.\n\n\"Ultimately, our work has the potential to enhance our understanding of the\nworld around us and contribute to a more sustainable and informed future for\nall,\" said Xu.\n\n\"For example, our system could be deployed on drones or small satellites to\nmonitor changes in forest landscapes, such as deforestation or other impacts\non forest health. It could also be used after earthquakes to generate 3D\nterrain maps that could help assess the extent of damage and guide rescue\nteams, potentially saving lives.\"\n\nThe researchers demonstrated the system's real-world ability by using it\naboard a small plane to capture high-resolution 3D images during daytime over\nlarge areas. Credit: Feihu Xu, University of Science and Technology of China\n\nShrinking single-photon lidar\n\nThe new airborne single-photon lidar system works by sending light pulses from\na laser toward the ground. These pulses bounce off objects and are then\ncaptured by very sensitive detectors called single-photon avalanche diode\n(SPAD) arrays. These detectors provide enhanced sensitivity to single photons,\nenabling more efficient detection of the reflected laser pulses so that a\nlower-power laser could be used. To reduce the overall system size, the\nresearchers used small telescopes with an optical aperture of 47 mm as the\nreceiving optics.\n\nMeasuring the time-of-flight of the returned single photons makes it possible\nto calculate the time it takes for the light to travel to the ground and back.\nThe detailed 3D images of the terrain can then be reconstructed from this\ninformation using computational imaging algorithms.\n\n\"A key part of the new system is the special scanning mirrors that perform\ncontinuous fine scanning, capturing sub-pixel information of the ground\ntargets,\" said Xu. \"Also, a new photon-efficient computational algorithm\nextracts this sub-pixel information from a small number of raw photon\ndetections, enabling the reconstruction of super-resolution 3D images despite\nthe challenges posed by weak signals and strong solar noise.\"\n\n## Ground and air testing\n\nThe researchers conducted a series of tests to validate the capabilities of\nthe new system. A pre-flight ground test confirmed the effectiveness of the\ntechnique and showed that the system was able to perform lidar imaging with a\nresolution of 15 cm from 1.5 km away with default settings. Once they\nimplemented sub-pixel scanning and 3D deconvolution, the researchers were able\nto demonstrate an effective resolution of 6 cm from the same distance away.\n\nThe investigators also conducted daytime experiments with the system aboard a\nsmall airplane over several weeks in Yiwu City, Zhejiang Province, China.\nThese experiments successfully revealed detailed features of various landforms\nand objects, confirming the functionality and reliability of the system in\nreal-world scenarios.\n\nThe team is now working to enhance the performance and integration of the\nsystem, with a long-term goal of installing it on a spaceborne platform such\nas a small satellite. The stability, durability and cost-effectiveness of the\nsystem also needs improving before it could be commercialized.\n\nMore information: Yu Hong et al, Airborne single-photon LiDAR towards small-\nsize and low-power payload, Optica (2024).
