Or follow us on\nGoogle News!\n\nThe Tesla saga is getting weirder by the minute. First we learned the company\nwas terminating 10% (or more) of its global workforce. Then we learned that\nTesla really isn\u2019t a car company at all. Rather it is an AI and autonomous\ndriving company. Next we learned the entire Supercharger team has been\nterminated. Today there are reports the company is pulling way back on its\nplans to use high pressure casting to build its cars after years of telling us\nthe opposite. Three years ago, Tesla had achieved a cult-like status among its\ncustomers. But today? Well, that is the focus of the following disquisition.\n\nIn the 1980s, the CEO of General Motors, Roger Smith, became the reluctant co-\nstar of Michael Moore\u2019s Roger And Me. The film chronicled how Smith closed a\nnumber of GM factories in order to boost the company\u2019s bottom lime but at the\nexpense of many assembly line workers who lost their jobs as a result. Smith\nwas not a lovable man, by most accounts, but he was distressed that no\nAmerican manufacturer could build a quality car at a price most people could\nafford. He was tired of seeing all the Honda Civics and Toyota Corollas on the\nroad but few counterparts from American companies.\n\nOne day, Smith shocked the GM board by announcing the company would create a\nnew division \u2014 Saturn \u2014 and fund it with an initial investment of $5 billion,\nwhich was a lot of money in the mid-80s. The heads of the other GM divisions\nwere less than thrilled by the idea. Chevrolet and Pontiac in particular took\numbrage at the proposal, thinking that every Saturn sold would come at the\nexpense of models in their own product lineup. But Smith was adamant and soon\nconstruction began on a new factory nestled in the rolling foothills near\nSpring Hill, Tennessee.\n\nThe name of the new division was taken from the Saturn V rockets that\npropelled the US space program, not the planet. That\u2019s the reason the name of\nthe new division was written in NASA script and not Times New Roman. A slew of\ntalented engineers from Oldsmobile signed on to the Saturn project and moved\nto Tennessee to be part of it. They invented lost foam casting techniques that\nhad previously been reserved for custom casting jobs. They created a\ntransmission that could be either manual or automatic and built on the same\nassembly line. They devised a way to push concrete through a conventional\npaving machine for the parking lots around the factory.\n\n### Saturn & Innovation\n\nThere were lots of innovations in management at well. The UAW contract was\nonly about twenty pages long. Grievance procedures were streamlined. There was\nno executive dining room \u2014 everyone ate the same food in the same facility \u2014\nand workers were expected to clean and maintain their work area themselves.\nThe assembly line featured a palett system that workers could raise or lower\nto fit their physical attributes. One team of workers traveled the entire\nlength of the factory on one palett to build each car so they could feel like\nthey were part of a team and not just a human cog in a giant machine.\n\nThe sales process was unique in American history. All the showrooms were light\ngray with red accents (a theme later adopted by Toyota) and all the sales\ndesks were open to the showroom. Managers\u2019 offices were all glass. The sales\nstaff was trained to focus on helping customers to make good buying decisions\nbased on their needs. Every new customer was treated to a tour of the service\nfacility, which was calm, organized, and clean.\n\nI myself applied for a sales position, but with great trepidation. \u201cCar\nsalesman\u201d is not a term that generally gets great respect in the community. As\nI sat patiently outside the general manager\u2019s office waiting for my interview,\nsomeone barged in to say a customer was unhappy about something and what\nshould be done? The GM asked one question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the right thing to do for\nthe customer?\u201d After that I no longer feared being a car salesman, so long as\nI could do it a Saturn dealership.\n\nSaturn grew by leaps and bounds. Dealerships had monthly or quarterly rallies\nfor customers with bouncy houses and chili cook-offs. One day my store hired a\nmonster truck to come crush an Oldsmobile. The kids loved it but the Olds\ndealer next door was not amused. Every year, the factory hosted a Homecoming\nevent in Spring Hill and thousands of happy Saturn owners would trek from the\nfar corners of America to attend the festivities.\n\nThe media started referring to Saturn as a cult and they weren\u2019t entirely\nwrong. Saturn people couldn\u2019t stop telling anyone who would listen how happy\nthey were with their cars. All of this is not to say Saturns were perfect.\nThey weren\u2019t. They were built to sell at a certain price point and sell they\ndid. The original car \u2014 the SL sedan \u2014 was deliberately designed to fit female\ncustomers. There was a rumor that \u201cSL\u201d stood for \u201cSaturn for ladies\u201d and that\nsomewhat larger cars more dimensionally suited for men were on the drawing\nboards.\n\nThey never arrived. Roger Smith departed as the head of GM, and the heads of\nChevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick got out the long knives and carved\nany new development funds for Saturn out of the budget. Saturn started selling\nrebadged Chevrolets and Opels. The focus on customer satisfaction withered and\nslowly but surely the brand died. The cult of Saturn was over.\n\n### Is The Cult Of Tesla Next?\n\nGeorge Santayana, whose real name was Jorge Agust\u00edn Nicol\u00e1s Ruiz de Santayana\ny Borr\u00e1s, was a Harvard philosopher who is widely credited with being the\nfirst to say, \u201cThose who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.\u201d Elon\nMusk is an amazing person who has accomplished wonderful things. He did not\ninvent the electric car, but he can rightfully be called the father of the EV\nrevolution. Auto manufacturers all around the globe are pouring hundreds of\nbillions of dollars into establishing battery supply chains and building\nfactories to manufacture electric cars. The Chinese are the clear leaders in\nthe field, but Korean, Japanese, and European car companies are not throwing\nin the towel, at least not yet.\n\nHere\u2019s the point of today\u2019s screed \u2014 What happened to Saturn could happen to\nTesla, and Musk seems completely oblivious to that possibility. Recently he\nsaid Tesla is not a car company. What? All these years it has been laser-\nfocused on the car business and its shareholders have been wowed by visions of\nsugar plums dancing in their heads as they envisioned a company that would\ngrow 50% a year \u2014 because that\u2019s what Musk promised \u2014 and become the largest\ncar company on Earth, cranking out 20 million new electric cars a year at\nfactories all around the globe.\n\nNow suddenly that dream is off the table and we are all supposed to pivot to\nTesla being an AI and robotaxi company? C\u2019mon, Elon. How stupid do you think\nwe are? It seems more and more that Musk is just a huckster not unlike PT\nBarnum, whose mantra was, \u201cThere\u2019s a sucker born every minute.\u201d The evidence\nis mounting that Musk is just another in a long line of tech entrepreneurs\nwhose goal is to get rich quick by moving fast and breaking things. Others of\nthat ilk are Travis Kalanick of Uber fame and Trevor Milton, who once rolled a\nfuel cell-powered Nikola Class 8 truck down an incline to fool people into\nthinking it was operational. To some, Tesla today is little more than a\nclassic Wall Street pump and dump scheme.\n\n### Put A Real Person In Charge Of Tesla\n\nA recent op-ed by Mack Hogan for Inside EVs advocates for putting an adult in\ncharge of the car manufacturing side of Tesla. If Elon wants to pursue AI and\nrobots, fine. Let him do it on his own time and with his own money. \u201cThe only\nperson who consistently gets in Musk\u2019s way is Musk himself,\u201d Hogan writes.\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s quick, gut-driven pivots don\u2019t seem to work out well when the\nbusiness is mature. He\u2019s prodded every dial and button at X \u2014 n\u00e9e Twitter \u2014\nand the result is clear: The website that once defined the online conversation\nis now a cesspool of spam and bigotry. It\u2019s never had a worse relationship\nwith its advertisers. And its CEO has never been so radioactive.\n\n\u201cAnd yet America can\u2019t afford for the same fate to befall Tesla\u2019s auto-making\nefforts. The company is just too important. Very few other automakers right\nnow offer such a compelling slate of EVs backed by Silicon Valley-grade\nsoftware, a dealer-free buyer experience and an internally built, reliable\ncharging network. Tesla is not just important to the EV market; it is\nimportant to the US\u2019 strategic geopolitical position. It is the only large\nscale EV manufacturer in the country that has global relevance, the chops to\ncompete with Chinese EV manufacturers and an existing, satisfied EV customer\nbase.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t need a disruptor in charge. It needs an executive. One who\nexecutes. Someone who can helm a complicated, large organization while\nretaining the institutional knowledge and talent to keep its edge over the\ncompetition. It doesn\u2019t need to solve autonomy to succeed. It does not need\none big swing. It needs a million little decisions, made by a CEO that isn\u2019t\ndistracted by SpaceX, X, Dojo, autonomy, and anger over \u201cthe woke mind virus.\u201d\n\nHogan suggests the company under the guidance or a seasoned professional\nleader (Herbert Diess?) could make cars that people want to buy by redesigning\nthe Model S, switching the Model 3 over to an 800 volt architecture, and\nbuilding out the V4 Supercharger network. \u201cThese projects all surely sound\nboring to Elon Musk. That\u2019s exactly why he shouldn\u2019t be in charge of them.\u201d\nHogan says.\n\n### The Takeaway\n\n40 years ago, Saturn made cars that people wanted to buy and everyone thought\nthe company was here to stay. They were wrong. I did a track day at Watkins\nGlen in a Saturn SC2 coupe many years ago. All weekend long I had strangers\ncoming up to me and gushing about how they loved their Saturns and what great\ncars they were. It is sad to think GM took all that brand equity and tossed it\ninto the trash heap.\n\nThe message here is that there is no guarantee that Tesla will succeed in the\nlong run. History is littered with car companies like Saturn that were once\nflying high but faded into oblivion. Elon clearly has no use for history and\nthinks there is nothing that happened in the past that should impact his\nthinking today. George Santayana would say that is a dangerous mindset for a\nchief executive to have. History may well have the last laugh on Elon.\n\nHave a tip for CleanTechnica? Want to advertise?
