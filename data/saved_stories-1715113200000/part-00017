It\ncontained zero professional IT experience, which is partly why it was so\ngreat. But to really convey the unlikely brilliance of this resume, we have to\nstart at the beginning. The stinky beginning.\n\n###\n\nThe stinky beginning\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, Daniel Singletary was already pretty much fed up with his\njob. As a commercial and residential plumber in metro Atlanta, he pulled\n11-hour days working some of the dirtiest, stinkiest problems in the country.\n\nTake, for example, the day he got a call about an unexplained odor in a\nsuburban shopping strip. Daniel and a coworker headed to the scene. There was\nno mistaking the smell. It was sewage, and it was raw.\n\nOn a reconnaissance trip to the restrooms, Daniel noticed something odd: a\ncurrent of air was flowing around the base of the toilets. When he levered a\ncommode off the floor, he staggered backwards, hit by a blast of noxious wind.\n\"Imagine,\" he wrote later, \"a leaf blower blowing sewer gas in your face.\" Not\nonly is this unusual, it shouldn't even be possible. Sewer pipes don't blow\nair. And yet somehow, this entire shopping strip was passing gas.\n\n###\n\nHow do you troubleshoot a mall?\n\nThere was nothing to do but work the problem step by step. Over the next three\ndays, Daniel and his partner worked over the building from opposite ends,\nunsealing and re-fitting every plumbing fixture they could find. Eventually,\nthey narrowed the source of the mystery airflow down to two possible\nlocations: a hair salon and a restaurant.\n\nThis is where the problem got extra tricky. How do you troubleshoot the\nplumbing in a restaurant without, you know, closing down the restaurant?\nEventually Daniel had a bright idea: a smoke test. Literally. Up to the roof\nvents he went, armed with smoke bombs. His reasoning: \"Wherever sewer odor can\nget in, so can smoke ... except we can see smoke with a flashlight.\"\n\nSure enough, following the clouds of smoke cleared up the mystery. Someone had\ntied the vent hood for the restaurant's stove into the sewer system, forcing\nair into the pipes. The immediate problem might be solved, but Daniel's desire\nto leave plumbing, maybe even to a job where he could choose what to smell,\nwas only growing.\n\n###\n\nThe plumber\u2019s guide to cloud\n\nIt was around this time that Daniel and I met. His roommate, an IT worker, had\nshown him a blog post I wrote about something called the Cloud Resume\nChallenge. The challenge was designed to help people get their first job in\ncloud. It came with a promise: host your resume in the cloud, and I'll do\nwhatever I can to help you get it in front of the right people.\n\nOf course, there were some caveats. Your resume had to have an intro-level AWS\ncertification on it. And the project spec required you to get your hands dirty\nwith source control, CI/CD, Python, front-end Javascript, back-end cloud\nservices, and more - the full cloud stack. Basically, if you could pull off\nthis project, you'd be doing things that even some professional cloud\nengineers have never done.\n\nDaniel wasn't a professional cloud engineer. He'd never even seen YAML before.\nSo he did the first thing that occurred to him: he went out and bought a\nwhiteboard. He called what he drew there to help him make sense of the project\nan \"engineered print,\" just like he'd used countless times as a plumber. He\ndidn't know he was drawing a cloud architecture diagram.\n\nDaniel's whiteboard (courtesy of Daniel Singletary)\n\nOver the weeks that followed, Daniel forced himself to sit down at his\ncomputer after those 11-hour days. He grappled with Python and Javascript in\nthe back of his work truck. One minute he was wrangling sewer pipelines - the\nnext minute, CI/CD pipelines.\n\nLet's not ask what's on his shirt. (Courtesy of Daniel Singletary)\n\nFinally, miraculously, he completed the challenge. I reviewed his code myself;\nit was solid. And you can check out his resume page for yourself. It's not\nflashy, but it contains probably the greatest combination of credentials I've\never seen. Daniel is licensed in backflow prevention, journeyman plumbing,\nresidential / commercial septic installation ... and oh yeah, he's earned four\ncertifications on AWS.\n\nOne of the most important requirements of the challenge is to write a blog\npost about your learnings. Daniel's post, A Plumber's Guide to Cloud, went\nviral on LinkedIn and was shared more than 200,000 times. That got the\nattention of hiring managers.\n\nAnd barely a month later, he started his first tech job as a cloud DevOps\nengineer. From all reports, he's killing it.\n\n###\n\nWhat really made the resume great\n\nNow, to be clear, Daniel's success didn't come from some magic contained in\nthe Cloud Resume Challenge. It came from Daniel. It came from his hard work,\nhis perseverance, and (just as importantly) from the skills he'd mastered in\nhis plumbing days.\n\nFor instance, if I'm a hiring manager on an infrastructure ops team, I'm\ntaking away quite a few things from Daniel's story of the leaf-blower sewer:\n\nHe knows how to troubleshoot. Given a fairly enormous problem (this entire\nbuilding stinks), Daniel didn't flail around or try random stopgap measures.\nHe narrowed the problem down to a root cause (the blowing air) and then\nmethodically eliminated possibilities until he found the solution.\n\nHe knows how to collaborate. Daniel worked closely with a colleague throughout\nthe onsite engagement, dividing and conquering to speed up the \"debugging\"\nprocess. Pair programming will feel natural to Daniel because he's used to\nhaving a sounding board to work out complex problems.\n\nHe knows how to test and observe. Until I met Daniel, I actually didn't know\nthat \"smoke testing\" was a term with a literal smoke-related meaning. I'd\nalways heard it used in the context of software tests. Daniel used a tracing\ntechnique to follow a problem to its source, instead of just making random\nguesses.\n\nHe understands business continuity. Daniel had to keep several businesses\nonline and operational while conducting his diagnostics and resolving the\nproblem. He couldn't simply flip a switch and cut the building's water supply\nfor a few days while he figured out what was happening.\n\nPut simply, Daniel had rock-solid real-world ops skills, better than that of\nmost university computer science graduates I've met. What the Cloud Resume\nChallenge did was fast-track Daniel to the hands-on technical abilities he\nneeded to build on that wealth of trade experience and vault into the cloud.\n\n###\n\nWhat\u2019s your superpower?\n\nDaniel's story is unique, but he's not alone. In the past 16 months, thousands\nof people have attempted the Cloud Resume Challenge. The majority of them\ndon't get far; it's not easy, that's what makes it worth doing.\n\nBut those who persevere have seen incredible results. Career-changers have\nmade the jump to cloud jobs from fields as diverse as food service, HR,\nretail, and recruiting. And even more people have used the challenge to polish\nup their existing IT skills and leverage better jobs within the industry.\n\nYou'll hear many of their stories in the book. Like them, you bring skills and\nperspectives that the tech industry needs. Daniel\u2019s resume is still the\ngreatest I\u2019ve seen - but I hold out hope that someday, it\u2019ll be dethroned by\nan even more amazing story. Will that story be yours?\n\n##\n\nLinks and Events\n\nI just heard from a couple of folks the other day who got job offers through\nthe \u201cBest Jobs in Cloud\u201d newsletter, which makes me super happy. If you are\nhiring for an awesome cloud role, I would love to feature your job in the next\nedition - particularly if it is a junior- to mid-level role. You can submit\njob postings here.\n\nI am starting to get into Google Cloud a little bit, and the first thing my\nAWS-scarred brain noticed was just how intuitive and non-footgunny the project\nand identity setup is. I wrote up a Twitter thread on this that inspired a lot\nof discussion.\n\nFinally, my recent post on why every engineer should do a stint in consulting\nfound its way to the top of Hacker News, and you can read all the comments if\nyou dare.\n\n##\n\nJust for fun\n\nForrest Brazeal @forrestbrazeal\n\nYou can take the people out of the data center, but how do you take the data\ncenter out of the people?\n\n11:02 PM \u2219 Sep 23, 2021\n\n350Likes61Retweets\n\n### Subscribe to Good Tech Things\n\nBy Forrest Brazeal \u00b7 Launched 5 years ago\n\nCloud and tech commentary from Forrest Brazeal\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The greatest resume I've ever seen\n\nnewsletter.goodtechthings.com\n\n2\n\nShare\n\n2 Comments\n\nuser20211010Oct 10, 2021In France, every recruiter would've told him \"You're\nchallenge-driven, determined and atypical.
