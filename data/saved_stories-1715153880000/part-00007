This array would give a strong field underneath,\nwhile the field above would cancel.\n\nA Halbach array (German: [\u02c8halbax]) is a special arrangement of permanent\nmagnets that augments the magnetic field on one side of the array while\ncancelling the field to near zero on the other side.^[1]^[2] This is achieved\nby having a spatially rotating pattern of magnetisation.\n\nThe rotating pattern of permanent magnets (on the front face; on the left, up,\nright, down) can be continued indefinitely and have the same effect. The\neffect of this arrangement is roughly similar to many horseshoe magnets placed\nadjacent to each other, with similar poles touching.\n\nThis magnetic orientation process replicates that applied by a magnetic\nrecording tape head to the magnetic tape coating during the recording process.\nThe principle was further described by James (Jim) M. Winey of Magnepan in\n1970, for the ideal case of continuously rotating magnetization, induced by a\none-sided stripe-shaped coil.^[3]\n\nThe effect was also discovered by John C. Mallinson in 1973, and these \"one-\nsided flux\" structures were initially described by him as a \"curiosity\",\nalthough at the time he recognized from this discovery the potential for\nsignificant improvements in magnetic tape technology.^[4]\n\nPhysicist Klaus Halbach, while at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\nduring the 1980s, independently invented the Halbach array to focus particle\naccelerator beams.^[5]\n\n## Linear arrays[edit]\n\nOrientation of strong and weak sides in a linear Halbach array\n\n### Magnetization[edit]\n\nCancellation of magnetic components resulting in a one-sided flux\n\nAlthough this magnetic flux distribution seems somewhat counter-intuitive to\nthose familiar with simple bar magnets or solenoids, the reason for this flux\ndistribution can be intuitively visualised using Mallinson's original diagram\n(note that it uses the negative y component, unlike the diagram in Mallinson's\narticle). The diagram shows the field from a strip of ferromagnetic material\nwith alternating magnetization in the y direction (top left) and in the x\ndirection (top right). Note that the field above the plane is in the same\ndirection for both structures, but the field below the plane is in opposite\ndirections. The effect of superimposing both of these structures is shown in\nthe figure.\n\nThe crucial point is that the flux will cancel below the plane and reinforce\nitself above the plane. In fact, any magnetization pattern where the\ncomponents of magnetization are out of phase with each other will result in a\none-sided flux. The mathematical transform that shifts the phase of all\ncomponents of some function by is called a Hilbert transform; the components\nof the magnetization vector can therefore be any Hilbert-transform pair (the\nsimplest of which is simply , as shown in the diagram above).\n\nThe magnetic field around an infinite Halbach array of cube magnets. The field\ndoes not cancel perfectly due to the discrete magnets used.\n\nThe field on the non-cancelling side of the ideal, continuously varying,\ninfinite array is of the form^[6]\n\nwhere\n\n    is the field in the form ,\n    is the magnitude of the field at the surface of the array,\n    is the wavenumber (i.e., the spatial frequency)\n\n### Applications[edit]\n\nThe advantages of one-sided flux distributions are twofold:\n\n  * The field is twice as large on the side on which the flux is confined (in the idealized case).\n  * There is no stray field produced (in the ideal case) on the opposite side. This helps with field confinement, usually a problem in the design of magnetic structures.\n\nThus they have a surprising number of applications, ranging from flat\nrefrigerator magnets through industrial applications such as the brushless DC\nmotor, voice coils,^[7] magnetic drug targeting^[8] to high-tech applications\nsuch as wiggler magnets used in particle accelerators and free-electron\nlasers.\n\nThe Inductrack Maglev train^[9] and Inductrack rocket-launch system^[10]\nutilize the Halbach array to lift the train by repelling loops of wire in the\ntrack.\n\nMagnetic viewing film showing a flat refrigerator magnet's magnetization\n\nFlat flexible (not hard ceramic ferrite) refrigerator magnets are created with\na Halbach magnetization pattern for a stronger holding force when attached to\na flat ferromagnetic surface (e.g. a fridge door) than the holding force from\na uniform magnetization. They're made from powdered ferrite mixed in a\nflexible binder (e.g. plastic or rubber) that is exposed to a Halbach\nmagnetization field pattern as it is extruded, permanently giving the ferrite\nparticles in the magnetic compound this one-sided flux distribution (which can\nbe viewed with magnetic viewing film).\n\nFlux distribution for a flat refrigerator magnetSchematic diagram of a free-\nelectron laser\n\nScaling up this design and adding a top sheet gives a wiggler magnet, used in\nsynchrotrons and free-electron lasers. Wiggler magnets wiggle, or oscillate,\nan electron beam perpendicular to the magnetic field. As the electrons are\nundergoing acceleration, they radiate electromagnetic energy in their flight\ndirection, and as they interact with the light already emitted, photons along\nits line are emitted in phase, resulting in a \"laser-like\" monochromatic and\ncoherent beam.\n\nThe design shown above is usually known as a Halbach wiggler. The\nmagnetization vectors in the magnetized sheets rotate in the opposite senses\nto each other; above, the top sheet's magnetization vector rotates clockwise,\nand the bottom sheet's magnetization vector rotates counter-clockwise. This\ndesign is chosen so that the x components of the magnetic fields from the\nsheets cancel, and the y components reinforce, so that the field is given by\n\nwhere k is the wavenumber of the magnetic sheet given by the spacing between\nmagnetic blocks with the same magnetization vector.\n\n### Variable linear arrays[edit]\n\nSchematic of a Halbach array consisting of a series magnetized rodsEqual-\ngearing arrangement for a variable Halbach array\n\nA series of magnetic rods, magnetized perpendicular to their axes, can be\narranged into a Halbach array. If each rod is then rotated alternately through\n90\u00b0, the resultant field moves from one side of plane of the rods to the\nother, as shown schematically in the figure.\n\nThis arrangement allows the field to effectively be turned on and off above or\nbelow the plane of the rods, depending on the rotation of the rods. Such a\ndevice makes an efficient mechanical magnetic latch requiring no power. A\ndetailed study of this arrangement has shown that each rod is subject to a\nstrong torque from its neighboring rods, and therefore requires mechanical\nstabilization.^[11] However, a simple and efficient solution, providing both\nstabilization and the ability to rotate each rod alternately, is simply to\nprovide an equal-gearing arrangement on each rod, as shown in the figure.\n\n## Cylinder[edit]\n\nA ferromagnetic cylinder showing various magnetization patterns and magnetic\nfieldCylinder magnetization\n\nA Halbach cylinder is a magnetized cylinder composed of ferromagnetic material\nproducing (in the idealized case) an intense magnetic field confined entirely\nwithin the cylinder, with zero field outside. The cylinders can also be\nmagnetized such that the magnetic field is entirely outside the cylinder, with\nzero field inside. Several magnetization distributions are shown in the\nfigures.\n\nThe direction of magnetization within the ferromagnetic material, in plane\nperpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, is given by\n\nwhere M_r is the ferromagnetic remanence (A/m). A positive value of k \u2212 1\ngives an internal magnetic field, and a negative one gives an external\nmagnetic field.\n\nIdeally, these structures would be created from an infinite-length cylinder of\nmagnetic material with the direction of magnetization continuously varying.\nThe magnetic flux produced by this ideal design would be perfectly uniform and\nbe entirely confined to either the bore of the cylinder or the outside of the\ncylinder. Of course, the ideal case of infinite length is not realizable, and\nin practice the finite length of the cylinders produces end effects, which\nintroduce non-uniformities in the field.^[12]^[13] The difficulty of\nmanufacturing a cylinder with a continuously varying magnetization also\nusually leads to the design being broken into segments.\n\n### Applications[edit]\n\nThese cylindrical structures are used in devices such as brushless AC motors,\nmagnetic couplings and high-field cylinders. Both brushless motors and\ncoupling devices use multipole field arrangements:\n\n  * Brushless motors or alternators typically use cylindrical designs in which all the flux is confined to the centre of the bore (such as k = 4 above, a 6-pole rotor) with the AC coils also contained within the bore. Such self-shielding motor or alternator designs are more efficient and produce higher torque or output than conventional motor or alternator designs.\n  * Magnetic-coupling devices transmit torque through magnetically transparent barriers (that is, the barrier is non-magnetic or is magnetic but not affected by an applied magnetic field), for instance, between sealed containers or pressurised vessels. The optimal torque couplings consists of a pair of coaxially nested cylinders with opposite +k and \u2212k flux magnetization patterns, as this configuration is the only system for infinitely long cylinders that produces a torque.^[14] In the lowest-energy state, the outer flux of the inner cylinder exactly matches the internal flux of the outer cylinder. Rotating one cylinder relative to the other from this state results in a restoring torque.\n\n### Uniform fields[edit]\n\nUniform field inside Halbach cylinder\n\nFor the special case of k = 2, the field inside the bore is uniform and is\ngiven by\n\nwhere the inner and outer cylinder radii are R_i and R_o respectively. H is in\nthe y direction. This is the simplest form of the Halbach cylinder, and it can\nbe seen that if the ratio of outer to inner radii is greater than e, the flux\ninside the bore actually exceeds the remanence of the magnetic material used\nto create the cylinder. However, care has to be taken not to produce a field\nthat exceeds the coercivity of the permanent magnets used, as this can result\nin demagnetization of the cylinder and the production of a much lower field\nthan intended.^[15]^[16]\n\nThree designs (A) (B) (C) producing uniform magnetic fields within their\ncentral air gap\n\nThis cylindrical design is only one class of designs that produce a uniform\nfield inside a cavity within an array of permanent magnets. Other classes of\ndesign include wedge designs, proposed by Abele and Jensen, in which wedges of\nmagnetized material are arranged to provide uniform field within cavities\ninside the design as shown.\n\nThe direction of magnetization of the wedges in (A) can be calculated using a\nset of rules given by Abele and allows for great freedom in the shape of the\ncavity. Another class of design is the magnetic mangle (B), proposed by Coey\nand Cugat,^[17]^[18] in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that\ntheir magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod\ndesign. This design greatly increases access to the region of uniform field,\nat the expense of the volume of uniform field being smaller than in the\ncylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the\nnumber of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in\nmany possibilities, including a dynamically variable field and various dipolar\nconfigurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are\nclosely related to the k = 2 Halbach cylinder. Other very simple designs for a\nuniform field include separated magnets with soft iron return paths, as shown\nin figure (C).\n\nIn recent years, these Halbach dipoles have been used to conduct low-field NMR\nexperiments.^[19] Compared to commercially available (Bruker Minispec)\nstandard plate geometries (C) of permanent magnets, they, as explained above,\noffer a huge bore diameter, while still having a reasonably homogeneous field.\n\n#### Derivation in the ideal case[edit]\n\nThe method used to find the field created by the cylinder is mathematically\nvery similar to that used to investigate a uniformly magnetised sphere.^[20]\n\nBecause of the symmetry of the arrangement along the cylinder's axis, the\nproblem can be treated as two-dimensional. Work in plane-polar coordinates\nwith associated unit vectors and , and let the cylinder have radial extent .\nThen the magnetisation in the cylinder walls, which has magnitude , rotates\nsmoothly as\n\nwhile the magnetisation vanishes outside the walls, that is for the bore and\nsurroundings .\n\nBy definition, the auxiliary magnetic field strength is related to the\nmagnetisation and magnetic flux density by . Using Gauss' law , this is\nequivalently\n\n    (1)  \n---  \n  \nSince the problem is static there are no free currents and all time\nderivatives vanish, so Amp\u00e8re's law additionally requires , where is the\nmagnetic scalar potential (up to a sign under some definitions). Substituting\nthis back into the previous Equation 1 governing and , we find that we need to\nsolve\n\n    (2)  \n---  \n  \nwhich has the form of Poisson's equation.\n\nConsider now the boundary conditions at the cylinder-air interfaces and .\nIntegrating over a small loop straddling the boundary and applying Stokes'\ntheorem requires that the parallel component of is continuous. This in turn\nrequires that is continuous across the boundary. (More properly this implies\nthat must differ by a constant across the boundary, but since the physical\nquantities we are interested in depend on gradients of this potential, we can\narbitrarily set the constant to zero for convenience.) To obtain a second set\nof conditions, integrate Equation 1 across a small volume straddling the\nboundary and apply the divergence theorem to find\n\nwhere the notation denotes a jump in the quantity across the boundary, and in\nour case the sign is negative at and positive at . The sign difference is due\nto the relative orientation of the magnetisation and the surface normal to the\npart of the integration volume inside the cylinder walls being opposite at the\ninner and outer boundaries.\n\nIn plane-polar coordinates, the divergence of a vector field is given by\n\n    (3)  \n---  \n  \nSimilarly, the gradient of a scalar field is given by\n\n    (4)  \n---  \n  \nCombining these two relations, the Laplacian becomes\n\n    (5)  \n---  \n  \nUsing Equation 3, the magnetisation divergence in the cylinder walls is\n\nHence Equation 2, which is that we want to solve, becomes by using Equation 5\n\n    (6)  \n---  \n  \nLook for a particular solution of this equation in the cylinder walls. With\nthe benefit of hindsight, consider , because then we have\n\nand also\n\nHence , and comparison with Equation 6 shows that is the appropriate\nparticular solution.\n\nNow consider the homogeneous equation for Equation 6, namely . This has the\nform of Laplace's equation. Through the method of separation of variables, it\ncan be shown that the general homogeneous solution whose gradient is periodic\nin (such that all the physical quantities are single-valued) is given by\n\nwhere the are arbitrary constants. The desired solution will be the sum of the\nparticular and homogeneous solutions that satisfies the boundary conditions.\nAgain with the benefit of hindsight, let us set most of the constants to zero\nimmediately and assert that the solution is\n\nwhere now are constants to be determined. If we can choose the constants such\nthat the boundary conditions are satisfied, then by the uniqueness theorem for\nPoisson's equation, we must have found the solution.\n\nThe continuity conditions give\n\n    (7)  \n---  \n  \nat the inner boundary and\n\n    (8)  \n---  \n  \nat the outer boundary. The potential gradient has non-vanishing radial\ncomponent in the cylinder walls and in the bore, and so the conditions on the\npotential derivative become\n\nat the inner boundary and\n\nat the outer boundary. Note that these are identical to Equations 7 and 8, so\nindeed the guess was consistent. Hence we have and , giving the solution\n\nConsequently, the magnetic field is given by\n\nwhile the magnetic flux density can then be found everywhere using the\nprevious definition . In the bore, where the magnetisation vanishes, this\nreduces to . Hence the magnitude of the flux density there is\n\nwhich is independent of position. Similarly, outside the cylinder the\nmagnetisation also vanishes, and since the magnetic field vanishes there, the\nflux density does too. So indeed the field is uniform inside and zero outside\nthe ideal Halbach cylinder, with a magnitude depending on its physical\ndimensions.\n\n### Varying the field[edit]\n\nHalbach cylinders give a static field. However, cylinders can be nested, and\nby rotating one cylinder relative to the other, cancellation of the field and\nadjustment of the direction can be achieved.^[21] As the outside field of a\ncylinder is quite low, the relative rotation does not require strong forces.\nIn the ideal case of infinitely long cylinders, no force would be required to\nrotate a cylinder with respect to the other.\n\nMagnetic levitation using a planar Halbach array and concentric structure\nwindings\n\n## Sphere[edit]\n\nIf the two-dimensional magnetic distribution patterns of the Halbach cylinder\nare extended to three dimensions, the result is the Halbach sphere. These\ndesigns have an extremely uniform field within the interior of the design, as\nthey are not affected by the \"end effects\" prevalent in the finite-length\ncylinder design. The magnitude of the uniform field for a sphere also\nincreases to 4/3 the amount for the ideal cylindrical design with the same\ninner and outer radii. However, for a spherical struction, access to the\nregion of uniform field is usually restricted to a narrow hole at the top and\nbottom of the design.\n\nThe equation for the field in a Halbach sphere is^[22]\n\nHigher fields are possible by optimising the spherical design to take account\nof the fact that it is composed of point dipoles (and not line dipoles). This\nresults in the stretching of the sphere to an elliptical shape and having a\nnon-uniform distribution of magnetization over the component parts. Using this\nmethod, as well as soft pole pieces within the design, 4.5 T in a working\nvolume of 20 mm^3 was achieved by Bloch et al. in 1998,^[23] and this was\nincreased further to 5 T in 2002,^[24] although over a smaller working volume\nof 0.05 mm^3. As hard materials are temperature-dependent, refrigeration of\nthe entire magnet array can increase the field within the working area\nfurther, as shown by Kumada et al. This group also reported development of a\n5.16 T Halbach dipole cylinder in 2003.^[25]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Neodymium magnet\n  * Permanent magnet\n  * Strong focusing\n  * Inductrack uses Halbach arrays to generate strong fields for maglev trains\n  * Helmholtz coil can give very even magnetic fields\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Klaus Halbach (1980). \"Design of permanent multipole magnets with oriented rare earth cobalt material\" (PDF).
