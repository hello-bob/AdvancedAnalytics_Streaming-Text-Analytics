The\ndeclining number of active players means the game\u2019s content is no longer\naccessible in the way it used to be, and the experience of it is different\nfrom what was originally intended. In light of this, we\u2019ve made the difficult\ndecision to terminate the live service of ArcheAge in Europe and North\nAmerica.\n\nWe understand this news is disappointing, for it\u2019s a feeling we share.\nArcheAge has been a big part of our lives, and we know many of you have a\nhistory with the game many times longer than ours. As we approach the end of\nthis journey, we invite you to join us as we ride into the sunset:\n\nRoadmap:\n\n  * Game Access: ArcheAge servers will remain live until 08:00 UTC on June 27, 2024.\n  * Customer Support: Our support team will be available until September 27 to assist with any inquiries or concerns.\n\nWe want to extend our deepest gratitude to every member of Nuia, Haranya, and\nthe Pirates who called ArcheAge home. Your spirit and stories will forever be\na part of the legacy we created together. Though our paths may diverge, the\nmemories we made will always remain.\n\nFor ongoing updates, please keep an eye on our official channels. We are\ncommitted to providing a transparent and supportive service until the very\nlast moment.\n\nThank you for everything,\n\nArcheAge Team\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Can I get a refund?\n\nIn accordance with Clause 7 of our Terms of Use, unused Credits and purchased\nweb packages are not eligible for refund.\n\nIf you have made your purchase through Steam, please reach out to Steam\u2019s\nCustomer Support, as we are not able to process refunds for purchases made\nthrough Steam. Steam\u2019s refund policies may differ from those of Kakao Games.\n\nAny Patron time and Tactful Life buff time remaining after April 25, 2024,\nwill automatically be exchanged to Credits at the following ratio:\n\n  * 1 Day Patron: 50 Credits\n  * 1 Day Tactful Life: 41 Credits\n\nWhile normal refund policies apply, we recognize that this is an exceptional\ncircumstance, and we will refund any purchase made within the last 14 days\nbefore this announcement, provided the purchased product has not been claimed\nfrom the Web Inventory.\n\nPlease Note: Credits provided in exchange for Patron time or Tactful Life buff\ntime do not count as reclaimable for credit purchase refunds.\n\n### How long will Credits be available for?\n\nPurchasing Credits will no longer be possible as of this announcement.\nExisting Credits you have in your account\u2019s balance will remain available\nuntil the end of the service.\n\n### What happens to the Marketplace?\n\nThe in-game Marketplace will remain available until the end of the service,\nalong with all your yet unused Credits.\n\n### What\u2019s going to happen to my account?\n\nYour personal information stored in the ArcheAge database will be permanently\ndeleted within two weeks of service termination, but your Kakao Games platform\naccount will remain accessible as usual.\n\nIf you wish to delete your Kakao Games account, for the purpose of clearing\nyour online footprint or otherwise, please visit your Account page and refer\nto the \u201cDelete my account\u201d segment at the bottom of the \u201cMY INFORMATION\u201d tab.\n\nTransferring your in-game data to a different region is not possible.\n\n### Can I play in a different region?\n\nLike Kakao Games Europe, publishers of ArcheAge in other regions have also\nimplemented IP blocks based on their respective licensing agreements. If you\neventually find yourself part of a different publisher\u2019s Territory of Service,\nyou are more than welcome to play. Keep in mind that your EUNA in-game data\nwill not be available in other regions, and you will have to start with a\nfresh account.\n\n### Can I get stuff for free?\n\nWe will not be providing items on an individual basis, but we are preparing\nthe equipment giveaway event and progress support event. We hope to make great\nmemories in ArcheAge during the rest of the service. You can find the event\ndetails here.\n\n### Will there be any more updates to the game?\n\nThe April 25 patch is the last content update that will be added to the EU/NA\nversion of ArcheAge. In case a critical issue occurs, additional hotfix\npatches will be prepared to ensure the game is in a working state.\n\n### What will happen to the ArcheAge Partners Program and Discord?\n\nWe will no longer accept new applicants to join the ArcheAge Partners program\nfrom April 25, 2024. The existing Partners and Creators can continue to enjoy\nbenefits of the program until June 27, 2024 in which the program will be\ndiscontinued. Additionally, the ArcheAge official Discord will remain open\nuntil June 27, 2024.\n\nNEWS SHARE facebook twitter copy\n\nCopied\n\nNEWSPREV GO NEWSLIST GO NEWSNEXT GO\n\n## SERVICE INFORMATION\n\n  * ABOUT US\n  * TERM OF USE\n  * PRIVACY POLICY\n  * FAN KIT\n  * COOKIE POLICY\n\nFollow us\n\n  * twitter\n\nLanguage Selection Box ENGLISH\n\n  * English\n  * Deutsch\n  * Fran\u00e7ais\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Kakao Games Europe B.V. \u00a9 XLGAMES Inc.
