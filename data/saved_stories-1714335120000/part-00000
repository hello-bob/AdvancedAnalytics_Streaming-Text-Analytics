With code sent in today via\nx86/urgent ahead of tonight's Linux 6.9-rc6 release, that accidental default\nbreakage is being addressed.\n\nA patch to be merged today to Linux Git will re-enable CPU security\nmitigations by default for non-x86 architectures like POWER and Arm.\n\nSean Christopherson of Google explained in the patch fixing the issue:\n\n> \"Rename x86's to CPU_MITIGATIONS, define it in generic code, and force it on\n> for all architectures exception x86. A recent commit to turn mitigations off\n> by default if SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS=n kinda sorta missed that\n> \"cpu_mitigations\" is completely generic, whereas SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS is\n> x86 specific.\n>\n> Rename x86's SPECULATIVE_MITIGATIONS instead of keeping both and have it\n> select CPU_MITIGATIONS, as having two configs for the same thing is\n> unnecessary and confusing. This will also allow x86 to use the knob to\n> manage mitigations that aren't strictly related to speculative execution.\n>\n> Use another Kconfig to communicate to common code that CPU_MITIGATIONS is\n> already defined instead of having x86's menu depend on the common\n> CPU_MITIGATIONS. This allows keeping a single point of contact for all of\n> x86's mitigations, and it's not clear that other architectures *want* to\n> allow disabling mitigations at compile-time.\"\n\nThat patch is part of today's x86 fixes pull request. There's another patch to\nalso now ignore the \"mitigations=\" kernel boot parameter if the kernel is\nconfigured with CPU_MITIGATIONS=n to already have mitigations disabled.\n\nToday's x86 fixes pull also carries the patch further extending the range of\nAMD Zen 5 processor models.\n\nAdd A Comment\n\nTweet\n\nRelated News\n\nLinux BHI Mitigation Being Tweaked Following 12% Database Performance Hit\n\nLinux 6.9-rc4 To Bring New Fixes For x86 Speculation Mitigations\n\nLinux Kernel Patched For Branch History Injection \"BHI\" Intel CPU\nVulnerability\n\nGitHub Disables The XZ Repository Following Today's Malicious Disclosure\n\nXZ Struck By Malicious Code That Could Allow Unauthorized Remote System Access\n\nLinux 6.9 Sees Further Security Hardening\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
