Five years ago, he made the\ndecision to join a virtual marketplace called Abalobi, which enables fishers\nsuch as him to sell their catch directly to restaurants, retailers and\nconsumers using a custom-built app.\n\n\u201cI get a better price and I can sell more species now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve bought\na 60-horsepower motor that I\u2019d never have been able to afford before. I\u2019ve\nbought a second boat.\u201d He joined, he says, because he didn\u2019t want to spend all\nday walking around town in the sun trying to sell fish. \u201cMy quality of life\nhas improved. I\u2019ve even been able to help some old people in the community.\u201d\n\nAbalobi (which means fisher in isiXhosa, one of the official languages of\nSouth Africa) is a tech nonprofit that works to help the small-scale fishers\nwho make up the bulk of the South African fishing industry but are\ntraditionally excluded from it financially.\n\nPoggenpoel says using Abalobi has improved his quality of life. Photograph:\nAbalobi\n\nThere are three apps at the heart of the platform. The Fishers\u2019 app, the one\nPoggenpoel uses, allows fishers to upload details of their daily catch to a\ndatabase. The Marketplace app then shows restaurants, hotels and customers at\nhome what is available, and allows them to buy fresh, fully traceable line-\ncaught fish direct from the people who caught it. The Monitor app takes the\ndata fed in by the fishers and allows scientists to better manage fisheries\nand fish populations.\n\n> Our starting point is not the chef or the plate, it is finding ways to build\n> trust with these fishers who have so much knowledge\n\nSerge Raemaekers, Abalobi co-founder\n\n\u201cWe buy around 100kg of fish every week via Abalobi,\u201d says Kerry Kilpin, the\nexecutive chef of two restaurants at Steenberg wine farm in Cape Town. \u201cIt\u2019s\nno more expensive than other suppliers and it\u2019s much fresher.\u201d\n\nThe fish, which is put on ice the moment it is caught, is taken from the boats\nto a central distribution centre where it is cleaned, packaged and delivered\nto customers within 24 hours. Purchases can be made in the app, and fishers\nreceive payment within 48 hours.\n\nCape Town is surrounded by ocean, but Norwegian salmon and Mozambican prawns\nstill feature on many restaurant menus. The app has enabled Kilpin to change\nwhat she offers to customers.\n\n\u201cWe use Cape bream a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cIt used to be something nobody wanted. A\nfisherman\u2019s fish that was sold in bunches at very low prices. But it\u2019s an\namazing fish, very versatile, small, delicate and with a pleasing flavour.\u201d\n\nA typical small-scale fishing boat off the southern coast of South Africa.\nPhotograph: Abalobi\n\nPoggenpoel used to have to traipse around Lambert\u2019s Bay flogging Cape bream at\nbargain prices. Now it\u2019s his bread and butter. Abalobi\u2019s focus on the species\nhas also provided work for local women, who have been trained to prepare Cape\nbream (and other fish).\n\n\u201cI used to work on a potato farm, in the wind and the rain,\u201d says Amelia\nShoshola. \u201cBut this is much better. On a good day I can earn 300 rand (\u00a313)\nfor a few hours\u2019 work.\u201d\n\nBecause Cape bream can only be targeted by line-fishers, it remains plentiful.\n\nAbalobi now works with more than 1,600 fishers in communities around the South\nAfrican coastline, and its technology is used by partner organisations in 12\nother countries, including Chile, Madagascar, Croatia and Ireland.\n\nIt was co-founded in 2015 by Serge Raemaekers, a fisheries researcher then\nbased at the University of Cape Town. He worked in partnership with Abongile\nNgqongwa, a fisheries manager, and Nico Waldeck, a fisher turned community\nactivist from Lambert\u2019s Bay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always been involved in politics,\u201d says Waldeck. \u201cBut when apartheid\nended, I realised I didn\u2019t care about politics, I cared about communities. And\nmy community was a fishing community.\u201d\n\nThe first iteration of Abalobi was all about data collection, with Waldeck\npersuading fishers that it was in their interests to record \u2013 on smartphones\nprovided by the platform \u2013 every fish they caught. Fishers could use the data\nto apply for bank loans, he says, or renew fishing permits.\n\n\u201cOur starting point is not the chef or the plate,\u201d says Raemaekers. \u201cIt is\nfinding ways to build trust with these fishermen and women who have so much\nknowledge and information and data in their heads.\u201d\n\nThe Weskusmandjie \u2013 a collective of women from the small fishing hamlet of\nSteenberg\u2019s Cove near Lambert\u2019s Bay \u2013 holding bokkoms (dried Southern mullet).\nPhotograph: Abalobi\n\nIn 2018 he began to use that data to create the real-time marketplace.\n\nKilpin was the first chef to buy fish through Abalobi \u2013 7kg of Cape bream\ncaught in Lambert\u2019s Bay. Within two years, Abalobi was selling to 350\nrestaurants in the Cape. The Covid pandemic halted that expansion, but it also\nmeant that Abalobi opened up the marketplace to retailers and consumers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a case of buying sustainable seafood that has some sort of blue or\ngreen tick in a way that works in formalised fisheries like the EU,\u201d says\nRaemaekers. \u201cTransposing that idea to the global south has a whole lot of\nunintended consequences about social justice. What\u2019s better is supporting a\nbroken segment of our society like the South African fishing community.\u201d\n\nTryn, one of two restaurants on Steenberg farm, serves up Cape bream.

Photograph: Claire\nGunn/Steenberg Farm\n\nWaldeck is now working on a system that will allow the community to benefit\nfurther by keeping some of the caught fish for itself.\n\nHook to plate: how blockchain tech could turn the tide for sustainable fishing\n\nRead more\n\n\u201c[With Abalobi] we get a better price for the fishers, which is great,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cBut that same fish is of important nutritional value to Lambert\u2019s Bay.\u201d\n\nHe has spent the past year piloting a food security project that sees the\nplatform buy some of the fishers\u2019 catch \u2013 and pay the women to clean and\nfreeze it \u2013 before selling it back to the community at low prices. \u201cAt the\nmoment we\u2019re [partially] subsidising it. But once we\u2019ve come up with a system\nthat can break even, we\u2019ll roll it out at other sites.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Poggenpoel has more immediate ambitions. \u201cI want to find a skipper\nand a crew for my second boat and put it on the Abalobi system,\u201d he says. \u201cI\nwant to grow. That\u2019s my whole motivation.\u201d\n\nRaemaekers has similarly impressive plans. \u201cThis started out as a citizen\nscience project,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it has become so much more. It has the\npotential to redefine the way we all interact with the sea.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Fishing\n  * On our plate\n  * Fishing industry\n  * South Africa\n  * Conservation\n  * Marine life\n  * Food\n  * Wildlife\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
