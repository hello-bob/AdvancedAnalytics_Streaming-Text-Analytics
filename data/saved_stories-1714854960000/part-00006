Described in Ruffolo, Nayfach, Gallagher, and Bhatnagar et\nal., 2024.  \n  \n## FAQs\n\nWhat is OpenCRISPR-1? OpenCRISPR-1 is an AI-created gene editor, consisting of\na Cas9-like protein and guide RNA, fully developed using Profluent\u2019s large\nlanguage models (LLMs). The OpenCRISPR-1 protein maintains the prototypical\narchitecture of a Type II Cas9 nuclease but is hundreds of mutations away from\nSpCas9 or any other known natural CRISPR-associated protein. You can view\nOpenCRISPR-1 as a drop-in replacement for many protocols that need a cas9-like\nprotein with an NGG PAM and you can even use it with canonical SpCas9 gRNAs.\nOpenCRISPR-1 can be fused in a deactivated or nickase format for next\ngeneration gene editing techniques like base, prime, or epigenome editing.\nFind out more in our preprint.\n\nWhy are you releasing OpenCRISPR free of charge \u2013 what\u2019s the catch? There is\nno catch. OpenCRISPR is free for commercial use to any users who take a\nlicense. In a world where gene editing technologies can be difficult to access\nfor both researchers and patients for various reasons, we felt the need to put\nour company mission into action and release some of the byproducts of our\nprolific protein design engine to enable more discoveries in the gene editing\nindustry. For partners where further customization and expanded features for\nOpenCRISPR or another system might be desired, we offer a high-touch\ncollaboration model.\n\nAre you really not asking for anything? In addition to abiding by our terms of\nuse, we kindly ask that you allow us to acknowledge you as a user and to let\nus know when any products using OpenCRISPR advance to the clinic or commercial\nstages.\n\nHave you filed IP on OpenCRISPR? Yes.\n\nIf OpenCRISPR is truly open source, then why do I need to sign a license\nagreement? The sequence is freely available via the pre-print. We considered\nmany factors to make accessing OpenCRISPR as frictionless and lightweight as\npossible; chief among these was ensuring its ethical and safe use. For this\nreason, if OpenCRISPR users wish to use the molecule for commercial\ntherapeutic uses, we require them to execute a simple license agreement that\nincludes obligations to use the tool for ethical purposes only, in addition to\nother terms of use.\n\nWhat does the license include? The current release includes the protein\nsequence of OpenCRISPR-1 along with a compatible AI-generated gRNA, though it\nis also compatible with canonical Cas9 gRNAs.\n\nWill there be additional OpenCRISPR releases in the future? Stay tuned...\n\nDo you provide protocols? Please see our pre-print in bioRxiv for a general\nprotocol in addition to a readme protocol that accompanies the sequence\nrelease. Other general protocols for editing enzymes should also be\ncompatible.\n\nIs there a way to share my experience using OpenCRISPR with Profluent? We\nexpressly welcome any feedback on OpenCRISPR and especially sharing of any\nobservations as you\u2019re using the system. If you find that certain attributes\ncould be changed or improved for your particular needs, please reach out!\n\nOpenCRISPR is interesting, but I have more needs; what does Profluent offer?\nWe are open to collaboratively iterate and customize an AI-designed solution\nthat is a perfect match for your specific therapeutic application. This ranges\nfrom customized gene editors, antibodies, and broader enzymes. Please email\npartnerships@profluent.bio.\n\n## License\n\nOpenCRISPR is free and public for your research and commercial usage. To\nensure the ethical and safe commercial use, we have a simple license agreement\nthat includes obligations to use the tool for ethical purposes only, in\naddition to other terms.
