accepted Elon Musk\u2019s offer\nto acquire the company at $54.20/share.\n\nAs an ex-director for civic integrity at Twitter, I\u2019ve watched what Musk has\ndone since then.\n\nAnd today is my last post on this platform.\n\nI\u2019m leaving. \ud83e\uddf5>>> ^\n\n2/ TL;DR: After watching and tweeting dramatically less for the past two\nyears, I\u2019ve decided that (for me) even passive participation on this platform\namounts to complicity in Elon Musk\u2019s project of promoting anti-democratic\nvalues.\n\nI will not have any part in that. ^\n\n3/ Musk is a poster child for divisive racist, sexist, and plutocratic\ntendencies that undermine democracy\u2019s commitment to equality for all.\n\nNo amount of hand-waving can hide what Musk is doing.\n\nDestroying Twitter\u2019s value is the tell: It\u2019s not about the money.\n\nIt\u2019s worse. ^\n\n4/ Musk\u2019s willingness to burn down what he purchased suggests that he\u2019s\nmotivated by a perverse righteousness, not profit.\n\nI won\u2019t repeat the litany of mistakes demonstrating Musk\u2019s failure to be a\nresponsible steward for this platform, nor the mountains of data that prove\nit. ^\n\n5/ From all angles \u2014 be it growth, revenue, brand equity, advertising,\ncredibility as a global news source, trust & safety, or hell, even simply as\n*entertainment* \u2014 Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter has been a stunning crash & burn\nstory.\n\nActually, a better word would be \u201ctantrum.\u201d ^\n\n6/ The \u201cfree speech/content moderation\u201d issue is cynical redirection.\n\nAs an ex-Dir of Product Mgmt at Twitter, I care about mitigating harm\nassociated with speech.\n\nAs a long-time student of political philosophy, I also care about the value of\nfree speech.\n\nMusk fails at both. ^\n\n7/ I cringe every time journalists and others refer to Musk as a \u201cfree speech\nabsolutist.\u201d Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe only absolute is Musk\u2019s hypocrisy, as he repeatedly contradicts his so-\ncalled principles to serve himself and his pet causes. ^\n\n8/ When Musk talks about protecting \u201cfree speech\u201d he really means supporting\nprovocative and/or violent voices \u2014 and *esp* trolls who hate the idea that\nall people are equal.\n\nConversely, Musk is quick to *stifle* speech if it embarrasses him or his\ncompanies.\n\nHe\u2019s a hypocrite. ^\n\n9/ When one of the richest men in the world uses his own private global media\nplatform to selectively amplify anti-democratic voices, and to prey on those\nhe does not like, that is not \u201cfree speech.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s personal psychological weakness, enabled by systemic plutocracy. ^\n\n10/ Musk also demonstrates an utter lack of understanding about how a global\nplatform for interactive communication requires a thoughtful, judicious\nbusiness strategy unlike any other product.\n\nMusk has done precisely the *opposite* of what leadership requires. ^\n\n11/ Musk is a textbook example of the schmucks who believe that any problem\ncan be solved with more tech, lower costs, more automation, better code, more\n\u201chardcore\u201d engineers & the right investors \u2014 as if Twitter\u2019s challenges are\nsimply *business* challenges.\n\nBut they are not. ^\n\n12/ Musk utterly failed to understand that Twitter\u2019s hardest challenges are\nnot about more revenue & fewer rules.\n\nThey are *human* challenges, about power, speech, competition, fairness,\ndiversity, wealth, poverty, war, peace, safety, inclusion, equity, and\nprivacy. ^\n\n13/ A wiser person would understand that...\n\n\\- a global platform like this cannot deepen and reify the worst excesses and\ninequalities of capitalism, privilege, and power;\n\n\\- nor carry water for bad actors;\n\n\\- nor incentivize and monetize the ugliest, most cruel human behaviors. ^\n\n14/ Furthermore, ownership of a platform like this cannot be online therapy\nand acting-out to soothe the grievances of insecure, immature, thin-skinned\nbillionaires (yes, note the plural) who desperately want & need to be liked\n(because they are psychologically damaged). ^\n\n15/ Like Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch, and too many other wealthy & powerful\nmen, Elon Musk is a toxic mix of narcissism, insecurity, sexism, and a\nparticularly cruel form of unkindness that seems especially gleeful about\npunching down on those with less power. ^\n\n16/ It would be bad enough if Musk\u2019s immaturity and lack of self-control\nsimply made him an insufferable asshole.\n\nBut Musk is an insufferable asshole with a global media platform that he has\nre-made in furtherance of pernicious values.\n\nThat\u2019s why I cannot be here any longer. ^\n\n17/ This isn\u2019t a story about \u201cfree speech\u201d v. \u201ccensorship.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a story about who gets to wield the power of speech \u2014 & a cautionary tale\nof how massive private wealth enables an immature man[child] to selectively\nelevate those who reject democracy\u2019s bedrock value:\n\nEquality. ^\n\n18/ Musk has clearly signaled whose messages he believes deserve his personal\nsupport and amplification:\n\n-Right-wing stooges for Putin;\n\n-Antisemites spouting \u201creplacement theory;\u201d\n\n-Racists who question Black professional skills;\n\n-Anti-LGBTQ trolls\n\nThe list goes on. ^\n\n19/ If Musk were to edit George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d he might say:\n\n\u201cAll voices are equal, but some voices are more equal than others.\u201d ^\n\n20/ I cannot sign off without also feeling sadness for the company that\nTwitter used to be, and which Musk destroyed.\n\nThe bird was not \u201cfreed\u201d \u2014 Musk killed it.\n\nHistory will show this to be true.\n\nI see no way this empty husk of a once-great platform for news will survive. ^\n\n21/ I can also say w/ confidence that my fellow Tweeps were some of the\nsmartest, most thoughtful, earnest, and humane professional colleagues that\nI\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of working with. \ud83e\udee1\n\nAnd there is a silver lining: Many have carried those qualities to new\nemployers. ^\n\n22/ I continue to participate in the ongoing public dialogue about democracy,\nelections, voting, tech, security and information integrity.\n\nI\u2019m now at:\n\nContact me for professional opportunities.\n\nAlso:\n\neddie1perez@mastodon.sociallinkedIn.com/in/eddie1perez eddie1perez.bsky.social\n^\n\nhttp://linkedIn.com/in/eddie1perez\n\nEdward Perez (@eddie1perez.bsky.social) Democracy.

This\ndistillation can offer benefits, such as quicker decisionmaking, but is often\ninaccurate and overlooks the complexities of the problem.\u201d\n\nAnd more: \u201cBy extension, it is worth questioning whether the platform back-\nends, machine-learning algorithms, social listening tools, and media literacy\ncampaigns we have built have perhaps lent a skewed or insufficient paradigm.\u201d\n\nRead 8 tweets\n\n#### Edward Perez\n\n@eddie1perez\n\nNov 10, 2022\n\n1/ For media & voters: During the post-election counting cycle, there's\nmis/disinformation swirling about on so-called \"spikes\" in vote counts, which\nsome think is a reflection of \"dumping\" fake ballots.\n\nThis is wrong. It's an artifact of voting tech.\n\nA \ud83e\uddf5to explain. Plz RT.\ud83d\udc47\n\n2/ Modern voting tech can contribute to the appearance of sudden \u201cspikes\u201d in\nballot counts.\n\nBallot scanning systems typically allow election officials to scan and store\ncast vote record data for thousands of mail ballots before actually tabulating\nthe results on Election Night.\n\n3/ For example, states may spend *weeks* pre-processing and scanning thousands\nof ballots, day after day, and the cast vote record data is \u201cheld\u201d or stored\non a memory card until Election Night.\n\nRead 10 tweets\n\n#### Edward Perez\n\n@eddie1perez\n\nNov 9, 2022\n\nSo many changes in the Twitter app, I can't keep up with updates.\n\np.s. Hey Elon, this image is a joke. It's supposed to be funny, ok? You said\ncomedy is allowed, and comedy is even better with disclaimers, cuz lawyers and\nfree speech and all.\n\nNot real. I'm glad you love jokes!\n\nOn a serious note, yes, this is my way of poking fun at the sloppy and\nunprofessional way that the impt issue of verification has (not) been managed.\n\nSpeaking as an elections expert and a product manager, this is no way to\nlaunch a product that is *essential* to trust & safety.\n\nMinding the guardrails: help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-p...\n\nRead 5 tweets\n\n#### Edward Perez\n\n@eddie1perez\n\nNov 8, 2022\n\nAs we get into the post-election ballot counting period, @OSET is focusing on\ntwo topics that have garnered a disproportionate share of wild accusations and\ndisinformation: 1) by-mail ballot security; 2) the time required to count and\nreport.\n\n\u201cExplainers\u201d for each are below. \ud83e\uddf5\n\nHere\u2019s the first Explainer, which provides details about all of the security\nprotocols around by-mail voting.\n\nThe process is rigorous, and well-understood, and no, there are no \u201cballot\ndumps\u201c in the middle of the night. \ud83d\udc47 bit.ly/OSET_ByMailBal...\n\nHere\u2019s the second Explainer, which provides all of the sober facts about why\nit takes time to count by mail ballots.

They are human\nbeings. Even spaceflight in the U.S. has suffered due to human error and\nunanticipated challenges. Elections are no different.\n\nA short \ud83e\uddf5\n\n2/ Especially given how election administrators and poll workers are reeling\ndue to process changes since 2020 \u2014 including security changes in the face of\nintimidation and threats \u2014 it\u2019s important to assess the difference between\nhonest mistakes and malfeasance.\n\n3/ Recognize that when mistakes occur, and when shortcomings in election\nadministration become apparent, bad actors will try to add fuel to the fire by\ndistorting the facts.\n\nDon\u2019t let them.\n\nSlow down and seek context before drawing conclusions or retweeting.\n#TrustedInfo2022\n\nRead 4 tweets\n\n#### Edward Perez\n\n@eddie1perez\n\nNov 6, 2022\n\nPlease come follow me on Mastodon.
