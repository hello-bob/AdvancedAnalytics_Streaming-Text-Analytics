Battered and worn, the twin\nspacecraft are speeding along through the void, far outside the Sun\u2019s\ninfluence now, their radioactive fuel decaying, their signals becoming ever\nfainter as the time needed to cross the chasm of space gets longer by the day.\n\nBut still, they soldier on, humanity\u2019s furthest-flung outposts and testaments\nto the power of good engineering. And no small measure of good luck, too,\ngiven the number of nearly mission-ending events which have accumulated in\nalmost half a century of travel. The number of \u201cglitches\u201d and \u201canomalies\u201d\nsuffered by both Voyagers seems to be on the uptick, too, contributing to the\nsense that someday, soon perhaps, we\u2019ll hear no more from them.\n\nThat day has thankfully not come yet, in no small part due to the computers\nthat the Voyager spacecraft were, in a way, designed around. Voyager was to be\na mission unlike any ever undertaken, a Grand Tour of the outer planets that\noffered a once-in-a-lifetime chance to push science far out into the solar\nsystem. Getting the computers right was absolutely essential to delivering on\nthat promise, a task made all the more challenging by the conditions under\nwhich they\u2019d be required to operate, the complexity of the spacecraft they\u2019d\nbe running, and the torrent of data streaming through them. Forty-six years\nlater, it\u2019s safe to say that the designers nailed it, and it\u2019s worth taking a\nlook at how they pulled it off.\n\n## Volatile (Institutional) Memory\n\nThat turns out that getting to the heart of the Voyager computers, in terms of\nschematics and other technical documentation, wasn\u2019t that easy. For a project\nwith such an incredible scope and which had an outsized impact on our\nunderstanding of the outer planets and our place in the galaxy, the dearth of\ntechnical information about Voyager is hard to get your head around. Most of\nthe easily accessible information is pretty high-level stuff; the juicy\ntechnical details are much harder to come by. This is doubly so for the\ncomputers running Voyager, many of the details of which seem to be getting\nlost in the sands of time.\n\nAs a case in point, I\u2019ll offer an anecdote. As I was doing research for this\nstory, I was looking for anything that would describe the architecture of the\nFlight Data System, one of the three computers aboard each spacecraft and the\nmachine that has been the focus of the recent glitch and recovery effort\naboard Voyager 1. I kept coming across a reference to a paper with a most\npromising title: \u201cDesign of a CMOS Processor for use in the Flight Data\nSubsystem of a Deep Space Probe.\u201d I searched high and low for this paper\nonline, but it appears not to be available anywhere but in a special\ncollection in the library of Witchita State University, where it\u2019s in the\npersonal papers of a former professor who did some work for NASA.\n\nUnfortunately, thanks to ongoing construction, the library has no access to\nthe document right now. The difficulty I had in rounding up this potentially\ncritical document seems to indicate a loss of institutional knowledge of the\nVoyager program\u2019s history and its technical origins. That became apparent when\nI reached out to public affairs at Jet Propulsion Lab, where the Voyagers were\nbuilt, in the hope that they might have a copy of that paper in their\narchives. Sadly, they don\u2019t, and engineers on the Voyager team haven\u2019t even\nheard of the paper. In fact, they\u2019re very keen to see a copy if I ever get a\nhold of it, presumably to aid their job of keeping the spacecraft going.\n\nIn the absence of detailed technical documents, the original question remains:\nHow do the computers of Voyager work? I\u2019ll do the best I can to answer that\nfrom the existing documentation, and hopefully fill in the blanks later with\nany other documents I can scrape up.\n\n## Good Old TTL\n\nAs mentioned above, each Voyager contains three different computers, each of\nwhich is assigned different functions. Voyager was the first unmanned mission\nto include distributed computing, partly because the sheer number of tasks to\nbe executed with precision during the high-stakes planetary fly-bys would\nexceed the capabilities of any single computer that could be made flyable.\nThere was a social engineering angle to this as well, in that it kept the\nvarious engineering teams from competing for resources from a single computer.\n\nRedundancy galore: block diagram for the Command Computer Subsystem (CCS) used\non the Viking orbiters. The Voyager CCS is almost identical. Source: NASA/JPL.\n\nTo the extent that any one computer in a tightly integrated distributed system\nsuch as the one on Voyager can be considered the \u201cmain computer,\u201d the Computer\nand Command Subsystem (CCS) would be it. The Voyager CCS was almost identical\nto another JPL-built machine, the Viking orbiter CCS. The Viking mission,\nwhich put two landers on Mars in the summer of 1976, was vastly more\ncomplicated than any previous unmanned mission that JPL had built spacecraft\nfor, most of which used simple sequencers rather than programmable computers.\n\nOn Voyager, the CCS is responsible for receiving commands from the ground and\npassing them on to the other computers that run the spacecraft itself and the\nscientific instruments. The CCS was built with autonomy and reliability in\nmind, since after just a few days in space, the communication delay would make\ndirect ground control impossible. This led JPL to make everything about the\nCCS dual-redundant \u2014 two separate power supplies, two processors, two output\nunits, and two complete sets of command buffers. Additionally, each processor\ncould be cross-connected to each output unit, and interrupts were distributed\nto both processors.\n\nThere are no microprocessors in the CCS. Rather, the processors are built from\ndiscrete 7400-series TTL chips. The machine does not have an operating system\nbut rather runs bare-metal instructions. Both data and instruction words are\n18 bits wide, with the instruction words having a 6-bit opcode and a 12-bit\naddress. The 64 instructions contain the usual tools for moving data in and\nout of registers and doing basic arithmetic, although there are only commands\nfor adding and subtracting, not for multiplication or division. The processors\naccess 4 kilowords of redundant plated-wire memory, which is similar to\nmagnetic core memory in that it records bits as magnetic domains, but with an\niron-nickel alloy plated onto the surface of wires rather than ferrite beads.\n\n## The Three-Axis Problem\n\nOn Voyager, the CCS does almost nothing in terms of flying the spacecraft. The\ntasks involved in keeping Voyager pointed in the right direction are farmed\nout to the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem, or AACS. Earlier\ninterplanetary probes such as Pioneer were spin-stabilized, meaning they\nmaintained their orientation gyroscopically by rotating the craft around the\nlongitudinal axis. Spin stabilization wouldn\u2019t work for Voyager, since a lot\nof the science planned for the mission, especially the photographic studies,\nrequired a stable platform. This meant that three-axis stabilization was\nrequired, and the AACS was designed to accommodate that need.\n\nVoyager\u2019s many long booms complicate attitude control by adding a lot of\n\u201cwobble\u201d.\n\nThe physical design of Voyager injected some extra complexity into attitude\ncontrol. While previous deep-space vehicles had been fairly compact, Voyager\nbristles with long booms. Sprouting from the compact bus located behind its\nhuge high-gain antenna are booms for the three radioisotope thermoelectric\ngenerators that power the spacecraft, a very long boom for the magnetometers,\na shorter boom carrying the heavy imaging instruments, and a pair of very long\nantennae for the Plasma Wave Subsystem experiment. All these booms tend to\nwobble a bit when the thrusters fire or actuators move, complicating the\ncalculations needed to stay on course.\n\nThe AACS is responsible for running the gyros, thrusters, attitude sensors,\nand actuators needed to keep Voyager oriented in space. Like the CCS, the AACS\nhas a redundant design using TTL-based processors and 18-bit words. The same\n4k of redundant plated-wire memory was used, and many instructions were shared\nbetween the two computers. To handle three-axis attitude control in a more\nmemory-efficient manner, the AACS uses index registers to point to the same\nblock of code multiple times.\n\n## Years of Boredom, Minutes of Terror\n\nRounding out the computers of Voyager is the Flight Data Subsystem or FDS, the\nculprit in the latest \u201cglitch\u201d on Voyager 1, which was traced to a corrupted\nmemory location and nearly ended the extended interstellar mission. Compared\nwith the Viking-descended CCS and AACS, the FDS was to be a completely new\nkind of computer, custom-made for the demands of a torrent of data from eleven\nscientific experiments and hundreds of engineering sensors during the high-\nintensity periods of planetary flybys, while not being overbuilt for the long,\nboring cruises between the planets.\n\nThe FDS was designed strictly to handle the data to and from the eleven\nseparate scientific instruments on Voyager, as well as the engineering data\nfrom dozens of sensors installed around the spacecraft. The need for a\ndedicated data computer was apparent early on in the Voyager design process,\nwhen it became clear that the torrent of data streaming from the scientific\nplatforms during flybys would outstrip the capabilities of any of the hard-\nwired data management systems used in previous deep space probes.\n\nOne of the eight cards comprising the Voyager FDS. Covered with discrete CMOS\nchips, this card bears the \u201cMJS77\u201d designation; \u201cMariner Jupiter Saturn 1977\u201d\nwas the original name of the Voyager mission. Note the D-sub connectors for\ninter-card connections. Source: NASA/JPL.\n\nIt was evident early in the Voyager design process that data-handling\nrequirements would outstrip the capabilities of any of the hard-wired data\nmanagement systems used in previous deep space probes. This led to an initial\nFDS design using the same general architecture as the CCS and AACS \u2014 dual TTL\nprocessors, 18-bit word width, and the same redundant 4k of plated-wire\nmemory. But when the instruction time of a breadboard version of this machine\nwas measured, it turned out to be about half the speed necessary to support\npeak flyby data throughput.\n\nVoyager FDS. Source: National Air and Space Museum.\n\nTo double the speed, direct memory access circuits were added. This allowed\ndata to move in and out of memory without having to go through the processor\nfirst. Further performance gains were made by switching the processor design\nto CMOS chips, a risky move in the early 1970s. Upping the stakes was the\ndecision to move away from the reliable plated-wire memory to CMOS memory,\nwhich could be accessed much faster.\n\nThe speed gains came at a price, though: volatility. Unlike plated-wire\nmemory, CMOS memory chips lose their data if the power is lost, meaning a\nsimple power blip could potentially erase the FDS memory at the worst possible\ntime. JPL engineers worked around this with brutal simplicity \u2014 rather than\npower the FDS memories from the main spacecraft power systems, they ran\ndedicated power lines directly back to the radioisotope thermoelectric\ngenerators (RTG) powering the craft. This means the only way to disrupt power\nto the CMOS memories would be a catastrophic loss of all three RTGs, in which\ncase the mission would be over anyway.\n\nPhysically, the FDS was quite compact, especially for a computer built of\ndiscrete chips in the early 1970s. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to find many high-\nresolution photos of the flight hardware, but the machine appears to be built\nfrom eight separate cards that are attached to a card cage. Each card has a\nrow of D-sub connectors along the top edge, which appear to be used for card-\nto-card connections in lieu of a backplane. A series of circular MIL-STD\nconnectors provide connection to the spacecraft\u2019s scientific instruments,\npower bus, communications, and the Data Storage Subsystem (DSS), the digital\n8-track tape recorder used to buffer data during flybys.\n\n## Next Time?\n\nEven with the relative lack of information on Voyager\u2019s computers, there\u2019s\nstill a lot of territory to cover, including some of the interesting software\narchitecture techniques used, and the details of how new software is uploaded\nto spacecraft that are currently almost a full light-day distant. And that\u2019s\nnot to mention the juicy technical details likely to be contained in a paper\nhidden away in some dusty box in a Kansas library. Here\u2019s hoping that I can\nget my hands on that document and follow up with more details of the Voyager\ncomputers.\n\nPosted in History, Interest, Original Art, Space\n\n## 43 thoughts on \u201cThe Computers Of Voyager\u201d\n\n  1. Pat says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 7:24 am\n\nThe risk in using CMOS memory was well-founded, as it turns out. As far as I\nknow, the CCS/AACS have been happily running for nearly 50 years without a\nhiccup, whereas *both* Voyagers have lost portions of the FDS in the same\ntimeframe. And in fact, V2\u2019s memory failure happened less than *1 week* before\nthe Uranus encounter and the fix was only deployed __4 days__ before closest\napproach. V1 at this point has less than half its originally installed FDS\nmemory working.\n\nGreat job, even if it\u2019s unsuccessful, following up on the FDS design document.\nI similarly knew it existed but never went far enough down the rabbit hole to\ntry to contact anyone. The other bit of information that\u2019s currently publicly\nunobtainable is the actual FDS (and possibly CCS/AACS, not sure) software \u2013\npeople have tried to request that but it\u2019s only available via internal JPL\naccess and not publicly available.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

I will not provide any\ndetails about how I would approach the problem (I do not want to give bad\npeople good ideas), but my current thinking on a solution would be nearly\nimpossible to do in my self imposed time frame even just 5 years ago.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1.

There are\nprobably regions of the world where that kind of documentation is terrible,\nbut not everywhere.\n\nIn fact, in general, electronics documentation from the 60s-90s or so was\nactually fairly insanely good. For Voyager, it\u2019s just a case of these things\nbeing one-offs (well, \u2018few-offs\u2019 but you get the idea).

Many things published in magazines, newspapers, and even\nresearch from before are lost, sometimes they exist as scans but they can\u2019t be\naccessed through text search, and finding them requires going to physical\nplaces.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    3. Joshua says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 12:11 pm\n\nUm, here in Germany, at least, we still have copies/reprints of crystal radio\nbooks from the 1920s or so.\n\nBut I suppose it depends on point of view, though.\n\nAbout every nation has copies of national/international documents (books,\nschematics, news papers) on microfilms. These are usually being stored in old\nbunkers, in mountains, mines and other distant places.\n\nThe space thing is a bit special, also. Back in the 1960s/1970s amateur\nsatellites and space probes were being built in a garage, so to say.\n\nThe people working on those projects took their documents home, whereas they\nended up in the attic, the garage etc.\n\nThe story of OSCAR-1 or AO-7 was a bit similar, I think. The documents about\nthe satellites weren\u2019t being located at AMSAT HQ, but privately at home of the\nsatellites\u2019 own creators.\n\nBut that\u2019s understandable, I think, considering that these early Oscars and\nand Voyagers were pioneers in their field.\n\nPeople involved back then couldn\u2019t know how historical important their\ncreations might be.\n\nIf they knew, they surely would have properly documented things and had made\nmultiple copies, too.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  3.

WSU lists \u201cDesign of a CMOS\nProcessor for use in the Flight Data Subsystem of a Deep Space Probe.\u201d as part\nof Dr. James E. Tomayko\u2019s collection of NASA documents \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t\nexplicitly list him as author.\n\nAnd there\u2019s good reason to think he\u2019s not. NASA itself hosts a single paper by\nDr. Tomayko, Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience at\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19880069935.\n\nThis paper references the above CMOS paper in it\u2019s source notes:\n\n40\\. Interview with John Wooddell, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, May 21 1984. ...\n42 . Interview with Don Johnson, Jet Propulsion laboratory , May 16 1984;\nUndated at the time, [John] Wooddell thinks he wrote the \u201cDesign of a CMOS\nProcessor for Use in the Flight Data Subsystem of a Deep Space Probe\u201d in 1974,\nwhich makes sense as the development process lasted from 1972 to 1974.\n\n43\\.

How much longer will\nthe fuel last? How often do the thrusters fire?\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  11. John Vaccaro says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 12:06 pm\n\nExcellent sleuthing and write up. You\u2019re spot on about losing legacy knowledge\nabout Voyager and other systems. I had hoped that NASA was doing a better job\nthese days, but given the effort and dearth of details around the James Webb\u2019s\nFDS, I am not hopeful. Looking forward to any additional you uncover and\npublish.\n\nBTW: I have heard the name FORTH mentioned in conjunction with Voyager\u2019s\ncomputers, but never found any documentation to confirm it. >JjV<\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  12. prpplague says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 12:30 pm\n\n\u201cI kept coming across a reference to a paper with a most promising title:\n\u201cDesign of a CMOS Processor for use in the Flight Data Subsystem of a Deep\nSpace Probe.\u201d \u201d i\u2019ve been searching for a number of documents related to\nNASA\u2019s computing projects. a while back when Hubble went offline, i started\ndigging around for more info about it\u2019s computers. while some details are\navailable, a wide range of references documents are no where to be found. one\nspecific one i would really like to find is:\nhttps://hackaday.io/project/180467-nasa-standard-spacecraft-\ncomputer-1-nssc-1/log/194538-in-search-of-a-document\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  13. prpplague says:\n\nMay 6, 2024 at 12:31 pm\n\nas a side note the Hackaday staff: a good write up on Ann Merwarth would be\ninteresting! https://hackaday.io/project/180467-nasa-standard-spacecraft-\ncomputer-1-nssc-1/log/194542-ann-merwarth\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  14.

Goddard sent me out to JPL to swap jobs with a guy\nwho came back to GSFC. I knew the 3 computer types inside and out. It blows my\nmind that they are still working, still sending back good data (from outside\nout solar system).
