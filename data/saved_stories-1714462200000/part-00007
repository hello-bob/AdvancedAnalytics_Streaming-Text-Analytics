He plotted thousands of dots in a pattern so that when viewed\nfrom afar, the dots looked like an identifiable image, like a person\u2019s face.\n\nBut years later, when Phil attended art school, a shake began to develop in\nhis hand. He was shocked that he could no longer draw straight lines, and the\ndots he plotted looked like tadpoles. At first, Phil compensated with\nwillpower and held the pen tighter to gain control of the tremor. The effort,\nhowever, made the shake worse: the tighter he held on to the pen, the more\npain he experienced around his muscles and joints. He saw it as the\n\u201cdestruction of my dream of becoming an artist.\u201d Devastated, Hansen quit\nschool to leave the craft behind.\n\nPhil became an X-ray technician. However, his desire to return to art gnawed\non. A few years later, he saw a neurologist, who diagnosed him with permanent\nnerve damage in his forearm. The doctor looked at Phil\u2019s squiggly line and\nasked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you embrace the shake?\u201d\n\nThat day, Phil went home, grabbed a pencil, and let his hand shake as he drew.\n\u201cIt felt great.\u201d he later recalled. \u201cOnce I embraced the shake, I realized I\ncould still make art.\u201d He realized that he had been stuck on assuming\npointillism as his only technique when it was possible to explore his work in\nmany other ways. \u201cThis was the first time I\u2019d encountered this idea that\nembracing a limitation could actually drive creativity.\u201d\n\nPhil used this new lens to approach his projects. Once, he was at a Starbucks\nasking for an extra cup. The limit he applied to his project was to use only a\ndollar\u2019s worth of supply, so he thought, what if he asked barristers for 50\nfree cups? \u201cSurprisingly, they just handed them right over,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd\nthen with some pencils I already had, I made this project for only 80 cents.\nIt really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be\nlimited in order to become limitless.\u201d\n\nPhil\u2019s project with Starbucks cups. Credit: Philinthecircle.com\n\nThis shift in perspective marked a new beginning for Phil to experiment with\nnew working methods that wouldn\u2019t hurt his arms. Phil expanded the types of\nmaterials he used: he created a 2-D version of Michaelangelo\u2019s David with\nchocolate chips, made a canvas of Virgin Mary with over 200 peanut butter\njelly sandwiches, and put an image on a banana by poking it with a push pin\nand letting it oxidize. He made images by X-raying sand, a portrait of Mother\nTheresa out of dandelions, and a portrait of the Ku Klux Klan with printed\nbiblical verses.\n\nHe also began to use his entire body, painting Michael Jackson by dancing with\npaint on his feet and a portrait of Bruce Lee by doing karate chops on an art\nboard.\n\nIn 2013, Phil had another problem: His art pieces were too big, and he was\nrunning out of space. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever seen the TV show Hoarders, it was like\nthe artist edition,\u201d he described his studio. The physical clutter had become\nmental clutter, so Phil decided to work on a year-long project called \u201cGoodbye\nArt\u201d: he would make 23 art pieces and then immediately destroy them.\n\nThe mental barrier to destroying his own work was initially high. \u201cI felt\nmyself getting all nervous and anxious because I just spent all this time\nworking on it, and the idea of destroying it just seemed pointless.\u201d He\nthought about making a copy and not telling anyone. \u201cBut I knew if I did that,\nthat I wouldn\u2019t be able to destroy any of the other projects.\u201d\n\nWhen he put his work through the shredder and dumped it in the trash, he felt\nhorrible at first, but after a while, he felt a sense of relief and\nexcitement. \u201cAs each time I created, destruction brought me back to a neutral\nplace where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAs I destroyed each project, I was learning to let go, let go of outcomes,\nlet go of failures, and let go of imperfections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis seemed like the ultimate limitation, being an artist without art.\u201d\n\nPhil Hansen (1979\u2014) is a self-taught American artist.\n\nSources:\n\n  * Phil In the Circle\n  * An Interview with Phil Hansen (Ep. 274)\n  * Embrace the Shake, TED\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\n\u2190 Previous #161 | Toni Morrison\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n# 1,000 Leaps\n\nMy public notebook on remarkable people and thought-provoking ideas.

An investigation into alleged bribery, money-laundering,\nforged transfer contracts and the involvement of organised crime at the\nhighest levels of professional football that began in 2018 eventually\nimplicated almost 60 agents, administrators, referees and coaches.\n\nKnown as Operation Clean Hands, the level of alleged corruption it uncovered\nnot only led to the establishment of new strict financial regulations for\nclubs in Belgium but also opened eyes in the corridors of power in Brussels.\nIn 2019, football was added to the European Union\u2019s watchlist of money-\nlaundering risks, with a United Nations report estimating that around $140bn\nis laundered through the game every year. Yet while many leagues already have\nstrict financial regulations aimed at preventing fraud, the French MEP, Damien\nCar\u00eame, believes the concern has been more focused on complying with financial\nfair play regulations than stopping corruption.\n\nFootball transfers rife with illegality and exploitation, unpublished report\nfound\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cCriminals, oligarchs and the rich and powerful have privileged ways of\nlaundering their dirty money, and football is one of them as experts\nassessments and scandals have shown time and again,\u201d Car\u00eame told the Guardian.\n\u201cWhat is more important: preventing corruption, tax fraud, trafficking of all\nkinds and the loss of confidence of citizens in their governments, or\npreserving the competitiveness of football clubs? For the European parliament,\nthe choice was quickly made.\n\n\u201cCan fans really enjoy the game when you know the money used to buy your\nfavourite player comes from organised criminal groups proceeds or from a\nRussian oligarch who supports the war of aggression against Ukraine? I\npersonally cannot.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, member states from the European parliament will vote to include\nthe football industry in its sixth anti-money laundering directive. No late\nhiccups are expected and it will mean that, from 2029, most professional clubs\nand every agent within the European Union will be required to verify their\ncustomers\u2019 identities, monitor transactions \u2013 including player transfers \u2013 and\nreport suspicious transactions to their relevant Financial Intelligence Unit\n(FIU).\n\nKnown as \u201cobliged entities\u201d, they will also be required to identify and\npublish beneficial owners who own at least 15% of the club in transparency\nregisters and design and implement appropriate transaction monitoring\nprocedures to identify suspicious transactions.\n\nDamien Car\u00eame: \u2018Can fans really enjoy the game when you know the money used to\nbuy your favourite player comes from organised criminal groups?\u2019 Photograph:\nChristian Hartmann/Reuters\n\nSo seismic are the changes expected to be that policymakers have extended the\nadaptation period from the usual three years to five, having seen the\ndifficulties some clubs in Belgium have faced in complying to similar\nregulations. Insiders say it is no coincidence that the new legislation will\nbe passed while Belgium is holding the six-month rotating presidency of the\nEuropean Council, with the pressure on to deliver ahead of June\u2019s European\nelections.\n\nYet while the new rules are seen as an important step against the fight\nagainst corruption, critics have argued the legislation has been rushed\nthrough without being subject to an extensive impact assessment over a number\nof years. It is understood that Uefa has cautioned its stakeholders over the\nprocess due to concerns that none of usual background work had taken place\nbecause the legislation was added as an amendment to an existing bill by the\nEuropean Parliament in 2021.\n\nIt is believed there was no request for information from European football\u2019s\ngoverning body or its stakeholders until a very late stage in the process,\nwith Football Supporters Europe (FSE) having also expressed concerns over the\noriginal proposals and recommended creating a tailored setoff rules for the\nsport following a lengthy consultation period.\n\nPremier League clubs agree to cap spending on players as part of PSR reform\n\nRead more\n\nThe European Club Association, which represents the continent\u2019s biggest clubs,\nis also believed to have felt sidelined from negotiations with the EU and\nvoiced its frustrations through Uefa and national governments \u2013 in particular\nfrom France, the Netherlands and Germany. But despite one meeting described as\n\u201cunpleasant\u201d by an EU source, in which both sides were at loggerheads over the\nproposal to include all professional clubs in the new legislation, they have\nagreed to a series of exemptions that will allow clubs with turnovers of under\n\u20ac5m a season to avoid the new laws that will also target crypto-asset service\nproviders and traders of luxury cars, aircraft and yachts.\n\nExemptions will only be given if clubs can show they are \u201cproven low risk\u201d\nfollowing assessment by The European Commission\u2019s anti-money laundering\nauthority (AMLA), which it was confirmed in February will be based in\nFrankfurt.\n\nRoman Abramovich was forced to sell Chelsea following Russia\u2019s invasion of\nUkraine. Photograph: Ozan K\u00f6se/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThose changes are understood to have softened Uefa\u2019s initial opposition to the\nbill, with the European parliament and the European Council having reached a\npreliminary agreement on the new measures in January, before their\nratification by MEPs on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cUefa shares the objectives of policymakers and stakeholders to tackle\nfinancial crime and to protect the sustainability and integrity of the game at\nall levels,\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian. \u201cFootball stakeholders and\nauthorities at European and national levels will work hand in hand in the next\nyears to ensure optimal national implementation of EU rules as well as to help\navoid unintended consequences across Europe\u2019s diverse football landscape.\u201d\n\nClubs are also believed to have concerns about how the new rules may affect\nthe competitiveness of their clubs compared to the rest of the world \u2013 an\nargument that is understood to have puzzled EU policymakers who say they are\nattempting to \u201charmonise\u201d the fight against corruption in the sport. \u201cEveryone\nacknowledges that there is a big issue in football that needs solving and the\npoint of legislation is to try to find the right balance,\u201d says one source.\n\nBut while British clubs will remain outside their jurisdiction for now,\ninsiders expect that they could follow suit if it proves successful. \u201cThere is\nmoney laundering in football at all levels. You have criminals operating in\nconnection with several European countries,\u201d adds the source. \u201cBut now there\nis no hiding and the clock is ticking.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Finances\n  * European club football\n  * Business\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Football\n  * Live scores\n  * Tables\n  * Fixtures\n  * Results\n  * Competitions\n  * Clubs\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

(AP) \u2014 One of the winners of a $1.3 billion Powerball jackpot this\nmonth is an immigrant from Laos who has had cancer for eight years and had his\nlatest chemotherapy treatment last week.\n\nCheng \u201cCharlie\u201d Saephan, 46, of Portland, told a news conference held by the\nOregon Lottery on Monday that he and his 37-year-old wife, Duanpen, are taking\nhalf the money, and the rest is going to a friend, Laiza Chao, 55, of the\nPortland suburb of Milwaukie. Chao had chipped in $100 to buy a batch of\ntickets with them. They are taking a lump sum payment, $422 million after\ntaxes.\n\n\u201cI will be able to provide for my family and my health,\u201d he said, adding that\nhe\u2019d \u201cfind a good doctor for myself.\u201d\n\nSaephan, who has two young children, said that as a cancer patient, he\nwondered, \u201cHow am I going to have time to spend all of this money? How long\nwill I live?\u201d\n\nAfter they bought the shared tickets, Chao sent a photo of the tickets to\nSaephan and said, \u201cWe\u2019re billionaires.\u201d It was a joke before the actual\ndrawing, he said, but the next day they won.\n\nChao, 55, was on her way to work when Saephan called her with the news: \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to go anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nOregon\u2019s Sports Bra, a pub for women\u2019s sports fans, plans national expansion\nas interest booms\n\nPac-12 players to watch as the conference gets ready to splinter across the\ncountry\n\nA conservative quest to limit diversity programs gains momentum in states\n\nSaephan said he was born in Laos and moved to Thailand in 1987, before\nimmigrating to the U.S. in 1994. He wore a sash at the news conference\nidentifying himself as Iu Mien, a southeast Asian ethnic group with roots in\nsouthern China. Many Iu Mein were subsistence farmers and assisted American\nforces during the Vietnam war; after the conflict, thousands of Iu Mien\nfamilies fled to Thailand to avoid retribution and eventually settled in the\nU.S.\n\nTens of thousands of Iu Mien people live along the West Coast, with a sizeable\nand active community in Portland.\n\nSaephan graduated from high school in 1996 and has lived in Portland for 30\nyears. He worked as a machinist for an aerospace company.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the drawing, he wrote out numbers for the game on a\npiece of paper and slept with it under his pillow, he said. He prayed that he\nwould win, saying, \u201cI need some help \u2014 I don\u2019t want to die yet unless I have\ndone something for my family first.\u201d\n\nThe winning Powerball ticket was sold in early April at a Plaid Pantry\nconvenience store in Portland, ending a winless streak that had stretched more\nthan three months. The Oregon Lottery said it had to go through a security and\nvetting process before announcing the identity of the person who came forward\nto claim the prize.\n\nUnder Oregon law, with few exceptions, lottery players cannot remain\nanonymous. Winners have a year to claim the top prize.\n\nThe jackpot had a cash value of $621 million before taxes if the winner chose\nto take a lump sum rather than an annuity paid over 30 years, with an\nimmediate payout followed by 29 annual installments. The prize is subject to\nfederal taxes and state taxes in Oregon.\n\nThe $1.3 billion prize is the fourth largest Powerball jackpot in history, and\nthe eighth largest among U.S. jackpot games, according to the Oregon Lottery.\n\nThe biggest U.S. lottery jackpot won was $2.04 billion in California in 2022.\n\n## ___\n\nJohnson reported from Seattle.\n\nCLAIRE RUSH\n\nStatehouse reporter based in Portland, Oregon.\n\ntwitter\n\nmailto\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nJury finds Wisconsin man guilty in killing, sexual assault of 20-month-old\ngirl\n\nUndo\n\nPro VerbraucherAd Content\n\nAdvertisement Bestatter packt aus: Anspruch auf Sterbegeld ist vielen\nunbekanntPro Verbraucher:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUndo\n\nTrial starts in conspiracy-fueled case of girlfriend charged in Boston police\nofficer's death\n\nUndo\n\nJudge upholds disqualification of challenger to judge in Trump\u2019s Georgia\nelection interference case\n\nUndo\n\nA Colorado woman was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020.
