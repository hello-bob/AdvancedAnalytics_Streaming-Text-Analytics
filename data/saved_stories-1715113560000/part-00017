Users can now enable 2SV without adding\na phone number.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPrior to this change, Google required users to provide their phone number,\nbefore they could set up a 2SV method. Now, when you go to your account\nsettings and enroll into the verification method, you can skip the phone\nnumber if you want to use one of the other methods.\n\nWhile the article published by Google highlights the fact that this change\nwill aid admins to enforce 2SV policies in their organizations, this is a\nwelcome move for all users. That's because relying on a phone number is not a\nsecure option, since SMS based one-time passcodes (OTPs) can be obtained by\nhackers, of if your device is stolen.\n\n### Google no longer requires users to add a phone number before setting up\n2-Step Verification\n\nGoogle lets you choose between 3 options for setting up a 2-step verification.\nYou may opt to use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Microsoft\nAuthenticator. I would suggest looking into open source alternatives such as\nAegis Authenticator for Android, or 2FAS (Android, iOS) or Ente Auth (Android,\niOS).\n\nOptionally, you can use a hardware security key such as a YubiKey to protect\nyour Google account. Google says that the keys will be registered as FIDO1\ncredential even if the key is FIDO2 capable. On the other hand, you can create\na passkey for your Google account, and this will register it as a FIDO2\ncredential. A passkey will require users to input their key's PIN for local\nverification.\n\nOn a side note, Microsoft recently added support for Passkeys for all user\naccounts. WhatsApp Messenger also introduced Passkeys to allow users to\nrelogin to their accounts securely. Bitwarden Password Manager now supports\npasskeys on Android and iOS. It is clear that passkeys are quickly rising in\npopularity. As a matter of fact, Google recently revealed that its users have\nused passkeys for authentication over 1 billion times across over 400 million\naccounts in less than a year. Interested in setting it up? Follow our tutorial\nto create a passkey for your Google account using your fingerprint reader,\nFace ID, or your device's screen lock code.\n\nThe Mountain View company also says that when a user who had 2SV enabled for\ntheir account disables the setting, other enrolled second steps such as backup\ncodes, Google Authenticator, or a second factor phone, will not be removed\nautomatically from their account anymore. This will likely be helpful in\npreventing users from being locked out of their accounts, especially when\nswitching to a new device.\n\nThe best part is that the new 2-Step Verification process is not exclusive to\nGoogle Workspace customers, it is available for all users including personal\naccounts. The announcement mentions that the change is being implemented over\nthe next two days. If you have not done so already, you can enable 2-step\nverification for your Google Account from your Account's security page.\nEnabling 2SV will protect your account from being hacked, even if your\npassword is leaked.\n\nWhich 2SV method do you use, an authenticator app or a hardware security key?\n\nSummary\n\nArticle Name\n\nGoogle now lets you set up 2-Step Verification without adding a phone number\n\nDescription\n\nGoogle users can set up 2-Step Verification without a phone number first.\n\nAuthor\n\nAshwin\n\nPublisher\n\nGhacks Technology News\n\nLogo\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### About Ashwin\n\nAshwin has been blogging since 2012 and is known among his friends as the go\nto tech geek.
