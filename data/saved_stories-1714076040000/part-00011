As\npractitioners interacting with multiple cybersecurity and IT professionals, we\nhave struggled with fragmentation and lack of efficient tooling. We keep\nimproving CISO Assistant with anything that could bring clarity and\nproductivity to cybersecurity teams and reduce the effort of research, audit\nmanagement and paperwork.\n\nCyberSecurity teams need to use GRC as a foundation to structure their program\nand implement the right tools and processes to mitigate the risks, and leave\nthe rest to CISO Assistant \ud83d\udc19\n\nThe vision of the tool is based on this model:\n\nThe full details are available in the data model.\n\nThe decoupling allows you to save a considerable amount of time:\n\n  * reuse previous assessments,\n  * assess a scope against multiple frameworks at the same time,\n  * leave the reporting formatting and sanity check to CISO assistant and focus on your fixes,\n  * balance controls implementation and compliance follow-up\n\nCISO Assistant is developed and maintained by intuitem, a French \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 company\nspecialized in Cyber Security, Cloud and Data/AI.\n\n## Quick Start \ud83d\ude80\n\nTip\n\nThe easiest way to get started is through the free trial of cloud instance\navailable here.\n\nAlternatively, once you have Docker and Docker-compose installed, on your\nworkstation or server, clone the repo and run:\n\n    \n    \n    ./docker-compose.sh\n\nNote\n\nThe docker-compose script uses prebuilt Docker images supporting most of the\nstandard hardware architecture. If you're using Windows, Make sure to have WSL\ninstalled and trigger the script within a WSL command line. It will feed\nDocker Desktop on your behalf.\n\nWarning\n\nIf you're getting warnings or errors about image's platform not matching host\nplatform, raise an issue with the details and we'll add it shortly after. You\ncan also use docker-compose-build.sh instead (see below) to build for your\nspecific architecture.\n\n## End-user Documentation\n\nCheck out the online documentation on https://intuitem.gitbook.io/ciso-\nassistant.\n\n## Supported frameworks \ud83d\udc19\n\n  1.

Update docker\n\nMake sure you have a recent version of docker (>= 25.0).\n\n  1. Clone the repository\n\n    \n    \n    git clone git@github.com:intuitem/ciso-assistant-community.git cd ciso-assistant-community\n\n  2. Launch docker-compose script for prebuilt images:\n\n    \n    \n    ./docker-compose.sh\n\nAlternatively, you can use this variant to build the docker images for your\nspecific architecture:\n\n    \n    \n    ./docker-compose-build.sh\n\nWhen asked for, enter your email and password for your superuser.\n\nYou can then reach CISO Assistant using your web browser at\nhttps://localhost:8443/\n\nFor the following executions, use \"docker compose up\" directly.\n\nTip\n\nIf you want a fresh install, simply delete the db directory, (default:\nbackend/db) where the database is stored.\n\n## Setting up CISO Assistant for development\n\n### Requirements\n\n  * Python 3.11+\n  * pip 20.3+\n  * node 18+\n  * npm 10.2+\n\n### Running the backend\n\n  1. Clone the repository.\n\n    \n    \n    git clone git@github.com:intuitem/ciso-assistant-community.git cd ciso-assistant-community\n\n  2. Create a file in the parent folder (e.g. ../myvars) and store your environment variables within it by copying and modifying the following code and replace \"<XXX>\" by your private values. Take care not to commit this file in your git repo.\n\nMandatory variables\n\nAll variables in the backend have handy default values.\n\nRecommended variables\n\n    \n    \n    export DJANGO_DEBUG=True # Default url is set to http://localhost:5173 but you can change it, e.g. to use https with a caddy proxy export CISO_ASSISTANT_URL=https://localhost:8443 # Setup a development mailer with Mailhog for example export EMAIL_HOST_USER='' export EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='' export DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=ciso-assistant@ciso-assistantcloud.com export EMAIL_HOST=localhost export EMAIL_PORT=1025\n\nOther variables\n\n    \n    \n    # CISO Assistant will use SQLite by default, but you can setup PostgreSQL by declaring these variables export POSTGRES_NAME=ciso-assistant export POSTGRES_USER=ciso-assistantuser export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<XXX> export POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=<XXX> # alternative way to specify password export DB_HOST=localhost export DB_PORT=5432 # optional, default value is 5432 # Add a second backup mailer export EMAIL_HOST_RESCUE=<XXX> export EMAIL_PORT_RESCUE=587 export EMAIL_HOST_USER_RESCUE=<XXX> export EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD_RESCUE=<XXX> export EMAIL_USE_TLS_RESCUE=True # You can define the email of the first superuser, useful for automation. A mail is sent to the superuser for password initialization export CISO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=<XXX> # By default, Django secret key is generated randomly at each start of CISO Assistant. This is convenient for quick test, # but not recommended for production, as it can break the sessions (see # this [topic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15170637/effects-of-changing-djangos-secret-key) for more information). # To set a fixed secret key, use the environment variable DJANGO_SECRET_KEY. export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=... # Logging configuration export LOG_LEVEL=INFO # optional, default value is INFO. Available options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL export LOG_FORMAT=plain # optional, default value is plain. Available options: json, plain\n\n  3. Choose the tool of your choice, either python-venv or virtualenv. For example:\n\n    \n    \n    # Install python-venv sudo apt install python-venv # or python3-venv # Create the virtual environment venv python -m venv venv # or python3 -m venv venv # To enter inside the virtual environment source venv/bin/activate # If you want to exit the virtual environment once finished deactivate\n\n  4. Install required dependencies.\n\n    \n    \n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n  5. If you want to setup Postgres:\n\n  * Launch one of these commands to enter in Postgres:\n\n    * psql as superadmin\n    * sudo su postgres\n    * psql\n  * Create the database \"ciso-assistant\"\n\n    * create database ciso-assistant;\n  * Create user \"ciso-assistantuser\" and grant it access\n\n    * create user ciso-assistantuser with password '<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>';\n    * grant all privileges on database ciso-assistant to ciso-assistantuser;\n\n  6. Apply migrations.\n\n    \n    \n    python manage.py migrate\n\n  7. Create a Django superuser, that will be CISO Assistant administrator.\n\n> If you have set a mailer and CISO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL variable, there's no need\n> to create a Django superuser with createsuperuser, as it will be created\n> automatically on first start. You should receive an email with a link to\n> setup your password.\n    \n    \n    python manage.py createsuperuser\n\n  8. Run development server.\n\n    \n    \n    python manage.py runserver\n\n  9. Configure the git hooks for generating the build name.\n\n    \n    \n    cd .git/hooks ln -fs ../../git_hooks/post-commit . ln -fs ../../git_hooks/post-merge .\n\n### Running the frontend\n\n  1. cd into the frontend directory\n\n    \n    \n    cd frontend\n\n  2. Install dependencies\n\n    \n    \n    npm install\n\n  3. Start a development server (make sure that the django app is running)\n\n    \n    \n    npm run dev\n\n  4. Reach the frontend on http://localhost:5173\n\nNote\n\nSafari will not properly work in this setup, as it requires https for secure\ncookies. The simplest solution is to use Chrome or Firefox. An alternative is\nto use a caddy proxy. This is the solution used in docker-compose, so you can\nuse it as an example.\n\n  5. Environment variables\n\nAll variables in the frontend have handy default values.\n\nIf you move the frontend on another host, you should set the following\nvariable: PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL. Its default value is\nhttp://localhost:8000/api.\n\nWhen you launch \"node server\" instead of \"npm run dev\", you need to set the\nORIGIN variable to the same value as CISO_ASSISTANT_URL in the backend (e.g.\nhttp://localhost:3000).\n\n### Managing migrations\n\nThe migrations are tracked by version control,\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/migrations/#version-control\n\nFor the first version of the product, it is recommended to start from a clean\nmigration.\n\nNote: to clean existing migrations, type:\n\n    \n    \n    find . -path \"*/migrations/*.py\" -not -name \"__init__.py\" -delete find . -path \"*/migrations/*.pyc\" -delete\n\nAfter a change (or a clean), it is necessary to re-generate migration files:\n\n    \n    \n    python manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate\n\nThese migration files should be tracked by version control.\n\n### Test suite\n\nTo run API tests on the backend, simply type \"pytest\" in a shell in the\nbackend folder.\n\nTo run functional tests on the frontend, do the following actions:\n\n  * in the frontend folder, launch the following command:\n\n    \n    \n    tests/e2e-tests.sh\n\nThe goal of the test harness is to prevent any regression, i.e. all the tests\nshall be successful, both for backend and frontend.\n\n## Setting CISO Assistant for production\n\nThe docker-compose.yml highlights a relevant configuration with a Caddy proxy\nin front of the frontend.\n\nSet DJANGO_DEBUG=False for security reason.\n\nNote\n\nThe frontend cannot infer the host automatically, so you need to either set\nthe ORIGIN variable, or the HOST_HEADER and PROTOCOL_HEADER variables. Please\nsee the sveltekit doc on this tricky issue.\n\nNote\n\nCaddy needs to receive a SNI header. Therefore, for your public URL (the one\ndeclared in CISO_ASSISTANT_URL), you need to use a FQDN, not an IP address, as\nthe SNI is not transmitted by a browser if the host is an IP address.
