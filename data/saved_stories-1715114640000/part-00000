Today, we\u2019re taking it even further\nwith the new, stunningly thin and light iPad Pro, our biggest update ever to\niPad Pro,\u201d said John Ternus, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Hardware\nEngineering. \u201cWith the breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display, the next-level\nperformance of M4, incredible AI capabilities, and support for the all-new\nApple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard, there\u2019s no device like the new iPad Pro.\u201d\n\nThe new iPad Pro comes in two sizes: an expansive 13-inch model and a super-\nportable 11-inch model.\n\n## Thinnest Apple Product Ever\n\nThe new iPad Pro \u2014 the thinnest Apple product ever \u2014 features a stunningly\nthin and light design, taking portability to a whole new level. The 11-inch\nmodel is just 5.3 mm thin, and the 13-inch model is even thinner at a striking\n5.1 mm, while both models are just as strong as the previous design. The\n11-inch model weighs less than a pound, and the 13-inch model is nearly a\nquarter pound lighter than its predecessor \u2014 allowing pro users to extend\ntheir workflows in new ways and in more places. The new iPad Pro is available\nin two gorgeous finishes \u2014 silver and space black \u2014 both with 100 percent\nrecycled aluminum enclosures.\n\nThe new iPad Pro is the thinnest Apple product ever, taking portability to a\nwhole new level.\n\nThe 11-inch model is just 5.3 mm thin, and the 13-inch model is even thinner\nat a striking 5.1 mm.\n\nThe new iPad Pro is available in space black (pictured) and a stunning silver.\n\nThe new iPad Pro is available in space black and a stunning silver (pictured).\n\n## World\u2019s Most Advanced Display\n\nThe new iPad Pro debuts the Ultra Retina XDR, the world\u2019s most advanced\ndisplay, to provide an even more remarkable visual experience. The Ultra\nRetina XDR display features state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology that uses\ntwo OLED panels and combines the light from both to provide phenomenal full-\nscreen brightness. The new iPad Pro supports an incredible 1000 nits of full-\nscreen brightness for SDR and HDR content, and 1600 nits peak for HDR. No\nother device of its kind delivers this level of extreme dynamic range. Tandem\nOLED technology enables sub-millisecond control over the color and luminance\nof each pixel, taking XDR precision further than ever. Specular highlights in\nphotos and video appear even brighter, and there\u2019s more detail in shadows and\nlow light than ever before on iPad \u2014 all while delivering even more\nresponsiveness to content in motion. For pro users working in high-end, color-\nmanaged workflows or challenging lighting conditions, a new nano-texture glass\noption comes to iPad Pro for the first time.^1 Nano-texture glass is precisely\netched at a nanometer scale, maintaining image quality and contrast while\nscattering ambient light for reduced glare.
