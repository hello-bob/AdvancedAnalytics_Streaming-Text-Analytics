The company\nattributes the 258% increase to improved detection methods and increased\noperational capacity. The number of items that were removed from the site\nfollowing copyright complaints dropped to little over half a million.\n\nWithout doubt, Reddit is one of the most popular user-generated content sites\nthat exists on the Internet today.\n\nLast month, the community-driven news and discussion platform went public and,\nwith a market cap of more than $6 billion, immediately became one of the\nlarger tech players.\n\nWhile publicly traded companies operate under a different ruleset than private\nones, Reddit remains committed to its transparency efforts. A few hours ago,\nthe company released its latest transparency report detailing the actions it\ntook in the second half of 2023.\n\n## 779,628 \u2018Infringing\u2019 Items Flagged\n\nAt TorrentFreak, we are mostly interested in copyright-related actions. In\nrecent years, we have seen an increase in copyright takedown notices on\nReddit, partly driven by the platform\u2019s growth. In the first half of 2023,\nrightsholders requested the removal of nearly a million items, which was an\nall-time record.\n\nDuring the second half of the year, this upward trend reversed. Reddit reports\nthat rightsholders flagged 779,628 items between July and December, an 18%\ndecrease compared to the first half of the year.\n\nAs shown above, not all of these takedown requests resulted in action. Reddit\nremoved 69% of the reported items, which is the lowest removal percentage of\nthe past two years. This logically means that little over half a million items\nwere removed.\n\nThe high rejection rate might suggest that rightsholders\u2019 takedown requests\nare too broad. However, most takedowns are rejected simply because the content\nhas already been removed. In 29,143 cases, Reddit concluded that there was no\ninfringement; other, less common reasons, include suspected fraud and fair\nuse.\n\n## Copyright-Related User Bans\n\nThus far, there is nothing to show that Reddit\u2019s decision to go public had a\nmajor impact on its copyright takedown policies. That said, the company does\nsignal a significant increase in copyright-related user bans.\n\n\u201cFrom July to December of 2023, Reddit banned 792 users for repeat Copyright\nPolicy violations, an increase of 258% compared to the first half of 2023.\nThis large increase is a result of improvements to our detection methods and\nincreased operational capacity,\u201d Reddit writes.\n\nThese user bans are in part the result of legal obligations. Under the DMCA,\nReddit is required to implement a reasonable policy to deal with repeat\ncopyright infringers on its platform.\n\nImproved detection methods and increased capacity suggest that Reddit takes\nrepeat infringements seriously. However, if we go further back in time, we see\nthat the number of banned users is far from a record. In the first half of\n2022, Reddit banned 3,859 users over repeat copyright infringements.\n\n## Subreddit and Counter-Notices\n\nIn addition to removing or banning posts, links, and users, Reddit also took\naction against entire subreddits. In the last half of 2023, the platform\nbanned 452 subreddits, down 20% compared to the six months prior.\n\nFinally, Reddit points out that users can always object to takedown notices by\nsending counter-notices. In the final half of last year, the discussion\nplatform received 397 counter-notices, of which 216 were deemed valid.\n\nThe number of valid notices increased by 86% since the last report, which\nReddit attributed to its increased operational capacity. As a result, 1,331\npieces of content were successfully restored.\n\nWhile not specifically mentioned in the report, Reddit also continued to\nobject to requests from a group of filmmakers to identify Reddit users. The\ncompany does typically respond to U.S. subpoenas, but in this case, it argued\nthat the requests violated users\u2019 constitutional right to anonymous speech.\n\n\u2014\n\nReddit\u2019s latest transparency report covering the last six months of 2023 is\navailable here\n\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * DMCA\n  * reddit\n  * repeat infringer\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### DMCA Notice Targeting \u2018Bypass Paywalls Clean\u2019 Isn\u2019t The Thing to Get Angry\nAbout\n\n  * April 14, 2024, 16:57 by Andy Maxwell\n\nLawsuits\n\n### \u2018X\u2019 Denies Music Companies\u2019 Remaining Piracy Liability Claims in Court\n\n  * April 10, 2024, 11:41 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nLawsuits\n\n### Court Denies ISP\u2019s Request to Dismiss Music and Movie Piracy Liability\nClaims\n\n  * April 2, 2024, 11:44 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nVPN Provider Agrees to Block Torrent Traffic and The Pirate Bay on U.S.\nServers\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nVPN Provider Agrees to Block Torrent Traffic and The Pirate Bay on U.S.\nServers\n\n\u2018Game of Thrones Season Premiere Pirated 54 million Times in a Day\u2019\n\nGene Simmons: P2P Pioneers Should Have Been Forced into Work Like Nazis\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14953\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": false}
