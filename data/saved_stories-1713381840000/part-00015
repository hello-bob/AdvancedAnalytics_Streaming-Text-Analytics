There has never been a soda named \"Spaces\" that had a cult following.\n\nGetty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n326\n\nAnybody can contribute to the Linux kernel, but any person's commit suggestion\ncan become the subject of the kernel's master and namesake, Linus Torvalds.\nTorvalds is famously not overly committed to niceness, though he has been\nworking on it since 2018. You can see glimpses of this newer, less curse-laden\napproach in how Torvalds recently addressed a commit with which he vehemently\ndisagreed. It involves tabs.\n\nThe commit last week changed exactly one thing on one line, replacing a tab\ncharacter with a space: \"It helps Kconfig parsers to read file without error.\"\nTorvalds responded with a commit of his own, as spotted by The Register, which\nwould \"add some hidden tabs on purpose.\" Trying to smooth over a tabs-versus-\nspaces matter seemed to awaken Torvalds to the need to have tab-detecting\nfailures be \"more obvious.\" Torvalds would have added more, he wrote, but\ndidn't \"want to make things uglier than necessary. But it *might* be necessary\nif it turns out we see more of this kind of silly tooling.\"\n\nIf you've read this far and don't understand what's happening, please allow\nme, a failed CS minor, to offer a quick explanation: Tabs Versus Spaces will\nnever be truly resolved, codified, or set right by standards, and the energy\nspent on the issue over time could, if harnessed, likely power one or more\nsmall nations. Still, the Linux kernel has its own coding style, and it\ndirectly cites \"K&R,\" or Kernighan & Ritchie, the authors of the coding bible\nThe C Programming Language, which is a tabs book. If you are submitting kernel\ncode, it had better use tabs (eight-character tabs, ideally, though that is\ntied in part to teletype and line-printer history).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy attempting to smooth over one tiny part of the kernel so that a parsing\ntool could see a space character as a delineating whitespace, Prasad Pandit\ninadvertently spurred a robust rebuttal:\n\n> It wasn't clear what tool it was, but let's make sure it gets fixed. Because\n> if you can't parse tabs as whitespace, you should not be parsing the kernel\n> Kconfig files.\n>\n> In fact, let's make such breakage more obvious than some esoteric ftrace\n> record size option. If you can't parse tabs, you can't have page sizes.\n>\n> Yes, tab-vs-space confusion is sadly a traditional Unix thing, and 'make' is\n> famous for being broken in this regard. But no, that does not mean that it's\n> ok.\n\nTorvalds' hidden tabs appear in the fourth release candidate for Linux kernel\n6.9, which Torvlads wrote had \"nothing particularly unusual going on\" the week\nof its release.\n\nDisclosure: The author is a tab person insofar as he has any idea what he's\ndoing.\n\nThis post was updated at 6:33 pm Eastern to fix some line-break issues in the\nTorvalds blockquote. The irony was duly noted. A better link regarding the\nTabs Vs. Spaces debate was also swapped in.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n326\n\nKevin Purdy Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering a\nvariety of technology topics and reviewing products.
