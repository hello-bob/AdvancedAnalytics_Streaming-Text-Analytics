This decision prohibits Meta from using an unlawful consent request\nprocessing personal data. It seems that by now, Meta has run out of options to\ncontinue using people's data for advertising in the EU without a consent\nmechanism that actually complies with the law.\n\n  * Politico report on the EDPB decision\n  * First noyb complaint against Meta's \"Pay or Okay\" system\n  * Second noyb complaint against Meta's \"Pay or Okay\" system\n\nOpinion on large online platforms. As argued in previous cases brought by\nnoyb, the EDPB appears to have followed the only logical understanding of the\nterm \"freely given consent\" when analysing Meta's \"Pay or Okay\" system, which\ncharged users more than \u20ac 250 per year for Instagram and Facebook if they did\nnot \"freely\" consent to the use of their personal data. Politico quotes the\nEDPB as saying \"In most cases, it will not be possible for large online\nplatforms to comply with the requirements for valid consent if they confront\nusers only with a binary choice between consenting to processing of personal\ndata for behavioral advertising purposes and paying a fee\".\n\nMax Schrems: \"Overall, Meta is out of options in the EU. It must now give\nusers a genuine yes/no option for personalised advertising. It can still\ncharge sites for reach, engage in contextual advertising and the like - but\ntracking people for ads needs a clear 'yes' from users.\"\n\nDiscussion stated - evidence needed. Today's EDPB opinion will need to be\nanalysed in more detail once it is published in full. It is likely to be only\na starting point for a wider discussion on \"Pay or Okay\" in various contexts,\ngiven that the EDPB intends to issue further guidelines later this year that\ngo beyond \"large online platforms\". The core question remains whether a \"Pay\nor Okay\" model can meet the legal requirement that consent must be \"freely\ngiven\" and that the \"genuine wishes\" of the users are upheld. After all,\nconsenting to the processing of personal data is a decision to give up the\nfundamental right to data protection. Usually, fundamental rights cannot be\n\"sold\" or only granted for a fee. The EDPB has so far largely decided in a\nvacuum, without independent and comprehensive evidence of how a \"Pay or Okay\"\nmodel interferes with users' genuine and free choice.\n\nMax Schrems, Chairman of noyb: \"We welcome that the EDPB has started a more\nnuanced discussion on 'pay or okay' and at least clarified that large\nplatforms cannot use 'pay or okay'. However, we are concerned that today's\nfirst opinion is rather cautious and was based on limited facts. Once all the\nfacts are on the table, we are confident that 'Pay or Okay' will be declared\nunlawful across the board. We know that 'Pay or Okay' shifts consent rates\nfrom about 3% to more than 99% - so it is as far from 'freely given' consent\nas North Korea is from a democracy. It is crucial to get all the relevant\nnumbers for further decisions beyond Meta and larger platforms.\"\n\nThird option needed. The EDPB also mentioned the possibility of introducing a\nthird option beyond \"Pay or Okay\", which has so far been largely ignored by\nthe industry. In fact, there are many ways to monetise a website, such as\ncontextual advertising, product placement, paid content or freemium models\nwhere certain content is only available for a fee. While the industry tries to\nlimit the discussion to two options (\"pay\" or \"okay\"), the EDPB has emphasised\nthat the GDPR does not limit other ways of funding products - even if they may\nbe less profitable.\n\nPay or Okay is the end of \"freely given\" consent. As we have warned in recent\nmonths, \"Pay or Okay\" results in massive costs for consumers (easily\n\u20ac35,263.20 for a family of four), that far outweigh publishers' current ad\nrevenues, which often amount to just a few cents. The current average revenue\nfor programmatic advertising in the EU is \u20ac 1,41 per user - across all\nwebsites per month. In countries like Austria, Germany, France, Spain or Italy\nvisiting the top 100 websites can already cost more than \u20ac 1,500 per year if\nyou do not consent to tracking. In last week's background video, we also\nhighlighted the problematic decision-making dynamics of \"Pay or Okay\", which\nchanges the \"free wish\" of users from 3% who want to have personalised\nadvertising to up to 99.9% who (unwillingly) click \"agree\" if the alternative\nis a hefty bill.\n\nMax Schrems: \"When more than 90% of users agree to something they don't want,\nyou don't need a lawyer to see that it's not 'freely given' consent. In fact,\n5 years after the GDPR came into force, this is just the latest 'trick' to\nundermine EU law, or at least delay compliance for a few more years. It is\nhighly problematic that authorities have not already taken a clear position on\nthis. In the cases we have brought in Austria or Germany, we rather see that\nthe authorities turn a blind eye to 'Pay or Okay' because it was first\nintroduced by the news media, which they do not want to interfere with - even\nthough the law is the same for everyone.\"\n\nBackground. Until the GDPR became applicable on 25 May 2018, Meta has used\n\"consent\" under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR as the legal basis for processing users'\npersonal data, for example for advertising. Under the GDPR, consent would have\nto be specific, informed, unambiguous and freely given. Meta feared, that\ngiving users such a yes/no option would limit their options to make money in\nthe EU, so at midnight on 25 May 2018, Meta started arguing that it was part\nof the user contract to show ads, using Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. This was ruled\nillegal by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the European\nData Protection Board (EDPB) in 2023. In 2023, Meta then briefly argued that\nit had a \"legitimate interest\" to process personal data for advertising under\nArticle 6(1)(f) GDPR, until it began to revert to \"consent\" under Article\n6(1)(a) GDPR - by asking users to consent or pay a fee of up to \u20ac 20.99 for\nInstagram and Facebook combined.\n\nThe Norwegian, Dutch and Hamburg data protection authority took \"Pay or Okay\"\nback to the EDPB, which has now issued a decision. All these attempts to\ncircumvent the law have been done with the active support of the Irish Data\nProtection Commission (DPC), as the lead regulator of Meta's EU headquarters\nin Ireland. All of these \"agreements\" with the Irish regulator were later\nfound to be unlawful by the EDPB or the CJEU.\n\n## Share\n\n## Related articles\n\n  * 09.04.2024\n\nForced Consent & Consent Bypass\n\n### 'Pay or Okay' explained: Why more and more websites make you pay for your\nprivacy\n\nHow do pay or consent systems work and what are the issues?
