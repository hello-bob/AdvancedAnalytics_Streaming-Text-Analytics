You can use any words you like, as long as\nthey're a valid five-letter word.\n\nTo make a word: tap any 5 letters and hit the submit button.\n\nawsrgroctoseseordlve\n\n_____\n\nIf your word is valid it turns green and the letters are removed from the\nwall.\n\nCLEAR\n\nwsrgrotosesodve\n\nMake another guess using the letters remaining and continue until you Topple\nthe wall.\n\nPressing the \u270f\ufe0f button will move your letters to the top of the wall. This is\nso you can try words out before submitting them.\n\nIf the letters turn red: you can't make any valid words from the remaining\nletters.\n\nCLEAR\n\nROVES\n\nSTORE\n\ngwdxo\n\nTap a guess twice to delete a word and add the letters back in.\n\nEvery wall is built using four golden words!\n\nG\n\nR\n\nE\n\nA\n\nT\n\noessdsovcorrewl\n\nTo help get you started, the first letter of each golden word is highlighted\nin gold.\n\nYou don't have to find the golden words to topple the wall.\n\nEvery third word you guess will unlock a clue!\n\na\n\nw\n\ns\n\nr\n\ng\n\nr\n\no\n\nc\n\nt\n\no\n\ns\n\ne\n\ns\n\ne\n\no\n\nr\n\nd\n\nl\n\nv\n\ne\n\nEvery time you press the Clue Available button the next letter in a golden\nword will be revealed.\n\nIn the wall above 2 clues have been used and we now know a golden word has the\n1st letter: S, 2nd letter: O, and 3rd Letter: L.\n\nToppled also has some extra game settings. Click the \u2699\ufe0f icon to open the\nsettings.\n\nHard Mode: Removes the \u270f\ufe0f Draft setting and adds a \ud83d\udc8e to your results.\n\nExtra Clues: if any of the letters within your guess match the position of\nletters within a golden word they will be highlighted in the All Guesses\nsection.\n\nShow Scoring: Adds a scoring element to the game allowing you to keep track of\nyour score throughout the week\n\nDark Mode: Turn out the lights\n\n## Ready to play Toppled?\n\n### Development Section:\n\n## Toppled #82\n\nFind four valid words to Topple today's wall.\n\nVersion: 1.5.1\n\nA quick message from the developer about the latest update:\n\n(To hide this message press the gift icon in the top bar of the game)\n\nClose X\n\n## Latest Updates:\n\n### Version 1.5.1\n\nTo go along with the new draft feature you can now enable SUPER CLUE MODE.\nPoints are now an optional extra you can switch on.

The position of each letter is shown in the top right hand corner.\n  * Each clue costs 25 points to use\n  * Because golden words now have clues, the scoring has changed. Once you go above 4 guessed words, 5 points per word will be deducted\n  * Failed attempts now deduct 10 points per attempt.\n  * Each word is now worth 25 points.\n  * The bonus for toppling the wall in 4 words is now 400 points.\n  * You can now no longer delete a golden word once it's in the wall.\n\n### Version 1.3\n\nWelcome to all the new players and a big thank you to Rangsk for shouting out\nthe game.
