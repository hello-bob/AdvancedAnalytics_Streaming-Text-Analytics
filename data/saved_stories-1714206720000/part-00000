The recovered images are seen in the\ncenter.\n\nHowever, the research team led by Professor Tson-Kong (T.K.) Sham found that\ntheir novel technique \u2014 which builds on a strategy that they first reported in\n2018 \u2014 can be used no matter how badly damaged the surface of the image is\nfrom natural corrosion or cleaning attempts.\n\n## Revealing Images That Seemed Lost Forever\n\nAccording to a report in Newsweek, the team of scientists first hypothesized\nthat they might be able to use narrow beams of X-ray radiation to retrieve\nhighly corroded and tarnished daguerreotype images back in 2018.\n\n\u201cSince then, we improved the capabilities of the techniques and we can get\nmuch better images,\u201d Sham says. \u201cIn order to do that, we have to use much\nsofter X-rays.\u201d\n\nNewsweek reports that for the latest study, Sham and his team applied \u201csofter\nX-rays\u201d that are available at the Canadian Light Source (CLS), a national\nresearch facility that offers the only synchrotron light source \u2014 a type of\nparticle accelerator that is capable of producing extremely bright light \u2014 in\nCanada.\n\nSham and his team applied their synchrotron light technique at the CLS\nfacility to daguerreotype plates from the 19th century. These daguerreotypes,\nwhich belong to private collectors and the National Gallery of Canada, were\nbadly tarnished \u2014 likely thanks to deterioration over time and possible\ncleaning attempts.\n\nHowever, the researchers managed to uncover daguerreotype images of a man and\nwoman dressed in mid-1850s garments as well as a photograph of of a baby\nwrapped in covers using this synchrotron light technique.\n\nThe researchers demonstrated that their technique was always effective as long\nas the image particles underneath the tarnish remained intact.\n\n\u201cRevealing images that seemed lost forever is what\u2019s most exciting,\u201d Sham\nsays.\n\n\u201cWe get a glimpse of people living in the 19th century that we wouldn\u2019t have\notherwise and learn about their history and culture.\u201d\n\nThe research also showed the same X-rays that can help researchers \u201csee\u201d\nthrough the corrosion on the surface of daguerreotypes can also indirectly\nlead to damaging the plates.\n\n\u201cX-ray usually doesn\u2019t damage metals visibly, so I didn\u2019t think it would\naffect the plates, but perhaps chemical impurities or the corrosion itself on\nthe daguerreotype got heated and left a small mark where the X-ray beam light\nwent through,\u201d Sham explains.\n\n## Each Daguerrotype is Unique\n\nInvented in 1839 and only popular for about 25 years, daguerreotypes are\nsilver-coated copper plates treated with specific chemicals such as bromine\ngas to make them light-sensitive.\n\nOnce placed in a camera, the cap would be removed to \u201cimpress\u201d the image on\nthe plates\u2014a time-consuming process. Then, the plates would be treated with\nmercury vapor to fix the images permanently.\n\nBecause the process does not involve the use of negatives, each daguerreotype\nphotograph is unique. As a result, the team\u2019s research could be a game-changer\nfor the conservation of these antiques.\n\nAccording to Phys.org>, Sham is returning to CLS for a follow-up study to\nlearn how to preserve the plates that protect daguerreotypes. This ongoing\nresearch will investigate the chemical composition of the tarnish, and how\nglass covers and frames that store daguerreotypes could affect deterioration.\n\nThe full study is published by The Journal of Cultural Heritage.\n\nImage credits: All photos via \u201cRetrieving images from tarnished daguerreotypes\nusing X-ray fluorescence imaging with an X-ray micro beam with tunable energy\u201d\nby Tsun-Kong Sham et al published in Journal of Cultural Heritage.\n\nAnalog, Culture, News, Technology\n\n19thcentury, daguerreotype, historicalphotos, photorestoration\n\nRelated Articles\n\nX-ray Beams Can Recover Lost 19th-Century Photos\n\nCreating a Daguerreotype Plate Using the Becquerel Method, From Start to\nFinish\n\nA Brief History of the Chemical Processes Used in Photography Over the Years\n\nA Moving Mole: Why Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Portrait Was Flipped for the $5 Bill\n\nDiscussion\n\nTrending Articles\n\nAdobe Introduces One of Its Most Significant Photoshop Updates Ever\n\nApr 23, 2024\n\nTourist Mauled by Bear After Rolling Down Car Window to Take Selfie With It\n\nApr 24, 2024\n\nCanon is Finally Letting Sigma and Tamron Make RF Mount Lenses\n\nApr 22, 2024\n\nHow a Photographer Captured His Spectacular Dream Eclipse Photo\n\nApr 21, 2024\n\nSony\u2019s $149 Custom Gridline Upgrade Has Arrived for Four Alpha Cameras\n\n21 hours ago\n\nReading mode: Light Dark\n\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc.
