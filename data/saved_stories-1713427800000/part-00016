Lawrence Detroit Free Press\n\nShow Caption\n\nHide Caption\n\nBill Ford on Ford Motor Company's values and culture\n\n\"How do we plan for the next 120 years in a way that my grandkids will have a\nstronger company than we have today?\"\n\nIn about 2005, Bill Ford determined that the future wasn\u2019t being invented in\nDetroit.\n\nIt was a time when he had joined the board of eBay and was traveling to\nSilicon Valley every month.\n\nThe best and the brightest and all that money and intensity were flowing\nthere, the Ford Motor Co. executive chair and great-grandson of Henry Ford\ntold a sold-out crowd at the Detroit Free Press \"Breakfast Club\" event\nWednesday morning at the Daxton Hotel in Birmingham.\n\nHe went to Tesla at that time and saw what was then a very crude sports car\nand thought it was interesting, but couldn\u2019t get anyone at his own company\ninterested in it. A few years later, he gave a TED Talk about the changes\ncoming to the industry and found it alarming that \u201cnothing was happening\nhere.\u201d\n\n## 'Your jaw will drop' when you enter the train station\n\nEventually, around 2018, the idea of remaking one of Detroit\u2019s landmarks, what\nthe rest of the world and many younger people in this region saw as a symbol\nof blight, came up in conversations, but he realized renovating Michigan\nCentral Station needed to be more than just a restoration.\n\n\u201cIt had to be the place where the future of transportation was reinvented one\nmore time and that the Motor City became the Motor City again,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a war for talent. Michigan is, our industry is, Ford is.\u201d\n\nAttracting people from the coasts is a challenge, and a nondescript workplace\nin the suburbs is a tough sell, he said.\n\nSo on June 6, when the train station reopens to the public, it will mean the\nreturn of a landmark that should help in the battle for talent as well as\nprovide the community with something to marvel at.\n\nWhen you walk in, Ford predicted, \u201cyour jaw will drop.\u201d\n\nIn an hourlong discussion with Carol Cain, who writes a column for the Free\nPress and hosts CBS Detroit's \"Michigan Matters\" program, Ford talked about\nthe train station and what its revival is intended to bring to Detroit. He\nalso addressed electric and self-driving vehicles and his thoughts on the\nkinds of leaders he admires. (Answer? Those who are genuine.)\n\n## 'We're not shoving anything down anyone's throat'\n\nThis moment for the auto industry is challenging, he said, describing\nwhipsawing from politicians in a soundbite-driven era. But ultimately, \u201cwe\nshouldn\u2019t let Washington decide,\u201d he said as Cain asked about an EV market\nthat has cooled a bit in the United States.\n\nFord noted that EVs will be the right equation for some customers, though not\nall, and this transition from gas-powered vehicles is coming, though perhaps\nnot as fast as some expected. He noted the much higher speed of adoption in\nEurope and China.\n\nBill Ford speaks with Carol Cain at Detroit Free Press Breakfast Club\n\nCarol Cain interviews Ford's Executive Chairman of Bill Ford during the\nDetroit Free Press Breakfast Club Series on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\n\nBut he pushed back against the idea that the company is pursuing a strategy at\nodds with what customers want.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not shoving anything down anyone\u2019s throat.\u201d And he talked up the\ncompany's investments in hybrids as well.\n\nIt was clear to him early on, Ford said, that this transition would happen in\nfits and starts.\n\nOn self-driving vehicles, Ford said the technology would continue to work its\nway into everyday vehicles over a much longer time frame than perhaps\ninitially predicted, which is probably a better option than all of the early\nhype suggested.\n\nBut driving is still fun for Ford, and he vowed that \u201cas long as I\u2019m alive,\nwe\u2019ll make Mustangs.\u201d\n\nIt just happens to be, Cain had noted, the 60th birthday of the Mustang, and\nFord will be taking his favorite, a 1964 Indy pace car that his uncle, Benson\nFord, had driven, for a cruise around Los Angeles with Jay Leno behind the\nwheel for an upcoming episode of the comedian\u2019s show, \"Jay Leno's Garage.\"\n\nFord, who will be inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in September, also\ndelivered messages for some students in attendance from Detroit\u2019s Pershing\nHigh School, telling them to follow their brains as well as their passions.\n\nAnd to the crowd of business leaders and others, he said metro Detroit has an\ningredient that many other places lack. Those other locations don\u2019t have the\npeople who will work night and day, caring about the community.\n\n\u201cPeople love our region, they love Detroit and they want to do everything they\ncan to make it better,\u201d he said.\n\nContact Eric D.
