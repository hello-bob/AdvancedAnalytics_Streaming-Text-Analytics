In a move that Senator Ron Wyden\ncondemned as \u201cterrifying\u201d, the House also doubled down on a surveillance\nauthority that has been used against American protesters, journalists and\npolitical donors in a chilling assault on free speech.\n\nSection 702 in its current form allows the government to compel communications\ngiants like Google and Verizon to turn over information. An amendment to the\nbill approved by the House vastly increases the law\u2019s scope. The Turner-Himes\namendment \u2013 so named for its champions Representatives Mike Turner and Jim\nHimes \u2013 would permit federal law enforcement to also force \u201cany other service\nprovider\u201d with access to communications equipment to hand over data. That\nmeans anyone with access to a wifi router, server or even phone \u2013 anyone from\na landlord to a laundromat \u2013 could be required to help the government spy.\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote on the House bill as soon as this week, and if\nit passes there, Joe Biden is likely to sign it. All Americans should be\nterrified by that prospect.\n\nSection 702 is supposedly a foreign intelligence tool that allows the US\ngovernment to surveil the communications of non-US citizens abroad without a\nwarrant. But as many civil liberties groups have pointed out, intelligence\nagencies like the FBI also use it as a warrantless spying tool against\nAmericans. The FBI abused its authority under the law no fewer than 300,000\ntimes in 2020 and 2021, according to a ruling from a Fisa court judge. In\narguing for the reauthorization of Section 702 late last year, Turner, chair\nof the House intelligence committee, shockingly suggested in a closed-door\nbriefing that the law could be used to spy on Americans protesting against the\nwar in Gaza.\n\nIt\u2019s not supposed to be that way. In most cases, the fourth amendment requires\nthe government to have a court-approved warrant to obtain an American\u2019s\ncommunications. But intelligence agencies have used Section 702 as a loophole\nthat allows them to vacuum up and comb through communications between an\nAmerican and a foreigner who can be targeted under the law \u2013 all without a\nwarrant.\n\nThe House didn\u2019t just fail to reform Section 702. It voted to grant\nintelligence agencies expansive new surveillance powers. The Turner-Himes\namendment would allow them to deputize ordinary Americans and businesses as\ngovernment spies. When privacy advocates raised alarms about the Stasi-like\npowers this would create, lawmakers like Himes brushed them off without a\nsubstantive response. The proposed expansion deserves an explanation. The US\ngovernment has a long history of abusing its existing surveillance powers. It\nwould be naive to think it wouldn\u2019t abuse new ones.\n\nWhile the Turner-Himes amendment lists some business types that are excepted\nfrom the requirement to help spy \u2013 like dwellings and restaurants \u2013 an almost\nlimitless number of entities that provide wifi or just have access to\nAmericans\u2019 devices could be roped into the government\u2019s surveillance\noperations. Using the wifi in your dentist office, hiring a cleaner who has\naccess to your laptop, or even storing communications equipment in an office\nyou rent could all expose you to increased risk of surveillance.\n\nThe Turner-Himes amendment would also make it harder to push back on abusive\nsurveillance practices, including those targeting first amendment rights.\nTake, for example, the surveillance of journalists. Big tech companies may\nsometimes resist government orders to spy on news outlets. They command armies\nof lawyers, receive Section 702 orders frequently, and have a commercial\nincentive to at least appear to care about their customers\u2019 privacy concerns.\nBut what hope could a news organization have that its cleaning crew, for\ninstance, will want to take on the federal government on its behalf?\n\nThe FBI\u2019s abuses of Section 702 violate Americans\u2019 privacy and often threaten\ntheir first amendment rights. A declassified report from 2023, for example,\nrevealed that the FBI had used Section 702 to investigate Black Lives Matter\nprotesters. Section 702 has also been used to spy on American journalists,\nweakening their first amendment right to report the news by undermining their\nability to speak with foreign sources confidentially \u2013 something reporters\nmust do frequently.\n\nIn response to these and other abuses, many reformers argue that Section 702\nshould be reauthorized only with real reforms that would rein in government\nspying, such as requiring the government to get a warrant before it can access\nAmericans\u2019 communications. Johnson himself initially attempted to weaken\nFisa\u2019s surveillance provisions in an effort to satisfy the hardline\nrightwingers in his caucus and Donald Trump. He did not succeed. The House\nvoted to reauthorize Section 702 without adding a warrant requirement.\n\nThe fact that Section 702 has been used so often against the exercise of first\namendment rights \u2013 including those of journalists \u2013 makes it both shocking and\ninexplicable that so many news outlets continue to support it. The Wall Street\nJournal, Washington Post and Chicago Tribune have all published editorials in\nrecent days cheering the demise of the warrant requirement and urging Congress\nto reauthorize the law. But the House vote wasn\u2019t just a reauthorization. It\nwas a drastic, draconian expansion of the government\u2019s surveillance powers.\n\nSome of these editorials scoff at Trump\u2019s recent nonsensical social media post\ncriticizing Section 702 and frame the anti-surveillance crowd as a ragtag\nbunch of fringe rightwingers, ignoring that lawmakers and civil liberties\norganizations across the political spectrum opposed extending Fisa without\nreforming it. They also ignore the real threats Section 702 poses to\nAmericans\u2019 privacy rights and first amendment interests, especially if a\nfuture administration is determined to surveil and chill its opponents.\n\nThankfully, it\u2019s not too late for the Senate to prevent these future abuses.\nIn the face of the pervasive past misuse of Section 702, the last thing\nAmericans need is a large expansion of government surveillance. The Senate\nshould reject the House bill and refuse to reauthorize Section 702 without a\nwarrant requirement. Lawmakers must demand reforms to put a stop to\nunjustified government spying on Americans.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * House of Representatives\n  * Surveillance\n  * Fisa court\n  * US politics\n  * comment\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
