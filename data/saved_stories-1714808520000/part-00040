The changes to the Asylum Act\nas well as associated regulations are expected to come into force on April 1,\n2025.\n\nAccording to information previously provided by the government, the new tasks\nsuch as scanning data carriers, temporarily storing data and evaluating it\nwill be done by employees in the six federal asylum centres. It is assumed\nthat this will require additional staff \u2013 six additional full-time positions\nand a further six part-time.\n\n\\+ Read more: Switzerland pilots 24-hour asylum process\n\n## Five analyses per day\n\nOn average, almost three-quarters of asylum seekers in recent years have not\nprovided any identification documents. For around half of them, the government\nassumes that various data carriers could be analysed in the future, as stated\nin the report on the corresponding legal amendment.\n\nBased on the long-term average of 20,000 asylum applications per year, it can\ntherefore be assumed that an average of five evaluations will be carried out\nper asylum centre per working day. The current number of asylum applications\nis significantly higher.\n\n\\+ Read more: failed Eritrean asylum seekers under scrutiny\n\n## Proportionality under scrutiny\n\nIn the medium and long term, however, the government expects the new\nevaluation options to save costs. It also said the early availability of\nadditional information on identity, nationality or travel route could speed up\nsome asylum procedures.\n\nAsylum seekers should only have to hand over their electronic data carriers if\ntheir identity, nationality or travel route cannot be established on the basis\nof identity documents or in any other way. According to the rules, SEM must\nfirst carry out a proportionality check for each individual case. The law does\nnot provide for the compulsory handing over of a data carrier.\n\nAdapted from German by DeepL/kp\n\nThis news story has been written and carefully fact-checked by an external\neditorial team.
