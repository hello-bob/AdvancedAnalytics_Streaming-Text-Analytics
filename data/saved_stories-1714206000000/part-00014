It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d We were wandering down Market Street in San\nFrancisco, after sundown. Despite the towering buildings looming over us,\ndesigned to host tens of thousands of people, the streets were quiet and\nempty. Except, of course, for the shadowy figure shuffling around without\ndirection on the other side of the street, and the occasional and deeply\nunnerving scream.\n\nThere is no shortage of anecdotes about Americans who visit Europe for the\nfirst time and are shocked to discover streets that are safe at night, food\nthat is tastier yet healthier, and large cities that are nonetheless beautiful\nand walkable. The reverse is much rarer, if only because true Europeans don\u2019t\nwrite about their experiences on the internet in English. As a dual European-\nAmerican citizen from birth, I have spent roughly half my life in North\nAmerica and half in Europe, so neither continent is capable of giving me\nculture shock. The same was not true of my wife, a true European whom I was\nhazing with a not-so-grand tour of the great cities of the United States of\nAmerica.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call an Uber up there, okay?\u201d Even for me, the haunted atmosphere was a\nbit much and significantly worse than I remembered from just a few years\nbefore. But there were clearly people in the distance ahead of us, I thought,\nso we shouldn\u2019t inordinately frighten ourselves. But, fast-walking forward, it\ndidn\u2019t take us long to realize that those weren\u2019t tourists or late-night\nshoppers strolling down from Union Square, but what must have been a hundred\nhomeless people hanging out, sprawled out on the pavement, and doing drugs.\nMany Europeans, my wife included, will gripe incessantly about the alleged\nlack of public safety and order in Europe. Suffice it to say, she has not\nmentioned it a single time since visiting San Francisco\u2014on paper, one of the\nrichest cities in the richest country in the world.\n\n### Comparing the World\u2019s Paper Wealth\n\nThe discrepancy between America\u2019s paper wealth and its real wealth is not\nsomething that can be ignored when comparing America\u2019s wealthiness to the rest\nof the world, especially Europe and East Asia. Since 2008, nominal U.S. GDP\nhas outpaced that of the European Union to the point that the EU is now just\ntwo-thirds the economy that the U.S. is, rather than the prior near-parity.\nU.S. nominal GDP per capita is nearing Singapore\u2019s, while all of Europe except\nfor small rich states like Norway or Monaco are significantly behind. After a\ndecade of sluggish growth, Europe\u2019s fortunes compared to America\u2019s took\nanother sharp turn for the worse following the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and then\nthe 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut these aren\u2019t reasons for American triumphalism, let alone reasons to claim\nthat America is now unfathomably wealthier than Europe. To begin with, just\nlooking at more numbers makes the picture far less dramatic. Europe\u2019s GDP was\nalso one-third smaller than the United States\u2019 in 2000, before growing to\nparity by 2008 and again falling behind. Simply adjusting for purchasing power\nto remove the distortions caused by exchange rate fluctuations takes the GDP\nper capita of Germany\u2014the largest country and economy in Europe\u2014from less than\ntwo-thirds of America\u2019s to nearly 90% of it. By this metric, the EU as a whole\nwas 75% as affluent as the U.S. in 2022.\n\nThe OECD gives less favorable, but still fathomable, figures: in 2021, the\naverage household in the European Union had 61% of the gross disposable income\nof the average household in the United States. Germany was at 77% of the U.S.\nfigure. Then again, the same numbers say that Japan is poorer than Lithuania\nand that South Korea is poorer than Portugal. We might want to take the\nsignificance of such numbers with a grain of salt. The gap between what\nstatistics purport to capture and what they actually capture means we can use\nthem as pieces of evidence, but we still require a principled model of reality\nin which to fit and judge them\u2014as well as interaction with reality itself.\n\nMoney, wealth, and value are three related but different things that are easy\nto confuse with each other. Money is what you use to exchange wealth, that is,\nactual goods or services, from which you then derive some tangible or\nintangible value. The traditional view of wealth is that it is not just about\nhaving money, but also about having that money go somewhere, far enough to\nprovide a certain amount of value from a certain amount of wealth. Gold and\njewels, but also cattle, fields, spices, exotic fruits, glittering palaces,\nlarge estates, rare books, leisurely afternoons, beautiful wives, healthy\nchildren, loyal friends, dutiful servants, and so on. It\u2019s why you can say the\naverage inhabitant of a developed country today is in some ways richer than\nChinese Emperors used to be.\n\nWe can update the list somewhat for the modern day, but the principle of\nhaving a holistic definition of wealth independent from mere money remains.\nThere is arguably already such an updated modern-day definition, which we term\n\u201cquality of life\u201d and, ironically, is something Americans far more readily\nadmit is superior in Europe. To say that the \u201cquality of life is higher\u201d in\nEurope because there is less work, less crime, less driving, better and\nhealthier food, and more beautiful people and buildings, is just to list a\nbunch of ways that Europeans are collectively wealthier than Americans, but\nframed in a specific way to prevent this wealth from being accounted.\n\nOne can derive value from wealth without being its owner, which is the more\nimportant facet of wealthiness when comparing continent-sized societies of\nhundreds of millions of people, rather than two particular individuals. We\nrecognize that the children of the wealthy are themselves wealthy too, if only\nthrough their parents\u2019 doting rather than paper ownership of assets. Based on\nthe same principle, we can recognize that public wealth also exists and ought\nto be factored in when making comparisons of societies. Just because public\nwealth is more difficult to measure, apportion, or liquidate than individual\nwealth or one\u2019s personal bank account does not make it less real or relevant,\nnot least because such wealth is necessarily made possible only through many\nacts of individual sacrifice and effort orchestrated by unique social\ntechnology.\n\nIn addition to adjusting for purchasing power and disposable income, an easy\nway to get closer to a real comparison of affluence is to adjust for hours\nworked, which lets you guess at leisure time, one of the most obviously\ndesirable forms of wealth. According to The Economist, when adjusting for\npurchasing power and hours worked in 2022, the two most affluent countries by\nfar are Norway and Luxembourg. Once you add in Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland,\nAustria, and Sweden\u2014all the other countries ranked higher than the U.S.\u2014you\nare no longer talking about one or two small and unrepresentative rich\ncountries, but 52 million Europeans who are more affluent than the U.S.\naverage. Perhaps we should think of these countries, collectively, as\n\u201cEurope\u2019s California,\u201d rather than a few irrelevant and unrelated Vermonts. In\nany case, the 83 million Germans are at 97% of the U.S. figure, while the 68\nmillion French are at 93% of it. Another chart, measuring net household\ndisposable income in 2021 adjusted for actual individual consumption,\npurchasing power parity, and hours worked, found that Germany was the highest\nat 87% of the U.S. figure, followed by France at 85%, and Belgium at 85%.\n\nBoth sets of figures clash with our assumptions in other interesting ways. For\nexample, the United Kingdom and Italy are roughly on par with each other and\nboth far below Germany or France, the powerhouses of the continent. But\nCanada\u2014America\u2019s little brother\u2014is below any of them! Despite vigorous catch-\nup growth since the fall of communism, Eastern Europe is still only about half\nas affluent as America. The highest-ranked former communist country is\nSlovenia, which is on par with Spain. The largest, Poland, is between 46% and\n58% of the U.S. figure, depending on the chart. Then again, maybe we shouldn\u2019t\nbe so dismissive, given that these countries were actually unfathomably poorer\nthan the United States just one-and-a-half generations ago. As a kid in\nformerly communist Europe, I still remember washing myself in a bathtub with\ncold water. But there is a nice hot shower there now\u2014and even air\nconditioning! I like to joke that, when seeing ugly communist apartment blocks\ntoday, you should remember that the post-communist GDP increases all went into\nthe insides of buildings rather than their outsides.\n\nIt is also worth noting that economic inequality is simply higher in the\nUnited States, which means the European numbers will more coherently apply to\nthe societies they are intended to represent. This inequality is usually\narticulated as a negative thing by commentators, as if the U.S. does not take\ncare of its poor people, but it is equally because the much more dynamic U.S.\neconomy produces more genuinely very wealthy people per capita\u2014more outlier\nmulti-millionaires and billionaires\u2014than any European country. Income\ninequality in the U.S. is higher than any country in Europe, even Russia.\nWealth inequality is higher than all European countries except Russia and\nesoterically inegalitarian Sweden.\n\nAccording to UBS\u2019 Global Wealth Report for 2023, the mean wealth per adult in\nthe U.S. was higher than any surveyed country in the world except Switzerland.\nBut the median wealth per adult was the same as Spain or Italy! Here it was\nBelgium that came in first place, with both France and the United Kingdom\npulling ahead of the U.S., though notably with Germany and Sweden falling far\nbehind. No statistic is a perfect substitute for an informed generalist\nappraisal, and different statistics tend to disagree with each other on exact\nrankings. But it is safe to say that the statistics themselves make the notion\nthat the United States is unfathomably wealthier than Europe\nuntenable\u2014something that can also be verified by just visiting.\n\n### City Life is a Way to Measure Wealth\n\nI can hardly speak for rural life, since I have never lived in the countryside\nfor any substantial period of time. But given that well over half the\npopulations of both the U.S. and every European country live in urban areas,\nit is urban and suburban life that is more relevant to compare. In my\nexperience, one cannot find the amenities typical of even mid-sized and\nsecond-tier European cities anywhere in America except Manhattan and perhaps a\nfew small and select neighborhoods in other top-tier U.S. cities. Most of\nAmerica is, in fact, defined by highways and strip malls and this, in fact,\nsucks\u2014which is why nobody ever seriously defends it on its own merits, but\njust claims it is the legitimate result of the impersonal hand of the market\nsatisfying consumer demand. In Europe, it is unremarkable to live in a city\nwhere you can leisurely accomplish all conceivable errands by foot or,\nperhaps, by jumping onto a bicycle or tram. Density and walkability energize\nsocial life and ubiquitous low-commitment bars, caf\u00e9s, eateries, parks, and\neven nightclubs make spontaneity possible.\n\nEven where such amenities are available in America, not gated by miles of\ndriving, one is not as free to use them due to rampant crime. In Europe, urban\ncrime is more of a regional phenomenon, rising higher in Southern Italy or the\nhigh-immigration cities of France, Sweden, and England, but leaving even large\nand dense cities like Amsterdam, Madrid, Copenhagen, Warsaw, or Munich safer\nthan Salt Lake City. In America, crime is a national phenomenon, far more\ncommon than in Europe, and far more violent. In 2022, the U.S. had an\nintentional homicide rate of 6.4 murders per 100,000 people, just above Yemen\nand below Zimbabwe in the rankings. France, Sweden, and England were all at\nabout 1.1 murders, and most of Europe is lower still, such as Germany at 0.8\nor Italy at 0.5. America is literally ten times more violent than some\nEuropean countries and still more than five times as violent as some of the\nlargest ones. If one is unable to derive value from some item of wealth,\npublic or private, due to the risk of intentional injury or death, then one is\nnot being made wealthier by it.\n\nAmerica does not lack its own forms of public wealth, some that are even\nunthinkable to Europeans, like the national parks or vast tracts of public\nland. One could say, provocatively, that while Europe\u2019s public wealth rests\nmainly on social technology, America\u2019s rests mainly on its surplus of land.\nThe EU is three times as dense as the U.S. in terms of population, which might\ngo a way towards explaining why American dwellings are three times larger than\nEuropean ones.\n\nBut overall, it is hard to say that America is significantly wealthier than\nEurope, or vice versa. As someone who has had one foot in each continent his\nwhole life, Europe and America seem roughly equally as wealthy. That Europeans\ndon\u2019t use dryers or air conditioners is as absurd and impoverished, in my\nmind, as that Americans nonchalantly become obese through copious consumption\nof sugar water or evacuate from downtown urban areas at night due to crime and\ndisorder. The American advantage in earning hard cash, in practice, just seems\nto be undercut or balanced out by the American disadvantage in public wealth,\nand the reverse is true for Europe.\n\n### Papering Over Impoverishment to Turn Back the Political Clock\n\nThe debate over whether America or Europe is more affluent is a relatively new\none and one that is brought up by only one side of the debate and always in\nthe same context: Americans trying to flex on Europe in order to gin up\npatriotic sentiment on behalf of America\u2019s incumbent political and economic\ninstitutions. American populism, as represented by Donald Trump, outrageously\ndeclared that America was not a great and wealthy country, but \u201clike a Third\nWorld country\u201d that needed immediate and sweeping reforms in trade, industry,\nimmigration, and infrastructure to live up to its economic potential.\n\nThe idea that the unreformed America of today is an untrammeled economic\nsuccess is the consensus narrative under which the remnants of this defeated\npopulism are cleaned up and recuperated, and a reversion to the contentless\nand jingoistic norm that prevailed before widespread internet usage. To\nquestion America\u2019s economic performance is taken as a lack of patriotism, as\nif \u201cthe economy\u201d were itself the country, or as if only a socialist could\nnotice the merits of European social democracy.\n\nThe debate is also, therefore, an omen of what the consensus of America\u2019s\nincumbent elites has in mind for Europe\u2019s future. Today, Europe is still not\nsignificantly poorer than the United States. But it is now on a trajectory to\nbecome significantly poorer, in part because of an ideologically-motivated,\nheavily U.S.-backed proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, which has cost Europe\nits previous energy strategy of piping in cheap Russian gas. In Europe, there\nwas no Plan B, just a rationalization of decline as environmentally-friendly\n\u201cdegrowth.\u201d In Washington, nobody cares about European prosperity; helping to\ndestroy it may even be an opportunity! It is this downward trajectory, rather\nthan the current reality, that America\u2019s jingoists are gleefully celebrating\nwhen they gloat about GDP figures. They know the figures don\u2019t really check\nout\u2014yet. But they are looking forward to the day they do, since this will\njustify further U.S. interventions in Europe on the basis of the superiority\nof the American model of society.\n\nIt is however a mistake for America to want Europe to fail. Many of the same\nforces that will drive Europe\u2019s economic decline will also drive America\u2019s:\nlow fertility rates, an aging population, ideological opposition to growing\nenergy usage, inflexible and increasingly fragile institutions beset by\nsuccession failure, post-industrial exhaustion and the resulting lack of\nvision\u2014all against the backdrop of a still economically rising China. Europe\nis not a cautionary tale for America, but the canary in the coal mine.\n\nIn many poor countries, there is no amount of money that can buy you the\namenities of the developed world. Some items of wealth, even basic things like\nfood that won\u2019t make you ill, are beyond the capability of those societies to\nprovide at any price. This is well understood when thinking of the value of a\nU.S. dollar in developing countries such as Brazil or South Africa. Rather\nthan justifying the status quo, we should ask ourselves what things no amount\nof money could buy even in the developed world today.\n\nMarko Jukic is a Senior Analyst at Bismarck Analysis.
