After the recent attacks on privacy tools and anonymous\ntransactions, it is time to delve in deeper into where we stand in terms of\nprivacy, CBDCs and potential ways to opt out. The gates are closing faster\nthan expected, and before too long they will be shut so tight our children\nwill not even understand what \u201cprivacy\u201d means when it comes to transactions.\n\nIn the last two weeks, we have seen an unprecedented crackdown on privacy\ntools and \u201ccrypto\u201d in general.\n\nThere has been a concerted effort from US and EU authorities to take down\nprivacy enhancing software, specifically so-called \u201cmixers\u201d or \u201ccoinjoin\u201d\nservices. In case you\u2019re not familiar with the terminology, here\u2019s a\nbreakdown:\n\n> A CoinJoin collects the inputs of many users, and broadcasts them into many\n> outputs in a single transaction, whereas a mixer sends your bitcoins through\n> a series of transactions with a variable number of inputs and outputs,\n> before it is sent back to you in another address, or imported into a wallet\n> as a private key. \u2014 Source\n\nThe most important difference between a mixer and a CoinJoin service, is that\nthe latter is non-custodial, meaning: the software service you\u2019re interacting\nwith never holds or custodies your funds.\n\nCentralized mixers take possession and custody of funds, which would\neffectively qualify as a Money Transmitter service. The case for non-custodial\nCoinJoins or smart contracts \u2014 as in the case of Tornado Cash on Ethereum \u2014\nbeing money transmitter businesses or a \u201cmoney laundering\u201d business, is a lot\nless obvious. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\n##\n\nTornado Cash\n\nThe first big case around one of the most used privacy services in crypto was\nTornado Cash. Tornado Cash was a decentralized non-custodial protocol that\nenabled users to perform private transactions in the crypto-space.\n\nTornado Cash developer Alex Pertsev was first jailed in the Netherlands, \u2014\nthis Mara\u2019s fatherland of all places \u2014 in August 2022 shortly after the\nplatform was blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe Treasury Department alleged that Tornado Cash had been a key tool for the\nNorth Korean hacking group (Lazarus Group), tied to a $625 million hack of\nAxie Infinity\u2019s Ronin Network, among other issues.\n\nProtestors on the Dam Square in Amsterdam calling for Pertsev\u2019s release\n\nDutch prosecutors doing the U.S. Treasury\u2019s dirty work, accused Alex Pertsev\nof laundering $1.2 billion worth of crypto through the anonymizing tool\nTornado Cash, and seek a 64-month jail sentence (verdict is due May 14).\n\nTornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Roman Semenov face similar allegations\nin the U.S. and knowing the U.S.\u2019s sentencing, they could face up to longer\nsentences than Pertsev in the Netherlands if convicted.\n\nBut did these developers launder this money themselves? No. They never had\ncustody over the funds. It would be the same thing as saying Apple enables\ncrimes because criminals used Apple products to conduct them. Or that the\nInternet Service Provider (ISP) would be liable because criminals used that\nparticular internet connection.\n\nTornado Cash was an open protocol, and never held any of the funds in custody\n\u2014 if you\u2019re interested in the details, this is a good explanation of how these\nsmart contract transactions worked in practice.\n\n##\n\nSamourai Wallet\n\nLast month, Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill were\narrested and charged with conspiracy to money laundering and conspiracy to\noperate an unlicensed money service business in the Southern District Court of\nNew York.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Samourai Wallet \u201cfacilitated more than $100\nMillion in money laundering transactions from illegal dark web markets\u201d.\n\nThe developers face up to 25 years in prison for writing code.\n\nOnly 5% of Samourai transactions ($100 million USD) are alleged criminal money\nlaundering. Benchmark that to the 2-5% of global GDP which is laundered each\nyear according to Europol, and it quickly becomes clear that the name of this\ngame is not to fight \u201cmoney laundering\u201d, but to shut down as many privacy\nenabling tools in the digital toolkit as possible.\n\nThese arrests and recent announcements from US authorities cast a doubt on\nwhether self-custodial wallet providers, or even Lightning nodes could be\nconsidered Money Services Businesses and be regulated as such.\n\nAfter the Samourai Wallet arrests, the FBI issued a Public Service\nAnnouncement with an \u201cAlert on Cryptocurrency Money Services Businesses\u201d:\n\n> A few simple steps can prevent unintentional use of non-compliant services.\n> For example, avoid cryptocurrency money transmitting services that do not\n> collect know your customer (KYC) information from customers when required. -\n> Source\n\nLol.\n\nYou can quickly see why this is flawed logic: Joe asks Bob to pay Alice. If\nBob pays Alice with a couple of 100 dollar bills that he got from Joe, which\nare all private transactions, suddenly Bob is running a money transmitting\nservice and he would be non-compliant because he didn\u2019t KYC Joe. Derp.\n\nIn the above example Bob would even be more of a money transmitter than\nSamourai, since he actually had the cash in his possession before paying\nAlice.\n\nThere is no way to replicate the functionality of a CoinJoin with cash.\n\nUnfortunately, even though many of the applications built on top of Bitcoin\nare labeled as decentralized \u2014 which Samourai effectively was since users\nnever gave up control over their coins \u2014 the degree to their decentralization\nsuddenly becomes very clear once there\u2019s a DOJ indictment testing the waters\nof this supposed decentralization: websites and protocols go offline, apps\ndisappear out of App Stores and it practically becomes impossible for the\nlayman to interact with these protocols or services. So much for\ndecentralization.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that cash is more anonymous in that sense that there is no ledger\nwhere authorities could check if that transaction actually took place.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if in the future, core devs will decided to go fully\nanonymous while building their applications, since there is no benefit to\nexposure, as the above cases have clearly shown.\n\nThis post on X is a great summary on why there\u2019s reason to worry:\n\n> Given all of these plain facts, it is not unreasonable or over the top to\n> suspect that you\u2019re seeing the beginning of a crackdown on Bitcoin and its\n> users in general.\n>\n> To not have concerns that are almost certainly valid is not only jaw\n> droppingly na\u00efve, but it shows a surprising absence of knowledge of both\n> ancient and recent history and current events, like Australia calling for\n> Elon Musk\u2019s arrest, and Brazil attacking X, and the constant trickle of\n> state attacks on Gab, (not Bitcoin related but clear government overreach)\n> or the very related threat of the EU creating the fake, \u201cUnhosted Wallet\u201d\n> category, in a clear attempt to outlaw self custody.\n\nThe fear in the Bitcoin industry after the Samourai Wallet arrest spread\nquickly to other privacy tools built around Bitcoin.\n\nPhoenix Wallet decided to pull out of US app stores, and Wasabi Wallet\nannounced it was shutting down its CoinJoin coordination service zkSNACKs,\nwhich leaves only one privacy tool on Bitcoin still standing (Joinmarket)\n\n##\n\nOther crackdowns\n\nBesides these targeted attacks on privacy tools around Bitcoin, the SEC has\nalso gone after Uniswap, Robinhood, and other platforms in the last 2 weeks,\nall related to the crypto sphere.\n\nRoger Ver was arrested in Spain and is being extradited to the US to face\ntrial over not paying taxes on dividends through US (Bitcoin related)\ncompanies. Binance\u2019s CZ was sentenced to 4 months in jail for money laundering\nafter cooperating with the US justice department.\n\nBy now it should be absolutely clear that the US is \u201ccleaning house\u201d after the\nBitcoin ETF launch, making sure to fence off the future on- and offramps for\ncrypto services as much as possible. You shouldn\u2019t be able to opt out, anon.\n\nChristine Lagarde of the ECB with a super creepy video, voicing her happy New\nYear\u2019s resolutions around the Digital Euro.\n\nKeep stacking sats and withdraw these into personal wallets with private keys\nyou control, before potential regulations make it harder to do so.\n\nDepending on how you obtain your Bitcoin, in most cases this will still be\nlinked to your identity (since you probably withdrew them from a centralized\nexchange that forced you to go through KYC-procedures), but at least those\ncoins will be fully in your control.\n\nFor even more privacy on the base layer, there is a reason why Monero is\nactively being delisted from most major exchanges.\n\nKraken is one of the last big exchanges to offer XMR trading \u2014 which tells you\nthat the privacy enabled transactions by default actually work a little too\nwell. Kraken will be forced to delist Monero later this year in multiple EU\ncountries, and it is just a matter of time before it will be delisted\ncompletely.\n\nBinance had already delisted XMR earlier this year. Coinbase and others had\ndelisted it a long time ago, out of fear of repercussions.\n\nThat leaves a few smaller exchanges, and a p2p market, but not much else.\n\nI\u2019ve gone over the case for owning some XMR before, not from any store of\nvalue perspective like with Bitcoin, but purely as digital cash in the future\nif you happen to ever need it. You never know when you will, and when you do,\nit might be too late.\n\n#### CBDCs and Future Black Markets\n\nBowTiedMara\n\n\u00b7\n\nMarch 16, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nEven though this Patagonian rodent could be labelled as a Bitcoin maxi, I have\nto say that unfortunately at this moment, 100% privacy on Bitcoin is too\ncomplicated for most non tech-savvy users, except if you mine it yourself\n(which requires a large investment).\n\nThe EU and the US (and most OECD countries like them), will only increase\ntheir crackdown on digital privacy.\n\nEU: Let\u2019s regulate some more things to death soon! - Source\n\nThe craziness of eternal KYC and AML will only become worse.\n\nIn \u201cChokePoint 2.0\u201d, Calvin Froedge describes exactly how bad it can get, even\nif you have nothing to with any crypto-related services or products:\n\n> despite what they tell you, it isn\u2019t criminals they\u2019re going after. They\u2019re\n> going after you, and me, and everyone else. Every single person operating in\n> the modern financial system is now subject to the arbitrary whim of random\n> officials and automated account flags. People are being funneled into\n> narrower and more restricted systems where the amounts they can transact,\n> and who they can transact with, is more tightly controlled with each passing\n> day.\n>\n> [...] The choice for freedom is so clear. Another passport won\u2019t make you\n> free. Another place won\u2019t make you free. The only choice we have is to stand\n> and fight - to finally accept that our comfortable lives may become less\n> comfortable.\n>\n> \u2014 Calvin Froedge in \u201cOpting Out\u201d\n\nFor now the only way to opt out at least partially for most people is by using\ntools that allow you to do so. For now that is cash, and some of the options I\ndiscussed above.\n\n##\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOne of the best breakdowns of why privacy is necessary in the Digital Age was\ncondensed in the intro paragraphs of the Cypherpunk Manifesto (1993):\n\n> Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is\n> not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world\n> to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know.\n> Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.\n>\n> If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of their\n> interaction. Each party can speak about their own memory of this; how could\n> anyone prevent it? One could pass laws against it, but the freedom of\n> speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to an open society; we seek\n> not to restrict any speech at all. If many parties speak together in the\n> same forum, each can speak to all the others and aggregate together\n> knowledge about individuals and other parties. The power of electronic\n> communications has enabled such group speech, and it will not go away merely\n> because we might want it to.\n>\n> Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a transaction\n> have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for that\n> transaction. Since any information can be spoken of, we must ensure that we\n> reveal as little as possible. In most cases personal identity is not\n> salient. When I purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk,\n> there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my electronic mail provider to\n> send and receive messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking\n> or what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider only need\n> know how to get the message there and how much I owe them in fees. When my\n> identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have\n> no privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal\n> myself.\n>\n> Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction\n> systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous\n> transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system\n> empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when\n> desired; this is the essence of privacy.\n\nThis still rings true today, and in fact, it has only become more important as\ndigital surveillance and KYC and AML have penetrated every inch of our digital\nfootprint.\n\nFighting the system is something residents in Argentina are better prepped for\nthan residents in most other countries. I wrote about that here, explaining\nwhy Argentina is such an ideal place for people like me \u2014 and maybe not for\nothers, and that\u2019s perfectly okay:\n\n#### The Case for Slightly Dysfunctional States\n\nBowTiedMara\n\n\u00b7\n\nMarch 9, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Digital Migrants & Coercive Immobility\n\nBowTiedMara\n\n\u00b7\n\nJuly 7, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nOnline privacy is important, and if we want to maintain the same levels of\nfreedom as we have had up until now (which are slowly eroding), there is a\nreal need to fight back.\n\nFor me, one way of doing so is using the options that Argentine society offers\non a day to day basis.\n\nSee you in the Jungle, anon!\n\nBowTiedMara is a reader-supported publication.
