The\ntool uses generative AI to summarize PDFs and answer questions about them.\nAccording to Adobe\u2019s FAQ, the assistant is based at least in part on OpenAI\u2019s\ntechnology.\n\nRight now, Acrobat\u2019s AI Assistant is in beta and hasn\u2019t been fully rolled out.\nFor example, it was enabled by default in my Acrobat Online account (which I\nrarely use), but it\u2019s not available in my desktop version of Acrobat Pro. It\nwas also showing up in PDFs I opened using the Chrome Acrobat plug-in. The\nfeature isn\u2019t (yet) available on the mobile apps.\n\nI frequently deal with PDFs for clients. I treat these as confidential, so I\ndon\u2019t want to feed those to Adobe\u2019s LLM, nor do I want it to process my own\nPDFs.\n\nThis morning, I opened a PDF in Chrome using the Acrobat plug-in, and an AI-\ngenerated summarization of the document showed up in the top-right corner of\nthe display. I was surprised at that, because the last time I checked my\naccount, the tool hadn\u2019t been rolled out to me and Acrobat\u2019s FAQ says the\nassistant won\u2019t process any documents until the user explicitly opts in once\n(on any document) \u2014 which I haven\u2019t done. That sent me down a minor rabbit\nhole to figure out how to turn the thing off.\n\n# Turning AI Assistant Off in the Acrobat Pro or Reader\n\nAs I said earlier, my copy of Acrobat Pro (which is up-to-date from Creative\nCloud) does not include the AI Assistant feature. So these instructions and\nscreenshot come from Adobe\u2019s documentation of the feature.\n\nFrom the Edit menu, open Preferences and look for a section titled Generative\nAI. If it\u2019s present, there will be an check box where you can turn the\nassistant off. Uncheck that box and select OK.\n\n# Turning AI Assistant Off in the Acrobat Online\n\nAcrobat Online lets you work with PDFs that you\u2019ve uploaded to Adobe\u2019s cloud\nstorage, which I don\u2019t use. When I opened Acrobat Online today for the first\ntime in forever, I found that the generative AI feature was enabled. To turn\nit off, click on your profile icon in the top right corner and click settings.\nOn the Settings dialog, there is a a section labelled \u201cGenerative AI\u201d with a\ncheckbox to enable those features. It\u2019s checked by default. Uncheck it, and\nsave the dialog.\n\n# Turning AI Assistant Off in Acrobat\u2019s Chrome Plug-in ... or not\n\nAdobe\u2019s Acrobat plug-in for Chrome has the option to tell the browser to open\nPDFs using the plug-in. This is where I first found the AI Assistant showing\nup, but I could not find a way to turn it in the plug-in. There\u2019s no\n\u201cGenerative AI\u201d option in the plug-in settings. Turning AI Assistant off in my\nonline account didn\u2019t work for the plug-in. What I wound up doing was\ndisabling the option to have Chrome use the Acrobat plug-in for PDFs.\n\nRight-click on the plug-in icon and choose options. On the options page that\nopens, turn off the \u201cOpen PDFs in Acrobat\u201d radio button and click \u201cSave\npreferences\u201d. Once you do that, Chrome will handle PDFs itself. As a bonus,\nit\u2019s easier to grab the PDF\u2019s URL this way.\n\n# Turning off Adobe\u2019s Content Analysis\n\nWhile you\u2019re at it, you may also want to opt out of Adobe\u2019s content analysis,\nwhich they say uses machine learning to analyze documents you\u2019ve stored in\ntheir cloud. To opt-out of this, go to your Adobe account online, open the\n\u201cData and privacy settings\u201d page, and turn off the \u201cAllow my content to be\nanalyzed by Adobe...\u201d option.\n\n# Wrapping up\n\nThose are the places I\u2019ve found to turn off Acrobat\u2019s new AI features.
