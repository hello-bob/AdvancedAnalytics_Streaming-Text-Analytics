And\nlimit who can make updates to sensitive files like your Actions workflows with\nthe public beta of push rules.\n\nYou can now enable a new type of ruleset that allows you to control pushes to\nrepositories based on file extensions, file path lengths, file and folder\npaths and file sizes. Push rules don\u2019t require any branch targeting as they\napply to every push to the repository, and also apply to all forks of the repo\nto ensure all pushes to the repository network are protected.\n\nPush rules are now available for private and internal repositories for GitHub\nTeams, and across organizations for GitHub Enterprise Cloud.\n\nLearn more about push rules in our documentation and join the community\ndiscussion to leave feedback.\n\n## CodeQL for Visual Studio Code documentation is now on docs.github.com\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n  * codeql\n  * security-and-compliance\n  * vs-code\n\nThe CodeQL for Visual Studio Code documentation is now on docs.github.com.\n\nThis migrates the content from https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-\nvisual-studio-code and provides a consistent, single-site experience with\nimproved text, descriptions, images, and navigation.\n\nOn May 8, 2024, we\u2019ll begin automatically redirecting from the original\ncodeql.github.com location to the new location.\n\nThe source files now exist in Markdown format in the public, open-source docs\nrepository.

As part of this\nrelease, GitHub Importer has implemented a new method for git source migration\nthat will provide users with improved reliability and more detailed error\nhandling when migrating git source repositories to GitHub. Click here to\nimport your project to GitHub.\n\nAs previously communicated, this change comes with the ending of support for\nthe REST API endpoints for source imports. Moving forward, these endpoints\nwill return an error. Users are encouraged to make use of the new import\nrepository page instead.\n\nLastly, we previously announced that GitHub Importer will no longer support\nimporting Mercurial, Subversion and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)\nrepositories. Effective today, we\u2019ve ended support for this functionality due\nto extremely low levels of usage. Moving from these alternative version\ncontrol systems to Git is simple thanks to fantastic open source tools \u2013 for\nmore details, read our Docs article, \u201cUsing the command line to import source\ncode\u201d.\n\nSee more\n\nView all changes\n\n## Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nCode with confidence.
