Through fermentation of raw ingredients like soybeans or rice, A.\noryzae helps to bring us soy sauce, sake and several other traditional Asian\nfoods. It does so by breaking down proteins and starches so that other\nmicrobes can finish off the fermentations.\n\nBut A. oryzae wasn\u2019t always so obliging. The wild version of the mold makes\npotent toxins that can poison the consumer and lead to cancer in the liver and\nother organs. Plus, it\u2019s a destructive agricultural pest that causes millions\nof dollars in damage each year to crops like peanuts and corn.\n\nThe food fermenter Aspergillus oryzae (left) is thought to be a domesticated\nversion of Aspergillus flavus (right), which makes aflatoxins that can\ncontaminate crops, poison people and cause cancer. The two colonies shown here\nare visually quite different, but the forms of these two molds vary widely,\nmaking it hard to tell them apart.\n\nCREDIT: JOHN GIBBONS / VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY\n\nWhat changed? Research is steadily revealing how the fungus transformed from a\ndangerous, toxic mold into a superior tool of food biotechnology that thrives\nin human-made environments. And as scientists study A. oryzae, they\u2019re\nlearning more about the process of domestication in microbes in general \u2014\nwhich still remains in many ways mysterious.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything we know comes from plants and animals,\u201d microbial\ngenomicist John Gibbons of UMass Amherst says of domestication. \u201cYou can see\nthe difference between dogs and wolves, between corn and teosinte, but you\ncan\u2019t really see the differences between microbes ... because most of it is\nchanges in metabolism.\u201d\n\n## A master digester\n\nA. oryzae belongs to a family of fungi in a larger group known as the blue and\ngreen molds. Some 40 percent of the family\u2019s species are in the genus\nAspergillus, so named because the slender stalks and poofy tips of its spore-\nproducing structures resemble an aspergillum, the holy water sprinkler used in\nsome Christian denominations. The genus has several high-profile members,\nincluding helpful industrial species that crank out useful chemicals such as\nmedicines or ferment foods, as A. oryzae does.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nLiving World\n\n### The science of sourdough: Free online event\n\nTechnology\n\n### Cochineal, a red dye from bugs, moves to the lab\n\nSociety\n\n### What did ancient people eat? Scientists find new clues in old pottery\n\nKnown as the koji mold, A. oryzae is a master digester. In the first stage of\nsoy sauce production, A. oryzae tackles the starter ingredients, typically\nsoybeans and wheat; in sake production, it goes to work on rice. The mold\u2019s\ndigestive enzymes \u2014 proteases and amylases \u2014 break down the proteins and\nstarches into simpler molecules that will be fermented by yeasts later on. The\nmold \u201csmells like this wonderful mix of mushroom and grapefruit, and a little\nbit sour as well,\u201d says microbiologist Benjamin Wolfe of Tufts University near\nBoston.\n\nOther Aspergillus species are menaces \u2014 among them, Aspergillus flavus, the\nMr. Hyde to A. oryzae\u2019s Dr. Jekyll. A. flavus makes potent poisons called\naflatoxins that, when ingested, are metabolized by the liver into compounds\nthat damage DNA and otherwise mess with cellular functioning. It infects a\nvariety of crops \u2014 corn, wheat, cassava, chili pepper, peanut, rice, sesame,\nsunflower seed and more. It can contaminate plants both before harvest and\nafter, when crops are stored or shipped. The toxins can even contaminate the\nmilk of animals that eat tainted feed. Despite various control measures,\nsporadic aflatoxin outbreaks poison and kill people and pets around the globe.\n\nScientists have long recognized that the hazardous A. flavus and the food\nfermenter A. oryzae are very close relatives \u2014 the two can appear identical in\ncolor and texture, or look very different from each other, making it tricky to\ntell them apart. Early investigations of their DNA reported remarkable\nsimilarity, and a 1998 study of a handful of genes from each fungus concluded\nthat A.oryzae evolved via domestication from A. flavus.\n\nBut A. oryzae doesn\u2019t make aflatoxin and has been safely used as a food\nfermenter for thousands of years. Now scientists have begun to pinpoint the\nspecific tweaks that that led to the major overhaul of the mold\u2019s metabolism.\n\nSoy sauce production involves two ferments; the koji mold is the workhorse of\nthe first one.\n\nCREDIT: BUSINESS INSIDER\n\n## A pivotal genetic deletion\n\nScientists had long been keen to establish genetic proof that A. oryzae\ncouldn\u2019t make aflatoxin, partly for reassurance that the mold is, and would\nremain, safe for fermenting food. Over the years, they have documented\nnumerous large- and small-scale destructive changes in the cluster of more\nthan two dozen genes that the fungus\u2019s ancestor employed to make the toxin.\n\nIn one recent study, for example, scientists compared the genome of A. oryzae\n14160, an industrial strain from China, with the genome of A. oryzae RIB40, a\nstrain that was sequenced in 2005. In a report published in Frontiers in\nMicrobiology in 2021, the team found that more than half of the aflatoxin gene\ncluster was deleted in strain 14160, while strain RIB40 has mutations in key\ngenes here and there.\n\nBut from strain to strain to strain, there\u2019s one deletion in the aflatoxin\ngene cluster that consistently appears, says Gibbons, who led the 2021\nanalysis with then-graduate student Katherine Chac\u00f3n-Vargas (the group has\nbeen analyzing hundreds of strains of the molds). This finding suggests that\nat some point, a strain of wild A. flavus mold acquired the deletion, which\nrendered it harmless. After that, other genetic changes \u2014 mutations,\ndeletions, other alterations \u2014 freely accumulated in the aflatoxin genes since\nthey were no longer being used.\n\nDomestication would have ensured that the harmless trait remained, says\nGibbons. That\u2019s because aflatoxin is a defensive compound the mold uses to\nkill other microbes. Since other microbes \u2014 specifically, yeasts \u2014 are part of\nthe fermentation process for making soy sauce or the rice wine sake, the only\nfermentations that would work would be those in which Aspergillus toxins\nweren\u2019t present to kill off the yeasts.\n\nAnd in the cushy domesticated environment, the toxins aren\u2019t important anyway.\n\u201cYou have this really stable food source all the time and there\u2019s no longer a\nreason to produce defense chemicals because there\u2019s enough food for\neverybody,\u201d Gibbons says.\n\nScientists think that the domestication of a microbe could go something like\nthis: It exists, along with other microbes, in the wild, where environmental\nfactors such as temperature and humidity vary (bottom left). Over time, it\nbecomes adapted to the stable, comfortable food environment (middle) and\neventually exists as a pure culture in a very controlled environment.\n\nThe loss of the ability to make aflatoxin probably paved the way for the\nfungus to ramp up its starch-digesting abilities, Gibbons adds. That\u2019s because\ndefense chemicals are expensive to make. \u201cIf they lose the ability to produce\nthose toxins, it actually saves them a lot of energy that they can put into\nprimary metabolism, like digesting starches and sugars and proteins,\u201d he says.\n\nResearch suggests that this dialed-up ability to digest starch evolved over\nand over again. Back in 1989, for example, long before genome sequences were\navailable for any Aspergillus species, several groups of scientists used\nmethods to show that A. oryzae had multiple copies of the gene coding for\nalpha-amylase, the starch-digesting enzyme; two strains of the fungus had two\ncopies while two other strains had three.\n\nResearchers have since looked more closely and at more strains and found all\nsorts of variations on this theme. Strain RIB40, for example, has alpha-\namylase genes on chromosomes 2, 3 and 5, while Gibbon\u2019s team recently reported\nthat the industrial strain from China, 14160, has two copies on chromosome 2\nand a third copy on chromosome 6.\n\nThese kinds of changes also probably happened many times in the wild, says\nGibbons, though before domestication, they weren\u2019t retained because they\nweren\u2019t of use. \u201cBut in the food environment, the more of these alpha-amylase\ngenes you have, the more of this enzyme you\u2019re producing,\u201d he says. We humans\nwould then have selected the starch-digesting powerhouse microbes in our\ndomestication for fermentations.\n\nThis illustration, from Koeki Kokusanko, an agricultural book of Japan\u2019s Edo\nera (1603-1867), shows the production of soy sauce.

When Wolfe\u2019s\ngroup at Tufts took a wild P. commune strain and another non-cheese\nPenicillium strain and serially grew them on cheese, after only eight\ngenerations \u2014 a period of a few weeks \u2014 the wild strains showed signs of\ndomestication. Reporting in the journal mBio in 2019, the team found that the\nmolds\u2019 ability to make pigment and toxins diminished. At the same time, they\nlost their musty odor, acquiring the buttery, cheesy aromas characteristic of\ntheir domesticated relatives.\n\nStay in the Know Sign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter today\n\n## The human factor in fermentation\n\nWhen contemplating the steps in the taming of A. oryzae, it\u2019s useful to\nremember that fermentation and human evolution have probably always been\nintertwined, says microbial geneticist Kevin Verstrepen of VIB and Leuven\nUniversity in Belgium.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s easy to imagine early hominids eating fruit that had been\nvisited by yeast and fermented into an alcoholic mash, and for humans to have\nrecognized the merits of such fruit, both for its mind-altering effects and\ndisinfectant qualities. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if those things were\ndiscovered quite quickly,\u201d says Verstrepen.\n\nIn the case of Aspergillus, spores are constantly drifting about \u2014 we inhale\nupwards of 200 per day, researchers estimate \u2014 and they will grow if they\nsettle in a warm, humid spot. A recent reconstruction of the Aspergillus\nfamily tree by evolutionary biologist Antonis Rokas of Vanderbilt University\nsuggests that A. flavus and some version of its domesticated counterpart, A.\noryzae, last shared an ancestor roughly 3.8 million years ago. A. oryzae is\nnaturally fond of rice, and versions of A. flavus that didn\u2019t make aflatoxin\nwere likely present on wild rice plants consumed by early humans.\n\nWith the advent of farming in the Neolithic some 12,000 or so years ago,\ndomestication became a full court press. As people settled in communities and\nbegan regularly planting crops and keeping animals, there would have been an\nexcess, perhaps for the first time, of grain or milk or meat. Fermentation\nprovided a way to keep food past harvest and prolong shelf life.\n\n\u201cOne of the best examples is raw milk \u2014 it goes bad in a day or so at room\ntemperature,\u201d says Gibbons. \u201cBut if you ferment it into a hard cheese, you can\ntravel around with it in your pocket at room temperature for a month.\u201d\n\nAn early example of people intentionally fermenting foods \u2014 very likely using\nAspergillus \u2014 comes from the Neolithic village Jiahu in Henan province in\nChina, a site with artifacts suggesting domesticated rice and early musical\ninstruments. In 2004, a team reported that pottery shards from the site\ncontained residues of a fermented drink of rice, honey and fruit \u2014 basically,\na rice wine or \u201cproto-sake,\u201d says Gibbons. Scientists have since investigated\nresidues in vessels from two other early Neolithic sites in China and found\ntraces of fungi, including some that are startlingly like our hero, the koji\nmold.\n\nAnalyses of residue on pottery shards from the neolithic site of Guantaoyuan\nin China revealed bits of microbial structures (top two rows, GTY ancient\nfungi). These ancient microbes have a striking resemblance to the fungi\nAspergillus oryzae (third row), Rhizopus (fourth row) and yeasts (bottom row),\nwhich are used to make various fermented foods and drinks.\n\nCREDIT: L. LIU ET AL / PNAS 2019\n\nInitially, people probably relied on spontaneous colonization by A. oryzae and\nother microbes but at some point, \u201cback-slopping\u201d developed, wherein a portion\nof a previous ferment is used to start a new one, like a sourdough starter is\nused for bread. This intentional fermentation with A. oryzae appears to have\nbeen happening as early as 2,300 years ago: The mold gets a mention in the\nancient Chinese text Zhouli (Rites of the Zhou dynasty) that dates to 300 BCE.\nSome time later, people began breeding A. oryzae on steamed rice; its spores\nwere then separated from the grain with a silk sieve and dried for use as\nneeded.\n\nVerstrepen is fond of telling his students that beer yeasts, living year-round\nin their vats where they are warm and well-fed, are like dogs, while wine\nyeasts, which are harnessed during the harvest but may intermingle with wild\nspecies in the intervening months, are like cats.\n\nToday, says Rokas, A. oryzae is like a dog. There are numerous bred strains\nthat people can order depending on their specific fermenting needs. But for a\nlong time, there would have been unfettered variety floating around \u2014 lots of\nA. oryzae/A.flavus strains with defunct toxin genes and differing abilities to\ndigest starch, and a matter of fortune which ended up in your soy sauce or\nsake brew. The mold of the ancients, Rokas says, \u201cmust have been more\ncatlike.\u201d\n\n10.1146/knowable-050124-1\n\nRachel Ehrenberg is an editor at Knowable Magazine.\n\nRepublish This Article\n\n  * Food & Environment\n  * Living World\n  * Society\n  * Technology\n\nStay in the Know Sign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter today\n\nShare this article\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Pocket\n  * Reddit\n  * Flipboard\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * Republish\n\n## Support Knowable Magazine\n\nHelp us make scientific knowledge accessible to all\n\nDonate\n\nTAKE A DEEPER DIVE | Explore Related Scholarly Articles\n\nANNUAL REVIEW OF MICROBIOLOGY\n\n### Microbiome Assembly in Fermented Foods\n\nAdvances in genomic techniques have allowed researchers to begin cataloging\nthe microbial communities of fermented foods.
