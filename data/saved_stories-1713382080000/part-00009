OpenMPTCProuter\n\nOpenMPTCProuter use MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) to really aggregate multiple\nInternet connections and OpenWrt.\n\nA simple diagram to describe how OpenMPTCProuter is working.\n\n#### Aggregation\n\nBonding connections to really aggregate bandwidth from up to 8 internet\nconnections with different characteristics (Fiber, ADSL, VDSL, 4G, 5G,...)\nProvide hybrid Internet with any FAI\n\n#### Failover\n\nAlways up with connection and server failover\n\n#### Security\n\nAll data between the router and the server part are encrypted by default and\ncan be obfuscated\n\nShare on
