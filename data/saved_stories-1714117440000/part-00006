It\nrequires TikTok's parent company ByteDance to sell the app to non-Chinese\nowners or face a blanket ban in the US. The decision now faces a complicated\nand uphill legal battle.\n\nMany devoted fans of the social media platform in the US \u2013 more than 150\nmillion users \u2013 may see their favourite leisure activity disappear. Yet some\nof the people who stand to feel most impacted are the creators and small\nbusinesses on TikTok that make money through the platform, whether on the side\nor full-time.\n\nAccording to March 2024 data from TikTok, more than seven million small US\nbusinesses use TikTok, and the company reported it drove $15bn (\u00a312.04bn) in\nrevenue for these enterprises in 2023.\n\nThe platform is also a major global economic force: in January, TikTok\nreported small- and medium-sized enterprises on the platform contributed\n\u20ac4.8bn ($5.14bn; \u00a34.12bn) to the GDP of Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands\nand Belgium in 2023 alone.\n\nNow, facing a TikTok ban, American entrepreneurs are worried about their\nrevenue streams. So too are global businesses that rely on US audiences to buy\ntheir products and engage with their content. There may be alternatives, but\nfinding a suitable substitute could be an uphill battle.\n\n## Growing audiences, finding consumers\n\nShira, 27, who has more than 500,000 followers on the platform at\n@shirashiraonthewall, is a full-time content creator. She launched her account\non TikTok in 2021 after she moved to the US from Australia. Initially, she\nshared reaction videos to other people's content as well as her experiences\nliving in the US. Within nine months, her following had ballooned.\n\nTo generate income, Shira relies on partnerships on TikTok. While she also has\naccounts on Snapchat and YouTube, she says TikTok has consistently brought in\nthe most money. She's put in a lot of work, she tells the BBC. \"I have spent\nmany years growing and developing a really dedicated audience. Doing many live\nstreams, posting and editing for years. It's been a difficult journey to make\nany money from it, so I'm really grateful I took the leap and got lucky.\"\n\nShira describes the ban as \"devastating\". Beyond her own business, she says\nshe's also concerned about potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs that will\nbe lost \u2013 in March, TikTok reported the app provides at least 224,000 jobs in\nthe US. \"I'm not sure what all these people are going to do if the ban goes\nthrough,\" says Shira. \"There is no unemployment for creators or fallbacks.\"\n\nCourtesy of Shira\n\nFull-time content creator Shira describes the potenital TikTok ban as\n\"devastating\" (Credit: Courtesy of Shira)\n\nIleana Justine, 30, a creator with a following of nearly 200,000 on TikTok at\n@ileanajustine, expresses similar concerns. Her account took off in 2021 after\nshe began posting about the fact that she and her groom were requiring guests\nto wear masks at their upcoming wedding to help limit the spread of Covid-19.\nShe was soon launched into the realm occupied by \"controversial\" content\ncreators, and since then she's \"primarily focused on the intersection of\nlifestyle and political content\", discussing topics such as paid family leave,\nabortion and gun control.\n\nUnlike Shira, Ileana isn't a full-time content creator, but her work on the\nplatform still takes time. Beyond her own economics, she's also concerned for\npeople whose income is entirely based on TikTok success. \"The platform allows\nfor amplification of their products and stores, which can completely transform\ntheir businesses \u2013 I have lots of friends who have been able to turn their\nbusinesses from side hustles into full-time jobs because of TikTok.\"\n\n## Finding an alternative\n\nThe ban may not spell doom for businesses \u2013 but experts say it will force them\nto adapt, much of which will be figuring out how to shift their operations to\nother online platforms.\n\n\"We're living in a digital economy ... and we're basically relying on\ntechnology for all kinds of communication and information,\" says Mohammad\nRahman, a professor of management at the Purdue University Daniels School of\nBusiness, US. The idea of going back to how business was done before social\nmedia likely won't work, primarily because \"consumers [around the world] have\nchanged in terms of how we collect information, how we decide on what to buy\".\n\nIf TikTok is banned in the US, there are existing alternatives such as Meta,\nand experts predict others could pop up in the future. There's also time for\nbusinesses to figure out their next moves; ByteDance will have at least 270\ndays to sell TikTok from the point of President Biden's approval, a period\nthat may extend further due to by court battles between the ByteDance and the\nUS government.\n\nStephanie Kelly Photography\n\nIleana Justine worries about both part-time and full-time creators if TikTok\nis banned (Credit: Stephanie Kelly Photography)\n\nYet which platform they might migrate to in the wake of a ban is anyone's\nguess, says Kristen Schiele, an associate professor of clinical marketing at\nthe University of Southern California's Marshall Business School, especially\nsince many are laser focused on reaching Gen Z, who drive a large portion of\nspending on TikTok. \"It's hard to reach them on any other platform,\" she says.\n\n## A global ripple effect\n\nAmerican TikTok users don't just power domestic businesess \u2013 they have a\nglobal impact. Entrepreneurs in other countries stand to potentially lose the\nUS audiences they depend on for views that ultimately convert to sales, too.\nSome have already expressed concerns, including within the UK and Canada. In\nMarch, a TikTok Canada spokesperson told the Global News via email that\n\"banning TikTok in the US would be devastating to Canadian TikTok creators and\nsmall businesses, many of whom rely on being able to reach Americans as a\nlarge part of their audience\".\n\nAdditionally, says Schiele, \"There's a lot of cosmetic brands and skin care\nbrands coming from Korea, especially, and China. That's a big thing [on\nTikTok] right now ... those different beauty regimens and the great skin care\nproducts that they have.\"\n\nThey, too, will have to figure out a pivot to continue to reach US customers\nwithout TikTok. And it may be more difficult for international brands to do\nso. Schiele is optimistic many can, but worries that the blow to up-and-coming\ncompanies and international brands could be too much for some, especially\nsmaller enterprises.\n\nCourtesy of Dappz Sports\n\nMatt McGuckin built his business on TikTok, and fears losing both income and\nthe community he's bred (Credit: Courtesy of Dappz Sports)\n\n## More than revenue\n\nMatt McGuckin is widely known as Dappz Sports on TikTok and started his sports\ntrading card company out of his bedroom in 2019. The 35-year-old steadily\nbuilt his online presence in the following years, but when Covid-19 shut down\nmost of the world \u2013 including sports \u2013 thousands of people began flocking\n@dappzsports to talk about trading cards.\n\nMore like this:\n\n  * How TikTok creators can make you spend\n  * The NPC TikTok trend helping creators earn\n  * Should you trust advice from a 'finfluencer'?\n\nThe account now has one million followers, thanks in part to two teens who\ninsisted McGuckin \u2013 who had been fighting with other creators for eyeballs on\nInstagram \u2013 build out his TikTok following. McGuckin began live streaming on\nthe platform each night. After one evening in which he sold $70,000 (\u00a356,195)\nin cards while streaming alongside his sister in his bedroom, he realised he\nwas onto something big.\n\nHe's concerned about the revenue hit Dappz Sports will take if a TikTok ban\ngoes into effect, but he adds the platform is about much more than his\npersonal income. As Dappz Sports expanded, McGuckin was able to create 90 jobs\nfor people working in Los Angeles, including to actors and writers who were\nout of work throughout the Sag-Aftra and WGA strikes in 2023.\n\nHe's also created a virtual gathering space for a cross-generational audience\nacross dozens of countries, many of whom have visited Dappz Sports on TikTok\nfor years. \"We have people who join our stream and they don't spend any\nmoney,\" he explains. \"They just come in every night and we're talking about\nsports and we're talking about our favourite games or we're talking about our\nfavourite moments.\"\n\nHe will entertain alternative platforms, especially if they're necessary for\nthe business to survive. Yet, says McGuckin, \"this is where we put our most\nenergy into and where we built our community, and it would just be a shame [to\nlose it] even if we succeed on other platforms\".\n\n\\--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a\nhandpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to\nyour inbox twice a week.\n\nInternational business\n\nNews Features\n\nSocial media\n\nSmall Business\n\nRelated\n\n## Mining giant BHP proposes buyout of Anglo American\n\n14 hrs ago\n\nAustralia\n\n## How fraudsters are getting fake articles onto Facebook\n\n1 day ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## US watchdog sues to block $8.5bn handbag takeover\n\n3 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\nMore\n\n7 hrs ago\n\n## Life after TikTok: Why ban would be buzz kill for viral beekeeper\n\nA new law provides a pathway to ban the popular app in the US.
