Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard's podcast and\nreporting on the dark underbelly of the internet.\n\nSee More \u2192\n\ne-HallPass, a digital system that students have to use to request to leave\ntheir classroom and which takes note of how long they\u2019ve been away, including\nto visit the bathroom, has spread into at least a thousand schools around the\nUnited States.\n\nThe system has some resemblance to the sort of worker monitoring carried out\nby Amazon, which tracks how long its staff go to the toilet for, and is used\nto penalize workers for \u201ctime off task.\u201d It also highlights how automated\ntools have led to increased surveillance of students in schools, and employees\nin places of work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis product is just the latest in a growing number of student surveillance\ntools\u2014designed to allow school administrators to monitor and control student\nbehavior at scale, on and off campus,\u201d Doug Levin, co-founder and national\ndirector for the K12 Security Information eXchange, a non-profit focused on\ncybersecurity for schools, told Motherboard. \u201cWhile the problems they purport\nto solve are real, they also introduce other risks to students\u2014including the\nrisks of spurious accusations and targeted harassment by school officials and\nlaw enforcement.\n\n> Do you know anything else about e-HallPass? We'd love to hear from you.\n> Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on\n> Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, or email\n> joseph.cox@vice.com.\n\nLevin further noted that the increased scrutiny offered by surveillance tools\n\u201chas been shown to be disproportionately targeted against minorities, recent\nimmigrants, LGBTQ kids,\u201d and other marginalized groups.\n\nOn Monday, a since deleted tweet went viral in which someone claimed that\ntheir school was preparing to introduce e-HallPass, and described it as \u201cthe\nprogram where we track how long, at what time, and how often each child goes\nto the restroom and store that information on third party servers run by a\nprivate for-profit company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMotherboard then identified multiple schools across the U.S. that appear to\nuse the technology by searching the web for instruction manuals,\nannouncements, and similar documents from schools that mentioned the\ntechnology. Those results included K-12 schools such as Franklin Regional\nMiddle School, Fargo Public Schools, River City High School, Loyalsock\nTownship School District, and Cabarrus County Schools. Also schools\nMotherboard found that appear to use e-HallPass include Mehlville High School,\nEagle County School District, Hopatcong Borough Schools, and Pope Francis\nPreparatory School. These schools are spread across the country, with some in\nCalifornia, New York, Virginia, and North Carolina.\n\nSign up for Motherboard\u2019s daily newsletter for a regular dose of our original\nreporting, plus behind-the-scenes content about our biggest stories.\n\nEduspire, the company that makes e-HallPass, told trade publication EdSurge in\nMarch that 1,000 schools use the system. Brian Tvenstrup, president of\nEduspire, told the outlet that the company\u2019s biggest obstacle to selling the\nproduct \u201cis when a school isn\u2019t culturally ready to make these kinds of\nchanges yet.\u201d\n\nThe system itself works as a piece of software installed on a computer or\nmobile device. Students request a pass through the software and the teacher\nthen approves it. The tool promises \u201chall omniscience\u201d with the ability to\n\u201calways know who has a pass and who doesn\u2019t (without asking the student!),\u201d\naccording to the product\u2019s website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmins can then access data collected through the software, and view a live\ndashboard showing details on all passes. e-HallPass can also stop meet-ups of\ncertain students and limit the amount of passes going to certain locations,\nthe website adds, explicitly mentioning \u201cvandalism and TikTok challenges.\u201d\nMany of the schools Motherboard identified appear to use e-HallPass\nspecifically on Chromebooks, according to student user guides and similar\ndocuments hosted on the schools\u2019 websites, though it also advertises that it\ncan be used to track students on their personal cell phones.\n\nEdSurge reported that some people had taken to Change.org with a petition to\nremove the \u201ccreepy\u201d system from a specific school. Motherboard found over a\ndozen similar petitions online, including one regarding Independence High\nSchool signed nearly 700 times which appears to have been written by a group\nof students.\n\n\u201cWe are expected to be young adults and by this E-HP system taking place this\nyear we have a great amount of freedom and independence being taken away,\u201d the\npetition reads. \u201cMany students that attend Indy have come together and decided\nto petition against this new system that has been created. We, as the students\nfeel as if we\u2019re being watched and monitored at all times throughout our\nschool day, which is extremely uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nEduspire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cEvery dollar spent on these solutions is a dollar less that can be spent on\nhiring school counselors and teachers,\u201d said Levin \u201cUltimately, the choice\nschools are facing is about the type of community they are seeking to foster:\none focused on defending and punishing vs. one focused on supporting and\nuplifting. By its very nature, increased digital student surveillance leads to\nthe former.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cThe real issue/risks here, I think, are not so much broad\ncybersecurity risk but are ethical: about the type of environment schools are\ncreating and whether it is humane and just.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to our cybersecurity podcast, CYBER.
