There was even an editorial cartoon debating if the EuroVision song\ncontest should go ahead some things never change, it seems.\n\nThe Guardian Front Page April 1, 1977Details of front-page articles from the\nday\n\nInside, the newspaper elaborated on topics of international and local interest\nand most readers would not have noticed anything unusual about a special\ntravel feature starting on page 17 of the paper.\n\nThe seven-page like any travel feature that newspapers were printing at the\ntime. It featured a map of the islands, pictures of palm trees, an image of\nthe leader, and a short \u201cGuide to the Republic\u201d which gave many facts and\nfigures about the island nation.\n\nThe first of a seven-page feature on San Serriffe\n\n> \u201cBut not all was as it seemed. The feature was an elaborate April Fool\u2019s Day\n> joke. The islands of San Serriffe did not exist and everything was\n> completely fabricated.\u201d\n\nThe San Serriffe travel feature on pages 18\u201323Details of the Travel Feature on\nSan Serriffe\n\n## Fast Facts About San Serriffe\n\n  * Location: Halfway between Africa and India in the Indian Ocean\n  * Population: 1,782,724\n  * Capital: Bodoni\n  * President: M.

PicaThree point\nkey to prosperity and Landmarks in History\n\n## Printer\u2019s Puns and Jokes\n\nMany of the articles and advertisements were based upon \u201cinside jokes\u201d that\nonly printers and aficionados of typography would have understood. From the\nshape of the islands to the names of cities, typographical terms and typeface\nnames were used liberally to give names to geographical places and demographic\nfacts.\n\nThe layout of the islands mimics the shape of a semicolon\u2014one of the many\ntypographic jokes found in the map\n\n  * Island Name: San Serif typeface (without serifs)\n  * Island Shape: Semi-colon, Upper Caisse & Lower Caisse\n  * Pie Island: When you drop letterpress type on the ground\n  * Port Elrod: A hot-metal strip-casting machine\n  * Typefaces: Port Clarendon, Bodoni, Erbar, Perpetua, Umbra, Garamondo, Gill Sands, Gill Cameo, Monte Tempo, Montallegro\n  * Ova Mata: Type that does not fit in a column (also called \u201cover set\u201d)\n  * Woj of Tipe: \u201cWodge of Type\u201d A bulk quantity of type\n  * Printing Terms: Villa Pica, Pearl Island, Cap Em, Thirty Point\n  * Flong: A curved papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 matrix which helped create stereotype plates for rotary press printing\n\n## A Strange Land Indeed\n\nOn the surface, many of the articles appeared normal if you quickly flipped\nthrough the newspaper. There were articles about the political history of San\nSerriffe, the influx of tourism to the small islands, and potential economic\nopportunities for businesses looking for new territories.\n\nThis scientific article about how the ocean tides effect the islands seems\ncompletely plausible \u2014 until you read the details and see the scientific\ndiagram which supposedly explains how the islands will eventually collide with\nSri Lanka in 2011.\n\nAn article about how the islands are being moved by extreme tides and will\ncollide with Sri Lanka in 2011\n\n> \u201c... the islands will accelerate at first gently and then more rapidly as\n> they approach Sri Lanka. Simple calculations suggest that the island group\n> will hit the coast of Sri Lanka at a velocity of 940 km an hour on January\n> 3, 2011.\u201d\n\nIllustration of the fictitious tides\n\n## The Advertisements\n\nWhat made the islands of San Serriffe seem most plausible were the\nadvertisements placed throughout the feature from large brands such as Kodak,\nTexaco, Costain, and Guinness. These ads, with complete approval from the\ncompanies, became critical in making it more believable \u2014 until you read the\nfine print.\n\nAll of the advertisements for the San Serriffe feature included fake ads paid\nfor by real companies. This Kodak ad asks for readers to submit an elusive\nphotograph of the islands.Guinness advertisement for their \u201cupside down\u201d beer\n\n> \u201cIt was after the freak barley crop of \u201956 that the local inhabitants of San\n> Serriffe first began to notice a change in their beer. The taste was the\n> same ... but the white head turned out black, and the strong body was white.\n\n> Experts put it down to the novice farm helpers who spent their holiday in\n> San Serriffe that year. Knowing little about crops, they sowed the barley\n> seeds upside down.\u201d\n\nTexaco advertisement for a fake trivia competition for Grand Prix fans\n\n> \u201cYou and your guest will be flown first-class to San Serriffe by chartered\n> aircraft, and driven to your hotel overlooking the famous Cocobanana Beach\n> ...\u201d\n\n> \u201cCompetition closes on March 31, 1977 and all entries postmarked after that\n> date will be ineligible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement full of typographic jokes for the multi-national construction\ncompany CostainAd for the French lighter company, Cricket: Roughly translated\nit says, \u201cSan Serriffe is the perfect country, with a strong economy and\nequitable policies. That\u2019s because all the workers buy Le Cricket lighters\ninstead of silly old matches. So there are never any strikes! Isn\u2019t it so?\u201d\n\n## How did one of Britain\u2019s Largest Papers Get Away with Such an Elaborate\nPrank?\n\nAccording to The Guardian Book of April Fool\u2019s Day published in 2007, the idea\nfor San Serriffe come about as a joke in itself:\n\n> \u201cThe Financial Times was always doing special reports on little countries\n> I\u2019d never heard of ... I was thinking about April Fool\u2019s Day 1977 and I\n> thought, why don\u2019t we just make a country up?\u201d\n\n> Special reports editor Stuart St. Clair Legge suggested the title that was\n> to become a legend: San Serriffe, part typographic pun, part credible name\n> for a tropical isle.\n\nThe feature was originally envisioned as an one-page story but the editors\nkept coming up with ideas and expanded it into the largest travel supplement\nin Guardian history. At this point, the newspaper was still printed using hot-\nmetal typesetting and the production of a single page required an enormous\namount of time and resources \u2014 let alone setting seven full pages just for a\njoke.\n\n## The People Behind the Joke\n\nThe people behind the story were all regular employees or contributors to The\nGuardian.\n\n  * Philip Davies was an advertising representative who came up with the idea for a fake island.\n  * Geoffrey Taylor was the foreign editor who created editorial content and designed the fake islands.\n  * Stuart St. Clair Legge, a special reports editor, suggested the name San Serriffe.\n  * Mark Arnold-Forster & Tim Radford wrote various articles\n  * J Walter Thompson Ad Agency sold advertising space for the supplement (which is likely the only way the feature was approved).\n\n## Public Reaction\n\nAccording to an article written by David McKie in 2006, the public reaction to\nthe San Serriffe feature was dramatic and almost instantaneous.\n\n> \u201cThe office all day was bedlam as people pestered the switchboard with\n> requests for more information. Veterans of that time say there\u2019s never been\n> a day like it in terms of reader response.\u201d\n\n> Both travel agencies and airlines made official complaints to the editor,\n> Peter Preston, about the disruption as customers simply refused to believe\n> that the islands did not exist.\n\nThe Guardian sold \u201cI\u2019ve Been to San Serriffe\u201d bumper stickers as well as a\nreported 12,000 t-shirts (although I can\u2019t find an image to confirm this).\nThere was also a letter to the editor written by the fictitious \u201cSan Serriffe\nLiberation Front\u201d stating how furious they were with the pro-government slant\nof the Guardian piece.\n\n## The Legacy of San Serriffe\n\nThe Guardian printed follow-up articles about San Serriffe on April Fool\u2019s Day\nin 1978 and 1999, but neither of these articles had the impact or originality\nof the 1977 feature. In the years since, many people have co-opted San\nSerriffe for their own jokes.\n\nThe \u201cofficial\u201d flag of San Serriffe\n\nIn 2006, WikiTravel published a joke article with additional information about\nSan Serriffe including travel tips, cultural history, and economic forecasts.\nThey even created a ficticious national flag featuring an asterisk.\n\nHenry Morris of The Bird & Bull Press in Pennsylvania printed several\nfictional fine-press books about the islands of San Serriffe and also printed\nofficial paper and coin currency in 1988. The 500 limited-edition coins were\nmade with 1 troy ounce of (real) .999 silver and today are quite collectible.\n\nSan Serriffe Corona banknotes and silver coins created by The Bird & Bull\nPress\n\nIn April 2018, type designer Toshi Omagari created a custom \u201cI have been to\nSan Serriffe\u201d sticker that he pasted on his laptop.\n\nSan Serriffe Sticker by Toshi Omagari\n\n## Further Reading & Watching\n\nThere are many more articles and surprising details in the seven-page feature\nthat could not fit into this post.
