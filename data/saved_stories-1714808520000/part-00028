After\nmonths of ambiguity, Microsoft disclosed that a series of security failures\ngave Storm-0558 access to an engineer's account, which allowed Storm-0558 to\ncollect data from 25 of Microsoft's Azure customers, including US federal\nagencies.\n\nIn January, Microsoft disclosed that it had been breached again, this time by\nRussian state-sponsored hacking group Midnight Blizzard. The group was able\n\"to compromise a legacy non-production test tenant account\" to gain access to\nMicrosoft's systems for \"as long as two months.\"\n\nAll of this culminated in a report (PDF) from the US Cyber Safety Review\nBoard, which castigated Microsoft for its \"inadequate\" security culture, its\n\"inaccurate public statements,\" and its response to \"preventable\" security\nbreaches.\n\nTo attempt to turn things around, Microsoft announced something it called the\n\"Secure Future Initiative\" in November 2023. As part of that initiative,\nMicrosoft today announced a series of plans and changes to its security\npractices, including a few changes that have already been made.\n\n\"We are making security our top priority at Microsoft, above all else\u2014over all\nother features,\" wrote Microsoft Security Executive Vice President Charlie\nBell. \"We\u2019re expanding the scope of SFI, integrating the recent\nrecommendations from the CSRB as well as our learnings from Midnight Blizzard\nto ensure that our cybersecurity approach remains robust and adaptive to the\nevolving threat landscape.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of these changes, Microsoft will also make its Senior Leadership\nTeam's pay partially dependent on whether the company is \"meeting our security\nplans and milestones,\" though Bell didn't specify how much executive pay would\nbe dependent on meeting those security goals.\n\nMicrosoft's post describes three security principles (\"secure by design,\"\n\"secure by default,\" and \"secure operations\") and six \"security pillars\" meant\nto address different weaknesses in Microsoft's systems and development\npractices. The company says it plans to secure 100 percent of all its user\naccounts with \"securely managed, phishing-resistant multifactor\nauthentication,\" enforce least-privilege access across all applications and\nuser accounts, improve network monitoring and isolation, and retain all system\nsecurity logs for at least two years, among other promises. Microsoft is also\nplanning to put new deputy Chief Information Security Officers on different\nengineering teams to track their progress and report back to the executive\nteam and board of directors.\n\nAs for concrete fixes that Microsoft has already implemented, Bell writes that\nMicrosoft has \"implemented automatic enforcement of multifactor authentication\nby default across more than 1 million Microsoft Entra ID tenants within\nMicrosoft,\" removed 730,000 old and/or insecure apps \"to date across\nproduction and corporate tenants,\" expanded its security logging, and adopted\nthe Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standard for its security disclosures.\n\nIn addition to Bell's public security promises, The Verge has obtained and\npublished an internal memo from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella that re-emphasizes\nthe company's publicly stated commitment to security. Nadella also says that\nimproving security should be prioritized over adding new features, something\nthat may affect the constant stream of tweaks and changes that Microsoft\nreleases for Windows 11 and other software.\n\n\"The recent findings by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cyber Safety\nReview Board (CSRB) regarding the Storm-0558 cyberattack, from summer 2023,\nunderscore the severity of the threats facing our company and our customers,\nas well as our responsibility to defend against these increasingly\nsophisticated threat actors,\" writes Nadella. \"If you\u2019re faced with the\ntradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do\nsecurity. In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other\nthings we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for\nlegacy systems.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n33\n\nAndrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with\na focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of\noperating systems like Windows and macOS.
