At the time, we made the decision to\nseparate Single Sign-On (SSO) identity providers into two categories: standard\nidentity providers (free-to-use identity services) that could be used on all\nTailscale pricing plans, and advanced identity providers (paid-for identity\nservices) which could only be used with our Personal, Premium, and Enterprise\npricing tiers.\n\nA few weeks ago, we quietly removed this language from our website, making\nTailscale usable with any OIDC-compliant SSO identity provider on any plan.\n\nAlmost a year to the date after we made the initial decision, SSO is once\nagain available for free for everyone. The number of users affected by this\nchange is relatively small; most people on our paid tiers use premium features\nother than advanced identity providers, and most Starter users were\ncomfortably using standard identity providers. But we made the move for\nreasons that were important to us, and understanding those reasons requires a\nlittle background in identity.\n\n## SSO and identity\n\nFirst, some context. Single Sign-On, known as SSO, centralizes user access\nmanagement. It reduces the number of login credentials users have to maintain,\nwhich in turn reduces the number of credentials vulnerable to compromise. In\naddition, it allows organizations to enforce uniform security policies, such\nas mandating the use of 2-factor authentication and password strength. SSO\nmakes it easier to grant and revoke access to applications quickly during\nonboarding, offboarding, and security incidents, and provides audit logs for\nusers' access and use of applications.\n\nThese features have made SSO a fundamental tool for any modern company that\ntakes security seriously. Internally, Tailscale employees are required to use\nSSO when available as a part of our security policy. Moreover, Tailscale's\nproduct doesn't support plain username+password authentication at all. Users\nof Tailscale have only ever been able to authenticate using SSO.\n\nWhy do we require SSO? Our mission at Tailscale is to build the new internet,\nand we take a strong stance that the next internet has to be secure by\ndefault. We also want to focus on what we do really well (networking), and\nrely on identity experts to do the identity parts well. That\u2019s not trivial!\nIdentity and authentication are core security concerns, and the experts in\nthose fields have done a lot of hard implementation work. For our users\u2019\nauthentication requirements, delegating their Tailscale identity to an\nexisting SSO is a clear winner.\n\n## The SSO tax\n\nMany service providers do not yet share our philosophy that SSO has become a\nbasic security requirement, and they tend to charge more (and sometimes\nsignificantly more) for the \"luxury\" to log in via an SSO identity provider.\nThis practice is now infamously called the \"SSO tax\" in security circles.\nThere is even an SSO Tax wall of shame in its honor \u2014 a publicly maintained\nlist of companies who do it.\n\nThe core issue with this tax is that it turns basic security into a budgetary\nquestion, forcing users to choose between good security posture and their\nwallets. And the smaller the company, the more painful the tradeoff. As a\nsecurity-first company, we don\u2019t think this is the right tradeoff for the good\nof the Internet overall \u2014 so it is not a trend we want to endorse.\n\n## How we (partially) fell into the trap\n\nBut even with those principles in mind, we found ourselves in a position of\nlevying a (partial) SSO tax. Tailscale evolves on a daily basis, along with\nour user base and their needs. Designing a pricing policy for ever-changing\nrequirements was, and continues to be, a complex challenge.\n\nAdding to the complexity: some identity-related features really can be premium\noptions without creating major security problems. A classic example is user\nand group provisioning (e.g. SCIM). It\u2019s built on top of SSO, and it makes\nsome kinds of user management a lot easier, but it doesn\u2019t have the same\nsecurity implications as SSO generally. It\u2019s genuinely an advanced security\noption, not a basic one.\n\nWhen we designed our pricing v3, the idea was that Starter would serve small\nteams (with a high degree of internal trust) that may not need advanced\nsecurity features, and the Premium and Enterprise plans are for larger teams\nthat do require more assurance. We assumed that users who use more feature-\nrich identity providers they were already willing to pay for would also\nbenefit from more enterprise Tailscale features such as network flow logging,\nuser and group provisioning or advanced user roles. We bundled these features\nalong with \u201cadvanced\u201d (i.e. paid) identity providers together in our pricing\nplans.\n\nWe\u2019d aimed to thread the needle by separating out the two kinds of identity\nproviders and taking comfort in the fact that SSO, in general, remained free.\nWhich was true! But also, as we continued to examine it, this pricing felt\nmore and more like a partial SSO tax (for certain identity providers). And\nthat felt like a mistake.\n\nIn fact, from customer feedback and use cases, we learned that a user's choice\nof identity provider has little correlation to their usage and requirements\nfor other features of Tailscale (except the aforementioned user and group\nprovisioning). The distinction between standard and advanced identity\nproviders did not wind up providing our users any value, nor did it align with\nour ethos that security isn\u2019t a luxury.\n\nSince the beginning, the goal of our pricing policy has been to provide the\nbest experience and value for our users. When we identify issues that impact\nour users, we aim to improve or resolve them as quickly as possible. Between\nthe time we noticed we'd fallen into the SSO tax trap, to approving its\nremoval and updating the public policy, only a couple of weeks had elapsed.\n\nCutting the SSO tax is an important security win here, and we'd like to see\nmore companies follow suit. Just as important, though, is the willingness to\nlook at what's working \u2014 and what's not \u2014 and listen to users about what\npolicies might be a mistake. Thanks to those users and to my Tailscale\ncolleagues for acting quickly, now our SSO tax is gone. Good riddance.\n\n## Subscribe to Tailscale\u2019s blog\n\nWe have a deep commitment to keeping your data safe.\n\nToo much email?RSSX\n\n## More articles\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#### Taking Tailscale to the cloud with AWS\n\nRachele Gyorffy & Mike Gemmati\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\n#### Remotely access Home Assistant via Tailscale for free\n\nAlex Kretzschmar\n\nMar 29, 2024\n\n#### About the Tailscale.com outage on March 7, 2024\n\nParker Higgins\n\n## Try Tailscale for free\n\nGet started\n\nSchedule a demo\n\nContact sales\n\nProduct\n\nHow it worksPricingIntegrationsFeaturesCompare Tailscale\n\nUse Cases\n\nBusiness VPNRemote AccessSite-to-Site NetworkingHomelabEnterprise\n\nResources\n\nBlogEvents & Webinars\n\nCompany\n\nCompanyCareersPress\n\nHelp & Support\n\nSupportSalesSecurityLegalOpen SourceChangelog\n\nLearn\n\nSSH keysDocker SSHDevSecOpsMulticloudNAT TraversalMagicDNSPAMPoLPAll articles\n\nTerms of ServicePrivacy Policy\n\nWireGuard is a registered trademark of Jason A.
