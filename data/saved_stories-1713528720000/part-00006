Sony's\nflagship DVD player at the time, the DVD-s7000, cost $1,000; entry-level\nmodels reached the marketplace several months later with price-tags around\nhalf that, which still wasn't cheap. The nascent format faced several\nchallenges \u2014 not all Hollywood studios were on board with the new digital\nmedia, while video-rental chains would not clear out a portion of their VHS\nshelf-space for the shiny new discs. However, thanks to a passionate group of\nearly adopters, home-video divisions at Warner and Sony, the release of movies\non DVD without the traditional \"rental window\" applied to VHS, and retailers\nstocking discs at affordable prices, consumers began crossing the digital\ndivide. Since then, DVD has changed not just the way we watch movies, but how\nwe think about them.It's hard to understate the impact that DVD has had on our\nmovie-consuming culture. Just as a lot of us will someday (even today) explain\nto young people what the world was like before personal computers or the\nInternet, we have to make an effort to scan back to the mid-1990s, when the\nidea of feature-length movies on CD-sized discs was a holy grail of film\ncollectors. Prior to 1997, the condition of feature films on home video was\nsorry indeed. VHS tapes offered poor transfers compared to today's viewing\nstandards, while film collectors hoarded hard-to-find movies captured from\nrare, late-night TV screenings. At the time, Laserdisc was the cineaste's\nchoice, although the format was expensive, unwieldy, and sometimes subject to\ndegradation thanks to the infamous \"laser rot\" that plagued more than a few\ncollections. Folks who didn't have Laserdisc players and deep pockets could\npurchase some movies on VHS with widescreen transfers, but they came at a\npremium price. And then there was videotape itself \u2014 bulky, non-indexed, and\nliable to warp, break, and degrade, it simply was not durable enough to\nsatisfy film collectors.Looking back, we see there simply is no comparison\nbetween 1997 and 2007. Today, it's not only possible, but affordable for the\naverage consumer to own an excellent personal film collection and home-theater\nequipment. It can even be done \"on a budget,\" as it were. Compared to the pre-\nhome-video era (basically, at any time before mass-market VCRs), the\ntransformation is nothing less than astonishing, and it's worth thinking\nabout. It was not that long ago that only the very wealthy could afford home\ntheaters and actual prints of films for private screenings. It would require\nnot only a large room, but a separate, muffled projection room as well, and\nsomebody to run the projector (recall that famous scene in Sunset Boulevard,\nfor example). You couldn't have a setup like that and, say, live in an\napartment. DVD has made movies accessible to everyone, not just reclusive\nmovie stars. This is one time when the movies may have gotten smaller, but\nthey also got better.* * *The arrival of DVD was bolstered by the near-\nsimultaneous arrival of the World Wide Web. Indeed, for a lot of folks, DVD\nand the Internet have been inseparable elements of a single success story. The\npartial democratization of mass publishing \u2014 which (before blogs) was\nvirtually limited to tech-savvy webmaster-types who also would likely find the\nDVD format fascinating \u2014 sparked several new websites, including early\nvanguards like The DVD Resource Page, The Digital Bits, and DVDFile.com. These\nwebsites, and the others who followed in their wake, did more than just offer\nthe latest industry gossip and movie reviews. They kept the DVD industry\nhonest by making sure that the earliest of consumers were radically informed\nabout their purchases. In fact, thanks to DVD websites, the \"blind\" purchase\nhas never been necessary. For consumers willing to research via mouse-clicks,\nDVD websites have offered a wealth of details about any given DVD's transfer\nquality and extras, often before new products reach store shelves.Combine that\nwith the fact that websites could be published not just once a day, but\nupdated several times per day, by multiple writers. Without that, DVD might\nlook very different in 2007. Thanks to the Web, some titles that didn't meet\nthe high standards that the format itself promised were re-issued with\nimproved transfers. Even more frequently, long-requested titles remained (and\nstill remain) off the market for years until studios could complete a print\nrestoration and compile enough extra features to make even the most cynical of\nDVD consumers excited about an upcoming release (and yes, waiting for a\nlandmark like King Kong was worth it). Internet reviewers and talkback\ncitizens pored over every significant title, evaluating the quality of the\nimage and audio, comparing the work to previous Laserdisc releases, catching\nbad crops and missing elements, and noticing small, important details that the\nmajority of us would miss. The vanguard of DVD websites that arrived between\n1997 and 1999 made the difference, trading out time and effort for the sake of\nimproving the format, inspiring widespread consumer confidence, and waging an\ninformation war against the now-defunct pay-to-play DIVX format by Circuit\nCity. In fact, if you remember the \"Open DVD\" campaign, you've been around for\na while.DVD won the war. In fact, it won a few wars \u2014 against DIVX, against\nthe VHS rental market, against mainstream consumer technophobia. And it\nhappened not just because of websites, but because every early DVD adopter\nbecame an evangelist for the format, until, within a few years, even the most\ncasual home-video viewers found a reason to invest in DVD, at least alongside\ntheir trusty VCR. For movie fans, the format has meant quality transfers,\nwidescreen presentations (for many, seeing full ratios on old favorites for\nthe first time), and a reason to buy good speakers and blackout curtains.But\nthe biggest battle was won in the mainstream, where such mattered far less\nthan usability. And this has been DVD's true value-add. We'd all like to think\nthat quality is what drove this format over the past decade, but that's not\nentirely true. In fact, the idea's more than a bit misleading. Quality has\nbeen a factor, but, compared to videotape, the intuitive DVD interface and\ndurable disc made it a logical purchase for just about everybody. Since 1997,\nthere simply haven't been any reasons not to invest in DVD, save for the fact\nthat it doesn't record. And, in the end, even that hasn't mattered much. MP3s\ndon't \"record\" either, but it's the usability of downloadable, digitally\ncompressed music that has caused it to supplant a good portion of CD sales,\njust as CDs replaced vinyl and cassettes, just as DVD has replaced movies on\nvideotape, and just as broadband viewing options are bound to chip away at\nDVD's market dominance in the foreseeable future. Usability, and clarity, wins\nthe mainstream. Always.* * *For those of us who enjoy watching movies at home\n\u2014 renters and collectors alike \u2014 the marketplace's far horizon looks vastly\ndifferent today than it did ten years ago. We see an ongoing format-battle\nbetween Blu-Ray and HD-DVD, with most studios taking sides in the matter. We\nalso see Apple making forays into the digital living room, hoping to crest the\nsort of technological watershed with iTV that they've already crossed with the\niPod and iTunes, putting downloadable movies on everyone's set-top box just as\nthey've put music in everyone's pocket. For most consumers, it's tempting to\nbatten the hatches and wait out the storm, if only to see where the rising\ntide takes us. It's also tempting to simply hang on to old-school DVD, which\nis reasonably high-def (with anamorphic transfers on most discs), supported by\nall vendors, cheap, and as comfortably reliable as an old pair of sneakers.For\nthe moment, neither new option \u2014 the competing HD formats, digital downloads \u2014\nhas offered a compelling argument to consumers. Downloads need to be simple,\nand while most people seem comfortable with putting a DVD in a tray, we know\nthat a significant portion of the consumer public still gets a rash when they\nhave to interact with a personal computer any more than absolutely necessary.\nMeanwhile, the format war between Blu-Ray and HD-DVD has been a stark\ndisappointment to many who eagerly bought into DVD in the late-'90s. Both\nhigh-def formats reached consumers before any clear winner emerged, creating\nan inevitable \"wait-and-see\" attitude. Considering the fallout from the VHS-\nBeta war of the 1980s, it's surprising that the industry has chosen to steer\nus on this course, particularly when there still are enough Beta supporters\nout there who remember all too well what happened when their expensive\ntechnology lost all support in the broader market. The recent decision by\nParamount and DreamWorks Animation to exclusively back HD-DVD (reported last\nweek) alongside Universal, means that only Warner Home Video is prepared to\nrelease product on both platforms, with the remainder of home-video vendors in\nthe larger Blu-Ray camp. A similar scenario in the 1990s would have doomed DVD\nto the fringes of the mainstream marketplace, if not to an early demise.\nInstead, when Terminator 2 became the first feature film on DVD with a layer-\nswitch (RSDL), allowing for uninterrupted viewing, nobody had to stop and\ncheck, \"Hey, will my DVD player read that disc?\" Yes, in 1997 it did. And it\nstill does.Waiting is easy. In fact, it's been made easy. High-def DVD may\noffer higher resolution and more interactive features, but it's no more simple\nto operate than standard DVD. And we all know that usability, not quality,\nwins the day. Jeffrey Katzenberg (the 'K' in DreamWorks SKG), as reported by\nVariety, said on a conference call to investors earlier this year \"Blu-Ray and\nHD DVD are a niche business... They're not going to become the next platform.\nI think for the general consumer, there is not a big enough delta between the\nstandard DVD in terms of where it is today and the next generation.\" We agree.\nDVD-Audio and its competitor, Super Audio CD (SACD), have not supplanted\nCompact Disc sales, even as CD sales \u2014 as nearly perfect a mass-media product\nas has ever been invented \u2014 find MP3 downloads denting their margins. Last we\nchecked, hi-resolution audio was consigned to a small shelf in the back of our\nnearest big-box electronics retailer, while every type of sleeve for every\nsize of iPod was stacked up on the nearest route to the cash registers. Roy\nScheider was right, gang. You're gonna need a bigger boat.* * *Nonetheless,\neven if the next generation of DVD Video has yet to emerge, standard DVDs have\nnow entered a slow, graceful decline \u2014 at least in terms of overall market\nshare. Figures vary from report to report, but sales are not anywhere near the\nboom figures that marked the earliest years of this decade, and many observers\ninsist it will never get there again. Most of the format's mainstream hardware\nadoption \u2014 a certain driver of DVD sales \u2014 is complete. The re-issue of\nseveral titles, as many as two or three times (the dreaded \"double-dip\") have\nbeen welcome in some circumstances for improved transfers, reviled in others\nfor slick re-packaging of an already existing product. And it hasn't been\ndifficult for plenty of DVD fans to hang on to their current films on DVD and\ncollect something entirely new, rather than get caught up in a Sisyphean cycle\nof upgrades \u2014 something hi-def DVD tempts on a much larger scale.Our shiny\nlittle platter has reached its peak. Home video is on the cusp of\nunprecedented fragmentation, and it's easy to wonder if we'll ever see the\nlikes of one simple, universal format ever again. In a few years, you may\nvisit a friend's home and watch a new movie on standard DVD, a high-def\nvariant, a download, or from a broadband service. You may have to make\ninquiries of a technical nature before you bring along your own viewing\nchoices. And, quite possibly, you may debate if it's better to see a movie in\na theater or at home, if the title has been released to both venues on the\nsame day.By the midpoint of this century, none of this may exist at all, with\nevery possible form of proprietary content \u2014 film, television, journalism,\nbooks, radio programs, music, your morning traffic report, even dust-covered\nscrolls lost in the basement-time of distant libraries \u2014 sliced, analyzed,\ndigitized, compressed, optimized, repackaged, marketed, and consumed by us in\nportions large and small via vaporous, intelligible technologies that today\nare the stuff of plausible imagination.This is the formidable, ongoing\nchallenge that faces those who are in the business of producing and selling\npackaged media: What is the value proposition of renting or owning a tangible\nproduct like a DVD? Partcularly when a good-quality version of the movie can\nbe ordered as video-on-demand, downloaded to a hard-drive, or seen in a\ntheater? How is that proposition clarified when more than one DVD format\nexists? Why rent? Why purchase? Will DVD websites and DVD consumers\nproselytize for these new formats as they did ten years ago? Will they once\nagain take up the fight and make it their own?Or is DVD, in fact, bound to\nbecome a niche item? Instead of being the King Kong of home-video\nrental/retail, swatting away all competitors like toy planes on strings, is it\nabout to be consigned to something as inconsequential as a consumer\npreference?Extras remain the format's true calling card \u2014 at the moment,\ndownloads and on-demand cannot compete with DVD's ability to compile a wide\nvariety of items in a single package with that magic word: clarity. Buy one\nthing, get several \u2014 commentaries, documentaries, deleted material. No need\nfor extra downloads, additional purchases. And if this indeed becomes the\nhallmark of DVD, it will force producers to include quality extras on as many\nreleases as possible, rather than asking consumers to settle for a trailer and\nEPK featurette. Multiple versions of a single film also are sure to bolster\nDVD's ongoing success, collected in the one thing that only packaged media can\noffer \u2014 an attractive box or case with high \"Wow!\" factor on a retailer's\nshelf. In fact, Warner Home Video's upcoming DVD release of Ridley Scott's\n1982 Blade Runner seems to be a final statement on the film itself, but also\nharbinger of DVD's future, where bottom lines will be supported by multi-disc\nsets, be they cinematic masterpieces or hit TV shows.But within that success\nmay lie more uncertainty, because a multi-disc release of Blade Runner is very\nmuch is for the True Fan and not for the casual viewer, who will happily turn\nto a competing delivery method to see the film (or a version of it) without\nthe need to pore over every detail or see five versions of what they consider\nto be the same thing. Most DVD viewers don't listen to commentaries (ask\nsomebody, anybody), while others only watch extras once or twice at most. And\nif that's the case, where does that leave DVD fans? The consumers who don't\nwant everything simple, who love the bitter details of every studio squabble\nand scraps of cutting-room floors? If this is the outcome, the most\nprofitable, heavily promoted DVDs eventually will resemble the Laserdiscs of a\nprevious generation, in scope and bulk. That would be fine. That also would be\na niche market.Then again, if DVD isn't as cool as it was ten years ago \u2014 and\nface it, it's not \u2014 at least is has the chance to be pretty cool again. As\ncool as it was when Fight Club arrived in its innovative fold-out digipak case\nthat contained two discs, a dark, thrilling film of violence and male bonding\n(one that almost could have been designed for the DVD demographic itself), and\nsurprising extras. For some, DVD began with Fight Club. For others, it never\nquite surpassed it. And, maybe, it could get back there again.Give it time.* *\n*As of this morning, The DVD Journal is ceasing publication. DVD first reached\nstore shelves ten years ago this week, and this website went online with its\nvery first DVD reviews nearly a year after that. Since then, we've posted\nalmost 4,000 DVD reviews, watched the retail sheets for the best upcoming\nDVDs, and hopefully steered a few folks into renting or purchasing movies they\notherwise might have overlooked.Compared to many websites, very few writers\nhave contributed to the Journal over the years, with a core group of around\nten based in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle. The editor\nwould like to thank all of them \u2014 it has been a privilege to be their first\nreader every week, and to be associated with a talented group of film critics\nwho also happen to be good friends. Our own world has changed in the past\ndecade as well, with marriages, children, new homes, career changes, and\nvarious other things that happen to sensible people when the subtle business\nof adulthood creeps up on them unawares.The writers would like to extend\nthanks to everyone in the home-video industry we have had contact with over\nthe past decade, from the hard-working publicists who do their best to get\nproducts out in advance of street-dates, to the miracle-worker technicians who\nhave done the most challenging, and most important, job of all \u2014 restoring\nclassic films to the best condition possible, allowing us to enjoy them at\nhome, and forever. For many, this was the one true promise of DVD, and we\nrarely have been disappointed. We would also like to extend a special thanks\nto the good folks at The Criterion Collection, who have always set the highest\nbar for others in the industry to watch, and who got into this business back\nwhen Laserdiscs were a niche, and thus made the transition to the mass market\nwith the greatest care, and as little fuss as possible.For now, we will leave\nthis website online, and while we won't be posting any regular features, all\nare welcome to return and get a look at a decade's worth of DVD, in\nreview.Finally, we thank our readers, for we too have been a niche of sorts,\nhappily reviewing movies and posting release news without the need to fling\naround pop-up ads or hawk particular products to cover our bottom line, or\nworry about our own \"growth\" for the sake of raw traffic numbers. We're glad\nyou made the time to drop by. We had fun. We hope you did, too.\u2014The\nEditorComments from the WebDVD SavantHollywood ElsewhereDVD TalkDVD PanacheDVD\nSpin DoctorCinematicalBetween ProductionsReader Talkback\u2022 I just read your\n'sayonara' posting. I'll be sad to see you go as I've been reading your\npostings almost daily for the past seven years. I hope that you may reconsider\nand start posting again, but in either case I'll thank you for all the great\nreviews over the years. -Matt\u2022 I've come to your site for the past 7 years,\nand have enjoyed reading your reviews and updates. Good luck in your future\nendeavors... You'll be missed. -Grant\u2022 Just wanted to let you know that I was\nincredibly disappointed to find out that your site was going dark. I have been\na regular reader for about six or seven years. You guys have done a fantastic\njob with the site. I own a small DVD rental chain and have always found your\nwebsite to be a valuable resource for info and reviews. Thank you and best of\nluck in the future. -Paul\u2022 Really enjoyed the site, it was a daily resource\nfor my hobby/addiction to DVDs. Best of luck to you as you move forward.\n-Marc\u2022 This is a very sad day, the Journal was like a friend that I could rely\non and trust I don't how many times the Journal made look like an industry\ninsider at dinner parties. I will so miss you guys and hope that this might be\ntemporary, the Journal has given me great joy and insight. Thank you. -Paul\u2022\nI'm saddened that you are shutting down DVD Journal... I've been with you\nsince nearly the beginning. Good luck in your future endeavors. -Joe\u2022 It's a\nrare thing for me to bother jotting a note to a publication, especially\nbecause I'm not really sure you'll ever see it. I just wanted to say that your\nDVD journal site has been a regular stomping ground of mine and I'll miss it.\nBeyond the seeming simplicity and organization of the site was the often\nhumorous and sharp criticism. I bet I've clicked by a couple times a week for\nquite a while. Thanks for the great reading material. I'm sure I'll continue\nto wander your archives... -Rich\u2022 I'm very sad to see you go, but very\nthankful for the past ten years. This was one of my favorite websites, one I\nrecommeded to friends over and over, always my first (and usually only) stop\nfor DVD info, and oftentimes my first stop on a Monday morning for the newest\nreviews. I'll miss you guys. So thank you again for a wonderful website.\n-Blake\u2022 RIP My favorite site! Thanks for many hours of enjoyment! -Tim\u2022 \"As of\nthis morning, The DVD Journal is ceasing publication.\" I could very easily\nhave missed this at the bottom of today's post, and I very nearly did. My jaw\nhit my desk with an audible (5.1 surround) thud! I am very sorry to see you\npack up. DVD Journal is/was my number 1 source for good, comprehensive and\nconsolidated DVD happenings. If you must close, I am very disappointed,\nhowever congratulations to you all for 10 years of fine work. -Ian\u2022 Upon\nreading today's announcement that DVD Journal is shutting down, I experienced\na most unwelcome deja vu flashback to when Cinefantastique terminated\npublication under its original editor - what a shame that a product of such\nsubstantial intellectual quality was no longer going to be available! Please\nreconsider. Like Cinefantastique, the other publications in your genre have\nbut a fraction of the quality and utility of DVD Journal. But if you're dead\nset on this crazyness, then I'd like to express my sincere thanks to the staff\nfor these many years of excellent service to the DVD-watching film enthusiast\ncommunity. Monday and Tuesday mornings, you were always my first stop on the\ninternet. -Don\u2022 I was both happy and sad this morning when I read your very\nfine retrospective of all things DVD, only to find out at the end that it was\nan eloquent and moving \"resignation\" letter. Your site has provided me with a\ntremendous amount of great information over the years on DVD, as well as\nmotivating me to purchase every disc on the Editor's Top 25 (none has\ndisappointed me!). Best wishes in whatever you do, and hopefully another site\ncan fill the void you leave (but I'm not counting on it). -Paul\u2022 Sad to see\none of the few reliable DVD sites out there fold its tent. Outstanding\nanalysis as a farewell, however. -Chris\u2022 I was sad to see that you're ceasing\npublication but wanted to thank you for all of the hard work that you and your\nteam have put into the site. I enjoyed checking the site each Monday and\nTuesday (especially Tuesday!) to get the latest news and future releases. Your\nTop 25 list, year in review lists, and MIA lists were also especially\nappreciated. Good luck with your future endeavors! -Mike\u2022 I feel I've been\npunched in the stomach. With great sadness I read your goodbye today. And I\nfeel responsible. Though I supported your site through clicks, I never once\ntook the time to offer a simple thanks for your important piece of my film\neducation. Your dedication to the film, rather than the indecipherable bit-\nratio/mega-something/edge-enhancement/halo-speak that permeates most other dvd\nreviews, made your site a frequent destination.So many times, when I really\nshould have been doing something else, I would find myself picking random\nreviews to read. Or, even reading the same review multiple times. The mix of\ndry humor, cinema knowledge, and pure enjoyment of film your reviewers crafted\nin their writings kept me entertained for hours.Please, please, please keep\nthe website active. Or, even collect the reviews in a book so they can be\nsaved forever. You and your team deserve it.Good luck to everyone. I hope they\nfind other outlets and I hope I'm able to find them when they do. Thank you.\n-RJ\u2022 Sorry to see that your site is shutting down -- over the years, it's been\na compelling read and a valuable resource (your New Release Calendar was the\nmost prompt and comprehensive of any site I've seen). You guys were terrific\nand your site will be missed -- thanks for all your work! -B.\u2022 I was shocked\nthat your website will no longer be updated. It was intelligently written and\nsomething I referenced every week. I have been in awe of the quality of the\neffort, and really appreciate all the years of thoughtful reviews and\ninformation. I'm tangentially involved in the business, (next week I'll be\nrecording a commentary), but as a fan of films of all stripes and varieties I\nam sorry to see you go, but very much appreciate the legacy and quality of\njournalism you have left behind. -Mel\u2022 Stumbling upon your announcement today\nwas akin to hearing that a distant but beloved relative had passed away. Even\nI was surprised by the sinking feeling in my stomach as I read the final\nparagraph.As a fellow reviewer (at movieline online) and admirer of your\nstaff's work, I'd appreciate it if you would pass along my compliments to them\nfor producing hands-down the best DVD \"film\" analysis on the web. In the\nchatroom era where every high-school punk with a half-baked opinion whines\n\"just write about the extras\" I've always been thankful that DVD Journal\nfocused on the films themselves. Your work will be missed. -Greg\u2022 You may or\nmay not actually see this, but I'd like to join the many, many folks who are\nprobably filling your email box with messages of thanks and please say it\nain't so... You guys have been a great resource and I am sorry to see you hang\nup your whatever it is people hang up these days when they quit doing\nsomething. -Jeremy\u2022 I was shocked and dismayed to read that you're shutting\ndown your website -- it was one of my regular duties to visit you each Monday\nand Tuesday religiously. Your site is probably the most intelligent and dense-\nwith-information on DVDs that exists. Sadly, it looks like I'll have to change\nthat to the past tense -- \"existed.\" Thanks for giving us so much, over so\nmany years. I'll miss you! -Rich\u2022 I'm very sad to hear you go. I first started\nreading The DVD Journal in 1999, shortly after the purchase of my first DVD\nplayer (1999, has it really been that long?). At the same time I discovered\nyour site, I discovered others; The Digital Bits, DVDFile.com, etc. And while\nI stopped checking in on those sites years ago, your insightful, well-written\nreviews have kept me coming back to The DVD Journal on a weekly basis.Indeed,\nDVDs have changed my life. When I purchased my first DVD player I was an\nexecutive in the transportation industry. But DVDs changed the way I looked at\nfilms. Little-by-little I was learning about the filmmaking process by listing\nto DVD commentary tracks, watching the \"making of\" extras, etc. I was hooked.\nA few years after the purchase of my DVD player, inspired in no small part by\nwhat I had seen and heard on DVDs, I would quit the transportation industry,\nand return to school - to study film. I am now a film editor at a post-\nproduction house in Chicago.Thank you for many years of enjoyable reading. You\nare among the best DVD sites on the web. You will be missed. -Jay\u2022 Thanks for\nyears of great reading. Your dissertations on the dvd format and your well-\nspoken reviews have been a staple of my internet reading for lo these many\nyears, and I am very reluctant to say goodbye. If there were only some way to\nchange your mind... basket of cookies, bourbon, maybe a helper monkey or\nthree?I hope the dissolution of the site does not signal the end of your\nreviewers' output. Please let us know where we can read more reviews from your\ncrew, and best of everything to the lot of you. Entertaining reads are rare\nenough; consistent quality even rarer. Your site delivered the goods, and I\nappreciate it. -Pat\u2022 Please accept my sincere thanks for the many hours of\ngreat reading you've provided me. Good luck in whatever you do next. -John\u2022 I\nwas very sad to read that you are suspending the DVD Journal. I have depended\nupon this site, more than any other site, for years, to notify me of upcoming\nreleases, and to give unbiased and informative reviews. I am a collector and\ncinephile; I have a little over 4000 DVDs, including a complete set of the\nCriterion Collection, and I found the DVD format from almost day 1 to be the\nanswer that I was looking for in order to enhance my movie-watching joy. I\nhated VHS, I hated rewinding tapes, I hated it all, and they were damned\nexpensive. DVD was it for me. I hope that you all have success in your future\npaths, and that you know that I, as well as countless others, will miss your\nsite. I hope that I can find another that is anywhere near what yours has\nbeen. Take care. -Kris\u2022 Saw the news about your site. Congratulations on your\nlong run and best of luck with any future projects you decide to get in on.\n-Mark\u2022 I just wanted to personally drop you a line and to tell you how sorry I\nam that you will no longer be publishing your website. I've enjoyed it for\nyears and have always found it to be informative, well written and extremely\ninsightful. There are numerous sites that I visit everyday, but I want you to\nknow that yours definately stood out in a very crowded cyber world. Best of\nluck and thanks for all the great reviews. -Francis\u2022 I haven't always agreed\nwith your policies, publishing schedule or opinions but I have always enjoyed\nvisiting your site. The content was thought provoking and well written and\nyes, your reviews prompted me on many occasions to purchase a DVD I might have\notherwise overlooked. Thank you for that. You will be sorely missed on Monday\nand Tuesday and as long as your reviews are still available, I will revisit\nfrom time to time. Again, thank you and good luck in whatever you decide to\npursue! -Marshall\u2022 I have enoyed your website for eight years now and was sad\nto see today that is was ceasing publication. When I was a Peace Corps\nVolunteer in Central America from 2000-2002, I looked forward to the two and\nhalf hour bus ride to the Peace Corps Headquaters to check my email and to see\nwhat was newly posted news and reviews awaited me at dvdjournal.com. The old\nschool non-colored Macs would seem to take an eternity to load the site, but\nit was always worth it. I would secretly print (paper was to be rationed for\nonly the most important of documents) reviews to take back to my site and pour\nover literally ever word whenever I had a free moment from my work (which was\nusually only over meals). These food-stained printed reviews and news followed\nme where work took me. Often I would become carsick trying to read as I\nbounced down shoddy roads in thirty year old school buses with no shocks.\nImagine my embarrassment when I had to tell my native girlfriend that I was\nnot constantly reading emails from home but reviews of movies that came on\nshiny discs like cds. Trust me when I tell you these are wonderful memories\nfor me. The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Dr. Strangelove, The Phantom Menace (cant\nwin them all), etc.. Reading about these gave me a little slice of american\nlife I never had access to where I was at. As a techno geek living in a third\nworld country with no TV and frequent power outages, it was like receiving\ncookies from mom in the middle of a war zone. Needless to say, the first thing\nI did when returning to the states was to turn all those stained, worn reviews\ninto shiny new dvds I still watch and enjoy today, all of which had been\nrecommended by dvdjournal.com. -Benjamin\u2022 I started reading DVDjournal kinda\nlate in the game (about two years ago) and I've been impressed with the\nwriting and analysis you've provided. I've wasted many a night picking through\nyour archives, though I guess I can hardly call it a waste. Your in depth\nreviews inspired me to start putting out my own video review blog just for\nfun. Thank you for a decade of excellent writing. Please keep your archives up\nfor awhile so I can reference them every now and then. -David\u2022 Just want to\nadd my thanks to all the others. Your page was also for me the first stop on a\nMonday morning. What you had that put it there was a straightforward layout.\nToo many sites dazzle the viewer with ads, selections, pictures etc in all\ncolours. You provided the information I wanted in a direct, easy-to-use\nmanner. You will be sorely missed. Best wishes to all the team for their\nfuture. -Jack (Switzerland)\u2022 I finish my Labor Day weekend only to find\nDVDJournal, a site I've religiously bookmarked and visited for over 7 years,\nis going away. I want to thank you for so many well-written film reviews, even\nthe ones I didn't agree with. Compared to most DVD review websites, your film\nreviews were comparable to the pros and sometimes more well-written in their\nbrevity and specificity. You also triumphed the smaller indie, foriegn, and\nclassic film releases that other DVD sites tended to overlook or ignore. Thank\nyou, thank you, thank you. One of my favorite aspects of the site was checking\nin each week to see which new release would get the \"star treatment\" and which\nreleases you would herald with a star for each new Tuesday. You also had the\nbest New Release calendar of any site online and your review database was\nnicely organized. I will also miss your year-end round-up of the best DVD\nreleases, which was also a good list to work backwards from in updating and\nadding to my film library.Thank you again. My DVD shopping in the future will\nsuffer without DVDJournal but I hope the time away treats you all well. -Joel\u2022\nWhat! How dare you! What were we paying you for?Seriously, very sorry to see\nyou go and many thanks for all the useful information you provided me over the\nyears to make my DVD buying decisions. -D.\u2022 I just checked in to your web\nsite, as I have every Tuesday for years, to find that you will no longer be\nupdating your site. I cannot express what a great loss this is to DVD\ncollectors everywhere. I have relied on your site for news on new releases,\ninsight into films that I had never heard of, and information on films I had\nwritten-off that made me re-evaluate those films, often for the better. It is\nwith great sorrow that I send this email to wish you the best of whatever\ncomes next for you. Thank you for being part of my life for so long. -Paul\u2022\nI'm sorry to see that you're hanging up the guns. I've been checking in\nregularly for many, many years (I bought the Criterion Spinal Tap off the\nshelf on release date, dammit, and then played it in my 20-pound Pioneer\nDVD/LD combi-player). While any of a jillion cookie-cutter sites could tell\nyou how many deleted scenes a disc had or what format the soundtrack was in, I\ncould always count on your site for an insightful few paragraphs on the film\nitself from a reviewer I might not agree with but whose opinion I could trust\nwas founded on actual knowledge of film. Thanks for making the web a smarter\nplace for the last ten years. You'll be missed. -Ryan\u2022 After reading your\ncomprehensive and excellent critique of the video industry I was certainly\ntaken aback when I read that your site would be discontinued. Your site was\none of the best on the web. I would like to give kudos to everyone involved in\nthis wonderful site. Their time and effort was very much appreciated. Your\nweekly site will be missed. -Greg\u2022 I purchased \"Brazil\" based on your review\nand it is without a doubt my all time favorite movie. I was only 11 in 1985,\nand completely unaware of 'good movies'. If not for dvdjournal.com. I never\nwould have known about this incredible film. (and a few others). Thanks so\nmuch. Best wishes. (p.s. going to dvdjournal.com on mondays will be a HARD\nhabit to break.) -James\u2022 I am sorry to hear that your site is ending. I have\nbeen reading your reviews for about five years. I found your commentary to be\nfair, intelligent and personable. These are rare qualities, particularly when\npeople are talking about movies and especially when these people are on the\ninternet. I'll miss your site and insight. Good luck. -MichaelTuesday, 28 Aug.\n2007On the Street: There's just a few DVDs to pick up this week as we head\ninto the Labor Day weekend, including Paramount/DreamWorks Blades of Glory and\nA Night At the Roxbury starring Will Ferrell, Year of the Dog with Molly\nShannon, a re-issue of Dr T & the Women, and the complete first season of\nHeroes.

The love\nfor this sadly misbegotten show has been intense, stoked by the release of the\nfeature film Serenity (2005), and kept alive by a loyal network of fans who\ncall themselves \"Browncoats\" after the duster worn by series star Nathan\nFillion. Years after the show's cancellation and the film's release, Serenity\nlovers flock to annual \"Serenity Now\" showings in 47 U.S. cities each June,\ncelebrating Whedon's birthday with charity events benefiting the human-rights\norganization Equality Now. Recently, weekly \"Firefly\" episodes screening at a\nPortland, Ore. brewpub attracted around 250 people each week, despite\nshowtimes that began at 10 p.m. in the middle of the work week. Internet\nbulletin boards, mailing lists, and websites like Serenity Tales offer\n\"Firefly\" lovers a chance to not only connect with each other, but to create\ntheir own adventures in the Serenity 'verse \u2014 fans even organized a \"Browncoat\nCruise\" to Mexico slated for December 2007, a sort of sci-fi convention at\nsea. The tenacious, continued support for the TV show and movie even inspired\na documentary on the subject, Done the Impossible, which debuted at the 2007\nComic-Con in San Diego. Game players will get to create their own characters\nin the \"Firefly\" universe starting sometime in 2008, when a MMOG (massively\nmultiplayer online game) based on the series reportedly will be released by\nMultiverse Network, Inc. And in June, 2007, astronaut Steven Swanson brought\n\"Firefly\" and Serenity DVDs along with him on the Space Shuttle Atlantis,\ndonating the discs to the International Space Station's crew.Whedon has\nremained characteristically modest about the love for Serenity, telling one\ninterviewer, \"I think it's lovely for people to say that Serenity is this\ngeneration's Star Wars, but I don't think it's accurate. Star Wars had a\ncultural impact that is unprecedented and almost untraceably large. Serenity\nis not that. It's like comparing apples to... unbelievably huge apples.\" But\nstill, the executives at Universal Pictures know a moneymaker when they see\none. \"Firefly\" fans, being smart enough to know that nothing impresses a\nstudio like cold, hard cash, have continued to support Whedon's brainchild by\npurchasing multiple copies of the TV show box set and the first Serenity DVD\nrelease (both shoot to the top of Amazon's rankings during the \"Serenity Now\"\nevents every June), and that devotion has paid off with the creation of a\n\"Collector's Edition\" release of the film. Whedon has even allowed that\nthere's the slim possibility of another movie if this DVD sells well, saying,\n\"It's probably not being discussed in board rooms right now, but the fact of\nthe matter is, if it makes enough money, sooner or later they say, 'Hey \u2014 this\nis money!'\" For those unfamiliar with the world of Serenity, Whedon's space\nopera still works beautifully as a stand-alone film, a wickedly wrought homage\nto classic sci-fi, Indiana Jones-style serial adventures, and shoot-'em-up\nWestern pictures. It's a geeky thrill ride designed to appeal to hardcore\nmovie lovers (and, yes, to fans of the TV show), but be warned \u2014 once you see\nSerenity you'll want to run right out and get the \"Firefly\" box set, and once\nyou're through with that, you'll understand the Browncoats' frustration that\nthere are no more adventures forthcoming from Serenity's crew. You may even\nfind yourself haunting Internet chat rooms and booking a cruise to Mexico to\nget your Whedon fix. Don't say we didn't warn you.Universal Studios Home\nEntertainment's two-disc Serenity: Collector's Edition offers all of the bonus\nfeatures from the previous DVD release \u2014 the original commentary track by Joss\nWhedon, an introduction filmed by Whedon to precede early screenings of the\nmovie (4 min.), a blooper reel (6 min.), nine deleted scenes (14 min.), \"We'll\nHave a Fruity Oaty Good Time,\" in which Whedon discusses the creation of the\nbizarre Japanese commercial (2 min.), and three behind-the-scenes featurettes\n\u2014 plus another 60 minutes of new bonus features, including an additional,\nbrand-new commentary track with Whedon and stars Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin,\nSummer Glau, and Ron Glass that's funny, silly, informative, and a whole lot\nof fun. The new \"making-of\" featurette, \"A Filmmaker's Journey,\" is a\ndetailed, behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie with reminisces by\ncast and crew (20 min.); \"Sci Fi Inside: Serenity\" is a pretty standard\npromotional piece hosted by Baldwin (4 min.); \"Session 416\" offers up five\ncreepy Internet teasers that show River being interviewed by doctors back\nduring her time at the Academy (8 min.); \"Take a Walk on Serenity\" is a\nhilarious tour of the ship with Whedon, Fillion, Baldwin, and Alan Tudyk \u2014\naccording to Whedon, the ship's bridge \"has a lot of blinking lights. And as\nwe all know, blinking lights means science.\"(4 min.); \"The Green Clan\" looks\nat the contributions of DP Jack Green and his crew \u2014 several of whom were\nmembers of his family (3 min.); and four extended scenes that don't add much,\nbut are an enjoyable addition for fans nonetheless. Serenity: Collector's\nEdition is on the street now.Box Office: The traditional August box-office\nslump \u2014 when Hollywood studios dump less-promising titles on the market during\nthe back-to-school run-up \u2014 kicked in over the weekend with four wide titles\nfailing to open higher than fourth place, giving Sony's teen-raunch Superbad\nits second straight win and $68.5 million in the bank. Arriving in fourth was\nUniversal's Mr. Bean's Holiday starring Rowan Atkinson, which garnered $10.1\nmillion (for a movie nearing $200 million in overseas release), barely beating\nout Lionsgate's War starring Jet Li and Jason Statham, which marked an even\n$10 million. MGM's The Nanny Diaries starring Scarlett Johansson and Laura\nLinney opened in sixth with $7.8 million, while Resurrecting the Champ with\nSam Jackson and Josh Hartnett failed to make the grade with a mere $1.8\nmillion. Critics were mixed on Champ and Bean, less kind to War and Diaries.In\ncontinuing release, Universal's The Bourne Ultimatum is on track to break $200\nmillion, easily holding second place after one month in theaters, while New\nLine's Rush Hour 3 is over the century with $109 million after three sessions.\nFox's The Simpsons Movie is another substantial contributor to Hollywood's $4\nbillion summer, charting $173.4 million. Paramount's Stardust is stuck on the\nmidlist with just $26.4 million, followed by New Line's popular Hairspray,\nwhich has drawn $107.4 million. Heading for a second life in smaller theaters\nbefore much longer is Warner's The Invasion, which stumbles to tenth place in\nits second weekend with just $11.5 million. And off to DVD prep is Universal's\nI Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, which will close above $110 million.New\nfilms due to arrive over the Labor Day frame include Balls of Fury starring\nChristopher Walken on Wednesday, followed on Friday by Death Sentence starring\nKevin Bacon, as well as Rob Zombie's Halloween. Here's the top-grossing movies\nat North American theaters from last weekend:\n\n  1. Superbad (Sony) $18,000,000 ($68,572,000 through 2 weeks)\n  2.

Mamet's play\nGlengarry Glen Ross had seen phenomenal success on Broadway, and it earned\nMantegna a Tony Award for his role as Richard Roma. As Mantegna tells the\nstory, Mamet personally came backstage to give him the news that the play was\ngoing to be made into a feature film \u2014 and that Al Pacino would be playing\nRoma. Mamet, who's known for his loyalty to his friends, then handed Mantegna\ntwo screenplays and promised him that, no matter what, he had first crack at\nstarring in them. The first of those films, House of Games (1988's Things\nChange was the second) is immersed in one of the idiosyncratic writer's pet\nsubjects \u2014 the confidence game. Co-written by Jonathan Katz \u2014 yes, that Dr.\nKatz \u2014 and with expert supervision by magician and card-sharp Ricky Jay (who\nalso makes his film debut here), House of Games crackles with energy as layer\nafter layer of scam artistry is peeled away in a story full of double- and\ntriple-twists. It's native territory for Mamet's trademark dialogue \u2014 stilted\nand curt, both base and profound.Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) is an\nexpert in the psychology of compulsive behavior. And though she approaches her\npatients \u2014 and receives praise from readers of her book on the subject \u2014 with\ncold reserve, she works non-stop, rarely withdrawing for personal pleasure. To\nMargaret, the complex troubles of her patients are nothing more than\nperplexing puzzles to be solved, intricate mystery novels that will all fall\ninto place if she can correctly dissect and interpret the symbolism. But\nstill, Margaret is aware that her clever analysis, while intellectually\nsatisfying, can never ease the ache felt by her subjects. Intrigued by the\n\"real world\" driving one client \u2014 Billy, a gambler in heavy debt \u2014 to\ncontemplate suicide, Margaret makes a bold move and promises him she will\nhelp. And not with analysis, but with action. Naively confident, Margaret\nmarches boldly into the seedy neighborhood haunted by bookie and con man Mike\n(Joe Mantegna) and demands that he forgive Billy's IOU. Incredibly, he agrees\n\u2014 but on one condition. And so Margaret begins exploring a ruthless world of\ndeceit that appeals to her own latent obsessions and exposes a side of her\npersonality she had previously suppressed.As a first-time film director on\nHouse of Games, Mamet's background in stage work hampers the film's early\nscenes set in Margaret's professional world. It may be by design that the\nexchanges between the doctor and her patients \u2014 and even her mentor \u2014 feel\nartificial and are saddled with unspeakably purple dialogue. And it doesn't\nhelp that Crouse (Mamet's wife at the time), while suitably icy, never seems\ncomfortable or natural with the author's style the way Mantegna is. However,\nmost of the film is perfect Mamet \u2014 hard and blunt, yet taking place in a\nslightly surreal, cerebral world where nothing is as it seems, but where the\nmost deceitful agent is the self. Those not familiar with Mamet's style may be\nput off by House of Games' stage-bound quality, especially in the awkward\nopening scenes. But as the film eases into smoother territory, it provides a\nhearty, engrossing, and satisfying transition for the artist into film. Even\nthough House of Games was an obscure release by Hollywood standards, it\nsignaled the rise of Mantegna \u2014 part of Mamet's favored stable of actors \u2014\nfrom ethnic supporting actor to leading man. Unfortunately, it didn't last\nlong, with his best work coming in Mamet's Things Change and the brilliant\nHomicide (1991). Also on display are early appearances by a few other Mamet\nfavorites, the late J.T. Walsh and a young William H. Macy.The Criterion\nCollection's DVD release of House of Games is a huge improvement over MGM's\nprevious disc, offering a beautifully clean, remastered anamorphic transfer (\n1.78:1) with excellent contrast and nice color saturation. The Dolby Digital\n1.0 audio is more than adequate, given the dialogue-heavy nature of the film.\nThe fascinating commentary track features Mamet and Ricky Jay, who discuss the\nnuts-and-bolts of making the film with a lot of information on the ways in\nwhich Jay helped Mamet to maintain authenticity as regards the world of\nconfidence men. Fans of Mamet will appreciate his detailed digressions on his\nwriting process, and his candid anger about how the film was treated by the\nstudio. Also on board is a production documentary created by Mamet as a\npromotional tool, with behind-the-scenes footage and storyboards (25 min.);\nnew interviews (each about 15 minutes) with actors Lindsay Crouse and Joe\nMantegna; and the storyboards for a scene that was reworked for the film, \"The\nTap,\" which was rewritten by Jay and Mamet so as not to reveal the secrets\nbehind a popular grift that some of Jay's associates liked to use. There's\nalso the theatrical trailer, as well as a 30-page booklet featuring an essay\nby critic Kent Jones and excerpts from Mamet's notes on the published\nscreenplay. House of Games: The Criterion Collection is on the street\ntomorrow.Box Office: Writer/director Judd Apatow and co-writer Seth Rogen\nreturned to the top of the box-office chart over the weekend with the raunchy\nhigh-school comedy Superbad, which opened with $31.2 million, easily exceeding\nthe film's $20 million budget and giving the team another hit in the wake of\nKnocked Up and The 40-Year Old Virgin. Have far more difficulty was Warner's\nThe Invasion starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, which managed just $6\nmillion for fifth place, while The Weinstein Co.'s The Last Legion failed to\ncrack the top ten with a meager $2.5 million. Critics loved Superbad, while\nInvasion and Legion earned poor reviews.In continuing release, last week's\nwinner Rush Hour 3 starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker slipped to second\nplace, adding $21.8 million to $88.1 million overall, while Universal's\nstylish The Bourne Ultimatum held on to third place, boosting its three-week\ntotal to $163.8 million. Also bringing in plenty of doughnuts is Fox's The\nSimpsons Movie, which has logged $165.1 million after one month. However,\nParamount's Stardust starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro is on the\nmidlist in its second week with $19 million. Breaking the $100 million mark\nafter five frames is New Line's Hairspray. And off to DVD prep is Paramount's\nTransformers, which cleared $300 million.Plenty of new films go wide in\ntheaters this Friday, including Resurrecting the Champ starring Sam Jackson\nand Josh Hartnett, The Nanny Diaries with Scarlett Johansson, War starring Jet\nLi and Jason Statham, Illegal Tender, and Mr. Bean's Holiday.

Scott Frank's\nbackground has heretofore mainly been that of a well-respected script doctor,\nand as solo (or nearly so) writer of Minority Report (2002), Out of Sight\n(1998), Get Shorty (1995), Little Man Tate (1991), and Dead Again (1991).\nSomewhere along the way he also wrote the The Lookout, and after a number of\nstalled greenlights he decided to direct it himself. He did one hell of a job.\nGordon-Levitt (Mysterious Skin, Brick) plays Chris Pratt, once the hockey-star\ngolden boy of his small Kansas town, now the brain-damaged survivor of a car\naccident that killed two of his closest friends. The injury has left him with\nsuch a severely short-term memory that he carries a small notebook in order to\nscribble down reminders about going to work and taking his medications; he\ncarries a spare key in his shoe because he always locks himself out of his\ncar. But mainly he carries a load of guilt about the accident that made him\nthis way, which was entirely his fault. His support system consists of a live-\nin helper, Lewis (Jeff Daniels), a caring case worker (Carla Gugino, who\nregrettably has just one scene), and a couple of town locals who keep an eye\non him as he works as night janitor in the town bank. A confluence of details\n\u2014 Chris' cognitive difficulties, the relative lack of security at the bank,\nand the laid-back town cop (Sergio de Zio) \u2014 conspire to make the bank ripe\nfor robbery, and a greasy charmer named Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode) befriends\nChris in order to use him as part of the heist.Scott Frank worked closely with\nauthor Elmore Leonard to develop the screenplays for Get Shorty and Out of\nSight, and when the latter was turned into the short-lived TV show \"Karen\nSisco\" (which starred Gugino), Frank was brought in as head writer. He learned\na lot at the master's knee, and there's a lot of Leonard's style in The\nLookout, not the least in the well-crafted supporting characters. As the\nvillain of the piece, Spargo is the devil incarnate \u2014 first he charms Chris\nwith flattery, then he introduces him to a gorgeous former stripper named\nLuvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher), and he finally seals the deal in a wickedly\nwritten monologue in which he verbalizes every fear and insecurity that haunts\nChris with canny, seductive intuition. By the time he's done, it's not only\nunderstandable why Chris would go along with the bank robbery, it sounds like\nit's his best option \u2014 until an unexpected moment of respect from Chris' boss\nsnaps him back to reality, but by then he's in too deep. As Lewis, \u2014 a blind,\ngregarious ex-hippie \u2014 Jeff Daniels is as much mentor to Chris as he is hired\ncompanion, and he includes Chris in his dream to open a restaurant called\n\"Lew's Your Lunch.\" Lewis reveals to Luvlee that he's more than just a\ndisabled teddy bear when he tells her that he lost his sight working in an\nunventilated meth lab \u2014 then, after casually asking the girl about Spargo, she\nsays, \"Do you know Gary?\" and Lewis replies, \"Oh, I've known a lot of Garys. A\nlot of Luvlees, too.\" Frank's screenplay is (as should be expected from a\nwriter with his reputation) exquisitely crafted, and every twist of the plot\nand notable detail along the way comes together in the story's final act. It's\na remarkably assured film for a first directorial effort, with beautiful,\ncarefully considered images and an understanding that character development is\nwhat compels a viewer to throw in with a film emotionally. The whole thing's\nanchored by a nuanced, compelling performance by Gordon-Levitt, who once again\nproves what an amazing, under-appreciated actor he is. It's the sort of small,\ntightly wound thriller that was once the bread and butter of Hollywood\nstudios, and which we rarely see anymore. In fact, Frank's next film had\nbetter be awfully good \u2014 he's already set the bar pretty high for\nhimself.Buena Vista/Miramax's DVD release of The Lookout offers a beautiful\nanamorphic transfer (2.40:1) \u2014 at least some (perhaps all) of the movie was\nshot using the new Panavision Super 35 Digital camera, and it's virtually\nindistinguishable from film stock. The difference however, is that Frank and\nDP Alar Kivilo were able to use existing light in even the night scenes, yet\nit's never murky or indistinct. The DD 5.1 audio is fine, given that there's\nnot much need for fancy sound tricks here. Extras include a commentary track\nwith Frank and Kivilo that's heavy on production specifics, plus the\nfeaturettes \"Behind the Mind of Chris Pratt,\" which looks at Gordon-Levitt's\ntake on the character (9 min.), and \"Sequencing The Lookout,\" a pretty\ndetailed \"making-of\" piece that covers everything from creation of the script\nand getting financing to casting and production (20 min.). The Lookout is on\nthe street tomorrow.Box Office: The strong August box-office continued over\nthe weekend as New Line's Rush Hour 3 starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker\ntook in $50 million, easily beating last week's winner, The Bourne Ultimatum.\nThe win marks the final tentpole release of the summer, as well as the sixth\n\"threequel\" title in a sequel-heavy season. Arriving in fourth place was\nParamount's fantasy-adventure Stardust starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert\nDe Niro, which had a modest $9 million break, while Sony's Daddy Day Camp\nplotzed into tenth place with $5 million. Critics liked Stardust, while Hour\nand Camp earned generally poor reviews.In continuing release, Universal's The\nBourne Ultimatum starring Matt Damon continued its late-summer haul, adding\n$33.6 million to a $132.3 million 10-day gross, while Fox's The Simpsons Movie\nhas cleared $152.2 million in three sessions. Buena Vista's live-action\nUnderdog hangs on to a top-five spot as well, now with $24.7 million in the\nbag. New Line's Hairspray has been a hit with fans and is verging on triple-\ndigits with $92.1 million, and Universal's I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry\nwith Adam Sandler and Kevin James is over the century with $103.8 million.\nMeanwhile, off to DVD prep is Buena Vista's Ratatouille, which should clear\n$190 million.New films arriving in theaters this weekend include The Invasion\nstarring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, Superbad, and The Last Legion. Here's\nthe top-grossing movies at North American theaters from last weekend:\n\n  1. Rush Hour 3 (New Line) $50,240,000 ($50,240,000 through 1 week)\n  2.
