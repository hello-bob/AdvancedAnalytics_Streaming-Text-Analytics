Ask me how I\nknow\n\nSource: AI illustration by Jesse Rogala/The Standard\n\n## By Naz Khorram\n\n## Share\n\n  * Email\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Telegram\n\n  * WhatsApp\n\n  * Reddit\n\nPublished Apr. 20, 2024 \u2022 7:00am\n\nFive years ago, I decided to pursue my dream and launch Arcana, a wine bar,\nrestaurant and entertainment venue on the Mission Street corridor. Little did\nI know what it would take to open those doors: years of hard work, heartache,\nblind alleys and bad-faith conversations. It almost led me to give up hope.\n\nMost notably, reforms to the city\u2019s planning code intended to streamline the\nprocess, such as the Community Business Priority Processing Program, turned\nout to be nothing but a mirage.\n\nAs I started my application process with the city, I was told that I should\nengage with neighborhood \u201cstakeholders\u201d for their approval. Since this did not\nsound like following the formal process for starting a business, I reached out\nto the Mayor\u2019s Office of Economic and Workforce Development and the office of\nthe current District 9 supervisor, Hillary Ronen, for clarification.\n\nThey sent me on a year-long journey talking to pressure groups abusing the\nconditional use authorization process. Contrary to official rules, these\ngroups demanded that Arcana close at 10 p.m., imposing guidelines on the\nvenue\u2019s design, the artists we could hire and even the food we could serve,\ntelling us we were not allowed to be a vegan restaurant.\n\nMany other businesses have been through this, where local groups claiming to\nprotect the character of a neighborhood impose a list of demands, trying to\nforce a private memorandum of understanding under threat of delays and\nboycotts.\n\nKeeping City Hall in the loop did not bring me any support. One person in the\nMayor\u2019s Office actually told me that \u201csometimes you just need to kiss the\nring.\u201d\n\nDespite the pressure, I resisted; I had to protect my business from this\ninterference. As an Iranian asylum seeker and political activist, I was beyond\nintimidation. I sent a detailed explanation of the events to the planning\ncommission and faced the public hearing with heart-aching uncertainty.\nSomehow, I prevailed and was able to open Arcana\u2019s doors mid-pandemic.\n\nToday, Arcana employs 15 staff members, contracts with a dozen local service\nproviders, supports over 30 winemakers, vendors, and farmers and hosts over\n100 musicians and performers annually.\n\n## Dead ends and sapped spirits\n\nThe 2020 \u201cSave Our Small Businesses Initiative\u201d (Prop H) and other recent\nlegislative reforms were drafted with the intent of improving the small\nbusiness permitting process. The reality differs. While opening a restaurant,\nbar or entertainment venue no longer requires special approval on some\ncommercially zoned transit streets in San Francisco, special approval is still\nrequired on 24th Street in the Mission, along Mission Street and in most of\nSouth of Market.\n\nIn other words: The neighborhoods that need investments and resources the most\nare still tied up in red tape.\n\nIn corridors where Prop. H did take effect, converting an office space to an\nentertainment venue still takes months. That is when the use is already\nallowed by zoning: Over 30 days where Prop. H applies and six to nine months\nwhere it does not.\n\nImagine trying to open a music venue, which requires an entertainment permit\nthat takes another two to four months, plus a 30-day public notice for people\nto comment, plus mandatory neighborhood outreach and a hearing before the\nEntertainment Commission. Any opposition from a neighbor, neighborhood group,\nor competitor can further stall the process.\n\nBusiness operators must also pass inspections by the San Francisco Fire\nDepartment, Department of Public Health and Department of Building Inspection\nfor plumbing, electrical and building compliance. Waiting for a license from\nthe Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which includes an FBI background\ncheck, adds two to six months. This administrative and financial burden can\nquickly turn into a dead end and sap even determined entrepreneurs\u2019 energy,\ndetermination and bank accounts.\n\nAs I consider opening a second art and entertainment venue, I am frustrated by\nthe extensive paperwork and community outreach still required, despite the\nlatest legislation intended to aid small businesses. Streamlining exemptions\nforced me to reject some locations due to the excessive administrative and\nfinancial burden.\n\nAdditionally, concerns about public safety and street conditions in certain\nareas could deter customers, making those options unviable. Business operators\nhave been seeking rent-free leases until they are up and running, but\nlandlords are hesitant to agree due to fear of conflicts with the planning\ndepartment that could delay openings.\n\nAlthough the city has improved its permitting support, my experience with\nArcana taught me that the many different city agencies do not coordinate well.\nDespite my efforts since June 2023, I have yet to find a suitable location\nwith the right conditions.\n\nSan Francisco faces a critical moment with a 31.6% vacancy rate in commercial\nreal estate, affecting major retailers, restaurants, bars, entertainment\nspaces, music venues, and theaters. It signals the need for imaginative urban\nplanning, moving beyond bureaucratic constraints and political games. We need\na shift toward data-driven and economically sound strategies, focusing on\ncommercial corridors.\n\nEnvision our high streets bustling with life, where vibrant commercial\ncorridors feature public art, community gardens, museums, theaters, arcades,\nand thriving bars and restaurants. Thousands of small businesses, artists, and\ninnovators could create jobs and draw tourists and locals alike.\n\nOther cities have faced similar challenges and succeeded. San Bruno reinvented\nTanforan Mall following its closure and San Antonio, Texas, transformed Pearl\nBrewery. Why does San Francisco's vivid vision remain unrealized?\n\nTo radically transform downtown and our other commercial corridors, we must\nreform our planning code for businesses. It is essential to fast-track all\nart, entertainment, restaurant, and bar applications by removing red tape and\npublic hearings citywide. Eliminate the 30-day neighborhood notification and\noutreach requirements, change of use processes, discretionary reviews, and\ncaps on eating and drinking places. Businesses would still be required to\nfollow all building, plumbing, electrical, fire, health, and police codes.\n\nWe can revolutionize the city's urban fabric, converting underutilized office\nspaces and large commercial vacant properties into dynamic centers of\ncreativity and leisure. This would re-establish San Francisco as a landmark\nfor arts and entertainment and a hub for the hospitality industry.\n\nIf San Francisco listens to small business owners and empowers us to reinvent\nthe city from the bottom up, we can achieve this transformation together.\n\nNaz Khorram is a small business advocate and co-founder of Mission Vibrant, an\ninitiative bringing art, entertainment and investment to the Mission Street\ncorridor.
