It continuously monitors the Wi-Fi environment and detects any deauthentication packets, which could signify an attack.\n\n  * telegram_bot: This directory contains a Python script for a Telegram bot. The bot is designed to alert users of potential Wi-Fi intrusions and provides helpful information on immediate steps to take, common attacks, and general security tips.\n\n  * certificates: This directory contains the necessary certificates to ensure secure communication with the Pushover API for sending notifications.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Attack Tools : Includes handshake capture, brute forcing, and WPS attacking.\n  * Detection Methods : Monitor packet rates, alert users, and use Arduino.\n  * Cloud Integration : Utilizes cloud-based services for real-time attack detection.\n\n### ESP8266 Intrusion Detection\n\n  * Real-time monitoring of Wi-Fi channels for deauthentication packets\n  * Automated alert system via Pushover API when potential intrusion is detected\n  * System checks to minimize false alarms and promote accurate notifications\n\n### Telegram Bot\n\n  * Command handling for various requests such as /help, /immediate_help, and /security_tips\n  * Detailed guidance on immediate steps to take upon a Wi-Fi attack\n  * Information on common Wi-Fi attacks, prevention tips, and how to respond\n  * An interactive and user-friendly interface to enhance user awareness\n\n## Getting Started\n\n  1. Gather all the required components listed in the prerequisites section.\n  2. Follow the detailed installation instructions to set up the hardware and software components.\n\n## Installation\n\n### ESP8266 Intrusion Detection Setup\n\nThe ESP8266 module can detect and alert you to potential deauthentication\nattacks in real-time by using a cloud service like Pushover, which is free for\nthe first 30 days. Follow the steps below to set it up:\n\n  1. Pushover Account Setup:\n\n     * Create a Pushover account and obtain your User and API tokens. This process is not covered here, but a detailed setup guide is available at Pushover's documentation page.\n  2. Loading the Sketch:\n\n     * Open Arduino IDE and copy the code provided above into a new sketch.\n     * Insert the correct values for your Wi-Fi credentials, Pushover User Token, and API Key into the sketch.\n\n    \n    \n    const char* ssid = \"Your Wifi Name\"; const char* password = \"Your Wifi Password\"; const char* apiToken = \"Your Pushover API Token\"; const char* userToken = \"Your Pushover User Token\";\n\nUpload the sketch to your ESP8266 module.\n\n  3. Setting Up Certificates:\n\n     * Ensure the Pushover root CA certificate is included in the certificates directory and properly referenced in the script.\n  4. Operational Behaviour:\n\n     * After an attack is no longer recognized or has stopped, the ESP8266 will send a notification to your smartphone.\n     * Please note: upon connecting the ESP8266 to USB for the first time, a notification will be sent to your smartphone. This is a false positive and should be disregarded.\n  5. Restart After Attack:\n\n     * In the event of the detection of a deauthentication attack, the ESP8266 is programmed to restart to ensure it reconnects to the Wi-Fi network and sends out an alert\n\n### Telegram Bot Setup\n\nSet up the Telegram bot to interact with users to provide information and\nalerts:\n\n  1. Bot Creation:\n\n     * Create a new bot via the BotFather on Telegram and obtain the API token.\n  2. Script Configuration:\n\n     * Replace the placeholder BOT_TOKEN in the telegram_bot.py script with your bot's API token.\n\n    \n    \n    BOT_TOKEN = 'Your Bot API Token'\n\nSet your bot's web link appropriately.\n\n    \n    \n    YOUR_BOT_LINK = 'https://t.me/YourBotUsername'\n\n  4. Dependencies Installation:\n\n     * Ensure you have Python installed on your system.\n     * Install the pyTelegramBotAPI library using pip:\n\n    \n    \n    pip install pyTelegramBotAPI\n\n  5. Running the Bot:\n\nRun the bot script in your environment:\n\n    \n    \n    python telegram_bot.py\n\nThe bot should now be live and responding to commands.\n\n  6. Customizing Commands:\n\nEdit the bot's responses and commands within the script to fit your needs.\n\n## Configuration\n\nFor configuration details, please refer to the comments within the script\nitself, which provide specific pointers on setting various parameters such as\nLED pin, Baud rate, scan time per channel, and packet rates.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter following the installation and setup steps, your system will:\n\n  * Monitor for deauthentication packets signaling a possible attack.\n  * Illuminate an LED or perform other actions as defined in the intrusion_detection.ino when an attack is detected.\n  * Use the Telegram bot to inform users about potential security threats and offer advice on how to act accordingly.\n  * Ensure all communications for alerts are securely sent through Pushover with the provided certificate.\n\nFor further assistance, please refer to the instructions within the respective\ncomponent directory.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions and suggestions to improve the SentinelEye-WIDS\nproject. Please feel free to submit issues and pull requests through the\nproject's GitHub repository.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you experience any issues while setting up or operating the SentinelEye-\nWIDS, please refer to the troubleshooting guide below:\n\n  * If the ESP8266 fails to connect to Wi-Fi, make sure you have entered the correct credentials and that your Wi-Fi network is operational.\n  * In case of failed Pushover notifications, verify your API and User tokens.\n\n## Security Disclaimer\n\nWhile SentinelEye-WIDS is designed to enhance the security of wireless\nnetworks, it does not guarantee complete protection against all types of Wi-Fi\nattacks. Users are encouraged to employ multiple layers of security and to\nkeep all software up-to-date.\n\n## FAQ\n\nQ: Can I use SentinelEye-WIDS with any Wi-Fi network? A: SentinelEye-WIDS is\ncompatible with networks that the ESP8266 supports. For specific network\nrequirements, refer to the ESP8266 documentation.\n\nQ: What kind of attacks can SentinelEye-WIDS detect? A: The system is designed\nto detect deauthentication attacks by monitoring suspicious packet patterns\noften associated with such intrusions.\n\n## Support and New Features\n\nFor support queries or to suggest new features, please file an issue on the\nGitHub repository, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\n## Contact Information\n\nFor assistance or to provide feedback, reach out to us at amssarath@gmail.com.\n\n### Versioning\n\nWe use SemVer for versioning.
