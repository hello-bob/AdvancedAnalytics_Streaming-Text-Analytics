Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef is\nteetering on the brink, suffering one of the most severe coral bleaching\nevents on record -- the fifth in eight years -- and leaving scientists unsure\nabout its survival.DAVID GRAY / AFP via Getty Images\n\nAfter a year of ocean heat waves and unprecedented temperatures off the coast\nof Florida that alarmed conservationists last summer, the world is currently\nexperiencing a \u201cglobal coral reef bleaching event,\u201d the fourth ever recorded\nand the second in the past decade, according to climate scientists at the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nCoral reef bleaching occurs as warming temperatures stress the tiny organisms\nthat form the foundation of complex reef ecosystems, and without relief from\ncooler waters, bright and colorful reefs turn a ghostly white. Bleaching\nincreases the risk that reefs suffer disease, starvation and death.\n\nIf current trends continue, the world will soon witness the most severe global\nbleaching event ever recorded, according to Derek Manzello, an ecologist and\ncoordinator of NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program.\n\nBleaching occurs when stress from heat breaks down the symbiotic relationship\nthat transfers nutrients from algae to coral. Over the past year, about 54\npercent of the global ocean area that is home to coral reefs experienced heat\nstress at levels that cause bleaching, according to NOAA\u2019s Global Bleaching\nEvent Index. The index peaked at 56 percent between 2014 and 2017.\n\n\u201cThat 54 percent number has been going up by about 1 percent per week now for\na few months, so it\u2019s likely that the record will be broken here in a few\nweeks,\u201d Manzello said in an interview. \u201cThe forecast is that El Ni\u00f1o is coming\nto an end and will switch to La Ni\u00f1a, and once that happens, that number will\nstart coming down.\u201d\n\n### Related Story\n\nOp-Ed\n\n|\n\nEnvironment & Health\n\n## El Ni\u00f1o Is About to Accelerate the Global Climate Crisis. It\u2019s Time for\nAction.\n\nThe extreme heat of the upcoming El Ni\u00f1o years should compel us to subordinate\nprofit motives to urgent climate goals.\n\nBy\n\n    Gareth Dale ,\n    Truthout\n\nJune 23, 2023\n\nTruthout\n\nGlobal ocean warming has increased steadily since the 1970s. Since early 2023,\nscientists have confirmed the mass bleaching of coral reefs throughout the\ntropics, including coastal areas of Florida and Brazil; the eastern Tropical\nPacific stretching from Mexico down to Colombia; Australia\u2019s famous Great\nBarrier Reef; large swaths of the South Pacific islands; the Persian Gulf, Red\nSea, and beyond, according to NOAA\u2019s satellite monitoring system of surface\nwater temperature.\n\nFew areas of the world remain untouched. NOAA received confirmation from\npartner scientists of bleaching across shallower areas of the Indian Ocean\nranging from the eastern coast of Kenya to the western coast of Indonesia.\nHowever, bleaching is more scattered in these areas compared to the tropical\nAtlantic Ocean, where 95 percent of reefed areas experienced bleaching-level\nheat over the past year. That was a \u201cbig surprise,\u201d Manzello said.\n\n> While coral reefs only cover about 0.2 percent of the sea floor, the\n> habitats are so diverse that they support 25 percent of marine species.\n\n\u201cJust in terms of the sheer magnitude of the heat in the Atlantic is very\nshocking, and the other thing is, a lot of places like Florida and Bahamas, it\nstarted five to six weeks earlier than, you know, the \u2018normal\u2019 sort of\nbleaching season,\u201d Manzello said, adding that bleaching events are now more\nsevere and frequent than in the 1980s.\n\nAbout 90 percent of global warming is occurring in the world\u2019s oceans, which\ncover 70 percent of the planet\u2019s surface. Coral reefs around the world now\nserve as a gauge of climate disruption. While coral reefs only cover about 0.2\npercent of the sea floor, the habitats are so diverse that they support 25\npercent of marine species, according to the Global Coral Reef Monitoring\nNetwork.\n\nAlong with a multitude of marine wildlife, coral bleaching on a global scale\nalso threatens local economies that depend on reefs for food security and\ntourism dollars, for example, and the total economic value of the world\u2019s\nreefs is estimated to be $2.7 trillion per year. Manzello said bleaching\nevents have become more extensive, frequent and severe since the 1980s.\n\n\u201cWhen these events are sufficiently severe or prolonged, they can cause coral\nmortality, which hurts the people who depend on the coral reefs for their\nlivelihoods,\u201d Manzello said.\n\nThere are multiple factors behind the \u201cmarine heat waves\u201d scientists are\ntracking in the world\u2019s oceans, but scientists say climate change and warmer\nwaters brought by El Ni\u00f1o in the Pacific were major drivers of heat waves over\nthe past year. Marine heat waves can last for months, even years.\n\nWhile the current global bleaching event may have occurred without the burning\nof fossil fuels by humans, the baseline temperature of the world\u2019s oceans is\nhigher due to climate change, making bleaching more severe and widespread. As\nof February 2024, up to 38 percent of the global ocean was experiencing a\nmarine heat wave, including along the U.S west coast and much of the tropical\nEastern Atlantic and Caribbean, according to NOAA.\n\n> As of February 2024, up to 38 percent of the global ocean was experiencing a\n> marine heat wave.\n\n\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be possible without climate change and El Ni\u00f1o beyond that,\u201d\nManzello said.\n\nWaters off the coast of Florida reached unprecedented temperatures over the\npast year, threatening both beloved reefs and the beach-focused tourism\neconomy. The heat wave started earlier, lasted longer and was more severe than\nany prior heat wave recorded in the region, Manzello said.\n\nThe heat wave brought national attention to Florida\u2019s iconic coral reefs and\nsent conservationists scrambling to mitigate the damage, including by\nphysically moving reefs to deeper, cooler waters and constructing \u201csunshades\u201d\nover the surface of the ocean. NOAA scientists said the effort brought better\nscientific understanding of the problem, but global action is needed to save\nthe world\u2019s reefs.\n\nBritta Schaffelke, the manager of international partnerships at the Australian\nInstitute for Marine Science, said more long-term data on the health of coral\nreefs is needed to put the global bleaching event in context for\nconservationists exploring potential human interventions.\n\n\u201c[The data] allow us to quantify coral mortality, track recovery, and identify\nareas that don\u2019t recover naturally and may need further protection or a\nhelping hand through innovative interventions,\u201d Schaffelke said in a statement\non Monday.\n\nPepe Clarke, the oceans practice leader at the World Wildlife Foundation, said\nhumans must urgently stop burning fossil fuels or we will lose coral reefs,\nwith devastating consequences for coastal communities worldwide.\n\n\u201cIf we need a specific, visual, contemporary case of what\u2019s at stake with\nevery fraction of a degree warming, this is it,\u201d Pepe said in a statement.\n\u201cThe scale and severity of the mass coral bleaching is clear evidence of the\nharm climate change is having right now.\u201d\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
