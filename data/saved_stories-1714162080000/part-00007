Here, he picks his 12\nfavourites from his Sacred Modernity book.\n\nWith 139 photographs of 100 churches, McGregor Smith created the book to\nshowcase the sculptural and unique forms of some of the churches built in the\npost-war period in countries including Italy, Germany, Austria, Poland and the\nUK.\n\nPublished by Hatje Cantz with essays by writers Jonathan Meades and Ivica\nBrnic, Sacred Modernity: The Holy Embrace of Modernist Architecture aims to\nbring attention to the unconventional buildings.\n\nChiesa di Santa Maria Immacolata in Italy (above) and L'\u00e9glise Saint-Nicolas\nin Switzerland (top) are some of the brutalist churches in Sacred Modernity\n\n\"Many are surprised to discover the thought-provoking nature of brutalist\narchitecture and are drawn to its challenging and unconventional qualities,\"\nMcGregor Smith told Dezeen.\n\n\"In essence, the experience of encountering brutalist churches often involves\na transformation from scepticism to appreciation, as individuals are\nconfronted with the unique beauty and architectural innovation that these\nstructures represent.\"\n\nMcGregor Smith recalled that his work on the book began when he visited the\nbrutalist Wotruba Church in Vienna, which sparked his interest in modernist\nchurch architecture. Since then, he has been driven to discover more churches\nlike it.\n\nThe Wotruba Church in Austria sparked Jamie McGregor Smith's interest in\nmodernist church architecture\n\n\"One of the driving forces behind my project was the realisation that many of\nthese remarkable spaces were not fully appreciated within the architectural\ncommunity and often remained unknown to their local populations,\" said\nMcGregor Smith.\n\n\"I felt a sense of excitement and purpose in rediscovering these hidden gems\nthat so freely express creativity,\" he continued. \"These architectural marvels\nevoke within me a profound sense of awe and curiosity, thanks to the\narchitects' masterful use of form and light.\"\n\n# Read:\n\n## Brutalist Italy book showcases \"sometimes surprising\" concrete architecture\n\nThe churches in Sacred Modernity have sculptural concrete forms that break\naway from the mould of conventional churches, which typically have a floor\nplan in the shape of a cross.\n\nMcGregor Smith claimed this was part of a trend after the second world war,\nwhich sought new styles separated from traditional architecture of the past.\n\n\"While traditional churches evoke a sense of familiarity and reverence through\ntheir classic designs, brutalist and modernist churches challenge these norms\nwith their bold, austere and provocative aesthetic,\" he said.\n\n\"These architectural styles emerged in the post-war period as a rejection of\nthe past's orthodoxy and a pursuit of a new social order free from\nassociations with opulence, authority and war.\"\n\nMany of the churches have unconventional shapes, like St Matthew's Church in\nthe UK\n\n\"In response to the reformed liturgy following the Second Vatican Council,\nchurch commissioners were granted unprecedented freedom to depart from\ntraditional church typology,\" McGregor Smith continued.\n\n\"They eschewed nostalgic replication, resulting in spaces that excluded\nfunctional areas and symbols prevalent since medieval times, retaining only\nthe essential elements of the altar, cross, and font.\"\n\nHe explained that while early modernist churches adopted familiar rectangular\nor cross shapes, they quickly evolved to incorporate different geometries such\nas squares, circles and octagons. Many relocated the positions of altars,\nwhich would usually be situated at the top of the cross-shaped church, to the\ncentre of the building.\n\nMcGregor Smith also described that modernist and brutalist churches exhibited\na move away from traditional forms of religious symbolism in decorative\nelements, and instead used the material and shape of the building to recall\nthe same feelings.\n\nTempio Mariano di Monte Grisa in Italy features creative geometries made from\nconcrete\n\n\"Traditional mediums of painting, craft, and sculpture, which once adorned\nmedieval and baroque churches to elevate divine power and beauty, gave way to\nweightless abstract forms made possible by steel and reinforced concrete,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"This departure from traditional symbolism shifted creative expression away\nfrom supernatural narratives of heaven and hell, embracing instead earthly\nqualities of materiality,\" McGregor Smith added.\n\n\"Sanctuaries assumed primordial cavern-like forms, reflecting the inherent\nqualities of earth and stone, while industrial and military architectural\ninfluences transformed church interiors into bunker-like shelters.\"\n\nBelow, McGregor Smith highlights 12 of his favourite churches from Sacred\nModernity:\n\nSt Reinold Kirche in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, by Josef Lehmbrock (1957)\n\n\"This small unassuming church has an austere yet majestic beauty that defines\nhow simple design and materials can create subtle elegance.\n\n\"Although narrow, the shuttered windows create depth and volume providing a\ncalming soft light that hints at the vastness of space beyond its walls.\"\n\nSantuario della Beata Vergine della Consolazione in San Marino, Italy, by\nGiovanni Michelucci (1967)\n\n\"Giovanni Michelucci has sculptured a splendidly creative and joyful interior\nthat celebrates simultaneously the organic and supernatural.\n\n\"The form nods to the sanctuary cave and the symbolism of new life represented\nby the egg. The unreachable windows and walkways invite visitors' eyes to\nexplore and contemplate mysteries.\"\n\nSt Mauritius Kirche in Munich, Germany, by Herbert Groethuysen (1967)\n\n\"Germany's post-war churches are often brutal and austere. Their designs\nreflect a rejection of the opulence and pride of the pre-war period and serve\nas a place of sanctuary and reflection.\n\n\"Stripped of their symbology and place in time, they are spaces to forget the\nhorrors of history, war and shame and focus on the hope and light of the\nfuture.\"\n\nSt Paulus Kirche in Neuss-Weckhoven, Germany, by Fritz Schaller, Christian\nSchaller and Stefan Pol\u00f3nyil (1968)\n\n\"Here the concept of incarnation is integrated through the abstraction of\norganic forms and geometry as a sacred message. The omnipresent roof structure\nserves as a conduit, forging a connection between the celestial and physical\nrealms.\n\n\"Working with his father, this was Christian Schaller's first commission after\nqualifying, and I had the pleasure of asking him personally for permission to\ninclude this image as the book cover.\"\n\nOsterkirche in Oberwart, Austria, by Gunther Domenig and Eilfried Huth (1969)\n\n\"Perhaps the most radical church in Austria, the building shows all the signs\nof a culture excited and influenced by the science fiction of the day.\n\n\"It is at once ancient and futuristic, a medieval cavern furnished for the\nspace age. This was an unexpected discovery early in the project \u2013 a\nbeautifully serene sanctuary and a personal favourite.\"\n\nSt Matth\u00e4us Kirche in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, by Gottfried B\u00f6hm (1970)\n\n\"A lesser-known work of Gottfried B\u00f6hm's, this church's cavernous interior\ncascades above you, interspersed with interjections of sculpturing light.\n\n\"Symbols of industrial architecture, such as the rounded ovens, represent the\nRuhr region's manufacturing heritage and of the furnaces that reside at the\nbase of humanity.\"\n\nChiesa di San Nicolao della Flue in Milan, Italy, by Ignazio Gardella (1970)\n\n\"Like the skeleton of a whale or Christ's embodiment, the ribbed ceiling\nappears to hold the weight of the world above you.\n\n\"While the artwork and organ appear teleported from a previous century, the\nbasilica's traditional frame is given a futurist interpretation using novel\nengineering.\"\n\nChiesa di Santa Maria della Visitazione in Rome, Italy, by Saverio Busiri Vici\n(1971)\n\n\"Perched high up amongst the alpine hills, the winding journey through Austria\nand Italy made the visit to this church evermore special.\n\n\"It was built as a memorial church to commemorate the loss of over 2,000 local\npeople and their parish church, who were killed and swept away when a\nlandslide breached the dam in the mountains above the town. The shape of the\nchurch emulates the curve of the damn wall, the flow of water and perhaps a\nstairway to heaven.\"\n\nL'\u00e9glise Saint-Nicolas in Heremence, Switzerland, by Walter Maria F\u00f6rderer\n(1971)\n\n\"Maria F\u00f6rderer's chaotic and abstract expressionism illustrates an ethereal\nreality beyond our earthly experiences.\n\n\"The theological idea of the apathetic is considered here, where divinity\ncannot truly be considered with the known language or ideas of human\nexistence.\"\n\nCathedral Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Bristol, UK, by Ronald Weeks,\nFrederick Jennett and Antoni Poremba (1973)\n\n\"Perhaps the UK's finest example of modernist sacred architecture, Ronald\nWeeks has created an extraordinarily rich atmosphere in the Cathedral Church\nof Saints Peter and Paul, choosing form over liturgical function.\n\n\"Architecture critic Jonathan Meades described the church thus: 'The last of\nthe [UK] mega-churches, Clifton Cathedral seems embarrassed by its function,\nbut the building would rather be the national theatre. Its brute, board-marked\nconcrete and jagged discords come straight off the Southbank.'\"\n\nHeilig-Kreuz-Kirche in Vienna, Austria, by Hannes Lintl (1975)\n\n\"Hannes Lintl adopts an overbearing mix of structural form and light design to\nreflect the power and omnipresence of the divine.\n\n\"This concrete 'bunker' offers visitors sanctuary and security, guiding\nvisitors along a clear path towards spiritual enlightenment.\"\n\nKo\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bwi\u0119tego Dominika in Warsaw, Poland by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Pie\u0144kowski (1994)\n\n\"Too recent to be described as post-war, this Polish church can rather be\nconsidered post-soviet. Church construction during the Russian occupation of\nWarsaw was almost entirely banned, influencing the flourishing of sacred\narchitecture that followed independence.\n\n\"This church reminds one of the vaulted medieval churches of France and\nBritain, yet its geometry and tunnelling light give it a timeless energy.\"\n\nThe photography is by Jamie McGregor Smith.\n\nRead more:\n\n  * Worship\n  * Architecture books\n  * Brutalism\n  * Roundups\n  * Modernism\n  * Architecture\n  * Photography\n  * Books\n  * Churches\n  * Cultural\n  * Highlights\n\n#### Share and comment\n\n## Share:\n\n13 comments\n\n#### More\n\n  * Architecture\n  * Interiors\n  * Design\n  * Technology\n\n#### Recommended stories\n\n  * Thomas Heatherwick's Humanise campaign creates \"boring alter-egos\" of UK landmarks\n\n  * \"Bowing out gracefully is a rare thing in the starchitect firmament\"\n\n  * \"Strong focus on aesthetics\" contributed to collapse of Norway timber bridge\n\n  * Knox Bhavan transforms London villa into \"low-energy forever home\"\n\n  * Kengo Kuma nears completion of swooping extension to Lisbon art centre\n\n  * World's largest museum captured ahead of opening in Egypt\n\n  * Foster + Partners designing Sierra Leone island city for Idris Elba\n\n  * Saudi Arabia lowers predicted number of residents at The Line by 2030\n\n#### Latest from Dezeen Showroom\n\n  * Origata collection by Nao Tamura for Porro\n\n  * Cosmo pavilion by AMDL Circle for Ethimo\n\n  * Future tiles by Kaolin\n\n  * Formation 02 Toilet by Samuel Ross for Kohler\n\n  * Stilo furniture system by Spalvieri & Del Ciotto for Scavolini\n\n  * CombiSteamer V6000 45L Grand oven by V-Zug\n\n  * Hut lounge bed by Marco Lavit for Ethimo\n\n  * Handcraft carpet tiles by Modulyss\n\n#### Comments\n\nVisit our comments page | Read our comments policy\n\n## Top architecture stories\n\n## Most popular\n\n## Most recent\n\n  1. 1IGArchitects slots skinny 2700 house into narrow plot in Japan\n  2. 2Chris Pratt destruction of Ellwood house symptom of \"systemic problems\"\n  3. 3Mole Architects creates Alde Valley Barn within Suffolk farmyard\n  4. 4Sacred Modernity showcases \"unique beauty\" of brutalist churches\n  5. 5Don't Move, Improve!
