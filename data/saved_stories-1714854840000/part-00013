Reduce Hallucination\n\n> WrenAI offers detailed, explainable responses, ensuring users understand the\n> origins and context of their data, thereby reducing hallucinations in LLMs.\n\n### 2\\. Augment Your LLM Knowledge Base\n\n> WrenAI enriches LLMs with your specific business context, with additional\n> metadata for your data schema, such as semantics and relationships.\n\n### 3\\. Self-Learning Feedback Loop\n\n> WrenAI evolves with every interaction. It learns from user feedback and\n> behavioral patterns, continuously refining its suggestions.\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 Benefits using WrenAI\n\nWrenAI leverages Large Language Models (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) technology to enhance comprehension of internal data. Below\nare the three key benefits:\n\n### 1\\. Fast Onboarding\n\n> Discover and analyze your data with our user interface. Effortlessly\n> generate results without needing to code.\n\n### 2\\. Secure By Design\n\n> Your database contents will never be transmitted to the LLM. Only metadata,\n> like schemas, documentation, and queries, will be used in semantic search.\n\n### 3\\. Open-Source\n\n> Deploy WrenAI anywhere you like on your own data, LLM APIs, and environment,\n> it's free.\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 WrenAI's Architecture\n\nWrenAI is consist of three core services:\n\n  * Wren UI: An intuitive user interface for asking questions, defining data relationships, and integrating data sources within WrenAI's framework.\n\n  * Wren AI Service: Processes queries using a vector database for context retrieval, guiding LLMs to produce precise SQL outputs.\n\n  * Wren Engine: Serves as the platform's backbone, managing metadata and connecting to data sources, while preparing for future application integrations.\n\n## \ud83e\udee3 Sneak Peek\n\nData Modeling| Ask and Follow-up Questions  \n---|---  \n  \n## \ud83e\udd1e Design Philosophies\n\nWe have some core design philosophies that were used when developing WrenAI.\n\n  * Explainability: WrenAI ensures that every SQL query generated in natural language is accurate, concise, and reliable.\n  * Interoperability: WrenAI enables users to query data from multiple sources without dealing with the complexities of different data formats and dialects, providing a standard interface across different sources.\n  * Interactive Experience: WrenAI is designed to engage users in a dialogue, clarifying their queries and refining results in real time.\n  * Continuous Learning: WrenAI will proactively learn through ongoing query history, feedback, and interactions. Incorporating new patterns, information, and data structures into our LLM knowledge base.\n\n## \ud83d\udea7 Project Status\n\nWrenAI is currently in alpha version. The project team is actively working on\nprogress and aiming to release new versions at least biweekly.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Getting Started\n\nUsing WrenAI is super simple, you can setup within 3 minutes, and start to\ninteract with your own data!\n\nStart Today And Be 100X More Productive Than Yesterday\n\n  * Visit our Installation Guide of WrenAI.\n  * Visit the Usage Guides to learn more about how to use WrenAI.\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Documentation\n\nVisit WrenAI documentation to view the full documentation.\n\n## \ud83d\udcf6 Telemetry\n\nWrenAI collects anonymous usage statistics for application components. We\nreceive an event each time these components are initialized or used, allowing\nus to identify which features are most relevant and valued by our community.\nThese statistics help us improve our features and serve as a reference for\ndeciding on our roadmap.\n\nRead more about telemetry or how you can opt out in WrenAI doc.\n\n## \u2b50\ufe0f Community\n\n  * Welcome to our Discord server to give us feedback!\n  * If there is any issues, please visit GitHub Issues.\n\nDo note that our Code of Conduct applies to all WrenAI community channels.\nUsers are highly encouraged to read and adhere to them to avoid repercussions.\n\n## About\n\nWrenAI makes your database RAG-ready.
