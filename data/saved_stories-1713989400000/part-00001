This project took nine months to execute and includes prices from 46\nU.S. states.\n\nThe Appeal also published an accompanying feature exploring the exploitative\nand inconsistent pricing systems of prison commissaries, including maps and\nvisualizations that illustrate how prices differ across the country. It also\nhighlighted extreme examples of markups and costs compared to community\nprices.\n\n## What\u2019s in the Database\n\nThe database is broken up into three searchable sections:\n\n  1. Commissary Lists: This tab includes links to 46 states\u2019 commissary lists. Some states have one centralized list while others have different commissary lists for each prison and some have different lists for particular types of housing units.\n  2. Summary Data: This tab summarizes, by state, the cost of basic food, hygiene, and other items selected by The Appeal. When the price of an item varied depending on the prison or housing unit, a range is included to show the lowest and highest prices the item was sold for in the state.\n  3. Detailed Price Information: This tab includes all of the prices The Appeal analyzed in its reporting. The database contains price data for 24 different food, hygiene, and religious products, broken down by prison and, when possible, housing unit. This section allows readers to see the availability and prices of items at individual facilities, and the variation within a state. The Appeal will continue updating this section with more products into the future.\n\n## How We Obtained the Commissary Lists\n\nBeginning in July 2023, The Appeal requested copies of prison commissary price\nlists and vendor contracts from all state prison systems. In total, 46 state\nprison systems provided The Appeal with commissary lists. These records do not\nnecessarily include commissary prices for privately operated prisons in these\nstates.\n\nThese requests produced more than 10,000 pages of records, including the\ncommissary lists published in the database. Many prisons regularly update\ncommissary inventories and prices, so the prices and products in the database\nmay not be identical to those currently offered in a facility.\n\n## How We Chose Which Items to Include\n\nThe inconsistency of commissary offerings makes it difficult to compare\nspecific products across states. Each state may choose to carry a different\nsize or brand of toothpaste, for example, which could affect the price.\nAdditionally, some states do not have a centralized commissary list, meaning\neach prison within the state may offer different prices for products.\n\nTo refine the scope of the project, The Appeal selected products from three\ncategories\u2014food, personal care/hygiene, and religious items\u2014and chose\ncomparable items that were available in many different prisons.\n\n## How We Compared Prices Across States\n\nTo create the fairest price comparison across prisons, The Appeal conducted\ntwo key analyses.\n\nFor each product (e.g toothpaste) we first chose the lowest price offered at\nany commissary in each state, even if it wasn\u2019t available at all facilities in\nthe state. We did not include prices for incarcerated people considered\nindigent because each state has different criteria and policies related to\nindigency.\n\nHowever, the cheapest option isn\u2019t always the best. Many states sell single\nservings of goods like toothpaste or deodorant at lower prices, but they often\ncost more in the long run than larger packages. Additionally, prices are often\nlow precisely because they are less desirable versions of a product than more\nexpensive brand-name alternatives.\n\nTo address this, The Appeal compared a widely available brand of each product\n(e.g. Colgate toothpaste instead of \u201ctoothpaste red gel\u201d) in order to\ncontextualize how prices for incarcerated people compare to what readers might\npay in the community.\n\nTo analyze soap prices in each state, for instance, we examined the product\nwith the lowest price, as well as a brand-name offering, like Ivory or Dove.\n\nThis process was difficult even for popular items like ramen. Prices often\ndiffered depending on the flavor, the individual prison unit, or the facility.\nNot all states sell the same brand of ramen and some don\u2019t specify what brand\nthey sell. Ultimately, The Appeal chose to compare the lowest price for a\nsingle packet of ramen and to specify the brand and flavor when known.\n\n## Why Some States are Missing\n\nFour states are not included in the database. The Appeal filed public records\nrequests for Louisiana and New York\u2019s commissary lists in July 2023 and has\nstill not received them. Tennessee and Alabama will only fill public records\nrequests submitted by residents of those states.\n\nWith each request, The Appeal asked for a waiver of all associated fees, as\nthe information was related to a newsgathering purpose. Of the 46 states that\nprovided documents, only the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC)\nrequired payment.\n\nSenior Reporter Elizabeth Weill-Greenberg filed a public records request with\nMDOC for medical, healthcare, and commissary contracts, as well as commissary\nlists. Despite her request for notification if they required payment, the MDOC\nsent invoices amounting to nearly $500 to fulfill the request\u2014an amount we\ncould not afford to pay\u2014and followed with past due notices when payment wasn\u2019t\nreceived.\n\nMDOC charged Weill-Greenberg about $5 for \u201clabor fees\u201d related to the request\nfor the commissary list and about $486 for redactions of the medical services\ncontract with VitalCore.\n\nSeparately, on August 29, 2023, the state\u2019s commissary vendor, Premier Supply\nLink, LLC, filed a petition in response to The Appeal\u2019s public records\nrequest, claiming in court that the MDOC contract contained confidential\ninformation and that its disclosure would cause the company \u201cirreparable\nharm.\u201d The company\u2019s petition named The Appeal\u2019s reporter in her personal\ncapacity.\n\nAttorney John Sneed of Wise Carter agreed to represent The Appeal\u2019s reporter\npro bono. Facing the prospect of a costly and likely unsuccessful legal\nbattle, The Appeal agreed to withdraw the records request in exchange for\nWeill-Greenberg\u2019s removal from the petition. Weill-Greenberg filed a second\nrecords request for the commissary list only which was provided at no cost.\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the invoices, MDOC wrote in an email\nto The Appeal: \u201cInvoices are our common practice as notification of what the\ncost would be to generate the information requested but you are under no\nobligation to pay IF you do not want to proceed.\u201d\n\n## Future of the Database\n\nThis database was published on April 17, 2024. It will continue to be updated\nas The Appeal receives additional and updated commissary lists.\n\n## Support The Appeal\n\nIf you valued this article, please help us produce more journalism like this\nby making a contribution today.\n\nPunishment Commissary Data Locked In, Priced Out Prison\n\n## More in Punishment\n\n### The Executioner\u2019s Last Meal\n\nLyle C.
