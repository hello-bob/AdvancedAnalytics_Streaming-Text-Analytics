The AG Opinion (C-446/21) has just been published. Please\nrefresh this page for any updates. While we are still analysing the details,\nwe hope the initial reaction below captures the key takeaways:\n\nKatharina Raabe-Stuppnig, lawyer representing Mr Schrems: \"We are very pleased\nby the opinion, even though this result was very much expected.\"\n\nUse of data for advertising must be limited by time, type and source. So far,\nMeta uses all the data it has ever collected for advertising. For example,\nFacebook user data can go back as far as 2004. To prevent such practices, the\nGDPR established the principle of \"data minimisation\" in Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.\nSo far, Meta has simply ignored this and has not foreseen any deletion\nperiods. The application of the 'data minimisation principle' radically\nrestricts the use of personal data for advertising - even if users have\nconsented to ads. It applies regardless of the legal basis used for the\nprocessing, so even a user who consents to personalised advertising cannot\nhave their personal data used indefinitely. While the AG says that the\nnational court would have to decide on the details, factors may be the type of\npersonal data (like age -v- behavioral data), the source (like actively\nprovided data -v- passiv technical tracking) or the context of the collection\n(like on a social network -v- on third pages).\n\nKatharina Raabe-Stuppnig: \"Meta has basically been building a huge data pool\non users for 20 years now, and it is growing every day. EU law, however,\nrequires 'data minimisation'. If the Court follows the opinion, only a small\npart of this pool will be allowed to be used for advertising - even if have\nconsented to ads.\"\n\nLimits on \"scraping\" of personal data - even if \"manifestly made public\". In\nthe context of the highly personal information that Meta collected about Mr\nSchrems (via advertising partners), a discussion arose as to whether the\nsubsequent public criticism of such practices would lead to a \"waiver\" of Mr\nSchrems' right to privacy in respect of the initially unlawful processing. Mr\nSchrems always agreed that he made such information public and it generally\nfalls under Article 9(2)(e) GDPR (\"mainfestly made public\") - while some\nMember States before the CJEU were questioning this element. While this is a\nvery specific situation of a single user, the interpretation of the law is\nrelevant in the broader context of \"web scraping\", where publicly available\ninformation is simply taken and processed for other purposes. Mr Schrems\nargued that the principle of \"purpose limitation\" in Article 5(1) GDPR must be\napplied in parallel here. This is now also argued by the Advocate General.\n\nKatharina Raabe-Stuppnig: \"Just because some information is public, does not\nmean it can be used for any other purposes. If you make a political comment on\nsocial media, it cannot be used for targeting political advertising at you. If\nusers lose all their rights to published information, it would have a huge\nchilling effect on free speech.\"\n\nWhat is this case about? The case concerns a civil procedure between Max\nSchrems, as an individual, and Meta Ireland Platforms Limited (as the operator\nof \"Facebook\") before the Austrian Courts. The case was first fully heard in\nAustria in 2020 and concerns a large number of GDPR violations, including the\nlack of a legal basis for advertising and the like. The Austrian Supreme Court\nhas referred four questions to the CJEU in 2021. However, as another case\n(C-252/21 Bundeskartellamt) partly covered similar questions, the CJEU\n\"paused\" the case between Mr Schrems and Meta until 2024. The original\nquestions 1 and 3 were (indirectly) \"won\" because the CJEU sided with the view\nof Mr Schrems in C-252/21 Bundeskartellamt. The remainder of the case was then\nheard in Luxembourg on 8 February 2024, but limited to two remaining questions\n(original questions 2 and 4) that had not already been decided in C-252/21\nBundeskartellamt. The remaining questions are:\n\n  * Original Question 2: Is Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR (data minimisation) to be interpreted as meaning that all personal data held by a platform such as that in the main proceedings (by way of, in particular, the data subject or third parties on and outside the platform) may be aggregated, analysed and processed for the purposes of targeted advertising without restriction as to time or type of data?\n  * Original Question 4: Is Article 5(1)(b) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article 9(2)(e) thereof, to be interpreted as meaning that a statement made by a person about his or her own sexual orientation for the purposes of a panel discussion permits the processing of other data concerning sexual orientation with a view to aggregating and analysing the data for the purposes of personalised advertising?\n\nData minimisation. The original question 2 concerns Meta's approach of\nclaiming that all personal data is essentially going into a big \"data pool\"\nand can be used for personal advertising indefinitely - without any limitation\n- as this seems to be an obvious violation of the data minimisation principle.\nWhile in some cases there is a clear limit for deletion (e.g. when a legal\nobligation to keep records ends), the issue is more complex when it comes to\nadvertising.\n\nKatharina Raabe-Stuppnig: \"At the moment, the online advertising industry\nsimply stores everything forever. The law is clear that the processing must\nstop after a few days or weeks. For Meta, this would mean that a large part of\nthe information they have collected over the last decade would become taboo\nfor advertising.\"\n\nFurther use of sensitive data. Original question 4 concerns an argument by the\nFirst Instance Court (and partly by Meta) that Mr Schrems mentioned his sexual\norientation at an event in Vienna and may therefore have (implicitly)\nconsented to the processing of any personal data relating to sexual\norientation (and indeed sex life, which is separately protected in Article 9\nGDPR) for advertising that took place years before the public statement. There\nis agreement that these statements were made public. However, Mr Schrems\ndenies that Meta may therefore have processed other - highly personal -\ndetails in the years before. Mr Schrems emphasises that the principle of\n\"purpose limitation\" applies in parallel and that information shared for the\npurpose of critising unlawful processing by Meta cannot (retroactively) allow\nthe use of personal data for a completely different purpose, such as\nadvertising.\n\nKatharina Raabe-Stuppnig: \"This issue is highly relevant for anyone who makes\na public statement. Do you retroactively waive your right to privacy for even\ntotally unrelated information, or can only the statement itself be used for\nthe purpose intended by the speaker? If the Court interprets this as a general\n'waiver' of your rights, it would chill any online speech on Instagram,\nFacebook or Twitter.\"\n\n## Share\n\n## Related articles\n\nSubscribe to noyb newsletter\n\nSubscribe\n\n", "frontpage": true}
