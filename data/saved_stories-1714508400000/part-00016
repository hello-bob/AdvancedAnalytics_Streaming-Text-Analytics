Last Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed legislation that will\nrequire TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app or face a ban in\nthe United States\u2014all over concerns that the Communist Party of China uses the\napp for surveillance. Yet just a few days earlier, Biden had renewed a law\nsynonymous with American surveillance: Section 702.\n\nYou may never have heard of Section 702, but the sweeping, George W. Bush\u2013era\nmandate gives intelligence agencies the authority to track online\ncommunication, such as text messages, emails, and Facebook posts. Legally,\nAmericans aren\u2019t supposed to be surveilled through this law. But from 2020 to\n2021, the FBI misused Section 702 data more than 278,000 times, including to\nsurveil Americans linked to the January 6 riot and Black Lives Matter\nprotests. (The FBI claims it has since reformed its policies.)\n\nThe contradiction between TikTok and Section 702 is maddening, but it points\nto lawmakers\u2019 continued failure to wrestle with the most basic questions of\nhow to protect the American public in the algorithmic age. It\u2019s quite fair to\nworry, as Congress does, that TikTok\u2019s mass collection of personal data can\npose a threat to our data. Yet Meta, X, Google, Amazon, and nearly every other\npopular platform also suck up our personal data. And while the fear around\nforeign meddling that has animated the TikTok ban has largely rested on\nhypotheticals, there is plenty of evidence demonstrating that Facebook, at\nleast, has effectively operated as a kind of \u201chostile foreign power,\u201d as The\nAtlantic\u2019s Adrienne LaFrance put it, with \u201cits single-minded focus on its own\nexpansion; its immunity to any sense of civic obligation; its record of\nfacilitating the undermining of elections; its antipathy toward the free\npress; its rulers\u2019 callousness and hubris; and its indifference to the\nendurance of American democracy.\u201d\n\nRead: The largest autocracy on Earth\n\nCongress has largely twiddled its thumbs as social-media companies have\nengaged in this kind of chicanery\u2014until TikTok. ByteDance is hardly a\ncandidate for sainthood, but who would want to beatify Elon Musk and Mark\nZuckerberg? Abroad, America\u2019s surveillance draws much of the same political\ncondemnation Congress is now levying at China. The privacy advocate Max\nSchrems repeatedly sued Facebook to stop the company from sharing Europeans\u2019\ndata with the U.S., where the information could be searched by intelligence\nagencies. He won multiple times. Last year, European Union regulators fined\nMeta $1.3 billion for transferring Facebook user data to servers in the United\nStates.\n\nCongress\u2019s tech dysfunction extends well beyond this privacy double standard.\nThe growing backlash to platforms such as Facebook and Instagram is not aimed\nat any of the substantial issues around privacy and surveillance, such as the\nubiquitous tracking of our online activity and the widespread use of facial\nrecognition. Instead, they\u2019re defined by an amorphous moral panic.\n\nTake the Kids Online Safety Act, an alarmingly popular bill in Congress that\nwould radically remake internet governance in the United States. Under KOSA,\ncompanies would have a duty to help defend minors from a broad constellation\nof harms, including mental-health impacts, substance use, and types of sexual\ncontent. The bill might actually require companies to gather even more data\nabout everything we see and say, every person with whom we have contact, every\ntime we use our devices. That\u2019s because you can\u2019t systematically defend\nagainst Congress\u2019s laundry list of digital threats without massive\nsurveillance of everything we say and every person we meet on these platforms.\nFor companies such as Signal, the encrypted-messaging app that political\ndissidents rely on around the world, this could mean being forced to operate\nmore like Facebook, WhatsApp, and the other platforms they\u2019ve always sought to\nprovide an alternative to. Or, more likely, it would mean that companies that\nprioritize privacy simply couldn\u2019t do business in the U.S. at all.\n\nPerhaps the biggest protection Americans have against measures such as KOSA is\nhow badly they\u2019re designed. They all rest on proving users\u2019 age, but the truth\nis that there\u2019s simply no way to know whether someone scrolling on their phone\nis a teen or a retiree. States such as Louisiana and Utah have experimented\nwith invasive and discriminatory technologies such as facial recognition and\nfacial-age estimation, despite evidence that the technology is far more error-\nprone when it comes to nonwhite faces, especially Black women\u2019s faces.\n\nBut these misguided bills haven\u2019t completely derailed lawmakers pushing real\nreforms to U.S. mass surveillance. Within days of the House passing the TikTok\nban and Section 702 renewal, it also passed the Fourth Amendment Is Not for\nSale Act, which closes the loophole that lets police pay companies for our\ndata without getting a warrant. Yet the bill now finds itself in limbo in the\nSenate.\n\nRegulating technology doesn\u2019t have to be this hard. Even when the products are\ncomplex, solutions can be shockingly simple, banning harmful business and\npolicing practices as they emerge. But Congress remains unwilling or unable to\ntake on the types of mass surveillance that social-media firms use to make\nbillions, or that intelligence agencies use to grow their ever-expanding pool\nof data. For now, America\u2019s real surveillance threats are coming from inside\nthe house.\n\nAlbert Fox Cahn is the founder and executive director of the Surveillance\nTechnology Oversight Project (S.T.O.P.), and a technology and human-rights\nfellow at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Carr Center.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
