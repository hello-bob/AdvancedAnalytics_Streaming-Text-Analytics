AI, in particular, has shaken the company to its core: it\u2019s made\nbig search changes, realigned the Search, Android, and hardware teams around\nAI, and launched its own Gemini AI model to capitalize on the opportunity.\n\nGoogle execs cut projects and laid off employees to refocus, and yesterday, it\nannounced its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion share buyback alongside\nits Q1 2024 earnings.\n\nInvestors, at least, are eating it up: Google parent company Alphabet has\nfinally officially hit and maintained a $2 trillion market cap for a whole day\nof trading after briefly touching $2 trillion in November 2021. Google is the\nfourth most valuable public company in the world, behind Nvidia ($2.2\ntrillion), Apple ($2.6 trillion), and Microsoft ($3.0 trillion). Amazon is\ncurrently at $1.8 trillion, and Meta is at $1.1 trillion.\n\nAlphabet takes a leap after Google\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings.\n\nGraph: Google\n\nUnlike Meta, whose stock price fell 10 percent after Mark Zuckerberg said it\nwould take years to make money in \u201cmassive\u201d bets on generative AI, Google said\nyesterday that it\u2019s already finding some small ways to sell it \u2014 for example,\nit\u2019s helping advertisers target people with AI in its Performance Max tool and\nthat those advertisers are \u201c63 percent more likely to publish a campaign with\ngood or excellent ad strength.\u201d\n\nThe company also says Discover Financial is rolling out AI tools to nearly\n10,000 call center agents and that Ikea is seeing an increase in one form of\nrevenue from \u201cvalue-based bidding solutions.\u201d And while it\u2019s not yet talking\nabout monetizing AI answers in Google Search, CEO Sundar Pichai said, \u201c...we\nare very confident we can manage the cost of how to serve these queries.\u201d\n\nFor now, Google says it doesn\u2019t want to disrupt search too much: \u201cWe\u2019re being\nmeasured in how we do this, focusing on areas where Gen AI can improve the\nsearch experience while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants,\u201d\nsaid Pichai.\n\nGoogle\u2019s existing businesses seem to be doing just fine, too: the company made\n$23.7 billion in profit on $80.5 billion in revenue, according to the Q1 2024\nearnings report it released yesterday. Not only is that 15 percent more\nrevenue year over year \u2014 it\u2019s 14 percent more profit than it made during the\nholiday quarter when search and ad revenue were both a bit higher.\n\nAnd while Google may have cut a thousand-plus employees to help boost those\nprofits, it seems layoffs may have slowed or paused. We reported last quarter\nthat Google spent $700 million on layoffs in January alone, and yet, the new\nQ1 report shows Google only spent $716 million on \u201cseverance and related\ncharges\u201d across January, February, and March.\n\nQ1 search and advertising revenue were each up 14 percent year over year,\nYouTube ads were up nearly 21 percent, and \u201csubscriptions, platforms, and\ndevices\u201d were up 18 percent year over year \u2014 mostly due to premium YouTube\nsubscriptions, said Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler (so not\nnecessarily Pixel 8 sales).\n\nGoogle said it\u2019s improving its ability to challenge TikTok and Instagram\nReels, too, with Schindler talking about how 50 percent more creators are\nuploading YouTube Shorts shortform videos and how the monetization rate of\nShorts has increased 12 percent over the last quarter alone.\n\nGoogle will host its developer conference, Google I/O, on May 14th.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\n## Sony\u2019s new $2,200 camera vs. an iPhone 14 Pro\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nThe new Sony ZV-E1 is a compact mirrorless full-frame camera that\u2019s dedicated\nto content creators and aimed squarely at vloggers. It\u2019s the new flagship\noffering of Sony\u2019s established ZV line of vlog-centric cameras, taking a\nsimilar 12-megapixel backside-illuminated full-frame sensor as the pro-focused\nFX3 and mixing in the A7R V\u2019s AI autofocus smarts to reduce the friction in\nmaking high-quality video content.
