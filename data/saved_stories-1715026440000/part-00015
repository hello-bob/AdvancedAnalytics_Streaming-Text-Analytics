A few claim to have\nbeen operating continuously for more than 1,000 years.\n\nIt\u2019s astounding to think what these businesses have endured \u2013 dozens of wars,\nemperors, catastrophic earthquakes, tsunamis, depressions, on and on,\nendlessly. And yet they keep selling, generation after generation.\n\nThese ultra-durable businesses are called \u201cshinise,\u201d and studies of them show\nthey tend to share a common characteristic: they hold tons of cash, and no\ndebt. That\u2019s part of how they endure centuries of constant calamities.\n\nI love the quote from author Kent Nerburn that, \u201cDebt defines your future, and\nwhen your future is defined, hope begins to die.\u201d\n\nNot only does hope begin to die, but the number of outcomes you can endure\ndoes, too.\n\nLet\u2019s say this represents volatility over your life. Not just market\nvolatility, but life world and life volatility: recessions, wars, divorces,\nillness, moves, floods, changes of heart, etc.\n\nWith no debt, the number of volatile events you can withstand throughout life\nmight fall within a range that looks like this:\n\nA few extreme events might do you in, but you\u2019re pretty durable.\n\nWith more debt, the range of what you can endure shrinks:\n\nAnd with tons of debt, it tightens even more:\n\nI think this is the most practical way to think about debt: As debt increases,\nyou narrow the range of outcomes you can endure in life.\n\nThat\u2019s so simple. But it\u2019s different from how debt is typically viewed, which\nis a tool to pull forward demand and leverage assets, where the only downside\nis the cost of capital (the interest rate).\n\nTwo things are important when you view debt as a narrowing of endurable\noutcomes.\n\nOne is you start to ponder how common volatility is.\n\nI hope to be around for another 50 years. What are the odds that during those\n50 years I will experience one or more of the following: Wars, recessions,\nterrorist attacks, pandemics, bad political decisions, family emergencies,\nunforeseen health crises, career transitions, wayward children, and other\nmishaps?\n\nOne-hundred percent. The odds are 100%.\n\nWhen you think of it like that, you take debt\u2019s narrowing of survivable\noutcomes seriously.\n\nThe other is you think about the kinds of volatile events that could do you\nin.\n\nFinancial volatility is an obvious one \u2013 you find yourself unable to make your\ndebt payments. But there\u2019s also psychological volatility, where for whatever\nreason you can\u2019t mentally endure your job any longer. There\u2019s family\nvolatility, which can be anything from divorce to caring for a relative.\nThere\u2019s child volatility, which could fill a book. Health volatility,\npolitical volatility, on and on. The world\u2019s a wild place.\n\nI\u2019m not an anti-debt zealot. There\u2019s a time and place, and used responsibly\nit\u2019s a wonderful tool.\n\nBut once you view debt as narrowing what you can endure in a volatile world,\nyou start to see it as a constraint on the asset that matters most: having\noptions and flexibility.\n\nSHARE\n\n  * Copy Link\n\n### Sign up for more Collab Fund content\n\n## More from the blog...\n\n### A Few Short Stories\n\nby Morgan Housel \u2014 Apr 30, 2024\n\nThirty-seven thousand Americans died in car accidents in 1955, six times\ntoday\u2019s rate adjusted for miles driven.\n\n### Lucky vs. Repeatable\n\nby Morgan Housel \u2014 Apr 7, 2024\n\nLuck plays such a big role in the world.\n\n### Smart Words From Smart People\n\nby Morgan Housel \u2014 Mar 24, 2024\n\nA few smart things I\u2019ve read recently...\n\n# Collab Fund\n\nCollaborative is a leading source of capital for big ideas pushing the world\nforward.\n\n## Newsletter\n\nSign up for updates \u2197\n\n## Twitter\n\nFollow @collabfund \u2197\n\n## RSS\n\nSubscribe to the blog \u2197\n\nCollaborative Fund Management LLC, Collaborative Holdings Management LP and\nCollab+Currency Management, LLC are distinct investment advisory entities, are\nnot a unitary enterprise and operate independently of one another.
