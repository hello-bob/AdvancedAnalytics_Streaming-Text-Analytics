See\nour ethics statement.\n\nAnother dark day for Peloton.\n\nIllustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n\nPeloton\u2019s CEO Barry McCarthy is stepping down after announcing yet another\nround of layoffs, this time affecting about 15 percent of its remaining\nworkforce, or roughly 400 global team members. It\u2019s the fifth round of layoffs\nto hit the pandemic darling and comes after McCarthy said on its Q1 2023\nearnings call that the company was done with layoffs and that the \u201cship was\nturning.\u201d\n\n\u201cHard as the decision has been to make additional headcount cuts, Peloton\nsimply had no other way to bring its spending in line with its revenue,\u201d said\nMcCarthy in his outgoing message, noting that it\u2019s a crucial step as the\ncompany seeks to refinance its debt. The layoffs are part of a 12-month\nrestructuring program meant to reduce annual expenses by more than $200\nmillion.\n\nMcCarthy \u2014 the former Spotify and Netflix executive \u2014 is leaving just over two\nyears after he took the helm from founder John Foley. Board members Karen\nBoone and Chris Bruzzo will take on the role of interim co-CEOs until the\ncompany names a replacement.\n\nBack in 2022, Peloton shed 500 jobs in October, 800 in August, 500 in July,\nand around 2,800 employees in February. The company\u2019s workforce now sits at\naround 3,000 employees globally after today\u2019s cuts. That\u2019s a big drop from\nPeloton\u2019s peak of 8,600 employees in 2021.\n\nThe move is the latest chapter in the company\u2019s volatile history. Peloton\nthrived during quarantine and had invested hundreds of millions in its supply\nchain to address pandemic-related shipping delays. However, it failed to\nforesee how demand would shift once the world reopened after the covid-19\nvaccines.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Automatic emergency braking at speeds up to 90mph required under new rule\n\n  2. ## Turns out the Rabbit R1 was just an Android app all along\n\n  3. ## LastPass goes independent over a year after serious breaches\n\n  4. ## Razer made a million dollars selling a mask with RGB, and the FTC is not pleased\n\n  5. ## The drinking fountain button is tragically misunderstood\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from this stream The Peloton story: everything you need to know\n\n  * ### Peloton is bringing workout bikes to over 800 Hyatt hotels.\n\nMay 1, 2024, 1:01 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Peloton\u2019s bumpy ride\n\nApr 9, 2024, 2:00 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Don\u2019t mess with Peloton fans \u2014 GymKit is here to stay.\n\nFeb 15, 2024, 5:55 PM UTC\n\n  * ### Peloton is not getting rid of Apple Watch GymKit support\n\nFeb 13, 2024, 2:28 AM UTC\n\nSee all 33 stories\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
