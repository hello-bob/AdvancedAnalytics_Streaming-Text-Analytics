That was the original term I had in mind for what I\nenvisioned this to be.\n\nThere are a lot of influences that got me to this point. One is that my\nrelationship with social media has always been a shaky one. I cut myself off\nfrom it entirely during some of my core young years (20-23 years old) and\ncurrently am on it with mixed feelings. I do want to interact and keep in\ntouch with people but I struggle to fight against the pervasive patterns a lot\nof these platforms are built with that mess with me.\n\nOn the other hand, I've kept some form of a blog or personal website for\nalmost the last 8 years (currently yakkomajuri.com). Increasingly I became\nmore and more comfortable with this personal space of mine on the web that\nI've published some very deep and vulnerable pieces of writing that I think\nare some of the best \"content\" I've produced.\n\nI've written about many things and experimented with a few different platforms\nfor publishing it, and yet I still feel like my best content lives in silos.\nMost of it isn't easily discoverable and there isn't a great way to\nconsistently put this content in front of people while also allowing it to\nspark non-ephemeral conversations.\n\nIt's a regular occurrence for me to come across someone's personal blog on\nHackerNews, read something cool, and then never come across their website\nagain, even though I actually would be keen to read their new stuff as it came\nout.\n\nBut what options do I have, really? Let's consider them.\n\nI can bookmark their website and check once in a while for new content\n\nDoes anyone manage to reliably do this? It's definitely not scalable and way\ntoo much work.\n\nI can find and follow the author on Twitter X\n\nThat assumes they have a Twitter account (and that you do too) and that they\ncross post all their posts to there. It also assumes you care about pictures\nof their cat and reflections about their day beyond their more meaningful\nlong-form content that goes on their blog.\n\nI can use an RSS reader and follow their feed\n\nNow we're getting closer. This kind of works, but RSS readers have mostly died\nout, and Andrew Chen makes a good point about why on his blog:\n\n\"Interactivity between a writer and their audience is is one of the most\nrewarding aspects of maintaining a blog. RSS was meant to be a different way\nto present content, and doesn\u2019t have identity or interactivity baked in.\"\n\nThere's also the fact that an RSS reader helps the author of the content keep\nan existing audience, but doesn't help them find and grow an audience. They're\nstill reliant on posting their blog on e.g. HackerNews to get someone to\nsubscribe to the RSS feed.\n\nAnd thus we get to where I think something like Recess can come in.\n\nThe idea for Recess is to be a content aggregator where you can keep up and\ninteract with what I'm calling \"siloed content\".\n\nIn simple terms, you could say it's sort of like an interactive RSS reader,\nalthough this is slightly misleading given we don't want the reading to happen\nin Recess, rather we want to foster accessing the content at the origin, thus\nsupporting its author.\n\nNevertheless, the idea is to have a platform where:\n\n  * You can import feeds (content) from anywhere on the internet - could be a blog, personal website, news site, or anything really.\n  * You and others can interact with that content, even if at its source doing so isn't supported.\n  * You can follow feeds so that you keep up with all the content you want to.\n  * You can discover feeds to follow more easily, through discovery tools on the platform or by seeing what your friends follow. Consequently, people creating meaningful content can more easily find an audience.\n  * Content is front and center. Most platforms these days are user-centric, as in you follow users who in turn post content. This creates all sorts of dynamics that can lead to toxicity. Instead, the idea with Recess is that rather than User A posting Content X, Content X is the highlight, and it happens to be a part of Feed A, which may in turn be owned by User A, who might own many feeds. But you don't follow the user - you follow the content (in the form of a feed). I might be the \"owner\" of three feeds: a Twitter-like feed where I post my thoughts, my tech blog, and my fiction blog, and you might only want to subscribe to one.\n  * Anyone can use the platform, irrespective of being technical or not, and irrespective of having a feed themselves or not.\n\nAs it stands, the Beta of Recess is built using RSS feeds - which, many will\ntell you, are dying. However, RSS is not a core component. Ideally importing\ncontent could be done in various ways, and doing so via RSS feeds is actually\nstill the easiest way to do it. Note that even websites without an RSS feed\ncan easily get one generated for them, by using a platform like rss.app.\n\nIn the future, content could be imported using JSONFeed, h-feed, or even just\nsome AI tool that parses HTML content into structured data and puts it\ndirectly into the Recess database. I'm hoping pretty soon to get to a point\nwhere someone just gives us a link to the website itself (rather than some\nfeed), and we abstract away the magic used to import it, so that a non-\ntechnical person never needs to even see something like XML.\n\nThe point is - the idea is to be agnostic in terms of the technology used to\ntransfer data, even though RSS is currently what Recess relies on.\n\nNow, through building Recess I came across a really cool movement called\nIndieWeb. In reading about it, I found that Recess' original idea of\n\"connecting personal websites\" was very much based on the Publish (on your)\nOwn Site, Syndicate Elsewhere (POSSE) concept, even though I didn't know about\nPOSSE at the time. In fact, while POSSE describes the \"push\" side of the\nequation, my original notes had a name I came up with for the \"pull\" side - I\nnoted Recess would be a \"BYOC\" platform, meaning Bring Your Own Content,\nbecause Recess itself is not where it is created or where it lives.\n\nGoing forward, I'd love to explore how Recess can integrate more into the\nIndieWeb movement, and I certainly want to dig into how to potentially\nimplement protocols like Webmentions and IndieAuth, but as of now, I still\nneed to do a lot of reading and become more knowledgeable about these efforts.\n\nFinally, on the social media front, I'm still torn as to how far I want Recess\nto lean into it. I've often thought about \"new models for social media\" and my\noriginal plan for Recess actually had a note saying \"no likes, just comments\"\non it. The idea there was to have a platform that encourages discussion,\nrather than focusing on \"vanity metrics\". However, it seems future me forgot\nabout that idea and built Recess with likes, but if they stay or not is yet to\nbe determined.\n\nNevertheless, Recess has a very cool property as a social media tool. One of\nthe biggest struggles of a new social media platform is that it has very\nlittle content, and content is needed to engage users, but content is also\ncreated by users, so it's a bit of a Catch-22. You need some users to really\nbelieve in the platform and produce content when there's barely anyone to\nconsume it. Recess, on the other hand, is a BYOC platform (lol), which means\nfrom day one, it can have a ton of content available. Now, the interactivity\npart will of course be lacking, but you can come in and immediately have feeds\nto follow, import your own feeds, and have things to do. It's usable and\ninteresting from the moment you join. So that's pretty cool.\n\nAnd I think this concludes this manifesto for now. I must note, as software\ndevelopers commonly do, that the codebase itself is the result of a few weeks\nof effort, and this manifest was written in an hour (although the concepts and\nideas have long been marinating in my brain). What this means is: the platform\nis in its infancy, the code is a mess, and the principles are subject to\nchange. Yet in an effort to break free from the perfectionist mentality that\nleads many of our projects to die without ever seeing the light, I'm putting\nit out there. And it's open source.\n\nSo I hope you like it, and if you do, you can help me make it better too.\n\nThanks,\n\nYakko\n\nShoutout to @hazzadous who I've bounced ideas off of and who contributed some\ncode as well. I squashed all old commits into one before making this public so\nyour commits were lost.
