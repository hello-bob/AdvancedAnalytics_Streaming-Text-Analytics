So, here\u2019s one such question: Where did the idea for the\nIMEI code come from? You likely have seen this beast of a number buried in\nyour phone\u2019s settings, and if you\u2019ve ever upgraded your phone, you\u2019ve probably\nrun into it. So, what\u2019s the deal\u2014and what\u2019s up with your IMEI code? (Is that\nmassive number spying on you?) Today\u2019s Tedium ponders the International Mobile\nEquipment Identity number, a 15-digit code that makes your phone different\nfrom any other phone on the planet. \u2014 Ernie @ Tedium\n\nSponsored By TLDR\n\nWant a byte-sized version of Hacker News?

(bri\nhefele/Flickr)\n\n### Before we dive into IMEI numbers, let\u2019s break down the value of serial\ncodes\n\nSerial numbers represent a record of how products are manufactured, sold, and\ndistributed. They highlight important information to the manufacturer that can\ntell them how their product is being used in the wild.\n\nAn early example of serial codes in use dates to a May 1884 issue of The\nCourier-Journal, where the codes were used to identify missing whiskey barrels\nthat were stolen from a warehouse. Odds are, consumers weren\u2019t going to see\nthose numbers\u2014but the factory likely relied heavily on them.\n\nWhile numbers in a serial order have likely been around since there have been\nnumbers, there is a distinct uptick in the use of serial numbers starting in\nthe early 20th century, based on data from a cursory Newspapers.com search.\nIt\u2019s something helped by the fact that there was one particular product that\nwas not only increasingly common, but extremely complex and easy to steal: the\nautomobile.\n\nAnd yes, theft was a big reason why serial numbers became more common. As\nPopular Science wrote in a 1934 piece on the phenomenon, auto manufacturers\nused them to get ahead of auto-theft gangs of the era:\n\n> Seeking more information on how interstate gangs of auto thieves work their\n> racket, I received new light from C.F. Cline, special agent of the National\n> Auto Theft Bureau. This organization, supported cooperatively by the\n> insurance companies of the country, is a powerful agency in smashing the big\n> mobs whose underground channels move whole fleets of hot cars from state to\n> state. Its undercover operatives, working out of key cities where central\n> offices form clearing houses for telegraphed reports and tips, are\n> ceaselessly active in running down interstate shipments of stolen\n> automobiles. Each agent is a master of the scientific methods of tracing hot\n> cars.\n>\n> \u201cA thief can no longer disguise a stolen automobile so that experts cannot\n> identify it,\u201d Cline told me. \u201cThieves usually file away the number stamped\n> into the cylinder block and stamp a new one with dies. This ruse is useless,\n> for when the original impression is formed. The particles of the metal\n> beneath are pressed into a pattern which never disappears, even though the\n> surface metal is filed away. Ordinarily, a couch of the acetylene torch will\n> restore the original number. If not, the impression will soon respond to\n> secret chemical processes.\u201d\n>\n> Motor manufacturers are now putting secret serial numbers at dozens of\n> places on their cars, hidden in inaccessible spots where discovery by a\n> thief is almost impossible. These secret codes render identification of a\n> stolen car by an expert inevitable, and make scrambling of cars futile.\n\nThese days, serial codes are a key tool both inside the factory and outside of\nit. In some cases, they\u2019re even legally mandated. The U.S. Gun Control Act of\n1968, among other things, requires traceable serial codes on guns, something\nthat has become a key element of forensic ballistics. In some circles, this is\nseen as controversial, as highlighted by a case involving \u201cghost guns\u201d that\nthe Supreme Court is hearing this session.\n\nBut as manufacturing has grown more complex, along with the need to source and\nmanage materials, it was only natural that everything under the sun would get\nsome sort of identifier, with some identifiers more important than others. As\nanyone who has ever used a Microsoft product can attest, the company loves its\nserial codes.\n\nThe Apple iMac Pro, a notable example of a device with a relatively large\nnumber of unused serial numbers. (Apple press photo)\n\nIn some cases, you can even parse the data from serial codes on sight. This\ngets complex at a large scale, admittedly, but examples are out there if you\nknow where to look. For example, it\u2019s well-known that Apple serial codes are\nrelatively easy to understand. This can be used to a clever user\u2019s advantage:\nin the Hackintoshing community, where unauthorized Intel computers are often\nretrofitted with a copy of MacOS to the apparent disinterest of Apple, your\nbest option to make up a serial code is by basing it off a 2017 iMac Pro,\nwhich was a relatively low-volume product that only received one iteration. In\nfact, a developer I interviewed a while back, Sick Codes, developed a\ngenerator for them to take advantage of this fact. Mac serial codes, for many\nyears, weren\u2019t aggressively randomized, making tricks like this possible\u2014but\nalso having positive side effects for people down the chain, like repair shops\nand IT managers.\n\nThis does a great job of highlighting how serial codes can be problematic in\nmany use cases. (May your Social Security number, a serial number that\nsignifies your geographic area of origin and the period in which you got the\ncard, not end up in the wrong hands.)\n\nBut serial codes also have a lot of value in other areas. If you\u2019ve ever\nneeded to get an appliance repaired or a part for your laptop, it\u2019s a great\nway to ensure that the company is supplying parts for your exact model, not\none that kinda looks like it.\n\nThe IMEI fits neatly into this trend, but not entirely in the way you think.\n\n### 1987\n\nThe year the GSM Association was founded. The organization, the world\u2019s\nlargest representing the mobile industry, was actually built at the behest of\na handful of European nations to help encourage careful development and uptake\nof mobile technology. (For the most part, it worked.) Today, it is responsible\nfor administering Type Allocation Codes (TACs), an identifier for mobile\ndevices that makes up more than half of modern IMEI codes. Today, GSMA serves\nas a trade or political lobbying group, and runs Mobile World Congress, one of\nthe largest tech events in the world. (CTIA is the organization\u2019s American\ncounterpart.)\n\nThis boring dumbphone has more numbers than you\u2019d guess. (wtrsnvc/Unsplash)\n\n### The IMEI is the most notable of the many serial numbers the average phone\ngenerates\n\nA cell phone is a device defined by its numbers. First, and most obviously,\nthere is the number people have to dial to call or text you. Then there are\nthe serial numbers that the manufacturer uses, both as an identifier for the\nversion of the device you own, as well as the serial number, if you ever need\nto call up Samsung or OnePlus to get a little support.\n\nThen there are network identifier numbers\u2014the MAC address bestowed upon you by\nyour WiFi network or mobile provider, as well as the IP address you\u2019ve been\ngiven. (Just look in your About screen; you will be impressed by the number of\nnumbers you see.)\n\nDiving even further, you get to more specific digits: First off, the\nIntegrated Circuit Card Identification (ICCID) number, which is an 18 to\n22-digit number intended as an identifier for your SIM card.\n\nNext up, there\u2019s the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), which\nconnects your personal identity to your SIM card. The combination of the ICCID\nand the IMSI basically tells the mobile network, \u201chey, this person paid for a\nplan.\u201d\n\nIf your phone is fairly recent, you may even see a number called an EID. That\nnumber, which stands for \u201ceSIM eUICC identifier,\u201d is a signifier that the\ndevice has eSIM support, a replacement for the physical SIM of yore, which was\nremoved from the iPhone in the U.S. within the last year or so.\n\nAnd now, we dive into the IMEI and its related digits, which the GSMA has\nadministered since 2000. Unlike a SIM card, it represents the identifier for\nthe device, not the consumer. Jason Smith, the senior director for industry\nservices at GSM Association, told me that every device with a 3GPP transceiver\nmust include an IMEI code for regulatory reasons.\n\n\u201cServing as a digital fingerprint for devices, this system brings order to\nwhat would otherwise be an unknowable mass, comprising billions of devices\nworldwide,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201cfingerprint\u201d is used not only to identify the specific phone, but also\nthe type of device it is, where it was issued, and how it\u2019s expected to be\nused. And they aren\u2019t just limited to phones. Internet of Things devices like\ncameras or motion sensors, for example, may also need IMEI codes.\n\nWhile you can change an ICCID number by taking out your SIM and putting it\ninto another device, the IMEI is intended to be tied to the specific device.\n\nAs this censored image highlights, IMEI numbers are located on the back of\nmany cell phone cases. (William Hook/Flickr)\n\nThe IMEI, these days, is a 15-digit number intended specifically to classify\nthe device as unique. The number breaks down like this:\n\n  * Issuing body: The first two digits represent the issuing body, and are based on the country-code location of the manufacturer. If your phone was made in China (as my OnePlus 11 was), it likely has an 86 up front, matching China\u2019s country calling code. If it was built internationally (say, an iPhone or Google Pixel device), it will generally start with a 35, which is unused as a country calling code. And if it was physically built in the Americas, it starts with an 01, also matching its country calling code.\n  * Type Allocation Code: The next six digits in modern phones are treated as specific identifiers for the type of device you\u2019re using, representing the serial code for the device model. Despite the sheer number of gadgets being made each year, Smith says \u201cwe have not seen a massive increase in TAC being allocated.\u201d\n  * Serial code: The next six digits represent the exact device you\u2019re using. As you may have determined by the use of math, each TAC number supports a million IMEI, says Smith. \u201cWe are seeing an increase in the volume of devices being sold, but not an increase in the number of models, meaning that TAC is now being more efficiently used,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe same IoT model typically has more than one TAC as they make several million all the same.\u201d\n  * Check digit: The final digit is essentially used to validate the prior 14 digits with an algorithm. Similar digits exist in other types of identifier codes, such as the Universal Product Code (UPC) and the International Standard Book Number (ISBN). The algorithm that the mobile industry uses, the Luhn algorithm, is also used for social security numbers and credit card numbers.\n\nThese numbers, which are required because of European regulations that date\nback to the 1990s, serve many roles for manufacturers, says Smith.\n\n\u201cThe extensive device attribute data empowers business with improved\noperational metrics and advanced analytics,\u201d he says. \u201cThis, in turn, ensures\nsmoother rollouts of new technologies and upgrades, along with real-time\nadjustments for enhanced capacity planning.\u201d\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, that means better customer support, better supply chain\ntracking, and smarter marketing opportunities. But it also carries public-\nsafety benefits\u2014benefits that come in handy, if, say, your phone gets lost or\nstolen.\n\n### *#06#\n\nThe code you type in to the dialer of most phones if you want to see your IMEI\nnumber. (Here\u2019s a T-Mobile guide explaining how it works.) If your phone is a\ndual-SIM device, it will have two IMEI codes. Pretty cool, huh?\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered what it was like to have your phone stolen, here you\ngo. (Kai Hendry/Flickr)\n\n### Was the IMEI number designed to prevent theft? No, but it admittedly helps\n\nImagine, if you will, it is the early 1990s. The cell phone is a luxury that\ncosts hundreds of dollars and requires a service contract. They are uncommon\nfor the average person to have, and they don\u2019t do that much. But their high\ncost and relatively novel nature makes them a target. That creates a big\nproblem for both the public and the budding industry. Compare the problem to\nsay, car stereos, except odds are you might actually carry the expensive\nelectronic device on your person.\n\nDuring the first days of the cellular phone in the 1980s, news stories\nstrongly focused on theft, in part because these devices were expensive and\npotentially dangerous in the wrong hands.\n\nEarly on, cell phone networks kept their own databases of phones, which they\ncould then use to disable a device that shouldn\u2019t be on the network. One\nmobile phone retailer quoted in a 1987 McClatchy News Service story put the\nissue this way: \u201cProfessional thieves know about this\u2014that a stolen cellular\nphone won\u2019t do them any good. But, amateurs will try it (theft) anyway.\u201d\n\nBut as the mobile phone industry blew up, these early claims of theft\nimpossibility gradually rang hollow as thieves grew more sophisticated. By the\nlate 1990s, a story reminiscent of an episode of The Wire appeared on the\nfront page of The Baltimore Sun with a direct headline that suggested the\nwireless employee quoted above was wrong: \u201cBalto. Criminals want your phone\nnumber.\u201d\n\nThe story implied that cell phones were leading to other forms of crime, such\nas smashed-in car windows, and had become a key element of the criminal\nunderworld. \u201cThe outbreak is fueled by a high-tech $600 million criminal\nindustry that has turned a hot commodity of the \u201990s into a tool of the drug\ntrade,\u201d the piece stated. \u201cStolen phones\u2014quickly reprogrammed with pilfered\nnumbers\u2014are eagerly sought by drug dealers.\u201d\n\n(I checked; David Simon did not write the story.)\n\nOne would presume the IMEI code was developed to fight crime\u2014something implied\nby the first news article I could find discussing the codes for a mainstream\naudience, published in 1999 by the Sydney Morning Herald\u2014but not so, Smith.\n\n\u201cThe primary driver was to uniquely identify a mobile device on the network\nand show regulatory approval in Europe, and it naturally became a method for\noperators to identify devices on their network via the TAC,\u201d Smith explained.\n\u201cFor years, the IMEI number has been used to identify each and every device on\na mobile operator\u2019s network.\u201d\n\nIt was quickly used for this exact reason, however. A 2001 InfoWorld article\ndescribed how the Amsterdam police force had begun using an aggressive texting\nstrategy whenever a cell phone was reported stolen. Every three minutes,\nthey\u2019d send the stolen phone this message: \u201cThis handset was nicked, buying or\nselling is a crime. The police.\u201d\n\n(Great message, must say.)\n\nSmith says this use case, while not the primary intent, became essential over\ntime, giving both mobile networks and police departments tools to minimize the\nimpact of stolen phones on the network.\n\n\u201cThe IMEI can be blocked on a mobile network, which then disables it to work\non that network,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe GSMA has a central register where\noperators can exchange the blocked IMEI.\u201d\n\nThat database is one that mobile providers, recyclers, and retailers can use\nto ensure stolen phones don\u2019t enter the network or get resold.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like when a phone gets sold with an IMEI lock on it? You can\nactually see this in action if you search for \u201cbad IMEI\u201d on eBay. Phones will\nshow up there with their IMEIs disabled from accessing a mobile network, a\nsign that the phones have been lost or stolen, which deeply impacts their\nfunctionality. (Which means, if you want to buy a used phone, ensure it has a\n\u201cclean IMEI.\u201d)\n\nBut as Smith notes, the criminal issues that follow smartphones extend well\nbeyond some guy trying to snatch your phone out of your pocket.\n\n\u201cToday, it is not just phone theft that needs to be tackled, but also\nsubscription fraud, insurance fraud, smuggling and the production of\ncounterfeit phones, which have a negative impact on consumers who risk lower\nquality, safety, security, and environmental health and privacy assurances,\u201d\nhe explained.\n\nIn many ways, a serial code like the IMEI tells a story about how, when, and\nwhere the device was built, how it was used, and what it was meant for. It\ndoesn\u2019t tell the whole story, of course, but it speaks to the ways serial\ncodes quietly shape the way we interact with the world.\n\nA device attached to the mobile network\u2014whether a smartphone, tablet, laptop,\nor security camera\u2014has to have relationships with manufacturers, consumers,\nretailers, mobile networks, and in some cases even the government. It is\nfascinating how many things rely on an IMEI or similar number.\n\nThis one number allows a device to shake hands with the mobile network, allows\nremote patching and updating, tracks aggregated usage patterns to understand\nhow the mobile network is being used, helps uncover fraud in the network, and\nmakes it easy to allow for customer service.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nThis guide from The Intercept could be useful if you ever need to use your\ncell phone in a situation where your freedom is potentially at risk\u2014say, a\nprotest. Their advice? Bring a burner.\n\n(Admittedly, it can be used in more questionable ways, too: Last year, the New\nYork Daily News reported that the NYPD has been pushing arrestees to give up\ntheir IMEI numbers to better track them, raising privacy concerns\u2014and refusal\non the part of arrestees.)\n\nIs this system perfect? No. If you look around online, you will find examples\nof some manufacturers giving thousands of phones the same IMEI number\u2014a big\nno-no.\n\nAnd the phrase IMEI tampering is a thing. In India, for example, it is a\npunishable offense, complete with the possibility of jail time, if you\u2019re\ncaught trying to change the IMEI codes in a smartphone. A couple of months\nago, three Delhi-based men were arrested for just that.\n\n(Regarding fraudulent uses of IMEIs, Smith offered this insight: \u201cThe GSMA\nbelieves multi-stakeholder collaboration is vital to help combat these issues,\nstarting with operators blocking devices with invalid IMEI using the GSMA\u2019s\nglobal TAC list of all legitimate device identity number ranges.\u201d)\n\nUltimately, though, the best part about the IMEI system? For the average\nperson, it works. Best part: You don\u2019t even need to know it by heart, or even\nknow what it is. It\u2019s a fifteen-digit entity that does a huge chunk of the\nwork for you.\n\nNot bad for a serial code.\n\n\\--\n\nFind this one an interesting read?
