Recently, there has been immense\n> speculation about how many people are using large language models (LLMs)\n> like ChatGPT in their academic writing, and to what extent this tool might\n> have an effect on global scientific practices. However, we lack a precise\n> measure of the proportion of academic writing substantially modified or\n> produced by LLMs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic,\n> large-scale analysis across 950,965 papers published between January 2020\n> and February 2024 on the arXiv, bioRxiv, and Nature portfolio journals,\n> using a population-level statistical framework to measure the prevalence of\n> LLM-modified content over time. Our statistical estimation operates on the\n> corpus level and is more robust than inference on individual instances. Our\n> findings reveal a steady increase in LLM usage, with the largest and fastest\n> growth observed in Computer Science papers (up to 17.5%). In comparison,\n> Mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed the least LLM\n> modification (up to 6.3%). Moreover, at an aggregate level, our analysis\n> reveals that higher levels of LLM-modification are associated with papers\n> whose first authors post preprints more frequently, papers in more crowded\n> research areas, and papers of shorter lengths. Our findings suggests that\n> LLMs are being broadly used in scientific writings.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nDigital Libraries (cs.DL); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Social and Information\nNetworks (cs.SI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.01268 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.01268v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.01268arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Weixin Liang [view email] [v1] Mon, 1 Apr 2024 17:45:15 UTC (3,875 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Mapping the Increasing Use of LLMs in\nScientific Papers, by Weixin Liang and 13 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.DL cs.LG cs.SI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
