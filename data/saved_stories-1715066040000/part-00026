This is\ngreat for open-source fans and allows re-using much of the same Chrome OS EC\nsoftware support that already exists. But there is also vendor-specific\ncommands supported by the Framework Laptop EC and thus a dedicated Linux\nkernel driver is now being worked on for handling those vendor/device-specific\nfeatures.\n\nIt's been a delight that the latest Framework Laptops have an open-source\nembedded controller. In addition to the upstream commands supported by the\nChrome OS EC firmware, Framework has also begun implementing some vendor-\nspecific commands to which a Linux kernel driver is now needed for support\nrather than just relying on Google's standard driver.\n\nFramework 13 With AMD Ryzen 7040 Series Makes For A Great Linux Laptop\n\nLinux developer Thomas Wei\u00dfschuh posted a set of patches on Sunday for\nintroducing the \"cros_ec_framework_laptop\" driver as a kernel driver\nspecifically designed for supporting the Framework Laptop EC. The initial\nvendor-specific commands supported by this driver are for battery charging\nthresholds.\n\nFramework Laptop 16 Delivers Great Linux Support & Performance, Excellent\nCustomizability\n\nWith this driver, battery charging thresholds can be configured by the user\nwith the standardized \"charge_control_end_threshold\" sysfs attribute.\n\nThose interested in this new Framework Laptop EC Linux driver can find the\ninitial patches on the kernel mailing list where it's now undergoing review.\n\n12 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nPowerPC 40x Processor Support To Be Dropped From The Linux Kernel\n\nLinux 6.10 To Drop Support For Very Old DEC Alpha Hardware\n\nLinux 6.10 To Support Sound On ASUS ROG 2024 Laptops, Lenovo ThinkPad 13X\n\nSynaptics Releases DisplayLink 6.0 USB Graphics Driver Package For Linux\n\nASUS ROG RAIKIRI & Lunar Lake Point M Device IDs Sent In For Linux 6.9-rc7\n\nDell Laptop Platform Profile Patches Being Worked On For Linux\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
