Lie\n\nDavid Palumbo\n\nWednesday, April 24th, 2024\n\nI recently had a job which did not go well. Eight weeks in, I was mired in\nsketch revisions and being asked to start over for the fourth time and so I\ndecided to cut my losses and walk. When I shared the experience, most replies\nI received were from folks commiserating that, unfortunately, that\u2019s how it\ngoes sometimes. But one reply was a bit of an outlier in asserting a good\npractice going forward was to produce my sketches with A.I. as this would have\nsaved me dozens of hours on this particular project and to do otherwise is bad\nbusiness.\n\nElsewhere, an artist was recently replaced from some covers when people raised\nconcerns about the work being A.I. As many noted in the following discussions,\nthe artist in question can clearly draw, so why would they do something like\nthis?\n\nTalking about A.I. isn\u2019t something that I particularly enjoy. As one of the\nnames on the infamous Midjourney list and somebody who has made a living\nthrough commercial art for nearly two decades, the subject is very personal to\nme. So it is hard to talk about this topic without getting into emotional\nsoapboxing about the ethics and legality of all of it. I take those things\nvery seriously and I personally feel there shouldn\u2019t be much more to say on\nthe subject. But I can see that others won\u2019t always share these feelings when\nthey can seek their own benefit instead. So I\u2019m going to talk about an issue\nwhich I think it much more practical and pragmatic and perhaps more neutral.\nAnd that is: I think A.I. is a poison to the creative process. I think it\nmakes your work worse and makes you less interesting and less employable. And\nthat\u2019s what I think is worth talking about today.\n\nI\u2019ve spent most of my career working as a freelancer, but I\u2019ve also been an\nart director and a teacher. I\u2019ve had practical experience engaging with other\nfolks\u2019 work in different capacities either trying to hire them or trying to\nhelp them get hired. While quality and consistency are extremely important in\nmaking an illustrator hirable, having a distinct voice is essential for a\nrobust career. Particularly over the long term. While style-chameleon artists\nwere common in the era of in-house illustration departments at advertising\nfirms, the current landscape rewards artists whose work is memorable and\ncontributes something unique. Every artist that you love does something in\ntheir work that belongs to them. That\u2019s why you know and remember them. That\u2019s\nwhy you can spot their work in a crowd. And that\u2019s why their work has premium\nvalue to a client.\n\nBeyond this, all visual solutions begin with answering the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of\ndelivering the client\u2019s message. Render and surface style tends to take all\nthe credit, but it is the ability to convey message and feeling through design\nand storytelling that elevates an image and builds a meaningful connection\nwith the viewer.\n\nSome people, in defense of generative A.I., will claim that A.I. builds from\ninfluences the same as human beings do. This is, to me, the first indication\nthat I\u2019m talking to somebody who either does not understand how A.I. works,\nhow human creativity works, or most likely both. Something that needs to be\nclearly understood is that A.I. has no intelligence. It does not \u201cthink\u201d. It\nis a predictive text program that simulates human expression by ingesting\nunfathomable amounts of data and trying to replicate that data. It does not\nknow and can not know what meaning its outputs have. Further, it has no desire\nand no emotion to motivate action or decisions. It simply runs a program and\nassembles pixels or words to match what seems most like other correct pixels\nand words in its vast data set. It aggregates. It produces averages.\n\nHumans, obviously, do not create like this. Humans have intentions and purpose\nto what we do. These intentions are sometimes deep, sometimes shallow,\nsometime clear, and sometimes nebulous. But we always have emotion and thought\nconnected to what we make. What we create is guided by intent colliding with\ndiscovery, and these two states feed each other. And the influence that we\ndraw from existing work is not an analysis of pixels, but an emotional\nresponse to how that work makes us feel. Even in analytical study of form or\nanatomy, our brains do not operate like computer programs. While committing\ninformation to memory, we also interpret and seek to understand and this\naffects how that information is later able to be used. Because we are each an\nindividual, infinitely complex being, our different physiological,\nenvironmental, and cultural variations bring us to infinite different\nendpoints. Like it or not, we all see the world slightly differently and our\ncreative expressions reflect this.\n\nIt has become standard to describe A.I. as a tool. I argue that this framing\nis incorrect. It does not aid in the completion of a task. It completes the\ntask for you. A.I. is a service. You cede control and decisions to an A.I. in\nthe way you might to an independent contractor hired to do a job that you do\nnot want to or are unable to do. This is important to how using A.I. in a\ncreative workflow will influence your end result. You are, at best, taking on\na collaborator. And this collaborator happens to be a mindless average\naggregate of data.\n\nTo some, the prospect of collaborating with the sum average of all artists is\napparently an attractive prospect. Maybe you feel you are below average in\nsome areas and the A.I. will therefore raise the quality of those areas. But\nevery percent that you hand over to the A.I. is a percent less of your unique\nvoice, perspective, and intention. And for folks who use A.I. generations\nwholesale, that comes out to a 100% loss of anything personal or unique that\nthey might bring.\n\nI\u2019m going to shoehorn in a short sideroad here. I\u2019ve also been thinking about\nthe disruption business model embraced by tech companies and startups. Maybe\nI\u2019m over my skis in this point, but it seems to me that the cycle generally\ngoes: 1. create a tech substitute for an existing industry. 2. Back this with\nventure capital funding so deep that massive losses can be sustained for years\nand years. 3. Aggressively compete against an existing industry which can not\nafford to operate at a loss for extended periods of time. 4. the existing\nindustry is undercut until it falters or outright fails. 5. The disruptor(s),\nnow having captured the market for the given industry, raise prices and reduce\nservices to achieve profitability. I think about this every time I sit through\na commercial on the Amazon Prime account that I\u2019m already paying to use. Apply\nthis strategy to A.I. and creative professions. These programs are designed to\nundercut working artists with fast, cheap, and \u201cgood enough\u201d until work is\ndevalued to the point that artists are forced out because they can\u2019t make a\nliving. After that, with untold amounts of money lost by the tech companies\ngiving away this service to drive actual artists out of business, the\ncompanies that own these programs will have effectively bought the industry.\nFrom there, they are then in a position to charge whatever they want for their\nshitty product because it has become the most viable option, with all of the\nmoney now going to them. It doesn\u2019t have to go this way, but this is the\nlogical path to profitability.\n\nGiven all of this, I can not personally see anything attractive about using\nthese programs in any capacity. Though they might dramatically speed up or\nreplace parts of a workflow, the short and long term costs are appalling to\nme. It is removing my own hand, the single most valuable asset I possess, from\nthe creation of my work. Even used for prelim work or \u201cinspiration\u201d as I\u2019ve\nheard other folks occasionally say, I see it as contracting out something\ncrucially important to the lowest bidder. The early stages set in motion\neverything that follows. They are what the entire creative work is built\naround. To hire that out to a robot is to value the robot\u2019s decisions above my\nown, existing only to paint-by-numbers a design that I did not create. And I\nbelieve outsourcing segments of the workflow also degrades one\u2019s abilities,\nmaking you more dependent on the service. So if you value your mind, spirit,\nand vision at all as important components to your work, this should be a non-\nstarter. And if you don\u2019t value those things, you might consider another line\nof work altogether, because that is what makes an artist\u2019s career possible.\n\nIf there is a button one can push that spits out images and it is available to\neverybody, why on earth would any creative professional push that button?\nClients don\u2019t need to hire you to push it. They can do that themselves. The\ncentral lie behind these programs is that they are meant for artists. They\u2019re\nnot. We don\u2019t need them and using them only hurts us. What our clients really\nneed from us is what the A.I. button cannot and never will be able to give: a\nhuman expression in all its flawed, beautiful glory.\n\nArt Business, Article, David Palumbo, Uncategorized\n\nPosted by David Palumbo | Wednesday, April 24th, 2024\n\n#### David Palumbo\n\nView Profile | View Posts\n\nAs a freelance illustrator, David Palumbo has provided genre themed artwork\nfor everything from book covers and collectible card games, to advertisements\nand concept design.

The first thing that came to mind while reading this is Michael\nWhelan\u2019s art (He\u2019s one of my favorites and my copy of his art book is\nextremely well worn). His paintings are beautiful and well rendered, but also\nusually contain lots of symbols, some relating to the story, some personal as\nwell as composition and design choices that have different meanings and\nintent. A.I. might be able to cobble together a \u201cpretty\u201d picture but it can\u2019t\nreplicate the artist\u2019s life, understanding, experience and thought process\nthat leads to making certain choices that go into a painting.\n\nReply\n\n  3. Eladio on April 24, 2024 at 8:38 am\n\nThanks for your sensible and articulate thoughts, Mr. Palumbo. As artists\ndealing with these issues on a daily basis, we often feel tempted to simply\nentrench ourselves in moral righteousness in response to an opposing rhetoric\nthat \u2014appropriately enough\u2014 tends to amount to little else than derivative\nmeaninglessness. Actual discussion feels hopeless, but demoralization is after\nall the best game plan for those who, at least at some level, know that what\nthey have is worthless as long as they can\u2019t fully control the baseline for\nworth.\n\nGiven how this technology\u2019s inspiringly promethean promise is entirely based\non the notion that written/spoken language outranks and supersedes any other\nkind of skill or thought process (a notion that a certain career path loves\ndown to an existential level for obvious reasons), it\u2019s not a surprise that\nalmost all arguments mounted in its support are in turn based on self-serving\nsemantics amounting to little else than circular logic, of a particularly\ncheap kind. Are generators tools? Does the tech learn like us? If you define\n\u201ctool\u201d, or \u201clearning\u201d (or \u201cintelligence\u201d) in a vague enough way, of course\nthat can be true; for a depressingly adulterated value of \u201ctruth\u201d.\n\nI suspect every commercial artist has personally encountered the sort of\nmindset that in fact would sincerely call this software a tool: those who also\ntreated artists like tools, convinced that the ability to actually execute an\nidea through visual language is a separate, merely technical/logistical\nprocess that simply serves to realize an intellectually standalone governing\nvision. \u201cGive me 10 color variations, so one of them may be the one I\u2019ll know\nI wanted all along.\u201d They won\u2019t let themselves believe choices like that can\nbe performed with intent and reshaped by interweaving live factors, informed\nby experience and knowledge rather than trial and error; the closest thing to\na creative process they can conceive is browsing through finished options\nuntil something clicks for them, ironically from that undeveloped part of\nthemselves as human beings that they don\u2019t respect or care to understand. That\nIS the target audience of this technology.\n\nReply\n\n  4.

We\u2019ve\nalready seen the terrible results from people doing just this, but it\u2019s still\nbeing floated as the only way to do business going forward, to satisfy spoiled\nclients that have started demanding endless revision rounds on sketches. It\u2019s\na very short jump from here to a client asking why they need the artist at\nall, when they can generate 200 shitty thumbnails on their own.\n\nReply\n\n  5. jo\u00e3o junqueira on April 24, 2024 at 12:57 pm\n\nThank you for your sincerely contribution, it\u2019s so important that people of\nyour caliber participate of this historical proccess.\n\nI think that there is one valid point to add ever in these A.I.s reflections,\nand I know, I know, maybe I\u2019m wrong or my words sound to hard, but in some\nLauren\u2019s article here about the \u201cenvy of non-creatives\u201d we found some paths\nabout this. There is two kind of people looking for artists, those who are\nadmired and those who are jealous. And, please, note, I\u2019m not accusing they,\nI\u2019m really worried about why these people are jealous, how their lives let\nthem in this path to the point of limited expression or can\u2019t expression at\nall. Here we not talk only about art anymore, we talking about how we\u2019re\nbuilding our world and offering people the basics to exist. Developing our\nself expression should be comum good to all beings.\n\nReply\n\n  6. Bruce Brenneise on April 24, 2024 at 4:05 pm\n\nBeautifully put, Dave! I think you nailed the current economics of tech\ndisruption in your side note. One (hopeful) thing to consider is that it\nwasn\u2019t always this way: writing off losses for a significant amount of time to\nundercut one\u2019s rivals used to be viewed as an illegal form of unfair\ncompetition. Although we\u2019ve recently come through forty years where that view\nreceded, we\u2019re now in the midst of a paradigm shift on antitrust and\ncompetition, occurring broadly throughout society and more narrowly within the\ncurrent leadership of the FTC and Justice Department antitrust division. Lina\nKhan in particular has been very receptive to the problem of \u2018AI\u2019 as an\nunfairly sourced and subsidized competitor in the markets. I expect there will\nbe some helpful regulation in this matter, depending on whether she (or others\nof like mind) are allowed to continue their work. Something worth considering\nas national elections loom.\n\nReply\n\n  7. Natalie Heiple on April 24, 2024 at 5:40 pm\n\nExcellently put David <3\n\nReply\n\n  8.
