He was serving time for\nrefusing to join the French army, and he filled his days in part by writing\nletters to his sister, Simone, an accomplished philosopher living in London.\n\nIn a previous letter, Simone had asked Andr\u00e9 to tell her about his work. With\nwar all around, Andr\u00e9 began his reply cautiously, warning his sister that past\na certain point \u201cyou will understand nothing of what follows.\u201d Over the next\n14 pages, he sketched his idea for a \u201cRosetta stone\u201d for mathematics.\nFollowing the example of the famous engraving by that same name \u2014 a trilingual\ntext that made ancient Egyptian writing legible to Western readers through\ntranslation into Ancient Greek \u2014 Weil\u2019s Rosetta stone linked three fields of\nmathematics: number theory, geometry, and, in the middle, the study of finite\nfields.\n\nOther mathematicians had proposed ideas in this direction, but Weil was the\nfirst to spell out an exact vision. His letter presaged the Langlands program,\na major initiative in contemporary mathematical research.\n\n\u201cYou have three worlds that don\u2019t directly communicate with each other, but\nthere are certain features they have in common, and experience shows some\nquestions on one side can be interpreted appropriately in another,\u201d said Brian\nConrad of Stanford University.\n\nThe first element of Weil\u2019s Rosetta stone was number theory, the charismatic\nheart of mathematical inquiry for millennia. The central concern of number\ntheory is the integers, or positive and negative whole numbers, and functions\nthat rely on them. Number theorists try to prove results about things like how\nthe prime numbers are distributed, using tools that can be drawn from all\nmanner of esoteric branches of mathematics. They also study mathematical\nworlds called number fields that generalize some important properties of the\nintegers.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Weil and his sister Simone pictured when he was 16 and she was 13. Both\ngrew up to become influential intellectuals.\n\nARCHIVIO GBB/Alamy\n\nOn the other side of Weil\u2019s Rosetta stone was geometry. He was thinking in\nparticular about shapes such as spheres, doughnuts and multi-holed pretzels.\nThese shapes are the solution sets of certain equations that have two\nvariables, like y^2 = x^3 \u2212 x. Those solutions can be taken to be \u201ccomplex\u201d\nnumbers, which have both a \u201creal\u201d part \u2014 the types of numbers people use in\neveryday life \u2014 and an \u201cimaginary\u201d part, which is a real number multiplied by\nthe square root of \u22121, written as i.\n\nBecause these shapes are the geometric embodiment of solutions to polynomial\nequations, they have a structure that can be exploited using techniques from\ncomplex analysis, a form of calculus. This structure allows for a richer set\nof theorem-proving tools, beyond those immediately available to number\ntheorists.\n\nThis was clear to 19th-century mathematicians, and it motivated them to\nimagine how nice it would be to prove theorems about \u201cRiemann surfaces\u201d \u2014 the\nshapes that Weil was interested in \u2014 that they could in turn translate into\ntheorems in number theory. But many things are nice that aren\u2019t true, and Weil\nacknowledged to his sister that the theory of Riemann surfaces \u201cis too far\nfrom the theory of numbers. One would be totally obstructed if there were not\na bridge between the two.\u201d\n\nThen he came to the main point of his letter: He was building such a bridge.\nHe wrote, \u201cJust as God defeats the devil: this bridge exists.\u201d\n\nRobert Langlands, seen here in an undated photo, would write a letter to Weil\nthat set the course for a generation of mathematical research.\n\nInstitute for Advanced Study Archive\n\nThe bridge that Weil proposed is the study of finite fields \u2014 small number\nsystems that resemble the real numbers in having two smoothly working\noperations like addition and multiplication. They achieve this by taking the\ncircular form found on a clock, with a prime number of hours. Say you had a\nclock with only 11 hours; starting at 10 o\u2019clock and adding two hours, you\u2019d\nend up at 1 o\u2019clock. (The number of hours on the clock has to be prime for\ndivision to work the way it should.)\n\nFinite fields are a place where number theory and geometry begin to blend.\n\nTo see how, take a finite field with two elements: zero and 1. You can write\npolynomials \u2014 functions that combine sums and products of fixed exponents \u2014 in\nthis field. Their coefficients \u2014 the numbers in front of the variables \u2014 have\nto be either zero or 1, as in these two polynomials:\n\nExample A: 0x^3 + 1x^2 + 0x + 1\n\nExample B: 1x^3 + 1x^2 + 1x + 0\n\nThese polynomials can be represented by their coefficients alone, which form a\nstring of zeros and ones. Whole numbers can also be encoded as strings of\nzeros and ones, in what is called binary form, where they are expressed as\nsums of powers of 2. The number 1 is equal to 2^0, 2 is 2^1, 3 is 2^1 + 2^0,\nand so on. In binary, therefore, the first three whole numbers are 00, 01 and\n10.\n\nOver the finite field with two elements, the coefficients and whole numbers of\npolynomials are both encoded as strings of zeros and ones. So the polynomial\nin example A corresponds to the number 5, since its coefficients, 0101, are\nthe number 5 written in binary, and the polynomial in example B corresponds to\nthe number 14, since 1110 is the number 14 written in binary.\n\nJust as God defeats the devil: this bridge exists.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Weil\n\nThey have other similarities too. Some whole numbers are prime, meaning that\ntheir only factors are 1 and themselves, and others are composite, meaning\nthat they are products of multiple prime numbers. This same distinction\nbetween prime and composite applies to polynomials. Some polynomials can be\nfactored as the product of smaller polynomials that themselves cannot be\nfactored. These smaller polynomials, known as irreducible polynomials, are the\nprime numbers of the polynomial world. And it just so happens that the\ncoefficients of irreducible polynomials form binary strings that encode prime\nnumbers. Polynomials are closely related to ideas from geometry, yet over the\nfinite field with two elements, their arithmetic becomes loosely analogous to\nthe arithmetic of whole numbers \u2014 opening up the possibility that in this\nsetting, visual intuition can be applied to questions in number theory.\n\nWriting to his sister, Weil declared that \u201cthe analogy with number fields is\nso strict and obvious that there is neither an argument nor a result in\narithmetic that cannot be translated almost word for word to the function [or\nfinite] field.\u201d He allowed, though, that the distance between Riemann surfaces\nand finite fields is greater. Polynomials can be expressed and factored over\nfinite fields, but importing the full machinery of complex analysis into\nfinite fields was another matter. Yet Weil asserted confidently, \u201cThe distance\nis not so large that a patient study would not teach us the art of passing\nfrom one to the other.\u201d Then he described his grand ambition:\n\n> My work consists in deciphering a trilingual text {[cf. the Rosetta Stone]};\n> of each of the three columns I have only disparate fragments; I have some\n> ideas about each of the three languages: but I know as well there are great\n> differences in meaning from one column to another, for which nothing has\n> prepared me in advance. (Text in brackets and braces added by the\n> translator.)\n\nThat was in 1940. Over the next decade, Weil developed precise methods that\ndeciphered vast expanses of his Rosetta stone. He also made a series of\nconjectures about the relationship between number theory and geometry. The\nmost audacious of these was a finite-field version of the Riemann hypothesis,\none of the most important open questions in mathematics, which pertains to,\namong other things, how prime numbers are distributed. (He proved a one-\ndimensional case of this version.)\n\nPierre Deligne proved what\u2019s arguably the most important of Weil\u2019s conjectures\nabout the relationship between number theory and geometry in 1973.\n\nInstitute for Advanced Study Archive\n\n\u201cWhen you convert intuition into something tangible, that\u2019s when it becomes\nvaluable,\u201d said Edward Frenkel of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Alexander Grothendieck made foundational\ncontributions to the field of algebraic geometry in pursuit of Weil\u2019s\nconjectures. In 1973 Pierre Deligne used Grothendieck\u2019s techniques to prove\nWeil\u2019s finite-field version of the Riemann hypothesis in higher dimensions.\n\nWeil\u2019s Rosetta stone has also guided progress in the Langlands program, a\ngrand project to unify disparate fields of mathematics. The project began in\n1967 when its founder, Robert Langlands, described his idea in a letter to\nWeil, expressing a desire to connect different branches of inquiry within\nnumber theory itself. Later, in the early 1980s, Alexander Beilinson and\nVladimir Drinfeld defined a geometric version of the Langlands program,\nexpanding Langlands\u2019 vision to encompass a connection between number theory\nand geometry.\n\nOver the last few years, some of the most important advances in the Langlands\nprogram have involved translations between the original number-theory vision\nof Robert Langlands and the later geometric version. These translations follow\nthe approaches set out in Weil\u2019s Rosetta stone.\n\nIn 2021 Laurent Fargues and Peter Scholze finalized work on the Fargues-\nFontaine curve, which provided one of the first direct translations between\nthe geometric version of the Langlands program and the number-theory version.\nIn recent months, Frenkel, Pavel Etingof and David Kazhdan have sharpened the\nlink between the two versions. They redefined the geometric Langlands program\nin terms more consistent with Langlands\u2019 initial vision, yielding a more exact\ntranslation between the two.\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### Big Question About Primes Proved in Small Number Systems\n\n  2. ### Robert Langlands, Mathematical Visionary, Wins the Abel Prize\n\n  3. ### New Shape Opens \u2018Wormhole\u2019 Between Numbers and Geometry\n\nFor Frenkel, the impact of Weil\u2019s Rosetta stone encapsulates the way\nmathematics develops. Some new ideas emerge as the logical outgrowth of things\nthat are already known. But others \u2014 and often the most important ones \u2014 are\nwholly original.\n\n\u201cThese ideas seem to come from thin air; they\u2019re not tangible, not easily\ntraceable,\u201d Frenkel said. But Weil\u2019s idea, he notes, was more than a dream.\n\u201cEverybody has a dream,\u201d Frenkel said. \u201cNot only did Weil articulate the dream\nin the letter, he then converted that dream into something concrete.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Quotes from Weil\u2019s letter have been translated from French by\nMartin Krieger.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nBy Kevin Hartnett\n\nContributing Writer\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nalgebrageometryLanglands programmathematicsnumber theorypolynomialsAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Mathematics\n\nsphere packing\n\n### To Pack Spheres Tightly, Mathematicians Throw Them at Random\n\nBy Kelsey Houston-Edwards\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\ntopology\n\n### Mathematicians Marvel at \u2018Crazy\u2019 Cuts Through Four Dimensions\n\nBy Jordana Cepelewicz\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\ngeometry\n\n### Geometers Engineer New Tools to Wrangle Spacecraft Orbits\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
