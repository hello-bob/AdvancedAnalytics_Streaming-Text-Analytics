Catching it with three dissimilar\naircraft flying in formation, one of which is a straight-winged A-10 Warthog,\na plane that isn't known for putting out big vapor with ease, is a once in a\nlifetime shot. This is exactly what Ryan Kelly of Fulldiscaviation.com pulled\noff in Ocean City, Maryland last week.\n\nAnd no, vapor does not signify the aircraft is going supersonic. You can read\nall about vapes and what causes them in this past piece of ours.\n\nRyan gave us the low-down on how he pulled off the killer shot:\n\nI took this photo on rehearsal day of the Ocean City Air Show in Maryland.\nHeavy rain and storms went through the area earlier in the morning, which only\nhelped the already high humidity. There was one particular spot over the water\nthat seemed to be the vape spot that really made them pop. Vapes over\neverything that day! I\u2019ve never seen vapor that heavy on light turns, let\nalone the Heritage Flight.\n\nThe image was taken with a Nikon D500 paired with a Sigma 150-600C.\n\nRyan wasn't the only one who took special notice of the crazy vapor conditions\nalong the beachfront show-line in Ocean City last week. Thunderbird #5, Lead\nSolo pilot Michelle \"Mace\" Curran, who has one of the best Instagram accounts\non the planet, also posted a video of her Block 52 F-16C punching out giant\nvape capes as it rocketed past the shoreline:\n\nWhile the F-22 and F-35 are 'vapor machines' under the right conditions, and\nthe F-16 is no slouch in that department either, the real prize here is the\nA-10. It looks amazing with a big smear of cotton pouring off its blunt wings.\n\nWell done Ryan, well done!\n\nMake sure to check out more of Ryan's work on his website.\n\nContact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com\n\nA-10Air ForcesAttackF-22F-35FightersStealthU.S. Air\nForceA-10AtmosphericAviation PhotographyCAPECone\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
