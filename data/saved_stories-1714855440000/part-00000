Semiconductors are materials that\ncan have their conductivity varied by many orders of magnitude, which makes it\npossible to selectively block and allow the flow of electrons. This property\nmakes it possible to manufacture all sorts of electronic devices, not least of\nwhich is the digital computer.\n\nAs semiconductor technology has advanced over the past several decades, the\ncost and size of electronic computation has steadily fallen, making the PC,\nthe internet, and mobile phones all possible. Today, semiconductors in the\nform of powerful GPUs that can perform enormous numbers of matrix\nmultiplications are the keystone for advancing AI technology. Increasingly\navailable computation to do enormous amounts of search and learning drives\nprogress in things like game-playing AI, computer vision, and large language\nmodels (LLMs).\n\nAs Moore\u2019s Law has marched forward, transistors (an electronic switch which is\nthe fundamental building block of integrated circuits) have gotten smaller and\ncheaper. In 1954, the first transistor radio, the TR-1 had 4 transistors which\ncost $2.50 apiece ($29.03 in 2024 dollars). Today, an AMD Ryzen processor with\n9.9 billion transistors is on sale for $650, or about $0.000000066 per\ntransistor; in other words, since the 1950s the cost of a transistor has\nfallen by about a factor of 300 million.\n\nThe same shrinking and cheapening has happened for every semiconductor\ncomponent. But at the same time, the facilities to manufacture them have\nbecome increasingly expensive. In the late 60s and early 70s, a semiconductor\nfabrication facility (or \u2018fab\u2019) cost on the order of $4 million (~$31 million\nin 2024 dollars). Today, a modern fab can cost $10-$20 billion or more. Intel\nis building a pair of fabs in Arizona which are projected to cost $15 billion\napiece, and Samsung\u2019s fab in Taylor, Texas is projected to cost $25 billion.\n\nThese enormous costs are ultimately due to the same factor that has steadily\ndriven down the cost of semiconductors: Moore\u2019s Law, the observation that the\nnumber of components on an integrated circuit tends to double every two years.\n(There is a Moore\u2019s Second Law, also known as Rock\u2019s Law, which posits that\nthe cost of a semiconductor fab doubles every four years.) The smaller\nsemiconductor components get, the more difficult it is to create the\nconditions to manufacture them.\n\nA modern microchip has features on the order of 50 nanometers in width, or\naround 1/2000th the width of a human hair.1 Materials are placed in layers a\nfew atoms thin. Creating objects this small requires ultra-precise\nmanufacturing equipment, and a production environment that can screen out as\nmany sources of interference as possible; every rogue speck of dust or tiny\nfluctuation in electrical voltage. And these conditions must be maintained not\nin the rarefied conditions of an experimental lab, but in a mass production\nfacility that is producing hundreds of millions of microchips every year. The\ncombination of ultra-precision and high-volume production results in some of\nthe most complex, expensive factories in the world.\n\n####\n\nThe semiconductor fabrication process\n\nTo understand why a modern fab is so expensive, we first need to understand\nthe process for manufacturing semiconductors.\n\nIf we sliced a computer chip down the middle, and looked very, very closely,\nwe would see that it is composed of a series of layers. Here is a cross\nsection of a chip made with Intel\u2019s current manufacturing process:\n\nAnd here\u2019s an illustrated cross section of a generic integrated circuit,\nshowing the different layers:\n\nVia Wikipedia.\n\nAt the bottom of the chip, the area marked FEOL (front end of line) on the\ngraphic above are the semiconductor components themselves: transistors,\ncapacitors, resistors, diodes, and all the other parts created out of silicon\nto make a microchip.2 These individual components will be connected together\nusing microscopic metal wires, the layers in the area marked BEOL (back end of\nline). Because of the enormous number of components in a modern electronic\nchip, this wiring must be routed on separate layers, which are separated by\nelectrical insulators known as dielectrics. Intel\u2019s current process, for\ninstance, consists of 15 layers of metal wiring. This wiring gets connected\ntogether and to the semiconductor components through holes in the layers known\nas \u2018vias.\u2019\n\nChips are made by building up this complex structure one layer at a time.\nStarting with a wafer of extremely pure silicon, layers of material are added,\nportions of the layer are removed, more material is added (or existing\nmaterial is modified), and so on, until the entire structure is complete. This\nfabrication method is known as the planar process, and it was invented at\nFairchild Semiconductor in 1959 by Jean Hoerni. It\u2019s what makes integrated\ncircuits, and modern computer technology, possible.\n\nA simple electronic voltage divider and the fabrication steps to produce it.\nVia Fabrication Engineering at the Micro- and Nanoscale\n\nThe process for building up the structure of a microchip can be broken down\ninto four basic operations, repeatedly applied: layering, patterning, doping,\nand heat-treating.\n\n##### Layering\n\nLayering is used to add an extremely thin layer of material \u2014 as little as a\nnanometer or less, 1/100,000th the thickness of a human hair \u2014 to the surface\nof the wafer. These layers might be insulators (such as layers of silicon\ndioxide used to separate components), conductors (such as layers of copper\nwiring used to connect components) or semiconductors (such as epitaxial thin\nfilms of silicon which form part of the semiconductor components). Depending\non the step in the process and the material being used, different layering\ntechniques might be applied.\n\nDeposition methods have also evolved over time as features have shrunk.\nCurrent common layering methods include thermal oxidation (exposing wafers to\noxygen in a furnace, which creates a thin layer of silicon dioxide on the\nwafer surface), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (where gaseous chemicals are\nbrought together, depositing their reactants on the surface of the wafer) and\nsputtering (where a solid material is bombarded with plasma ions, causing\natoms to break free and be deposited on the wafer\u2019s surface). The small size\nof modern semiconductor components demands that these layering methods are\ncapable of extreme precision; modern atomic layer deposition methods, for\ninstance, are capable of creating a single layer of atoms at a time.\n\n##### Patterning\n\nPatterning is the process of inscribing specific patterns on the wafer,\nselectively removing material as needed to create electronic components. On\nmodern semiconductors this is done using photolithography. A wafer is first\ncoated with a thin layer of light-sensitive material called photoresist.\nBright light of a specific wavelength is shone through a glass or quartz plate\ncalled a mask that has the pattern to be created on the wafer inscribed on it.\nA mask contains the patterns necessary for a single chip, but a wafer will\ncontain hundreds of individual chips. To expose each one, the mask is moved\nback and forth over the surface of the wafer using a stepper or scanner. The\nlight that isn\u2019t blocked by the mask passes through and induces a chemical\nreaction in the photoresist; with positive photoresist, the area exposed to\nlight weakens and becomes soluble; with negative photoresist, the exposed area\nhardens while the rest of the photoresist remains soluble. In either case, the\nwafer will be washed after it\u2019s exposed to light, leaving behind a hardened\nlayer of photoresist in the pattern that needs to be applied.\n\nFrom here, the wafer will be etched: a corrosive chemical will be applied to\nthe wafer, eating away the material exposed by the removed photoresist and\ninscribing the pattern onto the wafer itself. Etching can be \u201cwet\u201d (by\nexposing the wafer to liquid chemicals such as hydrofluoric acid) or \u201cdry\u201d (by\nexposing the wafer to gasses like fluorine which have been energized into a\nplasma). After etching, the remaining photoresist is removed.\n\n##### Doping\n\nDoping is the process of introducing very small amounts of impurities into a\nsemiconductor material to change its electrical conductivity. By doping\nsilicon with a small amount of a group V element, such as phosphorus or\narsenic, an n-type semiconductor with an excess of free electrons is created.\nBy doping it with a small amount of a group III element, such as boron, a\np-type semiconductor with an excess of electron holes is created. With the\nproper arrangement of p-type and n-type silicon, components such as\ntransistors can be created.\n\np and n-type semiconductors in a MOSFET, via MKS.\n\nEarly on, the primary method of introducing impurities in semiconductor\nmanufacturing was diffusion: by heating the wafer up in the presence of a gas,\natoms of the gas would diffuse into the wafer surface. But today doping is\nprimarily done via ion implantation: a beam of ions (atoms with an excess or\ndeficit of electrons, giving them an electrical charge) is fired at the wafer,\ndepositing the atoms below the surface.\n\nIon implantation device, via Xiao 2012.\n\n##### Heating\n\nThe last primary operation in semiconductor manufacturing is heating. There\nare many steps in the process where the wafer is heated or cooled to obtain a\nspecific result. Ion implantation, for instance, results in a damaged silicon\ncrystal structure. This damage is repaired with rapid thermal annealing;\nthermal lamps heat the wafer to over 1,000 degrees in a matter of seconds, and\nthen the wafer is slowly cooled, repairing the crystal structure. Heating is\nalso used during the lithography process to \u201cbake\u201d and harden the liquid\nphotoresist.\n\nVia Xiao 2012.\n\nIn addition to these four basic processes, semiconductor manufacturing\ninvolves many other supporting processes. One key supporting process is\npolishing: because a microchip is built up from dozens of individual layers,\nvariations in layer thickness will propagate over time as more layers are\nadded, causing problems if left unaddressed. To combat this, wafers are\nfrequently polished during the fabrication process using chemical mechanical\npolishing (CMP) to smooth out the wafer surface. CMP is also used to fill\nholes created by etching, by applying a layer of material to the entire wafer\nand then polishing away the material above the hole.\n\nWafer surface with and without CMP, via Chris Mack.\n\nCMP used in the process of filling a trench with silicon dioxide, via\nWikipedia.\n\nAnother key supporting process is cleaning. Because the tiniest stray particle\ncan cause a microchip to malfunction, wafers must be constantly cleaned with\nsolvents and extremely pure water. In a modern fab, a wafer might get cleaned\n200 times or more during the production process. And to ensure that processes\nare working correctly, fabs make extensive use of metrology \u2014 measuring the\nwafer at various points in the process to determine if there have been any\nmanufacturing mistakes or defects.\n\nProcess flow diagram of a semiconductor fab, via Xiao 2012.\n\nBy applying these four basic processes over and over again, along with the\nvarious support processes, the structure of a microchip is slowly built up.\nAnd as more transistors have been crammed onto an integrated circuit, this\nstructure (and the process for creating it) has become increasingly complex.\nEarly integrated circuits could be made with just five to ten different masks\nand dozens of process steps, but a modern leading-edge microchip might require\n80 or more masks and thousands of separate process steps.\n\nProcess flow for a simple nine mask CMOS chip circa the 1980s, via Embedded\nRelated. Today, leading-edge chips require 80 or so masks, and have much more\ncomplex process flows.\n\nOnce the wafer has gone through all these steps and the structure of the\ncircuit is complete, it proceeds to assembly and packaging. This is where the\nwafers are cut apart into individual chips, each chip is connected to wires\n(and to any other chips, as with advanced packaging) and is encased in a\nprotective coating. Packaging might be done at the semiconductor fab, or at\nanother facility entirely.\n\n####\n\nThe difficulty and expense of semiconductor manufacturing\n\nOn its own, a large number of process steps wouldn\u2019t require $20 billion\nmanufacturing facilities. After all, many complex manufactured goods require\nas many or more steps to produce. An early 20th century watch, for instance,\nconsisted of 150 parts that required over 3700 operations to produce.\n\nBut when these process steps are being used to make components whose size is\nmeasured in the billionths of a meter, manufacturing complexity is enormously\nmagnified. With most manufacturing processes, even those using precision\nmethods to produce interchangeable parts, there is a fair degree of tolerance\nin the process. If a part is a fraction of a millimeter too long or too short,\nit will still fit. If the impurity content of a metal is a tiny bit too high,\nthe metal can still be used. If a process runs slightly too fast or too slow,\nthe output is still usable.\n\nIn semiconductor manufacturing, allowable tolerances are whittled away to\nalmost nothing. Making transistors a few nanometers across requires processes\nthat are hundreds of thousands of times more accurate than conventional\nmanufacturing. The tiniest rogue particle can short out a connection and\ndestroy an entire chip. A few atoms in the wrong place can cause a process\nstep to fail. Imperceptibly small amounts of impurities can irreparably damage\nmaterials.\n\nThe history of semiconductor manufacturing is a chronicle of an endless war\nagainst these minute effects and their catastrophic impacts. Even getting\nsemiconductor devices to work at all required paying extremely close attention\nto chemical concentrations and rogue impurities. When semiconductors were\nbeing researched at Bell Labs in the 1940s, mysterious component failures were\neventually traced to researchers who had touched copper door knobs; the tiny\nnumber of copper atoms that migrated from the door to the workers hands was\nenough to ruin their work material. Early semiconductor manufacturers found\nthat their processes were influenced by, among other things, the phase of the\nmoon, whether workers had recently visited the bathroom, and female workers\u2019\nmenstrual cycles.\n\nAnd as semiconductor features have gotten smaller, the problem has only gotten\nmore difficult. As transistors shrank, Intel found that even the most\ninnocuous equipment change \u2014 using a slightly longer pipe or cable, for\ninstance \u2014 could cause process disruptions to new fabs and cause months or\nyears of lower yields. To combat this, Intel instituted a process known as\nCopy EXACTLY! New fabs would be identical to existing fabs to the extent\npossible, right down to the color and brand of the paint on the walls.\n\nA modern semiconductor fab must thus create a world of incredible precision\nand predictability. Every possible effect that might disrupt the manufacturing\nprocess, no matter how small, must be screened off, any subtle deviation\nhunted down and eliminated. And this control must be maintained in a mass\nproduction environment, where hundreds of thousands of wafers and millions of\nindividual chips (each one with billions of transistors) are produced each\nyear.\n\n####\n\nThe structure of a fab\n\nTo create this environment, a modern semiconductor fab typically consists of\nfour levels. The heart of the fab is the cleanroom level; the factory floor\nwhere the fabrication process actually takes place. Below the cleanroom is the\nsub-fab, one or more levels (typically two) that contain the ducts, piping,\nwiring, and equipment needed to support the cleanroom operations. And above\nthe cleanroom level is an interstitial space with fans and filters used for\nrecirculating air into the cleanroom below.\n\nCross section of a fab, via Intel.\n\nThe cleanroom level contains the process tools: the individual pieces of\nequipment that perform the various operations discussed above. Tools range\nfrom lithography machines (such as ASML\u2019s EUV machines), to chemical vapor\ndeposition machines, to ion implanters, to \u201cwet benches\u201d for cleaning and\netching, and so on. These machines are made by a small handful of specialty\nmanufacturers such as ASML, Lam Research, Applied Materials, and Tokyo\nElectron, and are incredibly expensive. Major process machines can cost $5-$10\nmillion, and some can cost upwards of $100 million. ASML\u2019s cutting edge\nphotolithography machines cost nearly $400 million.\n\nThese tools might perform one specific process step (such as furnaces for\nwafer heating) or integrate several individual process steps. Applied\nMaterials, for instance, makes machines which incorporate multiple layering\nand surface preparation steps. To produce a large number of wafers (a modern\nmicroprocessor or \u201clogic\u201d fab might produce 40 to 50,000 wafers a month; a fab\nproducing memory might produce 120,000), a large number of tools are required,\n1,000 or more.\n\nProcess tools will be clustered together by type; this allows the tools to\nshare requirements for things like chemical and gas lines (it\u2019s easier to run\npiping if all the demand for a certain chemical is in one place), and it makes\nit possible to isolate certain contaminants. Since copper impurities can have\ncatastrophic effects on semiconductor behavior, parts of the process that use\ncopper (such as the tools depositing microscopic copper wiring) might be\nisolated from other parts of the fab. HVAC systems will similarly be isolated\nbetween different process zones. To minimize interference from things like\ncolumns or load-bearing walls, the roof of the fab is typically supported by\nlarge, long-spanning trusses which allow the cleanroom space to be as open as\npossible.\n\nProcess tools on a cleanroom floor in a Micron fab, via TaiwanPlus Docs.\n\nIntel fab under construction, showing the large trusses spanning over the\ncleanroom floor, via Intel Newsroom.\n\nThe cleanroom is designed to minimize contamination. Semiconductor fabs are\ntypically built with Class 10 or Class 100 cleanrooms, meaning there can be a\nmaximum of 10 or 100 particles 0.5 microns or larger in each cubic foot of\nair. By comparison, an ordinary house has on the order of 500,000 particles\nper cubic foot of air, and a surgical operating room will have about 100,000.)\nTo achieve this, large air handling units force air down through HEPA or ULPA\nfilters in the cleanroom ceiling. The air is pulled down through the floor\ninto the sub-fab, then recirculated up through the ceiling over and over\nagain.\n\nCross section of a fab, via MKS.\n\nTo prevent particles outside the cleanroom from entering, the cleanroom is\nkept at positive pressure relative to the outside. Keeping the air at the\nlevel of cleanliness required means the air is being changed hundreds of times\nper hour, compared to the 5-10 times per hour in a typical office building.\nThis volume of air flow, combined with the size of semiconductor cleanrooms\n(which might be 500,000-1M square feet or more on large fabs), means that fab\nHVAC systems are enormous.\n\nIn addition to these large HVAC systems, the materials and process tools used\nin the cleanroom need to be specially designed not to emit particles. To\nminimize contamination from people inside the cleanroom, workers don bunny\nsuits in a special gowning area before entering, and go through a special\ncleaning procedure.\n\nAs semiconductor features shrank, cleanroom requirements became more\nstringent. In the 1980s fab cleanrooms were being built to Class 1000\nstandards, but by the 1990s, some manufacturers were building incredibly clean\nClass 1 cleanrooms (just one 0.5 micron particle per cubic foot of air).\nBecause achieving this level of cleanliness is costly, manufacturers have\nadopted a strategy of isolating the wafers from the rest of the cleanroom.\nWafers are transported between process tools in sealed pods called FOUPs\n(front opening unified pods), and the process tool itself is enclosed and\nsealed off. This TSMC fab, for instance, was built with a Class 100 cleanroom,\nbut the wafers themselves are handled inside Class 0.1 \u201cmini-environments.\u201d By\nadopting the mini-environment strategy, fabs have been able remove even more\nimpurities from the air without having to purify the millions of cubic feet of\nair in the cleanroom.\n\nDrawing showing FOUPs with a tool mini-environment.\n\nFOUPs are moved between process tools using an automated material handling\nsystem. In most modern fabs, this consists of a ceiling-mounted rail system\n(though some fabs, particularly older ones, may use floor-based automated\nguided vehicles instead). Specially designed vehicles pick up FOUPs at one\nprocess tool, and drop them off at the next one. The large number of\nmanufacturing steps means that it can take months for a wafer to go through\nthe entire process. This, combined with the large number of wafers a fab\nproduces a month, means that at any given time there are tens of thousands of\nwafers at various points in the production process, traveling back and forth\nbetween tools or being stored waiting for their turn. Over the course of the\nproduction process a wafer will travel many miles back and forth between\ndifferent production tools. Because of this, the rail transport systems must\nbe extensive, with miles of track and hundreds or thousands of transport\nvehicles. And they must be carefully designed to avoid bottlenecks and allow\nthe \u201ctraffic\u201d to flow smoothly.\n\nFOUP AMHS, via Intel.\n\nWhen it arrives at the process tool, the FOUP can be connected to a special\nloading point, and wafers can be handled automatically within the controlled\nenvironment of the machine. After processing, the wafer can be loaded into\nanother FOUP and moved on to the next tool. Since a process tool may not be\navailable immediately, FOUPs are kept in storage until a spot opens up and\nthey can be moved. FOUPs in storage will be occasionally flushed with nitrogen\nto ensure no contaminants reach the wafers inside.3\n\nBut rogue particles aren\u2019t the only thing that can disrupt the manufacturing\nprocess, and every part of the fab, from the cleanroom down to the foundation,\nmust be designed to minimize outside interference. The extreme precision\nrequired means process tools are extremely sensitive to vibration (even loud\nnoises can negatively affect the manufacturing process), and fabs are designed\nto minimize it. Fabs are typically built away from airports, rail lines, busy\nhighways, and any other significant outside source of vibrations, and the fab\nsupporting facilities themselves must also be designed to eliminate\nvibrations. (In one case, unacceptable cleanroom floor vibrations were being\ncaused by an exhaust vent 400 feet away from the fab building.) This extreme\nvibration sensitivity is exacerbated by the enormous amount of potentially\nvibration-generating machinery and equipment in a fab such as motors, pumps,\nHVAC systems, and even fluid flow in pipes. Fabs must limit vibrations to\nseveral orders of magnitude below the threshold of perception, while\nsimultaneously absorbing 100 times the mechanical energy and 50 times the air\nflow as a conventional building.\n\nVibration requirements for different building types. The most sensitive areas\nin modern semiconductor fabs are built to VC-D or E requirements, or even\nhigher. Via Bayat et al 2012.\n\nTo minimize vibrations, the floor of the cleanroom is typically built as a\ndeep concrete waffle slab two to four feet thick, supported by closely spaced\ncolumns to make it as stiff as possible. Above the slab is a raised metal\nflooring which allows pipes and cables to be routed below it, and allows\nprocess tools to be placed on separate supporting pedestals to prevent worker\nfootsteps from causing vibrations. Some extremely sensitive equipment, such as\nlithography tools, might require even more stringent measures like active\nvibration dampers that can sense and cancel out any rogue vibrations. In some\ncases a fab might be built with a structural isolation break to keep the\ncleanroom floor physically separated from the rest of the building and any\nvibrations it might induce.\n\nSemiconductor tool pedestal with active vibration damping, separate from the\nraised cleanroom floor, via TMC\n\nConcept for a structural isolation break in a semiconductor fab, via Bayat et\nal 2012.\n\nPreventing vibration also means, ideally, placing your fab in a seismically\ninactive area. When this isn\u2019t possible (such as in Taiwan or Japan), other\nmeasures might be taken, such as adding earthquake dampers or using special\nfoundations that isolate the building from the surrounding soil.\n\nIn addition to particles and vibrations, there are numerous other sources of\ninterference a fab is designed to eliminate. To prevent light from accidently\nexposing photoresist, lithography areas often use special yellow lights that\nwon\u2019t expose the chemicals. Anti-static materials must be used for things like\nflooring to prevent the buildup of static electricity. Tools are sensitive to\nelectromagnetic interference (even the fields from nearby power lines might\ncause equipment disruption), and tools must be shielded and EMF sources\nminimized. Fabs have backup generators and uninterruptible power supplies in\ncase of power outages, and equipment must be designed to handle the voltage\nvariations in utility electricity supply. (Prior to design standards that\nrequired this, it was apparently common for utility voltage variations to\ncause semiconductor manufacturing issues.) Temperature and humidity in the\ncleanroom must be maintained in a narrow range, which places further burden on\nthe HVAC system. A fab also may be designed to be radiofrequency (RF) shielded\nfor security purposes.\n\nBeneath the carefully controlled conditions of the cleanroom lies the sub-fab:\none or more levels of equipment needed to support the operations of the\ncleanroom. An EUV lithography machine, for instance, is a complex piece of\nequipment the size of a truck, but the cleanroom tool is only a portion of the\ntotal equipment required. Beneath the cleanroom lies the enormous CO2 laser\nthat drives the EUV system, and the pumps required to create the vacuum within\nthe process chamber. Many other process tools, such as ion implanters and\nsputtering machines, also require a vacuum, and a large fab may have thousands\nof vacuum pumps in the sub-fab.\n\nRendering of a process tool with support equipment in the sub-fab below, via\nCrystal5D Technologies.\n\nThe sub-fab is also where many of the chemicals required for process tools are\nstored and routed (although some chemicals, particularly highly toxic ones,\nwill be stored within the process tools to minimize the risk of leaks, while\nothers will be stored outside the fab building). A semiconductor fab uses a\nwide variety of chemicals, ranging from nitrogen (used for purging and\ncleaning FOUPS and process tools), oxygen (used in oxidation furnaces and\nabatement equipment), argon (used in plasma reactions), hydrogen (used in EUV\nmachine cleaning) and others. The volume of chemicals and gasses used, and the\namount of exhaust generated, requires an enormous amount of piping, with some\npipes reaching up to ten feet in diameter. And these chemicals must be\nextremely pure, in some cases 99.9999999% pure.\n\nSemiconductor gasses, via link.\n\nPiping in the sub-fab, via link.\n\nMany of the chemicals used in the fab, such as phosphine and arsine for\ndoping, are highly toxic. Others, such as the silane used in some CVD\nprocesses, are pyrophoric (meaning they ignite spontaneously with air.) One\nchemical, the chlorine trifluoride used for cleaning CVD chambers, is so toxic\nand so prone to spontaneous ignition (it's capable of setting wet sand on\nfire) that some chemists refuse to work with it. These chemicals require\nspecial handling and leak detection systems, backup power systems, and\nspecially designed fire protection systems due to the hazard they represent.\n\nThe sub-fab also contains the exhaust systems for handling the various\nbyproducts generated by the process tools. To prevent byproducts (particularly\nammonia) from reacting with each other, several separate exhaust systems must\nbe used. Many of the processes require abatement equipment (which will burn\noff any harmful byproducts) or scrubbers to remove hazardous material. This\nequipment might be mounted to the process tool itself, or be part of a\ncentralized exhaust system.\n\nIn addition to chemical handling and exhaust equipment, the sub-fab contains\nelectrical boxes, transformers, fans, air handlers, chillers, RF generators,\nheat exchangers, and all the other equipment needed to keep the fab tools\noperating. Sub-fabs are often divided into a \u201cclean\u201d sub-fab (where the air\nfrom the cleanroom recirculates), and a separate \u201cdirty\u201d or utility sub-fab\nbelow that. And while the level of control can be relaxed somewhat in the sub-\nfab (workers don\u2019t need to wear bunny suits in it), variations and potential\ndisruptions must still be minimized. Even slight changes in voltage, pressure,\nor vibration, or the smallest particle emitted by the piping, can negatively\naffect the manufacturing process.\n\nAchieving this means that sub-fab equipment must be manufactured with much\nmore stringent requirements and much tighter tolerances than in conventional\nmanufacturing. Things like pipes, ducts, pumps, and other material handling\nequipment are stainless steel and teflon-coated. The interior of pipes must be\nelectropolished to prevent particles from being emitted or providing places\nfor contaminants to accumulate, and pipes must be joined using special orbital\nwelding methods to prevent leaks or contamination. Often sub-fab equipment and\nmaterial must itself be manufactured in a cleanroom using specialized\nmanufacturing procedures, and transported to the jobsite double-wrapped in\nplastic bags to prevent contamination during transport. All chemical and gas\npiping and handling systems must be designed to deliver a smooth,\nuninterrupted flow of material; even slight variations in pressure can have\n\u201cdisastrous\u201d effects on the production process.\n\nTeflon coating uses in a fab.\n\nOutside of the sub-fab, many other facilities are required to support\ncleanroom operations. Moving heavy process tools into the cleanroom requires\nindustrial elevators that can lift tens of thousands of pounds. A fab uses\nnitrogen and oxygen in such large amounts (a large logic fab might use 50,000\ncubic meters of nitrogen every hour) that fabs will often have air separation\nplants on-site that produce gasses like nitrogen, oxygen and argon. Similarly,\na fab will use very large amounts of ultrapure water for wafer cleaning and\nCMP, along with the regular water for things like chillers for process\ncooling. A large fab can use millions of gallons of ultrapure water a day, as\nmuch as a town of 50,000 people, and producing it requires its own specialized\nplant. As with other aspects of the fab, the requirements for ultrapure water\nhave gotten more stringent as features have shrunk. Other fab support\nequipment includes boilers, chillers, emergency generators, and wastewater\ntreatment.\n\nUltrapure water production process, via MKS.\n\nAll this equipment and processes consume large amounts of energy. A large fab\nmight demand 100 megawatts of energy, or 10% of the capacity of a large\nnuclear reactor. Most of this energy is used by the process tools, the HVAC\nsystem and other heating/cooling systems. The demands for power and water are\nsevere enough that some fabs have been canceled or relocated when local\nutilities can\u2019t guarantee supply. And to ensure the proper conditions are\nmaintained in the fab, tens of thousands of sensors are used for monitoring\nthings like particle levels, pressures, and impurity levels.\n\n####\n\nConstructing a fab\n\nA large fab will have hundreds of thousands of square feet of cleanroom, and\nthe facility might be spread over hundreds of acres. Building it requires tens\nof thousands of tons of structural steel, and hundreds of thousands of yards\nof concrete. Intel boasts that its fabs use twice the concrete as the Burj\nKhalifa, and five times the metal used in the Eiffel Tower.\n\nPutting this material in place at the necessary level of precision requires\nthousands of specially trained construction workers. Intel\u2019s new fab in\nMagdeburg is expected to require over 9,300 workers at its peak, and TSMC\u2019s\nnew fab being built in Arizona is using 12,000. Workers must follow specially-\ndesigned \u201cclean construction\u201d protocols to keep materials clean, minimize\nparticle intrusion and to ensure the cleanroom can operate successfully when\nit's completed. In some cases this has meant things like using equipment to\n\u201ceat\u201d welding smoke, and painting the edges of anything cut on-site with epoxy\npaint to prevent particle emissions. To meet the level of cleanliness and\nprecision required, piping and mechanical equipment might be prefabricated\noff-site and then delivered and installed. To help clarify requirements, SEMI,\na semiconductor industry association, publishes numerous standards and design\nguides on various aspects of facility design and equipment production.\n\nOnce the fab is complete to the point where positive pressure can be\nmaintained in the cleanroom (known as \u201cblow down\u201d), the process tooling can be\ninstalled. Equipment might arrive in many separate pieces and need a long and\ncareful assembly process \u2014 one of ASML\u2019s advanced EUV machines \u201cships in 40\nfreight containers, spread over 20 trucks and three cargo planes.\u201d Tools must\nbe handled carefully: the sensitivity of production tools means that a dropped\nor bumped piece of equipment can result in delays and millions of dollars of\nrepair. And once tooling is installed, it might take six months to a year of\nramp up before the fab is hitting acceptable process yields.\n\nDespite their size and complexity, fabs are built surprisingly quickly, around\ntwo to four years on average. This is not all that different from other large\ncommercial building projects, and far faster than some other tightly\ncontrolled process facilities, like nuclear power plants.\n\nIn the US, however, fabs are built slower than elsewhere in the world. Fab\nconstruction time in the US has increased from just over 650 days on average\nin the 1990s to over 900 days on average in the 2010s, compared to around\n600-700 days in Asian countries, in part because of increasingly stringent\nenvironmental review processes. US fabs are also more expensive to build than\nin other parts of the world, with estimates ranging from 30% more expensive\n(per Intel) to up to four times as expensive (per TSMC).4\n\n####\n\nCost breakdown of a fab\n\nIt's not surprising that building fabs is so expensive: they\u2019re large,\ncomplicated, and have extremely stringent performance requirements. But the\nfab exists to provide the necessary environment for the thousands of process\ntools to function, and it's these tools that are by far the most expensive\npart of building a new fab. Roughly 70-80% of the cost of a new fab will be\nthe process tools that go in it. (One side effect of this is that upgrading an\nexisting fab to use a more advanced process node can cost an appreciable\nfraction of the cost of a totally new fab.)\n\nThe equipment proportion of fab cost has risen over time. DRAM fabs in the\nmid-1980s, for instance, were roughly equally split between facilities and\nequipment cost, but by the late 1990s equipment made up the vast majority of\nthe cost.\n\nConstruction costs vs equipment costs in DRAM fabs, via Art et al 1994.\n\nFor the cost of construction, we see a somewhat similar breakdown as the cost\nof single family homes, with line items for the structure, architectural\nfinishes, sitework and landscaping, and services and mechanical systems. The\nmain difference is that a fab has a much higher fraction of mechanical,\nelectrical and other services. Things like ultrapure water facilities,\nmultiple exhaust systems, and enormous HVAC needs mean that services make up\nclose to 2/3rds of the cost of a new fab, compared to less than 20% of the\ncost in a single family home.\n\nFor the cost of equipment, the largest expense will typically be the\nlithography machines followed by equipment for deposition and cleaning and\netching. The cost of lithography machines is often estimated as 20% of the\ncost of a new fab, which means that lithography tools can cost as much as the\nentire fab facility itself.\n\nAs time has gone on and transistors have shrunk, the cost to build a fab has\nrisen. For modern semiconductor fabs, each new process node increases fab cost\nby about 30%. There are two main drivers of this increase. One is that more\nadvanced process nodes require more expensive equipment. ASML\u2019s EUV\nlithography machines, for instance, are far more expensive than the deep\nultraviolet machines that they replaced. The second main cost driver is that\nas transistors continue to shrink, more masks and process steps are required\nto manufacture them. Connecting transistors together requires more layers of\nmetal wires, and FinFETS (transistors made from \u201cfins\u201d that project up from\nthe wafer\u2019s surface) require more layering steps than the simpler transistors\nthey replaced. (EUV, however, temporarily reversed this trend, as it made it\npossible to do in one mask what previously took two or more, and thus reduced\nthe number of process steps.) More layers and more process steps means more\nequipment: if product A has twice the manufacturing steps as product B, it\nwill require twice as much equipment to produce if the output level is to\nremain constant.\n\nVia Practices of Wafer Fab Operations\n\nBut there are also other cost drivers beyond these two factors. As\nsemiconductor features have gotten smaller, the silicon wafers used to produce\nthem have gotten larger. Chips were produced on 50 mm wafers in the 1970s, but\ntoday\u2019s leading-edge fabs use much larger 300 mm wafers (a transition to 450mm\nwafers was planned but never executed), and larger wafers tend to require more\nexpensive equipment. The switch to 300 mm wafers, for instance, necessitated\nmuch greater use of automated material handling equipment, as the wafers were\ntoo heavy to carry around in FOUPs by hand. These handling systems, in turn,\nrequired larger structures with taller cleanroom ceilings.\n\nThe ever-increasing cost of fabs has created a shift in the structure of the\nsemiconductor industry. When fabs were cheaper to build, any chip producer\ncould afford to have their own fabs. But as fab costs increased, it became\nmore and more burdensome for manufacturers to operate cutting edge\nmanufacturing facilities due to the high costs, and fewer manufacturers had\nthe production volume to spread those costs over. The \u201cefficient scale\u201d of a\n150 mm wafer fab is around 10,000 wafers a month, but for a 300 mm logic wafer\nfab, that jumps to 40,000 wafers. (And memory wafer fabs will be even larger,\nat 120,000 wafers per month. Thus only a very small number of companies\n(currently TSMC, Samsung, and Intel) attempt to operate leading-edge nodes,\nand the industry has shifted to a \u201cfabless\u201d model where companies like Apple\nand Nvidia design their chips but have them manufactured by \u201cfoundries\u201d like\nTSMC. By pooling the orders of many different chip companies, the foundries\ncan achieve the scale necessary to afford cutting edge fabs.\n\n####\n\nConclusion\n\nThe enormous expense of a modern semiconductor fab boils down to the\nintersection of two things. One is that semiconductor fabs are mass production\nfactories, with modern \u201cgigafabs\u201d producing hundreds of millions of chips per\nyear, each chip containing billions of transistors.5 The second is that\nproducing semiconductors requires almost unfathomable levels of precision.\nManipulating huge volumes of matter on the atomic level, repeatedly and\nreliably, 24 hours a day 365 days a year, is an enormously expensive\nundertaking.\n\nFor those interested in reading more about semiconductor manufacturing, a\nreading list of the best books and other sources I found on the topic is\navailable here for paid subscribers.\n\n1\n\nDetermining the size of transistor features is complicated by the fact that\nprocess node descriptions don\u2019t match the actual size of features. TSMC\u2019s\n5-nanometer node, for instance, is just a name and a marketing node, and\ndoesn\u2019t correspond to actual feature size.\n\n2\n\nOn a microprocessor, these components will overwhelmingly consist of\ntransistors, but things like DRAM will make heavy use of semiconductor\ncapacitors.\n\n3\n\nPrior to FOUPs, wafers were often carried in similar containers called SMIFS.\nBecause they were used for smaller wafers, SMIFs were light enough to be\ncarried by an individual person, and required less material handling\nautomation.\n\n4\n\nIt's possible the 4x cost is referring to just the facility, not the\nequipment. This would place US total fab costs at around 60-90% higher.\n\n5\n\nIf we considered things in \u201ccapital cost per component\u201d terms, and considered\ntransistors as individual components, semiconductor fabs are actually probably\namong the cheapest manufacturing facilities.\n\n### Subscribe to Construction Physics\n\nBy Brian Potter \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nEssays about buildings, infrastructure, and industrial technology.\n\n74 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n11 Restacks\n\n74\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to Build a $20 Billion Semiconductor Fab\n\nwww.construction-physics.com\n\n8\n\nShare\n\n8 Comments\n\nScott BakerMay 3Despite these incredible complications and requirements, my\nApple Studio is no faster using CPU/Graphics intensive programs like Sketch-Up\nthan my 2015-manufactured iMac I replaced it with. The new machine uses a\nApple M2 Ultra with 64GB RAM, double the RAM of the old machine, but without\nthe Intel CPU and Nvidea GPU. Maybe these old chipmakers knew something that\nApple does not when it replaced their chips with a combo chip of its own, or\nmaybe Apple sought to cut costs and sacrificed function. The new machine cost\nabout what the old one did, despite 8 years of inflation between them, with\nextra cost because the monitor is not separate if you want 27\", which I did\n(the newer iMacs only come in 24\" models).My major model is a 380MB Sketch-Up\nmodel building, but that was really close to 800MB before Sketch-Up compressed\nthe filesize in their latest desktop version (and last; now they want a yearly\nsubscription for the newer versions). It is noticeably slower to load,\nmanipulate, etc., especially if other things are running. If I had known that\nup front, I would have just replaced the hard drive in the old machine when\nthat died. In contrast, the 2015 iMac was much faster than the 2009 iMac it\nreplaced, which was so slow it became unusable for my model and had to be\nreplaced.Apple, meanwhile, just announced a $100b stock buyback, on top of\nsimilar buybacks last year. It's clear they are not investing the same money\ninto computers as previously, and even the endless iPhone upgrades are just\nevolutionary, not revolutionary.Nothing can accelerate an industry that has\ndecided to stagnate.A video fly-through is here: https://bit.ly/Riverarch,\nwith links to media and investor summary in the comments section We couldn't\nget the land, however, so the concept building will remain just that.Expand\nfull commentLike (5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nTom17 hrs agoReally enjoyed reading this article, absolutely awesome job.
