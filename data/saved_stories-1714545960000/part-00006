Ovie Omo-Agege, told us during the stakeholders\u2019 meeting that\nthe materials would be distributed to the electoral officers at the BON Hotel,\nAkure.\n\n\u201cHe told us that the accreditation would start between 10:00:am and 1:00 pm\nand that voting would commence by 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm.\n\n\u201cBut what we are hearing now is that the election has been concluded and the\nresult announced.\n\n\u201cWe asked the chairman, but he had no answer to our questions. We are not\npeople that could be manipulated by god fathers. So, we are asking our\nnational leadership that if they are not ready, they should postpone it until\nthe right thing is done\n\nFacebookMastodonEmailShare\n\nAPC Court 2024-04-30\n\nAjibola\n\nPrevious: Court dismisses suit seeking to disqualify PDP congress in Edo\n\n### Related Articles\n\n### Court dismisses suit seeking to disqualify PDP congress in Edo\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\n### LG Election: Delta governor warns against imposition of candidates\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\n### PDP chieftain accuses Tinubu of betraying Yahaya Bello and El-Rufai, warns\nof consequence\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n#### Recent Posts\n\n  * Ondo 2024: APC peace deal flops as aggrieved aspirants head to court\n  * Court dismisses suit seeking to disqualify PDP congress in Edo\n  * LG Election: Delta governor warns against imposition of candidates\n  * PDP chieftain accuses Tinubu of betraying Yahaya Bello and El-Rufai, warns of consequence\n  * Ondo APC Primary: Aiyedatiwa receives certificate of return\n\n#### Archives\n\n  * April 2024\n  * March 2024\n  * February 2024\n  * January 2024\n  * December 2023\n  * November 2023\n  * October 2023\n  * September 2023\n  * August 2023\n  * July 2023\n  * June 2023\n  * May 2023\n  * April 2023\n  * March 2023\n  * February 2023\n  * January 2023\n  * December 2022\n  * November 2022\n  * October 2022\n  * September 2022\n  * August 2022\n  * July 2022\n  * June 2022\n  * May 2022\n  * April 2022\n  * March 2022\n  * February 2022\n  * January 2022\n  * December 2021\n  * November 2021\n  * October 2021\n  * September 2021\n  * August 2021\n  * July 2021\n  * June 2021\n  * May 2021\n  * April 2021\n  * March 2021\n  * February 2021\n  * January 2021\n  * December 2020\n  * November 2020\n  * October 2020\n  * September 2020\n  * August 2020\n  * July 2020\n  * June 2020\n  * May 2020\n  * April 2020\n  * March 2020\n  * February 2020\n  * January 2020\n  * December 2019\n  * November 2019\n  * October 2019\n  * September 2019\n  * August 2019\n  * July 2019\n  * June 2019\n  * May 2019\n  * April 2019\n  * March 2019\n  * February 2019\n  * January 2019\n  * December 2018\n  * November 2018\n  * October 2018\n  * September 2018\n  * August 2018\n  * July 2018\n  * June 2018\n  * May 2018\n  * April 2018\n  * March 2018\n  * February 2018\n  * January 2018\n  * December 2017\n  * November 2017\n  * October 2017\n  * September 2017\n\n#### Menu\n\n  * About Us\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Advert Rate\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Politico.ng\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
