Broadcast-based\ncentralized social media, which steadily served as a newsfeed and realtime\nsearch for a small, vocal minority, is basically dead, or on its last legs.\nSearch, namely Google, is basically a useless pile of ads and SEO gamification\nat this point and a stopping point for Reddit results. Everyone has written\nabout it and covered this extensively.\n\nOn the other hand, we have the meteoric rise of these weird LLM things, which\nare really just statistical text generators but that people are using for\ninformation retrieval through paradigms like RAG which are a little like using\na hammer to go fishing.\n\nOn the third hand (a very apt metaphor for generative art), on the heels of\nthe large companies of the last 15 years declining, we have a new indie search\nengine scene emerging, hungry, armed with AI tooling, and ready to take back\nquality on the web.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed myself using more and more of these new tools, both for work and\nout of a personal interest in information retrieval, and finding good stuff\nonline, so I thought I\u2019d share what I\u2019m doing lately with search:\n\nKagi: I\u2019ve been using DuckDuckGo for at least the last 8, and I want to say 10\nyears, as my default search engine, and I loved their initial mission but the\nresults have never been great, and I\u2019d always have to append g!, which meant\nthat I was doing a Google search anyway.\n\nI\u2019ve been hearing more and more about Kagi and finally decided to try it out\nin January. The results were so good that I immediately bought a subscription\nand switched my default search engine in my web and mobile browser to Kagi.\nThey\u2019ve had some controversy lately, among other things, for their very varied\nproduct sprawl, but the search results are so very good, the business model is\nreally pro-user and I can\u2019t see myself going back to Google unless something\nvery bad happens (please stick around, Kagi.)\n\nI also really love their summarization tool, and Small Web. I\u2019ve been browsing\nSmall Web serendipitously non-stop for the past couple days and have been\nsuper surprised and refreshed to find actual people writing actual content\nthat\u2019s not bots, commercials, SEO spam, or aggrandizing. One time, I got a\npost about a guy sailing his boat down the coast of Mexico, and another about\nthe history of Unix packaging. It\u2019s pleasant and relaxing.\n\nThe only thing Kagi is NOT good for yet is local results, finding out when\nrestaurants or parks are open, and directions, which I\u2019m fine with, because\nlocalization means personalization, which I don\u2019t want from this new crop of\nsearch engines...yet, or in the same way that I previously wanted\npersonalization in my products.\n\nMarginalia - I love everything about Marginalia, which is a search engine with\nits own index, run by a single dude, initially on a server in his apartment.\nMarginalia surfaces only non-commerical content, and as the search engine\nsays, \u201cThis search engine isn\u2019t particularly well equipped to answering\nqueries posed like questions, instead try to imagine some text that might\nappear in the website you are looking for, and search for that.\u201d The idea is\nthat you find not exactly what you\u2019re looking for, but something related on\npages that have long been removed from relevance due to the merciless\nPageRank.\n\nExamples of things I\u2019ve searched for include \u201ctransformers architecture\u201d, not\nbecause I was looking to understand transformers, but because I wanted to see\nwhat sources that were not Medium posts or the usual mainstream sources had to\nsay about it. The way I think about Marginalia is a way to find content\noutside of the mainstream, but content that is genuine and deep. Like taking a\ncool dip in the true pool of internet knowledge.\n\nViktor also has amazing technical write-ups of what it\u2019s like to run your own\nsearch engine and optimize it for scale, and all the code is open.\n\nPerplexity - This one has been making headlines and I\u2019ve been reluctant to\nweigh too heavily on any new LLM hype cycle products just yet, but Perplexity\nhas been surprisingly good for the use-case of when I want to look something\ntechnical up and also want the citations and the links because I don\u2019t trust\nLLMs to just generate the answer for me. An example is, \u201chow does a solar\neclipse work?\u201d Another thing I use it for is summarizing PDFs of Arxiv papers.\n\nThe TL;DR is that we are now in the unbundling of search engines and\ninformation retrieval to some extent into task-specific elements, and I\u2019m\nexcited to see what else emerges in the aftermath of the era of Big Search.\n\nDon't miss what's next.
