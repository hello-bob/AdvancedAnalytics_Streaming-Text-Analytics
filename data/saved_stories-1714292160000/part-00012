Do you care enough about the\nenvironment to look at the peer-reviewed science instead?. The headlines and\narticles we read are not supported by science and evidence. Studies reveal\nthat three in four Americans overestimate their ability to identify fake news,\nwhich is why we need an independent, trusted source of information. It turns\nout that only a few percent of the wisest people actually care enough to look\nat the evidence. Are you one of them? I hope so, because our future depends on\nit.\n\nThis site is by a professional scientist who spent over 3000 hours reading\nthousands of scientific articles and reports to find the truth. By reviewing\nwhat is probably the World\u2019s largest collection of science, I discovered that\nalmost everything we\u2019ve been told is simply untrue.\n\nI don\u2019t care if people are against plastics based on the facts, but at present\npeople are against plastics based on clear, unsubstantiated lies. As a leading\nplastic materials scientist, I do not make, sell or market plastics.\nFurthermore, my research on this topic was all done without any funding to\nkeep it free of bias. The website, the videos and even the book are all\nprovided for free, so that we can all start making wiser choices based on hard\nevidence.

Are plastics and bad for the environment and should we ban them?\n\nA. No, according to scientific studies, plastics are usually the greenest\noption. They are better for the environment than metal, glass, cotton and\nusually paper, so replacing plastic harms the environment. Plus, getting rid\nof plastics would be terrible \u2013 no internet, no cell phones, no computers, no\nmedical devices, no electricity to our homes, and so on.\n\nQ. Should we replace PET bottles with aluminum cans or glass bottles?\n\nA. No. Studies show that PET is far greener than aluminium cans or glass\nbottles. Replacing PET would harm the environment \u2013 more energy & waste plus\nthe release of far more carbon dioxide. See data here.\n\nQ. Are there huge floating islands of plastic in the ocean?\n\nA. No. There are no such islands, \u201cpatches\u201d or \u201csoup\u201d. There are areas where\nplastics concentrate but levels are so low, you can\u2019t even tell if you are\nsailing or swimming there. Click here to see the the full story.\n\nQ. Should we switch to biodegradable materials?\n\nA. No. Biodegradable plastics are less green than standard plastics and when\nthey degrade, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide.\n\nQ. Do plastics take 1000 years to degrade?\n\nA. No. Plastics degrade just like all carbon-based materials like wood and\nleaves. Experiments prove that a plastic bag disintegrates in less than one\nyear outdoors. Click here for more information on plastics degradation.\n\nQ. Will there be more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050?\n\nA. No. This was debunked (see BBC article). Also, they recently realized that\nthey overestimated the plastic entering the oceans from rivers by 100-1000\ntimes. It was previously thought that millions of tons of microplastic enter\nthe oceans from rivers but the latest estimate is now 6 thousand tons. A new\ndedicated page debunking the more plastic than fish myth can be found here.\n\nQ. Are the oil industry pushing plastics onto the market to save themselves\nfrom declining sales?\n\nA. No. If you increase supply of a commodity, like plastics, the price drops\nand you lose money. It makes no business sense to artificially increase the\nsupply.\n\nQ. Are there 100,000 microplastic particles per gram of fruit and vegetables?\n\nA. No. When you read the study you find they didn\u2019t detect any plastic at all.\nIt is a shamefully poor piece of science and it has been reported to the\npublisher for retraction. Click here for more information on microplastics.\n\nQ. Should we use more metal & glass because they are recycled at a higher\nrate?\n\nA. No. Metal and glass are terrible for the environment. The solution is to\nkeep increasing recycling rates for plastic, which many countries have already\ndone.\n\nQ. Is the Grand Canyon drowning in microplastic dust?\n\nA. No. This article says that 10-20 tons of plastic dust is deposited on the\nGrand Canyon per year. That sounds like a lot, so I checked and the total dust\nlanding on the Grand Canyon is 50 000 tons per year meaning plastic is just\n0.03% of the total. A little perspective goes a long way! source: Atmospheric\nDust Deposition Varies by Season and Elevation in the Colorado Front Range,\nUSA Also they found that the natural dust is enriched in heavy metals like\nlead and cadmium. It also contains large amounts of quartz, which is proven to\ncause cancer.\n\nQ. Were microplastics found in the placenta and should we be concerned?\n\nA. Microplastic is the latest kind of dust found in the placenta. For example,\nstudies show that titanium dioxide, carbon black and silica have all been\nfound. It is interesting that microplastics in the placenta generated such\ninterest whereas no-one had any interest in the other particles. Sources:\nSilica and Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Cause Pregnancy Complications in\nMice \u2013 Ambient black carbon particles reach the fetal side of human placenta \u2013\nBasal Ti level in the human placenta and meconium and evidence of a materno-\nfoetal transfer of food-grade TiO_2 nanoparticles in an ex vivo placental\nperfusion model\n\nQ. Is it true that hermit crabs were stimulated by toxins from plastic?\n\nA. No \u2013 the chemical in the study was not a toxin but an FDA food contact\napproved additive called oleamide that has been used in plastics and cosmetics\nwithout issue for decades.\n\nQ. Is it true that Henderson Island is overwhelmed with plastic pollution?\n\nA. No \u2013 although it has been claimed that the remote island is covered in\nplastic on the beaches, GoogleMaps satellite images show that the beaches are\nclean. Click here to see for yourself and see the screenshot below.\n\nQ. Are PVA detergent pods a problem because they fail to biodegrade?\n\nA. No \u2013 this has been studied and they were found to biodegrade rapidly. Click\nhere to see what the scientists say.\n\nQ. Microplastics have been found in the Antarctic - should we be concerned?\n\nA. No \u2013 dust is everywhere so reporting it is non news. Microplastics are\n0.03% of dust and shown to be non-toxic. What about the other 99.7% of the\ndust? Much of that is proven to cause cancer or be toxic so why not mention\nthat? Because demonizing plastics is so much easier than presenting the\nscience properly in perspective. See more about the science and perspective\nhere. Also see Microplastics in Antarctic snow: Shocking discovery or a case\nof plastics persecution?\n\nQ. Should we replace plastics because they create a waste problem?\n\nA. No. Plastics are less that 0.5% of all waste and they are proven to reduce\noverall waste creation including waste going to landfill. Replacing plastics\nmeans creating 3-4x pounds of waste for every pound of plastic replaced.\n\nQ. Are plastics a major source of carbon dioxide and global warming?\n\nA. No. Scientific studies reveal that just 0.5% of all carbon dioxide is\ncreated by the manufacture of plastics and that plastics alternatives generate\nfar more. See this dedicated page for more on the carbon footprint of\nplastics.\n\nQ. Should we ban plastics because they cause litter?\n\nA. No. The scientific evidence shows that people are the cause of litter, not\nmaterials. Over 80% of litter is dropped intentionally. To stop litter, we\nneed to encourage better human behaviour via education and legislation.\n\nQ. Do plastics items harm marine wildlife?\n\nA. Abandoned nets in particular cause harm. However, replacing plastic nets\nwith rope nets does not solve the problem. The problem is people who abandon\nnets, not plastic. Comprehensive scientific studies show that plastics are not\na significant threat to turtles, whales or birds as shown in this video.\n\nQ. Should we ban plastic bags?\n\nA. No. Plastic bags are the greenest alternative (see details here). Changing\nto paper bags means cutting down millions more trees per year, more carbon\ndioxide released & generating up to 10x more waste. A lifecycle analysis\nprofessional examined all 24 studies on bags and concluded:\n\n\u201cFrom all 24 reports and reviews assessed, the actual LCA analyses on grocery\nbags overwhelmingly point to plastic as the material with least environmental\nimpact, both at single use level and multi-purpose.\u201d\n\nNeil Shackelton \u2013 Founder, Medoola\n\nQ. Do plastics consume huge amounts of fossil fuel?\n\nA. No. Only 4-5% of oil is used to make plastics and the plastics save more\nthan that by reducing the weight of our cars, by thermally insulating\nbuildings and by using less energy to make than other materials. Furthermore,\nalthough oil is used in plastic materials, far more oil is burnt to to create\nother materials like metal and glass.\n\nQ. Does the USA consume 500 million straws per day?\n\nA. No. That number was made up by a 9 year old schoolboy named Milo Cress. The\npress repeated it without thinking to check it first.\n\nQ. Is LEGO washing up on beaches really a problem?\n\nA. No. They found LEGO on a beach in England where a well-known ship accident\ndropped a million LEGO pieces.\n\nQ. Did a study find microplastics in human tissue?\n\nA. No. They placed the microplastic in the body to see whether they could\ndetect it. Quote from The Guardian newspaper \u201cThis article was updated on 17\nAugust 2020, after more information was provided to the Guardian by the\nresearchers, to reflect the fact that the plastic particles had been inserted\ninto the samples of human tissue.\u201d\n\nQ. Was a plastic straw pulled out of a sea turtle\u2019s nose?\n\nA. There is no evidence that it was. They never analyzed the object to see if\nthe object was made of plastic. They wrote an email admitting that they were\nnot sure it was a straw at all. There was never a peer-reviewed publication on\nit either, so this story is nothing but gossip. A page here fully debunks the\nturtle and straw myth.\n\nQ. Do plastics increase carbon dioxide emissions?\n\nA. Studies show that although some CO_2 is given off making plastics, overall\nthey reduce carbon dioxide by 1. massively reducing food waste 2. massively\nreducing gasoline consumption of vehicles 3. reducing use of coal, gas and oil\nfor heating through their thermal insulating properties. Studies that only\nlook at the CO_2 given off while making plastic are therefore very misleading.\nLastly, it is important to note that plastic replacements like paper, metal\nand glass give off 5-15x more CO_2 when produced. The subject of plastics and\ncarbon dioxide is covered in detail on this page.\n\nQ. Are the plastics we use releasing toxic chemicals?\n\nA. Plastics themselves cannot release anything because polymer molecules are\ntoo large to move around. Additives in plastics can be released but all\nadditives are strictly regulated. Any additives found to be cause for concern\nare banned. It is also worth remembering that apples, pears, apricots, bananas\nand even wood release toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde and yet, as with\nplastics, the levels are too low to be of concern.\n\nQ. Is it true that we eat a credit card's worth of plastic per week?\n\nA. No. That study funded by the WWF actually says \u201chumans may ingest 0.1 to 5\ng of microplastics weekly\u201d, (5g is one credit card in weight). A newer and\nindependent study Lifetime Accumulation of Microplastic in Children and Adults\nsaid that the amount of microplastic consumed is negligible and it would take\nover 20 000 years to ingest a credit card worth of plastic.\n\nQ. Are PFAS, so-called \"forever chemicals\" a real plastics issue?\n\nA. No. Most PFAS are not plastic in nature and the few that are (PTFE etc.)\nhave been proven safe.\n\nhttps://www.safeopedia.com/definition/2850/parts-per-trillion-ppt\nhttps://www.ewg.org/research/national-pfas-testing/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072821/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2920088/#b10-ehp.0901827\n\nQ. Is it true that plastics are a major cause of bird mortalities?\n\nA. No \u2013 there is no evidence to support that claim. In fact, scientific\nstudies show the causes and plastic is not one of them. Click here to see for\nyourself. More science showing that plastics are not a significant threat to\nanimals is shown in this video.\n\nQ. Is it true that microplastics can cross the blood-brain barrier?\n\nA. Yes \u2013 however, the study used a special type of particle only found in\nlaboratories meaning it does not exist in the environment. Therefore the study\nis not meaningful.\n\nQ. Are there microplastics in human blood and should we be concerned?\n\nA. Any particles in dust of the right size can end up in blood, so this is not\nnews. Because microplastics are just 0.03% of dust, the levels found were\nextremely low, i.e. about 1 part per million. Furthermore, there is no\ncredible evidence of harm. It appears that the media are more interested in\nscaring us than in bringing is accurate information and that was proven in a\nrecent scientific study.
