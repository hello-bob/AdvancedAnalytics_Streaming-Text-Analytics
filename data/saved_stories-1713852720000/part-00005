The basic gist\nthat I am trying to get across is that\n\n  1. From the perspective of many sponsored and affiliated projects, NumFOCUS has been struggling to meet their needs in an adequate or timely manner. At a Town Hall meeting in February, NumFOCUS announced it is moving in a new direction, which caught many by surprise.\n\n  2. Over the years, NumFOCUS has lacked transparency in how its board is selected, had a mixture of early-resignations as well board members staying well beyond term limits, has struggled to incorporate a European affiliate for 9 years, and is currently overdue in providing minutes for the second half of 2023, or any part of 2024.\n\n  3. NumFOCUS initiated an effort to run an election for open board seats and proposed changing its governance structure.\n\n  4. Related to 1 and 2, some projects are considering and actively pursuing alternative venues for fiscal sponsorship.\n\nI have been in touch with many members of the community, including a half-\ndozen former and one current NumFOCUS board members, to get their perspective,\nwhich I include below. I welcome your corrections, clarifications, and\nthoughts.\n\nYou can join the discussion on LinkedIn, Mastodon, Twitter (most of the\nresponses are on the LinkedIn post).\n\nOutline:\n\n>   * Brief overview of concerns stemming from the NumFOCUS Town Hall meeting\n>   * Feedback from former board members and community members\n>   * Responses from NumFOCUS\n>   * 501c6\n>\n>     * NumFOCUS origin story\n>     * Linux Foundation: Voltron of Bureaucracy\n>     * How a 501c6 differs from a 501c3\n>   * NumFOCUS Europe: still not a thing 9 years later\n>   * Elections\n>\n>     * Term limits \u2014 what are they good for?

It was therefore surprising to learn of the\nplan to form a 501c6 in addition to the 501c3 while navigating these\n(underspecified?) headwinds. >> skip to 501c6 section >>\n\nNumFOCUS Executive Director Leah Silen outlined some of the challenges related\nto forming a European entity, though I was alarmed to hear about 17 accounting\nfirms not being sufficient to arrive at a suitable accommodation. >> skip to\nNF Europe section >>\n\nThere was also a theme of AI, which is not representative of interest or\nrelevance to every project. \"AI\" was mentioned 37 times, according to the\ntranscript. It wasn't clear if this is a new direction for NumFOCUS as a\nwhole, if it is related to and somehow bundled with the 501c6 move, or if it's\njust an announcement of direction for the Open-Source Science initiative\nthat's a joint partnership between NF and IBM. (This does not have its own\nsection, but does get mentioned in the feedback from former board members and\ncommunity members)\n\nFinally, the last concern raised for me was around a proposed election and\nchange in governance structure of NumFOCUS. >> skip to the Elections section\n>>\n\nAt the conclusion of this post, I link to some alternatives to NumFOCUS >>\nskip to the paths forward section >>\n\n## Feedback from former board members and community members\n\nI posted on mastodon, linkedin, and twitter:\n\n> Anyone else have concerns about the proposed new direction of NumFOCUS? I\n> finally watched the recording from Monday\u2019s Town Hall and I\u2019d love to talk /\n> read your thoughts, be it in public or in private.\n\nIn response to my feeler about concerns, here's some of what I heard back.\n\nOne former board member wrote this:\n\n> I guess it would come as no surprise that I have some concerns. A few\n> include\n>\n>   * Misdirected AI thrust.\n>\n>   * Repeated claims of funding the projects, without mentioning overhead\n> taken from project grants.\n>\n>   * Emphasis on organization & personnel growth, instead of focusing on\n> existing service delivery.\n>\n>   * Complex organizational restructure, when services are not being rendered\n> effectively. New structure separates current board from technical board;\n> risks isolating projects further.\n>\n>   * 501c6: new opportunities for funding (potentially good), but NF has no\n> current demonstrated route other than SDG[^1] to get funding to projects,\n> and no related policies in place.\n>\n>   * Board elections: the committee solicited will not control next election\n> of board? Board should have more community representation.\n>\n>   * Board is in contravention of bylaws (president, e.g., has been on the\n> board for a year longer than allowed).\n>\n>\n\nAnother former board member said:\n\n> I do have concerns. Unfortunately from my past and current experience with\n> NumFOCUS, I don\u2019t see a lot of ability to influence change\n\nA third former board member wrote:\n\n> I have a confession. I never ran any grants through NF because I didn't\n> trust them.\n\nA fourth former board member wrote:\n\n> It has been many years since I have been on the NumFOCUS board...When I was\n> on the board - strong personalities generally drove much of the direction.\n> ... At that point there could have been more engagement with community and\n> projects, but I am saying this with the wisdom of looking back (ah\n> hindsight, if only we had you sooner).\n\nA community project leader wrote:\n\n> The new proposed governance structure seems to come out of the current\n> board/staff without any input from anyone from the projects (that I know of)\n> and as [redacted] mentioned the new structure may not really help with\n> getting the community together\n\nAnother community project leader wrote:\n\n> I also found it underwhelming to say the least... It even annoyed me on the\n> AI take. I thought we wanted to push science and open source, not please one\n> specific board member and the investors.

So the question is where to next. Things that have been\n> spitballed in our various conversations:\n>\n>   * start a new non-profit\n>   * start a co-op\n>   * find a different sponsor\n>   * take over NumFOCUS\n>\n\nMore private communication:\n\n> I have so many thoughts on NF, but so far I have been sharing them in small\n> support groups only.

Logan holds the position of Secretary on the NF\nboard, so had he responded to me, I could have followed up to ask about why\nthe board has not released meeting minutes for the past 11 months, but I did\nnot get this opportunity.\n\nI also emailed Sylvain Corlay, a current board member I know personally from\nour long time shared involvement with Jupyter, and he did respond, I am\nincluding some of what he shared with me in this post, starting with\nclarification about what I referred to as \"underspecified headwinds\":\n\n> Regarding the pain points that were encountered, I believe that Leah was\n> referring to complaints from projects regarding the slow processing of\n> financial service requests by NumFOCUS. I think that a lot of these issues\n> have been addressed, especially after the recruitment of Miriam, our new\n> finance director.\n>\n> In my opinion, the growth of NumFOCUS in recent years has presented us with\n> the typical challenges that any organization encounters during growth.\n> NumFOCUS deals with a high level of detail on the accounting of projects\n> (down to the individual travel expense, and regular financial reporting on\n> grants etc), and the number of affiliated projects has grown from a dozen to\n> over sixty. The way in which you can operate when you have a dozen sponsored\n> project and when you get closer to a hundred is not the same - and the way\n> to address this question required systemic changes - such as adopting better\n> tools and processes - which understandably took time to implement. I think\n> that we are better equipped now, and Leah presented plans around adopting\n> new tools, notably a ticketing system for financial requests.\n>\n> (A side note: While some frustration was understandable, I think that some\n> of the criticism received was unfair. The consolidated accounting that\n> NumFOCUS provides for all projects is more complex than it may initially\n> appear, as I can attest as a business owner.)\n\nBecause I also asked about the pervading AI preoccupation at the Town Hall,\nSylvain responded to that:\n\n> I don't think this is very central in our plans for NumFOCUS, but several\n> people have said that they felt that the PyData ecosystem and NumFOCUS had\n> \"missed\" AI.\n\nThere's more from Sylvain in the 501c6 and NumFOCUS Europe sections.\n\n## 501c6\n\n### NumFOCUS origin story\n\nNumFOCUS started as an organization in 2012. Here's a snippet from the\nNumFOCUS history page where I just correct one inaccuracy, the part about\nAnthony coming up with the NumFOCUS name, by crossing it off:\n\n> In the early Oughts, the open source scientific computing community was\n> reaching a critical point of maturity for Numeric/Numpy, IPython,\n> Matplotlib, and SciPy. By 2010, a critical mass of projects were in need of\n> a more formal structure to provide support and help to organize the\n> community.\n>\n> ...enter NumFOCUS!\n>\n> Travis Oliphant (author of NumPy), Fernando P\u00e9rez (author of IPython), Perry\n> Greenfield (author of Numarray and Astropy), John Hunter (author of\n> Matplotlib), Jarrod Millman (release manager for SciPy), and Anthony Scopatz\n> (who came up with the name \"NumFOCUS\") became the founding board of NumFOCUS\n\nHave you ever wondered why FOCUS is capitalized? The name came from Travis\nOliphant in January 2012, in a thread he started with a dozen people[^2] whose\nsubject was \"New Foundation Name?\" After a few of us tossed in some initial\nideas as well as desirable properties of the new name, Travis pitched the\nfollowing :\n\n> Foundation for Open and Usable Code for Science -- or\n>\n> Foundation for Open Code Usable for Science (FOCUS)\n\nwhich Anthony Scopatz suggested be modified:\n\n> +1 with the following modification \"Foundation for Open Code for Usable\n> Science.\" There are many codes \"usable for science\" but very few that make\n> science more transparent and usable.\n\nA few days later, Travis followed up\n\n> So, what about NumFOCUS for the name of the foundation? Initially it will\n> represent \"NumPy Foundation for Open Code for Usable Science\" But, later the\n> Num can just represent anything relating to Numerical Computing.\n>\n> Unless there are strong objections (or better alternatives that emerge in\n> the next few days), I think I will go ahead and start the legal process with\n> this name. I will give another 3 days for other ideas to emerge, then with\n> the help of legal zoom start things going.\n\nThere was some assent, and no alternatives or opposition, so Travis moved\nforward with the plan, reporting that \"NumFocus, Inc.\" was formed as a Texas\nnon-profit corporation a week later (January 14th, 2012).\n\nTravis Oliphant and Peter Wang also founded a company at the same time,\nContinuum Analytics, which later renamed to Anaconda to reflect and capitalize\non the recoginition of its popular Python distribution. Again back to the\nNumFOCUS history page\n\n> Continuum Analytics (now Anaconda) provided integral support on many levels\n> during the early years of NumFOCUS. This included space for the first\n> NumFOCUS office, support staff, and salary of the Executive Director. They\n> also launched the first PyData and contributed many resources and funds to\n> the early events which made it possible for event proceeds to directly\n> support NumFOCUS.\n\nSo NumFOCUS, from inception, has had some form of corporate sponsorship. The\nexecutive directory mentioned is Leah Silen, who has been the executive\ndirectory of NumFOCUS for as long as NF has had an executive director. Being a\n501c3 non-profit allows individuals and corporations which pay taxes in the\nUnited States to donate to NumFOCUS and deduct those donations on their tax\nreturns. There was a period of time where there was some notion of \"becoming a\nmember\" of NumFOCUS though donation as an individual, but that has gone away,\nthough there is still a way for corporations to get perks for donating, for\nexample, if they donate $50,000 dollars or more, they get a seat on the\nAdvisory Council.\n\nWhen I first found out that NF proposed forming a 501c6, alarm bells started\ngoing off in my head, because of the reputation of and my experiences with\nanother 501c6: The Linux Foundation. And by a happy coincidence, I had just\nstumbled across a pithy and apt description of what's wrong with the Linux\nFoundation.\n\n### Linux Foundation: Voltron of Bureaucracy\n\nFor the impatient, I include Rob Landley's words from the clip above, but I\nrecommend the original source video for its superior delivery:\n\n> The Linux Foundation was formed when two black holes of bureaucracy combined\n> to form Voltron of Bureaucracy. ...and when they combined, the focus shifted\n> from maintaining this standard, to asking donors for money.\n\nLinux Foundation has a well deserved reputation for being pay-to-play. It's\nwhere vendors with big pocket books send money. Rob Landley has a more a more\nmeaty post explaining the LF situation in 2010\n\n> ...the Linux Foundation has set itself up to translate between Fortune 500\n> companies and individual hobbyist developers. And it's very good at talking\n> to Fortune 500 companies, because that's where its money comes from. But\n> it's not very good at talking to hobbyists, because it's a giant\n> bureaucracy, which is the antithesis of hobbyist \"playing around with\n> stuff\".\n>\n> ...The Linux Foundation tries to influence and monitor Linux development, to\n> provide results for the corporations that fund it. It sponsors conferences,\n> writes white papers, maintains a technical advisory board... It's a bit like\n> a modern Usenix, really.\n\nAround that same time, I was a member of the Linux Foundation (2010-2012) - I\nwas young and naive. I thought it was amazing to have an organization that\nincludes individuals: a grad student tinkerer like me, along with professional\ndevelopers who get to work on the Linux kernel full-time. After seeing Jim\nZemlin, the Linux Foundation Executive Director, give a talk at Xerox PARC in\n2010 using a Mac and making excuses how Linux isn't quite there for doing\npresentations, which clearly demonstrated what total corporate shill he was,\nespecially given his \"vision\" for Linux was that a) it was already everywhere,\nand b) in the future, it will be more everywhere. I thought that things could\nturn for the better, it was a temporary accident that someone both dismissive\nand vacuously bombastic about Linux was leading the Linux Foundation. I was\nwrong. Zemlin is still the LF Executive director now.\n\nRob Landley had a much closer view of the Linux Foundation transformation:\n\n> Oh I worked for them back in 2007. (The Documentation fellowship.) There was\n> some definite frog boiling going on there over the years, they got more\n> bureaucratic as time went on. The purge of all hobbyists from Linux\n> development didn't happen until... it wasn't until 2013 they started asking\n> \"do we still have any hobbyists in this community, what IS a hobbyist\n> anyway?\"\n>\n> And then ignoring the replies\n\nMichael Crusoe pointed to a post by Matthew Garrett from 2016 titled Linux\nFoundation quietly drops community representation\n\n### How a 501c6 differs from a 501c3\n\nA 2016 post by Eben Moglen (that Rob Landley referred me to) contains this\nexplanation:\n\n> The Linux Foundation, which was formed by merging OSDL and the Free\n> Standards Group, is a trade association, which is a special form of legal\n> entity under US tax law. It is not a charity, or a public service\n> organization. It\u2019s an association of businesses, paying dues, in order to\n> achieve common business purposes, which in the case of LF results in a wide\n> range of activities, all centered around promoting the success of Linux.\n> Because it does not pay federal income taxes, and its exemption\u2014like those\n> of charitable or public benefit organizations\u2014comes from section 501c of the\n> Internal Revenue Code, lay observers might suppose that it has some\n> \u201ccommunity benefit\u201d function, but the precise opposite is true. The tax-\n> exemption rationale for trade associations is that their primary income is\n> the dues paid to them for achievement of business purposes. Since that\n> expenditure would be a business expense netted against revenue for the\n> member businesses if they performed the same tasks individually, there is a\n> sharp disincentive to group together for common business purposes unless the\n> dues are also untaxed in the hands of the recipient. It is axiomatic to\n> their identity that trade associations aren\u2019t charities, that they only\n> benefit their donors (as opposed to 501c3 tax exempt charities, which must\n> not benefit their donors specially), and that they pursue business goals,\n> not social interests.\n\nNumFOCUS Board member Sylvain Corlay explained this about the 501c6\n\n> On the subject of the 501c6, some projects expressed disappointment that\n> NumFOCUS was not actively engaged in fundraising on their behalf. While we\n> offer assistance with grant proposals and fund small development grants,\n> there is no dedicated effort to secure additional funding for projects such\n> as Jupyter. This is something that we want to be more deliberate about.\n>\n> A successful funding model employed by other open-source foundations, and\n> which requires using a 501c6, is a membership model for companies, as\n> exemplified by the Linux Foundation. This model provides revenue recurrence\n> and aligns well with building a relationship with regular donors. (It also\n> matches well with how large corporations are used to engage with such open-\n> source foundations.) Finally, such a membership model scales really well\n> compared to a grant-based funding model.\n\nI think that the 501c6 direction was the wrong one for NumFOCUS to pursue. The\nreason is that we have a nonprofit, that was created to serve the public good,\nnow transforming itself to also serve the needs of the business community. I'm\nnot against someone wanting to set up a 501c6 for scientific open source\nprojects, I just think that NF doing this, without consulting projects, given\nhow much dissatisfaction there has been with NF on their core services they're\nsupposed to provide projects, is particularly treacherous[^3].\n\nTo project the LF situation into our ecosystem, the hobbyists there are the\nacademics here, if you squint. And if scikit-learn, one of the breakout\nsuperstar projects, can't get help from NF to get a credit card so they can\nrun CI with GPUs for months at a time, it'll only get worse when NF starts to\nconsider businesses who pay NF real money and expect real service as a 501c6.\nLike it'll be Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc, as \"members\", and\nsure, you and me will be \"members\", too, I'm sure we'll all be treated\nequally.\n\nYou can click on the image above, but I also reproduce the text from a scikit-\nlearn developer posting on the NumFOCUS slack #general channel in October\n2023:\n\n> So from the scikit-learn side, we started the process of trying to get a PEX\n> credit card in May so that we can pay for GPUs in our CI.\n>\n> After some discussions, we filed the form in June for the card, and I put my\n> info there as for the name on the card.\n>\n> Now, being October, apparently the account requested for me is on hold or\n> blocked (talking to @Mir Mueller about it), and my guess is that it's\n> because my name sounds too middle eastern for the bank. My nationality on\n> the request is not even Iran, I'm using my German nationality to request it,\n> and it's still blocked (for now at least). With conversations with many\n> members of the staff, including @Leah Silen I've been asking for a European\n> entity since 2019 at least, and I think NumFocus now does have a European\n> entity, which AFAIK is not used. The reason I've asked for it has been two\n> folds:\n>\n>   * donors can deduct donations from their taxes if they're in Europe and\n> they donate to a European NGO kind of entity.\n>   * we can fund and financially deal with people who come from countries\n> against whom US is very hostile, like me.\n>\n\n>\n> In the context of diversity and getting people from the global south, it's\n> also important that we could actually do that, and it's not just all talks.\n>\n> Believe if or not, it's really not fun to have to deal with such issues and\n> after 4 months still not be able to have a simple PEX card. For people like\n> me, it would be really nice if we could actually deal with the European\n> entity, and have our dealings with that entity instead of having to deal\n> with the US system. So the question is, how can we get to actually do this\n> and what's needed for it to happen?\n\nThe mention of \"asking for a European entity since 2019 at least\" is a good\nsegue to the next concern.\n\n## NumFOCUS Europe: still not a thing 9 years later\n\nFrom the board meeting notes for December 1, 2014 (page 50 of NumFOCUS Meeting\nMinutes 2014-2015)\n\n> Moving forward to establish NumFOCUS as a charitable organization in Europe\n> as a Dutch \u201cfoundation\u201d to receive donations from European entities at a\n> cost of $1,500.\n\nAnd a note on the same page:\n\n> France has more potential members? - However France is worst place to set up\n\nFast forward to 2024, and the \"What is our status in Europe?\" comes up again\nat the Town Hall, at 1 hour and 2 minutes into the recording (passcode is\nNFtownhall2024-12-02 )\n\nThese are Leah Silen's quotes from the Town Hall:\n\n> Boy. This has been so much more of a challenge than we ever could imagine.\n> this, as soon we had the bank account. Everything set up, we decided to go\n> the Volunteer Association in France that was established over 2 years ago.\n\nThen mentions difficulties in getting an accountant and a bank account set\nup...\n\n> We're also looking at other countries now to move forward. The other country\n> we initially had thought about setting up a organization a branch in the\n> Netherlands, and we are. We've got all our documentation about halfway\n> finished with that. \"\n>\n> 3 people working on this right now. So I think. I think Miriam reached out\n> to like something crazy like 17 accounting. And financial firms in France,\n> mostly in Paris. And literally, yeah. Haven't gotten a response back. So\n> we're working on it. And if this doesn't work, we're we're not gonna yeah,\n> we need to pivot and come up with a different plan\n\nThis is where things stand 9 years later.\n\nActually, turns out there's even been a bit more progress. A current board\nmember, Sylvain Corlay, who joined the board in 2018, provided some more\ncontext in an email to me on March 1st:\n\n> When I joined the board, I was really keen on pushing forward the subject of\n> building the organization in Europe - however there was a lot of resistance\n> in the beginning about it on the NumFOCUS board...\n\nMomentum was lost for personal, professional, and later pandemic reasons.\n\n> So we had lost the initial energy to get this done. We are back on pushing\n> this subject because having EU-based operations would be very beneficial at\n> many levels for NumFOCUS.\n>\n> An unforeseen challenge arose when we discovered that non-EU individuals\n> cannot have admin access to French bank accounts. To address this, we have\n> partnered with a bank that grants both myself and Didrik[^4] administrative\n> access, while US-based individuals have \"accountant access\" to view all\n> transactions.\n>\n> In our search for an accounting firm, I initially hoped to engage the same\n> firm that QuantStack uses. However they declined because they did not work\n> with nonprofits. (Typically, voluntary associations do not employ accounting\n> firms). NumFOCUS staff reached out to multiple accounting firms without\n> success. However, in the meantime, we managed to get the accounting firm\n> that we use for QuantStack to agree to take this on, and to give NumFOCUS a\n> hefty discount on their rates. So we are now moving forward\n\nSo there's some progress here, and that's good news. It's too bad that there's\nno way for anyone to know this, because the board has not released meeting\nminutes for the past 11 months.\n\n## Elections\n\nAfter I made my post following the Town Hall, Leah Silen reached out to me to\ntalk about my concerns, but I had not yet synthesized my thoughts. In my reply\nto her I decided to focus on just the elections, expressed interest in the\nElection Committee, and asked about how many seats will be getting filled, and\nbased on Leah's reply, the plan was that there would be four seats.\n\n### Term limits \u2014 what are they good for? Absolutely nothing. Say it again.\n\nI followed up, wondering if the intent was to have the board shrinking to\nseven member, as I believe Logan Kilpatrick, Rosie Pongracz, and Larry Gray\nare the only board members who are not over their term limit, or are some\nboard members who are over their term limit intending to stay on the board\nlonger.\n\nLeah replied\n\n> Because Katrina and James are officers, their terms are ending in July. We\n> wanted to give the 4 new members who will be elected as soon as possible an\n> opportunity to take advantage of their organizational knowledge and not have\n> a majority of the board brand new at one time. We'll be holding another\n> election in Q3 to fill these slots and fill any others required to move to\n> the two-board structure - Technical and Administrative Boards.\n\nHow could Katrina Riehl and James Powell terms be ending in July if they are\nboth over the term limit for serving on the board? They both began serving\ntheir terms in October 2018 [^5] , each term lasts 2 years, and there's a\npossibility of renewal for an additional term, so 4 years later - back in\n2022, should have been when their board tenure ended.\n\nI understand the appeal of this approach, it's a \"nice to have\" for\ninstitutional knowledge to be passed on with overlapping board transition.\nAbiding by the bylaws of the organization, however, should be \"non-\nnegotiable\". What does it say about the integrity or priorities of an\norganization that is willing to allow board members to continue to serve on\nthe board, in violation of its own bylaws?\n\nI am opposed to this plan, and find it problematic. A possible resolution\nwould be to have current board members who are over the term limit, but are\nwishing to continue to serve NumFOCUS to do so by joining the Advisory\nCouncil.\n\nArticle 5 section 2 of the NumFOCUS bylaws state that\n\n> The Board of Directors may, by resolution, establish a council of advisors\n> (the \u201cAdvisory Council\u201d) to be comprised of one or more individuals chosen\n> by the Board of Directors at its sole discretion. The Board of Directors\n> shall not be bound by any advice or decision of the Advisory Council.

This github repository has a link to the\nmeeting minutes, and the issues contain discussion of what's being worked on.\n\nIn some way, this whole post, and specifically this Elections portion of it,\nis among my contributions to Issue #5: communicate context to community.\n\nOne of the reasons the elections committee is shrinking and having trouble\nmaking progress is because of a moving of goal posts. I guess I haven't spoken\nto other members of the elections committee about this, but that is one of the\nreasons I'm having a difficult time trying to engage on the elections front.\nAs a concrete example, at the third meeting of the Election Committee (March\n18th), Leah informed us that there would be seven seats in the upcoming\nelection, instead of four, because the Board and Executive Director decided to\nmove up the previous plan to split the board into administrative and technical\nboards to this upcoming election. I asked if the bylaws have been changed, and\nwas told that they will be. But there's no way for anyone to know this,\nbecause the board has not released meeting minutes for the past 11 months.\n\n### Previous \"Election\" non-transparency\n\nIn May 2014, there was a post from Andy Terrel describing that\n\n> The current board was elected without terms kept in mind. While we love all\n> our board members, we realize that a rotating board has many advantages.\n> Going forward we would like to have yearly elections with each board member\n> elected to a two year term. By alternating between half the board being\n> elected each year, we will have a fair amount of overlap to keep the day to\n> day affairs in order. Board members will not be limited to a specific number\n> of terms.\n\nAt some point, the \"half the board being elected each year\" idea fell through,\nand was revised to allow the board member to renew for a second term without\nan election.\n\nIn 2018, there was an announcement of an election for the board.\n\nI ran for a seat, along with 24 other people, and took a look at the bylaws\nand found that it wasn't really an election, because the new board members\nwould be elected by the current board, per the bylaws. I suggested they change\nthe word \"election\" to \"endorsement\" - because the input the board was seeking\nfrom the community was not actually binding in terms of who would get to be on\nthe board. That change was accepted by Andy Terrel.\n\nI made my suggestion on August 3rd. A blog post from July 20th announcing the\nelection was edited, such that it appears now that this was always called an\nendorsement, but that change could not have been made until at the earliest\nthe very last day of the Nomination period. Andy acknowledges after the board\nis selected:\n\n> In hindsight, we should not have used the word \u201celection\u201d anywhere, as many\n> assume that the candidates with the highest vote counts will automatically\n> be selected. We needed to apply a selection step in the process to ensure\n> the resulting board had diversity, members willing to serve as officers, and\n> the right mix of background and expertise to lead a rapidly growing non-\n> profit organization.\n\nThe July 12, 2018 NF board meetings include the following plan for the\nelection\n\n>   * Election process?\n>\n>     1. Nomination process; any member can nominate.\n>     2. Voting by all members in leadership positions \u2192 to be defined in\n> detail, e.g. 5 hours a month of community work.\n>     3. Consensus ratification (can include possible adaptation for\n> diversity, community representation, etc.)\n>   * Come back to this process by email. Nomination email end next week.\n> Target voting date: end of August, one month before Summit.\n>\n\nBut then the board, in announcing \"election\" results only said who was added\nto the board, and not the results of that endorsement (n\u00e9e election).\n\nWhat they did announce was that \"212 out of 763 eligible donating and\nvolunteering members submitted endorsements\", and that of the 25 candidates,\ntwelve received more than an arbitrary 5% of the vote, which made the board\ndeem them as \"finalists\", and five new board members were selected from among\nthese finalists.\n\nI tried to cajole board members (both then current, and then incoming) to\nrelease this data to the public, and though some were sympathetic, they as a\nbody did not budge and kept it under wraps and out of scrutiny.\n\nHere are some excerpts of me trying to convince board members to release the\nvoting totals in 2018.\n\nFrom an email thread with then board member Andy Terrel:\n\n> I think the trouble with the current outcome is it's completely opaque: it\n> feels like a backroom deal.\n>\n> I assert that any reason behind not releasing the numbers should be\n> outweighed by the benefit of being transparent and honest about what\n> happened. This applies equally in terms of reflecting community input, and\n> in terms of being able to see if and how the board incorporated that\n> information into their decision making process.\n>\n> The board made some decisions, but there is no way to evaluate, scrutinize,\n> or analyze that decision due to the absence of information. It may be\n> uncomfortable that a prominent member of the community received too few, it\n> may be uncomfortable that the someone with a wide level of community support\n> was \"passed over\" for a board position for someone with less support. But\n> whatever the realities are, they are just that: real. And we can have\n> uncomfortable conversations if need be, or change the process for the\n> future, but let's not sweep it under the rug. The current optics of the\n> situation are that the board feels it knows what's best, made some difficult\n> decisions, but does not wish to have any oversight or accountability for\n> those decisions.\n>\n> I'm very glad you wrote up the post reflecting the challenges with this\n> process, this is a good thing and let's not stop there. Whatever challenges\n> we have, we can only face them if we are honest about them. As Supreme Court\n> Justice Louis Brandeis wrote over a hundred years ago: \"Sunlight is said to\n> be the best of disinfectants.\"\n\nFrom email thread with then board member Lorena Barba:\n\n> I disagree that I am seeking answers where there are none. I am seeking\n> transparency and clarity for what that broad-brush fuzzy indication of\n> endorsement actually looked like. I do not think it is appropriate to keep\n> the community in the dark about the actual totals.\n>\n> I am not seeking justification for the board that was selected.

It already has been acknowledged that\n> the process had its challenges and could be improved in the future, but\n> those of us out of the loop cannot help improve it without understanding the\n> facts about how it went.\n\nFrom email explaining to Matplotlib lead developer Tom Caswell what likely\ntranspired:\n\n> according to the minutes from August 27th - the advisory council provided 5\n> candidates recommended for positions on the board, and one to be added to\n> the advisory council. The Board met and did just that on the 29th:\n> https://numfocus.github.io/numfocus-board/2018/20180827/ But the advisory\n> council also recommended that the vote totals be released, and were left\n> with the impression that they would be. That's where things stood until the\n> board met to do the selection.

Trust is being eroded.\n\nSo that was how the election went down in 2018.\n\n### Resignations\n\nAll organizations evolve, and board membership changes are expected. But you\nmight be surprised to learn that two NumFOCUS board members resigned last\nyear. It's true, Noa Tamir and St\u00e9fan van der Walt resigned, I think in\nOctober. I'd point you to the board meeting minutes that documents this, to\nmake sure I had it right, but the board has not released meeting minutes for\nthe past 11 months,\n\nThose two weren't the only ones who've resigned in the past. Here is what some\nof the former board members had to say about their decision to step down.\n\nOne former board member explained :\n\n> I resigned, and what it came down to was that I could not put the time or\n> emotional energy into working to make NumFOCUS the organization I wanted it\n> to be, instead of the organization that it was... The conflict in NumFOCUS\n> between what I wanted (which is hard to narrow down, but I guess could come\n> back to the idea of the student researcher being a key audience) and what\n> would eventually make NumFOCUS more engaged with the communities with which\n> it was already familiar (i.e., \"data science,\" industry, etc) was getting\n> harder to navigate. ... So when I resigned, it was because I was overwhelmed\n> and not able to put in the effort that I wanted to -- but the reason I felt\n> like I had to put in so much effort was because I felt like the organization\n> was slipping further and further from what I wanted to see as its core\n> mission.\n\nAnother former board member wrote that :\n\n> When I was on the board, I and others talked with many people who we thought\n> had any kind of power to change things, and nothing changed. So this is not\n> the first time, or probably even the second.\n\nAnd when we video chatted added:\n\n> I left the board because I couldn't effect change.\n\nA third former board member wrote me that part of the reason for their\nresignation was that :\n\n> I and others on the board had grave concerns about performance, but that no\n> one seemed to be held accountable for that.\n\n## Paths forward and alternatives to NumFOCUS\n\nMy operating plan for making this post was to try to capture the various\nNumFOCUS transgressions as a way to illustrate why staying there is unlikely\nto work, given how many years and board members have churned through there,\nall while keeping the same executive director. Or that staying with NF will\nrequire a great deal of energy to keep the experience for individuals and\nprojects from going sideways further. But a concern I have is that, aside from\ncaring about the scientific-adjacent open source community, I don't actually\nhave a need for an alternative to NumFOCUS to exist. I do not have any grants\nand no plans to apply for grants, so I worry about trying to put in a bunch of\neffort to stand something up while the people who actually have the grants\nfigure out a better alternative for themselves (or just bite the bullet and\nstay with NF).\n\nIn responding to my email Rob Landley included this piece of wisdom:\n\n> Anyway, you don't \"fix\" stuff like this, the tree falls and a new tree grows\n> in its place from a sprout\n\nThere are those who think that trying to reform NumFOCUS is a lost cause.\nHere's someone who's given up on trying to influence NumFOCUS, but also saying\nthat it would be too much effort to create a new nonprofit.\n\n> NumFOCUS was founded to serve the needs of this community. I don't think\n> many of us have the appetite of going through that process again, and there\n> are options.\n\n  * Jupyter has proposed departing NumFOCUS to transition to The Linux Foundation for its fiscal sponsorship. Though I focused on LF being a 501c6 in the Linux Foundation: Voltron of Bureaucracy section above, turns out they also own and operate two 501c3 foundations: The Linux Kernel Organization and LF Charities. The latter is the one Jupyter proposes transferring to, though Jupyter also proposes forming a Jupyter Foundation 501c6. I have not participated in developing this proposal, it was researched and proposed by the Jupyter Executive Council.\n\n  * Some projects are looking into the Open Source Collective\n\n  * There's also Code for Science and Society\n\nSome of the people who asses a low probability of success for a NumFOCUS\nturnaround nevertheless also think that a more responsive NumFOCUS would be\nthe best outcome.\n\nYou can join the discussion on LinkedIn, Mastodon, Twitter (most of the\nresponses are on the LinkedIn post).\n\n  1.

I was deliberate here to apply the \"treacherous\" label to the action, not the people. Some are misinterpreting my words as \"calling the board treacherous\" \u2014 I am not. The distinction is akin to calling some act \"irresponsible\" without characterizing the people who err as \"irresponsible\". \u21a9\n\n  4.
