It is similar to the Lessig method, created\nby Harvard professor and former presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig.\n\nIt is named for its inventor, Masayoshi Takahashi. Unlike a typical\npresentation, no pictures and no charts are used. Only a few words are printed\non each slide\u2014often only one or two short words, using very large characters.\nTo make up for this, a presenter will use many more slides than in a\ntraditional presentation, each slide being shown for a much shorter duration.\n\n## Further information[edit]\n\nOnce Takahashi, a programmer, had to give a short presentation at a conference\n(RubyConf) so he first used the method and found it helpful, at least with\nJapanese. Takahashi never used PowerPoint or similar software; he uses only\ntext in his slides. He started thinking about how to use the best word for\neach slide as he took the audience through his presentation. The words or\nphrases resemble Japanese newspaper headlines rather than sentences which must\nbe read.\n\nThe slides use plain text in a visual manner, to help the audience quickly\nread and understand the material. It's said to be helpful with Japanese and\nother eastern languages which use non-Latin alphabets.\n\nMany presenters in developer conferences use their own variant on Takahashi.\nNotably, Audrey Tang's stock presentations at Perl and Open Source conferences\nuse this method.\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n  * Living large: \"Takahashi Method\" uses king-sized text as a visual\n  * Big \u2013 small JavaScript tool for making Takahashi-style presentations on the web\n  * Weenote \u2013 minimal JavaScript tool for making Takahashi-style presentations on the web\n  * takahashi.sty \u2013 package for making Takahashi-style presentation in Beamer (LaTeX)\n  * Slide \u2013 open-source Android application for making Takahashi-style presentations\n  * sent \u2013 open-source tool for Takahashi method, developed for Unix, and Unix-like operating systems by suckless.org.\n\nThis business-related article is a stub.
