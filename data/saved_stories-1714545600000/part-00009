It maps out how the classic psychedelics can be responsibly\nlegally regulated in a post-prohibition world, making concrete proposals for a\nfour-tiered regulatory framework:\n\n  * Private use, including home cultivation, foraging and not-for-profit sharing\n  * Membership-based not-for-profit associations\n  * Flexible licensing models for production and retail sale\n  * Regulation of commercial guided or supervised use\n\nDrawing on Transform\u2019s more than two decades of experience in global drug\npolicy analysis and advocacy, this guide sets out recommendations for\nestablishing a just and effective system of legal regulation, addressing\nchallenging questions in the debate including corporate capture mitigation,\nequity, Indigenous rights, psychedelic exceptionalism, and international\ntreaty law.\n\n\u201cOnce again Transform have come up with a well thought out and practical plan\nfor the regulation of another group of currently illegal drugs \u2014 in this case\npsychedelics. Their ideas would be both easy to implement and to engage with\nand will, if adopted, radically enhance the safe use of these remarkable\nagents\u201d Professor David Nutt, Scientific Chair of Drug Science\n\n\u201cThis is a timely and needed contribution to the growing debate on the future\nof psychedelic regulation. The number of jurisdictions making the move towards\npsychedelic reform will continue to grow and this guide provides answers to\nsome of the key questions on how to achieve it successfully. As a regulator, I\nvalue the resources and expertise Transform brings to these critical issues in\ndrug policy\u201d Dominique Mendiola, Senior Director, Colorado Marijuana\nEnforcement Division & Natural Medicine Division, Colorado Department of\nRevenue\n\nWe want all of our publications to be available for free, but they are not\nfree to produce.
