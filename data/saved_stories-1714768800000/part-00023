I implemented an Mixed Reality\nInterface for XR Headsets like the Meta Quest 3 (made with Godot) for\ncontrolling your Smart Home. While it is an experimental project, my goal is\nto also make this available for everybody to use and with this release I'm\nfinally at a point where I would say the experience is polished enough for\nmore people to try it out.\n\nImmersive Home connects to your Hub (currently Home Assistant) and enables you\nto interact with your devices in a completely new way. My motivation in\nbuilding this app was that controlling your Smart Home with your Smartphone\noften is tedious in that it takes a lot of time to start the app, find the\ndevice you're looking for and then finally changing the state to the desired\noutcome. Dashboards are often called as a solution to this problem, but they\ndon't fully solve the problem. You still have to remember where you placed\nwhat device in said dashboard, taking time to learn. This is especially\nproblematic when friends, children or elderly people want to interact with\nyour Smart Home using a Dashboard.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to map the virtual interfaces as naturally as\npossible to their physical counterpart. Meaning, if you want to control the\nblinds of a given window, you don't look for it inside an App or Dashboard,\nbut just look at the physical window directly. This has several benefits, most\nnotably also being able to simulate physical controls using hand tracking.\nMaking the interaction easy to comprehend and remember.\n\nThere are a lot more benefits I didn't go over in this post, but if you're\ninterested in learning more about the benefits of using Mixed Reality to\ncontrol your Smart Home, feel free to join our Discord for further discussion.\n\n## Whats new in this Release\n\nThis release completely revamps the User Interface, going for a more\nfuturistic approach and simpler design. Before buttons and other components\nfelt a lot out of place to me. By making the interface mores subtle,\ncomponents now feel more integrated into the surrounding environment and not\nas distracting.\n\nThe Mini View has also seen a few changes, notably adding interaction dots,\nallowing to interact with any device from any distance and doors. While it\nsounds trivial to have the option to draw doors into Immersive Home, until now\nthe app was lacking this feature.\n\n2 new entities made it into the release. The timer entity lets you interact\nwith a timer in Home Assistant, adding a handy tool in chase that you want to\nget a reminder when your cake is ready. The weather entity allows you to\npreview the weather forecast for the day which is handy when being placed next\nto your bed.\n\nThe last notable addition is the ability to resize the Mini View and Entities,\ngiving you more control in the appearance of your digital controls.\n\n### Changelog\n\n  * Improvements & UI Update by @Nitwel in https://github.com/Nitwel/Immersive-Home/pull/127\n  * Add search to edit menu and placeholder option for input by @Nitwel in https://github.com/Nitwel/Immersive-Home/pull/128\n  * Show Player in MiniView by @Nitwel in https://github.com/Nitwel/Immersive-Home/pull/129\n  * \ud83d\udeaaAdd Doors to Rooms by @Nitwel in https://github.com/Nitwel/Immersive-Home/pull/132\n  * Allow for resizing of the Mini View by @Nitwel in https://github.com/Nitwel/Immersive-Home/pull/133\n  * Allow for resizing entities by @Nitwel in https://github.com/Nitwel/Immersive-Home/pull/134\n  * Add Timer Entity by @Nitwel in https://github.com/Nitwel/Immersive-Home/pull/135\n  * Add Weather entity by @Nitwel in https://github.com/Nitwel/Immersive-Home/pull/13\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/Nitwel/Immersive-\nHome/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0\n\n5/2/2024\n\n\u00a9 Immersive Home\n\nImprintPrivacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
