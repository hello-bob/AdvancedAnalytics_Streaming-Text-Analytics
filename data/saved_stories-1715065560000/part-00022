(Appin has denied this.) A few\nweeks later, however, the story was taken down and replaced by an editor\u2019s\nnote saying that it had been \u201ctemporarily removed\u201d following an order issued\nby a district court in New Delhi. The order, Reuters said, was issued amid a\ncourt case that was originally brought against the news agency a year earlier.\nReuters said that its hacking-for-hire story was based on thousands of\ndocuments and interviews with hundreds of people, including cybersecurity\nfirms, adding that it stood by its reporting and planned to appeal. (Reuters\ndid not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast and other outlets, the initial lawsuit against\nReuters is part of a wider legal battle launched by Rajat Khare, a co-founder\nof Appin, and law firms including Clare Locke LLP, which boasts on its website\nabout its track record of \u201ckilling stories\u201d about its clients. The Daily Beast\nreported that references to Khare have been removed from a collaborative\ninvestigation between London\u2019s Sunday Times and the nonprofit Bureau of\nInvestigative Journalism; a news story published in Luxembourg; and a report\nfrom the Swiss national broadcaster. Semafor reported, meanwhile, that Clare\nLocke sent legal threats to The New Yorker about a story on India\u2019s hack-for-\nhire industry. (The New Yorker\u2019s story is still online; Khare\u2019s lawyer told\nSemafor that Khare \u201cdoes not comment on actual or alleged legal proceedings,\u201d\nbut does \u201cdefend himself judicially in all relevant jurisdictions against any\nattacks that target him and illegitimately damage his reputation.\u201d) Lawfare\nalso edited an article that it had published to remove details taken from the\nReuters report. And the Internet Archive, which had hosted a backup copy of\nthe Reuters story, has taken it down. (The story has been replaced with the\nmessage: \u201cthis URL has been excluded from the Wayback Machine.\u201d)\n\nFor Emma Best, the co-founder of a leak-hosting site called Distributed Denial\nof Secrets, or DDoSecrets, seeing Reuters remove its story reinforced her\ndesire to launch what would become the Greenhouse Project\u2014a special section of\nthe DDoSecrets site devoted to publishing and distributing news stories that\nhave been censored. DDoSecrets\u2014which in the past had a server seized in\nGermany and was once erroneously labeled a \u201ccriminal hacker group\u201d by the US\nDepartment of Homeland Security\u2014sees the Greenhouse Project as part of its\nbroader mission to ensure the free transmission of data in the public interest\nby making itself a \u201cpublisher of last resort.\u201d It chose the name because it\nhopes to create a \u201cwarming effect to reverse the chilling effects of\ncensorship.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters story (along with supporting documents) is the first entry in the\nproject, which launched last week, but Best said that it is just the tip of\nthe iceberg. (On the Appin front alone, she provided me with a list of almost\na dozen stories in various outlets that have either been edited to remove\nfacts about Appin or unpublished completely.) Recently, I spoke with Best\nabout the aims of DDoSecrets, the launch of the Greenhouse Project, and why\nshe hopes it becomes redundant. What follows is a transcript of our\ndiscussion, which was conducted via the messaging app Signal and has been\nedited for length and clarity.\n\nMI: So the removal of the Reuters story sparked your interest in hosting this\nmaterial at DDoSecrets?\n\nEB: The Reuters story had caught my eye before it was taken down; it\u2019s part of\na series of reports that I thought were important to begin with. It was\nupsetting to see it just removed like that (though I don\u2019t blame Reuters for\ndoing what they had to do). Seeing Reuters\u2019s piece get taken down\u2014and\nespecially all the secondary reporting that was censored, too\u2014really\ndemonstrated that something like this was needed.\n\nSign up for CJR's daily email\n\nCan you give us a little background on DDoSecrets, what it does, and how it\ncame to be?\n\nDDoSecrets is a little over five years old, launched in December 2018. We\u2019ve\npublished over a hundred million leaked files provided by our sources, and we\nhave a lot more that we\u2019re still working on. We use a mixed distribution\nmodel, publishing information both to the general public and restricting some\ninformation to journalists and researchers when there\u2019s a lot of sensitive\ninformation. Some of these cases contain ten million files, so adequately\nreviewing and redacting that just isn\u2019t possible. Along with individual media\noutlets, we\u2019ve collaborated with organizations like the Platform to Protect\nWhistleblowers in Africa, the International Consortium of Investigative\nJournalists, and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. In\n2020, we were recognized as a 501c3 [charitable organization]. A few of our\nmore notable publications are listed on the site.\n\nCan I assume that, much like WikiLeaks, this kind of thing hasn\u2019t made you\nvery popular with governments and other entities?\n\nWe\u2019re banned by Indonesia and Russia, as well as by Twitter and Reddit. You\nstill can\u2019t post our URL on Twitter at all, and any post on Reddit with it is\nshadowbanned [downranked so it is difficult to find and can\u2019t be shared]. I\u2019m\nnot sure why exactly; I found out about it last year when The Intercept\nreported it. A subreddit dedicated to BlueLeaks [a DDoS project in 2020 that\npublished almost three hundred gigabytes of internal US law enforcement\ndocuments] was banned; I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if [the shadowbanning] happened\nthen, but I don\u2019t have any \u201creceipts\u201d [proof]. Last year, the Department of\nDefense asked us to remove the Pentagon leaks but we basically just ignored\nthem.\n\nHow is DDoSecrets funded?\n\nThe first year or two, it was mostly out of pocket. We took some Bitcoin\ndonations; I think one big one that helped for a while, but things were\nminimal enough for the first year or so that it wasn\u2019t too bad. Now it\u2019s all\ndonations. We have DonorBox and OpenCollective, we get a little bit through\nSubstack, but I think we\u2019re going to move away from that entirely [because of\nthe platform\u2019s decision to host Nazi and white supremacist content]. We have a\nfew crypto options, but we don\u2019t exactly appeal to the NFT and crypto crowd.\n\nIn 2021, we got a grant from [the Calyx Institute, a nonprofit focused on\ndigital security], but we\u2019re pretty chronically broke. I think we have maybe\nten thousand dollars on hand, give or take. Right now only two of us are paid,\neveryone else is a volunteer. We both work on this full-time, but our salary\nis less than the equivalent of minimum wage. I make four hundred dollars per\nweek before taxes. We\u2019re trying to get funding from outside groups, but so far\nthat hasn\u2019t been successful. One foundation said they\u2019d reimburse us for some\nconferences and travel; that was the only reason we did it, but we were never\nreimbursed. Probably our biggest source of funding was the Calyx grant.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s not a lot of money (or recognition) in publishing, and\na lot of big funders aren\u2019t attracted by the idea of people who have leaked\n(or could leak) the secrets of their friends.\n\nWhat are your plans if DDoSecrets gets sued by Khare or someone else over the\ncensored stories it publishes?\n\nWe\u2019re not going to pre-litigate anything, but it\u2019s worth noting that we have\nno people or physical presence in India. And the files and the article have\nboth been made into a torrent [a file that can be easily shared] that can\u2019t\nreally be censored. Even if it\u2019s somehow removed from our servers, we couldn\u2019t\ntake it back if we wanted to. As I recall, the Los Angeles Police Department\nfiled a lawsuit [in which it tried to retract some documents that were\nreleased through the Freedom of Information Act, which DDoSecrets published]\nbut never even bothered to include DDoSecrets or go after us in any way. As\nfor where it\u2019s hosted, our domain is registered through a company in Iceland.\nThe wiki [the site runs on software similar to Wikipedia] is kept separate\nfrom everything else for security reasons.\n\nWill DDoSecrets be adding other censored reporting to the Greenhouse Project?\n\nI\u2019d like this project to not have to be expanded. If it\u2019s never needed again,\nthat would be best for everyone. We say internally a lot that we\u2019d love for\nDDoSecrets to be made obsolete by some change in the world\u2014either some\nincrease in transparency, or some other organization improving on the model in\nsome way. But as long as the need is there....\n\nOther notable stories:\n\n  * Yesterday, a hundred days into his tenure as CEO of CNN, Mark Thompson revealed more about his plans for the network in a memo to staff. Thompson called on staffers to recapture \u201csome of the swagger and innovation\u201d of CNN\u2019s early years as it adapts to sharp challenges and changing consumption patterns in the TV business, and also confirmed that Alex MacCallum\u2014a media executive with deep experience in digital transformation, including working alongside Thompson at the New York Times\u2014will return to CNN, where she formerly worked, following a brief spell at the Washington Post. Beyond that, Thompson\u2019s memo offered \u201clittle granular detail,\u201d Oliver Darcy, CNN\u2019s media reporter, noted. (In other news, CNN formally canceled a GOP debate ahead of the New Hampshire primary after Donald Trump and Nikki Haley declined to take part.)\n  * Also yesterday, Cond\u00e9 Nast announced that Pitchfork, the spiky music site, will be folded into the men\u2019s magazine GQ; as part of the transition, an unspecified number of staffers will be laid off, including Puja Patel, Pitchfork\u2019s editor in chief. Anna Wintour, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s chief content officer, cast the merger as a step toward consolidating the company\u2019s music coverage, but many media-watchers were puzzled by\u2014if not openly scathing of\u2014the move given the two publications\u2019 starkly different sensibilities and brands; Amanda Petrusich, who covers music for The New Yorker and noted that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t have a career\u201d without Pitchfork, wrote that the news \u201cfeels like a death knell for the record review as a form.\u201d Pitchfork\u2019s union also condemned the merger.\n  * Meanwhile, the union representing staffers at the LA Times warned overnight that \u201canother major round of layoffs\u201d could be imminent at the paper, which already cut dozens of positions last year. The news follows the abrupt recent resignation of Kevin Merida, the executive editor, amid reported tensions with Patrick Soon-Shiong, the paper\u2019s owner, including over business matters. In the wake of his departure, Merida has widely been praised within the media industry, including among LA Times staffers\u2014but The Objective\u2019s Brandon Pho reports that some staffers did not perceive his tenure so positively, including in his handling of last year\u2019s cuts and other employment matters.\n  * Earlier this week, a clutch of reporters and commentators condemned the Biden administration\u2019s response to a story, by HuffPost\u2019s Akbar Shahid Ahmed, reporting on internal divisions over a potential plan for the reconstruction of Gaza; the White House initially declined to comment, but after the story gained traction, a spokesperson for the National Security Council called it untrue and suggested that Ahmed had fabricated quotes. At a briefing yesterday, John Kirby, the NSC\u2019s chief spokesperson, partly walked back that statement, saying that the NSC hadn\u2019t intended to question Ahmed\u2019s ethics.\n  * And for CJR, Umar Farooq remembers Bilal Jadallah, a \u201cfather figure\u201d for many journalists in Gaza who was killed in an Israeli attack in November. A decade earlier, Jadallah founded Press House, a media center and \u201ckind of sanctuary\u201d for domestic and foreign reporters, Farooq writes. Jadallah believed \u201cthat with an independent space to train and foster journalists he could build up a proper, professional media landscape in Gaza\u201d\u2014one that would \u201chelp improve Palestinian society overall.\u201d\n\nICYMI: Hiba Morgan on Sudan\u2019s forgotten war\n\nMathew Ingram is CJR\u2019s chief digital writer. Previously, he was a senior\nwriter with Fortune magazine. He has written about the intersection between\nmedia and technology since the earliest days of the commercial internet.
