after\ndriving 18-wheeler onstage\n\nPublished Wed, Apr 17 20248:30 AM EDT\n\nJordan Novet@jordannovet\n\nAnnie Palmer@in/annierpalmer/\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Less than eight years after introducing the Snowmobile at its Reinvent conference in Las Vegas, Amazon has taken the 18-wheeler out of service.\n  * Amazon Web Services designed the semi to help customers move large amounts of data to the cloud.\n  * A page on the AWS website devoted to products for large-scale data migration no longer mentions the Snowmobile.\n\nAmazon Web Services Snowmobile Truck\n\nCNBC\n\nAt Amazon\u2019s annual cloud conference in 2016, the company captured the crowd\u2019s\nattention by driving an 18-wheeler onstage. Andy Jassy, now Amazon\u2019s CEO,\ncalled it the Snowmobile, and said the company would be using the truck to\nhelp customers speedily transfer data to Amazon Web Services facilities.\n\nLess than eight years later, the semi is out of commission.\n\nAs of March, AWS had removed Snowmobile from its website, and the Amazon unit\nhas stopped offering the service, CNBC has confirmed. The webpage devoted to\nAWS\u2019 \u201cSnow family\u201d of products now directs users to its other data transport\nservices, including the Snowball Edge, a 50-pound suitcase-sized device that\ncan be equipped with fast solid-state drives, and the smaller Snowcone.\n\nAn AWS spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the company has\nintroduced more cost-effective options for moving data. Clients had to deal\nwith power, cooling, networking, parking and security when they used the\nSnowmobile service, the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cSince we introduced Snowmobile in 2016, we\u2019ve released many other new\nservices and features which have made migrating data to AWS even faster and\neasier for our customers,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nAn AWS Snowmobile truck appears in a Seattle parking lot in 2019.\n\nAndrew Evers | CNBC\n\nSnowmobile was priced at $0.005 gigabytes per month, not including other\ncosts, according to a page formerly on the AWS website. For a company with 100\npetabytes of data \u2014 the capacity of a Snowmobile \u2014 a transfer job would cost\nabout $500,000 per month.\n\nAmazon\u2019s decision to axe Snowmobile comes as Jassy implements cost cuts across\nthe company to contend with lackluster sales growth. Amazon has slashed more\nthan 27,000 jobs since late 2022 and has discontinued projects in the devices\nand retail units. The cuts have continued this year, with Amazon laying off\nhundreds of jobs in AWS earlier this month.\n\nWhile it\u2019s fairly routine for AWS and rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud\nPlatform to get rid of products and services, the elimination of Snowmobile\nstands out due to the splashy way it was introduced at the company\u2019s showcase\nReinvent conference in Las Vegas in late 2016.\n\nJassy, who at the time led AWS, was delivering his keynote before tens of\nthousands of people in the crowd, when the 18-wheeler joined him on stage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need a bigger box,\u201d Jassy said, as audience members rushed to\nraise their smartphones to capture photos of the spectacle.\n\nJassy told the crowd why the truck was groundbreaking. Over a 10 gigabit-per-\nsecond connection, it would take 26 years to move an exabyte, or 1 million\nterabytes, of data to the cloud, he said. An AWS customer could do the job\nwith 10 Snowmobiles in under six months, he said. Each Snowmobile had a\ncapacity of 100 petabytes on hard disk drives.\n\nIn a blog post coinciding with the launch on Nov. 30, 2016, Amazon cloud\nevangelist Jeff Barr described Snowmobile as \u201ca ruggedized, tamper-resistant\nshipping container 45 feet long, 9.6 feet high, and 8 feet wide\u201d that \u201ccan be\nparked in a covered or uncovered area adjacent to your existing data center.\u201d\n\nBarr helped to convey the supposed simplicity of the process with photos of a\nSnowmobile built out of Lego getting connected to a corporate data center.\n\n\u201cWe intend to make sure that Snowmobile is both faster and less expensive than\nusing a network-based data transfer model,\u201d Barr wrote.\n\nBut the product didn\u2019t take off.\n\nA spokesperson for satellite operator Maxar said the company used Snowmobile\nonce in 2017 to move more than 100 petabytes to AWS from its own servers.\n\n\u201cSince then, we have been uploading our imagery and associated data directly\nto the cloud,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAWS still leads the giant cloud infrastructure market and generated $90.8\nbillion in revenue last year, accounting for 16% of Amazon\u2019s total sales. The\ncompany\u2019s spokesperson said AWS\u2019 Snowball Edge devices, which clients can\nreturn to Amazon by mail after filling them up with data, are smaller than the\nSnowmobile vehicles, cost less and have a shorter turnaround time.\n\nThere\u2019s also the AWS DataSync service for moving data, announced in 2018.\nClients generally find that sending data to AWS online is more economical than\nusing Snowmobile, the company said.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more proud of the value that Snowmobile has brought to\ncustomers, and we\u2019re pleased to see them choosing newer, more efficient\ntechnologies,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Wednesday\u2019s analyst calls: Tesla price target cuts, GE spinoff to pop more than 20%\n  * If you\u2019re worried about a correction and over-invested in Nvidia, replace it with these steady growth stocks instead\n  * It may be time for investors to sell Nvidia on the next bounce, according to the charts\n  * Wall Street is bullish on copper, thanks to AI.
