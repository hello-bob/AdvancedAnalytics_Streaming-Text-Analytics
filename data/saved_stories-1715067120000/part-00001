Log in or Join now .\n\nKoch, who first rose to prominence for his collaborative work with the late\nNobel Laureate Francis Crick, is hardly the only scientist to ponder the\nnature of the self\u2014but he is perhaps the most adventurous, both in body and\nmind. He sees consciousness as the central mystery of our universe, and is\nwilling to explore any reasonable idea in the search for an explanation.\n\nOver the years, Koch has toyed with a wide array of ideas, some of them\ndistinctly speculative\u2014like the idea that the Internet might become conscious,\nfor example, or that with sufficient technology, multiple brains could be\nfused together, linking their accompanying minds along the way. (And yet, he\ndoes have his limits: He\u2019s deeply skeptical both of the idea that we can\n\u201cupload\u201d our minds and of the \u201csimulation hypothesis.\u201d)\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIn his new book, Then I Am Myself The World, Koch, currently the chief\nscientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, ventures\nthrough the challenging landscape of integrated information theory (IIT), a\nframework that attempts to compute the amount of consciousness in a system\nbased on the degree to which information is networked. Along the way, he\nstruggles with what may be the most difficult question of all: How do our\nthoughts\u2014seemingly ethereal and without mass or any other physical\nproperties\u2014have real-world consequences? We caught up with him recently over\nZoom.\n\nTHE SELF: In his new book, neuroscientist Christof Koch grapples with the\ncomplexity of consciousness. Photo courtesy of Allen Institute.\n\nIn your new book, you ask how the mind can influence matter. Are we any closer\nto answering that question today than when Descartes posited it nearly four\ncenturies ago?\n\nLet\u2019s step back. Western philosophy of mind revolves around two poles, the\nphysical and the mental\u2014think of them like the north and the south pole.\nThere\u2019s materialism, which is now known as physicalism, which says that only\nphysical really exists, and there is no mental; it\u2019s all an illusion, like\nDaniel Dennett and others have said.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThen there\u2019s idealism, which is now enjoying a mini-renaissance, but by and\nlarge has not been popular in the 20th and early 21st century, which says that\neverything fundamentally is a manifestation of the mental.\n\nThen there is classical dualism, which says, well, there\u2019s clearly physical\nmatter and there\u2019s the mental, and they somehow have to interact. It\u2019s been\nchallenging to understand how the mental interacts with the physical\u2014that\u2019s\nknown as the causation problem.\n\nAnd then there are other things like panpsychism, that\u2019s now becoming very\npopular again, which is a very ancient faith. It says that fundamentally\neverything is \u201censouled\u201d\u2014that everything, even elementary particles, feel a\nlittle bit like something.\n\nAll of these different positions have problems. Physicalism remains a dominant\nphilosophy, particularly in Western philosophy departments and big tech.\nPhysicalism says that everything fundamentally is physical, and you can\nsimulate it\u2014this is called \u201ccomputational functionalism.\u201d The problem is that,\nso far, people have been unable to explain consciousness, because it\u2019s so\ndifferent from the physical.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> It may be that a little bacterium feels a little bit like something.\n\nWhat does integrated information theory say about consciousness?\n\nIIT says, fundamentally, what exists is consciousness. And consciousness is\nthe only thing that exists for itself. You are conscious. Tonight, you\u2019re\ngoing to go into a deep sleep at some point, and then you\u2019re not conscious\nanymore; then you do not exist for yourself. Your body and your brain still\nhave an existence for others\u2014I can see your body there\u2014but you don\u2019t exist for\nyourself. So only consciousness exists for itself; that\u2019s absolute existence.\nEverything else is derivative.\n\nIt says consciousness ultimately is causal power upon itself\u2014the ability to\nmake a difference. And now you\u2019re looking for a substrate\u2014like a brain or\ncomputer CPU or anything. Then the theory says, whatever your conscious\nexperience is\u2014what it feels like to see red, or to smell Limburger cheese, or\nto have a particular type of toothache\u2014maps one-to-one onto this structure,\nthis form, this causal relationship. It\u2019s not a process. It\u2019s not a\ncomputation. It\u2019s very different from all other theories.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWhen you use this term \u201ccausal powers,\u201d how is it different from an ordinary\ncause-and-effect chain of events? Like if you\u2019re playing billiards, you hit\nthe cue ball, and the cue ball hits the eight ball ...\n\nIt\u2019s nothing woo-woo. It\u2019s the ability of a system, let\u2019s say a billiard ball,\nto make a difference. In other words, if it gets hit by another ball, it\nmoves, and that has an effect in the world.\n\nAnd IIT says you have a system\u2014a bunch of wires or neurons\u2014and it\u2019s the extent\nto which they have causal power upon themselves. You\u2019re always looking for the\nmaximum causal power that the system can have on itself. That is ultimately\nwhat consciousness is. It\u2019s something very concrete. If you give me a\nmathematical description of a system, I can compute it, it\u2019s not some ethereal\nthing.\n\nSo it can be objectively measured from the outside?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThat\u2019s correct.\n\nBut of course there was the letter last year that was signed by 124 scientists\nclaiming that integrated information theory is pseudoscience, partly on the\ngrounds, they said, that it isn\u2019t testable.\n\nMany years ago, I organized a meeting in Seattle, where we came together and\nplanned an \u201cadversarial collaboration.\u201d It was specifically focused on\nconsciousness. The idea was: Let\u2019s take two theories of consciousness\u2014in this\ncase, integrated information theory versus the other dominant one, global\nneuronal workspace theory. Let\u2019s get people in a room to discuss\u2014yes, they\nmight disagree on many things\u2014but can we agree on an experiment that can\nsimultaneously test predictions from the two theories, and where we agree\nahead of time, in writing: If the outcome is A it supports theory A; if it\u2019s\nB, it supports theory B? It involved 14 different labs.\n\nThe experiments were trying to predict where the \u201cneural footprints of\nconsciousness,\u201d crudely speaking, are. Are they in the back of the brain, as\nintegrated information theory asserts, or in the front of the brain, as global\nneuronal workspace asserts? And the outcome was very clear\u2014two of the three\nexperiments were clearly against the prefrontal cortex and in favor of the\nneural footprint of conscious being in the back.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> It\u2019s not my brain that sees; it\u2019s consciousness that sees.\n\nThis provoked an intense backlash in the form of this letter, where it was\nclaimed the theory is untestable, which I think is just baloney. And then, of\ncourse, there was blowback against the blowback, because people said, wait,\nIIT may be wrong\u2014the theory is certainly very different from the dominant\nideology\u2014but it\u2019s certainly a scientific theory; it makes some very precise\npredictions.\n\nBut it has a different metaphysics. And people don\u2019t like this.\n\nMost people today believe that if you can simulate something, that\u2019s all you\nneed to do. If a computer can simulate the human brain, then of course [the\nsimulation is] going to be conscious. And LLMs\u2014sooner or later [in the\nfunctionalist view] they\u2019re going to be conscious\u2014it\u2019s just a question of, is\nit conscious today, or do you need some more clever algorithm?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIIT says, no, it\u2019s not about simulating; it\u2019s not about doing\u2014it\u2019s ultimately\nabout being, and for that, really, you have to look at the hardware in order\nto say whether it\u2019s conscious or not.\n\nDoes IIT involve a commitment to panpsychism?\n\nIt\u2019s not panpsychism. Panpsychism says, \u201cthis table is conscious\u201d or \u201cthis\nfork is conscious.\u201d Panpsychism says, fundamentally, everything is imbued with\nboth physical properties as well as mental properties. So an atom has both\nmental and physical properties.\n\nIIT says, no, that\u2019s certainly not true. Only things that have causal power\nupon themselves [are conscious]\u2014this table doesn\u2019t have any causal power upon\nitself; it just doesn\u2019t do anything, it just sits there.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nBut it shares some intuitions [with panpsychism]\u2014in particular, that\nconscience is on a gradient, and that maybe even a comparatively simple\nsystem, like a bacterium\u2014already a bacterium contains a billion proteins,\n[there\u2019s] immense causal interaction\u2014it may well be that this little bacterium\nfeels a little bit like something. Nothing like us, or even the consciousness\nof a dog. And when it dies, let\u2019s say, when you\u2019re given antibiotics and its\nmembrane dissolves, then it doesn\u2019t feel like anything anymore.\n\nA scientific theory has to rest on its on its predictive power. And if the\npredictive power says, yes, consciousness is much wider than we think\u2014it\u2019s not\nonly us and maybe the great apes; maybe it\u2019s throughout the animal kingdom,\nmaybe throughout the tree of life\u2014well, then, so be it.\n\nToward the end of the book, you write, \u201cI decide, not my neurons.\u201d I can\u2019t\nhelp thinking that that\u2019s two ways of saying the same thing\u2014on the macro level\nit\u2019s \u201cme,\u201d but on the micro level, it\u2019s my neurons. Or am I missing something?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s a subtle difference. What truly exists for itself is your\nconsciousness. When you\u2019re unconscious, as in a deep sleep on anesthesia, you\ndon\u2019t exist for yourself anymore, and you\u2019re unable to make any decisions. And\nso what truly exists is consciousness, and that\u2019s where the true action\nhappens.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nI actually see you on the screen, there are lights in the image; inside my\nbrain, I can assure you, there are no lights, it\u2019s totally dark. My brain is\njust in a goo. So it\u2019s not my brain that sees; it\u2019s consciousness that sees.\nIt\u2019s not my brain that makes a decision, it\u2019s my consciousness that makes a\ndecision. They\u2019re not the same.\n\n> You can simulate a rainstorm, but it never gets wet inside the computer.\n\nFor as long as we\u2019ve had computers, people have argued about whether the brain\nis an information processor of some kind. You\u2019ve argued that it isn\u2019t. From\nthat perspective, I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t think large language models have\ncausal powers.\n\nCorrect. In fact, I can pretty confidently make the following statement:\nThere\u2019s no Turing test for consciousness, according to IIT, because it\u2019s not\nabout a function; it\u2019s all about this causal structure. So you actually have\nto look at the CPU or the chip\u2014whatever does the computation. You have to look\nat that level: What\u2019s the causal power?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nNow you can of course simulate perfectly well a human brain doing everything a\nhuman brain can do\u2014there\u2019s no problem conceptually, at least. And of course, a\ncomputer simulation will one day say, \u201cI\u2019m conscious,\u201d like many large\nlanguage models do, unless they have guardrails where they explicitly tell you\n\u201cOh no, I\u2019m just an LLM\u2014I\u2019m not conscious,\u201d because they don\u2019t want to scare\nthe public.\n\nBut that\u2019s all simulation; that\u2019s not actually being conscious. Just like you\ncan simulate a rainstorm, but it never gets wet inside the computer, funnily\nenough, even though it simulated a rainstorm. You can solve Einstein\u2019s\nequation of general relativity for a black hole, but you never have to be\nafraid that you\u2019re going to be sucked into your computer simulation. Why not?\nIf it really computes gravity, then shouldn\u2019t spacetime bend around my\ncomputer and suck me, and the computer, in? No, because it\u2019s a simulation.\nThat\u2019s the difference between the real and the simulated. The simulated\ndoesn\u2019t have the same causal powers as the real.\n\nSo unless you build a machine in the image of a human brain\u2014let\u2019s say using\nneuromorphic engineering, possibly using quantum computers\u2014then you can\u2019t get\nhuman-level consciousness. If you just build them like we build them right\nnow, where one transistor talks to two or three other transistors\u2014that\u2019s\nradically different from the connectivity of the human brain\u2014you\u2019ll never get\nconsciousness. So I can confidently say that although LLMs very soon will be\nable to do everything we can do, and probably faster and better than we can\ndo, they will never be conscious.\n\nSo in this view, it\u2019s not \u201clike anything\u201d to be a large language model,\nwhereas it might be like something to be a mouse or a lizard, for example?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nCorrect. It is like something to be a mouse. It\u2019s not like anything to be an\nLLM\u2014although the LLM is vastly more intelligent, in any technical sense, than\nthe mouse.\n\nYet somewhat ironically, the LLM can say \u201cHello there, I\u2019m conscious,\u201d which\nthe mouse cannot do.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so seductive, because it can speak to us, and express itself\nvery eloquently. But it\u2019s a gigantic vampire\u2014it sucks up all of human\ncreativity, throws it into its network, and then spits it out again. There\u2019s\nno one home there. It doesn\u2019t feel like anything to be an LLM.\n\nLead image: chaiyapruek youprasert / Shutterstock\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
