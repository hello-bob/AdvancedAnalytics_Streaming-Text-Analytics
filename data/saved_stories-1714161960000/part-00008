ConsumentenClaim and the Aequitas\nBelangenbehartiging Foundation announced this week they were moving ahead with\na case against Apple.\n\nApple released several updates for the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7\nPlus, and the first generation of SE models in 2017 and 2018. These updates\nweakened the quality level of the smartphones and sought to conceal underlying\ndefects in the batteries used. This made the iPhones slower, and they did not\nwork as well as before the update.\n\nApple did not inform its users about this. Therefore, consumers suffered\ndamages caused by the slower speed, worse functionality, and lesser quality of\nthe iPhones, the organizations claimed. Many consumers felt they had no other\nchoice but to replace the battery or the iPhone.\n\n\"We think that Apple is guilty of unfair trade practices due to the deliberate\nslowing down of iPhones,\" said Stef Smith, director of ConsumentenClaim. The\nclaim organization is holding Apple responsible and wants compensation of 100\neuros per device. The people who replaced their iPhones due to the unfair\npractices could receive a higher amount of compensation.\n\nApple reached an agreement regarding this case in the United States for 613\nmillion dollars, or roughly 572 million euros. This amounted to damages of 92\ndollars, or 86 euros, per customer who joined the suit.\n\nA fine of 25 million euros was issued in France, and a 10 million euro fine\nwas confirmed by the court in Italy. There are also mass claims in other\ncountries against Apple.\n\nReporting by ANP\n\n## Follow us:\n\n## Latest stories\n\n  * Wilders to speak about \"conservative connection\" as guest of honor at CPAP in Hungary\n\n  * Open letter against anti-Semitism signed by 329 of 342 mayors of Dutch cities\n\n  * Sinterklaasjournaal presenter stops TV work; Needs nose amputation due to cancer\n\n  * Chilly & mostly dry King's Night ahead of a warm King's Day; Chance of showers tomorrow\n\n  * Third-country nationals from Ukraine can stay for now, State Secretary says\n\n  * CVC, investment fund behind Lipton and Douglas, going public in Amsterdam today\n\n## Top stories\n\n  * Busy roads, airports today as start of May vacation coincides with King's Night\n\n  * PSV could become national champions on May 5\n\n  * Parliament wants 25 April to be national day against anti-Semitism\n\n  * Parliament majority votes for affordable rent law, passing by wide majority\n\n  * Health insurance deductible could be slashed by parties in Cabinet formation talks\n\n  * Ajax to keep Alex Kroes despite insider trading scandal, but won\u2019t be CEO\n\n\u00a9 2012-2024, NL Times, All rights reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
