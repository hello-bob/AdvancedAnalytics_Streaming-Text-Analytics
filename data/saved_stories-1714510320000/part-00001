Meat, eggs, and dairy\u2014which at various points in\nhistory have been scarce, expensive, or contaminated,\u2014are now common,\naffordable, and safe.\n\nAn unintended consequence of this abundance, however, is a severe reduction in\nthe welfare of animals within this supply chain. Modern animal agriculture\nhardly resembles our bucolic ideals of happy animals grazing in a field,\nproducing eggs and milk for their owners in exchange for care and protection,\nand then donating their bodies at the end of their lives. Instead, it has\ndeveloped in similar ways to modern industrial manufacturing, with every step\nof the process heavily optimized for economic efficiency. Most accommodations\nfor animals\u2019 well-being that don\u2019t align with profit incentives are competed\naway.\n\nPossible responses to the resulting decrease in welfare include eschewing\nanimal products altogether or leaning into the small-scale farming practices\ndescribed above. However, these solutions are not the most likely, feasible,\nor scalable. They are akin to calling for degrowth as a solution to climate\nchange. A better solution would be to embrace technology, which could create\nthe possibility of a more humane equilibrium.\n\nFertilized eggs going through an MRI-based in-ovo sexing circuit, developed by\nOrbem.

Poultry accounts for 96 percent of land animals eaten by\nAmericans, mainly because these animals are so small relative to other animals\nthat are commonly consumed, such as pigs or cows. Broiler chickens weigh\nslightly more than six pounds on average, whereas a modern beef cow weighs\nmore than 1,400 pounds.\n\nTheir small size, however, makes it more difficult to ensure the welfare of\neach individual chicken on a farm. Some poultry facilities in the U.S. house\nover five million chickens, whereas the largest cow feedlots rarely break\n100,000. With that many animals on site, even the most competent operators\nstruggle to guarantee that each one is free from hunger, thirst, pain, injury,\nor disease.\n\nFortunately, technology excels in areas where scalability is the key\nchallenge. An example of how technology is positively shaping the poultry\nsector is at the interface between the hatchery, where chicks are born, and\nthe farm, where they live out their lives. Here, a trio of technologies\u2014in-ovo\nsexing, on-farm hatching, and in-ovo vaccination\u2014hold the potential to make\nthe poultry sector both more efficient and better for chicken welfare. All\nthree of these technologies remove the need to handle and process live chicks\non the day they\u2019re born, instead allowing poultry producers to work with\nunhatched fertilized eggs. The hatchery of the future that adopts all three\ncan forgo handling live animals entirely. But before we can learn how these\ntechnologies work, it is necessary to understand why they are needed in the\nfirst place.\n\n## The Current State of Farm-to-Table\n\nGlobally, we slaughter more than 80 billion land animals annually and catch\nand kill one trillion fish. These numbers rise each year as economic\nprosperity and food security increase. The vast majority of animals are sold\ninto commodity markets where welfare accommodations that increase cost face\nimmense competitive pressure.\n\nEven if businesses want to do things better, the realities of markets have led\nto some shocking practices. A poll conducted by the social science research\nfirm, Bryant Research, asked respondents whether they rated various standard\nagricultural practices as \u201cAcceptable\u201d or \u201cNot acceptable.\u201d 86.8 percent of\nrespondents believed that beak trimming (the practice of cutting off the tips\nof each chick\u2019s beak so they are less capable of injuring each other while\nstressed on the farm) is not acceptable, and 84.5 percent of respondents\nbelieved maceration (killing day-old chicks by grinding them up alive) is not\nacceptable.\n\nWhile this may seem strange given how seldom farm animal welfare is talked\nabout, favorable attitudes towards it are actually a consistent and\nreproducible finding that spans the political divide. A recent YouGov poll,\nfor example, showed animal rights as the fourth most supported political cause\n(behind free speech, religious freedom, and racial equality), and second least\nopposed cause (only behind free speech).\n\nAnother somewhat surprising finding from social science literature is that\nalmost half of consumers support \u201cbanning slaughterhouses,\u201d a measure that\nwould make meat almost completely inaccessible. Naturally, these results are\nhighly determined by the framing of the question, but the consistency with\nwhich people express pro-welfare views points to a growing cultural shift.\nAlthough animal welfare is often considered a niche issue, there is widely\nspread public concern over the way farm animals are raised and the moral price\nwe\u2019ve paid for the abundance of our food.\n\nNowhere is the price for this abundance clearer than in the poultry industry.\nEvery two years, more chickens are slaughtered than the number of humans that\nhave ever lived. And with numbers this large, even small improvements in the\naverage welfare of chickens have a substantial cumulative effect.\n\nA great place to direct these improvements is at a chicken\u2019s first few days of\nlife, which are particularly challenging. The poultry supply chain begins with\nlarge genetics companies that maintain closely guarded, purebred lines of\nchickens. These animals are genetically optimized to produce food as\nefficiently as possible. Some genetics companies sell \u201clayers,\u201d optimized for\negg production. Others sell \u201cbroilers,\u201d which are optimized for the production\nof meat. The performance difference between these breeds is why chicken meat\nand eggs are so cheap today. In the 1950s, a typical chicken would lay about\n150 eggs per year; modern layers can lay twice that number. Modern broilers\ncan grow to be over four times the weight of a natural chicken in only 6-7\nweeks.\n\nTo create a new flock of chickens, fertilized eggs are harvested from a\nbreeding farm and transported to \u201chatcheries,\u201d which are large facilities\noutfitted with incubators that tightly control temperature, humidity, and CO_2\nlevels around the developing eggs. Modern incubators also tilt eggs back and\nforth to prevent the developing embryo from settling on the bottom of the egg,\na role normally fulfilled by a nesting mother hen.\n\nAt the end of the 21-day incubation period, the eggs begin to hatch. The\n\u201chatching window,\u201d which refers to the time between the earliest and latest\nhatching chicks, can be up to 48 hours. During this time, newborn chicks are\nkept inside the incubator, which is far darker, noisier, and dustier than any\nnatural environment would be. They generally don\u2019t have access to food or\nwater during this time and subsist, instead, on their remaining yolk sac.\n\nOnce most of the eggs have hatched, chicks are removed from the incubator and\nthen passed through a series of \u201cprocessing\u201d steps. One of the most important\nof these is sorting by sex, which is traditionally done by a skilled laborer\nwho picks up and examines each chick by hand. Layer chicks are sorted to\nremove males, which cannot produce eggs. Genetic specialization between layer\nand broiler chickens means that layers are scrawnier and thus cannot be\neconomically raised for meat. It follows that male chicks are unprofitable\nand, thus, are killed immediately, usually via maceration.\n\nFor broiler chicks, sexing serves a different purpose. Male and female\nbroilers are both used for meat, but males generally grow to be slightly\nheavier. Separate sex rearing helps farmers meet strict requirements around\nthe target weight of the birds by increasing the uniformity in slaughter\nweights within each single-sex flock.\n\nOther processing steps may include vaccination and beak trimming. Each\nprocessing step requires handling by a human, which itself has been shown to\ncause substantial stress for newborn chicks.\n\nThe final step is transportation to the farm, which is another serious\nchallenge for animal welfare. Trucks are designed to transport as many animals\nas possible and so often lack food, water, or climate control. Transport times\nare regularly more than 24 hours without breaks, and in unfavorable climates,\nthis can be deadly. According to reporting in The Guardian, 20 million\nchickens die during transport each year in the United States\n\nEven if companies try to prioritize welfare within this process, the reality\nis that poor management can sometimes lead to tragic cruelty and neglect.\nUndercover investigations conducted by animal rights organizations at\nhatcheries have found that sometimes chicks are accidentally crushed by\nmechanized processing equipment, or drown in scalding water from a cleaning\nmachine. It\u2019s difficult to incentivize better management since third-party\nanimal welfare certifications, such as Certified Humane or Global Animal\nPartnership, only start once the chicks reach the farm.\n\n## Pre-Hatch Technologies\n\nThere is good news despite this grisly backdrop: The poultry supply chain is\nin the beginning stages of a transformation enabled by technological advances\nthat point to a system that is more efficient and more likely to guarantee a\nbetter beginning of life for chicks. In-ovo sexing, on-farm hatching, and in-\novo vaccination optimize different parts of this supply chain by moving\nprocessing and transportation steps to before any eggs hatch.\n\n### In-ovo sexing\n\nIn-ovo sexing allows farmers to identify which eggs will hatch into males and\nwhich will produce females. Male eggs can then be removed and destroyed before\nthey can feel pain so that only female chicks are hatched. This technology has\nthe potential to spare 6-7 billion day-old male chicks from needless death\nglobally each year.\n\nTwo broad approaches for in-ovo sexing already exist and have reached\ncommercial scale. The first of these approaches utilizes imaging technologies\nlike MRI or hyperspectral imaging to look \u201cthrough\u201d the shell of the egg to\ndetermine the sex of the embryo inside. The second approach involves taking a\nsmall fluid sample from inside the egg, and then running PCR to identify the\nsex chromosomes, or using mass spectrometry to locate a sex-specific hormone.\nMore than 15 percent of the layer hens currently alive in Europe (56.4 million\nhens) have gone through one of these two processes.\n\nMultiple other approaches are in development and have not yet been\ncommercially deployed. Some technologies can \u201csmell\u201d a chick\u2019s sex by\nanalyzing volatile compounds excreted through the eggshell. Another approach\nuses gene editing so that male eggs have a genetic marker that allows their\ndevelopment to be halted by a simple trigger, such as a blue light. Unlike\nhumans, the sex of a chicken is determined by the chromosomal contribution of\nits mother. By only modifying the sex chromosome of the female parent line\nthat yields male chicks, the female chicks end up without the gene edit. This\nmeans that the eggs they lay do not need to be labeled as \u201cgene-edited\u201d for\nconsumers. While approaches like this may eventually have benefits over the\ntechnologies currently used in the market, they are all in the early stages of\ndevelopment.\n\nThe beginning of Respeggt's in-ovo sexing circuit.

Just last\nyear, the in-ovo sexing capacity on the continent increased by 60 percent,\nfrom 17 to 27 installed machines. Initially, adoption was driven by\ngovernmental bans on male chick culling in Germany, France, and Italy, but now\nadoption has expanded to countries without bans, such as Norway, Spain,\nBelgium, and the Netherlands. In these markets, eggs from hens that were in-\novo sexed sell for a modest 1-3 euro cents more per egg.\n\nIn the U.S., economic forces rather than regulation tend to drive the path to\nmarket. Earlier this year, the first American egg producer announced their\nintention to bring in-ovo sexing to the US in 2025. The company, Egg\nInnovations, is a prominent producer of higher welfare eggs, meaning they\nalready have strong connections to consumers who would be happy to pay a\nmodest price premium for cull-free eggs. Indeed, if the price increase in the\nU.S. is similar to that in Europe, it will be less than what consumers already\npay for other welfare improvements like pasture-raised, free-range, or cage-\nfree eggs.\n\nHowever, unlike other welfare improvements, in-ovo sexing is fundamentally an\nautomation technology, meaning that the natural incentives of economics and\nengineering will inevitably push the costs down over time, thereby increasing\nmarket share. In-ovo sexing will also unlock other efficiencies for hatcheries\nsuch as freeing up incubator space that would have been taken up by male eggs.\nThese factors suggest that in the long term, in-ovo sexing will be cheaper\nthan the current method of paying humans to determine the sex of each chick by\nhand.\n\n### On-Farm Hatching\n\nOn-farm hatching is a practice where chicks bypass hatchery processing and\ntransport entirely and instead hatch directly on the farm on which they\u2019ll\ngrow up. On day 18 of the 21-day incubation period, fertilized eggs are almost\nready to hatch, so they no longer need to be tilted back and forth by an\nartificial incubator. They\u2019re removed from the incubator and transported to\nthe farm, still in the protective casing of their shell. At the farm, they are\nlaid out on or near the ground so that chicks can hatch peacefully, without\nhuman intervention. Chicks hatched on-farm avoid all of the stress and risk of\ninjury or death associated with hatchery processing and the subsequent live\ntransport.\n\nA newborn chick hatching in an on-farm hatching system developed by\nVencomatic. Once the chick is ready to walk, it will gently fall onto the\nfloor of the litterbed with the other chicks. Credit Vencomatic\u2014courtesy of\nRobert Yaman.\n\nOn-farm hatching technology companies provide equipment and infrastructure to\nmake this practice as simple and cheap as possible for farmers. Similar to in-\novo sexing, on-farm hatching is in a \u201cscale-up\u201d phase, with multiple companies\nactively pushing different solutions onto the market.\n\nOne company called NestBorn developed a robot that can drive around the barn\nand, using vacuum suction cups, remove eggs from hatching trays and place them\ngently on the litterbed. The machine also has self-disinfecting capabilities\nto prevent the spread of disease as it travels between many barns. Another\ncompany called Vencomatic has a solution where large platforms are suspended\nfrom the roof of the barn on which the farmer can directly place hatching egg\ntrays. Once the chicks hatch, they fall a short distance onto the floor of the\nbarn. Between hatches, eggshells can be easily removed, and the suspended\nplatforms can be winched up to the ceiling to allow for cleaning of the barn.\n\nOn-farm hatching is currently gaining popularity in Europe for broilers since\nit has a range of production benefits. Without post-hatch processing and\ntransport, chicks have immediate access to food and water, which allows them\nto start eating and gaining weight right away. For a broiler producer, this\nmeans the chicks start generating economic value more quickly. Immediate\naccess to feed and water also allows for better intestinal development which,\ncombined with the lack of exposure to pathogens during hatching and\ntransportation, significantly decreases the need for antibiotics.\n\nOne recent study found that flocks hatched on-farm experienced 44 percent less\nantibiotic use than conventionally hatched chickens and a 5.6 times greater\nprobability of being antibiotic-free. Another study found that total mortality\nwas around half a percent lower in on-farm hatched chicks. That number may\nseem negligible, but it would translate to over 46 million chickens spared\nfrom premature death each year in the U.S.\n\nUntil recently, on-farm hatching was only possible for broilers, since\nhatching layers on-farm would mean that males intermix with females. However,\nin-ovo sexing may enable this technology for layers, allowing egg producers to\nsee many of the same benefits.\n\nFor layers, it\u2019s likely that a reduction in early-life stress will have a host\nof additional benefits for both animal welfare and production efficiency. One\nstudy found that less stressed chickens lay more eggs per week and each egg\ntended to be around 2 grams larger. Early life stress has also been correlated\nto injurious pecking (referring to hens aggressively pecking at each other on\nthe farm), one of the biggest welfare challenges for egg producers, and the\nunderlying reason for beak trimming at the hatchery. That said, the academic\nliterature surrounding on-farm hatching for layers is still scant, and the\nlong-term effects of on-farm hatching are not yet fully understood.\n\n### In-ovo Vaccination\n\nVaccination is an important part of poultry production to ensure that birds\nstay healthy and productive. An outbreak of a virus like Marek\u2019s disease can\ncause tumors and paralysis across an entire flock, which is bad for both\nanimal welfare, and the producer\u2019s bottom line.\n\nAll chickens are already vaccinated against common diseases, and the method of\nvaccination can vary based on the vaccine\u2019s mechanism of action. Some\nvaccines, such as for infectious bursal disease, are commonly administered\nthrough a spray mist, or by squirting a vaccine into each chick\u2019s eye. Other\ndiseases, like Marek\u2019s disease, require subcutaneous injection to be\neffective. Many of these methods, especially the ones that involve handling,\ncan be extremely aversive for the chick.\n\nIn-ovo vaccination, in addition to avoiding this stressful handling, has a\nnumber of advantages for the producer. Vaccine administration for eggs is\nsubstantially easier than for chicks, meaning that in-ovo vaccinated eggs have\na more consistent and uniform delivery across each embryo. Additionally,\nadministering the vaccine pre-hatch gives the chick\u2019s immune system the\nmaximum amount of time to fortify itself against the disease, making\nvaccination significantly more effective. In-ovo vaccination also allows\nhatcheries to save on the costs of hiring and training skilled laborers to\nperform manual post-hatch vaccination.\n\nFortunately, in-ovo vaccination technology is already fairly advanced, having\nbeen common practice in the broiler industry for many years. However, in-ovo\nvaccination has been uncommon for layer chickens, since the culling of males\nmeant that half of the vaccines go to waste. This is where in-ovo sexing can\nhelp, ensuring that only the female eggs are vaccinated.\n\n## The Hatcheries of the Future\n\nThe emergence of these three technologies around the same time can be\nexplained by taking the perspective of a process engineer. As a unit of\nengineering, fertilized eggs have a number of advantages over live chicks.\nEggs are controllable, immobile, storable, and have a regular shape. There is\nwell-developed automation equipment that can handle huge amounts of eggs in a\ngentle and orderly way. Eggs can sit snugly and motionless in trays and can be\nmoved with vacuum suction cups for precise handling.\n\nChicks, on the other hand, are uncontrollable. They move autonomously, need to\nbe fed and watered to survive, and are irregularly shaped. They are sensitive\nto pathogens in the environment and need to be handled gently to avoid injury\nor death. Automation equipment for chicks is necessarily cruder\u2014chicks are\ngenerally transported down production lines on conveyor belts, either in\nbaskets or simply freely standing on the belts, resulting in unrestrained and\nchaotic movement. In areas where automation is infeasible, such as the manual\nsexing of layers, chicks are handled by skilled laborers who are notoriously\ndifficult to hire, train, and retain.\n\nThe inherent engineering advantages of fertilized eggs over chicks will be a\npowerful driver of the adoption of these three technologies across the entire\npoultry industry. Currently, in-ovo sexing is only used for layers, and on-\nfarm hatching and in-ovo vaccination are primarily used for broilers. However,\nas in-ovo sexing becomes more widespread, on-farm hatching and in-ovo\nvaccination may become more common for layers as well.\n\nIn the longer term, we may also see in-ovo sexing for broilers. There are\nalready initiatives underway to automate sexing for day-old broiler chicks,\ngiven the challenges associated with hiring skilled laborers in today\u2019s\neconomic climate. However, since an individual broiler is less economically\nvaluable than an individual layer, in-ovo sexing would need to be\nsubstantially cheaper for broilers than for layers.\n\nFortunately, in-ovo sexing may also be technically simpler for broilers than\nfor layers, potentially allowing it to attain the required cost point. One of\nthe technical hurdles for in-ovo sexing of layers is that it needs to be done\nas early as possible in the embryo\u2019s development to guarantee that the embryo\nwill not experience pain when destroyed. The current scientific evidence\nsuggests that at day 13 of the egg\u2019s 21-day development, pain perception\ncannot be ruled out, meaning that in-ovo sexing for layers should ideally take\nplace before this time. However, during this time window, the embryo is far\nfrom fully developed, meaning that many sex-differentiating features may be\nexpensive or even impossible to detect.\n\nHowever, since broilers are not culled, but rather reared separately by sex,\nthere is little incentive to push in-ovo sexing to work as early as possible.\nIn-ovo sexing of broilers could happen as late as day 18 when eggs are almost\nready to hatch because the sex-differentiating features of the embryos will be\nfully developed. While such initiatives haven\u2019t reached the market yet, it\u2019s\npossible this will be an application of the technology as costs fall.\n\nOnce in-ovo sexing becomes feasible for broilers, it can also unlock sex-\nspecific vaccination. Males and females have slightly different immune\nsystems, meaning that sex-specific vaccination regimes may help keep chickens\neven healthier. The potential benefits of sex-specific vaccination for\nvaccines administered in-ovo were previously impractical even to consider, let\nalone measure. But a combination of in-ovo sexing and vaccination could make\nthis imminently practicable.\n\nWith all three of these technologies, the hatcheries of the future will\nconduct all handling and processing before the chick becomes aware of what\u2019s\nhappening to it, and the first moments of each chick's life will be\nsubstantially safer and less stressful. This is by no means the last welfare\nchallenge the chicks will experience over their lives, but the improvements to\nthe first days of life will be immense.\n\nThis vision for the future of hatcheries is not far-fetched. The distribution\nof labor between different parts of the poultry supply chain was determined by\nthose technologies that were available when the poultry industry first\nindustrialized. The artificial incubation of fertilized eggs was one of the\nfirst technological revolutions in the poultry industry in the early twentieth\ncentury, and the ability to procure and operate these incubators was the\ndriving force behind why hatcheries became a separate part of the supply chain\nfrom farms. However, as poultry production technology continues to evolve, the\ndistribution of labor can evolve with it. The logistical challenges associated\nwith handling live animals at the hatchery will be automated away and replaced\nwith more humane in-ovo solutions.\n\nIn theory, if there are true economic benefits to this transition, then market\npressures should naturally push the industry in this direction without\nintervention. However, technological changes in industrial sectors always\nhappen slowly, especially in commodity markets like animal agriculture. R&D or\nnew capital expenditure has to fight for a limited pool of cash, especially\nduring crises like COVID supply-chain disruptions or avian influenza.\n\nIt follows that, even if the hatchery of the future is a more efficient setup,\ntransitioning will necessarily happen more slowly than it \u201cought\u201d to if the\npositive externalities of improving animal welfare are not accounted for.\nGiven the society-wide consensus that improving farm animal welfare is\nimportant, we need a broader push to compensate companies for the positive\nwelfare externalities they foster. Business leaders, engineers, and\nbiotechnologists should devote serious effort to improving and scaling the\ntechnologies needed to transition to the hatchery of the future, and, in turn,\nconsumers should reward these companies through their purchasing decisions.\n\nGovernments also have a role to play. Few government programs exist to improve\nanimal welfare, and the ones that exist usually take the form of command-and-\ncontrol regulation, solely focused on telling companies only what they cannot\ndo. While such regulations have the right intentions, they do little to\nalleviate the bottlenecks that businesses face when trying to innovate and\nimprove their practices.\n\nJust as programs like the Inflation Reduction Act have provided massive\nsubsidies for technologies that mitigate climate change, governments should\nfind ways to help companies improve animal welfare, such as through low-\ninterest rate loans or tax credits for animal welfare-improving technologies.\nIn doing so they\u2019ll also be supporting American farmers, and helping to\nelevate the United States\u2019 position as a moral and technological leader. In-\novo sexing has already had some government support, with the European\nInvestment Bank\u2019s recent loan to the in-ovo sexing company In Ovo and the\nUSDA\u2019s funding of in-ovo sexing R&D.\n\nFarm animal welfare is a cause that receives little attention relative to the\namount that people claim to care about it, perhaps because practical, scalable\nsolutions have not yet taken center stage in the discussion. However,\ntechnologies like in-ovo sexing, on-farm hatching, and in-ovo vaccination\noffer the ability to improve animal welfare without sacrificing any of the\nabundance that industrialized animal agriculture provides. The transformation\nthat these three technologies will bring to the poultry supply chain can serve\nas a blueprint for how human ingenuity can make our husbandry more efficient,\nand more humane.\n\n***\n\nRobert Yaman is the founder and CEO of Innovate Animal Ag, a nonprofit think\ntank that promotes technology as a practical way to solve the biggest\nchallenges in farm animal welfare.
