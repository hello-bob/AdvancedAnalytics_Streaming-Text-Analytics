When the storm hit, Texas was unable\nto transfer enough emergency power from other electricity markets to keep the\nlights on. The death toll was in the hundreds.\n\nA new multi-billion-dollar infrastructure project could mitigate a similar\npower emergency in the future. For more than a decade, a private renewables\ndeveloper, Pattern Energy, has been trying to build a 320-mile transmission\nline linking Texas\u2019 power grid to the Southeast. But the project, known as\nSouthern Spirit, is now facing opposition in not one but two states it would\ntraverse. Entergy, a utility company whose affiliates in Mississippi and\nLouisiana would stand to benefit if the new project fails, has raised doubts\nabout the proposal before Mississippi regulators. And even if Mississippi\nmoves forward, a bill in the Louisiana legislature \u2014 which was revised at the\nbehest of Entergy \u2014 could derail the entire project.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Texans who would benefit from more transmission. In order for\nthe U.S. to decarbonize its electricity, a lot more power lines will need to\nbe built across the country. Most crucial is the need for more interregional\ntransmission lines like Southern Spirit \u2014 those that connect the nation\u2019s\npatchwork of energy grids to one another. These are especially important for\nrenewable energy, in part for geographic reasons: The sunny deserts of the\nSouthwest and the gusty plains of Texas and Oklahoma are disproportionately\nstrong producers of solar and wind power, respectively, but most of the\npotential customers for that power are clustered near the country\u2019s coasts. As\na result, the Department of Energy estimates that interregional transmission\ncapacity will need to expand by a factor of five in order to meet the Biden\nadministration\u2019s goal of decarbonizing the power sector by 2035.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

The first is that\ntransmission lines sometimes face resistance from landowners along the way,\nwho use the permitting and environmental review processes to block development\nthrough litigation or similar means. A second, underappreciated obstacle to\nnew interregional transmission lines is resistance from power companies, who\nmay face a strong disincentive to allow competition in the form of cheap,\nfaraway electricity. On a recent podcast appearance, Mark Lauby, chief\nengineer at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, an industry\ngroup that regulates the national transmission grid, acknowledged this\ndifficulty, asking, \u201cHow do I get a [transmission] line through multiple\nmarkets when markets themselves don\u2019t want to compete with other markets?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have substantial challenges within markets, within generators, that are\ntrying to stop the building of transmission. It\u2019s not just permitting; it\u2019s\nalso those folks that feel that they actually get gain out of having that\nstinking solar stuff a ways away, so they can make more money locally,\u201d Lauby\nadded.\n\nBeyond helping make Texas\u2019 grid resilient, more transmission lines connecting\nTexas to nearby grids would also help maximize the carbon emissions savings\nfrom the state\u2019s abundant wind power. Texas produces more wind energy than any\nother state, but wind farms are often forced to reduce their output due to\ninadequate transmission. Building more transmission lines allows producers to\nproduce more wind energy by giving it somewhere to go.\n\nFor these reasons, the Southern Spirit project looks like a win-win: If built,\nit could help decarbonize the region, lower power bills, and protect Texans\nfrom a repeat of 2021. It was this last benefit that seemed to finally put\nsome wind in the project\u2019s sails after the storm convinced grid planners at\nERCOT, Texas\u2019 energy grid, that more transmission was needed.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nBut clouds appeared on the horizon last October when Entergy Mississippi\nexpressed concerns around the transmission project in filings before the\nMississippi Public Service Commission, which must approve Southern Spirit for\nthe project to move forward.\n\nThe proposed path for the Southern Spirit Transmission line, from Texas to\nMississippi. Courtesy of Pattern Energy\n\nNeal Kirby, a spokesperson for the Entergy Corporation (the Mississippi\nutility\u2019s parent company), told Grist in an email that Entergy Mississippi has\nnot taken a position on Southern Spirit overall, but rather has \u201craised\nconcerns about the impacts of the project on its customers.\u201d\n\nKirby told Grist that the utility was concerned that \u201ceastbound flows from the\nline would cause overloads on the system that Southern Spirit would not be\nrequired to address or resolve. As a result, Entergy Mississippi homes and\nbusinesses may be left with either less reliable electric service or footing\nthe bill for system upgrades to reliably accommodate injections of energy from\nthe new line.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Entergy\u2019s system might not be equipped to handle the extra\npower shipped in from Texas without capital upgrades \u2014 and because utilities\npass on the costs of approved capital upgrades to consumers as a matter of\ncourse, this would mean higher electric bills.\n\nDaniel Tait, a researcher at the Energy and Policy Institute, a nonprofit\nutility watchdog, called Entergy\u2019s contention that access to Southern Spirit\nwould destabilize the grid and make its energy more costly \u201cabsurd and a mask\nfor its anti-competitive behavior.\u201d\n\nJust what might be \u201canti-competitive\u201d about Entergy\u2019s stance on Southern\nSpirit was captured in testimony submitted to the Mississippi Public Service\nCommission by Jeff Dicharry, a transmission planner employed by Entergy, who\nsaid the proposed transmission line could force the utility to scale back\nservice at its natural gas plants in Mississippi.\n\n\u201cThe predictable result would be an inability to operate [Entergy-operated\nnatural gas plants] Choctaw and Attala during periods with east-bound flow on\n[Southern Spirit] due to congestion on the transmission system. This would be\nproblematic,\u201d wrote Dicharry.\n\nTait said Entergy Mississippi\u2019s complaint amounts to \u201can implicit\nacknowledgment that this [transmission line] is economically beneficial for\ncustomers,\u201d because the Mississippi utility would only reduce operations at\nits gas plants if the energy flowing in from Texas were cheaper than its own\noutput.\n\nIn Louisiana, meanwhile, state legislators are considering a bill that would\neffectively kill the project by denying expropriation authority \u2014 the ability\nto acquire private property through eminent domain \u2014 to all transmission lines\nthat run through the state unless a majority of their power is consumed within\nthe state.\n\nAlan Seabaugh, the bill\u2019s Republican sponsor in the Louisiana state Senate,\ntold Grist his bill was intended to protect North Louisiana landowners from\ntheir land being confiscated for a project that does not benefit the state\u2019s\nresidents. The bill passed the Senate by 36 to 1 on March 25 and is pending\nbefore the House\u2019s Civil Law and Procedure Committee.\n\nBecause Southern Spirit connects Texas to Mississippi, \u201cthere is no way to\nlegitimately with a straight face argue that Louisiana\u2019s going to benefit from\nthis one iota,\u201d Seabaugh said, though he clarified that he has not taken a\nformal position for or against the project.\n\nAdam Renz, Pattern Energy\u2019s director of project development, told Grist that\nSeabaugh was \u201cvery much technically incorrect\u201d in his assessment that\nLouisiana would not benefit from the transmission line. Though the line does\nterminate in Mississippi rather than Louisiana, it would deliver energy into a\nregional grid known as MISO South, which much of Louisiana draws power from.\n\n\u201cThe electrons the project will inject into the system can and will flow into\nthe state of Louisiana,\u201d Renz said in an email.\n\nEntergy\u2019s Louisiana subsidiary has not taken a position on Seabaugh\u2019s bill,\nbut the utility was instrumental in the passage of an amendment that exempted\nany transmission lines within an existing power grid from its purview \u2014\neffectively ensuring its own future projects would not be affected. \u201cThey gave\nus an amendment to make sure that they were excluded,\u201d Seabaugh said.\n\nKirby, the Entergy spokesperson, confirmed this. \u201cWhen the bill author shared\nthe legislation with us, we raised concerns that it may impede projects deemed\nnecessary by MISO or SPP, the entities that are ultimately responsible for\nmaking independent determinations about what transmission projects are needed\nin most of Louisiana,\u201d he said. \u201cEntergy Louisiana suggested to the bill\nauthor some language that would address this concern.\u201d\n\nTo Davante Lewis, an elected utility regulator in Louisiana who wrote a letter\nto the state Senate opposing the bill, the amendment effectively \u201cgives the\nincumbent utilities all the rights to build transmission\u201d and amounts to\n\u201cpushing interregional transmission costs onto ratepayers,\u201d because utilities\nhave the authority to pass on their capital costs to ratepayers once they get\nregulatory approval. By contrast, Pattern Energy is privately financing the\nSouthern Spirit project with an investment of more than $2.6 billion, and will\nrecoup that investment from tariffs on power sold over the line once it\u2019s\noperational. Renz said the project has not received any federal or state\nincentives.\n\nLewis, whose commission is currently reviewing a petition for certification by\nPattern Energy, has not taken a position on Southern Spirit but said he\nopposes Seabaugh\u2019s bill because, while it \u201cseems to be directly targeted only\nat the Southern Spirit transmission line, my concern is what would this mean\nfor transmission buildout\u201d \u2014 which he characterized as an important priority\nfor Louisiana ratepayers in the face of growing electricity demand as well as\nthe need to decarbonize.\n\n\u201cBringing on transmission in order to curb peak demand is vitally important.\nHowever, if we look at who has been the biggest objector, it\u2019s been\nutilities,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
