But,\nis it a good idea to send basically every web request to google first? What\nare proper alternatives for public DNS servers? Preferably, with some security\nand privacy in mind?\n\nLet's take a look!\n\n## Alternative To\n\n\"Alternative To\" is a format of blog articles, where I want to provide\nalternatives for widely used software, services, and products. Yes, I will\nhave security, privacy and Open Source in mind, for sure. The first article of\nthis kind is already pretty old, but still valid. Since it was a bit short, I\nwanted to add more \"fuel\" for you.\n\nSpotlight - Alternatives for YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and more\n\nThere was a time when the internet was young, full of enthusiastic people that\nwanted to connect others. We became the product. Our data is used to sell ad-\nplacements. Are there alternatives?\n\nblog.while-true-do.ioDaniel Schier\n\nIn case you wonder what can be used to replace Google Docs, Dropbox and more,\nthis series might be for you.\n\n## DNS\n\nDNS (Domain Name System) is a technology, that resolves hostnames into IP\nAddresses. This sounds pretty low-tech, isn't it? Well, basically every\nbrowser request that you are performing uses DNS. I don't want to go into too\nmuch detail, but it works pretty much like this.\n\n  1. You will open a Browser and point to https://example.com\n  2. Your Browser will go to the next available DNS recursive resolver, which is most likely from your ISP or another public machine\n  3. The resolver queries a DNS root nameserver\n  4. The root nameserver will provide you with the address for the Top Level Domain (TLD) nameserver (.com in our case)\n  5. The resolver then makes a request to the TLD nameserver\n  6. The TLD nameserver answers with the domain's nameserver\n  7. The domain nameserver replies to the resolver with a valid IP address\n  8. The browser makes a request to this IP address\n\n\u00a92022, Daniel Schier, CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nAs you can see, there are many requests happening. Very often, this allows\nyour ISP or the used resolver to track what you are doing.\n\n## Google DNS\n\nBefore providing alternatives to a service, you might be interested in what\nGoogle provides, and why it may be a good/bad idea using it. So, here is the\nquick rundown.\n\nGoogles Public DNS service is available for quite some time already. It is\nwidely adopted, high available, properly scaled and provides several security\nfeatures like DNS over TLS or DNS over HTTPS. In comparison to your ISP's DNS,\nyou might also get more answers from the Google DNS, since it does not obey to\n\"DNS blocking\" like ISPs typically do.\n\nOn the other hand, all your requests are sent to Google. This means, Google\nhas lots of information about how the web is used. Also, Google is known to\nchange or even delete services at any point in time.\n\n  * \u2705 DNS over HTTPS (DoH)\n  * \u2705 DNS over TLS (DoT)\n  * \u2705 DNS over Quic (DoQ)\n  * \ud83d\udeab DNSCrypt\n  * \ud83d\udeab No logging\n  * \ud83d\udeab Ad Block\n\n## Alternatives\n\nInstead of making yourself depending on a single provider, it might be a good\nidea to choose the right provider for you. Some of them, even, add additional\nfeatures on top of the regular DNS doings.\n\n### AdGuard DNS\n\nKnown for its ad-blocking capabilities as a browser extension. In addition,\nAdGuard offers a public DNS service, which provides extra Ad Blocking\nfeatures. If a known ad DNS name is used, it will resolve this server to the\naddress 0.0.0.0. Almost all clients are interpreting this result to \"does not\nexist\" and therefore skip further actions with this address.\n\nWith an (optional) account, you can configure even more features, including\nparental control, grabbing statistics and whatnot.\n\n  * \u2705 DNS over HTTPS (DoH)\n  * \u2705 DNS over TLS (DoT)\n  * \u2705 DNS over Quic (DoQ)\n  * \u2705 DNSCrypt\n  * \ud83d\udeab No logging\n  * \u2705 Ad Block\n\nAdGuard DNS \u2014 ad-blocking DNS server\n\nCreate your ad-blocking DNS server that will protect your personal data,\nprevent tracking and allow you to control access to specific content on the\nInternet.\n\nAdGuard DNS \u2014 ad-blocking DNS server\n\n### Quad9\n\nQuad9 positioned itself as the privacy-oriented alternative to Google's public\nDNS. In general, there will be no logs on the servers and many encryption\nprotocols are supported. Quad9 provides a very detailed page how they want to\nensure data privacy and why they consider this as important.\n\n  * \u2705 DNS over HTTPS (DoH)\n  * \u2705 DNS over TLS (DoT)\n  * \u2705 DNS over Quic (DoQ)\n  * \u2705 DNSCrypt\n  * \u2705 No logging\n  * \ud83d\udeab Ad Block (but limited malware blocking)\n\nQuad9 | A public and free DNS service for a better security and privacy\n\nA public and free DNS service for a better security and privacy\n\nQuad9Christian Kaufmann Chairman, RIPE\n\n### dnsforge.de\n\ndnsforge.de is an interesting approach from Germany, which offers a public DNS\nservice with optional parental control. The project supports basically all\nencryption standards and added \"no tracking\", \"no logging\" and \"no\nadvertising\" on top.\n\n  * \u2705 DNS over HTTPS (DoH)\n  * \u2705 DNS over TLS (DoT)\n  * \u2705 DNS over Quic (DoQ)\n  * \u2705 DNSCrypt\n  * \u2705 No logging\n  * \u2705 Ad Block\n\nIt is a very small project, though.\n\ndnsforge.de DNS Resolver\n\nDNS-over-TLS und DNS-over-HTTPS: Zensurfreier, sicherer und redundanter DNS\nResolver ohne Logging, daf\u00fcr mit Werbeblocker.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\nThe next two providers were requested/recommended from the community. Thank\nyou for the inspiration.\n\n### Cloudflare\n\nCloudflare hosts another, very public DNS resolver. It is exceptionally fast,\ncompared to other providers, including Google's public DNS. Anyway, in daily\nuse you will not \"feel\" a huge difference, since the loading of a web page\nwill take way longer than the resolution of DNS records.\n\n  * \u2705 DNS over HTTPS (DoH)\n  * \u2705 DNS over TLS (DoT)\n  * \ud83d\udeab DNS over Quic (DoQ)\n  * \ud83d\udeab DNSCrypt\n  * \u2705 No logging\n  * \ud83d\udeab Ad Block\n\n1.1.1.1 \u2014 The free app that makes your Internet faster.\n\nInstall the free app that makes your phone\u2019s Internet more fast, private, and\nreliable.\n\n### OpenDNS\n\nOpenDNS (by Cisco) was recommended, too. Unfortunately, it is a bit tricky to\nfind which features are supported. So, please see the below results as \"based\non my Knowledgebase foo with Cisco\". In addition to the public DNS service,\nyou can subscribe for additional features, including parental control or ad\nblocking and filtering.\n\n  * \u2705 DNS over HTTPS (DoH)\n  * \ud83d\udeab DNS over TLS (DoT)\n  * \ud83d\udeab DNS over Quic (DoQ)\n  * \u2705 DNSCrypt\n  * \ud83d\udeab No logging\n  * \ud83d\udeab Ad Block\n\nCloud Delivered Enterprise Security by OpenDNS\n\nPredict and prevent attacks before they happen using our cloud-delivered\nenterprise security service.

I opted for Quad9 some\ntime ago, but I am also playing with dnsforge.de recently. Quad9 was reliable\nfor private, company, and enterprise approaches for me.\n\nBut, enough of my opinion. What about you? Which DNS resolver is not on my\nlist? Which one do you use?
