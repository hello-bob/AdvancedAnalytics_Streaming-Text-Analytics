Just because an API exists and some\nbrowsers support it does not mean all browsers should support it. I never ever\nwant a website to be able to vibrate my device. Ever. Nor do I want websites\nto be able to prompt me with an alert asking for permission to vibrate my\ndevice. Not supporting the Vibration API is a feature, not an omission.\n\nIf you want web apps to have the same full range of capabilities as native\napps, iOS is not the platform for you. PWA advocates treat it as axiomatic\nthat web apps should be peers to native apps, but that\u2019s not true for\neveryone. I think of native apps as software I carefully consider before\ninstalling, even from the App Store. I think of websites and web apps as\nsoftware I will visit/run without consideration, because they\u2019re so\ncomparatively restricted.\n\n\u2605 Tuesday, 16 April 2024\n\nDisplay Preferences\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2002\u20132024 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
