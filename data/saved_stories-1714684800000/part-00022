The prices\nand menu on the app are different to what you saw in the window. When you\ndownload a second app the prices are different again. You ring the restaurant\ndirectly and it says the number is no longer in service. You go to the\nrestaurant and order in person. You mention that their website has the wrong\nnumber and the woman behind the counter says they have to contact the company\nwho designed the site for changes, which will cost them, but most people just\norder through an app anyway.\n\nYou want to watch the trailer for an upcoming movie on YouTube but you first\nhave to sit through an ad. Then you sit through a preview for the trailer\nitself. Then you watch the trailer, which is literally another ad. When it\nends, it cues up a new trailer, with a new ad at the start of it.\n\nThe first page of Google results are links to pages that have scraped other\npages for information from other pages that have been scraped for information.\nAll the sources seem to link back to one another. There is no origin. The\nphotos on the page look weird. The hands are disfigured. There is no image\ncredit.\n\nYour coworker sends you a PowerPoint pack to support a presentation you are\ngiving to the executive committee, but you can\u2019t make heads or tails of it.\nYou call them over Zoom and they tell you they used ChatGPT to write it. You\npoint out that it is near-unreadable, and they ask what specifically is wrong\nwith it. You mention that, for starters, there are too many words on each\nslide. They tell you they\u2019ll take care of it. They send you a new pack within\nthe hour saying they asked ChatGPT to remove 30% of the text. It makes even\nless sense. You tell them you\u2019ll just rewrite it yourself.\n\nA billionaire got mad, bought your favourite social media site and ran it into\nthe ground. A different billionaire got mad, bought the magazine site you\nliked to read on your lunchbreak and shut it down completely. A third\nbillionaire did what they do best, bought the app you use for networking and\nsold it off for parts.\n\nYou want to watch a TV show from your youth so you check a streaming service,\nbut it is not there, so you check a second streaming service but it is not\nthere, so you check a third streaming service and it is not there. You search\nfor it on Blu-ray but it doesn\u2019t exist, so you search for it on DVD but it is\nout of print. You find a seller on eBay who has it, but the listing reads\nambiguous as to whether it is the real thing or a burnt copy. You message the\nseller and they reply with an automated response thanking you for your\ninterest.\n\nYou can\u2019t read the recipe on your phone because it prioritises the ads on the\npage. You bring your laptop into the kitchen and whenever you scroll down, you\nhave to close a pop-up. You turn AdBlock on and the page no longer loads, then\nAdBlock sends you an ad asking for money.\n\nThe Airbnb charges you a $150 cleaning fee, but insists the place needs to be\nleft spotless. There will be a fee if the bedding hasn\u2019t been stripped and the\ndishwasher hasn\u2019t been emptied.\n\nYour Uber driver is lost because his app hasn\u2019t updated and keeps telling him\nto turn down streets that no longer exist. You still give him five stars.\n\nYour mother sends you a link to a breaking story, but the article is behind a\npaywall, so you switch to the website where you do pay for news but there\u2019s no\nmention of it.\n\nYou buy a microwave and receive ads for microwaves. You buy a mattress and\nreceive ads for mattresses.\n\nStrangers on social media assume you are American and get mad when you correct\nthem.\n\nYour Gmail is approaching storage capacity.\n\nYour smart TV needs new firmware.\n\nYour phone schedules an update.\n\nYour friend has a short story published online but you need to pay for a\nsubscription to the site in order to read it. You message them and ask if you\ncould get a copy. They say \u2018sure\u2019 and send you a PDF. You read the story and\nlike it. You are curious about one detail. You message them for more\ninformation and they recommend checking out the Wikipedia page. You read the\nWikipedia entry and there is a lot of useful information supplied by a\ncommunity. One of the sources cited is a non-fiction book. You go to your\nlocal library\u2019s website and although they don\u2019t have the exact book, they do\nhave others by the same author. You place a hold on two of them, then go get\nyour shoes on.\n\nGregory Bennett is a writer and filmmaker from Wellington whose accent comes\nfrom Invercargill. They hold a Masters in Creative Writing from the IIML and\ncurrently work for a disability support services provider in Melbourne,\nAustralia.\n\nTags: Fictiont110\n\n#### Takah\u0113 magazine\n\nBringing literature and art from Aotearoa New Zealand to the world.\n\n  * My account\n  * Checkout\n\n  * Magazines\n  * Covers Gallery\n  * Search\n  * Interviews\n\nDesigned by Create Design Studio | Copyright \u00a92021\n\n", "frontpage": true}
