For thirty plus years, KNX has been unique in offering a\nworldwide standard that ensures products from competing companies can work\ntogether seamlessly, reliably, and over the long term.\n\nThe official launch of Matter, an open-source connectivity standard for smart\nhome and IoT devices, developed by Amazon, Apple and Google, amongst others,\nin late 2022, has rightly generated a lot of interest. Whilst Matter is geared\ntowards a key principle of KNX; namely interoperability between products from\ncompeting companies, there are notable differences.\n\nIn this article we provide a high-level direct comparison, a quick comparison\nchart and our view on the position and market segmentation of KNX and Matter.\n\nMatter logo image source: Connectivity Standards Alliance, Public domain, via\nWikimedia Commons.\n\nHIGH LEVEL DIRECT COMPARISON\n\nSmart homes \u2013 Standards and Technologies\n\nKNX\n\n\u2022 A smart home standard that fixes the rules, protocols, and specifications\nthat define how different smart devices communicate with each other.\n\n\u2022 Functions as the backbone of any fully-integrated smart home by ensuring\ninteroperability, security, and operation within an ecosystem.\n\n\u2022 KNX products comply to ISO/IEC & EN standards. Therefore, smart home devices\nfrom various manufacturers can work together cohesively, offering a better\nuser experience and enabling a more comprehensive smart home environment.\n\nMatter\n\n\u2022 A technology that has been accepted by the members of Connectivity Standards\nAlliance (CSA). The technology of Matter itself is not an international (EN or\nISO) standard.\n\n\u2022 Every manufacturer can use Matter technology and add additional features in\nthe products from their brands. In this way, manufacturers of devices can\noffer additional functionalities if the end-customer uses products from the\nsame brand.\n\nDifferent organisations, different approaches\n\nKNX\n\n\u2022 Founded in the \u201990s, benefitting from unparalleled expertise and longevity.\n\n\u2022 Pioneers in the field of home and building automation who defined the first\ninternational standard for smart homes, meaning homeowners were no longer tied\nto a single brand or manufacturer.\n\n\u2022 International recognition, a massive professional community consisting of\n500+ manufacturers and 125,000+ systems integrators, guaranteeing lifelong\nsupport for homeowners.\n\n\u2022 Expanded expertise over time, started out as a bus system (wired\ntechnology), it now offers wireless solutions with KNX RF, as well as wired or\nwireless solutions over IP (IPv4 and IPv6).\n\nMatter\n\n\u2022 A collaborative project of members of the CSA that has been on the market\nsince 2020.\n\n\u2022 The technology has gained much attention and traction in a short time,\nmostly due to the participation of big tech companies (including Google,\nAmazon and Apple).\n\n\u2022 Expertise lies in wireless communication technologies.\n\nIntegration options\n\nKNX\n\n\u2022 The standard supports scaling of smart homes, integrating any number of\nsmart devices of different brands.\n\n\u2022 It offers full integration of 8000+ certified devices from 500+ KNX Members.\n\n\u2022 All KNX products require only one commissioning tool (ETS) in order to be\nconfigured, meaning homeowners can mix different brands that suit their homes\nbest, without any limitations.\n\nMatter\n\n\u2022 A good option to experiment with a certain brand or smart system.\n\n\u2022 When users want to add more devices and systems to their setups, they may\nexperience limitations, as Matter allows only partial connectivity between\ndevices from different brands.\n\nAssessing interoperability\n\nKNX\n\n\u2022 Has always been a champion of full interoperability for smart homes, meaning\nthat different devices and brands can interact and integrate seamlessly with\none another within the same ecosystem. This fosters interoperability and\nflexibility in choosing devices for a KNX installation.\n\nMatter\n\n\u2022 As a collaboration between some of the largest tech companies, there may be\na reluctance to allow the sharing of information between different existing\necosystems.\n\n\u2022 It will be possible to link your smart hub with smart lights purchased from\na Matter device provider and turn lights on and off for example. To change\nsettings or set up automations though, you will likely need to use the App\ncorresponding to the selected smart hub.\n\nInstallation processes\n\nKNX\n\n\u2022 Homeowners can rely on the full support and knowledge of an automation\nprofessional to guide the installation process.\n\n\u2022 Homeowners can share their expectations for a smart home with an expert,\nafter which all necessary devices and auxiliary equipment will be purchased\nfor them. This may sound more expensive in the short term, but it results in\nmore features being exploited and peace of mind because of the fully\nintegrated, professionally-secured setup that will continue to work over the\nlong term.\n\nMatter\n\n\u2022 Offers a DIY solution for products that can easily be bought online at an\naffordable price.\n\n\u2022 The technical setup is limited because all device communications run through\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth and other well-known wireless options where devices first\nneed to be connected to the network, after which they can be onboarded to the\necosystem. Devices also have to be paired to each other before they\u2019re ready\nto use.\n\nScalability\n\nKNX\n\n\u2022 Offers scalability to meet the needs of the smallest home through to the\nlargest commercial building, with any level of automation, and can be adapted\nas requirements change over time.\n\n\u2022 Scaling a smart home project with KNX technology is easy and fast, thanks to\nthe commissioning tool, ETS. With ETS, the complexity of changing or enlarging\nthe installation is significantly reduced, enabling professionals to\neffortlessly expand systems.\n\nMatter\n\n\u2022 Scalability may have limitations as the network expands. As more devices are\nconnected into a Matter-enabled ecosystem, the complexity of managing and\nconfiguring these devices can become a significant challenge for users.\n\n\u2022 Due to the lack of a common commissioning tool, the inherent challenge of\nscalability lies not just in the physical addition of new devices and managing\nupdates, but also in ensuring seamless interoperability and maintaining a\nuser-friendly experience.\n\nSecurity and Privacy\n\nKNX\n\n\u2022 KNX safeguards communication and data integrity with state-of-the-art\nsecurity features. With encryption and authentication, in addition to\ninitiatives such as the KNX Secure Checklist, KNX aligns with all relevant\ncybersecurity regulations and is suitable for applications with privacy and\nsecurity requirements.\n\n\u2022 In addition to communication and data protection, KNX technology protects\nthe devices themselves (Device Configuration Password) and the ETS project\n(ETS project password).\n\nMatter\n\n\u2022 With features including end-to-end encryption to protect user data and\nensure secure communication between devices, Matter has a clear focus on\nsecurity and privacy.\n\nPhysical Media\n\nKNX\n\n\u2022 KNX\u2019s flexible physical media supports a diverse range of installations:\nTwisted-Pair wiring (KNX TP), Radio Frequency (KNX RF) and over IP (KNXnetIP\nfor IPv4 as well as KNX IoT for IPv6) including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread.\n\nMatter\n\n\u2022 Matter\u2019s IP-based protocol work supports connectivity technologies that\ninclude Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread.\n\nQUICK COMPARISON GUIDE\n\nQuick comparison guide between Matter and KNX.\n\nPOSITIONING AND SEGMENTATION\n\nKNX ecosystem, extended with Matter devices\n\nThe unique potential of KNX lies in its ability to fully integrate smart\ndevices and applications within ONE secure ecosystem, a potential that can be\nexpanded by incorporating new technologies, such as Matter, into the KNX\necosystem:\n\n\u2022 KNX is the essential backbone of the smart home, offering a reliable,\nsecure, and fully-functional system. The KNX system integrates and controls a\nwide range of device types, including heating, blinds, lighting, wall\nswitches, sensors (such as motion, temperature, brightness, etc) and many\nmore.\n\n\u2022 Matter can serve to extend a KNX smart home with additional consumer\ndevices, such as TVs, streaming devices, white goods, smart lamps, bulbs,\nsmart sockets, etc.\n\nThe home automation journey \u2013 An opportunity for KNX!\n\nHomeowners\u2019 choices will depend on where they are in their automation journey.\nThose just starting to explore smart devices, will find that Matter is a good\noption for making simple connections at an entry level. If they become\noverwhelmed and unable to extend their Matter system, they are likely to be\nready for a more (or fully) integrated setup that KNX offers.\n\nIn summary:\n\n\u2022 KNX guarantees that smart devices and applications can communicate and work\nseamlessly with each other.\n\n\u2022 Homeowners can integrate an unlimited number of products into one ecosystem\nwith professional support, without needing to commit to one brand.\n\n\u2022 KNX enables limitless scalability and adaptability of the system as\nrequirements change and new devices or features come to market.\n\nJoost Demarest and Casto Ca\u00f1avate are the KNX Association CTO/CFO and\nMarketing Manager respectively.\n\nwww.knx.org\n\nShare on facebook\n\nShare\n\nShare on twitter\n\nTweet\n\nShare on linkedin\n\nShare\n\n  * articles, current articles\n  * business & market research, KNX Association, system integration\n\n## SPONSORS\n\n### LUXA 103 KNX presence detectors\n\nLUXA 103 presence detectors with a round detection area for individual and\nopen-plan offices, meeting and storage rooms, cellars ...\n\nread more\n\n## SMALL PRINT\n\n  * About\n  * Disclaimer\n  * Privacy policy\n\n## SHORT CUTS\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Articles\n  * News\n  * Resources\n  * Events\n  * Site map\n\n## CONTACTS\n\nAll enquiries can be sent to info@knxtoday.com.\n\n## KNX - THE STANDARD\n\nThe KNX Association is the creator and owner of KNX technology \u2013 the worldwide\nstandard for all applications in home and building control.\n\nKNXtoday is edited by SYPHA.
