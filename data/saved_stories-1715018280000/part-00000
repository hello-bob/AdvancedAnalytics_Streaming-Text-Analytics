They urged the authority to retain\nthem.\n\nSam, a postal worker in Harrogate, a spa town in North Yorkshire, told the BBC\nthat signs missing an apostrophe \u2013 such as the nearby St Mary\u2019s Walk sign that\nhad been erected in the town without it \u2013 infuriated her.\n\n\u201cI walk past the sign every day and it riles my blood to see inappropriate\ngrammar or punctuation,\u201d she said.\n\nThough the updated St Mary\u2019s sign had no apostrophe, someone had graffitied an\napostrophe back on to the sign with a marker pen, which the former teacher\nsaid was \u201cbrilliant\u201d.\n\nShe suggested the council was providing a bad example to children who spend a\nlong time learning the basics of grammar only to see it not being used\ncorrectly on street signs.\n\nDr Ellie Rye, a lecturer in English language and linguistics at the University\nof York, said apostrophes were a relatively new invention in our writing and,\noften, context allows people to understand their meaning.\n\n\u201cIf I say I live on St Mary\u2019s Walk, we\u2019re expecting a street name or an\naddress of some kind.\u201d\n\nShe said the change would matter to people who spend a long time teaching how\nwe write English but that it was \u201cless important in [verbal] communication\u201d.\n\nNorth Yorkshire council said it was not the first to opt to \u201celiminate\u201d the\napostrophe from street signs. Cambridge city council had done the same, before\nit bowed to pressure and reinstated the apostrophe after complaints from\ncampaigners.\n\nThere was also an outcry from residents when Mid Devon district council\nconsidered making it a policy to do away with apostrophes to \u201cavoid potential\nconfusion\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson from North Yorkshire council added: \u201cAll punctuation will be\nconsidered but avoided where possible because street names and addresses, when\nstored in databases, must meet the standards set out in BS7666.\n\n\u201cThis restricts the use of punctuation marks and special characters (eg\napostrophes, hyphens and ampersands) to avoid potential problems when\nsearching the databases as these characters have specific meanings in computer\nsystems.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * North Yorkshire\n  * Local government\n  * North of England\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Tory mayoral candidate promises to return Scarborough Grand to former glory\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Yorkshire estate known as world\u2019s first nature reserve gets Grade II listing\n\n27 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018I feel so uplifted\u2019: Yorkshire bridal shop invites \u2018real women\u2019 to model dresses\n\n7 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### Hull set to allow \u2018right to grow\u2019 on unused council land in UK first\n\n16 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### Batley library book-takers urged to return and help save building\n\n13 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### Police officer sacked after stamping on man\u2019s head during arrest in Bradford\n\n21 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### Rotherham honours Arthur Wharton, England\u2019s first black professional footballer\n\n7 Sept 2023\n\n  * ### Actor says row over free birthday cakes for her party is \u2018utterly bizarre\u2019\n\n2 Aug 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
