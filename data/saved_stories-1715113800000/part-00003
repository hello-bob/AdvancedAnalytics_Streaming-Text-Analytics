According to some commentators, this would\nbe achieved by means of a \u201ccompromise,\u201d entailing Ukrainian \u201cconcessions\u201d that\nwould somehow satisfy the Kremlin and stop the war: major territorial\ngiveaways, armed forces reduced to insignificance, no further integration with\nthe West\u2014you name it.\n\nMost of us see such views as extremely naive, given the totalitarian and\nmilitaristic nature of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Having built his rule on war\nhysteria, land grabs, imperial chauvinism, and global confrontation, Putin is\nhardly likely to stop even at a deal that most Ukrainians would find entirely\nunacceptable.\n\nBut that leads us to another problem that much of the Western media fail to\nfully appreciate: Ten years of confrontation with the Kremlin, and especially\nthe past two years of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, have fundamentally changed\nUkraine. These changes are not superficial or easily swept away.\n\nRead: The one element keeping Ukraine from total defeat\n\nA little more than a decade ago, many young Ukrainians\u2014including those, like\nmyself, from Ukraine\u2019s Russian-speaking east\u2014were angry and restless, itching\nfor something we saw just over the horizon. In high schools and universities,\nwe read Montesquieu and soaked up such tantalizing concepts as the rule of\nlaw, democracy, and human rights. Western values felt native to our\ngeneration; we were open to the world in a way that our parents had never\nimagined. Most of them had ventured no farther than Central Asia for their\nSoviet military service, or maybe Moscow for the 1980 Olympics.\n\nThis essay is adapted from I Will Show You How It Was: The Story of Wartime\nKyiv.\n\nMy peers and I wanted our country to have clean streets, polite police, and\ngovernment officials who would resign at the exposure of petty corruption\nscandals. We wanted to be able to start businesses without passing money under\nthe table, and to trust that courts of law would render justice. What we did\nnot want were irremovable, lifetime dictators who packed the government with\ncronies on the take and sent goons to beat us up in the streets.\n\nIn Kyiv\u2019s Maidan Square, starting in November 2013 and lasting into February\n2014, demonstrators showed their fervor for such a future in what became known\nas the Revolution of Dignity. Some gave their lives to unseat Viktor\nYanukovych, the kleptocratic ruler Moscow supported, and orient Ukraine\nunequivocally toward the West. At the site of desolation, armloads of flowers\ncommemorated these dead. Yanukovych fled a country that despised him and had\nspiraled out of his control.\n\nA new Ukraine began\u2014and with it, a decade-long war of independence, as the\nKremlin marked our revolution by seizing Crimea and infiltrating the Donbas\nregion in the country\u2019s east. For nearly a decade, Ukraine was fighting on two\nfronts: a military war against Russia, and an internal struggle for its\nrevolution\u2019s ideals, which meant stamping out corruption, obsolescence,\nunfreedom\u2014everything that might drag the country back into the past.\n\nUkraine is still far from achieving all that my generation once dreamed of.\nBut we do live in a country that is radically different from the Russian-\ninfluenced Ukraine of 2013\u2014politically, mentally, and culturally. And we are\nstarkly different from Putin\u2019s Russia.\n\nUkrainians have tasted freedom and experienced a competitive, vibrant\npolitical life. We elected a comedian to be our leader after he faced down an\nold-school political heavyweight in a debate that was held in a giant stadium\nin downtown Kyiv and aired live to the nation. We\u2019ve reinvented Ukrainian\nculture, generating new music, poetry, and stand-up comedy. Starting in 2014,\nwe had to build our country\u2019s armed forces almost from scratch; we are\ninsanely proud of them, as they have fought heroically against one of the\nlargest and most brutal war machines in existence.\n\nA few weeks ago, I brought my dog to a veterinarian in Bucha, the town outside\nKyiv where Russian forces committed a well-documented massacre in 2022. As the\nyoung doctor handled my dog, I noticed a large Ukrainian trident entwined with\nblue and yellow ribbons tattooed on her wrist under her white sleeve. For my\ngeneration of Ukrainians, such national symbols are an expression of pride in\nall we\u2019ve made and defended.\n\nI was with one of the first groups of journalists to enter Bucha after the\nRussian retreat in 2022. To describe the atmosphere is very difficult: I\nremember rot, stillness, a miasma of grief. The Russians had graffitied the\nletter V everywhere. On a fence along the main street: Those entering the no-\ngo zone shall be executed. V. We followed the Ukrainian police as they broke\nthrough doors into premises inhabited only by the dead. Some of the bodies\nwere charred and mutilated. I saw two males and two females lying on the\nground, incompletely burned, their mouths open and hands twisted. One looked\nto be a teenage girl.\n\nOutside the Church of Andrew the Apostle\u2014a white temple that rises high over\nBucha\u2014Ukrainian coroners in white hazmat suits carefully removed layers of\nwet, clayish soil from a mass grave and placed 67 bodies on simple wooden\ndoors under the cold drizzle. A tow truck hoisted the cadavers out one by one,\nhour by hour. Now and again, the rain would pick up, and the coroners would\nhastily cover the grave with plastic sheeting stained with dried gore.\n\n\u201cMy theory is that there was a very brutal Russian commander in charge of\nBucha,\u201d Andriy Nebytov, the chief of police for Kyiv Oblast, told reporters at\nthe church that day. \u201cAnd they unleashed hell in this place.\u201d\n\nThe Continent apartment complex used to be one of the finest in Bucha. I met a\nguy named Mykola Mosyarevych in a basketball court there. In his 30s and fit,\nhe was a likely target for the Russians\u2014a potential guerrilla fighter or\nmember of the Territorial Defense\u2014and so he\u2019d spent the whole month in a\nbasement. After the Russians left Bucha, on the day of my visit, he sat\nstaring at a pair of ripped Russian fatigues marked with the orange-and-black\nstriped ribbon of Saint George\u2014a symbol of war and love for destruction. He\nwept. Over and over again, he said: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t\nunderstand. I don\u2019t understand why they would want to do all this to us.\u201d\n\nWe all asked similar questions, and our fragmentary answers could bring little\ncomfort to Mosyarevych or anyone else: lust for power, years of aggressive\npropaganda, a sense of impunity, a would-be emperor grasping at illusion. Deep\ndown, fear.\n\nRead: Ukraine\u2019s shock will last for generations\n\nLater that day, I walked alone with my camera through what was left of a\nRussian armored column on Vokzalna Street. Bucha\u2019s defenders recalled that the\nRussians in this column had been moving carelessly and singing patriotic songs\nwhen Ukrainian forces struck their leading and trailing vehicles. The column\nstopped. The remaining Russian vehicles scrambled like bumper cars to maneuver\nthrough the wreckage, find a way out, and save themselves. But Vokzalna Street\nis narrow: They were trapped. A Ukrainian artillery strike left hardly any\nvehicle whole. The layer of ash on the ground was so thick that it crunched\nunderfoot like snow.\n\nWhat used to be a leafy green lane, part of my favorite bicycle route to Bucha\nand Hostomel, had become a cemetery. But within three weeks, Ukrainian workers\nhad cleared away the rubble and repaved the road. Later, Warren Buffett\u2019s son\ndonated funds for Ukrainian authorities to completely renovate the street and\nconstruct new, Scandinavian-style, single-family houses with lawns and picket\nfences. Online, people posted tens of thousands of likes and comments under\nimages comparing Vokzalna Street during the Russian occupation and after.\n\nSpringtime soon came, too, and with it snaking lines of cars, as thousands of\npeople who had fled poured back into their hometown days after its liberation.\nYoung mothers returned with their strollers. Time would absorb the grief and\nhorrors of this war, as it had of so many that had come before.\n\nEven so, I don\u2019t want to think about what will happen to my dog\u2019s veterinarian\nif the Russians make it back to Bucha. Or what will happen to Ukraine. After\neverything that\u2019s transpired over the past decade\u2014and especially given what\nRussia has become\u2014Ukraine must not be made a Russian colony again.\n\nToday\u2019s Russia is a neo-Stalinist dictatorship led by an aging chauvinist. In\nthe grip of his messianic delusion, Putin initiated the biggest European war\nsince World War II. He seeks to eliminate Ukraine not only as an independent\nnation, but also as an idea. No concessions or compromises are possible with\nsuch a vision\u2014not given the kind of country Ukrainians have made and fought to\ndefend.\n\nThis essay is adapted from I Will Show You How It Was: The Story of Wartime\nKyiv, published on May 7 by Bloomsbury.\n\nI Will Show You How It Was: The Story Of Wartime Kyiv\n\nBy Illia Ponomarenko\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
