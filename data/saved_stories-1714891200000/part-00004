DOI: 10.1038/s41467-024-46542-y\n\nA drug that targets a protein known as phosphatidylserine boosted the response\nrate for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving immunotherapy\nwithout compromising their safety, according to results of a phase two\nclinical trial conducted by UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nThe findings, published in Nature Communications, show the potential benefits\nof augmenting immunotherapy for this and other forms of cancer.\n\n\"This study shows the promise of improving the success of cancer\nimmunotherapies by targeting other immunomodulating proteins simultaneously,\"\nsaid study leader David Hsieh, M.D., Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine\nin the Division of Hematology and Oncology and a member of the Experimental\nTherapeutics Research Program of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer\nCenter at UT Southwestern.\n\nHCC is the most common form of liver cancer and the fourth most frequent cause\nof cancer-related deaths worldwide. For many years, the only existing\ntreatment for tumors of this kind that can't be surgically removed was a drug\ncalled sorafenib. It works by slowing the growth of tumor-feeding blood\nvessels.\n\nAlthough this targeted therapy drug was groundbreaking when it was approved by\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2007, it extends survival by only a\nfew months.\n\nMore recently, immunotherapies\u2014treatments that spur the immune system to fight\ntumors\u2014have emerged as the most effective treatments for HCC patients.\nHowever, only a fraction of patients responded to these drugs when delivered\nalone, and combining multiple immunotherapies increased the likelihood of\nserious and occasionally deadly side effects.\n\nSeveral years ago, researchers discovered that phosphatidylserine, a fatty\nsubstance called a phospholipid sometimes present on the surface of cancer\ncells, appeared to interact with immune cells to prevent them from attacking\ntumors. An antibody drug called bavituximab that neutralizes\nphosphatidylserine showed no effect on tumor response, progression, or\nsurvival when administered alone across multiple cancer types or when combined\nwith sorafenib in HCC. But bavituximab had never been tested in combination\nwith immunotherapy agents.\n\nToward that end, Dr. Hsieh and his colleagues recruited 28 patients with HCC\nreceiving care at UT Southwestern and Parkland Health. These patients, whose\ncancers couldn't be surgically removed, received imaging of their tumors at\nthe start of the study. They then received a combination of bavituximab and\npembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug approved in 2016 to treat various\ncancers.\n\nWhile receiving both therapies, these patients had periodic imaging to\ndetermine whether their tumors shrank, stopped growing, or continued to grow\nand multiply. The researchers followed these patients for an average of 28.5\nmonths.\n\nAlthough previous clinical trials had shown that only about 16% of HCC\npatients responded to pembrolizumab alone, nine patients, or 32%, responded to\nthe combined therapy. Two of them had a complete response, with no evidence of\ndisease on imaging at the end of the trial. The combined therapy halted\nprogression in another 32% of patients. For responders, the two drugs\ncontinued to shrink their tumors for a median time of 13.3 months, and four\npatients were still responding to the combination therapy when the study\nended.\n\nResearchers noted that adding bavituximab did not appear to increase side\neffects over those taking pembrolizumab alone based on data from prior\ntrials\u2014an important point showcasing this combination's safety.\n\nThese results suggest that adding agents that target phosphatidylserine to\nimmunotherapy regimens could increase the likelihood of response in HCC and\npotentially other cancers in which this protein might affect anti-cancer\nimmunity.\n\nMore information: David Hsiehchen et al, The phosphatidylserine targeting\nantibody bavituximab plus pembrolizumab in unresectable hepatocellular\ncarcinoma: a phase 2 trial, Nature Communications (2024).
