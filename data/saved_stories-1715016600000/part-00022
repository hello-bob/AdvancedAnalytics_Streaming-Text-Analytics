She smiled.\nShe seemed like a nice person. I am an Israeli graduate student at the\nuniversity, and I know holding that sign is within her rights. And yet, its\nmessage was so painful and disturbing that after that moment, I left New York\nfor a few days.\n\nIf I\u2019d had the courage, I would have asked that student, \"What exactly do you\nmean by \u2018any means necessary\u2019?\u201d Holding up signs? Leading demonstrations? Or\ndo knives also fall under that category? Guns and rifles as well? Raping and\ntaking civilians hostage? (As of this writing, 133 hostages are still being\nheld in Gaza.) And whom would these means be employed against? Columbia? The\nIsraeli government? Soldiers? Civilians? Children?\n\nSince my return to Columbia, tensions have escalated dramatically. After\nprotesters broke into Hamilton Hall on Tuesday night, the administration sent\nin the NYPD to evacuate the building and arrest the occupiers. This is the\nsecond time such measures have been taken\u2014and they may only intensify the\nfrustration and hostility of all involved. More worrying, this frustration\nmight push more students to believe that \u201cby any means necessary\u201d is the only\nway to achieve their goals.\n\nAt this point, anyone reading this essay might suspect that I am not\nobjective, and they would be absolutely right. Because if you ask me what I\nthink about when I see the words by any means necessary, it is only one thing.\nI think about Sagi: my best friend, whom I knew since sixth grade, the\nfunniest and kindest person I have ever met.\n\nOn the morning of October 7, Sagi Golan woke up at home with his boyfriend,\nOmer Ohana, whom he was supposed to marry two weeks later. They had already\nbought their beautiful white suits, and I had bought a plane ticket to the\nwedding. As a reservist, Sagi immediately headed south, where he fought\nbravely for hours at Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, saving the lives of innocent adults and\nchildren, until he was killed in combat with terrorists. One hundred civilians\nwere killed in Be\u2019eri, and 30 more were taken hostage.\n\nI am a writer who has published short stories and a novel, but the day Sagi\nwas killed, I lost my words. I couldn\u2019t get a plane ticket to Israel for the\nfuneral, so I just showed up at the airport. I was so confused and upset that\nwhen the ticketing agent tried to understand why I was trying to get on a\nplane without a ticket, I said, \u201cMy best friend ... a wedding ... a funeral\n...\u201d The agent, a complete stranger, asked if he could give me a hug. Half an\nhour later, he\u2019d arranged a one-way ticket.\n\nI landed an hour before Sagi\u2019s funeral. The flowers that were meant for my\nbest friend's wedding were laid upon his grave.\n\nMark Leibovich: House Republicans at the \u2018Liberation Camp\u2019\n\nBack in New York, I barely left my apartment. I barely ate, barely slept. By\nthat time, protests had already become routine on campus, but I was so deep in\nmy own grief that I didn\u2019t even notice. This went on for months. Toward the\nend of the fall semester, a professor took me aside after class. He told me\nthat in his youth, he\u2019d had friends who spent summers at kibbutzim in Israel,\ndescribing the people there as the nicest in the world. Neither he nor his\nfriends were Jewish, but they were captivated by the concept of a cooperative\nsocialist society. \u201cHearing about the attacks on those kibbutzim on October 7\nwas deeply painful for me,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can\u2019t even imagine how painful it\nis for you.\u201d\n\nThat professor is a strong critic of the Israeli government and its policies.\nBut in that particular moment, he chose to address only my pain. Although I\u2019m\nstill grieving and will be for a long while, his compassion helped me start to\nheal, and allowed me to better perceive the suffering of many others, Israelis\nand Palestinians, whose lives have been shattered since October 7.\n\nAs an Israeli, I despise the rhetoric emerging from certain extremist\npoliticians, who have claimed that there are no innocent civilians in Gaza or\nadvocated for a forced deportation of Palestinians. I also believe that\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go down as one of the worst\nleaders in the history of the Jewish people. His willingness to grant\npolitical power and public legitimacy to racist and fascist ideologues is a\nmoral stain on the history of the nation, and I am alarmed by the possibility\nthat Netanyahu would reject a hostage deal and a cease-fire to preserve his\nown power.\n\nBut some of the demonstrators are calling for something categorically\ndifferent from an end to the Netanyahu government or even the war. Some of\nthem are suggesting, implicitly, that there is no place for Jewish life\nbetween the river and the sea. Indeed, many of their slogans have nothing to\ndo with peace. Almost every day, I hear protesters chant \u201cBrick by brick, wall\nby wall, Israel has to fall\u201d and \u201cIntifada Revolution.\u201d Growing up in Israel\nduring the early 2000s, I lived through the Second Intifada. I witnessed buses\nblown up by suicide bombers and mass shootings in city centers, terrorist\nattacks that killed many innocent civilians in the name of an \u201cIntifada\nRevolution.\u201d\n\nRecently, a video surfaced of a student leader saying, \u201cZionists don\u2019t deserve\nto live\u201d; on campus, an individual stood in front of Jewish students with a\nsign reading Al-Qassam\u2019s next targets. In the encampment itself, signs hang\nwith small red triangles that might seem like an innocent design choice.\nWhether the protesters realize it or not, Hamas uses that icon to indicate\nIsraeli targets.\n\nI don\u2019t want to paint with too broad a brush. Bringing the NYPD onto campus on\nApril 18, when the encampment had just been established, likely contributed to\nthe escalation, and I know that off-campus bad actors, including politicians,\nare taking advantage of the volatile situation and fueling tensions. Most of\nthe student protesters are peaceful; Jews are participating in the\ndemonstrations. But most is not all. And what\u2019s significant is that many\nstudents on campus minimize or ignore extreme or violent rhetoric, and some\neven laugh and cheer along. I\u2019ve heard Columbia students claim that these\nincidents are so petty that they are not worth discussing at all. I find\nmyself debating intelligent people who treat reported facts like myths if they\ndon\u2019t align with their narrative.\n\nUniversities don\u2019t have to be battlefields. More people, including faculty and\nstudents, should speak out against hateful rhetoric that is morally wrong,\neven if this rhetoric is protected by the First Amendment. Fundamentally, I\ndon\u2019t see how the protesters\u2019 insistence on using the language of violence\nwill contribute to the Palestinian cause, or their own. They have to know that\ntheir actions have only strengthened the extreme-right political forces in the\nU.S. and Israel, who are already using these statements to consolidate more\npower. Their expressions and actions trample the voices of Israeli and\nPalestinian peace activists who advocate for complexity and compassion. And\nthey further entrench today\u2019s distorted public discourse, which demands\ncomplete conformity from people within the same group and zero compassion for\nthose in another.\n\nIddo Gefen is a Ph.D. candidate in cognitive psychology at Columbia University\nand the author of Jerusalem Beach.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
