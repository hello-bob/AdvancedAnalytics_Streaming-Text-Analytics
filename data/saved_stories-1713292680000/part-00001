Either a person who\nknows more programming languages, frameworks or has experience building\nvarious different projects.\n\nWell, technical skills certainly are important, but what really makes a big\ndifference to me is something different! Let\u2019s get into that next.\n\n##\n\nI value attitude and mindset over technical skills when recognizing the\npotential in engineers\n\nMy top traits for recognizing potential in engineers have nothing to do with\ntechnical skills. They have everything to do with the attitude and the\nmindset. I\u2019ll tell you why.\n\n> With the right attitude and mindset, you can learn all of the necessary\n> technical skills needed. And not just that, you are a great person to work\n> with and you are making others around you better because of it.\n\nThat\u2019s very important because I am looking for people who will be able to\ninspire others and help others grow, not just contribute with their technical\nknowledge.\n\nRemember, if you get better at coding for 20%, you will provide 20% more\nvalue. But if you help 5 other people to get 20% better, you will provide 100%\nmore value!\n\n##\n\nMy TOP 3 traits for recognizing the potential in engineers\n\nI believe that with these 3 traits, you can be a great engineer. Also not just\nthat, you can be good at anything you put your mind into.\n\nThese are the top 3 traits I am assessing:\n\n  * sense of ownership and responsibility,\n\n  * drive and motivation to improve,\n\n  * team player and making others around them better.\n\nYou can also be good at any of the specific paths as well. Architecture,\nmanagement or IC route, but there are certain nuances, to which path might be\nbetter suited for you.\n\nYou can read about my personal recommendation for specific career paths here:\nWhich is the right engineering career path for you? (paid article).\n\n##\n\nHow I recognize the sense of ownership and responsibility\n\nThere are a number of different indicators which showcase a good sense of\nownership and responsibility, here are the most prominent ones for me:\n\n  * They are volunteering for projects when nobody wants to take the initiative\n\nThere are always recurring issues coming up and they may be hard to tackle.\nThe person that will tackle them and put in the effort to resolve them, will\nprovide a lot of value to the team and overall organization. Not just by\nresolving them, but because that person inspires others to do the same.\n\n  * They are making suggestions for improvements and then take the initiative to implement them.\n\nIt shows that a person wants to make things better across the team and\norganization and not just focus on their own tasks.\n\n  * They are proactive\n\nThey don't wait for tasks to be assigned to them but they are proactively\nsearching for the most impactful things to work on. Also, they don't need\ndetailed requirements but they can tackle the problem and find the best\nsolution to it via communicating with the right people.\n\n  * They are the one who actually writes down the plan when the team is discussing about it\n\nThat\u2019s very important because it shows to me that the person actually was able\nto gather all opinions together and formulate a plan, which the whole team\nagreed upon.\n\n##\n\nHow I recognize drive and motivation for improving\n\nWhat\u2019s great about our industry is that there is always something new to\nlearn. Great engineers are continuous learners and they understand how\nimportant self-improvement is.\n\nHere are the main indicators for me:\n\n  * They are passionate about new technologies or new concepts\n\nYou can just feel it talking with them, that they like what they are doing and\nare always on the lookout for how they can improve their knowledge and skills\nin various of different areas. That kind of behavior is contagious and\neveryone in the team naturally becomes more prone to learning new things.\n\n  * They are regularly sharing their knowledge with others\n\nThey love to do good code reviews and they are teaching, helping others and\nsharing their knowledge. That can also be via organizing learning sessions for\nthe team or across the organization.\n\n  * They like to read or listen\n\nThey are always looking for a new book to read or a new conference to attend\nin order to learn and improve.\n\n  * They like to write\n\nA great indicator is if they are writing a personal blog or a newsletter. It\ntells me that they love sharing their knowledge and helping others to grow as\nwell. Especially because they are taking their own personal time to do it.\n\n##\n\nHow I recognize a team player and that they are making others around them\nbetter.\n\nIf you missed my previous newsletter article called \"Great teams build great\nsoftware\u201d, I definitely recommend reading it. I\u2019ve noted down why good\nteamwork is very important in our industry and why I value engineers who show\ngreat teamwork a LOT. You can read it here: Great teams build great software.\n\nHere are the most prominent indicators for me:\n\n  * They have the give first mentality\n\nThey understand that great relationships start with giving first. They are\nalways looking for ways to help others and they are offering their help when\nthey see people are in need.\n\n  * They are always thinking what\u2019s going to be the best for the team\n\nThey are not just blindly building things based on requirements, but they\nreally want to understand the problem and motivation behind it and find a\nsolution that would provide the most value to the team or the overall\norganization.\n\n  * Others like working with them\n\nThey have a \u201cmagnetic\u201d type of effect where others are just naturally prone to\nlike to work with them. They are able to inspire and others feel like they are\ngrowing around them.\n\n  * They put effort into building good relationships with people in the team and overall organization\n\nThey understand how important good relationships are and how much easier is to\ncollaborate with people when you have been able to build a great relationship\nwith them.\n\n##\n\nLast words\n\nIt\u2019s very interesting that in the engineering industry the main traits I look\nfor are not related to technical skills. Well, that\u2019s because building\nsoftware is a social activity and just people working in silos would provide\nmore issues than benefits.\n\nBe a great person to work with and focus on helping others - it will\ndrastically increase your value in our great industry that we all love and\nenjoy being in!\n\nLiked this article?
