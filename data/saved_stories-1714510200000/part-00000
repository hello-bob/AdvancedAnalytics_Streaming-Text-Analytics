The tool was born out of frustration with github\u2019s point and click\nweb UI. Since I do a lot of code review, the tabbing between my text editor\nand my browser became a constant source of friction.\n\nIdeally, I wanted to stay in my text editor so that my code writing and code\nreviewing workflows could be unified. I didn\u2019t find any such tool on the\ninternet so I built my own.\n\n### Demo\n\nConsider the following pull request:\n\nTo download the PR for review:\n\n    \n    \n    $ prr get danobi/prr-test-repo/2 /home/dxu/dev/review/danobi/prr-test-repo/2.prr\n\nWhen you open the review file, you\u2019ll see:\n\n    \n    \n    > diff --git a/ch4.txt b/ch4.txt > index 41e1932..8741175 100644 > --- a/ch4.txt > +++ b/ch4.txt > @@ -16,6 +16,10 @@ CHAPTER 4. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS > > 8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence. > > +HERE IS SOME CONTENT I'M TRYING TO ADD > +LALALALLALALALALAL > +LALAL > + > 9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\" > > 10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.\n\nNow suppose you want to have the author remove the extraneous edits and reject\nthe PR because of it. Simply mark up the review file as follows:\n\n    \n    \n    @prr reject > diff --git a/ch4.txt b/ch4.txt > index 41e1932..8741175 100644 > --- a/ch4.txt > +++ b/ch4.txt > @@ -16,6 +16,10 @@ CHAPTER 4.

To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.\n\nTwo things to note:\n\n  1. We can use prr directives by \u201ctagging\u201d @prr. Just like how you might use a github bot.\n  2. We added a \u201cspanned\u201d comment on the hunk by adding a newline before the start of the span.\n\nTo submit the review back to github, run:\n\n    \n    \n    $ prr submit danobi/prr-test-repo/2\n\nYou\u2019ll now see something like this on github:\n\n(Note that you don\u2019t see the \u201cChanges requested\u201d in this example because\ngithub doesn\u2019t let you request changes on your own PR. It should work on a\nreal PR.)\n\n### Looking forward\n\nThe above demo shows off most of the features I\u2019ve currently implemented.\nThere\u2019s still a few things I want to add but they\u2019re not too pressing as I\u2019m\ncurrently using prr every day just fine.\n\nIf you wanna try out prr or request new features, feel free to file an issue\nor open a PR at https://github.com/danobi/prr .\n\n", "frontpage": false}
