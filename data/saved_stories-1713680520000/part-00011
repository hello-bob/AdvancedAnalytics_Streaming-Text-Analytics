Can it rediscover its engineering soul?\n\nBy Jerry Useem\n\nIllustration by The Atlantic. Source: Getty.\n\nApril 20, 2024, 8 AM ET\n\nThe sight of Bill Boeing was a familiar one on the factory floor. His office\nwas in the building next to the converted boatyard where workers lathed the\nwood, sewed the fabric wings, and fixed the control wires of the Boeing Model\nC airplane. there is no authority except facts. facts are obtained by accurate\nobservation read a plaque affixed outside the door. And what could need closer\nobservation than the process of his aircraft being built? One day in 1916,\nBoeing spotted an imperfectly cut wing rib, dropped it to the floor, and\nslowly stomped it to bits. \u201cI, for one, will close up shop rather than send\nout work of this kind,\u201d he declared.\n\nWhen David Calhoun, the soon-to-be-lame-duck CEO of the company Boeing\nfounded, made a rare appearance on the shop floor in Seattle one day this past\nJanuary, circumstances were decidedly different. Firmly a member of the CEO\nclass, schooled at the knee of General Electric\u2019s Jack Welch, Calhoun had not\nstrolled over from next door but flown some 2,300 miles from Boeing\u2019s\nheadquarters in Arlington, Virginia. And he was not there to observe slipshod\nwork before it found its way into the air\u2014it already had. A few weeks earlier,\nthe door of a Boeing 737 had fallen out mid-flight. In the days following his\nvisit, Calhoun\u2019s office admitted that it still didn\u2019t know quite what had gone\nwrong, because it didn\u2019t know how the plane had been put together in the first\nplace. The door\u2019s restraining bolts had either been screwed in wrong, or not\nat all. Boeing couldn\u2019t say, because, as it told astonished regulators, the\ncompany had \u201cno records of the work being performed.\u201d\n\nThe two scenes tell us the peculiar story of a plane maker that, over 25\nyears, slowly but very deliberately extracted itself from the business of\nmaking planes. For nearly 40 years the company built the 737 fuselage itself\nin the same plant that turned out its B-29 and B-52 bombers. In 2005 it sold\nthis facility to a private-investment firm, keeping the axle grease at arm\u2019s\nlength and notionally shifting risk, capital costs, and labor woes off its\nbooks onto its \u201csupplier.\u201d Offloading, Boeing called it. Meanwhile the tail,\nlanding gear, flight controls, and other essentials were outsourced to\nfactories around the world owned by others, and shipped to Boeing for final\nassembly, turning the company that created the Jet Age into something akin to\na glorified gluer-together of precast model-airplane kits. Boeing\u2019s latest\nscrewups vividly dramatize a point often missed in laments of America\u2019s\nmanufacturing decline: that when global economic forces carried off some U.S.\nmanufacturers for good, even the ones that stuck around lost interest in\nactually making stuff.\n\nThe past 30 years may well be remembered as a dark age of U.S. manufacturing.\nBoeing\u2019s decline illustrates everything that went wrong to bring us here.\nFortunately, it also offers a lesson in how to get back out.\n\nIn Bill Boeing\u2019s day, the word manufactory had cachet. You could bank at the\nManufacturers Trust. Philadelphia socialites golfed at the Manufacturers\u2019\nClub. Plans for the newly consecrated Harvard Business School called for a\nworking factory on campus. The business heroes of the day\u2014Ford, Edison,\nFirestone\u2014had risen from the shop floor.\n\nThere, they had pioneered an entirely new way of making things. The American\nsystem of production\u2014featuring interchangeable parts, specialized machine\ntools, moving assembly lines\u2014was a huge leap beyond European methods of craft\nproduction. And it produced lopsided margins of victory for the likes of Ford,\nGM, and Boeing. To coordinate these complex new systems, two new occupations\narose: the industrial engineer, who spoke the language of the shop floor, and\nthe professional financial manager, who spoke the language of accounting.\n\nCharlie Warzel: Flying is weird right now\n\nAt first the engineers held sway. In a 1930 article for Aviation News, a\nBoeing engineer explained how the company\u2019s inspectors \u201ccontinually supervise\nthe fabrication of the many thousands of parts entering into the assemblage of\na single plane.\u201d Philip Johnson, an engineer, succeeded Bill Boeing as CEO; he\nthen passed the company to yet another engineer, Clairmont Egtvedt, who not\nonly managed production of the B-17 bomber from the executive suite, but\npersonally helped design it.\n\nAfter the Second World War, America enjoyed three decades of dominance by\nsticking with methods it had used to win it. At the same time, a successor was\ndeveloping, largely unnoticed, amid the scarcities of defeated Japan. The\nupstart auto executive Eiji Toyoda had visited Ford\u2019s works and found that,\nhowever much he admired the systems, they couldn\u2019t be replicated in Japan. He\ncouldn\u2019t afford, for instance, the hundreds of machine tools specialized to\npunch out exactly one part at the touch of a button. Although his employees\nwould have to make do with a few general-purpose stamping presses, he gave\nthese skilled workers immense freedom to find the most efficient way to run\nthem. The end result turned out to be radical: Costs fell and errors dropped\nin a renewable cycle of improvement, or kaizen.\n\nWhat emerged was a different conception of the corporation. If the managerial\nbureaucrats in the other departments were to earn their keep, they needed a\nthorough understanding of the shop floor, or gemba (roughly \u201cplace of making\nvalue\u201d). The so-called Gemba Walk required their routine presence at each step\nuntil they could comprehend the assembly of the whole. Otherwise they risked\nbecoming muda\u2014waste.\n\nWhen the wave of Japanese competition finally crashed on corporate America,\nthose best equipped to understand it\u2014the engineers\u2014were no longer in charge.\nAmerican boardrooms had been handed over to the finance people. And they were\nhypnotized by the new doctrine of shareholder value, which provided a\nrationale for their ascendance but little incentive for pursuing long-term\nimprovements or sustainable approaches to cost control. Their pay packages\nrewarded short-term spikes in stock price. There were lots of ways to produce\nthose.\n\nWhich brings us to the hinge point of 1990, when a trio of MIT researchers\npublished The Machine That Changed the World, which both named the Japanese\nsystem\u2014\u201clean production\u201d\u2014and urged corporate America to learn from it. Just\nthen, the Japanese economy crashed, easing the pressure on U.S. firms. In the\nyears that followed, American manufacturers instead doubled down on\noutsourcing, offshoring, and financial engineering. This round of wounds was\nself-inflicted. Already infused with a stench of decay, manufacturing was\nwritten off as yesterday\u2019s activity.\n\nAt GE, which produced three of Boeing\u2019s last four CEOs, manufacturing came to\nbe seen as \u201cgrunt work,\u201d as the former GE executive David Cote recently told\nFortune\u2019s Shawn Tully. Motorola\u2014founded as Galvin Manufacturing and famed for\nits religious focus on quality\u2014lost its lead in mobile-phone making after it\nleaned into software and services. Intel\u2019s bunny-suited fab workers were the\nface of high-tech manufacturing prowess until the company ceded hardware\nleadership to Asian rivals. \u201cHaving once pioneered the development of this\nextraordinary technology,\u201d the current Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger, wrote\nrecently, \u201cwe now find ourselves at the mercy of the most fragile global\nsupply chain in the world.\u201d\n\nPhil Condit, the talented engineer who had overseen design of the hugely\nsuccessful 777, was atop Boeing when I visited the company in late 2000. He\nwas no stranger to the shop floor. Traversing Boeing\u2019s Everett plant in a golf\ncart, he pointed out the horizontal tail fin stretching above us. Hard to\nbelieve it was larger than the 737\u2019s wing, he marveled. Waiting back in his\noffice\u2014still located on the bank of the Duwamish River but greatly swollen by\nthe recent merger with McDonnell Douglas\u2014was a different sort of glee. \u201cWow!\nDouble wow!\u201d his mother had emailed him, referring to Boeing\u2019s closing stock\nprice that day. And, it would soon emerge, he wanted to get some distance from\nwhat he described to the Puget Sound Business Journal as \u201chow-do-you-design-\nan-airplane stuff.\u201d The next year, he moved Boeing\u2019s headquarters to Chicago,\npulling the top brass away from the shop floor just as the company was\nembarking on a radically new approach to airplane assembly.\n\nIts newest plane, the 787 Dreamliner, would not be an in-house production.\nInstead Boeing would farm out the designing and building to a network of\n\u201cpartner\u201d companies\u2014each effectively its own mini-Boeing with its own supply\nchain to manage. \u201cIt used to be you\u2019d have some Boeing people develop the\nblueprints, then march over and say, \u2018Hey, would you build this for me?\u2019\u201d\nRichard Safran, an analyst at Seaport Research Partners and a former aerospace\nengineer, told me. \u201cNow, instead, you\u2019re asking them to design it, to\nintegrate it, to do the R&D.\u201d\n\nThe allures of this \u201ccapital light\u201d approach were many: Troublesome unions,\ncostly machine shops, and development budgets would all become someone else\u2019s\nproblem. Key financial metrics would instantly improve as costs shifted to\nother firms\u2019 balance sheets. With its emphasis on less, the approach bore a\nsuperficial resemblance to lean production. But where lean production pushed\nknow-how back onto the shop floor, this pushed the shop floor and its know-how\nout the door altogether.\n\nBeyond that were the problems that a Boeing engineer, L. J. Hart-Smith, had\nforeseen in a prescient white paper that he presented at a 2001 Boeing\ntechnical symposium. With outsourcing came the possibility that parts wouldn\u2019t\nfit together correctly on arrival. \u201cIn order to minimize these potential\nproblems,\u201d Hart-Smith warned, \u201cit is necessary for the prime contractor to\nprovide on-site quality, supplier-management, and sometimes technical support.\nIf this is not done, the performance of the prime manufacturer can never\nexceed the capabilities of the least proficient of the suppliers.\u201d\n\nBoeing didn\u2019t listen. Wall Street dismissed Hart-Smith\u2019s paper as a \u201crant,\u201d\nand Boeing put each supplier in charge of its own quality control. When those\ncontrols failed, Boeing had to bear the cost of fixing flawed components. Most\ntroubling was the dangerous feedback loop Hart-Smith foresaw. Accounting-wise,\nthose fixes, which in reality are the costs of outsourcing, would instead\nappear as overhead\u2014creating the impression that in-house work was expensive\nand furthering the rationale for offloading even more of the manufacturing\nprocess.\n\nIn the short term, this all worked wonders on Boeing\u2019s balance sheet: Its\nstock rose more than 600 percent from 2010 to 2019. Then the true folly of\nthis approach made its inevitable appearance when two strikingly similar\ncrashes caused by faulty software on Boeing planes killed a total of 346\npeople.\n\nJames Surowiecki: What\u2019s gone wrong at Boeing\n\nToday, if you stand along the Seattle waterfront long enough, sooner or later\nyou\u2019ll catch sight of a train headed south carrying the distinctive shape of a\nBoeing 737. Though it\u2019s colored a metallic green and missing its tail\u2014clearly\nnot the finished product\u2014it\u2019s the kind of thing you point to and say, Look\nkids, a Boeing plane\u2019s on that train! Not so. The logomark on the side spells\nit out: Spirit AeroSystems of Wichita, Kansas, has built this fuselage, which\nisn\u2019t coming from Boeing. It\u2019s going to Boeing.\n\nA plane is a complex system in which the malfunction of one piece can produce\ncatastrophic failure of the whole. Assembly must be tightly choreographed. But\nnow\u2014especially with Boeing continually trying to wring costs from its\nsuppliers\u2014there were many more chances for errors to creep in. And when FAA\ninvestigators finally toured the premises of Spirit AeroSystems\u2014maker of the\nblown-out door as well as the fuselage it was supposed to fit in\u2014they did not\nfind a tight operation. They found one door seal being lubricated with Dawn\nliquid dish soap and cleaned with a wet cheesecloth, and another checked with\na hotel-room key card.\n\nA dark age doesn\u2019t descend all at once. The process of emerging from one also\ntakes time. It must begin with a recognition that something has been lost.\nBoeing\u2019s fall just might have provided that rush of clarity. You could be from\nthe 12th century and still know that soap and cheesecloth aren\u2019t for making\nflying machines. Boeing\u2019s chief financial officer recently admitted that the\ncompany got \u201ca little too far ahead of itself on the topic of outsourcing.\u201d It\nis in talks to reacquire Spirit AeroSystems and is already making the\ncomposite wings of its next-gen plane, the 777X, in-house at a new, billion-\ndollar complex outside Seattle. \u201cAerospace Executives Finally Rediscover the\nShop Floor,\u201d Aviation Week declared on the cover of a recent issue.\n\nAs for the rest of corporate America, one of the strongest signals may be\ncoming from the company Boeing has striven so hard to emulate: GE. Under\noperations-minded boss Larry Culp, the company is finally\u2014only 40 or so years\nlate\u2014pushing itself through a crash course in lean manufacturing. It is\nbelatedly yielding to the reality that workers on the gemba are far better at\nfiguring out more efficient ways of making things than remote bureaucrats with\nspreadsheet abstractions.\n\nIn the crucial field of semiconductors, meanwhile, Intel has recognized that\nMoore\u2019s Law (the doubling of computing power roughly every 18 months) flows\nnot from above but from manufacturing advances it once dominated. It has\nundertaken a \u201cdeath march,\u201d in the words of CEO Pat Gelsinger, to regain its\nlost edge on the foundry floor. The CHIPS Act has put a powerful political\nwind at his back. Green and other incentives are powering a broader, truly\nseismic surge in spending on new U.S. factories, now going up at three times\ntheir normal rate. No other country is experiencing such a buildout.\n\nAdd all the capacity you want. It won\u2019t reverse the country\u2019s long decline as\na manufacturing superpower if corporate America keeps gurgling its sad, tired\nstory about the impossibility of making things on these shores anymore. It\u2019s a\nstory that helped pour a whole lot of wealth into the executive pockets\npeddling it. But half a century of self-inflicted damage is enough. The doors\nhave fallen off, and it\u2019s plain for all to see: The story was barely bolted\ntogether.\n\nSupport for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett\nFoundation.\n\nJerry Useem is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and has covered business\nand economics for The New York Times, Fortune, and other publications.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
