From 1984\nto 1985 he was Visiting Professor at the University of Maryland, USA. From\n1986 to 1989 he was Chairman of the Finnish Artificial Intelligence Society.\nFrom 1989 to 2007, he was Research Professor at the VTT Technical Research\nCentre of Finland. He retired in 2007.\n\n## Backpropagation[edit]\n\nExplicit, efficient error backpropagation in arbitrary, discrete, possibly\nsparsely connected, neural networks-like networks was first described in\nLinnainmaa's 1970 master's thesis,^[2]^[5] albeit without reference to\nNNs,^[6] when he introduced the reverse mode of automatic differentiation\n(AD), in order to efficiently compute the derivative of a differentiable\ncomposite function that can be represented as a graph, by recursively applying\nthe chain rule to the building blocks of the function.^[4]^[2]^[5]^[7]\nLinnainmaa published it first, following Gerardi Ostrowski who had used it in\nthe context of certain process models in chemical engineering some five years\nearlier, but didn't publish.\n\nWith faster computers emerging, the method has become heavily used in numerous\napplications. For example, backpropagation of errors in multi-layer\nperceptrons, a technique used in machine learning, is a special case of\nreverse mode AD^[further explanation needed].\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Ellonen, Leena, ed.
