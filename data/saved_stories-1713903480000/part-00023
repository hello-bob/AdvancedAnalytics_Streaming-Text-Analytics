The amount of PFAS entering the atmosphere\nthis way may be comparable to or greater than the contributions of other\nsources such as industrial plants, according to a study published in Science.\n\n> \u201cEven if we completely stop the use of PFAS right now, we will still have\n> this circulation between the air and seawater.\u201d\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\nManufacturers add PFAS to household items to make them water- and stain-\nresistant. The chemicals don\u2019t break down in the environment and instead\naccumulate in soils, plants, animals, and water bodies, earning them the\nnickname \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d Exposure to PFAS is linked to a host of human\nhealth issues such as liver dysfunction, kidney and testicular cancer, and\nreproductive problems.\n\nSome governments have limited the use of certain PFAS types. But even long-\nrestricted PFAS could still be circulating in the atmosphere, thanks to sea\nspray.\n\n\u201cEven if we completely stop the use of PFAS right now, we will still have this\ncirculation between the air and seawater,\u201d said Bo Sha, an environmental\nchemist at Stockholm University and lead author of the study. \u201cAnd we will\nstill have low-level exposure to these PFAS for a relatively long time.\u201d\n\n### Airborne PFAS\n\nAs tiny air bubbles in the ocean rise to the surface, they collect PFAS. When\nthose bubbles burst, they catapult PFAS back into the atmosphere in the form\nof aerosols. Because of their surfactant qualities, PFAS are an outlier: Most\nother pollutants in the environment aren\u2019t usually transported via sea spray,\nsaid Cora Young, an environmental chemist at York University in Toronto who\nwas not involved in the new study.\n\nThe study analyzed data from field experiments on an Atlantic Ocean research\ncruise. Researchers simulated sea spray using fresh seawater that was\ncontinuously pumped into a simulation chamber. Researchers then measured the\nemissions of two PFAS chemicals\u2014PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS\n(perfluorooctane sulfonic acid)\u2014in the resulting aerosols.\n\nThe researchers estimated that globally, about 49 tons of PFOA and 26 tons of\nPFOS are emitted each year through remobilization via sea spray aerosols.\nThose values are similar to or higher than many estimates of the contribution\nof atmospheric PFOA and PFOS pollution from industrial manufacturing.\n\n\u201cKnowing how much PFAS is in the atmosphere is critical, because things in the\natmosphere just move faster and end up with a greater extent of transport,\u201d\nYoung said. \u201cThis work has really increased our understanding of what this\nlooks like in the real environment.\u201d\n\nThough the new study measured only two types of PFAS, other PFAS chemicals\nlikely behave similarly, Young added.\n\nJana Johansson operates the sea spray simulator aboard RSS Discovery.

Coastal water\nwould likely have more dissolved organic matter, which could interact with\nPFAS and affect the remobilization process, Sha said.\n\n> \u201cThis remobilization emphasizes how important it is to stop new sources [of\n> PFAS] or limit them as best we can.\u201d\n\nThe researchers estimated that 15%\u201330% of the PFAS emitted from sea spray\neventually reach land. There, they may contaminate drinking water sources in\ncoastal areas (which has been observed in the Netherlands) or affect coastal\nwildlife health. PFAS exposure from the atmosphere is still likely a small\nproportion of the total PFAS exposure coastal communities get via household\nproducts and drinking water, Sha said.\n\nThe results underscore just how persistent PFAS are in the environment and how\nsignificant atmospheric deposition of the chemicals can be even for regions\nfar from populations, Young said. There aren\u2019t effective ways to remove large\namounts of PFAS from the ocean, so \u201cthis remobilization emphasizes how\nimportant it is to stop new sources [of PFAS] or limit them as best we can,\u201d\nshe explained.\n\nMore research is needed to fully describe the effect of this remobilization\nprocess on coastal communities, Sha said.\n\n\u2014Grace van Deelen (@GVD__), Staff Writer\n\n##### Citation: Van Deelen, G.
