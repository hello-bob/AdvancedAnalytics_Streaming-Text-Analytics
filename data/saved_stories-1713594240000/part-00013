The location was terrible, in the back of\na fried chicken restaurant in Stoughton, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1988, baseball cards took the world by storm. However, the craze had\nstarted to take hold a few years earlier.\n\nCard collecting had existed for decades, but by the early 1980s, access to\ncards quickly improved.\n\nConvenience stores, some toy stores (remember KB Toys?), and department stores\n(Sears et al.) were typically the only places to buy cards.\n\nThe 1991 Sears Holiday Catalog was one of the places to get your cards during\nthe Junk Era. Image source (https://christmas.musetechnical.com/)\n\nBy the late 80's, baseball card stores were popping up in every local city and\ntown.\n\nAnd now, youngsters and even adults were opting for storing cards in hard\nplastic instead of flipping them in between bike spokes.\n\nBaseball cards would soon become the new avenue to newfound wealth... so we\nall thought.\n\nI heard the old man on pawn stars say that 'if it's made as a collectible or\ncollector's item, then it has no long term value.\n\nI wish someone would have schooled me on that principle 30+ years ago when I\nwent all in on new product\"\n\n#### Collector, Brent Ingram\n\nNet54 Forums (source)\n\nCollectors took notice of premier vintage cards like the 1952 Topps Mickey\nMantle and T206 Honus Wagner, which were setting records at auction.\n\nThe thinking at the time was that baseball cards of the 1980s would be the\nnext 1952 Mantles. Boy, were we wrong.\n\n## By All Accounts, 1986 Was The Start Of The Junk Wax Era\n\nThroughout the early 1980s, Donruss, Fleer, and Topps were the sole licensed\nmanufacturers of baseball cards.\n\nBy 1986, the card companies took notice of the massive demand from collectors\nand the corresponding bubble forming within the sports card market.\n\n1986 Topps Wade Boggs card\n\nCompanies started printing sets into the multiple millions. In 1986, it is\nestimated that Topps produced over one billion total cards.\n\nThe designs were basic and generic. Shiny cards, serial numbered cards or\ncertified autograph cards were not yet developed during this era of\ncollecting.\n\nAnd while Fleer and Donruss's print run was nothing to sneeze at, it felt at\nthe time that their printing presses weren't exactly running at the same\nextended rate as Topps, which had the largest market share of any company.\n\nEstimated Print Runs For Major Baseball Card Companies from 1986 to 1993\n(source my research and NET54 forum)\n\nCollectors soon became enamored by the rookie cards of upcoming prospects such\nas Wally Joyner, Fred McGriff, Jose Canseco, and Pete Incaviglia.\n\nA 1986 Donruss Rated Rookie Fred McGriff Rookie card\n\nIn 1987, all three of the big three baseball card companies started to\naccelerate production runs. And it was an outstanding year to collect rookie\ncards.\n\nRuben Sierra, Barry Bonds, Matt Williams, and Barry Larkin were ripping up the\nbig leagues.\n\nBased on my estimates of production runs, by 1987, Topps was producing at\nleast 2.5 Million copies of each card in its 792 card set.\n\nEstimates of Donruss and Fleer print runs were at roughly 1/3 of that total in\n1987, but they both caught up to Topps within a few years.\n\nAt the time, the 1987 Topps set seemed like a can't miss investment, but\nlittle did collectors know that Topps was printing each card in the multiple\nmillions.\n\n## The First Premium Issue - 1989 Upper Deck\n\nThere was also a new premium manufacturer with a license to print - Upper\nDeck. Upper Deck changed the game in 1989, with new premium-priced foil packs\nholding the key rookie card of the late 1990s, one Ken Griffey Jr.\n\nAccording to the documentary 'Jack of All Trades,' released in 2019, an\nestimated 2 million 1989 Upper Deck Ken Griffey Jr. rookie cards were\nproduced, with Upper Deck printing these cards over three years.\n\n1989 Upper Deck Ken Griffey Jr, the rookie card that drove collectors crazy in\nthe late 90s\n\nThe Ken Griffey Jr. Upper Deck rookie was so popular that many card shops had\nfans lined up wanting to get or pull one out of a pack.\n\nThe Upper Deck Griffey Jr craze was the poster child for the problems in the\nhobby: collectors chasing a perceived 'rare' rookie card when, in fact,\nmillions of copies existed.\n\nFollowing the Griffey craze, a storm was brewing with collectors, now akin to\nWall Street traders and no longer innocent collectors of cardboard.\n\nThe belief at the time was that amassing rookie cards of can't miss prospects\nwas a surefire way to make the big bucks.\n\nKevin Maas 1990 Upper Deck rookie card was one of the big chase cards in the\nearly 90s\n\nI remember buying 30 1990 Kevin Maas Upper Deck cards, thinking he was the\nnext great Yankee and his cards would be an excellent investment.\n\nBut eventually, Maas never panned out, and like others, soon realized the\ncards were not rare and massively overproduced.\n\n#### There was an immense bubble in play, with collectors ripping open $5+\npacks of cards and soon realizing that the fortunes they hoped to build were\nimpossible.\n\n## Hobby Demand Drives More Premium Baseball Card Offerings\n\nDue to the insane demand in the hobby, manufacturers started to broaden their\nofferings, attempting to reach deeper-pocketed collectors with higher-priced\nwax packs.\n\nThe first premium-priced baseball card offerings included (among others):\n\n  * Flair and Ultra (from Fleer)\n  * Pinnacle (from Score)\n  * Leaf and Studio (from Donruss)\n  * Stadium Club and Finest (from Topps)\n  * SP (from Upper Deck)\n\nA 1994 Flair baseball pack--one of the more expensive issued packs of the era.\nAt retail, packs were selling for around $5.\n\nIn 1994, the baseball strike threw a curveball at the hobby, bringing\ncollecting to a standstill and triggering a massive downturn. New card stores,\nincluding my brother's cherished Card Connection, were forced to close their\ndoors.\n\nThe allure of baseball cards as a surefire investment faded, as collectors\ncame to grips with the harsh reality\u2014their treasured cards were worth merely a\nfraction of their anticipated value.\n\nHowever, the Junk Wax Era had its redeeming facets. It compelled card\ncompanies to reassess their approaches, laying the groundwork for a more\nequitable supply-and-demand model that has since become a fundamental aspect\nof the sports card hobby.\n\n## The Junk Wax Era: Not All Doom and Gloom\n\nThis era of collecting did feature several rare error cards and limited\nedition sets that are still highly sought after today.\n\n### The rarest error card of the Junk Era is the 1990 Topps Frank Thomas No\nName Error Card.\n\nThe 1990 Topps Frank Thomas Error Card - a notable error where Frank Thomas's\nname is omitted\n\nThis card has garnered high demand, with significant appreciation over recent\nyears. Its rarity is underscored by many collectors opening multiple cases of\n1990 Topps packs without snagging a single one.\n\nIt's speculated that fewer than 500 copies are in circulation, a notion\nsupported by the limited sales activity\u2014only five transactions on eBay in the\npast three months and only three listings as of October 2023.\n\nThis elusive gem continues to elude many, making it a prized possession in the\nhobby.\n\n### The Emergence of Limited Edition Specialty Sets and Short-Printed Cards\n\nDuring this period, some card companies began creating new and innovative\nsets,\n\nTopps and Fleer introduced regular 'Tiffany' and 'Glossy' sets for its base\nsets and traded/ update issues. The cards were identical to the base issues,\nbut featured a UV glossy coating which distinguished the cards versus their\nmatte counterparts.\n\nThe 1987 Fleer Glossy set which was issued in this super cool collectible tin\nholder.\n\nTwo of the most collectible Topps Tiffany rookie cards are the 1989 Topps\nTiffany Traded Ken Griffey Jr. rookie card and the 1990 Frank Thomas Tiffany\nrookie card.\n\nTiffany/Glossy cards were short-printed with only a fraction of the production\nversus the regular base issues.\n\nThe 1989 Topps Tiffany Traded Ken Griffey Jr is one of the more collectible\ncards of the era.\n\nMany other Topps Tiffany rookie cards are pretty popular in today\u2019s hobby and\nwere one of the more underrated types of cards created during the \u2018Junk Wax\nEra\u2019.\n\n#### One set that sticks out is the 1992 Fleer Update set\n\nThe set was limited in comparison to a lot of other sets that were produced\nduring this era.\n\nThe key card from this set is the Mike Piazza rookie card, signed and slabbed\nexamples are limited and become tougher to find!\n\n#### 1991 Topps Desert Shield Is Another Standout Set Of The Junk Era\n\nIn 1991, Topps crafted a distinctive set of cards considerably rarer than\ntheir standard versions. These special edition cards were dispatched to the\ntroops stationed in the Middle East, yet a large number of them were\ndiscarded.\n\nThe scarcity of these cards has escalated over time, making them increasingly\nelusive for collectors.\n\nAmong this rare set, the Chipper Jones rookie card stands out as the crown\njewel, earning a reputation as his most valued card among aficionados.\n\n### 1993 was a pivotal year in card collecting\n\nIn 1993, card manufacturers started to create many rarer print runs of\nspecific cards, better known as \"parallels\" today.\n\nA few examples would be 1993 Topps Finest baseball cards featuring the first\never Refractor shine on a card, which today is still very relevant.\n\nArguably, the best card created in 1993 was the Upper Deck SP Foil Rookie\ncard. SP cards were short-printed in comparison to many other cards of the\ntime.\n\nTopps baseball that year also featured various parallels of Jeter\u2019s rookie\ncard which included Topps Gold, Topps Rockies/Marlins Inaugural, Topps Mini\nand more.\n\n## Is The Junk Era Happening Again Today?\n\nSome collectors and buyers now refer to the current period as the 'Junk Slab\nEra', indicating a trend where a vast number of common or non-rare cards are\nbeing graded en masse.\n\nFor instance, several key basketball rookie base Prizm cards have already\ngarnered 20,000 PSA 10 grades. A concerning aspect of this trend is that many\nbase cards, once graded, fail to retain even the value of the grading fee.\n\nThis Rhys Hoskins rookie card was for sale recently on eBay for under $6, less\nthan 1/4 of the average PSA grading fee.\n\nFor example, the market is flooded with graded cards priced between $5 to $20,\nwhile the lowest grading fee at PSA stands at $20 to $25.\n\nThis scenario reflects an alarming similarity to the overproduction issue of\nthe Junk Wax Era, albeit in a modern context with graded cards.\n\n## In Closing\n\nThe aftermath of the Junk Wax Era, characterized by excessive card production,\nled to waning interest among collectors.\n\nHowever, as the mid-1990s approached, the advent of card grading rekindled\nenthusiasm in the hobby, reintroducing a supply and demand dynamic.\n\nThe emergence of eBay soon after significantly impacted the sports card\nmarket, providing a platform for buying and selling that propelled the hobby\nforward.\n\nThe repercussions of the era also saw many card-producing companies either\nbeing acquired or facing bankruptcy.\n\nLessons learned from this period guided card companies towards a more balanced\napproach in manufacturing, ensuring a sustained demand and value for sports\ncards in the subsequent years.\n\nPrevious\n\nNext\n\nAll Vintage Cards\n\n##### About the author\n\nChris Rogers, is the founder of All Vintage Cards.
