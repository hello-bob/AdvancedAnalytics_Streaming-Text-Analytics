Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# PCIe 5.0 is nearly four years old and it's still virtually worthless in\ngaming PCs\n\nFeatures\n\nBy Nick Evanson\n\npublished 7 hours ago\n\nGen 4 stuff is not only cheaper, it's also better. Now that's progress for\nyou.\n\n(Image credit: Asus)\n\nNick Evanson, Hardware writer\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThis month I've been testing: Not very much, actually! Well, a spot of cable-\nhiding tech by Asus and one of Gigabyte's latest laptops, but I've mostly been\ntesting out a new display panel colorimeter. It's surprising how much your\neyes deceive you when looking at a monitor.\n\nPCI Express has been the standard system by which to send data and\ninstructions around a computer for two decades. The specification for how it\nall works has gone through regular updates, each one offering double the\nperformance of its predecessor. PCIe 5.0 was released almost four years ago\nand it's the most recent version you'll find in any gaming PC right now. It's\nalso virtually worthless, thanks to the disappointing hardware that supports\nit.\n\nFor a computer to support PCIe 5.0, it needs one of two things, though\npreferably both. First up is the CPU\u2014all of the latest generation of\nprocessors from AMD and Intel have PCIe 5.0 controllers built into them. Ryzen\n7000-series chips have 28 lanes of Gen 5 PCIe that are split so that the first\n16 are allocated to the graphics card slot, eight are dedicated to M.2 NVMe\nslots, and the remaining four are used to communicate with the motherboard\nchipset (more on that obfuscating mess in a moment).\n\nIntel's 14th Gen Core processors have the same number of lanes as AMD, but\nit's all split quite differently. Only sixteen of them are PCIe 5.0 and the\nrest are the slower 4.0 spec; however, eight lanes are used for the\nmotherboard chipset, leaving scope for a single SSD to be connected directly\nto the CPU. Well, not quite, as the 16 Gen 5 lanes can be switched into an 8+8\nmode, half for the graphics card and half for SSDs (AMD's chips can also do\nthis).\n\nStill, on paper, AMD has Intel thoroughly beat when it comes to PCIe 5.0\nsupport. However, things become more complicated with Ryzen processors because\nto access the full range of Gen 5 lanes, you need a motherboard that uses\nE-versions of the latest chipsets. For example, an X670 board will have a PCIe\n4.0 graphics card slot and no more than a single PCIe 5.0 SSD slot. Switch to\nan X670E motherboard and the GPU slot will be 5.0 and there could be two Gen 5\nM.2 slots (though it's usually just the one).\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM pcgamer\n\nAMD's chips have lots of PCIe 5 lanes on offer but using them all is another\nmatter. (Image credit: Future)\n\nIf that's a tad confusing, then I can assure you, it's a better state of\naffairs than Intel's current PCIe 5.0 support. Take the ASRock Z790 Nova\nmotherboard, as an example. It's a lovely board, well built, and has a total\nof six M.2 SSDs. Two of these are directly wired to the CPU, for the best\nperformance, and the one closest to the processor supports a PCIe 5.0 SSD.\nUnfortunately, if you put any SSD into that slot, the CPU automatically\nswitches the graphics card slot to eight lanes (aka PCIe x8).\n\nWhile that still leaves the other eight Gen 5 lanes available, they can't be\nsplit any further and since M.2 slots always use four lanes, you're wasting\nfour PCIe 5.0 lanes by using that first SSD slot. Even if you use a Gen 4 or\neven Gen 3 SSD. Not all Intel motherboards do this but those that use the Z790\nchipset and sport a Gen 5 SSD slot will have this limitation.\n\nBut it's not just the SSD slots that Intel makes a mess of. A single PCIe 5.0\nlane has a bandwidth of just under 4 GB/s, so eight of them aggregate to a\ntotal of 31.5 GB/s (let's just call it 32). That's the same as 16 lanes of Gen\n4 so, in theory, putting a Gen 5 graphics card into an eight-lane slot\nshouldn't be a problem.\n\n## Comic deals, prizes and latest news\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nExcept there aren't any Gen 5 graphics cards\u2014they're all still using PCIe 4.0,\nat best. The next round of new GPUs from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia may move to\nthe newer spec but given that they've only just changed to Gen 4 in their\nlatest generation of cards, there's a good chance that they won't.\n\nUse that 'Gen 5' SSD slot and kiss goodbye to half your GPU slot lanes. (Image\ncredit: ASRock/Intel Corporation)\n\nSo, if you're like me, and have that ASRock Z790 motherboard, no matter what\nGPU you use, if you stick an SSD into the first M.2 slot, then the card will\nbe forced to run in PCIe 4.0 x8 mode (the same as Gen 3 x16). Fortunately, no\ngame comes anywhere near maxing out the bandwidth of the PCI Express graphics\ncard connection but who's to say that this won't happen soon?\n\nAll of these frustrations would be forgivable if PCIe 5.0 SSDs were brilliant\nand worth buying. The sad fact of the matter is that they're a waste of money.\nSure, the peak performance in synthetic tests makes older Gen 4 drives look\npositively slow in comparison, but in real use, you'll barely notice the\ndifference.\n\nThat might seem very odd, given that one of the few PCIe 5.0 SSDs worth\nconsidering has peak sequential read/writes well over 10,000 MB/s\u2014a basic Gen\n4 drive will only be half that rate. The reason is that games, applications,\nand even entire operating systems have all been designed around moving small\namounts of data and only when needed, because most PCs don't have very fast\nstorage. Gen 5 SSDs can only show their true limits in very specific\nscenarios, few of which are ever experienced in gaming or general PC use.\n\nThen you have price and heat rubbing salt into the wound. Head over to the\nlikes of Newegg and look at how much a genuine Gen 5 SSD costs, i.e. ones that\nmake full use of the connection's performance. You're looking at $150 or more\nfor a 1TB PCIe 5.0 SSD and for that amount of money, you can get one of the\nbest 2TB Gen 4 drives and still have change.\n\n> Is Gen 5 really suffering from early adopter problems or is it a case that\n> vendors aren't interested in supporting it all properly?\n\nAll Gen 5 SSDs run hotter than Gen 4 ones and it's not by a few degrees. You\nhave to use a decent cooling system, be it a dedicated heatsink and fan, or a\nlarge metal heatsink on the motherboard to absorb and dissipate the heat. In\nthe case of the former, that's an additional cost to consider and depending on\nthe size of your graphics card, you might not have room for it.\n\nOne could argue that this is just a case of 'early adopter' problems and that\nit will all get much better as the technology advances. While that's certainly\ntrue, it's worth noting that the PCIe 5.0 spec was released almost four years\nago, and AMD's Ryzen 7000-series came to market in the second half of 2022. So\nis Gen 5 really suffering from early adopter problems or is it a case that\nvendors aren't interested in supporting it all properly?\n\nIt's a bit of both, to be honest. Each successive revision of PCI Express\ndoubles the amount of bandwidth each lane has and up to version 5.0, this has\nbeen achieved by running the bus clocks twice as fast. Try doubling your CPU\nor GPU clocks and see what happens. Okay, it's not the same thing, but\nmassively ramping up clock speeds isn't an easy task, even with a relatively\nsimple system like PCI Express. Electrical tolerances need to be extremely\ntight, which adds to the complexity and cost of everything.\n\nThis is especially true for SSDs. To be fully PCIe 5.0 compliant, the\ncontroller chip needs to run faster than a Gen 4 one and the NAND flash memory\nchips also need to read and write data at a much higher rate. At the moment,\nvery few companies have chips that can do all of this and those that can,\nunfortunately, generate a lot of heat. The market for Gen 5 SSDs is much\nsmaller than that for Gen 4 drives, so the tiny demand means the relative\ncosts are higher, too.\n\nGen 5 SSDs\u2014fast, hot, and expensive. Umm, no thanks. (Image credit: Future)\n\nThat all said, AMD and Intel haven't done the best of jobs when it comes to\nactually implementing PCIe 5.0\u2014in the case of the former, the Gen 5 graphics\ncard slot is wasted, as nobody sells a Gen 5 card, and the deliberate chipset\nlimitation between E and non-E motherboards just adds confusion to it all.\nIt's also completely unnecessary, as there's physically no difference between\nthe chips used in, say, a B650 and B650E motherboard.\n\nIntel clearly wasn't all that interested in Gen 5 PCIe, as its implementation\nin its 14th Gen desktop CPUs and 700-series chipset amounts to a PCIe 5.0 x16\nslot, a maximum of one Gen 5 M.2 slot, and a whole bunch of irritating\nconfiguration restrictions. It doesn't look like Intel will be offering\nanything significantly better with Arrow Lake, either.\n\nPCIe 5.0 is pretty much useless at the moment or at the very least, used-less,\nif that makes any sense. Support for it in the immediate future doesn't look\nthat much better, either, but fortunately for us, Gen 4 is more than good\nenough. That technology is coming up to being seven years old now but we're\nstill way off the point where it's a limitation in gaming. At some point in\ntime, every desktop PC will be fully Gen 5, from top to bottom, though at the\nrate that PCI Express gets implemented, we won't need to worry about that for\na long time.\n\nLet's hope that we're not having the same problems again but with Gen 7 or the\nlike!\n\nNick Evanson\n\nHardware Writer\n\nNick, gaming, and computers all first met in 1981, with the love affair\nstarting on a Sinclair ZX81 in kit form and a book on ZX Basic. He ended up\nbecoming a physics and IT teacher, but by the late 1990s decided it was time\nto cut his teeth writing for a long defunct UK tech site. He went on to do the\nsame at Madonion, helping to write the help files for 3DMark and PCMark. After\na short stint working at Beyond3D.com, Nick joined Futuremark (MadOnion\nrebranded) full-time, as editor-in-chief for its gaming and hardware section,\nYouGamers. After the site shutdown, he became an engineering and computing\nlecturer for many years, but missed the writing bug. Cue four years at\nTechSpot.com and over 100 long articles on anything and everything. He freely\nadmits to being far too obsessed with GPUs and open world grindy RPGs, but who\nisn't these days?\n\nMore about hardware\n\nNoctua teases 'something new' that looks very much like the desk fan prototype\nit's had on show before\n\nRazer forced to pay more than $1M in refunds for its RGB 'surgical N95\nrespirators' that were not N95 respirators\n\nLatest\n\nHelldivers 2 players decry broken ricochet changes, then realise it's probably\njust shrapnel from the now-deadly Eruptor\n\nSee more latest \u25ba\n\nSee comments\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nMetro Exodus is the perfect post apocalyptic game to play if you're tired of\nFallout's wasteland\n\nThe Divinity: Original Sin board game took 6 years to make because Larian was\ndetermined to do right by the series: 'We're not going to do a piss poor job\nwith a game that's part of an IP that we care about'\n\nThe Divinity: Original Sin board game is like a huge new Larian RPG in a box,\nand it's one of the coolest games I've ever played\n\nCelebrating the 20th birthday of City of Heroes: an MMO resurrected by the\npeople who loved it enough to 'bring the game back for good'\n\nI tried to make a medieval paradise in Manor Lords but now it's just full of\neggs and corpses\n\nIdle farming sim Rusty's Retirement allows you to pour hours into farmwork\nwhilst still doing other things\n\nManor Lords release date and launch times: here's when the medieval city\nbuilding gates open\n\nMy quest to find one of Stardew Valley's rarest items left me as a social\noutcast, but that won't stop my early-morning rummages\n\nGet a superb Star Wars game and multiple Day One releases on PC Game Pass this\nApril\n\nFallout 76 was kicking my butt until I respecced into an indestructible tank\n\nManor Lords won't let me get away with my usual survival city builder cheese\nstrats, so I guess I'm actually gonna have to become a competent mayor\n\nLoad Comments\n\n  1. 1\n\nBest RAM for gaming in 2024: I've tested the best DDR4 and DDR5 RAM to find\nthe right kits for you\n\n  2. 2\n\nBest ultrawide monitor for gaming in 2024: the expansive panels I recommend\nfor PC gamers\n\n  3. 3\n\nBest wireless gaming keyboard in 2024\n\n  4. 4\n\nBest gaming laptops in 2024: I've had my pick of portable powerhouses and\nthese are the best\n\n  5. 5\n\nBest gaming chairs in 2024: the seats I'd suggest for any gamer\n\n  1. 1\n\nGigabyte Aorus FO32U2 OLED gaming monitor review\n\n  2. 2\n\nDough Spectrum Black 27 OLED gaming monitor review\n\n  3. 3\n\nHyperX Cloud III Wireless review\n\n  4. 4\n\nAnother Crab's Treasure review: An undersea soulslike that's cute and\ncompelling, though weirdly crass\n\n  5. 5\n\nSand Land review: an unfortunately forgettable tie-in\n\nPC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading\ndigital publisher.
