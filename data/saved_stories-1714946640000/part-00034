We hypothesized that the consumption of very hot\ndrinks can lead to a decrease in the ability to perceive low concentrations of\ntastants. We evaluated the ability to perceive low concentrations of five\nprototypical sapid compounds in 42 women and 40 men aged 18\u201365. A\nquestionnaire made it possible to collect the usual frequencies (number of\nunit/day) and consumption temperature levels (medium hot/very hot) for four\nvery common hot drinks (coffee, tea, herbal infusions, and hot chocolate). Our\nresults showed that subjects who consumed very hot drinks (versus medium hot)\nwere less sensitive to sweet (p = 0.020) and salty (p = 0.046) tastes. An\naggravating effect of high consumption frequencies was only shown for sweet\ntaste (p = 0.036). Moreover, our data also showed that women were more\nsensitive than men to sour, bitter, and umami tastes (p values < 0.05), as\nwell as that taste sensitivity decreases with age, especially after 50 years\nold (all tastes; p values < 0.05). These findings strengthen our knowledge\nabout the influence of sex and age on taste sensitivity, and they provide\nknowledge on the influence of consumption habits related to hot drinks on\ntaste sensitivity.\n\nKeywords: taste sensitivity, temperature, hot drink, age, gender, T@sty\n\nGo to:\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nCoffee and tea are the two most frequently consumed hot drinks in the world\n[1]. Other widely consumed hot drinks include herbal infusions, hot chocolate,\nand mate. These drinks are obtained by solid\u2013liquid extraction (coffee, tea,\nmate, etc.) or by dissolution using a solvent (example: hot chocolate and\ninstant coffee). In any case, their preparation involves the use of a solvent\nthat is heated to a very high temperature, most often water. For example,\nbrewing coffee requires water with a temperature ideally between 85 and 95 \u00b0C\n[2]. At the end of the preparation, the temperature of the drink is lower than\nthat of the given solvent. However, the temperature remains very high. In the\ncatering industry, the recommended temperature for keeping drinks warm is\nbetween 85 and 88 \u00b0C [2]. According to Brown and Diller [3], hot beverages\nsuch as tea, hot chocolate, and coffee are frequently served at temperatures\nbetween 71.1 and 85 \u00b0C. These results were corroborated by data from a lawsuit\nagainst a fast food restaurant chain in the United States that showed that\ncoffee that caused burns was dispensed at a temperature between 75 and 88 \u00b0C\n[4]. Furthermore, Verst et al. [4] showed that the average serving temperature\nof coffee approximately two minutes after preparation varied between 66 and 77\n\u00b0C depending on the given machine and the context (household or food service\nindustry). Hot drinks are not always consumed directly after preparation. The\ntime between the preparation and the introduction of hot drinks into the mouth\nallows for cooling. This drop in temperature depends on several factors such\nas the initial temperature of the drink, the time between preparation and its\nintroduction into the mouth, the thermal properties of the container, the\nambient temperature, and the amount of other added substances such as milk and\ncream. [3]. When consumers deem the temperature satisfactory, the hot drinks\nare taken into the mouth and consumed. In practice, this consumption is\nsometimes preceded by a test phase intended to estimate the risk of burns.\nSeveral studies have made it possible to determine the temperature that is\nconsidered to be ideal by consumers. For coffee, which has been frequently\nstudied, the ideal temperature seems to be between 60 and 70 \u00b0C [2,4,5,6]. For\ntea or mate, the preferred temperature seems to be close to 70 \u00b0C [6].\nHowever, the temperature that is considered ideal varies across consumers. In\nfact, in a cohort study involving more than 40,000 regular tea drinkers,\nIslami et al. [7] showed that 39.0% of participants drank their tea at a\ntemperature below 60 \u00b0C, 38.9% drank it between 60 and 64 \u00b0C, and 22.0% drank\nit at more than 65 \u00b0C.\n\nThe introduction of hot drinks into the mouth causes an increase in the\ntemperature in the tissues of the tongue, the oral cavity, and then the\nesophagus. The temperature increase at the surface of the tissues primarily\ndepends on the temperature of the liquid, contact time, and the thermal\nconductivity of the exposed surfaces. Lee et al. [8] showed that coffee at a\ntemperature of 60 \u00b0C could increase the surface area temperature of the tongue\nto 53 \u00b0C. This temperature is above the threshold for the emergence of pain on\nthe tongue surface, which is approximately 46\u201348 \u00b0C [6,8]. The fact that the\npreferred temperature exceeds the threshold temperature for pain could be\nexplained by the short residence time of the hot drink and by the phenomenon\nof habituation [6,8,9]. To our knowledge, there have been no experimental\nstudies concerning burns on the surface of the tongue caused by heat from\nliquids in the mouth. However, there are data on the epidermis from other\nparts of the body. According to Borchgrevink et al. [2], 45 \u00b0C is the\nequilibrium point of the skin. Below this exposure temperature, there is no\ndamage. Between 45 and 51 \u00b0C, the rate of cell destruction doubles for every\ndegree of Celsius. Between 60 and 65 \u00b0C, the destruction rate is 10 million\ntimes higher than it would be at a temperature of 45 \u00b0C. Above 70 \u00b0C, the\ndestruction of the cells is complete, even for contact times of less than 1 s\n[6]. In addition, a mathematical model that accounted for the specific\ncharacteristics of the external tissues of the tongue (mucosa) was developed\nby Brown and Diller [3] with the objective of simulating burns and quantifying\nthe extent of thermal damage. When applied to drinking coffee, this model\nindicated that a temperature of 57.8 \u00b0C limits the risk of burns while\nmaintaining consumer satisfaction.\n\nThe usual temperatures for serving and consuming hot drinks are therefore\nwithin a temperature range liable to cause cellular damage in the oral cavity,\nincluding on the tongue. After examining more than 1000 observational and\nexperimental studies, a working group from the International Agency for\nResearch on Cancer (IARC) came to the conclusion that drinking very hot\nbeverages at temperatures above 65 \u00b0C is probably carcinogenic to humans\n[1,10]. It was also specified that it is the temperature of the liquid and not\nthe nature of the liquid that is in question. Taken together, these findings\nindicate that very hot drinks can constitute, to some extent, a physical\naggression on the cells of the oral cavity, including the tongue.\n\nIt is well-known that taste is fundamentally important for food selection.\nThus, it appears essential that the taste buds function normally in order to\nproperly perceive this characteristic of foods. Therefore, we thought it would\nbe interesting to know whether hot drink consumption could have an impact on\ntaste sensitivity. Surprisingly, no study has yet addressed this topic.\nNevertheless, the papillae containing the taste buds are primarily expressed\non the dorsal surface of the tongue [11], especially on the anterior two-\nthirds of the tongue [12]. This position makes the papillae particularly\nvulnerable since the tip of the tongue is, along with the lips, the first part\nof the body that is in direct contact with hot drinks. This part of the tongue\nis also the one that is most often involved in taste dysfunctions [12]. The\nlife span of human taste buds is approximately ten days, with a range of 3\u201330\ndays. Normally, taste buds appear to degenerate and regenerate at the same\nrate [13]. However, we wonder if the aggression represented by regular\nexposure to very hot drinks could influence their renewal rate or more\ngenerally disrupt their normal functioning and simultaneously reduce the\nability to perceive tastes. In this case, the taste capacities of consumers\nwho were accustomed to drinking very hot beverages should be lower than that\nof consumers accustomed to lower temperatures.\n\nAmong the factors having an impact on taste sensitivity, apart from illnesses\nor medical treatment, are gender and age. The literature regarding differences\nin sensitivity between men and women has been contradictory. Some studies have\nshown a greater taste sensitivity for women [12,14,15], while other studies\nhave shown no significant difference [16]. Additional data are needed on the\nsubject. The effect of age is much clearer. Two comprehensive literature\nreviews clearly showed that taste abilities decline with age [16,17]. In any\nevent, there is a clear consensus on the need to consider these factors when\nassessing taste sensitivity.\n\nThis article presents the results of a study conducted to assess the possible\nnegative influence of consuming very hot drinks on the ability to perceive\ntastes. Our hypothesis was that subjects who drink very hot liquids would\nexhibit a lower taste sensitivity than subjects who drink liquids at lower\ntemperatures. We also hypothesized that a high frequency of consumption would\nbe an aggravating factor. The aim of the study was to evaluate the taste\nsensitivity of a group of 82 subjects and to characterize their hot drink\nconsumption habits. We then studied the links between these two datasets. We\nfocused our attention on the most frequently consumed drink. In fact, due to\nthe high frequency of the consumption of this drink, it constitutes the bulk\nof the risk associated with high temperatures. We considered age and sex of\nparticipants in the analyses as factors of variation due to their recognized\ninfluence on taste sensitivity [16,17].\n\nGo to:\n\n## 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Subjects\n\nThe 82 subjects who participated in this study were all part of a larger panel\nrecruited for a research project called Taste and Oral Microbiota (TOM). They\nwere all normal-weight nonsmokers, did not follow any long-term drug treatment\n(lasting more than one month), had not taken antibiotics or antiseptic\nmouthwashes, and had received no dental care in the 30 days preceding the\nexperiment. In addition, for the purposes of the present study, they all\nconsumed at least one of the following hot drinks: coffee, tea, herbal\ninfusions, or hot chocolate (at least 2 times/week). The panel was composed of\n42 women and 40 men aged 18\u201365 (mean: 42; median: 43 years old). The sex\nratios (number of men/number of women) for the 18\u201335, 36\u201350, and 51\u201365 age\ngroups were 0.8, 1.0, and 1.1, respectively. All the subjects signed a consent\nform and were compensated with up to 30\u20ac for their participation. A competent\nethics committee approved the protocol for the taste sensitivity assessment\n(Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes Ouest V, n \u00b0 2016-A01954-47).\n\n### 2.2. Study Design\n\nFigure 1 shows the general design of the study. For each taste, three\nmeasurements were performed with a one-week interval, always between 10 and 11\na.m. During one session, all five tastes were tested. The order of evaluation\nfor the different tastes varied according to Williams\u2019 Latin square. The first\nand third taste sensitivity measurements took place in our laboratory in a\nroom dedicated to the study of oral physiology. These sessions were individual\nand always performed by the same investigator. The stimulated saliva flow was\nmeasured during these two laboratory sessions. The second measure of taste\nsensitivity was performed at home, during the second week of the study,\nwithout the presence of the investigator. The material needed for the test\n(see Section 2.3.1) was given to the subjects at the end of the first\nlaboratory session. Responses to the sensitivity test were given via an\ninternet questionnaire. The objective of this measurement performed at home\nwas to assess the ability to perform such measures outside the laboratory\nwithout making people move in the future. Finally, the subjects completed an\ninternet questionnaire on hot drink consumption habits after the end of the\nsensitivity measurements.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 1\n\nGeneral design of the study.\n\n### 2.3. Taste Sensitivity Test\n\nFor the taste sensitivity evaluation, we chose to focus on the ability to\nperceive low concentrations close to the detection threshold. This type of\nmeasurement is very often used in clinical studies to detect taste\ndysfunctions [18]. The sensitivity test used in this study made it possible to\nspecifically stimulate the first third of the tongue (regional test). This\ntype of test was suitable for our purpose because this part of the tongue is\nthe first to come into contact with hot liquids when they are introduced into\nthe mouth. In addition, this area is the most involved in taste dysfunction\n[12].\n\nWe assessed the sensitivity for the five basic tastes. Fructose for sweet\ntaste (CAS: 57-48-7, Cooper, France), sodium chloride for salty taste (NaCl,\nCAS: 7647-14-5, Cooper, France), citric acid for sour taste (CAS: 5949-29-1,\nCooper, France), quinine hydrochloride for bitter taste (Quinine HCl, CAS:\n6119-47-7, Merck KGaA, Germany), and monosodium glutamate for umami taste\n(MSG, CAS: 6106-04-3, Merck KGaA, Germany) were used as the prototypical taste\ncompounds. These five molecules were all of food or pharmacopoeia qualities.\nWe chose fructose for technical reasons (the viscosity of the solutions to be\nprinted; see Section 2.3.1).\n\n#### 2.3.1. Material\n\nThe sensitivity test used here, called T@sty, was in the form of several\nedible test sheets, each allowing for one sensitivity measurement to a given\ntaste. Each test sheet consisted of six triplets of detachable precut discs to\nbe placed in contact with the tongue (Figure 2a). The triplets all consisted\nof one tasty disc and two neutral discs. The tastants, which were in a\nsolution of deionized water, were printed on the surface of the discs (wafer\npaper) using a food-grade inkjet printer. The position of the tasty disc\nvaried randomly depending on the triplets and the test sheets. The surface\nconcentration of the tastant and the intensity of taste gradually increased\nfrom the first to the sixth triplets. Distilled water was printed in the same\nmanner on the neutral discs to make them look the same as the tasty discs.\nSeveral pretests made it possible to determine the appropriate concentrations\nleading to a discriminating test. The pretests consisted of carrying out\nseveral preliminary studies involving 60\u2013200 subjects and observing the\ndistribution of the scores obtained. The concentrations were adjusted until a\ndistribution close to a Gaussian distribution was obtained. The final surface\nconcentrations were as follows: 2.1, 2.7, 4.1, 7.1, 16.1, and 35.4 \u03bcg/cm^2\n(fructose); 4.9, 5.2, 5.6, 6.7, 8.8, and 12.6 \u03bcg/cm^2 (NaCl); 3.6, 4.1, 5.6,\n9.5, 17.1, and 24.7 \u03bcg/cm^2 (citric acid); 2.9, 9.5, 19.2, 48.8, 98.3, and\n133.5 ng/cm^2 (quinine HCl); and 1.1, 1.6, 3.79, 19.6, and 29.6 \u03bcg/cm^2 (MSG).\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 2\n\n(a) An example of a test sheet (allowing for one sensitivity measurement to a\ngiven taste). The color symbolizes the location of the tasty discs and the\nincreasing intensity of the taste intensity. Dimensions of the sheet: 11 \u00d7 16\n\u00d7 0.06 cm. Discs: 18 mm in diameter and 2.54 cm^2 in area. (b) The procedure\nfor detaching and tasting the discs was as follows: detach the disc from the\ntest sheet by holding it by the gripping tab, put the upper face of the disc\n(marked with a small cross) in contact with the tip of the tongue (first\nthird) for a maximum of 4\u20135 s, and then discard the disc. After a short pause\n(10 s), subjects could evaluate the next triplet of discs.\n\n#### 2.3.2. Test Principle\n\nFor each test sheet, and thus for each taste, the subjects had to successively\nevaluate the six triplets, starting with the triplet located at the top of the\nsheet and then moving downwards. The lowest concentration was used for the\ntriplet numbered 1, and the highest concentration was used for the triplet\nnumbered 6. For example, we used the following concentrations for the tasty\ndisc for fructose triplets 1\u20136, respectively: 2.1, 2.7, 4.1, 7.1, 16.1, and\n35.4 \u03bcg/cm^2. For each triplet, the subjects had to successively taste the\nthree discs, from left to right, and then indicate the tasty disc (forced\nchoice). The name of the tested taste was indicated on the support. The\nsubjects therefore knew which taste was being tested. However, because some\nweakly concentrated tastants were known to sometimes have a different taste\nquality than expected at higher concentrations, the subjects were informed\nthat if there was any doubt about the perceived sensation, they should find\nthe disc that was different from the other two. Figure 2b shows how to taste a\ndisc. The evaluation took less than five minutes per taste sheet. Rinsing with\nwater followed by a 3-min break (return to normal salivation) was imposed\nbetween the different test sheets dedicated to the different tastes. Training\nsamples were used during the first session to familiarize the subjects with\nthe procedure and the stimulus to be perceived (consisting of a reduced test\nsheet with a single triplet of discs). The maximum surface concentration of\nthe range was used for the tasty disc of this triplet.\n\n#### 2.3.3. Sensitivity Score\n\nFigure 3a schematizes the rule for determining the sensitivity scores. This\napproach was based on the best estimate threshold (BET) method described in\nstandard E679-19 [19], with the difference that the result of the test was not\nexpressed as a concentration but as a sensitivity score ranging from 0 to 6.\nThe higher the score was, the more the given subject exhibited a good ability\nto detect low concentrations of the given tastant. The average of the three\nreplicates was used to determine the sensitivity of the subjects (Figure 3b).\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 3\n\n(a) Determination of the sensitivity score (for a given test sheet). The score\nwas based on the greatest sequence of correct answers, starting from the sixth\ntriplet of discs (highest concentration). (b) For each taste, three\nmeasurements were performed, each giving rise to a sensitivity score. The\naverage of the three scores was used to determine the sensitivity of the\nsubjects.\n\n### 2.4. Questionnaire on Hot Drink Consumption Habits\n\nThe participants completed an internet questionnaire regarding their hot drink\nconsumption habits. The objective of this questionnaire was to determine, for\neach subject, the most frequently consumed drink (named \u201cfavorite hot drink\u201d\nin this document) and its usual temperature level at consumption.\n\nThe four hot drinks selected for this study (coffee, tea, herbal infusions,\nand hot chocolate) were the most frequently consumed in France during the\nwinter (the period studied for the survey). For each drink, the subjects were\nasked to specify (i) the frequency of consumption (number of units/cups per\nday, week or month) and (ii) the usual temperature of consumption (lukewarm,\nmedium hot, very hot, or boiling). The participants were informed that they\nhad to answer all the questions by considering the last four months as a\nreference period (i.e., from December to March\u2014the winter season). The\nquestions were asked with the following phrasing: (i) During the last four\nmonths, how often did you drink each of the drinks below (coffee, tea, herbal\ninfusions, and hot chocolate)? (ii) At what temperature do you prefer to\nconsume the drinks below (coffee, tea, herbal infusions, and hot chocolate)?\n\n### 2.5. Salivary Flow\n\nUnstimulated whole saliva was collected by passive drooling into a pre-weighed\ntube [20]. This measurement was performed before the taste sensitivity\nmeasurement during the two laboratory sessions. Salivary flow was measured as\na possible confounder impacting on the primary outcome variable.\n\n### 2.6. Data Analysis\n\nThe data were analyzed with the XLSTAT software (Addinsoft (2020), XLSTAT\nstatistical and data analysis solution, Paris, France. https://www.xlstat.com,\n2021).\n\n#### 2.6.1. Validity of Sensitivity Measurements\n\nThe repeatability of the measurements was evaluated by calculating, for each\ntaste, the Pearson correlation coefficients between the sensitivity scores\nobtained during the three replicates. A significant linear relationship was\nexpected. In addition, for each taste, an ANOVA (type III) was performed to\ndetermine whether the scores obtained during the three measurements differed\n(model: sensitivity score = subject + replicate + error). Tukey\u2019s post-hoc\ntest (significance level set at 0.05) made it possible to identify which\nreplicates differed. For each taste and subject, the average of the three\nreplicates was used for the following analyses.\n\n#### 2.6.2. Interindividual Variability\n\nFor each taste, descriptive statistics linked to the distributions of the mean\nscores made it possible to comment on the interindividual variability.\n\n#### 2.6.3. Link between Sensitivity for the Five Tastes\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient was used to study the correlations between\nthe scores obtained for the different tastes. A principal component analysis\n(PCA; biplot representation), which was performed on the correlation matrix,\nprovided a multidimensional representation of the links between the scores\nobtained for the different tastes.\n\n#### 2.6.4. Hot Drink Consumption Habits\n\nDescriptive statistics were used to comment on the global hot drink\nconsumption patterns (the frequency of consumption and usual temperature\nlevel). The Chi^2 test was used to compare the frequency of consumption for\nmen and women and for the different age groups in the study.\n\n#### 2.6.5. Influence of Hot Drink Consumption, Age and Sex on Taste\nSensitivity\n\nFor each taste, a covariance analysis (ANCOVA, type III) was performed with\nthe objective of studying the influence of the consumption frequency (number\nof units per month) and usual temperature (medium hot or very hot) on taste\nsensitivity while accounting for participant gender (male/female) and age\ngroup (18\u201325, 26\u201350, or 51\u201365 years old). The model was as follows:\nsensitivity score = temperature level + age group + sex + consumption\nfrequency + error). A 5% threshold was chosen to test the significance of the\nfactors. We considered that p values between 0.05 and 0.01 reflected a trend.\nFor each of the factors, Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test (with the significance level\nset at 0.05) was used for multiple comparisons of the means. The normalized\ncoefficient from the ANCOVA was used to clarify the direction of the\nrelationship between the consumption frequencies and sensitivity scores.\n\n#### 2.6.6. Salivary Flow\n\nFor each subject, the values collected during the two replicates were\naveraged. The links between the mean flows and the sensitivity scores were\ninvestigated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. An ANOVA (type III)\nwas performed to find whether there were significant differences in salivation\nbetween men and women on the one hand and between age groups on the other hand\n(model: flow = age group + sex + error).\n\nGo to:\n\n## 3\\. Results\n\n### 3.1. Taste Sensitivity\n\n#### 3.1.1. Validity of Taste Sensitivity Measurements\n\nFor each taste, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between\neach replicate (replicates 1\u20132, 2\u20133, and 1\u20133). The averages of the three\ncoefficients were as follows: r(82) = 0.53 (sweet); r(82) = 0.40 (salty);\nr(82) = 0.46 (sour); r(82) = 0.49 (bitter); and r(82) = 0.47 (umami). The\ndetails on the correlations are presented in Table 1. Overall, the highest\ncorrelation coefficient was observed for consecutive sessions (replicates 1\u20132\nand 2\u20133) and the lowest was for sessions spaced 2 weeks apart (replicates\n1\u20133). The results of the ANOVAs indicated that the scores varied from one\nreplicate to another only for sweet (F(2, 162) = 4.14; p = 0.018) and salty\n(F(2, 162) = 6.55; p = 0.002) tastes (Table 2). In both cases, the scores\nobtained during the first measurement were higher than those during the second\nmeasurement (0.6\u20130.7 points on a scale of 0\u20136). The scores obtained during the\nsecond and third measurements did not significantly differ. No significant\ndifference was found between the three measures for sour (F(2, 162) = 1.70; p\n= 0.19), bitter (F(2, 162) = 0.23; p = 0.79), and umami (F(2, 162) = 0.23; p =\n0.80) tastes. Overall, the context of the measurement (lab versus home) did\nnot seem to have influenced the resulting scores. In fact, out of 10 possible\ncomparisons (lab/home), only two significant differences were observed (Table\n2, Tukey\u2019s test).\n\n### Table 1\n\nRepeatability of the taste sensitivity test.

Interindividual Variability\n\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of the sensitivity scores for the five tastes.\nOverall, the distributions showed a high interindividual variability in\nsensitivity levels, regardless of the taste.

Sensitivity for the Five Tastes\n\nThe Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients indicated a significant correlation\nbetween scores obtained for the different tastes (p < 0.0001 for all\ncorrelations), with coefficients ranging from 0.49 to 0.66. A comparison of\nthe average correlation coefficients (the averages for the coefficients\ncalculated between each taste and the four others) revealed that the bitter\ntaste was, on average, the least correlated with the others (r(82) = 0.42; p <\n0.0001). Sweet taste was, on average, the most correlated with the others\n(r(82) = 0.63; p < 0.0001). Figure 5 summarizes the correlations between the\nsensitivities for the different tastes. For both PCA representations (F1\u2013F2\nand F1\u2013F3), the point clouds that represent the 82 subjects are stretched\nalong axis 1. This axis, which explains approximately 66% of the observed\nvariability, seems to reflect a general sensitivity. Subjects for whom the\nmark is on the left side of the charts were generally less sensitive to taste\nthan subjects whose mark is on the right side. The orientation and the\ndirection of the vectors representing the tastes give some indications about\nthe degree of connection between the scores obtained for the different tastes.\nThe vector representing the sweet taste is always well-correlated with axis 1,\nwhich suggests that this taste best reflects the general sensitivity of a\nsubject.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 5\n\nLinks between sensitivity for the five tastes (82 subjects).

Most Frequently Consumed Hot Drink (Favorite Hot Drink)\n\nThe reported frequency of consumption made it possible to determine the\nfavorite hot drink of each subject. For 57% of the subjects, coffee was the\nfavorite hot drink. The percentages for the other drinks were as follows: 31%\n(tea), 10% (herbal infusion), and 15% (hot chocolate) (Figure 6a). The sum of\nthese percentages exceeds 100, because for nine of the 82 participants,\nseveral hot drinks were consumed with the same frequency. In this case, we\nkept only the drink consumed at the highest temperature level for the analyses\nto follow. In fact, this drink was found to constitute the bulk of the risk\nassociated with high temperatures. Tea was more often the favorite hot drink\nfor women than for men (CHI^2 (1; n = 82) = 19.47; p < 0.0001). There were no\nsignificant differences between men and women for other drinks. Furthermore,\ncoffee was more often the favorite hot drink of 51\u201365-year-olds than\n18\u201335-year-olds (CHI^2 (2; n = 82) = 15.79; p = 0.0002). Conversely, hot\nchocolate was more often the favorite hot drink of 18\u201335-year-olds than\n51\u201365-year-olds (CHI^2 (2; n = 82) = 9.63; p = 0.005).\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 6\n\nFavorite drink. (a) Percentage of subjects per drink and usual temperature\nlevel of consumption. (b) Distribution of consumption frequencies for the\nfavorite drink.\n\n#### 3.2.2. Usual Consumption Temperature\n\nThe terms \u201clukewarm\u201d and \u201cboiling\u201d were not used to qualify the usual\ntemperature level for consuming hot drinks (favorite drink). Figure 6a shows\nthe percentage of subjects consuming their favorite drink at the medium hot\nand very hot levels. Overall, 56.1% and 43.9% of subjects reported drinking\ntheir favorite drinks at the medium hot and very hot levels, respectively.\n\n#### 3.2.3. Frequency of Consumption (Favorite Drink)\n\nFigure 6b shows the distribution of the consumption frequencies for the\nfavorite drink. The mean and the median were equal to approximately two cups\nper day. The minimum and maximum frequencies recorded here were 0.3 and 4.0\ncups per day, respectively (i.e., 9\u2013120 cups per month).\n\n### 3.3. Salivary Flow\n\nSalivary flow was not correlated with sensitivity scores for any of the five\ntastes, with r(82) = 0.01 and p = 0.958 (sweet); r(82) = 0.14 and p = 0.201\n(salty); r(82) = \u22120.02 and p = 0.831 (sour); r(82) = 0.06 and p = 0.567\n(bitter); and r(82) = 0.06 and p = 0.590 (umami). Notably, no differences in\nsalivary flow were observed between either men and women (F(1, 81) = 1.66; p =\n0.201) or the different age classes (F(1, 81) = 0.16; p = 0.851).\n\n### 3.4. Influence of Hot Drink Consumption Habits, Age, and Sex on Taste\nSensitivity\n\n#### 3.4.1. Influence of the Usual Temperature Level\n\nThe ANCOVA performed for each taste (Table 3) showed that the sensitivity\nscores depended on the usual temperature level for the sweet (F(1, 76) = 5.62;\np = 0.020) and salty (F(1, 76) = 4.11; p = 0.046) tastes. The same trend was\nobserved for the sour taste (F(1, 76) = 3.90; p = 0.052). Multiple comparisons\nof means indicated that subjects for whom the usual temperature level was very\nhot had, on average, lower sensitivity scores than subjects whose usual\ntemperature level was medium hot (Figure 7a). This effect was not significant\nfor the bitter (F(1, 76) = 0.43; p = 0.516) and umami tastes (F(1, 76) = 2.56;\np = 0.114).\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 7\n\nSummary of multiple comparisons (Tukey HSD; significance level set at 5%).\nMeans and p values associated with Tukey\u2019s results.

Influence of the Consumption Frequency\n\nThe frequency of consumption had an influence on the sensitivity scores for\nthe sweet taste (F(1, 76) = 4.56; p = 0.036). The normalized coefficient from\nthe ANCOVA indicated that the lower the frequency of consumption was, the\nhigher the sweet taste sensitivity score. The influence of the consumption\nfrequency was not significant for the other tastes (Table 3).\n\n#### 3.4.3. Influence of the Age Group\n\nThe ANCOVA showed that the sensitivity scores depended on the age of the\nparticipants. All tastes were impacted (Table 3). Overall, multiple\ncomparisons of means showed a decrease in sensitivity scores with increasing\nage. The differences between the sensitivity scores of 18\u201335-year-olds and\n51\u201365-year-olds were significant for sweet (F(2, 76) = 5.92; p = 0.004), salty\n(F(2, 76) = 6.74; p = 0.002), sour (F(2, 76) = 3.83; p = 0.026), bitter (F(2,\n76) = 5.49; p = 0.006), and umami (F(2, 76) = 3.85; p = 0.026) tastes. The\ndifferences between the sensitivity scores of 36\u201350-year-olds and 51\u201365-year-\nolds were significant for all the tastes except for the sour taste. The\nsensitivity scores of 18\u201335 and 36\u201350-year-olds did not significantly differ\nfor any of the five tastes (Figure 7b).\n\n#### 3.4.4. Influence of Sex\n\nThe ANCOVA showed that the sensitivity scores depended on the sex of the\nparticipants for sour (F(1, 76) = 6.67; p = 0.012), bitter (F(1, 76) = 5.92; p\n= 0.017), and umami (F(1, 76) = 6.20; p = 0.015) tastes (Table 3). The same\ntendency was observed for the sweet taste (F(1.76) = 2.96; p = 0.090).\nMultiple comparisons of means showed that women obtained higher sensitivity\nscores than men (Figure 7c). The sex effect was not decisive for the salty\ntaste (F(1, 76) = 0.23; p = 0.632).\n\nGo to:\n\n## 4\\. Discussion\n\n### 4.1. Taste Sensitivity\n\nThe sensitivity test used for this study is relatively new. Only one published\nstudy presented data collected using this test [20]. It is therefore necessary\nto provide some elements showing the validity of the measurement by comparing\nwith other well-established methods. In a study by Mueller et al. [21], the\nPearson correlation coefficients calculated between scores obtained 12 days\napart and with 69 subjects were 0.43 (sweet), 0.34 (salty), 0.40 (sour), and\n0.56 (bitter) for the taste strips and 0.50 (sweet), 0.37 (salty), 0.36\n(sour), and 0.61 (bitter) for the well-established three-drop-method [22]. The\naverage correlation coefficients observed from one repetition to another with\nthe T@sty test were within the same order of magnitude (0.40\u20130.53). We\nconsider this result to be satisfactory, especially since one of the three\nreplicates was performed at home. Higher correlation coefficients can be found\nin the literature, in particular for the three-drop method, but with delays of\na few tens of minutes between the replicates [23]. For sweet and salty tastes\nonly, the scores obtained during the first measurement were higher than they\nwere during the second measurement. No other difference was found between the\nreplicates. The use of a training sample may have resulted in slightly better\nscores, at least for the sweet and salty tastes. It would be interesting to\ngeneralize the use of this sample and not to restrict its use to the first\nmeasurement. We also observed that the scores obtained during the home\nassessment were generally not different from the scores obtained in the\nlaboratory. This finding suggests that the test used here is suitable for\nnonlaboratory use. Apart from our hypotheses, we have shown that the salivary\nflow was not linked to the sensitivity scores obtained for the different\ntastes. The dry support used to produce the test was therefore not a\nlimitation in our case.\n\nWe observed a strong interindividual variability in the sensitivity levels for\nthe five tastes. This strong variability was widely accepted by the scientific\ncommunity [16,17,18]. Moreover, our results support the idea of a generalized\ntaste sensitivity, which has also been suggested by the results of other\nstudies [24,25,26]. In other words, when a subject exhibited a satisfactory\nsensitivity for one taste, they often also had a satisfactory sensitivity for\nother tastes. However, this statement must be qualified by specifying that the\ncorrelation coefficients between the tastes ranged from 0.49 to 0.66, which\ncorresponded to the coefficients of determination (R^2) that ranged from 0.24\nto 0.44. Therefore, the quality of the prediction was not perfect. Our data\nindicated that the sweet taste seemed to correlate the most, on average, with\nother tastes. Therefore, this taste seems to be the most representative of\ngeneral sensitivity. If only one taste had to be selected to estimate overall\nsensitivity, then the sweet taste seems to be the best candidate. Remember,\nhowever, that the prediction power was still quite low (R^2 = 0.44 on\naverage).\n\n### 4.2. Consumption Frequency and the Usual Temperature of Hot Drinks\n\nThe consumption frequencies collected for the favorite drink averaged 2.0\nunits per day, with a range of 0.3\u20134 units per day. These data are credible.\nIndeed, according to the results of the INCA 3 study [27], the average\nconsumption of hot drinks in France is 268.9 g per day or 2.15 units (cups)\nper day if we consider that one medium-sized cup contains approximately 125 g\nof hot drink. The differences in consumption observed between men and women\nand between age groups also confirmed the value of considering these two\nvariables during the analyses.\n\nTo qualify the usual temperature level of hot drink consumption (favorite\ndrink), participants only used the terms medium hot and very hot. The\npercentages of subjects for these two temperature levels were relatively\nbalanced. However, the medium hot level was strongest for hot chocolate. The\naddition of milk, which is quite common for this type of hot drink, may\nexplain this result. Indeed, adding substances such as milk and cream\nultimately lead to a reduction in consumption temperature [3,4,6]. We also\nobserved that the frequency of subjects consuming their tea at a very hot\nlevel was high compared to other drinks. This observation was consistent with\nthe literature, indicating that the consumer\u2019s preferred drinking temperature\nfor tea and mate is close to 70 \u00b0C [6]. These observations do not provide any\nnew information about hot drink consumption habits, but they were quite\nreassuring about the quality of the data collected here.\n\n### 4.3. Influence of Hot Drink Consumption, Age, and Sex on Taste Sensitivity\n\nIn accordance with our hypotheses, we focused our attention on the influence\nof the most frequently consumed hot drink (usual temperature level and\nfrequency of consumption). The sex and age group of the participants were\ntaken into account in the analyses.\n\n#### 4.3.1. Influence of the Usual Temperature Level\n\nFor the sweet and salty tastes, the sensitivity scores of subjects who\nconsumed their hot drink at a very hot level were significantly lower than\nthose of subjects who consumed their drink at a medium hot level. This\nobservation suggested the possible deleterious effect of high temperatures on\nthe ability to perceive these two tastes. The same tendency was observed for\nthe sour taste. However, this effect was not found for bitter and umami\ntastes. These last two tastes are known to depend on a genetic polymorphism\nthat explains the inability of a small proportion of the population to\nproperly perceive the tastes of certain bitter or umami molecules\n[28,29,30,31]. Therefore, it is possible that, in some cases, the low\nsensitivity scores obtained for these two tastes was due to this genetic\ninability rather than to their drinking habits for hot drinks. In this\nsituation, these particular cases would have degraded the relationship that we\nexpected. In fact, subjects who do not have suitable receptors for bitter or\numami molecules cannot satisfactorily perceive the corresponding tastes,\nregardless of their hot drink consumption habits. In any case, the results\npartially validated our hypothesis on the possible deleterious effect of high\ntemperatures linked to the consumption of very hot drinks.\n\n#### 4.3.2. Influence of the Consumption Frequency\n\nWe hypothesized that a high consumption frequency would be an aggravating\nfactor in the deleterious effects of high temperatures. The results only\npartially confirmed this hypothesis. In fact, there was only a significant\neffect for the sweet taste, and the p values observed for the other tastes\nwere far from the significance threshold. These results suggested that the\nfrequency of hot drink consumption generally has little or no significant\neffect on the ability to perceive tastes. However, the effect of the\nconsumption frequency may not be linear. In this case, the consumption\nfrequencies of our panel, although presenting a certain variability, were\nperhaps globally above a threshold beyond which the variations in consumption\nfrequency no longer had any influence on taste sensitivity. It should be noted\nthat our panel was composed of regular consumers of hot drinks. A\ncomplementary study comparing non-consumers, occasional consumers, and regular\nconsumers of hot drinks would perhaps more clearly show a consumption\nfrequency effect.\n\n#### 4.3.3. Influence of Age\n\nOur study showed that the ability to perceive low concentrations of fructose,\nsodium chloride, citric acid, quinine hydrochloride, and monosodium glutamate\ndecreases with increasing age. Literature on the impact of age on taste\nabilities is abundant. Booth et al. [13] and Methven et al. [17] performed\nvery comprehensive reviews on the subject. Comparisons of the results of the\nvarious studies cited in these reviews reveal some contradictory results, but,\noverall, a decline in taste capacity with increasing age was often\nhighlighted. Most of the apparent contradictions highlighted by these\nliterature reviews can probably be explained by differences in the selected\nmethodologies. Concerning the detection thresholds, the authors of [17] showed\nthat a very large majority of the 23 studies included in the meta-analysis\nconcluded that the detection thresholds increased with age (70% of studies for\nbitter and sweet tastes, 80% for salty and sour tastes, and 100% studies for\numami taste (two studies only)). Our results were consistent with this general\nobservation. According to Methven et al. [17] and Mojet et al. [16], a decline\nin tasting capacity would not occur until after the age of 60 years. Our\nresults showed that it could happen a little sooner than that. In fact, our\nresults showed that a decline seemed to begin after 35 years and become\nsignificant after 50 years. Even if the reduction in salivary flow is\nsometimes a reason given to explain the lower sensitivity observed in older\npeople [32], in our case, we can exclude this possibility because the salivary\nflows observed for the different age groups were not significantly different.\nMoreover, the subjects involved in our study were not \u201cvery old,\u201d since they\nwere at most 65 years old.\n\n#### 4.3.4. Influence of Sex\n\nWe showed that women\u2019s sensitivity scores were, on average, significantly\nhigher than that of men for the sour, bitter, and umami tastes. The same trend\nwas observed for the sweet taste. However, we did not find any significant\ndifference for the salty taste. The literature on the differences in taste\nsensitivity between males and females has revealed seemingly contradictory\nresults. These contradictions very clearly appeared in a paper by Mojet et al.\n[16], in which the conclusions of several studies were listed. It is therefore\npossible to find references in a similar vein to our results, as well as also\nreferences that are in disagreement. The diversity of the studied populations,\nused approaches, and used tests to estimate taste sensitivity probably explain\na large part of these contradictions. We can still say that, according to the\nliterature, when a difference has been noted between the two sexes, it has\nalmost always been in favor of a greater sensitivity in women\n[12,16,32,33,34,35,36]. The results of our study support this general\nobservation about differences in taste sensitivity between men and women.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 5\\. Strengths and Limitations\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that the link between the consumption\nof very hot drinks and the ability to perceive tastes has been studied. The\nhypothesis that the consumption of very hot drinks could have a deleterious\neffect on taste sensitivity was raised from the fact, both simple and strong,\nthat hot drinks are sometimes taken into the mouth at temperatures likely to\ncause cell damage on the tongue.\n\nFor this study, which should be considered a first approach that was intended\nto give an initial insight into the strength of the studied factors, we chose\nto evaluate the temperature perceived during the consumption of hot drinks\nusing a questionnaire (self-reported temperature level). The primary reason\nthat guided this choice was the cumbersome nature of the protocols implemented\nto obtain a reliable objective/instrumental measurement of the consumption\ntemperature [2,6,8], which was accentuated by the number of drinks we targeted\n(four drinks) and the number of participants involved in our study (n = 82).\nFor a preliminary test, we preferred the subjective measurement presented in\nthis document.\n\nThe risk associated with using self-reported temperature levels is that among\nsubjects who reported drinking \u201cvery hot\u201d there were likely many subjects who\nactually drink their hot drinks at very high temperatures. However, a few\nsubjects who are used to drinking at lower temperatures may have responded\n\u201cvery hot\u201d because they have a high temperature sensitivity or low tolerance\nto high temperatures. We could have the opposite reasoning for the subjects\nwho declared drinking \u201cmedium hot.\u201d However, we believe that this potential\nbias related to the subjective perception of temperature or tolerance for high\ntemperature is likely to reduce the significance of the links observed between\nthe consumption temperature and sensitivity for sweet and salty tastes\u2014not\nexacerbate it. Indeed, if our hypothesis concerning the deleterious effect of\nhigh temperatures is correct, then the situation that would maximize the\nsignificance of this effect would correspond to the case where all the\nsubjects who drink at high/low temperatures, respectively, answer \u201cvery\nhot\u201d/\u201cmedium hot.\u201d This is the reason that we are confident about the observed\neffects, even though we believe that further experimentation is necessary to\nfully verify these preliminary results.\n\nSeveral other pieces of evidence suggest that a self-reported temperature\nlevel measurement makes sense, although it is not as accurate as an\ninstrumental measurement. First, an IARC report specified that drinking\ntemperature can be considered \u201chot\u201d between 50 and 65 \u00b0C and \u201cvery hot\u201d at\ntemperatures above 65 \u00b0C [1,10]. This indicates that these two terms used in\neveryday language cover a physical reality. Second, the attribution of a term,\nfor example \u201cvery hot,\u201d to qualify the perceived temperature of a food results\nfrom a lesson partly based on collective experience, i.e., on the opinions\nexpressed by other people about shared experiences. The use of these terms is\ntherefore probably relatively homogeneous. Moreover, a study conducted by\nDirler et al. [6] showed that, on average, coffee was perceived as \u201ctoo hot\u201d\nfor temperatures beyond 66 \u00b0C, with a standard deviation of 3 \u00b0C. This very\nsmall standard deviation suggests that the judgments made by the subjects\nregarding the temperature of their drinks are relatively homogeneous.\n\nDespite these arguments, it would be interesting to extend this study into a\nsimilar work based on the instrumental evaluation on the temperatures of hot\ndrinks. These measurements could relate to all the hot drinks consumed to\naccount for a possible additional effect of occasionally consumed drinks. The\nstudy could even be extended to solid foods. Indeed, solid foods can also\noccasionally be vectors of high temperatures. For example, a study by\nLachenmeier and Lachenmeier [37] showed that a slice of 2.5-mm-thick boiled\npotato with a temperature of 70 \u00b0C could cause the tongue temperature to rise\nto almost 55 \u00b0C. Physiological measurements, in particular those intended to\ncompare the state of the papillae and taste buds in consumers of very hot\nversus moderately hot foods, would provide a better understanding of the\norigin of the effects observed in this study. Finally, the influence of\ntexture sensitivity on hot drink consumption habits (usual temperature) and\nthe influence of thermal status on taste perception thresholds could be\ninteresting factors to study in future work.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nOur results complement current knowledge regarding the effect of age and sex\non taste sensitivity. This study also provided new knowledge suggesting that\nthe very high temperatures delivered by hot drinks could have a negative\neffect on the ability to perceive low concentrations of certain tastes. These\nresults constitute a first contribution to the study of high temperatures as a\nsource of variation in taste sensitivity.
