Low socioeconomic status, social isolation, hearing impairment,\nstroke, diabetes, heart disease, and depression were all associated with a\nhigher risk of YOD.\n\nVitamin D deficiency and high levels of the C-reactive protein (produced by\nthe liver in response to inflammation) also meant a higher risk, as did having\ntwo of the ApoE4 \u03b54 gene variants (a genetic scenario already linked to\nAlzheimer's disease).\n\nThe researchers described the relationship between alcohol and YOD as\n\"complex\". While alcohol abuse led to an increased risk, moderate to heavy\ndrinking correlated with a reduced risk \u2013 possibly because people in this\nsecond group are usually healthier in general (bear in mind that those who\nabstain from alcohol often do so on medical grounds).\n\nHigher levels of formal education and lower physical frailty (measured through\nhigher handgrip strength) were also associated with a lower YOD risk. This all\nhelps to fill in some of the knowledge gaps around YOD.\n\n\"We already knew from research on people who develop dementia at older age\nthat there are a series of modifiable risk factors,\" said neuroepidemiologist\nSebastian K\u00f6hler from Maastricht University in the Netherlands.\n\n\"In addition to physical factors, mental health also plays an important role,\nincluding avoiding chronic stress, loneliness and depression.\"\n\nWhile the results don't prove dementia is caused by these factors, they help\nbuild a more detailed picture. As always in this kind of research, knowing\nmore about the causes can help develop better treatments and preventative\nmeasures.\n\nMany of these factors are modifiable, which offers more hope for those working\nto find ways to beat dementia rather than just manage it. Ultimately, dementia\nmay be something we can reduce the risk of by living healthier lives.\n\n\"Young-onset dementia has a very serious impact, because the people affected\nusually still have a job, children, and a busy life,\" said neuroscientist\nStevie Hendriks, from Maastricht University.\n\n\"The cause is often assumed to be genetic, but for many people we don't\nactually know exactly what the cause is. This is why we also wanted to\ninvestigate other risk factors in this study.\"\n\nThe research has been published in JAMA Neurology.\n\nA version of this article was first published in January 2024.\n\nTrending News\n\nBrain Autopsies Reveal a Potential New Culprit Behind Alzheimer's Disease\nHealth2 days ago\n\nCommon Blood Pressure Drug Increases Lifespan And Slows Aging in Animals\nHealth6 days ago\n\nScientists Solved a 50-Year Mystery of What Punched The Giant Hole in\nAntarctic Ice Nature1 day ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
