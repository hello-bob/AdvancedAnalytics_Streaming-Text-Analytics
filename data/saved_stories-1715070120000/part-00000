Despite working with a little more than half of\nthe money that Boeing received, SpaceX beat the company to launch, testing its\nCrew Dragon capsule in May 2020.\n\n> Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX\n> only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner.\n>\n> Note, the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with\n> Dragon 1.\n>\n> Too many non-technical managers at Boeing. https://t.co/bTXWAfxfrh\n>\n> \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 6, 2024\n\nMusk seemed to imply in his Monday tweet that part of the reason Boeing racked\nup more than a billion dollars in cost overruns is because of its approach to\nmanagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Too many non-technical managers at Boeing,\" Musk tweeted.\n\nTechnical managers typically oversee technical projects, offering hands-on\nexperience and subject matter expertise in hard skills like coding and\nsoftware engineering. Non-technical managers, meanwhile, tend to be focused on\nbroader aspects of a company like strategic planning, communication, and\ndecision-making.\n\nBoeing did not immediately respond to Business Insider's response for comment.\n\nMusk has opined about non-technical managers in the past, writing in a May\n2020 tweet that he \"strongly\" believes \"all managers in a technical area much\nbe technically excellent.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Managers in software must write great software or it's like being a cavalry\ncaptain who can't ride a horse!\" the billionaire wrote.\n\nMusk's Monday post came just hours after Tesla sent out a fourth round of\nlayoff notices on Sunday evening. The company announced it was cutting more\nthan 10% of its workforce last month. Musk cited a \"duplication of roles and\njob functions in certain areas\" as the reason for the cuts.\n\nThe house-cleaning has impacted multiple different teams, including several\nexecutives. Musk told higher-ups last week that Tesla needed to be \"absolutely\nhardcore about headcount,\" The Information reported.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: 5 ways Elon Musk shook up Twitter as CEO\n\nElon Musk Tesla\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
