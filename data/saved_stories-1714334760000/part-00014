In a scenario where you\nneed to identify a specific resource, it is only logical to have a unique ID\nfor each resource. Well, there is, and it's called Amazon Resource Name (ARN).\n\nIn this article, you will understand ARNs and their significance within the\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. You'll get to dissect the structure of an\nARN and how you can retrieve them. By the end of this article, identifying and\ndeciphering ARNs will be a breeze for you.\n\n## What Is an ARN?\n\nAn ARN is a unique identifier assigned to each resource in AWS. It is a string\nthat's used to identify resources within the AWS ecosystem. ARNs identify\nresources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets, IAM (Identity and\nAccess Management) users, roles, policies, and others within AWS.\n\nARNs are required to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS. They\nare used in various AWS services and APIs to identify resources and grant\npermissions. This means that each resource can be identified uniquely\nregardless of the AWS region or AWS account it belongs to.\n\nThis universality allows AWS services to accurately locate and manage\nresources irrespective of their location or ownership. For example, an IAM\npolicy attached to a user in one AWS account can refer to an S3 bucket in\nanother AWS account by using the ARN of the bucket, ensuring that the policy\nis applied correctly.\n\n## Why are ARNs Important?\n\nAside from uniquely identifying resources, ARNs play a crucial role in the AWS\necosystem. They can allow you to access your resources programmatically, which\nis essential when using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like\nCloudFormation, Terraform, OpenTofu etc.\n\nAlongside this, below are a few reasons why you should pay more attention to\nARNs:\n\n  * Resource-Level Permissions: Some AWS services allow you to specify resource-level permissions, granting different levels of access to various resources within the same service. ARNs play a vital role in defining these resource-level permissions accurately. For instance, you can grant read access to one S3 bucket and write access to another S3 bucket within the same AWS account.\n  * Cross-Service References: ARNs enable cross-service references, allowing resources from one AWS service to interact with resources from another service. For example, an IAM policy attached to an EC2 instance might reference an S3 bucket using its ARN, enabling the instance to access the bucket securely.\n  * API Operations: When interacting with AWS programmatically through APIs or SDKs, ARNs are used to reference resources. APIs and SDKs provide methods for constructing ARNs based on the type of resource and its attributes, making it easier to work with them programmatically. For example, when making an API call to retrieve information about an EC2 instance, you would typically specify the ARN of the instance.\n  * IAM Policies: An everyday use case for ARNs is in IAM policies. These policies define who can access which resources and what actions they can perform. ARNs are used to specify the resources to which the policy applies. With ARNs, you can granularly define IAM policies to allow or deny access to specific resources within AWS.\n  * Auditing and Logging: ARNs are often included in AWS CloudTrail logs and other auditing mechanisms. When you include ARNs in your logs, you can track which resources were accessed, modified, or deleted, providing a detailed audit trail of activities within your AWS account.\n  * Resource Tagging: An optional but useful ability of ARNs is their integration with resource tagging. Tags are key-value pairs that provide metadata about resources. By combining ARNs with tags, you can create policies that apply to resources with specific tags, making it easier to manage resources at scale.\n\n## Structure of an ARN\n\nAWS resource ARNs have a specific structure consisting of various components\ncalled namespaces. Each namespace provides a particular piece of information\nabout the resource being identified. ARNs are delimited by colons (:) and have\nthe following general format:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource\n\nBelow is a breakdown of each component of an ARN:\n\n  1. ARN Prefix: The ARN always starts with the characters arn:.\n  2. Partition: The partition that the resource is in. This is usually aws but can also be aws-cn for resources in China or aws-us-gov in AWS GovCloud (US).\n  3. Service: This part of the ARN specifies the AWS service that the resource belongs to. For example, s3 for Amazon S3, ec2 for Amazon EC2, iam for IAM, etc.\n  4. Region: The region where the resource is located. This component is optional and is only present for region-specific resources, such as EC2 instances. If the resource is global, this part is omitted. An example of a region component is us-west-2 for the US West (Oregon) region.\n  5. Account ID: The AWS account ID that owns the resource. This is a 12-digit number unique to each AWS account. It can be your account ID or the account ID of another AWS account if you are referencing a resource in a different account. This ID looks like 123456789012.\n  6. Resource ID: The unique identifier for the resource within the account. This part of the ARN uniquely identifies the resource within the account. It can be the resource's name or a unique identifier generated by AWS.\n\nThere are variations in the structure of ARNs depending on the resource type.\nFor example, some ARNs include a resource type in addition to the resource ID,\nseparated by a colon (:) or a slash (/).\n\nThe following are examples of different ARN variations:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type:resource-id\n\n  * Variation 1 (Slash Separator): In this format, the resource type and the resource ID are separated by a forward slash (/). This format is commonly used for certain AWS services, such as Amazon S3 buckets. Example:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket\n\n  * Variation 2 (Colon Separator): In this format, the resource type and the resource ID are separated by a colon (:). This format is used for most other AWS services. Example:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0\n\nNOTE: The choice of separator doesn't affect the functionality of the ARN;\nit's merely a convention used by AWS. However, adhering to the appropriate\nformat for a given service is essential for consistency.\n\n## ARN Paths\n\nIn addition to the standard ARN structure, some resources support using ARN\npaths. ARN paths are a way to organize and structure resources within AWS\nservices that support hierarchical resource naming. They allow you to organize\nresources in a tree-like structure, similar to a file system hierarchy.\n\nARN paths are appended to the end of the ARN and are separated by a forward\nslash (/). The path components represent the hierarchy of the resources, with\neach element specifying a level in the hierarchy. You can use paths to group\nrelated resources or represent parent-child relationships between resources.\n\nFor example, an S3 bucket can have objects stored within it. You can use an\nARN path to specify the bucket and object within it. The path would look like\nthis:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/example-folder/example-object\n\nIn this example, example-bucket is the S3 bucket, example-folder is a folder\nwithin the bucket, and example-object is an object stored within the folder.\nThe path components are separated by forward slashes to indicate the\nhierarchy.\n\n## ARN Wildcards\n\nThe flexibility of ARNs extends further with the use of wildcards. Wildcards\nare special characters that can be used in ARNs to represent multiple\nresources or resource types. They provide a way to specify a group of\nresources or all resources of a certain type without explicitly listing each\none.\n\nWildcards can be particularly useful when working with IAM policies, AWS\nresource policies, and certain AWS CLI commands. Especially when you want to\ngrant permissions or perform actions on multiple resources that share a common\npattern.\n\nThe most common wildcard used in ARNs is the asterisk (*) character. The\nasterisk wildcard matches zero or more characters within the ARN component.\nIt's often used to match multiple resources or values in policy or resource\nspecification.\n\nFor example, in an IAM policy, \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::*\" grants access to\nall S3 buckets in the AWS account.\n\nBelow is an example IAM policy statement using a wildcard in the ARN:\n\n    \n    \n    { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*\" }\n\nIn this example, the wildcard (*) is used after the bucket name (example-\nbucket) to match all objects within the specified S3 bucket.\n\nAside from the asterisk wildcard, there is another wildcard character that you\ncan use in ARNs. This is the question mark (?) wildcard. The question mark\nwildcard matches exactly one character within the ARN component. It's used to\nmatch a single character in a specific position within the ARN.\n\nAn example of using the question mark wildcard in an ARN is:\n\n    \n    \n    { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/prefix?/object\" }\n\nIn this example, the question mark wildcard (?) matches a single character in\nthe path component of the ARN. This allows you to specify a more specific\npattern for matching resources.\n\n## How to Retrieve ARNs\n\nThere are several ways to retrieve the ARNs of your AWS resources. The method\nyou choose will depend on your preference and the tools you have available.\n\nBelow are some common methods for finding the ARNs of your AWS resources:\n\n  1. AWS Management Console: The AWS Management Console provides an easy way to view the ARNs of your resources. Typically, you'd follow these steps:\n\n  * Navigate to the specific service in the AWS Management Console where the resource whose ARN you want to retrieve is located.\n  * Locate the resource you're interested in (e.g., an S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, an IAM role).\n  * Typically, the ARN of the resource should be displayed somewhere in the resource's details or settings.\n  * Copy the ARN from the console and use it as needed.\n\n2\\. AWS CLI Commands: You can also use AWS CLI commands to retrieve ARNs\nprogrammatically. Below are examples of AWS CLI commands to retrieve the ARNs\nof different resources:\n\n  * To retrieve the ARN of an S3 bucket:\n\n    \n    \n    aws s3api get-bucket-arn --bucket your-bucket-name\n\n  * To retrieve the ARN of an EC2 instance:\n\n    \n    \n    aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids your-instance-id --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].Arn' --output text\n\n  * Replace your-bucket-name and your-instance-id with the actual names or IDs of the resources you're interested in.\n\n3\\. AWS CloudFormation Outputs: If you're using AWS CloudFormation to\nprovision and manage your AWS resources, you can retrieve ARNs from\nCloudFormation stack outputs. This method is useful when you want to automate\nthe retrieval of ARNs as part of your infrastructure deployment process.\n\n  * Define an output for the ARN of the resource in your CloudFormation template:\n\n    \n    \n    Outputs: MyResourceArn: Description: \"ARN of my resource.\" Value: !GetAtt MyResource.Arn\n\n  * After deploying the CloudFormation stack, you can retrieve the output value using the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console.\n\n    \n    \n    aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name your-stack-name --query \"Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='MyResourceArn'].OutputValue\" --output text\n\n  * Replace your-stack-name with the name of your CloudFormation stack.\n\n## Common ARN Examples\n\nThere are various types of resources in AWS, each with its unique ARN format.\nBelow are some common examples of ARNs for different AWS cloud resources:\n\n  * Amazon S3 Bucket:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket\n\n  * Amazon EC2 Instance:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0\n\n  * IAM Role:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole\n\n  * Lambda Function:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:MyFunction\n\n  * CloudFormation Stack:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/MyStack/1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t\n\n  * Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Instance:\n\n    \n    \n    arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:db:my-database\n\nThese examples showcase the diversity of resources in AWS and how ARNs are\nused to identify each resource within the AWS ecosystem uniquely.\n\n## Best Practices for Working with ARNs\n\nAn ARN is a sensitive piece of information that should be handled carefully to\nensure the security and integrity of your AWS resources. This is because they\ncontain information about the resources they identify, and if exposed or\nmisused, they can lead to unauthorized access or unintended actions on your\nresources.\n\nBelow are some best practices for working with ARNs in AWS:\n\n  * Minimal Exposure: When working with ARNs in configurations, scripts, or code, avoid exposing them unnecessarily. Limit the visibility of ARNs to only those who need to know them to perform their tasks. If you're to use them, consider using variable placeholders or environment variables to store ARNs securely.\n  * Be Specific in Resource References: Whenever possible, specify resources explicitly rather than using wildcards. This helps to reduce the risk of unintended access to resources that should not be included in the policy or configuration.\n  * Use Least Privilege Principle: You should grant only the permissions necessary for a resource to perform its intended tasks. Avoid overly permissive policies that grant broader access than required. Regularly review and refine IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we covered so much about ARNs, from what they are to why they\nare essential. We also discussed how you can retrieve ARNs using different\nmethods and provided examples of common ARNs for various AWS cloud services.\n\nWhen you see an ARN, you now know that it's more than just a string of\ncharacters, and breaking down its structure can give you much information\nabout the resource it represents.\n\n### The Practical DevOps Newsletter\n\nYour weekly source of expert tips, real-world scenarios, and streamlined\nworkflows!\n\n###\n\nPrince Onyeanuna\n\nTwitter\n\nPrince is a technical writer and DevOps engineer who believes in the power of\nshowing up.
