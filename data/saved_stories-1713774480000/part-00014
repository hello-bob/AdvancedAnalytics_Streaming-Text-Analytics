This conventional wisdom typically refers to what\nhappens to your money when your life comes to an end, but it also applies to\nthe toys, gadgets, and Legend of Zelda collectibles we obsess over in our\ndaily lives. And in the late \u201880s, however, it was a hard truth for gaming. A\ndecade earlier, gamers could only get their fix in arcades, so the advent of\nhome consoles felt like a true revolution. Who would\u2019ve thought that in just a\nfew short years the home console breakthrough would give way to portable\nconsoles? Gunpei Yokoi, that\u2019s who.\n\nYokoi was the head of Nintendo\u2019s research and development division and had\nhelped create titles like Donkey Kong, Metroid and Super Mario Brothers. He is\nwidely credited as the creator of the Game Boy, which celebrates its 35th\nanniversary this month, and the story behind its success still feels familiar\nthree decades later.\n\nLaunching on April 21, 1989, the Game Boy wasn\u2019t going to win any beauty\ncontests. A small gray box with a dim green screen, Nintendo\u2019s handheld was\nundersized on purpose. Yokoi was inspired to develop portable consoles after\nwatching a Japanese businessman playing with a pocket calculator on a train.\nHis first iteration of the concept was the iconic Game and Watch series, which\ncombined simple games with, wait for it, a digital watch. Nintendo produced\ndozens of Game and Watch titles of varied success, but Yokoi\u2019s team felt the\nreal breakthrough would be in a portable console that ran cartridges, just\nlike the NES did at home.\n\nMuch like with today\u2019s Switch, Nintendo\u2019s approach to the Game Boy wasn\u2019t\nabout making the most powerful console with the best graphics around. It was\ncentered on the user experience and driven by creating the best game library\npossible. Competitors like Sega\u2019s Game Gear and Atari\u2019s Lynx took the opposite\napproach. They boasted full-color, backlit screens and 16-bit graphics. They\nalso had abysmal battery life. An analysis from Real Engineering showed that,\nadjusted for inflation, it cost $2.30 an hour to run a Game Gear. Nintendo\u2019s\nGame Boy? An economical 16 cents.\n\nDr. Mario is no substitute for med school, unfortunately.\n\nNintendo of America\n\nThe Game Boy\u2019s low-fi approach worked out in the end, moving more than 118\nmillion units in its lifespan. However, it almost destroyed the project, too.\nNintendo\u2019s president at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi, actually canceled the Game\nBoy after testing a prototype because the pixel quality was too low.\nFortunately, new technology from Sharp came shortly after his decision that\nallowed for a better screen and, in Yamauchi\u2019s eyes, an acceptable product.\n\nYokoi described his philosophy as Kareta Gijutsu no Suihei Shik\u014d which\ntranslates to \u201cLateral Thinking with Withered Technology.\u201d In essence, it\nmeans relying on existing technology as much as possible to create products.\nThe Game Boy screen wasn\u2019t as impressive as its peers, but that didn\u2019t matter\nto fans who got hooked on games like Tetris and Super Mario Bros. World. It\nembraced simple things like a headphone jack and an on/off switch that\nphysically locked a cartridge in place for stability. The tech for the system\nlink cable, which helped turn Pok\u00e9mon into an international multiplayer\nsensation through battles and trades, actually came from an electronic mahjong\ngame.\n\nThe rolling Nintendo logo on the startup screen is another interesting\ninnovation that serves a dual purpose. There\u2019s data for the logo stored on the\nGame Boys internal memory that has to sync with data on the cartridge in order\nfor a game to launch. If the connection was faulty, it wouldn\u2019t work. This was\noften remedied by the infamous \u201cblow in it\u201d technique to remove dust and\ndebris and establish a clean connection. Also, by requiring the Nintendo logo\nto be programmed into the cartridge, Nintendo could easily police bootleg\ngames that attempted to use it without licensing.\n\nIf you can hear this picture its probably time to schedule your first\ncolonoscopy.\n\nNintendo\n\nIt\u2019s easy to measure the enormous financial success of the Game Boy with units\nsold and games shipped, but its cultural impact is even larger, if harder to\nquantify. Game Boy changed the way we thought about games as an experience.\nThey went from a fixed entertainment to a mobile distraction seemingly\novernight. It would be nearly two decades later until smartphones put movies\nand TV shows in our pockets (not to mention loads more games). And crucially\nfor Nintendo the Game Boy was a proving ground for what\u2019s become a pillar of\nthe company\u2019s philosophy. Great games, not great tech, are what connect with\npeople.\n\nSubscribe for free to Inverse\u2019s award-winning daily newsletter!\n\nMore Like This\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * Video Games\n  * Technology\n  * Nintendo\n\n", "frontpage": false}
