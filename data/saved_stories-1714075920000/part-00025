Among the species\nsequenced for this study, more than 800 have never had their DNA sequenced\nbefore.\n\nThe sheer amount of data unlocked by this research, which would take a single\ncomputer 18 years to process, is a huge stride towards building a tree of life\nfor all 330,000 known species of flowering plants\u2014a massive undertaking by\nKew's Tree of Life Initiative.\n\nDr. Alexandre Zuntini, Research Fellow at RBG Kew, says, \"Analyzing this\nunprecedented amount of data to decode the information hidden in millions of\nDNA sequences was a huge challenge. But it also offered the unique opportunity\nto reevaluate and extend our knowledge of the plant tree of life, opening a\nnew window to explore the complexity of plant evolution.\"\n\nThe Angiosperm Tree of Life was built on 15 times more data than comparable\nstudies and was involved sequencing more than 9,500 different species of\nflowering plants. Credit: RBG Kew\n\nUnlocking historic herbarium specimens for cutting-edge research\n\nThe flowering plant tree of life, much like our own family tree, enables us to\nunderstand how different species are related to each other. The tree of life\nis uncovered by comparing DNA sequences between different species to identify\nchanges (mutations) that accumulate over time like a molecular fossil record.\n\nOur understanding of the tree of life is improving rapidly in tandem with\nadvances in DNA sequencing technology. For this study, new genomic techniques\nwere developed to magnetically capture hundreds of genes and hundreds of\nthousands of letters of genetic code from every sample, orders of magnitude\nmore than earlier methods.\n\nA key advantage of the team's approach is that it enables a wide diversity of\nplant material, old and new, to be sequenced, even when the DNA is badly\ndamaged. The vast treasure troves of dried plant material in the world's\nherbarium collections, which comprise nearly 400 million scientific specimens\nof plants, can now be studied genetically.\n\nUsing such specimens, the team successfully sequenced a sandwort specimen\n(Arenaria globiflora) collected nearly 200 years ago in Nepal and, despite the\npoor quality of its DNA, were able to place it in the tree of life.\n\nThe team even analyzed extinct plants, such has the Guadalupe Island olive\n(Hesperelaea palmeri), which has not been seen alive since 1875. In fact, 511\nof the species sequenced are already at risk of extinction, according to the\nIUCN Red List, including three more like Hesperelaea that are already extinct.\n\nProfessor William Baker, Senior Research Leader\u2013Tree of Life, says, \"In many\nways this novel approach has allowed us to collaborate with the botanists of\nthe past by tapping into the wealth of data locked up in historic herbarium\nspecimens, some of which were collected as far back as the early 19th century.\n\n\"Our illustrious predecessors such as Charles Darwin or Joseph Hooker could\nnot have anticipated how important these specimens would be in genomic\nresearch today. DNA was not even discovered in their lifetimes!\n\n\"Our work shows just how important these incredible botanical museums are to\nground-breaking studies of life on Earth. Who knows what other undiscovered\nscience opportunities lie within them?\"\n\nAcross all 9,506 species sequenced, more than 3,400 came from material sourced\nfrom 163 herbaria in 48 countries. Additional material from plant collections\naround the world (e.g., DNA banks, seeds, living collections) have been vital\nfor filling key knowledge gaps to shed new light on the history of flowering\nplant evolution. The team also benefited from publicly available data for more\nthan 1,900 species, highlighting value of the open science approach to future\ngenomic research.\n\n## Illuminating Darwin's abominable mystery\n\nFlowering plants alone account for about 90% of all known plant life on land\nand are found virtually everywhere on the planet\u2014from the steamiest tropics to\nthe rocky outcrops of the Antarctic Peninsula. And yet, our understanding of\nhow these plants came to dominate the scene soon after their origin has\nbaffled scientists for generations, including Charles Darwin.\n\nFlowering plants originated more than 140 million years ago after which they\nrapidly overtook other vascular plants including their closest living\nrelatives\u2014the gymnosperms (non-flowering plants that have naked seeds, such as\ncycads, conifers, and ginkgo).\n\nDarwin was mystified by the seemingly sudden appearance of such diversity in\nthe fossil record. In an 1879 letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker, his close\nconfidant and Director of RBG Kew, he wrote, \"The rapid development as far as\nwe can judge of all the higher plants within recent geological times is an\nabominable mystery.\"\n\nUtilizing 200 fossils, the authors scaled their tree of life to time,\nrevealing how flowering plants evolved across geological time. They found that\nearly flowering plants did indeed explode in diversity, giving rise to more\nthan 80% of the major lineages that exist today shortly after their origin.\n\nHowever, this trend then declined to a steadier rate for the next 100 million\nyears until another surge in diversification about 40 million years ago,\ncoinciding with a global decline in temperatures. These new insights would\nhave fascinated Darwin and will surely help today's scientists grappling with\nthe challenges of understanding how and why species diversify.\n\nThe oldest plant sequenced for the study was a dried herbarium specimen of\nArenaria globiflora collected in 1829 by Nathaniel Wallich.

In total,\n279 authors were involved in the research, representing many different\nnationalities from 138 organizations in 27 countries. They include the\nGenomics for Australian Plants (GAP) consortium who were early adopters of the\nteam's techniques and who worked in close collaboration with Kew to maximize\nthe number of Australian plant species in the tree.\n\nInternational collaborators also shared their unique botanical expertise, as\nwell as many precious plant samples from around the world that could not be\nobtained without their help. The comprehensive nature of the tree is in no\nsmall part a result of this wonderful partnership.\n\nDr. Mabel Lum, Program Manager at Bioplatforms Australia and from the GAP\nconsortium, says, \"We are proud to be a major partner and collaborator in RBG\nKew's effort to build global research infrastructure to advance our\nunderstanding of flowering plant tree of life. This fruitful collaboration\nunderscored our commitment to fostering innovation and collaboration in\nscientific research, providing a springboard for future discoveries that will\nhelp shape our understanding of the natural world for generations to come.\"\n\nAlstonia spectabilis is a species of medicinal importance to the indigenous\nTetun people and has been sequenced for the very first time. Credit: RBG Kew\n\nPutting the plant tree of life to good use\n\nThe flowering plant tree of life has enormous potential in biodiversity\nresearch. This is because, just as one can predict the properties of an\nelement based on its position in the periodic table, the location of a species\nin the tree of life allows us to predict its properties. The new data will\nthus be invaluable for enhancing many areas of science and beyond.\n\nTo enable this, the tree and all of the data that underpin it have been made\nopenly and freely accessible to both the public and scientific community,\nincluding through the Kew Tree of Life Explorer. The study's authors believe\nsuch open access is key to democratizing access to scientific data across the\nglobe.\n\nOpen access will also help scientists to make the best use of the data, such\nas combining it with artificial intelligence to predict which plant species\nmay include molecules with medicinal potential. Similarly, the tree of life\ncan be used to better understand and predict how pests and diseases are going\nto affect the plants of the U.K. in the future. Ultimately, the authors note,\nthe applications of this data will be driven by the ingenuity of the\nscientists accessing it.\n\nDr. Melanie-Jayne Howes, Senior Research Leader at RBG Kew who was not an\nauthor on the study but will make use of the data in her research, says,\n\"Plant chemicals have inspired many pharmaceutical drugs, but still have great\nuntapped potential to aid future drug discovery. The challenge is knowing\nwhich to investigate scientifically in the search for new medicines out of the\nca. 330,000 flowering plant species.\n\n\"At Kew we are applying AI to predict which plant species contain chemicals\nwith pharmaceutical potential for malaria. The availability of this vast new\ndataset offers exciting opportunities to enhance these predictions and hence\naccelerate drug discovery from plants for malaria and other diseases too.\"\n\nThe new tree of life has reclassified the family and genus of Medusanthera\nlaxiflora, a small tropical tree with bizarre fruit. Credit: Danilo Tandang\n\nRemarkable species in the flowering plant tree of life\n\n  * Extinct due to feral goats: Hesperelaea palmeri, also known as Guadalupe Island olive (olivo de la Isla de Guadalupe). Sequenced from an herbarium specimen at Kew collected on Guadalupe Island, off Baja California, Mexico in 1875 by medical doctor Edward Palmer. A tree belonging to the olive family (Oleaceae), it is now extinct because of overgrazing by non-native goats.\n\n  * Oldest specimen sequenced: Arenaria globiflora, also known as Nepalese sandwort. Sequenced from an herbarium specimen at Kew collected in 1829 by Nathaniel Wallich. This remarkable specimen comes from a Himalayan mountain plant that grows at over 3,600m.\n\n  * Parasitic plant family mystery solved: Pilostyles aethiopica, member of the stemsucker family (Apodanthaceae). Sequenced from plant tissue collected in Zimbabwe in 2012 by Kew's Sidonie Bellot. This weird parasite lives inside the branches of other plants and is only visible when it erupts into flower. Previously thought to be closely related to pumpkins and begonias (Cucurbitales), study found it sits in the group Malpighiales.\n\n  * Bizarre tropical tree reclassified: Medusanthera laxiflora, member of the buff-beech family (Stemonuraceae). Sequenced from an herbarium specimen at Kew collected in Indonesian New Guinea in 1993. This small tropical tree with bizarre pin fruits was previously classified alongside the holly family. New tree of life has reclassified its genus and family into a whole new order.\n\n  * Bamboo from Hooker's 1850s Himalayan expedition: Cephalostachyum capitatum, member of the grass family (Poaceae). Sequenced from an herbarium specimen collected in India in 1850 by Joseph Hooker, RBG Kew's second director, and his friend Thomas Thomson.\n\n  * Medicinal plant sequenced for the very first time: Alstonia spectabilis, also known as Kroti metan by Tetun people. Sequenced from an herbarium specimen at Kew collected in Papua New Guinea in 1954. This massive, 20m tall tree is found in the rainforests of SE Asia and Australia. Despite being medicinally important to the Tetun people of West Timor to treat malaria, as well as being a valuable source of timber, its DNA has never been sequenced before.\n\nMore information: Zuntini, A.
