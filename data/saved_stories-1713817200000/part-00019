X will have the opportunity to argue against the injunction request in two days' time before a final decision is made.\n\nThe eSafety commissioner has been granted a two-day legal injunction to compel\nX to hide posts that include graphic footage relating to the Wakeley stabbing.\n\nX has been ordered to hide the material from all users worldwide until\nWednesday at 5pm, when the matter will be considered again in more detail.\n\nThe eSafety commissioner last week ordered X, formerly known as Twitter, and\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, to take down the Wakeley-related\nmaterial.\n\nMeta did so, but X objected, accusing the commissioner of overstepping her\nlegal powers. The platform had threatened legal action, but said it would\ncomply in the interim.\n\nBut now the eSafety commissioner has taken the matter to court, arguing X has\nfailed to comply with the law because its interim action was to \"geoblock\" the\ncontent, not delete it.\n\n### Opposition backs social media crackdown after Sydney stabbings\n\nElon Musk's attempts to fight orders to remove graphic footage of the Sydney\nstabbings from X provokes fury among federal politicians, who are renewing\ntheir focus on punishing social media platforms that host misinformation and\nharmful content.\n\nRead more\n\nGeoblocking means the content cannot be viewed in Australia, but this can be\ncircumvented by anyone using a virtual private network (VPN), which obscures a\nuser's location.\n\nLawyers for the eSafety Commission told the federal court geoblocking was not\nenough to comply with the Online Safety Act.\n\nThat law empowers the eSafety commissioner to order the removal of material\nthat \"promotes, incites, instructs in or depicts abhorrent violent conduct,\nsuch as kidnapping, rape, torture, murder, attempted murder and terrorist\nacts\", if it could \"go viral and cause significant harm to the Australian\ncommunity\".\n\nMarcus Hoyne, a lawyer appearing on behalf of X, sought to delay the court's\ndecision on an injunction, saying he had not been able to seek instructions\nfrom his client.\n\n\"We're just not in a position to respond to it [the application] at this\ntime,\" he said.\n\nThe judge granted a temporary injunction for two days, giving X time to\nrespond but siding with the eSafety commissioner in the meantime.\n\nThe eSafety commissioner ordered X to take down material related to the\nWakeley stabbing.(Reuters: Carlos Barria)\n\nIt means that, within 24 hours, X must hide the posts in question from all\nusers worldwide, in the form of a warning notice covering the posts, which\nusers cannot remove.\n\nX will then have the opportunity to argue against the injunction request on\nWednesday before a final decision is made.\n\nA spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner said companies like Google,\nMicrosoft, Snap and Tiktok worked with the office to remove the material.\n\n\"Some of these companies have taken additional, proactive steps to reduce\nfurther spread of the material. We thank them for those efforts,\" the\nspokesperson said.\n\n\"However, eSafety determined last Tuesday that Meta and X Corp were not taking\nadequate steps to protect Australians from this material. Consequently,\neSafety issued Class 1 notices to both companies, formally seeking removal of\nthis material from their platforms.\n\n\"In the case of X Corp, eSafety was not satisfied the actions it took\nconstituted compliance and sought this injunction from the federal court.\"\n\n## Government backs eSafety commissioner\n\nOn Sunday, a spokesperson for X had said the posts in question \"did not\nviolate X's rules on violent speech\" and argued the order was \"not within the\nscope of Australian law\".\n\n### Elon Musk refuses to take down tweets referencing Wakeley bishop stabbing\n\nPoliticians from across the country have repeatedly called on social media\ncompanies to take down any content that risks further inflaming rising\ntensions.\n\nRead more\n\nThe platform argued the government could not order it to delete a post\nworldwide.\n\n\"The eSafety commissioner does not have the authority to dictate what content\nX's users can see globally. We will robustly challenge this unlawful and\ndangerous approach in court,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nX owner Elon Musk accused the government of \"censorship\" for seeking what he\ncalled \"global content bans\".\n\nBut lawyers for eSafety argued the commissioner did have legal authority to\nmake orders about the global status of posts since VPNs meant that anything\navailable globally could be accessed in Australia.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday affirmed his full support for the\neSafety commissioner and his expectation that X comply.\n\n\"This isn't about freedom of expression ... Social media has a social\nresponsibility,\" he said.\n\nPosted 6h ago6 hours agoMon 22 Apr 2024 at 8:50am, updated 1h ago1 hours\nagoMon 22 Apr 2024 at 1:51pm\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\nMore on:\n\n  * Australia\n  * Federal Government\n  * Government and Politics\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * ### People in the crystal meth underworld have a code of silence.
