But some\ncreatures have devised devious and dramatic ways to weaponize their bodily\nfluids, expelling them in powerful streams for the purposes of attack or self-\ndefense.\n\nResearcher Elio Challita became fascinated by fluid ejections in nature when\nhe began studying an insect called the sharpshooter, which pees one droplet at\na time using a method called superpropulsion. These insects consume 300 times\ntheir own body weight per day in xylem sap, a watery solution of minerals and\nother nutrients found in the roots, stems, and leaves of plants. To\nefficiently expel the resulting waste, they use a kind of internal catapult\nthat helps overcome the surface tension in the droplets.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nChallita and a team of researchers from the Bhamla Lab at Georgia Tech decided\nto survey the biomechanics and fluid dynamics that govern fluid ejections\nacross the animal kingdom to see what commonalities they could find. Among\nothers, they identified a number of creatures that use bodily fluids as\npowerful weapons in the fight for survival. These fluid ejections defy gravity\nand rebel against traditional notions of predator-prey tactics.\n\nThe team\u2019s review, \u201cFluid Ejections in Nature,\u201d is forthcoming in the Annual\nReview of Chemical and Biological Engineering.\n\n1\\. Ringnecked Spitting Cobra\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nCobras of the Naja genus defend against threats by spitting venom with extreme\nprecision toward the eyes of an enemy, up to 6.5 feet away. These snakes\nrelease the venom through hollow microscopic fangs and can adjust the\ndistribution of their spit with rapid movements. Spitting cobras have a venom\ndischarge orifice that is more circular in shape than non-spitting species,\nwhich gives the venom more forward force. Contraction in the venom gland also\nhelps. A 90-degree bend near the lip of the orifice gives the snake more\nprecise control over venom flow. Naja pallida cobras can spit venom at average\nspeeds of 1.27 milliliters per second.\n\nReproduced from the Trustees of the Natural History Museum, London; Callum\nMair.\n\n2\\. Archerfish\n\nDwelling in mangrove-filled estuaries and freshwater streams, archerfish\nactively hunt down land-based insects such as flies and spiders, as well as\nsmall lizards, by shooting water jets out of their specialized mouths. The\nfish create these jets by raising a bony tongue to the roof of the mouth,\nwhich forms a tube from which they can expel the liquid jet. The fish can spit\nthese jets of water at speeds of 6 feet per second and accelerations of up to\n400 meters per second squared\u2014by comparison, a cheetah can accelerate at a\nrate of 10 meters per second squared. The jets have an impact force that is\nfar more powerful than the anchoring force of small insects and bugs. The\narcherfish hone their jet-shooting skills for hunting as they grow and mature,\nimproving both speed and precision. They can also estimate the trajectory of\nprey who have been struck by a jet and capture it before other predators get\nthere first.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

The lizards contract the muscles lining the veins around\nthe eyes abruptly, resulting in increased pressure that helps in the formation\nof jets. These blood jets or squirts can travel up to a distance of around 3\nfeet, and contain chemicals that are toxic to dogs, wolves, and coyotes.\n\nCredit: USFWS Mountain-Prairie / Flikr.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Bombardier Beetle\n\nBombardier beetles store a solution of hydrogen peroxide, hydroquinones, and\nalkanes in one chamber in the back of their abdomens, and another solution of\nperoxidase and catalase enzymes in a second chamber. The moment they fear\nattack from a predator such as a toad, they mix the contents of the two\nchambers, which creates an exothermic reaction, bringing the temperature of\nthe chemicals to a scalding 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The beetles discharge\nthese boiling anal chemicals in pulsed jets at an average speed of around 33\nfeet per second for approximately 11 milliseconds. The bombardier beetle can\ncontrol the direction of the spray using something known as the \u201cCoanda\neffect,\u201d a phenomenon by which the fluid flows along the curvature of a\nsurface.\n\nImage reprinted from Eisner T. and Aneshansley D., \u201cSpray aiming in the\nbombardier beetle: Photographic evidence,\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy\nof Sciences 96, no. 17 (1999): 9705-9711,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.17.9705, with permission from the National\nAcademy of Sciences.\n\nLead photo:USFWS Mountain-Prairie / Flikr\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
