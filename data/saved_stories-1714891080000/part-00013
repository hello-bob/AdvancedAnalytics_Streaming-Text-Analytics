If properly applied, the team says their findings could help drive the\ndevelopment of extremely powerful batteries and solar fuel generation.\n\nWhen announcing the breakthrough discovery, the energy scientists from Ecole\nPolytechnique Federale De Lausanne (EPFL) explained that the presence of\nphotoluminescence in semiconductors has been observed \u201cfor hundreds of years.\u201d\nThis not only includes the most common semiconductors such as silicon, but\nalso includes gold. However, the exact mechanism behind what makes gold glow\nwas never completely understood.\n\n### My Latest Videos\n\n0 seconds of 34 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n00:34\n\n00:34\n\nSome progress was reported in 1969 when researchers determined that all metals\nabsorb and emit photons. Still, how this was happening remained a mystery.\nNow, the EPFL team says their unusual collaboration with some of Europe\u2019s top\ntheoretical physicists has revealed the answer.\n\n## Quantum Mechanical Theorists Help Explain What Makes Gold Glow\n\nTo make the discovery the energy scientists created extremely thin gold films,\nranging from 13 to 113 nanometers in thickness. Creating gold sheets this thin\nis always difficult, but the researchers say the relatively new ability to\ncreate gold at this level of thinness and purity was the key to unlocking the\nmagic behind what makes gold glow without the stumbling blocks encountered by\npreviously unsuccessful efforts.\n\n\u201cWe developed very high-quality metal gold films, which put us in a unique\nposition to elucidate this process without the confounding factors of previous\nexperiments,\u201d explained Giulia Tagliabue, the head of the EFPL\u2019s Laboratory of\nNanoscience for Energy Technologies (LNET) in the School of Engineering.\n\nAfter blasting these ultra-thin gold sheets with a powerful laser, the\nresearchers conducted a detailed examination of the photoluminescent glow\nradiating off of them. While the glow was detected, the team says its results\nwere so precise and so \u201cunexpected\u201d that they left them scratching their\nheads.\n\n\u201cWe observed certain quantum mechanical effects emerging in films of up to\nabout 40 nanometers, which was unexpected because normally, for a metal, you\ndon\u2019t see such effects until you go well below 10 nm,\u201d Tagliabue explained.\n\nSuspecting that a quantum mechanical process may be at work, the team reached\nout to physics theoreticians from the Barcelona Institute of Science and\nTechnology, the University of Southern Denmark, and the Rensselaer Polytechnic\nInstitute. Working in tandem, the team says the two groups were able to join\ntheir knowledge to figure out exactly how the electrons in the metals were\ninteracting with their oppositely charged counterparts, called \u201choles.\u201d\n\nThis work revealed \u201ckey spatial information\u201d within this nearly invisible\nenergy exchange occurring at the quantum level, which was making these gold\nsheets glow. The team said that this work, which is published in the journal\nLight Science & Applications, has resulted in the \u201cfirst complete, fully\nquantitative model of this phenomenon in gold, which can be applied to any\nmetal.\u201d\n\n## Glowing Gold Could Help Revolutionize Energy Generation\n\nBeyond some potentially novel applications, the team says that their work\nmeans scientists could theoretically use a material like gold in advanced\nsensing methods that support energy generation. That\u2019s because some of the\nmost precise sensors can affect their own readings, whereas a gold-based\nsensor\u2019s \u201cStokes\u201d signal, a.k.a. glow, can reveal the precise temperature of\nthe probe\u2019s surface.\n\nSee Also\n\n### Photonic Time Crystal Discovery Could Have \u201cProfound Implications\u201d for\nOptics, Lead to New Disruptive Tech\n\n\u201cFor many chemical reactions on the surface of metals, there is a big debate\nabout why and under what conditions these reactions occur,\u201d said Tagliabue.\n\u201cTemperature is a key parameter, but measuring temperature at the nanoscale is\nextremely difficult because a thermometer can influence your measurement. So,\nit\u2019s a huge advantage to be able to probe a material using the material itself\nas the probe.\u201d\n\nThis unique ability the scientists explain, can offer \u201cunprecedentedly\u201d\ndetailed insights into chemical reactions, \u201cespecially those involved in\nenergy research.\u201d In fact, the team believes that their explanation of what\nmakes gold glow, and similar work they are exploring with copper, could help\nreduce carbon emissions in the generation of solar fuels, which store energy\nin chemical bonds.\n\n\u201cTo combat climate change, we are going to need technologies to convert CO2\ninto other useful chemicals one way or another,\u201d says LNET postdoc Alan\nBowman, the study\u2019s first author. \u201cUsing metals is one way to do that, but if\nwe don\u2019t have a good understanding of how these reactions happen on their\nsurfaces, then we can\u2019t optimize them. Luminescence offers a new way to\nunderstand what is happening in these metals.\u201d\n\nChristopher Plain is a Science Fiction and Fantasy novelist and Head Science\nWriter at The Debrief.
