Do we know this?\n\nI can't stop thinking about this lately. After several research projects and\nacross 25+ in-depth sessions with teams tasked with engineering\ntransformation, as a psychologist for software teams, I think we're\nfundamentally failing to prepare engineering managers to handle the\nsociocognitive work of triage.\n\nHere\u2019s a signal that this failure is happening:\n\n\"We spent an endless amount of time planning and we still ended up in a\ncrisis. The crisis was, honestly, devastating. We\u2019ll probably be picking up\nthe pieces for a year if I\u2019m honest.\u201d\n\n\"Wow...what is the business doing to invest in the engineering teams healing\nfrom this?\" This is usually met with laughter, so I have to pivot to a\nquestion engineering managers will answer: \u201cSo...what have you changed?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we never could\u2019ve planned for this...\"\n\nYou may think about emergency rooms when you hear the word triage, and you\nshould. But it has a broader application as a form of cognitive problem-\nsolving. Triage is a skillset that's specifically about dealing with the\nunexpected and prioritizing among many urgent tasks--usually at cost to\nsomething else that we value. Not all engineering crises are disaster work\n(although some are \u2013 and this should be more recognized! Software is part of\nwhat keeps the lights on and the hospitals running), but handling a crisis\nstill produces a pervasive, measurable, very tangible impact on knowledge\nworkers.\n\nBut instead of talking about triage as its own experience, I see teams and\ntheir managers talk a lot about \"planning\" and \"complexity\" and other vague\n(so high level as to be unhelpful imo) areas. We try to apply a lot of pre-\nplanning to triage situations, and get frustrated when it fails.\n\nI think for one thing, we could better support engineering managers by\npreparing them distinguish between triage and non-triage planning. One key\npsychological skill for handling triage is cognitive flexibility\u2013for example,\na timely and adaptive recognition that \u201cthe old rules\u201d aren\u2019t holding any\nmore. Eng managers tell me a lot of stories about sticking to old plans for\ntoo long, and failing to hear the early signals of breakdown.\n\nOne fascinating thing that happens to us in situations of triage is that we\ncan expect our quick decision-making to be massively prioritized, which we\noften do by relying on highly patterned behaviors. Sometimes these are highly\nbiased. This is because under stress, our diminished resources make us\ndifferent. It is a simple point but often hard to remember. So it's important\nto recognize that responding to a crisis often means we also fall back into\nold patterns, \"shadow\" rules, and heuristics.\n\nAnother signal, conversations like this:\n\n\"We're evidence based, absolutely.\" \"Really?\" \"Well....you know when things\nare really, really going wrong, you have to move fast. Rely on your gut\ninstinct.\" \"And did that make you feel like you've got the information you\nneed to make a decision?\" \"Absolutely not. My team is angry I made the best\ncall I could, and it feels like they'll never forgive me.\"\n\nBased on my research, engineering managers are really stressed in general. I\nthink this burden is massively underreported and undermeasured. I'm not\nplaying the tiny violin for some of the most powerful employees in any modern\ntechnology organization, but let's be real. It's a sign support is needed.\nWhen we talk about any single role \u201cfailing\u201d inside of an organization, it is\noften the case that we are sampling a systemic failure via information that is\nbeing surfaced by individuals.\n\nIn other words, engineering managers can be seen as an early warning system\nabout the whole environment. But I hear massive differences in perception from\nthe manager POV and other POVs \u2013 leaders complain to me about the eng\nmanagers, and thought leaders in the software research space seem to be able\nto make entire careers just on the theme \u201cmanagers can never be trusted.\u201d I\nfind this alarming. It feels like a variant of contest culture, and we already\nknow that exerts a large toll on people\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nOne area where I think we could improve in our manager support is by allowing\nmanagers to access over-time information about engineering work, for just in\ntime diagnosis. Sometimes, this information might need to be comparative and\nshared between managers. Managers tell me constantly that they feel incredible\nisolated from both their peers and from comparative information in moments of\ncrisis, especially new managers who may be worried about proving themselves.\nWhile I am incredibly aware of the potential harms of tracking our work (after\nall, I used to work in education), we need to think about where \"trace data\"\ninformation tracking can come into play to reduce cognitive load for managers\ntrying to make swift decisions, handling a barrage of conflicting reports, and\nwho don't have access to career's worth of information about different\nsoftware team situations yet. All people learn by exposure to diverse\nexamples. This is a principle of human learning, but it's unclear to me how we\nprovide that to engineering managers in any structured way.\n\nA signal that some thinking is needed here: \u201cI went around the team and\ngathered everyone\u2019s best memory about what was going on....well lots of people\ndidn\u2019t really agree with each other, and so I had to stand up in a meeting in\nfront of everyone and try to synthesize a POV. I did my best to please\neveryone and it feels like it ended up pleasing no one. They hate me for it\nnow, but I guess it turns out it's just the job of a manager to be hated\nsometimes.\"\n\nWe will absolutely not sustain healthy leadership structures with this kind of\nlearned helplessness. Let's consider a different sociocognitive story: \u201cWe\ncame together to honestly share about the steps towards this incident, and\nthen we all checked ourselves against a few pieces of data. Together, we\nfigured out the story. I made a tough choice and we saw our limitations, but\nat least we were in it together. I learned even if I don't have all the\nanswers, it's the job of a manager to make space for us to come together like\nthis.\u201d\n\nFinally, one of the biggest risk signals I think about across all my data and\nthe stories I hear is the overall, cumulative weight of it. In some industries\nand orgs, engineering managers are called upon by their organizations to take\nresponsibility for triage not just once in a while, but often. Do engineering\norganizations have a sense of the cadence of this triage? When engineering\nmanagers become more effective and adept at using triage skills to prevent\nfailures, does that feel recognized and known? Do we know whose career this is\nhappening to, and do we think about this invisible load as a significant\nthreat to the software stability of the world?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. One signal that makes me think we aren\u2019t fully getting this:\nthe sociocognitive, psychological cost of triage is thrown into the same\ngeneral bucket as the paper cuts of \u201cdeveloper experience\u201d, like adrenaline\ndumps for six months and chronic stress are the same thing as investing in a\nnew license for a slightly shinier tool. Yes, those paper cuts add up, but\n\u201cdeveloper experience\u201d is not currently providing a human-centered perspective\non the real crisis work that many software teams have to face. We need\npsychology for that.\n\n## \ud83d\udcc8drcathicks.com\n\nbottom of page\n\n", "frontpage": false}
