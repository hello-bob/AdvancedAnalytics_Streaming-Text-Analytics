David\nRyder\u2014Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBy Koh Ewe\n\nMay 2, 2024 6:30 AM EDT\n\nJoshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems\nwho had flagged safety concerns and alleged misconduct by the aircraft\nmanufacturer, died Tuesday after a sudden and severe infection.\n\nDean is the second Boeing-linked whistleblower to have died in the last two\nmonths as the company has come under heightened scrutiny.\n\nDean, who was 45 and lived in Wichita, Kan., was in good health before he\nbegan to experience trouble breathing about two weeks ago and went to a\nhospital, according to the Seattle Times, which first reported on his death.\nDean\u2019s deterioration from that point, his aunt told the newspaper, was\n\u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\nAccording to a series of public social media posts by Dean\u2019s family, by April\n21, he was in \u201cvery critical condition.\u201d Dean tested positive for influenza B\nand MRSA, a difficult-to-treat bacterial infection, and developed pneumonia.\nHe was intubated and put on dialysis as well as airlifted to another hospital\nto be put on an ECMO machine, a form of cardiac and respiratory life support.\nA CT scan showed that he had also suffered a stroke. Doctors were considering\namputating his hands and feet, which had turned black from lack of oxygen.\n\n\u201cHe is in the worst condition I have ever known or heard of. Even the hospital\nagrees,\u201d Dean\u2019s sister-in-law Kristen Dean posted on Facebook on Saturday,\nApril 27. On Sunday night, Dean\u2019s family posted that he was \u201cgiving up his\nfight\u201d and \u201crefusing to let them do any life saving procedures,\u201d though his\nmother said she \u201ctold the doctor he doesn't know what he wants, I\u2019m sure he\nwants to live, he\u2019s afraid, scared and depressed.\u201d According to Dean\u2019s mother,\nthe doctor agreed and performed a bronchoscopy, a surgical procedure to\ninvestigate the lungs and airways. Dean\u2019s family announced that he had passed\non Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cHis absence will be deeply felt,\u201d his aunt posted on Facebook.\n\n\u201cJosh\u2019s passing is a loss to the aviation community and the flying public,\u201d\nBrian Knowles, a lawyer who represented Dean as well as the other\nwhistleblower, John Barnett, who died in March, tells TIME. \u201cHe possessed\ntremendous courage to stand up for what he felt was true and right and raised\nquality and safety issues.\u201d\n\nSpirit AeroSystems, a company that was spun out of Boeing in 2005 and\ncurrently faces financial woes and an uncertain future, did not respond\nimmediately to TIME\u2019s request for comment but said in a statement cited by\nother media outlets: \u201cOur thoughts are with Josh Dean\u2019s family. This sudden\nloss is stunning news here and for his loved ones.\u201d\n\nDean, who worked at Spirit since 2019 though was briefly laid off during the\npandemic before returning in 2021, first raised concerns about improperly\ndrilled bulkhead holes on some 737 Max planes at Spirit\u2019s plant in Wichita in\nOctober 2022, according to a shareholder lawsuit that accused Spirit of\nconcealing its production issues.\n\nWhile Dean had reported the problem to several managers, the complaint\nalleged, the company hid it from investors for months until it became public\nknowledge in August 2023, when Boeing and Spirit announced a delay in plane\ndeliveries due to the defect. According to testimonies from employees at\nSpirit, including Dean, workers had been instructed or pressured by\nsupervisors to downplay the defects they found.\n\n\u201cIt is known at Spirit that if you make too much noise and cause too much\ntrouble, you will be moved,\u201d Dean told the Wall Street Journal in January. \u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t mean you completely disregard stuff, but they don\u2019t want you to find\neverything and write it up.\u201d\n\nDean was fired by Spirit in April 2023, ostensibly over a separate issue he\nfailed to identify as an internal inspector. Months later, he filed a\ncomplaint to the Federal Aviation Administration, alleging that he was made a\nscapegoat while Spirit did nothing to inform regulators and the public of the\nconcerns he had flagged.\n\nAfter a high-profile incident in January in which a plug door on a Boeing 737\nMAX 9 blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight, Dean\u2019s former colleague Lance\nThompson publicly backed Dean\u2019s claims to the Seattle Times, saying that\nproduction deadlines were prioritized over safety at Spirit\u2019s Wichita plant\nand that managers encouraged workers to hide defects. An audit by the FAA into\nBoeing and Spirit found in March that both companies failed to comply with\nquality-control requirements.\n\nDean had filed a complaint with the Department of Labor in November alleging\nwrongful employment termination by Spirit, a case that remained pending at the\ntime of his death. \u201cI think they were sending out a message to anybody else,\u201d\nDean told NPR in February: \u201cIf you are too loud, we will silence you.\u201d\n\nDean\u2019s death comes less than two months after the death of Barnett, another\nwhistleblower who had spent years warning about lax safety standards at\nBoeing. Barnett was found in his truck with what authorities described as an\napparent \u201cself-inflicted gunshot wound,\u201d in Charleston, S.C., on March 9, amid\ndepositions he was giving related to a similar alleged retaliation dispute\nwith Boeing. An investigation remains ongoing.\n\nWhen asked about his two clients\u2019 recent deaths, which have sparked conspiracy\ntheories on social media, Knowles told TIME: \u201cI do not want to speculate, and\nI would like to see the evidence from the investigating authorities.\u201d But, he\nadds, \u201cwhat society does not need is people in fear to speak up.\u201d\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * The 100 Most Influential People of 2024\n  * How Far Trump Would Go\n  * Scenes From Pro-Palestinian Encampments Across U.S. Universities\n  * Saving Seconds Is Better Than Hours\n  * Why Your Breakfast Should Start with a Vegetable\n  * 6 Compliments That Land Every Time\n  * Welcome to the Golden Age of Ryan Gosling\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
