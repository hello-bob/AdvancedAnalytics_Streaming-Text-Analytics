Josh Newman, a California Democrat and the sponsor of the legislation,\nsaid Clear effectively lets wealthier people skip in front of passengers who\nhave been waiting to be screened by Transportation Security Administration\nagents.\n\n\"It's a basic equity issue when you see people subscribed to a concierge\nservice being escorted in front of people who have waited a long time to get\nto the front of TSA line,\" Newman told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is beaten\ndown by the travel experience, and if Clear escorts a customer in front of you\nand tells TSA, 'Sorry, I have someone better,' it's really frustrating.\"\n\nIf passed, the bill would bar Clear, a private security clearance company\nfounded in 2010, from airports in California. Clear charges members $189 per\nyear to verify passengers' identities at airports and escort them through\nsecurity, allowing them to bypass TSA checkpoints. The service is in use at\nroughly 50 airports across the U.S., as well as at dozens of sports stadiums\nand other venues.\n\nCalifornia State Senator Josh Newman, seen here speaking at a ceremony in\nOrange County on Oct. 27, 2022, in Fullerton, California, said his bill to ban\nthe travel screening service at airports in the state is \"about dignity in the\ntravel experience of people who don't have money to pay for upsell services.\"\nIrfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nA media representative for Clear declined to comment on the proposal to ban\nthe company's service in California.\n\n\"We are proud to partner with nine airports across California \u2014 creating\nhundreds of jobs, sharing more than $13 million in annual revenue with our\nCalifornia airport partners and serving nearly 1 million Californians,\" the\ncompany said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are always working with our\nairline and airport partners as well as local, state, and federal governments\nto ensure all travelers have a safer, easier checkpoint experience.\"\n\nNewman said his bill, SB-1372, doesn't seek to prohibit Clear from operating\nits own dedicated security lines separate from other passengers.\n\n\"The bill doesn't seek to punish Clear or put it out of business. It wants to\ncreate a better traffic flow so customers aren't intersecting with the general\npublic and causing a moment of friction that is so frustrating to the average\ntraveller,\" he said. \"All it does is up the tension in the line.\"\n\n## \"It's about dignity\"\n\nThe legislation has bipartisan support from Republican Sen. Janet Nguyen. The\nAssociation of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA-CWA) also supports the bill, as does\nthe union representing Transportation Security Officers in Oakland,\nSacramento, and San Jose.\n\nIn a letter to Senate Transportation Committee Chair Dave Cortese, AFA-CWA\nPresident Sara Nelson said the bill \"would restore equal access and treatment\nat the airport security checkpoint by requiring companies like Clear to\noperate in a dedicated security lane, separate from general travelers and TSA\nPreCheck members.\"\n\nJames Murdock, president of AFGE Local 1230, the TSA officer union's local\nchapter, also weighed in. \"Clear is nothing more than the luxury resale of\nupcharge of space in the airport security queue, where those who pay can skip\nthe line at the direct expense of every other traveler,\" he said in a letter\nto Cortese. \"While Clear may save time for its paying customers, non-customers\nsuffer from Clear's aggressive sales tactics and longer security queues while\nthey enter an essential security screening process.\"\n\nThe bill, which is set to come before the California State Senate's\ntransportation committee on Tuesday, does have significant adversaries in the\nform of major airlines, including Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue,\nUnited and others. Carriers claim the measure threatens to restrict how\nairports manage security lines, which they say would worsen the experience for\npassengers and hurt business.\n\nDelta, United and Alaska each have partnerships with Clear.\n\nWhat is Clear when going through airport security? 04:24\n\nBut Newman is undaunted, describing his bill as an effort to improve travel\nfor the majority of passengers.\n\n\"It's about dignity in the travel experience of people who don't have money to\npay for upsell services,\" Newman said. \"If you have money, by all means, but\nthat business shouldn't be at the expense of the average traveller.\"\n\nJames Smith of booking site Travel Lingual said the bill at the very least\n\"prompts a necessary dialogue\" on how to best balance convenience and equity\nwhen it comes to navigating airport security.\n\n\"While Clear offers a time-saving solution for travelers willing to pay,\nconcerns about fairness and the exacerbation of socioeconomic disparities\ncannot be ignored,\" he said.\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nFTC bans noncompetes, making it easier for millions of workers to quit\n\nTikTok ban clears key hurdle in the Senate.
