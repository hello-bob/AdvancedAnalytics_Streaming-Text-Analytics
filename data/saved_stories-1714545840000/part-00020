The incident took\nplace on April 19 and involved data pertaining to residents of government\nassisted housing at four buildings under the jurisdiction of the Prefectural\nPublic Housing Division.\n\nHowever, the data was neither leaked by an unscrupulous worker nor stolen by\nhackers. Instead it was taken by the wind.\n\nAs part of the regular administration of the government housing program, data\nneeded to be transferred from a public corporation office to the Aichi\nprefectural government capital building in Nagoya. Unfortunately, this data\nwas stored on physical media, which, as we\u2019ve seen before, can cause problems\nfor Japanese government agencies. There was the time, for example, when the\nTokyo police department lost citizens\u2019 data that they\u2019d stored on floppy\ndiscs, or that other time when a city employee in Hyogo Prefecture got drunk,\npassed out, and lost a USB memory stick with residents\u2019 personal information\non it.\n\nThe Aichi government\u2019s blunder was even more old-school, however, as it was\ncarrying out its data transfer by physically transporting 1,696 pieces of\npaper, placed inside a cardboard box. What\u2019s more, they upped the degree of\ndifficulty by opting to transport the box in a handcart and having someone\nwalk it over, out on the streets, to its destination, instead of driving it\nover. Oh, and they decided to do this on a day with strong winds.\n\nThe silent-era comedy movie setup was, it seems, too much for fate to resist.\nBefore the public corporation employee who was pushing the cart reached the\ncapital building, the cart tipped over and the box opened up as it tumbled\nout. Though the worker attempted to grab the documents, two hands aren\u2019t\nnearly enough to snatch 1,696 papers, and many blew away. The search for\nscattered documents continued until sunset, at which point the Aichi\ngovernment began contacting affected residents to inform them of the data\nleak/blow-away. The search continued for two more days, but without all of the\ndocuments being recovered.\n\nAccording to the statement from the Aichi government, the documents included\nthe government housing residents\u2019 names (the leaseholder, in the case of\nfamilies) and \u201crent\u201d for the month of April, ostensibly referring to written\nrecords of the amount residents paid, since no mention has been made of cash\nbeing lost in the incident.\n\nNo improper use of the lost data has been discovered at this time, and in\naddition to issuing an apology the Aichi prefectural government says it plans\nto switch to digital records for this part of housing administration process,\nwhich will allow them to transfer data without any weather or cart balance\nconcerns.\n\nSource: Yomiuri Shimbun via Livedoor News via Jin, Chunichi Shimbun, Aichi\nPrefectural Government\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n\\-- Personal information of everyone in Amagasaki City lost by person who\npassed out drunk on street\n\n\\-- Buying Japanese concert tickets may get even harder for foreign tourists\nwith new government plan\n\n\\-- Japanese government, please stop using floppy discs, politician asks\n\n  * External Link\n  * https://soranews24.com/2024/04/26/japanese-city-loses-residents-personal-data-which-was-on-paper-being-transported-on-a-windy-day/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24\n\n\u00a92024 GPlusMedia Inc.\n\n### Teach English in Japan\n\nJoin the leaders of English Education for Children in Japan!\n\nApply Now\n\n  * Sort by\n  * Oldest\n  * Latest\n  * Popular\n\n#### 22 Comments Login to comment\n\n####\n\nPepperLunch\n\nApr. 27 07:04 am JST\n\nCan't decide if it's good due diligence or insanity they spent 2 days\nsearching for the papers.

It is much easier to take much more data from local authorities, more\nquickly, remotely, and then lock up systems with ransomware than access\nphysical materials locked in a store cupboard. Physical is usually much more\nsecure, unless you are complete numpties and schlep it about in a handcart on\na windy day.\n\n0( +6 / -6 )\n\n####\n\nMETATTOKYO\n\nApr. 27 08:57 am JST\n\nlol.
