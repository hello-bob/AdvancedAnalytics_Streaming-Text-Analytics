Biden issued a\nstatement minutes after the Senate vote saying he plans to sign the bill into\nlaw on Wednesday.\n\nOnce signed, the provision will give TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance,\nroughly nine months to sell the wildly popular app or face a national ban, a\ndeadline the president could extend by 90 days.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe measure \u2014 which has broad bipartisan support \u2014 poses the most significant\nthreat yet to the app\u2019s operations in the United States, where it has more\nthan 170 million users and has become an economic and cultural powerhouse.\nLawmakers pushing for the restriction have cited concerns that the company\u2019s\nownership structure could allow the Chinese government to gain access to\nAmericans\u2019 data, claims that TikTok disputes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTikTok is expected to challenge the measure, setting up a high-stakes and\npotentially lengthy legal battle that will test the company\u2019s argument that\nany such law would violate the free speech rights of millions. But its\nfrenzied efforts to derail the proposal \u2014 including nudging users to register\ncomplaints with their congressional representatives and running ads touting\nTikTok\u2019s data security efforts just days out from a final vote \u2014 have failed\nto dissuade lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of\nimportant foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban\nbill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans,\u201d\nTikTok said in a statement last week.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFor half a decade, U.S. lawmakers have scrutinized the relationship between\nTikTok and Beijing-based ByteDance over concerns it could leave American user\ndata vulnerable to surveillance by the Chinese government. In response, TikTok\nhas proposed a plan dubbed Project Texas to safeguard U.S. data that would\ninclude storing that information with American tech giant Oracle. As\nnegotiations between TikTok and the federal government languished, however,\nlawmakers reinvigorated legislation granting the executive branch power to\nrestrict the platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long and winding road,\u201d Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), one of the\nlegislation\u2019s biggest proponents in the chamber, told The Washington Post on\nTuesday.\n\nFollow Technology\n\nThose efforts escalated last month after a bipartisan group of House lawmakers\nunveiled and quickly passed a stand-alone version of the TikTok divest-or-ban\nlegislation, which gave ByteDance a shorter window to sell the platform.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAlthough the push appeared to spring up in a matter of days, members of\nCongress and Biden administration officials had been working for months to\ndevelop the latest bill and expand its support base, according to interviews\nwith key lawmakers and half a dozen senior Capitol Hill aides, the latter of\nwhom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.\n\nIn March 2023, lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee hauled in\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew to testify about the company\u2019s ties to China, a heated\nsession in which lawmakers across the political spectrum dismissed the\ncompany\u2019s assurances it would wall off Americans\u2019 user data from China and\ntake steps to prevent any foreign influence on the platform. Chew\u2019s\ncontentious appearance put a fresh spotlight on several proposals aimed at\nsplintering TikTok from ByteDance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut after even some of the most broadly supported bills faced blowback from\nsome Democrats and Republicans, lawmakers on the House\u2019s select committee on\nChina went \u201cback to the drawing board\u201d last year to hash out a potential\ncompromise, said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), one of the lead sponsors\nof the TikTok legislation that is poised to be signed into law.\n\nKrishnamoorthi, the China select committee\u2019s top Democrat, and Chairman Mike\nGallagher (R-Wis.) spent months developing a framework with leaders of the\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee, narrowing the scope of the bill to\naddress concerns that prior iterations gave the government too much discretion\nover which apps to restrict or ban, according to two senior House Republican\naides. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) played a key role in\nconvening members from various committees that had taken aim at TikTok to\nbuild support for it behind the scenes, one of the aides said. Gallagher and\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), who chairs the House Energy and\nCommerce Committee, were not available for interviews Tuesday.\n\nMonths before the bill was introduced, the lawmakers brought administration\nofficials into the negotiations, several of the aides said, with the Justice\nDepartment offering critical input on how lawmakers could head off legal\nchallenges from TikTok with tweaks to the bill, one of the senior Republican\nHouse aides said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWe said we need to bring the White House and the Justice Department into the\nplanning early so that we can understand the technical challenges associated\nwith drawing up legislation,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said.\n\nHouse lawmakers garnered support for the bill, in part, by pairing it with\nlegislation to prohibit foreign adversaries from buying Americans\u2019 personal\ninformation from data brokers, an issue that has publicly flown under the\nradar but long prompted privacy concerns among key legislators, according to\ntwo senior House Democratic aides. That proposal, led by Rep. Frank Pallone\nJr. (D-N.J.), was tucked into the foreign aid package alongside the TikTok\nbill. If signed, the data broker bill would be one of the most notable pieces\nof privacy legislation passed in years by Congress, where lawmakers have\nfailed to set nationwide rules.\n\nBecause of that legwork, House lawmakers were able to swiftly advance the\nlegislation through committee and pass it on the floor less than a week after\nintroducing it last month, several aides said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThe fire looked like it had been put out, but the embers were still just\nexceptionally hot,\u201d said Brendan Carr, a Republican at the Federal\nCommunications Commission who has been a vocal TikTok critic and has closely\nallied with lawmakers targeting the company.\n\nAfter the House cleared the stand-alone bill, many senators initially\nexpressed reservation about following suit in rapid succession. That included\nSenate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who floated\nholding hearings on the topic before taking action.\n\nBut after congressional leaders updated the bill to give ByteDance more time\nto divest from TikTok, support grew in the Senate. Cantwell, one of several\nDemocrats who publicly raised the issue, said during a floor speech Tuesday\nthat the new time frame would give ByteDance \u201cample time to allow potential\ninvestors to come forward\u201d with a bid to buy the app. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.),\nCantwell\u2019s Republican counterpart on the Commerce Committee, on Tuesday called\nthe TikTok provision \u201cincredibly important for our national security.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nEven so, a collection of liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans in both\nchambers have continued to oppose the legislation over concerns that it gives\nthe federal government too much power to restrict businesses or that it\ncurtails speech online, including Sens. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Rand\nPaul (R-Ky.).\n\nMarkey spoke \u201cin defense of TikTok\u2019s users\u201d on the Senate floor Tuesday,\nwarning that the bill would \u201clikely result in the blocking of the most popular\napplication among young people in this country.\u201d Markey argued that the\nchances of the company divesting from ByteDance in a year were \u201cvery small.\u201d\n\nPaul, who has blocked some past efforts to target the app, wrote in an op-ed\nlast week that the bill \u201cwould violate the First Amendment rights\u201d of TikTok\nusers and \u201cgive the government the power to force the sale of other\ncompanies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nUltimately, lawmakers were able to sidestep a potentially lengthy and\ncontentious debate in the Senate by tying the legislation to passing foreign\naid, a cause that already had significant bipartisan backing.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me six months ago, three months ago whether I could have\npredicted this would\u2019ve been the path, I could have never,\u201d Warner said.\n\u201cSometimes the sausage-making actually works.\u201d\n\n### Possible TikTok ban\n\nHouse lawmakers escalated efforts to restrict the video-sharing platform\nTikTok, renewing pressure on the Senate by advancing the bill as part of a\nbroader package sending aid to Israel and Ukraine.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the bill: The bill, which saw bipartisan support, would require the\nsocial media app\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell off the\nimmensely popular app or face a nationwide ban. While the original House bill\ngave TikTok 180 days to be sold, the latest version gives the company 270 days\nand allows the president to extend the deadline by an additional 90 if\n\u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made. Here\u2019s what to know about the bill.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: The bill heads to the Senate and would then need to be signed by\nPresident Biden to become law. Even if that happens, there will probably be a\nlong road in the courts to settle the issue. Meanwhile, TikTok would need to\nfind a buyer, and a few potential investors previously stepped forward.\n\nHow people are reacting: TikTok creators say a ban would threaten their lives\nand livelihoods, while young users of the app previously asked Congress why\nthey aren\u2019t focusing on \u201cbigger problems.\u201d\n\nShow more\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTechnology\n\nBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devices\n\nGoogle fires more workers after CEO says workplace isn\u2019t for politics\n\nDating apps are collecting more of your information than you think\n\nTesla profit slumps on price cuts but unveils plans for affordable models\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": false}
