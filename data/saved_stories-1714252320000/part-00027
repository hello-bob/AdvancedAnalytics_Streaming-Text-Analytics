Journalists wishing to participate in either or\nboth the pre-launch and launch media programmes detailed below, are asked to\nsubmit their application via ESA\u2019s media accreditation page by Friday 1 March\n2024.\n\n19/02/2024 1205 views\n\nVideo 00:02:16\n\nEnabling & Support\n\n### ESA\u2019s NavLab drone\n\n22/01/2024 1209 views 10 likes\n\nScience & Exploration\n\n# Einstein Probe opens its wide eyes to the X-ray sky\n\n27/04/2024 458 views 5 likes\n\nESA / Science & Exploration / Space Science\n\nThe first images captured by the innovative mission were presented at the 7th\nworkshop of the Einstein Probe consortium in Beijing. They illustrate the\nsatellite\u2019s full potential and show that its novel optics, which mimic a\nlobster\u2019s eyes, are ready to monitor the X-ray sky. The space X-ray telescope\nzoomed in on a few well-known celestial objects to give us a hint of what the\nmission is capable of.\n\nIllustration of the Einstein Probe spacecraft.\n\nLaunched on 9 January 2024, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) spacecraft\nEinstein Probe joins ESA\u2019s XMM-Newton and JAXA\u2019s XRISM in their quest to\ndiscover the Universe in X-ray light. The mission is a collaboration led by\nCAS with ESA, the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE)\n(Germany), and the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) (France).\n\nIn the months since liftoff, the mission operations team has been performing\nthe necessary tests to confirm the spacecraft's functionality and calibrating\nthe scientific instruments. During this crucial phase, Einstein Probe captured\nscientific data from various X-ray sources.\n\nThese first-light images demonstrate the outstanding capabilities of Einstein\nProbe's two scientific instruments. The Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) can\nobserve a panorama of nearly one-eleventh of the celestial sphere in one shot,\nwhile the more sensitive Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) offers close-ups and\ncan pinpoint short-lived events caught by WXT.\n\n\u201cI am delighted to see the first observations from Einstein Probe, which\nshowcase the mission\u2019s ability to study wide expanses of the X-ray sky and\nquickly discover new celestial sources,\u201d says Prof. Carole Mundell, ESA\nDirector of Science. \u201cThese early data give us a tantalising glimpse of the\nhigh-energy dynamic Universe that will soon be within reach of our science\ncommunities. Congratulations to the science and engineering teams at CAS, MPE,\nCNES and ESA for their hard work in reaching this important milestone.\u201d\n\nThe capability of the mission to promptly spot new X-ray sources and monitor\nhow they change over time is fundamental to improving our grasp of the most\nenergetic processes in the cosmos. Powerful X-rays are blasted through the\nUniverse when neutron stars collide, supernovas explode, and matter is\nswallowed by black holes or ejected from the crushing magnetic fields that\nenvelop them.\n\n## Lobster eyes monitoring the Universe\n\nEinstein Probe\u2019s wide eyes capture the Milky Way in X-ray light\n\nEinstein Probe\u2019s WXT instrument consists of twelve modules featuring the novel\nlobster-eye technology that was tested in flight in 2022 by the technology\ndemonstrator LEIA (Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy). The twelve modules\nprovide a field of view of more than 3600 square degrees, allowing Einstein\nProbe to monitor the whole night sky in just three orbits.\n\nLobster-eye optics of Einstein Probe\n\nDuring its first months in space, WXT started its work of keeping a watchful\neye on the X-ray sky. Detections of energetic objects look like a lit-up plus\nsign due to the way the instrument\u2019s novel lobster-eye optics work. The first\nX-ray transient source \u2013 an astronomical object that is not continuously\nshining but pops up and fades again \u2013 was discovered on 19 February. This\ncandidate gamma-ray burst lasted for 100 seconds. Einstein Probe discovered\nanother 14 temporary X-ray sources and also captured X-rays 127 flaring stars.\n\nDuring the mission, the wide-field instrument's findings will guide a range of\nground- and space-based telescopes to perform follow-up observations in\nmultiple wavelength bands. X-ray follow-up observations can also be obtained\nusing the satellite\u2019s FXT instrument.\n\n## Rapid follow-up observations\n\nGlobular cluster Omega Centauri imaged by Einstein Probe\n\nEinstein Probe\u2019s FXT instrument has a set of two X-ray telescopes for detailed\nstudies of X-ray-emitting objects and events. During the past months, FXT has\nproved to be a trustworthy instrument to observe a range of X-ray sources. The\nfirst images bring into new focus a supernova remnant, an elliptical galaxy, a\nglobular cluster and a nebula.\n\nRemarkably, FXT already performed a follow-up observation of an X-ray event\nspotted by WXT on 20 March 2024.\n\n\u201cIt is astounding that even though the instruments were not yet fully\ncalibrated, we could already perform a time-critical follow-up observation\nusing the FXT instrument of a fast X-ray transient first spotted by WXT,\u201d\nexplains Dr. Erik Kuulkers, ESA\u2019s Einstein Probe Project Scientist. \u201cIt shows\nwhat Einstein Probe will be capable of during its survey.\u201d\n\n## What\u2019s next?\n\nSupernova remnant Puppis A imaged by Einstein Probe\n\nIn the coming months, Einstein Probe will continue to undergo in-orbit\ncalibration activities before starting its routine science observations around\nmid-June. During the three-year mission, the satellite will circle Earth at a\nheight of 600 km and keep its eyes on the sky searching for transitory X-ray\nevents. Using the FXT follow-up telescope, the mission will look deeper at\nnewly detected events and other known interesting objects.\n\nEinstein Probe\u2019s capabilities are highly complementary to the in-depth studies\nof individual cosmic sources enabled by XMM-Newton and XRISM. Its survey is\nfundamental to prepare for X-ray observations by ESA\u2019s future NewAthena\nmission, currently under study and set to be the largest X-ray observatory\never built.\n\nEinstein Probe is an international collaborative mission led by the Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences (CAS) with the European Space Agency (ESA), the The Max-\nPlanck-Institut f\u00fcr extraterrestrische Physik (MPE), Germany, and Centre\nNational D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), France. ESA and MPE contributed key\ncomponents of FXT. ESA is participating in the Einstein Probe project as a\nmission of opportunity and has provided support for testing and calibrating\nthe X-ray detectors and the optics of WXT. ESA's ground stations will be used\nto help download the data, while CNES provides a VHF (very high frequency)\nground receiving network for the real-time and fast downlink of scientific\ndata. In return for its contributions, ESA will get access to 10% of the\nscientific data from Einstein Probe.\n\nContact: ESA Media relations media@esa.int\n\nThank you for liking\n\nYou have already liked this page, you can only like it once!\n\nEuropean Space Agency\n\nFAQ Contacts Terms and conditions Privacy notice Careers at ESA Subscribe\n\n", "frontpage": false}
