Civilization A is stronger\nthan Civilization B and is perceived by Civilization B as a grave threat; its\nposition, however, is more fragile than it seems. Neither side hesitates to\nemploy espionage, subterfuge, and surveillance, because the rules of\nconduct\u2014to the extent that they exist\u2014are ill-defined and frequently\ncontested. But the battle lines are clear: whoever controls the technological\nfrontier controls the future.\n\nIn Liu Cixin\u2019s science-fiction trilogy, \u201cRemembrance of Earth\u2019s Past\u201d\u2014also\nknown by the title of its first volume, \u201cThe Three-Body Problem\u201d\u2014Civilization\nA is a distant planet named Trisolaris and Civilization B is Earth. Life on\nTrisolaris has become increasingly difficult to sustain, so its inhabitants\nprepare to colonize Earth, a project made possible by their vast technological\nsuperiority. Using higher-dimensional geometry, they deploy supercomputers the\nsize of a proton to spy on every terrestrial activity and utterance; Earth\u2019s\nentire fleet of starships proves no match for one small, droplet-shaped\nTrisolaran probe. Yet Trisolaris\u2019s dominance is far from assured, given the\ningenuity of the underdogs. Seeking out the vulnerabilities of its adversary,\nEarth establishes a deterrence based on mutually assured destruction and\nforces the Trisolarans to share their technology.\n\nWhen the first volume of the series was published in the United States, in\n2014, the models for Trisolaris and Earth were immediately apparent. For the\nChinese, achieving parity with the West is a long-cherished goal, envisaged as\na restoration of greatness after the humiliation of Western occupations and\nthe self-inflicted wounds of the Mao era. As Liu told the Times, \u201cChina is on\nthe path of rapid modernization and progress, kind of like the U.S. during the\ngolden age of science fiction.\u201d The future, he went on, would be \u201cfull of\nthreats and challenges,\u201d and \u201cvery fertile soil\u201d for speculative fiction.\n\nIn the past few years, those threats and challenges have escalated, as China\u2019s\nglobal ambitions, especially in the field of technology, have begun to impinge\nupon America\u2019s pre\u00ebminence. Disputes about tariffs, intellectual property, and\ntech infrastructure have become urgent matters of national security. The U.S.\nhas blocked China\u2019s access to certain technologies and has cracked down on\ncyber espionage. In January, the Justice Department filed charges against the\nChinese telecommunications giant Huawei, for alleged offenses (denied by the\ncompany) including fraud, theft of intellectual property, and violations of\nsanctions against Iran; the company\u2019s C.F.O., who is the daughter of its\ndirector and founder, was arrested in Canada, and faces possible extradition\nto the U.S. In May, Donald Trump signed an executive order that warned of\nforeign tech companies committing \u201cmalicious cyber-enabled actions\u201d at the\nbehest of their governments. The next day, Huawei was added to a list of\norganizations prohibited from doing business with American companies without\nexplicit government approval, and, not long afterward, Google discontinued\nHuawei\u2019s access to the Android operating system. In response, the president of\nHuawei told the Chinese media, \u201cI\u2019ve sacrificed myself and my family for the\nsake of a goal that we will stand on top of the world. To achieve this goal, a\nconflict with the U.S. is inevitable.\u201d\n\nAs the standoff has intensified, Liu has become wary of touting the\ngeopolitical underpinnings of his work. In November, when I accompanied him on\na trip to Washington, D.C.\u2014he was picking up the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation\u2019s\nAward for Imagination in Service to Society\u2014he briskly dismissed the idea that\nfiction could serve as commentary on history or on current affairs. \u201cThe whole\npoint is to escape the real world!\u201d he said. Still, the kind of reader he\nattracts suggests otherwise: Chinese tech entrepreneurs discuss the Hobbesian\nvision of the trilogy as a metaphor for cutthroat competition in the corporate\nworld; other fans include Barack Obama, who met Liu in Beijing two years ago,\nand Mark Zuckerberg. Liu\u2019s international career has become a source of\nnational pride. In 2015, China\u2019s then Vice-President, Li Yuanchao, invited Liu\nto Zhongnanhai\u2014an off-limits complex of government accommodation sometimes\ncompared to the Kremlin\u2014to discuss the books and showed Liu his own copies,\nwhich were dense with highlights and annotations.\n\nLiu\u2019s tomes\u2014they tend to be tomes\u2014have been translated into more than twenty\nlanguages, and the trilogy has sold some eight million copies worldwide. He\nhas won China\u2019s highest honor for science-fiction writing, the Galaxy Award,\nnine times, and in 2015 he became the first Asian writer to win the Hugo\nAward, the most prestigious international science-fiction prize. In China, one\nof his stories has been a set text in the gao kao\u2014the notoriously competitive\ncollege-entrance exams that determine the fate of ten million pupils annually;\nanother has appeared in the national seventh-grade-curriculum textbook. When a\nreporter recently challenged Liu to answer the middle-school questions about\nthe \u201cmeaning\u201d and the \u201ccentral themes\u201d of his story, he didn\u2019t get a single\none right. \u201cI\u2019m a writer,\u201d he told me, with a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t begin with some\nconceit in mind. I\u2019m just trying to tell a good story.\u201d\n\nThe trilogy\u2019s success has been credited with establishing sci-fi, once\nmarginalized in China, as a mainstream taste. Liu believes that this trend\nsignals a deeper shift in the Chinese mind-set\u2014that technological advances\nhave spurred a new excitement about the possibilities of cosmic exploration.\nThe trilogy commands a huge following among aerospace engineers and\ncosmologists; one scientist wrote an explanatory guide, \u201cThe Physics of Three\nBody.\u201d Some years ago, China\u2019s aerospace agency asked Liu, whose first career\nwas as a computer engineer in the hydropower industry, to address technicians\nand engineers about ways that \u201csci-fi thinking\u201d could be harnessed to produce\nmore imaginative approaches to scientific problems. More recently, he was\ninvited to inspect a colossal new radio dish, one of whose purposes is to\ndetect extraterrestrial communications. Its engineers had been sending Liu\nupdates on the project and effusive expressions of admiration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone who can be very naughty when left alone, and your\nname kept popping up in our database.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nEarlier this year, soon after a Chinese lunar rover achieved the unprecedented\nfeat of landing on the dark side of the moon, an adaptation of Liu\u2019s short\nstory \u201cThe Wandering Earth\u201d earned nearly half a billion dollars in its first\nten days of release, eventually becoming China\u2019s second-highest-grossing film\never. A headline in the People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party newspaper,\njubilantly summed up the mood: \u201cOnly the Chinese Can Save the Planet!\u201d\n\nLiu, who is fifty-five, first travelled to the U.S. in the eighties, on work\ntrips he made as an engineer, but before his November visit he had never been\nto Washington. In an Uber to his hotel\u2014we\u2019d come from New York by train\u2014he\npeered through square-rimmed glasses at the city gliding by, which reminded\nhim of the kind of development zone one sees on the edge of China\u2019s ever-\nexpanding cities. \u201cSparsely populated, with everything neat, orderly, and\nsymmetrical,\u201d he observed. \u201cAs if the city were built yesterday.\u201d When he saw\nthe gilded letters of the Trump hotel, he gave a gleeful chuckle. \u201cOut of all\nthe American Presidents, he is the only one whose speeches I can understand\ndirectly, without translation,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThere are no big words or\ncomplicated grammar. Everything he says is reduced to the simplest possible\nformulation.\u201d\n\nLiu\u2019s fellow sci-fi writers in China call him Da Liu\u2014Big Liu\u2014but he is small,\nwith an unusually round head, which seems too large for his slight, wiry\nphysique. He has the unassuming presence, belying an unflappable intelligence,\nof an operative posing as an accountant. Rarely making eye contact, he\nmaintains an expression at once detached and preoccupied, as if too impatient\nfor the future to commit his full attention to the present. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing\nspecial or memorable about me,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cI always blend into any\ncrowd.\u201d Sure enough, as we walked around town, I found that it was\ndisconcertingly easy to lose sight of him, and I started consciously trying to\nkeep an eye on his inconspicuous frame and clothes\u2014dark jeans and checked\ntops\u2014as if I were minding a small child.\n\nAlthough it was his first time in Washington, the cityscape was already\nfamiliar to him, thanks to his predilection for Hollywood blockbusters. As a\nresult, our sightseeing trips yielded disappointments. Things were invariably\nbigger or smaller than he expected, and in surprising juxtapositions. The\nReflecting Pool was farther from the Washington Monument than \u201cForrest Gump\u201d\nsuggested, and it looked strange without Vietnam War protesters thronging its\nperimeter. When we climbed the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Liu expressed\ndismay that the seated statue featured Lincoln\u2019s pensive face, rather than a\nsimian one. \u201cI think I prefer the \u2018Planet of the Apes\u2019 version,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen we passed a block-long brutalist building, Liu immediately recognized it\nas the headquarters of the F.B.I. It turned out that he had pored over its\nfloor plan online while researching his early novel \u201cSupernova Era,\u201d which was\npublished in 2003 and will appear in English later this year. It took him\ntwelve years to get the book published, with several rounds of revision, in\npart because prospective publishers worried about the likely reaction of the\nstate censors. Liu, unlike many Chinese writers popular in the West, is no\ndissident, but he had conceived the novel in the nervous aftermath of the\nTiananmen Square protests. He told me that during the protests, in 1989, he\nhappened to be in Beijing for an engineering conference. In an afterword to\nthe forthcoming English translation, he writes:\n\n> On the night of June 4 I listened in my hotel to the chaotic noise outside,\n> and the muffled sounds of gunfire. That night I dreamed of a limitless\n> expanse of snow, whipped up by the wind into a ground blizzard, and an\n> object\u2014perhaps the sun or a star\u2014glowing with a blinding blue light that\n> painted the sky an eerie color between purple and green. And beneath that\n> dim glow, a formation of children advanced across the snowy ground, white\n> scarves wrapped around their heads, rifles fitted with gleaming bayonets,\n> singing some unrecognizable song as they moved forward in unison. . . . I\n> awoke in a cold sweat and couldn\u2019t get back to sleep, and that\u2019s when the\n> germ of the idea for Supernova Era first took shape.\n\nIn the book, a supernova bathes Earth in deadly radiation, killing everyone\nover the age of thirteen. In the absence of adults, children must figure out\nhow to apportion resources, forge diplomatic relationships, and maintain\norder. It soon becomes evident that a world run by children is very different\nfrom one run by adults. \u201cFun\u201d is established as an organizing principle of\nlife, and international wars and an event known as the \u201cbloodbath Olympics\u201d\nare planned, purely for thrills. Liu told me that he intended the novel to\nexpress the reactions of Chinese people at a time of utter confusion in the\nface of change, when old beliefs collapsed before new ones could be enshrined.\n\nLiu was born in 1963 in Beijing, where his father was a manager at the Coal\nMine Design Institute and his mother was an elementary-school teacher. His\nfather\u2019s family came from the plains of Henan Province, in the Yellow River\nBasin, a region that suffered particularly dire calamities in the twentieth\ncentury. After the Japanese invaded China, in 1937\u2014interrupting a civil war\nbetween Nationalists and Communists that had been raging for a decade\u2014Henan\nbecame a vital strategic point in the Nationalist government\u2019s attempt to\nprevent them from sweeping south. Chinese forces breached dikes on the Yellow\nRiver to halt the Japanese advance, but the resulting flood destroyed\nthousands of villages and killed hundreds of thousands of people. It also\nruined vast areas of farmland; the next harvest was a fraction of the expected\nyield. In 1942-43, after the government failed to respond to the shortage,\nsome two million people starved to death.\n\nWhen the civil war resumed, after the Second World War, both sides conscripted\nmen. Liu\u2019s paternal grandparents had two sons and no ideological allegiance to\neither side, and, in the hope of preserving the family line, they took a\nchilling but pragmatic gamble. One son joined the Nationalists and the other,\nLiu\u2019s father, joined the Communists. He rose to the rank of company commander\nin the Eighth Route Army, and, after the Communist victory, he began his\ncareer in Beijing. To this day, Liu doesn\u2019t know what became of his uncle.\n\nLiu was three years old when the Cultural Revolution broke out. His father\nlost his job\u2014having a brother who had fought against the revolution made him\npolitically suspect\u2014and was sent to work in the coal mines of Yangquan, in\nShanxi Province, where Liu still lives. The city was a flash point for the\nfactional violence that accompanied the Cultural Revolution, and Liu remembers\nhearing gunfire at night and seeing trucks filled with men clutching guns and\nwearing red armbands. Things became dangerous enough that, when Liu was four,\nhe was sent to live with his grandparents in Henan, and stayed there for\nseveral years.\n\nAs a child, Liu was mischievous and cheeky. Even today, he retains a fondness\nfor ingenious pranks, and once created a poetry-writing algorithm, whose\nvoluminous output he submitted to a literary magazine. (It didn\u2019t publish any\nof the poems.) He also had a practical bent: after developing a fascination\nwith weapons, in grade school, he taught himself to make gunpowder. When Liu\nwas six, China launched its first satellite and he became obsessed with space.\nInitially, his ambition was to explore it rather than to write about it, but\nhe came to realize that, for someone of his background, the advanced degrees\nnecessary to work in the nascent space program were out of reach. Meanwhile,\nhis father had turned him on to speculative fiction, giving him a copy of\nJules Verne\u2019s \u201cJourney to the Center of the Earth.\u201d To the young Liu, reading\nVerne\u2019s book was like walking through a door to another world. \u201cEverything in\nit was described with such authority and scrupulous attention to detail that I\nthought it had to be real,\u201d Liu told me.\n\nOn the cusp of his teens, reading a book on astronomy, Liu had an epiphany\nabout the concept of a light-year\u2014the \u201cterrifying distance\u201d and \u201cbone-chilling\nvastness\u201d it implied. Concepts that seemed abstract to others took on, for\nhim, concrete forms; they were like things he could touch, inducing a\n\u201cdruglike euphoria.\u201d Compared with ordinary literature, he came to feel, \u201cthe\nstories of science are far more magnificent, grand, involved, profound,\nthrilling, strange, terrifying, mysterious, and even emotional.\u201d In high\nschool, he started writing his own stories, and continued after enrolling, in\n1981, at North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power. After\ngraduation, he was assigned to work at the Niangziguan Power Plant, where he\nhad plenty of time to hone his writing and to absorb all the sci-fi he could\nget his hands on, sometimes poring over a dictionary to get through\nuntranslated works by Vonnegut, Bradbury, Pynchon, and Orwell. He didn\u2019t leave\nhis engineering job until 2012, long after he\u2019d achieved wealth and national\nfame.\n\nThe scale and the speed of China\u2019s economic transformation were conducive to a\nfictive mode that concerns itself with the fate of whole societies, planets,\nand galaxies, and in which individuals are presented as cogs in larger\nsystems. The fact that state-owned enterprises were increasingly at the mercy\nof their balance sheets fundamentally changed social expectations in a country\nwhere the danwei\u2014or work unit\u2014had rivalled the family as a facet of one\u2019s\nidentity. In the nineties, tens of millions of workers found themselves laid\noff, with no social-security system. In 2000, the same year that Liu\u2019s story\n\u201cThe Wandering Earth\u201d was published, he was told to choose which half of his\nstaff to let go and which to keep.\n\nPragmatic choices like this one, or like the decision his grandparents made\nwhen their sons were conscripted, recur in his fiction\u2014situations that present\nequally unconscionable choices on either side of a moral fulcrum. An episode\nin the trilogy depicts Earth on the verge of destruction. A scientist named\nCheng Xin encounters a gaggle of schoolchildren as she and an assistant\nprepare to flee the planet. The spaceship can accommodate the weight of only\nthree of the children, and Cheng, who is the trilogy\u2019s closest embodiment of\nWestern liberal values, is paralyzed by the choice before her. Her assistant\nleaps into action, however, and poses three math problems. The three children\nwho are quickest to answer correctly are ushered on board. Cheng stares at her\nassistant in horror, but the young woman says, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I\ngave them a chance. Competition is necessary for survival.\u201d\n\nNo one is more aware than Liu of the connection between the ambitions of sci-\nfi and the tendency of Chinese history to eclipse the individual. In an\nafterword to the English edition of \u201cThe Three-Body Problem,\u201d he recalls a\nvisit to his grandparents in Henan that coincided with the great flood of\n1975. In a single day, forty inches of rain fell and more than fifty dams\ncollapsed. In the course of a few days, nearly a quarter of a million people\ndied. Recalling his experience as a twelve-year-old in a landscape teeming\nwith barefoot refugees draped in cloth sacks instead of clothes, he writes, \u201cI\nthought I was looking at the end of the world.\u201d\n\nThe great flourishing of science fiction in the West at the end of the\nnineteenth century occurred alongside unprecedented technological progress and\nthe proliferation of the popular press\u2014transformations that were fundamental\nto the development of the genre. As the British Empire expanded and the United\nStates began to assert its power around the world, British and American\nwriters invented tales of space travel as seen through a lens of imperial\nappropriation, in which technological superiority brought about territorial\nconquest. Extraterrestrials were often a proxy for human beings of different\ncreeds or races. M. P. Shiel\u2019s novel \u201cYellow Danger\u201d (1898) imagined a\nfiendish Chinese plan to take over the world, and warned that \u201cthe bony visage\nof the yellow man, in moments of unbridled lust and mad excitement, is a\nbrutal spectacle.\u201d The most famous novel of the era, H. G. Wells\u2019s \u201cThe War of\nthe Worlds\u201d (1898), in which Martians attack an unsuspecting Earth, was\ninspired by the violent struggle in early-nineteenth-century Tasmania between\nAboriginal people and white settlers, in which the indigenous population was\nalmost completely obliterated.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014none of these cookies offer an engaging brand narrative.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nWells\u2019s science fiction greatly impressed Lu Xun, a writer who is considered\nthe father of modern Chinese literature, and whose translations of Wells and\nVerne introduced the genre to China. Lu hoped that incorporating scientific\nthought into popular fiction could help remedy \u201cintellectual poverty\u201d and\nprovide a means of \u201cleading the Chinese masses on the way to progress.\u201d Lu,\nborn in 1881, had witnessed the drama of China\u2019s ancient civilization brought\nlow by younger, more technologically advanced European ones; the Chinese might\nbe more populous than the Tasmanians, but could they suffer the same fate?\n\nEarly Chinese sci-fi imagined a China that caught up with the West and then\noutstripped it. Liang Qichao\u2019s \u201cThe Future of New China\u201d (1902) is set in\n1962; in the story, Shanghai hosts the World\u2019s Fair, a geopolitically dominant\nChina has developed a multiparty system, and Westerners study the Chinese in\nthe hope of bettering themselves. In \u201cChina in Ten Years,\u201d a popular story\npublished anonymously in 1923, China develops laser weapons to repel Western\nimperialists. Joel Martinsen, the translator of the second volume of Liu\u2019s\ntrilogy, sees the series as a continuation of this tradition. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard\nto read parallels between the Trisolarans and imperialist designs on China,\ndriven by hunger for resources and fear of being wiped out,\u201d he told me. Even\nLiu, unwilling as he is to endorse comparisons between the plot and China\u2019s\ncurrent face-off with the U.S., did at one point let slip that \u201cthe\nrelationship between politics and science fiction cannot be underestimated.\u201d\n\nWhen the Communists came to power, science fiction presented itself as a handy\nway of furthering Mao\u2019s \u201cCampaign of Marching Toward Science and Technology.\u201d\nSci-fi would stimulate the interest of children and adolescents, and encourage\nthem to contribute to the country\u2019s modernization. But during the Cultural\nRevolution the genre was banned, along with other nonrevolutionary literature,\nand even science itself was subjected to ideological-purity tests. In\nastronomy, discussion of sunspots was forbidden, because the literal meaning\nof the Chinese term is \u201csolar black spots,\u201d and black was the color associated\nwith counter-revolutionaries.\n\nScience fiction made a resurgence in the early years of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s\nreformist regime, when Liu was writing at night while maintaining his\nengineering day job. It was scrutinized more closely again in the years\nimmediately after the Tiananmen protests, when he was beginning work on\n\u201cSupernova Era.\u201d The genre has now been steadily thriving for a couple of\ndecades, but it\u2019s not inconceivable that the political winds could change\nagain, as Xi Jinping\u2019s government seeks to establish increasingly rigid\ncultural control. Speculative fiction is the art of imagining alternative\nworlds, and the same political establishment that permits it to be used as\npropaganda for the existing regime is also likely to recognize its capacity to\ninterrogate the legitimacy of the status quo.\n\nIn my days with Liu, he repeatedly played down any sense of state\ninterference, but the issue emerged glancingly when we began discussing the\ngreat Polish sci-fi writer Stanis\u0142aw Lem, whom Liu reveres. \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable\nis that he lived and wrote in Soviet Poland!\u201d he said. \u201cYet he managed to be\nas beloved in the East as he was in the West.\u201d I asked how he thought Lem had\nmanaged it. \u201cHe had a wondrous imagination, truly one of a kind,\u201d Liu replied.\nStill, even Lem did not wholly escape his government\u2019s crackdown on free\nspeech. When questioned about stories that seemed to allude to Stalinist\nconformism and paranoia, Lem said the same thing that Liu says about\ngeopolitical interpretations of his trilogy\u2014that he was not writing a veiled\nassessment of the present but merely making up stories.\n\nOne day, Liu and I went to lunch at a Chinese restaurant not far from his\nhotel. It was half past two and the restaurant was empty, a void of crisp\nwhite tablecloths, punctuated by tacky, oversized ceramic vases. Large TV\nscreens burbled to themselves in every corner. As soon as we sat down, Liu\ncalled a waiter over and asked for two beers. I said I wouldn\u2019t be drinking,\nbut Liu clarified that he was happy to lay claim to both bottles. After the\nwaiter had brought Budweiser\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t discriminate: beer is beer\u201d\u2014Liu gingerly\npulled a bottle of Southern Comfort from his backpack and poured generously\ninto his drink. He had bought the bottle the day before at a liquor store. \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t make out the labels,\u201d he said, explaining that he\u2019d picked whatever\nwas cheap and easy to reach on the shelf. \u201cI chose wrong\u2014this stuff is way too\nsweet.\u201d Several times during our days together, he alluded both to his\ndependence on alcohol and to the need to abstain from hard liquor for the sake\nof his health. \u201cAt least two of my former colleagues have drunk themselves to\ndeath,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon among engineers. You know\nthe type.\u201d\n\nTypes are central to the way Liu thinks of people; he has a knack for quickly\nsketching the various classes that make up Chinese society. A scientist is\ndescribed as \u201cnothing more than a typical intellectual of the period:\ncautious, timid, seeking only to protect himself.\u201d Another character, \u201ca\ntypical political cadre of the time,\u201d had \u201can extremely keen sense for\npolitics and saw everything through an ideological lens.\u201d This characteristic\nendows his fiction with a sociopolitical specificity that has the texture of\nreality. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t allow for much emotional complexity, and\nLiu has been criticized for peopling his books with characters who seem like\ncardboard cutouts installed in magnificent dioramas. Liu readily admits to the\ncharge. \u201cI did not begin writing for love of literature,\u201d he told me. \u201cI did\nso for love of science.\u201d\n\nLiu\u2019s stories typically emerge from a speculative idea that has the potential\nto generate a vivid, evocative fable\u2014more often than not, one about mankind\u2019s\nability to bring about its own demise. \u201cThe Three-Body Problem\u201d takes its\ntitle from an analytical problem in orbital mechanics which has to do with the\nunpredictable motion of three bodies under mutual gravitational pull. Reading\nan article about the problem, Liu thought, What if the three bodies were three\nsuns? How would intelligent life on a planet in such a solar system develop?\nFrom there, a structure gradually took shape that almost resembles a planetary\nsystem, with characters orbiting the central conceit like moons. For better or\nworse, the characters exist to support the framework of the story rather than\nto live as individuals on the page.\n\nLiu\u2019s imagination is dauntingly capacious, his narratives conceived on a scale\nthat feels, at times, almost hallucinogenic. The time line of the trilogy\nspans 18,906,450 years, encompassing ancient Egypt, the Qin dynasty, the\nByzantine Empire, the Cultural Revolution, the present, and a time eighteen\nmillion years in the future. One scene is told from the perspective of an ant.\nThe first book is set on Earth, though some of its scenes take place in\nvirtual reality; by the end of the third book, the scope of the action is\ninterstellar and annihilation unfolds across several dimensions. The London\nReview of Books has called the trilogy \u201cone of the most ambitious works of\nscience fiction ever written.\u201d\n\nMuch of the books\u2019 resonance, however, comes from the fact that they also\noffer a faithful portrait of China\u2019s stringently hierarchical bureaucracy,\nthat labyrinthine product of Communism. August Cole, a co-author of \u201cGhost\nFleet,\u201d a techno-thriller about a war between the U.S. and China, told me\nthat, for him, Liu\u2019s work was crucial to understanding contemporary China,\n\u201cbecause it synthesizes multiple angles of looking at the country, from the\nanthropological to the political to the social.\u201d Although physics furnishes\nthe novels\u2019 premises, it is politics that drives the plots. At every turn, the\ncharacters are forced to make brutal calculations in which moral absolutism is\npitted against the greater good. In their pursuit of survival, men and women\nemploy Machiavellian game theory and adopt a bleak consequentialism. In Liu\u2019s\nfictional universe, idealism is fatal and kindness an exorbitant luxury. As\none general says in the trilogy, \u201cIn a time of war, we can\u2019t afford to be too\nscrupulous.\u201d Indeed, it is usually when people do not play by the rules of\nRealpolitik that the most lives are lost.\n\nLiu\u2019s posture slackened slightly as we ate. The drinks had warmed him, and the\nheat of Sichuanese peppercorns seemed to stir him from his usual reticence. I\ndecided to inch the conversation toward politics, a topic he prefers to avoid.\nHis views turned out to be staunch and unequivocal. The infamous one-child\npolicy, he said, had been vital: \u201cOr else how could the country have combatted\nits exploding population growth?\u201d He was deaf to the argument that the\npopulation growth was itself the result of a previous policy, from the\nfifties, in which the Party had declared that \u201ca larger population means\ngreater manpower.\u201d Liu took a similarly pragmatic view of a controversial\nfuneral-reform law, which mandates cremation, even though the tradition of\n\u201creturning to the ground\u201d has been part of Chinese culture for thousands of\nyears. (There were reports of elderly people committing suicide in order to be\nburied before the ban went into effect.) \u201cIf there are dead bodies everywhere,\nwhere are we supposed to plant crops?\u201d Liu said. \u201cHumans must adjust their\nhabits to accommodate changing circumstances.\u201d\n\nWhen I brought up the mass internment of Muslim Uighurs\u2014around a million are\nnow in re\u00ebducation camps in the northwestern province of Xinjiang\u2014he trotted\nout the familiar arguments of government-controlled media: \u201cWould you rather\nthat they be hacking away at bodies at train stations and schools in terrorist\nattacks? If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to\nlift them out of poverty.\u201d The answer duplicated government propaganda so\nexactly that I couldn\u2019t help asking Liu if he ever thought he might have been\nbrainwashed. \u201cI know what you are thinking,\u201d he told me with weary clarity.\n\u201cWhat about individual liberty and freedom of governance?\u201d He sighed, as if\nexhausted by a debate going on in his head. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what Chinese\npeople care about. For ordinary folks, it\u2019s the cost of health care, real-\nestate prices, their children\u2019s education. Not democracy.\u201d\n\nI looked at him, studying his face. He blinked, and continued, \u201cIf you were to\nloosen up the country a bit, the consequences would be terrifying.\u201d I\nremembered a moment near the end of the trilogy, when the Trisolarans,\npreparing to inhabit Earth, have interned the whole of humanity in Australia:\n\n> The society of resettled populations transformed in profound ways. People\n> realized that, on this crowded, hungry continent, democracy was more\n> terrifying than despotism. Everyone yearned for order and a strong\n> government. . . . Gradually, the society of the resettled succumbed to the\n> seduction of totalitarianism, like the surface of a lake caught in a cold\n> spell.\n\n\u201cSon, we think you\u2019re big enough now to know the truth.\u201d\n\nLink copied\n\nLiu closed his eyes for a long moment and then said quietly, \u201cThis is why I\ndon\u2019t like to talk about subjects like this. The truth is you don\u2019t really\u2014I\nmean, can\u2019t truly\u2014understand.\u201d He gestured around him. \u201cYou\u2019ve lived here, in\nthe U.S., for, what, going on three decades?\u201d The implication was clear: years\nin the West had brainwashed me. In that moment, in Liu\u2019s mind, I, with my\ninflexible sense of morality, was the alien.\n\nAnd so, Liu explained to me, the existing regime made the most sense for\ntoday\u2019s China, because to change it would be to invite chaos. \u201cIf China were\nto transform into a democracy, it would be hell on earth,\u201d he said. \u201cI would\nevacuate tomorrow, to the United States or Europe or\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d The irony\nthat the countries he was proposing were democracies seemed to escape his\nnotice. He went on, \u201cHere\u2019s the truth: if you were to become the President of\nChina tomorrow, you would find that you had no other choice than to do exactly\nas he has done.\u201d\n\nIt was an opinion entirely consistent with his systems-level view of human\nsocieties, just as mine reflected a belief in democracy and individualism as\nprinciples to be upheld regardless of outcomes. I was reminded of something he\nwrote in his afterword to the English edition of \u201cThe Three-Body Problem\u201d: \u201cI\ncannot escape and leave behind reality, just like I cannot leave behind my\nshadow. Reality brands each of us with its indelible mark. Every era puts\ninvisible shackles on those who have lived through it, and I can only dance in\nmy chains.\u201d\n\nWhen Liu is at his most relaxed, which is usually when he\u2019s looking at, or\nlearning about, something, he sounds almost like a child. There\u2019s an upward\nlilt to his voice that suggests a kind of na\u00efve wonder\u2014someone happily lost in\nhis own boundless curiosity. But at the Clarke Foundation award ceremony, at\nthe Harman Center for the Arts, on his final night in Washington, he was in\nadult, professional mode. Talking to fans, publishing types, and Chinese\njournalists at a cocktail party before the presentation, he spoke with\nauthority and gravitas, and was more obviously formidable than I\u2019d previously\nseen. Yet, at the same time, he seemed ill at ease and looked like the person\nwho least belonged at the party, even though it was in his honor. I noticed\nthat he wasn\u2019t drinking, despite the open bar. He wasn\u2019t here to enjoy\nhimself. He was doing a specific job and enduring the situation with stoic\ndiscipline.\n\nHis acceptance speech came at the end of the evening, after a dinner, and he\nmade a point of reading it in English. His pronunciation hovered on the\nboundary of comprehensibility, but the text had been distributed to the\naudience, which listened attentively. He spoke of how his imagination had been\nfired by reading Clarke\u2019s novels, some of which were published in China in the\neighties\u2014a time when, he said, young people like him felt lost. He recalled\nfinishing \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d and walking outside to gaze into the night\nsky: \u201cI was able to see the galaxy, thanks to the unpolluted sky of China back\nthen.\u201d Chinese people of his generation were lucky, he said. The changes they\nhad seen were so huge that they now inhabited a world entirely different from\nthat of their childhood. \u201cChina is a futuristic country,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized\nthat the world around me became more and more like science fiction, and this\nprocess is speeding up.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Liu and I did some more sightseeing, accompanied by a\ntranslator his publisher had provided. The sky was cement-colored and heavy\nand we soon had to duck into a pharmacy to buy umbrellas. As I struggled with\nthe jammed spines of my purchase, I recalled a line from his speech in which\nhe compared the future to \u201cpouring rain\u201d that \u201creaches us before we have time\nto even open the umbrella.\u201d\n\nLiu\u2019s observation was more practical: \u201cThe quality of umbrellas that China\nsells to the U.S. is not good.\u201d\n\nWe made our way down Constitution Avenue, past the National Archives and the\ncolonnades of the Smithsonian. Liu set a surprisingly brisk pace and remarked\nthat he had not exercised since being on the road, whereas he was used to\nworking out an hour or two a day. Nothing he\u2019d said or done previously\nsuggested a concern with fitness, but it turned out that he had a specific\neventuality in mind. \u201cTo make it on a spaceship for days or weeks, maybe even\nmonths, is not easy,\u201d he said. I asked if he was planning to be a space\ntourist. \u201cYou never know when that will happen,\u201d he responded. \u201cOpportunity\ndoesn\u2019t wait for you to be ready.\u201d\n\nWe paused by the World War II Memorial, and looked at the names of various\ncountries carved in clusters around the lip of its fountain. Liu squinted,\ndispleased with the peripheral placement of China, which had been put with\nIndia and Burma. Like a man unsatisfied with a photograph of himself, Liu\nballed up his hands and placed them on his hips. Surely, China had contributed\nto the war far more than Burma had, he muttered.\n\nAs we walked on, Liu noticed the sunken sliver of the Vietnam Veterans\nMemorial. Up close, the names of veterans emerged, some fifty-eight thousand\nof them, etched in rows that felt as unending as the grief they evoked. Pale-\npink carnations and notes written on cardboard punctuated the black granite. A\nman in a wheelchair wept openly where the memorial\u2019s two walls met.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t China have something like this?\u201d Liu asked quietly. \u201cThe dead\ndeserve to be remembered.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut China does, doesn\u2019t it, in some cities?\u201d his translator asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Liu answered emphatically, shaking his head. \u201cWe have statues of a few\nmartyrs, but we never\u2014We don\u2019t memorialize those, the individuals.\u201d He took\noff his glasses and blinked, peering into the wide expanse of green and\nconcrete. \u201cThis is how we Chinese have always been,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen something\nhappens, it passes, and time buries the stories.\u201d \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the June 24, 2019, issue, with the headline\n\u201cThe War of the Worlds.\u201d\n\nJiayang Fan is a staff writer at The New Yorker.\n\nMore:WritersScience FictionMoviesAsiansChina\n\n### Weekly\n\nEnjoy our flagship newsletter as a digest delivered once a week.\n\nRead More\n\nBooks\n\nScience Fiction Doesn\u2019t Have to Be Dystopian\n\nIn Ted Chiang\u2019s new collection of stories, technology can be a force for\nhuman\u2014and robotic\u2014good.\n\nBy Joyce Carol Oates\n\nPage-Turner\n\nChina\u2019s Arthur C.
