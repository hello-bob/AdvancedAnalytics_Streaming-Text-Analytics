They're\nanalytical thinkers and usually more introverted, spending more time talking\nto machines in computer programming languages than schmoozing over business\ndeals.\n\nBut in the age of AI, where models can generate code faster, and often better,\nthan humans, the typical education path of a software engineer is being\nupended.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nGoldman Sachs' chief information officer, Marco Argenti, recently encouraged\nhis daughter, a college student, to concentrate her education on philosophy if\nshe wants to pursue a career in engineering.\n\n\"Coming from an engineer, that might seem counterintuitive, but the ability to\ndevelop crisp mental models around the problems you want to solve and\nunderstanding the why before you start working on the how is an increasingly\ncritical skillset, especially in the age of AI,\" Argenti wrote in a Harvard\nBusiness Review article this week.\n\nOver his decades of managing engineering teams at Goldman Sachs and Amazon Web\nServices, Argenti said asking the right questions is one of the most important\nskills he's learned.\n\n\"It's not dissimilar with AI: The quality of the output of a large language\nmodel is very sensitive to the quality of the prompt,\" he added.\n\nTo be clear, having a technical edge, whether it's math, computer science, or\ndata analytics, is still likely table stakes when it comes to software\nengineering. However, it's becoming increasingly important to train the more\ncreative part of the brain through writing and social sciences courses, like\nEnglish, philosophy, and psychology, according to some of Wall Street's top\ntech execs and recruiters. Doing so will prepare the coming generations of\nsoftware engineers and help futureproof their jobs against AI.\n\nRelated stories\n\nWith generative AI, it's possible for people, including non-tech workers, to\ntype a command in plain English and have the models generate lines of code\nthat execute on that ask. This emerging discipline is called prompt\nengineering, and it's becoming a key piece to the success or failure of AI-\ngenerated code.\n\n\"Miss the mark on the prompt, and your AI will produce code that's plausible\nat best, incorrect, and dangerous at worst,\" Argenti said.\n\nCiti's co-chief information officer, Shadman Zafar, echoed the importance of\nclear and concise communication and writing skills when it comes to code.\n\n\"As AI comes in, cogent and clear communication becomes much more important,\nand the ability to actually phrase your questions correctly, soundly, and\nsafely makes a lot more of a difference as well,\" Zafar told Business Insider.\nAs such, communication and psychology are becoming \"more valued minors or\nmajors for students to focus on,\" he said.\n\nZafar said he's paying more attention to people with \"a computer science\ndegree and an English minor,\" or \"a psychology major and a computer science\nminor.\"\n\nJensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, the chip-manufacturing company that's\nskyrocketed with the rise of AI, went as far as to advise the next generations\nnot to learn how to code. At the World Government Summit in Dubai in March, he\nsaid that programming is no longer a critical skill with AI.\n\nThat sentiment was shared by Ken Griffin, the billionaire CEO of the hedge\nfund Citadel, who said the days of being \"a good programmer are becoming\nnumbered.\" Instead, the success of a technologist will hinge on being a really\ngood problem solver, which involves understanding the business and the\ncommercial aspects of technology.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether AI will replace software engineers, those\nlooking to futureproof their jobs should think about the parts of the job that\nAI could handle and zero in on tasks where there is a human in the loop,\naccording to Deepali Vyas, global head of fintech and applied intelligence at\nsearch firm Korn Ferry.\n\n\"That software engineer might get replaced by a sort of prompt engineer,\" Vyas\nsaid. If that's the case, \"I would make sure that I have good problem-solving,\ncritical thinking, and writing skills,\" she said.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: AI will drive personalization, not creativity, says Roku's VP of\ngrowth marketing, Sweta Patel\n\nGoldman Sachs Education\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
