For other uses, see Smell of Rain\n(disambiguation).\n\nSoil and water being splashed by a raindrop\n\nPetrichor (/\u02c8p\u025btr\u026a\u02cck\u0254\u02d0r/)^[1] is the earthy scent produced when rain falls on\ndry soil. The word is constructed from Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (p\u00e9tra) 'rock', or\n\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (p\u00e9tros) 'stone', and \u1f30\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1 (ikh\u1e53r), the ethereal fluid that is the\nblood of the gods in Greek mythology.\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\nOn 17 April 1891, a brief note on the phenomenon, by Thomas Lambe Phipson [fr]\n(1833\u20131908), appeared in The Chemical News^[2]\u2014it was re-published in its\nentirety, a month later, in The Scientific American^[3]\u2014in which he wrote,\n\"This subject, with which I was occupied more than twenty-five years ago,\nappears from a paragraph in a late number of the Chemical News^[4] to have\nrecently attracted the attention of Professor Berthelot and [Monsieur G.]\nAndre.\"\n\nPhipson was referring to a short paper read by Berthelot and Andr\u00e9 at the\nmeeting of the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences on 23 April 1891, and printed in\nVolume 112 (1891) of Comptes Rendus, entitled \"Sur l'odeur propre de la terre\"\n(\"On the earth's own smell\").^[5]^[6]\n\nPhipson continues, \"I find, on referring to my old notes, which are dated\n1865, that it is doubtful whether I ever published the results of these\nobservations; and as the distinguished chemists I have just named have not\nquite solved the problem, I hasten to give the results I obtained so long\nago.\" He then theorizes that the odour \"... was due to the presence of organic\nsubstances closely related to the essential oils of plants ...\" and that these\nsubstances consist of \"... the fragrance emitted by thousands of flowers ...\"\nabsorbed into the pores of the soil, and only released when displaced by rain.\nAfter attempts to isolate it, he found that it \"... appeared to be very\nsimilar to, if not identical with, bromo-cedren derived from essence of\ncedar.\"\n\nThe phenomenon was first scientifically described in a March 1964 paper by\nAustralian researchers Isabel Bear and Dick Thomas, published in the journal\nNature.^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10] Thomas coined the term \"petrichor\" to refer to what\nhad previously been known as \"argillaceous odour\".^[11] In the article, the\nauthors describe how the smell derives from an oil exuded by certain plants\nduring dry periods, whereupon it is absorbed by clay-based soils and rocks.\nDuring rain, the oil is released into the air along with another compound,\ngeosmin, a metabolic by-product of certain actinobacteria, such as\nStreptomyces,^[12] which is emitted by wet soil, producing the distinctive\nscent; ozone may also be present if there is lightning.^[13] In a follow-up\npaper, Bear and Thomas (1965) showed that the oil slows seed germination and\nearly plant growth.^[14]\n\n## Mechanism[edit]\n\nWhen a raindrop lands on a porous surface, air from the pores forms small\nbubbles, which float to the surface and release aerosols.^[15] Such aerosols\ncarry the scent, as well as bacteria and viruses from the soil.^[15] Raindrops\nthat move at a slower rate tend to produce more aerosols; this serves as an\nexplanation for why petrichor is more common after light rains. Members of the\nActinomycetes, gram-positive bacteria, are responsible for producing these\naerosols.^[15]^[12]\n\nThe human nose is sensitive to geosmin and is able to detect it at\nconcentrations as low as 0.4 parts per billion.^[16] Some scientists believe\nthat humans appreciate the rain scent because ancestors may have relied on\nrainy weather for survival.^[17] Camels in the desert also rely on petrichor\nto locate sources of water such as oases.^[18]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Dimethyl sulfide \u2013 One of the molecules responsible for the odour of the sea\n  * Mitti attar \u2013 a perfume that recreates the loamy smell of a first rain\n  * Geosmin \u2013 Chemical compound responsible for the characteristic odour of earth\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"petrichor\".
