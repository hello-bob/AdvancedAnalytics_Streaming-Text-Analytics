The news was first reported by local paper De Standaard.\n\nPlatforms that operate in Europe are required to appoint a local\nrepresentative under the bloc's new content moderation rulebook, the Digital\nServices Act (DSA).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTelegram, founded by Russian-born Pavel Durov, gained in popularity for its\nprivacy-friendly features but in recent years also became a hotbed for\nconspiracy theorists, cybercriminal groups and extremists promoting hate\nspeech. The platform claims to have over 800 million monthly active users\nglobally.\n\nWhile the world's largest technology companies are supervised by the European\nCommission and face the strictest rules under the DSA, smaller platforms are\nsupervised by national regulators in the country where they have their legal\nrepresentation.\n\nTelegram chose a Brussels-based firm called the European Digital Services\nRepresentative (EDSR) to represent it.\n\nIt will be overseen by Belgium's telecom authority BIPT as the so-called\nDigital Services Coordinator. The authority \"will be fully competent only in a\ncouple of weeks\" when the country publishes its law implementing the regime,\nsaid BIPT spokesperson Jimmy Smedts.\n\nTelegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRelated Tags\n\nCommunications Digital Services Act Disinformation Election security Media\nPlatforms Services Social Media Transparency\n\nRelated Countries\n\nBelgium Russia\n\nRelated People\n\nPavel Durov\n\n## Our readers read next\n\n## Belgium calls for EU sanctions on imports from Israeli-occupied territories\n\n10 MINS ago 3 mins read\n\n## Journalists at Italian public media strike over Meloni government\u2019s\ninfluence\n\n35 MINS ago 3 mins read\n\n## Macron urges Xi to offer \u2018fair rules for all\u2019 amid brewing trade spat\n\n3 HRS ago 3 mins read\n\n## How MEPs make millions on the side: Legal advice, speeches and Covid cures\n\n11 HRS ago 4 mins read\n\n## More from Pieter Haeck\n\n## Europe is nowhere close to banning TikTok\n\nThe EU has its own ways to deal with the video app. A blanket ban is not (yet)\npart of it.\n\nMay 3 5 mins read\n\n## TikTok ban in EU is \u2018not excluded,\u2019 von der Leyen says\n\nThe remark comes amid a streak of bad news for TikTok in Europe.\n\nApr 29 2 mins read\n\n## Ex-Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt was a victim of Chinese hacking\n\nBelgium\u2019s foreign minister recently summoned Beijing\u2019s envoy over espionage\ncampaign.\n\nApr 29 2 mins read\n\n## New CEO of Dutch chips champ enters US-China fray\n\nIncoming ASML chief Christophe Fouquet must navigate a politically sensitive\nlandscape when it comes to export controls.\n\nApr 24 5 mins read\n\n", "frontpage": false}
