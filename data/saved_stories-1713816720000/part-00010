It's Monday once again, dear reader, and you know what that means:\nanother dive into the Who, Me? confessional, to share stories of IT gone wrong\nthat Reg readers managed to pretend had gone right.\n\nThis week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as \"Declan\" who describes himself as\n\"a designer working with CAD to design machines\" \u2013 but one with enough\ntechnical nous that he essentially taught himself how to use the software.\nIndeed, at his first job in the '90s he was considered the \"technical guy\" and\nthe go-to for support.\n\nThe consultancy he was working for had a bunch of Windows machines, a few Unix\nboxes \u2013 mostly from Sun and Silicon Graphics \u2013 plus one Digital Alpha RISC\nmachine, running the special cut of Windows NT Microsoft made for those boxes.\nFor those who don't remember that short-lived project, it was basically\nMicrosoft's half-hearted gesture to the idea that there were non-Intel\nprocessors in the world. Most of the work on porting NT to Alpha was done by\nDigital, and when that firm was bought by Compaq the dream was over.\n\nAnyway, long story short, Windows NT ran on Alpha, but not hugely well, and\nthere were virtually no native applications for it \u2013 almost everything ran in\nemulation. However at the time the 500MHz Alpha was sufficiently speedy that\nperformance was adequate. That was the machine Declan used.\n\nDeclan's varied duties (on top of his CAD work) had him installing Windows,\nsupporting the network, and above all trying to stop his co-workers spreading\nviruses.\n\n  * Tired techie 'fixed' a server, blamed Microsoft, and got away with it\n  * Windows 95 support chap skipped a step and sent user into Micro-hell\n  * You break it, you ... run away and hope somebody else fixes it\n  * DBA made ten years of data disappear with one misplaced parameter\n\nDeclan understood that a virus hitting his employer's network would probably\nbring work to a halt, because the antivirus software of the time was mostly\nupdated only after infections were widespread. He was therefore most diligent\nin instructing everyone to be cautious about opening attachments or unfamiliar\nfiles from untrusted sources.\n\nThen as now, prevention was superior to cure.\n\nAlso then as now, people make mistakes.\n\nOne tired, stressed afternoon, Declan received an email which contained an\nExcel spreadsheet. Thinking it looked legit enough, he double-clicked to open\nit.\n\nImmediately his screen was obscured by error messages. He panicked, realizing\nthat the spreadsheet must have contained a macro virus. Then he realized that\nhe was about to take the company down by doing exactly what he warned everyone\nelse not to do. Oh, the shame! The humiliation!\n\nAfter a moment, though, a calm descended upon him as he read the error\nmessages.\n\nThe spreadsheet was indeed infected. However, the worm it contained was\ndesigned to open the recipient's contact list in Outlook and send itself to\neveryone, thus perpetuating its spread \u2013 for no reason other than to spread\nfurther.\n\nWasn\u2019t the world nice before ransomware?\n\nWhat this worm had not counted on was that Declan was running both Excel and\nOutlook in emulation, and the integration between them in that environment was\nso poor that it couldn't work. The worm kept trying to create emails and send\nthem, but failed every single time.\n\nDeclan managed to stop the flood of error messages on his own machine, and\nrealized he would never ever have to tell anyone about his tragic lapse in\nvigilance.\n\nIf you've got something you've always wanted to get off your chest, tell us\nall about it in an email to Who, Me? and we'll cleanse your soul \u2013\nanonymously, of course. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Who, Me?\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Who, Me?\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Sysadmin\n\n#### More about\n\n20 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Who, Me?\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Who, Me?\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Sysadmin\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Tired techie 'fixed' a server, blamed Microsoft, and got away with it\n\nwho, me?
