For many people,\nBlack reflects a shared sense of identity and community. White carries a\ndifferent set of meanings; capitalizing the word in this context risks\nfollowing the lead of white supremacists.\n\nIn deciding on a styling, fusspot grammarians and addled copy editors\ngenerally fall back on a pair of considerations. The first is broad adherence\nto a general rule\u2014like, say, the Chicago Manual of Style\u2019s (\u00a78.38) edict that\n\u201cNames of ethnic and national groups are capitalized.\u201d (Though Chicago still\ngenerally mandates lowercasing both black and white, it does include the\nproviso that the rule can be suspended if \u201ca particular author or publisher\nprefers otherwise.\u201d) The second thing we look for is attestation. In this\ncase, it\u2019s instructive to turn not to the largely lilywhite mainstream press\n(nor to the style guides that govern their renderings), but to writers of\ncolor and to alternative stylebooks. The Diversity Style Guide (2019),\nproduced by Rachele Kanigel in consultation with some fifty journalists and\nexperts, takes it as a given that Black ought to be capitalized. Sarah Glover,\na past president of the National Association of Black Journalists, wrote in a\nrecent piece for the New York Amsterdam News, a historically Black weekly,\nthat \u201ccapitalizing the \u2018B\u2019 in Black should become standard use to describe\npeople, culture, art and communities.\u201d After all, she pointed out, \u201cWe already\ncapitalize Asian, Hispanic, African American and Native American.\u201d\n\nAnd, as my CJR colleague Alexandria Neason told me recently, \u201cI view the term\nBlack as both a recognition of an ethnic identity in the States that doesn\u2019t\nrely on hyphenated Americanness (and is more accurate than African American,\nwhich suggests recent ties to the continent) and is also transnational and\ninclusive of our Caribbean [and] Central/South American siblings.\u201d To\ncapitalize Black, in her view, is to acknowledge that slavery \u201cdeliberately\nstripped\u201d people forcibly shipped overseas \u201cof all other ethnic/national\nties.\u201d She added, \u201cAfrican American is not wrong, and some prefer it, but if\nwe are going to capitalize Asian and South Asian and Indigenous, for example,\ngroups that include myriad ethnic identities united by shared race and\ngeography and, to some degree, culture, then we also have to capitalize\nBlack.\u201d\n\nPer this understanding, it is a kind of orthographic injustice to lowercase\nthe B: to do so is to perpetuate the iniquity of an institution that uprooted\npeople from the most ethnically diverse place on the planet, systematically\nobliterating any and all distinctions regarding ethnicity and culture. When\npeople identify with specific terms of the African diaspora, we defer to\nthose; in the absence of the identifiable ethnicities slavery stole from those\nit subjugated, Black can be a preferred ethnic designation for some\ndescendants. (For a pop-culture consideration of this question, see the\n\u201cJuneteenth\u201d episode of Atlanta, in which a woke white husband asks Donald\nGlover\u2019s character what part of \u201cthe motherland\u201d he\u2019s from, hazarding a guess\nthat the answer might be \u201csoutheastern Bantu.\u201d Glover responds, dryly, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know. See, this spooky thing called slavery happened and my entire\nethnic identity was erased.\u201d)\n\nIf capping the B strikes you as in part a project of reclamation, well, it is.\nAs The Diversity Style Guide notes,\n\n> There are various historical, social and political reasons why one might\n> prefer to identify as Black. The term has historically connected people of\n> African descent around the world and was revived during the Black Power\n> Movement.... Black and then African American replaced older terms such as\n> Colored and Negro imposed by others. Self-identification might reflect\n> feelings about origin, affiliation, colonialism, enslavement and cultural\n> dispossession.\n\nSign up for CJR's daily email\n\nThat argument persuaded CJR to change its style (in defiance of a piece\npublished on our site a few years earlier). Glover, in her article, called on\nthe Associated Press stylebook (\u201cthe bible for working journalists\u201d) to update\nits entry. Given the timing, after the killing of George Floyd and in light of\na global reckoning with race relations, I\u2019d be surprised if the AP didn\u2019t take\nheed, and soon. In the meantime\u2014and in what is surely a sign of evolving\nAmerican attitudes on the topic\u2014USA Today has announced that it will be\nadopting the cap-B Black across its network, which includes the flagship paper\nand \u201cmore than 260 local news organizations.\u201d (The man responsible for issuing\nthe editorial fiat, Michael McCarter, was named managing editor of standards,\nethics, and inclusion exactly one day before making the call.)\n\nThis all makes for a good start, but it will mean nothing if white Americans\ndon\u2019t make an effort to understand the whys and wherefores\u2014which is to say,\nthe history that delivered us to this precise point in time. That, of course,\nwill be a taller order than simply asking them to capitalize one little\nletter.\n\nEditors Note: This piece has been updated for clarity. An earlier version\nincluded an explanation that was off-base. We appreciate the feedback, have\nrevised the language, and will continue to discuss this subject internally.\n\nRECENTLY: The movement for Black trans lives\n\nMike Laws is a freelance copy editor and occasional writer who roves and\ntrawls the greater New York City area.
