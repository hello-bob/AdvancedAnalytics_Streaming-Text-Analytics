This graph is\nused in reliability engineering and deterioration modeling. The 'bathtub'\nrefers to the shape of a line that curves up at both ends, similar in shape to\na bathtub. The bathtub curve has 3 regions:\n\n  1. The first region has a decreasing failure rate due to early failures.\n  2. The middle region is a constant failure rate due to random failures.\n  3. The last region is an increasing failure rate due to wear-out failures.\n\nNot all products exhibit a bathtub curve failure rate. A product is said to\nfollow the bathtub curve if in the early life of a product, the failure rate\ndecreases as defective products are identified and discarded, and early\nsources of potential failure such as manufacturing defects or damage during\ntransit are detected. In the mid-life of a product the failure rate is\nconstant. In the later life of the product, the failure rate increases due to\nwearout. Many electronic consumer product life cycles follow the bathtub\ncurve.^[1] It is difficult to know where a product is along the bathtub curve,\nor even if the bathtub curve is applicable to a certain product without large\namounts of products in use and associated failure rate data.\n\nIf products are retired early or have decreased usage near their end of life,\nthe product may show fewer failures per unit calendar time (but not per unit\nuse time) than the bathtub curve predicts.\n\nIn reliability engineering, the cumulative distribution function corresponding\nto a bathtub curve may be analysed using a Weibull chart^[1] or in a\nreliability contour map.^[2]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Gompertz\u2013Makeham law of mortality\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b J.
