With the increase in capabilities, researchers have been\n> increasingly interested in their ability to exploit cybersecurity\n> vulnerabilities. In particular, recent work has conducted preliminary\n> studies on the ability of LLM agents to autonomously hack websites. However,\n> these studies are limited to simple vulnerabilities. In this work, we show\n> that LLM agents can autonomously exploit one-day vulnerabilities in real-\n> world systems. To show this, we collected a dataset of 15 one-day\n> vulnerabilities that include ones categorized as critical severity in the\n> CVE description. When given the CVE description, GPT-4 is capable of\n> exploiting 87% of these vulnerabilities compared to 0% for every other model\n> we test (GPT-3.5, open-source LLMs) and open-source vulnerability scanners\n> (ZAP and Metasploit). Fortunately, our GPT-4 agent requires the CVE\n> description for high performance: without the description, GPT-4 can exploit\n> only 7% of the vulnerabilities. Our findings raise questions around the\n> widespread deployment of highly capable LLM agents.\n\nSubjects:| Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.08144 [cs.CR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.08144v2 [cs.CR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.08144arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Daniel Kang [view email] [v1] Thu, 11 Apr 2024 22:07:19 UTC (370 KB)\n[v2] Wed, 17 Apr 2024 04:34:39 UTC (370 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled LLM Agents can Autonomously Exploit One-day\nVulnerabilities, by Richard Fang and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2024-04\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
