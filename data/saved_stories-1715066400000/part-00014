Rubenstein wrote in her\n\u201cClass Notes\u201d for the alumni magazine:\n\nThe net result is not pretty\u2014my life is a delicate balance. For example, when\nthe contractors redoing our master bedroom failed to properly hook up the new\npipes, and water came cascading down into our kitchen, I had to drop\neverything and deal. Or when my kids have two separate activities in two\nseparate locations thirty minutes apart. And god forbid a kid gets sick.\n\nMuch of what Rubenstein was saying over fifteen years ago will resonate with\npeople (particularly women) who have recently been through the COVID-19\npandemic. There is, however, one important difference. In 2007, work\nsituations like Rubenstein\u2019s weren\u2019t all that common. Today, such a situation\nis almost the norm, with the Canadian federal government and many other large\nemployers having shifted immediately to off-site work at the onset of\nCOVID-19. Hundreds of thousands of workers still spend at least part of their\nweek working from home.\n\nHybrid workplaces are still so new that it would be foolhardy to attempt any\nevaluation of how well they have worked thus far, let alone any prediction of\nhow they might operate in the future. On the one hand, a reduction in the\nnumber of work-related commutes is good for the environment. On the other,\nentire days spent on Zoom and using other modern technologies are potentially\nhazardous to employees\u2019 physical and mental health (heavy users experience\nnumerous physical problems, including headaches, back and neck strain, chronic\nfatigue, and more).\n\n  * Are Workplaces Inherently Toxic?\n  * Parental Leave Is Broken\n  * How Workplace Diversity Fails Indigenous Employees\n\nAnother plus: the flexibility gained from being able to fit medical\nappointments or child care responsibilities into a daily schedule,\nparticularly for working mothers. But the loss of the workplace as a place\noutside the home where it\u2019s possible to gain validation as an adult and find\ncamaraderie and support is a clear minus. And while the potential savings to\ngovernment and other large employers from reducing the amount of office space\nthey must own or rent may be significant, these savings often come at a cost.\nFrom an economic and political perspective, a large-scale shift to off-site\nwork can seriously depress markets for office buildings and leave large\ndowntown areas looking like ghost towns.\n\nDetailed socio-economic research will be necessary to determine whether the\npluses of hybrid working outweigh the minuses. Even then, the answers will\nlikely be different depending on the perspective one brings to the issue.\nWorking from home, for example, has entailed sharing workspace, computer time,\nand internet access with other family members. The last of these, in\nparticular, can be problematic, especially in rural areas where internet\nservice had never been all that good to begin with and where the increased\ndemand resulting from large numbers of people working from home led to\nfrequent service failures, which in turn were a significant disruption to the\njob at hand.\n\nAlso making the job harder was the challenge of communicating with workers\nthrough Zoom or other new technologies. Bringing people together became\nincreasingly difficult\u2014and increasingly unproductive when it did occur. It\u2019s\nentirely possible such challenges will only get worse as companies find ways\nto blend on-site workers with those still operating from home.\n\nThe one thing that can be said with some degree of certainty is that achieving\nthe complicated transition to a part in-person, part remote workplace\nrequires, and will require, tolerance, understanding, and goodwill, as well as\neffective communication between the workplace parties. The key to post-\npandemic organizational success, says Carleton University business professor\nLinda Duxbury, who researched remote work during the pandemic, is flexibility\nand a willingness to listen to employees and hear what their needs are.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to actually start talking to your people and stop pretending that\nthere is some magical plan you can implement and it\u2019ll be a miracle.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Duxbury says, there is no one ideal schedule that can be\napplied to all or even most workers in hybrid post-pandemic workplaces. At\nleast in the near future, she suggests, work schedules are likely to become\nhighly individualized, to the degree that there may not even be any single\n\u201cnormal\u201d work-hours arrangement.\n\nThe possible variations in work schedules are nearly infinite, with some\nemployers asking only that employees come into the work site one day a week,\nor even one or two days a month, and others wanting their staff on site as\nmany as three or four days a week. About a year into the post-pandemic return\nto work, one trend that was observed in certain Canadian cities was a modest\npreference for taking at-home days on Mondays and Fridays. Foot traffic in\nurban centres such as Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, and\nOttawa was found to be lightest on those two days and heaviest Tuesdays\nthrough Thursdays. Similarly, public transit use in Toronto was found to be\nheavier on the mid-week days and lighter on Mondays and Fridays.\n\nA second trend is a hardening of employer attitudes around hybrid scheduling,\na growing insistence that employees spend significantly more time on site.\nThis tough new approach has appeared in both public and private sectors and in\nboth Canada and the United States. Initially (in early 2022), employers were\ncautious, almost hesitant, about attempting to impose any particular\narrangement. Indeed, so cautious were many Canadian employers that Financial\nPost writer Victoria Wells, quoting the results of a worker survey on hybrid\nwork schedules, found many employees wishing their employers would impose more\nstructure; it appeared that many workers simply didn\u2019t know where they stood\nunder the new regime.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s complete reversal of Twitter\u2019s\u2014now X\u2014previous work-from-home\npolicy sent shock waves not just through the company but through the entire IT\ncommunity. On taking over control of the company in the fall of 2022, Musk\nwasted no time ending the earlier permissive policy. \u201cThe road ahead is\narduous,\u201d he wrote in a memo to staff soon after taking over, \u201cand will\nrequire intense work to succeed.\u201d Under the new regime, remote work would no\nlonger be allowed except for those with specific exemptions. Musk also stated\nthat Twitter employees were expected to be in the office for forty hours per\nweek, which he pointed out was less than what he expected of his factory\nworkers at his other companies.\n\nBut this was only the warm-up act. Musk emailed an ultimatum to employees on\nNovember 15, 2022: Commit to a new \u201chardcore\u201d Twitter or leave the company\nwith severance pay. Employees were told they had to sign a pledge to stay on\nwith the company. Anyone not signing the pledge by 5 p.m. Eastern time on\nNovember 16 would receive three months of severance pay, the email said.\n\nIf Musk\u2019s aim was to reduce the size of his workforce\u2014it\u2019s difficult to find\nany other rationale for such a message\u2014he succeeded, perhaps beyond his\nwildest dreams. Taking him at his word, disgruntled employees left by the\nhundreds.\n\nTechnology writer Cindy Davis suggests that Musk\u2019s actions at X may be a sign\nthat the hybrid workplace experiment is entering a new phase, with full-time\nwork or a return to on-site work becoming the norm as the economy becomes more\nuncertain and the job market tightens. But there are early indications of how\nMusk\u2019s move has played out. Few of them look good for the company.\n\nTo say that X hasn\u2019t thrived under its new regime would be to put things very\nmildly. On March 6, 2023, it experienced its sixth outage of that still very\nyoung year. The repeated outages have done little to inspire confidence in a\ncompany already seriously embattled on several other fronts. Advertising\nrevenue, X\u2019s single biggest source of income, has by Musk\u2019s own admission\ntaken a \u201cmassive\u201d hit since his takeover. One source reported that X\u2019s daily\nrevenue in January 2023 was down 40 percent from the previous year. The\ncompany has also become involved in disputes with its suppliers of office\nspace, janitorial supplies, and even web-hosting services, resulting from its\nfailure to pay the bills owed for those services, and with Amazon Web Services\nover the cost of its cloud computing service.\n\nOne can\u2019t blame all of these problems on Musk\u2019s new work schedule policy. But\nit certainly hasn\u2019t helped. Some observers, such as Steven Murdoch, professor\nof security engineering at University College, London, have suggested that\nstaff reductions, particularly in the engineering team, have resulted in\nreduced monitoring and oversight, which in turn has meant that problems that\nin the past might have been caught while they were still small have turned\ninto big ones. And the hit to the company\u2019s reputation may take years to\nrepair, putting X at a severe disadvantage in what is still a highly\ncompetitive job market for engineers and other IT staff.\n\nWhat X has gone through in recent months would not appear to augur well for\nthe future of hardline back-to-the-office policies. Also instructive in this\nconnection is the experience of people like New York City mayor Eric Adams, an\nearly back-to-the-office \u201chawk,\u201d who by February of 2022 was saying that New\nYork workers needed to return to the office\u2014mocking people who, he said, were\nafraid of COVID-19 on Monday but were out at clubs on Sunday\u2014and who in June\nof 2022 imposed a full-time back-to-the-office policy on city employees.\nRecently, Adams has begun backpedalling on the issue. The reason? Serious\nstaff shortages in several key departments resulting from large numbers of\nunfilled positions. With the city already lagging behind the private sector\nwith regard to employee compensation, the rigid requirement has put it at a\nsevere competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis more flexible employers willing to\nconsider a hybrid model. In effect conceding defeat on the location-of-work\nissue, Adams has admitted, \u201cThere\u2019s a pulse shift that you have to go out now\nand compete.\u201d If this means allowing city employees to work from home at least\npart of the time, then so be it.\n\nIt is, I think, particularly significant that Canada\u2019s hybrid Parliament has\nbeen made effectively permanent and that the president of Canada\u2019s Treasury\nBoard has declared that hybrid work is here to stay. With hybrid work no\nlonger temporary, it\u2019s time to take a closer look at the issues raised by\n\u201cnormalizing\u201d such an arrangement. These include blurring the line between\nwork time and personal time. It may be emotionally and even logistically\ndifficult for employees to \u201cjust say no\u201d to responding to communications\narriving outside of what they believe are their work hours. As difficult as\nmaking the distinction may be, employees must nonetheless do so in order to\npreserve their sanity. In this regard, a well-defined right to\ndisconnect\u2014whether one enshrined in legislation, as in Ontario and several\nEuropean countries, or one contained in a company policy\u2014is of huge advantage\nto employees.\n\nAnother issue around hybrid work schedules, particularly schedules that aren\u2019t\nthe same for all workers, is their potential for inadvertently creating a\nstatus divide based on the amount of time a worker spends at the office. As\nCharlie Warzel and Anne Helen Petersen have noted in Out of Office, hybrid\nwork schedules threaten to deepen already existing divides between those\ncurrently in favour with the boss and those less so. Say Warzel and Petersen,\n\u201cSingle parents, workers with elderly family members, disabled employees, and\nthose who simply don\u2019t want to live in proximity to the office risk being\novershadowed by those who come in every day. And even if a manager is careful,\na recency and proximity bias might emerge.\u201d\n\nThe result, again, is good for nobody. \u201cAmbitious, competitive employees will\nsacrifice remote flexibility and work relentlessly in person, while remote\nemployees, motivated by the anxiety of not seeming productive, will live in\nfear of managers and compensate with overwork. Both sides end up driving the\nother to misery.\u201d\n\nFor all of the problems associated with hybrid work schedules\u2014and, as noted,\nthere are a good many\u2014their potential to help organizations recruit and retain\nstaff suggests that they will be with us for some time to come. I can do no\nbetter than repeat Duxbury\u2019s advice, cited earlier, on the need for\nflexibility, good employer\u2013employee communication, and understanding.\nOrganizations following that advice are likely to fare much better in the\nyears to come than those taking the \u201cMy way or the highway!\u201d approach\npromulgated by Musk and his ilk.\n\nExcerpted from Work Less: New Strategies for a Changing Workplace by Jon\nPeirce.
