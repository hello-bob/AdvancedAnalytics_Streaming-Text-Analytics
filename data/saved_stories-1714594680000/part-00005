I\nclosed the final pages of Chris Fabricant\u2019s excellent \u201cJunk Science\u201d1 and\nlooked up as the strange car on this strange street approached.\n\nAll of the occupants were hidden from view behind impenetrable tinted windows.\n\nI tensed slightly.\n\nMy nerves were a bit frayed as I prepared to testify in a murder trial in a\ncity far from my own. Days on end of reviewing the same crime, over and over.\nReviewing the timeline and understanding the geography.\n\nHeartbreaking for the victim\u2019s family and the accused\u2014generations of domestic\nviolence, trauma and substance abuse.\n\nIn a different place and time, with layers of privilege and opportunity, this\nstory could easily parallel my own. As a straight, white male, my path has\noften been cushioned solely by these pieces of my identity rather than any\ninherent merit or luck. Remove these layers; statistically, the outlook would\nlikely be drastically different\u2014perhaps dire.\n\nI was also currently trying to ignore the fact that the events leading up to\nthe murder occurred just up the street and around the bend from where I was\nstaying. Places I drove past every day in my growing kaleidoscope of local\nUbers. Places I peered at furtively, the odd emotional connection between\ncrime scene photographs and the living world.\n\nThe trap beat car slowed.\n\nI could hear the rapid ticking of the hi-hat through their high-end speakers.\n\nNice. A very tasty trap beat, indeed.\n\nI pulled on my guilty-travel-pleasure, a Marlboro menthol. I reminded myself\nthat this is precisely why an \u201cimported\u201d expert needs to stay in the community\nin which they intend to testify. It gives you a different perspective to know\nthat your door can be blown off its hinges, just like in the case you\u2019re\nreading, rather than being safely locked in a hotel on the 10th floor with\nsecurity and police nearby.\n\nNo scooting out of town on the first flight for this guy.\n\nI don\u2019t think other experts should do it either.\n\nI try to imagine what it\u2019s like for a community member or family member who\nhas to do this every day of their life. Testify, then live under a dark cloud\nof fear.\n\nThis is \u201cmethod empathy\u201d in my books, not an adrenaline-seeking activity. Go\nout and feel the vulnerability of the community, or stay the fuck home and\nwrite fiction instead. But don\u2019t half-ass it in between.\n\nTrap beat.\n\nThe car continued with no incident, followed almost humorously close by an\nelderly couple walking an even more elderly dog. The trio stopped to say hello\nand ask\u2014\n\n\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\n\nThat question could also prove deadly for the uneducated in a different\nneighbourhood at a different time.\n\nNot so with these three as they waved merrily and ambled on down the tree-\nlined street that could have passed for the one I live on in Saskatoon,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nI sighed and flipped my laptop open, heading to LinkedIn to try to make\ncontact with a fellow Bullshit Hunter about the new, old junk science\u2014the\nreason I was on this trip with my frayed nerves and quickly disappearing\nMarlboro menthols.\n\nDigital forensics.\n\nThe new, old, not-even-junk, junk science.\n\n##\n\nData is Transferred. Trust is Not.\n\nIn the cybersecurity world, there are frameworks, quadrants and acronyms so\nlong it would make your Mom blush if she saw them unshaven in a Polaroid.\nHowever, amongst the alphabet soup, one core principle is easy to understand\nas it relates to most2 criminal or civil investigations involving digital\nevidence.\n\nTrust.\n\nA very simple but often misunderstood concept. So, let\u2019s go on a journey\ntogether with a fictional character in a fictional but relatable circumstance.\n\nWe have a guy named Dave. No, not our Dave. Never our Dave.\n\nThis Dave is a real asshole and loves to commit his crimes at work; in\nparticular, he loves to stalk people using throwaway social media accounts,\nyank old passwords he finds on hacker websites to login to his coworker's\nsocial media and has a penchant for using his work phone and email server to\nsend inappropriate missives and memes to colleagues and external parties.\n\nHe's also got a weird growth on his butt, and he likes to show it to people on\nvarious messaging apps non-consensually.\n\nHe's one of those Daves.\n\nThrough internal complaints and a human resources investigation, it's\ndetermined that Dave must be suspended while an investigation is performed to\nfind out what the hell is going on.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say Dave has two devices: an iOS phone and a desktop Windows\ncomputer.\n\nIt really, truly, doesn\u2019t fucking matter what these devices are. Call them a\nBlackberry and a TRS-80. Capich\u00e8? Don\u2019t get hung up on the details,\nforensicators.\n\nDave has two primary services he used for his crimes: his work email account\nand Facebook.\n\nNow, from the trust perspective, let's look at this nifty diagram.\n\nBullsh*t Hunting is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and\nsupport my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSo you may be wondering: Wait a second. Why are Dave's corporate phone and\ndesktop considered untrusted? Aren't these ultra-secure, corporate-owned, and\nmanaged devices? Don't we have a chain of custody and physical control over\nthem?\n\nYou can trust us, right?\n\nWell, the thing is that Dave has put his sweaty, grubby paws all over those\ndevices, and you have to assume that Dave has compromised, tainted, spoiled or\notherwise fucked with the evidence, intentionally or otherwise.\n\nIf Dave's phone was a traditional murder scene, imagine his friends first\nusing it as a skateboard park before your CSI team gets there.\n\nHow much could you trust the validity of the physical evidence after that? Is\nit completely ruined (I would argue it isn't), or does it simply need to be\nrigorously tested, sampled, and validated against other sources? You know,\nscience things.\n\nThat's also why physical crime scenes are protected and guarded (with humans\nthat have bullets and shit) to preserve their integrity. If someone messes\nwith the scene or otherwise breaks the chain of custody, that's a problem.\n\nNow, back to Dirty Dave.\n\nYou see, Dave is the master of those devices, regardless of the fancy tools\ninstalled by his IT administrator or security team. If Dave can access them\nand operate them freely? He's the queen. Queen Dirty Dave.\n\nThus? You can't trust the devices because you can never trust Dave. You have\nto verify every single statement and piece of evidence that Dave could have\ngenerated because Dave is greasier than goose shit. That's why we're all here\ntoday, after all.\n\nYou can't trust what he says, what his computer says, what his Blackberry\nsays, or anything else he touches or does, really. He probably doesn't wash\nhis hands.\n\nSo if the digital forensics performed on Dave's desktop computer shows that he\nsent an email with the subject line of \"Justin is a Dickhead,\" dated June 1,\n2023, 12:00:00, what do you actually know to be true at this point?\n\nYou know that his device generated forensic artifacts indicating that he sent\nan email at that time.\n\nWhat you do not know is whether Dave sent it or not.\n\nOr whether an email was sent at all.\n\nLet's continue.\n\n##\n\nPlacing the Person at the Keyboard\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t me!\u201d - Shaggy, in an ode to Eddie Murphy.\n\nNumerous times, numerous crimes. We've heard the story repeatedly\u2014something\nhappened on a computer that was illegal, and the owner says it wasn't them.\n\nIt was their dog, their pervert cousin, someone else who had their Wifi\npassword, a poltergeist, their weird neighbour or any other living or non-\nliving entity that could cast doubt on them being the perpetrator,\nparticularly with Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) investigations, where the\nmere possession of the material is illegal.\n\nIn our Queen Dirty Dave case, the first thing you need to do is establish who\nwas in care and control of that device at the time of the alleged \"Dickhead\nEmail.\" You should make sure you can put them there with eyewitness testimony,\nsecurity card swipe logs, CCTV footage, login events, firewall, weblogs, etc.\nCorrelate, corroborate.\n\nYou know.\n\nInvestigative shit.\n\nThis is now validating and verifying that you have a source of untrusted data\ngenerated by Dave. It places him at a device at a certain time and leaves\nforensic evidence (called artifacts, like in archaeology) on those devices.\nThe more you can correlate that he was the one either physically or remotely\noperating that device, within reason, the better.\n\nWe still need to find out whether Dave actually sent a single email, logged\ninto a Facebook account, or really much of anything beyond the untrusted\nevidence we have from his devices.\n\nWe know Dave was there, doing stuff on those devices, at a certain time.\n\nSo now we need to close this loop.\n\n##\n\nClosing the Loop\n\nWhat we're now faced with is an investigative open loop.\n\nWe've got a lot of good theories and even some forensic evidence that Dave is\nup to no good. We even have fancy file hashes, some reports from expensive\nforensic tools and possess more pictures of Dave's ass than we could have ever\nwanted or needed.\n\nIt's a mole, not a wart, by the way. We checked.\n\nWhat we don't have is a fully closed loop proving that Dave did what he is\nalleged to have done: sent some emails and fucked around on Facebook.\n\nQuite simply\u2014and this is identical in the journalism and intelligence world\u2014we\nhave to verify this against a trusted source.\n\nWe cannot simply change untrusted data into trusted data, like some data Jedi\nwaving our hand over it and willing it to be so. What we can do is take\ntrusted data (from the email server and Facebook), correlate it with the\nuntrusted data and then try to pin it to the human in the chair operating the\ndevices.\n\nWhere this scenario can change is if Dave was the administrator or owner of\nthe email server. We now have to adjust that zone of trust to exclude the\nemail server, and of course, as an investigator, it is up to you to find other\nsources of trusted data to correlate against now that he\u2019s dirtied this one\nup.\n\nRemember, if Queen Dirty Dave controls, administrates or has access to it,\nit's not trusted.\n\nBy retrieving the logs from the email server, filing subpoenas with Facebook\n(or warrants), and then correlating those trusted sources against the\nuntrusted digital forensics and witness interviews, we bring the untrusted\ntogether with the trusted and match them to help show that an action, taken by\na human, with a digital device, was most critically: recorded externally by a\nsource outside of our control and outside of Dave\u2019s control.\n\nThis is \u201cclosing the loop\u201d and forms the proper backbone of a digital\ninvestigation3.\n\nIt\u2019s been this way for decades4.\n\n##\n\nNo Closed Loops. No Justice.\n\nImagine you did a DNA swab of someone, got their profile back (only theirs)\nand pronounced: \"Yes. You are human, and I have your DNA. Thus, you committed\nthis crime!\"\n\nI would hope that you are staring blankly right now or laughing. But this is\nexactly what happens all the time with digital forensics and digital evidence\nwrit large.\n\nIn the case of DNA evidence, naturally, you need to take the DNA sample,\nexplain how you obtained it, how you had legal authorization to do so, and\nwhat test you used to extract it. Then, you need to compare it against a\ndatabase of other samples in order to authenticate it. For example, the sample\nat the crime scene, in a DNA database, or other sources that are outside of\nyour crime lab.\n\nThat\u2019s not what is happening with digital forensics in many jurisdictions.\nHalf the time an examiner can\u2019t explain how they got into a device to begin\nwith5 nor can they explain how any of the blackbox algorithms or \u2018carvers\u2019 do\nwhat they do. Do they need to? I guess it depends. Case by case, as the saying\ngoes.\n\nHowever, in criminal and civil cases, both prosecution and defence\nforensicators, investigators and attorneys are presenting half of the digital\nevidence and convincing judges and juries that this is somehow different than\nswabbing someone\u2019s cheek, shooting a three point garbage-shot with a Q-tip and\ndeclaring the person is the killer.\n\nI have witnessed and reviewed cases where folks go into court and show digital\nforensics acquisitions, asserting that a plaintiff or defendant did or did not\ndo something, never presenting correlating, trusted evidence to back it up.\nThere are convictions based on that, too.\n\nJudges, lawyers and jurors, not possessing a computer science background\n(generally), have no idea that they are being fed bullshit. I am sure they\nwould truly care if it was a loved one who was about to spend the rest of\ntheir life in prison. I bet they'd get educated really quickly. I bet they\nwould be a bit more skeptical.\n\nWorse, often there are these long-winded arguments or bullshit Daubert\nhearings that focus on Faraday bags (sure they are important) and SQLite\ntimestamps (also important, sure) instead of solid forensic investigation,\nverification and validation. Context is important.\n\nYou know. The work. A phone that's not in a Faraday bag is just as useless as\none that is inside a Faraday bag if you never file a warrant to validate\nanything that's on it. You dig? Why are we even arguing about IOS timestamps\nand modification times when they aren't even being matched to an external\nsource anyway?\n\nMight as well make shit up.\n\nI could care less what the timestamp on a SQLite database file says on Queen\nDirty Dave's phone when Facebook's billion-dollar security infrastructure\ntells me down to the millisecond whether he logged on from a particular device\nand location and took action or not. If I can match that up to dirty,\nuntrusted data that Dave controlled, I can close the loop on both ends.\n\nAn answer that doesn\u2019t involve a black box, lying witnesses or eye-watering\nexpert fees. No special dongles. No adapters. No AFU, DFU or GO-EFF-U.\n\nArguing over these tiny semantics permits clouding of the real, evidentiary\nand most crucial arguments in many cases. Preliminary hearings and expert\ncertifications become a war of attrition: who\u2019s going to run out of will and\ncaffeine first?\n\nI am certain this is not how any of this should be done.\n\nThe next time you're preparing for trial, a hearing, or any other legal\nmatter, and someone presents you with forensic acquisitions or digital\nevidence that have no correlating data (warrant returns, subpoena returns, log\nfiles, corresponding digital acquisitions, etc.), make sure you call bullshit\non them early and often. Cry from the rooftops.\n\nDon't let it into our courtrooms, don't let our forensicators down, defend the\nscience.\n\nDon't put innocent people in jail with bullshit when you have the opportunity\nto quickly and easily close the loop with some paperwork and a handful of\nspreadsheets.\n\n##\n\nEpilogue\n\nSlow-driving cars with trap beats. Travel fatigue. Days of relentless\nfourteen-hour shifts in trial preparation, with more to go.\n\nBone-weary, I laid my head down to sleep and closed my eyes. Drifting off to\nBrooklyn 99 softly playing on the smart TV tucked into the corner of the room\nbefore the sleep timer puts Peralta, Santiago and the 99 crew to bed too.\n\nThe screaming of a car horn, inches from my feet outside my window, in the\ndead of night flung me awake. I don\u2019t know how long I was asleep, but there\nwas no more Andy Samberg, no more Joe Lo Truglio.\n\nHoly fuck, they\u2019re back.\n\nThe trap beat.\n\nI get my bearings in the dark, knowing it\u2019s important to listen and orient\nbefore acting.\n\nI\u2019m waiting for the footsteps up the front porch and the inevitable crash as a\nboot clears it from its hinges.\n\nThe car horn is screaming continuously. It\u2019s clearly intentional.\n\nI may have bit off more than I could chew on this case. Fuck.\n\nNo footsteps yet. Time to start moving.\n\nI pull back the covers and swing my legs off the side of the bed.\n\nThen it stops. The last of the horn blasts softly, echoing away.\n\nMy ears are trained both on the window and the front porch simultaneously.\n\nNo footsteps.\n\nNo door crash.\n\nAnd then\u2014soft giggles of an elderly couple emanate only a few inches away from\nwhere I am perched at the edge of the bed.\n\nMiss Neighbour leaned on the horn when she was helping her aging frame from\nher Prius.\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t so nice, I\u2019d ask her to do my newly soiled laundry for\nrepayment.\n\nSo much for sleep.\n\nShit the bed indeed.\n\n1\n\nWe recommended this book in Issue #23 of Weekend Warriors, Weirdos &\nWhackjobs:\n\nhttps://www.bullshithunting.com/p/for-the-weekend-warriors-weirdos-2f3\n\n2\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning, and we will repeatedly, that Child Sexual Abuse\nMaterial (CSAM) investigations are the outlier here, simply because the mere\npossession of the material (it is found on your phone, tablet or computer) is\na crime.\n\n3\n\nThis works in both directions. If there are allegations that something\nhappened on a server, you need to then work the opposite direction to find the\ndevices, acquire artifacts in a forensically sound manner and then match them\nto the server.\n\n4\n\nForensics Casefile: Catching the BTK Killer.\nhttps://www.forensicscolleges.com/blog/forensics-casefile-btk-strangler\n\n5\n\nThis is through no fault of the examiner themselves, rather, it is the\nforensic software manufacturer who doesn\u2019t want to disclose \u201cprotected\ntechniques\u201d, a commonly referred term used in law enforcement. Fair enough, I\nused to develop exploits. I get it, to a degree.\n\n### Subscribe to Bullsh*t Hunting\n\nLaunched 6 months ago\n\nThe mailing list for journalists, activists, hackers, investigators, short-\nsellers and skeptics alike.
