The idea is to use lasers to generate plasma in water\nand then use the detonation wave formed by plasma expansion for propulsion.\n\nLittle progress was made as the scientists found it impossible to generate a\ndriving force in a specific direction, because of the way the detonation wave\nspreads from a single point in all directions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA number of countries, including China, funded extensive follow-up research,\nwith one promising approach involving loading the force of the detonation wave\non to tiny spherical particles made of metal or other materials.\n\nWhen these particles, known as working media, leave at high speed in a\nspecific direction, they exert an opposite force on the submarine, according\nto Newton\u2019s law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, until now, all efforts have resulted in very low efficiency, with 1\nwatt of laser power generating only one millionth of a newton of thrust, which\nhas no practical application value.\n\nGe and his team said they have solved the problem, designing a laser engine\nthat improves the efficiency of converting lasers into thrust by three to four\norders of magnitude.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContrary to the general view of the global research community that adding\nconstraining devices would cause significant energy loss, the Chinese\nscientists added a device similar to a gun barrel to the ends of the fibres.\n\nAccording to the paper, the researchers solved the problem of energy loss by\nadjusting the shape and internal structure of the barrel, smoothing the\nbarrel-fibre interface into a U-shape.\n\nThey also used a pair of barrels to bombard the working medium particles and\nadded carefully designed protruding structures inside the barrel to reduce the\ninteraction and internal friction between shock waves, the paper said.\n\n01:33\n\nInside China\u2019s military\n\nInside China\u2019s military\n\nSome of the technologies behind the breakthrough originated in the aerospace\ndefence field, where China has developed advanced plasma electric propulsion\nengines as part of its significant investment in hypersonic weapons research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the paper, this field of research, involving the physical\nmechanisms of detonation shock waves and propulsion media, provided valuable\ninsights for the design and manufacture of underwater laser propellers.\n\nWhile a nuclear reactor on a submarine generates more than 150 megawatts of\nthermal power \u2013 enough for the laser propulsion system \u2013 there are still many\nchallenges to overcome before the technology can be applied to nuclear\nsubmarines, the team said.\n\nThese include heat dissipation of the optical fibres, durability in high-power\nand high-salinity environments, as well as matching optical fibre emission\nwindows with the submarine\u2019s surface anechoic tiles.\n\n02:06\n\nChinese hypersonic weapons test \u2018has all of our attention\u2019, US General Mark\nMilley says\n\nChinese hypersonic weapons test \u2018has all of our attention\u2019, US General Mark\nMilley says\n\nThe technology would also require significant changes to submarine steering\nand surfacing control methods, according to the paper.\n\nThe researchers said that despite these challenges, this disruptive technology\naligns with the current global shift from mechanical transmission to pure\nelectric propulsion in the new industrial revolution.\n\nIn addition to potential military applications, underwater laser propulsion\ncould also be applied to improve the efficiency of civilian ships and achieve\n\u201cgreen shipping\u201d, Ge\u2019s team said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListen\n\n3\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe use cookies to tailor your experience and present relevant ads.
