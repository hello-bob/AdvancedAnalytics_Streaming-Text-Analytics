Many countries have now eliminated the disease, and our generation\nhas the chance to eradicate it entirely.\n\nBy: Max Roser\n\nFebruary 19, 2024\n\nCite this articleReuse our work freely\n\nPolio is an infectious disease that affects children in particularly terrible\nways. Once the poliovirus invades the nervous system, it can cause\nirreversible paralysis in a matter of hours. As a consequence, many affected\nchildren suffered from permanent disability of the muscles in their legs. In\nthe worst cases, it affects the muscles a child uses to breathe, which means\nthat the child suffocates and dies.\n\nTo prevent them from dying of suffocation, polio victims were once placed into\nlarge mechanical breathing apparatuses called iron lungs. The iron lung was\nboth a lifeline and a life sentence for those permanently paralyzed by the\nvirus, as they would have to remain inside the metal box for years.\n\nChildren are still suffering from polio today, but the disease is much rarer\nthan it once was. In this short article, I want to show how far the world has\ncome in our battle against polio, and I want to show that we today have the\nopportunity to end polio once and for all. This \u2014 the global eradication of\npolio \u2014 would surely rank among humanity\u2019s greatest achievements.\n\nA hospital room in the US with patients in iron lungs in 1952^1\n\n## Just a generation ago, polio was spreading fear around the world\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, many cities around the world suffered\nthrough horrible epidemics of polio. The disease can spread through\ncontaminated food and water, especially in places with poor sanitation and\nhygiene. To turn the tide, scientists worked tirelessly on a vaccine.\n\nIt was Jonas Salk who developed the first successful polio vaccine \u2014 the\ninactivated poliovirus vaccine. The development of a working vaccine was\nannounced on 12 April 1955. It was celebrated as \u201cmore than a scientific\nachievement,\u201d according to Salk\u2019s biographer Richard Carter.^2 \u201cPeople\nobserved moments of silence, rang bells, honked horns, blew factory whistles,\nfired salutes.\u201d The vaccine \u201cwas a folk victory, an occasion for pride and\njubilation.\u201d\n\nThese celebrations were not misplaced. Another vaccine \u2014 the oral poliovirus\nvaccine \u2014 was developed by Albert Sabin soon afterward, and both vaccines made\nit possible to end the terrible epidemics of the past. By 1979, wild\npoliovirus was entirely eliminated from the US.^3 Millions of children who\nwould otherwise have been paralyzed instead lived healthy lives.\n\nAlthough the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) was easy to provide at scale\nbecause it was given as liquid drops, it had the problem that the altered live\npoliovirus used within it could mutate and, in rare cases, could regain its\nability to attack the central nervous system. Since 2020, the world has also\nhad new effective vaccines called novel Oral Poliovirus Vaccines (nOPV), which\ncan be used to prevent cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus.\n\nThe big chart shows how far the world has come in its fight against polio.^4\nAs recently as the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide became\nparalyzed by the virus every year. Since then, the efforts against polio have\nbeen successful in more and more regions of the world, and the spread of the\nvirus has been contained greatly, as the chart shows.\n\nThis global reduction of paralytic polio cases is only part of the success.\nThere were previously three different serotypes of wild poliovirus, and\nimmunity to one serotype does not confer immunity to the others. Two of them\nwere eradicated in the last decade:\n\n  * The last case of wild poliovirus serotype 2 was seen in 1999 in India. It was declared globally eradicated by the WHO in 2015.\n  * The last case of wild poliovirus serotype 3 was seen in 2012 in Nigeria and declared eradicated in 2019.\n\nThe maps below the chart show how polio was eliminated in more and more\ncountries. Back in 1980, polio was still endemic in 147 countries around the\nworld. By 2000, North and South America were certified to be polio-free.\nTwenty years later, most regions in the world are certified to be free of\npolio.\n\nParalytic polio cases since 1980, by world region^4\n\n## A global vaccination campaign made this success possible\n\nThe chart shows how this was possible.^5 Back in 1980, only 1 out of 5 of the\nworld\u2019s infants got vaccinated. By now, that ratio has flipped, and 1 out of 5\nare not vaccinated.\n\nPeople around the world \u2014 all of us \u2014 contributed to this global success.\nFirst, by ensuring our children get vaccinated. And second, because much of\nthe relevant work was paid for by public funds through our taxes.\n\n## For our generation today, polio eradication is within reach\n\nThe charts also show that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate\nagainst polio fell, and the number of cases increased.\n\nBut, despite the setback due to COVID, we are in a much better position than\nthe generations before us. As we\u2019ve seen in the three maps above, the disease\nhas been eliminated from most countries in the world. The last remaining wild\npoliovirus is only prevalent in two countries. Today, our generation has the\nchance to achieve one of the most ambitious goals humanity can possibly set\nfor itself, the global eradication of a disease.\n\nWe should not make the mistake of becoming complacent now that we\u2019ve come so\nfar. Going from low numbers to eradication is hard. It will depend on our\nefforts now to make this happen and eradicate polio once and for all.\n\nBut it is possible. The world has already eradicated one of the very worst\nhuman diseases: smallpox \u2014 a disease that is estimated to have killed at least\nhalf a billion people in the last 100 years of its existence \u2014 which was\neradicated in 1980.^6\n\nWe know what we need to end polio globally:\n\n  * Widespread access to the novel Oral Poliovirus Vaccines mentioned earlier, which don\u2019t carry the same risk of rare vaccine-derived poliovirus infections.\n  * Access to clean water and sanitation facilities for everyone.\n  * And good data, as my colleagues Saloni Dattani and Fiona Spooner emphasized in their article on the importance of testing and data in the fight against polio. Only by testing widely can we make sure to detect every last case of polio so that we can protect those around them.\n\nThe data in this article have shown how very far we have come. Now, let\u2019s\nbring this global project to an end and eradicate this disease for all\nchildren around the world and for all who come after us.\n\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank Saloni Dattani for her helpful comments\non this essay and the visualization.\n\nExplore more research and data on Our World in Data:\n\n  * Our page on this topic: ourworldindata.org/polio\n  * And we have a page on the disease that humanity has already eradicated: ourworldindata.org/smallpox\n\n### Endnotes\n\n  1.
