So, we expect an AI web builder to have:\n\n  * Rich layout. We love creative compositions, not generic-looking.\n  * Ability to change parts, still with AI, without recreating the whole.\n  * Contextual content. The generated content highlights the detailed aspects of the fields and avoids marketing jargon.\n  * Conceptual images. Avoiding typical dramatic AI-generated photos that will not fit the purpose.\n  * More below...\n\nWith this checklist as our guide, we've developed our own AI web builder, and\nnow it is ready for use.\n\nAn example of Interior Designer/Studio web page.\n\nWhile most AI web builders are hosted services, we made our AI web builder\navailable as a JavaScript library, enabling a wide range of usage\npossibilities by developers - for their clients' projects or SaaS platforms.\n\nSome features below.\n\n### Rich Layout\n\nWith PageStudioAI.js, we can test each section with various different layouts.\nThe headline text will switch between short or long versions, fitting into\nvarious placements in different layouts, automatically! This unique feature\nmay still not be found anywhere else.\n\nThe layouts are also not generic-looking. Layout means a composition, visual\nlanguages that engage viewers. This is our priority.\n\n### Example: One Section, Multiple Layouts\n\n### Example 2: One Section, Multiple Layouts\n\n### Contextual Content\n\nThe generated website content will also aim to avoid marketing clich\u00e9s that\ncould dilute the message. Instead, it will highlight the philosophical\nconcepts as well as technical aspects of the products/services being offered,\nregardless of the limited information that may be provided in the Generate\nform.\n\nWhen generating a website for UI/UX designers, for example, the content will\nreflect the field, highlighting details such as wireframing, user personas,\nand the overall workflow that creates a good portfolio for a UI/UX designer.\n\nThe built-in Generate form. Note that PageStudioAI.js also supports custom\ndesigned form.\n\n### Ability to Fix or Regenerate Specific Section\n\nInstead of recreating the whole from scratch, we can request AI to rewrite\nspecific sections or just click \"Rewrite Content\" to get different results\nmultiple times.\n\n### One Click Shading Adjustment\n\nWhen working with text over an image, contrast adjustment is often necessary.\nInstead of manually setting the text color and background overlay, the One-\nClick shading adjustment allows us to try different options for enhancing text\ncontrast over an image.\n\n### Not Typical AI-Images\n\nWe're referring to the conceptual style of images, focusing on one main\nsubject with natural color rendering. The generated images should look\nsuitable for the cover of art or lifestyle magazines.\n\nSample generated image.\n\n### One Click to Regenerate Specific Image\n\nJust click on an image and regenerate image button is ready whenever we want\nto change specific image.\n\nRegenerate image\n\n### More Features:\n\n  * Layout Selection\n  * Typography Style Selection\n  * Export to Edit using ContentBox.js page builder.\n  * Export for Download\n\nOne click to export and edit with ContentBox.js\n\n## Download\n\nJust Released: ver.1.1.\n\nUnlike most AI web builders, which are typically hosted services, we made our\nAI web builder available for download, as a JavaScript library. This means\nmore flexibility.\n\nPageStudioAI.js requires API Keys that you can get from: OpenAI (for content\ngeneration) and Getimg.ai (for image generation). Examples are provided in\nHTML with Node.js and PHP. Since it's JavaScript (runs on the client), the\nserver environment can vary. You can use it with Next.js, Laravel backend,\netc.\n\nWe developed PageStudioAI.js with developers in mind, those who provide\nsolutions to their clients. We love empowering developers with great tools, so\nPageStudioAI.js is available now for use by agencies or SaaS builders for\ntheir projects.\n\nWith the initial release, we're offering a limited-time discount, which will\nend soon after the v.1.1 release.\n\n### Super (Source Code) License:\n\n  * Unlimited websites or clients' projects.\n  * License for SaaS with unlimited users: Yes.
