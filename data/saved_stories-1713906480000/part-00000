On the Writerly Balance Between Money and Time\n\n## For Novelist Ryan Chapman, \u201cThere are wants, and there are needs.\u201d\n\nBy Ryan Chapman\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nThe following is the final installment of a six-part collaboration with Dirt\nabout \u201cThe Myth of the Middle Class\u201d writer.\n\n______________________\n\nAs a former Catholic, I was raised to avoid public discussions of both money\nand oneself. Pride goeth before the fall, etc. As an American, money\u2019s all I\nthink about. Especially other people\u2019s money, the real national pastime. It\u2019s\nwhy you\u2019re reading this now.\n\nIn my midwestern youth the notion of the artist\u2019s life was imported from the\ncoasts and often dinged up in transit: the pop L.A. cynicism of Bret Easton\nEllis\u2019s Less Than Zero and the novels of Bruce Wagner; the YOLO thrills of\nDead Poets Society and On the Road. I still remember reading Kerouac\u2019s \u201cmad\nones... desirous of everything at the same time\u201d on a shift break at my summer\ngig as a country-club towel boy. It created a reservoir of fuck it! spirit\nthat, since I was saving for tuition, had to be parsimoniously disbursed until\nI\u2019d achieved some measure of adult stability. The irony wasn\u2019t lost on me\nthen, either.\n\nEven F. Scott Fitzgerald, the golden boy of St. Paul, left for Princeton, then\nNew York, Europe, and California. When I read him in ninth grade\u2014\u201cWinter\nDreams\u201d is spot-on about country clubs\u2014my teacher felt compelled to mention\nthe novelist died penniless.\n\nSo: creative pursuit equaled financial precarity and possible ruin.\nTransgression, too. I read Irvine Welsh\u2019s Trainspotting, then asked my aunt to\ndrive us to Minneapolis\u2019s indie theater to catch its film adaptation. (Yes, it\nwas awkward; no, we don\u2019t talk about it.) My reverence for literature was like\nJohn Cusack\u2019s intimate fandom in High Fidelity. Michael Ondaatje was my\nRadiohead. (Radiohead was also my Radiohead.) This was as it should be. I\nwanted to be a writer in the way kids want to be astronauts.\n\nAs an American, money\u2019s all I think about. Especially other people\u2019s money,\nthe real national pastime.\n\nBut there are wants, and there are needs. A period of economic chutes and\nladders hardened my family\u2019s pragmatism. And as a first-born American on my\nfather\u2019s side, there was the immigrant\u2019s emphasis on work ethic, education,\nand striving for middle-class station. And yet. Adversity\u2019s inevitable. The\nfrictionless life, rare and boring. Francis Bacon wrote, \u201cThe best that can be\nsaid of fortune is that, as she uses no choice in her favors, so she does not\ncare to uphold them.\u201d\n\n*\n\nThree anecdotes.\n\nIn 2013 the novelist and short-story writer Karen Russell needed an emergency\nroot canal, and she didn\u2019t have dental insurance. As she told The Washington\nPost, \u201cThis was a bill that would have sunk me into a depression.\u201d By a stroke\nof luck, Russell was informed that week she was the recipient of a MacArthur\n\u201cGenius\u201d Grant, totaling $625,000.\n\nDonald Antrim also received a MacArthur that year. In a congratulatory note,\nhis friend Jonathan Franzen joked Antrim finally had the means to afford his\ntaste in clothes. (#relatable)\n\nBetween 2002 and 2008 I worked as a busboy, campus tour guide, janitor, and\nmedical guinea pig. Upon graduation I found employment with a tech company\nthat produced secondary-school curricula; my purview was French comprehension\nand English Lit. In one twelve-month period I lived on the same $36k salary in\nSeattle, Prague, and Manhattan. A night out cost, respectively, $50, $16, and\n$100\u2014an arbitraged debauch.\n\n*\n\nThen I turned 30. I\u2019d met the woman whom I\u2019d eventually marry. (Thankfully,\nshe\u2019s much better with money.) I had a salaried position in publishing and a\nsomewhat affordable apartment in Gowanus. In the hours before work, I\u2019d noodle\naround with a novel manuscript, spending years rewriting the same 35,000\nwords. A personal hobby more than any kind of professional aspiration, and\npart of my lightly transgressive streak. It was fun working on what I thought\nwas an unpublishable book before hopping on the F train to plan marketing\ncampaigns for the new Jeffrey Eugenides.\n\nAround this time I read Daniel Kahneman\u2019s Thinking, Fast and Slow. The Nobel\nlaureate\u2019s dense encapsulation of his work in behavioral psychology, much of\nit in partnership with the late Amos Tversky, relentlessly questioned the\nprecepts of its academic fields and life in general. When we talk about sunk-\ncost fallacies, recency bias, or affective forecasting, we\u2019re unconsciously\nciting Kahneman.\n\nThey found very unhappy people still tend to plateau. Everyone else correlates\nas you\u2019d expect.\n\nOne of his most influential findings asked whether a higher income did in fact\nmake one happier. Up to a point, Kahneman said; then it plateaus. You might\nget that raise but discover an $18 glass of wine isn\u2019t much different from the\n$14 option. (I\u2019m being reductive; nobody wants to hear a novelist talk\neconomics.)\n\nThis had the seductive logic of the contrarian. I started to rethink my own\ncorrelations between income and happiness. I stress started to. In truth it\nwould take about five years for Kahneman\u2019s idea to truly take hold, and for my\nown material conditions to allow me to embrace precarity.\n\nThere were long conversations with my partner about what we were getting out\nof New York. Was it time to roll the dice? If not now, when? We talked a lot\nabout risk tolerance. We auditioned Austin, New Orleans, both Portlands, then\nrealized we couldn\u2019t afford a house in any of them. We cast our net upstate\nand found Kingston.\n\nYou might get that raise but discover an $18 glass of wine isn\u2019t much\ndifferent from the $14 option.\n\nI worked two full-time jobs for six months to clear my debts and build up\nsavings. We got our house\u2014with the dumb luck of low interest rates\u2014and I spent\na year commuting to Brooklyn twice a week. (Three hours door to door. I don\u2019t\nmiss it.) Then I went freelance and, for a period I euphemistically refer to\nas my investment years, cut my annual income in half. I\u2019d never been happier.\nWhen nervous relatives questioned our decision, I\u2019d refer to the Kahneman\nstudy, forwarding YouTube clips like an asshole.\n\nKahneman passed away in March. Among the obits and encomia was an aside about\nthat income and happiness study. Turns out a flaw in the methodology had\ncreated specious data. Kahneman later revised the study in collaboration with\nMatthew Killingsworth. They found very unhappy people still tend to plateau.\nEveryone else correlates as you\u2019d expect.\n\nI was heartened to learn how wrong I\u2019d been. That novelty, as an atheist, of\nfinding a bedrock error in such a longstanding belief. Call it progress. I\u2019ll\ndiscard the belief. Apologize to the relevant family members.\n\nMy risk tolerance is still high and under constant renegotiation. There are\none-year plans and loose five-year plans. I\u2019m never well-off, but I\u2019m\nresilient. I flatter myself into believing my kneejerk empiricism keeps the\ntransgressive habits in check.\n\nA month ago we streamed Trainspotting at home, our dog at our side. My wife\nthought an old favorite would distract from the publication anxiety around my\nsecond novel. We made the TikTok salmon bowl, dimmed the lights, and switched\nour phones to airplane mode. We knew to finish dinner before the \u201cWorst Toilet\nin Scotland\u201d scene.\n\n_________________________\n\nRyan Chapman\u2019s latest novel, The Audacity, is available now from Soho Press.\n\n###### Ryan Chapman\n\nRyan Chapman is the author of the novels The Audacity (Soho Press, 2024) and\nRiots I Have Known (Simon & Schuster, 2019).
