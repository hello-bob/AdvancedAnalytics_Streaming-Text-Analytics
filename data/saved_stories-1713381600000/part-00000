Google's John Mueller responded saying,\n\"People seem to really enjoy it.\"\n\nI will say, Nilay wrote a fun and enjoyable piece, you can read it here, if\nyou haven't already but I assume most of you have already seen it by now.\n\nIt ranks number two in Google Search for me in New York on all browsers I've\ntested:\n\nHe wrote:\n\n> It\u2019s been over a year since I last told you to just buy a Brother laser\n> printer, and that article has fallen down the list of Google search results\n> because I haven\u2019t spent my time loading it up with fake updates every so\n> often to gain the attention of the Google search robot.\n\nHe then rants about how \"an entire ecosystem of content farms seems motivated\nto constantly update articles about printers in response to the incentive\nstructure created by that robot\u2019s obvious preferences. Pointing out that\nincentive structure and the culture that\u2019s developed around it seems to make a\nlot of people mad, which is also interesting!\" Yep, the whole thing about how\nSEOs and Google ruined the internet...\n\nHe added, \"The Verge has published an article partially generated by AI,\nbecause after the buttons I am going to include a bunch of AI-generated copy\nfrom Google\u2019s Gemini in order to pad this thing out.\"\n\nThe article is then followed by a bunch of AI content generated by Gemini.\n\nI've been waiting to see a Googler who works on search respond to any of the\nSEO comments about this piece. And now we have it, John Mueller said, \"People\nseem to really enjoy it\" and he is not wrong.\n\n> People seem to really enjoy it.\n>\n> \u2014 John \ud83e\uddc0 ... \ud83e\uddc0 (@JohnMu) April 13, 2024\n\nThey also spoke about this on their podcast at 27:45 into it:\n\nForum discussion at X.\n\nCopied!\n\n## Popular Categories\n\n  * Google\n  * Bing\n  * Algorithm Updates\n  * Maps\n  * Ads\n\n## The Pulse of the search community\n\nFollow\n\nSubscribe Options\n\n## Search Video Recaps\n\nVideo Details More Videos Subscribe to Videos\n\n## Most Recent Articles\n\nSearch Forum Recap\n\n## Daily Search Forum Recap: April 16, 2024\n\nApr 16, 2024 - 4:00 pm\n\n0 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nGoogle Search Engine Optimization\n\n## Google Will Fight Site Reputation Abuse Spam Both With Manual Actions &\nAlgorithms\n\nApr 16, 2024 - 7:51 am\n\n23 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nGoogle\n\n## Google Search Tests Thumbs Up/Down Buttons In Product Grid Results\n\nApr 16, 2024 - 7:41 am\n\n2 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nGoogle Ads\n\n## Google Ads \"Similar Product\" Carousel\n\nApr 16, 2024 - 7:31 am\n\n0 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nGoogle Search Engine Optimization\n\n## Clarification: Google Search Supports Images Referenced From src Attribute\n\nApr 16, 2024 - 7:21 am\n\n0 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nGoogle AdSense\n\n## Google AdSense New Ad Intents Formats - Links & Anchors In Content\n\nApr 16, 2024 - 7:11 am\n\n0 - by Barry Schwartz\n\nPrevious Story: Google Threatens California: Tests Removing Links To\nPublishers & Pauses Investments\n\nNext Story: Google Goes On Defensive On Its Search Quality & Forum Results\nStatements\n\n  * Submit a Thread\n  * Forum Search\n  * Awards\n  * About Us\n  * Comments Policy\n  * Advertise\n  * Contact\n\nThe content at the Search Engine Roundtable are the sole opinion of the\nauthors and in no way reflect views of RustyBrick \u00ae, Inc Copyright \u00a9 1994-2024\nRustyBrick \u00ae, Inc.
