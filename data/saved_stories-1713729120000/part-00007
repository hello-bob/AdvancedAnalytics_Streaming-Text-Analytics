It is designed to provide\nstrong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key\ncryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is available from the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is available in many\ncommercial products as well.\n\nThe Internet is an insecure place. Many of the protocols used in the Internet\ndo not provide any security. Tools to \"sniff\" passwords off of the network are\nin common use by malicious hackers. Thus, applications which send an\nunencrypted password over the network are extremely vulnerable. Worse yet,\nother client/server applications rely on the client program to be \"honest\"\nabout the identity of the user who is using it. Other applications rely on the\nclient to restrict its activities to those which it is allowed to do, with no\nother enforcement by the server.\n\nSome sites attempt to use firewalls to solve their network security problems.\nUnfortunately, firewalls assume that \"the bad guys\" are on the outside, which\nis often a very bad assumption. Most of the really damaging incidents of\ncomputer crime are carried out by insiders. Firewalls also have a significant\ndisadvantage in that they restrict how your users can use the Internet. (After\nall, firewalls are simply a less extreme example of the dictum that there is\nnothing more secure than a computer which is not connected to the network ---\nand powered off!) In many places, these restrictions are simply unrealistic\nand unacceptable.\n\nKerberos was created by MIT as a solution to these network security problems.\nThe Kerberos protocol uses strong cryptography so that a client can prove its\nidentity to a server (and vice versa) across an insecure network connection.\nAfter a client and server has used Kerberos to prove their identity, they can\nalso encrypt all of their communications to assure privacy and data integrity\nas they go about their business.\n\nKerberos is freely available from MIT, under copyright permissions very\nsimilar those used for the BSD operating system and the X Window System. MIT\nprovides Kerberos in source form so that anyone who wishes to use it may look\nover the code for themselves and assure themselves that the code is\ntrustworthy. In addition, for those who prefer to rely on a professionally\nsupported product, Kerberos is available as a product from many different\nvendors.\n\nIn summary, Kerberos is a solution to your network security problems. It\nprovides the tools of authentication and strong cryptography over the network\nto help you secure your information systems across your entire enterprise. We\nhope you find Kerberos as useful as it has been to us. At MIT, Kerberos has\nbeen invaluable to our Information/Technology architecture.\n\n$Id: index.html,v 1.261 2023/08/16 01:41:40 ghudson Exp $\n\nAll images and text on this page are copyright MIT.\n\nMIT Kerberos [ home ] [ contact ]\n\n", "frontpage": false}
