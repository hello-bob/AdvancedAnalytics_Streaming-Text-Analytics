But that\u2019s not the case for the Yahoo Boys, a\nloose collective of young men in West Africa who are some of the web\u2019s most\nprolific\u2014and increasingly dangerous\u2014scammers.\n\nThousands of people are members of dozens of Yahoo Boy groups operating across\nFacebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram, a WIRED analysis has found. The scammers,\nwho deal in types of fraud that total hundreds of millions of dollars each\nyear, also have dozens of accounts on TikTok, YouTube, and the document-\nsharing service Scribd that are getting thousands of views.\n\nInside the groups, there\u2019s a hive of fraudulent activity with the\ncybercriminals often showing their faces and sharing ways to scam people with\nother members. They openly distribute scripts detailing how to blackmail\npeople and how to run sextortion scams\u2014that have driven people to take their\nown lives\u2014sell albums with hundreds of photographs, and advertise fake social\nmedia accounts. Among the scams, they\u2019re also using AI to create fake \u201cnude\u201d\nimages of people and real-time deepfake video calls.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nThe Yahoo Boys don\u2019t disguise their activity. Many groups use \u201cYahoo Boys\u201d in\ntheir name as well as other related terms. WIRED\u2019s analysis found 16 Yahoo\nBoys Facebook groups with almost 200,000 total members, a dozen WhatsApp\nchannels, around 10 Telegram channels, 20 TikTok accounts, a dozen YouTube\naccounts, and more than 80 scripts on Scribd. And that\u2019s just the tip of the\niceberg.\n\nBroadly, the companies do not allow content on their platforms that encourages\nor promotes criminal behavior. The majority of the Yahoo Boys accounts and\ngroups WIRED identified were removed after we contacted the companies about\nthe groups\u2019 overt existence. Despite these removals, dozens more Yahoo Boys\ngroups and accounts remain online.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not hiding under different names,\u201d says Kathy Waters, the cofounder\nand executive director of the nonprofit Advocating Against Romance Scammers,\nwhich has tracked the Yahoo Boys for years. Waters says the social media\ncompanies are essentially providing the Yahoo Boys with \u201cfree office space\u201d to\norganize and conduct their activities. \u201cThey\u2019re selling scripts, selling\nphotos, identifications of people, all online, all on the social media\nplatforms,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy these accounts still remain is beyond me.\u201d\n\nThe Yahoo Boys aren\u2019t a single, organized group. Instead, they\u2019re a collection\nof thousands of scammers who work individually or in clusters. Often based in\nNigeria, their name comes from formerly targeting users of Yahoo services,\nwith links back to the Nigerian Prince email scams of old. Groups in West\nAfrica can be often organized in various confraternities, which are cultish\ngangs.\n\n\u201cYahoo is a set of knowledge that allows you to conduct scams,\u201d says Gary\nWarner, the director of intelligence at DarkTower and director of the\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s Computer Forensics Research Laboratory.\nWhile there are different levels of sophistication of Yahoo Boys, Warner says,\nmany simply operate from their phones. \u201cMost of these threat actors are only\nusing one device,\u201d he says.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

When making contact with potential victims, they\u2019ll often \u201cbomb\u201d\npeople by sending hundreds of messages to dating app accounts or Facebook\nprofiles. \u201cThey will say anything they can in order to get the next dime in\ntheir pocket,\u201d Waters says.\n\nSearching for the Yahoo Boys on Facebook brings up two warnings: Both say the\nresults may be linked to fraudulent activity, which isn\u2019t allowed on the\nwebsite. Clicking through the warnings reveals Yahoo Boy groups with thousands\nof members\u2014one had more than 70,000.\n\nWithin the groups\u2014alongside posts selling SIM cards and albums with hundreds\nof pictures\u2014many of the scammers push people toward other messaging platforms\nsuch as Meta\u2019s WhatsApp or Telegram. Here, the Yahoo Boys are at their most\nbold. Some groups and channels on the two platforms receive hundreds of posts\nper day and are part of their wider web of operations.\n\nAfter WIRED asked Facebook about the 16 groups we identified, the company\nremoved them, and some WhatsApp groups were deactivated. \u201cScammers use every\nplatform available to them to defraud people and constantly adapt to avoid\ngetting caught,\u201d says Al Tolan, a Meta spokesperson. They did not directly\naddress the accounts that were removed or that they were easy to find.\n\u201cPurposefully exploiting others for money is against our policies, and we take\naction when we become aware of it,\u201d Tolan says. \u201cWe continue to invest in\ntechnology and cooperate with law enforcement so they can prosecute scammers.\nWe also actively share tips on how people can protect themselves, their\naccounts, and avoid scams.\u201d\n\nGroups on Telegram were removed after WIRED messaged the company\u2019s press\noffice; however, the platform did not respond about why it had removed them.\n\nAcross all types of social media, Yahoo Boys scammers share \u201cscripts\u201d that\nthey use to socially manipulate people\u2014these can run to thousands of words\nlong and can be copied and pasted to different victims. Many have been online\nfor years. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some scripts that are 30 and 60 layers deep, before the\nscammer actually would have to go and think of something else to say,\u201d says\nRonnie Tokazowski, the chief fraud fighter at Intelligence for Good, which\nworks with cybercrime victims. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent how they'll manipulate the\npeople,\u201d Tokazowski says.\n\nAmong the many scams, they pretend to be military officers, people offering\n\u201chookups,\u201d the FBI, doctors, and people looking for love. One \u201cgood morning\u201d\nscript includes around a dozen messages the scammers can send to their\ntargets. \u201cIn a world full of deceit and lies, I feel lucky when see the love\nin your eyes. Good morning,\u201d one says. But things get much darker.\n\nThe Yahoo Boys have been behind a recent wave of sextortion across the United\nStates and elsewhere, says Paul Raffile, an intelligence analyst at the\nNetwork Contagion Research Institute who is closely tracking the criminals.\nBroadly speaking, during sextortion, a scammer will use intimate or explicit\nimages to try to get someone to pay them money. \u201cThe Yahoo Boys are the\nprincipal threat actor behind the surge of sextortion that we\u2019re seeing over\nthe past 18 months,\u201d Raffile says. \u201cThey are responsible for forcing dozens of\nteens to suicide.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

They say they tricked people into\nsharing nude images\u2014posting screenshots of the conversation\u2014and explained ways\nother people can replicate it. \u201cHey I am posting your naked pictures on social\nmedia and Facebook,\u201d says a sample message cybercriminals could use. \u201cAm not\njust posting it am sending copies of it to your area,\u201d the message says,\nbefore demanding $700.\n\nWhile the scripts like these are shared on all social media channels, WIRED\nfound at least 80 on the document-sharing service Scribd. The company removed\nthem after WIRED got in touch, with a spokesperson saying there are limits on\nwhat people can upload and that the company has automated and manual reviews\nto remove content. \u201cWe\u2019re actively building out new capabilities to broaden\nthe scope of content moderation coverage to include a wider range of\nconcerning text and image violations,\u201d the spokesperson says. Some of the\nscripts had been online since 2020, and on pages where they were removed a\n\u201creading suggestions\u201d section recommended other scam scripts.\n\nRaffile says the Yahoo Boys have been able to \u201cthrive\u201d online \u201cdue to lack of\nmoderation around all the illicit material\u201d that they\u2019re sharing. \u201cThey\u2019re\nacting with impunity because they feel they will never get caught,\u201d Raffile\nsays.\n\nBeyond the messaging platforms, the Yahoo Boys have a presence on TikTok and\nYouTube. \u201cWe design our app to be inhospitable to those who seek to exploit\nour community and we\u2019ve removed this content for violating our policies,\u201d a\nTikTok spokesperson says.\n\n\u201cOur policies prohibit spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take\nadvantage of the YouTube community,\u201d a YouTube spokesperson says. \u201cWe also\nprohibit videos that encourage illegal or dangerous activities. As such, we\nhave terminated the flagged channels for violating our policies and our terms\nof service.\u201d They add that the company removed accounts for breaching policies\nabout harmful content, spam, and generally violating its terms of service.\n\nThe accounts posted tutorials about how to scam people, link to groups on\nmessaging apps, and promote technology for fake video calls. On TikTok,\nmultiple accounts include carousels of images that the scammers can use in\ntheir efforts to create believable personas. Some of these include posts of\nelderly women for scammers who are in \u201cneed of grandma pictures for proof\u201d of\ntheir fake identities and others for scammers who \u201cneed kids pics\u201d for their\nvictims.\n\nAs well as being a threat to thousands of people around the world, the Yahoo\nBoys can be quick to adopt new technologies. David Maimon, a professor at\nGeorgia State University and the head of fraud insights at the identity-\nverification firm SentiLink, has monitored Yahoo Boys for years and says their\ntechniques have evolved alongside new technologies.\n\n\u201cTo build rapport with victims, the fraudsters first used text messages, then\nstarted sending recorded audio messages, to now using deepfake tools to\ncommunicate with victims live,\u201d Maimon says. \u201cOn some of the markets we now\nalso see the use of cloned voices. It is now accompanied with sending physical\nitems to victims such as presents, food deliveries, and flowers.\u201d Within some\ngroups, they use \u201cnudification\u201d tools to turn photos of people clothed into\nnude photos, and deepfake video calls.\n\nWhile the Yahoo Boys have been active for years, all the experts spoken to for\nthis piece say they should be treated more seriously by social media companies\nand law enforcement. \u201cIt\u2019s time that we start looking at Yahoo Boys as a\ndangerous organization, transnational organized crime, and start giving it\nsome of those labels,\u201d Raffile says.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * He emptied a crypto exchange onto a thumb drive\u2014then disappeared\n\n  * The real-time deepfake romance scams have arrived\n\n  * Boomergasms are booming\n\n  * Heading outdoors?
