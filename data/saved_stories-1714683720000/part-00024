For example, we\u2019ve all heard that scientists, and even more so\nmathematicians, carry out their most important work when they\u2019re comparatively\nyoung.\n\nBut my new research, published in Developmental Review, suggests that\ncognitive differences between the old and young are tapering off over time.\nThis is hugely important as stereotypes about the intelligence of people in\ntheir sixties or older may be holding them back \u2013 in the workplace and beyond.\n\nCognitive ageing is often measured by comparing young adults, aged 18-30, to\nolder adults, aged 65 and over. There are a variety of tasks that older adults\ndo not perform well on compared to young adults, such as memory, spatial\nability and speed of processing, which often form the basis of IQ tests. That\nsaid, there are a few tasks that older people do better at than younger\npeople, such as reading comprehension and vocabulary.\n\nDeclines in cognition are driven by a process called cognitive ageing, which\nhappens to everyone. Surprisingly, age-related cognitive deficits start very\nearly in adulthood, and declines in cognition have been measured as dropping\nin adults as young as just 25.\n\nOften, it is only when people reach older age that these effects add up to a\nnoticeable amount. Common complaints consist of walking into a room and\nforgetting why you entered, as well as difficulty remembering names and\nstruggling to drive in the dark.\n\n## The trouble with comparison\n\nSometimes, comparing young adults to older adults can be misleading though.\nThe two generations were brought up in different times, with different levels\nof education, healthcare and nutrition. They also lead different daily lives,\nwith some older people having lived though a world war while the youngest\ngeneration is growing up with the internet.\n\nMost of these factors favour the younger generation, and this can explain a\nproportion of their advantage in cognitive tasks.\n\nIndeed, much existing research shows that IQ has been improving globally\nthroughout the 20th century. This means that later-born generations are more\ncognitively able than those born earlier. This is even found when both\ngenerations are tested in the same way at the same age.\n\nCurrently, there is growing evidence that increases in IQ are levelling off,\nsuch that, in the most recent couple of decades, young adults are no more\ncognitively able than young adults born shortly beforehand.\n\nTogether, these factors may underlie the current result, namely that cognitive\ndifferences between young and older adults are diminishing over time.\n\n## New results\n\nMy research began when my team started getting strange results in our lab. We\nfound that often the age differences we were getting between young and older\nadults was smaller or absent, compared to prior research from early 2000s.\n\nThis prompted me to start looking at trends in age differences across the\npsychological literature in this area. I uncovered a variety of data that\ncompared young and older adults from the 1960s up to the current day. I\nplotted this data against year of publication, and found that age deficits\nhave been getting smaller over the last six decades.\n\nNext, I assessed if the average increases in cognitive ability over time seen\nacross all individuals was a result that also applied to older adults\nspecifically. Many large databases exist where groups of individuals are\nrecruited every few years to take part in the same tests. I analysed studies\nusing these data sets to look at older adults.\n\nI found that, just like younger people, older adults were indeed becoming more\ncognitively able with each cohort. But if differences are disappearing, does\nthat mean younger people\u2019s improvements in cognitive ability have slowed down\nor that older people\u2019s have increased?\n\nI analysed data from my own laboratory that I had gathered over a seven-year\nperiod to find out. Here, I was able to dissociate the performance of the\nyoung from the performance of the older. I found that each cohort of young\nadults was performing to a similar extent across this seven-year period, but\nthat older adults were showing improvements in both processing speed and\nvocabulary scores.\n\nThe figure shows data for a speed-based task where higher scores represent\nbetter performance. CC BY-SA\n\nI believe the older adults of today are benefiting from many of the factors\npreviously most applicable to young adults. For example, the number of\nchildren who went to school increased significantly in the 1960s \u2013 with the\nsystem being more similar to what it is today than what it was at the start of\nthe 20th century.\n\nThis is being reflected in that cohort\u2019s increased scores today, now they are\nolder adults. At the same time, young adults have hit a ceiling and are no\nlonger improving as much with each cohort.\n\nIt is not entirely clear why the young generations have stopped improving so\nmuch. Some research has explored maternal age, mental health and even\nevolutionary trends. I favour the opinion that there is just a natural ceiling\n\u2013 a limit to how much factors such as education, nutrition and health can\nimprove cognitive performance.\n\nThese data have important implications for research into dementia. For\nexample, it is possible that a modern older adult in the early stages of\ndementia might pass a dementia test that was designed 20 or 30 years ago for\nthe general population at that time.\n\nTherefore, as older adults are performing better in general than previous\ngenerations, it may be necessary to revise definitions of dementia that depend\non an individuals\u2019 expected level of ability.\n\nUltimately, we need to rethink what it means to become older. And there\u2019s\nfinally some good news. Ultimately, we can expect to be more cognitively able\nthan our grandparents were when we reach their age.\n\n  * Ageing\n  * Intelligence\n  * IQ\n  * Young people\n  * Age\n  * Cognition\n  * Old people\n  * Give me perspective\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Assistant Editor - 1 year cadetship\n\n  * ##### Program Development Officer - Business Processes\n\n  * ##### Executive Dean, Faculty of Health\n\n  * ##### Lecturer/Senior Lecturer, Earth System Science (School of Science)\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": true}
