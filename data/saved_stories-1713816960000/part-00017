Start your\nbusiness with a Shopify free trial: https://www.shopify.com/cleoabram On the\nborder between France and Switzerland is the biggest science experiment\nhumanity has ever built. Over a 100 meters underground, there\u2019s a tunnel 27\nkilometers long in a big loop under nearby homes, businesses, and farms.\nInside that tunnel, scientists built a blue tube big enough to crawl through,\nand inside that tube, they put two pipes that they keep colder and emptier\nthan outer space. Down those pipes, they fire particles smaller than atoms in\nopposite directions.... and push them faster and faster... until when they\u2019re\nalmost at the speed of light... they SMASH TOGETHER. This underground\nparticle-smasher is also known as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. It took\nthousands of scientists from over nearly 100 different countries $5 billion\ndollars and 30 years to plan and build. My question is: Why? Why did they do\nthat??? Why spend so much money and time to smash particles underground? And\nnow... why do so many scientists say what we really need to do is build... a\nBIGGER one? To answer those questions, we\u2019re going on a journey all the way to\nSwitzerland, to the particle smasher itself! And you\u2019re never going to see\nyourself or the world around you the same way...
