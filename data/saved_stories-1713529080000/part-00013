For example, the orbiters collect the scientific data\nfrom the Curiosity rover on Mars through near-Mars communication links,\ntransmit the data to Earth through direct links from the Mars orbiters to the\nEarth ground stations, and finally the data routed through Earth's internal\ninternet.^[3]\n\nInterplanetary communication is greatly delayed by interplanetary distances,\nso a new set of protocols and technologies that are tolerant to large delays\nand errors are required.^[2] The interplanetary Internet is a store and\nforward network of internets that is often disconnected, has a wireless\nbackbone fraught with error-prone links and delays ranging from tens of\nminutes to even hours, even when there is a connection.^[4]\n\n## Challenges and reasons[edit]\n\nIn the core implementation of Interplanetary Internet, satellites orbiting a\nplanet communicate to other planet's satellites. Simultaneously, these planets\nrevolve around the Sun with long distances, and thus many challenges face the\ncommunications. The reasons and the resultant challenges are:^[5]^[6]\n\n  1. The motion and long distances between planets: The interplanetary communication is greatly delayed due to the interplanetary distances and the motion of the planets. The delay is variable and long, ranging from a couple of minutes (Earth-to-Mars), to a couple of hours (Pluto-to-Earth), depending on their relative positions. The interplanetary communication also suspends due to the solar conjunction, when the sun's radiation hinders the direct communication between the planets. As such, the communication characterizes lossy links and intermittent link connectivity.\n  2. Low embeddable payload: Satellites can only carry a small payload, which poses challenges to the power, mass, size, and cost for communication hardware design. An asymmetric bandwidth would be the result of this limitation.^[7] This asymmetry reaches ratios up to 1000:1 as downlink:uplink bandwidth portion.\n  3. Absence of fixed infrastructure: The graph of participating nodes in a specific planet-to-planet communication keeps changing over time, due to the constant motion. The routes of the planet-to-planet communication are planned and scheduled rather than being opportunistic.\n\nThe Interplanetary Internet design must address these challenges to operate\nsuccessfully and achieve good communication with other planets. It also must\nuse the few available resources efficiently in the system.\n\n## Development[edit]\n\nSpace communication technology has steadily evolved from expensive, one-of-a-\nkind point-to-point architectures, to the re-use of technology on successive\nmissions, to the development of standard protocols agreed upon by space\nagencies of many countries. This last phase has gone on since 1982 through the\nefforts of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS),^[8] a\nbody composed of the major space agencies of the world. It has 11 member\nagencies, 32 observer agencies, and over 119 industrial associates.^[9]\n\nThe evolution of space data system standards has gone on in parallel with the\nevolution of the Internet, with conceptual cross-pollination where fruitful,\nbut largely as a separate evolution. Since the late 1990s, familiar Internet\nprotocols and CCSDS space link protocols have integrated and converged in\nseveral ways; for example, the successful FTP file transfer to Earth-orbiting\nSTRV 1B on January 2, 1996, which ran FTP over the CCSDS IPv4-like Space\nCommunications Protocol Specifications (SCPS) protocols.^[10]^[11] Internet\nProtocol use without CCSDS has taken place on spacecraft, e.g., demonstrations\non the UoSAT-12 satellite, and operationally on the Disaster Monitoring\nConstellation. Having reached the era where networking and IP on board\nspacecraft have been shown to be feasible and reliable, a forward-looking\nstudy of the bigger picture was the next phase.^[citation needed]\n\nICANN meeting, Los Angeles, USA, 2007. The marquee pays a humorous homage to\nthe Ed Wood film Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), and the operating system Plan\n9 from Bell Labs, while namedropping Internet pioneer Vint Cerf using a spoof\nof a then-current film Surf's Up (2007).\n\nThe Interplanetary Internet study at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)\nwas started by a team of scientists at JPL led by internet pioneer Vinton Cerf\nand the late Adrian Hooke.^[12] Cerf was appointed as a distinguished visiting\nscientist at JPL in 1998, while Hooke was one of the founders and directors of\nCCSDS.^[13]\n\nWhile IP-like SCPS protocols are feasible for short hops, such as ground\nstation to orbiter, rover to lander, lander to orbiter, probe to flyby, and so\non, delay-tolerant networking is needed to get information from one region of\nthe Solar System to another. It becomes apparent that the concept of a region\nis a natural architectural factoring of the Interplanetary Internet.^[citation\nneeded]\n\nA region is an area where the characteristics of communication are the same.\nRegion characteristics include communications, security, the maintenance of\nresources, perhaps ownership, and other factors. The Interplanetary Internet\nis a \"network of regional internets\".^[14]\n\nWhat is needed then, is a standard way to achieve end-to-end communication\nthrough multiple regions in a disconnected, variable-delay environment using a\ngeneralized suite of protocols. Examples of regions might include the\nterrestrial Internet as a region, a region on the surface of the Moon or Mars,\nor a ground-to-orbit region.^[citation needed]\n\nThe recognition of this requirement led to the concept of a \"bundle\" as a\nhigh-level way to address the generalized Store-and-Forward problem. Bundles\nare an area of new protocol development in the upper layers of the OSI model,\nabove the Transport Layer with the goal of addressing the issue of bundling\nstore-and-forward information so that it can reliably traverse radically\ndissimilar environments constituting a \"network of regional\ninternets\".^[citation needed]\n\nDelay-tolerant networking (DTN) was designed to enable standardized\ncommunications over long distances and through time delays. At its core is the\nBundle Protocol (BP), which is similar to the Internet Protocol, or IP, that\nserves as the heart of the Internet here on Earth. The big difference between\nthe regular Internet Protocol (IP) and the Bundle Protocol is that IP assumes\na seamless end-to-end data path, while BP is built to account for errors and\ndisconnections \u2014 glitches that commonly plague deep-space communications.^[15]\n\nBundle Service Layering, implemented as the Bundling protocol suite for delay-\ntolerant networking, will provide general-purpose delay-tolerant protocol\nservices in support of a range of applications: custody transfer, segmentation\nand reassembly, end-to-end reliability, end-to-end security, and end-to-end\nrouting among them. The Bundle Protocol was first tested in space on the UK-\nDMC satellite in 2008.^[16]^[17]\n\nThe Deep Impact mission\n\nAn example of one of these end-to-end applications flown on a space mission is\nthe CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP), used on the Deep Impact comet\nmission. CFDP is an international standard for automatic, reliable file\ntransfer in both directions. CFDP should not be confused with Coherent File\nDistribution Protocol, which has the same acronym and is an IETF-documented\nexperimental protocol for rapidly deploying files to multiple targets in a\nhighly networked environment.^[citation needed]\n\nIn addition to reliably copying a file from one entity (such as a spacecraft\nor ground station) to another entity, CFDP has the capability to reliably\ntransmit arbitrarily small messages defined by the user, in the metadata\naccompanying the file, and to reliably transmit commands relating to file\nsystem management that are to be executed automatically on the remote end-\npoint entity (such as a spacecraft) upon successful reception of a\nfile.^[citation needed]\n\n### Danuri[edit]\n\nTo test the experimental system of the \u201cspace Internet\u201d, Danuri (Korea\nPathfinder Lunar Orbiter) successfully forwarded a number of photos taken, as\nwell as several video files, including, BTS\u2019 \u201cDynamite\u201d from outer space to\nEarth at Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT, Korea Aerospace Research\nInstitute (KARI), and the Electronics and Telecommunications Research\nInstitute (ETRI) on 7 November 2022.^[18]^[19]\n\n## Protocol[edit]\n\nThe Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) packet telemetry\nstandard defines the protocol used for the transmission of spacecraft\ninstrument data over the deep-space channel. Under this standard, an image or\nother data sent from a spacecraft instrument is transmitted using one or more\npackets.\n\n### CCSDS packet definition[edit]\n\nA packet is a block of data with length that can vary between successive\npackets, ranging from 7 to 65,542 bytes, including the packet header.\n\n  * Packetized data is transmitted via frames, which are fixed-length data blocks. The size of a frame, including frame header and control information, can range up to 2048 bytes.\n  * Packet sizes are fixed during the development phase.\n\nBecause packet lengths are variable but frame lengths are fixed, packet\nboundaries usually do not coincide with frame boundaries.\n\n### Telecom processing notes[edit]\n\nData in a frame is typically protected from channel errors by error-correcting\ncodes.\n\n  * Even when the channel errors exceed the correction capability of the error-correcting code, the presence of errors is nearly always detected by the error-correcting code or by a separate error-detecting code.\n  * Frames for which uncorrectable errors are detected are marked as undecodable and typically are deleted.\n\n### Handling data loss[edit]\n\nDeleted undecodable whole frames are the principal type of data loss that\naffects compressed data sets. In general, there would be little to gain from\nattempting to use compressed data from a frame marked as undecodable.\n\n  * When errors are present in a frame, the bits of the subband pixels are already decoded before the first bit error will remain intact, but all subsequent decoded bits in the segment usually will be completely corrupted; a single bit error is often just as disruptive as many bit errors.\n  * Furthermore, compressed data usually are protected by powerful, long-blocklength error-correcting codes, which are the types of codes most likely to yield substantial fractions of bit errors throughout those frames that are undecodable.\n\nThus, frames with detected errors would be essentially unusable even if they\nwere not deleted by the frame processor.\n\nThis data loss can be compensated for with the following mechanisms.\n\n  * If an erroneous frame escapes detection, the decompressor will blindly use the frame data as if they were reliable, whereas in the case of detected erroneous frames, the decompressor can base its reconstruction on incomplete, but not misleading, data.\n  * However, it is extremely rare for an erroneous frame to go undetected.\n  * For frames coded by the CCSDS Reed\u2013Solomon code, fewer than 1 in 40,000 erroneous frames can escape detection.\n  * All frames not employing the Reed\u2013Solomon code use a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error-detecting code, which has an undetected frame-error rate of less than 1 in 32,000.\n\n## Implementation[edit]\n\nThe InterPlanetary Internet Special Interest Group of the Internet Society has\nworked on defining protocols and standards that would make the IPN\npossible.^[20] The Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG) is the\nprimary group researching Delay-tolerant networking (DTN). Additional research\nefforts focus on various uses of the new technology.^[21]\n\nThe canceled Mars Telecommunications Orbiter had been planned to establish an\nInterplanetary Internet link between Earth and Mars, in order to support other\nMars missions. Rather than using RF, it would have used optical communications\nusing laser beams for their higher data rates. \"Lasercom sends information\nusing beams of light and optical elements, such as telescopes and optical\namplifiers, rather than RF signals, amplifiers, and antennas\"^[22]\n\nNASA JPL tested the DTN protocol with their Deep Impact Networking (DINET)\nexperiment on board the Deep Impact/EPOXI spacecraft in October, 2008.^[23]\n\nIn May 2009, DTN was deployed to a payload on board the ISS.^[24] NASA and\nBioServe Space Technologies, a research group at the University of Colorado,\nhave been continuously testing DTN on two Commercial Generic Bioprocessing\nApparatus (CGBA) payloads. CGBA-4 and CGBA-5 serve as computational and\ncommunications platforms which are remotely controlled from BioServe's Payload\nOperations Control Center (POCC) in Boulder, CO.^[25]^[26] In October 2012 ISS\nStation commander Sunita Williams remotely operated Mocup (Meteron Operations\nand Communications Prototype), a \"cat-sized\" Lego Mindstorms robot fitted with\na BeagleBoard computer and webcam,^[27] located in the European Space\nOperations Centre in Germany in an experiment using DTN.^[28] These initial\nexperiments provide insight into future missions where DTN will enable the\nextension of networks into deep space to explore other planets and solar\nsystem points of interest. Seen as necessary for space exploration, DTN\nenables timeliness of data return from operating assets which results in\nreduced risk and cost, increased crew safety, and improved operational\nawareness and science return for NASA and additional space agencies.^[29]\n\nDTN has several major arenas of application, in addition to the Interplanetary\nInternet, which include sensor networks, military and tactical communications,\ndisaster recovery, hostile environments, mobile devices and remote\noutposts.^[30] As an example of a remote outpost, imagine an isolated Arctic\nvillage, or a faraway island, with electricity, one or more computers, but no\ncommunication connectivity. With the addition of a simple wireless hotspot in\nthe village, plus DTN-enabled devices on, say, dog sleds or fishing boats, a\nresident would be able to check their e-mail or click on a Wikipedia article,\nand have their requests forwarded to the nearest networked location on the\nsled's or boat's next visit, and get the replies on its return.\n\n## Earth orbit[edit]\n\nEarth orbit is sufficiently nearby that conventional protocols can be used.\nFor example, the International Space Station has been connected to the regular\nterrestrial Internet since January 22, 2010 when the first unassisted tweet\nwas posted.^[31] However, the space station also serves as a useful platform\nto develop, experiment, and implement systems that make up the interplanetary\nInternet. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have used an experimental\nversion of the interplanetary Internet to control an educational rover, placed\nat the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, from the\nInternational Space Station. The experiment used the DTN protocol to\ndemonstrate technology that one day could enable Internet-like communications\nthat can support habitats or infrastructure on another planet.^[32]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * InterPlaNet\n  * Delay-tolerant networking\n  * Intergalactic Computer Network\n  * Nanonetwork\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jackson, Joab (August 2005). \"The Interplanetary Internet\".
