When you\u2019re locked in a\ncell with a guy, there\u2019s an initial bonding phase. You do pushups together.\nYou talk about your past lives. My story ended with what led me to prison. I\nwas a drug dealer. Shot and killed a man in Brooklyn. My bunkie wasn\u2019t\ncriminal\u2014he was a square. He never mentioned his crime. So, I asked. He hadn\u2019t\nshaken his girlfriend\u2019s baby to death, he told me, and the science behind\n\u201cshaken baby syndrome,\u201d the theory that violent shaking causes fatal brain\ninjuries, was unreliable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t believe him. I just figured he couldn\u2019t admit to killing a kid. As\nyou can imagine, baby killers don\u2019t do well in prison. I figured experts\nwouldn\u2019t testify to things they were uncertain about. I think most people,\nincluding jurors, figure that. I began to question this in 2022, when I\nstarted working with Yale Law School\u2019s Prison Letters Project, an initiative\nthat responds to letters we receive from prisoners telling us about\ninjustices. I noticed that many of these letter writers claimed that they had\nbeen wrongfully convicted under the SBS theory.\n\n\u201cI was facing allegations of child abuse and first-degree murder of my\n5-month-old son,\u201d Tom Imschweiler wrote to PLP from a North Carolina prison.\nHe explained that his case was like others \u201csent to prison based on the\nhypothesis of shaken baby syndrome. What sets me apart is the support of\nprofessionals in the field and the unwavering dedication my family and friends\nhave for me.\u201d\n\nIn July 2018, Tom, a 31-year-old landscaper, and his 29-year-old girlfriend,\nLaura Michael, who worked in finance, took their 5-month-old son Franklin on a\ntrip from their home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to the Outer Banks in North\nCarolina. A week earlier, Franklin had been sick, running a 104-degree fever,\nbut his doctor signed off on the trip. Laura\u2019s mother, sister, and brother-in\nlaw drove down too. They all rented a beach house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the middle of the night, Franklin started whimpering. Tom woke up and\ncarried his son to the living room. He propped Franklin between two pillows on\nthe couch, he says, while he went to the kitchen to warm a bottle of formula.\n\u201cMinutes later, I returned and found him facedown in the pillow,\u201d Tom later\nwrote.\n\nTom yelled for help, and the whole family woke up, frantic. Tom and his\nbrother-in-law, a medic, did CPR. Laura called for an ambulance. Franklin was\nrushed to the hospital, where he died days later. Doctors discovered a triad\nof internal symptoms\u2014subdural and retinal hemorrhage and brain swelling\u2014that\nsome doctors say can be explained only by shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis\nthat criminally implicates the child\u2019s last caregiver as an abuser. Soon after\nFranklin\u2019s death, Tom was arrested and charged with murder for killing his\nbaby. He is now in prison after taking a plea deal that significantly reduced\nthe possible sentence, though he has not admitted guilt and maintains his\ninnocence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom\u2019s story is not unusual. For nearly two decades, shaken baby syndrome has\ndivided the medical community. Some doctors believe that the triad of symptoms\nused for the diagnosis cannot be explained by a fall or an accident. Others\nsay that there can be alternate explanations\u2014including accidental suffocation,\nunderlying illnesses, viral infections, or bleeding disorders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a split screen of legal rulings in cases like Tom\u2019s. Back in\n2008, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals became the first to overturn an SBS\nconviction, writing that there was \u201cfierce disagreement\u201d among doctors and \u201ca\nshift in mainstream medical opinion\u201d about the certainty of the diagnosis.\nLast year, a New Jersey appeals court barred the admission of evidence about\nshaken baby syndrome, calling it \u201cjunk science.\u201d Yet elsewhere, hundreds of\nparents and caregivers continue to be prosecuted based on the same medical\ntheory. A review of more than 1,400 appellate rulings between 2008 and 2018\nfound that only 3 percent of SBS convictions were overturned, a far lower rate\nthan in other types of cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reality is that in parts of the country, evidence of the telltale triad of\nsymptoms won\u2019t warrant an arrest\u2014but in other parts, it can literally amount\nto a death sentence.\n\nThis is the case for 56-year-old Robert Roberson. He is on death row in Texas\nfor an SBS conviction. In 2002 he carried his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki\nCurtis, limp and blue, into an East Texas hospital. She died the next day.\nAfter doctors diagnosed shaken baby syndrome, Roberson was arrested. The\ndetective who questioned him, Brian Wharton, noted his lack of\nemotion\u2014Roberson didn\u2019t seem defensive, angry, or sad. In 2003 a jury\nconvicted Roberson and sentenced him to death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe jury didn\u2019t know that Roberson would later receive a diagnosis for autism,\nwhich could explain his low affect. The jurors also did not learn that Nikki\nhad suffered from chronic illness since birth. Days before she died, she had\nbouts of breathing apnea from undiagnosed pneumonia. She was also taking an\nopioid, for an unspecified respiratory illness, a treatment that can cause\nbreathing problems. In 2018, when Roberson\u2019s attorney, Gretchen Sween, told\nWharton about Roberson\u2019s autism and the other information about Nikki\u2019s\nhealth, it was clear to her the detective had long been troubled by the case.\nWharton agreed to testify about his initial misgivings and about how\nRoberson\u2019s autism could have influenced his opinion about Roberson during the\ninvestigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut neither the evidence about Nikki\u2019s health nor Wharton\u2019s testimony made a\ndifference. In spite of these developments, the Texas courts have denied\nRoberson relief, and last year the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.\nRoberson could receive an execution date any day now.\n\nDoctors who defend the science behind SBS convictions point out that abusive\nhead trauma, a term that includes shaken baby syndrome, is the third leading\ncause of head injury in children. They say health care providers conduct\nextensive evaluations before reaching a diagnosis. Robert Sege, a professor at\nTufts University School of Medicine who has served on the American Academy of\nPediatrics\u2019 Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, acknowledges that wrongful\nconvictions occur. But he says he\u2019s not sure how that fact \u201chas any relevance\nto the issue of abusive head trauma.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a doctor and experienced child abuse pediatrician, I know that abusive\nhead trauma exists,\u201d Sege said. \u201cI have cared for injured children, some of\nwhom died. I have met with their parents, who were deep in misery as the\nrealization of what they had done seeped in.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, prosecutors rely in part on medical evidence, separate from the\nSBS diagnosis, which they say points to a history of child abuse. In\nFranklin\u2019s case, there was no known history of abuse, but doctors found that\nhe had fractured ribs and a rectal tear. Tom and Laura had nonviolent\nexplanations for those injuries. Franklin had been in a car accident months\nbefore his death, they said, which could have caused the fractures, and his\ntemperature was taken anally while he had the high fever, soon before he died,\nwhich could account for the rectal tearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the district attorney, Andrew Womble, had what he considered to be an\nadmission of guilt. After his arrest in 2018, Tom wrote a letter to Laura from\njail, which prosecutors intercepted and read. \u201cMaybe the devil took my hand,\u201d\nhe wrote. \u201cMaybe I did hurt my son.\u201d\n\nTom now says he wrote the letter in a state of \u201cabsolute despair, believing\nthat I somehow was responsible because that is all I was told from the moment\nI went into custody.\u201d His defense attorney sent Franklin\u2019s medical file to\nMary Gilliland, a forensic pathologist and expert in abusive head trauma who\nhas worked with North Carolina prosecutors for decades. Reviewing the case\nwithout payment, Gilliland concluded that Franklin\u2019s death had been an\naccidental suffocation. His parents\u2019 explanations for Franklin\u2019s other\ninjuries made sense to her too. \u201cThe age of the broken rib is just right for\nthat time frame,\u201d she said in a video presentation of her findings that\nprosecutors reviewed with the charges against Tom pending. \u201cThis is an older\ninjury, and it\u2019s unrelated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWomble did not drop the charges against Tom, but he offered an unusual plea\ndeal for the alleged murder of a child: a five-year prison sentence for\nvoluntary manslaughter.\n\nIn November 2021, Laura married Tom, who was out on bail, in a Pennsylvania\ncourthouse. She was six months pregnant with their second child. Ten days\nlater, they went to North Carolina, and Tom took what\u2019s called an Alford plea,\nwhich allowed him to plead guilty to Franklin\u2019s manslaughter while maintaining\nhis innocence.\n\n## Related From Slate\n\n#### Hillary Blout\n\n### One Simple Criminal Justice Reform Could Solve the Prosecutor Shortage\nCrisis\n\nRead More\n\nIn a letter from prison, Tom said he took the plea \u201cso my daughter will have\nher daddy before she\u2019s old enough to have lifelong memories.\u201d In the meantime,\nLaura is raising their child alone. She has posted an online petition asking\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper to commute Tom\u2019s sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom lives in a dorm in Sanford Correctional Center, a low-security prison in\nrural North Carolina. He works off-grounds in a warehouse for $16.84 a week.\nLaura makes the 10-hour trip from Pennsylvania to North Carolina only a few\ntimes a year. She brings their new baby, who, Laura told me, beams when she\nsees her father in the visiting area. I thought about my old bunkie, the\nsquare with the SBS case, and I wondered about the pecking order part of\nprison, if other prisoners ostracized and judged Tom like I did my bunkie. I\nwondered if my bunkie really was innocent. I wondered if the knock-around guys\nwho lived in his dorm called him a baby killer behind his back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the beginning, there were some guys who said things, Laura told me, but Tom\nhas found a sense of security with others. They work, lift weights, talk about\nfreedom. But I imagine he hasn\u2019t shared everything with Laura. He has\ninternalized plenty. It\u2019s all we can do in here. What struck me about Tom and\nLaura was how the loss of their son, for which they were the most affected,\nwas shadowed by this idea of justice. I asked Laura about that.\n\n\u201cI would want justice if my son was abused,\u201d Laura told me. Her dog barked;\nher 2-year-old cried for her attention. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t. This was an\ninjustice.\u201d\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\n  * Criminal Justice\n  * Jurisprudence\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Work With Us\n  * Contact\n  * Pitch Guidelines\n  * Send Us Tips\n  * Corrections\n  * Commenting\n  * Reprints\n\n#### Subscriptions\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Sign In\n  * Account\n  * Subscription FAQs\n  * Podcast FAQs\n  * Newsletters\n  * Customer Support\n\n#### Advertising\n\n  * AdChoices\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\n#### Follow Us\n\nFacebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Feed\n\n  * User Agreement\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9 2024 The Slate Group LLC.
