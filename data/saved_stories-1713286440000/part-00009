The Wachowski sisters first\nworked with Pope on \u201cBound\u201d before teaming up with him for \u201cThe Matrix.\u201d Their\nwork together on the 1999 action film proved groundbreaking (see: the\ninvention of bullet time), but the highs of collaborating on \u201cThe Matrix\u201d were\nnot matched while filming the two sequels, \u201cThe Matrix Reloaded\u201d and \u201cThe\nMatrix Revolutions.\u201d During an interview with Roger Deakins on this week\u2019s\n\u201cTeam Deakins\u201d podcast, Pope said shooting \u201cThe Matrix\u201d sequels were \u201cmind\nnumbing and soul numbing.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories\n\nNew \u2018The Matrix\u2019 Movie in the Works from Director Drew Goddard\n\n3 Ways \u2018The Matrix\u2019 Forever Changed the Craft of Hollywood Filmmaking\n\n\u201cEverything that was good about the first experience was not good about the\nlast two,\u201d Pope said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t free anymore. People were looking at you.\nThere was a lot of pressure. In my heart, I didn\u2019t like them. I felt we should\nbe going in another direction. There was a lot of friction and a lot of\npersonal problems, and it showed up on screen to be honest with you. It was\nnot my most elevated moment, nor was it anyone else\u2019s. The Wachowskis had read\nthis damn book by Stanley Kubrick that said, \u2018Actors don\u2019t do natural\nperformances until you wear them out.\u2019 So let\u2019s go to take 90! I want to dig\nStanley Kubrick up and kill him.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pope, the Wachowskis adopted a \u201cshoot more takes\u201d mentality on\nthe two \u201cMatrix\u201d sequels and it made the experience \u201csort of torture.\u201d The\ncinematographer said he had to sit through \u201c90 takes of many things\u201d while\nshooting the sequels and shared his belief that \u201cyou\u2019re not gaining anything\n[by doing multiple takes].\u201d Pope shot \u201cReloaded\u201d and \u201cRevolutions\u201d back to\nback, which only added to the exhaustion of production.\n\n\u201cThere is something about making a shoot that long, 276 shoot days, that is\nmind numbing and soul numbing and it numbs the movie,\u201d Pope said. \u201cYou think\nabout \u2018The Hobbit,\u2019 where they [shot] one, two, and three, and the movies are\njust numbing. In the books you don\u2019t feel that because you pick it up and put\nit down. In a movie shoot it\u2019s too long. There\u2019s a limit from what you can\ntake in.\u201d\n\nWhile the experience of making \u201cThe Matrix\u201d sequels was punishing, Pope looks\nback on the two films with respect. As the DP told Deakins, \u201cI just\ntransferred them all to 4K for archive purposes at Warners. and I wrote the\nWachowkis and Keanu and Carrie Ann that we did a good job [on the sequels], we\nshould be proud of them.\u201d\n\nPope, whose credits also include \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d and several Edgar Wright\nfeatures, is currently waiting to re-start production on Marvel\u2019s upcoming\ntentpole \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.\u201d He previously wrapped\nfilming on Ryan Murphy\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d which is now in\npost-production. John Toll, the Oscar-winning DP of \u201cLegends of the Fall\u201d and\n\u201cBraveheart,\u201d is serving as cinematographer on \u201cThe Matrix 4.\u201d\n\nDaily Headlines\n\nDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.\n\nSubscribe\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nFeatures\n\nInside the Puzzling History of Bravo\u2019s Iconic Short-Lived Series \u2018NYC Prep\u2019\n\nWould Anyone Like a Peanut?\n\n\u2018Shaun of the Dead\u2019 Oral History: Zombie Trust Exercises, Getting Egged on\nSet, and Helen Mirren\u2019s Unforgettable Turndown\n\nhbo\n\nPark Chan-Wook Wanted to Direct All of \u2018The Sympathizer\u2019\n\nFeatures\n\n4 Years (and Judicious Editing) Later, Quibi Series \u2018The Stranger\u2019 Has Become\na Movie\n\nFeatures\n\n\u2018Space Ghost Coast to Coast\u2019 at 30: A Cable TV Hidden Delight for Fans of the\nOffbeat\n\nFeatures\n\nAdobe Generative AI Video Tools Are Coming to Premiere Pro\n\nDaily Headlines\n\nDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy\nPolicy.
