The Constitution still protects\nour right to protest,\u201d McKesson said.\n\nBy\n\n    Zane McNeill ,\n    Truthout\n\nPublished\n\n    April 16, 2024\n\nPeople dance to live Go-go music at the intersection of H St NW and 16th\nStreet NW near the White House, an area renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza,\nwhile celebrating the Juneteenth holiday June 19, 2020 in Washington, DC.Chip\nSomodevilla/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court declined to review a case with significant\nramifications for protest rights in Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana. The\nCourt\u2019s denial of certiorari allows the anti-First Amendment decision by the\nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals, known as one of the most conservative circuits\nin the nation, to go into effect.\n\n\u201cThe courts refusal to take up the first amendment protest case and we are\nseeing bedrock civil rights being stripped away and judicial relief being made\nimpossible to obtain,\u201d Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at Harvard\nLaw\u2019s Cyberlaw Clinic, said on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s a dark day for the\njudiciary which has become wholly illegitimate.\u201d\n\nThe case, Doe v. McKesson, was filed by a police officer who was injured\nduring a protest in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, sparked by the police killing of\nAlton Sterling in 2016. The protester who threw the hard object at the officer\nwas never identified. Instead, the officer filed a lawsuit targeting DeRay\nMcKesson, a prominent Black Lives Matter activist, the hashtag\n#BlackLivesMatter, and the Black Lives Matter movement in its entirety. The\nlawsuit alleged that McKesson and the other defendants should be held civilly\nliable for inciting \u201cviolence and property loss.\u201d\n\n\u201c[I]n a legal complaint that is riddled with typos, Doe\u2019s lawyers claim that\nMcKesson should be liable for \u2018injuries and compensable damages . . . greater\nthan $75,000.00\u2019 because of the alleged actions of an unknown person who, in\ncase this fact is not yet clear, is not DeRay McKesson,\u201d Ian Millhiser wrote\nin ThinkProgress in 2019.\n\nBrian Jackson, the chief judge of Louisiana Middle District Court, said in his\n2017 opinion on McKesson\u2019s motion to dismiss that the officer failed to \u201cstate\na plausible claim for relief against an individual or entity that both has the\ncapacity to be sued and falls within the precisely tailored category of\npersons that may be held liable for his injuries, which he allegedly suffered\nduring activity that was otherwise constitutionally protected.\u201d\n\n### Related Story\n\nOp-Ed\n\n|\n\nHuman Rights\n\n## Anti-Protest Laws Are Not About Safety, They Are About Silencing Dissent\n\nWe must not allow our movements for justice to be silenced by laws that\ncriminalize dissent.\n\nBy\n\n    Ashley K. Shelton ,\n    Truthout\n\nApril 9, 2023\n\nTruthout\n\nJackson pointed out that not only are social movements immune to lawsuits, but\nthat the officer failed to demonstrate that McKesson overstepped the\nboundaries of First Amendment-protected speech, which is understood to\nsafeguard political protests.\n\nHowever, in 2023, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower\ncourt\u2019s decision, allowing the officer\u2019s negligence claim against McKesson to\nproceed. The Fifth Circuit ruled that the plaintiff had \u201cplausibly alleged\nthat McKesson...knew or should have known that the police would be forced to\nrespond to the demonstration, that the protest would turn violent, and that\nsomeone might be injured as a result.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he Doe opinion offers a road map to police officers \u2014 or, really, to\nanyone injured by a single participant in a political movement they disagree\nwith \u2014 to shut down those movements with litigation,\u201d Millhiser explained in\nThinkProgress.\n\nMcKesson\u2019s defense that the First Amendment \u201cforbids a State from imposing\nliability in these circumstances,\u201d was rejected, greatly limiting First\nAmendment protection and imperiling the right to protest in Texas, Mississippi\nand Louisiana.\n\n\u201cSuch an exotic theory would have enfeebled America\u2019s street-blocking civil\nrights movement, imposing ruinous financial liability against citizens for\nexercising core First Amendment freedoms,\u201d Judge Don Willett wrote in his\ndissent. \u201cHolding McKesson responsible for the violent acts of others because\nhe \u2018negligently\u2019 led a protest that carried the risk of potential violence is\nimpossible to square with Supreme Court precedent holding that only tortious\nactivity meant to incite imminent violence, and likely to do so, forfeits\nconstitutional protection against liability for violent acts committed by\nothers.\u201d\n\nThe decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to not grant certiorari in this case\nsends it back to the lower courts to proceed on the merits. While McKesson may\nbe found not liable by a jury, advocates believe that the Court\u2019s refusal to\ntake the case may \u201chave a chilling effect on people hoping to organize and\ndemand racial justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of lawsuits like these is to prevent people from showing up at a\nprotest out of the fear that they might be held responsible if anything\nhappens,\u201d McKesson said in a statement. \u201cBut people don\u2019t need to be afraid to\nshow up. The Constitution still protects our right to protest.\u201d\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
