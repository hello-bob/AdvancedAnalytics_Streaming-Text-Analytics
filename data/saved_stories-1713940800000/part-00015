The intensity of the debate\nreached its zenith in late December and January, amid a sustained fight over\nthe paper\u2019s claim that Hamas had systematically weaponized sexual violence on\nOctober 7.\n\nPublished on December 28, the story, headlined \u201cScreams Without Words,\u201d\ninstantly served as a powerful reference in a mounting campaign waged by\nIsrael and its supporters to convince the world that Hamas had implemented a\nsystematic rape campaign against Jewish women on October 7. The article by\nJeffrey Gettleman, Anat Schwartz, and Adam Sella also was met with skepticism\nby independent journalists and other analysts who combed through each line of\nthe story highlighting inconsistencies and credibility issues with people\npresented as witnesses and experts.\n\nSince the story\u2019s publication, the internal dispute led to the shelving of an\nepisode of \u201cThe Daily,\u201d the paper\u2019s flagship podcast, that was to be based on\n\u201cScreams Without Words.\u201d The fight over the podcast episode spilled into the\npages of The Intercept, prompting a far-reaching leak investigation that the\nNew York Times\u2019s union alleged was carried out in a manner that singled out\nand discriminated against reporters of Middle Eastern and North African\nextraction. A Times spokesperson denied that it engaged in racial targeting.\n\n## Related\n\n### New York Times Puts \u201cDaily\u201d Episode on Ice Amid Internal Firestorm Over\nHamas Sexual Violence Article\n\nOn Monday, executive editor Joe Kahn told staff the leak probe was ending. \u201cWe\ndid not reach a definitive conclusion about how this significant breach\noccurred. We did identify gaps in the way proprietary journalistic material is\nhandled, and we have taken steps to address these issues,\u201d Kahn wrote on a\nTimes Slack channel message seen by The Intercept. \u201cThe breach that occurred\nshould upset anyone who wants to have transparency in our editorial processes\nand to encourage candid exchanges. We work together with trust and\ncollegiality everyday on everything we produce, and I have every expectation\nthat this incident will prove to be a singular exception to an important\nrule.\u201d\n\nIn weeks leading up to the announcement that the probe was over, however, top\nofficials in the Times newsroom justified the investigation and its conduct,\naccording to newsroom sources and remarks at an April 4 meeting reviewed by\nThe Intercept.\n\nInternal concerns about the \u201cScreams Without Words\u201d article have been borne\nout by subsequent reporting from several media outlets, including The\nIntercept and the New York Times itself. The Times has not appended any major\ncorrections to the December 28 story. Instead, the paper took the unusual step\nof inserting a bracketed \u201cupdate\u201d within the body of the story, with a link to\na recent Times news article that undermines the original reporting.\n\n## Defending Leak Probe\n\nRoughly 20 Times staffers were interviewed in the probe, which was led by\nCharlotte Behrendt, the chief of the paper\u2019s internal investigations unit.\nInitially, Times leadership said, \u201cThe inquiry is focused narrowly on how\ninternal materials were shared with outsiders.\u201d In a March 5 statement,\nhowever, the New York Times Guild said this was not true and filed a grievance\nwith the newspaper for discrimination against employees of Middle Eastern or\nNorth African background.\n\n\u201cMembers faced extensive questions about their involvement in MENA ERG\u201d \u2014\nemployee resource group \u2014 \u201cevents and discussions, and about their views of\nthe Times\u2019s Middle East coverage,\u201d the union said. \u201cGroup leaders were asked\nto turn over the group\u2019s membership list, as well as the names of all New York\nTimes colleagues who had \u2018raised concerns\u2019 \u2014 in private discussions \u2014 about a\npublished New York Times article.\u201d\n\nTimes spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said, \u201cThe claim that anyone was\nsingled out based on ethnicity or associations is completely untrue.\u201d (The New\nYork Times Guild did not respond to a request for comment about whether the\ngrievance process was ongoing.)\n\n## Related\n\n### Leaked NYT Gaza Memo Tells Journalists to Avoid Words \u201cGenocide,\u201d \u201cEthnic\nCleansing,\u201d and \u201cOccupied Territory\u201d\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the closing of the probe, the intensity of the\ninternal debate over Gaza coverage in the newsroom calmed, several Times\nstaffers have told The Intercept, and interviews that were supposed to take\nplace as part of the leak investigation never did. This led some employees to\nspeculate that the investigation was winding down.\n\nIn an April 4 meeting, however, staffers were left with the impression the\nleak probe was continuing, according to three newsroom sources. During the\nall-staff meeting, Kahn, the executive editor, was asked for an update on the\ninvestigation and whether any staffers had been disciplined.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing really concrete that we can say about it right now beyond\nthe fact just to re-emphasize that this inquiry was very narrowly focused just\non one issue which was making sure that we can protect the confidentiality of\nthe journalistic process,\u201d Kahn said. \u201cIt\u2019s just very important that we be\nable to have that process unfold with the full confidence that that will\nremain internal to our staff and not be revealed or leaked externally. So\nthat\u2019s really the focus of it.\u201d\n\nTimes managing editor Carolyn Ryan told staffers at the meeting that the\ninternal probe was more than a simple leak investigation.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really capture the gravity of what occurred here and the kind of\nextraordinary nature of it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about sharing pre-\npublication, pre-broadcast materials that were clearly internal, confidential,\nand sensitive.\u201d\n\nTimes editorial leaders alluded to new internal policy initiatives aimed at\nstanching leaks and external criticism of the paper by staffers. They also\nemphasized that criticism and attacks on colleagues or the journalism of the\nTimes was prohibited \u201coutside of the proper channels.\u201d\n\nThe day Kahn announced the probe was over, The Intercept published a story on\na leaked Times style memo that instructed its journalists covering Israel\u2019s\nwar on Gaza to restrict the use of the terms \u201cgenocide\u201d and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d\nand to \u201cavoid\u201d using the phrase \u201coccupied territory\u201d when describing\nPalestinian land.\n\nNew York Times executive editor Joseph Kahn speaks during a panel hosted by\nthe Wall Street Journal in New York City on May 3, 2023.

Hired by the Times to work with Gettleman, one of\nits marquee reporters, Schwartz did much of the on-the-ground reporting and\ninterviews for \u201cScreams Without Words,\u201d which purported to show a systematic\npattern of rape and other sexual violence by Hamas on October 7.\n\n\u201cAnat was a freelancer that we worked with in Israel,\u201d Pan said. \u201cShe made\nvaluable contributions to our report. We didn\u2019t see anything amiss with her\nwork for us, but we learned about social media activity that predated her time\nworking with us that was unacceptable and she\u2019s not working with us right\nnow.\u201d (Neither Pan nor Schwartz responded to requests for comment.)\n\nSchwartz\u2019s social media history intensified the controversy around the\n\u201cScreams\u201d story. Following October 7, Schwartz liked a post on the platform X,\nsaying that Israel needed to \u201cturn the Strip into a slaughterhouse.\u201d Another\npost on X liked by Schwartz repeated a since-debunked viral claim about\nbeheaded babies in the October 7 attack and she also liked a post called for\ncreating a narrative that would support Israel\u2019s war aims.\n\n## Join Our Newsletter\n\n## Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.\n\nI'm in\n\nAfter the posts were brought to light, the Times announced it was reviewing\nSchwartz\u2019s social media activity. \u201cThose \u2018likes\u2019 are unacceptable violations\nof our company policy,\u201d said a Times spokesperson in February.\n\nThe Times had previously stood by Schwartz\u2019s reporting publicly. \u201cMs. Schwartz\nwas part of a rigorous reporting and editing process,\u201d Pan said in a statement\nprovided to The Intercept for a late-February story about the controversy.\n\u201cShe made valuable contributions and we saw no evidence of bias in her work.\nWe remain confident in the accuracy of our reporting and stand by the team\u2019s\ninvestigation. But as we have said, her \u2018likes\u2019 of offensive and opinionated\nsocial media posts, predating her work with us, are unacceptable.\u201d\n\nOn March 5, according to chat records reviewed by The Intercept, Times\nJerusalem bureau chief Patrick Kingsley removed Schwartz from the WhatsApp\ngroup used by the paper\u2019s journalists for communicating about Gaza coverage.\n(Kingsley directed questions to the Times communications team.)\n\n## Related\n\n### Kibbutz Be\u2019eri Rejects Story in New York Times October 7 Expos\u00e9: \u201cThey\nWere Not Sexually Abused\u201d\n\nThe day before Schwartz was removed from the group, The Intercept published a\nstory challenging one of the central allegations of sexual assault featured in\n\u201cScreams Without Words.\u201d In its article, the Times had cited an anonymous\nIsraeli special forces paramedic who claimed that two teenage girls were\nsexually assaulted in Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, offering a graphic description of the\nscene.\n\nA spokesperson for the kibbutz, however, told The Intercept that, based on the\ninformation they had been provided, the story was flatly false. Family members\nof the two girls also disputed they were sexually assaulted. A spokesperson\nfor the Times told The Intercept the paper continued to stand by its\nreporting.\n\nSchwartz would only author one more story for the paper after \u201cScreams\u201d: a co-\nbyline with the \u201cScreams\u201d team on a January 29 story about the arrival of a\nUnited Nations team in Israel to draft a report about sexual violence on\nOctober 7.\n\n## \u201cScreams\u201d Falls Apart\n\nWhen the U.N. report finally arrived on March 4, the Times story about it\nwasn\u2019t written by any of the \u201cScreams\u201d reporters. What the U.N. had found\nseemed to undermine the December story: Two high-profile cases sexual assault\nalleged to have happened at Kibbutz Be\u2019eri were \u201cunfounded.\u201d\n\nYet the Times stuck by its reporting. The paper\u2019s story on the U.N. report\nsaid the special forces paramedic\u2019s account in \u201cScreams\u201d was not in question:\n\u201cFirst responders told The New York Times they had found bodies of women with\nsigns of sexual assault at those two kibbutzim, but The Times, in its\ninvestigation, did not refer to the specific allegations that the U.N. said\nwere unfounded.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper never explained the basis for its assertion that the U.N. had\nnot actually debunked the paper\u2019s reporting on the incident, but evidence soon\ncame to light indicating that the reporting was false: There was video. On\nMarch 25, the Times itself reported that it had reviewed video taken by an\nIsraeli soldier of the scene\u2019s aftermath, showing three fully clothed bodies\nwith no signs of sexual violence \u2014 making clear the paramedic\u2019s description\noffered in \u201cScreams Without Words\u201d was false.\n\nThe Times\u2019s new article on the video did not feature Gettleman\u2019s byline. \u201cNew\nvideo has surfaced that undercuts the account of an Israeli military paramedic\nwho said two teenagers killed in the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7 were\nsexually assaulted,\u201d the paper reported. \u201cThe unnamed paramedic, from an\nIsraeli commando unit, was among dozens of people interviewed for a Dec. 28\narticle by The New York Times that examined sexual violence on Oct. 7.\u201d\n\nThe Times, after submitting its article for a prestigious George Polk Award \u2014\nand winning \u2014 suddenly began looking to share credit for its erroneous\nreporting. \u201cThe Associated Press, CNN, and the Washington Post reported\nsimilar accounts from a military paramedic who spoke on condition of\nanonymity,\u201d reported the Times. (Eylon Levy, who at the time was an Israeli\ngovernment spokesperson, had publicly offered to connect the paramedic with\nWestern media outlets.)\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\n## Israel\u2019s War on Gaza\n\nThe Times also walked back its claim that the previous U.N. report had not\nreferred to its reporting. The Times article on the video said: \u201cThe report\nsaid the U.N. team was unable to establish whether sexual violence occurred in\nBe\u2019eri and that at least two Be\u2019eri cases reported in the news media were\ndetermined to be \u2018unfounded,\u2019 but it did not explicitly specify a military\nparamedic\u2019s account.\u201d It was a departure from its previous claim of certainty\nthat the U.N. wasn\u2019t referencing the account reported in the paper.\n\nInstead of issuing a correction, the Times simply updated its \u201cScreams Without\nWords\u201d with the bracketed revelation that an entire section of its article was\nincorrect.\n\nAn official with the George Polk Awards confirmed to The Intercept that\n\u201cScreams Without Words\u201d was part of the Times package that won in the category\nfor best foreign reporting. Gettleman, however, did not attend the Times\u2019s\nprivate reception celebrating the award last week, nor did he appear at the\nawards luncheon on Friday.\n\n\u201cA number of our team members, including Jeffrey, were invited to attend but\ncould not due to other commitments,\u201d said a Times spokesperson. \u201cThe Times\nstands behind the reporting he and our entire team have done and is supportive\nof their earned accolades.\u201d\n\nThe Polk committee said it stands by its citation and the award.\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on X\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n\n## Contact the author:\n\nJeremy Scahill jeremy.scahill@theintercept.com @jeremyscahill on X\n\nRyan Grim ryan.grim@theintercept.com @ryangrim on X\n\n## Related\n\n### Leaked NYT Gaza Memo Tells Journalists to Avoid Words \u201cGenocide,\u201d \u201cEthnic\nCleansing,\u201d and \u201cOccupied Territory\u201d\n\n### Kibbutz Be\u2019eri Rejects Story in New York Times October 7 Expos\u00e9: \u201cThey\nWere Not Sexually Abused\u201d\n\n### The Story Behind the New York Times October 7 Expos\u00e9\n\n### New York Times Puts \u201cDaily\u201d Episode on Ice Amid Internal Firestorm Over\nHamas Sexual Violence Article\n\n## Latest Stories\n\n### As Biden Cheers TikTok Ban, White House Embraces TikTok Influencers\n\nKen Klippenstein, Daniel Boguslaw\n\n\\- 5:25 pm\n\nThe White House brushes off accusations of hypocrisy, courting TikTok while\nseeking to ban it.\n\n### Chuck Schumer Privately Warns Pakistan: Don't Kill Imran Khan in Prison\n\nRyan Grim, Murtaza Hussain\n\n\\- 4:04 pm\n\nSupporters worry Khan\u2019s life is in danger and with good reason: The military\nhas a long history of killing deposed leaders.\n\n### A Prosecutor Asked Texas to Kill Melissa Lucio.
