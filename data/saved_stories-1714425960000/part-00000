Herculano-Houzel\u2019s paper described T. rex as\nessentially wily enough to sharpen their own shivs. The bold claims made\nheadlines, and almost immediately attracted scrutiny and skepticism from\npaleontologists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClimate & Environment\n\n### You\u2019re gonna need a bigger number: Scientists consider a Category 6 for\nmega-hurricane era\n\nAs climate change intensifies hurricanes, some scientists want a Category 6\nfor the biggest storms\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\nIn a paper published Monday in \u201cThe Anatomical Record,\u201d an international team\nof paleontologists, neuroscientists and behavioral scientists argue that\nHerculano-Houzel\u2019s assumptions about brain cavity size and corresponding\nneuron counts were off-base.\n\nTrue T. rex intelligence, the scientists say, was probably much closer to that\nof modern-day crocodiles than primates \u2014 a perfectly respectable amount of\nsmarts for a therapod to have.\n\n\u201cWhat needs to be emphasized is that reptiles are certainly not as dim-witted\nas is commonly believed,\u201d said Kai Caspar, a biologist at Heinrich Heine\nUniversity D\u00fcsseldorf and co-author of the paper. \u201cSo whereas there is no\nreason to assume that T. rex had primate-like habits, it was certainly a\nbehaviorally sophisticated animal.\u201d\n\nBrain tissue doesn\u2019t fossilize, and so researchers examine the shape and size\nof the brain cavity in fossilized dinosaur skulls to deduce what their brains\nmay have been like.\n\nIn their analysis, the authors took issue with Herculano-Houzel\u2019s assumption\nthat dinosaur brains filled their skull cavities in a proportion similar to\nbird brains. Herculano-Houzel\u2019s analysis posited that T. rex brains occupied\nmost of their brain cavity, analogous to that of the modern-day ostrich.\n\nBut dinosaur brain cases more closely resemble those of modern-day reptiles\nlike crocodiles, Caspar said. For animals like crocodiles, brain matter\noccupies only 30% to 50% of the brain cavity. Though brain size isn\u2019t a\nperfect predictor of neuron numbers, a much smaller organ would have far fewer\nthan the 3 billion neurons Herculano-Houzel projected.\n\n\u201cT. rex does come out as the biggest-brained big dinosaur we studied, and the\nbiggest one not closely related to modern birds, but we couldn\u2019t find the 2 to\n3 billion neurons she found, even under our most generous estimates,\u201d said co-\nauthor Thomas R. Holtz, Jr., a vertebrate paleontologist at University of\nMaryland, College Park.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the research team argued, neuron counts aren\u2019t an ideal indicator\nof an animal\u2019s intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiraffes have roughly the same number of neurons that crows and baboons have,\nHoltz pointed out, but they don\u2019t use tools or display complex social behavior\nin the way those species do.\n\n\u201cObviously in broad strokes you need more neurons to create more thoughts and\nmemories and to solve problems,\u201d Holtz said, but the sheer number of neurons\nan animal has can\u2019t tell us how the animal will use them.\n\n\u201cNeuronal counts really are comparable to the storage capacity and active\nmemory on your laptop, but cognition and behavior is more like the operating\nsystem,\u201d he said. \u201cNot all animal brains are running the same software.\u201d\n\nScience & Medicine\n\n### An AI app claims it can detect sexually transmitted infections. Doctors\nsay it\u2019s a disaster\n\n\u2018There are so many things wrong with this app that I don\u2019t even know where to\nbegin,\u2019 one doctor said about Calmara, which says it can identify sexually\ntransmitted infections from photos of penises.\n\nApril 7, 2024\n\nBased on CT scan reconstructions, the T. rex brain was probably \u201c a long tube\nthat has very little in terms of the cortical expansion that you see in a\nprimate or a modern bird,\u201d said paleontologist Luis Chiappe, director of the\nDinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.\n\n\u201cThe argument that a T. Rex would have been as intelligent as a primate \u2014 no.\nThat makes no sense to me,\u201d said Chiappe, who was not involved in the study.\n\nLike many paleontologists, Chiappe and his colleagues at the Dinosaur\nInstitute were skeptical of Herculano-Houzel\u2019s original conclusions. The new\npaper is more consistent with previous understandings of dinosaur anatomy and\nintelligence, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am delighted to see that my simple study using solid data published by\npaleontologists opened the way for new studies,\u201d Herculano-Houzel said in an\nemail. \u201cReaders should analyze the evidence and draw their own conclusions.\nThat\u2019s what science is about!\u201d\n\nWhen thinking about the inner life of T. rex, the most important takeaway is\nthat reptilian intelligence is in fact more sophisticated than our species\noften assumes, scientists said.\n\n\u201cThese animals engage in play, are capable of being trained, and even show\nexcitement when they see their owners,\u201d Holtz said. \u201cWhat we found doesn\u2019t\nmean that T. rex was a mindless automaton; but neither was it going to\norganize a Triceratops rodeo or pass down stories of the duckbill that was\nTHAT BIG but got away.\u201d\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### Rattlesnakes on Santa Catalina Island have learned that it pays to be unusually aggressive\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\n  * ### Your dog can understand what you say better than you think, new study shows\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\n  * ### Our ancient animal ancestors had tails.
