As reported by Android Authority, with a\nseries of recently accepted patches this RISC-V support was stripped again\nfrom the ACK. While this doesn\u2019t mean that Android cannot be made to work on\nRISC-V, any company interested would have to do all of the heavy lifting\nthemselves, which might include Qualcomm with their recently announced RISC-V-\nbased smartwatch Snapdragon SoC.\n\nNo reason was provided by Google for this change, and the official statement\nfrom Google to Android Authority says that Google is not ready to provide a\nsingle supported Android Generic Kernel Image (GKI), but that \u2018Android will\ncontinue to support RISC-V\u2019. This change however, removes RISC-V kernel\nsupport from the ACK, and since Google only certifies Android builds which\nship with a GKI featuring an ACK, this effectively means that RISC-V is not\nsupported at this point, and likely won\u2019t be for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs discussed on Hacker News, a potential reason might be the very fragmentary\nnature of the RISC-V ISA, which makes a standard RISC-V kernel very\ncomplicated if you want to support more than a (barebones) profile. This is\nalso supported by a RISC-V mailing list thread, where \u2018expensive maintenance\u2019\nis mentioned for why Google doesn\u2019t want to support RISC-V.\n\nPosted in NewsTagged google android, RISC-V\n\n## 9 thoughts on \u201cGoogle Removes RISC-V Support From Android\u201d\n\n  1.

As it is an intentional action\ndesigned to help Google\u2019s partners and harm RISC-V vendors that do not have a\nclose relationship with Google.\n\nI\u2019m not a lawyer, and besides it\u2019s probably legal, not all anti-competitive\nbehavior is regulated.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. wow says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 11:58 pm\n\nHarm what risc-v phone vendors? None exist. Zero. You are demanding someone\n(not you of course) spend money on making software that literally no one is\nusing.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  2. Truth says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 8:42 pm\n\nI wonder is this a move by Google to delay the progress of others (mostly\nChina) and give them time to define and create their own internal set of\nRISC-V security requirements for devices to be allowed access to their play\nstore. And to create and put in place RISC-V applications as a requirement for\nplay access for new applications as well as ARM. I guess what I am suggesting\nis that allowing RISC-V today without everything in place could reduce reduce\nGoogles telemetry slurping from RISC-V devices and income from pushing ads to\neyeballs in applications .\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

Jan says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 4:40 am\n\nAs if China was somehow limited to RISC-V or Android and didn\u2019t have\nalternatives since ages ago. That would make zero sense, esp. given how big\nmarket China is for Google.\n\nSuch speculations make no sense, especially in the light of what the\ndevelopers themselves (and not just Google management) said.\n\nThis is most likely simply a resource/manpower problem \u2013 similarly like they\ndiscontinued support for GPUs in Windows in Tensorflow recently. Basically if\nyou want to do machine learning with Tensorflow in Windows you must either use\nWSL/Docker or have no GPU acceleration. Or move to Linux which has first class\nsupport for it.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that while Google is huge, it was going through rounds of layoffs\nand many teams got axed. Plenty of projects are maintained by a team of a few\nengineers that simply don\u2019t have the means to support everything at once.\n\nSpecifically RISC-V is such case in the point \u2013 with the ISA allowing optional\nproprietary extensions, those have, of course, proliferated. This is great for\ncompanies tailoring the ISA for their microcontrollers and SoCs, so that they\nhave unique selling points \u2013 and a bloody nightmare for every\ntooling/middleware vendor. Supporting that is a royal PITA because everything\nhas to be compiled, tested and integrated multiple times, sapping resources.\nIt is not only Google/Android affected but also compiler vendors (GCC ...).\n\nIt was bad enough when Android software had to support multiple ARM\ninstruction sets (ARMv6, ARMv7, with NEON extensions/without, later AArch64)\nand also x86 for a while. They have also deprecated/removed support for the\nolder ones now. Given how niche RISC-V is in this market (as opposed to low\nend microcontrollers) it doesn\u2019t surprise that they have simply decided to ax\nthe whole thing outright.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    4. D says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 5:29 am\n\nGoogle only maintains an ARM kernel branch to include hardware support for\ntheir phones and tablets, because for years the official kernel wouldn\u2019t.\nGoogle also forked a RISC-V branch but there are no changes in it, it is\nidentical to the official kernel, so they deleted their copy. The reason there\nwere no changes is because no hardware exists to run android on, and thus\nthere are no drivers for non-existent hardware, so there is nothing to add\ninto their kernel fork.\n\nIf ever some hardware manufacturer decides to make a risc-v phone, and then\nthey write drivers for their custom stuff, one of two things will happen. The\nmanufacturer will write drivers and put them in their own copy of the linux\nkernel, and/or, they ask google to do it for them, at which point google can\nclick a button and recreate a new linux kernel fork again.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  3. MrSVCD says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 10:32 pm\n\nI wished that RISC-V had learned from ARMs mistake and had set a standard for\nwhat is in a \u201cPC\u201d cpu core and how it boots. The IBM PC accidentally set the\nstandard but it has been really use for end users.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. Daid says:\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 1:17 am\n\nBooting is only a tiny fraction of what makes PC different from ARM (and most\nother platforms). A much bigger aspect is plug-and-play, or autodetection of\navailable hardware. On PC, you can just auto detect whatever hardware is\navailable. On ARM, you need a device tree that describes this to your kernel,\nwhich pretty much makes it impossible to make a single distribution that you\ncan deploy to a lot of hardware.\n\nIt\u2019s why Ubuntu installs on any PC hardware, and only on Raspberry Pi ARM\nhardware.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.\n(Comment Policy)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
