Let's dive in all the new exciting things\nthat you can find in this new release!\n\n# What's new?\n\n## XEP-0386: Bind 2, XEP-0388: Extensible SASL Profile and XEP-0474: SASL\nSCRAM Downgrade Protection\n\nMovim was definitely not the first one integrating those XMPP extensions but\ntheir implementation finally brings a much modern authentication stack to the\nproject.\n\nBind 2 and Extensible SASL Profile greatly simplifies the authentication flow\nallowing Movim to connect (and reconnect) even faster, don't worry the older\nmethod is still there and will allow you to connect on #XMPP servers that\ndon't support yet this new mechanism.\n\nSASL SCRAM Downgrade Protection is a small security layer that sits on top of\nSASL (the authentication framework used by XMPP) to prevent channel-binding\ndowngrades attack during the handshakes methods. It starts to be enforced by\nseveral servers nowadays such as ejabberd.\n\nWe would like to thank fabiang that did an awesome work on the #PHP #SASL\nlibrary to add the SCRAM Downgrade Protection to it and allow a proper\nintegration of the feature in Movim. Thanks!\n\n## Complete internal page navigation loading refactoring\n\nYou may not have not have seen it but a big #refactoring work was done under\nthe hood to greatly simplify the navigation system in Movim.\n\nThis allows you to have a working and reliable \"back-button\" experience across\nthe user interface. It is actually especially noticeable on mobile where the\nback button is used a lot to switch between the different UI elements\n(drawers, pages, sliders...).\n\nThis refactoring also fixed a few important bugs regarding the user interface\ninternal events that were creating weird behaviors. For example, in some\ncases, when you were loading several time the same page in a row, the same\nevent was attached also several time to some buttons creating an event mess\nwhen clicking on it.\n\nAnd finally the browser - server connection (that relies on a Websocket) was\nalso refactored and simplified also fixing numerous connectivity bugs that we\nhad until now.\n\n## Changes when publishing an article\n\nThe post publication form was slightly reorganized. The post privacy toggle\nwas more clearly defined and another one, to disable comments and like, was\nadded next to it.\n\n## Interface improvements\n\nSince its big rewrite in 2014 Movim always relied on the Google #Material\nDesign system. This version continue the integration of Material 3 with the\nredesign of the search and chat boxes as well as small form and buttons\ndetails.\n\nA new placeholder was also added when starting a new chat allowing you to\nquickly add the user to your contact list or block him.\n\n## Other fixes and improvements\n\nA few #OMEMO bugs were also fixed, especially the bug #1261 that were\npreventing Movim users to decrypt their own messages in chatrooms.\n\nAn annoying video-conferencing bug (#1274) was preventing Movim to accept some\nspecific audio and video calls was fixed. This allows Movim to process calls\nproperly coming from #SIP bridges and to connect with SIP clients like\nLinphone !\n\nWe would like to especially thanks toastal for his several contributions to\nthe project including internal image size picture management, a big refactor\nof the internal language management system and some more minor interface and\nperformances fixes.\n\n# What's next?\n\nThis version prepared the last important bricks required to introduce the\nearly step of the big audio and video-conferencing incoming refactoring,\nespecially with all the navigation and interface internal events management\nthat was done the past few releases.\n\nWe will tell you more about it soon, stay tuned!\n\nIn the meantime, please share the good news around and don't forget to update\nyour server if you're an admin!\n\nThat's all folks!\n\n    * tagxmpp tagomemo tagphp tagsip tagsasl tagmaterial tag1261 tagrefactoring\n\n    * favorite\n\n3 Like\n\ndebacle, Lyn, Blue\n\n    * 1 Comments\n\n    * 21:44 debacle\n\nCongratulations, edhelas!\n\n  * cloud_queue\n\nPowered by Movim\n\n", "frontpage": false}
