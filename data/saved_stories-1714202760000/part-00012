That\u2019s a 65% gain\nfrom Q4 2023, and a roughly fourfold increase from Q3, during which investment\nhit a multiyear low.\n\nFor perspective, we charted out quarterly gaming-related early-stage\ninvestment for the past several quarters below.\n\nJosh Chapman, managing partner at gaming-focused startup investor Konvoy\nVentures, isn\u2019t surprised to see the numbers tick higher.\n\n\u201cI think the industry has bottomed out from a funding perspective, and we\u2019re\nnow coming back to a pre-COVID norm,\u201d he told Crunchbase News.\n\nChapman observed that unlike other sectors that saw a pandemic-inspired boost\nand subsequent slowdown, like takeout or connected fitness, gaming\u2019s\npopularity hasn\u2019t receded.\n\nCertainly revenue is trending higher. Global video game industry revenue hit a\nrecord of over $400 billion in 2023, per Statistica, and is forecast to exceed\n$450 billion this year. The worldwide population of mobile gamers, meanwhile,\nis estimated at nearly 2 billion people.\n\nDry powder for startup investment also got a boost last week as venture\nheavyweight Andreessen Horowitz announced that it raised $600 million for a\ngaming-focused fund. The fund was part of a $7.2 billion total fundraise\nacross multiple new investment vehicles. Also this month, Bitkraft Ventures,\nan early stage gaming-focused investor, picked up $275 million for its third\nfund.\n\n## Who\u2019s getting funded\n\nTo some degree, we\u2019re also seeing a return of big rounds. So far this year,\ninvestors have backed two nine-figure rounds for gaming startups, per\nCrunchbase.\n\nThe largest went to Edinburgh-based Build A Rocket Boy, which raised more than\n$110 million in Series D funding in January. The company is working on an\nimmersive gaming platform, a high-end game series, and a set of design tools\nfor user-generated content.\n\nAlso in January, Irvine, California-headquartered Second Dinner Studios closed\non $100 million in Series B funding led by Griffin Gaming Partners. The game\ndevelopment studio is behind the popular game Marvel Snap, which has been\ndownloaded more than 22 million times since its launch in 2022.\n\nChapman believes we\u2019re in a bullish period for independent game developers,\nwho have proven of late they\u2019re capable of competing with the big names. In\n2024, per Konvoy, five of the 10 highest-grossing titles on gaming hub Steam\n(Palword, Granblue, Last Epoch, Lethal Company and Enshrouded) were created by\nindie studios.\n\nLarge-scale layoffs and spending cuts carried out by big gaming brands in\nrecent quarters have put some much-anticipated releases behind schedule, which\nhas also helped redirect attention to titles from smaller studios, per\nChapman. Indies are also benefiting from easier-to-use developer tools, which\nputs a premium on creative talent over technical proficiency.\n\n## So when are the exits coming?\n\nIt\u2019s not the worst environment for exits either. While the tech IPO market\nremains rather quiet, Reddit\u2019s well-received debut last month shows there is\ninvestor appetite for well-known names and consumer-facing properties.\n\nFor the gaming industry, it helps that there\u2019s currently a good-sized list of\ncompanies with the reach and brand recognition to launch potentially\nsuccessful IPOs.\n\nOf these, the most hotly anticipated is Fortnite creator Epic Games, which has\nremained private since its inception in 1991. While the company is in no need\nof cash, having picked up $1.5 billion from Disney in February, it certainly\nchecks all the boxes for a massive IPO should it decide to take that route.\n\nValve, another big gaming name founded in the 1990s, also features on the\nshortlist. Somewhat newer companies on the list include Discord, founded in\n2015, and Niantic, founded in 2010.\n\nWe could also see some big startup acquisitions. Clearly public companies are\ngetting snapped up for enormous sums, as evidenced by Microsoft\u2019s $69 billion\npurchase of Activision Blizzard. Cash-rich tech and media giants with gaming\ndivisions could also easily direct some of their reserves to private\ncompanies. Big gaming brands could do the same.\n\n## Still a long way down from the peak\n\nWhile there\u2019s room for optimism around a modest uptick in gaming-related\nstartup funding, we\u2019re still far, far below peak.\n\nIn 2021, a record period for global venture investment, over $1.9 billion went\nto early-stage gaming deals in the last three months of the year alone.\nInvestment would have to increase more than sixfold from current quarterly\nfunding levels to get back there.\n\nExpectations among investors, however, have changed. In the current climate,\nsequential growth in deal count and total funding is encouragement enough for\ninvestors, though a few big exits couldn\u2019t hurt.\n\n## Related Crunchbase Pro list:\n\n  * Early-Stage Gaming-Related Funding Rounds\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman\n\nStay up to date with recent funding rounds, acquisitions, and more with the\nCrunchbase Daily.\n\n#### You may also like\n\nArtificial intelligence \u2022 Cybersecurity \u2022 Health, Wellness & Biotech \u2022\nStartups \u2022 Venture\n\n## The Week\u2019s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Xaira And Other AI Startups Have Huge\nWeek\n\nChris Metinko\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\nAfter a slowdown in big rounds last week, investors were back at it again\ndishing out nine-figure rounds.
