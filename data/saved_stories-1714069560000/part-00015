Oh well, I need to publish in the\nnext ten minutes so we\u2019re stuck with it!\n\nI first became interested in the cost of being a public figure when I read\nCorruptible by\n\nBrian Klaas\n\na few years ago.\n\nKlaas argues that perverse systems in society cause us to end up with leaders\nwho exhibit a dark triad of characteristics \u2014 narcissism, Machiavellianism,\nand psychopathy.\n\nA very concrete, and current, example of these systems is the ability for AI\nto generate deepfakes. It\u2019s now clear that:\n\n  1. Minimal voice and face recordings are needed to create convincing deepfakes\n\n  2. The more recordings you allow, the higher the deepfake quality will be\n\n  3. AI tools to create deepfakes are already in the hands of bad actors\n\nThis means that every day AI deepfake technology improves and proliferates, so\nwill the cost to being a public figure. Every new voice and face recording you\nallow will open you up to increasing risk of deepfakes to misrepresent,\nhumiliate, threaten, or undermine you.\n\nThat\u2019s one hell of a cost \u2014 and if internet trolls are anything to go by,\nit\u2019ll be higher for women, LGBTQ+ people, ethnic minorities and other groups\nthat are frequently targeted. It\u2019ll also be higher simply for people who don\u2019t\nhave thick skins.\n\nOn the other hand, the kinds of people Klaas talks about \u2014 narcissist\nMacchievellian psychopaths \u2014 won\u2019t be that bothered by these costs. Just\nanother day in the life. Their thick skins come hardwired.\n\nGiven this is the case, we urgently need government and philanthropic\nintervention not just to regulate against deepfakes, but to help people into\npublic figurehood who are put off by the increasing costs.\n\nThose people will self-censor. We won\u2019t even know they didn\u2019t make it to the\npublic sphere because they\u2019ll have looked ahead to their deepfake-filled\nfuture and said \u2018Hmm, thanks but no thanks\u2019, opting out before we know they\nexist. We need to create incentives so that opting in is more appealing, less\nterrifying.\n\nAnd to clarify, this is not just about who decides to become a politician. The\nthreat of deepfakes will skew who gets far in any field where it\u2019s useful to\nexist in public. That\u2019s a lot of fields: being a successful journalist, making\nit as an influencer, becoming a startup founder, being CEO of a big business.\n\nYou\u2019ve always needed a thick skin to be a public figure. But now we\u2019re talking\nabout needing tank-grade ultra-hardened steel skin.\n\nQuickly: subscribe?\n\nSide note: what do deepfakes mean for those of us who don\u2019t want to be public\nfigures?\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019re not off the hook. At minimum, we\u2019re at risk of fraud,\nidentity theft, blackmail and plenty of other nasty surprises. What this means\nis that we should think twice before ever, and I mean ever, allowing any\npublic recording of our voice or face to exist. That includes static images of\nour faces, since enough of these will do the trick just fine for deepfakes.\n\nDoing that is extremely hard. These days you can seem rude or weird if you opt\nout of a picture or video that you won\u2019t be able to control the distribution\nof (\u201cSorry, please stop filming me for your fun Instagram Reel\u201d). And maybe\nit\u2019s fine to let it go a couple of times. But it\u2019s important to be aware that\nevery time you allow a recording of your voice or face, you\u2019re making a choice\nthat increases your risk of deepfakes.\n\nAnd now that I\u2019m really enjoying getting into the swing of doom-mongering,\nI\u2019ll say that we should extend caution even to private recordings of us \u2014 be\ncareful who you share them with.\n\nBasically, unless you fill up a backpack with tuna cans and go live in a log\ncabin in Alaska, you\u2019re screwed. Thank you and have a great week!\n\n### Subscribe to 12 Challenges\n\nBy Louis \u00b7 Launched 5 months ago\n\n...to make the internet a bit better, by a guy who uses it\n\n2 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n2\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Every day, AI increases the cost of being a public figure\n\n12challenges.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nHow to deal with receiving a cease-and-desist letter from Big Tech\n\nAlthough this article isn\u2019t related to any of the 12 Challenges so far, it\u2019s\non a subject I\u2019m developing for a potential future challenge.
