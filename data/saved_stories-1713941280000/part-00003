It was developed by the Braille Institute of America in\ncollaboration with Applied Design Works and is available under the SIL Open\nFont License. It won Fast Company's Innovation by Design Award for Graphic\nDesign in 2019 and was shortlisted for a graphic design award by Dezeen in\n2020.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe font's normal appearance above, and a blur effect simulating how the same\nletters might appear to someone with a low-vision condition below.\n\nThe project began as part of a visual rebranding at the Braille Institute,^[1]\nwhich contracted the studio Applied Design Works to work with a specialist in\nlow-vision conditions from the Braille Institute and a panel of people with\nsuch conditions.^[2] Most students that the Braille Institute works with are\nnot fully blind and do not use the tactile writing system with which the\ninstitute shares a name.^[3] Applied Design Works looked for a typeface that\nwould suit the Braille Institute's needs but were unable to find one.^[3]\nExperimenting with both serif and sans-serif fonts including Times New Roman\nand Frutiger, they found that distinguishing among homoglyphs, and even among\nsome characters that do not appear very similar to fully sighted people, was\ndifficult for partially visually impaired people because of these fonts' focus\non uniformity. Thus the project shifted to creating a typeface that would be\nas legible as possible for the community the Braille Institute serves.^[1]\n\nApplied Design Works' creative director, Craig Dobie, put Elliott Scott in\ncharge of designing the typeface.^[1] Building around a grotesque sans-serif\ncore,^[4] the Applied Designs Works team worked to make sure that none of the\ntypeface's glyphs could be mistaken for any other, consulting with clients of\nthe Braille Institute and familiarizing themselves with research into\nlegibility.^[3] The Braille Institute named the finished product after the\ninstitute's founder, J. Robert Atkinson,^[5] and released it on its website\nthrough a custom license;^[6] in 2021, they made it available through Google\nFonts under the SIL Open Font License.^[7]^[8]\n\nIn 2019, Atkinson Hyperlegible won Fast Company's Innovation by Design Award\nfor Graphic Design.^[1] The next year, it was shortlisted for a graphic design\naward by Dezeen,^[9] losing to a series of heat-reactive stamps that\nillustrate climate change.^[10]\n\n## Design[edit]\n\nAtkinson Hyperlegible uses many circles, in a nod to braille.\n\nAtkinson Hyperlegible contains four styles, each of 335 glyphs: regular, bold,\nitalics, and italics bold. It supports diacritics in 27 languages.^[4]\n\nElliott Scott of Applied Design Works and studio creative director Craig Dobie\nmade the decision \"to break a lot of rules that a lot of designers will care\nabout\",^[1] for instance adding serifs to the uppercase i but not the\nuppercase tee^[2] and giving the uppercase ef a significantly longer tie\n(middle bar) than the uppercase e.^[1] Mark Wilson of Fast Company writes:^[1]\n\n> Stare too long at its quirks, and Atkinson Hyperlegible almost feels like it\n> has an identity crisis, as if a dozen fonts were smashed together to make\n> one. But typed out on a page, it's been treated with careful kerning that\n> the average eye just kind of accepts, as if it was any other typeface.\n\nOther efforts to make letters distinct include exaggerating letters' shapes\nand angling their spurs. There are many circles in Atkinson Hyperlegible, a\nnod to braille dots and the Braille Institute.^[2]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g Wilson, Mark (19 September 2019). \"This typeface hides a secret in plain sight.
