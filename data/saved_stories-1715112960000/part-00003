It is largely names and bank details that have been exposed.\n\nAll salaries will be paid this month.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said it \"firmly opposes and fights all forms of cyber\nattacks\" and \"rejects the use of this issue politically to smear other\ncountries\".\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n0:20\n\nChina: Hacking allegations 'absurd'\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry's spokesperson Lin Jian said Beijing 'opposes all\nforms of cyberattacks'.\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 0:20\n\nLoaded: 28.84%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nRemaining Time -0:20\n\n1x\n\n  * Chapters\n\n  * descriptions off, selected\n\n  * Captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n  * Captions off, selected\n\n  * en (Main), selected\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

At the same\ntime, I recognise and, of course, China is a very important economic player\nglobally and, of course, big global challenges like climate change need to\nhave China at the table, if we are to resolve those as well.\"\n\nMaking a speech in the Commons in March, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden\nrevealed the two previous incidents involved an attack on the Electoral\nCommission - responsible for overseeing elections and political finance - in\n2021, and targeted attacks against China-sceptic MPs.\n\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said there are \"so many serious\nquestions for the defence secretary on this, especially from Forces personnel\nwhose details were targeted\".\n\nHe added: \"Any such hostile action is utterly unacceptable.\n\n\"Parliament will expect a full Commons statement tomorrow.\"\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith, a Conservative MP and former soldier who has been\nsanctioned by China, told Sky News: \"This is yet another example of why the UK\ngovernment must admit that China poses a systemic threat to the UK and change\nthe integrated review to reflect that.\n\n\"No more pretence, it is a malign actor, supporting Russia with money and\nmilitary equipment, working with Iran and North Korea in a new axis of\ntotalitarian states.\"\n\nMr Ellwood said: \"We are learning the hard way how art warfare is rapidly\nchanging as technology advances.\n\n\"Defending the digital terrain is now just as important as the physical - this\nis another reminder why we need to invest more in defence and security.\n\n\"Targeting the MoD's payroll and bank details was probably looking at the\nfinancially vulnerable with a view that they may be coerced in exchange for\ncash.\n\n\"And if this type of cyberattack is taking place here in the UK we can assume\nother nato countries will be targeted too.\"\n\nImage: China's president Xi Jinping is currently on a tour of Europe.
