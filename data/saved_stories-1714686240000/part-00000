My training is as an industrial designer, so that is often the focus\nof these videos. But really, the philosophy and theory can be applied to any\ndesign discipline. I cover things like product design analysis, design\nprinciples, form language, portfolio reviews, and many other design-related\ntopics. Whether you're a designer who's been in the field for 30 years or a\nfreshman at design school, I can promise that you will learn something about\ndesign. If that sounds interesting to you, subscribe to my channel! Design\nTheory is run by John Mauriello. I'm an industrial designer and adjunct\nprofessor of industrial design at California College of the Arts. I have done\ndesign work for some of the biggest brands in the world, including Amazon,\nLogitech, Motorola, Qualcomm, Kohler, and dozens of up-and-coming startups.\n\nHow Governments Use Design & Propaganda to Control You\n\n42:21\n\nJohn Mauriello's Patreon\n\npatreon.com\n\nSupport\n\nDesign Theory\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribed\n\nShare\n\nAn error occurred while retrieving sharing information.

The\npaperclip, the Bic pen, the QWERTY keyboard layout, and even the PlayStation\ncontroller. Decades and sometimes even centuries pass, but these designs\nbarely change at all.
