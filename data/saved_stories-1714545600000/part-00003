Many pack in a decent amount of\nprocessing power, so why not get them to do something useful and earn some\ncash for the company as well?\n\nSpeaking on the conference call, Musk said that he thought most Teslas were\nprobably used for about a third of the hours in a week.\n\n\"But then there's certainly going to be some hours left for charging and\ncleaning and maintenance in that world, you can do a lot of other workloads,\"\nadded Tesla's Director of Autopilot Software, Ashok Elluswamy.\n\nHe claimed that AI companies have batch workloads where they send \"a bunch of\ndocuments\" that are run through large neural networks and \"take a lot of\ncompute to chunk through.\"\n\n\"And now that we have already paid for this compute in these cars, it might be\nwise to use them and not let them be, like, buying a lot of expensive\nmachinery and leaving to them idle. We don't want that. We want to use the\ncomputer as much as possible and close to like basically 100 percent of the\ntime to make full use of it,\" Elluswamy said.\n\n\"It takes a lot of intelligence to drive the car anyway. And when it's not\ndriving the car, you just put this intelligence to other uses, solving\nscientific problems like a human or answering dumb questions for someone\nelse,\" he added.\n\nMusk compared it to Amazon Web Services, saying that people didn't foresee\nthat AWS would become the most valuable part of Amazon.\n\n\"They [Amazon] found that they had excess compute because the compute needs\nwould spike to extreme levels for brief periods of the year, and then they had\nidle compute for the rest of the year. So what should they do with that excess\ncompute for the rest of the year? That's kind of, yeah, monetize it,\" Musk\nexplained.\n\n\"If you get, like, to the 100 million vehicle level, which I think we will at\nsome point get to, and you've got a kilowatt of usable compute \u2013 I think you\ncould have on the order of 100 gigawatts of useful compute, which might be\nmore than anyone, more than any company, probably more than any company,\" he\nmused.\n\nOf course, all this compute capacity isn't sitting conveniently clustered\ntogether in a datacenter. It is distributed here and there, reached via a\ncellular connection in each Tesla, or possibly via Wi-Fi if the car is on the\nowner's driveway.\n\n  * Musk schmoozes Chinese Premier as Tesla Full Self-Driving remains parked\n  * Musk moves Tesla's goalposts, investors happily move shares higher\n  * Tesla misses the mark on all fronts in quarter of chaos\n  * Tesla slashes vehicle and self-driving-ish software prices as shares plummet\n\nSo the model Tesla would be looking at is perhaps more akin to edge computing,\nsuch as Heata in the UK, which uses heat from servers in homes to provide\ndomestic hot water and rents out the compute capacity via cloud company Civo.\n\nAmong the issues we can see is that Tesla would be effectively using\nelectricity that the car owner has paid for to run any workloads while it is\nidle, so would they get a cut of the money generated?\n\nYes, it seems. CFO Vaibhav Taneja, said \"the capex is shared by the entire\nworld. Sort of everyone owns a small chunk, and they get a small profit out of\nit maybe.\"\n\nWould Tesla owners be able to opt out if they didn't want their vehicle used\nthis way? That wasn't answered but it seems likely, that is, if the plan ever\ngets off the drawing board. There's no guarantee that it will actually come to\nfruition, for various reasons.\n\nIDC Senior Research Director for Digital Infrastructure Andrew Buss said the\nidea sounds technically feasible, but the potential downsides are perhaps too\nbig to justify it being actually implemented.\n\n\"They'd not even be edge processing nodes as the code and data would have to\nbe centrally managed and stored and then packaged and sent for processing\nbefore being returned once complete,\" he told The Register.\n\nOther downsides include third-party code and data running on a private asset,\nBuss said, and if taking power from the battery, this would accelerate the\ndegradation of these, which are the single most expensive and crucial part of\na Tesla and need to be kept in as optimal a shape as possible for longevity\nand consistency of range.\n\nIn other words, Tesla might well find that implementing this idea may prove\nmore trouble than it is actually worth for the returns it generates.\n\nAnd as The Register noted after the earnings conference, Elon has a habit of\nthrowing out wild ideas when things aren't going well to distract the punters\nand energize investors. This could well be one of them. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * AWS\n  * Edge Computing\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * AWS\n  * Edge Computing\n  * Tesla\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Autopilot\n  * AWS Graviton\n  * EC2\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * S3\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * 6G\n  * Amazon\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Jeff Bezos\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n46 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * AWS\n  * Edge Computing\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * AWS\n  * Edge Computing\n  * Tesla\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Autopilot\n  * AWS Graviton\n  * EC2\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * S3\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * 6G\n  * Amazon\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Jeff Bezos\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### With Run:ai acquisition, Nvidia aims to manage your AI kubes\n\nNow Jensen has a control plane to play with his army of NIMs\n\nAI + ML6 days |\n\n#### Amazon to blow $11B on cluster of Indiana bit barns\n\nTalk about going round the (South) Bend\n\nPaaS + IaaS5 days | 4\n\n#### Forget the AI doom and hype, let's make computers useful\n\nSystems Approach Machine learning has its place, just not in ways that suits\ntoday's hypesters\n\nSoftware6 days | 59\n\n#### Java thriving after 30 years\n\nWhy OpenJDK is as important as ever in the big picture of IT\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Don't rent out that container ship yet: CIOs and biz buyers view AI PCs\nwith some caution\n\nRisky bet?
