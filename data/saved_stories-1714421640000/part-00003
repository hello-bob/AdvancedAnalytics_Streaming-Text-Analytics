We aim to examine co-offending by\nusing relational hyper event models (RHEM) to determine what additional\ninsights can be discerned on co-offending above and beyond more traditional\nnetwork approaches.\n\n### Methods\n\nUsing de-identified police recorded incident data for affiliates of OMCGs in\nNew South Wales, Australia, including their rank and club affiliation, we\nexamined the positioning of OMCG affiliates in co-offending network\nstructures. The data comprised 2,364 nodes and 12,564 arrest events. We argue\nthat Relational Hyperevent Models (RHEM) are the optimal analytical strategy\nfor co-offending data as it overcomes some of the limitations of traditional\nco-offending analyses.\n\n### Results\n\nWe conducted RHEM modelling and found that co-offending networks were stable\nover time, whereby actors tended to repeatedly co-offend with the same\npartners. Lower ranked members were more likely to engage in co-offending\ncompared with office bearers.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nResults provide some support for the scenario in which OMCGs operate as\ncriminal organisations, but also the protection and distance from offending\nthat is afforded to office bearers. We review implications of the results for\nlaw enforcement policy and practice and for the scholarship of OMCGs.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### When Things Turn Sour: A Network Event Study of Organized Crime Violence\n\nArticle Open access 12 April 2022\n\n### Co-offending networks among members of outlaw motorcycle gangs across\ntypes of crime\n\nArticle Open access 11 October 2022\n\n### Targeting the Most Harmful Co-Offenders in Denmark: a Social Network\nAnalysis Approach\n\nArticle Open access 08 May 2019\n\nUse our pre-submission checklist\n\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn many countries, including the United States and Australia, outlaw\nmotorcycle gangs (OMCGs) are implicated in a range of criminal activities\nincluding the production and distribution of illicit drugs, firearms\ntrafficking, serious violent crime, tax evasion and money laundering (e.g.,\nMorgan et al. 2020; Quinn and Forsyth 2009; Quinn and Koch 2003).While the\nlast few years have seen a notable increase in research on the criminal\nactivities of those affiliated with OMCGs (e.g., Blokland et al. 2017, 2019;\nMorgan et al. 2020), little is known about co-offending among OMCG affiliates.\nThis includes the extent of co-offending within and between OMCGs, which may\ninvolve collaborating or competing for stakes in illicit markets, and the role\nof those who occupy leadership positions in clubs (known as \u2018office bearers\u2019)\nin such co-offending. This paper presents an exploratory study to examine co-\noffending across different ranks within and between OMCG groups in the\nAustralian state of New South Wales (NSW). Differing from prior research, we\naim to examine co-offending by using relational hyper event models (RHEM) to\ndetermine what additional insights can be discerned on co-offending above and\nbeyond more traditional network approaches. However, our approach is not\natheoretical: we derive a set of research questions based on existing theory\nand research, and we conduct empirical tests using RHEM as an illustration for\nother researchers who might consider applying RHEM for studies on co-offending\nnetworks. This innovative approach to the analysis of co-offending data can\nserve as a model for future research on co-offending networks across a range\nof contexts (e.g., juveniles, types of offending).\n\nFirst, we provide an overview of the state of knowledge on OMCGs and on co-\noffending. Second, we discuss the current study, applying RHEM to sequences of\nco-arrest events, and how it contributes to our understanding of OMCGs\nspecifically, and co-offending networks generally. Third, we provide an\noverview of results and discuss them in the context of existing literature on\noffending and co-offending among OMCG members. Fourth, we briefly compare RHEM\nwith two alternative (and more established) approaches to the analyses of co-\noffending data: relational event models (REM) for dyadic interaction events\nand temporal exponential random graph models (TERGM). Finally, we conclude the\npaper and offer some implications for theory and practice.\n\n### Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs\n\nMuch of the research on criminality among OMCG affiliates analyses individual-\nlevel information on recorded offending (e.g., Blokland et al. 2019, 2020;\nKlement 2016a; 2016b; Morgan et al. 2020). This research has found that most\nOMCG members have histories of offending. Much of the criminal activity of\naffiliates is a by-product of their everyday lives within the outlaw\n\u2018barbarian\u2019 cultures of OMCGs, including fighting, traffic violations, drug\npossession and disorderly conduct (von Lampe and Blokland 2020). However,\nempirical studies have shown that involvement in more serious violent and\norganised crime is also common. Unfortunately, research on individual-level\ncriminality does not address the question of how OMCG affiliates collaborate\nin crime, or of the role that club structures and hierarchies play in these\ncollaborations. OMCGs are highly structured, with formal hierarchies\nconsisting of various executive office bearing roles such as presidents, vice\npresidents and sergeants-at-arms, along with regular members and prospective\nmembers at the bottom. Office bearers oversee the semi-independent regional\nchapters of OMCGs, while club-level office-bearers manage clubs at a national\nand international level. These governance mechanisms have been assumed by\ngovernments and police forces to play a significant role in the crimes of OMCG\naffiliates, and significant effort has gone into disrupting the structures and\nhierarchies of OMCGs (Bartels et al. 2021). However, there is ongoing debate\nin the literature as to the importance of these structures and hierarchies to\nthe offending of OMCG affiliates (von Lampe and Blokland 2020).\n\nVon Lampe and Blokland (2020) suggest three possible ideal scenarios regarding\nthe nature of criminal collaboration within OMCGs, and its relationship with\nclub structures and hierarchies: (1) the \u2018rotten apples\u2019 scenario in which\nindividual members act alone or in collaboration with other members or non-\nmembers to commit crime, outside of club structures and hierarchies; (2) the\n\u2018club within a club\u2019 scenario where there is some overlap between the\norganizational structure of the group and criminal activity networks. In this\ncase, authority within the criminal networks is driven by network position\nrather than formal hierarchical position; and (3) the \u2018club as criminal\norganization\u2019 in which the club is organized for the purpose of committing\ncrime and office bearers authorize and direct criminal activity. These three\nscenarios are not mutually exclusive and hybrid versions of the three\nscenarios may exist within any one club, or shifts may be observed between the\nscenarios across time. The same OMCG club may show evidence of one, two or all\nof the scenarios depending on the specific context and the manner in which\ncriminal activities are undertaken in that club (see also van Deuren et al.\n2022). In their systematic review of the literature, Bright and Deegan (2021)\nsuggest that when OMCG members engage in crime, they tend to operate in small\nnetworks that may include other OMCG members. Von Lampe and Blokland (2020)\nalso note that the structures and formal hierarchies of OMCGs are not well\nadapted to maintaining the secrecy and security necessary for organized crime\nand may explain why small informal networks are utilized by OMCG members\ninstead of OMCGs operating as criminal organizations.\n\nSome studies have drawn attention to the role of OMCGs as facilitators of\ncrime, with membership being found to increase the risk of offending (Klement\n2016a, 2016b, 2019; van Deuren et al. 2021), and offending by affiliates being\nmore prevalent, frequent and serious than that of other motorcycle owners\n(Blokland et al. 2019). These findings hint at some level of criminal\ncollaboration within OMCGs, and at the role of club structures and hierarchies\nin enabling or directing it. However, in their in-depth analysis of OMCGs in\nthe Australian state of Queensland, Lauchs and Staines (2019) found that\ntwelve out of sixteen members in leadership positions were not involved in\norganized criminal activities, although four had significant involvement in\nthe manufacturing and trafficking of illicit drugs in collaboration with other\nmembers. They concluded that individuals in office bearer positions appeared\nto operate criminally within small networks or cliques. In another study,\nLauchs (2019) examined one specific chapter of an OMCG in Queensland and found\nthat only eleven out of 44 patched members had serious illicit drug-related\nconvictions, suggesting that these members operated alone or in small groups.\nTwo of the individuals involved in drug trafficking were office bearers,\nalthough no evidence was uncovered that the office bearers directed or\ncontrolled the activities. Eighty-three percent of members were not involved\nin organized criminal activities.\n\nBlokland et al. (2017), adopting a novel approach to address these questions,\nused official convictions data to examine the relative proportion of office\nbearing and non-office bearing members with criminal histories in 12 Dutch\nOMCGs. Most (8 clubs) had a high proportion of both office bearing and non-\noffice bearing members with a criminal history. Replicating this analysis, but\nlimiting it to organised crime-type offending, Morgan et al. (2020) found\neight of 28 Australian clubs had more than ten percent of office bearing and\nnon-office bearing members with a recent recorded history of this offending.\nThe assumption underpinning these analyses is that, where high proportions of\nboth office bearing and non-office bearing members within a club are engaged\nin crime, that club is likely to be operating as a criminal organization, as\ndefined by von Lampe and Blokland (2020). While not unreasonable, this\napproach is incomplete in its absence of any direct examination of criminal\ncollaboration, or of the importance of office bearers to these collaborations.\n\n### A Network Approach to Understanding Co-Offending\n\nA growing amount of criminological research is taking a network approach to\nstudy crime and better capture the structure and dynamics of co-offending\nrelationships. This approach emphasizes and facilitates analysis of the\nrelational elements of co-offending that are often missed in more\nindividually-focused methods. The methodological underpinning of this approach\nhas been social network analysis (SNA), which is a family of methods for\nmeasuring and graphically depicting complex sets of relationships between\nmultiple individuals, or actors. Analyses of co-offending networks can\ninvestigate theoretically relevant assumptions about social processes and\nstructural relationships that affect crime occurrence in ways that move beyond\nanalyses assuming offender independence. Co-offending network studies can also\nexamine social structure and processes in the context of actor attributes such\nas age and gender (see Bright et al. 2022b, c) and across crime types (e.g.,\nMorselli et al. 2015). In the case of OMCGs, additional attributes of\nparticular relevance include gang rank and co-offending across different\ngangs. The current study seeks to advance the literature on both co-offending\nand OMCGs by examining these aspects in an OMCG co-offending network\ndisaggregated by crime type, OMCG ranks, and offending within and between\ndifferent OMCG groups.\n\nResearch on co-offending networks has tended to rely on the same\nmethodological and analytical approach (e.g., Sarnecki 2001; Carrington 2009;\nMorselli et al. 2015; Bright et al. 2022c). In this approach, a two-mode\nnetwork is first constructed from data (e.g., arrest data) in which actors /\noffenders are tied to co-offending events (e.g., arrest events). Next, the\ntwo-mode network is transposed to a one-mode network in which all offenders\nwho are connected to the same crime event are considered to be co-offenders.\nThis one-mode projection of the two mode network results in only dyadic\nconnections between co-offenders who have been involved in the same crime\nevent. In other words, if actors a, b, and c were all arrested in event A,\nonce a one-mode projection is undertaken, we have dyadic connections between\na-b, b-c, and a-c.\n\nOnly a handful of previous studies have adopted a network approach to examine\nthe structure of co-offending among OMCG affiliates. In their analysis of co-\noffending within a Canadian OMCG, McNally and Alston (2006) found that\ncentrality metrics, measuring the number of direct connections actors have to\nother actors, did not mirror the formal hierarchy of the club. For example,\nwhile the vice president and president were among actors with high degree\ncentrality, other members of the leadership group did not have high degree\ncentrality scores. A later analysis of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club in\nCanada, and particularly its Nomad chapter, by Morselli (2009) found that most\nactors with high degree centrality scores held an official rank with the\ngroup. Higher ranking Nomad members however more commonly had high scores on\nbetweenness centrality, a measure of indirect as opposed to direct\nconnections, indicating that they were in strategic brokerage positions.\nMorselli (2009) concluded that the network only partially mirrored the formal\nhierarchical organization of the OMCG. Rostami and Mondani (2019) examined the\nco-offending networks of three Swedish OMCGs. In one group, when members co-\noffended with other members, they tended to do so with members of the same\nlocal chapter, while two other groups collaborated with members from chapters\nlocated across the country (Sweden). One club (Hells Angels) showed 15% of co-\noffending ties were to members of the same group, compared with 9% and 5% in\nthe other two groups. Rostami and Mondani (2019) suggest that this may explain\nwhy the Hells Angels were involved in more sophisticated crime types. They\nsuggested that having a higher proportion of in-house co-offending ties may\nenhance security and reduce the potential for detection and apprehension.\nCoutinho et al (2020) found that members of OMCG clubs are more likely to\ncollaborate across clubs when illicit markets in which they are involved\noverlap, suggesting that clubs have advanced capacity to coordinate criminal\nactivity. In a more recent paper Mondani and Rostami (2022) examined co-\noffending networks of Swedish OMCG members and found that individuals who were\nmembers of multiple OMCG clubs had higher centrality scores and showed greater\nclustering within the network compared with individuals who were members of a\nsingle club only. They concluded that individuals with multiple OMCG club\nmemberships tended to co-offend with members of different clubs.\n\nIn concluding this section, we note that some studies focus on a single\ncriminal case often using observational and wiretap data related that specific\ncase. In contrast, studies covering multiple years and many different cases\nusually describe a combined network that covers multiple, most likely\nsubstantively different, criminal events. Given the different data sources and\ntime windows, conclusions drawn from single case studies do not readily\ntranslate to studies covering multiple cases. For further discussion of these\nissues related to network data and analysis, the reader is directed to Bright\net al., (2022a).\n\n### Advances in the Analysis of Co-Offending Networks\n\nScholars have pointed out that this one-mode projection of a two-mode network\nleads to a loss of information, and alternative approaches have been put\nforward (Broccatelli et al. 2016; see also Borgatti and Everett 1997; Opsahl\n2013; Hollway and Koskinen 2016). Relational hyperevent models (RHEM) can\nanalyse data on co-offending events without projection to a one-mode network\nand without the need to aggregate events over (typically arbitrary) time\nintervals (Lerner et al. 2021; Lerner and Lomi 2022; see also Relational Event\nModels e.g., Butts 2008). In a nutshell, RHEM can specify and estimate for\nevery set of actors and every point in time a separate event rate (also known\nas hazard rate or intensity) based on exogenous or endogenous covariates. For\ninstance, the propensity of a set of actors {a, b, c} to co-offend at a given\npoint in time might depend on actor-level characteristics (e.g., average\nseniority of a, b, and c, difference in seniority of a, b, and c, or whether\nor not a, b, and c are members of the same group or gang) as well as on their\n(co-)offending history (e.g., average number of previous offenses, average\nnumber of previous co-offenses, pattern of previous co-offenses with yet other\nactors different from a, b, and c, and so on). RHEM build on hypergraphs \u2013 an\nextension of graphs in which multiple actors can be connected with a single\nevent, or hyperedge (see Fig. 1). One aim of this study was to examine the\npotential application of RHEMs to the analysis of co-offending networks. We\ncompare RHEM to other social network models that analyze derived dyadic co-\narrest networks, namely Relational Event Models (REM) and temporal exponential\nrandom graph models (TERGM). In a dyadic co-offending (or co-arrest) network,\nwhenever {a, b, c} get arrested in the same event, this generates three dyadic\nties: ab, ac, and bc. These dyadic networks could also be referred to as a\n\"one-mode projection\" (of a hypergraph or of a two-mode actor-event network).\n\nFig. 1\n\nA hypergraph as a sequence of hyperevents. A sequence of three hyperevents. At\ntimet1 actors a, b, and c are co-arrested. At time t2 actors c, d, and e are\nco-arrested. At time t3, b and d are co-arrested. The third event would\nindicate a closure effect in which actors b and d, having co-offended with a\ncommon third actor c, become co-offense partners\n\nFull size image\n\nWe argue that REM or RHEM are more appropriate for analyses of co-offending\nnetworks compared with social network models such as Exponential Random Graph\nModels (ERGM; Lusher et al. 2013) or Stochastic Actor Oriented Models (SAOM;\nKoskinen and Snijders 2022) since the data has fine-grained time stamps and is\nabout relational events (i.e., offences or arrests) rather than relational\nstates. In this paper we will compare results of analyses using RHEM with\nresults revealed using REM and TERGM. The advantages of RHEM over dyadic REM,\nmeanwhile, include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the ability to\ninclude single-actor arrests in the same analysis (note that these events do\nnot generate any dyadic events); (2) avoiding the potentially invalid\ninflation of observations (i.e., many dyadic events derived from the same\nmulti-actor event); (3) avoiding the potentially invalid assumption that\ndyadic events derived from the same multi-actor event (three or more actors)\nare independent; and (4) avoiding structural artefacts such as an over-\nrepresentation of closed triangles that stem from arrests that include three\nor more actors. Indeed, a recent study by Nieto et al (2022) demonstrated that\nthe traditional approach of using one-mode projections for co-offending data\ncan produce inflated transitivity values and clustering coefficients. We note\nthat (T)ERGM and SAOM are for networks of relational states (like \u201cbeing\nfriends\u201d, \u201chaving esteem for\u201d, etc.), whereas we argue that REM and RHEM are\noptimised for analyses using relational events (e.g., co-offending at a given\npoint in time). Moreover, REM, ERGM, TERGM and SAOM all require the\ntransformation of hyperevents into pairwise events (or pairwise edges).\n\nGiven ongoing research and policy interest in the extent to which OMCG co-\noffending networks overlap with the formal structures and hierarchies of\nclubs, the research was guided by the following questions: (1) Are office\nbearers more likely than lower ranked offenders to engage in co-offending,\noverall and across different offence types?; (2) Does co-offending tend to\noccur across or within member ranks, overall and across different offence\ntypes?; (3) Does co-offending tend to occur within or between members of\ndifferent OMCG gangs, overall and across different offence types?; (4) Does\nco-offending between OMCG members show evidence of network closure, that is, a\ntendency for co-offenders of one OMCG member to become co-offending partners,\noverall and across different offence types?\n\n## Method\n\n### Sample and Data\n\nDe-identified data for this research was provided by the New South Wales (NSW)\nPolice Force, and was linked with data from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics\nand Research (BOCSAR), and NSW Corrective Services. The de-identified data\nobtained from the NSW Police Force described offences in which police had\napprehended and proceeded against (through some form of legal action) an\nindividual who had some affiliation with an OMCG. This was linked with data\nfrom the BOCSAR and NSW Corrective Services on custodial episodes of OMCG\naffiliates. The data included the following: (1) alphanumeric person\nidentifiers (anonymized) denoting affiliates; (2) event reference numbers\n(anonymized) denoting crime events (i.e. arrests); (3) the date of the\nincident and legal action for each offence; (4) crime type, coded using\nAustralian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification divisions\n(Australian Bureau of Statistics 2018); (5) club affiliation at the time of\ndata extraction, denoted with a unique numeric club identifier; and (6)\naffiliate status/rank. The dataset contained information on 93,623 unique\ncrime events attributed to 5513 individuals.\n\n### Coding and Analysis\n\nAlthough data was available from 1995 to 2020, we included only data from 2015\nto 2020. In other words, we used only the most recent data to enhance the\nvalidity of club membership and rank information. The data used a static\nmeasure of rank, obtained at the time of data extraction (20th of May 2020).\nEvent reference numbers, allocated by Police at the time events (typically the\ndate when an offender was proceeded against), were recorded against person\nidentifiers and used to match individuals to offences. When an event reference\nnumber was recorded against two or more individuals, they were treated as co-\noffenders. The most serious charge within each event was used as an attribute\nfor ties between all individuals within that event. We classified\n\u2018seriousness\u2019 using the Standard Offence Index published by the Australian\nBureau of Statistics (2018) which ranks the seriousness of all offences. The\nmethod therefore allows for the translation of event-person links into an\nundirected co-offending network. The network is undirected because the links\nbetween individuals indicate only that they have co-offended together and\ntherefore have no direction.\n\nAll offences were classified into five offence categories (see Table 1)\nconsistent with previous research on OMCGs (e.g., Barker 2014; Voce et al.\n2021). This categorization facilitated analyses of collaboration networks by\ncrime types. Of particular interest were the offences of violence and\nintimidation and ongoing criminal enterprise as these offences are most\ncommonly associated with organized criminal activities and violence by OMCGs\n(Quinn and Koch 2003).\n\nTable 1 The five offence categories\n\nFull size table\n\nRanks of OMCG affiliates were classified according to information recorded in\nintelligence files. The following ranks were included in our analyses:\n\n  * Office bearer: A current fully patched member of an OMCG who occupies an executive role in their club (e.g., president, vice-present, sergeant-at-arms)\n\n  * Member: A current fully patched member of a club who is not in an office bearing role\n\n  * Nominee: Someone who is undertaking a probationary period seeking full membership of a club.\n\n  * Associate: An individual who is an associate of a club but not a nominee or member. These individuals may be seeking to undertake a period as nominee.\n\nIn the analysis, we coded these ranks numerically where the office bearer was\ncoded as 4, member as 3, nominee as 2, and associate as 1. Since we were also\ninterested in focusing on the office bearers, for the office bearers\u2019\nanalysis, we created a dummy variable where we coded the office bearers as 1\nand the lower ranks as 0.\n\nFinally, each individual was allocated to one of 26 de-identified clubs that\nwere active across the observation period, based on data provided by police.\nThese clubs were anonymized but refer to an umbrella name of a particular club\n(e.g., Hells Angels, Finks, Comancheros).\n\nWe therefore have data on a set of actors A (OMCG affiliates), n =|A|= 2364,\nover a period of five years, from 2015 to 2020. This set of actors does not\nchange over time and actors were attributed to only one club or only one rank\nover the five-year window. Additionally, we employ time-invariant actor-level\nattributes: rank (ordered nominal with four levels) and club (a categorical\nattribute inducing a partition of the set of actors into 26 discrete clubs).\nThese attributes were validated at the time of data extraction.\n\n## Models\n\nThe observation of central interest is a list of arrest events E = e_1, e_2,\n...,e_N (number of arrest events = N = 12,564, where each event e = (t_e, h_e,\nx_e) is a triple comprising the time of the arrest t_e (given by the day), the\nset of participants h_e of the arrest (each h_e is a subset of the entire set\nof actors A consisting of any number of OMCG members, from 1 to n, who are co-\narrested in the event), and x_e is the type of the event (which is the type of\nthe offense/crime). The same actors can be arrested several times during the\nfive-year observation period. Each set of co-arrested OMCG affiliates h_e\ngives rise to a hyperedge in the hypergraph whose nodes are the actors A.\nHyperedges in a hypergraph generalize edges in graphs: while an edge always\nconnects exactly two actors at a time, a hyperedge can connect any number of\nactors, from 1 to n =|A|. In the following we give the mathematical\ndescription of RHEM for arrest events of any type, that is, ignoring the event\ntype x_e. Transferring these definitions to arrest events of any given\nspecific type x is straightforward by removing events of all other types from\nE. The statistical framework underlying RHEM and dyadic REM (point-process\nmodels or survival models and in particular the Cox proportional hazard model,\n\u201cCoxPH\u201d) is covered exhaustively in Aalen et al (2008). The specifics of RHEM\nare given in Lerner et al (2021) and are repeated here for clarity.\n\n## Relational Hyper Event Models (RHEM)\n\nFor a point in time t, let E[< t] denote those events e in E, whose event time\nis strictly before t, that is, t_e < t. For each subset h of A, that is, each\npossible list of event participants, let the hazard rate (also event rate or\nintensity) of the counting process\n\n$$N_{t} \\left( h \\right) = \\left| {\\left\\\\{ {e \\in E\\left[ { < t}\n\\right]:h_{e} = h} \\right\\\\}} \\right|$$\n\nbe denoted by lambda(t,h), compare Aalen et al (2008). The hazard rate is\ndefined by:\n\n$${\\uplambda }\\left( {t,h} \\right) = \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{dt \\to 0}\n\\frac{{N_{t + dt} \\left( h \\right) - N_{t} \\left( h \\right)}}{dt}$$\n\nIntuitively, for small dt, the product dt*lambda(t,h) is the expected number\nof events e in the time interval [t, t + dt] whose set of participants is\nequal to h. Following the approach of the Cox proportional hazard model\n(CoxPH) the hazard is decomposed into a global baseline hazard lambda_0(t)\n(intuitively: average hazard over all hyperedges) and a parametric relative\nhazard rate lambda_1(t,h) \u2013 the factor by which the hazard on the given\nhyperedge h is higher or lower than the baseline.\n\n$${\\uplambda }\\left( {t,h} \\right) = {\\uplambda }_{0} \\left( t \\right) \\cdot\n{\\uplambda }_{1} \\left( {t,h} \\right)$$\n\nAlthough the baseline hazard could be estimated by non-parametric means, this\nis of little interest in our study. The baseline hazard is an incredibly small\nnumber due to the huge number of all subsets of A. In our study we are\ninterested in why some sets of actors co-offend at a higher or lower rate than\nothers \u2013 which is conveyed by the relative hazard.\n\nThe relative hazard is specified in parametric form as follows.\n\n$${\\uplambda }_{1} \\left( {t,h} \\right) = \\exp \\left( {\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j\n= 1}^{k} {\\uptheta }_{j} \\cdot s_{j} \\left( {t,h} \\right)} \\right)$$\n\nIn the formula above, s_j(t,h), j = 1,...,k is a vector of explanatory\nvariables (or hyperedge statistics) quantifying characteristics that might\nexplain why members of h co-offend at a higher or lower rate. These statistics\ncan be functions of actor-level characteristics (such as the average rank of\nmembers in h, the ratio of office bearers in h, or the ratio of pairs in h\nthat are in different gangs). Importantly, hyperedge statistics s_j(t,h) can\nalso be functions of the event history E[< t]. Examples of the latter include\nthe average number of previous arrests in which members of h were involved,\nthe average number of previous co-arrests in which pairs of members of h were\ninvolved, and so on (see definitions below). The parameters theta_j, j =\n1,...,k indicate whether and how these hyperedge statistics affect the event\nrate. More quantitatively, if s_j(t,h) = s_j(t,h\u2019) + 1, that is, if hyperedge\nh assumes a value in s_j that is by one unit higher than that of hyperedge h\u2019\n\u2013 and if these two hyperedges assume the same values in all other statistics \u2013\nthen lambda_1(t,h) = exp(theta_j)*lambda_1(t,h\u2019). If theta_j is positive, then\nexp(theta_j) > 1, so that the rate on h is higher, if theta_j is negative then\nexp(theta_j) < 1, so that the rate on h is lower, and if theta_j is\napproximately zero, then the value of s_j has no effect on event rates. Thus,\nexp(theta_j) is the hazard ratio (or relative risk factor) implied by\nstatistic s_j.\n\nThe parameters theta can be estimated from the data E by maximizing the\nfollowing partial likelihood; compare Aalen et al (2008) for general results\nabout the CoxPH model and Lerner et al (2021) for the special case of RHEM.\n\n$$L\\left( {\\uptheta } \\right) = \\mathop \\prod \\limits_{e \\in E}\n\\frac{{{\\uplambda }_{1} \\left( {t_{e} ,h_{e} } \\right)}}{{\\mathop \\sum\n\\nolimits_{{h \\in R_{e} }} {\\uplambda }_{1} \\left( {t_{e} ,h} \\right)}}$$\n\nThe so-called risk set R_e in the formula above is the set of hyperedges h to\nbe compared with the event hyperedge h_e. Since the set of all subsets of A\ngrows exponentially in |A|, we resort to case\u2013control sampling, which is a\nwell-established technique for estimating CoxPH models (Langholz and Borgan\n1997; Aalen et al 2008) and has been applied for estimating dyadic REM on\nlarge networks (Vu et al 2015; Lerner and Lomi 2020) and for estimating RHEM\n(Lerner et al 2021). Specifically, following the method suggested by Lerner et\nal (2021), the risk set R_e contains the event hyperedge h_e (the \u201ccase\u201d) plus\nm alternative hyperedges (\u201ccontrols\u201d) {h_1, ..., h_m}, sampled uniformly at\nrandom from the set of all subsets of A that have the same size as h_e. (In\nour empirical study we set m to 1000) The function L is called a partial\nlikelihood since it explains only part of the data: it cannot explain the\naverage rate of arrest events over all sets of actors (the baseline rate)\u2014that\nis, it cannot explain whether co-offense frequency goes up or down in the\nentire population\u2014but it can explain the hazard ratio by which a given set of\nactors is more or less likely to co-offend than another.\n\nBelow we list explanatory variables (hyperedge statistics) s(t,h) included in\nour models. See Lerner et al (2021) for precise mathematical definitions and\nfurther graphical illustration.\n\n  1. 1.\n\navg.#.arrests(t, h) is the average number of previous arrests (that is, arrest\nevents before time t) over the members of h. For instance, if h = {a, b, c} is\nthe set of actors a, b, and c and before time t, actor a has been arrested\nthree times, b has been arrested once, and c has never been arrested before,\nthen avg.#.arrests(t, {a, b, c}) = 4/3. Note that for avg.#.arrests it does\nnot matter whether the previous arrest events involve just a single actor (a,\nb, or c, respectively) or whether these actors have been co-arrested with\nothers within or outside of the set h. The statistic avg.#.arrests models\nvariation in the \u201carrest-activity\u201d of actors. A positive parameter of this\nstatistic would reveal that actors who have been arrested more often than\nothers in the past are also more likely to be arrested in the future and would\nlead to a skewed distribution of arrest-activity. In contrast, a negative\nparameter associated with this statistic would lead to a more evenly\ndistributed activity.\n\n  2. 2.\n\nAvg.previous.joint.arrests(t, h) is the average number of previous arrest\nevents in which pairs of members of h has been co-arrested. For instance, if h\n= {a, b, c} is the set of actors a, b, and c and before time t, actors a and b\nhave been co-arrested once (that is, a and b are participants of the same\nprevious arrest event, possibly with other actors outside of the set h) and c\nhas never been co-arrested either with a or with b (that is, actor c might\nhave been arrested before, but not with other members of h), then\navg.previous.joint.arrests (t, {a, b, c}) = 1/3. Note that for\nAvg.previous.joint.arrests it matters whether the previous arrest events\ninvolve two or more actors from the set h. The statistic\nAvg.previous.joint.arrests models varying \u201ccloseness\u201d in the space of actors.\nA positive parameter of this statistic would reveal that actors who have been\nco-arrested before are \u201cclose\u201d to each other and thus are more likely to be\nco-arrested in the future. This would point to a latent clustering in the\nspace of actors into subsets of actors that are more likely to be co-arrested\n(and could be described as a \u201cdense groups of actors\u201d). Note that the\nstatistics average rank difference and average gang difference explicitly\nmodel \u201ccloseness\u201d of actors as a function of exogenous actor-level attributes.\nIn our analyses, if prior shared activity has a positive effect on top of\nthese attribute-based statistics, it implies that the clustering in the space\nof actors is not just a function of rank and/or membership of a particular\nclub.\n\n  3. 3.\n\nclosure(t, h) is a statistic measuring to what extent members of h have\npreviously been co-arrested with the same \u201cthird\u201d actors. For instance, if h =\n{a, b, c} is the set of actors a, b, and c and before time t, there was an\narrest event e_1 = (t_1, {a, d}) in which actor a has been co-arrested with\nthe third actor d and there was another arrest event e_2 = (t_2, {b, d}) in\nwhich actor b has been co-arrested with the same third actor d, then it is\nclosure(t, {a, b, c}) = 1/3. Note that the \u201cthird\u201d actor d does not have to be\na member of the focal hyperedge {a, b, c}. The closure statistic has to be\nunderstood together with prior shared activity. In the given example, actors a\nand d would be considered as close to each other (due to their prior shared\nevent) and actors b and d would be considered as close to each other. Thus,\nactors a and d would be members of a dense group and actors b and d would be\nmembers of a potentially different dense group that overlaps with the first\ngroup in the common actor d. The parameter of the closure statistic explains\nwhether such overlapping dense groups have a tendency to merge over time or\nremain separate: if closure has a positive parameter is implies that a and b\nhave an increased probability to be co-arrested in the future, which would\ninduce the two dense groups to merge. In contrast, if closure has a negative\nparameter then actors a and b, which are both connected to the same third\nactor d but have no history of prior joint arrests would also \u201cstay apart\u201d in\nthe future. From another perspective, actor d would maintain a \u201cbroker\u201d\nposition spanning structural holes. See Lerner et al (2021) for further\nexplanation.^Footnote 1\n\n  4. 4.\n\naverage rank: measures whether higher ranks are more likely to offend of co-\noffend (positive parameter); a negative parameter indicates that lower ranked\naffiliates are more likely to offend or co-offend. We convert the four ranks\nto numeric code: office-bearer = 4, patched member = 3, nominee = 2, associate\n= 1. For any given set of actors, the average rank is the average of the ranks\nof the members of the set. We chose this numerical coding procedure as the\nhierarchy of clubs (from a social organisational perspective, not a criminal\norganisation perspective) puts associates lower than nominees who are lower\nthan patched members who are lower than office bearers.\n\n  5. 5.\n\nratio of office bearers: If the office bearer rank is indicated by a 0/1\nvariable, then the average over this variable is the ratio of office bearers\nto lower ranked affiliates within a co-offending event. In the case of a\nnegative coefficient, the ratio of office bearers in those sets of actors that\nare (co-)arrested is lower than the ratio in the overall population/sample of\nactors. For example, if 10% in the sample of all actors are office bearers and\narrests involve on average 5% office bearers, then this would lead to a\nnegative coefficient; if, on the other hand, arrests involved on average 15%\noffice bearers, this would lead to a positive coefficient, since office\nbearers would be over-represented in arrest events, compared to their ratio in\nour sample. Note that in all cases (for all effects) we compare sets of actors\nthat are (co-)arrested with random sets of actors sampled uniformly from the\nentire sample of actors.\n\n  6. 6.\n\nrank heterophily: measures whether co-offending involved affiliates of\ndifferent rank (positive parameter) or the same rank (negative parameter); see\nalso point 4 above. Rank homophily is the average absolute difference in ranks\ntaken over all pairs of co-offending actors. For example, if an arrest\ninvolves three members, having ranks 1, 2, and 4, respectively, then the rank\nheterophily is (1 + 2 + 3)/3. That is, the absolute difference between ranks 1\nand 2 equals 1, between ranks 2 and 4 equals 2 and between ranks 1 and 4\nequals 3.\n\n  7. 7.\n\nclub heterophily measures whether co-offending involved affiliates from\ndifferent clubs (positive parameter) or the same clubs (negative parameter).\nThis variable gives the fraction of pairs of co-offending actors who are in\ndifferent gangs.\n\n  8. 8.\n\nrank heterophily office bearer: is similar to \"rank heterophily\" (see point 6\nabove) but applied to a binary variable (1 for office bearer and 0 if not an\noffice bearer). It is the ratio of \"mixed\" dyads within a hyperedge: pairs i,j\nsuch that i is an office bearer and j not, so that the difference can just be\nzero or one. A positive parameter would reveal that office bearers tend to be\nco-arrested with non-office bearers. A negative parameter would reveal that\noffice bearers tend to be co-arrested with other office bearers and non-office\nbearers tend to be co-arrested with other non-office bearers.\n\n## Results\n\nWe now present the results for analyses of all crime types taken as an\naggregate, and results for each of the five different crime types: (1)\nviolence and intimidation, (2) public order, (3) criminal enterprise, (4)\nshort term instrumental acts and (5) other offences against the person. For\neach crime type, we only look at crime events for that specific crime type and\ndo not include crime events from the other four crime types. We report results\nseparately for co-offending events involving OMCG affiliates, as well as\nresults for co-offending events with a focus on office bearers. The focus on\noffice bearers is especially relevant in trying to determine the extent to\nwhich OMCG co-offending networks demonstrate overlap with the formal\nhierarchical structure of OMCG clubs. In the scenario whereby OMCGs are\noperating as criminal organizations, office bearer members would be more\nlikely to co-offend with the same partners, with members of their own club,\nand with non-office bearers, consistent with the notion of the involvement of\nclub leaders in criminal activity in collaboration with lower ranking members\nof the same club.\n\n### All Crime Types\n\nFigure 2 shows the complete network of OMCG affiliates connected to crime\nevents (blue nodes represent people, red nodes represent events). In total,\nthere were 2364 OMCG affiliates and 12,564 arrest events for the period of\n2015\u20132020. Figure 3 illustrates the number of re-arrests for OMCG affiliates\nin the sample. From the graph, we can see that the majority of OMCG affiliates\nwere arrested more than once.\n\nFig. 2\n\nNetwork map of complete co-offending network\n\nFull size image\n\nFig. 3\n\nDistribution of number of arrests per OMCG member\n\nFull size image\n\nTable 2 provides the results of all models for all OMCG affiliates. Table 3\ngives results for all models focused on office bearers (as a binary variable).\nTable 2 (all OMCG affiliates included) shows that OMCG affiliates who were\narrested more often in the past tended to be arrested more often in the future\n(i.e., they were repeat offenders) and, if they had previously co-offended,\nthe repeat arrest tended to be with the same co-offending partners. Lower\nranked OMCG members tended to be arrested more often and the arrests tended to\ninvolve co-offenders of similar rank and from the same club.\n\nTable 2 RHEM model results for all co-offending involving all OMCG members\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 3 RHEM model results for co-offending involving office bearers\n\nFull size table\n\nAccording to the results displayed in Table 3 (focus on officer bearers as\nbinary variable), OMCG affiliates who were arrested in the past tended to be\narrested again in the future (i.e. they were repeat offenders) and, if they\nhad previously co-offended, the repeat arrest tended to be with the same co-\noffending partners. There was a tendency against closure which means that\noverlapping, dense groups of co-offenders tended not to merge over time. This\nfinding suggests the presence of brokers who span structural holes in the\nnetwork. Co-offending tended to occur between OMCG affiliates who belonged to\nthe same club. Office bearers were less likely to be arrested compared to\nother ranks but were more likely to be arrested with fellow office bearers,\nand with affiliates from different clubs.\n\n### Violence and Intimidation Offences\n\nIn total, there were 945 OMCG affiliates charged with violence and\nintimidation offences, and 1106 arrest events for the period of 2015\u20132020.\nTable 2 shows that OMCG affiliates who were arrested for violent crimes in the\npast tended to be repeat offenders and if they have had a co-offending\npartner, the repeat arrest tended to be with the same partners. There was also\na tendency against closure which means that the overlapping, dense groups tend\nnot to merge over time, again suggesting the presence of brokers in this\nnetwork. Lower ranked affiliates tended to be arrested more often and the co-\noffending partner(s) tended to be from the same club.\n\nTable 3 shows that OMCG affiliates who were arrested for violent crime in the\npast tended to be repeat offenders and if they have had a co-offending\npartner, the repeat arrest tended to be with the same partner. The arrest\npartner(s) tend to be from the same club. There were no significant results\nregarding office bearers.\n\n### Public Order Offences\n\nIn total, there were 2123 OMCG affiliates charged with Public Order offences\nand 8750 arrest events for the period of 2015\u20132020. According to the results\ndisplayed in Table 2, OMCG affiliates who were arrested for Public Order\noffences in the past tended to be repeat offenders and if they have had a co-\noffending partner, the repeat arrest tended to be with the same partners. In\ncontrast to other crime types, in public order offenses, there was a tendency\nfor closure which means that the overlapping, dense group merged over time. In\nthis case, brokers\u2019 partners are likely to become co-arrested themselves \u2013\nwhich implies a tendency to close structural holes. Lower ranked affiliates\ntended to be arrested more often and the arrest partner(s) tended to be from\nthe same club and be of the same rank.\n\nResults displayed in Table 3 reveal that OMCG affiliates who were arrested for\nPublic Order offences in the past tended to be repeat offenders and when they\nhad a co-offending partner, the repeat arrests tended to be with the same\npartners. The arrest partner(s) tended to be from the same club. Office\nbearers were less likely to be arrested compared with other ranks but were\nmore likely to be arrested with fellow office bearers, and with members from\ndifferent clubs.\n\n### Ongoing Criminal Enterprise\n\nIn total, there were 674 OMCG affiliates charged with Criminal Enterprise\noffences and 713 arrest events for the period of 2015\u20132020. Due to the\ninstability of some of the parameters, significance was determined by fitting\nthe same models to 100 repeated samples (taking each time a different sample\nof non-events via case control sampling). A parameter was deemed significant\nif the majority (at least 97.5%) of parameters from these repeated samples\nhave the same sign. We reported the distribution over all 100 parameter\nestimates for Ongoing Criminal Enterprise offences since for models for this\ntype of crime, the variation across samples was much larger than for the other\nmodels. We therefore believe that just reporting a single point estimate of\nevery parameter, together with an estimate of its standard error, could have\nbeen misleading. (For the other models, variation across samples was smaller\nand was well represented by the estimated standard error). See Fig. 4 for the\nhistograms of the coefficients.\n\nFig. 4\n\nHistograms for ongoing criminal enterprise\n\nFull size image\n\nFrom the histograms, we can see that all coefficients for avg#arrests and\navg.previous.joint.arrests were positively signed. Running significance test\nfor the 100 results, we found that all results for these two parameters were\nsignificant. This means that there were tendencies for OMCG affiliates to have\nrepeat arrests with the same partner(s). The average rank coefficients are all\nnegatively signed and all were significant. This means that OMCG affiliates\nfrom the lower ranks tended to be arrested more often. The rank heterophily\ncoefficients were all in the negative area as well, however they were not\nsignificant. This means that neither homophily nor diversity in ranks were\nobserved among OMCG affiliates. Club heterophily coefficients results were\ndivided between positive and negative suggesting that there is no observed\nhomophily or diversity in club membership among the OMCG affiliates.\n\nWhen the model was fitted for office bearers, the results were as follows\n(Fig. 5):\n\nFig. 5\n\nHistograms for ongoing criminal enterprise including office-bearers\n\nFull size image\n\nIn the \u201cOffice Bearer\u201d models, the only significant effects were for repeat\narrests (\u2018avg.#.arrests') and repeat arrests with the same partner(s)\n(\u2018avg.previous.joint.arrests\u2019). The coefficients for those two parameters were\npositive which means that OMCG affiliates tended to be arrested multiple times\nand if they have co-offending partner(s), they tended to be arrested with the\nsame partner.\n\n### Short Term Instrumental Acts\n\nIn total, there were 822 OMCG affiliates charged with Short Term Instrumental\nActs offences and 1654 arrest events for the period of 2015\u20132020. The short-\nterm instrumental acts category was also investigated by running the\ncalculation 100 times (due to the instability of some of the parameters) and\nthen comparing the results from the models. The results are as follows (see\nFig. 6):\n\nFig. 6\n\nHistograms for short term instrumental acts\n\nFull size image\n\nFrom the histograms, we can see that all \u2018avg#arrests\u2019 coefficients and\n\u2018avg.previous.joint.arrests\u2019 coefficients are positively signed. Running the\nsignificance test for the 100 results, we also found that all results for\nthese two parameters are significant. This means that there were tendencies\nfor repeat arrests and repeat arrests with the same partner(s). The average\nrank coefficients are negatively signed and all of them were significant. This\nmeans affiliates from the lower ranks tended to be arrested more often. The\nrank heterophily coefficients were all in the negative area as well, however\nthey were not significant. This means that neither homophily nor diversity in\nranks were observed among OMCG affiliates. Club heterophily coefficient\nresults were divided between positive and negative. This means that there was\nno observed homophily or diversity in club membership among OMCG affiliates.\n\nWhen the model was fitted for office bearers, the results are as follows (see\nFig. 7):\n\nFig. 7\n\nHistograms for short term instrumental acts, including office bearers\n\nFull size image\n\nThe only significant effects were for \u2018avg#arrests\u2019 and\n\u2018avg.previous.joint.arrests\u2019. This means that OMCG affiliates tended to be\narrested multiple times and if they have had a co-offending partner(s), there\nwas a tendency for repeat arrests with the same partner(s).\n\n### Other Offences Against the Person\n\nIn total, there were 344 OMCG affiliates charged with \u2018other offences against\nthe person\u2019 and 341 arrest events for the period of 2015\u20132020. Table 2 shows\nthat for \u201cother offences against the person\u201d, there was no significant pattern\nexcept an effect for OMCG affiliates being more likely to reoffend in the\nfuture if they had offended in the past. The dyadic.shared.activity and\nclosure were excluded because of their instability in the model and in some\ninstances they prevented the model from converging. When the model was fitted\nfor office bearers (see Table 3), results.indicated that there was a tendency\nfor OMCG affiliates to reoffend in future if they had offended in the past.\nFurther, if office bearers were arrested, they tended to be arrested with\nother office bearers and their arrest partners were more likely to be members\nof a different club.\n\nTable 4 provides a summarised overview of all RHEM results and allows for\ncomparisons of results across crime categories. It shows the variation in the\npattern of effects across crime types. For example, all crime types other than\n\u2018other offences against the person\u2019 showed positive effects for rearrests with\nthe same co-offending partners and greater probability of co-offending for\nlower ranked affiliates. The closure effect was positive only for public order\noffences while it was negative for violent offences.\n\nTable 4 Summary of results for RHEM\n\nFull size table\n\n### REM Results\n\nDetails regarding REM are provided in Appendix 1 and full results for REM are\ndisplayed in Appendix 2. As with the RHEM analyses, relational event models\nwere developed for the complete network of actors and for each of the five\noffence types. In contrast to RHEM, all REM were created by removing all\nisolates (i.e., OMCG affiliates who were never arrested with co-offenders\nacross the data window). We provide here the results for the complete network\nonly, while results for the five different crime categories are presented in\nAppendix 2. Using REM, the results indicated that OMCG affiliates who were\narrested together in the past tend to be arrested again in the future\n(positive avg.previous.joint.arrests). In contrast, those who did not have a\nhistory of being arrested together were less likely to be arrested together in\nfuture (negative avg.#previous.dyadic.arrests), unless they shared a common\nthird co-offending partner. That is, where a partner of a partner was\npreviously arrested together (evidence of positive closure). Co-offending\npartnerships tended to involve those of lower rank and were more common\nbetween individuals of the same rank and those from different clubs.\n\nAs compared with RHEM, in REM the negative avg.#.previous.dyadic.arrests and\npositive avg.previous.joint.arrests effects have to be interpreted differently\n(i.e., to avg#arrests) since in our REM models there is no possibility of\nbeing arrested alone (we only model dyadic arrests having removed all\nisolates). Assume that Actor A and Actor B have been co-arrested once in the\npast (possibly with yet others). Assume that Actor C has been co-arrested with\nsome actors but not with Actor A or B. The past arrest on the dyad (A, B)\nincreases their value in the individual activity statistics, which has a\nnegative effect, but it also increases their value in the shared activity\nstatistic which has a larger positive effect. Thus, the joint effect of the\npast arrest event on (A, B) is that a future co-arrest including both of them\nbecomes more likely. Actors A and C have no past co-arrest with each other\n(but co-arrests with others). Thus, the dyad (A, C) has a positive value in\nthe individual activity statistic, which has a negative effect on future event\nprobability, and this dyad has a value of zero in shared activity (no positive\neffect). Thus, their past arrests with others, along with the lack of a joint\narrest history, make it less likely that Actors A and C are co-arrested in the\nfuture. In general, a negative parameter of avg#previous.dyadic.arrests and a\npositive parameter of avg.previous.joint.arrests means that actors become more\nand more likely to experience common events with their \u201cin-group\u201d (former\nacquaintances, co-offenders) but less and less likely to experience common\nevents with actors with whom they don\u2019t have a previous event history (see\nLerner and Lomi 2022).\n\nThe main difference between the two analyses is that, as expected, REM\nsupports triadic closure for all models (overall crime and all five crime\ncategories) whereas RHEM find evidence of positive closure in one crime type\n(public order offences) and evidence against closure in overall crime and for\nviolent crime. This result is consistent with our expectation that dyadic REM\nwould result in over-estimation of triadic closure, due to the conversion of\nmulti-actor events into cliques of dyadic events.\n\n### TERGM Results\n\nFull results for TERGM are displayed in Appendix 3. In general, the TERGM\nresults for the six different networks indicated that all networks were sparse\nand had significant formation of triadic closure over time. Overall, this\nresult is consistent with our expectations that TERGM would result in over-\nestimation of triadic closure.\n\nAs for the covariates, the results were varied across different networks.\nOverall, OMCG affiliates of higher rank tend to form more co-offense ties over\ntime compared with those affiliates of lower rank, but these ties tended not\nto persist over time. Office bearers tend to be co-arrested with other office\nbearers, but those ties also tended to not persist over time. Unlike in RHEM,\nhomophily for affiliate rank and club were not found in TERGM results. For the\nviolent crimes network, in the formation of ties, office bearers tended to\nhave more co-offenders compared with non-office bearers. The TERGM result also\ndiverged from results using RHEM as it did not detect homophily in gang. In\nthe public order co-offense network, TERGM results indicated that people from\nhigher rank tend to form more co-offense ties over time compared with those of\nlower rank. Again, in contrast to RHEM results, the TERGM result did not\nindicate that there was homophily for rank, gang, or office bearer. In the\ncriminal enterprise and short-term instrumental act networks, TERGM did not\nfind any significance for any of the covariate effects. This result was\nconsistent with RHEM result in which no homophily effects were found. Finally,\nin the other offences against the person network, TERGM results indicated that\noffice bearers tended to have more co-offenders and they tended to co-offend\nwith other office bearers. This result was consistent with results using RHEM.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### The \u2018All Crime\u2019 Network\n\nFor the \u2018all crime\u2019 network we found that OMCG affiliates who had previously\nbeen arrested were more likely to be arrested in future. When repeat arrests\noccurred with other affiliates, those repeat arrests tended to be with the\nsame affiliate. This suggests some consistency in co-offending partnerships\nover time, which is likely driven (at least partly) by shared membership of\nthe same club or chapter. To reduce risks and enhance security, co-offending\npartners are likely to be drawn from an inner trusted network of affiliates\n(e.g., see Bright et al., 2022c), which, much of the time, comprises fellow\nclub members. This explanation reflects co-offending between affiliates of the\nsame club but not co-offending that relates to conflict either within or\nbetween clubs.\n\nAffiliation with an OMCG may provide opportunities to co-offend with like-\nminded individuals, holding similar attitudes and beliefs, many of whom are\nknown to have criminal backgrounds. This ongoing access to potential co-\noffenders who have already been vetted by the club reduces the \u2018search time\u2019\n(and risks) involved in locating a motivated, willing accomplice. These\nadvantages may develop over time as successful co-offending relationships are\nlikely to be enduring, as we found in this study. Given that the co-offending\ntended to occur between affiliates from the same club, it would be reasonable\nto assume that the \u201cpool\u201d for co-offending partners tends to be the more\neasily accessible local pool of affiliates form the same club (i.e., the group\nwho socialise together, meet for club events, and form co-offending\nrelationships). However, this explanation relies on co-offending being an\ninteraction between the individuals within the club, rather than organised by\nthe club or occurring as a consequence of organised club activities. It is\ndifficult to remove the findings of this analysis from the possibility that\noffences of this type were a component of organised offending on behalf of the\nclub, with the intention of benefiting the club. Given the scale of co-\noffending, the findings of this paper support the notion that co-offending\namong OMCG members appears to be a function of organised criminal offending by\nthe club.\n\nOur interpretation of these findings holds similarities to prior research into\nco-offending. For example, Charette and Papachristos (2017) found that co-\noffenders who maintain an offending relationship over time show increased\ntrust in one another. Moreover, having shared characteristics \u2013 in the current\ncase, affiliation with an OMCG and similar attitudes\u2014has been found to be\ngermane for co-offending networks in building trust (see Charette and\nPapachristos 2017). Similarly, Grund and Morselli (2017) found that co-\noffenders tend to co-offend with the same partners over time, a finding the\nauthors posit is based on trust within \u2018working relationships\u2019 formed and\nstrengthened over time. This is especially relevant to OMCGs, which place\ngreat importance on notions of \u2018brotherhood\u2019 and require members to\ndemonstrate strict loyalty to their club and fellow club members. Indeed, some\noffences may be conducted on behalf of the club, including where members are\nordered to commit specific offences by senior members. In these instances,\ncriminal collaborations would be formed to advance the interest of the club,\nas part of club business. These collaborations would, by virtue of their\nmotivation and purpose, involve members of the same club.\n\nExplanations of co-offending dynamics over time must also take account of\ncriminal justice sanctions and the avoidance of such by offenders. For co-\noffenders in this sample to be co-arrested again, they must have either been\nsuccessful in avoiding incarceration, or released from prison with time enough\nto co-offend within the five-year sample period. Where these co-arrests\ninvolved co-operation, it is likely that the prior experience of co-offending\nfeatured a degree of perceived success and / or the promotion of trust between\nindividuals to the extent that they had opportunities to co-offend again.\nAlternatively, the result may reflect limited options for selection of co-\noffending partners, resulting in the observed consistency in co-offending\npartnerships. Given that the majority of co-offending (especially for violent\noffences) was observed within clubs, we believe that the majority of co-\noffending reflects cooperative criminal activity. Nonetheless, there may be\noccasions where co-offending involves competition or enmity. Where co-arrest\ninvolves some type of enmity, for example physical altercations between\naffiliates of two clubs, the result might indicate that such enmity persists\nover time resulting in the same OMCG affiliates being arrested together on\nmultiple occasions.\n\nLower ranked members were more likely to engage in co-offending compared with\noffice bearers. This could mean that office bearers are less likely to engage\nin offending / co-offending behaviour, or that they are less likely to be\ndetected or arrested for this behaviour. Building on the first hypothesis,\nthis finding may reflect age differences between ranks, and specifically that\nlower ranked affiliates tend to be younger than those of higher ranks\n(especially office bearers). The widely supported age-crime curve has shown\nthat offending peaks in adolescence and early adulthood for a variety of age-\nrelated reasons (e.g., DeLisi 2015), and research has found a similarly higher\nprevalence and frequency of offending among younger organized crime offenders\n(Campedelli et al. 2021; Meneghini and Calderoni 2022) and OMCG affiliates\n(Cubitt and Morgan 2022; Morgan et al., in press). Relatedly, research has\nhighlighted that recent generations of OMCG members have more extensive\nhistories of (particularly violent) offending in adolescence and early\nadulthood than their older counterparts, pointing to a stronger propensity for\ncrime and violence among younger members (Dowling et al. 2021; Voce et al\n2021).\n\nRegarding the second hypothesis, previous work has shown that office bearers\nprefer to indirectly control the criminal activity of lower ranked affiliates\nso that their \u2018hands are clean\u2019 and they are insulated from any potential\nlegal consequences (e.g., Morselli 2009). It has been argued that younger\nmembers may be recruited as \u2018foot soldiers\u2019 into violent confrontations with\nrival clubs (e.g., Quinn and Forsyth 2009), or to undertake higher risk\nactivities in ongoing criminal enterprises (Cubitt and Morgan 2022; Morgan et\nal., in press) under the direction of older and more senior members.\nAdditionally, lower ranking affiliates may be more likely to engage in crime\nto prove their worth to the club, and secure full membership or higher office\n(e.g., Morselli 2009; Rostami and Mondani 2019). Initiation rituals and\nprocesses are fundamental to the recruitment of new members into OMCGs (see\nvon Lampe and Blokland 2020), and these may include committing certain crimes,\nincluding violent crimes, that target other clubs. Taken together, these\nfindings suggest that office bearers, rather than simply offending less, may\nplay some role in directing or influencing the offending of other members from\nbehind the scenes, while taking care not to become too directly involved in it\nand risk attracting the attention of law enforcement.\n\nThe RHEM model revealed that there was evidence against triadic closure for\nthe overall co-offending network. This suggests that while affiliates a-b and\nb-c offend together, it is not likely that affiliates a-c will later co-offend\ndespite their indirect connections to b. The likelihood of two individuals co-\noffending is reduced if they each co-offended with the same third actor in two\nseparate events but have no previous co-offending history among themselves. In\nthe example above, actor b occupies a broker position spanning a structural\nhole. Negative closure means that structural holes tend to remain open, that\nis, actors tend to keep their broker positions.\n\nSignificant results also emerged regarding a number of other variables. As\nmentioned, when OMCG affiliates engage in co-offending they are more likely to\nco-offend with other affiliates of the same rank. Co-offending was more likely\namong affiliates of the same OMCG, although office bearers exhibited a\ntendency to co-offend with affiliates of other clubs, and with other office\nbearers. The co-offending between office-bearers may reflect a type of\nhomophily based on their rank and leadership position in the clubs. Office-\nbearers may place higher levels of (criminal) trust in other office-bearers\ngiven their privileged position within the club with their office-bearer\nstatus being indicative of higher loyalty and trustworthiness. The perceived\nbenefits of co-offending between office bearers, may overcome the risks posed\nby criminal collaboration between clubs. If this is the case, these findings\nsupport the notion that offending by members of OMCGs occurs not only clubs,\nbut potentially also between clubs under certain conditions. Of relevance\nhere, Australian police have recently reported that OMCGs are increasingly\nturning to collaboration with rival clubs, and with other organised crime\ngroups, to secure control of markets and enhance their profits (ABC News 2017;\nPearson and Estcourt 2022). However, while these findings may represent\ncollaboration (e.g., two office bearers from different clubs cooperate in a\njoint endeavour to traffic illicit drugs), they may also represent a conflict\n(e.g., two office-bearers from different clubs in a physical altercation). As\nan example of conflict that results in co-offending, we use the category of\npublic order offences. There may be public order crime events in which members\nof two clubs meet (by design or by chance) and engage in some type of violent\nconflict, however it is more likely that these conflicts attract criminal\ncollaboration between lower ranking OMCG members (Cubitt et al. 2022). We now\nturn to a closer examination of the results regarding each of these\ncategories.\n\n### The Five Offence Types\n\nAs with the findings for all crime, across all of the five crime categories\nOMCG affiliates were likely to be re-arrested if they were previously arrested\nfor offences within that specific crime category. Affiliates were also likely\nto maintain the same co-offending partners, and lower ranked affiliates were\nmore likely than higher ranked affiliates to be arrested, for all offence\ncategories except other offences against the person.\n\nOMCG affiliates were likely to co-offend with members of the same rank for\npublic order offences only. Public order offences include offences such as the\npossession and use illicit drugs, property damage and disorderly conduct \u2013\noffences which tend to be of lower seriousness and are more representative of\n\u2018barbarian\u2019 type behaviour OMCG affiliates commonly engage in to show off\ntheir bravado and daring (von Lampe and Blokland 2020). These types of\noffences, often spontaneous and unplanned, may be undertaken by OMCG\naffiliates within sight of other OMCG affiliates as a way to demonstrate their\ncommitment to the outlaw culture of their clubs. We note though that the\nresult may also be a function of law enforcement activity. It is these large\ngatherings that may result in arrests of multiple members at once, usually for\nsome type of public order offence such as affray. By virtue of the fact they\noutnumber office-bearers, most of those arrested will be lower ranked\naffiliates such as nominees and associates.\n\nOMCG affiliates were likely to co-offend with members of the same club for\nviolence/intimidation offences and public order offences, but the effect was\nnot observed for ongoing criminal enterprise, short term instrumental acts or\nother offences against the person. As discussed previously, many offences\ncategorised within the violent and public order categories probably reflect\nbarbarian-type behaviour that affiliates commonly engage in with others in\ntheir clubs. Regarding violence/intimidation offences, these results could, to\nsome degree, reflect conflicts with rival club members, and especially more\nplanned and predatory attacks on the affiliates of rival cubs where police may\nonly arrest the aggressors and treat the rival club members as victims. That\naffiliates were not found to be more likely to co-offend with others from\ntheir club in relation to short-term instrumental acts and ongoing criminal\nenterprise offending suggests that club loyalty may be less important when the\nprimary motivation of criminal activity is financial profit.\n\nTriadic closure was found to occur only for public order offences. Clustering\nof co-offenders may be more likely for these type of low risk, more\nopportunistic type offences, and is more in keeping with the hedonistic,\nbarbarian culture of OMCGs as opposed to more planned instrumental offending\nand organised crime type offending. In contrast, we found evidence against\ntriadic closure for violence and intimidation offences. Given the more easily\ndetectable nature of these offences, and the risk that violence may spill-over\nand impact bystanders, attracting increased law enforcement attention, clubs\nare likely to actively avoid incidents in which groups of their affiliates may\nbe arrested. It is therefore possible that this analysis has identified\nnumerical thresholds for violent co-offending among OMCGs, in which an\nindividual member is unlikely to commit violence on their own, but where\nviolent offences are not typically engaged in by more than three or more\nmembers. Whether this was an intentional decision by affiliates, or a\nnaturally occurring phenomena relating to opportunity, remains unclear.\n\nOffice bearers were less likely than lower ranked affiliates to be co-arrested\nfor public order offences. This could, again, reflect the age differences\nbetween ranks within OMCGs. Office bearers, who are likely to be older on\naverage, may be less inclined towards public order offending which, in the\nbarbarian-style OMCG milieu, could often be centred on displays of youthful\nbravado, impulsivity and thrill-seeking. To the extent that public order\noffences are seen in this milieu as a way for lower-ranked members to prove\ntheir dedication to a club and their willingness to undertake criminal\nactivities on its behalf, there would obviously be less reason for senior\nranking office bearers to do the same. Alternatively, this finding could\nreflect selection bias. Police are typically aware of who the senior ranked\naffiliates in OMCGs are, and regularly subject them to greater scrutiny and\nenforcement activity. As a result, office bearers may refrain from lower-level\noffending that is highly visible or otherwise easily detectable by police.\nOffice bearers may also be more experienced at evading law enforcement\nattention: they know they are more likely to be targeted by police and may\ntherefore be less likely to engage in those behaviours.\n\n### The Three Scenarios\n\nWith respect to the three scenarios developed by von Lampe and Blokland\n(2020), our results support the notion that some OMCGs operate, at least at\ntimes, as organized criminal groups, especially where there is evidence that\noffice bearers are involved in co-offending with other affiliates, and\nparticularly when such offending involves organized crime type offences (e.g.\ndrug trafficking). Although we are unable to determine whether office bearers\ndirect or oversee such criminal activity, it should be remembered that, by\nvirtue of their position in the club, they hold distinct power over lower\nranked members. Therefore, it is also probable that office bearers hold some\ndegree or control or influence over their criminal collaborations with lower\nranking members as well, particularly when these co-offences feature a\nmaterial benefit to the club (ie. Increases in territory, power or financial\ngain). Importantly, given our reliance on data concerning offences detected by\npolice, any overlap of offending and club hierarchies is likely obscured to\nsome extent by the insulation office-bearers regularly have from legal\nconsequences (e.g. Morselli 2009), making the identification of clubs\noperating more as criminal organisations difficult.\n\nWhen co-offending involved members of more than one club, the resulting\ncriminal network may at times feature members of several clubs, such that the\nboundaries of discrete clubs are difficult to identify. It was also apparent\nthat some clubs comprised of features consistent with the \u2018club within a club\u2019\nscenario. In particular, our results highlight the presence of brokers as\nimportant members who connect different clubs within the broader co-offending\nnetwork and facilitate a type of cross-club offending. Our findings mirror\nthose of van Deuren et al. (2022), in that the extent to which Australian\nOMCGs adhere to each of the scenarios varies across the types of criminal\nactivities in which they are involved. While the three scenarios provide a\nworking framework for understanding OMCG offending, the reality is much more\ncomplex and suggests a hybrid type co-offending network that includes some\nclubs operating as both criminal organisations and \u2018clubs within clubs\u2019\ninterconnected by key brokers (who are often office bearers).\n\nHaving concluded our discussion of the implications of the results for OMCG\noffending and co-offending, we now turn to a brief discussion of the\ncomparison of the two analytical models: REM and RHEM. We offer some tentative\nconclusions about the relative utility of RHEM for the analysis of co-\noffending networks.\n\n### Comparison of RHEM with REM and (T)ERGM\n\nA subordinate focus of this study was to examine the potential benefits of\nusing RHEM over other modelling approaches such as REM or TERGM to analyse\ncomplex network data, given the potential for traditional co-offending models\nto produce spurious findings relating to co-offending dynamics (Nieto et al.\n2022). We found that the main difference between the two analyses is that, as\nexpected, REM and TERGM find triadic closure for all models (the \u2018all crime\u2019\nnetwork in addition to all five crime categories) whereas RHEM find evidence\nof closure in one crime type (public order offences) and evidence against\nclosure in overall crime and for violent crime. This is one concrete\nillustration of potentially invalid findings resulting from dyadic REM, or\nTERGM \u2013 in contrast to an analysis with RHEM. We observe that dyadic REM and\nTERGM suggested a positive closure effect for nearly all subsets of the data,\nwhile the RHEM analysis revealed negative closure for most crime types (the\nexception being public order offenses). It can be well explained why REM and\nTERGM are bound to yield positive closure: the one-mode projection of events\nwith three or more participating actors, by construction, leads to a large\nnumber of closed triangles (the number of resulting triangles scales as the\nnumber of participating actors to the power of three). This structural\nartefact, which is caused by forcing hyperevents into dyadic events, is\n\u201cexplained\u201d by dyadic REM with a positive closure effect. Indeed, in data with\nmany large hyperevents, it is nearly impossible for dyadic REM to find\nnegative closure, due to the abundance of generated closed triangles. In\ncontrast, the analysis with RHEM painted a more differentiated picture:\nclosure was found to be negative for most crime types \u2013 pointing to the\nexistence of overlapping dense clusters, connected by brokers bridging\nstructural holes. Only in the network of public order offenses did the RHEM\nanalysis find positive closure. Similarly, triadic closure was overestimated\nfor all six co-offending networks analysed in this study. We therefore argue\nthat RHEM should be the preferred analytical approach to co-offending networks\nas one type of network within the class of \u2018relational\u2019 models. In particular,\nwe note that negative closure is not inevitable whenever RHEM is applied, but\nit can reveal important differences between networks. We further point out\nthat an analysis with (T)ERGM entails the additional disadvantage of having to\naggregate co-offense events over typically arbitrary time intervals \u2013 a\nproblem that does not occur for REM nor for RHEM. Since co-offense networks\ntypically come in the form of time-stamped relational events \u2013 rather than\nstable relational states \u2013 models for relational events, REM or RHEM, are more\nappropriate than (T)ERGM. On the other hand, it is the polyadic (or\nhypergraph) nature of co-arrests that imply the preference of RHEM over REM.\n\nWe note that RHEM are implemented and made available in the open-source\nsoftware eventnet (https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet) enabling other\nresearchers to conduct a similar analysis.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThere are several limitations related to these data and analyses: (1) the\ndataset only includes offences that are detected by police so the data will\nunderestimate criminal behaviour and co-offending by OMCG members; (2) the\ndata includes only OMCG affiliates who were arrested by the police. There\ncould be affiliates who were known by the police but were never arrested, and\nthese people were not captured in the data; (3) arrests may be reflective of\nthe strategic focus of police investigations and may therefore reflect this\nfocus (see Bright et al. 2022a for a discussion of this and similar\nlimitations in criminal networks research); (4) for the purposes of this\nproject we operationalised co-offending as criminal collaboration (as most\nstudies on co-offending do). But although being arrested at the same crime\nevent usually indicates criminal collaboration, it may also capture\nindividuals arrested at a similar event who are not collaborating and may even\nbe antagonists (e.g. a fight between rival clubs). This is more likely for\nsome offence types (e.g., public order offences) than others (e.g., short-term\ncriminal acts); (5) the data include only those OMCG affiliates who are known\nto be members through police reports (so some actual members including office\nbearers may not be included); (6) the data does not include individuals who\nwere not affiliated with OMCGs so we know nothing about co-offending and\ncollaboration with non-members, including other criminal groups; (7)\nindividuals may be less likely to remain in the pool of available offenders if\nthey are arrested for a more severe/serious offence (e.g. murder), an example\nof a time-varying risk set; RHEM can deal with time-varying covariates\n(changing rank or group membership) and also with time-varying risk sets (who\ncould participate in events at a given time); (8) We do not have the\ninformation whether individuals who were arrested were subsequently\nincarcerated, so we assumed that all arrestees had been released and had the\nopportunity to be re-arrested; and (9) as noted in the methodology section,\nwhile the data covered the period 2015\u20132020, we employed rank attribution from\n2020. Therefore, ranks of individuals may have changed over the five period\nwithout being recorded in the data and analysis. Given the potential data\nlimitations listed above, especially with respect to missing data, we\nconducted some robustness analyses using simulated missing data. Results of\nthese simulations did not differ from our substantive results in any\nmeaningful way (see appendix 4).\n\n### Implications\n\nThe results have implications for policy and practice in the investigation and\ndisruption of OMCGs. Specifically, intelligence agencies and law enforcement\nagencies should collect data on co-offending within and across OMCG clubs and\nseek to disrupt connections between some of the key players such as office\nbearers, especially for more serious categories of crime such\nviolence/intimidation and ongoing criminal enterprise. Our results further\nsuggest that the focus of law enforcement should be on the co-offending\nnetworks involved in serious crime such as organised crime, rather than on\nspecific clubs. Given the importance of collecting and analysing intelligence,\nthese approaches could be incorporated into predictions models (e.g., Cubitt\nand Morgan 2022) to guide LEA in terms of targeting (based on whether it adds\nany predictive power, obviously, but this remains untested).\n\nWith respect to practical considerations, RHEM has already been applied to\ndata comprising hundreds of thousands of actors and events (see Lerner and\nH\u00e2ncean 2023) by using case\u2013control sampling. We therefore believe that RHEM\ncould be applied with reasonable computational runtime to any currently\navailable data on co-offending networks. Among the challenges, we note that\nthe estimation of some RHEM effects become unstable if the network is very\nsparse, for instance, if most events have a single or only few participants\n(see Lerner and Lomi 2023). Ultimately, this can mean that some RHEM effects\nmust be dropped from the models to ensure a convergent estimation (eg. in the\nempirical analysis in our paper we had to drop the \u2018closure\u2019 effect in several\nmodels). A possible way around this instability is to reduce the network to a\ncore of actors that are sufficiently active in co-offending (thereby\nincreasing the density). We further recommend that researchers and\npractitioners fit RHEM not just once but several times with different samples\nof non-events (\u2018controls\u2019) to assess the uncertainty in parameter estimates\nthat is caused by case\u2013control sampling (we did this in our empirical\nanalysis).\n\nThe stability of co-offending networks over time reaffirms the importance of\nfocusing on smaller networks \u2013 meaning chapters \u2013 given the \u2018franchise\u2019\nstructure of OMCGs probably influences co-offending networks. The observed\nstability of co-offending networks suggests that prior arrests may have\nlimited effect on long-term disruption of OMCG co-offending networks. This\nhighlights the need for further research into the effects of law enforcement\nactivity on co-offending, as part of the broader need for research into the\nimpact of disruption strategies more generally.\n\n### Future Research\n\nThis research suggests that there may be benefit to analytic approaches using\nRHEM to analyse other co-offending data sets across contexts (e.g., gang\noffending, other country data). There may also be benefit to conducting\nnetwork analyses using data collected on OMCG groups in different contexts\n(e.g. other states of Australia, other countries). Further, to further aid in\ninterpretation and to establish context to administrative crime datasets, we\nstrongly recommend combining results of SNA with ethnographic research such as\ninterviews with ex-OMCG members. This type of approach may enable researchers\nto delve more deeply into the social dynamics that drive co-offending in OMCGs\nincluding the possibility that office bearers direct or oversee criminal\nactivities with or without engaging in such activities. Finally, we suggest\nthat future research should examine the \u201cevolution\u201d of crime in OMCG or other\nco-offending contexts (i.e., if one is co-offending with someone that\npreviously was charged with a more serious crime than him, would he get an\n\u201cupgrade\u201d in the next crime).\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. Note that some models did not include closure effects. Where closure is not included in the models, this is because model parameters were unstable (swung between positive to negative or vice versa). This might be due to an insufficient number of configurations (open two-paths) that are preconditions to closure events. With a small number of observations that show variation in the closure statistic, estimation of the respective parameter becomes unstable.\n\n## References\n\n  * Aalen O, Borgan O, Gjessing H (2008) Survival and event history analysis: a process point of view.

REM can also be\nspecified within the CoxPH modelling framework \u2013 the difference to RHEM is\nthat REM can model only dyadic events connecting exactly two nodes at a time\n(such as a telephone call linking one sender with one receiver). We outlined\nabove the disadvantages of analysing co-offending networks with REM. Arrest\nevents have to be converted to dyadic events which forces us to drop single-\nactor arrests. Moreover, converting arrests with three or more participants\ninto pairwise dyadic co-arrests artificially increases the number of\nobservations, violates the assumption of conditionally independent events, and\ncreates structural artefacts, such as a high number of closed triangles. These\npoints are further clarified by the more formal treatment below.\n\nAs with RHEM, the observation of central interest is a list of arrest events E\n= e_1, e_2, ...,e_N, where each event e = (t_e, h_e, x_e) is a triple\ncomprising the time of the arrest t_e (given by the day), the set of\nparticipants h_e of the arrest (each h_e is a subset of the entire set of\nactors A consisting of any number of OMCG members, from 1 to n =|A|, who are\nco-arrested in the event), and x_e is the type of the event (which is the type\nof the offense/crime). These events in which the number of participants |h_e|\nis a variable number between 1 and n have to be converted to a list of dyadic\nevents E\u2019 = e\u2019_1, ..., e\u2019_N\u2019 (note that the number of constructed dyadic\nevents N\u2019 is typically different from the number of original events N) by the\nfollowing steps.\n\n  1. 1.\n\nAll single-actor arrest events (|h_e|= 1) are discarded.\n\n  2. 2.\n\nAll arrest events involving exactly two actors (|h_e|= 2) are left unchanged.\n\n  3. 3.\n\nAll arrest events involving three or more actors (|h_e|> = 3) get converted\ninto undirected dyadic events: for each unordered set {a,b} of two different\nmembers of h_e, we add an event e\u2019 = (t_e,{a,b},x_e) to E\u2019. After that, the\nmulti-actor event gets discarded.\n\nThe first step could be problematic since \u2013 even in a study only concerned\nabout co-offending \u2013 single-actor arrests could still trigger (or prevent)\nfuture co-arrests. Even more problematic is the creation of multiple dyadic\nco-arrest events from original co-arrests with three or more actors. The\nnumber of dyadic events resulting from a hyperedge h_e is |h_e|*(|h_e|\u22121)/2.\nFor instance, an arrest event involving three actors yields three dyadic\nevents, an arrest event involving five actors already yields ten dyadic\nevents. Thus, the conversion into dyadic events artificially increases the\nnumber of observations \u2013 which could result in invalid estimates. Moreover,\nthe assumption that events occurring at the same time (on the same day in our\nstudy) are conditionally independent of each other gets violated. For\ninstance, if actors a, b, and c are co-arrested at time t, then it is not even\nthinkable that the three resulting dyadic events, {a,b}, {b,c}, and {a,c} are\nindependent (more to the point, the third one is even implied by the two\nformer events \u2013 which is the strongest form of dependence). Last but not\nleast, the conversion of arrests involving three or more actors into clusters\nof dyadic events creates structural artefacts, such as an abundance of closed\ntriangles, since any subset of three members of h_e is mutually connected by\nconstruction.\n\nAfter having constructed the list of dyadic events E\u2019 from E as detailed\nabove, the specification of REM within the CoxPH framework follows the same\nsteps as in the case of RHEM. In particular, the relative co-arrest rate on a\ndyad {a,b} (any combination of two actors from A) at time t is specified in\nparametric form as follows.\n\n$${\\uplambda }_{1}^{\\prime} \\left( {t,\\left\\\\{ {a,b} \\right\\\\}} \\right) = \\exp\n\\left( {\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j = 1}^{k} {\\uptheta }_{j}^{\\prime} \\cdot\ns_{j}^{\\prime} \\left( {t,\\left\\\\{ {a,b} \\right\\\\}} \\right)} \\right)$$\n\nThe difference here compared with RHEM is that the statistics s\u2019(t,{a,b}) are\nfunctions of exactly two nodes. The parameters theta\u2019 can be estimated by\nmaximizing the following partial likelihood (we write {a_e,b_e} for the two\nactors of a dyadic co-arrest event e).\n\n$$L^{\\prime } \\left( {\\theta^{\\prime } } \\right) = \\mathop \\prod \\limits_{{e\n\\in E^{\\prime } }} \\frac{{\\lambda_{1}^{\\prime } \\left( {t_{e} ,\\left\\\\{ {a_{e}\n,b_{e} } \\right\\\\}} \\right)}}{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{{\\left\\\\{ {a,b}\n\\right\\\\} \\in R_{e}^{\\prime} }} \\lambda_{1}^{\\prime} \\left( {t_{e} ,\\left\\\\{\n{a,b} \\right\\\\}} \\right)}}$$\n\nThe difference compared with RHEM is that the risk set R\u2019_e is a set of\nunordered dyads, that is, sets of exactly two members of A. If A is large so\nthat |A|^2 becomes computationally intractable, we resort to case\u2013control\nsampling, as described above for the case of RHEM.\n\n### Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) for Modelling Co-Offending Data\n\nBesides dyadic REM we also analyse our co-offending networks with exponential\nrandom graph models (ERGM) and compare results to those obtained with RHEM.\nGiving a formal introduction to ERGM is out of scope of this paper and we\nrefer the reader to Lusher et al (2013). Briefly, ERGM specify the probability\nof a graph G = (A,E) \u2013 where A is the set of nodes (actors) and E is a set of\nundirected edges {a,b}, indicating which pairs of members of A are connected,\nfor instance, have been co-arrested in a given time interval \u2013 by\n\n$$P\\left( G \\right) = \\frac{1}{Z}\\exp \\left( {\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j =\n1}^{k}\\uptheta _{j} \\cdot s_{j} \\left( G \\right)} \\right)$$\n\nIn the formula above, the s_j are graph statistics (such as the number of\nedges, edges connecting members from the same gang or rank, triangles, or\n2-stars in G), theta_j are parameters and Z is a normalizing constant. A\ntemporal version of ERMG, denoted as TERGM, models the conditional probability\nof a graph G_t in time step t, given the graph G_{t\u22121} from the previous time\nstep, by a similar formula (Krivitsky and Handcock 2014). In our comparison\nstudy we estimate TERGM with a \u201cformation\u201d and a \u201cpersistence\u201d component. The\nformation model explains which edges are newly formed (i.e., edges present at\ntime t but not present at time t\u22121, that is, pairs of actors co-arrested at\ntime t but not at t\u22121) and the persistence model explains which edges, among\nthe edges at time t\u22121, are repeated at time t (that is, pairs of actors\nrepeatedly co-arrested at two successive points in time), compare Krivitsky\nand Handcock (2014).\n\nIn order to analyse co-arrest data with ERGM or TERGM we first have to apply\nthe same conversion from multi-actor arrests to derived dyadic co-arrest\nevents as for REM \u2013 entailing the same problems. Additionally, we have to\naggregate the entire observation period into one or several time-intervals\n(one in the case of ERGM, two or more in the case of TERGM) to convert event\nsequences into static graphs. In our case, since repeated arrests of the same\nperson within short time are rare, we decided to connect two actors in graph\nG_t, if they have been co-arrested at least once within the associated time\ninterval t. (ERGM variants for count data, which could model the number of\ndyadic co-arrests within intervals also exist but have not been applied in our\ncomparison study.)\n\nIn summary, analysing co-arrest data with ERGM entails the same problems as\nREM analysis due to the conversion of multi-actor events to collections of\ndyadic events. Additionally, we have to decide on (typically arbitrary) sub-\nintervals of our observation period. If time intervals are chosen that are\nvery short, the resulting graphs are very sparse and there is little stability\nfrom one timestep to the next. If time intervals are long, we lose the\ntemporal ordering of arrest events within the same interval. Last but not\nleast, the estimation of ERGM parameters is much more demanding from the\ncomputational point of view (compared to estimating REM or RHEM parameters)\nand ERGM can suffer from near-degeneracy in which almost all probability mass\nis centred on a small subset of (typically unrealistic) graphs, compare Lusher\net al (2013). Indeed, it turned out that we could not estimate ERGM or TERGM\nparameters on our data by the standard MCMC-MLE algorithm with available\ncomputational means and had to resort to maximum pseudolikelihood estimation\n(MPLE) which entails the additional problem of violating (or blatantly\nignoring) the complex dependency structure of ERGM, compare Lusher et al\n(2013), shedding additional doubts on estimated parameters.\n\nBelow we report the results of a TERGM analysis where we split our observation\nperiod into 6 intervals.\n\n### Appendix 2: Results Using REM\n\nAs with the RHEM analyses, Relational Event Models were developed for the\ncomplete network of actors and for each of the five offence types. In contrast\nto RHEM, all Relational Event Models were created by removing all isolates\n(i.e., individuals who were never arrested with co-offenders across the data\nwindow).\n\nTable\n\nTable 5 Co-offending involving all OMCG members\n\nFull size table\n\n5 shows the results of all models across all crime categories including all\nOMCG ranks. Table 2 displays results from all models across all crime\ncategories including models that focus on office bearers. Using REM, the\nresult indicated that OMCG members who were arrested together in the past tend\nto be arrested again in the future (positive avg.previous.joint.arrests). If\ntwo actors A and B did not have a history of being arrested together, then\ntheir probability to be co-arrested in the future decreases with the number of\nprevious dyadic arrests with \u201cthird actors\u201d, different from A and B, (negative\navg#previous.dyadic.arrests), unless they have been previously co-arrested\nwith the same common third co-offending partner (positive closure). Co-\noffending partnerships tended to involve those of lower rank and were more\ncommon between individuals of the same rank and those from different clubs\n(Table\n\nTable 6 Co-offending involving office bearers\n\nFull size table\n\n6).\n\nAs compared with RHEM, in REM the negative avg.#.previous.dyadic.arrests and\npositive avg.previous.joint.arrests effects have to be interpreted differently\n(to avg#arrests) since in our REM models there is no possibility of being\narrested alone (we only model dyadic arrests having removed all isolates).\nAssume that Actor A and Actor B have been co-arrested once in the past\n(possibly with yet others). Assume that Actor C has been co-arrested with some\nactors but not with Actor A or B. The past arrest on the dyad (A, B) increases\ntheir value in the individual activity statistics, which has a negative\neffect, but it also increases their value in the shared activity statistic\nwhich has a larger positive effect. Thus, the joint effect of the past arrest\nevent on (A, B) is that a future co-arrest including both of them becomes more\nlikely. Actors A and C have no past co-arrest with each other (but co-arrests\nwith others). Thus, the dyad (A, C) has a positive value in the individual\nactivity statistic, which has a negative effect on future event probability,\nand this dyad has a value of zero in shared activity (no positive effect).\nThus, their past arrests with others, along with the lack of a joint arrest\nhistory, make it less likely that Actors A and C are co-arrested in the\nfuture.\n\nIn general, a negative parameter of avg#previous.dyadic.arrests and a positive\nparameter of avg.previous.joint.arrests means that actors become more and more\nlikely to experience common events with their \u201cin-group\u201d (former\nacquaintances, co-offenders) but less and less likely to experience common\nevents with actors with whom they don\u2019t have a previous event history (see\nLerner and Lomi 2022). The result indicates that OMCG members who were\narrested together in the past tend to be arrested again in the future\n(positive avg.previous.joint.arrests). However, those who did not have a prior\nhistory of co-offending together were less likely to be arrested together in\nthe future (negative avg.#.previous.dyadic.arrests), except where they each\nhave a common co-offending partner; that is, where a partner of a partner\nwould be arrested together (positive closure). Office bearers tended to be\narrested more often than lower ranked members and when they did, they were\nmore likely to be arrested with another office bearer.\n\n### Violent Offences Network\n\nThe model indicated that individuals tend to be arrested with the same\npartner(s) and that partners of a partners tend to be arrested together\n(positive closure). Lower ranked members tended to be arrested more often and\nwhen they had co-offending partner(s), those partner(s) tended to be from the\nsame club. The model indicated that individuals tend to be arrested with the\nsame partner(s) and that partners of a partners tend to be arrested together.\nOffice bearers tend to be arrested with other office bearers.\n\n### Criminal Enterprise Offences Network\n\nThe result indicated that OMCG members who were arrested together in the past\ntend to be arrested again in the future (positive avg.previous.joint.arrests).\nAgain, those who had never been arrested together previously were less likely\nto be arrested together in the future (negative\navg.#.previous.dyadic.arrests), unless they shared a common third co-offender\n(i.e., we found evidence of positive closure). The model indicated that\nindividuals tend to be arrested with the same partner(s) and the partner of a\npartner tend to be arrested together. For this network, we found no specific\neffects for office bearers.\n\n### Short Term Instrumental Act Offences\n\nIn this networks, the results for avg.#.previous.dyadic.arrests had to be\nremoved from the model because it was unstable. The model indicated that\nindividuals tended to be arrested with the same partner(s) and the partner of\na partner tend to be arrested together (positive closure). Actors of lower\nrank tend to be arrested more often than those of higher ranks. The model\nindicated that individuals tend to be arrested with the same partner(s) and\nthe partner of a partner tend to be arrested together. There were no specific\neffects for office bearers.\n\n### Public Order Offences Network\n\nThe result indicated that OMCG members who were arrested together in the past\ntended to be arrested again in the future (positive\navg.previous.joint.arrests). In contrast, those who did not have a history of\nbeing arrested together were less likely to be arrested together in the future\n(negative avg.#.previous.dyadic.arrests), unless they shared a common co-\noffending partner (i.e., positive closure). The average.rank effect could not\nbe interpreted as it was unstable. The results indicated that OMCG members who\nwere arrested together in the past tend to be arrested again in the future\n(positive avg.previous.joint.arrests). Actors who did not have a history of\nbeing arrested together were less likely to be arrested together in the future\n(negative avg.#.previous.dyadic.arrests), unless they shared a common co-\noffending partner in the past, where a partner of a partner were more likely\nto be arrested together (positive closure). As per previous results. office\nbearers tended to be arrested with other office bearers.\n\n### Other Offences Against the Person Network\n\nThe result indicated that OMCG members who were arrested together in the past\ntend to be arrested again in the future (positive avg.previous.joint.arrests).\nIn contrast, those who did not have a history of being arrested together were\nless likely to be arrested together in the future (negative\navg.#.previous.dyadic.arrests), except where they shared a co-offending\npartner in the past (positive closure). Co-arrests tended to comprise members\nfrom different clubs. The results indicated that OMCG members who were\narrested together in the past tend to be arrested again in the future\n(positive avg.previous.dyadic arrests). In contrast, those who had never been\narrested together were less likely to be arrested together in the future\n(negative avg.#.previous.dyadic.arrests).\n\n### Appendix 3: Results of TERGM\n\nIn the analysis below, we specify TERGM that have a formation and persistence\ncomponent (compare Krivitsky and Handcock 2014) with effects taken from the\nfollowing list of statistics. For some models we had to remove some statistics\nfrom the specification, since their inclusion resulted in non-convergence\nduring MPLE estimation (see details below).\n\n  * \u201cedges\u201d controls for the density of the networks; a negative parameter points to sparsity of the networks (which is almost always the case in empirical social networks)\n\n  * \u201cclosure\u201d (specified via the statistic \u201cgwdegree(decay = 0.1, fixed = TRUE)\u201d) reveals whether there is an over-representation (if positive) or under-representation of closed triangles (if negative)\n\n  * \u201chomophily gang\u201d (specified via the statistic \u201cnodematch(\"gang\")\u201d, counting the number of edges {a,b} in which a and b are members of the same gang); a positive parameter reveals that actors have a tendency to be co-arrested with members of the same gang\n\n  * \u201cedge rank\u201d (specified via the statistic \u201cnodecov(\"rank\")\u201d, adding up the sum of the ranks of a and b over all edges {a,b}); a positive (negative) parameter reveals that actors of higher rank are typically co-arrested more (less) often\n\n  * \u201cdifferent rank\u201d (specified via the statistic \u201cabsdiff(\"rank\")\u201d, adding up the absolute difference of ranks of a and b over all edges {a,b}); a positive (negative) parameter reveals that actors of different rank are typically co-arrested more (less) often; thus, it is a measure of rank heterophily\n\n  * \u201cedge office bearer\u201d (specified via the statistic \u201cnodecov(\"office.bearer\")\u201d, adding up for each edge {a,b} the number of office bearers in it); a positive (negative) parameter reveals that office bearers are typically co-arrested more (less) often\n\n  * \u201cdifferent office bearer\u201d (specified via the statistic \u201cabsdiff(\"office bearer\")\u201d, counting the number of edges {a,b} in which exactly one of a or b, but not both, is an office bearer); a positive parameter reveals that office bearers are typically co-arrested with non-office bearers; a negative parameter reveals that office bearers are typically co-arrested with office bearers and non-office bearers are typically co-arrested with non-office bearers; thus, it is a measure of heterophily with respect to being an office bearer\n\n### Complete network\n\nTERGM results for the complete network indicated that the network was sparse\n(negative parameter of the edges statistic) with a high positive closure\neffect. OMCG affiliates of higher rank tended to form more ties with co-\noffenders over time compared to those of lower rank, but these ties tend not\nto persist over time. Office bearers tend to be co-arrested with other office\nbearers, but those ties tended to not persist. The effect of closure for\npersistence had to be excluded from the model because the inclusion of the\neffect would cause the model not to converge.\n\n### Criminal Enterprise\n\nThe TERGM for Criminal Enterprise indicated that the network was sparse and\nhad a high closure effect. Co-offending ties with OMCG affiliates of higher\nrank tended to persist over time compared with those affiliates of lower rank.\nThe effects for closure, different rank, and office bearer persistence had to\nbe excluded from the model because the inclusion of the effect would cause the\nmodel not to converge.\n\n### Short Term Instrumental Acts\n\nThe TERGM for \u2018short term instrumental acts\u2019 indicated that the network was\nsparse and had a high closure effect. The effects of closure, homophily gang\nand different office bearer persistence had to be excluded from the model\nbecause the inclusion of the effect would cause the model not to converge.\n\n### Public Order\n\nThe TERGM for Public Order indicated that the network was sparse and had a\nhigh closure effect. OMCG affiliates of higher rank tended to form more ties\nwith co-offenders over time compared with affiliates of lower rank. The effect\nof closure for persistence had to be excluded from the model because the\ninclusion of the effect would cause the model not to converge.\n\n### Violence\n\nThe TERGM for Violence again indicated that the network was sparse and had a\nhigh closure effect. Office bearers tended to have more co-offenders compared\nwith non-office bearers. The effect of closure and difference office bearer\nfor persistence had to be excluded from the model because the inclusion of the\neffect would cause the model not to converge.\n\n### Other Offences Against the Person\n\nThe TERGM for \u2018other offences against the person\u2019 once again indicated that\nthe network was sparse and had a high closure effect. Office bearers tended to\nhave more co-offenders and they tended to co-offend with other office bearers.\nThe effects of closure, homophily gang, different rank, edge office bearer,\nand different office bearer for persistence had to be excluded from the model\nbecause the inclusion of the effect would cause the model not to converge\n(Tables\n\nTable 7 All network\n\nFull size table\n\n7,\n\nTable 8 Criminal enterprise\n\nFull size table\n\n8,\n\nTable 9 Short term instrumental acts\n\nFull size table\n\n9,\n\nTable 10 Public Order\n\nFull size table\n\n10,\n\nTable 11 Violence\n\nFull size table\n\n11,\n\nTable 12 Other offences against the person\n\nFull size table\n\n12).\n\n### Appendix 4: Simulation Results\n\nWe performed a limited number of analyses with simulated data in which we\nrandomly distort our empirical data to mimic some assumed pattern of missing\ndata. The goal of both simulation experiments is to assess how much our\nresults might change if we analyzed slightly different data. Specifically, we\nconsider two data-distortion mechanisms. In \u201csimulation 1\u201d we assume that in\nour empirical data we missed some event participants and consequently we add\nrandomly selected additional actors to the arrest events in our data. In\n\u201csimulation 2\u201d we assume that in our empirical data there is a certain\npercentage of \u201cwrong\u201d event participants and we replace some participants with\nrandomly selected other actors. We then analyze the distorted data with the\nRHEM for all crime types and compare obtained coefficients with the ones\nobtained from analyzing the empirical (undistorted) data.\n\n### Simulation 1\n\nMissing nodes: we iterate over the events and with probability p (in our\nsimulation we used p = 0.05 and p = 0.1) we add an additional randomly\nselected event participant. This data distortion mechanism assumes that we\nhave missed some of the \u201ctrue\u201d event participants in our empirical data and we\ntest with the simulated data whether such missing participants are likely to\nresult in very different findings.\n\n### Simulation 2\n\nDistorted nodes and edges: we iterate over all participants of all events and\nwith probability p (again we used p = 0.05 and p = 0.1 in our simulation) we\nexchange the current event participant with a randomly selected actor. This\ndata distortion mechanism assumes that in our empirical data we occasionally\nhave the \u201cwrong\u201d event participants.\n\nIn all simulation experiments, the coefficients obtained from analyzing the\ndistorted data would yield qualitatively the same results as those obtained\nfrom analyzing the empirical, undistorted data (Tables\n\nTable 13 Results of simulation 1 (p = 0.01)\n\nFull size table\n\n13,\n\nTable 14 Results of simulation 1 (p = 0.05)\n\nFull size table\n\n14,\n\nTable 15 Results of simulation 2 (p = 0.01)\n\nFull size table\n\n15, and\n\nTable 16 Results of simulation 2 (p = 0.05)\n\nFull size table\n\n16).\n\n## Rights and permissions\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate\ncredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
