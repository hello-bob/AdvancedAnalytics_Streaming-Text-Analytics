Since ad-\nsupported media gets paid by advertisers, they are fine with abusing you to\nmake advertisers happy, because the advertiser is the customer, and you are\nthe product.\n\nThis represents a profound misunderstanding of how even capitalism's champions\ndescribe its workings. The purported virtue of capitalism is that it\ntransforms the capitalist's greed into something of broad public value, by\nappealing to the capitalist's fear. A successful capitalist isn't merely\nsomeone figures out how to please their customers \u2013 they're also someone who\nfigures out how to please their suppliers.\n\nThat's why tech platforms were \u2013 until recently \u2013 very good to (some of) their\nworkforce. Technical labor was scarce and so platforms built whimsical\n\"campuses\" for tech workers, with amenities ranging from stock options to\ngourmet cafeterias to egg-freezing services for those workers planning to stay\nat their desks through their fertile years. Those workers weren't the\n\"customer\" \u2013 but they were treated better than any advertiser or user.\n\nBut when it came to easily replaced labor \u2013 testers, cleaning crew, the staff\nin those fancy cafeterias \u2013 the situation was much worse. Those workers were\nhired through cut-out shell companies, denied benefits, even made to enter via\nseparate entrances on shifts that were scheduled to minimize the chance that\nthey would ever interact with one of the highly paid tech workers at the firm.\n\nLikewise, advertisers may be the tech companies' \"customers\" but that doesn't\nmean the platforms treat them well. Advertisers get ripped off just like the\nrest of us. The platforms gouge them on price, lie to them about advertising\nreach, and collude with one another to fix prices and defraud advertisers:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost\n\nNow, it's true that the advertisers used to get a good deal from the\nplatforms, and that it came at the expense of the users. Facebook lured in\nusers by falsely promising never to spy on them. Then, once the users were\nlocked in, Facebook flipped a switch, started spying on users from asshole to\nappetite, and then offered rock-bottom-priced, fine-grained, highly reliable\nad-targeting to advertisers:\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247362\n\nBut once those advertisers were locked in, Facebook turned on them, too. Of\ncourse they did. The point of monopoly power isn't just getting too big to\nfail and too big to jail \u2013 it's getting too big to care:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/#kagi\n\nThis is the thing that \"if you're not paying for the product, you're the\nproduct\" fails to comprehend. \"If you're not paying for the product\" is\ngrounded in a cartoonish vision of markets in which \"the customer is king\" and\nsuccessful businesses are those who cater to their customers \u2013 even at the\nexpense of their workers and suppliers \u2013 will succeed.\n\nIn this frame, the advertiser is the platforms' customer, the customer is\nking, the platform inflicts unlimited harm upon all other stakeholders in\nservice to those advertisers, the advertisers are so pleased with this white-\nglove service that they willingly pay a handsome premium to use the platform,\nand so the platform grows unimaginably wealthy.\n\nBut of course, if the platforms inflict unlimited harms upon their users,\nthose users will depart, and then no amount of obsequious catering to\nadvertisers will convince them to spend money on ads that no one sees. In the\ncargo-cult conception of platform capitalism, the platforms are able to solve\nthis problem by \"hacking our dopamine loops\" \u2013 depriving us of our free will\nwith \"addictive\" technologies that keep us locked to their platforms even when\nthey grow so terrible that we all hate using them.\n\nThis means that we can divide the platform economy into \"capitalists\" who sell\nyou things, and \"surveillance capitalists\" who use surveillance data to\ncontrol your mind, then sell your compulsive use of their products to their\ncherished customers, the advertisers.\n\nSurveillance capitalists like Google are thus said to have only been shamming\nwhen they offered us a high-quality product. That was just a means to an end:\nthe good service Google offered in its golden age was just bait to trick us\ninto handing over enough surveillance data that they could tune their mind-\ncontrol technology, strip us of our free will, and then sell us to their\nbeloved advertisers, for whom nothing is too good.\n\nMeanwhile, the traditional capitalists \u2013 the companies that sell you things \u2013\nare the good capitalists. Apple and Microsoft are disciplined by market\ndynamics. They won't spy on you because you're their customer, and so they\nhave to keep you happy.\n\nAll this leads to an inexorable conclusion: unless we pay for things with\nmoney, we are doomed. Any attempt to pay with attention will end in a free-\nfor-all where the platforms use their Big Data mind-control rays to drain us\nof all our attention. It is only when we pay with money that we can dicker\nover price and arrive at a fair and freely chosen offer.\n\nThis theory is great for tech companies: it elevates giving them money to a\ndemocracy-preserving virtue. It reframes handing your cash over to a multi-\ntrillion dollar tech monopolist as good civics. It's easy to see why those\ntech giants would like that story, but boy, are you a sap if you but it.\n\nBecause all capitalists are surveillance capitalists...when they can get away\nwith it. Sure, Apple blocked Facebook from spying on Ios users...and then\nstarted illegally, secretly spying on those users and lying about it, in order\nto target ads to those users:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar\n\nAnd Microsoft spies on every Office 365 user and rats them out to their bosses\n(\"Marge, this analytics dashboard says you're the division's eleventh-worst\nspeller and twelfth-worst typist. Shape up or ship out!\"). But the joke's on\nyour boss: Microsoft also spies on their whole company and sells the data\nabout it to their competitors:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revengel\n\nThe platforms screw anyone they can. Sure, they lured in advertisers with good\ntreatment, but once those advertisers were locked in, they fucked them over\njust as surely as they fucked over their users.\n\nThe surveillance capitalism hypothesis depends on the existence of a\nhypothetical \u2013 and wildly improbably \u2013 Big Data mind-control technology that\nkeeps users locked to platforms even when the platform decays. Mind-control\nrays are an extraordinary claim supported by the thinnest of evidence\n(marketing materials from the companies as they seek to justify charging a\npremium to advertisers, combined with the self-serving humblebrags of\nmillionaire Prodigal Tech Bros who claim to have awakened to the evil of using\ntheir dopamine-hacking sorcerous powers on behalf of their billionaire\nemployers).\n\nThere is a much simpler explanation for why users stay on platforms even as\nthey decline in quality: they are enmeshed in a social service that\nencompasses their friends, loved ones, customers, and communities. Even if\neveryone in this sprawling set of interlocking communities agrees that the\nplatform is terrible, they will struggle to agree on what to do about it:\nwhere to go next and when to leave. This is the economists' \"collective action\nproblem\" \u2013 a phenomenon with a much better evidentiary basis than the\nhypothetical, far-fetched \"dopamine loop\" theory.\n\nTo understand whom a platform treats well and whom it abuses, look not to who\npays it and who doesn't. Instead, ask yourself: who has the platform locked\nin? The more any stakeholder to a platform stands to lose by leaving, the\nworse the platform can treat them without risking their departure. Thus the\nbeneficent face that tech companies turn to their most cherished tech workers,\nand the hierarchy of progressively more-abusive conditions for other workers \u2013\nworse treatment for those whose work-visas are tied to their employment, and\nthe very worst treatment for contractors testing the code, writing the\ndocumentation, labelling the data or cleaning the toilets.\n\nIf you care about how people are treated by platforms, you can't just tell\nthem to pay for services instead of using ad-supported media. The most\nimportant factor in getting decent treatment out of a tech company isn't\nwhether you pay with cash instead of attention \u2013 it's whether you're locked\nin, and thus a flight risk whom the platform must cater to.\n\nIt's perfectly possible for market dynamics to play out in a system in which\nwe pay with our attention by watching ads. More than 50% of all web users have\ninstalled an ad-blocker, the largest boycott in the history of civilization:\n\nhttps://doc.searls.com/2023/11/11/how-is-the-worlds-biggest-boycott-doing/\n\nAd-supported companies make an offer: How about in exchange for looking at\nthis content, you let us spy on you in ways that would make Orwell blush and\nthen cram a torrent of targeted ads into your eyeballs?\" Ad-blockers let you\nmake a counter-offer: \"How about 'nah'?\"\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah\n\nBut ad-blocking is only possible on an open platform. A closed, locked-down\nplatform that is illegal to modify isn't a walled garden, a fortress that\nkeeps out the bad guys \u2013 it's a walled prison that locks you in, a prisoner of\nthe worst impulses of the tech giant that built it. Apple can defend you from\nother companies' spying ways, but when Apple decides to spy on you, it's a\nfelony to jailbreak your Iphone and block Apple's surveillance:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2023/02/05/battery-vampire/#drained\n\nI am no true believer in markets \u2013 but the people who say that paying for\nproducts will \"align incentives\" and make tech better claim to believe in the\npower of markets to make everyone better off. But real markets aren't just\nplaces where companies sell things \u2013 they're also places where companies buy\nthings. Monopolies short-circuit the power of customer choice to force\ncompanies to do better. But monoposonies \u2013 markets dominated by powerful\nbuyers \u2013 are just as poisonous to the claimed benefits of markets.\n\nEven if you are \"the product\" \u2013 that is, even if you're selling your attention\nto a platform to package up and sell to an advertiser \u2013 that in no way\nprecludes your getting decent treatment from the platform. A world where we\ncan avail ourselves of blockers, where interoperablity eases our exodus from\nabusive platforms, where privacy law sets a floor below which we cannot\nbargain is a world where it doesn't matter if you're \"the product\" or \"the\ncustomer\" \u2013 you can still get a square deal.\n\nThe platforms used to treat us well and now treat us badly. That's not because\nthey were setting a patient trap, luring us in with good treatment in the\nexpectation of locking us in and turning on us. Tech bosses do not have the\nexecutive function to lie in wait for years and years.\n\nRather, as tech platforms eliminated competition, captured their regulators\nand expanded their IP rights so that interoperability was no longer a threat,\nthey became too big to care whether any of their stakeholders were happy.\nFirst they came for the users, sure, but then they turned on the publishers,\nthe advertisers, and finally, even their once-pampered tech workers:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2023/09/10/the-proletarianization-of-tech-workers/\n\nMLK said that \"the law can't make a man love me, but it can stop him from\nlynching me.\" It's impossible to get tech bosses to believe you deserve care\nand decency, but you can stop them from abusing you. The way to do that is by\nmaking them fear you \u2013 by abolishing the laws that create lock-in, by legally\nenshrining a right to privacy, by protecting competition.\n\nIt's not by giving them money. Paying for a service does not make a company\nfear you, and anyone who thinks they can buy a platform's loyalty by paying\nfor a service is a simp. A corporation is an immortal, transhuman colony\norganism that uses us as inconvenient gut-flora: no matter how much you love\nit, it will never love you back. It can't experience love \u2013 only fear.\n\n# Hey look at this (permalink)\n\n# This day in history (permalink)\n\n#20yrsago Bill O\u2019Reilly mistakes Globe and Mail for Socialist
