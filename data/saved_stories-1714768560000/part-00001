It was the first time on record that seas had been\nthat high without a hurricane. A winter storm that coincided with the elevated\nocean left dozens of streets closed. One resident drowned in her car. Hundreds\nof vehicles were damaged or destroyed, including some that were inundated in a\ncruise terminal parking lot.\n\nThe average sea level at Charleston has risen by 7 inches since 2010, four\ntimes the rate of the previous 30 years.\n\nJacksonville, Fla., where seas rose 6 inches in the past 14 years, recently\nstudied its vulnerability. It found that more than a quarter of major roads\nhave the potential to become inaccessible to emergency response vehicles amid\nflooding, and the number of residents who face flood risks could more than\ntriple in coming decades.\n\nGalveston, Tex., has experienced an extraordinary rate of sea level rise \u2014 8\ninches in 14 years. Experts say it has been exacerbated by fast-sinking land.\nHigh-tide floods have struck at least 141 times since 2015, and scientists\nproject their frequency will grow rapidly. Officials are planning to install\nseveral huge pump stations in coming years, largely funded through federal\ngrants. The city manager expects each pump to cost more than $60 million \u2014 a\nfigure that could eclipse the city\u2019s annual tax revenue.\n\nAssistant City Manager Brandon Cook shows construction plans that include\nadding a pump station to help mitigate the impacts of sea level rise and\nrepeated flooding in Galveston, Tex. (Danielle Villasana for The Washington\nPost)\n\nFor this analysis, The Post relied on tide gauge data, which reflects the rise\nin sea level and sinking of land. Satellite data, which solely measures the\nheight of oceans, was used for global measurements.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon is so new, we still don\u2019t necessarily even have the vocabulary\nfor it,\u201d Christopher Piecuch, a sea level scientist at Woods Hole\nOceanographic Institution, said of the unrelenting nature of flooding\nconfronting more and more communities. \u201cThis is something that quite literally\ndidn\u2019t happen two decades ago.\u201d\n\nBut it undoubtedly is happening now. The number of high-tide floods is rapidly\nincreasing in the region, with incidents happening five times as often as they\ndid in 1990, said William Sweet, an oceanographer for the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing flooding in a way that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Sweet, who\nleads the agency\u2019s high-tide flooding assessments. \u201cThat is just the\nstatistics doing the talking.\u201d\n\nProjections suggest that the flooding of today will look modest compared with\nwhat lies ahead. High-tide floods in the region are expected to strike 15\ntimes more frequently in 2050 than they did in 2020, Sweet said.\n\nHere are glimpses at three spots along a roughly 200-mile stretch of the U.S.\nGulf Coast that are already confronting this new reality:\n\nMap showing a section of the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Florida highlighting\nthe locations of St. Tammany Parish, La., Mobile, Ala. and Pensacola, Fla.\n\nMISS.\n\nALA.\n\nMobile\n\n5.9\n\nSt. Tammany\n\nParish\n\nFLA.\n\nPensacola\n\n6.5\n\n5.1\n\n6.1\n\n4.4\n\n6.7\n\nLA.\n\n4.7\n\nNew Orleans\n\n6.7 in.\n\nMISS.\n\nALA.\n\nMobile\n\n5.9\n\nFLA.\n\nSt. Tammany\n\nParish\n\nPensacola\n\n6.5\n\n5.1\n\n6.1\n\n4.4\n\n6.7\n\nLA.\n\n4.7\n\nNew Orleans\n\n6.7 in.\n\nMISS.\n\nALA.\n\nMobile\n\n5.9\n\nFLA.\n\nSt. Tammany\n\nParish\n\nPensacola\n\n6.5\n\nLA.\n\n4.4\n\n5.1\n\n6.1\n\n6.7\n\n4.7\n\nNew Orleans\n\n6.7 in.\n\n##### Mobile, Ala., 5.9 inches of sea level rise since 2010\n\n### The inequity of rising water\n\n#### \u2018People of color are more likely to experience flooding\u2019 \u2014 and the city\nis working to adapt.\n\nWater covers Texas Street, a road in Mobile, Ala., that often floods from high\ntides and rain. (The Washington Post)\n\nThe inequities of the past and the changing threats of the present are\ncolliding in this centuries-old port city.\n\nHere, as in other cities, the legacy of unequal federal housing policies\ndating to the 1930s, known as redlining \u2014 a discriminatory practice that in\nparticular targeted Black Americans \u2014 left minority and low-income residents\nconfined to certain areas. Over time, they faced the heavy burden of\nindustrial pollution. Some of these same neighborhoods are now grappling with\nrising waters.\n\n\u201cThe acknowledgment and acceptance of these historic inequities and their\npresent-day impacts is a necessary, critical step,\u201d city officials wrote in a\nrecent report, adding: \u201c[P]eople of color are more likely to experience\nflooding in Mobile.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s partly due to relatively flat topography that allows higher water\nlevels to travel farther inland and cause more severe flooding than in the\npast. The report said that many of the affected neighborhoods are low-lying\nand have decaying storm water systems, making them particularly vulnerable.\n\nRodneyka Lofton has lived in the same house on St. Emanuel Street, along a\nswath of Mobile\u2019s heavily industrialized waterfront, for \u201ca majority of my\nlife,\u201d she said.\n\nRodneyka Lofton said she has spent \u201ca majority of my life\u201d living near\nMobile\u2019s heavily industrialized waterfront. Her neighborhood floods after\nrainstorms and high tides. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cSometimes, it makes me feel not safe,\u201d Lofton said one morning of the\nfloodwaters that often submerge her street and other roads that lie about a\nquarter-mile from the Mobile River near where it ends at Mobile Bay.\n\n\u201cOn my street, and on the back street over there, it looks like a small lake.\nAnd a lot of cars get stuck,\u201d said Lofton, a nursing assistant. Only a handful\nof residents remain here, amid rows of semitrailers, a junkyard and a large\ncontainer facility.\n\nAlong some areas of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, recent research suggests,\nlow-income and minority residents are likely to face a deepening burden as\nclimate change fuels rising seas and more intense rainfalls.\n\n\u201cFlood risk is not borne equally by all,\u201d wrote the authors of a 2022 study in\nthe journal Nature Climate Change. In particular, they wrote, \u201cThe future\nincrease in risk will disproportionately impact Black communities, while\nremaining concentrated on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.\u201d\n\nNear Lofton\u2019s home, recent data suggest the burden already is increasing.\n\nThe tide gauge at the nearby Mobile State Docks has registered about 6 inches\nof sea level rise since 2010.\n\nTexas Street, around the corner from Lofton\u2019s home, was once again inundated\none morning earlier this year. A car was inching through deep water.\n\nRain had fallen the previous night, but the flooding was destined to linger\ndue to high seas. A coastal researcher from the University of South Alabama,\nBret Webb, had recently outfitted a sensor in one of the street\u2019s drains. It\nshowed that the base of the drain is now frequently lower than the waters in\nthe Mobile River, preventing drainage.\n\nAs Mobile\u2019s chief resilience officer, Casi Callaway works to gird the city\u2019s\nresidents and its infrastructure for the growing stresses posed by climate\nchange and other challenges. She said Mobile has been steadily upgrading roads\nand the pipes beneath them \u2014 and aims to do so near Lofton\u2019s home.\n\nBut she said it will take at least $30 million to fix drainage problems in an\narea where some storm water pipes are over a century old and made of wood. The\ncity has applied for several grants to perform the work but has not yet\nreceived funding.\n\nCasi Callaway, Mobile\u2019s chief resilience officer, looks for drainage outflows.\n(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cEvery dollar we invest should be a dollar spent preparing for what is\ncoming,\u201d said Callaway, who previously headed a local environmental group.\n\nOver a century of history and memory also lie in the path of floodwaters.\n\nThat is evident in the Old Plateau Cemetery in Africatown. The neighborhood in\nMobile was founded by formerly enslaved people who arrived in 1860 on the\nClotilda \u2014 the last known slave ship to leave Africa for the United States \u2014\nand their descendants.\n\nThe historic burial ground dates to 1876, and appears to have been warped by\nsinking land and repeated flooding. Many graves now rest at angles. Some are\nsunken and fill regularly with rainwater, and those at the lowest-lying points\nare in disrepair.\n\nRepeated flooding has left graves at the Old Plateau Cemetery in Mobile, Ala.,\nsunken and in disrepair. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nWhile multiple factors probably play a role in the cemetery\u2019s flooding\nproblems, there are two ways rising seas can make them worse, said Alex Beebe,\na geologist at the University of South Alabama who has studied the cemetery.\nAs waters in Mobile Bay and the Gulf of Mexico rise, the water flowing\ndownhill through Africatown to the coast will have more trouble escaping, he\nsaid. A higher ocean is also causing groundwater tables to rise, making it\nharder for rainfall to penetrate the soil.\n\nFor Yuvonne Brazier, the flooding is just part of a bigger inequity in\nAfricatown, which also is hemmed in by heavy industry.\n\nBrazier\u2019s grandfather and her sister, who died when she was young, are buried\nin the cemetery, along with many of the founders of the community.\n\nBut Brazier can no longer find the graves. She used to be able to sit on her\nmother\u2019s front porch and see the cemetery where her loved ones were buried.\nThat familiar landscape has grown less familiar over time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all different now,\u201d she said.\n\nYuvonne Brazier and her husband, Darryl Brazier, look for their family\nmembers' graves at Old Plateau Cemetery, whose landscape has been warped by\ncontinuous flooding.

But they\nlack that city\u2019s human-made protections against water. Now high tides had\ncaused yet another flood, an increasingly common occurrence due to 6 inches of\nsea level rise in the lake \u2014 which is directly connected to the Gulf of Mexico\n\u2014 since 2010.\n\nBruhl, a 37-year-old avid duck hunter, loves this place.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get my own grip around for myself and my family,\u201d\nsaid Bruhl, a member of the St. Tammany Levee, Drainage and Conservation\nDistrict whose home flooded in 2021\u2019s Hurricane Ida. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to\ncontinue to live here, we\u2019ve got to find a protection that can mitigate a lot\nof this, because at some point it becomes not sustainable anymore.\u201d\n\nIt is a predicament reverberating throughout the vulnerable parish, home to\nabout 275,000 people. A home building boom since Hurricane Katrina has\nreplaced vast stretches of land with asphalt and other surfaces that can\nworsen flooding. Some communities, crisscrossed with canals, are difficult to\ndefend. Mandeville has a sea wall and Slidell has a few inland levees. But\nit\u2019s nothing like the protections engineered for New Orleans.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wants to change that. It has outlined plans\nto spend an estimated $5.9 billion protecting St. Tammany Parish alone.\n\nUnder the plans, which are years from becoming reality, Slidell would get its\nown nearly 19-mile-long levee and floodwall, and officials would raise parts\nof Interstate 10. A significant expenditure would go toward raising or flood-\nproofing more than 6,400 structures, mostly homes, in the parish. One of\nthose, Bruhl said, would be his own.\n\nThe changes, the Corps has said, are aimed at mitigating repeated flood events\nthat have \u201ccaused major disruptions, damages, and adverse economic impacts to\nthe parish.\u201d While the plan factors in sea level rise, it is centrally\ntargeted at stopping hurricanes and river-driven floods \u2014 not necessarily the\nsunny-day flooding that happens with increased regularity.\n\nIn parts of St. Tammany, homeowners remain divided about the massive\nundertaking.\n\nDonna and Kevin McDonald, who run a construction company in the Slidell area,\nare \u201con the fence\u201d about the project, Donna said. They\u2019re not sure it is the\nsolution, but they certainly recognize the problem.\n\nDonna and Kevin McDonald\u2019s home on Bayou Liberty has flooded seven times since\n1995.

But soon,\nheavy rains coincided with a days-long tidal surge in Lake Pontchartrain and\nthe set was inundated, delaying production. The surge was the 10th-highest\nwater level recorded at the tide gauge in New Orleans, and the highest that\ndidn\u2019t come from a hurricane or tropical storm.\n\nIt was just another reminder of how water \u2014 more and more of it \u2014 is altering\nlife here.\n\nKevin McDonald has lived in this same house for all his 71 years.

This is adjusted for seasonal signals for ocean\ntemperature, currents, and other marine and atmospheric variables.\n\nFor its analysis, The Post relied on dozens of tide gauges along the coasts of\nthe United States, measurements that are affected both by the rising ocean and\nslow but persistent movement of land. It also took into account satellite data\nfor global sea level rise, which measures ocean heights independent of land\nmovement.\n\nAnnual means for two time periods \u2014 1980 to 2009 and 2010 to 2023 \u2014 were\ncalculated. Only gauges that had at least eight months of data for a given\nyear and 70 percent of the years were used. Three gauges used in this analysis\nare not currently in service but had sufficient data for the 1980 to 2023 time\nperiod to include in the analysis.\n\nA linear regression model was applied to the annual means for each gauge to\ndetermine the trends for each time period and calculate an annual rate of\nrelative mean sea level rise. Because readings from tide gauges are also\ninfluenced by the rising or sinking of land, these findings are referred to as\nchanges in relative mean sea level.\n\nTo analyze changes in sea level around the globe, The Post used data based on\nsatellite altimetry readings produced by NOAA. Annual means were calculated\nfor 1993 through 2023 for the global data and for each ocean. The Post applied\na linear regression model estimating the annual rates of change in mean sea\nlevel for each ocean and the global average. The data from the satellite\naltimeters are measures of ocean height independent of any land movement, or\nabsolute means.\n\nThe Post is displaying data for tide gauges on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts\nthat showed significant trends in mean sea level change from 2010 to 2023.\n\nScientists have studied regional trends in sea level rise, including Jianjun\nYin and S\u00f6nke Dangendorf, among others. The Post\u2019s analysis builds on this\nbody of work and compares trends for the 2010-2023 and 1980-2009 time periods\nto drive home the rate of acceleration in recent years. The Post also presents\nthe trends for each tide gauge included.\n\n### More on climate change\n\nUnderstanding our climate: Global warming is a real phenomenon, and weather\ndisasters are undeniably linked to it.
