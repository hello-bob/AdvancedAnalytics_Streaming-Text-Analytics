But gravity can be the opposite of that. As I\nresearched my book during the sleep-deprived days of the pandemic, flashbacks\nto the role gravity had played in some of my most memorable moments kept\npopping into my mind: swinging in hammocks in the Amazon, learning to fly over\nNiagara Falls, or simply letting myself go in the arms of loved ones. It\nslowly became clear to me why my colleagues and I had dedicated so much effort\nto uncovering our theory of \u201cmassive gravity.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nTechnically, the theory we had discovered is a model in which the graviton,\nthe particle that mediates the gravitational force, has a mass. It is a\ndescription of gravity that goes beyond Einstein\u2019s theory of general\nrelativity in an attempt to tackle some of the most challenging questions we\ncurrently face in theoretical physics at the interface between cosmology and\nparticle physics. But whereas Einstein\u2019s theory, with its infinite range, is\nrigid and inflexible, our theory is essentially finite: It switches off and\nlets go at a certain point. It is Einstein\u2019s theory with a sense of humor:\nSeriously weighty some of the time, but with a hidden ability to unwind and\nhave a little fun under the right circumstances.\n\nA WEIGHTY MATTER: Claudia de Rham and her colleagues discovered a new theory\nof gravity they call \u201cmassive gravity.\u201d It proposes that the graviton, the\nparticle that mediates the gravitational force, has mass. Their theory, they\nsay, is finite. It switches off at a certain point, and so only applies to the\nworkings of the universe some of the time. \u201cIt\u2019s Einsteins\u2019 theory with a\nsense of humor,\u201d says de Rham.

It indicates that\nenergy equals mass times the speed of light squared\u2014that energy and mass are\nequivalent under the right conditions. We take it for granted every day as we\nenjoy the light and warmth of the sun, an energy it produces by shedding 4.7\nmillion tons of mass every single second. By now, I\u2019m sure that most of the\npeople living on this planet will have seen this formula printed in a book or\non a T-shirt. However, explaining what these concepts mean in practice can be\nso much more challenging than explaining some of the seemingly more technical\nand obscure equations I\u2019m used to dealing with. The equation may also be among\nthe most misunderstood.\n\n3 The speed of darkness sometimes exceeds the speed of light\n\nI love explaining physical concepts to children or children-in-spirit as they\nsee through everything and go straight to the point. I\u2019ve tried so many times\nto talk about the speed of light and, invariably, I get interrupted within a\nmatter of seconds, challenged to compare it with the speed of darkness\u2014before\nthe conversation quickly flows chaotically into black holes, the end of the\nworld, and dinosaurs.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

In some situations, this dark energy can also propagate waves\nat a finite speed. Interestingly, the speed of these waves of darkness can in\nsome cases be greater than that of light itself.\n\nIf our universe was flat and unvarying (a flat spacetime), traveling faster\nthan light would be strictly forbidden. But our universe is so much more\ninteresting. It evolves in time and carries spacetime curvature, underpinned\nby gravity, in ways that can make the seemingly impossible come to life and\nexceed our wildest imagination.\n\nLead image: cybermagician / Shutterstock\n\n  * ###### Claudia de Rham\n\nPosted on April 25, 2024\n\nClaudia de Rham is a theoretical physicist based at Imperial College London.\nHer work at the interface of gravity, cosmology and particle physics won her\nthe Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists in 2020. Her book The Beauty of\nFalling: A Life in Pursuit of Gravity tells the fascinating personal story of\nde Rham\u2019s quest to gain intimacy with gravity, to understand both its feeling\nand fundamental nature. She is an active campaigner against the\nunderrepresentation of girls in physics.\n\n#### Get the Nautilus newsletter\n\nCutting-edge science, unraveled by the very brightest living thinkers.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Age of Rebellion\n\nHistory\n\nThe Feminist Botanist\n\nPsychology\n\nThe Psychology of Getting High\u2014a Lot\n\n  * Explore\n\n## The Age of Rebellion\n\n    * By Katharine Gammon\n    * April 23, 2024\n    * History\n\nThe surprising relationship between age and success in rebellions.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## The Feminist Botanist\n\n    * By Rebecca Batley\n    * April 22, 2024\n    * History\n\nA 19th-century tale of hermaphrodite flowers, Charles Darwin, and women\u2019s\nright to vote.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## The Psychology of Getting High\u2014a Lot\n\n    * By Michael Inzlicht\n    * April 19, 2024\n    * Psychology\n\nTime to extinguish the slacker cliche.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## The Shark Whisperer\n\n    * By Katharine Gammon\n    * April 18, 2024\n    * Zoology\n\nDonald Nelson spent his life undoing the damage that Jaws did to the\nperception of sharks.\n\n  * Explore\n\n## Nine Rebel Astronomy Theories That Went Dark\n\n    * By Tom Metcalfe\n    * April 17, 2024\n    * Astronomy\n\nBright ideas from astronomy\u2019s biggest stars haven\u2019t always worked out.\n\n## NAUTILUS: SCIENCE CONNECTED\n\nNautilus is a different kind of science magazine.
