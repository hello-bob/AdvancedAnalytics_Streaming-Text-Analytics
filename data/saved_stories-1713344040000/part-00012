There, while I was in line for the gondola, a British\ntourist struck up a conversation with me. It came up that I had come to the\narea for a conference on a psychological theory, so she asked me what it was\nabout.\n\n\u201cPositive disintegration?\u201d the woman echoed. \u201cWell, that sounds horrid,\ndoesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nWhile I was a bit disappointed by the sudden termination of her curiosity, she\nwas admittedly voicing a common reaction. Disintegration does indeed sound\nhorrid, and even the positive form is no walk in the park. The reason it\u2019s\npositive, however, is that the thing that disintegrates is your \u201cadjustment\u201d\nto things that maybe you don\u2019t want to be well adjusted to in the first place.\nAs author Philip K. Dick once said,\n\n### \u201cIt is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.\u201d\n\nAnd what I\u2019m pretty sure that what he means by \u201cgo insane\u201d is what Dabrowski\ncalls disintegration.\n\n\u2605\n\nWe\u2019d better define this precisely. So here\u2019s what I\u2019ve pulled from the\nglossary of Dabrowski\u2019s 1970 book, Mental Growth Through Positive\nDisintegration, co-authored with philosopher and psychologist Andrzej Kawczak\nand microbiologist Michael Piechowski:\n\n> DISINTEGRATION, mental, consists of loosening, disorganization or\n> dissolution of mental structures and functions. The term covers a wide range\n> of states from temporary loosening of contact with reality observable in\n> severe fatigue, boredom, depression, stress, mental conflicts,\n> disequilibrium, neurosis or psychoneurosis to a split of personality in\n> schizophrenia. \u201cNormal\u201d symptoms of disintegration are distinctly and almost\n> universally observable at the time of puberty and menopause, also at times\n> of critical experience, suffering, inner conflicts, intense joy or\n> exaltation, etc.\n\nSuffice it to say, virtually everyone experiences some form of disintegration\nin their lives, though not the most severe kinds. (In other words, I\u2019m not\ntalking about schizophrenia here.)\n\nAnd disintegration is certainly not always positive. Dabrowski himself began\ndeveloping his theory after a friend committed suicide\u2014the ultimate negative\ndisintegration. So let\u2019s make the distinction clear. Here I\u2019m paraphrasing\nsome professional jargon in the Mental Growth\u2018s glossary:\n\n  * Negative disintegration occurs when a person does not manage to harness his or her own capacity for growth.\n\n  * Positive disintegration is what happens when a person lets go of the way he or she previously made sense of the world and rebuilds it in line with what s/he determines to be his/her own authentic values.\n\nIn other words, they reintegrate at a higher level\u2014that is, a level that is\n\u201cmore themselves\u201d and less directed by whatever unhealthy beliefs have lodged\nin their heads, whether about their role in society, what constitutes success,\nthe nature of happiness, or what have you. The process takes years and years.\nIt also frequently involves sacrifices.\n\n\u2605\n\nSo we\u2019ve discussed overexcitability already. OE matters because if a person is\nabsorbing and responding to significantly more stimuli than average, that\u2019s\nalso going to include more of the troubles and absurdities.\n\nDabrowski spoke of the \u201cbig three\u201d OEs as particularly important to his\ntheory: imaginational OE, which helps people envision how the world could be\ndifferent; intellectual OE, which helps a person figure out how to get there;\nand emotional OE\u2014which Dabrowski considered essential to reach the highest\nlevels of development\u2014fuels a desire to make it happen. People with\noverexcitability, especially the emotional sort, find it harder to \u201cjust let\nit go,\u201d where \u201cit\u201d could be perceived injustice, stupidity, suffering,\ncruelty, mortality, and so on.\n\nSo you can probably see why overexcitable people are predisposed to develop\nwhat Dabrowski referred to in his day as psychoneuroses. The word\n\u201cpsychoneurosis\u201d isn\u2019t used in diagnoses nowadays, but Merriam-Webster defines\nit as a neurosis based on emotional conflict in which an impulse that has been\nblocked seeks expression in a disguised response or symptom. This could\nmanifest as anxiety, depression, interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict, or\nany number of other mild, moderate, or severe symptoms of maladjustment.\nHere\u2019s a sample of what Dabrowski had to say on the subject, from\npositivedisintegration.com:\n\n> Without passing through very difficult experiences and even something like\n> psychoneurosis and neurosis we cannot understand human beings and we cannot\n> realize our multidimensional and multilevel development toward higher and\n> higher levels.\n\nDabrowski based this statement on his treatment of many patients over the\nyears. (Check out a documentary on YouTube called Be Greeted Psychoneurotics\nif you\u2019d like to see him in action working with patients.) He himself was\nthrown in jail by the Nazis and later suffered under the Stalin\u2019s lackeys in\nhis native Poland, where he was trying to develop centers for mental health\nthat were not in line with what the Communists wanted mental health to be. So\nwhen Dabrowski suggested that it\u2019s good to be maladjusted to an unhealthy\nsociety, he knew what he was talking about.\n\nIf he\u2019d been allowed to establish his system of mental health, by the way,\nhere\u2019s the understanding on which it would have been based:\n\n> In our opinion, much too often in psychology, education, and psychiatry,\n> adjustment is discussed as positive and maladjustment as negative. In the\n> attitude of adjustment, we can easily isolate two forms. First we can see a\n> form of adjustment to the low level of reality of everyday life. This is a\n> noncreative, nondevelopmental, automatic adjustment. The second form of\n> adjustment is adjustment not to that which is actually present, but to that\n> which arises as a new, higher level of mental life. It may be called\n> adjustment to that which \u201cought to be.\u201d (p. 39)\n\nIf that\u2019s a little too textbooky for you, try this quote from the playwright\nGeorge Bernard Shaw, which Robert F. Kennedy adopted in his 1968 presidential\ncampaign:\n\n#### \u201cYou see things; and you say, \u2018Why?\u2019 But I dream things that never were;\nand I say, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking, huh, that sounds like a load of garbage; the world is the\nway it is and there\u2019s no point stressing yourself out fighting it, well, thank\nyou for reading this far and have a nice day; the rest of this is not likely\nto interest you. Even though such a cynic rightfully draws our attention to\nthe magnitude of the challenges, we nevertheless do see human catalysts\narising from time to time, making positive change in the world. These\npeople\u2014from Socrates to Gandhi to Lincoln\u2014could be said to be adjusted to what\nought to be. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not lost on you that these men in particular paid a\ntremendous price for their adjustment to a higher level. But we admire such\npeople in history (if not always when we\u2019re face to face with them) and most\nof us agree that civilization owes them a debt of gratitude.\n\nBut where do these catalysts come from? After witnessing World War I as a\nyouth and World War II as an adult, Dabrowski began to ask precisely this\nquestion. He saw some collaborate with Nazis while others risked their lives\nto save Jews and others facing persecution. He took particular note of the\n\u201cpositively maladjusted\u201d\u2014the people who wouldn\u2019t just go along with it. What\nhis work suggests is that a person who feels the kind of deep frustration\nwe\u2019re talking about here is precisely the sort of person who can become this\nkind of human catalyst. Let us hope we won\u2019t ever need it again on the level\nDabrowski witnessed\u2014but there\u2019s still plenty of work for such people to do.\n\nOne other thing: we don\u2019t need to focus solely on those who became famous for\ntheir great works. TPD can also help us understand the catalysts and exemplars\nwe meet in our everyday lives\u2014people we know and care about who may\nsimultaneously have great potential even as they\u2019re struggling with\nmaladjustment.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw would clearly have understood the concept of positive\ndisintegration:\n\n#### \u201cThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one\npersists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress\ndepends on the unreasonable man.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re still with me, then let\u2019s move on to explore dynamisms and the\nlevels of development.\n\n### Please share this post!\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * More\n\n  * Tumblr\n  * Pinterest\n\nLike Loading...\n\n## 6 thoughts on \u201cHow Can \u201cDisintegration\u201d Be Positive?\u201d\n\n  1. Fred says:\n\nNovember 28, 2016 at 1:03 pm\n\nIt would seem that accepting what is not right would also be a cause for\nmental illness. It would seem to me that there could/should be an interplay\nbetween the imagination, the intellect, and the emotions. In fact, an\nimbalance could lead to negative disintegration, and hamper the potential of\npositive disintegration.\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\nReply\n\n    1. Jessie says:\n\nNovember 28, 2016 at 8:22 pm\n\nFred, I think you\u2019re spot on, and Dabrowski would agree. If your choices are\nnegative adjustment and positive maladjustment, the latter is the healthy one.\nHe also talks about \u201cone-sided development,\u201d which sounds like what you\u2019re\ndescribing here in terms of an imbalance. This tends to come up in the form of\nevil dictators who are brilliant in terms of coming up with theory, but not so\nmuch in the moral/emotional realm.\n\nThanks for the comment and glad you found something here of potential value to\nyou!\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n  2. Lucinda Leo says:\n\nFebruary 9, 2017 at 4:00 am\n\nJessie, Thank you so much for taking the time to write about Dabrowski\u2019s\ntheories and OEs here. Someone on the PowerWood parenting-with-OEs Facebook\ngroup was asking about TPD and I pointed her over here, which brought me back\nfor another read. You have a real talent for bringing to life what many can\nonly describe in dry academic language. Your blog helps me remember that a bit\nof unravelling now and then isn\u2019t just okay, it\u2019s necessary for me to become\nmore of who I want to be.\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\nReply\n\n    1. Jessie says:\n\nFebruary 11, 2017 at 6:46 pm\n\nThank you, Lucinda! What a kind thing to say, and especially meaningful to me.\nThank you also for sending the PowerWood folks over here. That\u2019s a tremendous\nresource and I\u2019ve found useful things there myself, even though I\u2019m not a\nparent and not in the UK.\n\nUnravellers unite! That\u2019s what it looks like to have a growth spurt as an\nadult, I\u2019d say.\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\nReply\n\n  3.
