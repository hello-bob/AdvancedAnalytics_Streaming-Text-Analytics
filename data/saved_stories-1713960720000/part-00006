His lab has published papers on how the internet became a fun-\nhouse mirror of extreme political opinions, why the news media has a strong\nnegativity bias, why certain emotions go viral online, why tribalism is\ninflamed by online activity, and how the internet can make us seem like the\nworst versions of ourselves. At the same time, Van Bavel emphasizes that many\nof the group psychology dynamics that can make social media seem like a\ndumpster fire are also core to what makes humankind such a special and\ningenious species. We discuss the four dark laws of online engagement and the\nbasics of group psychology.\n\nIf you have questions, observations, or ideas for future episodes, email us at\nPlainEnglish@Spotify.com.\n\nIn the following excerpt, Derek and Jay Van Bavel dive into the basics of\ngroup psychology and discuss how that plays a part in social media engagement.\n\nDerek Thompson: Jay, you and I are going to spend most of this episode talking\nabout your empirical research on how the internet, and social media in\nparticular, holds a fun-house mirror to the human condition and why I think\nthe incentives and engagement structures of social media are truly driving\nmany people slowly insane. But first, how would you describe your work? What\u2019s\nthe big question that you and your lab are trying to answer?\n\nJay Van Bavel: Yeah, I think the big question that\u2019s animated me for the last\n20 years in my research is about the nature of groups and identity and how\nthey work. I started originally looking at the brain, how our brain responds\nto being in a group or seeing members of other groups. And then we\u2019ve been\u2014our\nbrains, which are very evolutionarily ancient, have been dropped in this\nmodern technological environment with social media and artificial\nintelligence. And now, I\u2019m fascinated by studying how that all plays out: how\nis that manipulated, how do we get triggered in various ways, and so forth.\n\nThompson: So obviously, the brain is a pretty ancient piece of machinery.\nGroup psychology has to be a relatively ancient concept. We\u2019ve been living in\ngroups for hundreds of thousands of years before the internet came along. Is\nthere a general Psych 101 principle of, like, \u201cThis is your brain on groups\u201d?\nIf I went to Group Psychology 101, what would I learn on day one about how\ngroups change my own identity and my sense of what is true and false in the\nworld?\n\nVan Bavel: Great question. So maybe I\u2019ll give you a couple principles. The\nfirst is: All it takes is a flip of a coin for us to feel part of a group and\nstart to identify with it. And so we study this in the lab. It\u2019s called a\nminimal group, where we just literally flip coins and put people on the blue\nteam or the red team. But if anybody has ever grown up playing recreational\nsports, you go to the gym and you randomly get picked onto a side to play a\nsport for an hour or two, and that automatically triggers a different\npsychological mindset. And even people who were strangers a few minutes before\nare people we suddenly like more, pay more attention to, have an affinity for,\nand we\u2019re able and willing to cooperate with them in ways we wouldn\u2019t have if\nthey were strangers.\n\nAnd this happens to us also if you go to a professional sporting event. You\u2019re\ngiving a high five to someone sitting next to you who has a Yankees jersey if\nyou\u2019re a fan, even though you might [have never known] them before, might\nnever see them again in your life. And so that\u2019s the psychology that all of us\nwalk around in.\n\nThe other part of it that a lot of people don\u2019t get, but it\u2019s part of the\nexamples I give, is that it shifts from minute to minute. So again, I can\ncreate groups in my lab. You walk into a stadium with a jersey on and see\neverybody else wearing those colors. You have a different identity. You turn\non the TV, and it\u2019s election night, and you\u2019re cheering for your party to win.\nYour country goes to war. You\u2019re under attack. An even broader, more inclusive\nidentity gets triggered. Or let\u2019s say you turn on a movie and you\u2019re watching\nan alien invasion. In that case, it\u2019s just all of humanity against this alien\ninvasion. So we can get triggered to think of ourselves as different types of\nmembers of groups or as members of different types of groups depending on the\nsituation we\u2019re in.\n\nThompson: It\u2019s almost as if the desire to belong to any group is pre-\ndownloaded in us, and therefore thinking outside of groups seems to be the\nreally key challenge. If it is so easy for us to adopt a group psychology,\nthen being online, where it\u2019s all just one big mass of group psychology\noverlapping group psychology overlapping group psychology, the hardest thing\nto do is to try to \u201cthink for yourself\u201d when we so want to think as if we\nbelong to any of these groups.\n\nSo having spent several hours reading your papers from the last few years this\nmorning and yesterday and thinking about them as a collective, I came up with,\nwhat I am calling for the moment, \u201cthe four bad laws of internet and social\nmedia engagement.\u201d Because I feel like you and your lab have been\u2014in\nresearching how group psychology and dynamics and social media and the\ninternet affect us, you found your way to these four laws of what it is that\ndrives bad engagement on the internet. And I\u2019m just going to read them out\nnow, and then we\u2019re going to walk through them. I\u2019ll repeat them at the end,\nand then we can analyze them. But here are the four laws that I\u2019ve taken from\nyour research.\n\nNumber one is that negativity drives engagement. Number two, extremism drives\nengagement online. Number three, out-group animosity drives engagement online.\nAnd number four, moral, emotional language drives engagement online. And for\nlisteners at home, if you didn\u2019t understand what some of those terms meant, we\nwill absolutely define them in just a few minutes. But what I want to do with\nyou with our time together is to explain where these ideas come from\u2014because\nthey\u2019re all derived from your work in the last few years\u2014and what they mean.\n\nI want to start with a paper you published last year on negativity bias in the\nnews. In a randomized study of 105,000 headlines and 370 million impressions\nfrom a data set of articles published by the online news dispensary Upworthy,\nyou found that so-called \u201cnegative\u201d words increased the click-through rate by\nmore than 2 percent, and the prevalence of positive words in a news headline\ndecreased the likelihood of any headline being clicked on. In your own words,\nwhat did this paper show that was so important?\n\nVan Bavel: Yeah, I think one of the things that psychologists are very\nfamiliar with is the idea that bad is stronger than good, that people pay more\nattention to or are more motivated by bad things than we are good things. And\nI\u2019ll go back to a bit of an evolutionary explanation for this again: You can\nimagine your ancestors walking around the African savanna, and they\u2019re looking\nfor food to eat. And so there\u2019s a motivation to try to find food. But if they\npotentially see something and it could kill them, that\u2019s dramatically more\nsignificant to their survival. And so they have to err on the side of avoiding\nthings that are negative and risky. And our ancestors who did that over\ngeneration after generation after generation were more likely to survive. And\nso we have brains that are wired to detect threats and super-tuned to them\nmore than they are to detect rewards.\n\nAnd so that gets manipulated, classically, by the news. The famous quote from\njournalism is, \u201cIf it bleeds, it leads.\u201d But of course social media and\ninternet websites have hijacked that as well. And the data we had, I\u2019ll just\nsay briefly, came from the classic website that engineered virality online. It\nwas from Upworthy. So we got access to the Upworthy data archives. And what\nUpworthy was famous for in the early days of the internet was doing A/B\ntesting. So they would take a single news story, and they would try one\nheadline on their website and see how many people clicked and then randomly\nassign half of the other people who came to their website to see a different\nheadline. And so that way, they would test different headlines, look at their\ndata, and then pick the one that was most popular and keep it up. And they\nwere the pioneers in this.\n\nIn fact, they were so viral at one point, they had more traffic than The New\nYork Times. They were so viral that Facebook had to change its news algorithm\nbecause people were getting really frustrated by all the clickbait from\nUpworthy headlines and leaving Facebook to go get it. And so they really\nengineered this through data. So when we got that data set, we thought, \u201cWell,\nwe can see not what their theory is about what works; we can see with their\nexperimental A/B testing what actually gets people to click through an\narticle.\u201d And, of course, they\u2019re more likely to click to negative content,\nnegative headlines for the exact same story.\n\nThis excerpt was edited for clarity.
