However, as detailed by SolarPACES,\ncommercial molten salt has constraints, including a limited operational\ntemperature window and its corrosive nature. It is also used in fertilizers,\nmeaning it can be expensive and difficult to obtain.\n\nConversely, pebbles are neither expensive nor difficult to acquire, and the\nKTH researchers found that they could be used in place of the molten salt,\nstoring heat up to 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit (well above the 1,112 degrees\nFahrenheit limit for molten salt) while attaining thermal efficiency over 90%,\nper SolarPACES.\n\nIn simpler terms, this breakthrough means that storing clean, renewable energy\nharvested from solar cells could become easier, cheaper, and more efficient \u2014\nand that's good news for everybody.\n\nAs societies transition away from traditional dirty, polluting energy sources\nlike gas and oil and toward clean, renewable sources like solar and wind, one\nof the most pressing issues at hand is how to best store energy for future\nuse. Unlike gas, which can be stored easily and burned at any time, solar\nenergy cannot simply be poured into a canister.\n\nBut scientists are hard at work developing solutions. Other researchers have\ndesigned systems that store thermal energy using liquid tin, hydrogen, and\nsulfur.\n\nGood news, green hacks, and the latest cool clean tech \u2014 straight to your\ninbox every week!\n\n#### Watch now: The most sustainable thing about the new Rivian?
