(AP) \u2014 Florida school districts will soon have the option of\nallowing volunteer chaplains to counsel students under a bill signed Thursday\nby Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who dismissed critics opposed to mixing\nreligion with public education.\n\nThe only requirements for a chaplain to participate would be passing a\nbackground check and having their name and religious affiliation listed on the\nschool website. The chaplains would \u201cprovide support, services, and programs\nto students as assigned by the district school board.\u201d The law that takes\neffect July 1.\n\nDeSantis stressed that the program is voluntary. Schools don\u2019t have to have a\nchaplain and students don\u2019t have to work with them. Parental permission would\nbe required if they do.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s being forced to do anything, but to exclude religious groups from\ncampus, that is discrimination,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cYou\u2019re basically saying that\nGod has no place. That\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nFlorida is among more than a dozen states that have sought to create school\nchaplain programs. Texas became the first under a law passed in 2023.\n\nSupporters in Florida argued the legislation will provide another resource for\nchildren and pointed out that chaplains already serve in other government\nroles by working with police and serving in the military. The Legislature\nitself hosts a chaplain of the day when it\u2019s in session and there\u2019s a non-\ndenominational chapel in the state Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nFlorida\u2019s Bob Graham dead at 87: A leader who looked beyond politics, served\nordinary folks\n\nMan charged for transporting millions of dollars of stolen Masters memorabilia\nover a decade\n\nBob Graham, ex-US senator and Florida governor, dies at 87\n\nOpponents cite several problems with the new Florida law, including there\nbeing no training requirements for chaplains. They also fear that some\nstudents might be ostracized if they are atheist or belong to a non-Christian\nreligion in a Christian majority district.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a military chaplain, they go through intensive training and\nthey have to be in a position where they can provide information which is\nfactually correct and appropriate to the situation,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Lori\nBerman of Palm Beach County.\n\nWithout that training, a chaplain could provide psychologically damaging\ncounseling, Berman said. She suggested schools add more social workers,\nguidance counsellors or psychologists if they need them.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put the trained professionals in and not some unlicensed, untrained\npeople with a religious affiliation,\u201d Berman said.\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nMan charged with 4 University of Idaho deaths was out for a drive that night,\nhis attorneys say\n\nUndo\n\nViessmannAd Content\n\nAdvertisement So klappt die Heizungsf\u00f6rderung: Experten-Tipps f\u00fcr\nSie.Viessmann:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUndo\n\nAfter the remains of a missing boy are found inside a Buffalo home, the focus\nshifts to how he died\n\nUndo\n\nTrump loses bid to halt Jan. 6 lawsuits while he fights criminal charges in\nthe 2020 election case\n\nUndo\n\nLas Vegas lawyer and wife killed amid custody fight for children from prior\nmarriage, family says\n\nUndo\n\nOhio man fatally shot Uber driver after scam phone calls targeted both of\nthem, authorities sayAn Ohio man who authorities say fatally shot an Uber\ndriver he thought was trying to rob him after scam phone calls deceived them\nboth has been indicted on a murder charge.AP News\n\nUndo\n\nSenator's son pleads not guilty to charges from crash that killed North Dakota\nsheriff's deputyThe adult son of U.S. Sen.
