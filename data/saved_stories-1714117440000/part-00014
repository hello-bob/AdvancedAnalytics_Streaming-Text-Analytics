It\nwas what I would call a dusty Colorado Friday. The sky was overcast and the\ntrees depressingly barren. The air smelled of cow farts, which was typical\nwhen the winds changed, blowing in cold air from the beef farms in the nearby\ntown of Greeley. In my mind, this signaled snow.\n\nI walked into the Green Center, the building in housing the opening ceremony\nof BlasterHacks, the hackathon run by the Colorado School of Mines. I sign in\nat the entrance and walk down into the auditorium.\n\nAs I greeted my teammates, Grant Lemons, Lukas Werner and Byron Sharman, I\nnoticed the nervous smiles on their faces. You know the kind, the smile with\nthe inner eyebrows slightly raised, shoulders tense. We were excited, but we\nalso knew we had 36 solid hours of programming ahead of us.\n\nAfter collectively downing several whole pizzas and listening to the rules of\nthe competition, we made our way over to Labriola Innovation Complex, the\nhours-old manufacturing building the competition would take place in.\n\n## The Plan\n\nWe brainstormed some ideas under the overcast sky:\n\n  * A Bennett Foddy-inspired battle-royale game where all the controls were vim-keybindings.\n  * A health insurance app that estimates the cost of your care at all local hospitals.\n  * An app that encouraged you to stand up and move every thirty minutes.\n\nIt was that last one that we all got excited about. We imagined it to be\nsocial: at a random interval (which would average to thirty minutes), the app\nwould simultaneously send out a notification to every user. Should the user\nchoose to participate in the StandUp moment, the app would guide them all\nthrough the same short workout activity. Finally, the user had the choice to\nupload \"evidence\" of the workout, which could be a short caption about what\nthey were doing, or a photo.\n\nThe idea of StandUp (as we would go on to name our project) was inspired\nsimultaneously by BeReal, recent research in the detrimental health effects of\nremote work, and the use of social liability for comparatively more extreme\nworkouts (Strava).\n\nOf course, most of this had yet to be nailed down yet, for we were just\nentering the Labriola Innovation Complex. I remember asking myself if I would\nleave before the competition was over. Although I was tired from the days\nclasses and homework, I felt a drive to dedicate my whole self to this\nproject.\n\n## The Board\n\nWe sat down and created a new git repository. That's when I started thinking\nabout how we were going to organize our work. I proposed we setup a KanBan\nboard, a project management technique I had picked up at Archytas Automation.\n\nIf you've never heard of--or used a KanBan board, here's the gist. There are\nthree buckets:\n\n  1. To Do.\n  2. Doing.\n  3. Done.\n\nThe second bucket is divided up by person, so in our case, it was really four\nseparate buckets. When someone needed something new to work on, they would go\nto the \"To Do\" bucket and select a new task (which in our case, was a sticky\nnote). They would place the task into their corresponding \"Doing\" bucket. Once\nthe task was done, they would move the sticky note into the \"Done\" bucket and\nrepeat.\n\nAs a gag, we added an additional (superfluous) bucket: IDGAF. If a task was\nunanimously deemed no longer important or relevant to the project, that's\nwhere we would put it.\n\nSo, we got to work. We had decided to use Firebase, SvelteKit and Go. I\nstarted setting up Firebase, Grant started researching the notification\nservice, Lukas started working on a circular status page and Byron started\nresearching the Camera API.\n\nAs I look back at this moment today, I realize something important about all\nof these tasks that ended up benefiting us in the long term: they were all\nindependent. None of these original tasks relied on any other to get done. We\ncould work in parallel. Down the road, this would change, but the fact that we\nwere parallel at the beginning set us up for success.\n\n## The Snow and the Crash\n\nWe kept working through the night, downing energy drinks and laughing as we\nworked. We got the important services and UI element up and running. Around\nmidnight, as my nose had predicted several hours earlier, it started snowing.\n\nAs the snowflakes grew larger and ever more fluffy, I felt the teams energy\nbegin to dip. We were encountering roadblocks, one-by-one, as our motivation\nwaned and the threat of sleep became more prominent.\n\nThen, someone in the main atrium (who, I don't remember) pronounced, \"we are\ngoing outside.\" We ran down the halls like children spreading the\nannouncement, and soon enough, there were dozens of tired computer science\nstudents throwing snowballs in their jeans the t-shirts.\n\nAs I threw (and received) a number of snowballs, I realized something\nimportant: we were making an app about taking care of yourself physically, but\nhad neglected to do so ourselves. As important as the project may be, it won't\nget done when everyone is tired, muscles cramped, and unhappy. To keep the\nmomentum going, breaks are required.\n\nAs we filed back inside to warm our hands under tap water, I swore to make\nsure the rest of the team would take care of themselves--and each other.\n\n## The Conclusion\n\nThe rest of the hackathon was uneventful. We sat at our laptops, cranking out\nline after line of code. We took breaks and slept when we were blocked by\nother tasks.\n\nAlthough it was our first hackathon, we decided to run our project in the\nadvanced track, normally reserved for hackathon veterans. It paid off, because\nwe won second-place!\n\nLook at us: haggard but satisfied.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
