However, these methods had limitations\nbecause the added cells didn't always connect properly with the existing\nbrain.\n\nBaldwin and colleagues wanted to know if they could make synthetic neural\ncircuits from two different species work together in a living brain.\n\nUsing a technique called blastocyst complementation, they introduced rat stem\ncells into mouse embryos shortly after fertilization, which allowed the rat\nand mouse cells to grow and integrate together naturally. It's the first time\nthis specific process has successfully resulted in hybrid brains made using\ncells derived from two different species.\n\nSurprisingly, the mouse brain environment altered the timing of rat neuron\ndevelopment and supported synaptic connections between rat and mouse neurons,\neven though rats and mice have evolved separately for millions of years and\nhave differences in brain size.\n\n\"You could see rat cells throughout almost the entire mouse brain, which was\nfairly surprising to us,\" Baldwin explains. \"It tells us that there are few\nbarriers to insertion, suggesting that many kinds of mouse neurons can be\nreplaced by a similar rat neuron.\"\n\nA hybrid brain showing odor processing centers (circular structures).

(Ben Throesch/Columbia\nUniversity)\n\nWhen mouse neurons involved in smell were turned off or killed, rat neurons\ntook over and helped the brain process smells and find food.\n\n\"We hid a cookie in each mouse cage, and we were very surprised to see that\nthey could find it with the rat neurons,\" Baldwin says.\n\nCuriously, retaining dead and silent neurons still appeared to be having an\neffect on the animals' behavior. Mice with inactivated olfactory neurons had a\nharder time finding concealed cookies than mice whose olfactory neurons were\nengineered to vanish altogether during their development stage.\n\n\"If you want a functional replacement, you may need to empty out dysfunctional\nneurons that are just sitting there,\" Baldwin suggests, \"which could be the\ncase in some neurodegenerative diseases and also in some neurodevelopmental\ndisorders like autism and schizophrenia.\"\n\nAlthough the results are promising, we'll need more research to understand the\nimplications of interspecies neural integration and leverage its potential.\n\nOne issue with the new hybrid brain system is that the rat cells are randomly\ndispersed, making it difficult to apply the method to other brain systems.\n\nBaldwin's team is working on directing these cells to become a specific type,\nwhich could improve experimental precision. If successful, this method could\neven result in hybrid brains with primate neurons.\n\n\"This would help us get even closer to understanding human disease,\" Baldwin\nsays.\n\nThe research has been published in Cell.\n\nTrending News\n\nBrain Autopsies Reveal a Potential New Culprit Behind Alzheimer's Disease\nHealth2 days ago\n\nCommon Blood Pressure Drug Increases Lifespan And Slows Aging in Animals\nHealth6 days ago\n\nScientists Solved a 50-Year Mystery of What Punched The Giant Hole in\nAntarctic Ice Nature1 day ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
