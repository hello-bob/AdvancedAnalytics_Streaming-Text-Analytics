It's a unique offering\nthat includes support for depreciated hardware that RHEL has abandoned. This\nmakes AlmaLinux 9.4 a valuable tool for those with older hardware, ensuring\nthey can continue to operate efficiently.\n\nAlmaLinux is not built from RHEL's source code, and Red Hat has made that much\nharder in recent years. Instead, as the AlmaLinux OS Foundation board chair,\nBenny Vasquez, wrote, AlmaLinux \"decided to drop the aim to be 1:1 with RHEL.\nAlmaLinux OS will instead aim to be Application Binary Interface (ABI)\ncompatible.\"\n\nTo do this, AlmaLinux uses the CentOS Stream source code, which Red Hat\ncontinues to offer to all. The result is a Linux that works and plays well in\na RHEL software stack.\n\nThe swift release of AlmaLinux 9.4, hot on the heels of Red Hat\u2019s update, is a\ntestament to the strength and depth of knowledge within the AlmaLinux\ncommunity. This community, known for its dedication to both speed and\nstability, has played a crucial role in delivering the enterprise-grade Linux\nneeded by various industries.\n\nThe update to AlmaLinux 9.4 brings several enhancements that significantly\nimprove machine security, data protection, and system reliability. These new\nfeatures, designed to enhance system roles for automating operations and\npromoting consistency, are particularly beneficial in complex environments.\nNotably, the new system roles make creating and managing logical volume\nmanager (LVM) snapshots easier, enhancing data backup and recovery processes.\n\nVasquez views the release as a milestone in the platform's evolution. \"This is\nour second point release for AlmaLinux 9 since last year\u2019s shift from copying\nRed Hat bit-for-bit, and we are starting to take advantage of our freedom,\"\nVasquez proudly proclaimed.\n\nA crucial aspect of the 9.4 release is its support for hardware that had been\ndeprecated upstream in RHEL 9.4. By reintroducing support for older device\ndrivers and hardware, AlmaLinux aims to reduce both hardware and human costs\nby extending the life of still-functional, aging servers. This older hardware\nsupport is particularly significant in sectors like VFX, where older CPU\nrendering blades are essential. Tristan Theroux, IT infrastructure & security\ndirector for SHED animation studio, noted the update revitalizes older\nsystems, which are critical in video special express (VFX) studios, allowing\nthem to reserve more powerful servers for intensive tasks.\n\nThese older AlmaLinux 9.4 supported devices in include:\n\n  * aacraid - Dell PERC2, 2/Si, 3/Si, 3/Di, Adaptec Advanced Raid Products, HP\n\n  * NetRAID-4M, IBM ServeRAID & ICP SCSI\n\n  * be2iscsi - Emulex OneConnectOpen-iSCSI for BladeEngine 2 and 3 adapters\n\n  * hpsa - HP Smart Array Controller\n\n  * lpfc - Emulex LightPulse Fibre Channel SCSI\n\n  * megaraid_sas - Broadcom MegaRAID SAS\n\n  * mlx4_core - Mellanox Gen2 and ConnectX-2 adapters\n\n  * mpt3sas - LSI MPT Fusion SAS 3.0\n\n  * mptsas - Fusion MPT SAS Host\n\n  * qla2xxx - QLogic Fibre Channel HBA\n\n  * qla4xxx - QLogic iSCSI HBA\n\nWith this release, AlmaLinux continues to bridge the gap between past and\npresent technology, providing a platform for innovation and ensuring the\nsustainability of valuable IT resources across various industries.\n\nThat includes CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which just\njoined the foundation as a silver sponsor. CERN uses AlmaLinux as one of its\nLinux distributions for its world-class research in fundamental physics. Cern\nchose AlmaLinux after testing, which demonstrated it to be fully compatible\nwith upstream RHEL.\n\nNoteworthy Linux and open-source stories:\n\n  * Red Hat's latest enterprise Linux distro has new features to tackle hybrid cloud complexity\n\n  * It's baaack! Microsoft and IBM open source MS-DOS 4.0\n\n  * The hyper-clouds are open-source's friends\n\nOpen Source Watch\n\nWhat's what with open-source news.\n\nHome\n\nPosts\n\nAuthors\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vaughan-Nichols & Associates.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nPowered by beehiiv\n\n", "frontpage": false}
