(I think I can say that.)\n\n\"Lots of good folks got bad news and lots of great projects lost people.\nFlutter and Dart were not affected any more or less [than] others. It was a\ntough day... tough week.\"\n\nDoes this mean that Flutter will be taking a tentative step toward the \"Killed\nby Google\" graveyard? Jamboard could always use the company.\n\n  * Google rings in 2024 with sweeping layoffs\n  * Google Bard AI contractors unionize amid anger over 'retaliatory' layoffs\n  * Having slammed brakes on hiring, Google says it no longer needs quite so many recruiters\n  * Google's APAC outpost joins the global job cuts club\n\nFlutter is an open source Dart-based UI toolkit designed to allow developers\nto create apps across multiple platforms, both mobile (Android and iOS) and\ndesktop (Linux, macOS, and Windows.) It was making progress at the beginning\nof 2023 but now appears to have fallen victim to relentless cost-cutting at\nGoogle.\n\nAs for the Python team, the current positions have reportedly been \"reduced\"\nin favor of a new team based in Munich.\n\nThe Register contacted Google to verify the number of reductions, and to ask\nwhether the company was still committed to the Flutter platform. We have yet\nto receive a response.\n\nMoore attempted to remain optimistic, noting that it was a sad situation, and\n\"crazy to be seeing demos and new things working and discussions about new\ncustomers the same day we lost colleagues and friends.\"\n\nHe said: \"You're nervous. I get it. We get it. You're betting on Flutter and\nDart. So am I. So is Google.\"\n\nTo which one wag responded: \"We certainly are betting on Flutter... to be\nkilled within a few years.\"\n\nThe cost cutting at Google began in January last year when 12,000 people or\nsix percent of the workforce were made redundant. This was by far the most\nsignificant number of job losses in Google's history, and an acknowledgment\nthat the numbers of people recruited during the pandemic was no longer\nsustainable given the downturn in business.\n\nThat slowdown in business has now passed - clearly - but Google is looking to\nfree up resources to spend more on priorities, including AI.\n\nSo far this year, Google has waved goodbye to staff in the core engineering\ngroup, Devices and Services, the Google Assistant biz, YouTube and more\nrecently in finance and real estate. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * Google\n  * Layoff\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * Google\n  * Layoff\n  * Python\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * API\n  * App stores\n  * Chrome\n  * Chromium\n  * Gemini\n  * Git\n  * Google AI\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * Google I/O\n  * Google Nest\n  * G Suite\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Pixel\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Software bug\n  * Tavis Ormandy\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Alphabet\n  * Employment\n  * Programming Language\n  * Search Engine\n\n#### More about\n\n1 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * Google\n  * Layoff\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Developer\n  * Google\n  * Layoff\n  * Python\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * API\n  * App stores\n  * Chrome\n  * Chromium\n  * Gemini\n  * Git\n  * Google AI\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * Google I/O\n  * Google Nest\n  * G Suite\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Pixel\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Software bug\n  * Tavis Ormandy\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Alphabet\n  * Employment\n  * Programming Language\n  * Search Engine\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Google fires 28 staff after sit-in protest against Israeli cloud deal\nends in arrests\n\nAlphabet Workers Union says bosses refuse to listen to concerns\n\nOff-Prem11 days | 94\n\n#### Encrypted email service files DMA complaint claiming it vanished from\nGoogle Search\n\nTuta cries foul, Chocolate Factory denies service unreachable\n\nApplications3 days | 59\n\n#### Watchdog reveals lingering Google Privacy Sandbox worries\n\nAd tech rewrite to replace web cookies still not to regulatory taste\n\nSecurity6 hrs | 8\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Protest group says Google has fired more staff over sit-ins opposing work\nfor Israel\n\nGroup of now-ex Googlers say 50 folks have been let go, vow ongoing protests\n\nOff-Prem7 days | 79\n\n#### Tokyo wags finger at Google for blocking Yahoo Japan! from using ad tech\n\nSeven years of stonewalling and no consequences for advertising giant\n\nOff-Prem7 days | 3\n\n#### YouTube now sabotages ad-blocking apps that stream its vids\n\nEFF lambastes latest 'lazy and deliberately malicious move'\n\nApplications13 days | 67\n\n#### Google squashes AI teams together in push for fresh models\n\nYou can leave your personal vendettas at home \u2013 we have work to do, Pichai\nwarns\n\nAI + ML10 days | 14\n\n#### UK data watchdog questions how private Google's Privacy Sandbox is\n\nLeaked draft report says stated goals still come up short\n\nSecurity7 days | 3\n\n#### Google location tracking deal could be derailed by politics\n\n$62 million settlement plan challenged over payments to progressive nonprofits\n\nSecurity13 days | 18\n\n#### Google laying off staff again and moving some roles to 'hubs,' freeing up\ncash for AI investments\n\nRestructure of finance teams will see some leave, and other roles created in\nMexico City, Bangalore, and US cities\n\nOff-Prem11 days | 9\n\n#### Google cools on cookie phase-out while regulators chew on plans\n\nPrivacy Sandbox slips into 2025 after challenges from UK authorities\n\nSecurity5 days | 10\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
