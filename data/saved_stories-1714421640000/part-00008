But it was the invention of electricity that\nforever changed the way we talked to each other. In 1844, the first message\nwas sent via telegraph. Samuel Morse, who created the binary Morse Code\ndecades before electronic computers were even possible, tapped out, \u201cWhat hath\nGod wrought?\u201d It was a prophetic first post.\n\nWorld War II accelerated the invention of digital computers, but they were\nprimarily single-use machines, designed to calculate artillery firing tables\nor solve scientific problems. As computers got more powerful, the idea of\ntime-sharing became attractive. Computers were expensive, and they spent most\nof their time idle, waiting for a user to enter keystrokes at a terminal.\nTime-sharing allowed many people to interact with a single computer at the\nsame time.\n\n## Part 0: The Precambrian era of digital communication (1969\u20131979)\n\nSoon after time-sharing was invented, people started sending messages to other\nusers. But since every computer spoke its own unique machine language and had\nits own way of storing and retrieving data, none of these machines could talk\nto each other. The solution to this problem came out of the Pentagon\u2019s\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), and was thus dubbed the \u201cARPANET.\u201d\nWhen two different computers connected to each other through an \u201cIMP\u201d\n(Interface Message Processor, the first router) in 1969, it was a massive\nbreakthrough.\n\n[\n\nEnlarge / The front panel of the first Internet router.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, instead of sending a message to a friend who was probably sitting next to\nyou in the same computer lab, you could send it to someone in a different\ncity. In 1971, Ray Tomlinson wrote the first inter-computer messaging program,\nSNDMSG. Because he had to differentiate between the receiver\u2019s username and\nthe name of the computer they were using, he needed a character that wouldn\u2019t\nbe part of either. He hit \u201cSHIFT-P\u201d on the Model 33 Teletype, got an @, and\nthe rest was history. Email was born.\n\nEnlarge / The two keystrokes that changed history.\n\nMarcin Wichary (Wikipedia)\n\n## The friendly orange glow\n\nAt around the same time, a self-contained computer network called PLATO was\nalso changing the world. PLATO was an educational system that began in 1960\nand was nearing its fourth iteration. It was responsible for many computer\nfirsts, such as the first flat-screen plasma display, which launched in 1972\nwith PLATO IV. These touch-enabled, 512\u00d7512 graphical displays looked like\nthey came from the future. And while it couldn\u2019t talk to ARPANET, every PLATO\nuser at every terminal could communicate with each other all over the world.\n\nEnlarge / PLATO IV Terminal, ca. 1972\u20131974.\n\nUniversity of Illinois archives\n\nIn 1971, PLATO was the home of the first \u201cphishing\u201d scam, when student Mark\nRusted created a fake login screen that stole users\u2019 passwords. (He was\npolitely asked not to do it again.) Because of this, the next revision of\nPLATO added a special keystroke combination, SHIFT-STOP, that would guarantee\nthat the user saw a real login screen. Years later, Microsoft would use the\nsame idea for Windows NT with CTRL-ALT-DEL.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n47\n\nJeremy Reimer I'm a writer and web developer.
