This post looks at the\nnew features added to the web platform.\n\nBrowser compatibility data pulled from MDN is included in these posts and may\nnot have been updated yet for very recent browser releases. The post will show\nthe correct information as soon as it appears in the browser-compat-data\nrelease.\n\n### Four new features land in Baseline\n\nFirefox 125 added four new features to Baseline Newly Available. The Popover\nAPI, Intl.Segmenter, align-content for block layouts, and the content-box and\nstroke-box values for transform-box.\n\n#### The Popover API\n\nThe Popover API lets you create many kinds of non-modal popups. These include\ntooltips, menus, custom toast popups, and many more. Popovers include lots of\nbuilt-in functionality that you previously had to write JavaScript for. Find\nout more in Popover API lands in Baseline.\n\nBrowser Support\n\n  * 114\n  * 114\n  * 125\n  * 17\n\nSource\n\n#### intl.Segmenter\n\nIntl.Segmenter enables local-sensitive text segmentation. For example, letting\nyou split words in languages that don't separate words with spaces. See how it\nworks in The Intl.Segmenter object is now part of Baseline.\n\nBrowser Support\n\n  * 87\n  * 87\n  * 125\n  * 14.1\n\nSource\n\n#### align-content for block layouts\n\nThe align-content property is now supported in all major engines for block\nlayout. This means that you can do block direction alignment without needing\nto also create a flex or grid layout on the parent. See an example in The\nalign-content property for block layouts is now part of Baseline .\n\nBrowser Support\n\n  * 123\n  * 123\n  * 125\n  * 17.4\n\n#### CSS transform-box\n\nFinally, in Firefox 125 are the values of content-box and stroke-box for the\ntransform-box property. The content-box value uses the content box and stroke-\nbox the stroke bounding box containing an SVG's shape.\n\nBrowser Support\n\n  * 118\n  * 118\n  * 125\n  * 13.1\n\n### The WebSocketStream API\n\nThe WebSocketStream API integrates WHATWG Streams with the WebSocket API, and\nis available in Chrome 124.

It's a great time to test new features, or\nremovals, that could impact your site before the world gets that release. New\nbetas are Firefox 126, Safari 17.5, and Chrome 125. These releases bring many\ngreat features to the platform. Check out the release notes for all of the\ndetails.
