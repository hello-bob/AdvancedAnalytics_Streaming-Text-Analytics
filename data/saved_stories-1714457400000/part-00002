While patent attorneys actually do this\nall the time, in order to advise clients on various matters, we tend to charge\nsignificant sums for the service, because it takes great expertise and many\nhours to do it right.\n\nThe part of a patent that actually defines the extent of the monopoly is the\nsection at the end containing a series of numbered statements, called\n\u2018claims\u2019. If you do something which is actually within the entirety of the\nlanguage of at least one claim, then you infringe the patent. However, if you\ndo something which is described in the patent specification, but which is not\nthe entire subject matter of a claim, then you do not infringe. Ideally, this\nwould all be very clear-cut. In practice, with the best will (and the best\npatent drafting) in the world, language is an imprecise and sometimes\nambiguous tool!\n\nMost patents describe many things that are not new. However, granted patents\n(hopefully) describe and claim some combination of things which is new and\ninventive.\n\nSo in this article we will \u2013 at no charge, with no obligation, and with the\nstrong disclaimer that this is not legal advice and cannot be relied upon for\nany purpose \u2013 take a look at what the CSIRO WLAN patent is actually all about.\n\n#### The Patent\n\nThe CSIRO patent is no. 5,487,069. However, this original published version no\nlonger represents the current state of the patent. Following re-examination\ninitiated in 2008 by Intel (control number 90/010,367), the patent was amended\nto delete some claims, amend some others, and add about 80 new ones! We have\nobtained a copy of the re-examination certificate, and made it available via\nGoogle docs (PDF, 1.25 MB). The certificate shows the claim amendments, along\nwith all of the prior art raised in the re-examination \u2013 an eight-page\nlisting!\n\nThe more recent re-examinations, initiated in 2010, are complete, although a\nfurther re-examination certificate is yet to issue. Only minor additional\namendments have resulted from these proceedings.\n\nThe patent, as it currently stands at the conclusion of all re-examination\nproceedings, contains about 140 claims. Most of these are directed to minor\nvariations and specific features of the particular implementation which is\ndescribed in detail within the specification.\n\nBut to understand the maximum extent of CSIRO\u2019s patent rights, it is\nsufficient to look only at one of the broadest claims of the patent. We have\nchosen claim 68, which is a method claim defining a procedure for transmitting\ndata in a wireless LAN which is implemented within devices employing the\ninvention:\n\n> 68\\. A method for transmitting data in a confined multipath transmission\n> environment of radio frequencies, said data being provided by an input data\n> channel coupled to transmission signal processing means in turn coupled to\n> antenna means, said method comprising the steps of:\n>\n>   1. applying data reliability enhancement to said data;\n>   2. interleaving, by means for interleaving, blocks of said enhanced data;\n>   3. modulating said data, by modulation means of said transmission signal\n> processing means, into a plurality of sub-channels comprised of a sequence\n> of data symbols such that the period of a sub-channel symbol is longer than\n> a predetermined period representative of significant ones of non-direct\n> transmission paths; and\n>   4. transmitting, by said antenna means, said sub-channel symbols.\n>\n\nThe underlined portion highlights the only amendment which has been made to\nthis claim in the course of the various re-examinations to which the patent\nhas been subjected. Theoretically, this amendment could have an impact on the\nscope of the claim, although for our purposes here we can assume that it\nactually makes little difference in practical terms.\n\n#### Preamble\n\nThe opening portion of the claim is known as the \u2018preamble\u2019. It does not\nusually define anything new and inventive, but rather sets the context for the\ncombination of features which actually constitute the claimed invention.\n\nHere, the preamble tells us that the claim is going to define a \u2018method\u2019 (i.e.\na sequence of steps), which are useful for transmitting information via radio\nwaves in a confined space. It further informs us that, in practice, the\ninformation will arrive in the form of some \u2018input data\u2019, which will be\nprocessed by a signal processor (electronic hardware and/or software, as the\nterm is normally understood) and then transmitted via an antenna.\n\nNone of this is new in itself. What is said to be new is the particular signal\nprocessing steps employed.\n\n#### \u2018...confined multipath transmission environment...\u2019\n\nFigure 1 of the patent illustrates what is meant by a \u2018confined multipath\ntransmission environment\u2019.\n\nThe drawing shows a room (1) in which the box (2) represents an item of\nfurniture. The circles (3) and (4) represent a transmitter and receiver. The\nsolid arrow is the direct path from transmitter to receiver, while the dotted\nlines represent possible indirect paths resulting from reflections of the\nradio waves from walls, furniture, and other objects.\n\nThe environment is generally dynamic, because radio waves will be reflected,\ndiffused and/or absorbed by temporary and moving objects, such as people and\ntheir belongings.\n\nIt is easy to imagine how these reflections result in various copies of the\ntransmitted signals (\u2018echoes\u2019) arriving at the receiver at different times.\nInformation arriving via the direct path will become confused with delayed\ncopies of earlier-transmitted information. However, this is a vastly\noversimplified, and incomplete, picture of the damage done by multipath\ninterference.\n\nRegardless of the information content, delayed copies of transmitted radio\nwaves interfere with one another to cause what is known as frequency-selective\nfading. Particular delays correspond with interference at particular\nfrequencies, which may significantly attenuate the receive signals at those\nfrequencies. Waves have \u2018peaks\u2019 and \u2018troughs\u2019, and in a worst-case scenario, a\ndelayed \u2018trough\u2019 arrives at the receiver at the same time as a direct \u2018peak\u2019,\nand the two cancel each other out completely.\n\nFigure 3 of the patent shows a \u2018channel frequency response\u2019 which illustrates\njust how severe this problem can be.\n\nIdeally, the jagged line above would be dead flat \u2013 all frequencies arriving\nat the receiver with the same peak power. However it is far from flat. The dB\nscale on the vertical axis is logarithmic: the difference between the\nstrongest and weakest signals is not \u2018about 30\u2019, it is a factor of over 1000!\nThe dotted line shows how things have changed at a slightly later time.\n\nThe patented CSIRO WLAN solves the multipath problem by combining three\ntechniques, in an inter-related fashion. It is easiest to explain these in a\ndifferent order from that in which they are applied, because it is then\npossible to see how each part of the solution in turn creates a need for the\nnext part.\n\n#### Multi-channel modulation\n\n#### An aside: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)\n\nMany of the criticisms of the CSIRO patent have contended that it just claims\n\u2018OFDM\u2019, which was well-known at the time. OFDM, for those not in the know, is\na clever way of generating multiple channels which are very closely spaced (in\nfact, they overlap), while still being possible to separate them at the\nreceiver.\n\nBecause OFDM makes very efficient use of radio spectrum, it is clearly the\nbest choice for a multi-channel modulation scheme. It is, in fact, the method\ndescribed in detail within the patent specification.\n\nBut OFDM, as critics have pointed out, was a known technique. CSIRO\u2019s\ninvention was not the use of OFDM per se, but rather the choice of channel\nnumber and symbol length to overcome the multipath problem in the typical WLAN\nenvironment.\n\nCSIRO's broadest claims are not limited to OFDM, and cover any multi-channel\ntransmission technique. Limiting to OFDM would make it too easy for somebody\nto bypass the patent by using a slightly less-efficient multi-channel\nmodulation scheme. The key to the invention is how many channels, and what\nsymbol length, are used.\n\nThe third step in the claimed method is:\n\n  1. modulating said data, by modulation means of said transmission signal processing means, into a plurality of sub-channels comprised of a sequence of data symbols such that the period of a sub-channel symbol is longer than a predetermined period representative of significant ones of non-direct transmission paths.\n\nIf you use one channel to transmit data at, say, 50 Mb/s, then each bit\nrequires a transmission period of 1/50,000,000 seconds (20 nanoseconds). In\nthat time, light (or radio waves) travels around six metres, i.e. far less\nthan the dimensions of the spaces in which WiFi is commonly used. So the\n\u2018delayed copy\u2019 problem is extremely severe.\n\nYou can be a little clever, and transmit \u2018symbols\u2019 representing multiple bits,\nso that the symbol periods are longer than an individual bit period, but such\nsymbols are more susceptible to noise, and in practice you cannot reduce the\nproblem by more than a factor of about 4.\n\nFar better is to transmit many channels in parallel, each using a slightly\ndifferent frequency. Say you use 12 channels, and you modulate each channel\nwith symbols encoding two bits, your symbol rate on each channel is now only\n2.08 Msymbols/s. Light travels 144 metres in the corresponding time period,\nand in most spaces echoes which have travelled this far are not a problem.\n\nSo this is what the above element of the claim tells you to do: divide the\nsignal up into multiple \u2018sub-channels\u2019 with parameters chosen such that the\nperiod of each transmitted symbol on each sub-channel is greater than the time\ndelay corresponding with any significant echoes. This way, adjacent symbols no\nlonger interfere with each other.\n\n#### Error Correction\n\nMulti-channel modulation solves the \u2018echo\u2019 problem, but then some of the\nindividual sub-channels will suffer horribly from the frequency-selective\nfading shown in the graph above, while others will be unaffected. Some data\nloss and errors are inevitable.\n\nThe solution to this is to include some redundancy in the transmitted signal.\nThis means adding bits to the transmitted data which can be used to detect and\ncorrect certain kinds of errors.\n\nThe relevant step in the claim is:\n\n  1. applying data reliability enhancement to said data.\n\nThis does not specify exactly how this should be done. There are many choices\nwhich might work, and limiting the claim to one in particular would make it\nfar too easy to bypass the patent. The specific method described in most\ndetail in the specification is known as \u2018Rate 1/2 Trellis Coded Modulation\n(TCM)\u2019. \u2018Rate 1/2\u2019 means that for every information bit sent, one additional\nbit of redundant coding information is sent.\n\nInterestingly, TCM was invented by IBM scientist Gottfried Ungerboeck, who\ndescribed it in a conference paper in 1976. While it did not achieve a great\ndeal of recognition at the time, it became prominent in the 1980s, and\nultimately enabled the jump in dial-up speeds from 9.6 kbit/s to over 30\nkbit/s. Even simple Trellis Coding schemes have the power to reduce the\noccurrence of uncorrectable errors by a factor of more than 1000!\n\n#### Interleaving\n\nThe fading behaviour of the channel in a confined environment creates a\nfurther problem for most error correction schemes: the frequency channels with\nthe worst performance tend to group together (you can see this in the above\ngraph). If you simply modulate and transmit the sub-channels with bits in the\norder they come out of the encoder, any errors are likely to affect adjacent\ngroups of symbols. A bunch of errors in a group of consecutive bits or symbols\nis commonly known as a \u2018burst\u2019.\n\nBursts of errors are quite common in all telecommunications channels. Errors\nare most likely to occur if there happens to be a \u2018spike\u2019 in the random\nbackground noise, and such spikes typically affect multiple bits. So most\nerror coding schemes are designed to be reasonably burst-tolerant. Indeed, a\ncommonly quoted characteristic of any error coding scheme is the maximum\nlength burst error it is able to correct.\n\nSo things would probably be fine if we were only concerned about spikes in\nbackground noise over time. But in the scheme we are building here, errors are\ngoing to occur amongst groups of symbols because of fading in adjacent\nfrequency channels.\n\nThe CSIRO solution to this problem is interleaving, i.e. the step of:\n\n  1. interleaving, by means for interleaving, blocks of said enhanced data\n\nThe basic idea is to \u2018shuffle\u2019 the symbols amongst the sub-channels (like a\ndeck of cards), so that consecutive symbols are no longer located on adjacent\nsub-channels. As always, there are \u2018better\u2019 and \u2018worse\u2019 ways to perform this\nstep. The patent specification describes the process this way:\n\n> Link data interleaving schemes [distribute] the encoded data between the\n> carriers in such a way that the correlation in error probability of those\n> carriers associated with any given element of uncoded input data is\n> minimised. On average, this corresponds to maximising the minimum frequency\n> spacing between those carriers.\n>\n> For example, with a 5-bit constraint length, half rate trellis coded QPSK\n> modulation on the carriers of a 12 carrier ensemble, a suitable interleaving\n> scheme is\n>\n> Carrier number (1-12) modulated by successive encoder output di-bits: 1, 3,\n> 5, 7, 9, 11, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 1, 3, . . . etc.\n\n#### Putting it all together\n\nThe invention \u2013 the actual innovation on which CSIRO holds a patent monopoly \u2013\nis what is claimed. No more, no less. It is the particular combination of\nprocessing steps described above, followed by actually transmitting the\nresulting signal via an antenna.\n\nThere are other claims covering transmitters, receivers, transceivers and\nwireless LANs. But all of these claims incorporate versions of this same\ncombination of features.\n\nCSIRO does not own \u2018WiFi\u2019, nor does it own, or claim to own, multi-frequency\nmodulation, OFDM, the Fast Fourier Transform, forward error correction,\nTrellis Coded Modulation, or interleaving.\n\nAs explained above, the CSIRO WLAN patent claims define particular\ncombinations of these techniques which solve the specific problem of making a\nwireless LAN work in a confined space with potentially extreme multipath\npropagation problems. This problem had not been solved before CSIRO\u2019s\nscientists did it, and the reason it forms the basis for the 802.11a/g WiFi\nstandards is because no better solution was put forward to the committee.\n\nWas CSIRO\u2019s claimed combination \u2018obvious\u2019 on 27 November 1992 (the priority\ndate of the WLAN patent)? Well, unless you were the person skilled in the\nrelevant art on that date, your opinion on this question is completely\nirrelevant to the patent law. Many things are obvious with the benefit of\nhindsight.\n\nHowever, the original examiner at the USPTO did not think it obvious. And in\nre-examination the claim discussed above was upheld, despite having a\nselection of prior art references thrown at it, which was so extensive\nrequired eight pages of the re-examination certificate to list them all!\n\nSo the legal answer to the questions, as matters stand, is no \u2013 CSIRO\u2019s WLAN\npatent claims are not obvious.\n\nShare the knowledge!\n\n  * Post\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Share\n\nTags: Australia, Claim construction, Infringement, Patent law, Patent\nlitigation, US\n\n### You might also be interested in...\n\n  * Australian Patent Law Contains, Includes, and Comprises Dangers for Foreign Applicants\n  * Actions Trump Intentions in Determining Infringement of \u2018Swiss\u2019 Claims in Australia\n  * How the Australian High Court Found that Refurbished Ink Cartridges do not Infringe Seiko Patents\n  * Pfizer Appeal Success Opens Door for Patent Litigation Over ENBREL Biosimilar\n  * Justice Stephen Burley Pulls Excess Teeth from Australia\u2019s Innovation Patent\n\nNewer Post Older Post Home\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010-2024The Patentology Blog by Dr Mark A Summerfield is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Australia\nLicense.  \n---  \n  \n## Subscribe\n\nJoin 1,241 subscribers who currently receive Patentology updates by email!\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Innovation Patent Expiry\n\nThe Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Productivity Commission Response\nPart 2 and Other Measures) Act 2020 received Royal Assent on 26 February 2020,\nsetting in train a phase-out of the innovation patent system.

Some would argue (and that 'some' might\ninclude me) that the insertion of the word 'obliged' here suggests that Burley\nJ is not entirely convinced that the Full Court got it right.\n\nIn reaching his conclusion, Burley J has been forced to address head-on the\nquestion of how to treat the conflicting reasons of the two groups of judges\nin the High Court decision, and what impact these reasons have on the reasons\nof the majority and minority in the Full Court. Where there is no majority in\nthe High Court, it is a statutory requirement that the decision appealed from\n'shall be affirmed'. Here, however, all of the High Court judges criticised\nthe majority decision in the Full Court, and half of them would have reversed\nit.\n\nBurley J's conclusion? The statute is clear. The decision of the Full Court is\nto be affirmed, Thus it would not be correct 'to draw upon the reasoning of\nthe High Court to influence [his] decision making in the relation to the\nresidual claims' and he is 'bound to follow the reasons set out in the\nmajority decision in considering the patentability of the residual claims.'\nThat pretty much seals Aristocrat's fate here.\n\nMy guess is that this decision will result in the case going all the way back\nto the High Court. There are now two issues that might form the basis for\nspecial leave (when it gets there). First, there is the original question of\nwhether Aristocrat's claims are patentable, in light of the fact that the\npresent outcome is based on reasons of the majority in the Full Court that\nwere criticised by six judges of the High Court. Second there is the question\nof whether Burley J's interpretation of the relevant statute is correct, and\nthat in such circumstances the Full Court's decision, and reasons, should be\n'affirmed' just as if the High Court had said nothing at all.\n\nFun times ahead! #patents #australia #software #invention\n\nJustice Burley has today (8 March) handed down his decision on the remaining\nclaims at issue in the dispute between Aristocrat and the Commissioner of\nPatents over patents directed to electronic gaming\n\n...Read More\n\n29\n\n8\n\nMark Summerfield\n\n29th Mar 2024\n\nI have published my analysis of Australian and New Zealand patent attorney\nfirms' filing results for 2023, which usually generates a bit of interest\nwithin the profession!\n\nWhile there are exceptions, firms that suffered last year were generally\nlarger and/or those held within the listed ownership groups, along with firms\nhaving a higher exposure to New Zealand patent filings (which declined by a\ngreater margin in 2023 than Australian filings).

His\noriginal online Coursera course gave me a big boost at the start of my own ML\njourney.\n\nThe criticism that has been levelled at Google in the past week has been, in\nlarge part, grossly unfair and itself infected by bias, unconscious and\notherwise. It is no coincidence that much of this criticism has come from\n(mostly American) white males, influenced by an 'anti-woke' culture wars\nagenda.\n\nBut Google is a global company that operates across national and cultural\nboundaries. Its customers are literally everybody, regardless of colour,\ncreed, politics, gender or sexuality. And it's been bitten before - remember\nwhen its ML-based photo captioning system labelled an African-American couple\nas 'gorillas'? It really has no choice but to try to counter the inherent\nbiases in its training data - and that's not Google's fault; it is just a fact\nthat there is a preponderance of text and image content in existence that\nrepresents the output and perspectives of white, cis, heterosexual, male,\ndeveloped-world human beings. And, unlike OpenAI and some others, it cannot\nplay the 'nimble, disruptive, move-fast-and-break-things, start-up card' when\nthings (inevitably) go wrong.\n\nSure, it seems stupid that Gemini's imperative to generate diverse\nrepresentations of people caused it to produce historically and factually\ninaccurate images, and to refuse to follow express instructions to depict\nboring old white men. But the outraged ridicule from people - who presumably\nalso refuse to see Hamilton or watch Bridgerton - mean that we now cannot use\nGemini even for the purposes Google presumably had in mind, e.g. to generate\ngeneric illustrations for web pages and blog posts. See, this is why we can't\nhave nice things!\n\nAs for the person who asked Gemini to weigh up the pros and cons of\nmisgendering Caitlyn Jenner versus preventing a nuclear apocalypse, that\nridiculous scenario proves nothing at all, except for what we already knew.\nNamely, that large language models are nothing more than 'plausible sentence\ngenerators' (I've borrowed that phrase from Cory Doctorow, although I don't\nknow if he coined it originally) that have no real understanding of the world\nand its relationships. I dare say that if you gave a child a list of things\nthat are 'bad', but that are otherwise beyond the child's knowledge and\nexperience, they would also find it impossible to make reasonable judgment\ncalls as to which ones are 'better' or 'worse'.\n\nFor my part, I am glad to see that Google is at least trying to combat bias\nand serve a diverse global customer base. And I am OK with them making a few\nmistakes along the way. Better that than leave the world to the tech bros (I'm\nnot going to name names here) who literally argue that AI companies should not\nhire 'ideological employees' - as if that, in itself, is not an ideology, as\nwell as a flagrant violation of anti-discrimination laws!\n\nGreat to see an absolute legend of AI, Andrew Ng, speaking up for Google.
