What if that\u2019s why\nmass culture is so boring?\n\nBy W. David Marx\n\nIllustration by Matteo Giuseppe Pani\n\nMay 1, 2024, 9:24 AM ET\n\nListen to this article\n\n00:00\n\n12:11\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration.\n\nIn the spring of 1988, I made a lifelong friend thanks to a video-game cheat\ncode. As preparation for a family move to Pensacola, Florida, I visited my new\nschool. While there, I casually told a future classmate named Tim that the\nnumbers 007 373 5963 would take him straight to the final fight of the very\npopular Nintendo boxing game Mike Tyson\u2019s Punch Out. My buddies and I in\nOxford, Mississippi, all knew this code by heart, but it turned out to be rare\nand valuable information in Pensacola. Years later, Tim revealed to me that it\nwas my knowledge of the Punch Out cheat code that made him want to be friends.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have understood this at age 9, but I had just engaged in a\nsuccessful act of cultural arbitrage. If financial arbitrage involves the\nacquisition of commodities in a market where they are inexpensive and selling\nthem for profit in a market where they are expensive, cultural arbitrage is\nthe acquisition of information, goods, or styles in one location where they\nare common and dispersing them in places where they are rare. The \u201cprofit\u201d is\npaid out not in money but in esteem and social clout. Individuals gain respect\nwhen others find their information useful or entertaining\u2014and repeated\ndeployments may help them build entire personas based on being smart, worldly,\nand connected.\n\nIn the past, tastemakers in the worlds of fashion, art, and music established\ncareers through this sort of arbitrage\u2014plucking interesting developments from\nsubcultures to dangle as novelties in the mass market. The legendary writer\nGlenn O\u2019Brien, for example, made his name by introducing the edgiest downtown\nNew York bands to suits at record labels uptown and, later, by incorporating\nelements from punk rock, contemporary art, and underground S&M clubs in the\ncreation of Madonna\u2019s scandalous 1992 book, Sex.\n\nBut the internet\u2019s sprawling databases, real-time social-media networks, and\nglobe-spanning e-commerce platforms have made almost everything immediately\nsearchable, knowable, or purchasable\u2014curbing the social value of sharing new\nthings. Cultural arbitrage now happens so frequently and rapidly as to be\nnearly undetectable, usually with no extraordinary profits going to those\nresponsible for relaying the information. Moreover, the sheer speed of modern\ncommunication reduces how long any one piece of knowledge is valuable. This,\nin turn, devalues the acquisition and hoarding of knowledge as a whole, and\nfewer individuals can easily construct entire identities built on doing so.\n\nThere are obvious, concrete advantages to a world with information equality,\nsuch as expanding global access to health and educational materials\u2014with a\nstable internet connection, anyone can learn basic computer programming from\nonline tutorials and lectures on YouTube. Finding the optimal place to eat at\nany moment is certainly easier than it used to be. And, in the case of Google,\nto \u201corganize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and\nuseful\u201d even serves as the company\u2019s mission. The most commonly cited\ndisadvantage to this extraordinary societal change, and for good reason, is\nthat disinformation and misinformation can use the same easy pathways to\nspread unchecked. But after three decades of living with the internet, it\u2019s\nclear that there are other, more subtle losses that come with instant access\nto knowledge, and we\u2019ve yet to wrestle\u2014interpersonally and culturally\u2014with the\nimplications.\n\nTo draw from my own example, there was much respect to be gained in the 1980s\nfrom telling friends about video-game cheat codes, because this rare knowledge\ncould be obtained only through deep gameplay, friendships with experienced\ngamers, or access to niche gaming publications. As economists say, this\ninformation was costly. Today, the entire body of Punch Out codes\u2014and their\ncontemporary equivalents\u2014can be unearthed within seconds. Knowledge of a cheat\ncode no longer represents entr\u00e9e to an exclusive world\u2014it\u2019s simply the fruit\nof a basic web search.\n\nAdmittedly, an increased difficulty in impressing friends with neat tips and\ntrivia hardly constitutes a social crisis. And perhaps benefitting from\nclosely kept secrets was too easy in the past, anyway: In my Punch-Out\nexample, I gained a disproportionately large amount of esteem for something\nthat required very little effort or skill. But when these exchanges were\nrarer\u2014and therefore more meaningful\u2014they could lead to positive effects on the\noverall culture. In a time of scarcity, information had more value, which\nprovided a natural motivation for curious individuals to learn more about what\nwas happening at the margins of society.\n\nRead: Why kids online are chasing \u201cclout\u201d\n\nArbitrageurs would then \u201ccash in\u201d by introducing these artifacts to mainstream\naudiences, which triggered broader imitation of things once considered niche.\nThis helped accelerate the diffusion of information from the underground into\nthe mainstream, not only providing sophisticated consumers with an exciting\nstream of unfamiliar ideas but also breathing new life into mass culture. The\nend result of this collision was cultural hybridization\u2014the creation of new\nstyles and forms.\n\nThis process helps explain the most significant stylistic shifts in 20th-\ncentury pop music. Living in the port city of Liverpool, where sailors\nimported American rock-and-roll records, the Beatles leveraged this early\naccess to the latest stateside recordings to give themselves a head start over\nother British bands. A decade later, the music producer Chris Blackwell, who\nco-founded Island Records using his upbringing in Jamaica and knowledge of its\nmusic, signed Bob Marley and turned reggae into a globally recognized genre.\nOver the past 15 years, Drake has picked up this mantle as music\u2019s great\narbitrageur, using his singular celebrity to produce collaborations with then-\nemerging talent such as Migos and the Weeknd that cemented his own reputation\nas a tastemaker.\n\nCreative ideas appear to be impressive innovations to average consumers only\nonce they get a foothold in wider society, which requires a difficult jump\nfrom so-called early adopters (who are curious to find new products and art\nforms) to the more conservative mainstream (who tend to like what they already\nknow). And in the cultural marketplace, arbitrage succeeds more than pure\ninvention because it introduces works that feel novel yet have proven track\nrecords of impressing others somewhere else. Before importing reggae to the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom, Blackwell knew that this music delighted\nJamaicans\u2014and that its popularity within a community that was fighting\noppression would appeal to countercultural sympathizers as well.\n\nThat global platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, and Wikipedia reduce the glory\nof acquiring deep information has not stopped the hunt. Instead, it\u2019s pushed\neveryone to solve a much more narrow set of information inequalities in their\nown, smaller communities. Big-league influencers may have trouble looking for\nthe big score, but \u201cday traders\u201d in niche fan groups can achieve minor status\nboosts by being the first to deliver news about their favorite idols to fellow\nfans. Arguably, individual fandoms have never been stronger\u2014yet because\ninformation moves so quickly, these communities exert less influence on larger\naudiences that have less time or inclination to keep up with every micro-\ndevelopment. And though such superfans may claim to reject public opinion,\nthey secretly need their insights to be respected outside the group in order\nto feel like something other than just dedicated hobbyists.\n\nAt the same time, the hyper-politicization of culture on the internet has\nconstrained arbitrage from a different angle: The previously common practice\nof being influenced by minority communities now elicits charges of\nappropriation. Such moral judgments are not new: The Nigerian musician Fela\nKuti initially accused Paul McCartney of intending to steal \u201cBlack man\u2019s\nmusic\u201d after the former Beatle went to Lagos to record the Wings album Band on\nthe Run. A greater awareness of the issue in recent years, however, means that\nthird parties now actively police the exact moments when inspiration becomes\ntheft. When the white influencer Charli D\u2019Amelio boosted her own fame by\npopularizing the \u201cRenegade\u201d dance on TiKTok, the journalist Taylor Lorenz\ntraced its origin back to its Black creator, Jalaiah Harmon. In this case, the\nheightened sensitivity toward appropriation had arguably positive effects:\nHarmon\u2019s dance became world-renowned, and she eventually received proper\ncredit for it. But these new standards make arbitrage a much weightier\nundertaking than it used to be, potentially requiring groundwork in\ncoordinating permission and approval from originators.\n\nRead: How Ariana Grande fell off the cultural-appropriation tightrope\n\nIn the past decade, some observers have wondered whether cultural innovation\nis slowing down. They\u2019ve pointed to the stultifying effects of legacy IP at\nthe box office, the way fast fashion has flattened any genuine sense of\nclothing trends, the indefatigability of Taylor Swift\u2019s ongoing pop-chart\ndominance. The devaluing of cultural arbitrage\u2014and the decrease in instances\nof hybridization\u2014is certainly an additional factor to be considered. This is\nnot just a problem for hipsters, however; it ends up affecting everyone who\nenjoys participating in popular art with other people. The wider entertainment\nindustry always needs new ideas, and with reduced instances of cultural\narbitrage, few that come to mainstream consumers now feel particularly\nvaluable.\n\nSome countervailing trends might organically reenergize cultural arbitrage\nover time. The move from billion-user platforms back to balkanized networks on\nclubbier apps such as Discord could allow savvy individuals to step in and\nbridge distinct worlds. We also may seek to reduce the amount of information\nshared online\u2014keeping information exchange personal and limited to real life\nmay restore some value to what tastemakers know. Restaurant reservations have\nbecome valuable for this very reason: There are limited seats in a real place.\nThe Canadian indie-music project Cindy Lee recently released a double album,\navailable for download only on GeoCities and as a YouTube stream rather than\non streaming sites such as Spotify. The self-created scarcity gave the album\npalpable buzz, and the lack of easy access didn\u2019t get in the way of critical\nreviews or online discussion.\n\nThe internet arrived at a time when we gained social clout from arbitraging\ninformation, so our first instinct was to share information online. Perhaps we\nare now entering an era of information hoarding. This may mean that, for a\nwhile, the most interesting developments will happen somewhere off the grid.\nBut over time, this practice will restore some value to art and cultural\nexploration, and bring back opportunities for tastemaking. Whatever the case,\nwe first must recognize the role that arbitrage played in preventing our\nculture from growing stale while literally making us friends along the way.\nWinning respect by sharing video-game cheat codes may be a thing of the past,\nbut we need to promote new methods for innovators and mediators to move the\nculture\u2014otherwise it may not move much at all.\n\nW.
