Or follow us on\nGoogle News!\n\nThere was one part of Tesla\u2019s shareholder conference call yesterday that\ncaught my attention more than any other. That was partly because of the\npotential being discussed, and partly because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard\nElon Musk and team discuss the topic.\n\nFirst of all, you\u2019ve got this question to kick things off: \u201cGiven the pursuit\nof Tesla really as the leader in AI for the physical world, and your comments\naround distributed inference, can you talk about what the approach is\nunlocking beyond what\u2019s happening in the vehicle right now?\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause until Elon Musk asked Ashok Elluswamy if he wanted to\nsay something. He postulated that with robotaxi capability, Tesla cars would\nbe on the road about 50 hours a week, and Musk chimed in that he had\nessentially the same guess \u2014 about a third of the hours in the week. Elluswamy\nthen proceeded to say that there are other uses the computers and intelligence\nin Tesla cars could be tapped for.\n\n\u201cYou can do a lot of other workloads. Even right now we are seeing [can\u2019t\nunderstand what he said] companies have these like batch workloads where they\nset up a bunch of documents and those are run through pretty large neural\nnetworks \u2014 take a lot of compute to channel through those workloads,\u201d\nElluswamy said. \u201cNow that we have already paid for this compute in these cars,\nit might be wise to use them and not let them be idle \u2014 be like buying a lot\nof expensive machinery and letting them be idle. [...] We want to use the\ncompute as much as possible.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I was thinking about AWS (Amazon Web Services). I read\nsomething years ago that most people think Amazon become a hugely profitable\ncompany with an enormous market cap because of its online store, but it was\nactually AWS where Amazon hit the jackpot. AWS is what brought in the huge\nprofits and made Amazon the juggernaut it is today. Incidentally, that\u2019s\nexactly the thing Elon Musk referenced in the next line.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s analogous to Amazon Web Services, where, you know, people didn\u2019t\nexpect that AWS would be the most valuable part of Amazon when it started out\nas a bookstore. That was on nobody\u2019s radar. But they found that they had\nexcess compute because the compute needs would spike to extreme levels for\nbrief periods of the year, and then they had idle compute for the rest of the\nyear, so then what should they do with all that excess compute for the rest of\nthe year?\u201d The answer was to monetize it and charge others to use that\ncompute. Now, much of the internet is using the AWS backbone.\n\nSo, back to Tesla. \u201cIt seems like kind of a no-brainer to say \u2018okay, if we\u2019ve\ngot millions and then tens of millions of vehicles out there where the\ncomputers are idle most of the time that we may as well have them do something\nuseful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty fascinating topic. They add that if they get to where they\nexpect to get with the on-road Tesla fleet, it could have the largest unusable\ncompute sitting there able to be used for other purposes.\n\nFrankly, as wild as it seems, the first thing that came to mind was the AWS\ncomparison, and it\u2019s quite easy to see Tesla developing some creative ways of\nusing that \u201cdistributed access to power and distributed cooling\u201d that is\nfinancially beneficial to both owners and Tesla. A few of the Tesla execs\nstarted to nerd out about the possibilities at that point of the conference\ncall, signaling how excited they are about this. When you think about the AWS\nexample, you have to think this could actually be a financial jackpot for\nTesla years down the road. Watch this space.\n\nHave a tip for CleanTechnica?
