Gmail started out as a 20%; everyone\u2019s\nheard that.\n\nIt\u2019s part of the mythology around Google, and it would be nice if it were\ntrue. Once I was at a table with 8 or 9 engineers, and I asked \u201cwho here has a\n20% project?\u201d One hand went up. Most people never had one, because their\nregular jobs take up 100% of their time.\n\nThe other inhibiting factor, by the way, is that most humans don\u2019t have any\npassions or hobbies, and that\u2019s almost as true for Google employees as for the\ngeneral population. However, there were (and are) a lot of non-work activities\ngoing on, and those were the best part of being there for me. I\u2019ve written\nother posts about the Cinema Club that I started, and the authors whose talks\nI hosted (also this).\n\nGoogle had already had musical events, like Carlos Santana\n\nand the most famous ukelele player in the world, Jake Shimabukuro:\n\nPoliticians, like John McCain:\n\nand much more. But the one thing no one had done was live theater! It was my\nambition for years to finally do that. But how? There were conference rooms,\nlike the one where we showed our movies on Thursday nights, but those are set\nup for meetings and talks. They don\u2019t have dressing rooms, you can\u2019t easily\nset up scenery, and most of all, people are using them all day, every day, so\nany changes you make will probably end up getting destroyed by someone. In the\nCinema Club we found that the video and sound systems got messed up nearly\nevery week.\n\nOur room, Asilomar, for the movies (in the 1900 building, if you know the\nMountain View campus), would have worked, but it had a lectern at the front\nwith mic, power, and other things that a meeting needs. The lectern had cables\nrunning out the bottom into a big hole in the floor, and the only way to\ndisconnect would be to cut them. That was not going to happen, needless to\nsay.\n\nFinally I had an inspiration: why don\u2019t we just turn it on its side, and make\nit part of the set?\n\nNow to find a real theater company and interest them in expanding their\naudience. The Pear Avenue Theater was just down the street from us, so I\ncalled them up and two of them, Diane Tasca and Robin Braverman, came over to\ncheck out the venue.\n\nLife Since the Baby Boom is a reader-supported publication.

It held about\n100 people; more than enough.\n\nAsilomar also had an emergency exit, normally locked from the outside. Could\nwe use that for actors\u2019 entrances and exits? Maybe, but usually the door sets\noff an alarm if it\u2019s propped open. I had to talk to Security to disable that.\n\nThe indoor exit actually had an anteroom, which was great! You enter the door\nfrom the hallway, and you\u2019re in a little room that\u2019s still separated from the\ntheater. Actors could enter and exit stage left OR stage right!\n\nThere were bathrooms just opposite the inside door, which the actors could use\nfor dressing rooms.\n\nLighting was fairly decent for a business conference room, although nowhere\nclose to what a real theater offers.\n\n###\n\nThe Show\n\nWhat about the show? Most theatrical productions take up two to three hours.\nThat would be a problem in the middle of a workday, and they couldn\u2019t really\ndo it in the evening because that\u2019s when they do their regular shows.\n\nHowever, every year The Pear puts on a collection of very short plays, called\nPear Slices. This year one of them was actually written by a former Googler\n\n!\n\n###\n\nAnd We\u2019re Live\n\nSo here it is. You can see me on the right briefly, before I let Diane do the\nintroduction:\n\nSome other screenshots from the show\n\n:\n\n### Subscribe to Life Since the Baby Boom\n\nBy Albert Cory \u00b7 Launched 2 years ago\n\nAmusing stuff from a Boomer Fl\u00e2neur in high tech\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Live Theater Comes to Google\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nNo Source Code == No Patent\n\nHow we know you \"have' the invention\n\nApr 17, 2023 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### No Source Code == No Patent\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n10\n\nBring Back Private Offices\n\nOpen Office Sucks\n\nMar 4 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n19\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Bring Back Private Offices\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n14\n\nWorking at Google: Maps\n\n\"Oh, I Love Google Maps!\"\n\nFeb 13, 2023 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n5\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Working at Google: Maps\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n3\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Albert Cory\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
