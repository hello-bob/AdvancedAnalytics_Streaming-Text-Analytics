Within a matter of days, the clock was hours ahead of the smartphones\nin people\u2019s pockets. People figured something was awry.\n\nBut the clock wasn\u2019t defective. It was just unconventionally regulated: I\ncalibrated the flow of time to coincide with the flow of glacial rivers.\nImpacted by climate change, the rivers were flowing faster than in the past.\nOr from the perspective of the rivers, everything else was happening more\nslowly.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAs I wrote in a previous Nautilus article, \u201cPhilosophy Is a Public Service,\u201d\nmy training is in philosophy, which I practice in public. My ambition is to\nengage as broad a population as possible in the realm of ideas, encouraging\npeople to explore the world in which we live, and to chart possible futures\nfor our cities, our environment, and our planet. I believe that collective\nreflection and anticipation are necessary for our survival\u2014especially in this\nperiod of ecological upheaval\u2014and that philosophy needs to be a public service\nas much as cartography and timekeeping.\n\nOF TIME AND THE RIVER: The Anchorage Museum is an urban landmark and a local\ngathering spot. That makes it the perfect setting for a concert or picnic\u2014or a\nmunicipal clock. Back in 2020, I worked with a software developer to introduce\nAlaska River Time to Anchorage residents with a projection on the museum\nfa\u00e7ade. We chose five rivers, each impacted by climate change in myriad ways.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey website provided us with realtime flow data, which\nthe software compared to the average flow to determine the clock rate. Each\nriver was given its own clock face, and they were averaged in a digital\ndisplay of Alaska River Time. Photo courtesy of the Anchorage Museum.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nI created Alaska River Time while I was a visiting artist at the Anchorage\nMuseum. I developed this art installation out of the conviction that all the\nclocks I\u2019d ever encountered were malfunctioning. I\u2019m not claiming they\u2019re\nimprecise. The oscillations of atomic clocks at the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology are so consistent that they will neither gain nor\nlose a second over billions of years. Even Big Ben, constructed in the 1850s,\nhas such a steady beat that minor adjustments are required only once a week.\n\nWhat is troubling to me is their accuracy, or in other words the degree to\nwhich the steadiness of clocks corresponds to time as actually experienced by\npeople and other living beings. Time seldom keeps a steady beat in nature.\nCircadian rhythms fluctuate, as do rates of growth and decay.\n\nHAPPY RIVER DAY: I want people to integrate river time into their daily lives.\nI don\u2019t want it merely to be an abstract concept (as happens all too often\nwhen the public encounters climate science). To encourage Alaskans to apply\nriver time meaningfully, I worked with the Anchorage Museum on a series of 10\nposters with 10 different propositions. For instance, I suggested that river\ntime be adopted as a legal time standard, and that it be the basis for the\nschool year and the payment of interest on municipal bonds\u2014even football\ngames. By proposing that people celebrate their birthdays on river time, I\nsought to make the experience of river time personal, to encourage periodic\nvisits to the local waterway as an alternative to blowing out candles on a\nbirthday cake.

When we look at a river from the perspective of the clock on\nour smartphones, we perceive natural deviations as imperfections. We expect\nthe Amazon to behave like Amazon.com. We expect nature to run on time to meet\nthe demands of an economy that considers unpredictable conditions to be a\nlogistical problem.\n\nOur temporal intolerance is intolerable from the standpoint of planetary well-\nbeing. Climate change shows that nature cannot be pushed around indefinitely.\nLogistics must be accountable to more than market demands. Similarly, for a\nclock to be accurate, I believe that it must be sensitive to environmental\nvariations. From the perspective of NIST, it must be imprecise.\n\nHorology, the practice of time measurement, is a conservative trade, motivated\nby the age-old desire to bring order to the world. Clocks promise that life\nwill have the certainty of astronomy or physics by gearing living systems to\noperate like machines.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIronically, even bringing that certainty to a tabletop mechanism proved\nterribly difficult, confounding inventors for thousands of years. Driven by\nspilling water, clocks slowed down as they lost ballast. Driven by falling\nweights, clocks sped up as the mass accelerated. Discovered by Galileo, who\nobserved the periodic motion of a swinging chandelier in church one day, the\npendulum provided the first scientific solution.\n\nIn theory, the rate at which a pendulum swings is determined by its length\nfrom pivot to bob. In ideal conditions, the pendulum would oscillate at that\nrate indefinitely. From the moment that Christiaan Huygens operationalized\nGalileo\u2019s observation in the first functional pendulum escapement until\nelectronics supplanted mechanics, engineers worked to approach that ideal by\nmaking the periodic motion of timekeeping mechanisms more robust and reliable.\n\nThe greatest attention was devoted to isolating the pendulum from all external\nconditions. New alloys were formulated to expand and contract as little as\npossible with changes in temperature, so that the pendulum length always\nremained the same. The clock case was designed to isolate the pendulum from\nchanges in humidity and air currents. With extraordinary ingenuity,\nclockmakers extracted the clock from the world, dematerializing the hours.\nAntique timepieces are some of the most luxurious objects ever created, yet\nparadoxically all the guilloch\u00e9 and gilding was directed toward transforming\ntime into an abstraction.\n\nARBOREAL TIME: In the fall of 2023, I visited the bristlecone pine trees atop\nMt. Washington with Long Now Foundation colleagues. We climbed to an elevation\nof 11,600 feet, the trees\u2019 natural habitat. (They thrive in harsh conditions,\nwhich is why I was dressed in a parka.) Up on the mountain, on Long Now\nproperty, we selected four trees of different sizes, which we designated as\ncalibration points for arboreal time. In order to find the calibration points\nin the future, I attached a ceramic tile to the rockface nearest each tree.\nThe tiles are numbered and attached to the stone with mortar I had to prepare\non the spot. At that elevation, mortar dries slowly, but it can last for\ncenturies. Photo by James Home / Courtesy of the Long Now Foundation.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

I find one of the most vivid descriptions in Pliny\u2019s Natural\nHistory, the foremost encyclopedia of the Roman Empire. \u201c\u2018I have given you\nplants that mark the hours, and in order that you may not even have to avert\nyour eyes from the Earth to look at the sun,\u2019\u201d Pliny wrote, assuming the voice\nof nature:\n\n\u201cWhy then do you still look higher and scan the heavens themselves? Lo! you\nhave Pleiads at your very feet.\u201d Glow-worms do not make their appearance on\nfixed days or last a definite period, but certain it is that they are the\noffspring of this particular constellation. Consequently anybody who does his\nsummer sowing before they appear \u201cwill have himself to thank for labour\nwasted.\u201d\n\nIn Pliny\u2019s account, time is relational. Natural phenomena are correlated in\npredictable ways, either because they are causally linked or because they\u2019re\ntriggered by similar environmental conditions. Timekeeping is a way of\nanticipating phenomena that are important based on those that are prevalent.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIn modern scientific terms, glow-worms are phenological indicators, meaning\nthat they signal seasonal changes in the environment as a whole. I should\nemphasize that they\u2019re hardly unique in that respect. From North America to\nAsia, indigenous peoples still rely on ecological calendars that name the\nmonths based on the natural events underlying traditional lifeways.\n\nFor the Haida people of British Columbia, the time of year corresponding to\nJanuary/February is known as hlgidguun kongaas, or \u201cCanada goose moon,\u201d\nreferencing the geese flying down the coast. February/March is taan kongaas,\nor \u201cblack bear moon,\u201d marking the time when bears emerge from hibernation. The\ncalendar indicates that bears will emerge after the geese arrive, while\nallowing this progression of events to drift forward or backward relative to\nthe lunar cycle based on natural variability in climate conditions from one\nyear to the next.\n\nSTRING CALENDAR: The age of a tree can be determined by drilling a core and\ncounting the rings. The same technique can be used to determine the relative\ngrowth rate from year to year. This will be the basis for calibrating the\nclock we\u2019re installing at the Nevada Museum of Art. Although it isn\u2019t as\nprecise, the growth rate can also be monitored by wrapping a string around the\ntrunk. I created a string calendar for each of the bristlecones we\u2019ll use as\ncalibration points for the clock\u2014indicating future dates on wooden tabs that\nare spaced according to the trees\u2019 current growth rate\u2014in order to encourage\nhands-on encounters with the trees. Handling the string proved unexpectedly\ndifficult in the cold. I was pleased that it took time.

Log in or Join now .\n\nAnother important feature of ecological calendars can be witnessed in wiid\ngyaas, the Haida month that typically aligns with April. Coinciding with the\nend of winter, wiid gyaas references the Swainson\u2019s thrush, which is known as\nthe salmonberry bird in the Haida language. The song of this bird is not only\nthe sound of springtime, but also calls upon people to forage for\nsalmonberries, which might go unnoticed were it not for this creature\u2019s\npersistent beckoning.\n\nThe tight coupling of the Haida calendar with the ecology of British Columbia\nis a testament to the more than 14,000 years they\u2019ve lived there, during which\ntime they\u2019ve synchronized their lifeways with the lives of every other being.\nBut the past reliability has become a source of vulnerability as anthropogenic\nclimate change plunges April into February. What I\u2019m saying is that the\necological calendar has inadvertently become an environmental indicator of\nglobal warming.\n\nEcologists and climate scientists are now collaborating with indigenous\ncommunities to revitalize ancient calendars by identifying current\nphenological correlations. For example, in the Pamir Mountains of Central\nAsia, farmers and herders have traditionally kept time by associating\nphenological indicators with parts of their body, counting from their toes to\ntheir head as winter leads into spring. Their bodies still provide convenient\nmnemonics, but they must now convene each year to reassess what counts and\nwhat it means. With this feedback, the calendar is self-correcting, but age-\nold rhythms have been supplanted by anxious contingency.\n\nThe time indicated by my fluvial clock is equivalently contingent, but the\nclock is intended to operate in a different context and with a different\npurpose. Instead of resetting the time periodically and using the discrepancy\nto recalibrate events such as the beginning of fishing season, I let the clock\nrun free.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAs I write these words, Alaska River Time is 3:14 AM on Nov. 30, 2024, nearly\n10 months ahead of the Gregorian calendar. The fluvial calendar is ahead\nbecause Alaskan glaciers are melting more rapidly than in the past, and the\nspeed of melting accelerates with every passing year.\n\nThe clock rate is a ratio between present conditions and the average flow over\nthe last half century. When Alaska River Time is accessed online, you\nexperience temporality from the rivers\u2019 perspective. When you live on river\ntime, your clock is no longer insulated from the environment. Your schedule is\nset in relation to fluvial conditions.\n\nRivers are not the only meaningful indicators of environmental conditions.\nJust as the time told by every river is inherently accurate even though the\nclock rate of two rivers may differ, all other life forms and living systems\nmanifest time, and I believe that each has claim to equal authority.\n\nAt present I\u2019m developing a clock that will be regulated by the growth of\ntrees. The monumental electromechanical clock will be built at the Nevada\nMuseum of Art in Reno.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThere will be two faces and two pendulums. One will take orders from NIST in\nBoulder, Colorado. The other will be controlled by the growth of bristlecone\npines on Mt. Washington in Nevada\u2019s Great Basin.\n\nA collaboration with the Long Now Foundation, which owns the property where\nthe trees grow, the timepiece will not only juxtapose time standards but will\nalso mesh phenology and horology. All trees grow erratically, at least from a\nprecisionist point of view. This can be seen in their growth rings, which vary\nin thickness from year to year, impacted by factors ranging from rainfall to\nthe quantity of carbon dioxide in the air. Dendrochronologists use this\nvariation to detect climate conditions in the past, treating trees as passive\nrecords. My clock puts the trees in an active position, directing their own\nobservations of the environment forward in time. How thick is this year\u2019s ring\ncompared to those in the past? The ratio sets the clock rate.\n\nINNER CLOCK OF TREES: Mt. Washington is extremely remote. Few people will have\nthe opportunity to visit. So I\u2019m working with a master clockmaker to build a\nmunicipal clock that people will encounter at the Nevada Museum of Art in\nReno. The design shown in this computer rendering is meant to familiarize\npeople with arboreal time and to make it legible to anyone. The second face,\nindicating standard time, is intended to pose a challenge: Which clock do you\ntrust? I hope that people take both measures seriously, and that the clock\nopens them to observing time in all phenomena, celestial and terrestrial. In\nsimulations we\u2019ve run, the two pendulums are mesmerizing to watch as they\nperiodically fall into and out of sync. They make the internal life of the\ntrees palpable. If you focus, you might even experience bristlecone time in\nyour heart. Rendering by Philip Abernethy / Courtesy of the Nevada Museum of\nArt\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe traditional design of my clock is intended to be timeless. Given that\nbristlecones can live for as long as 5,000 years, and new fashions tend to\npeak in hours, the timelessness might be seen as an attempt to futureproof the\ndevice. However, my motivation is more philosophical than aesthetic, or rather\nthe aesthetic properties are essential to its operation as a philosophical\ninstrument.\n\nBy taking up the vernacular of a pendulum clock, and even integrating\ndecorative arts such as guillauch\u00e9, this new municipal timepiece meets\nChristiaan Huygens and Big Ben on their own terms. It questions the clockwork\nlogic that has driven society since precision became a precondition for\naccuracy.\n\nIn Technics and Civilization, the historian Lewis Mumford observed that the\n\u201cessential nature\u201d of the clock \u201cdissociated time from human events and helped\ncreate the belief in an independent world of mathematically measurable\nsequences.\u201d On this basis, he set the clock above the steam engine as \u201cthe key\nmachine of the modern industrial age.\u201d\n\nMumford wrote these words in 1934, decades before climate change was detected\nand steam power was identified as a culprit. The key question of our own time\nis whether we can counter the environmental devastation wrought by the\nindustrial age and fossil fuels.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nI think that Mumford was right. But I also believe that clocks might just be\nthe machinery needed to set a post-industrial age in motion, if only they can\nbe made compatible with life on Earth. Like Alaska River Time, clocks can\nredeem horology by subverting it.\n\nLead art: Philip Abernethy / Courtesy of the Nevada Museum of Art\n\n  * ###### Jonathon Keats\n\nPosted on April 11, 2024\n\nJonathon Keats is an experimental philosopher, artist, and writer.
