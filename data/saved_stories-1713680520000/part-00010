They insist\nthat they're presenting research for generating virtual interactive characters\nand not for impersonating anyone. As such, there's no product or API planned.\n\n\"Our research focuses on generating visual affective skills for virtual AI\navatars, aiming for positive applications,\" the Redmond boffins state. \"It is\nnot intended to create content that is used to mislead or deceive.\n\n\"However, like other related content generation techniques, it could still\npotentially be misused for impersonating humans. We are opposed to any\nbehavior to create misleading or harmful contents of real persons, and are\ninterested in applying our technique for advancing forgery detection.\"\n\nKevin Surace, Chair of Token, a biometric authentication biz, and frequent\nspeaker on generative AI, told The Register in an email that while there have\nbeen prior technology demonstrations of faces animated from a still frame and\ncloned voice file, Microsoft's demonstration reflects the state of the art.\n\n\"The implications for personalizing emails and other business mass\ncommunication is fabulous,\" he opined. \"Even animating older pictures as well.\nTo some extent this is just fun and to another it has solid business\napplications we will all use in the coming months and years.\"\n\nThe \"fun\" of deepfakes was 96 percent nonconsensual porn, when assessed [PDF]\nin 2019 by cybersecurity firm Deeptrace.\n\nNonetheless, Microsoft's researchers suggest that being able to create\nrealistic looking people and put words in their mouths has positive uses.\n\n\"Such technology holds the promise of enriching digital communication,\nincreasing accessibility for those with communicative impairments,\ntransforming education, methods with interactive AI tutoring, and providing\ntherapeutic support and social interaction in healthcare,\" they propose in a\nresearch paper that does not contain the words \"porn\" or \"misinformation.\"\n\n  * Devaluing content created by AI is lazy and ignores history\n  * US Air Force says AI-controlled F-16 fighter jet has been dogfighting with humans\n  * Stability AI decimates staff just weeks after CEO's exit\n  * Microsoft claims it didn't mean to inject Copilot into Windows Server 2022 this week\n\nWhile it's arguable AI generated video is not quite the same as a deepfake,\nthe latter defined by digital manipulation as opposed to a generative method,\nthe distinction becomes immaterial when a convincing fake can be conjured\nwithout cut-and-paste grafting.\n\nAsked what he makes of the fact that Microsoft is not releasing this\ntechnology to the public for fear of misuse, Surace expressed doubt about the\nviability of restrictions.\n\n\"Microsoft and others have held back for now until they work out the privacy\nand usage issues,\" he said. \"How will anyone regulate who uses this for the\nright reasons?\"\n\nSurace added that there are already open source models that are similarly\nsophisticated, pointing to EMO. \"One can pull the source code from GitHub and\nbuild a service around it that arguably would rival Microsoft's output,\" he\nobserved. \"Because of the open source nature of the space, regulating it will\nbe impossible in any case.\"\n\nThat said, countries around the world are trying to regulate AI-fabricated\npeople. Canada, China, and the UK, among other nations, all have regulations\nthat can be applied to deepfakes, some of which fulfill broader political\ngoals. Britain just this week made it illegal to create a sexually explicit\ndeepfake image without consent. The sharing of such images was already\ndisallowed under the UK's Online Safety Act of 2023.\n\nIn January, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers introduced the Disrupt Explicit\nForged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act of 2024 (DEFIANCE Act), a bill that\ncreates a way for victims of non-consensual deepfake images to file a civil\nclaim in court.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, April 16, the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\nSubcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law held a hearing titled\n\"Oversight of AI: Election Deepfakes.\"\n\nIn prepared remarks, Rijul Gupta, CEO of DeepMedia, a deepfake detection biz,\nsaid:\n\n[T]he most alarming aspect of deepfakes is their ability to provide bad actors\nwith plausible deniability, allowing them to dismiss genuine content as fake.\nThis erosion of public trust strikes at the very core of our social fabric and\nthe foundations of our democracy. The human brain, wired to believe what it\nsees and hears, is particularly vulnerable to the deception of deepfakes. As\nthese technologies become increasingly sophisticated, they threaten to\nundermine the shared sense of reality that underpins our society, creating a\nclimate of uncertainty and skepticism where citizens are left questioning the\nveracity of every piece of information they encounter.\n\nBut think of the marketing applications. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Deepfake\n  * Government\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Deepfake\n  * Government\n  * Microsoft\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Active Directory\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Azure\n  * Bing\n  * BSoD\n  * Confluence\n  * Database\n  * Excel\n  * Exchange Server\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * HoloLens\n  * IDE\n  * Insider Trading\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Jenkins\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Machine Learning\n  * Map\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Build\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Microsoft Ignite\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Surface\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * .NET\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Office 365\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Outlook\n  * Patch Tuesday\n  * Pluton\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Search Engine\n  * SharePoint\n  * Skype\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * SQL Server\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Text Editor\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n  * WordPress\n  * Xbox\n  * Xbox 360\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Bill Gates\n  * Sector\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n12 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Deepfake\n  * Government\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Deepfake\n  * Government\n  * Microsoft\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Active Directory\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Azure\n  * Bing\n  * BSoD\n  * Confluence\n  * Database\n  * Excel\n  * Exchange Server\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * HoloLens\n  * IDE\n  * Insider Trading\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Jenkins\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Machine Learning\n  * Map\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Build\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Microsoft Ignite\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Surface\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * .NET\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Office 365\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Outlook\n  * Patch Tuesday\n  * Pluton\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Search Engine\n  * SharePoint\n  * Skype\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * SQL Server\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Text Editor\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n  * WordPress\n  * Xbox\n  * Xbox 360\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Bill Gates\n  * Sector\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### What's up with AI lately?
