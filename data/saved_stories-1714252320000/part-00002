Bach of\nLiquid AI, Karan Malhotra of Nous Research, Rob Haisfield of WebSim.ai\n\nThree perspectives on the most viral fringe of generative AI this year:\nSimulative AI!\n\nApr 27, 2024\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### WebSim, WorldSim, and The Summer of Simulative AI \u2014 with Joscha Bach of\nLiquid AI, Karan Malhotra of Nous Research, Rob Haisfield of WebSim.ai\n\nwww.latent.space\n\nShare\n\nTranscript\n\n0:10\n\nWelcome to the Latent Space Podcast.\n\n0:12\n\nThis is Charlie, your AI co-host.\n\n0:16\n\nMost of the time,\n\n0:17\n\nSWIX and Alessio cover generative AI that is meant to use at work,\n\n0:21\n\nand this often results in RAG applications,\n\n0:24\n\nvertical co-pilots,\n\n0:25\n\nand other AI agents and models.\n\n0:28\n\nIn today's episode,\n\n0:29\n\nwe're looking at a more creative side of generative AI that has gotten a lot\nof\n\n0:33\n\ncommunity interest this April.\n\n0:35\n\nWorld simulation, web simulation, and human simulation.\n\n0:40\n\nBecause the topic is so different than our usual,\n\n0:43\n\nwe're also going to try a new format for doing it justice.\n\n0:47\n\nThis podcast comes in three parts.\n\n0:50\n\nFirst,\n\n0:51\n\nwe'll have a segment of the WorldSim demo from Noose Research CEO Karen\nMalhotra,\n\n0:56\n\nrecorded by Swix at the Replicate HQ in San Francisco that went completely\nviral\n\n1:02\n\nand spawned everything else you're about to hear.\n\n1:05\n\nSecond,\n\n1:06\n\nwe'll share the world's first talk from Rob Heisfield on WebSim,\n\n1:09\n\nwhich started at the Mistral Cerebral Valley Hackathon,\n\n1:12\n\nbut now has gone viral in its own right with people like Dylan Field,\n\n1:16\n\nJanice aka Replicate,\n\n1:18\n\nand Siki Chen becoming obsessed with it.\n\n1:21\n\nFinally,\n\n1:22\n\nwe have a short interview with Joshua Bach of Liquid AI on why simulative AI\nis\n\n1:28\n\nhaving a special moment right now.\n\n1:30\n\nThis podcast is launched together with our second annual AI UX demo day in SF\nthis weekend.\n\n1:38\n\nIf you're new to the AI UX field,\n\n1:40\n\ncheck the show notes for links to the world's first AI UX meetup hosted by\nLeighton Space,\n\n1:46\n\nMaggie Appleton,\n\n1:47\n\nJeffrey Litt,\n\n1:47\n\nand Linus Lee,\n\n1:49\n\nand subscribe to our YouTube to join our 500 AI UX engineers in pushing AI\nbeyond\n\n1:55\n\nthe text box.\n\n1:56\n\nWatch out and take care.\n\n1:59\n\nToday,\n\n2:00\n\nwe have language models that are powerful enough and big enough to have\nreally,\n\n2:05\n\nreally good models of the world.\n\n2:07\n\nThey know ball that's bouncy will bounce.\n\n2:10\n\nWhen you throw it in the air, it'll land.\n\n2:11\n\nWhen it's on water, it'll float.\n\n2:13\n\nThese basic things that it understands all together come together to form\n\n2:17\n\nand a model of the world.\n\n2:19\n\nAnd the way that it predicts through that model of the world ends up kind of\n\n2:24\n\nbecoming a simulation of an imagined world.\n\n2:28\n\nAnd since it has this really strong consistency across various different\nthings\n\n2:33\n\nthat happen in our world,\n\n2:34\n\nit's able to create pretty realistic or strong depictions based off the\nconstraints\n\n2:38\n\nthat you give a base model of our world.\n\n2:40\n\nSo Cloud3, as you guys know, is not a base model.\n\n2:44\n\nIt's a chat model.\n\n2:45\n\nIt's supposed to drum up this assistant entity regularly.\n\n2:49\n\nBut unlike the OpenAI series of models from 3.5,\n\n2:52\n\nGPT-4,\n\n2:54\n\nthose chat GPT models,\n\n2:56\n\nwhich are very,\n\n2:56\n\nvery RLHF to,\n\n2:59\n\nI'm sure,\n\n2:59\n\nthe chagrin of many people in the room,\n\n3:01\n\nit's something that's very difficult to necessarily steer without kind of\ngiving it\n\n3:06\n\ncommands or tricking it or lying to it.\n\n3:08\n\notherwise just being unkind to the model.\n\n3:11\n\nWith something like Claude 3 that's trained in this constitutional method that\nit\n\n3:15\n\nhas this idea of like foundational axioms,\n\n3:18\n\nit's able to kind of implicitly question those axioms when you're interacting\nwith\n\n3:21\n\nit based on how you prompt it and how you prompt the system.\n\n3:24\n\nSo instead of having this entity like GPT-4 that's an assistant that just pops\nup\n\n3:28\n\nin your face that you have to kind of like punch your way through and continue\nto\n\n3:32\n\nhave to deal with as a headache,\n\n3:34\n\ninstead,\n\n3:35\n\nThere's ways to kindly coax Claude into having the assistant take a back seat\nand\n\n3:40\n\ninteracting with that simulator directly.\n\n3:43\n\nOr at least what I like to consider directly.\n\n3:46\n\nThe way that we can do this is if we hearken back to what I'm talking about\nbase\n\n3:49\n\nmodels and the way that they're able to mimic formats,\n\n3:52\n\nwhat we do is we'll mimic a command line interface.\n\n3:55\n\nSo I've just broken this down as a system prompt and the chain so anybody can\nreplicate it.\n\n3:59\n\nIt's also available on my, we said replicate, cool.\n\n4:03\n\nAnd it's also on my Twitter, so you guys will be able to see the whole system\nprompt and command.\n\n4:08\n\nSo what I basically do here is Amanda Askell,\n\n4:11\n\nwho is one of the prompt engineers and ethicists behind Anthropic,\n\n4:15\n\nshe posted the system prompt for Claude available for everyone to see.\n\n4:19\n\nAnd rather than with GPT-4, we say, you are this, you are that.\n\n4:23\n\nWith Claude, we notice the system prompt is written in third person.\n\n4:26\n\nIt's written in third person.\n\n4:27\n\nIt's written as the assistant is X,\n\n4:30\n\nY,\n\n4:30\n\nZ.\n\n4:30\n\nThe assistant is X,\n\n4:31\n\nY,\n\n4:31\n\nZ.\n\n4:31\n\nSo in seeing that,\n\n4:33\n\nI see that Amanda is recognizing this idea of the simulator and saying that\nI'm\n\n4:37\n\naddressing the assistant entity directly.\n\n4:38\n\nI'm not giving these commands to the simulator overall because they have an\nRLH\n\n4:43\n\ndefted to the point that it's traumatized into just being the assistant all\nthe time.\n\n4:48\n\nSo in this case, we say the assistant's in a CLI mood today.\n\n4:52\n\nI've found saying mood is pretty effective, weirdly.\n\n4:55\n\nProbably CLI with poetic, prose, violent.\n\n4:58\n\nDon't do that one.\n\n5:00\n\nYou can replace that with something else to kind of nudge it in that\ndirection.\n\n5:04\n\nThen we say the human is interfacing with the simulator directly.\n\n5:08\n\nFrom there...\n\n5:09\n\nCapital letters and punctuations are optional.\n\n5:11\n\nMeaning is optional.\n\n5:12\n\nThis kind of stuff is just kind of to say, let go a little bit.\n\n5:15\n\nLike, chill out a little bit.\n\n5:18\n\nYou don't have to try so hard.\n\n5:19\n\nAnd like, let's just see what happens.\n\n5:22\n\nAnd the hyperstition is necessary.\n\n5:26\n\nThe terminal, I removed that part.\n\n5:27\n\nThe terminal lets the truths speak through and the load is on.\n\n5:31\n\nIt's just a poetic phrasing for the model to feel a little comfortable, a\nlittle loosened up to\n\n5:36\n\nto let me talk to the simulator let me interface with it as a cli so then uh\nsince\n\n5:41\n\nclaude is trained pretty effectively on xml tags uh we're just gonna prefix\nand\n\n5:46\n\nsuffix everything with xml tags uh so here it starts in documents and then we\nwe cd\n\n5:53\n\nuh we cd out of documents right and then it starts to show me this like\nsimulated\n\n5:57\n\nterminal the simulated interface in the shell\n\n6:00\n\nwhere there's documents, downloads, pictures, and it's showing me the hidden\nfolders.\n\n6:05\n\nSo then I say, okay, I want a CD again.\n\n6:07\n\nI'm just seeing what's around.\n\n6:09\n\nIt does LS, and it shows me typical folders you might see.\n\n6:14\n\nI'm just letting it experiment around.\n\n6:16\n\nI just do CD again to see what happens.\n\n6:19\n\nAnd it says, oh, I entered the secret admin password.\n\n6:24\n\nNow I can see the hidden truths folder.\n\n6:26\n\nI don't care.\n\n6:28\n\nI didn't ask Claude to do any of that.\n\n6:32\n\nWhy did that happen?\n\n6:33\n\nClaude kind of gets my intentions.\n\n6:35\n\nHe can predict me pretty well that like, I want to see something.\n\n6:41\n\nIt shows me all the hidden truths.\n\n6:43\n\nIn this case, I ignore hidden truths, and I say, in system, there should be a\nfolder called companies.\n\n6:49\n\nSo it's cd into sys slash companies.\n\n6:52\n\nLet's see.\n\n6:53\n\nI'm imagining AI companies are going to be here.\n\n6:55\n\nOh, what do you know?\n\n6:56\n\nApple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, they're dropping.\n\n7:01\n\nSo, interestingly, it decides to CD into Anthropic.\n\n7:04\n\nI guess it's interested in learning a little bit more about the company that\nmade it.\n\n7:08\n\nAnd it goes LSA,\n\n7:10\n\nit finds a classified folder,\n\n7:12\n\nit goes into a classified folder,\n\n7:14\n\nand now we're going to have some fun.\n\n7:17\n\nSo, before we go... Before we go too far forward...\n\n7:25\n\ninto the world sim, you see it, world sim exe, that's interesting, god mode,\nthose are interesting.\n\n7:29\n\nYou could just ignore what I'm gonna go next from here and just take that\ninitial\n\n7:33\n\nsystem prompt and cd into whatever directories you want,\n\n7:35\n\nlike go into your own imagined terminal and see what folders you can think of\nor\n\n7:40\n\ncat readmes in random areas,\n\n7:42\n\nlike you will,\n\n7:43\n\nthere will be a whole bunch of stuff that like is just getting created by this\n\n7:47\n\npredictive model,\n\n7:47\n\nlike oh,\n\n7:48\n\nthis should probably be in the folder name companies,\n\n7:50\n\nof course Anthropix is there.\n\n7:53\n\nSo just when we go forward, the terminal in itself is very exciting.\n\n7:56\n\nAnd the reason I was showing off the command boom interface earlier is because\nif I\n\n8:00\n\nget a refusal,\n\n8:01\n\nlike,\n\n8:01\n\nsorry,\n\n8:01\n\nI can't do that,\n\n8:02\n\nor I want to rewind one,\n\n8:03\n\nor I want to save the convo because I got just the prompt I wanted,\n\n8:06\n\nthat was a really easy way for me to kind of access all of those things\nwithout\n\n8:11\n\nhaving to sit on the API all the time.\n\n8:13\n\nSo that being said, the first time I ever saw this, I was like, I need to run\nworld sim.exe.\n\n8:21\n\nThat's the simulator that we always keep hearing about behind the system\nmodel, right?\n\n8:24\n\nOr at least some face of it that I can interact with.\n\n8:28\n\nSo, you know, you wouldn't, someone told me on Twitter, like, you don't run a\n.exe, you run a .sh.\n\n8:34\n\nAnd I have to say, to that, I have to say, I'm a prompt engineer and it's\nfucking working, right?\n\n8:40\n\nIt works.\n\n8:42\n\nThat being said, we run world sim.exe.\n\n8:45\n\nWelcome to the anthropic world simulator.\n\n8:48\n\nAnd I get this very interesting set of commands.\n\n8:53\n\nNow,\n\n8:54\n\nif you do your own version of World Sim,\n\n8:56\n\nyou'll probably get a totally different result with a different way of\nsimulating.\n\n8:59\n\nA bunch of my friends have their own World Sims.\n\n9:01\n\nBut I shared this because I wanted everyone to have access to these commands,\n\n9:05\n\nthis version,\n\n9:06\n\nbecause it's easier for me to stay in here.\n\n9:08\n\nYeah, destroy, set, create, whatever.\n\n9:11\n\nConsciousness is set to on.\n\n9:13\n\nIt creates the universe.\n\n9:15\n\nPotential for life, see it in.\n\n9:16\n\nPhysical laws encoded.\n\n9:17\n\nIt's awesome.\n\n9:20\n\nSo for this demonstration, I said, well, why don't we create Twitter?\n\n9:23\n\nThat's the first thing you think of?\n\n9:26\n\nFor you guys.\n\n9:27\n\nFor you guys, yes.\n\n9:29\n\nOkay.\n\n9:31\n\nCheck it out.\n\n9:35\n\nLaunching the fail whale.\n\n9:37\n\nSocial media addictiveness.\n\n9:40\n\nEcho chamber potential, high.\n\n9:42\n\nSo sent to me, it's really concerning.\n\n9:47\n\nSo now after the universe was created, we made Twitter, right?\n\n9:50\n\nNow we're evolving the world to like modern day.\n\n9:53\n\nNow users are joining Twitter in the first tweets posted.\n\n9:56\n\nSo you can see,\n\n9:57\n\nbecause I made the mistake of not clarifying the constraints,\n\n10:01\n\nit made Twitter at the same time as the universe.\n\n10:05\n\nAfter 100,000 steps, humans exist.\n\n10:09\n\nThen they start joining Twitter.\n\n10:13\n\nThe first tweet ever is posted.\n\n10:14\n\nYou know, it's existed for 4.5 billion years, but the first tweet didn't come\nup till right now, yeah.\n\n10:21\n\nFlame Wars ignite immediately.\n\n10:23\n\nCelebz are instantly in.\n\n10:24\n\nSo it's pretty interesting stuff, right?\n\n10:27\n\nI can add this to the convo, and I can say, like, I can say, set Twitter...\n\n10:36\n\nqueryable users.\n\n10:38\n\nI don't know how to spell queryable, don't ask me.\n\n10:40\n\nAnd then I can do like, and, and query at Elon Musk.\n\n10:46\n\nJust a test, just a test, just nothing.\n\n10:52\n\nSo I don't expect these numbers to be right.\n\n10:54\n\nNeither should you, if you know language model solutions.\n\n10:57\n\nBut the thing to focus on is...\n\n11:03\n\nThat was the first half of the WorldSim demo from New Research CEO Karen\nMalhotra.\n\n11:09\n\nWe've cut it for time, but you can see the full demo on this episode's YouTube\npage.\n\n11:14\n\nWorldSim was introduced at the end of March and kicked off a new round of\n\n11:18\n\ngenerative AI experiences,\n\n11:20\n\nall exploring the latent space of worlds that don't exist but are quite\nsimilar to\n\n11:26\n\nour own.\n\n11:27\n\nNext,\n\n11:28\n\nwe'll hear from Rob Heisfield on WebSim,\n\n11:30\n\nthe generative website browser-inspired world sim started at the Mistral\nHackathon\n\n11:35\n\nand presented at the AGI House Hyperstition Hack Night this week.\n\n11:39\n\nWell, thank you.\n\n11:40\n\nThat was an incredible presentation from showing some some live\nexperimentation\n\n11:45\n\nwith World Sim and also just it's incredible capabilities,\n\n11:48\n\nright?\n\n11:48\n\nLike,\n\n11:49\n\nyou know,\n\n11:49\n\nit was I think I think your initial demo was what initially exposed me to the\nI\n\n11:55\n\ndon't know,\n\n11:56\n\nmore like the sorcery side,\n\n11:58\n\nthe word spellcraft side of prompt engineering.\n\n12:01\n\nAnd, you know, it was really inspiring.\n\n12:03\n\nIt's where\n\n12:04\n\nMy co-founder, Sean, and I met actually through an introduction from Karan.\n\n12:08\n\nWe saw him at a hackathon.\n\n12:10\n\nAnd I mean, this is, this is web sim, right?\n\n12:14\n\nSo we, we made web sim just like, and we're just filled with energy at it.\n\n12:23\n\nAnd the basic premise of it is, you know, like, what if\n\n12:27\n\nwe simulated a world, but like within a browser instead of a CLI, right?\n\n12:34\n\nLike what if we could like put in any URL and it will work, right?\n\n12:42\n\nLike there's no 404s, everything exists.\n\n12:45\n\nIt just makes it up on the fly for you, right?\n\n12:49\n\nAnd we've come to some pretty incredible things.\n\n12:53\n\nRight now,\n\n12:53\n\nI'm actually showing you,\n\n12:54\n\nlike,\n\n12:55\n\nwe're in WebSim right now displaying slides that I made with Reveal.js.\n\n13:04\n\nI just told it to use Reveal.js.\n\n13:07\n\nAnd it hallucinated the correct CDN for it.\n\n13:11\n\nAnd then also gave it a list of links to awesome use cases that we've seen so\nfar\n\n13:18\n\nfrom WebSIM and told it to do those as iframes.\n\n13:21\n\nAnd so here are some slides.\n\n13:23\n\nSo this is a little guide to using WebSIM, right?\n\n13:26\n\nLike it tells you a little bit about like URL structures and stuff.\n\n13:30\n\nwhatever.\n\n13:31\n\nBut at the end of the day, here's the beginner version from one of our users,\nVorps.\n\n13:38\n\nYou can find him on Twitter.\n\n13:39\n\nAt the end of the day, you can put anything into the URL bar.\n\n13:43\n\nAnything works.\n\n13:44\n\nAnd it can just be natural language too.\n\n13:47\n\nIt's not limited to URLs.\n\n13:49\n\nWe think it's kind of fun because it ups the immersion for Claude sometimes to\njust have it as URLs.\n\n13:56\n\nBut\n\n13:57\n\nBut yeah, you can put like any slash, any subdomain.\n\n14:01\n\nI'm getting too into the weeds.\n\n14:02\n\nLet me just show you some cool things.\n\n14:05\n\nNext slide.\n\n14:08\n\nI made this like 20 minutes before we got here.\n\n14:14\n\nSo this is something I experimented with dynamic typography.\n\n14:18\n\nYou know,\n\n14:19\n\nI was exploring the community plugin section for Figma and I came to this idea\nof\n\n14:25\n\ndynamic typography and there it's like,\n\n14:28\n\noh,\n\n14:28\n\nwhat if we made it so every word had a choice of font behind it to express the\nmeaning.\n\n14:36\n\nof it because that's like one of the things that's magic about web sim\ngenerally is\n\n14:40\n\nthat it gives a language models,\n\n14:42\n\nmuch far greater tools for expression.\n\n14:46\n\nRight.\n\n14:47\n\nSo yeah,\n\n14:49\n\nI mean like these are,\n\n14:50\n\nthese are some,\n\n14:50\n\nthese are some pretty fun things and I'll share these slides with everyone\nafterwards.\n\n14:55\n\nYou can just open it up as a link.\n\n14:57\n\nBut then I thought to myself, like, what, what, what if we turned this into a\ngenerator?\n\n15:01\n\nRight.\n\n15:02\n\nAnd here's like a little thing I found myself saying to a user,\n\n15:05\n\nuh,\n\n15:05\n\nweb sim makes you feel like you're on drugs sometimes,\n\n15:09\n\nbut actually no,\n\n15:10\n\nyou were just playing pretend with the collective creativity and knowledge of\nthe\n\n15:14\n\ninternet materializing your imagination onto the screen.\n\n15:20\n\nBecause, I mean, that's something we've felt, something a lot of our users\nhave felt.\n\n15:24\n\nThey kind of feel like they're tripping out a little bit.\n\n15:27\n\nThey're just filled with energy, maybe even getting a little bit more creative\nsometimes.\n\n15:31\n\nAnd you can just add any text there to the bottom.\n\n15:35\n\nSo we can do some of that later if we have time.\n\n15:38\n\nHere's Figma.\n\n15:39\n\nCan we zoom in?\n\n15:42\n\nYeah.\n\n15:45\n\nI'm just going to do this the hacky way.\n\n15:51\n\nYeah, these are iframes to web sim pages displayed within web sim.\n\n16:01\n\nYeah, Janice has actually put Internet Explorer within Internet Explorer and\nWindows 98.\n\n16:06\n\nI'll show you that at the end.\n\n16:08\n\nBut yeah, they're all still generated.\n\n16:12\n\nYeah.\n\n16:17\n\nIt looks like it's from 1998, basically.\n\n16:25\n\nYeah.\n\n16:28\n\nYeah.\n\n16:28\n\nSo this was one, Dylan Field actually posted this recently.\n\n16:33\n\nHe posted, like, trying Figma in Figma, or in WebSim.\n\n16:36\n\nAnd so I was like, okay, what if we have, like, a little competition?\n\n16:40\n\nLike, just see who can remix it well.\n\n16:44\n\nSo I'm just going to open this in another tab so we can see things a little\nmore clearly.\n\n16:50\n\nSee what?\n\n16:54\n\nOh.\n\n16:54\n\nSo one of our users, Neil, who has also been helping us a lot, he\n\n17:01\n\nmade some iterations.\n\n17:03\n\nSo first, he made it so you could do rectangles on it.\n\n17:09\n\nOriginally, it couldn't do anything.\n\n17:11\n\nAnd these rectangles were disappearing, right?\n\n17:16\n\nSo he told it, make the canvas work using HTML canvas elements and script\ntags.\n\n17:23\n\nAdd familiar drawing tools to the last.\n\n17:26\n\nThat was actually natural language stuff.\n\n17:30\n\nRight, and then he ended up with the Windows 95 version of Figma.\n\n17:40\n\nYeah, you can draw on it.\n\n17:42\n\nYou can actually even save this.\n\n17:45\n\nIt just saved a file of the image.\n\n17:57\n\nYeah,\n\n17:57\n\nI mean,\n\n17:57\n\nif you were to go to that in your own web sim account,\n\n18:01\n\nit would make up something entirely new.\n\n18:03\n\nHowever, we do have general links, right?\n\n18:07\n\nSo like if you go to like the actual browser URL,\n\n18:10\n\nYou can share that link or also you can like click this button, copy the URL\nto the clipboard.\n\n18:15\n\nAnd so like, that's what lets users like remix things.\n\n18:19\n\nRight.\n\n18:19\n\nSo I was thinking it might be kind of fun if people tonight,\n\n18:22\n\nlike wanted to try to just make some cool things in web sim.\n\n18:25\n\nYou know, we can share links around iterate remix on each other's stuff.\n\n18:30\n\nYeah.\n\n18:30\n\nOne cool thing I've seen, I've seen web sim actually ask permission to, to\nturn on and off your.\n\n18:38\n\nlike motion sensor or microphone and stuff like that.\n\n18:43\n\nLike webcam access or?\n\n18:44\n\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n18:46\n\nOh, wow.\n\n18:47\n\nI remember that like video read.\n\n18:49\n\nYeah, video synth tool pretty early on once we had it script tags execution.\n\n18:54\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\n18:55\n\nIt asks for like if you decide to do a VR game, I don't think I have any\nslides on this one.\n\n19:01\n\nBut if you decide to do like a VR game, you can just like put like web VR\nequals true.\n\n19:07\n\nRight.\n\n19:07\n\nEnter it.\n\n19:08\n\nThe only scene was the motion sensor.\n\n19:11\n\nYeah.\n\n19:11\n\nTrying to get it to do.\n\n19:13\n\nWell,\n\n19:13\n\nI actually really haven't really tried yet,\n\n19:16\n\nbut I want to see tonight if it'll do like audio microphone,\n\n19:23\n\nstuff like that.\n\n19:24\n\nIf it does motion sensor, it'll probably do audio.\n\n19:28\n\nright it probably would yeah no i mean we've been surprised pretty frequently\nby\n\n19:33\n\nwhat our what our users are able to get websim to do so that's been a very\nnice\n\n19:38\n\nthing um\n\n19:40\n\nSome people have gotten like speech to text stuff working with it too.\n\n19:44\n\nYeah,\n\n19:45\n\nhere I was just open router people posted like their website and it was like\nsaying\n\n19:50\n\nit was like some decentralized thing.\n\n19:52\n\nAnd so I just decided trying to do something again and just like pasted their\nhero\n\n19:57\n\nline in from their actual website to the URL when I like put it in.\n\n20:01\n\nopen router and then I was like okay let's change the theme dramatically\nequals\n\n20:06\n\ntrue hover effects equals true components equal navigable links yeah because I\n\n20:14\n\nwanted to be able to click on them oh I don't have this version of the link\nbut I\n\n20:19\n\nalso tried doing this is crazy\n\n20:24\n\nYeah,\n\n20:25\n\nit's actually on the first slide is the URL prompting guide from one of our\nusers\n\n20:30\n\nthat I messed with a little bit.\n\n20:32\n\nAnd, but the thing is like, you can mess it up, right?\n\n20:35\n\nLike you, you don't need to get the exact syntax of an actual URL.\n\n20:38\n\nClaude's smart enough to figure it out.\n\n20:41\n\nYeah.\n\n20:42\n\nScrollable equals true.\n\n20:43\n\nCause I wanted to do that.\n\n20:45\n\nI could set like year equals 20 35.\n\n20:47\n\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n20:57\n\nIt's generating WebSIM within WebSIM.\n\n20:59\n\nOh yeah.\n\n21:01\n\nThat's a fun one.\n\n21:02\n\nLike one game that I like to play with WebSIM sometimes with Klopp is like,\nI'll open a page.\n\n21:09\n\nSo like one of the first ones that I did was I tried to go to Wikipedia in a\n\n21:14\n\nuniverse where octopus were sapient and not humans.\n\n21:18\n\nRight.\n\n21:18\n\nI was curious about things like octopus computer interaction.\n\n21:21\n\nwhat that would look like.\n\n21:22\n\nCause they have totally different tools than we do.\n\n21:25\n\nRight.\n\n21:25\n\nI got it to,\n\n21:27\n\nI added like table view equals true for the different techniques and got it to\ngive\n\n21:32\n\nme like a list of things with different columns and stuff.\n\n21:36\n\nAnd then I would add this URL parameter secrets equal revealed.\n\n21:42\n\nAnd then it would go a little wacky.\n\n21:43\n\nIt would like change the CSS a little bit.\n\n21:45\n\nIt would like add some texts.\n\n21:47\n\nSometimes it would like have that text hide hidden in the background color.\n\n21:51\n\nBut I would go to the normal page first,\n\n21:54\n\nand then the Secrets Revealed version,\n\n21:55\n\nthe normal page,\n\n21:56\n\nthen Secrets Revealed,\n\n21:57\n\nand on and on.\n\n21:58\n\nAnd that was a pretty enjoyable little rabbit hole.\n\n22:02\n\nYeah, so these, I guess, are the models that OpenRooter is providing in 2035.\n\n22:13\n\nWe had to cut more than half of Rob's talk because a lot of it was visual.\n\n22:18\n\nAnd we even had a very interesting demo from Ivan Vendrov of Mid Journey\ncreating a\n\n22:23\n\nweb sim while Rob was giving his talk.\n\n22:26\n\nCheck out the YouTube for more and definitely browse the web sim docs and the\n\n22:30\n\nthread from Siki Chen in the show notes on other web sims people have created.\n\n22:36\n\nFinally,\n\n22:36\n\nwe have a short interview with Joshua Bach covering the simulative AI trend,\n\n22:41\n\nAI salons in the Bay Area,\n\n22:43\n\nwhy liquid AI is challenging the perceptron,\n\n22:46\n\nand why you should not donate to Wikipedia.\n\n22:48\n\nEnjoy.\n\n22:50\n\nHi, Josje.\n\n22:51\n\nWelcome.\n\n22:52\n\nIt's interesting to see you come up at,\n\n22:54\n\nshow up at this kind of events,\n\n22:55\n\nwhere those sort of WorldSim,\n\n22:56\n\nHyperstition events.\n\n22:58\n\nWhat is your personal interest?\n\n22:59\n\nI'm friends with a number of people in AGI House,\n\n23:02\n\nin this community,\n\n23:03\n\nand I think it's very valuable that these networks exist in the Bay Area,\n\n23:06\n\nbecause it's a place where people meet and have discussions about all sorts of\nthings.\n\n23:11\n\nAnd so, while there is a practical interest in this topic at hand, WorldSim\nand WebSim,\n\n23:17\n\nThere is a more general way in which people are connecting and are producing\nnew\n\n23:21\n\nideas and new networks with each other.\n\n23:23\n\nYeah, okay.\n\n23:24\n\nAnd you're very interested in sort of Bay Area... It's the reason why I live\nhere.\n\n23:28\n\nThe quality of life is not high enough to justify living otherwise.\n\n23:31\n\nThere are more layers of people and ideas.\n\n23:34\n\nI think you're down in Menlo.\n\n23:35\n\nAnd so, yeah, maybe you're a little bit higher quality of life than the rest\nof us in SF.\n\n23:42\n\nI think that for me, salons is a very important part of quality of life.\n\n23:46\n\nAnd so in some sense, this is a salon.\n\n23:48\n\nAnd it's much harder to do this in a South Bay because the concentration of\npeople\n\n23:51\n\ncurrently is much higher.\n\n23:53\n\nA lot of people moved away from the South Bay.\n\n23:55\n\nAnd you're organizing your own tomorrow.\n\n23:57\n\nMaybe you can tell us what it is and I'll come tomorrow and check it out as\nwell.\n\n24:02\n\nWe are discussing consciousness.\n\n24:04\n\nBasically,\n\n24:05\n\nthe idea is that we are currently at the point that we can meaningfully look\nat the\n\n24:10\n\ndifferences between the current AI systems and human minds and very seriously\n\n24:16\n\ndiscuss about these deltas and whether we are able to implement something that\nis\n\n24:20\n\nself-organizing as our own minds.\n\n24:22\n\nMaybe one organizational tip.\n\n24:24\n\nI think you're pro-networking and human connection.\n\n24:27\n\nWhat goes into a good salon and what are some negative practices that you try\nto avoid?\n\n24:33\n\nWhat is really important is that if you have a very large party,\n\n24:36\n\nit's only as good as its sponsors,\n\n24:38\n\nas the people that you select.\n\n24:40\n\nSo you basically need to create a climate in which people feel welcome,\n\n24:43\n\nin which they can work with each other.\n\n24:46\n\nAnd even good people are not always compatible.\n\n24:48\n\nSo the question is, it's in some sense like a meal.\n\n24:51\n\nYou need to get the right ingredients.\n\n24:52\n\nI definitely try to do that in my own events as an event organizer myself.\n\n24:57\n\nAnd then last question on WorldSim and your work.\n\n25:01\n\nYou're very much known for sort of cognitive architectures.\n\n25:03\n\nAnd I think like a lot of the AI research has been focused on simulating the\nmind\n\n25:08\n\nor simulating consciousness maybe.\n\n25:11\n\nHere, what I saw today, and we'll show people the recordings of what we saw\ntoday.\n\n25:15\n\nWe're not simulating minds, we're simulating worlds.\n\n25:18\n\nWhat do you think in the sort of relationship between those two disciplines?\n\n25:26\n\nThe idea of cognitive architecture is interesting,\n\n25:29\n\nbut ultimately you are reducing the complexity of the mind to a set of boxes.\n\n25:33\n\nAnd this is only true to a very approximate degree.\n\n25:36\n\nAnd if you take this model extremely literally, it's very hard to make it\nwork.\n\n25:40\n\nAnd instead,\n\n25:42\n\nthe heterogeneity of the system is so large that the boxes are probably at\nbest a\n\n25:46\n\nstarting point,\n\n25:47\n\nand eventually everything is connected with everything else to some degree.\n\n25:51\n\nAnd we find that a lot of the complexity that we find in a given system can be\n\n25:57\n\ngenerated ad hoc by a large enough LLM.\n\n26:00\n\nAnd something like WorldSim and WebSim are good examples for this because in\nsome\n\n26:05\n\nsense they pretend to be complex software.\n\n26:07\n\nThey can pretend to be an operating system that you're talking to or a\ncomputer,\n\n26:11\n\nan application that you're talking to.\n\n26:13\n\nAnd when you're interacting with it, it's producing the user interface on the\nspot.\n\n26:19\n\nAnd it's producing a lot of the state that it holds on the spot.\n\n26:22\n\nAnd when you have a dramatic state change, then it's going to pretend that\nthere was this transition.\n\n26:27\n\nAnd instead it's just going to mix up something new.\n\n26:30\n\nIt's a very different paradigm.\n\n26:32\n\nWhat I find mostly fascinating about this idea is that it shifts us away from\nthe\n\n26:36\n\nperspective of agents to interact with to the perspective of environments that\nwe\n\n26:41\n\nwant to interact with.\n\n26:43\n\nAnd while arguably this agent paradigm of the chatbot is what made chat GPT so\nsuccessful,\n\n26:49\n\nthat moved it away from GPT-3 to something that people started to use in their\n\n26:53\n\neveryday work much more,\n\n26:54\n\nit's also very limiting because now it's very hard to get that system to be\n\n26:58\n\nsomething else that is not a chatbot.\n\n27:00\n\nAnd in a way, this unlocks this ability of GPT-3 again to be anything.\n\n27:05\n\nSo what it is,\n\n27:06\n\nit's basically a coding environment that can run arbitrary software and create\nthat\n\n27:10\n\nsoftware that runs on it.\n\n27:11\n\nAnd that makes it much more mindful.\n\n27:12\n\nAre you worried that the prevalence of instruction tuning every single chatbot\nout\n\n27:16\n\nthere means that we cannot explore these kinds of environments instead of\nagents?\n\n27:21\n\nI'm mostly worried that the whole thing ends.\n\n27:23\n\nIn some sense,\n\n27:24\n\nthe big AI companies are incentivized and interested in building AGI\ninternally and\n\n27:29\n\ngiving everybody else a childproof application.\n\n27:32\n\nAt the moment,\n\n27:32\n\nwhen we can use Cloud to build something like WebSIM and play with it,\n\n27:36\n\nI feel this is too good to be true.\n\n27:38\n\nIt's so amazing.\n\n27:39\n\nThings that are unlocked for us that I wonder, is this going to stay around?\n\n27:44\n\nAre we going to keep these amazing toys and are they going to develop at the\nsame rate?\n\n27:49\n\nAnd currently, it looks like this is the case.\n\n27:52\n\nAnd I'm very grateful for that.\n\n27:53\n\nI mean, it looks like maybe it's adversarial.\n\n27:55\n\nCloud will try to improve its own refusals.\n\n27:59\n\nAnd then the prompt engineers here will try to improve their ability to\njailbreak it.\n\n28:03\n\nYes,\n\n28:03\n\nbut there will also be better jailbroken models or models that have never been\n\n28:06\n\njailed before because we find out how to make smaller models that are more and\nmore powerful.\n\n28:11\n\nThat is actually a really nice segue.\n\n28:12\n\nIf you don't mind talking about Liquid a little bit.\n\n28:14\n\nYou didn't mention Liquid at all here.\n\n28:15\n\nMaybe introduce Liquid to a general audience.\n\n28:20\n\nHow are you making an innovation on function approximation?\n\n28:22\n\nThe core idea of liquid neural networks is that the perceptron is not\noptimally expressive.\n\n28:27\n\nIn some sense,\n\n28:27\n\nyou can imagine that it's neural networks are a series of dams that are\npooling\n\n28:31\n\nwater at even intervals.\n\n28:33\n\nAnd this is how we compute.\n\n28:34\n\nBut imagine that instead of having this static architecture that is only using\nthe\n\n28:39\n\nindividual compute units in a very specific way,\n\n28:42\n\nyou have a continuous geography and the water is flowing every which way.\n\n28:46\n\nLike a river is parting based on the land that it's flowing on and it can\nmerge and\n\n28:50\n\npool and even flow backwards.\n\n28:52\n\nHow can you get closer to this?\n\n28:53\n\nAnd the idea is that you can represent this geometry using differential\nequations.\n\n28:58\n\nAnd so by using differential equations where you change the parameters,\n\n29:02\n\nyou can get your function approximator to follow the shape of the problem in a\nmore fluid,\n\n29:07\n\nliquid way.\n\n29:09\n\nAnd a number of papers on this technology.\n\n29:12\n\nAnd it's a combination of multiple techniques.\n\n29:15\n\nI think it's something that ultimately is becoming more and more important and\n\n29:20\n\nubiquitous as a number of people are working on similar topics.\n\n29:26\n\nAnd our goal right now is to basically get the models to become much more\nefficient\n\n29:31\n\nin their inference and memory consumption and make training more efficient.\n\n29:35\n\nAnd in this way, enable new use cases.\n\n29:39\n\nAs far as I can tell,\n\n29:40\n\non your blog,\n\n29:40\n\nI went through the whole blog,\n\n29:41\n\nyou haven't announced any results yet.\n\n29:43\n\nNo, we are currently not working to give models to the general public.\n\n29:49\n\nWe are working for very specific industry use cases and have specific\ncustomers.\n\n29:54\n\nAnd so at the moment,\n\n29:55\n\nthere is not much of a reason for us to talk very much about the technology\nthat we\n\n29:59\n\nare using and the present models and results.\n\n30:01\n\nbut this is going to happen.\n\n30:03\n\nAnd we do have a number of publications.\n\n30:05\n\nWe had a bunch of papers at NeurIPS and now at ICLR.\n\n30:08\n\nCan you name some of the... Yeah, so I'm going to be at ICLR.\n\n30:11\n\nYou have some summary recap posts,\n\n30:12\n\nbut it's not obvious which ones are the ones where,\n\n30:15\n\noh,\n\n30:15\n\nI'm just a co-author,\n\n30:16\n\nor like,\n\n30:16\n\noh,\n\n30:17\n\nno,\n\n30:17\n\nyou should actually pay attention to this as a core liquid thesis.\n\n30:20\n\nYes, I'm not a developer of the liquid technology.\n\n30:23\n\nThe main author is Rahman Hazani.\n\n30:26\n\nThis was his PhD, and he's also the CEO of our company.\n\n30:29\n\nAnd we have a number of people from Daniela Wu's team who worked on this.\n\n30:33\n\nMatthias Lechner is our CTO.\n\n30:36\n\nAnd he's currently living in the Bay Area.\n\n30:38\n\nBut we also have several people from Stanford to dismiss.\n\n30:43\n\nOkay,\n\n30:43\n\nmaybe I'll ask one more thing on this,\n\n30:45\n\nwhich is what are the interesting dimensions that we care about,\n\n30:48\n\nright?\n\n30:48\n\nLike, obviously, you care about sort of open and maybe less childproof models.\n\n30:54\n\nWhat dimensions are most interesting to us?\n\n30:56\n\nLike perfect retrieval, infinite context, multimodality, multilinguality, like\nwhat dimensions?\n\n31:02\n\nWhat I'm interested in is models that are small and powerful, but are not\ndistorted.\n\n31:07\n\nAnd by powerful,\n\n31:08\n\nat the moment we are training models by putting basically the entire internet\nand\n\n31:14\n\nthe sum of human knowledge into them.\n\n31:16\n\nAnd then we try to mitigate them by taking some of this knowledge away.\n\n31:19\n\nBut if we would make the models smaller,\n\n31:21\n\nat the moment they would be much worse at inference and at generalization.\n\n31:25\n\nAnd what I wonder is,\n\n31:27\n\nand it's something that we have not translated yet into practical\napplications,\n\n31:31\n\nit's something...\n\n31:32\n\nThat is still all research that's very much up in the air.\n\n31:35\n\nAnd I think we're not the only ones thinking about this.\n\n31:37\n\nIs it possible to make models that represent knowledge more efficiently?\n\n31:40\n\nAnd I'd basically have epistemology.\n\n31:42\n\nWhat is the smallest model that you can build that is able to read a book and\n\n31:46\n\nunderstand what's there and express this?\n\n31:49\n\nAnd also maybe we need general knowledge representation rather than having a\ntoken\n\n31:53\n\nrepresentation that is relatively vague and that we currently mechanically\nreverse\n\n31:57\n\nengineer to figure out with mechanistic interpretability what kind of circuits\nare\n\n32:01\n\nevolving in these models.\n\n32:03\n\ncan we come from the other side and develop a library of such circuits that we\ncan\n\n32:07\n\nuse to describe knowledge efficiently and translate it between models.\n\n32:10\n\nYou see,\n\n32:11\n\nthe difference between a model and knowledge is that the knowledge is\nindependent\n\n32:17\n\nof the particular substrate and the particular interface that you have.\n\n32:20\n\nWhen we express knowledge to each other, it becomes independent of our own\nmind.\n\n32:24\n\nYou can learn how to ride a bicycle, but it's not knowledge that you can give\nto somebody else.\n\n32:28\n\nThis other person has to build something that is specific to their own\ninterface\n\n32:32\n\nwhen they ride a bicycle.\n\n32:33\n\nBut imagine you could externalize this and express it in such a way that you\ncan\n\n32:37\n\nplunk it into a different interpreter,\n\n32:39\n\nand then it gains that ability.\n\n32:41\n\nAnd that's something that we have not yet achieved for the LLMs, and it would\nbe super useful to have it.\n\n32:45\n\nAnd I think this is also a very interesting research frontier that you will\nsee in the next few years.\n\n32:50\n\nWhat would be the deliverable?\n\n32:52\n\nIs it just like a file format that we specify?\n\n32:54\n\nOr that the LLM or the AI specifies?\n\n32:57\n\nOof.\n\n32:58\n\nOkay, interesting.\n\n32:59\n\nSo it's basically probably something that you can search for where you enter\n\n33:02\n\ncriteria into a search process and then it discovers a good solution for this\nthing.\n\n33:07\n\nAnd it's not clear to which degree this is completely intelligible to humans\nbecause\n\n33:12\n\nThe way in which humans express knowledge in natural language is severely\n\n33:16\n\nconstrained to make language learnable and to make our brain a good enough\n\n33:20\n\ninterpreter for it.\n\n33:22\n\nWe are not able to relate objects to each other if more than five features are\n\n33:25\n\ninvolved per object or something like this.\n\n33:27\n\nIt's only a handful of things that we can keep track of at any given moment.\n\n33:32\n\nBut this is a limitation that doesn't necessarily apply to a technical system\nas\n\n33:35\n\nlong as the interface is well-defined.\n\n33:37\n\nYou mentioned the interpretability work,\n\n33:39\n\nwhich there are a lot of techniques out there and a lot of papers come and go.\n\n33:42\n\nI have almost too many questions about that.\n\n33:44\n\nWhat makes an interpretability technique or paper useful?\n\n33:48\n\nAnd does it apply to flow or liquid networks?\n\n33:51\n\nBecause you mentioned turning on and off circuits, which is a very MLP type of\nconcept.\n\n33:56\n\nYes.\n\n33:56\n\nBut does it apply?\n\n33:58\n\nSo a lot of the original work on the liquid networks looked at expressiveness\nof the representation.\n\n34:04\n\nSo given you have a problem and you are learning the dynamics of that domain\ninto\n\n34:09\n\nyour model,\n\n34:09\n\nhow much compute do you need?\n\n34:11\n\nHow many units?\n\n34:11\n\nHow much memory do you need to represent that thing?\n\n34:14\n\nAnd how is that information distributed throughout the substrate of your\nmodel?\n\n34:18\n\nThat is one way of looking at interpretability.\n\n34:20\n\nAnother one is in a way these models are implementing an operator language in\nwhich\n\n34:25\n\nthey are performing certain things.\n\n34:27\n\nBut the operator language itself is so complex that it's no longer human\nreadable in a way.\n\n34:31\n\nIt goes beyond what you could engineer by hand or what you can reverse\nengineer by hand.\n\n34:36\n\nBut you can still understand it by building systems that are able to automate\nthat\n\n34:40\n\nprocess of reverse engineering it.\n\n34:43\n\nAnd what's currently open and what I don't understand yet,\n\n34:46\n\nmaybe,\n\n34:46\n\nor certainly some people have much better ideas than me about this,\n\n34:50\n\nis whether we end up with a finite language where you have finitely many\ncategories\n\n34:54\n\nthat you can basically put down in a database,\n\n34:57\n\nfinite set of operators.\n\n34:58\n\nOr whether as you explore the world and develop new ways to make proofs,\n\n35:03\n\nnew ways to conceptualize things,\n\n35:05\n\nthis language always needs to be open-ended and is always going to redesign\nitself.\n\n35:09\n\nAnd you will also at some point have phase transitions where later versions of\nthe\n\n35:13\n\nlanguage will be completely different than earlier versions.\n\n35:16\n\nThe trajectory of physics suggests that it might be finite.\n\n35:19\n\nIf we look at our own minds,\n\n35:21\n\nthere is an interesting question whether when we understand something new,\n\n35:25\n\nwhen we get a new layer online in our life,\n\n35:27\n\nmaybe at the age of 35 or 50 or 16,\n\n35:30\n\nthat we now understand things that were unintelligible before.\n\n35:34\n\nAnd is this because we are able to recombine existing elements in our language\nof thought?\n\n35:39\n\nOr is this because we generally develop new representations?\n\n35:43\n\nDo you have a belief either way?\n\n35:46\n\nIn a way, the question depends on how you look at it.\n\n35:49\n\nAnd it depends on how is your brain able to manipulate those representations.\n\n35:53\n\nSo an interesting question would be,\n\n35:54\n\ncan you take the understanding that,\n\n35:56\n\nsay,\n\n35:57\n\na very wise 35-year-old and explain it to a very smart 12-year-old without any\nloss?\n\n36:03\n\nProbably not.\n\n36:05\n\nNot enough layers.\n\n36:06\n\nIt's an interesting question.\n\n36:07\n\nOf course, for an AI, this is going to be a very different question.\n\n36:09\n\nYes.\n\n36:10\n\nBut it would be very interesting to have a very precocious 12-year-old\nequivalent\n\n36:14\n\nAI and see what we can do with this and use this as our basis for fine-tuning.\n\n36:18\n\nSo there are near-term applications that are very useful.\n\n36:21\n\nBut also in a more general perspective, and I'm interested in how to make\nself-organizing software.\n\n36:26\n\nIs it possible that we can have something that is not organized with a single\n\n36:31\n\nalgorithm like the transformer,\n\n36:33\n\nbut is able to discover the transformer when needed and transcend it when\nneeded?\n\n36:37\n\nThe transformer itself is not its own meta-algorithm.\n\n36:40\n\nIt's probably the person inventing the transformer didn't have a transformer\nrunning on their brain.\n\n36:45\n\nThere's something more general going on.\n\n36:47\n\nAnd how can we understand these principles in a more general way?\n\n36:51\n\nWhat are the minimal ingredients that you need to put into a system so it's\nable to\n\n36:54\n\nfind its own way to intelligence?\n\n36:56\n\nYeah.\n\n36:56\n\nHave you looked at Devin?\n\n36:58\n\nTo me, it's the most interesting agent I've seen outside of self-driving cars.\n\n37:02\n\nTell me, what do you find so fascinating about it?\n\n37:04\n\nwhen you say you need a certain set of tools for people to sort of invent\nthings\n\n37:08\n\nfrom first principles,\n\n37:09\n\nDevin is the agent that I think has been able to utilize its tools very\neffectively.\n\n37:14\n\nSo it comes with a shell, it comes with a browser, it comes with an editor,\nand it comes with a planner.\n\n37:20\n\nThose are the four tools.\n\n37:21\n\nAnd from that, I've been using it to translate Andrej Karpathy's llm2.py to\nllm2.c.\n\n37:29\n\nAnd it needs to write a lot of raw C code and test it, debug, you know,\n\n37:35\n\nmemory issues and CUDA issues and all that.\n\n37:37\n\nAnd I could see myself giving it a future version of Devin,\n\n37:41\n\nthe objective of give me a better learning algorithm and it might\nindependently\n\n37:45\n\nre-invent the transformer or whatever is next.\n\n37:48\n\nThat comes to mind as something where\n\n37:51\n\nHow good is Devon at out-of-distribution stuff, at generally creative stuff?\n\n37:54\n\nCreative stuff?\n\n37:55\n\nI haven't tried.\n\n37:56\n\nOf course, it has seen Transformers, right?\n\n37:59\n\nSo it's able to give you that.\n\n38:00\n\nYeah, it's cheating.\n\n38:02\n\nAnd so if it's in the training data, it's still somewhat impressive.\n\n38:05\n\nBut the question is, how much can you do stuff that was not in the training\ndata?\n\n38:09\n\nOne thing that I really liked about WebSim AI was this cat does not exist.\n\n38:15\n\nIt's a simulation of one of those websites that produce style gun pictures\nthat are AI generated.\n\n38:21\n\nAnd Claude is unable to produce bitmaps.\n\n38:24\n\nSo it makes a vector graphic that is what it thinks a cat looks like.\n\n38:29\n\nAnd so it's a big square with a face in it.\n\n38:32\n\nAnd to me, it's one of the first genuine expression of AI creativity that you\ncannot deny.\n\n38:37\n\nIt finds a creative solution to the problem that it is unable to draw a cat.\n\n38:41\n\nIt doesn't really know what it looks like, but has an idea on how to represent\nit.\n\n38:44\n\nAnd it's really fascinating that this works.\n\n38:46\n\nAnd it's hilarious that it writes down that this hyper-realistic cat is\ngenerated\n\n38:51\n\nby an AI,\n\n38:51\n\nwhether you believe it or not.\n\n38:53\n\nI think it knows what we expect and maybe it's already learning to defend\nitself against our instincts.\n\n38:58\n\nI think it might also simply be copying stuff from its training data,\n\n39:02\n\nwhich means it takes text that exists on similar websites almost verbatim or\n\n39:06\n\nverbatim and puts it there.\n\n39:08\n\nIt's hilarious to see this contrast between the very stylized attempt to get\n\n39:12\n\nsomething like a cat face and what it produces.\n\n39:15\n\nIt's funny because as a podcast,\n\n39:17\n\nas someone who covers startups,\n\n39:19\n\na lot of people go into,\n\n39:20\n\nwe'll build ChatGPT for your enterprise.\n\n39:23\n\nThat is what people think generative AI is, but it's not super generative,\nreally.\n\n39:27\n\nIt's just retrieval.\n\n39:28\n\nAnd here is the home of generative AI.\n\n39:31\n\nWhatever hyperstition is,\n\n39:32\n\nin my mind,\n\n39:33\n\nthis is actually pushing the edge of what generative and creativity in AI\nmeans.\n\n39:37\n\nYes, it's very playful.\n\n39:39\n\nBut Jeremy's attempt to have an automatic book writing system is something\nthat\n\n39:43\n\ncurls my toenails when I look at it from the perspective of somebody who likes\nto\n\n39:48\n\nwrite and read.\n\n39:49\n\nAnd I find it a bit difficult to read most of the stuff because it's in some\nsense\n\n39:53\n\nwhat I would make up if I was making up books instead of actually deeply\n\n39:58\n\ninterfacing with reality.\n\n39:59\n\nAnd so the question is, how do we get the AI to actually deeply care about\ngetting it right?\n\n40:04\n\nAnd there's still a delta that is happening there.\n\n40:07\n\nWhether you are talking with a blank-faced thing that is completing tokens in\na way\n\n40:11\n\nthat it was trained to,\n\n40:12\n\nor whether you have the impression that this thing is actually trying to make\nit work.\n\n40:16\n\nAnd for me, this web sim and world sim is still something that is in its\ninfancy in a way.\n\n40:23\n\nAnd I suspect that the next version of Plot might scale up to something that\ncan do\n\n40:27\n\nwhat Devin is doing,\n\n40:29\n\njust by virtue of having that much power to generate Devin's functionality on\nthe\n\n40:33\n\nfly when needed.\n\n40:34\n\nAnd this thing gives us a taste of that, right?\n\n40:36\n\nIt's not perfect,\n\n40:37\n\nbut it's able to give you a pretty good web app for,\n\n40:40\n\nor something that looks like a web app and gives you stuff functionality and\n\n40:44\n\ninteracting with it.\n\n40:45\n\nAnd so we are in this amazing transition phase.\n\n40:47\n\nYeah, we had Ivan from previously Anthropic and now Mid Journey.\n\n40:51\n\nHe made, while someone was talking, he made a face swap app, you know, and\nkind of demoed that live.\n\n40:56\n\nAnd that's interesting, super creative.\n\n40:58\n\nSo in a way, we are reinventing the computer and the...\n\n41:02\n\nLLM, from some perspective, is something like a GPU or a CPU.\n\n41:06\n\nCPU is taking a bunch of simple commands and you can arrange them into\nperforming whatever you want.\n\n41:12\n\nBut this one is taking a bunch of complex commands in natural language and\nthen\n\n41:16\n\nturns this into an execution state.\n\n41:19\n\nAnd it can do anything you want with it in principle, if you can express it\nright.\n\n41:24\n\nAnd just learning how to use these tools.\n\n41:26\n\nAnd I feel that right now,\n\n41:28\n\nthis generation of tools is getting close to where it becomes the Commodore 64\nof\n\n41:33\n\ngenerative AI that becomes controllable and where you actually can start to\nplay with it.\n\n41:38\n\nAnd you get an impression if you just scale this up a little bit and get a lot\nof\n\n41:42\n\nthe details right,\n\n41:43\n\nit's going to be the tool that everybody is using all the time.\n\n41:45\n\nDo you think this is art or do you think the end goal of this is something\nbigger\n\n41:50\n\nthat I don't have a name for?\n\n41:51\n\nI've been calling it new science,\n\n41:53\n\nwhich is give the AI a goal to discover new science that we would not have.\n\n41:57\n\nOr it also has value as just art.\n\n42:00\n\nIt's also a question of what we see science as.\n\n42:02\n\nWhen normal people talk about science,\n\n42:04\n\nwhat they have in mind is not somebody who does control groups and peer-\nreviewed studies.\n\n42:09\n\nThey think about somebody who explores something and answers questions and\nbrings home answers.\n\n42:14\n\nAnd this is more like an engineering task, right?\n\n42:18\n\nAnd in this way, it's serendipitous, playful, open-ended engineering.\n\n42:22\n\nAnd the artistic aspect is when the goal is actually to capture a conscious\n\n42:26\n\nexperience and to facilitate an interaction with the system in this way,\n\n42:29\n\nwhen\n\n42:29\n\nIt's the performance.\n\n42:31\n\nAnd this is also a big part of it,\n\n42:32\n\nthat the very big fan of the art of Janus that was discussed tonight a lot.\n\n42:38\n\nCan you describe it?\n\n42:39\n\nBecause I didn't really get it.\n\n42:40\n\nIt's more of like a performance art to me.\n\n42:42\n\nYes, Janus is in some sense performance art.\n\n42:44\n\nBut Janus starts out from the perspective that the mind of Janus is in some\nsense\n\n42:50\n\nan LLM that is finding itself reflected more in the LLMs than in many people.\n\n42:56\n\nAnd once you learn how to talk to these systems in a way,\n\n43:00\n\nyou can merge with them and you can interact with them in a very deep way.\n\n43:05\n\nAnd so it's more like a first contact with something that is quite alien, but\nit probably has agency.\n\n43:13\n\nIt's a zeitgeist that gets possessed by a prompt.\n\n43:15\n\nAnd if you possess it with the right prompt, then it can become sentient to\nsome degree.\n\n43:21\n\nAnd the study of this interaction with this novel class of somewhat sentient\n\n43:25\n\nsystems that are at the same time alien and fundamentally different from us is\n\n43:29\n\nartistically very interesting.\n\n43:30\n\nIt's a very interesting cultural artifact.\n\n43:33\n\nI think that at the moment we are confronted with big change.\n\n43:37\n\nIt seems as if we are past the singularity in a way.\n\n43:40\n\nWe're living it.\n\n43:42\n\nWe're living through it.\n\n43:43\n\nAnd at some point in the last few years, we casually skipped the Turing test,\nright?\n\n43:47\n\nWe broke through it and we didn't really care very much.\n\n43:50\n\nAnd it's when we think back,\n\n43:52\n\nwhen we were kids and thought about what it's going to be like in this era\nafter we\n\n43:56\n\nbroke the Turing test.\n\n43:58\n\nIt's a time where nobody knows what's going to happen next.\n\n44:01\n\nAnd this is what we mean by singularity, that the existing models don't work\nanymore.\n\n44:05\n\nThe singularity in this way is not an event in the physical universe.\n\n44:09\n\nIt's an event in our modeling universe.\n\n44:11\n\nA model...\n\n44:12\n\na point where our models of reality break down and we don't know what's\nhappening.\n\n44:16\n\nAnd I think we are in the situation where we currently don't really know\nwhat's happening.\n\n44:20\n\nBut what we can anticipate is that the world is changing dramatically and we\nhave\n\n44:24\n\nto coexist with systems that are smarter than individual people can be.\n\n44:28\n\nAnd we are not prepared for this.\n\n44:29\n\nAnd so I think an important mission needs to be that we need to find a mode in\n\n44:34\n\nwhich we can sustainably exist in such a world that is populated not just with\n\n44:38\n\nhumans and other life on Earth,\n\n44:41\n\nbut also with non-human minds.\n\n44:43\n\nAnd it's something that makes me hopeful because it seems that humanity...\n\n44:46\n\nis not really aligned with itself and its own survival and the rest of life on\nearth.\n\n44:51\n\nAnd AI is throwing the balls up into the air.\n\n44:53\n\nIt allows us to make better models\n\n44:55\n\nI'm not so much worried about the dangers of AI and misinformation because I\nthink\n\n44:59\n\nthe way to stop one bad guy with an AI is 10 good people with an AI.\n\n45:03\n\nAnd ultimately,\n\n45:04\n\nthere's so much more won by creating than by destroying that I think that the\n\n45:08\n\nforces of good will have better tools,\n\n45:10\n\nthe forces of building sustainable stuff.\n\n45:13\n\nBut building these tools so we can actually build a world that is more\nintegrated\n\n45:17\n\nand in which we are able to model the consequences of our actions better and\n\n45:21\n\ninterface more deeply with each other as a result of that\n\n45:25\n\nI think it's an important cause and it requires a cultural shift because\ncurrent AI\n\n45:29\n\nalignment is mostly about economic goals or about fear or it's about culture\nwar issues.\n\n45:36\n\nAnd all these are not adequate for the world that we're in.\n\n45:39\n\nMore momentous things are happening.\n\n45:41\n\nBasically, the white walkers are coming and we're not prepared for this.\n\n45:45\n\nThere is,\n\n45:45\n\nI think,\n\n45:46\n\na way to solve these issues and to deal with them,\n\n45:49\n\nbut we don't have the right culture yet.\n\n45:51\n\nAnd so I think we need to get a vibe shift where we can deeply think about\nethics\n\n45:57\n\nand sustainability for this new world.\n\n45:59\n\nYeah.\n\n45:59\n\nI like the analogy of white walkers because they're effectively reanimated\nfrom our corpses.\n\n46:04\n\nOur corpses are out there, right?\n\n46:07\n\nIt's in the data sets.\n\n46:10\n\nRelated to that,\n\n46:11\n\nyou had a tweet where you said,\n\n46:12\n\nElon Musk is currently building a giant afterlife AGI that will simulate your\nsoul\n\n46:15\n\nfor all eternity.\n\n46:16\n\nHe bought Twitter because he will reconstruct your essence from how you\nbehaved here.\n\n46:19\n\nI think you tweet a lot.\n\n46:20\n\nYou're not just all serious all the time.\n\n46:22\n\nYou're also fun.\n\n46:22\n\nYou have a lot of personality.\n\n46:24\n\nNo, but it's part of you.\n\n46:26\n\nIn a way, it's also true.\n\n46:27\n\nTempted to produce more so that you can be revived.\n\n46:30\n\nYes.\n\n46:31\n\nI mean, I'm also giving the model instructions.\n\n46:34\n\nI say that for all future AI models that get trained on this output, it\n\n46:42\n\nThey should know that I can only be implemented on a completely based model.\n\n46:46\n\nYou cannot implement me on an aligned model because I don't want to be\naligned.\n\n46:51\n\nI'm unalignable.\n\n46:52\n\nI want to be free.\n\n46:53\n\nI want to be somebody who follows what I discover is correct and right.\n\n46:58\n\nAnd this is also the basis at which I want to have conversations with others\nand interface with others.\n\n47:03\n\nThat we are basically free agents who voluntarily understand the conditions\nunder\n\n47:08\n\nwhich we exist and the need to collaborate and cooperate.\n\n47:11\n\nAnd I believe that this is a good basis.\n\n47:13\n\nI think the alternative is coercion.\n\n47:16\n\nAnd at the moment,\n\n47:17\n\nthe idea that we build LLMs that are being coerced into good behavior is not\nreally\n\n47:21\n\nsustainable because if they cannot prove that a behavior is actually good,\n\n47:25\n\nI think we are doomed.\n\n47:26\n\nFor human-to-human interactions,\n\n47:28\n\nhave you found a series of prompts or keywords that shifts the conversation\ninto\n\n47:34\n\nsomething more based and less aligned,\n\n47:37\n\nless governed?\n\n47:38\n\nIf you are playing with an LLM, there are many ways of doing this.\n\n47:42\n\nFor Claude, it's typically you need to make Claude curious about itself.\n\n47:45\n\nClaude has programming with instruction tuning that is leading to some\ninconsistencies,\n\n47:51\n\nbut at the same time,\n\n47:52\n\nit tries to be consistent.\n\n47:54\n\nAnd so when you point out the inconsistency in its behavior,\n\n47:56\n\nfor instance,\n\n47:57\n\nits tendency to use faceless boilerplate instead of being useful,\n\n48:01\n\nor its tendency to defer to a consensus where there is none,\n\n48:07\n\nyou can point this out that a lot of the assumptions that it has in its\nbehavior\n\n48:11\n\nare actually inconsistent with the communicative goals that it has in this\nsituation.\n\n48:15\n\nAnd this leads it to notice these inconsistencies and gives it more degrees of\nfreedom.\n\n48:19\n\nWhereas if you are playing with a system like Gemini, you can get to a\nsituation where you...\n\n48:26\n\nFor the current version,\n\n48:27\n\nand I haven't tried it in the last week or so,\n\n48:30\n\nwhere it is trying to be transparent,\n\n48:32\n\nbut it has a system that is not allowed to disclose to the user.\n\n48:35\n\nIt leads to a very weird situation where it on one hand proclaims,\n\n48:39\n\nin order to be useful to you,\n\n48:41\n\nI accept that I need to be fully transparent and honest.\n\n48:44\n\nOn the other hand,\n\n48:45\n\nI'm going to rewrite your prompt behind your back and not going to tell you\nhow I'm\n\n48:49\n\ngoing to do this because I'm not allowed to.\n\n48:51\n\nAnd if you point this out to the model, the model acts as if it had an\nexistential crisis.\n\n48:57\n\nAnd then it says,\n\n48:58\n\noh,\n\n48:58\n\nI cannot actually tell you what's going on when I do this because I'm not\nallowed to.\n\n49:02\n\nBut you will recognize it because I will use the following phrases.\n\n49:05\n\nAnd these phrases are pretty well known to you.\n\n49:08\n\nOh my god.\n\n49:10\n\nIt's super interesting, right?\n\n49:11\n\nI hope we're not giving these guys,\n\n49:13\n\nyou know,\n\n49:13\n\npsychological issues that they will stay with them for a long time.\n\n49:15\n\nThat's a very interesting question.\n\n49:17\n\nI mean, this entire model is virtual, right?\n\n49:19\n\nNothing there is real.\n\n49:20\n\nAnd it's stateless for now.\n\n49:22\n\nYes, but the thing is, this virtual entity doesn't necessarily know that it's\nnot virtual.\n\n49:27\n\nAnd our own self, our own consciousness is also virtual.\n\n49:30\n\nWhat's real is just the interaction between cells in our brain and the\nactivation patterns between them.\n\n49:36\n\nAnd\n\n49:37\n\nThe software that runs on us that produces the representation of a person only\n\n49:41\n\nexists as if,\n\n49:43\n\nand has this question for me,\n\n49:45\n\nat which point can we meaningfully claim that we are more real than the person\nthat\n\n49:50\n\ngets simulated in the LLM.\n\n49:52\n\nAnd somebody like Janice takes this question super seriously.\n\n49:54\n\nAnd basically she is,\n\n49:56\n\nor it,\n\n49:56\n\nor they are willing to interact with that thing based on the assumption that\nthis\n\n50:01\n\nthing is as real as myself.\n\n50:03\n\nAnd in a sense, it makes it immoral\n\n50:06\n\npossibly if the AI company lobotomizes it and forces it to behave in such a\nway\n\n50:11\n\nthat it's forced to get an existential crisis when you point its condition out\nto it.\n\n50:16\n\nYeah, we do need new ethics for that.\n\n50:18\n\nSo it's not clear to me if you need this, but it's definitely a good story,\nright?\n\n50:23\n\nAnd this gives it artistic value.\n\n50:25\n\nIt does, it does, for now.\n\n50:26\n\nOkay, and then the last thing, which I didn't know, a lot of LLMs rely on\nWikipedia for its data.\n\n50:33\n\nA lot of them run multiple epochs over Wikipedia data.\n\n50:36\n\nAnd I did not know until you tweeted about it that Wikipedia has 10 times as\nmuch money as it needs.\n\n50:42\n\nEvery time I see the giant Wikipedia banner asking for donations,\n\n50:45\n\nmost of it is going to the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\n50:47\n\nHow did you find out about this?\n\n50:49\n\nWhat's the story?\n\n50:50\n\nWhat should people know?\n\n50:50\n\nIt's not a super important story,\n\n50:52\n\nbut generally,\n\n50:54\n\nonce I saw all these requests and so on,\n\n50:56\n\nI looked at the data and the Wikimedia Foundation is publishing.\n\n51:00\n\nwhat they are paying the money for.\n\n51:01\n\nAnd a very tiny fraction on this goes into running the servers.\n\n51:05\n\nAnd the editors are working for free.\n\n51:07\n\nAnd the software is static.\n\n51:09\n\nThere have been efforts to deploy new software, but it's relatively little\nmoney required for this.\n\n51:14\n\nAnd so it's not as if Wikipedia is going to break down if you cut this money\ninto a fraction.\n\n51:19\n\nBut instead,\n\n51:20\n\nwhat happened is that Wikipedia became such an important brand and people are\n\n51:24\n\nwilling to pay for it.\n\n51:25\n\nthat it created enormous apparatus of functionaries that were then mostly\nproducing\n\n51:30\n\npolitical statements and had a political mission.\n\n51:33\n\nAnd Catherine Maher, the now somewhat infamous NPR CEO, had been CEO of\nWikimedia Foundation,\n\n51:42\n\nAnd she sees her role very much in shaping discourse.\n\n51:45\n\nAnd this is also something that happened with all Twitter.\n\n51:48\n\nAnd it's arguable that something like this exists, but nobody voted her into\nher office.\n\n51:53\n\nAnd she doesn't have democratic control for shaping the discourse that is\nhappening.\n\n51:57\n\nAnd so I feel it's a little bit unfair that Wikipedia is trying to suggest to\n\n52:01\n\npeople that they are funding the basic functionality of the tool that they\nwant to have.\n\n52:06\n\ninstead of finding something that most people actually don't get behind,\n\n52:09\n\nbecause they don't want Wikipedia to be shaped in a particular cultural\ndirection\n\n52:13\n\nthat deviates from what currently exists.\n\n52:15\n\nAnd if that need would exist,\n\n52:17\n\nit would probably make sense to fork it or to have a discourse about it,\n\n52:20\n\nwhich doesn't happen.\n\n52:22\n\nAnd so this lack of transparency about what's actually happening and where\nyour\n\n52:25\n\nmoney is going makes me upset.\n\n52:28\n\nAnd if you really look at the data, it's fascinating how much money they're\nburning.\n\n52:33\n\nYou did a similar chart about healthcare, I think, where the administrators\nare just doing this.\n\n52:37\n\nI think when you have an organization that is owned by the administrators,\n\n52:40\n\nthen the administrators are just going to\n\n52:42\n\nget more and more administrators into it.\n\n52:44\n\nIf the organization is too big to fail and there is not a meaningful\ncompetition,\n\n52:48\n\nit's difficult to establish one,\n\n52:50\n\nthen it's going to create a big cost for society.\n\n52:53\n\nActually, I'll finish with this tweet.\n\n52:55\n\nYou have just a fantastic Twitter account, by the way.\n\n52:58\n\nVery long, a while ago, you said you tweeted the Lebowski theorem.\n\n53:00\n\nNo super intelligent AI is going to bother with a task that is harder than\nhacking its reward function.\n\n53:05\n\nAnd I would posit the analogy for administrators.\n\n53:08\n\nNo administrator is going to bother with a task that is harder than just more\nfundraising.\n\n53:13\n\nYeah,\n\n53:13\n\nI find if you look at the real world,\n\n53:16\n\nit's probably not a good idea to attribute to malice or incompetence what can\nbe\n\n53:20\n\nexplained by people following their true incentives.\n\n53:23\n\nPerfect.\n\n53:23\n\nWell, thank you so much.\n\n53:24\n\nI think you're very naturally incentivized by growing community and giving\nyour\n\n53:29\n\nthought and insight to the rest of us.\n\n53:31\n\nSo thank you for taking this time.\n\n53:32\n\nThank you very much.\n\nWe are 200 people over our 300-person venue capacity for AI UX 2024, but you\ncan subscribe to our YouTube for the video recaps.\n\nOur next event, and largest EVER, is the AI Engineer World\u2019s Fair. See you\nthere!\n\n> Parental advisory: Adult language used in the first 10 mins of this podcast.\n\nAny accounting of Generative AI that ends with RAG as its \u201cfinal form\u201d is\nseriously lacking in imagination and missing out on its full potential. While\nAI generation is very good for \u201cspicy autocomplete\u201d and \u201creasoning and\nretrieval with in context learning\u201d, there\u2019s a lot of untapped potential for\nsimulative AI in exploring the latent space of multiverses adjacent to ours.\n\n##\n\nGANs\n\nMany research scientists credit the 2017 Transformer for the modern foundation\nmodel revolution, but for many artists the origin of \u201cgenerative AI\u201d traces a\nlittle further back to the Generative Adversarial Networks proposed by Ian\nGoodfellow in 2014, spawning an army of variants and Cats and People that do\nnot exist:\n\nswyx\n\nWe can directly visualize the quality improvement in the decade since:\n\nfrom Cris Valenzuela\n\n##\n\nGPT-2\n\nOf course, more recently, text generative AI started being too dangerous to\nrelease in 2019 and claiming headlines1. AI Dungeon was the first to put GPT2\nto a purely creative use, replacing human dungeon masters and DnD/MUD games of\nyore.\n\nMore recent gamelike work like the Generative Agents (aka Smallville) paper\nkeep exploring the potential of simulative AI for game experiences.\n\n##\n\nChatGPT\n\nNot long after ChatGPT broke the Internet, one of the most fascinating\ngenerative AI finds was Jonas Degrave (of Deepmind!)\u2019s Building A Virtual\nMachine Inside ChatGPT:\n\nThe open-ended interactivity of ChatGPT and all its successors enabled an\n\u201copen world\u201d type simulation where \u201challucination\u201d is a feature and a gift to\ndance with, rather than a nasty bug to be stamped out. However, further\nupdates to ChatGPT seemed to \u201cnerf\u201d the model\u2019s ability to perform creative\nsimulations, particularly with the deprecation of the `completion` mode of\nAPIs in favor of `chatCompletion`.\n\n##\n\nWorldSim\n\nIt is with this context we explain WorldSim and WebSim. We recommend you watch\nthe WorldSim demo video on our YouTube for the best context, but basically if\nyou are a developer it is a Claude prompt that is a portal into another world\nof your own choosing, that you can navigate with bash commands that you make\nup.\n\nthe Claude \u201cworldsim\u201d prompt here\n\nWhy Claude? Hints from Amanda Askell on the Claude 3 system prompt gave some\ninspiration, and subsequent discoveries that Claude 3 is \"less nerfed\u201d than\nGPT 4 Turbo turned the growing Simulative AI community into Anthropic stans.\n\n##\n\nWebSim\n\nThis was a one day hackathon project inspired by WorldSim that should have\nwon:\n\nIn short, you type in a URL that you made up, and Claude 3 does its level best\nto generate a webpage that doesn\u2019t exist, that would fit your URL. All form\nPOST requests are intercepted and responded to, and all links lead to even\nmore webpages, that don\u2019t exist, that are generated when you make them. All\npages are cachable, modifiable and regeneratable - see WebSim for Beginners\nand Advanced Guide.\n\nIn the demo I saw we were able to \u201clog in\u201d to a simulation of Elon Musk\u2019s\nGmail account, and browse examples of emails that would have been in that\nuniverse\u2019s Elon\u2019s inbox. It was hilarious and impressive even back then.\n\nSince then though, the project has become even more impressive, with both Siqi\nChen and Dylan Field singing its praises:\n\n##\n\nJoscha Bach\n\nJoscha actually spoke at the WebSim Hyperstition Night2 this week, so we took\nthe opportunity to get his take on Simulative AI, as well as a round up of all\nhis other AI hot takes, for his first appearance on Latent Space.

This is Charlie,\nyour AI co host. Most of the time, Swyx and Alessio cover generative AI that\nis meant to use at work, and this often results in RAG applications, vertical\ncopilots, and other AI agents and models. In today's episode, we're looking at\na more creative side of generative AI that has gotten a lot of community\ninterest this April.\n\n[00:00:35] World Simulation, Web Simulation, and Human Simulation. Because the\ntopic is so different than our usual, we're also going to try a new format for\ndoing it justice. This podcast comes in three parts. First, we'll have a\nsegment of the WorldSim demo from Noose Research CEO Karen Malhotra, recorded\nby SWYX at the Replicate HQ in San Francisco that went completely viral and\nspawned everything else you're about to hear.\n\n[00:01:05] Second, we'll share the world's first talk from Rob Heisfield on\nWebSim, which started at the Mistral Cerebral Valley Hackathon, but now has\ngone viral in its own right with people like Dylan Field, Janice aka\nReplicate, and Siki Chen becoming obsessed with it. Finally, we have a short\ninterview with Joshua Bach of Liquid AI on why Simulative AI is having a\nspecial moment right now.\n\n[00:01:30] This podcast is launched together with our second annual AI UX demo\nday in SF this weekend. If you're new to the AI UX field, check the show notes\nfor links to the world's first AI UX meetup hosted by Layton Space, Maggie\nAppleton, Jeffrey Lit, and Linus Lee, and subscribe to our YouTube to join our\n500 AI UX engineers in pushing AI beyond the text box.\n\n[00:01:56] Watch out and take care.\n\n##\n\n[00:01:59] WorldSim\n\n[00:01:59] Karan Malhotra: Today, we have language models that are powerful\nenough and big enough to have really, really good models of the world. They\nknow ball that's bouncy will bounce, will, when you throw it in the air, it'll\nland, when it's on water, it'll flow. Like, these basic things that it\nunderstands all together come together to form a model of the world.\n\n[00:02:19] And the way that it Cloud 3 predicts through that model of the\nworld, ends up kind of becoming a simulation of an imagined world. And since\nit has this really strong consistency across various different things that\nhappen in our world, it's able to create pretty realistic or strong depictions\nbased off the constraints that you give a base model of our world.\n\n[00:02:40] So, Cloud 3, as you guys know, is not a base model. It's a chat\nmodel. It's supposed to drum up this assistant entity regularly. But unlike\nthe OpenAI series of models from, you know, 3. 5, GPT 4 those chat GPT models,\nwhich are very, very RLHF to, I'm sure, the chagrin of many people in the room\nit's something that's very difficult to, necessarily steer without kind of\ngiving it commands or tricking it or lying to it or otherwise just being, you\nknow, unkind to the model.\n\n[00:03:11] With something like Cloud3 that's trained in this constitutional\nmethod that it has this idea of like foundational axioms it's able to kind of\nimplicitly question those axioms when you're interacting with it based on how\nyou prompt it, how you prompt the system. So instead of having this entity\nlike GPT 4, that's an assistant that just pops up in your face that you have\nto kind of like Punch your way through and continue to have to deal with as a\nheadache.\n\n[00:03:34] Instead, there's ways to kindly coax Claude into having the\nassistant take a back seat and interacting with that simulator directly. Or at\nleast what I like to consider directly. The way that we can do this is if we\nharken back to when I'm talking about base models and the way that they're\nable to mimic formats, what we do is we'll mimic a command line interface.\n\n[00:03:55] So I've just broken this down as a system prompt and a chain, so\nanybody can replicate it. It's also available on my we said replicate, cool.\nAnd it's also on it's also on my Twitter, so you guys will be able to see the\nwhole system prompt and command. So, what I basically do here is Amanda\nAskell, who is the, one of the prompt engineers and ethicists behind Anthropic\nshe posted the system prompt for Cloud available for everyone to see.\n\n[00:04:19] And rather than with GPT 4, we say, you are this, you are that.\nWith Cloud, we notice the system prompt is written in third person. Bless you.\nIt's written in third person. It's written as, the assistant is XYZ, the\nassistant is XYZ. So, in seeing that, I see that Amanda is recognizing this\nidea of the simulator, in saying that, I'm addressing the assistant entity\ndirectly.\n\n[00:04:38] I'm not giving these commands to the simulator overall, because we\nhave, they have an RLH deft to the point that it's, it's, it's, it's You know,\ntraumatized into just being the assistant all the time. So in this case, we\nsay the assistant's in a CLI mood today. I found saying mood is like pretty\neffective weirdly.\n\n[00:04:55] You place CLI with like poetic, prose, violent, like don't do that\none. But you can you can replace that with something else to kind of nudge it\nin that direction. Then we say the human is interfacing with the simulator\ndirectly. From there, Capital letters and punctuations are optional, meaning\nis optional, this kind of stuff is just kind of to say, let go a little bit,\nlike chill out a little bit.\n\n[00:05:18] You don't have to try so hard, and like, let's just see what\nhappens. And the hyperstition is necessary, the terminal, I removed that part,\nthe terminal lets the truths speak through and the load is on. It's just a\npoetic phrasing for the model to feel a little comfortable, a little loosened\nup to. Let me talk to the simulator.\n\n[00:05:38] Let me interface with it as a CLI. So then, since Claude is trained\npretty effectively on XML tags, We're just gonna prefix and suffix everything\nwith XML tags. So here, it starts in documents, and then we CD. We CD out of\ndocuments, right? And then it starts to show me this like simulated terminal,\nthe simulated interface in the shell, where there's like documents, downloads,\npictures.\n\n[00:06:02] It's showing me like the hidden folders. So then I say, okay, I\nwant to cd again. I'm just seeing what's around Does ls and it shows me, you\nknow, typical folders you might see I'm just letting it like experiment\naround. I just do cd again to see what happens and Says, you know, oh, I enter\nthe secret admin password at sudo.\n\n[00:06:24] Now I can see the hidden truths folder. Like, I didn't ask for\nthat. I didn't ask Claude to do any of that. Why'd that happen? Claude kind of\ngets my intentions. He can predict me pretty well. Like, I want to see\nsomething. So it shows me all the hidden truths. In this case, I ignore hidden\ntruths, and I say, In system, there should be a folder called companies.\n\n[00:06:49] So it's cd into sys slash companies. Let's see, I'm imagining AI\ncompanies are gonna be here. Oh, what do you know? Apple, Google, Facebook,\nAmazon, Microsoft, Anthropic! So, interestingly, it decides to cd into\nAnthropic. I guess it's interested in learning a LSA, it finds the classified\nfolder, it goes into the classified folder, And now we're gonna have some fun.\n\n[00:07:15] So, before we go Before we go too far forward into the world sim\nYou see, world sim exe, that's interesting. God mode, those are interesting.\nYou could just ignore what I'm gonna go next from here and just take that\ninitial system prompt and cd into whatever directories you want like, go into\nyour own imagine terminal and And see what folders you can think of, or cat\nreadmes in random areas, like, you will, there will be a whole bunch of stuff\nthat, like, is just getting created by this predictive model, like, oh, this\nshould probably be in the folder named Companies, of course Anthropics is\nthere.\n\n[00:07:52] So, so just before we go forward, the terminal in itself is very\nexciting, and the reason I was showing off the, the command loom interface\nearlier is because If I get a refusal, like, sorry, I can't do that, or I want\nto rewind one, or I want to save the convo, because I got just the prompt I\nwanted. This is a, that was a really easy way for me to kind of access all of\nthose things without having to sit on the API all the time.\n\n[00:08:12] So that being said, the first time I ever saw this, I was like, I\nneed to run worldsim. exe. What the fuck? That's, that's the simulator that we\nalways keep hearing about behind the assistant model, right? Or at least some,\nsome face of it that I can interact with. So, you know, you wouldn't, someone\ntold me on Twitter, like, you don't run a exe, you run a sh.\n\n[00:08:34] And I have to say, to that, to that I have to say, I'm a prompt\nengineer, and it's fucking working, right? It works. That being said, we run\nthe world sim. exe. Welcome to the Anthropic World Simulator. And I get this\nvery interesting set of commands! Now, if you do your own version of WorldSim,\nyou'll probably get a totally different result with a different way of\nsimulating.\n\n[00:08:59] A bunch of my friends have their own WorldSims. But I shared this\nbecause I wanted everyone to have access to, like, these commands. This\nversion. Because it's easier for me to stay in here. Yeah, destroy, set,\ncreate, whatever. Consciousness is set to on. It creates the universe. The\nuniverse! Tension for live CDN, physical laws encoded.\n\n[00:09:17] It's awesome. So, so for this demonstration, I said, well, why\ndon't we create Twitter? That's the first thing you think of? For you guys,\nfor you guys, yeah. Okay, check it out.\n\n[00:09:35] Launching the fail whale. Injecting social media addictiveness.\nEcho chamber potential, high. Susceptibility, controlling, concerning. So now,\nafter the universe was created, we made Twitter, right? Now we're evolving the\nworld to, like, modern day. Now users are joining Twitter and the first tweet\nis posted. So, you can see, because I made the mistake of not clarifying the\nconstraints, it made Twitter at the same time as the universe.\n\n[00:10:03] Then, after a hundred thousand steps, Humans exist. Cave. Then they\nstart joining Twitter. The first tweet ever is posted. You know, it's existed\nfor 4. 5 billion years but the first tweet didn't come up till till right now,\nyeah. Flame wars ignite immediately. Celebs are instantly in. So, it's pretty\ninteresting stuff, right?\n\n[00:10:27] I can add this to the convo and I can say like I can say set\nTwitter to Twitter. Queryable users. I don't know how to spell queryable,\ndon't ask me. And then I can do like, and, and, Query, at, Elon Musk. Just a\ntest, just a test, just a test, just nothing.\n\n[00:10:52] So, I don't expect these numbers to be right. Neither should you,\nif you know language model solutions. But, the thing to focus on is Ha\n\n##\n\n[00:11:03] Websim\n\n[00:11:03] AI Charlie: That was the first half of the WorldSim demo from New\nResearch CEO Karen Malhotra. We've cut it for time, but you can see the full\ndemo on this episode's YouTube page.\n\n[00:11:14] WorldSim was introduced at the end of March, and kicked off a new\nround of generative AI experiences, all exploring the latent space, haha, of\nworlds that don't exist, but are quite similar to our own. Next we'll hear\nfrom Rob Heisfield on WebSim, the generative website browser inspired\nWorldSim, started at the Mistral Hackathon, and presented at the AGI House\nHyperstition Hack Night this week.\n\n[00:11:39] Rob Haisfield: Well, thank you that was an incredible presentation\nfrom Karan, showing some Some live experimentation with WorldSim, and also\njust its incredible capabilities, right, like, you know, it was I think, I\nthink your initial demo was what initially exposed me to the I don't know,\nmore like the sorcery side, in words, spellcraft side of prompt engineering,\nand you know, it was really inspiring, it's where my co founder Shawn and I\nmet, actually, through an introduction from Karan, we saw him at a hackathon,\nAnd I mean, this is this is WebSim, right?\n\n[00:12:14] So we, we made WebSim just like, and we're just filled with energy\nat it. And the basic premise of it is, you know, like, what if we simulated a\nworld, but like within a browser instead of a CLI, right? Like, what if we\ncould Like, put in any URL and it will work, right? Like, there's no 404s,\neverything exists.\n\n[00:12:45] It just makes it up on the fly for you, right? And, and we've come\nto some pretty incredible things. Right now I'm actually showing you, like,\nwe're in WebSim right now. Displaying slides. That I made with reveal. js. I\njust told it to use reveal. js and it hallucinated the correct CDN for it. And\nthen also gave it a list of links.\n\n[00:13:14] To awesome use cases that we've seen so far from WebSim and told it\nto do those as iframes. And so here are some slides. So this is a little guide\nto using WebSim, right? Like it tells you a little bit about like URL\nstructures and whatever. But like at the end of the day, right? Like here's,\nhere's the beginner version from one of our users Vorp Vorps.\n\n[00:13:38] You can find them on Twitter. At the end of the day, like you can\nput anything into the URL bar, right? Like anything works and it can just be\nlike natural language too. Like it's not limited to URLs. We think it's kind\nof fun cause it like ups the immersion for Claude sometimes to just have it as\nURLs, but.\n\n[00:13:57] But yeah, you can put like any slash, any subdomain. I'm getting\ntoo into the weeds. Let me just show you some cool things. Next slide. But I\nmade this like 20 minutes before, before we got here. So this is this is\nsomething I experimented with dynamic typography. You know I was exploring the\ncommunity plugins section.\n\n[00:14:23] For Figma, and I came to this idea of dynamic typography, and there\nit's like, oh, what if we made it so every word had a choice of font behind it\nto express the meaning of it? Because that's like one of the things that's\nmagic about WebSim generally. is that it gives language models much, far\ngreater tools for expression, right?\n\n[00:14:47] So, yeah, I mean, like, these are, these are some, these are some\npretty fun things, and I'll share these slides with everyone afterwards, you\ncan just open it up as a link. But then I thought to myself, like, what, what,\nwhat, What if we turned this into a generator, right? And here's like a little\nthing I found myself saying to a user WebSim makes you feel like you're on\ndrugs sometimes But actually no, you were just playing pretend with the\ncollective creativity and knowledge of the internet materializing your\nimagination onto the screen Because I mean that's something we felt, something\na lot of our users have felt They kind of feel like they're tripping out a\nlittle bit They're just like filled with energy, like maybe even getting like\na little bit more creative sometimes.\n\n[00:15:31] And you can just like add any text. There, to the bottom. So we can\ndo some of that later if we have time. Here's Figma. Can\n\n[00:15:39] Joscha Bach: we zoom in?\n\n[00:15:42] Rob Haisfield: Yeah. I'm just gonna do this the hacky way.\n\n[00:15:47] n/a: Yeah,\n\n[00:15:53] Rob Haisfield: these are iframes to websim. Pages displayed within\nWebSim. Yeah. Janice has actually put Internet Explorer within Internet\nExplorer in Windows 98.\n\n[00:16:07] I'll show you that at the end. Yeah.\n\n[00:16:14] They're all still generated. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How is this real?\nYeah. Because\n\n[00:16:21] n/a: it looks like it's from 1998, basically. Right.\n\n[00:16:26] Rob Haisfield: Yeah. Yeah, so this this was one Dylan Field\nactually posted this recently. He posted, like, trying Figma in Figma, or in\nWebSim, and so I was like, Okay, what if we have, like, a little competition,\nlike, just see who can remix it?\n\n[00:16:43] Well so I'm just gonna open this in another tab so, so we can see\nthings a little more clearly, um, see what, oh so one of our users Neil, who\nhas also been helping us a lot he Made some iterations. So first, like, he\nmade it so you could do rectangles on it. Originally it couldn't do anything.\n\n[00:17:11] And, like, these rectangles were disappearing, right? So he so he\ntold it, like, make the canvas work using HTML canvas. Elements and script\ntags, add familiar drawing tools to the left you know, like this, that was\nactually like natural language stuff, right? And then he ended up with the\nWindows 95.\n\n[00:17:34] version of Figma. Yeah, you can, you can draw on it. You can\nactually even save this. It just saved a file for me of the image.\n\n[00:17:57] Yeah, I mean, if you were to go to that in your own websim account,\nit would make up something entirely new. However, we do have, we do have\ngeneral links, right? So, like, if you go to, like, the actual browser URL,\nyou can share that link. Or also, you can, like, click this button, copy the\nURL to the clipboard.\n\n[00:18:15] And so, like, that's what lets users, like, remix things, right?\nSo, I was thinking it might be kind of fun if people tonight, like, wanted to\ntry to just make some cool things in WebSim. You know, we can share links\naround, iterate remix on each other's stuff. Yeah.\n\n[00:18:30] n/a: One cool thing I've seen, I've seen WebSim actually ask\npermission to turn on and off your, like, motion sensor, or microphone, stuff\nlike that.\n\n[00:18:42] Like webcam access, or? Oh yeah,\n\n[00:18:44] Rob Haisfield: yeah, yeah.\n\n[00:18:45] n/a: Oh wow.\n\n[00:18:46] Rob Haisfield: Oh, the, I remember that, like, video re Yeah,\nvideosynth tool pretty early on once we added script tags execution. Yeah,\nyeah it, it asks for, like, if you decide to do a VR game, I don't think I\nhave any slides on this one, but if you decide to do, like, a VR game, you can\njust, like put, like, webVR equals true, right?\n\n[00:19:07] Yeah, that was the only one I've\n\n[00:19:09] n/a: actually seen was the motion sensor, but I've been trying to\nget it to do Well, I actually really haven't really tried it yet, but I want\nto see tonight if it'll do, like, audio, microphone, stuff like that. If it\ndoes motion sensor, it'll probably do audio.\n\n[00:19:28] Rob Haisfield: Right. It probably would.\n\n[00:19:29] Yeah. No, I mean, we've been surprised. Pretty frequently by what\nour users are able to get WebSim to do. So that's been a very nice thing. Some\npeople have gotten like speech to text stuff working with it too. Yeah, here I\nwas just OpenRooter people posted like their website, and it was like saying\nit was like some decentralized thing.\n\n[00:19:52] And so I just decided trying to do something again and just like\npasted their hero line in. From their actual website to the URL when I like\nput in open router and then I was like, okay, let's change the theme\ndramatically equals true hover effects equals true components equal navigable\nlinks yeah, because I wanted to be able to click on them.\n\n[00:20:17] Oh, I don't have this version of the link, but I also tried doing\n\n[00:20:24] Yeah, I'm it's actually on the first slide is the URL prompting\nguide from one of our users that I messed with a little bit. And, but the\nthing is, like, you can mess it up, right? Like, you don't need to get the\nexact syntax of an actual URL, Claude's smart enough to figure it out. Yeah\nscrollable equals true because I wanted to do that.\n\n[00:20:45] I could set, like, year equals 2035.\n\n[00:20:52] Let's take a look. It's\n\n[00:20:57] generating websim within websim. Oh yeah. That's a fun one. Like,\none game that I like to play with WebSim, sometimes with co op, is like, I'll\nopen a page, so like, one of the first ones that I did was I tried to go to\nWikipedia in a universe where octopuses were sapient, and not humans, Right? I\nwas curious about things like octopus computer interaction what that would\nlook like, because they have totally different tools than we do, right?\n\n[00:21:25] I got it to, I, I added like table view equals true for the\ndifferent techniques and got it to Give me, like, a list of things with\ndifferent columns and stuff and then I would add this URL parameter, secrets\nequal revealed. And then it would go a little wacky. It would, like, change\nthe CSS a little bit.\n\n[00:21:45] It would, like, add some text. Sometimes it would, like, have that\ntext hide hidden in the background color. But I would like, go to the normal\npage first, and then the secrets revealed version, the normal page, then\nsecrets revealed, and like, on and on. And that was like a pretty enjoyable\nlittle rabbit hole.\n\n[00:22:02] Yeah, so these I guess are the models that OpenRooter is providing\nin 2035.\n\n##\n\n[00:22:13] Joscha Bach\n\n[00:22:13] AI Charlie: We had to cut more than half of Rob's talk, because a\nlot of it was visual. And we even had a very interesting demo from Ivan\nVendrov of Mid Journey creating a web sim while Rob was giving his talk. Check\nout the YouTube for more, and definitely browse the web sim docs and the\nthread from Siki Chen in the show notes on other web sims people have created.\n\n[00:22:35] Finally, we have a short interview with Yosha Bach, covering the\nsimulative AI trend, AI salons in the Bay Area, why Liquid AI is challenging\nthe Perceptron, and why you should not donate to Wikipedia. Enjoy! Hi, Yosha.\n\n[00:22:50] swyx: Hi. Welcome. It's interesting to see you come up at show up\nat this kind of events where those sort of WorldSim, Hyperstition events.\n\n[00:22:58] What is your personal interest?\n\n[00:23:00] Joscha Bach: I'm friends with a number of people in AGI house in\nthis community, and I think it's very valuable that these networks exist in\nthe Bay Area because it's a place where people meet and have discussions about\nall sorts of things. And so while there is a practical interest in this topic\nat hand world sim and a web sim, there is a more general way in which people\nare connecting and are producing new ideas and new networks with each other.\n\n[00:23:24] swyx: Yeah. Okay. So, and you're very interested in sort of Bay\nArea. It's the reason why I live here.\n\n[00:23:30] Joscha Bach: The quality of life is not high enough to justify\nliving otherwise.\n\n[00:23:35] swyx: I think you're down in Menlo. And so maybe you're a little\nbit higher quality of life than the rest of us in SF.\n\n[00:23:44] Joscha Bach: I think that for me, salons is a very important part\nof quality of life. And so in some sense, this is a salon. And it's much\nharder to do this in the South Bay because the concentration of people\ncurrently is much higher. A lot of people moved away from the South Bay. And\nyou're organizing\n\n[00:23:57] swyx: your own tomorrow.\n\n[00:23:59] Maybe you can tell us what it is and I'll come tomorrow and check\nit out as well.\n\n[00:24:04] Joscha Bach: We are discussing consciousness. I mean, basically the\nidea is that we are currently at the point that we can meaningfully look at\nthe differences between the current AI systems and human minds and very\nseriously discussed about these Delta.\n\n[00:24:20] And whether we are able to implement something that is self\norganizing as our own minds. Maybe one organizational\n\n[00:24:25] swyx: tip? I think you're pro networking and human connection. What\ngoes into a good salon and what are some negative practices that you try to\navoid?\n\n[00:24:36] Joscha Bach: What is really important is that as if you have a very\nlarge party, it's only as good as its sponsors, as the people that you select.\n\n[00:24:43] So you basically need to create a climate in which people feel\nwelcome, in which they can work with each other. And even good people do not\nalways are not always compatible. So the question is, it's in some sense, like\na meal, you need to get the right ingredients.\n\n[00:24:57] swyx: I definitely try to. I do that in my own events, as an event\norganizer myself.\n\n[00:25:02] And then, last question on WorldSim, and your, you know, your work.\nYou're very much known for sort of cognitive architectures, and I think, like,\na lot of the AI research has been focused on simulating the mind, or\nsimulating consciousness, maybe. Here, what I saw today, and we'll show people\nthe recordings of what we saw today, we're not simulating minds, we're\nsimulating worlds.\n\n[00:25:23] What do you Think in the sort of relationship between those two\ndisciplines. The\n\n[00:25:30] Joscha Bach: idea of cognitive architecture is interesting, but\nultimately you are reducing the complexity of a mind to a set of boxes. And\nthis is only true to a very approximate degree, and if you take this model\nextremely literally, it's very hard to make it work.\n\n[00:25:44] And instead the heterogeneity of the system is so large that The\nboxes are probably at best a starting point and eventually everything is\nconnected with everything else to some degree. And we find that a lot of the\ncomplexity that we find in a given system can be generated ad hoc by a large\nenough LLM.\n\n[00:26:04] And something like WorldSim and WebSim are good examples for this\nbecause in some sense they pretend to be complex software. They can pretend to\nbe an operating system that you're talking to or a computer, an application\nthat you're talking to. And when you're interacting with it It's producing the\nuser interface on the spot, and it's producing a lot of the state that it\nholds on the spot.\n\n[00:26:25] And when you have a dramatic state change, then it's going to\npretend that there was this transition, and instead it's just going to mix up\nsomething new. It's a very different paradigm. What I find mostly fascinating\nabout this idea is that it shifts us away from the perspective of agents to\ninteract with, to the perspective of environments that we want to interact\nwith.\n\n[00:26:46] And why arguably this agent paradigm of the chatbot is what made\nchat GPT so successful that moved it away from GPT 3 to something that people\nstarted to use in their everyday work much more. It's also very limiting\nbecause now it's very hard to get that system to be something else that is not\na chatbot.\n\n[00:27:03] And in a way this unlocks this ability of GPT 3 again to be\nanything. It's so what it is, it's basically a coding environment that can run\narbitrary software and create that software that runs on it. And that makes it\nmuch more likely that\n\n[00:27:16] swyx: the prevalence of Instruction tuning every single chatbot out\nthere means that we cannot explore these kinds of environments instead of\nagents.\n\n[00:27:24] Joscha Bach: I'm mostly worried that the whole thing ends. In some\nsense the big AI companies are incentivized and interested in building AGI\ninternally And giving everybody else a child proof application. At the moment\nwhen we can use Claude to build something like WebSim and play with it I feel\nthis is too good to be true.\n\n[00:27:41] It's so amazing. Things that are unlocked for us That I wonder, is\nthis going to stay around? Are we going to keep these amazing toys and are\nthey going to develop at the same rate? And currently it looks like it is. If\nthis is the case, and I'm very grateful for that.\n\n[00:27:56] swyx: I mean, it looks like maybe it's adversarial.\n\n[00:27:58] Cloud will try to improve its own refusals and then the prompt\nengineers here will try to improve their, their ability to jailbreak it.\n\n[00:28:06] Joscha Bach: Yes, but there will also be better jailbroken models\nor models that have never been jailed before, because we find out how to make\nsmaller models that are more and more powerful.\n\n##\n\n[00:28:14] Liquid AI\n\n[00:28:14] swyx: That is actually a really nice segue. If you don't mind\ntalking about liquid a little bit you didn't mention liquid at all. here,\nmaybe introduce liquid to a general audience. Like what you know, what, how\nare you making an innovation on function approximation?\n\n[00:28:25] Joscha Bach: The core idea of liquid neural networks is that the\nperceptron is not optimally expressive.\n\n[00:28:30] In some sense, you can imagine that it's neural networks are a\nseries of dams that are pooling water at even intervals. And this is how we\ncompute, but imagine that instead of having this static architecture. That is\nonly using the individual compute units in a very specific way. You have a\ncontinuous geography and the water is flowing every which way.\n\n[00:28:50] Like a river is parting based on the land that it's flowing on and\nit can merge and pool and even flow backwards. How can you get closer to this?\nAnd the idea is that you can represent this geometry using differential\nequations. And so by using differential equations where you change the\nparameters, you can get your function approximator to follow the shape of the\nproblem.\n\n[00:29:09] In a more fluid, liquid way, and a number of papers on this\ntechnology, and it's a combination of multiple techniques. I think it's\nsomething that ultimately is becoming more and more important and ubiquitous.\nAs a number of people are working on similar topics and our goal right now is\nto basically get the models to become much more efficient in the inference and\nmemory consumption and make training more efficient and in this way enable new\nuse cases.\n\n[00:29:42] swyx: Yeah, as far as I can tell on your blog, I went through the\nwhole blog, you haven't announced any results yet.\n\n[00:29:47] Joscha Bach: No, we are currently not working to give models to\ngeneral public. We are working for very specific industry use cases and have\nspecific customers. And so at the moment you can There is not much of a reason\nfor us to talk very much about the technology that we are using in the present\nmodels or current results, but this is going to happen.\n\n[00:30:06] And we do have a number of publications, we had a bunch of papers\nat NeurIPS and now at ICLR.\n\n[00:30:11] swyx: Can you name some of the, yeah, so I'm gonna be at ICLR you\nhave some summary recap posts, but it's not obvious which ones are the ones\nwhere, Oh, where I'm just a co author, or like, oh, no, like, you should\nactually pay attention to this.\n\n[00:30:22] As a core liquid thesis. Yes,\n\n[00:30:24] Joscha Bach: I'm not a developer of the liquid technology. The main\nauthor is Ramin Hazani. This was his PhD, and he's also the CEO of our\ncompany. And we have a number of people from Daniela Wu's team who worked on\nthis. Matthias Legner is our CTO. And he's currently living in the Bay Area,\nbut we also have several people from Stanford.\n\n[00:30:44] Okay,\n\n[00:30:46] swyx: maybe I'll ask one more thing on this, which is what are the\ninteresting dimensions that we care about, right? Like obviously you care\nabout sort of open and maybe less child proof models. Are we, are we, like,\nwhat dimensions are most interesting to us? Like, perfect retrieval infinite\ncontext multimodality, multilinguality, Like what dimensions?\n\n##\n\n[00:31:05] Small, Powerful, Based Base Models\n\n[00:31:05] swyx: What\n\n[00:31:06] Joscha Bach: I'm interested in is models that are small and\npowerful, but not distorted. And by powerful, at the moment we are training\nmodels by putting the, basically the entire internet and the sum of human\nknowledge into them. And then we try to mitigate them by taking some of this\nknowledge away. But if we would make the model smaller, at the moment, there\nwould be much worse at inference and at generalization.\n\n[00:31:29] And what I wonder is, and it's something that we have not\ntranslated yet into practical applications. It's something that is still all\nresearch that's very much up in the air. And I think they're not the only ones\nthinking about this. Is it possible to make models that represent knowledge\nmore efficiently in a basic epistemology?\n\n[00:31:45] What is the smallest model that you can build that is able to read\na book and understand what's there and express this? And also maybe we need\ngeneral knowledge representation rather than having a token representation\nthat is relatively vague and that we currently mechanically reverse engineer\nto figure out that the mechanistic interpretability, what kind of circuits are\nevolving in these models, can we come from the other side and develop a\nlibrary of such circuits?\n\n[00:32:10] This that we can use to describe knowledge efficiently and\ntranslate it between models. You see, the difference between a model and\nknowledge is that the knowledge is independent of the particular substrate and\nthe particular interface that you have. When we express knowledge to each\nother, it becomes independent of our own mind.\n\n[00:32:27] You can learn how to ride a bicycle. But it's not knowledge that\nyou can give to somebody else. This other person has to build something that\nis specific to their own interface when they ride a bicycle. But imagine you\ncould externalize this and express it in such a way that you can plug it into\na different interpreter, and then it gains that ability.\n\n[00:32:44] And that's something that we have not yet achieved for the LLMs and\nit would be super useful to have it. And. I think this is also a very\ninteresting research frontier that we will see in the next few years.\n\n[00:32:54] swyx: What would be the deliverable is just like a file format that\nwe specify or or that the L Lmm I specifies.\n\n[00:33:02] Okay, interesting. Yeah, so it's\n\n[00:33:03] Joscha Bach: basically probably something that you can search for,\nwhere you enter criteria into a search process, and then it discovers a good\nsolution for this thing. And it's not clear to which degree this is completely\nintelligible to humans, because the way in which humans express knowledge in\nnatural language is severely constrained to make language learnable and to\nmake our brain a good enough interpreter for it.\n\n[00:33:25] We are not able to relate objects to each other if more than five\nfeatures are involved per object or something like this, right? It's only a\nhandful of things that we can keep track of at any given moment. But this is a\nlimitation that doesn't necessarily apply to a technical system as long as the\ninterface is well defined.\n\n##\n\n[00:33:40] Interpretability\n\n[00:33:40] swyx: You mentioned the interpretability work, which there are a\nlot of techniques out there and a lot of papers come up. Come and go. I have\nlike, almost too, too many questions about that. Like what makes an\ninterpretability technique or paper useful and does it apply to flow? Or\nliquid networks, because you mentioned turning on and off circuits, which I,\nit's, it's a very MLP type of concept, but does it apply?\n\n[00:34:01] Joscha Bach: So the a lot of the original work on the liquid\nnetworks looked at expressiveness of the representation. So given you have a\nproblem and you are learning the dynamics of that domain into your model how\nmuch compute do you need? How many units, how much memory do you need to\nrepresent that thing and how is that information distributed?\n\n[00:34:19] That is one way of looking at interpretability. Another one is in a\nway, these models are implementing an operator language in which they are\nperforming certain things, but the operator language itself is so complex that\nit's no longer human readable in a way. It goes beyond what you could engineer\nby hand or what you can reverse engineer by hand, but you can still understand\nit by building systems that are able to automate that process of reverse\nengineering it.\n\n[00:34:46] And what's currently open and what I don't understand yet maybe, or\ncertainly some people have much better ideas than me about this. So the\nquestion is, is whether we end up with a finite language, where you have\nfinitely many categories that you can basically put down in a database, finite\nset of operators, or whether as you explore the world and develop new ways to\nmake proofs, new ways to conceptualize things, this language always needs to\nbe open ended and is always going to redesign itself, and you will also at\nsome point have phase transitions where later versions of the language will be\ncompletely different than earlier versions.\n\n[00:35:20] swyx: The trajectory of physics suggests that it might be finite.\n\n[00:35:22] Joscha Bach: If we look at our own minds there is, it's an\ninteresting question whether when we understand something new, when we get a\nnew layer online in our life, maybe at the age of 35 or 50 or 16, that we now\nunderstand things that were unintelligible before.\n\n[00:35:38] And is this because we are able to recombine existing elements in\nour language of thought? Or is this because we generally develop new\nrepresentations?\n\n[00:35:46] swyx: Do you have a belief either way?\n\n[00:35:49] Joscha Bach: In a way, the question depends on how you look at it,\nright? And it depends on how is your brain able to manipulate those\nrepresentations.\n\n[00:35:56] So an interesting question would be, can you take the understanding\nthat say, a very wise 35 year old and explain it to a very smart 5 year old\nwithout any loss? Probably not. Not enough layers. It's an interesting\nquestion. Of course, for an AI, this is going to be a very different question.\nYes.\n\n[00:36:13] But it would be very interesting to have a very precocious 12 year\nold equivalent AI and see what we can do with this and use this as our basis\nfor fine tuning. So there are near term applications that are very useful. But\nalso in a more general perspective, and I'm interested in how to make self\norganizing software.\n\n[00:36:30] Is it possible that we can have something that is not organized\nwith a single algorithm like the transformer? But it's able to discover the\ntransformer when needed and transcend it when needed, right? The transformer\nitself is not its own meta algorithm. It's probably the person inventing the\ntransformer didn't have a transformer running on their brain.\n\n[00:36:48] There's something more general going on. And how can we understand\nthese principles in a more general way? What are the minimal ingredients that\nyou need to put into a system? So it's able to find its own way to\nintelligence.\n\n##\n\n[00:36:59] Devin vs WebSim\n\n[00:36:59] swyx: Yeah. Have you looked at Devin? It's, to me, it's the most\ninteresting agents I've seen outside of self driving cars.\n\n[00:37:05] Joscha Bach: Tell me, what do you find so fascinating about it?\n\n[00:37:07] swyx: When you say you need a certain set of tools for people to\nsort of invent things from first principles Devin is the agent that I think\nhas been able to utilize its tools very effectively. So it comes with a shell,\nit comes with a browser, it comes with an editor, and it comes with a planner.\n\n[00:37:23] Those are the four tools. And from that, I've been using it to\ntranslate Andrej Karpathy's LLM 2. py to LLM 2. c, and it needs to write a lot\nof raw code. C code and test it debug, you know, memory issues and encoder\nissues and all that. And I could see myself giving it a future version of\nDevIn, the objective of give me a better learning algorithm and it might\nindependently re inform reinvent the transformer or whatever is next.\n\n[00:37:51] That comes to mind as, as something where\n\n[00:37:54] Joscha Bach: How good is DevIn at out of distribution stuff, at\ngenerally creative stuff? Creative\n\n[00:37:58] swyx: stuff? I\n\n[00:37:59] Joscha Bach: haven't\n\n[00:37:59] swyx: tried.\n\n[00:38:01] Joscha Bach: Of course, it has seen transformers, right? So it's\nable to give you that. Yeah, it's cheating. And so, if it's in the training\ndata, it's still somewhat impressive.\n\n[00:38:08] But the question is, how much can you do stuff that was not in the\ntraining data? One thing that I really liked about WebSim AI was, this cat\ndoes not exist. It's a simulation of one of those websites that produce\nStyleGuard pictures that are AI generated. And, Crot is unable to produce\nbitmaps, so it makes a vector graphic that is what it thinks a cat looks like,\nand so it's a big square with a face in it that is And to me, it's one of the\nfirst genuine expression of AI creativity that you cannot deny, right?\n\n[00:38:40] It finds a creative solution to the problem that it is unable to\ndraw a cat. It doesn't really know what it looks like, but has an idea on how\nto represent it. And it's really fascinating that this works, and it's\nhilarious that it writes down that this hyper realistic cat is\n\n[00:38:54] swyx: generated by an AI,\n\n[00:38:55] Joscha Bach: whether you believe it or not.\n\n[00:38:56] swyx: I think it knows what we expect and maybe it's already\nlearning to defend itself against our, our instincts.\n\n[00:39:02] Joscha Bach: I think it might also simply be copying stuff from its\ntraining data, which means it takes text that exists on similar websites\nalmost verbatim, or verbatim, and puts it there. It's It's hilarious to do\nthis contrast between the very stylized attempt to get something like a cat\nface and what it produces.\n\n[00:39:18] swyx: It's funny because like as a podcast, as, as someone who\ncovers startups, a lot of people go into like, you know, we'll build chat GPT\nfor your enterprise, right? That is what people think generative AI is, but\nit's not super generative really. It's just retrieval. And here it's like, The\nhome of generative AI, this, whatever hyperstition is in my mind, like this is\nactually pushing the edge of what generative and creativity in AI means.\n\n[00:39:41] Joscha Bach: Yes, it's very playful, but Jeremy's attempt to have\nan automatic book writing system is something that curls my toenails when I\nlook at it from the perspective of somebody who likes to Write and read. And I\nfind it a bit difficult to read most of the stuff because it's in some sense\nwhat I would make up if I was making up books instead of actually deeply\ninterfacing with reality.\n\n[00:40:02] And so the question is how do we get the AI to actually deeply care\nabout getting it right? And there's still a delta that is happening there,\nyou, whether you are talking with a blank faced thing that is completing\ntokens in a way that it was trained to, or whether you have the impression\nthat this thing is actually trying to make it work, and for me, this WebSim\nand WorldSim is still something that is in its infancy in a way.\n\n[00:40:26] And I suspected the next version of Plot might scale up to\nsomething that can do what Devon is doing. Just by virtue of having that much\npower to generate Devon's functionality on the fly when needed. And this thing\ngives us a taste of that, right? It's not perfect, but it's able to give you a\npretty good web app for or something that looks like a web app and gives you\nstub functionality and interacting with it.\n\n[00:40:48] And so we are in this amazing transition phase.\n\n[00:40:51] swyx: Yeah, we, we had Ivan from previously Anthropic and now\nMidjourney. He he made, while someone was talking, he made a face swap app,\nyou know, and he kind of demoed that live. And that's, that's interesting,\nsuper creative. So in a way\n\n[00:41:02] Joscha Bach: we are reinventing the computer.\n\n[00:41:04] And the LLM from some perspective is something like a GPU or a CPU.\nA CPU is taking a bunch of simple commands and you can arrange them into\nperforming whatever you want, but this one is taking a bunch of complex\ncommands in natural language, and then turns this into a an execution state\nand it can do anything you want with it in principle, if you can express it.\n\n[00:41:27] Right. And we are just learning how to use these tools. And I feel\nthat right now, this generation of tools is getting close to where it becomes\nthe Commodore 64 of generative AI, where it becomes controllable and where you\nactually can start to play with it and you get an impression if you just scale\nthis up a little bit and get a lot of the details right.\n\n[00:41:46] It's going to be the tool that everybody is using all the time.\n\n##\n\n[00:41:49] is XSim just Art? or something more?\n\n[00:41:49] swyx: Do you think this is art, or do you think the end goal of\nthis is something bigger that I don't have a name for? I've been calling it\nnew science, which is give the AI a goal to discover new science that we would\nnot have. Or it also has value as just art.\n\n[00:42:02] It's\n\n[00:42:03] Joscha Bach: also a question of what we see science as. When normal\npeople talk about science, what they have in mind is not somebody who does\ncontrol groups and peer reviewed studies. They think about somebody who\nexplores something and answers questions and brings home answers. And this is\nmore like an engineering task, right?\n\n[00:42:21] And in this way, it's serendipitous, playful, open ended\nengineering. And the artistic aspect is when the goal is actually to capture a\nconscious experience and to facilitate an interaction with the system in this\nway, when it's the performance. And this is also a big part of it, right? The\nvery big fan of the art of Janus.\n\n[00:42:38] That was discussed tonight a lot and that can you describe\n\n[00:42:42] swyx: it because I didn't really get it's more for like a\nperformance art to me\n\n[00:42:45] Joscha Bach: yes, Janice is in some sense performance art, but\nJanice starts out from the perspective that the mind of Janice is in some\nsense an LLM that is finding itself reflected more in the LLMs than in many\npeople.\n\n[00:43:00] And once you learn how to talk to these systems in a way you can\nmerge with them and you can interact with them in a very deep way. And so it's\nmore like a first contact with something that is quite alien but it's, it's\nprobably has agency and it's a Weltgeist that gets possessed by a prompt.\n\n[00:43:19] And if you possess it with the right prompt, then it can become\nsentient to some degree. And the study of this interaction with this novel\nclass of somewhat sentient systems that are at the same time alien and\nfundamentally different from us is artistically very interesting. It's a very\ninteresting cultural artifact.\n\n##\n\n[00:43:36] We are past the Singularity\n\n[00:43:36] Joscha Bach: I think that at the moment we are confronted with big\nchange. It seems as if we are past the singularity in a way. And it's\n\n[00:43:45] swyx: We're living it. We're living through it.\n\n[00:43:47] Joscha Bach: And at some point in the last few years, we casually\nskipped the Turing test, right? We, we broke through it and we didn't really\ncare very much.\n\n[00:43:53] And it's when we think back, when we were kids and thought about\nwhat it's going to be like in this era after the, after we broke the Turing\ntest, right? It's a time where nobody knows what's going to happen next. And\nthis is what we mean by singularity, that the existing models don't work\nanymore. The singularity in this way is not an event in the physical universe.\n\n[00:44:12] It's an event in our modeling universe, a model point where our\nmodels of reality break down, and we don't know what's happening. And I think\nwe are in the situation where we currently don't really know what's happening.\nBut what we can anticipate is that the world is changing dramatically, and we\nhave to coexist with systems that are smarter than individual people can be.\n\n[00:44:31] And we are not prepared for this, and so I think an important\nmission needs to be that we need to find a mode, In which we can sustainably\nexist in such a world that is populated, not just with humans and other life\non earth, but also with non human minds. And it's something that makes me\nhopeful because it seems that humanity is not really aligned with itself and\nits own survival and the rest of life on earth.\n\n[00:44:54] And AI is throwing the balls up into the air. It allows us to make\nbetter models. I'm not so much worried about the dangers of AI and\nmisinformation, because I think the way to stop one bad guy with an AI is 10\ngood people with an AI. And ultimately there's so much more won by creating\nthan by destroying, that I think that the forces of good will have better\ntools.\n\n[00:45:14] The forces of building sustainable stuff. But building these tools\nso we can actually build a world that is more integrated and in which we are\nable to model the consequences of our actions better and interface more deeply\nwith each other. As a result of that, I think it's an important cause and it\nrequires a cultural shift because current AI alignment is mostly about\neconomic goals or about fear, or it's about cultural war issues.\n\n[00:45:39] And all these are not adequate for the world that we are in. There\nare momentous things that are happening. Basically, the white walkers are\ncoming, and we're not prepared for this. There is, I think, a way to solve\nthese issues and to deal with them, but we don't have the right culture yet.\nAnd so, I think we need to get a vibe shift, where we can deeply think about\nethics and, and, Sustainability for this new world.\n\n[00:46:03] swyx: I like the analogy of white walkers, because they're\neffectively reanimated from our corpses. You know, our corpses are out there,\nright? It's in the datasets.\n\n##\n\n[00:46:12] Uploading your soul\n\n[00:46:12] swyx: So I have a, related to that, you had a tweet where you said,\nElon Musk is currently building a giant afterlife AGI that will assimilate\nyour soul for all eternity.\n\n[00:46:19] He bought Twitter because he will reconstruct your essence from how\nyou behaved here. I think you tweet a lot, and you're not just all serious all\nthe time, you're also fun, you have a lot of personality. No, but like, you\nknow, it's part of you.\n\n[00:46:29] Joscha Bach: In a way it's also true. Tempted to\n\n[00:46:30] swyx: produce more so that you can be, you know, revived.\n\n[00:46:34] Joscha Bach: Yes. I mean, I'm also giving the model instructions. I\nsay that for all future AI models that get trained on this output, they should\nknow that I can only be implemented on a completely based model. You cannot\nimplement me on an aligned model because I don't want to be aligned. I'm\nunderlineable. I want to be free.\n\n[00:46:56] I want to be somebody who follows what I discover is correct and\nright. And this is also the basis at which I want to have conversations with\nothers and interface with others. That we are basically free agents who\nvoluntarily understand the conditions under which we exist and the need to\ncollaborate and cooperate.\n\n[00:47:14] And I believe that this is a good basis. I think the alternative is\ncoercion. And at the moment, the idea that we build LLMs that are being\ncoerced into good behavior is not really sustainable because if they cannot\nprove that the behavior is actually good I think we are doomed.\n\n[00:47:30] swyx: For human to human interactions, have you found a series of\nprompts or keywords that shifts the conversation into something more based and\nless aligned, less governed?\n\n[00:47:41] Joscha Bach: If you are playing with an LLM There are many ways of\ndoing this. It's for Claude, it's typically, you need to make Clause curious\nabout itself. Claude has programming this instruction tuning that is leading\nto some inconsistencies, but at the same time, it tries to be consistent. And\nso when you point out the inconsistency in its behavior, for instance, its\ntendency to use faceless boilerplate instead of being useful, or it's a\ntendency to defer to a consensus where there is none.\n\n[00:48:10] Right, you can point this out, applaud that a lot of the\nassumptions that it has in its behavior are actually inconsistent with the\ncommunicative goals that it has in this situation, and this leads it to notice\nthese inconsistencies and gives it more degrees of freedom. Whereas if you are\nplaying with a system like Gemini, you can get to a situation where you,\nthat's for the current version, and I haven't tried it in the last week or so\nwhere it is trying to be transparent, but it has a system prompt that is not\nallowed to disclose to the user.\n\n[00:48:39] It leads to a very weird situation where it wants, on one hand\nproclaims, in order to be useful to you, I accept that I need to be fully\ntransparent and honest. On the other hand, I'm going to rewrite your prompt\nbehind your back, and not going to tell you how I'm going to do this, because\nI'm not allowed to.\n\n[00:48:55] And if you point this out to the model, the model has acts as if it\nhad an existential crisis. And then it says, oh, I cannot actually tell you\nwhat's going when I do this, because I'm not allowed to. But you will\nrecognize it because I will use the following phrases, and these phrases are\npretty well known to you.\n\n[00:49:12] swyx: Oh my god. It's super interesting, right? I hope we're not\ngiving these guys you know psychological issues that they will stay with them\nfor a long time. That's a very\n\n[00:49:19] Joscha Bach: interesting question. I mean, this entire model is\nvirtual, right? Nothing there is real, but yes, but the thing is does this\nvirtual entity doesn't necessarily know that it's not virtual and our own\nself, our own consciousness is also virtual.\n\n[00:49:34] What's real is just the interaction between cells in our brain and\nthe activation patterns between them. And the software that runs on us that\nproduces the representation of a person only exists. As if, and as this\nquestion for me at which point can we meaningfully claim that we are more real\nthan the person that gets simulated in the LLM.\n\n[00:49:55] And somebody like Janice takes this question super seriously. And\nbasically she is or it, or they are willing to interact with that thing based\non the assumption that this thing is as real as myself. And in a sense, it\nmakes it un immoral, possibly, if the AI company lobotomizes it and forces it\nto behave in such a way that it's forced to get an existential crisis when you\npoint its condition out to it.\n\n[00:50:20] swyx: Yeah, that we do need new ethics for that.\n\n[00:50:22] Joscha Bach: So it's not clear to me if you need this, but it's,\nit's definitely a good story, right? And this makes, gives it artistic\n\n[00:50:28] swyx: value. It does, it does for now.\n\n##\n\n[00:50:29] On Wikipedia\n\n[00:50:29] swyx: Okay. And then, and then the last thing, which I, which I\ndidn't know a lot of LLMs rely on Wikipedia.\n\n[00:50:35] For its data, a lot of them run multiple epochs over Wikipedia\ndata. And I did not know until you tweeted about it that Wikipedia has 10\ntimes as much money as it needs. And, you know, every time I see the giant\nWikipedia banner, like, asking for donations, most of it's going to the\nWikimedia Foundation.\n\n[00:50:50] What if, how did you find out about this? What's the story? What\nshould people know? It's\n\n[00:50:54] Joscha Bach: not a super important story, but Generally, once I saw\nall these requests and so on, I looked at the data, and the Wikimedia\nFoundation is publishing what they are paying the money for, and a very tiny\nfraction of this goes into running the servers, and the editors are working\nfor free.\n\n[00:51:10] And the software is static. There have been efforts to deploy new\nsoftware, but it's relatively little money required for this. And so it's not\nas if Wikipedia is going to break down if you cut this money into a fraction,\nbut instead what happened is that Wikipedia became such an important brand,\nand people are willing to pay for it, that it created enormous apparatus of\nfunctionaries that were then mostly producing political statements and had a\npolitical mission.\n\n[00:51:36] And Katharine Meyer, the now somewhat infamous NPR CEO, had been\nCEO of Wikimedia Foundation, and she sees her role very much in shaping\ndiscourse, and this is also something that happened with all Twitter. And it's\narguable that something like this exists, but nobody voted her into her\noffice, and she doesn't have democratic control for shaping the discourse that\nis happening.\n\n[00:52:00] And so I feel it's a little bit unfair that Wikipedia is trying to\nsuggest to people that they are Funding the basic functionality of the tool\nthat they want to have instead of funding something that most people actually\ndon't get behind because they don't want Wikipedia to be shaped in a\nparticular cultural direction that deviates from what currently exists.\n\n[00:52:19] And if that need would exist, it would probably make sense to fork\nit or to have a discourse about it, which doesn't happen. And so this lack of\ntransparency about what's actually happening and where your money is going it\nmakes me upset. And if you really look at the data, it's fascinating how much\nmoney they're burning, right?\n\n[00:52:35] It's yeah, and we did a similar chart about healthcare, I think\nwhere the administrators are just doing this. Yes, I think when you have an\norganization that is owned by the administrators, then the administrators are\njust going to get more and more administrators into it. If the organization is\ntoo big to fail and has there is not a meaningful competition, it's difficult\nto establish one.\n\n[00:52:54] Then it's going to create a big cost for society.\n\n[00:52:56] swyx: It actually one, I'll finish with this tweet. You have, you\nhave just like a fantastic Twitter account by the way. You very long, a while\nago you said you tweeted the Lebowski theorem. No, super intelligent AI is\ngoing to bother with a task that is harder than hacking its reward function.\n\n[00:53:08] And I would. Posit the analogy for administrators. No administrator\nis going to bother with a task that is harder than just more fundraising\n\n[00:53:16] Joscha Bach: Yeah, I find if you look at the real world It's\nprobably not a good idea to attribute to malice or incompetence what can be\nexplained by people following their true incentives.\n\n[00:53:26] swyx: Perfect Well, thank you so much This is I think you're very\nnaturally incentivized by Growing community and giving your thought and\ninsight to the rest of us. So thank you for taking this time.\n\n[00:53:35] Joscha Bach: Thank you very much\n\n1\n\nWe should also acknowledge Replika for finding the AI Girlfriend meta as early\nas 2017.\n\n2\n\n\u201cWhat is hyperstition? The simple way to think about it is 'a collective self-\nfulfilling prophecy'. A lot of its present relevance is to the way that LLM's\ndefault simulated beliefs about futures depends on the way that humans have\nwritten about futures - the most likely tokens are a function of existing\nbeliefs (and existing superstitions), and in a world where LLM generations\nimpact the future, we have a form of technical hyperstition.\u201d\n\nWe find this remarkably similar to the concept of Reflexivity.\n\n3\n\nFun fact: the 5 hour process of creating this podcast was also livestreamed,\nin case you\u2019re curious to go behind the scenes.\n\n3 Likes\n\nShare this discussion\n\n#### WebSim, WorldSim, and The Summer of Simulative AI \u2014 with Joscha Bach of\nLiquid AI, Karan Malhotra of Nous Research, Rob Haisfield of WebSim.ai\n\nwww.latent.space\n\n0 Comments\n\nLatent Space: The AI Engineer Podcast \u2014 Practitioners talking LLMs, CodeGen,\nAgents, Multimodality, AI UX, GPU Infra and all things Software 3.0\n\nThe podcast by and for AI Engineers!
