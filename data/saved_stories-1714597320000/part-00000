It accounted for 81% of total sales and 91% of deliveries.\n  * Microsoft Leading the Way: Microsoft continued its undisputed lead purchaser role in CDR, including the largest biochar deal in history. Software and services, together with other high-margin sectors professional services and banking, represented over 90% of CDR purchases in Q1.\n  * Geographical Expansion: The market footprint expanded with Bolivia, Mexico, and Brazil joining Switzerland and the US to account for 72% of total sales collectively. Global South suppliers contributed 57% of Q1 sales volume, portending a potential shift in geographic dynamics and increasing diversity of supply.\n  * Concerns Over Market Transparency: The increasing trend towards non-disclosure in transaction details poses challenges to the market trust and transparency essential to grow the market.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe durable CDR market remains nascent and highly dependent on large\ntransactions. The overall trend is positive but has not yet achieved a solid\nfoundation. Each quarter brings its own developments and surprises,\nunderscoring the challenge of making long-term predictions based solely on\nshort-term data.\n\nThe key to sustained growth in the CDR market lies in attracting more buyers\nand encouraging existing ones to increase their investments. Durable CDR is a\nmarket led by forward-thinking companies and executives who proactively invest\nwithout any legal or regulatory requirement.\n\nThis quarter, Biochar was the clear method leader, led by two large\ntransactions from Global South companies: The Next 150 and Exomad Green. As in\n2023, when it accounted for 67% of all durable CDR purchases, Microsoft was in\na league of its own as a purchaser in Q1 2023, followed by Klimate-X, Shell\nEnvironmental Products, and BCG.\n\nAn increasingly concerning issue is the trend towards opaqueness in market\ntransactions. Transparency is essential to building trust in the market, and\ntrust is the foundation of relationships, increased business, and, thus,\nincreased carbon removal. Transparency includes clear and robust measurement,\nreporting, and verification (MRV) and sharing progress with the community.\nAchieving multiple gigatonne output of CDR will take a village; let\u2019s\ncelebrate the progress and encourage the ongoing efforts of well-intentioned\nparties to advance CDR technologies.\n\n## Market Results\n\n### Sales\n\nQ1 sales of 531K tonnes were 14.8x those of the same period a year ago. While\nthat seems impressive at first glance, look back a bit further and it\u2019s only\n1.2x that of Q1 2022. Furthermore, it marks the fourth consecutive quarter of\ndeclining sales.\n\nBiochar led all methods in Q1, claiming 81% of total sales and 91% of\ndeliveries. With new studies showing biochar\u2019s permanence being much longer\nthan previously thought, one of the lowest prices per tonne of CDR methods,\nand a short purchase-to-delivery cycle, will biochar continue to dominate\nfuture quarters?\n\n### Suppliers\n\nThe Q1 2024 supplier leaderboard reflects the aforementioned influence of\nbiochar, headlined by Exomad Green and The Next 150. Promisingly, it was the\nfirst-ever CDR sale for two of the top ten suppliers.\n\n14% of transactions did not disclose the supplier. While that figure is not\nunusually high, we will revisit the implications of non-disclosure as we\nanalyze purchaser trends in subsequent sections.\n\n### Purchasers\n\nThe Q1 2024 purchaser leaderboard showcased some familiar and emerging players\nmaking substantial contributions to the CDR market. Leading the pack,\nMicrosoft reaffirmed its commitment to CDR with its six-year deal with The\nNext 150, representing the largest biochar transaction in history. As\nmentioned, Microsoft is in a class of its own among CDR purchasers, accounting\nfor 67% of all durable CDR purchases in 2023.\n\nOther notable climate leaders, such as BCG, JP Morgan Chase, and Swiss Re,\ncontinue to make significant contributions. The entry of new players, such as\nKarbon-X and Shell Environmental Products, is also encouraging. Just as\nrevenue diversification is important in business growth, purchaser\ndiversification is necessary for CDR market growth.\n\n### Deliveries\n\n86K tonnes of durable CDR were delivered in Q1, with biochar accounting for\n91% of the total. This significant concentration in biochar deliveries\nunderscores its current technological and market readiness and highlights its\ngrowing acceptance as a scalable solution of sufficiently high permanence for\ncarbon dioxide removal.\n\nDeliveries were led by Exomad Green, which also took the top place in overall\nQ1 volume sold. Established biochar producers with a history of delivering in\nprior quarters and years also figured prominently on the list.\n\nThank you for exploring our 2024 Q1 Durable CDR Market Update report.
