The origins of the term date back to the\n1944 film Gaslight, set in Victorian London, in which a husband leads his wife\nto the brink of insanity by insisting that she is imagining, among other\nevents, the gas lamp flames wavering when he is out of the house. In\nactuality, the husband manipulates the flow of gas during his absences and\nintentionally deceives her. Use of the word \u201cgaslighting\u201d has recently become\nmainstream. The Merriam-Webster dictionary chose it as \u201cword of the year\u201d in\n2022, citing the New York Times\u2019 coverage of patients who used the expanded\nterm, \u201cmedical gaslighting\u201d, to describe feeling discounted or doubted by\ntheir physicians. The reality that patients feel psychologically manipulated\nby their physicians is deeply concerning and requires equally deep inquiry\nwhich, to date, has not been done.\n\nAccording to the New York Times,^1 the term \u201cmedical gaslighting\u201d gained\ntraction on the social media platform Instagram; the hashtag has nearly 20,000\nposts to-date. In the medical literature, the term \u201cmedical gaslighting\u201d\ndebuted in September of 2020 when JAMA^2 published a first-person account of a\npatient who believed she was gaslighted when her symptoms were repeatedly\ndiscounted; she was ultimately diagnosed with long COVID. In October of 2020,\nHoffman et al.^3 described the dismissal or downplaying of gynecological pain\nand symptoms in women as medical gaslighting. References to medical\ngaslighting in the media have eclipsed references to the topic in medical\njournals. In fact, a recent search for \u201cmedical gaslighting\u201d in the National\nInstitutes of Health\u2019s PubMed database yields only 4 references regarding\npatients\u2019 healthcare experience (in the medical literature, most articles\nabout \u201cgaslighting\u201d refer to healthcare providers feeling manipulated by the\nhealthcare system).\n\nIn this void, the popular press is shaping the definition of medical\ngaslighting, often through accounts of patients who felt dismissed by doctors\nand faulting physicians as the primary cause of negative healthcare outcomes.\nReports frequently cite the context of structural racism, cultural and gender\ndiscrimination, and biases\u2014real threats to health equity with a troubled\nhistory\u2014as significant contributors to patients\u2019 feeling written-off and\nmanipulated. The New York Times^4 attempted to explain the term in an article\non July 29, 2022, entitled, \u201cFeeling Dismissed? How to Spot \u2018Medical\nGaslighting\u2019 and What to Do About It.\u201d The article correctly acknowledged\nareas for improvement, such as the tendency of physicians to interrupt\npatients. However, it added a concerning new dimension to the term by\nasserting that a sign of gaslighting is when \u201cyour provider will not order key\nimaging or lab work to rule out or confirm a diagnosis.\u201d Patients\u2014particularly\nwomen and people of color\u2014feeling that their concerns are minimized is a\nserious concern for the medical profession, but not ordering potentially\nunindicated tests in response to patient requests is another thing entirely.\n\nPublic awareness campaigns such as Choosing Wisely, a partnership between the\nAmerican Board of Internal Medicine Foundation and specialty societies have\ndeveloped clinical recommendations to discourage unnecessary care and instead\npromote value-based care. Although diagnostic diligence is critical, lab tests\nand imaging studies are not always the \u201ckey\u201d to a diagnosis, and patients are\nnot always aware of the right therapies. A common example is patients asking\nfor antibiotics to treat a virus, and feeling unheard when requested drugs are\nnot prescribed. The campaign promotes doctor-patient conversations about\nfrequently-used tests that may \u201cdo more harm than good.\u201d\n\nIt appears that a lack of such conversations, rather than a lack of testing,\nis creating gaslighting perceptions. Patients who feel heard, understood, and\ncared-for will not feel gaslighted; and with proper dialogue, it is more\nlikely that physicians will order the right tests and therapies when they are\nindicated. Over 40 years of research have shown that using relationship-\ncentered communication skills achieves this, and more^5,6. These skills are\nlinked with improved health outcomes and better patient experience.\nImportantly, these skills can be incorporated into practice with modest\neffort. Key evidence-based skills include collaborative agenda-setting for the\nencounter, allowing patients to describe their symptoms without early\ninterruption, eliciting the emotional context of that story, and responding\nwith verbal empathy.\n\nMany gaslighting anecdotes focus on physicians attributing patients\u2019 symptoms\nsolely to stress, poor nutrition, mental health, lack of exercise, or obesity.\nSince Dr. George Engel conceptualized the biopsychosocial model in 1977, an\nabundance of evidence has substantiated that biological disease is influenced\nby complex mind\u2013body linkages as well as social determinants of health. For\ninstance, we know that feelings of hope can improve cancer outcomes; cognitive\nbehavioral therapy can reduce centralized pain; studies of drugs are\nconfounded by placebo and nocebo effects; and adverse childhood experiences\nincrease the probabilities of cardiac disease. Despite this, conversations\nabout the psychological and social dimensions of health and illness leave some\npatients feeling accused of having an illness that is \u201call in their head\u201d.\n\nWe must do a better job of exploring the biopsychosocial model with patients,\nand collaboratively untangling its relevance to the illness experience and\nclinical outcomes for each individual patient. Relationship-centered\ncommunication trainings that focus on the biopsychosocial model, such as those\noffered by the Academy of Communication in Healthcare, may improve physicians\u2019\nskill in discussing the mind\u2013body connection. These trainings must be modified\nfor the digital age to account for communication challenges caused by\ntelemedicine visits, cumbersome electronic medical records, and a general\nreliance on technology for communication as opposed to face-to-face\nrelationship-building.\n\nCertainly, factors beyond physicians\u2019 immediate control challenge\nrelationship-centered communication. The proportion of physician time spent on\ndirect patient care has been eroded by escalating administrative and insurance\nburdens, documentation requirements, and economic models that reward\nproductivity over value. Time-constraints reduce physician and patient\nconfidence in healthcare decision-making, quality, and safety. In a study of\nprimary care medical teams, over two-thirds of respondents felt that time-\npressures interfered with screening, diagnosis, or treatment opportunities.\nAdditionally, patients receiving care from time-stressed practices were more\nlikely to report lower levels of support.^7 Such feelings of low support\nlikely fuel gaslighting perceptions.\n\nDetermining which patient demographics, medical conditions, physician\nbehaviors, and health system pressures are correlated with gaslighting\ncomplaints will enable the healthcare system to learn more about gender,\nclass, race, disability, age, and time as factors in medical gaslighting and\nthen create the appropriate solutions. Research using qualitative methods such\nas focus groups and interviews combined with quantitative methods such as\npatient surveys can help characterize differential experiences of gaslighting.\nIn addition, data-mining, artificial intelligence, and deep learning\nalgorithms can elucidate patterns and trends in medical gaslighting references\nin social media posts, although consideration must be given to the biases in\nsuch methods.\n\nGaslighting means deception. Ensuring that physicians have the time and skill\nto help each patient feel heard, understood, and cared-for will stop this\ncynical term from being further linked to the practice of medicine.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
