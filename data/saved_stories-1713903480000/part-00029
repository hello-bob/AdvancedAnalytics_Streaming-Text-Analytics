We\u2019re at forty! (Announcing the release of Fedora Linux 40)\n\nPosted by Matthew Miller on April 23, 2024 2 Comments\n\nImage contributed by Consolation Obazee\n\nRecent Posts\n\n### Slimbook Fedora 2: New Ultrabooks for Fedora Linux 40\n\n### What's New in Fedora KDE 40?\n\n### What's new in Fedora Workstation 40\n\nOh, wow. This feels like a big number! I\u2019m proud to announce the 40th release\nof Fedora Linux, a community-built and community-maintained operating system\nthat belongs to all of us. I\u2019m also happy to note that we\u2019re back on track\nwith an on-time release. Thank you to all Fedora contributors who made that\npossible, and who have, yet again, made this our best one ever.\n\nThis is also a personally exciting number for me, because this marks the 20th\nrelease for which I\u2019ve served as Fedora Project Leader. We\u2019ve gone through a\nlot in this last decade, and I\u2019m incredibly happy to see our community thrive\nand grow. In addition to many long-familiar names and faces, it\u2019s exciting to\nsee a new generation with new energy and ideas. In some cases, this is\nliterally a new generation, as many of you have grown up with Fedora. But at\nwhatever age, I\u2019m proud we\u2019ve built such a welcoming and friendly community,\nand that we continue to work at improving our inclusiveness, diversity, and\naccessibility.\n\nBut anyway! Enough of that. Time to see what we\u2019ve got for you in Fedora Linux\n40! If you have a system already, Upgrading Fedora to a New Release is easy.\nIf you\u2019re new, or just curious, head to Get Fedora for installation options.\n\n## Desktop news\n\nFedora Workstation Edition features the GNOME desktop environment, now updated\nto version 46. Check out What\u2019s New in Fedora Workstation 40? for the\nhighlights!\n\nThe KDE Spin now includes KDE Plasma 6, and runs with Wayland out of the box.\nRead more about that and other KDE Spin updates at What\u2019s New in Fedora KDE\n40?\n\nWe\u2019re also officially reviving the \u201cFedora Atomic Desktop\u201d brand for all of\nour variants which use ostree or image-based provisioning. Our technology\nisn\u2019t really \u201cimmutable\u201d, so this provides a better grouping. Read more about\nthis at Introducing Fedora Atomic Desktops \u2014 but in short, Fedora Silverblue\nand Fedora Kinoite will remain, while the other desktop variants will become\nFedora Sway Atomic and Fedora Budgie Atomic.\n\n## Tools for AI development\n\nFedora Linux 40 ships with our first-ever PyTorch package. PyTorch is a\npopular framework for deep learning, and it can be difficult to reliably\ninstall with the right versions of drivers and libraries and so on. The\ncurrent package only supports running on the CPU, without GPU or NPU\nacceleration, but this is just the first step. Our aim is to produce a\ncomplete stack with PyTorch and other popular tools ready to use on a wide\nvariety of hardware out-of-the-box.\n\nWe\u2019re also shipping with ROCm 6 \u2014 open-source software that provides\nacceleration support for AMD graphics cards. We plan to have that enabled for\nPyTorch in a future release.\n\n## Updates all around!\n\nAs usual, we\u2019ve rebuilt everything in the distribution using updated compilers\nand libraries (and, of course, those updated tools are ready for developers to\nuse). These updates bring bugfixes, security improvements, and performance\ngains.\n\nAnd, of course, hundreds of Fedora packagers and testers have worked to\nintegrate the latest versions of open source software from thousands of\nupstream projects. Those projects, in turn, are made by an uncountable number\nof developers and contributors working on marketing, design, documentation,\ncode, quality, translations, communications, events, governance,\ninfrastructure, security, and so much more. Thank you again to everyone who\nmakes Fedora amazing, and to everyone whose work has built this whole universe\nof free and open source software.\n\n## Speaking of updates...\n\nThere are several important release-day bugfix and security updates available\ntoday as well. If you upgrade from an earlier Fedora Linux release, you\u2019ll get\nthem as part of that. For new installations, please make sure to check for and\napply updates as soon as possible.\n\n## In the unlikely event of a problem...\n\nIf you run into a problem, visit our Ask Fedora user support forum. This\nincludes a category for common issues.\n\n## Or if you just want to say \u201chello\u201d...\n\nDrop by our \u201cvirtual watercooler\u201d on Fedora Discussion and join a\nconversation, share something interesting, and introduce yourself.\n\nAlso, remember that our annual contributor conference, Flock To Fedora, is\ncoming up! It\u2019ll be in Rochester, New York this August. The call for session\nproposals is still open, if you have something you\u2019d like to share or work on.\nIf you\u2019re already a Fedora contributor, or are interested in being one, or\nthink you might be, we\u2019d love to see you there!\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFedora Project community\n\n#### Matthew Miller\n\nMatthew is the Fedora Project Leader.
