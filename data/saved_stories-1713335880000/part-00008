The bacterial behaviors and\nmechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry\nremains poorly understood. Herein, we report that clinical isolates of non-\ntyphoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter\nkoseri are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum. To simulate GI\nbleeding, we utilized a custom injection-based microfluidics device and found\nthat femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce the bacterial\npopulation to swim toward and aggregate at the serum source. This response is\norchestrated through chemotaxis, and a major chemical cue driving\nchemoattraction is L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum that is\nrecognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr. We report the\nfirst crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with\nL-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine\nshared among Tsr orthologues. By mapping the phylogenetic distribution of this\nchemoreceptor we found Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and\nnumerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with\nbloodstream infections. Lastly, we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human\nserum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the\nchemoreceptor Tsr provides a competitive advantage for migration into\nenterohaemorrhagic lesions. We term this bacterial behavior of taxis toward\nserum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and the consumption of serum\nnutrients, as \u201cbacterial vampirism\u201d which may relate to the proclivity of\nEnterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.\n\neLife assessment\n\nThis work uses an interdisciplinary approach combining microfluidics,\nstructural biology, and genetic analyses to provide important findings that\nshow that pathogenic enteric bacteria exhibit taxis toward human serum. The\ndata are compelling and show that the behavior utilizes the bacterial\nchemotaxis system and the chemoreceptor Tsr, which senses the amino acid\nL-serine. The work provides an ecological context for the role of serine as a\nbacterial chemoattractant and could have clinical implications for bacterial\nbloodstream invasion during episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n  * https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.93178.2.sa2\n\n  * Read the peer reviews\n  * About eLife assessments\n\n# Introduction\n\nBacteria use chemosensory systems to survey and navigate their environments\n^1\u20133. In the exceptionally dynamic environment of the host gut, peristalsis\nand flow constantly perturb the microscopic physicochemical landscape.\nResponding to such transient and shifting stimuli is enabled by chemosensing\nthat allows bacteria to rapidly restructure their populations, within seconds,\nthrough taxis toward or away from effector sources ^4\u20136. Enteric pathogens and\npathobionts use chemosensing to colonize specific tissues, based on sources of\nexogenous nutrients, toxins, and host-emitted cues, through control of\nmotility and adhesion systems such as chemotaxis, chemokinesis, twitching, and\nbiofilm formation ^3,7\u201311. Previously, we determined that most bacterial\ngenera classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \u2018priority\npathogens\u2019 employ sophisticated chemosensory systems for efficient infection\nand exert precise control over their colonization topography ^3,12,13. These\ninclude multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae pathogens of the gut such as\nSalmonella enterica, Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), Citrobacter\nkoseri, and Enterobacter cloacae, which present major challenges for\nnosocomial infections and global health ^3,13.\n\nMapping the chemosensing signals enteric bacteria perceive within the host can\nprovide insight into pathogenesis and perhaps be a source of drug targets for\ninhibiting pathogen navigation and colonization ^3,14. Gut dysbiosis\u2014a\ndiseased host state induced by pathologies, inflammation and\ninfections\u2014exposes enteric bacteria to chemical stimuli distinct from that of\na healthy gut that could encourage opportunistic pathogenesis ^3,15. Yet, the\nstimuli sensed by bacterial pathogens and pathobionts within the dysbiotic gut\nenviron environment remain poorly understood. Investigating how chemosensing\ncontrols the responses of pathogen populations to chemical features associated\nwith dysbiosis presents an opportunity to gain deeper insights into the\ncritical juncture between infection resolution and exacerbation (Fig. 1)\n^3,15\u201317.\n\nModel of the microenvironment of bacterial-induced hemorrhagic lesions. The\ntypical course of non-typhoidal S. enterica infections is shown proceeding\nthrough infection, incubation, prodromal, illness, and resolution stages\n(black arrows). The atypical route of GI bleeding, associated with increased\nmortality and morbidity, is shown in red arrows, with rates approximated from\navailable literature. An artistic depiction of bacterial injury tropism is\nshown bottom.\n\nIn a diseased gut, enteric bacteria may encounter a distinctive host-derived\nchemical feature not found in a healthy gut: GI bleeding. The microenvironment\nof an enteric hemorrhagic lesion involves a source of serum, the liquid\ncomponent of blood, emanating from the host tissue and diffusing into the\nintestinal lumen (Fig. 1). In effect, this creates a microscopic gradient,\ni.e., a microgradient, of chemicals flowing outward from a point source that\nmay serve as chemosensory signals for bacteria. Enteric infections caused by\nEnterobacteriaceae species can lead to GI bleeding, a condition with a\nsignificant risk of mortality. Although severe GI bleeding isn\u2019t a typical\noutcome of enteric infection, it is a substantial burden on human health,\naffecting around 40-150 out of every 100,000 individuals annually, with a\nfatality rate ranging from 6% to 30% (Fig. 1) ^3,13,18\u201320,20\u201323.\nEnterobacteriaceae are prone to bloodstream entry and are a leading cause of\nsepsis-related deaths in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)\nthat have recurrent enterohemorrhagic lesions ^24,25. Intestinal intra-\nabdominal abscesses, microperforations, and fistulas associated with IBD\npredispose patients to GI bleeding and bacteremia ^26,27. Despite the\nestablished connection between Enterobacteriaceae-induced sepsis and GI\nbleeding, it remained unknown whether these bacteria perceive serum through\nchemosensing.\n\nSerum is a complex biological solution with components that may enhance, or\nhinder, bacterial growth. It offers a rich reservoir of nutrients for\nbacteria: sugars and amino acids at millimolar concentrations and essential\nmetals like iron and zinc ^3,28. Yet, serum also contains host factors that\ninhibit bacterial proliferation in the bloodstream such as cathelicidin,\ndefensins, and the complement system ^29,30. Consequently, how enteric\npathogens and pathobionts might respond to serum diffusing into a liquid\nenvironment remained unclear. To address this open question, we elucidated how\nEnterobacteriaceae species use chemosensing to respond to serum, the molecular\nmechanism of this response, and how chemosensing is employed to enter and\nmigrate into enterohemorrhagic lesions. Across all examined scenarios we\nobserve these bacteria to exhibit remarkable sensitivity and attraction\ntowards human serum. These findings suggest that environmental stimuli unique\nto the dysbiotic gut, sensed through bacterial chemosensory systems, can\nencourage pathogenic behaviors and adverse consequences for the host.\n\n# Results\n\n## Use of the chemosensory injection rig assay (CIRA) to study polymicrobial\nchemosensing behaviors\n\nTo model features of enteric bleeding in vitro, we utilized an experimental\nsystem to inject minute quantities of human serum into a pond of motile\nbacteria and observe real-time responses by microscopy (Fig. 2A). The system\nand methodology, which we refer to herein as the chemosensory injection rig\nassay (CIRA), offers several advantages for studying bacterial chemosensing\nand localization in response to serum: (1) we can use bona fide human serum,\n(2) the readouts are direct measurements of real-time localization dynamics of\nthe bacterial population, and (3) similar to a bleeding event, a source of\nfresh serum is continuously emitted. By employing multichannel fluorescence\nimaging of differentially labeled bacterial populations we observe\npolymicrobial interactions through head-to-head comparisons of bacterial\nbehavior within the same experiment.\n\nS. enterica Typhimurium IR715 rapidly localizes toward human serum.

Quantification of S. enterica Typhimurium IR715 attraction\nresponse to human serum (n=4, 37\u00b0 C) characterized as either the relative\nnumber of bacteria within 150 \u03bcm of the source (left), or the radial\ndistribution of the bacterial population over time (right, shown in 10 s\nintervals). G. Area under the curve (AUC) versus time for the bacterial\npopulation within 100 \u03bcm of the serum treatment source (area indicated in\nyellow in panel F). Effect size (Cohen\u2019s d) between the treatment start and\nendpoints is indicated. Insertion of the treatment microcapillary is indicated\nwith black \u2018in\u2019 arrow. Attraction rate over time indicated in gray. Data shown\nare means, error bars indicate SEM.\n\nThe CIRA microgradient is established through injection at a constant rate of\n\u223c300 femtoliters per minute, through a 0.5 \u03bcm glass microcapillary, and\nexpands over time through diffusion (Fig. 2A-B, Fig. S1). The diffusion of\nserum metabolites can be reasonably approximated by the three-dimensional\ndifferential diffusion equation (Fig. 2B, Fig. S1, Fig. S2, Method Details).\nWe calculate that the introduction of a minute volume of novel effector\nproduces a steep microgradient, in which a millimolar source recedes to\nnanomolar concentrations after diffusion across only a few hundred microns\n(Fig. 2B, Fig. S1). For instance, we expect a bacterium 100 \u03bcm from a 1 mM\ninfinite-volume source to experience a local concentration of a small molecule\neffector (diffusion coefficient approximately 4 x 10^\u22126 cm^2 s^-1) of 10 nM\nafter 300 s of injection (Fig. 2B, Fig. S1). To visualize the microgradient\nexperimentally, we utilized Alexa Fluor 488 dye (A488) and observed the\nmicrogradient to be stable and consistent across replicates (Fig. 2C-D, Movie\n1). As a test case of the accuracy of the microgradient modeling, we compared\nour calculated values for A488 diffusion to the normalized fluorescence\nintensity at time 120 s. We determined the concentration to be accurate within\n5% over the distance range 70-270 \u03bcm (Fig. S2). At smaller distances (<70 \u03bcm)\nthe measured concentration is approximately 10% lower than that predicted by\nthe computation. This could be due to advection effects near the injection\nsite that would tend to enhance the effective local diffusion rate.\nAdditionally, we found no behavioral differences in treatments with buffer in\nthe range of pH 4-9, indicating small, localized pH changes are\ninconsequential for taxis in our system, and that any artifactual forces, such\nas flow, account for only minor changes to bacterial distribution at the\npopulation level, in the range of \u00b110% (Fig. S1).\n\n## Non-typhoidal S. enterica serovars exhibit rapid attraction to human serum\n\nWe first studied the chemosensing behaviors of S. Typhimurium IR715, which is\na derivative of ATCC 14028 originally isolated from domesticated chickens, and\nis used extensively in the study of Salmonella pathogenesis (Table S1)^31\u201334.\nAs a treatment, we utilized commercially available human serum that was not\nheat-inactivated nor exposed to chemical or physical treatments that would be\nexpected to alter its native complement properties (see Materials & Methods).\nWe assessed the response of motile IR715, containing a fluorescent mPlum\nmarker, to a source of human serum over the course of 5 minutes (Fig. 2E,\nMovie 1). During this timeframe, we witnessed a rapid attraction response\nwhereby the motile bacterial population reorganized from a random distribution\nto one concentrated within a 100-150 \u03bcm radius of the serum source (Fig. 2E-F,\nMovie 1). To compare responses between CIRA experiments, we plotted data as\neither the relative number of bacteria within 150 \u03bcm of the treatment (Fig.\n2F, left panel) or a radial distribution of the population (Fig. 2F, right\npanel) over time. By these metrics, we determined S. Typhimurium IR715 is\nattracted to human serum. The bacterial population in proximity to the serum\nsource doubles by 40 s, reaches a maximal attraction rate by 90 s, and\napproaches equilibrium by 300 s post-treatment (Fig. 2G).\n\nTo test whether serum attraction is observed in Salmonella strains that infect\nhumans, and if responses differ among non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars, we\nemployed dual-channel CIRA imaging to compete S. Typhimurium IR715 against\nrepresentative clinical isolates of Typhimurium (SARA1), Newport\n(M11018046001A), and Enteriditis (05E01375). These serovars are the most\ncommon in North American infections ^35. In varying magnitude, all strains\nshowed attraction responses to human serum, seen as a significant distribution\nbias toward the serum source relative to the experiment periphery (Fig. 3,\nMovie 2). We noted that in some experiments the population peak is 50-75 \u03bcm\nfrom the source, possibly due to a compromise between achieving proximity to\nnutrients in the serum and avoidance of bactericidal serum elements, but this\nbehavior was not consistent across all experiments. Overall, our data show S.\nenterica serovars that cause disease in humans are exquisitely sensitive to\nhuman serum, responding to femtoliter quantities as an attractant, and that\ndistinct reorganization at the population level occurs within minutes of\nexposure (Fig. 3, Movie 2).\n\nTaxis to human serum is retained across S. enterica clinical isolates and\ndiverse serovars. A-C. CIRA competition experiments between S. Typhimurium\nIR715 (pink) and clinical isolates (green) responding to human serum for 5\nmins (n=4, 37\u00b0 C). Images are representative max projections over the final\nminute of treatment. Radial distributions calculated from max projections and\naveraged across replicates are shown as fold-change relative to the image\nperiphery at 240 \u03bcm from the source. Inset plots show fold-change AUC of\nstrains in the same experiment relative to an expected baseline of 1 (no\nchange). p-values shown are calculated with an unpaired two-sided t-test\ncomparing the means of the two strains, or one-sided t-test to assess\nstatistical significance in terms of change from 1-fold (stars). Data shown\nare means, error bars indicate SEM.\n\n## Chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr mediate serum attraction\n\nSerum is a complex biological solution that contains sugars, amino acids, and\nother metabolites that could serve as attractant signals ^3. Based on the\nrapid attraction of motile, swimming bacteria to the treatment source,\ncharacteristic of chemotactic behaviors ^5, we hypothesized that one or more\nof these chemical components are specifically recognized as chemoattractants\nthrough the repertoire of chemoreceptors possessed by Salmonellae (Fig. 4A).\nBased on known chemoreceptor-chemoattractant ligand interactions ^3,36, we\nidentified three chemoreceptors that might mediate taxis toward serum: (1)\ntaxis to serine and repellents (Tsr), which responds to L- serine, and\nreportedly also norepinephrine (NE) and 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA); (2)\ntaxis to ribose and glucose/galactose (Trg), which responds to glucose and\ngalactose; and (3) taxis to aspartate and repellents (Tar), which responds to\nL-aspartate (Fig. 4A). We modeled the local concentration profile of these\neffectors based on their typical concentrations in human serum (Fig. 4B). Of\nthese, by far the two most prevalent chemoattractants in serum are glucose (5\nmM) and L-serine (100-300 \u03bcM) (Fig. 4B-F). This suggested to us that the\nchemoreceptors Trg and/or Tsr could play important roles in serum attraction.\nThese chemoreceptors were also previously shown to provide colonization\nadvantages during S. Typhimurium infection ^34.\n\nAttraction to human serum is mediated through chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor\nTsr. A. Potential mechanisms involved in Salmonella sensing of\nchemoattractants present in human serum. Approximate concentrations of these\neffectors in human serum are indicated in parentheses ^3. B-F. Microgradient\nmodeling of serum chemoattractant concentrations. G-I. CIRA competition\nexperiments between S. Typhimurium IR715 WT and isogenic mutants cheY, or tsr,\nand tsr versus cheY, in response to human serum (n=3-4, 37\u00b0 C). Rates in terms\nof fold-change are indicated with light pink/light green lines and plotted on\nthe gray secondary y-axis. Inset AUC plots are shown as described in Fig. 3.\nData are means and error bars are SEM.\n\nTo test the role of chemotaxis in serum attraction, we competed wildtype (WT)\nS. Typhimurium IR715 against a chemotaxis-null isogenic cheY mutant, which\npossesses swimming motility but is blind to chemoeffector signals (Fig. 4G,\nMovie 3). Whereas the WT mounts a robust attraction response to serum, the\ncheY mutant population remains randomly distributed (Fig. 4G, Movie 3). We\nalso observed the cheY mutant to exhibit a slight decline in cells proximal to\nthe treatment source over time, which we attribute to cellular crowding\neffects from the influx of WT cells (Fig. 4G, Movie 3). In this background,\nthe fraction of WT cells within 100 \u03bcm of the serum source increases by\n70-fold, with the maximal rate of attraction achieved by 120 s post-treatment.\nThus, we determined that chemotaxis is namely responsible for the rapid\nlocalization of S. enterica to human serum.\n\nWe next analyzed strains with deletions of the chemoreceptor genes trg, or\ntsr, to test the roles of these chemoreceptors in mediating taxis to serum. We\nwere surprised to find that the trg strain had deficiencies in swimming\nmotility (data not shown). This was not noted in earlier work but could\nexplain the severe infection disadvantage of this mutant ^34. Because motility\nis a prerequisite for chemotaxis, we chose not to study the trg mutant\nfurther, and instead focused our investigations on Tsr. We compared\nchemoattraction responses in dual-channel CIRA experiments between the WT and\ntsr mutant and observed an interesting behavior whereby both strains exhibited\nchemoattraction, but the tsr mutant distribution was relegated to a halo at\nthe periphery of the WT peak (Fig. 4H, Movie 3). The WT efficiently\noutcompetes the tsr mutant such that by 5 minutes post-treatment the ratio of\nWT to tsr cells proximal to the serum source is 3:1 (Fig. 4H, Movie 3).\nSimilar to cheY, we presume the tsr halo results from cellular crowding\neffects induced by the high density of WT cells near the serum source. To test\nhow the tsr mutant responds to serum in the absence of a strong competitor, we\ncompared chemoattraction between tsr and cheY. In this background, tsr\nchemoattraction remained diminished relative to that of WT, but the tsr\ndistribution shifted closer to the serum source (Fig. 4I, Movie 3). Since tsr\nmutation diminishes serum attraction but does not eliminate it, we conclude\nthat multiple chemoattractant signals and chemoreceptors mediate taxis to\nserum. To further understand the mechanism of this behavior we chose to focus\non Tsr as a representative chemoreceptor involved in the response, presuming\nthat serum taxis involves one, or more, of the chemoattractants recognized by\nTsr that is present in serum: L-serine, NE, or DHMA.\n\n## S. Typhimurium exhibits chemoattraction to L-serine, but not NE or DHMA\n\nWe next sought to identify the specific chemoattractants driving Tsr-mediated\nserum attraction. Suspecting that one effector might be L-serine, we took\nadvantage of the fact that Tsr can only bind the L and not the D enantiomer\nand treated the serum with serine racemase, an enzyme that converts L- to\nD-serine. The attraction of S. Typhimurium IR715 to serum treated with serine\nracemase is diminished and the population is more diffuse (Fig. S3A-B). In\ncompetition experiments between WT and chemotaxis-deficient strains, the WT\ncells proximal to the treatment source are reduced by about half (Fig. S3C),\nand WT no longer possesses an attraction advantage over the tsr mutant (Fig.\nS3D). These data support that the deficiency of the tsr strain in serum taxis\nis due to an inability to sense L-serine within serum.\n\nWe next used CIRA to examine responses to purified effectors diluted in\nbuffer. The concentration of L-serine in human serum ranges from approximately\n100-400 \u03bcm, depending on diet and health factors ^37\u201339, whereas the\nneurotransmitter NE, and its metabolized form, DHMA, are thought to circulate\nat approximately 10 nM ^40,41. It has been proposed that, like L-serine, NE\nand/or DHMA are sensed directly by Tsr and at even higher (nanomolar) affinity\n^42,43. We used CIRA to test the response of S. Typhimurium IR715 to L-serine,\nNE, and DHMA. We observed robust chemoattraction responses to L-serine,\nevident by the accumulation of cells toward the treatment source (Fig. S3E,\nMovie 4), but no response to NE or DHMA, with the cells remaining randomly\ndistributed even after 5 minutes of exposure (Fig. S3F-I, Movie 5, Movie S1).\nFollowing extensive investigation and adjusting experiment parameters such as\nculture protocol, cell density, temperature, injection flow, and compound\nconcentration, we saw no evidence that NE or DHMA are chemoeffectors for S.\nTyphimurium (Fig. S3F-I, Movie 5, Movie S1). Since this result is surprising\ngiven previous reports ^42,43, we have provided a database of 17 videos of\nCIRA experiments showing the null response to DHMA and NE, versus L-serine,\nunder various conditions (Data S1). Together, our data indicate the\nchemoattractant component of serum that is sensed through Tsr is L-serine.\n\nChemoattraction to L-serine has mostly been studied in the context of model\nlaboratory strains and has not been rigorously evaluated for S. enterica\nclinical isolates or various serovars. To establish whether L-serine sensing\nis observed in strains responsible for human infections, we used dual-channel\nCIRA to compare chemoattraction to L-serine between S. Typhimurium IR715 and\nclinical isolates (Fig. 5A-C, Movie 4). In each case we observe robust\nchemoattraction, though there are differences in sensitivity to L-serine. The\nmagnitude of chemoattraction was highest for S. Typhimurium SARA1 and S.\nNewport, whereas S. Typhimurium IR715 and S. Enteriditis showed lower\nresponses, which could relate to the different host specificities of these\nserovars and strains (Fig. 5A-C, Movie 4).\n\nThe concentration of L-serine in human serum is sufficient to mediate\nchemoattraction. A-C. CIRA competition experiments between S. Typhimurium\nIR715 (pink) and clinical isolates (green) in response to 500 \u03bcM L-serine\n(n=3, 37\u00b0 C). D. Representative results showing max projections of S.\nTyphimurium IR715 at 240 \u2013 300 s post CIRA treatment with L-serine\nconcentrations (30\u00b0 C). E.

Typhimurium\nIR715 WT or tsr mutant responses to L-aspartate or L-serine treatments (30\u00b0\nC).\n\nWe next used CIRA to test a range of L-serine sources spanning five orders of\nmagnitude to define whether the concentrations of L-serine present in human\nserum are sufficient to drive a chemoattraction response. Within the 5 min\ntimeframe of our experiments, the minimal source concentration of L-serine\nneeded to induce chemoattraction is 0.5-5 \u03bcM. The [L-serine] source required\nfor half-maximal chemoattraction (i.e., K_1/2) is approximately 105 \u03bcM (Fig.\n5D-E, Fig. S4). Based on our microgradient modeling, this corresponds to a\nlocal L-serine concentration of 1 nM for bacteria 100 \u03bcm from the source at\nt=300 s (Fig. S1, Fig. 4B). Therefore, we determined that the typical\nconcentration of L-serine in human serum is >200-fold greater than the minimum\nrequired to elicit chemoattraction. To gain further insights into the dynamics\nof L-serine chemoattraction, we monitored chemotactic behavior in the presence\nof L-serine, and then removed the treatment (Fig. 5F). These experiments\nshowed maximal attraction and dispersal rates to be similar, changing by\napproximately 4% per second (Fig. 5F). These findings emphasize the rapid\ndynamics through which chemotaxis can influence the localization of bacteria\nin response to microscopic gradients of chemoeffectors.\n\nTo substantiate our findings, we considered some alternative explanations for\nour data. First, we tested whether Tsr alone was required for chemoattraction\nto L-serine, or whether some other chemoreceptor, or form of taxis, such as\nenergy or redox taxis, might contribute to the responses. However, we found\nwhen treated with L-serine, the tsr mutant showed no chemoattraction and\nbehaved similarly to the chemotaxis-null cheY mutant (Fig. 5G). Second, we\nconsidered the possibility that the defect in serum attraction of the tsr\nmutant could be due to pleiotropic effects of the tsr deletion on chemotaxis\nsignaling or motility, similar to the inhibited swimming motility of the trg\nmutant. We tested the ability of the tsr strain to respond to another\nchemoattractant, L-aspartate, which is sensed through the Tar chemoreceptor\n(Fig. 4A). We found that the tsr mutant mounted a robust chemoattraction\nresponse to 500 \u03bcM L-aspartate, similar in magnitude and rate to WT (Fig. 5G),\nsupporting that chemotaxis to non-serine stimuli remains functional in the tsr\nstrain. Along with the data showing the WT attraction to serum is diminished\nwith serine racemase treatment, these results support that the mechanism of\nTsr- mediated chemoattraction to serum is through direct recognition of\nL-serine.\n\n## Serum provides a growth advantage for non-typhoidal S. enterica serovars\n\nThe robust serum attraction response conserved across diverse Salmonella\nserovars suggests serum, and L-serine present in serum, could be a source of\nnutrients during infection. Yet, serum also contains bactericidal factors that\ncould inhibit bacterial growth ^29. To address this uncertainty, we\ninvestigated whether active human serum provides a growth benefit for\nSalmonella when diluted into minimal media. In all strains surveyed, we found\nthat serum addition enhances growth, and we saw no evidence of killing even\nfor the highest serum concentrations tested (Fig. 6). The growth enhancement\nrequires relatively little serum, as 2.5% v/v is sufficient to provide a\n1.5-2.5-fold growth increase (Fig. 6).\n\nNon-typhoidal S. enterica strains obtain a growth benefit from human serum not\nrecapitulated from L-Ser treatments alone. A-D. Growth is shown as area under\nthe curve (AUC, black) and A600 at mid-log phase for the untreated replicates\n(gray, n=16). Data are means and error is SEM.\n\nL-serine is not only a chemoattractant, but also an important nutrient for\nbacteria in the gut ^3, so we hypothesized the growth benefit could be from\nL-serine. We determined by mass spectrometry that our human serum samples\ncontain 241 \u03bcM +/- 48 total serine (L- and D- enantiomers), of which\napproximately 99% is expected to be L-serine ^44 (Fig. S5). We attempted to\ntreat human serum with a purified recombinant enzyme that degrades L-serine,\nserine dehydrogenase (SDS), to see whether serine-depleted serum would elicit\nless growth or chemoattraction. However, SDS treatments did not alter serum\nserine content so we abandoned this approach (Fig. S5). Instead, we performed\na titration of purified L-serine and assessed its role in supporting a growth\nadvantage. We found that only a very small benefit is achieved with the\naddition of L-serine, which did not recapitulate the larger growth benefit\nseen for serum addition (Fig. 6). This leads us to believe that L-serine\nfunctions as a molecular cue that directs Salmonella toward serum, but\nnutrients present in serum other than L-serine provide the major growth\nadvantages.\n\n## Structure of S. enterica Tsr in complex with L-serine\n\nWe next undertook structural studies to understand the specific recognition of\nL-serine by Tsr. The full-length Tsr protein includes a periplasmic ligand-\nbinding domain (LBD), a transmembrane HAMP domain, and a cytosolic coiled-coil\nregion, which oligomerizes to form trimers-of-dimers, and complexes with the\ndownstream chemotaxis signaling components, CheA and CheW (Fig. 7A) ^45. No\nexperimentally-determined structure had been published for S. enterica Tsr\n(SeTsr) and the single experimentally-determined Tsr structure to have\ncaptured the L-serine-binding interactions is a crystal structure of EcTsr LBD\nof moderate resolution (2.5 \u00c5, PDB: 3ATP), in which the electron density for\nthe ligand is weak and the orientation of the L-serine ligand is ambiguous\n^46. Despite the poorly-defined binding site interactions, this EcTsr crystal\nstructure has guided numerous other studies of chemoreceptor signal\ntransduction and nanoarray function ^45,47.\n\nStructural mechanism underlying taxis to serum.

K-M.\nIsothermal titration calorimetry analyses of the SeTsr LBD with L- serine, NE,\nor DHMA.\n\nWe recognized that in the prior EcTsr study, the methods described exchanging\nthe protein crystal into a glycerol cryoprotectant. We hypothesized that\nduring the glycerol soak serine leached out of the crystal leaving the binding\nsite partially occupied and caused the electron density to be weak for the\nligand and surrounding region. To capture a complex with a fully bound ligand\nsite we grew crystals of the soluble periplasmic portion of the SeTsr LBD with\nL-serine, at a high salt concentration that would serve as a cryoprotectant\nwithout further manipulation, and harvested crystals directly from drops to\nprevent leaching of the ligand from the binding site. After conducting\nextensive crystallization trials and examining x-ray diffraction data from\nover 100 crystals, we identified a small number of SeTsr LBD crystals with\nsufficient quality for structure determination. The crystal that provided the\nhighest-quality data (2.2 \u00c5 resolution, PDB: 8FYV) was grown in a mixture of\nbuffers of pH 7.5-9.7 (refer to Methods, Table S2). To assess whether the\nbasic pH had any impact on the protein structure, we solved a second structure\nfrom a crystal grown at pH 7-7.5 (Table S2, Fig. S6, PDB: 8VL8). By overlaying\nthe two structures, it is apparent they are nearly identical, with no\nobservable changes at the ligand-binding site (Fig. S6). Because the structure\nobtained at higher pH (PDB: 8FYV) exhibits superior quality and clearer\nelectron density in critical regions of interest, it is this structure we\nrefer to in subsequent sections.\n\nThe crystal structure of SeTsr LBD contains five monomers in the asymmetric\nunit, providing five independent views of the L-serine binding site, with\nhomodimers formed between Chains A and B, C and D, and E and its crystal\nsymmetry mate, E\u2032 (Fig. 7B). Lower B-factors in the SeTsr ligand binding\nregion are indicative of greater order, reflecting that our structure is fully\nserine-bound (Fig. 7C-D). SeTsr and EcTsr possess high sequence similarity in\nthe LBD region\u2014100% identity of the ligand-binding residues and 82.1% identity\nover the entire periplasmic domain\u2014and as expected, retain a similar global\nstructure with all chains of serine- bound SeTsr (5), serine-bound EcTsr (2),\nand apo EcTsr (2) overlaying within 0.24 \u01fa rmsd over 139 C_\u03b1 (Fig. 7E).\n\n## Molecular recognition of L-serine by Tsr\n\nThe higher resolution (+0.3 \u01fa) of the SeTsr structure, and full occupancy of\nthe ligand, provide a much-improved view of the interactions that facilitate\nspecific recognition of L-serine (Fig. 7F). Using non-crystallographic\nsymmetry averaging, we leveraged the five independent SeTsr monomers to\ngenerate a well-defined 2f_o-f_c map of the L-serine ligand and residues\ninvolved in ligand coordination (Fig. 7F, Movie 6). Omit-map difference\ndensity, which is calculated in the absence of a modeled ligand and reduces\npotential bias in the electron density map, was fit well by the placement of\nthe L-serine ligand (Fig. 7F). In this orientation, the ligand is in an\noptimal energetic conformation that satisfies all possible hydrogen bonding\ninteractions: the positively- charged peptide amine donates hydrogen bonds to\nthe backbone carbonyl oxygens of Phe151, Phe152, and Gln154, the negatively-\ncharged ligand carboxyl group donates hydrogen bonds to the Arg64 guanidinium\ngroup, the Asn68 side change amine, and a water (W2), and the ligand hydroxyl\nsidechain donates a hydrogen bond to the Asn68 sidechain oxygen, and accepts a\nhydrogen bond from a water (W1) (Fig. 7F, Movie 6). All five chains of the\nSeTsr structure are consistent in the positions of the ligand and surrounding\nresidues (Fig. 7F, Movie 6).\n\nWith the aid of the improved view provided by our SeTsr structure, we noticed\nthe L-serine is positioned differently than what was modeled into the weak\ndensity of the EcTsr structure (Fig. 7G-I, Movie 6). The EcTsr structure has\nthe serine positioned with the sidechain hydroxyl facing into the pocket\ntoward Asn68, and the orientations of Asn68, Phe152, Asp153, and Gln157 of the\nligand binding pocket are modeled inconsistently, without justification,\nbetween the two EcTsr chains in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 7G-I). Calculating\nf_o-f_c omit map density for both structures shows not only that our new SeTsr\nligand orientation fits the density of our structure well, but that it is a\nbetter fit for the data from the EcTsr structure (Fig. 7H-I). This is apparent\nby how the EcTsr serine C_\u03b2 and sidechain hydroxyl are misaligned with the\ncurvature of the f_o-f_c map and that the carboxylate is partially outside of\nthe electron density (Fig. 7I).\n\nAn analysis that can quantifiably determine which positions of the serine and\nligand- binding residues result in the best model is to perform pairwise\nrefinements and compare the crystallographic R_work and R_free statistics\n(Fig. 7J). Using as our starting model the EcTsr homodimer, and its deposited\ndata from the protein databank, we performed refinements using identical\nstrategies with three scenarios: no serine modeled in the binding site (apo),\nthe published EcTsr serine pose, or the serine pose from our SeTsr structure\n(Fig. 7J). The poorest resulting EcTsr model was apo, yielding R_work/R_free\nvalues of +0.3%/+0.7% relative to the deposited model. This result supports\nthe presence of the serine ligand in the structure. Substituting the serine\nwith the pose observed in the SeTsr structure led to an improved model,\nreducing the R_work/R_free values by -0.2%/-0.2%. Lastly, we replaced both the\nserine ligand and the ligand-binding residues of the EcTsr model with those\nfrom our SeTsr structure, which resulted in the highest quality model with\nmeaningfully lower R_work/R_free values of -1.0%/-0.9% (Fig. 7J).\nConsequently, we can conclude that the correct serine pose and ligand-binding\nsite positions for both models are those we determined using the higher\nresolution SeTsr structure, in which the L- serine side chain hydroxyl faces\noutward from the pocket, toward the solvent, and every hydrogen bonding group\nof the ligand is satisfied by the residues of the binding site (Fig. 7F, J).\n\n## SeTsr LBD binds L-serine, but not NE or DHMA\n\nDespite a lack of chemotactic responses to NE and DHMA in our CIRA experiments\n(Fig. S3, Movie 5, Movie S1, Data S1), our uncertainty lingered as to whether\nthese neurotransmitters are sensed through Tsr. Prior work created theoretical\nmodels of NE and DHMA binding EcTsr at the L-serine site, and proposed this as\nthe molecular mechanism underlying E. coli chemoattraction to these compounds\n^42. However, with our new experimentally-determined SeTsr LBD crystal\nstructure in hand, it is clear that the hydrogen bonding network is specific\nfor L-serine (Fig. 7F, Movie 6), and we were doubtful such dissimilar ligands\nas NE or DHMA would be accommodated. We note that the amino acids that\nconstitute the L-serine binding pocket are identical between SeTsr and EcTsr\n(Fig. 7F-G), and so we reason that SeTsr LBD and EcTsr LBD should have similar\nmolecular functions and ligand specificity.\n\nDespite several studies reporting a direct role of Tsr in directing\nchemoattractant responses to NE and DHMA, no direct evidence of ligand-binding\nhas ever been presented. Thus, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry\n(ITC) experiments, a gold standard for measuring protein-ligand interactions,\nto study ligand recognition by SeTsr LBD (Fig. 7K-M). As expected, L-serine\nproduces a robust exothermic binding curve, exhibiting a K_D of approximately\n5 \u03bcM (Fig. 7K). This matches well with our observation of S. enterica\nchemoattraction requiring a source of L-serine at least 0.5-5 \u03bcM (Fig. 5D-E)\nand with prior ITC data with EcTsr LBD, which also reported a 5 \u03bcM K_D ^46.\nConversely, neither NE nor DHMA showed any evidence of binding to SeTsr LBD\n(Fig. 7L-M). These data confirm that SeTsr is a receptor for L-serine, and not\nNE or DHMA, and further support the molecular mechanism of Tsr-mediated serum\nattraction to be through L-serine.\n\n## Relevance of bacterial taxis to serum in other systems\n\nOur chemotaxis experiments with the tsr strain show that while Tsr is not the\nonly chemoreceptor involved in taxis to serum for S. enterica, it does play an\nimportant role through chemoattraction to the high concentration of L-serine\nwithin serum. We hypothesized that attraction to serum, mediated through Tsr,\nmight extend beyond S. enterica to other bacterial species. The biological\ndistribution of Tsr chemoreceptors has not been previously characterized, so\nwe applied our structural insights to define a motif consisting of the amino\nacids involved in L-serine recognition. When we analyzed the genomes of\nEnterobacteriaceae genera such as Escherichia, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter\nwe found their Tsr orthologues to possess this motif (Fig. 8A). We next\nconducted a comprehensive search for chemoreceptor genes containing the L-\nserine recognition motif, creating a database containing all organisms that\npossess putative Tsr orthologues (Fig. 8B, Data S2). The biological\ndistribution of Tsr reveals the chemoreceptor to be widely conserved among\nGammaproteobacteria, particularly within the families Enterobacteriaceae,\nMorganelliaceae, and Yersiniaceae (Fig. 8B). We discovered that many WHO\npriority pathogens are among the species that have Tsr, leading us to suspect\nthese pathogens and pathobionts also perform serum taxis.\n\nRelevance of bacterial vampirism in other systems.

AUC quantification of bacterial lesions localization shown\nin panel L (0-225 \u03bcM). Effect size (Cohen\u2019s d) is noted. Data shown are means\nand error bars show SEM.\n\nTo address this question, we performed CIRA analyses with human serum and the\nbacterial strains E. coli MG1655 and C. koseri BAA-895, the latter being a\nclinical isolate with previously uncharacterized chemotactic behavior. We find\nthat both these strains exhibit attraction to human serum on time scales and\nmagnitudes similar to experiments with Salmonella (Fig. 8C-E, Movies S2-S3).\nWithout further genetic analyses in these strain backgrounds, the evidence for\nTsr mediating serum taxis for these bacteria remains circumstantial.\nNevertheless, taxis to serum appears to be a behavior shared by diverse\nEnterobacteriaceae species and perhaps also Gammaproteobacteria priority\npathogen genera that possess Tsr such as Serratia, Providencia, Morganella,\nand Proteus (Fig. 8B).\n\nSo far, our focus has been on bacterial taxis towards human serum. However,\ngiven the presence of L-serine in the serum of various animal species, we were\ninterested in exploring if serum from other mammals could also attract\nbacteria. We prepared horse serum from whole horse blood through clotting and\ncentrifugation to use in CIRA experiments with S. Typhimurium IR715. Similar\nto human serum, the bacterial population rapidly swam toward the horse serum\nsource, with the relative number of cells in close proximity to the source\nnearly doubling within 120 seconds of exposure (Fig. 8F). To further\ninvestigate this concept, we utilized serum we collected from a third species,\na single domestic pig. The data revealed that pig serum similarly induces a\nrapid attraction of S. Typhimurium (Fig. 8G). This suggests that the\nphenomenon of serum attraction is relevant to diverse host-microbe systems and\nis not specific to bacteria associated with humans. Considering the data from\nall CIRA experiments, while some differences are observed in strain responses\nto serum sources (S. enterica serovars, E. coli, and C. koseri) and serum from\ndifferent animals (human, horse, and pig), all WT strains examined share the\nbehavior of rapid taxis towards serum.\n\nAs a preliminary investigation into whether serum taxis is involved in\nbacterial pathogenesis, we developed an enterohemorrhagic lesion model to\ninvestigate if chemotaxis and Tsr can mediate bloodstream entry. We found that\npig serum stimulates pathogen attraction (Fig. 8G), and swine recapitulate\nmany aspects of human gastrointestinal physiology ^48, so we utilized swine\ncolonic tissue from the same animal for ex vivo experimentation (Fig. 8H). We\ncreated an enterohemorrhagic lesion by a single lance of the tissue\nvasculature from the mucosal side, and then exposed the wound to a 1:1 mixture\nof motile S. Typhimurium IR715 WT and chemotaxis mutant (Fig. 8H-I). Following\n30 minutes of exposure, the localization of the bacteria in proximity to the\nlesion was determined through fluorescence microscopy and enumerated as a\ncompetitive index of WT vs. mutant. By imaging through the z-plane in five-\nmicron intervals we were also able to quantify bacterial colonization as a\nfunction of wound depth. In the context of this ex vivo model, we observed\nthat the bacteria were readily able to penetrate >200 \u03bcm into the wounded\nvasculature (Fig. 8J-M). Strikingly, the WT efficiently localizes toward, and\nmigrates into, the hemorrhagic lesion, outcompeting the cheY and tsr mutants\nby approximately 10:1 and 2:1 (Fig. 8J-M). These results align with our other\ndata indicating that serum taxis requires CheY, and that Tsr contributes, but\nis not the only chemoreceptor involved in mediating attraction. Additional\ninvestigation is required to confirm the occurrence of these behaviors during\ninfection, but it seems plausible that bacterial taxis toward sources of serum\nin the host gut environment occurs, potentially contributing to the\ndevelopment of bacteremia.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe most common outcome for gastrointestinal bacterial infections is that they\nare resolved by the immune system without chronic infection or lingering\npathologies (Fig. 1). To understand why, in rare circumstances, infections do\npersist, become chronic, systemic, and life-threatening, we must uncover the\nmechanisms at the crossroads where pathogens divert from the routine course of\ninfection and do something unusual. An emerging area of interest in the axis\nof gut- microbe health is how the behavior of gut microbes can shift in\nresponse to inflammation, antibiotic usage, and pathogen invasion, into a\nstate of dysbiosis recalcitrant to treatment ^15,49\u201351. We can learn about the\nfactors that stimulate microbial-induced pathologies by studying how bacteria\nrespond to host-derived stimuli that are unique to the diseased gut ^51. Here,\nwe have investigated how bacterial chemosensing functions to respond to a\nsource of serum, a chemical feature enteric bacteria only encounter in the\nevent of GI bleeding.\n\nWe demonstrated that serum from humans and other animals contains components\nthat act as chemoattractants and nutrients for Enterobacteriaceae known as\ninstigators of enteric bleeding and causal agents of bacteremia and sepsis\n(Fig. 2-3, Fig. 6, Fig. 8). Bacterial infiltration of wounded enteric\nvasculature, mediated by chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr, suggests serum\nattraction plays a role in the bloodstream entry of these bacterial species.\nIn a broader context, the attraction of Enterobacteriaceae to serum aligns\nwith an emerging understanding of how bacterial chemotaxis can drive tropism\nfor sites of damaged tissue, injury, and inflammation (Fig. 1) ^3,23,52\u201356.\nThis phenomenon of bacterial attraction to serum through chemotaxis to access\nserum nutrients represents a novel pathogenesis strategy, which we term\n\u2018bacterial vampirism\u2019 (Fig. 9).\n\nModel of bacterial vampirism. Serum contains high concentrations of L-Ser, and\nother chemoattractants, that are recognized by chemoreceptors, including Tsr,\nto drive Enterobacteriaceae taxis toward serum. Taxis to serum promotes\ncolonization of enterohemorrhagic lesions and provides a bacterial growth\nadvantage from nutrients acquired from serum. The bacterial behavior of\nseeking and feeding on serum, which we have defined as \u201cbacterial vampirism\u201d\nmay represent a risk factor for bacterial entry into the bloodstream.\n\n## A new ecological context for L-serine chemoattraction\n\nWe show here that the bacterial attraction response to serum is robust and\nrapid; the motile population reorganizes within 1-2 minutes of serum exposure\nto be significantly biased toward the serum source (Fig. 2, Fig. 8). Serum\ntaxis occurs through the cooperative action of multiple bacterial\nchemoreceptors that perceive several chemoattractant stimuli within serum, one\nof these being the chemoreceptor Tsr through recognition of L-serine (Fig. 4).\nWhile Tsr is known as a bacterial sensor of L-serine ^3,45,57, the\nphysiological sources of L-serine in the gut sensed by Tsr have not been well-\ndefined. Although a major source is dietary, recent research has suggested\nthat L-serine from damaged tissue may play a significant role in the diseased\ngut environment and drive opportunistic pathogenesis. In a study using a\ndextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis model to investigate L-serine utilization\nby Enterobacteriaceae, L-serine was identified as a critical nutrient\nproviding metabolic and growth advantages in the inflamed gut ^51. Moreover,\ncolitis was found to stimulate substantial increases in the luminal\navailability of most amino acids, with the average serine content nearly\ndoubling ^51. A notable characteristic of the DSS- colitis model is intestinal\nbleeding ^58, suggesting that the enrichment of amino acids, including serine,\ncould be attributed to the leakage of host metabolites from serum. The ability\nof pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae to exploit growth advantages from L-serine\nduring colitis may be linked to their highly sensitive and rapid\nchemoattraction to this effector emitted from human serum.\n\nOur structural and molecular investigations into S. enterica Tsr affirm its\nrole as a serine sensor, revealing a highly optimized and selective ligand-\nbinding site for the recognition of L- serine (Fig. 7, Movie 6). Although the\nhost-derived metabolites NE and DHMA have been reported to be chemoattractants\nfor E. coli sensed directly through Tsr, we were unable to corroborate these\nresults in S. Typhimurium in chemotaxis experiments, nor binding assays with\nthe purified recombinant LBD, despite the high sequence conservation between\nthe two orthologues (Fig. S3, Fig. 7L-M, Fig. 8A, Data S1). Our inability to\nsubstantiate a structure- function relationship for NE/DHMA signaling\nindicates these neurotransmitters are not ligands of Tsr, or, at the very\nleast, are not broadly relevant as chemoeffectors sensed through Tsr\northologues. In contrast, we saw that L-serine drove chemoattraction to a\nsource as low as 500 nM, all strains tested were attracted to L-Ser, a binding\nK_D to SeTsr LBD of 5 \u03bcM was established through ITC, and was captured in\ncomplex in the SeTsr LBD crystal structure with clearly-defined electron\ndensity (Fig. 5, Fig. 7). Our study is not the only one to raise questions\nregarding the physiological relevance of NE/DHMA as chemoattractants. A study\nexamining E. coli sensing of NE/DHMA by Tsr showed little chemoattraction\noccurs in the range of 10-100 \u03bcM, and at higher (millimolar) concentrations a\nchemorepulsion response was observed ^59. Notably, the concentrations required\nin the latter study to observe a chemotactic response are far above what is\nthought to be physiologically relevant for tissue or serum ^60. Given that\ntreatment of serum with serine racemase diminishes taxis toward serum and\neliminates the WT taxis advantage over tsr (Fig. S3), our data support that\nL-serine is the chemoattractant sensed through Tsr that confers serum\nattraction.\n\nAn unanticipated result from obtaining the first structures of SeTsr LBD (PDB:\n8FYV) is that the well-resolved ligand-binding site contradicts key\ninteractions as they were modeled in the earlier EcTsr LBD structure (3ATP),\napparently owing to the difficulty of interpreting the weak electron density\n(Fig. 7F-I). Through comparative refinements, we show that changing the ligand\nposition and binding site residues of the EcTsr LBD model to be as they are in\nthe SeTsr LBD structure demonstrably improves the model (Fig. 7J). Therefore,\nthe differences in the models are not attributable to them being two different\nproteins, rather the EcTsr LBD structure is modeled incorrectly, and both\nstructures should be modeled with the serine pose and ligand- binding site as\nthey are in the SeTsr LBD structure (Fig. 7F). The EcTsr LBD structure has\ninformed the creation of full-length atomic models of Tsr, and the core\nsignaling unit, for use in molecular simulations and fitting of cryo-EM data\n^45,47,61. Since we now have in hand a higher resolution and better-resolved\nTsr crystal structure, future studies of this sort should benefit from the\nimproved understanding of L-serine recognition. The SeTsr LBD structure was\nalso helpful in accurately defining the signature motif of Tsr orthologues,\nwhich allowed us to mine genomic databases and report the first extensive\ncharacterization of which bacterial species possess this chemoreceptor (Fig.\n8A-B). From this database of Tsr sequences we were able to visualize the\ndistribution of Tsr orthologues across biology, which strikingly are enriched\namong Enterobacteriaceae, but are also present in several other families that\ninclude WHO priority pathogens (Fig. 8B, Data S2). This analysis confirms that\nthe bacterial species most commonly associated with bacteremia in patients\nwith IBD possess the Tsr chemoreceptor (Fig. 8B, Data S2) ^25.\n\nIn the context of Salmonella pathogenesis, it is interesting to note that\ndiverse serovars, which vary in terms of host specificity and epidemiology,\nexhibit serum attraction and have the ability to utilize serum as a nutrient\n(Fig. 3, Fig. 6). The specific nutrients responsible for the growth benefits\nderived from serum remain undefined, however, one potential candidate is the\npresence of energy-rich glycoconjugates, which were previously implicated as\nnutrients for bacteria within the inflamed intestine based on the upregulation\nof galactose utilization operons and the prevalence of lectin-positive stained\ntissue ^62. Enteric Peyer\u2019s patches are primary invasion sites for non-\ntyphoidal Salmonella, and these structures are situated close to vasculature\nthat can be damaged through the pathogen\u2019s destruction of microfold (M) cells,\ncausing localized bleeding ^63. S. enterica Typhimurium uses the chemoreceptor\nTsr to locate and invade Peyer\u2019s patches ^32, which could involve L-serine\nchemoattraction originating from serum or necrotic cells. Although GI bleeding\nis relatively uncommon in Salmonella infections overall, it afflicts 60% of\ninfected children under the age of five ^64. Therefore, while we acknowledge\nthat serum attraction is not a routine pathogenesis strategy employed by\nSalmonella, the significant number of bacterial-induced GI bleeding cases, and\nthe association between GI bleeding and bacterial invasion into the\nbloodstream, provide opportunities for bacterial vampirism to be involved in\ninfection outcomes (Fig. 9) ^24,27,65.\n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n## Resource availability\n\n### Lead contact\n\nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed\nto and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Arden Baylink\n(arden.baylink@wsu.edu).\n\n### Materials availability\n\nStrains and plasmids generated in this study will be made available upon\nrequest by the Lead Contact with a completed Materials Transfer Agreement.\n\n### Data availability\n\nThe crystal structures of L-serine-bound SeTsr LBD are deposited to the\nprotein databank as PDB: 8FYV and 8VL8. Any additional information required to\nreanalyze the data reported in this paper is available from the Lead Contact\nupon request.\n\n## Experimental model and subject details\n\n### Bacterial strains\n\nStrains of S. enterica, E. coli, and C. koseri used in this study are\ndescribed in Table S1. To generate fluorescent strains, electrically-competent\nbacterial cultures were prepared through successive washing of cells with ice-\ncold 10% glycerol, and then transformed by electroporation (Biorad GenePulser\nXcell) with pxS vectors containing either sfGFP, or mPlum, and AmpR genes ^66.\nTransformants were isolated through growth on selective media and stored as\nglycerol stocks for subsequent use. To prepare motile bacterial cells for CIRA\nexperiments, bacterial cultures were grown shaking overnight in 2-5 ml\ntryptone broth (TB) and 50 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin (TB+Amp) at 30\u00b0 C or 37\u00b0 C, as\nneeded. The following day, 25 \u03bcl of overnight culture was used to inoculated\n25 ml of fresh TB+Amp and grown shaking for 3-5 hours at the desired\ntemperature to reach A_600 of approximately 0.5. To better isolate responses\nto effectors of interest and remove confounding variables, such as pH\nvariation and quorum-signaling molecules, we washed and exchanged the cells\ninto a buffer of defined composition. Bacterial cultures were centrifuged at\n1,500 g for 20 minutes and exchanged into a chemotaxis buffer (CB) containing\n10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), 10 mM sodium lactate, and 100 \u03bcM EDTA.\nCultures were diluted to approximately A_600 0.2 (or as indicated in figure\nlegends) and allowed to recover rocking gently for 30-60 minutes to become\nfully motile.\n\nFor in vitro growth analyses, S. enterica strains were grown in Luria-Bertani\n(LB) media shaking overnight at 37\u00b0 C. The following day, cultures were\npelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a minimal media (MM) containing\n47 mM Na_2HPO_4, 22 mM KH_2PO_4, 8 mM NaCl, 2mM MgSO_4, 0.4% glucose (w/v)\n11.35 mM (NH_4)_2SO_4, 100 \u03bcM CaCl_2. 5 \u03bcl of the overnight cultures at 0.05\nA_600 were used to inoculate fresh solutions of 200 \u03bcl of MM, or additives\ndiluted into MM (human serum or L-serine), in a 96-well microtiter plate. A\nplate reader was used to monitor cell growth while shaking at 37\u00b0 via A_600\nreadings every 5 minutes.\n\n## Method details\n\n### Chemosensory injection rig assay (CIRA)\n\nOur CIRA system is based on prior work, with several notable changes to\nmethodology, as described ^5,6,67. The CIRA apparatus was constructed using a\npump for injection (either a refurbished Eppendorf Transjector 5246 or\nFemtojet 4i) and universal capillary holder, with solutions injected through\nFemtotip II glass microcapillaries (Eppendorf), and the microcapillary\nposition controlled with a MP-285 micromanipulator (Sutter) at a 30\u00b0 angle of\nattack. To generate a microgradient, a constant flow from the microcapillary\nwas induced by applying compensation pressure (P_c) of 35 hPa, unless\notherwise specified. The stability of the microgradient under these conditions\nwas determined with Alexa488 dye (ThermoFisher), and the flow was determined\nempirically with methylene blue dye to be approximately 300 femtoliters per\nminute at 30\u00b0 C (Fig. S1). Pooled off-the-clot human serum was obtained from\nInnovative Research; human serum was deidentified and had no additional\nchemical additives and is presumed to be fully active. Horse serum was\nprepared from whole horse blood from Innovative Research. Pig serum was\nprepared from whole blood collected from a single animal. Treatment solutions\nwere filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter and injected as-is (serum) or diluted in\nCB (serine, aspartate, NE, DHMA). Serine racemase treatment of human serum was\nperformed with the addition of 5 \u03bcl of proprietary serine racemase solution\nfrom a DL-serine assay kit (Abcam) to 1 ml of serum for 3 h. For each CIRA\nexperiment, a fresh pond of 50 \u03bcl of motile bacteria was mounted open to air\non a 10-well slide (MP Biomedicals), and the microcapillary containing the\ntreatment of interest was lowered into the pond. Bacterial responses were\nimaged with an inverted Nikon Ti2 Eclipse microscope with an enclosed heated\nsample chamber. Temperature of experiments were at 37 \u00b0C, unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n### CIRA microgradient modeling\n\nDiffusion is modeled as a 3D process in which the diffusive species is slowly\nand continuously introduced at a fixed point in a large ambient fluid volume.\nThe species to be injected is prepared at concentration M_s (typically in the\nrange of 0.5 \u03bcM-5 mM) and is injected at a volume rate Q = 305.5 fl/min. The\nspecies diffuses into the ambient fluid with diffusion constant D. The\ngoverning equation for the diffusion of a species introduced continuously at a\npoint source is:\n\nwhere r is the distance from the point source, t, is the time from injection\ninitiation, and q = M_sQ is the injection rate of the species, and C is the\nspecies concentration. We can simplify the presentation by defining a\ncharacteristic length scale r_0,\u201c, characteristic time t_0,\u201d, and\ndimensionless variables as:\n\nThen, we have the diffusion-driven concentration model:\n\nRepresentative diffusion coefficients are: A488, 4.00\u00d710^\u22126cm^2/s; L-serine,\n8.71 \u00d7 10^\u22126cm^2/s; L-aspartate, 9.35\u00d710^\u22126cm^6/s. Due to the small injection\nrate, our assumption of a point source leads to a model that is valid at\ndistances, r \u226b r_0 \u223c nm and times t \u226b t_0 \u223c 1 ns. We also consider the total\nspecies quantity integrated along a viewing direction. The result is:\n\nwhere is the unitless integration variable along the viewing direction. This\nintegral was evaluated numerically by considering the sequence of points for ,\n- 1,2,3,... and, some small interval. Then, we have the discrete integral\napproximation:\n\nComputations for this work used 1 \u03bcm steps extending out to r = 500 \u03bcm. That\nis,, and .N = 500.\n\n### Ex vivo swine hemorrhagic lesion model\n\nSwine intestinal tissue was procured from a single 8-week-old farm-reared\nanimal (the same animal from which serum was drawn), in accordance with\nWashington State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and\nInstitutional Biosafety Committee approval. Intact colonic tissue was excised,\nand an incision was made along its length to flatten the tissue and expose the\nmucosa. Sections of tissue approximately 2.5 square centimeters in size were\nprepared for experimentation through gentle washing with saline solution,\nfollowed by CB, to remove fecal contents and debris. A sterile Gawal Sharp\nPoint was used to lance the vasculature to generate a model enterohemorrhagic\nlesion. The lesion site was positioned in a MatTek dish over a pond of 50 \u03bcl\nof motile bacterial cells (1:1 fluorescently-tagged WT and mutant in CB, at a\ntotal A_600 of 1.0). After 30 minutes, bacterial localization into the lesion\nwas visualized using an inverted Nikon Ti2 Eclipse microscope. Images were\ncaptured at 20x magnification proceeding through the Z-plane in 5 \u03bcm\nintervals.\n\n### Cloning and recombinant protein expression\n\nCloning of the S. enterica Tsr LBD construct for recombinant protein\nexpression was performed as a service by Genscript Biotech Corp. The sequence\nof the periplasmic portion of the ligand- binding domain of S. enterica\nTyphimurium Tsr (gene STM4533), corresponding to residues 32- 187 of the full-\nlength protein, was encoded into a pet-30a(+) vector (Tsr-LBD-pet-30a(+)), at\nthe NdeI and HindIII sites, with a short N-terminal TEV cleavage tag (MENLYFQ)\nsuch that the final expressed protein sequence was:\n\nMENLYFQSLKNDKENFTVLQTIRQQQSALNATWVELLQTRNTLNRAGIRWMMDQSNIG\nSGATVAELMQGATNTLKLTEKNWEQYEALPRDPRQSEAAFLEIKRTYDIYHGALAELIQ\nLLGAGKINEFFDQPTQSYQDAFEKQYMAYMQQNDRLYDIAVEDNNS\n\nChemically-competent Rosetta BL21(DE3) E. coli (Millipore Sigma) were\ntransformed by heat shock with the Tsr-LBD-pet-30a(+) vector, and\ntransformants identified by growth on selective media containing 20 \u03bcg/ml\n(LB+Kan). Cells were grown overnight in 5 ml LB+Kan. The following day, 1 ml\nof overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 L of fresh LB+Kan, and cultures\nwere grown to OD_600 0.6-0.8 and induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl\n\u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After growth for 3 H at 37\u00b0 C cells, were\nharvested by centrifugation.\n\n### Purification of recombinant SeTsr LBD\n\nThe cell pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH\n7.5, 0.1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mg DNAse I, and 1 cOmplete protease inhibitor\ntablet per 1 L of culture (Sigma Aldrich), and cells were lysed by sonication.\nAfter, the lysate was kept on ice and adjusted to 20 % ammonium sulfate\nsaturation and stirred at 4\u00b0 C for 30 minutes. Lysate was centrifuged at\n15,000 rpm for 30 minutes in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The soluble fraction\nwas retained, and an ammonium precipitation trial was conducted; the 20-40%\nfraction contained the majority of the Tsr LBD protein and was used for\nsubsequent purification. The protein solution was dialyzed for 16 hours\nagainst 4 L of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA, then run over\nan anion exchange column and FPLC (Akta). The purest fractions were pooled and\ntreated with 0.3 mg/ml TEV protease, and the protein solution was dialyzed\nagainst 4 L of 50 mM Tris pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EDTA for 48 h at 4\u00b0 C.\nSubsequently, the cleaved protein solution was exchanged into a buffer of 50\nmM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 150mM NaCl, and purified by gel filtration with\nan S200 column and FPLC. Pure protein fractions were pooled, concentrated to 7\nmg/ml, and flash frozen in liquid N_2.\n\n### Protein crystallography\n\nInitial crystallization trials of SeTsr LBD were performed with either TEV-\ncleaved or uncleaved protein samples at 7 mg/ml with +/- 2 mM L-serine and\nusing 96-well matrix screens set up with a Mosquito robot (SPT Labtech). We\nonly observed crystal hits with the cleaved, serine-treated crystals, the best\nof which was 0.056 M sodium phosphate, 1.344 M potassium phosphate, pH 8.2.\nThis condition was further optimized to be 1.5 \u03bcl SeTsr LBD protein (7 mg/ml),\n0.5 \u03bcl of 8 mM L-serine, and 1.5 \u03bcl 1.69 M potassium phosphate pH 9.7, grown\nvia hanging drop vapor diffusion with a 1 ml reservoir of 1.69 M potassium\nphosphate pH 9.7 at 22\u00b0 C. Crystals were scooped directly from drops and flash\nfrozen in liquid N_2. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Berkeley\nAdvanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 5.0.3. Out of over 100 crystals examined,\nonly one diffracted to high resolution and was not impacted by crystal\ntwinning. Data were indexed with DIALS ^68, scaled with Aimless ^69, and found\nto correspond well to space group C2_1. A conservative final resolution cutoff\nof 2.2 \u00c5 was applied on the basis of CC_1/2 >0.3 and completeness >50% in the\nhighest resolution shell ^70.\n\nThe serine-bound EcTsr structure (PDB: 3ATP) was utilized as a molecular\nreplacement search model with Phaser-MR in Phenix ^71 to solve the SeTsr LBD\ndataset with five monomers in the asymmetric unit. 10% of the data were\ndesignated as R_free flags and the initial model was adjusted by setting all\nB-factors to 30 \u00c5^2 and coordinates were randomized by 0.05 \u00c5 to reduce bias\nfrom the starting model. Subsequent model building with Coot ^72 and\nrefinement with Phenix enabled placement of residues 42-182 and the serine\nligand. However, residues 32-41 and 183-187 could not be resolved and were not\nmodeled, causing the R/R_free values to be elevated for a model of this\nresolution. Riding hydrogen atoms and translation, libration, screw refinement\nwere applied and reduced R factors. The strongest remaining difference peak is\nalong a symmetry axis. The final model R/R_free values were 24.1/25.8 %, with\na 99^th percentile all-atom MolProbity clashscore, and a 100^th percentile\noverall MolProbity score ^73.\n\nBecause the protein was in a buffer at pH 7.5, but the crystallization\nsolution was at 9.7, there was uncertainty about the true pH of the\ncrystalline sample and how this might impact ligand binding interactions. As a\ncontrol, we crystallized the protein in a mother liquor of 1.62 M potassium\nphosphate pH 7, with 0.5 \u03bcl of 3 mM L-serine, at 22\u00b0 C. Solution of this\nstructure revealed no remarkable differences in the ligand binding\ninteractions or in the global structure (Fig. S6). The data quality suffered\nfrom ice rings, resulting in maps with high noise, and so we restricted\nrefinement to a conservative 2.5 \u01fa cutoff. Crystallographic statistics for\nthese structures are listed in Table S2. The pH 7.5-9.7 and pH 7-7.5\nstructures were deposited to the protein data bank as entries 8FYV and 8VL8,\nrespectively. On the basis of the higher quality maps, and stronger and more\nclearly interpreted electron density, we recommend structure 8FYV for use in\nfuture structural studies of SeTsr.\n\nFor comparisons of model quality between SeTsr LBD (8FYV) with EcTsr (3ATP),\nwe re-refined 3ATP with its deposited data using rigid body refinement to\nobtain a starting model for subsequent evaluation. Then, we performed a series\nof restrained refinements with Phenix using identical R_free flags and\nidentical strategy of five cycles of xyz reciprocal space, xyz real space,\nindividual isotropic B-factor, adp weight optimization, and stereochemistry\nweight optimization. For these refinements we used the EcTsr LBD structure +/-\nthe following modifications: (1) the deposited L-Ser present, (2) the\ndeposited L-Ser removed (apo), (3) the L- Ser replaced by the SeTsr L-Ser\nligand, or (4) both the L-Ser and the ligand binding site residues replaced by\nthose from the SeTsr LBD structure. These comparisons show the best model, as\nevidenced by meaningfully reduced R_work and R_free values, is obtained with\nthe position of the L- Ser and ligand binding residues from the higher\nresolved SeTsr LBD structure (Fig. 7J).\n\n### Isothermal titration calorimetry ligand binding studies (ITC)\n\nITC experiments were performed in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5,\nat 25 \u00b0C. We dialyzed the protein into the experimental buffer and dissolved\nthe small molecule ligands into the same buffer. Protein concentrations were\n\u223c50 \u03bcM; titrant concentrations were 500 \u03bcM. Samples were degassed prior to\nexperiments. All experiments were performed on a MicroCal ITC-200 system (GE\nHealthcare), with the gain set to \u201clow\u201d and a syringe stir speed of 750 rpm.\nTitration data for the serine experiments were fit to a single-site binding\nmodel using the built-in ITC analysis software.\n\n### Mass Spectrometry\n\nDetermination of molar content of total serine in human serum samples was\nperformed as a service through the University of Washington Mass Spectrometry\nCenter. Samples were analyzed on the Waters TQ #1 instrument using a Thermo\nHypersil Gold PFP column (2.1 x 100) with 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA)\nin water and acetonitrile.\n\n## Quantification and statistical analysis\n\n### Quantification of CIRA data\n\nTo determine relative numbers of cells over time, a ratio of fluorescence\nintensity per cell was calculated using ImageJ. Fluorescence intensity was\nused as a readout of relative cell count over time using the \u2018plot profile\u2019\nfunction in ImageJ ^74. Cell numbers were normalized to a baseline of \u201c100 %\u201d\nat the start of treatment (shown as time 0). Distribution of the bacterial\npopulation was quantified through use of the \u2018radial profile\u2019 ImageJ plugin.\nRadial distribution data were normalized by setting the field of view\nperiphery as the baseline of \u201c1-fold,\u201d which we defined as 240 \u03bcm distance\nfrom the source. Images and videos shown were processed using the \u2018enhance\ncontrast\u2019 function in ImageJ and adjusting intensity thresholds to normalize\nfluorescence intensity per cell across channels. For experiments with non-\nfluorescent cells, equivalent procedures were performed using phase contrast\ndata and enumeration of cells over time using a Matlab-based tracking software\n^6.\n\n### Statistical Analyses\n\nData from replicate experiments were averaged and interpreted on the basis of\ntheir mean, standard error of the mean, and effect sizes. Effect sizes for\ndata are indicated as Cohen\u2019s d value:\n\nwhere:\n\nWhere relevant, p-values were calculated using either one-sided or unpaired\ntwo-sided tests, with significance determined at p<0.05:\n\nwhere:\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nFunding for this work was provided by NIAID under award numbers 1K99AI148587\nand 4R00AI148587-03, and startup funding from Washington State University to\nAB.

Panels\nH-I utilized cells that were primed with 5 \u03bcM NE for 3 hours prior to\nexperimentation.\n\nCalculation of L-serine source required for half-maximal chemoattraction\nresponse (K_1/2). Data are mean AUC values of relative number of bacteria\nwithin 150 \u03bcm of the treatment location for the -15 s \u2013 250 s range,\nrepresented as fold-change. Data are fit with an exponential curve (red line):\n\nWhere a=2.636193, b =-1.616338, and c=0.006282888. K_1/2 is approximated to be\n105 \u03bcm (x, dashed lines).\n\nTotal serine present in human serum samples, as determined by mass\nspectrometry. Treatment with 50 \u03bcg recombinant serine dehydratase (SDS) over 4\nh did not decrease serine content in human serum.\n\nComparison of SeTsr LBD structures solved at different pH. Shown left is an\noverlay of SeTsr at pH 7.5-9.7 (PDB: 8FYV, dark blue) and pH 7-7.5 (PDBL 8VL8,\nlight blue). Shown right is a stereo image of the overlaid L-Ser binding site\nwith electron density shown for the pH 7-7.5 structure as blue mesh.\n\n# Supplementary Movies\n\nMovie S1.
