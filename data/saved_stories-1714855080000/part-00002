You may\njudge me as naive for thinking like this, but I was truly into Gitpod\u2019s\nmission and culture that anything outside of the bubble just didn\u2019t make\nsense.\n\nNeedless to say, it\u2019s been quite a ride these last few weeks and I learned a\nlot.\n\n## All or nothing\n\nThree weeks ago, I made a difficult decision which I expressed openly on\nTwitter. I declined an incredible opportunity to build out community\nprogrammes for a company I\u2019ve long loved and respected in the wider tech\nworld.\n\nIt was great for my career, sure, but for me I felt strongly that I needed and\nmost importantly, wanted to be part of the Gitpod team \u201cuntil the end\u201d.\nDeclining the offer felt hard, but I\u2019d done this many times in the past three\nyears as I showed loyalty to the kumquats.\n\n\ud83c\udf31 This was definitely a lesson I had to learn the hard way: when it comes to\ncareer, you should take the roles that matter most to you, and not be afraid\nof \u201cletting down\u201d a group you feel loyal to.\n\n## Being let go\n\nWe had just got back from an incredible offsite in Lofer, Austria \u2013 a place\nwhich started to feel like another home \u2013 I truly felt re-energised and re-\naligned with the company and team. There were conversations on upcoming\nprojects that I personally felt would use my superpowers well and would bring\nGitpod to the hands of users and customers faster.\n\nThe following events that happened was not something I could have predicted,\nbut hey, there\u2019s always a first for everything! \ud83e\udd37\n\nI had some minor disagreements with a team member on upcoming projects. This\nis completely normal as I know first-hand how everyone is passionate about\ntheir craft as well as doing what\u2019s best for the company.\n\nI proudly stood my ground as previously I\u2019ve not been the type to, and\ncontinued doing my best work, planning to improve my project\u2019s outcome.\nPersonal growth!\n\nI relayed the discussions on the project disagreements to others in the\ncompany, was told to wait for feedback, then a few days later found myself on\nthe other side of an extremely difficult conversation: being let go.\n\nThese two events may not be correlated, I never got the feedback (I guess it\ndidn\u2019t matter) but it still stung regardless.\n\nThe actual diplomatic reason I was given was on the basis of \u201cnot having a\nplace at Gitpod anymore\u201d. I knew community was no longer a priority, so I\nspent the last six months working hard to excel as a Developer Advocate\nsupporting prospect and customer conversations. I shipped a number of\ntechnical content and had received good feedback \u2014 nothing indicating this was\nperformance based.\n\nIn the moment, I chose to accept it. I got tired of being a square peg in a\nround hole, desperately trying to make things work.\n\nThe decision of my termination was already done anyway, and there was nothing\nleft to discuss.\n\n\ud83c\udf31 I learned another important lesson that day: business is business. It\u2019s not\npersonal. Companies have to make decisions like these sometimes, and that\u2019s\njust how it is.\n\n## In the name of being honest\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m an emotional person.\n\nI used to apologize for it, but I learned that there is space for my\n\u201csoftness\u201d in business. Immediately after being let go, I surprised myself\nbecause I didn\u2019t cry as I expected. Instead, I just sat there, opened up a\nfresh document and brain dumped my immediate next steps.\n\nThat is until the following day I jumped on a few calls with colleagues. I\nlearned that others had also been let go. My heart was crushed for them and\nall at once similar feelings I felt from last year\u2019s layoffs hit me again.\n\nFor the last three years, I poured my full heart and soul into the company so\nI allowed myself to be upset, even if it was just a few hours.\n\nThen it was back to work...!\n\nI had stuff to do, people (my colleagues) to help and the world right beneath\nmy feet.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nOnce the announcement made the internal channel, my DMs flooded with messages\nfrom shocked colleagues who expressed their sadness and mutual \u201csee you\nlater!\u201ds but never goodbyes.\n\n> \u201cI am in so much shock over the news. Gitpod without Pauline...wow. It\u2019s\n> rare to meet people with so much passion. I know your next journey will be\n> nothing short of exciting.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThank you for everything you\u2019ve done to make Gitpod more human, relay the\n> energy from our async company and our product back to the real world, real\n> people and real users by giving it a face!\u201d\n\n> \u201cPlease know that you\u2019ll be dearly missed here. Your presence has really\n> enriched our workplace. But as one chapter ends, another begins, and I have\n> no doubt that your next adventure will be nothing short of extraordinary.\u201d\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m sad and confused. I always thought you\u2019d be around for a long time. I\n> really hope this is not goodbye.\u201d\n\nEven though I was upset, as well as the other 27 emotions, I asked the\nquestions: What did I learn? How much did I grow? Which are the good memories\nI want to keep?\n\nI quickly listed:\n\n  * Gitpod gave me a platform to grow my personal brand and make a name for myself\n  * I had full autonomy to do the role of my dreams\n  * I got to spend three years learning alongside the smartest minds and kindest humans, some I get to call my friends today\n  * I had the opportunity to lead my own team and became the people manager of two of the brightest people I\u2019ve ever worked with\n  * I shipped incredible work from community building, educational videos to organizing conferences and 15+ meet-ups with 300+ participants globally from zero \u2013 all of which are still referenced as \u201cthe playbook\u201d to me in conversations with folks\n  * The work I shipped directly enabled Gitpod to secure their Series A\n  * I was the MC to a conference I organized in under a month. Yeah, you read that right.\n  * I re-connected with my platform engineering roots, shipped a Backstage plugin and authored a number of technical blog posts and guides that are still shared with prospects and customers today.\n  * I went to four KubeCons and one Open Source Summit where I had the joy to talk to users and community about the CDE revolution in person (as well as laugh at my face on the screens showing videos I created)\n  * I got to embrace asynchronous remote work, making the most of it with my digital nomad lifestyle, and traveled the world (I went to San Francisco! Yeah, the one from the movies!)\n  * I grew in lots of different ways from my confidence, communication, resilience to decision making. Just not in height.\n  * I can now go out into the market, take on new challenges and further my career\n  * ...And so much more!\n\n## Pauline, Ex-Gitpod\n\nThree years ago, Gitpod gave me a shot.\n\nLast year, I shipped some of my best work to date.\n\nToday, I join the group of ex-Gitpodders out there in the world bringing a\npiece of the Gitpod culture to our next adventures.\n\nMy friends Laurie and Arthur jumped on a call with me shortly after the\nannouncement, and saw me on the other side of my screen wrapped up in a\nblanket with comfort ice cream and cake and swollen eyes. I guarantee I looked\nridiculous, but found so much comfort in my friends, both ex-Gitpodders now,\nwho were there for me.\n\nSpeaking at the first Gitpod offsite in Portugal (2022)\n\nSince our departure, a community group for Gitpod alumni was started and I was\noverwhelmed (somewhat tearful writing this) by the support ex-Gitpodders have\nshown for each other.\n\n37 43 ex-Gitpodders joined us in 48~ hours.\n\nWe\u2019ve had those affected by earlier layoffs share their thoughts over a year\nlater, some offering exciting roles and connections for our next steps and\nsome literally just there to show solidarity for the situation. Kudos to\nGeorge, our resident culture carrier, for getting the ball rolling with this!\n\n> \ud83d\udce3 I\u2019d love to introduce you to an exceptional group of ex-Gitpodders\n> spanning customer experience/support, engineering management, technical\n> marketing, product design, and brand design.\n>\n> If you have any open roles, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn,\n> Twitter or send me an email.\n\nTo conclude this chapter of my career, I\u2019d like to end with some words shared\nrecently by an ex-Gitpodder:\n\n> What made Gitpod special wasn\u2019t the product, or the management, or the\n> investors. But the people.\n>\n> We all gave a shit and tried our best. And we were flawed, but forgiving of\n> each other. Having been out for ~15 months it makes me realize how special\n> it was.\n>\n> But we still own that attitude because it was us.\n\nThanks to Gitpod, my colleagues and the wider community for the unforgettable\nride.

You are a very\ntalented and passionate individual and dont let that shine dull in these\nharder times. Business is business it is true, but you will always take away\nlearnings for your next step. It will always be a progression into something\nthat is made for you to be available for.
