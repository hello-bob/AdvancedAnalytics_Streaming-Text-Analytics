It\u2019s all legal in certain states, as\nlong as they\u2019re in a new Mercedes with autonomous driving technology.\n\nThe luxury automaker has become the first in the nation to start selling self-\ndriving cars\u2014at least those that afford riders a hands-free experience\u2014to\nregular consumers. As of April 11, there were 65 Mercedes autonomous vehicles\navailable for sale in California, Fortune has learned through an open records\nrequest submitted to the state\u2019s DMV. One of those has since been sold, which\nmarks the first sale of an autonomous Mercedes in California, according to the\nDMV. Mercedes would not confirm sales numbers. Select Mercedes dealerships in\nNevada are also offering the cars with the new technology, known as \u201clevel 3\u201d\nautonomous driving.\n\nLevel 3-enabled cars went on sale in December, Mercedes told Fortune.\nCalifornia and Nevada are the only two states where the company can legally\nsell the technology to consumers. The two state DMVs gave Mercedes approval to\nbegin selling the cars last year\u2014Nevada in January, and California in June.\nMercedes announced in September its plans to begin sales, but this is the\nfirst news of the cars actually reaching consumers.\n\nDrivers can activate Mercedes\u2019s technology, called Drive Pilot, when certain\nconditions are met, including in heavy traffic jams, during the daytime, on\nspecific California and Nevada freeways, and when the car is traveling less\nthan 40 mph. Drivers can focus on other activities until the vehicle alerts\nthem to resume control. The technology does not work on roads that haven\u2019t\nbeen pre-approved by Mercedes, including on freeways in other states.\n\nThe sales mark a new echelon of autonomous driving available to the average\nAmerican. Mercedes is the first automaker selling to customers to achieve\nlevel 3 capabilities in the U.S., with Tesla and others still offering\ntechnology at level 2\u2014in which cars can perform specific tasks but require\nconstant supervision from a driver. Some drivers, however, ignore those rules\nand operate the cars as if they are more capable than they are. One family of\na deceased driver has accused Tesla of hyping its assisted driving technology\nas fully autonomous, allegedly leading to tragic results, while California\u2019s\nDMV last year accused the company of false advertising over the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, robotaxis from Alphabet\u2019s Waymo and GM\u2019s Cruise operate at level 4,\nmeaning cars drive autonomously in most conditions without human interference.\nBut these companies currently don\u2019t sell vehicles to consumers, and Cruise\nrecently halted its service after California\u2019s DMV suspended its license due\nto an incident in which a car dragged a pedestrian under its carriage for 20\nfeet.\n\nU.S. customers can buy a yearly subscription of Drive Pilot in 2024 EQS sedans\nand S-Class car models for $2,500. Mercedes began selling level 3-enabled cars\nin its home country of Germany in May 2022. The European packages cost 5,000\nto 7,000 euros ($5,300 and $7,500) for a three-year membership.\n\nThe cars sport turquoise lights on its rear-view mirrors, headlights, and\ntaillights to let law enforcement and other drivers know when the car is\noperating autonomously. Drive Pilot is only available on select models that\nhave the built-in hardware, including a sensor at the front of the car and a\ncamera in the rear windshield.\n\nMercedes is also working on developing level 4 capabilities. The automaker\u2019s\nchief technology officer Markus Sch\u00e4fer expects that level 4 autonomous\ntechnology will be available to consumers by 2030, Automotive News reported.\nBut the jump to level 4 is considerably more difficult than achieving level 3.\nWhile humans are still expected to take control of the car based on the\ncircumstances in level 3, level 4 technology is supposed to offer near-total\nautonomy. At this level, a driver only needs to take over if the system fails.\nThat means the technology must be able to safely respond to nearly all\nunexpected situations on the road.\n\nCorrection, April 19, 2024: A previous version of this article misstated the\nnumber of autonomous Mercedes cars sold in California. There were 65 cars\navailable for sale at the time of the records request.\n\nUpdate, April 19, 2024: This article has been updated with the information\nthat one autonomous car has been sold in California.\n\nSubscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the\nfuture of business.
