The advent of the modern smartphone changed economies,\nindustries, even the way we connect with others and live our lives.\n\nTo honor their immeasurable impact, we're today unveiling our first\ncollector's book dedicated to some of the icons of cell phone history \u2013 Iconic\nPhones: Revolution at Your Fingertips. A must-have item in the collection of\nevery phone enthusiast!\n\nFind out more and sign up to receive updates on the book's release here!\n\nAt PhoneArena, we've been documenting mobile tech history every step of the\nway, and we can discern that we're now at a phase unlike any other. The phone\nindustry of today is a very different beast compared to what it was a decade\nor two ago. While the marvelous products of today excel in terms of polish,\nperformance and capabilities, the current market simply cannot offer the\nintense excitement, diversity and dynamic creative spirit that characterize a\nrapidly evolving industry. It is that creative spirit which gave birth to some\nof the most recognizable, impactful, and yes, iconic, phones of our time.\n\nEver noticed how one of the most entertaining topics of conversation when we\nsit down with our fellow tech enthusiasts is when we go back in time and\nreminisce about the technology of old? The slow dial-up internet days, the age\nof the CDs, and yes, those remarkable handsets from the phone industry's\nyounger years. Many of those handsets seemed so far ahead of their time just\n15 years ago, while today they look like they belong in a museum.\n\nNevertheless, these icons of the young and booming phone market will always be\nremembered for the radical innovation and bold thinking of their makers.\n\nOne cannot even start such a conversation without mentioning the legendary\norigin story of the first iPhone. A mythical device by today's standards, and\none whose rough development cycle must have ended more than a few marriages.\n\nOr, what about Motorola's Project Siliqua? Also known as the mighty RAZR V3\n(yes, that's the original) \u2013 a phone that managed to redefine our expectations\nof style with its never-before-seen, razor-sharp profile and exciting\ncolorway. Who said form should always follow function? Definitely not the Moto\nexecutives from the 2004-2007 era, who witnessed how the fashionable RAZR\nsingle-handedly turned the company around!\n\nBut looks have never been the only way to success in the mobile industry, as\none much younger company would attest. Many years later (centuries in\ntechnology terms), a couple of witty Chinese entrepreneurs, Carl Pei and Pete\nLau, would shake our very perceptions of what a phone company is. Their first\nbrain-child, the 2014 OnePlus One, capitalized on the growing need of Android\nusers for an extremely powerful, yet simple and elegant phone that didn't\nbreak the bank. You can only imagine that engineering such a product required\na whole new type of company \u2013 one that wouldn't play by the old rule-book, but\nwould instead be willing to break the rules.\n\nThese are just some of the most iconic phones of the last two decades, but\nthere are many more. And while they are all strikingly different, they do have\none important thing in common: their unlikely stories are, beyond any doubt,\nworth telling.\n\nFind out more and sign up to receive updates on the book's release here!\n\nAnd we're here to tell their stories in a whole new way with our upcoming\nbook, Iconic Phones: Revolution at Your Fingertips. Designed to make a perfect\naddition to every tech enthusiast's collection, Iconic Phones: Revolution at\nYour Fingertips features fascinating stories, facts and trivia about 6 of the\nmost remarkable handsets ever created, paired with stunning, high-resolution\nphotography that eternalizes their unique designs in a way you've never seen\nbefore.\n\nRad Slavov Editor-in-chief, Reviewer and Author\n\nRad Slavov is the Editor-in-Chief at PhoneArena.
