Today, we are pleased to announce that we have\nfinished development of our three-nanometer (nm) bitcoin mining chip and are\nin the process of completing a full tapeout of the design with a leading\nglobal semiconductor foundry. This marks an important milestone in our bitcoin\nmining project. Additionally, with our chip design complete, we are excited to\nshare that we are developing a full bitcoin mining system. As we pursue our\nsystem design, we strongly welcome input from the mining community on the\nproblems faced with existing solutions.\n\nIn a prior update, we disclosed that we had moved forward with manufacturing a\nfive-nanometer mining chip prototype. Last fall, we received silicon samples\nback from our foundry partner. These samples met our design targets and gave\nus valuable learnings, validating our architecture and design approach. Since\nthen, we have been working heads down on our 3nm design. With our design\nshowing competitive performance, we are proceeding with the full tapeout. Our\nmining chip will utilize the most advanced semiconductor process currently\navailable and will deliver the performance required for mining operators of\nall types to survive and thrive in the fifth mining epoch (the period\nfollowing the recent 4th halving of the block subsidy) and beyond.\n\nAs our mining program has progressed, we\u2019ve listened closely to the feedback\nwe\u2019ve received from the mining community. We\u2019ve spent a significant amount of\ntime talking to a wide variety of bitcoin miners to identify the challenges\nfaced by mining operators. Building on these insights and pursuant to our goal\nof supporting mining decentralization, we plan to offer both a standalone\nmining chip as well as a full mining system of our own design.\n\nWith a standalone mining chip, we will represent the only large, well-\ncapitalized mining hardware vendor with such a solution. We hope this will\nhelp unlock mining system innovation and support the much-needed development\nof new mining system form factors and use cases.\n\nWith our bitcoin mining system, we will build on our product and software\ndevelopment expertise, system engineering competency, supply chain experience,\nand aftermarket support capability, with tens of millions of devices shipped.\nWe intend to use this experience to bring a compelling, differentiated mining\nsolution to market. For context, you can see the initial directions we shared\non the mining software front.\n\nWhile the learnings we\u2019ve gained so far have given us some initial ideas for\nwhat our system should look like, we\u2019d love more input from the mining\ncommunity. Specifically, we\u2019d love to hear about the pain points or issues you\nare experiencing in the following areas:\n\n  * Pre-sales discovery. What challenges do you face when evaluating potential miner purchases? Are there sufficient data and resources available? What might help improve the process?\n  * Purchasing. What problems does the current purchasing process present? How might it be improved?\n  * Reliability. What are the most common reliability problems you face with your mining hardware? What are the biggest challenges you face with maintaining miner uptime? What failure modes are most costly in terms of lost uptime or repair cost?\n  * Maintenance. What are the biggest challenges you face in maintaining your miners?\n  * Software features. What are the biggest problems you face with existing mining software? What features do you think are most lacking with current mining software? What features would you most like to see?\n  * Transparency. Where is lack of transparency or clarity most problematic with mining hardware and software? Where would you most like more transparency and why?\n  * Post-sale support. What are the biggest problems you\u2019ve faced with your mining hardware after purchasing? What kind of post-sales support would you like to see?\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear your input. Please feel free to reach out to us at\nmining@block.xyz to share your thoughts. Stay tuned for more updates on our\nmining hardware program in the coming weeks and months!\n\n### Stay in the loop\n\nSubscribe to receive new post alerts and provide direct feedback to our team.\n\n### Published by:\n\nmining.build \u00a9 2024\n\nPowered by Ghost\n\n", "frontpage": false}
