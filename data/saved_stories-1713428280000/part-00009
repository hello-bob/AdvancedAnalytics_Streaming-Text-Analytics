Last\nyear's tally was 24.\n\nBeth Mole - 4/17/2024, 10:26 PM\n\nEnlarge / A rat looks for food while on a subway platform at the Columbus\nCircle - 59th Street station on May 8, 2023, in New York City.\n\nGetty | Gary Hershorn\n\n#### reader comments\n\n25\n\nA life-threatening bacterial infection typically spread through rat urine\nsickened a record number of people in New York City last year\u2014and this year\nlooks on track for another all-time high, the NYC Department of Health and\nMental Hygiene reports.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nMan\u2019s eyes turn bloody, yellow after plunge into pee-filled canal\n\nThe infection is leptospirosis, which can cause a range of symptoms, including\nnon-specific ones like fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting,\ndiarrhea, and cough. But, if left untreated, can become severe, causing kidney\nfailure, liver damage, jaundice, hemorrhage, bloody eyes (conjunctival\nsuffusion), respiratory distress, and potentially death.\n\nThe bacteria that causes it\u2014spirochete bacteria of the genus Leptospira\u2014infect\nrats, which shed the bacteria in their urine. The germs jump to people through\ndirect contact with open wounds or mucous membranes.\n\nNew York City has long been in a (mostly losing) war with its rat population,\nwhich last year was estimated to be as many as 3 million. Mayor Eric Adams has\nmade fighting the rat population a key initiative, and just last week, the\ncity council proposed the latest strategy to curtail the furry brown rodent's\ncolony: birth control in the form of salty pellets.\n\nStill, leptospirosis has not been a prime concern from the rats' mischief\nuntil recently. Between 2001 and 2020, the city logged an average of just\nthree leptospirosis cases a year\u2014and some of those were travel related. But,\nthings took a turn during the pandemic when the rat population seemed to boom.\nFrom 2021 and 2022, the average shot up to 15. In 2023, there were 24 cases,\nthe highest number of cases ever recorded for a single year. And as of April\n10, there have been six cases so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat number of cases so far this year is concerning given that Leptospira\nbacteria are \"fragile,\" as the NYC health department puts it. They die quickly\nin the freezing temperatures of winte and the dry heat of summer. Their main\ntime to thrive is in warm, moist conditions. Last year, the months with the\nmost cases were June and October. The health department noted that climate\nchange, which is causing excessive rain and unseasonably warm temperatures,\nmay be partly driving the uptick in cases.\n\nIn a health advisory released last week, the city's health department advised\nclinicians to be on the lookout for cases, which are treated with common oral\nantibiotics when mild or intravenous doses when severe. Symptoms typically\ndevelop in 5 to 14 days after an exposure, but can show up anywhere from 2 to\n30 days.\n\nOf the 98 locally acquired cases that the city has recorded between 2001 and\n2023, nearly all were in men (94 percent) and the median age was 50, with a\nrange of 20 to 80 years. Most often, the cases occurred in the Bronx (37),\nfollowed by Manhattan (28), Brooklyn (19), Queens (10), and Staten Island (4).\nCases presented to clinicians with acute kidney and liver failure and\noccasionally severe respiratory involvement. Of the 98 cases, six died.\n\nThe cases are typically related to living or working environments with rat\nurine, contaminated soil and water, or materials frequently contaminated with\nrat urine, such as trash bags or food waste bins. The health department noted\nthat human-to-human transmission is rare.\n\nNew York isn't the only city plagued by leptospirosis cases. Last year,\ndoctors in the Netherlands reported the case of an 18-year-old with jaundiced,\nbloody eyes, who had developed leptospirosis after falling into a canal that\nwas likely contaminated with rodent urine.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n25\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
