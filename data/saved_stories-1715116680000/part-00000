The Free plan\nallows 50 points per day for generating 10 songs, which cannot be used for\ncommercial purposes; while the Professional and Premium plans provide more\npoints and commercial rights.\n\nGlobal Support\n\nSuno supports input and output of songs in over 50 languages including\nEnglish, Chinese, French, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, etc. This makes Suno\nwidely applicable.\n\nUse Suno AI\n\nFAQ\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n  * Suno AI is a web-based text-to-music generator capable of crafting complete songs in seconds based on simple text prompts. For instance, requesting a 'psychedelic UK garage song about a friend with a Nokia obsession' results in a couple of two-minute songs with vocals, instrumentation, lyrics, song titles, and even artwork.\n\n  * Suno ai operates similarly to large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, utilizing extensive training data, including speech recordings, to generate original songs and lyrics based on user prompts. While LLMs predict text sequences, Suno faces a greater challenge in generating music. However, specifics about Suno's training data remain unclear.\n\n  * Suno ai is incredibly user-friendly, which may be concerning for those in the music industry reliant on traditional methods. Simply visit the Suno website, create a free account, and navigate to the 'Create' section. In this section, you'll find a concise box where you can describe your desired song. It's essential to specify the music style (genre) and the song's topic. While you can't request a specific artist's style due to Suno's lack of label licenses, you can still craft unique compositions tailored to your preferences.\n\n  * With Suno ai, ownership of the songs created depends on the plan you're subscribed to. If you're on the Pro or Premier plans, you retain ownership of the songs. However, as a free user, Suno maintains ownership of the generated songs. It's important to note that this ownership distinction differs from copyright ownership. Suno's FAQ section highlights that the extent and availability of copyright protection for content generated using artificial intelligence are subject to complex and evolving legal considerations, which can vary across countries.\n\n  * A potential direction for Suno is illustrated by Google's Dream Track, which has partnered with artists to enable early users to generate AI soundtracks for their YouTube Shorts. Should Suno secure collaborations with music labels, it could leverage your favorite artists as inspiration to generate AI-generated tracks in their signature styles. Suno's CEO Mikey Shulman expressed this vision in an interview with Lightspeed Venture Partners, suggesting a future where users could prompt the model with a specific Taylor Swift song, once licensing uncertainties are resolved.\n\nSuno AI Lyrics Generator\n\nCopyright sunoaimusic.org\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 - All rights reserved\n\nLINKS\n\nSupport\n\nLEGAL\n\nTerms of servicesPrivacy policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
