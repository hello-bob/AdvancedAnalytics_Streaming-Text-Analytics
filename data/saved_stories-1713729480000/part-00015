The study shows that Cnicin can\naccelerate the growth of axons, the long fibers of nerve cells, which is\ncrucial for the recovery of nerve function after injury.\n\nThis new finding was demonstrated in animal models and human cell cultures,\nwhere Cnicin treatment led to rapid improvements in paralysis and neuropathy\nsymptoms. Remarkably, Cnicin can be administered orally, offering a practical\nadvantage over injectable treatments and highlighting its potential for\nbroader clinical application.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. Cnicin, extracted from Blessed Thistle, has been shown to speed up axon growth, essential for nerve repair.\n  2. The compound\u2019s effectiveness was observed in both animal models and human cells, with treated subjects showing quicker recovery from nerve damage.\n  3. The study emphasizes the need for further clinical trials to determine the optimal dosage, as Cnicin operates within a narrow therapeutic window.\n\nSource: University of Cologne\n\nBlessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus) is a plant in the family Asteraceae and\nalso grows in our climate. For centuries, it has been used as a medicinal herb\nas an extract or tea, e.g. to aid the digestive system.\n\nResearchers at the Center for Pharmacology of University Hospital Cologne and\nat the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Cologne have now found a\ncompletely novel use for Cnicin under the direction of Dr Philipp Gobrecht and\nProfessor Dr Dietmar Fischer.\n\nAdministering a daily dose of Cnicin to mice or rats helped improve paralysis\nand neuropathy much more quickly. Credit: Neuroscience News\n\nAnimal models as well as human cells have shown that Cnicin significantly\naccelerates axon (nerve fibres) growth. The study \u2018Cnicin promotes functional\nnerve regeneration\u2019 was published in Phytomedicine.\n\nRapid help for nerves\n\nRegeneration pathways of injured nerves in humans and animals with long axons\nare accordingly long. This often makes the healing process lengthy and even\nfrequently irreversible because the axons cannot reach their destination on\ntime.\n\nAn accelerated regeneration growth rate can, therefore, make a big difference\nhere, ensuring that the fibres reach their original destination on time before\nirreparable functional deficits can occur.\n\nThe researchers demonstrated axon regeneration in animal models and human\ncells taken from retinae donated by patients. Administering a daily dose of\nCnicin to mice or rats helped improve paralysis and neuropathy much more\nquickly.\n\nCompared to other compounds, Cnicin has one crucial advantage: it can be\nintroduced into the bloodstream orally (by mouth). It does not have to be\ngiven by injection.\n\n\u201cThe correct dose is very important here, as Cnicin only works within a\nspecific therapeutic window. Doses that are too low or too high are\nineffective. This is why further clinical studies on humans are crucial,\u201d said\nFischer.\n\nThe University of Cologne researchers are currently planning relevant studies.\nThe Center for Pharmacology is researching and developing drugs to repair the\ndamaged nervous system.\n\nFunding: The current study received funding of around 1,200,000 euros from the\nFederal Ministry of Education and Research within the framework of the project\nPARREGERON.\n\n## About this nerve regeneration and supplements research news\n\nAuthor: Anna Euteneuer Source: University of Cologne Contact: Anna Euteneuer \u2013\nUniversity of Cologne Image: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Open access. \u201cCnicin promotes functional nerve\nregeneration\u201d by Dietmar Fischer et al. Phytomedicine\n\nAbstract\n\nCnicin promotes functional nerve regeneration\n\n### Backround\n\nThe limited regenerative capacity of injured axons hinders functional recovery\nafter nerve injury. Although no drugs are currently available in the clinic to\naccelerate axon regeneration, recent studies show the potential of vasohibin\ninhibition by parthenolide, produced in Tanacetum parthenium, to accelerate\naxon regeneration. However, due to its poor oral bioavailability, parthenolide\nis limited to parenteral administration.\n\n### Purpose\n\nThis study investigates another sesquiterpene lactone, cnicin, produced in\nCnicus benedictus for promoting axon regeneration.\n\n### Results\n\nCnicin is equally potent and effective in facilitating nerve regeneration. In\nculture, cnicin promotes axon growth of sensory and CNS neurons from various\nspecies, including humans. Neuronal overexpression of vasohibin increases the\neffective concentrations comparable to parthenolide, suggesting an interaction\nbetween cnicin and vasohibin. Remarkably, intravenous administration of cnicin\nsignificantly accelerates functional recovery after severe nerve injury in\nvarious species, including the anastomosis of severed nerves. Pharmacokinetic\nanalysis of intravenously applied cnicin shows a blood half-life of 12.7\nminutes and an oral bioavailability of 84.7% in rats. Oral drug administration\npromotes axon regeneration and recovery after nerve injury in mice.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese results highlight the potential of cnicin as a promising drug to treat\naxonal insults and improve recovery.\n\nTags\n\nBlessed Thistlebrain researchCnicus benedictusnerve\nregenerationneurobiologyneurogenesisNeurologyneuropathyNeuroscienceparalysissupplementsUniversity\nof Cologne\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
