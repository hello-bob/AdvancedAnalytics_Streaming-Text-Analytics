When my grandfather died in 1999 I was just 12 years old and it was\nthe first time I lost someone from my closer family.\n\nHe lived an interesting life, when he was 19 he was drafted by the Nazis and\nbecame a mechanic for the Luftwaffe. After the war when he came back from a\nPoW camp in Siberia he was a bus driver, mechanic, father and later\ngrandfather. He never talked about anything he experienced in the war and\naccording to my family he came back deeply traumatized. Many parts of his life\nwere only reveiled to me after his death - not because of a particular reason\njust because I was too young to ask any interesting questions at the time.\n\nMy grandfather \"Josef Brankl\" 1940-1945\n\n### What does this have to do with email?\n\nWhen I realized that I have a son now and that these years will be his vague\nmemories in the future I thought I'd start emailing him things from our daily\nlives and I encourage all of his family members to do the same to tell him\nabout themselves and write about memories they share.\n\nI usually send him two to three emails per year with photos of our family and\nfriends and his sourroundings like what car we drive, what our house and our\ngarden looks like.\n\nEmails to Linus\n\n### The grandparent equasion\n\nEven though I plan to be by his side for the next 50 years or so, you never\nknow when he's going to lose a loved one in his future and I want him to have\nfirst-hand messages from everyone in our family right there in his inbox.\n\nOnce every year I remind his grandparents, aunts and uncles to send him an\nemail and just tell them what they are up to these days, where they live and\nwho they met. I encurage them to include photos of them and their\nsourroundings so he can watch them age over the years and emails.\n\nLinus with his grandparents\n\nI imagine him in his teen years scrolling through and reading messages from\nloved ones who might no longer be with us and read about their lives and their\nown history.\n\nLinus will be 4 years old in a few months and I have sent him 10 emails so\nfar. I write him on his birthdays and after events like first vacation, first\nChristmas or first day in Kindergarten.\n\nBut apart from the emails I have another plan.\n\n# Leaving time capsules\n\nWhen I met my wife she showed me the concept of Geocaches. Geocaching.com\ndescribes it as follows:\n\n> Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor adventure that is happening all the\n> time, all around the world. To play, participants use the Geocaching app\n> and/or a GPS device to navigate to cleverly hidden containers called\n> geocaches.\n>\n> https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2018/03/what-is-geocaching/\n\nThis concept was very interesting to me and one day I connected the idea of\ngeocaching with the virtual legacy I'm planning for him.\n\n### Geocaching but 10+ years apart\n\nI have prepared a few capsules with random items from our lives or toys he\ndoesn't play with anymore. My plan is to bury them in random places, make\nphotos and note the GPS coordinates of the locations to send it to him. Some\nof them however I will not tell him about but save in my personal documents\nfor him to possibly find many years down the line.\n\nExample of a time capsule. This one is from the UK (c) UK Parliament Jessica\nTaylor\n\nThe hard part here is finding spots that are easily accessible now and will be\nin many years too. But I already have a few ideas.\n\nMaybe even an ETH paper wallet with 50\u20ac on it? Who knows\n\nTags: parenting son legacy\n\nComment using SSH!
