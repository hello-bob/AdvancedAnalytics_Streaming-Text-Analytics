My\nintentions were good, but I alienated my management chain without\naccomplishing much. I also shared my concerns with my team, which I thought\nwould help them understand the organization, but mostly isolated them in a\nValues Oasis or demoralized them instead.\n\nThose experiences taught me that pushing your organization to improve is\nessential leadership work, but organizations can only absorb so much\nimprovement at a given time before they reject the person providing the\nfeedback. Being rejected while trying so hard to help is painful, and it\u2019s\nalso a predictable outcome.\n\nIt\u2019s also a bad outcome for your team. When I focused on how the environment\ncould change to make my team more successful, I was usually technically\ncorrect, but usually didn\u2019t help my team very much. Because work environments\nchange slowly, it benefits your team more to give them feedback about how they\ncan succeed in their current environment than to agree with them about how the\ncurrent environment does a poor job of supporting them. Agreeing feels\nempathetic, but frames them as a bystander rather than active participant in\ntheir work.\n\nI\u2019ve pulled together a few related thoughts on this topic:\n\n  * my framework for delivering cross-functional feedback,\n  * modifying that framework for communicating within your team,\n  * how I see many folks get caught up on \u201cfeedback legalism\u201d, e.g. fighting the format of feedback, as a way to avoid hearing feedback\n  * why it\u2019s still worthwhile to improve how you deliver feedback, even if you believe that the focus on format of received feedback is unconstructive\n\nThis is more a collection of notes than a grand theory, but hopefully the\nnotes are useful.\n\n## Feedback framework\n\nAs mentioned above, I used to give a lot of feedback, and found I tended to\ndamage the relationship rather than improve outcomes, so I recalibrated. My\nframework these days is:\n\n  1. Determine why I am confident in my perspective. Is it because I worked on a similar problem previously? Is it because of research I\u2019ve specific done on the topic? Have I modeled the problem out?\n\nIf you can\u2019t explain why you\u2019re confident, then it\u2019s extremely unlikely you\u2019ll\nconvince others. Similarly, there\u2019s a power dynamic where depending on your\nperceived positions in hierarchy, the less senior you are, the more you\u2019re\nexpected to have strong rationale. (I\u2019m not saying this is good, as this\ndynamic often prevents good feedback. Conversely, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad, as\nit avoids senior leaders wading through a deluge of feedback. I\u2019m just saying\nthis is real.)\n\n  2. Once I\u2019ve been able to determine where my confidence comes from, I\u2019m able to articulate the strength of the feedback. For example, much of the feedback I give these days is formatted as, \u201cI\u2019m not positive, but I think it\u2019s worth quickly checking if the number of upsells is actually low, or if we have a significant dropoff right before the last stage of the conversion funnel.\u201d\n\nYou can deliver a much higher volume of lightweight feedback than heavy\nfeedback.\n\n  3. Determine the size of the \u201cfeedback pipe\u201d between you and the other party. If it\u2019s someone who you or your team is in active conflict with, the size of the feedback pipe might be \u201cabsolutely no feedback can successfully be transmitted,\u201d In that case, you have to start by trying to invest into the relationship before delivering feedback (try getting dinner with them, or a joint project, or figuring out a joint interest \u2013 yes, it can seem silly, but yes this is how humans work).\n\nIt\u2019s so tempting to skip this step, but it basically doesn\u2019t work. Even folks\nwho are good at receiving feedback will focus on merely understanding your\nfeedback rather than valuing your feedback. They will poke at it a bit, and\nmaybe try it on for size, but you\u2019ll be starting from a difficult place.\n\n  4. Prioritize the feedback that you want to give. Particularly in cases where you\u2019re having a lot of trouble working with a set of stakeholders, you might have built up a backlog of dozens of pieces of valuable feedback. You have to figure out the order you want to work through those pieces, recognizing that each piece might take months to work through.\n  5. Based on the size of your pipeline and priorities, deliver as much feedback as you can, but no more. The two rules here are. One, delivering too much slows down improvement and harms the relationship. Two, delivering too little slows down improvement and harms the relationship.\n\nIf your relationship is quite good, I find that sometimes folks don\u2019t deliver\nvaluable feedback because they don\u2019t have time to format it well. I recommend\nusing the full feedback pipe, and sometimes that means delivering imperfect\nfeedback to people you have a strong relationship with; this is the executive-\nperspective of Extracting the kernel.\n\nAll-in, I think it would be fair to call this \u201cvery obvious,\u201d but it was also\nsomething that I messed up for a long time until I figured it out, so I think\nit\u2019s more the category of \u201cobvious once you\u2019ve seen it, but hard to perceive\nbefore then.\u201d\n\n## Commentary isn\u2019t feedback\n\nFeedback is conveying information to someone about how they are impacting\nsomething. For example, \u201cHey Will, it felt like you focused on convincing the\nCFO about the cost impact of your hiring plan, but didn\u2019t spend time\nconvincing anyone else that the plan was worthwhile, even if the cost was low.\nIt would have worked better if you\u2019d started on why it\u2019s useful before getting\ncaught up on how to minimize the expense.\u201d People also talk a lot about their\nviews on the behavior of a third party. Going back to my last example, if the\nhead of product complained to the CFO that Will (the head of engineering)\ndidn\u2019t even explain their proposal, that\u2019s not feedback (it\u2019s being delivered\nto an uninvolved party), that\u2019s just commentary about the head of\nengineering\u2019s behavior.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to distinguish between these two behaviors, and I\u2019d\nargue that commentary generally has few positive impacts. It polarizes the\nteam. It harms your relationships, reducing the bandwidth for feedback. It\nmakes you harder to work with, even when the commentary is accurate.\n\nThis is particularly true when you share your concerns with your team. You may\nhave to acknowledge the problems around you to maintain credibility, but done\nfrequently that creates a values oasis. It also frames you as an observer of\nthe problem rather than part of the solution, which diminishes you in the eyes\nof whoever you\u2019re talking with.\n\nUltimately, I believe that people want to work with an inspiring leader who\nbelieves they can overcome even messy internal problems. Commentary generally\nreduces your ability to solve internal problems, reduces your visibility as an\ninspiring leader, and anchors your own attention on problems rather than\nopportunity.\n\nIf you do want to complain, ah, I mean provide commentary, external friends\nand colleagues are the best recipients.\n\n## \u201cSituation Behavior Impact\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an industry around delivering good feedback, such as the Situation-\nBehavior-Impact (SBI) framework, and these things are useful guide rails for\ngiving feedback. In particular, I think they\u2019re the sort of thing you can\nactively practice for three months (e.g. spend time proactively framing every\npiece of your feedback this way) and reflexively deploy without much effort\nfrom that point onward. However, I see them get misused in two different ways.\n\nFirst, often folks never really get comfortable with them and end up viewing\nthem as \u201ctoo heavy to apply quickly\u201d so they start pocketing more and more\nfeedback rather than delivering it. This is often net-negative because these\ntrainings trying to help deliver better feedback result in folks getting\nsignificantly less feedback. If this seems surprising, then draw the Econ 101\nsupply/demand chart, and model the impact of the price of delivering feedback\ngoing up: the supply will naturally go down at any given point on the line.\n\nSecond, I see folks reject feedback because they don\u2019t like how it was\ndelivered. Essentially, they become feedback lawyers who fixate on the\nweakness in how feedback was delivered rather than trying to understand the\ncontent within the feedback itself. This lets someone feel justified in\nignoring feedback because it wasn\u2019t properly formatted, but doesn\u2019t accomplish\nanything other than discouraging future feedback. Again, if we look at the\nimpact of this behavior, it\u2019s just shifting the demand curve on the Econ 101\nchart down, once again resulting in less feedback.\n\nThe advice I give to people is that feedback recipients are obligated to\nextract the kernel of insight from feedback, even if it isn\u2019t well delivered.\nOther approaches might feel better short term, but they don\u2019t work.\n\n## \u201cRadical Candor\u201d\n\nWhile I\u2019d caution you to avoid getting too caught up in formatting feedback,\nI\u2019d similarly avoid the overly simplistic message that many folks take from\nthe \u201cRadical Candor\u201d school of thought. Delivering feedback abruptly is better\nthan delivering no feedback, but it\u2019s still less effective than taking a bit\nof time to get better at this. Again, I\u2019d push you to spend a few months\nactively practicing how to structure feedback, after which I think you\u2019ll be\nbetter able to quickly deliver feedback as long as you put ongoing effort into\nmaintaining those relationships.\n\nHi folks.
