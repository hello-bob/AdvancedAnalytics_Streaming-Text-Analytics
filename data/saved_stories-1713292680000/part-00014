These are not just graphs; they\nare polished masterpieces, ready for publication.\n\nWhile I'm deeply indebted to the original authors for their stellar work, it's\nworth noting that many of these visualizations were first conceived in R, a\ntestament to its rich visualization ecosystem. In an endeavor to bring the\nbest to our Python community, I've translated these gems to further showcase\nthe versatility and power of matplotlib.\n\nDive in and get inspired! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n## Map with scatter plot on top\n\nPath and duration of solar eclipses in the USA, in 2023 and 2024.\n\nby Joseph Barbier\n\n## Dumbell chart\n\nAdvanced dumbell chart about wins and losses in the Bundesliga.\n\nby C\u00e9dric Scherer\n\n## Double heatmap for comparison\n\nA double heatmap to compare normalized and non-normalized data about energy\nconsumption in France\n\nby Joseph Barbier\n\n## Ridgeline with quantiles display\n\nA ridgeline plot with quantiles and annotations to visualize the price\ndistribution of rents in San Francisco.\n\nby Ansgar Wolsing\n\n## Polished table with bubbles\n\nInvestigating the 10 best and worst countries to live in, with bubble in cells\nto represent the data.
