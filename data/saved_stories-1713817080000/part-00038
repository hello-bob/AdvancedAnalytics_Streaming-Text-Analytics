Or a modest three-\nbedroom house going for $1.1 million in a town of 9,000? Or a small city where\nthe average home price is nearly one million dollars? And that\u2019s not just for\nthe big houses, the fancy ones, that\u2019s the average house for sale \u2014 that\u2019s how\ninaccessible it is to buy a house in Bozeman, Montana. And the phenomenon of\nrural gentrification, as we call it, isn\u2019t limited to one state; it\u2019s no\nlonger even limited to a handful of towns frequented by the rich and famous.\nIt\u2019s spreading across the West, across rural America. That is, in places that\nhaven\u2019t been left to rot.\n\nHome for sale in Whitefish, Montana for $1.4 million. Image by Heather\nRedding.\n\nNot too long ago we (using we for simplicity with two authors) were in Denver.\nWe had started the day in Junction City, Kansas, and as we sat down to eat\nafter a long day of driving our server came over. Their name was Dallas. We\ngot to chatting, and when we mentioned Junction City, Dallas immediately\nreplied, \u201cI hate that place. My Mom lives there, so I can say that.\u201d And safe\nto say we didn\u2019t expect our server at a Denver vegetarian restaurant to know a\nsmall Kansas city eight hours away. We also didn\u2019t expect our server to be\nnamed Dallas, to be fair.\n\nThe interstate between Junction City and Denver was the least interesting part\nof a recent cross-country road trip, by a long shot. We saw fields, mostly.\nTowns seemed to be hundreds of miles apart, and the few we did see were so\nsmall that there wasn\u2019t much to be seen. We did stop in one, for lunch, and it\nwas called Quinter. It had once been called Familton, but apparently the\npostal service kept confusing it with Hamilton, so that had to change.\n\nAs we arrived in Quinter we pulled up to a drug store. It had an old-school\nlunch counter, and we hopped out of the car, thrilled to not be driving for a\nbit, and to grab some food. But there was none to be had. They had soda, and\nnot much else. Thankfully a worker was more than happy to tell us what food\nthey had in town. She said, \u201cOur Dairy Queen has food, aaand oh there\u2019s the\nbrewery down the street. They have sandwiches.\u201d That was that. We went over to\nthe brewery and got some of the most unequivocally mediocre sandwiches of our\nlives.\n\nThe next four hours to Denver we talked a lot about small towns, rural decay,\nand rural gentrification. One of us grew up in Montana, and the other grew up\nin the Midwest and on the East Coast, and we\u2019ve both spent time in a few\ndifferent places. It\u2019s easy to think of rural America as the land that\u2019s been\npassed over, the land that time (and capitalism) have forgotten where there\naren\u2019t many good solutions to folks\u2019 economic problems, and they instead turn\nto MAGA and old prejudices and just dig the hole deeper. And in some places\nthe tide of decay has swept through, devastating communities. Driving through\nIowa and Missouri you see town after town where the awnings of the handful of\nstores open on Main Street are so weather worn that the letters have faded\nalmost to illegibility, because nothing has been updated since 1977.\n\nPhoto by Josh Berendes on Unsplash\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of small towns and rural areas that look like this. And a\nlot of people have written off giant swathes of the country, not spending much\ntime thinking about the gerrymandering or corporate malpractice or extractive\neconomies that got us here. Neither party really wants to get into the way our\neconomic system sees people and land as disposable, resources to be chewed up\nand pumped out and forgotten about. But as you drive across the country you\u2019ll\nsee it. You\u2019ll get out West and see ghost towns, old mining towns abandoned by\ncorporations whose people were then forced to leave, in a rush or in a\ntrickle. And yet in other places you\u2019ll see something totally different.\nYou\u2019ll see medium sized three-bedroom houses going for a million dollars.\nYou\u2019ll see expensive cars and celebrity gated communities and fancy ski towns\n\u2013 all in rural America. There\u2019s a rural gentrification epidemic that\u2019s not\ngetting much attention in major media. And it points to underlying, structural\nproblems that this country needs to address. The same problems that create\nghost towns, in fact.\n\nThere\u2019s not just one factor behind ghost towns. Capitalism is of course the\ndriver in many ways, but settler-colonialism and the willingness to ravage the\nland, before then abandoning it, and multiple other systemic factors play\ntheir parts. As was recently written in\n\nSpirit of Solidarity\n\n, the ongoing farm crisis and the consolidation of agriculture, devastating\nsmall, family farms and ranches is fundamental to the decay of large swathes\nof rural America. That piece continues:\n\n> \"The shuttering of much of American manufacturing, with jobs sent overseas;\n> the devastating environmental impact that industry has had on many small\n> towns, including the boom and bust cycle of resource extraction that makes\n> work unpredictable; all of the same factors of technology that are making\n> everyone more lonely and disconnected from each other have devastated rural\n> life and communities; and many other factors are also responsible.\"\n\nOur work is 100% reader-supported.

You see hollowed out towns,\nwith nowhere to eat but a Dairy Queen. Then, if you happen to get to Montana,\nyou see something strange. Montana is a state that has examples of both\nphenomena. Driving across the state from east to west is the experience of\ntransitioning from what many people consider flyover country to some of the\nmost coveted small, Western cities and towns. Eastern Montana is prairie\ncountry that borders the Dakotas and Wyoming. Prairies are incredible,\nbeautiful ecosystems \u2013 but that\u2019s not how most of America sees them when\ncompared to the towering Rocky Mountains you start to glimpse as you drive\nwest across Montana.\n\nEastern Montana prairie and ranch land\n\nIn western Montana\u2019s Rocky Mountains, small cities like Bozeman and Missoula,\nand towns like Whitefish and Kalispell are anything but decaying. These are\nthe parts of Montana that have been the most popular and populated for a good\nlong while, largely because they boast the kind of picturesque beauty that\nmost people value. They also offer quick access to all types of recreating,\nincluding the activities that people pay a lot of money for \u2013 like downhill\nskiing and fly fishing trips on clear, trout-filled rivers \u2013 as well as\nrecreating that is more available to the common man, such as hiking, biking,\nand inner-tubing down the river.\n\nAs eastern Montana\u2019s population has dwindled, western Montana has boomed,\nincluding a very noticeable influx during the pandemic. This boom has\nbasically led to gentrification throughout western Montana, with massive\nhousing shortages in places that, for the most part, never built up in the\n20th century to support larger populations like much of the East and Midwest\ndid. There\u2019s no such thing in most of western Montana as an affordable old\nfixer-upper from the first half of the 20th century. There is such a thing as\na mid-2000s drywall duplex for 500k.\n\nThe Bridger Range comes into view as you drive west from eastern Montana along\nI-90\n\nThis trend is not unique to Montana. Similar reports have been coming out\nacross the West, particularly from areas that people want a slice of \u2013\nbeautiful areas where they can move to work remote and have a better quality\nof life, or where they can purchase their second home (or third, or fourth).\nSome places out West have been havens for the wealthy for a while, such as\nJackson Hole, Wyoming (here and here and here are realtors\u2019 blog posts about\nwhy you should buy your second home there), or Sun Valley, Idaho where Disney\nCEO Bob Iger complained about the Hollywood actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 strikes from\na yearly billionaire camp he attends.\n\nEven Montana has Big Sky, a now strange little place south of Bozeman, home to\nthe Yellowstone Club, where the ultra-rich have homes and memberships. The\nlist of members and past members includes Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Justin\nTimberlake, Jennifer Lopez, Tom Brady, the CEOs of major tech and finance\ncompanies, and more.\n\nOf course, these areas like Jackson Hole, Sun Valley, and Big Sky are weird \u2013\nwhen a place becomes a playground for the ultra-wealthy, it\u2019s kind of lost to\neveryone else. But there are lots of places, not just in the West, but across\nthe country, that have been undergoing big changes, very quickly. And a lot of\nthese changes look like people moving in who aren\u2019t the ultra-wealthy or\ncelebrities, but generally have more money than the people living there; may\nhave access to work outside of the area; and bring their tastes and norms with\nthem \u2013 and have the buying power to change the landscape of the businesses,\nreal estate, and culture of an area quite quickly.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that change is inevitable. Places and landscapes are\nalways changing, and people have been griping about it for as long as people\nhave been living in built-up societies. Especially in North America where\ncolonial settlement made over the land and place in the image of settlers at\nthe expense of the people already here, we\u2019ve been set up for cycles of\ndisplacement and drastic change from the beginning. It\u2019s also true that\ngentrification is not a new thing \u2013 it\u2019s something that many people of color\nand poor people, especially in more populated areas have been experiencing for\ndecades.\n\nShare\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a big mistake to downplay what\u2019s happening in the West and\naround the country right now. The supercharged, mass displacement and\nprecarity of working people that we\u2019re seeing tells us a lot about the stage\nof capitalism that we\u2019re living in. It ties in so many factors: what kinds of\nlabor different classes of people are doing, and will do in the future; how\nthe continued siphoning of wealth upward is going to affect the many below;\nhow important land, property, and space are, and will continue to be in the\ncoming decades; how people react to control and surveillance, and search for\nplaces to try to escape; and how climate change, driven by our economy, is\ngoing to affect where people live, and how we live.\n\nLiving in places rich in land and space that are experiencing these types of\nchanges pretty quickly is kind of a scary harbinger for the future. At the\nsame time, I\u2019d rather be in Missoula, Montana where the place doesn\u2019t feel\nhollowed-out, than in downtown St. Louis or in Quinter, Kansas. The thing is,\nthough, what Missoula and Bozeman and St. Louis and Quinter all have in common\nis that the ghosts of the past and the displaced are there \u2013 they\u2019re just\neasier to ignore when life is bumping all around you.\n\nWe will never be living without the ghosts of people and life that have been\nsacrificed to make this country, but we certainly could be living in\ncommunities and towns and cities where we don\u2019t have to choose gentrification\nor decay. There are no perfect examples, but between the places we\u2019ve lived\nand the places we\u2019ve been, two come to mind: Laramie, Wyoming and Iowa City.\n\nPhoto by Seth Dewey on Unsplash\n\n####\n\nThe rare in-between\n\nIn Laramie, home of the University of Wyoming, home prices are a little below\nthe national average. The mean is about $350,000, which we can all agree is\ntelling us the national average is too high, but for a college town out West\nthey\u2019re actually doing pretty well. In Iowa City, costs are lower, although\nthey\u2019ve increased a bit recently. The average home costs around $280,000, and\nthe median rent is roughtly $1,150. Overall, it\u2019s a more affordable place to\nlive than most of this country, and as the home of the massive University of\nIowa it\u2019s fortunate that prices haven\u2019t gone up further. But here\u2019s the thing\n\u2013 it\u2019s not just that these two towns haven\u2019t gotten exceedingly expensive \u2013\nit\u2019s also that they haven\u2019t decayed.\n\nBoth Laramie and Iowa City sit in the middle of areas where the landscape is\ndotted with fading towns, towns where a few too many storefronts are empty,\nwhere a lot of folks might get their groceries at the gas station if they\ndon\u2019t want to drive another 20 miles. And yet these two small cities are\nhealthy, vibrant, and still not overly expensive. They\u2019re not perfect, that\u2019s\nfor sure, but they\u2019re two examples in rural America that both haven\u2019t decayed\nand also haven\u2019t become immensely gentrified; they\u2019re Goldilocks towns.\n\nThe major common thread between both Laramie and Iowa City is that they house\nflagship state universities. Granted, in Wyoming the University of Wyoming in\nLaramie is the only state university campus, but you get the idea. Each town\nis infused with public funding and young people, which in turn brings economic\nprosperity and cultural energy. And each has certain innovative elements that\ncannot be found in surrounding towns. In Laramie you get nifty stuff like a\nhuge old school converted into a community civic center, with a coffee shop,\nart studio space, event venue and more. In Iowa City the center of town is the\npedestrian mall, a small square of city blocks where cars cannot go, so you\nget foot traffic and occasional performers in the heart of town, not traffic.\nThe little zone also happens to have numerous bars, stores, restaurants, and\nthe library. Now, why aren\u2019t Laramie and Iowa City experiencing the kind of\ngentrification that Bozeman or Missoula, Montana are? Probably because they\u2019re\nnot located in the picturesque mountains, and aren\u2019t such a lure for scenic-\nseekers and recreaters. Laramie in particular has windy and harsh winters,\nwhich also makes it less desirable, despite the town\u2019s other features.\n\nShare\n\nPhoto by Matthew Lancaster on Unsplash\n\nNow, again, these towns are a little unusual. The big college campuses offer\nsomething special, and are made possible by investment from the state. But,\nthis shouldn\u2019t be so special, so unusual. Our cities being less prone to\ndecay, less prone to the ups and down of markets out shouldn\u2019t be unique. And\nour towns being more immune to immense gentrification due to the flow of\npeople and capital shouldn\u2019t be unique either. Public investment, public money\nhelping to stabilize our communities should and could be the norm. In this\ncountry we preach public control, we preach that this is all for the people\nand by the people, but the way we let real estate interests run roughshod over\nour neighborhoods, let mass displacement and eviction be normal, let it become\nmore expensive for most of us to live so that a few people can profit\nimmensely has nothing to do with \u201cthe people\u201d and everything to do with big\nbusiness. And it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\n\nBozeman, the Montana city where the average home price is reaching a million\ndollars, is fighting back. It\u2019s also a college town, home to Montana State,\nwhich has protected the city from decay. But at the same time it\u2019s seen an\nuncontrollable flood of wealthy people from across the country drawn to the\nbeautiful landscapes and opportunities to ski and fish and hike. The Tiger\nWoods and Bill Gates of the world own mansions nearby, and gobble up ranches.\nThe town doesn\u2019t have control of the land, the real estate, or the\nskyrocketing home prices. That is, until now. Bozeman residents have recently\nstarted taking back control by organizing a powerful tenants union. They\u2019ve\ngotten one of their founders elected mayor, banned most Airbnbs, and are just\ngetting started. They\u2019re showing us a way forward.\n\nWe can have public investment. We can have public ownership and control of\nhousing and businesses. A tenants union is just one tool we can use to reclaim\npower in our communities. There\u2019s also community land trusts, unions, worker\nowned businesses, and much more. The roofs over our heads and the jobs that\nsustain us don\u2019t need to just be subject to the whims of markets and\ncapitalists. Public universities, and how they benefit the towns around them,\nare just one example of this phenomenon, of the consistency and reliability we\ncan provide for one another with public investment in our own communities and\nwith collective control of our own communities. We shouldn\u2019t have small towns\nwhere people are forced to move out because they can\u2019t afford to live on the\nblock where their parents lived. And, at the same time, we shouldn\u2019t have\ntowns where people have to leave because they simply can\u2019t find a job. We can\nhave security and stability in our homes, and in our lives \u2013 if we build it.\n\nThanks for reading!
