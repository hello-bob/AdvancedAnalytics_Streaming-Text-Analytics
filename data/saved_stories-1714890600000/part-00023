The aluminum tube is detonated\nat the end extending out and beyond the copper-wire helix. On the other end a\ntransformer enables the generator to work more efficiently into the electrical\nload.\n\nAn explosively pumped flux compression generator (EPFCG) is a device used to\ngenerate a high-power electromagnetic pulse by compressing magnetic flux using\nhigh explosive.\n\nAn EPFCG only ever generates a single pulse as the device is physically\ndestroyed during operation. They require a starting current pulse to operate,\nusually supplied by capacitors.\n\nExplosively pumped flux compression generators are used to create ultrahigh\nmagnetic fields in physics and materials science research^[1] and extremely\nintense pulses of electric current for pulsed power applications. They are\nbeing investigated as power sources for electronic warfare devices known as\ntransient electromagnetic devices that generate an electromagnetic pulse\nwithout the costs, side effects, or enormous range of a nuclear\nelectromagnetic pulse device.\n\nThe first work on these generators was conducted by the VNIIEF center for\nnuclear research in Sarov in the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1950s\nfollowed by Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nAt the start of the 1950s, the need for very short and powerful electrical\npulses became evident to Soviet scientists conducting nuclear fusion research.\nThe Marx generator, which stores energy in capacitors, was the only device\ncapable at the time of producing such high power pulses. The prohibitive cost\nof the capacitors required to obtain the desired power motivated the search\nfor a more economical device. The first magneto-explosive generators, which\nfollowed from the ideas of Andrei Sakharov, were designed to fill this\nrole.^[2]^[3]\n\n## Mechanics[edit]\n\nFor a constant intensity magnetic field of magnitude B traversing a surface S,\nthe flux \u03a6 is equal to B times S.\n\nMagneto-explosive generators use a technique called \"magnetic flux\ncompression\", described in detail below. The technique is made possible when\nthe time scales over which the device operates are sufficiently brief that\nresistive current loss is negligible, and the magnetic flux through any\nsurface surrounded by a conductor (copper wire, for example) remains constant,\neven though the size and shape of the surface may change.\n\nThis flux conservation can be demonstrated from Maxwell's equations. The most\nintuitive explanation of this conservation of enclosed flux follows from\nLenz's law, which says that any change in the flux through an electric circuit\nwill cause a current in the circuit which will oppose the change. For this\nreason, reducing the area of the surface enclosed by a closed loop conductor\nwith a magnetic field passing through it, which would reduce the magnetic\nflux, results in the induction of current in the electrical conductor, which\ntends to keep the enclosed flux at its original value. In magneto-explosive\ngenerators, the reduction in area is accomplished by detonating explosives\npacked around a conductive tube or disk, so the resulting implosion compresses\nthe tube or disk.^[4] Since flux is equal to the magnitude of the magnetic\nfield multiplied by the area of the surface, as the surface area shrinks the\nmagnetic field strength inside the conductor increases. The compression\nprocess partially transforms the chemical energy of the explosives into the\nenergy of an intense magnetic field surrounded by a correspondingly large\nelectric current.\n\nThe purpose of the flux generator can be either the generation of an extremely\nstrong magnetic field pulse, or an extremely strong electric current pulse; in\nthe latter case the closed conductor is attached to an external electric\ncircuit. This technique has been used to create the most intense manmade\nmagnetic fields on Earth; fields up to about 1000 teslas (about 1000 times the\nstrength of a typical neodymium permanent magnet) can be created for a few\nmicroseconds.\n\n### Elementary description of flux compression[edit]\n\nFig. 1: Original magnetic field lines.\n\nAn external magnetic field (blue lines) threads a closed ring made of a\nperfect conductor (with zero resistance). The total magnetic flux through the\nring is equal to the magnetic field multiplied by the area of the surface\nspanning the ring. The nine field lines represent the magnetic flux threading\nthe ring.\n\nFig. 2: Configuration after the ring's diameter has been reduced.\n\nSuppose the ring is deformed, reducing its cross-sectional area. The magnetic\nflux threading the ring, represented by five field lines, is reduced by the\nsame ratio as the area of the ring. The variation of the magnetic flux induces\na current (red arrows) in the ring by Faraday's law of induction, which in\nturn creates a new magnetic field circling the wire (green arrows) by Ampere's\ncircuital law. The new magnetic field opposes the field outside the ring but\nadds to the field inside, so that the total flux in the interior of the ring\nis maintained: four green field lines added to the five blue lines give the\noriginal nine field lines.\n\nFig. 3: Magnetic field lines after compression.\n\nBy adding together the external magnetic field and the induced field, it can\nbe shown that the net result is that the magnetic field lines originally\nthreading the hole stay inside the hole, thus flux is conserved, and a current\nhas been created in the conductive ring. The magnetic field lines are\n\"pinched\" closer together, so the (average) magnetic field intensity inside\nthe ring increases by the ratio of the original area to the final area.\n\n## The various types of generators[edit]\n\nThe simple basic principle of flux compression can be applied in a variety of\ndifferent ways. Soviet scientists at the VNIIEF in Sarov, pioneers in this\ndomain, conceived of three different types of generators:^[5]^[3]^[6]\n\n  * In the first type of generator (MK-1, 1951) developed by Robert Lyudaev, the magnetic flux produced by a wound conductor is confined to the interior of a hollow metallic tube surrounded by explosives, and submitted to a violent compression when the explosives are fired; a device of the same type was developed in the United States a dozen years later by C. M. (Max) Fowler's team at Los Alamos.\n  * In the second type of generator (MK-2, 1952), the magnetic flux, confined between the windings of the external conductor and a central conductive tube filled with explosive, is compressed by the conical 'piston' created by the deformation of the central tube as the detonation wave travels across the device.\n  * A third type of generator (DEMG), developed by Vladimir Chernyshev, is cylindrical, and contains a stack of concave metallic disks, facing each other in pairs, to create hollow modules (with the number varying according to the desired power), and separated by explosives; each module functions as an independent generator.\n\nSuch generators can, if necessary, be utilised independently, or even\nassembled in a chain of successive stages: the energy produced by each\ngenerator is transferred to the next, which amplifies the pulse, and so on.\nFor example, it is foreseen that the DEMG generator will be supplied by a MK-2\ntype generator.\n\nAlso, these can be either destructed just after a experiment, or used again\nand again while complying acceptable time to use.^[7]\n\n### Hollow tube generators[edit]\n\nIn the spring of 1952, R. Z. Lyudaev, E. A. Feoktistova, G. A. Tsyrkov, and A.\nA. Chvileva undertook the first experiment with this type of generator, with\nthe goal of obtaining a very high magnetic field.\n\nHollow tube generator.\n\nThe MK-1 generator functions as follows:\n\n  * A longitudinal magnetic field is produced inside a hollow metallic conductor, by discharging a bank of capacitors into the solenoid that surrounds the cylinder. To ensure a rapid penetration of the field in the cylinder, there is a slit in the cylinder, which closes rapidly as the cylinder deforms;\n  * The explosive charge placed around the tube is detonated in a manner that ensures that the compression of the cylinder commences when the current through the solenoid is at its maximum;\n  * The convergent cylindrical shock wave unleashed by the explosion produces a rapid contraction (greater than 1 km/s) of the central cylinder, compressing the magnetic field, and creating an inductive current, as per the explanation above (the speed of contraction permits, to first approximation, the neglect of Joule losses and the consideration of the cylinder as a perfect conductor).\n\nThe first experiments were able to attain magnetic fields of millions of gauss\n(hundreds of teslas), given an initial field of 30 kG (3 T) which is in the\nfree space \"air\" the same as H = B/\u03bc_0 = (3 V_s/m^2) / (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^\u22127 V_s/Am) =\n2.387\u00d710^6 A/m (approximately 2.4 MA/m).\n\n### Helical generators[edit]\n\nHelical generators were principally conceived to deliver an intense current to\na load situated at a safe distance. They are frequently used as the first\nstage of a multi-stage generator, with the exit current used to generate a\nvery intense magnetic field in a second generator.\n\nFunction of a helical generator.\n\nThe MK-2 generators function as follows:\n\n  * A longitudinal magnetic field is produced in between a metallic conductor and a surrounding solenoid, by discharging a battery of capacitors into the solenoid;\n  * After the charge is ignited, a detonation wave propagates in the explosive charge placed in the interior of the central metallic tube (from left to right on the figure);\n  * Under the effect of the pressure of the detonation wave, the tube deforms and becomes a cone which contacts the helically wrapped coil, diminishing the number of turns not short-circuited, compressing the magnetic field and creating an inductive current;\n  * At the point of maximal flux compression, the load switch is opened, which then delivers the maximal current to the load.\n\nThe MK-2 generator is particularly interesting for the production of intense\ncurrents, up to 10^8 A (100 MA), as well as a very high energy magnetic field,\nas up to 20% of the explosive energy can be converted to magnetic energy, and\nthe field strength can attain 2 \u00d7 10^6 gauss (200 T).\n\nThe practical realization of high performance MK-2 systems required the\npursuit of fundamental studies by a large team of researchers; this was\neffectively achieved by 1956, following the production of the first MK-2\ngenerator in 1952, and the achievement of currents over 100 megaamperes from\n1953.\n\n### Disc generators[edit]\n\nDisc generators.\n\nA DEMG generator functions as follows:\n\n  * Conductive metallic discs, assembled in facing pairs to create hollow modules having the form of a lined torus, with explosive packed between pairs of modules, are stacked inside a cylinder;^[8] the number of modules can vary according to the desired power (the figure shows a device of 15 modules), as well as the radius of the discs (of the order of 20 to 40 cm).\n  * Current runs through the device, supplied by a MK-2 generator, and an intense magnetic field is created inside each module.\n  * When initiated, the explosion begins on the axis and propagates radially outwards, deforming the disc shaped protuberances with triangular section and pushing them away from the axis. The outward movement of this section of conductor plays the role of a piston.\n  * As the explosion proceeds, the magnetic field is compressed in the inside of each module by the conductive piston and the simultaneous drawing together of the inner faces, also creating an inductive current.\n  * As the induced current attains its maximum, the fuse opening switch fuses and the load switch simultaneously closes, allowing the current to be delivered to the load (the mechanism for the operation of the load switch is not explained in available documentation).\n\nSystems using up to 25 modules have been developed at VNIIEF. Output of 100 MJ\nat 256 MA have been produced by a generator a metre in diameter composed of\nthree modules.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Pinch (plasma physics)\n  * Explosive-driven ferroelectric generator\n  * Explosive-driven ferromagnetic generator\n  * Explosively pumped gas dynamic laser\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Solem, J.
