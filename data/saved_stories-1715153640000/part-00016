So please stop reading now\nand continue once you\u2019ve found the answer.\n\nGot the answer? Here are two common ways of getting it:\n\nYou could convert 7 1/4 into 29/4, subtract 3/4 from that to get 26/4, and\nreduce that fraction to get 13/2, or 6 1/2.\n\nOr, you could reason that, because increasing each of two numbers by 1/4\ndoesn\u2019t change the difference between them (or to put it in daily-life terms,\nthe height-difference between two barefoot people doesn\u2019t change if they both\nput on 1/4-inch shoes), 7 1/4 minus 3/4 equals (7 1/4 + 1/4) minus (3/4 +\n1/4), which equals 7 1/2 minus 1, or 6 1/2. Alternatively, you could reason\nthat 7 1/4 minus 3/4 equals (7 1/4 \u2212 1/4) minus (3/4 \u2212 1/4), which is 7 minus\n1/2, or 6 1/2; same idea, same answer. Pictorially:\n\nThe red lines are all the same length, and the length of each red line equals\nthe difference between the two numbers on the ruler associated with its\nendpoints.\n\nDid you solve the problem the second way, nudging the two numbers upward or\ndownward? Congratulations: you\u2019re thinking like a German. But if you solved\nthe problem the first way, converting the mixed fractions into improper\nfractions, then I have bad news: you\u2019re thinking like a Jew.^1\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re actually Jewish; it\u2019s possible that some of your math\nteachers were. You might not have known that they were Jewish at the time;\nthey might have had wholesome Aryan looks and deceptively Christian names. And\nyou may have been too young to realize that they were infecting you with\nJewish mathematics.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m messing with you here. My opening paragraphs parrot the ideas\nof a small but pivotal group of early twentieth-century German mathematicians,\none of whom, Oswald Teichm\u00fcller, wrote:\n\n\u201cMany academic courses, especially the differential and integral calculus,\nhave at the same time educative value, inducting the pupil not only to a\nconceptual world but also to a different frame of mind. But since the latter\ndepends very substantially on the racial composition of the individual, it\nfollows that an Aryan student should not be allowed to be trained by a Jewish\nteacher.\u201d\n\nTeichm\u00fcller was writing in the early years of Hitler\u2019s ascendancy, explaining\nwhy it was necesssary (hey, nothing personal!) for the University of G\u00f6ttingen\nto fire all its Jewish mathematicians, including his own former teacher Emmy\nNoether, upon whose advances some of his own work was founded.\n\nI wrote about Noether earlier this year \u2013 see my essay \u201cPlus and Times Set\nFree\u201d \u2013 and in the course of writing that essay I learned a lot about Jewish\nmathematicians in Germany in the half-century leading up to the 1930s. The\narticles listed in the References of that essay and this one were extremely\nhelpful. In the end I omitted most of the material I\u2019d gathered, since my\nessay was already long-ish. But here I will share some of the most eye-opening\nthings I learned. (If you spot any errors, please assume that they\u2019re mine\nalone.) As you read, keep in mind that what I say about the experience of Jews\nin early 20th century Germany has applications to other people at other times\nin other places.\n\nTHE POWER OF TWO CLASHING STEREOTYPES\n\nI won\u2019t dwell on the long history of antisemitism in Europe preceding the\nmid-1800s. The stigma against Jews has proved to be remarkably versatile, able\nto mutate as circumstances required. Statistician Francis Galton and his\nfellow English eugenicists thought of Jews as being unintelligent; nowadays\nthe counter-stereotype of Jews as being shrewd is dominant. This is an essay\nabout stereotypes, but it should be kept in mind that often stigma precedes\nstereotype, with stereotypes being manufactured to retrospectively justify a\nstigma.\n\nMathematical historian David Rowe writes: \u201cA standard stereotype presumed that\nJews had a distinctly different way of thinking about mathematics stemming\nfrom a Talmudic tradition that favored abstract theorizing, while neglecting\nfields with close ties to the physical sciences.\u201d At the same time, there was\nthe stereotype I trotted out at the start of this essay: Jewish minds trudge\nalong on the ground with plodding logic and computation while Germanic minds\nare more conceptual. The latter stereotype was codified by the German\npsychologist and ardent Nazi Erich Rudolph Jaensch, who divided mathematicians\ninto J-type and S-type. (Perhaps confusingly, Jews were S-type, not J-type.)\nAccording to Jaensch, the \u201cintegrative\u201d (J-type) Germanic mind is conceptual\nand geometric whereas the \u201cdissolutive\u201d (S-type) Jewish mind is merely\nlogical.^2 If you\u2019re confused about the difference between \u201cconceptual\nthinking\u201d and \u201cabstract theorizing\u201d, that\u2019s kind of the point. The handy thing\nabout having two opposed stereotypes is that you can use whichever one the\noccasion demands. (\u201cYour ideas are abstract; mine are conceptual.\u201d)\n\nThe fact is that, just as an expert trial lawyer can cross-examine a witness\nfor the defense so as to support the case for the prosecution (or vice versa\nas needed), the human mind is extremely good at suborning truth itself,\ntwisting evidence so that it seems to support what we already believe. Suppose\nfor instance that a detailed study of classroom pedagogy in early 20th century\nGermany had revealed that it was in fact mostly Jewish students, not their\nChristian classmates, who preferred the second, quicker method of computing 7\n1/4 minus 3/4. A German race-theorist might initially be confounded by such a\nfinding but then conclude that replacing the question \u201cWhat is 7 1/4 minus\n3/4?\u201d by the question \u201cWhat is 7 minus 1/2?\u201d (answering a question with a\nquestion!) is a trick, and a shrewd one at that: Jewish mathematics. Benjamin\nFranklin wrote: \u201cSo convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature,\nsince it enables one to find or make a reason for every thing one has a mind\nto do.\u201d This applies especially to the activity of sorting people into groups;\nit\u2019s easy for us to see patterns that aren\u2019t there, especially the patterns\nwe\u2019re expecting to find.\n\nMathematicians spend a lot of their time hunting for patterns, but much of the\nday-to-day work of mathematical progress is deduction, and in the Teichm\u00fcller\nquote I gave earlier (\u201cit follows that an Aryan student should not be allowed\nto be trained by a Jewish teacher\u201d) one can hear a distorted echo of deductive\nreasoning. The certitude that adheres to mathematical facts can lead a\nmathematician to drop the habit of doubt that in the real, non-mathematical\nworld can be helpful in pulling us back from the edge of doing terrible\nthings. In 1923, mathematician Theodor Vahlen wrote \u201cMathematics becomes a\nmirror of the races and proves the presence of racial qualities in the\nintellectual realm so to speak with mathematical, therefore incontrovertible,\ncertainty.\u201d Ten years later he joined the SS.\n\nTHE WRONG SIDE OF THE EQUATION\n\nPermit me to ruin for you a famous and lovely description of mathematics\nproposed by the German mathematician Karl Weierstrass, namely, \u201cA\nmathematician who is not something of a poet will never be a complete\nmathematician.\u201d What a wonderful way to convey the artistic side of\nmathematics, so invisible to 99.99% of the world but so important to those of\nus who court the mathematical muse! Here is a fuller quote, taken from a\nletter Weierstrass wrote to the Russian mathematician Sonya Kovalevsky which\nincludes an assessment of the Jewish mathematician Leopold Kronecker: \u201cHe\nshares the shortcoming that one finds in many intelligent people, especially\nthose of Semitic stock; he does not possess sufficient fantasy (intuition, I\nwould prefer to say). And it is true, a mathematician who is not something of\na poet will never be a complete mathematician. Comparisons are instructive: an\nall-embracing vision focusing on the loftiest of ideals distinguishes Abel\nfrom Jacobi, Riemann from his contemporaries Eisenstein and Rosenhain, and\nHelmholtz from Kirchhoff (although the latter is without a drop of Semitic\nblood) in an altogether splendid manner.\u201d (Abel was Christian, Jacobi was\nJewish, Riemann was Christian, etc.) A mathematical historian who knows the\nfamous Weierstrass quote without knowing about the antisemitic bits will never\nbe a complete mathematical historian.\n\nFrom the chebfun webpage A pathological function of Weierstrass.\n\nBut hang on: why is Weierstrass comparing Helmholtz with Kirchhoff to shore up\nhis claim of a correlation between race and mathematical style when he himself\nadmits that neither man is Jewish? Such inconsistencies are a hallmark of the\ntypology game. Weierstrass himself, as a critic of careless intuition and a\nproponent of rigor, could have been assailed by Jaensch as an S-type,\ndissolution-loving mathematician. Indeed, the French mathematician Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 complained, apropos of the counterintuitive, un-graphable function\nthat Weierstrass had unleashed upon the world (and which now bears his name),\n\u201cIn the old days when people invented a new function they had something useful\nin mind; now, they invent them deliberately just to invalidate our ancestors\u2019\nreasoning.\u201d Some might say that the Weierstrass function was a \u201chostile\u201d piece\nof mathematics, to borrow a word that Jaensch\u2019s disciple Ludwig Bieberbach\nused in his description of the S-type. But Bieberbach found a way to classify\nWeierstrass as J-type anyway. In the apt words of Paulo Mancosu, \u201cBieberbach\nwas forced to do a lot of gerrymandering to make sure that important German\nmathematicians did not end up on the wrong side of the equation.\u201d\n\nGerman views about a distinct Jewish style of mathematics ranged from Felix\nKlein\u2019s \u201cIt would seem as if a strong naive space-intuition were an attribute\npre-eminently of the Teutonic race, while the critical, purely logical sense\nis more fully developed in the Latin and Hebrew races\u201d to Alexander von\nBrill\u2019s \u201cThe effect of the Jews on Germanic peoples is like alcohol on the\nindividual; in small doses they are stimulating and invigorating, but in large\nquantities devastating like poison\u201d and onward to Ludwig Bieberbach\u2019s \u201cThere\nis a German and a Jewish mathematics, two worlds, separated by an unbridgeable\nchasm.\u201d Note that Klein lumped together Jews and \u201cLatin\u201d peoples; other\nwritings of the period identified more specific national styles. Some of the\nwritings of the period eschew a simplistic \u201cOur math good; your math bad\u201d vibe\nand instead advocate a kind of academic apartheid. Let a hundred styles of\nmathematics bloom around the world, but within the borders of the Fatherland\nlet the flowering of German mathematics be uncorrupted by alien influences!\n(Curiously, the precise location in which Jewish mathematics could have its\nown flowering was never specified.)\n\nI\u2019m focussing my essay on (some) Germans\u2019 assessments of Jewish mathematics,\nbut to understand why those Germans felt so comfortable classifying\nmathematicians into national and racial types, it\u2019s helpful to know that this\nkind of classification was a well-established European intellectual pastime.\nHere\u2019s an example from the French historian of science Pierre Durhem who,\nwriting in between the two World Wars, contrasted French and German styles of\nscience: \u201cTo start from clear principles ... then to make progress step by\nstep, patiently, painstakingly, at a pace that the rules of deductive logic\ndiscipline with extreme severity: this is what German genius excels at ... .\nThe Germans lack the spirit of subtlety.\u201d This game of comparing Our Culture\nto Their Culture was all the rage in the fanciest European salons back before\nNational Socialism gave nationalism a bad name.\n\nIf it were possible to put an entire culture on the psychoanalytic couch, I\nmight say to 1930s-era German academia, \u201cAh, so it hurts when other people\ncall you overly logical? Perhaps you wish to project this description onto\nother people?\u201d\n\nONE GERMAN-JEWISH FAMILY\n\nThe Noether family only slightly fit into the image of Jewish science\npromulgated by the Nazis. The father, Max, did work in both pure mathematics\nand physics. Max\u2019s first child, Emmy, became the famous pure mathematician I\nwrote about in \u201cPlus and Times Set Free\u201d. Max\u2019s second child, Alfred, obtained\na PhD in chemistry (though he died in 1918 before his career got underway).\nMax\u2019s third child, Fritz, pursued applied mathematics.\n\nFor a time Emmy\u2019s main professional obstacle was her sex, but some German\nmathematicians regarded her love of abstraction as \u201cHebraic\u201d. Meanwhile,\nGerman antisemitism was at a high simmer, ready to become a low boil if the\ntemperature rose just a little bit higher. This was especially true in\nG\u00f6ttingen, a university town whose undergraduates were predominantly right-\nwing and whose humanities professors sympathized with the undergraduates.\n\nIn April of 1933, the Reich Ministry of the Interior issued a Law for the\nRestoration of the Professional Civil Service, excluding racial and political\n\u201cenemies\u201d of the Nazi regime from all forms of government service. The edict\ndid not automatically expel Jewish professors from their jobs, but it gave\nuniversities the right to expel them. Noether\u2019s students were worried that she\nwould be fired, and they wrote a letter on her behalf, arguing that \u201cIt is no\ncoincidence that all her students are Aryans; this is due to her essential\nconception of mathematics, which corresponds entirely to an Aryan way of\nthinking.\u201d Likewise, her collaborator and friend Helmut Hasse wrote that \u201cIn\nno sense can one call her mathematics \u2018alien\u2019. On the contrary, it has a\nquality much like the typical German mindset, which in its nature favors the\nintellectual, the theoretical, and the ideal rather than such qualities as\npurpose, material success, or the real. That this is so can be seen from the\nfact that the vast majority of German mathematicians who have found their way\nto her school over the past two decades are of Aryan descent.\u201d Suddenly\nNoether\u2019s mathematics was not Hebraic after all.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter; Noether lost her position that spring, as did most of the\nother Jewish mathematicians at G\u00f6ttingen. Her esteemed colleague Edmund Landau\nheld on for a bit longer, but in the fall Teichm\u00fcller led a student boycott of\nLandau\u2019s lectures, and by February of 1934 Landau too was gone. Later that\nyear the Nazi Minister of Culture asked David Hilbert, G\u00f6ttingen\u2019s most\neminent mathematician and Noether\u2019s champion, whether it was true that the\nMathematics Institute had suffered because of the expulsion of its Jewish\nfaculty. Hilbert replied: \u201cSuffered? It hasn\u2019t suffered, Herr Minister. It\njust doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\n\nHilbert\u2019s dark quip was not literally true; people still showed up for work at\nthe Institute. Its new director was Hasse, an old-school German nationalist\nwho disliked the antisemitism of Teichm\u00fcller and his crowd but who felt that\nHitler was the only person who could restore Germany to its former glory.\nHasse kept the lights on at the institute in a physical sense, but the torch\nof mathematical learning that had once been G\u00f6ttingen had been snuffed out,\nnever to be rekindled.\n\nDuring that year, a young American mathematician named Saunders Mac Lane,\ndoing doctoral work at G\u00f6ttingen, got to view the death of the Mathematics\nInstitute from a front-row seat, and his reminiscence Mathematics at G\u00f6ttingen\nunder the Nazis is well worth reading in its entirety. Two passages stood out\nfor me. One was his concluding assessment: \u201cNow in retrospect, the whole\ndevelopment is a decisive demonstration of the damage done to academic and\nmathematical life by any subordination to populism, political pressure and\nproposed political principles.\u201d The other was a passage from a letter he wrote\nto his mother in 1933. \u201cI have recently become impressed with the great\nvariety of opinions within the Nazi movement. All Nazis do not think alike,\neven though it may externally seem as if they did!\u201d If I had been in young\nSaunders\u2019 shoes, I would have taken comfort in that diversity of opinion,\nexpecting that a party made of such disparate bedfellows would dissipate its\nenergy in internal squabbling and not accomplish much.\n\nBut in this I would have been tragically mistaken. Despite the many\ncontradictions of Nazi ideology, the party\u2019s hold on power only solidified\nwith the passage of time. Resentment of Germany\u2019s humiliation twenty years\nearlier and a thirst for vengeance proved sufficiently cohesive to bind the\nmovement together, especially as the regime learned which groups served as the\nbest targets of the people\u2019s rage. Bieberbach thought that the chasm between\nJewish mathematics and German mathematics could not be bridged, but meanwhile,\nthe chasm between old-fashioned nationalism, rabid antisemitism, pagan\nmysticism, and cynical opportunism proved to be eminently bridgeable.\n\nEmmy Noether was one of the lucky ones; she moved to the U.S. where she had a\nhappy year before complications following what should have been routine\nsurgery unexpectedly cut her life short. Her brother Fritz was not so lucky.\nAlthough his service in the First World War qualified him for an exemption\nfrom the 1933 law, some students at the University of Breslau where Fritz\ntaught told the University\u2019s Rektor that having Noether on the faculty \u201cin\nlarge measure contradicts the Aryan principle.\u201d Later that year the students\nturned up the heat, accusing Fritz of holding left-wing political views.\nSensing that he had no future in Germany, Fritz moved to Russia. He was\nimprisoned in 1938 and executed in 1941 on a trumped-up charge of anti-Soviet\nagitation (reversed as baseless in 1988).\n\nIronically, after the war, the style of abstract algebra Noether had pioneered\nwasn\u2019t called Jewish; it was called German. Still later, after Bourbaki got\nahold of it, the approach was deemed French. Building on the work of Noether\nand Bourbaki, Saunders Mac Lane built a new super-abstract approach to\nmathematics called category theory. As far as I know, nobody has called it\nScottish mathematics. (Yet.) Then again, Mac Lane\u2019s collaborator in this\nenterprise was Samuel Eilenberg, so, someone\u2019s bound to call category theory\nJewish mathematics, eventually.\n\nHOW SHALL WE DISCUSS DIFFERENCES?\n\nTaste plays as big a role in mathematics as it does in art, determining a\nmathematician\u2019s style and choice of projects, and young mathematicians look to\ntheir elders as they develop their own personal mathematical taste. This\ntendency, writ large, has given rise to schools of mathematical thought, and\nJewish mathematicians have been just as subject to the dictates of fashion as\nanyone else. The quest for abstraction has been one such fashion. Some early\ntwentieth century mathematicians derided the quest as a fad; if so, it has\nproved to be a durable one. Perhaps there has been a tendency for Jewish\nmathematicians to be in the vanguard of this fashion, as they have been in the\nvanguard in various political and artistic movements, perhaps for reasons\nhaving to do with Jewish culture. One might try to follow this train of\nthought, but if it travels from the terrain of cultural studies into the land\nof biological determinism, I would advise jumping off the train as quickly as\npossible. That particular track leads to a wide depot with a squat tower in\nthe middle.\n\nLet\u2019s circle back to my opening example about the \u201cGerman\u201d and \u201cJewish\u201d ways\nof computing 7 1/4 minus 3/4. The example can be traced back to a student\nnamed Steckel (apparently more interested in math education than math\nresearch) who had done some teaching in Eastern Europe and who described his\nexperiences in Felix Klein\u2019s seminar \u201cPsychological Foundations of\nMathematics\u201d sometime around 1910. Mathematical historian David Rowe says that\nSteckel\u2019s presentation \u201cwas, no doubt, meant to illustrate the usual\nstereotype that Jews excelled in logical thinking, whereas Germans thought\nintuitively,\u201d and that seems likely. But what if (hypothetically) Steckel had\nseen his observation not as a cause for triumphant celebration of German\nsuperiority but as an argument for racially differentiated instruction? What\nif Steckel had dreamed of an idyllic future in which each student would be\nschooled in accordance with his or her own ancestors\u2019 unique and valued way-\nof-knowing? What if Steckel had no intention of any teachers losing their jobs\nor anyone losing their lives?\n\nMy answer is, it would have made no difference at all. Essentialist ideas like\nSteckel\u2019s have a life of their own, and can travel into contexts far from the\none in which they originated, taking on meanings not intended by their\noriginators. (Indeed, some of the Nazi Party\u2019s official race-ideology was\nborrowed from American race-theorists of earlier decades.) Steckel\u2019s\nstereotype was just one rivulet in a great stream. No single rivulet makes an\nappreciable contribution to the stream, but there would be no stream if there\nwere no rivulets.\n\nSocial scientists debate when and how stereotypes lead to persecution, and I\u2019m\nno social scientist, but it seems to me that when we say that certain other\npeople Aren\u2019t Like Us, it may sometimes help us see them for who they are, but\nit can also make us see them as Less-Than people, or even see them as less\nthan people. And dehumanization is often the final step that authorizes people\nto move beyond hateful words to hateful actions.\n\nSo, my proposed (not very helpful!) answer to the question \u201cHow shall we\ndiscuss differences?\u201d is: very, very carefully. No matter how noble your\nintentions may be, when you broadcast some generalization about a group of\npeople, it ceases to be yours and becomes the world\u2019s, and you can\u2019t know what\nyour words might mean someday.\n\nThanks to Sandi Gubin.\n\nENDNOTES\n\n#1. There are other approaches: you could for instance have rewritten 7 1/4 as\n6 5/4 and then subtracted 3/4 to get 6 2/4, or 6 1/2. Maybe that makes you\nSlavic?\n\n#2. In a future essay I\u2019ll argue that the most integrative German\nmathematician of the late 19th century was actually the incontrovertibly\nJewish Hermann Minkowski, who not only gave us a geometry of numbers and an\narithmetic of shapes but also laid the foundation for the unification of space\nand time!
