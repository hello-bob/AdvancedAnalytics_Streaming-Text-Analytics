It is largely names and bank details that have been exposed.\n\nAll salaries will be paid this month.\n\nTobias Ellwood, a Conservative MP and former soldier, told Sky News that China\n\"was probably looking at the financially vulnerable with a view that they may\nbe coerced in exchange for cash\".\n\nThe MoD hopes serving personnel will not be concerned about their safety. They\nwill be provided with advice and support tomorrow.\n\nThe contractor system is not connected to the main MoD computer systems and\nhas been taken down with a review launched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: Beijing poses 'constant' threat to western cybersecurity China\n'trying to undermine our democracy'\n\nImage: Defence Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to make a statement\ntomorrow. Pic: House of Commons\n\nThe MoD has been working at speed over the last 72 hours to understand the\nscale of the hack after it was discovered in recent days.\n\nIt is understood investigations have not so far shown any data has been taken.\n\nThis could raise questions about whether other countries with challenging\nrelationships with China will want to share sensitive intelligence with the\nUK.\n\nThis comes fewer than two months after China's \"state-affiliated actors\" have\nbeen blamed by the government for two \"malicious\" cyberattack campaigns in the\nUK.\n\nMaking a speech in the Commons, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden revealed\nthe two incidents involved an attack on the Electoral Commission - responsible\nfor overseeing elections and political finance - in 2021, and targeted attacks\nagainst China-sceptic MPs.\n\nLabour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said there are \"so many serious\nquestions for the defence secretary on this, especially from Forces personnel\nwhose details were targeted\".\n\nHe added: \"Any such hostile action is utterly unacceptable.\n\n\"Parliament will expect a full Commons statement tomorrow.\"\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith, a Conservative MP and former soldier who has been\nsanctioned by China, told Sky News: \"This is yet another example of why the UK\ngovernment must admit that China poses a systemic threat to the UK and change\nthe integrated review to reflect that.\n\n\"No more pretence, it is a malign actor, supporting Russia with money and\nmilitary equipment, working with Iran and North Korea in a new axis of\ntotalitarian states.\"\n\nMr Ellwood said: \"We are learning the hard way how art warfare is rapidly\nchanging as technology advances.\n\n\"Defending the digital terrain is now just as important as the physical - this\nis another reminder why we need to invest more in defence and security.\n\n\"Targeting the MoD's payroll and bank details was probably looking at the\nfinancially vulnerable with a view that they may be coerced in exchange for\ncash.\n\n\"And if this type of cyberattack is taking place here in the UK we can assume\nother nato countries will be targeted too.\"\n\nImage: China's president Xi Jinping is currently on a tour of Europe.
