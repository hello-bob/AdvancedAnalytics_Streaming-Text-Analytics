But in the right\nsetting and with the right competitor, it can potentially do the opposite,\ngiving developers and consumers more options. But sometimes, even with all the\nright intentions in the world, the ecosystem just doesn\u2019t work out. The\nexecution is slightly off, or it just doesn\u2019t work out as intended. That,\nultimately, is the story of 3DO, a company explicitly designed to turn gaming\ninto an open ecosystem, both on the hardware and software ends. Except, it\ndidn\u2019t really work. Today\u2019s Tedium ponders exactly why. \u2014 Ernie @ Tedium\n\nSponsored By TLDR\n\nWant a byte-sized version of Hacker News?

The price, which\nwas later undercut by an array of alternative models produced by other\nmanufacturers, played a clear factor in the console\u2019s failure, but it was not\nthe only cause of its challenges.\n\nElectronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins, who had a different POV on how the\ngaming industry should work. (Dan Farber/Flickr)\n\n### The Silicon Valley game executive who felt the Nintendo model didn\u2019t work\n\nIf you are up on your video game history, you know that, at least in the early\nyears of gaming, a lack of standards nearly killed the video game industry.\nThe willy-nilly nature of development on the Atari VCS (later the Atari 2600),\ncaused by a failure to anticipate or facilitate the rise of third-party\ndevelopment, was a primary factor behind the 1983 video game crash.\n\nNintendo is credited with largely resolving this challenge by instituting a\ncomplex licensing scheme that allowed them to enforce quality control,\nensuring only high-quality games saw the light of day. Nintendo made the\ncartridges; it charged high fees to each publisher; and it limited who could\nenter the industry\u2014and how often they could publish. Sure, we still got plenty\nof duds and some shovelware, as the existence of the Angry Video Game Nerd\nmore than highlights, but it largely ensured that our experiences with these\nconsoles were positive. No video game crash with the NES.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that the Nintendo ecosystem was not the only ecosystem\nof its kind during this era. In the 1980s, home computer systems were a\npopular way to play video games, with systems like the Commodore 64, Atari 400\nand 800, and Apple II maintaining interest in homes for years.\n\nAn early Apple employee, Trip Hawkins, saw an opportunity to build games and\nsoftware programs for these machines, and launched the company Electronic Arts\naround the concept. The firm, which has a reputation today of being employed\nby giant teams of anonymous employees working on generic franchises like\nMadden, was ironically built with the goal of bringing the creator-led United\nArtists model to video games.\n\nThis approach, mixed with an aggressive approach to getting its products in\nstores, treated EA well, especially after the company chose to jump early on\nthe Amiga, whose hardware was the strongest of its generation.\n\nThe Electronic Arts Sprobe, the reverse-engieering kit EA built to make\nGenesis games. (via Sega Retro)\n\nEA, with a Silicon Valley pedigree, was a famously cutthroat company in its\nbusiness dealings, something highlighted by the fact that it went out of its\nway to avoid licensing fees. (That\u2019s why EA barely published for the NES,\nfavoring personal computers instead, which didn\u2019t require them to pay\nlicensing fees to anyone.) The most famous example of this came when it\nessentially worked around Sega\u2019s licensing fee structure by reverse-\nengineering the Genesis, revealing what it did to Sega, promising a legal\nbattle if Sega sued, and convincing Sega to offer them a reduced rate in\nexchange for not selling its reverse engineering work to competitors.\n\n(Bubsy-makers Accolade ultimately took on the legal battle that EA\nsidestepped.)\n\nEA had a big advantage during the 16-bit era, thanks to the fact that the\nGenesis was similar architecturally to the Amiga. It was as if Sega had made a\nconsole just for them.\n\nI bring this up to explain how Trip Hawkins had essentially shown his thinking\naround ecosystems through his business dealings before he ever started making\nthe 3DO. Electronic Arts eventually fell into line like the rest of the\nindustry, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he built an open-ecosystem\ncompany in a closed-ecosystem world.\n\nSo, when Hawkins left EA\u2019s leadership in 1991, he essentially tried to launch\na company as a direct response to the business model of Nintendo and Sega.\nEssentially, his bet with that new company, 3DO, was the same one EA tried to\nmake by leaning its development efforts on the Amiga over the NES: Tight\nlicensing controls harm innovation.\n\nThis was a surprisingly edgy stance for the video game industry in the early\n1990s, at a time when memories of the horrible third-party games of the Atari\n2600 were still relatively fresh, and companies like Color Dreams, Tengen, and\nCodemasters had failed to convince the public that unlicensed games had\nsignificant value.\n\nBut the 3DO, launched initially as an offshoot of EA, was going to twist the\nindustry\u2019s arm and create the kind of open ecosystem that was common on the\nPC, but not among video games. It was a bold bet, and one that Hawkins\nessentially bet his career on being right.\n\n### \u201cI was like the father of a rebellious teenager and an infant having open-\nheart surgery. I felt obligated to care for the infant and knew that the teen\nwas going to make it to adult life.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trip Hawkins, explaining in the book Gamers At Work why he decided to let go\nof Electronic Arts, where he chaired the board until 1994, in favor of 3DO,\nwhich was unlikely to succeed without a leader like Hawkins. The effect is\nlikely that EA lost a bit of Hawkins\u2019 artist-friendly DNA on the way to\nindustry dominance.\n\nThe initial model of the 3DO looks like a VCR. That\u2019s probably not an\naccident. (cog_sinister/Flickr)\n\n### Trip Hawkins\u2019 bet with the 3DO: Consoles that work like VCRs\n\nThe purest distillation of what Trip Hawkins was trying to do with 3DO\nappeared in the most niche of niche publications\u2014a newsletter targeted at\ndigital media professionals at the beginning of the 1990s. Published in 1991\nin the newsletter Digital Media, Hawkins\u2019 \"Ten Principles for Establishing the\nMass Market for Interactive Media\" laid out his basic vision for how he felt\nhome entertainment should evolve in the 21st century.\n\nHe pointed to the VCR, a standard that eventually won its format war, as a\ngreat example of this. At the time, he wrote, home computers and video games\nrepresented profits of just $2 billion per year, when home video was making a\nhealthy $14 billion.\n\nBy letting one or two companies dominate and siphon most of the profits, he\nargued, it was limiting the upside for the rest of the ecosystem. In other\nwords, the next system should be built around something that the entire\nindustry can agree with\u2014think the IBM PC, but intentional.\n\n\"Until we have an interactive media system that both meets consumers' needs\nand is an industry standard, that market will fall billions and billions of\ndollars short of its potential,\" he wrote.\n\nI won\u2019t say that every one of his \u201cten principles\u201d were winners (notably, he\nargued that write-once optical drives, a.k.a. CD-Rs, should be made illegal by\nan act of Congress), but he did argue, reasonably, for a spirit for\ncollaboration:\n\n> The interactive media market cannot be built by a single company. The\n> business PC industry has recognized the need to move beyond the current\n> generation of technology, and the opportunity for cooperation that is\n> provided by the currently lax antitrust climate.\n\nThe idea turned out to be the basis upon which he built the foundation of the\n3DO, an interactive platform and game console built as a mutually beneficial\necosystem. If everything worked correctly, the thinking went, everyone could\nprofit from the agreement\u2014the game developers, who would only have to pay a\nsmall amount in royalties while using their own CD-ROM plants; the device\nmanufacturers, who could build consoles to their preferences; and 3DO itself,\nwhich could ensure a high-quality, consistent experience for customers.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nAn early 3DO commercial could coast on its way-better graphics.\n\nThe hardware-agnostic approach to the 3DO was fascinating for its time. 3DO\ngot companies like Panasonic, Goldstar, and Sanyo on board to build for this\nsystem, whose model, if it had a direct historic precedent, was likely the\nMSX. And Creative, best known for the Sound Blaster, even made a 3DO add-on\ncard for PC users who didn\u2019t want an extra console in their living room.\n\nThe problem is, when the 3DO actually hit the market, the model was immature,\nand it showed in the problems that emerged.\n\n### $3\n\nThe amount, per game, that 3DO asked for in its licensing agreement with\npublishers. One estimate puts that total, historically, at 11.5 percent on\naverage, or around $7 for most $60 games, with cartridge-based games even\nhigher. So, the fact that 3DO used less-expensive CD-ROMs, combined with a\nlower licensing fee, meant the games were relatively cheap. The problem was,\nthe consoles themselves were costly, and because 3DO wasn\u2019t making them, it\nrequired the manufacturers to price them high enough that they could actually\nmake a profit\u2014another downside of ignoring the traditional razor-blade model\nNintendo used.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nKirk Cameron, in a rare role as a purely comic actor.\n\n### Five interesting facts about 3DO\n\n  1. The 3DO was region-free (even if the games sometimes weren\u2019t). At a time when there was increased interest in Japanese games on video game consoles (thanks 16-bit RPGs), the 3DO stood out because it chose not to include any system-level locks preventing games from other regions from running. This didn\u2019t necessarily mean that games built for one region were playable in another. As the 3DO Development Repo notes, not all developers made their games work universally, sometimes adding their own de facto region locks.\n  2. It hosted Kirk Cameron\u2019s first post-Growing Pains role. You may associate Cameron with his faith-based acting work these days, but there was a period where he attempted to pick more broadly appealing roles, with a role playing comic relief in the 3DO title The Horde representing one of those attempts.\n  3. It was one of the few consoles to embrace a daisy-chain controller model. Plugging two controllers into the front of the device was apparently too much work for 3DO, which decided to make it so that you could plug in an additional controller into your friend\u2019s controller, an approach also famously used by Firewire. Of course, the obvious problem with this is that if you want to mess up your fellow player, all you need to do is tug.\n  4. 3DO developed its own voluntary ratings system. With the console launching around the time when Joe Lieberman was making a fuss about video game ratings, the company launched its own four-tier video game ratings system: E for everyone, 12 intended for players 12 and under, 17 for games requiring caution for kids 17 and under, and AO for \u201cAdults Only.\u201d The model was said to inspire the ESRB\u2019s own later model.\n  5. There was a planned sequel that almost made it to market. The 3DO was soon usurped by the PlayStation, which meant the company needed to develop a sequel. That sequel, called the M2, would have been the first video game console with a PowerPC chip (two, in fact) had it made it to market, but the console was sold off to Panasonic, with 3DO deciding it had enough of consoles. Panasonic nearly brought the M2 to market, but decided at the last minute that it didn\u2019t want to compete against Nintendo, Sega, and Sony\u2014and instead sold the device in niche markets that had nothing to do with video games. That\u2019s how the YouTube channel Video Game Esoterica got a hold of one in 2022.\n\nI mean, what other game could I mention in this section? (Faseextra/Flickr)\n\n### The game that shows why the 3DO model unfortunately didn\u2019t work\n\nLike it or not, the defining game of the 3DO console, even more than Gex, Wing\nCommander 3, or Star Control II, is Plumbers Don\u2019t Wear Ties. The three former\ngames highlight what the multimedia console was designed to do\u2014bring high\nquality, multimedia PC-like experiences to a home console.\n\nHowever, the objectively bad Plumbers Don\u2019t Wear Ties comes up in\nconversations more than it probably should, for one good reason: It showed the\nweaknesses in the 3DO\u2019s licensing model in plain sight. Here was a game\nclearly designed as a slightly interactive version of a soft-core film, of the\nkind Cinemax infamously aired at 3 a.m. in the mid-1990s, released as a video\ngame, except with even lower production values than that already-suspect\ndescription implies. It was the kind of software that Nintendo\u2019s licensing\nmodel was designed to prevent from seeing the light of day, and here it was,\nall over the 3DO.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nThe Angry Video Game Nerd covered this game more than a decade ago, which\nhelped give it such a cult following that it ended up actually being\nremastered last year. Remastered!\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nBut even the duds offered some telling opportunities for the future of gaming.\nWay of the Warrior, an early attempt at a Mortal Kombat-style game for the\n3DO, won praise for its excellent graphics and audio, but was widely disliked\nfor its controls, earning some notably low scores from Electronic Gaming\nMonthly. But it turned out to be a failure surrounded in success: The company\nthat produced Way of the Warrior, Naughty Dog, won a significant contract from\nUniversal, which was impressed with the game it developed as an independent\nstudio, and followed it up with one of the defining games of the 1990s, Crash\nBandicoot. Over time, Naughty Dog\u2019s games became some of the best in video\ngame history, notably Uncharted and The Last Of Us. While Way of the Warrior\nwas the only game Naughty Dog ever produced for the 3DO, it is arguably the\nmost pivotal one it ever made, because it put them in the pole position to\nhave massive long-term success on the various PlayStation consoles.\n\n(A few years earlier, Naughty Dog also benefited from getting early access to\nEA\u2019s unauthorized development kit for the Genesis\u2014which proves that companies\non the edges eventually become some of our most mainstream players.)\n\nLet me pose a what-if here: What if the 3DO, not the PlayStation, got a game\nlike Crash Bandicoot? Would it have helped the 3DO find a distinct identity in\nthe market it was trying to reach?\n\nLike Atari a decade prior, the 3DO suffered from wildly divergent quality, as\nhighlighted by Plumbers, but more subtly in other ways, too\u2014particularly\nthrough a lack of console-defining standout titles. Caught halfway between\ninteractive games and traditional video game standbys, the console struggled\nwith an identity crisis caused in part by the looser approach to licensing.\n(On the other hand, some have argued that the 3DO, at least in some markets,\ninspired more experimental approaches by indie developers.)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say 3DO didn\u2019t have amazing games\u2014it very much did. But think\nabout the vibes that Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft set for their consoles.\nBecause of its approach, 3DO struggled to generate similar vibes.\n\nThere was no Mario to set the tone on the 3DO\u2014no matter how hard Gex tried.\nAnd that made it easy for competitors to take its place.\n\n### 2003\n\nThe year 3DO shut down after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. (It ended up\nselling off its assets.) Starting in 1997, 3DO attempted to become a AAA-tier\npublisher, much like its one-time partner Electronic Arts, and published two\npopular series\u2014Might & Magic and Army Men. One game it published, the\ngroundbreaking MMORPG Meridian 59, is still online today in open-source form.\n\nThe thing is, looking at the 3DO in retrospect, it becomes clear that, even if\nTrip Hawkins\u2019 model did not hold up in 1993 terms (which it did not), there\nwas something to it.\n\nThe pain point he identified\u2014that the model needs to be fair to both\ndevelopers and manufacturers\u2014is one that comes up frequently, even today.\n\n3DO wasn\u2019t the right solution, but it was a solution. I think the problem with\nthe model, when broken down, is that 3DO was not positioned particularly well\nas a middle man. It didn\u2019t make the hardware, or much of the software. The\napproach could have worked, that said, but it needed to be something closer to\na nonprofit consortium managing a standard, rather than a commercial company\nprofiting from the success or failure of the standard it was trying to build.\nThat 3DO was a company with a stake in the platform\u2019s success ultimately\naffected its motivations and market position. When the interactive television\nmodel the 3DO was built around never showed up, it was kind of hanging on a\nlife raft by itself.\n\nThe 3DO FZ-10, the second-generation console released by Panasonic. (Evan\nAmos/Wikimedia Commons)\n\n3DO wanted its model to be as dominant as HDMI or USB, but was structured to\nbe Microsoft. It was the biggest drag on its own model. Hawkins later admitted\nthat while 3DO was a failure, as he told Morgan Ramsay for Gamers at Work, it\nreflected who he was as an entrepreneur:\n\n> One thing I do know is that it was somewhat inevitable that I would do\n> something like 3DO, because I was trying too hard to push the envelope in\n> those days. I think many of us as younger entrepreneurs are trying to figure\n> out exactly who we are and where our edges are, and you don\u2019t know where the\n> edges really are until you fall off a few times.\n\nLater on, a few companies succeeded with a 3DO-like model, in part because\nthey didn\u2019t have to worry about the hardware part of the equation. (Which is\nbasically me saying \u201c3DO was a decade too early.\u201d) Closest to the 3DO ideal in\nthe modern era is Valve, whose Steam has basically evolved into a PC-centric\nversion of what Trip was trying to build. While Valve has produced its own\nhardware\u2014and with the Steam Deck, has even done so successfully\u2014that was never\nthe goal of the model. The goal of the model was to make it easier for\npublishers to sell games. And Steam had a benefit 3DO never did\u2014internet\naccess.\n\nWhat\u2019s fascinating though is that Trip Hawkins has never really given up his\nstance that the razor-and-blade model Nintendo built around was actually the\nproblem, that Electronic Arts was best positioned to succeed during the\nAmiga\u2019s salad days. Back in 2011, during a GamesBeat Summit panel and nearly\ntwo decades removed from the founding of the company that became 3DO, he\nbasically said the exact thing that he obviously believes based on a cursory\nlook at the career he\u2019s forged for himself over the past 45 years.\n\n\u201cI think we actually had our golden age when game development was using floppy\ndisks, and it was an open, free platform when we could all make games like we\nwanted to make,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cNintendo came along and software licensing\ncame in, and we\u2019ve been in a dark age since then.\u201d\n\nThis was a controversial view, given the number of Nintendo fans who treasure\nthe ground Miyamoto walks on, and received immediate pushback from analysts.\n(Especially because Hawkins claimed, during the same interview, that Farmville\ndeveloper Zynga was an example of a company doing things right.) But in many\nways, it reflects how Trip Hawkins thinks about video games\u2014as something whose\nmodel should be favorable to creators.\n\nFor its time, 3DO\u2019s structure didn\u2019t make sense, but seen as the purest\nexecution of a leader\u2019s vision, it suddenly comes into view.\n\n\\--\n\nFind this one an interesting read?
