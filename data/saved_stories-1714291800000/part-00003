That was wrong. What I meant to say is\nthat he is a pompous idiot whose his head is so far up his own ass that he is\nlegally blind. I wish him the best and hope that someday we can be friends.\"\n\n> I\u2019d like to apologize to Dustin Moskowitz for calling him a \u201cretard\u201d.

The\ncompany's chief executives were found guilty of fraud and conspiracy in 2006.\n\nRelated stories\n\nMoskovitz didn't outline detailed evidence for each of his allegations, but he\ndid share graphs from Tesla that he claims reveal how the automaker is trying\nto show an increase in miles driven with FSD, Tesla's driver-assistance\ntechnology that is critical for the company's path to autonomous driving and\nrobotaxis.\n\nThe tech founder went as far as predicting that people would end up in jail.\n\nNo executives at Tesla have been charged with a crime, and the company has\nnever been found liable for consumer or securities fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has faced lawsuits and probes from federal regulators regarding\nTesla's FSD technology or Autopilot and its vehicle range, but there are no\nlegal challenges related to the automaker misleading people about mileage\nusage with Tesla's driver-assistance feature.\n\nMost lawsuits have come from drivers who alleged that Tesla is misleading\ncustomers about FSD's capabilities. So far, the company has either settled or\nhas been found not liable.\n\nOn Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was\ninvestigating whether Tesla sufficiently addressed issues with the company's\nAutopilot software after its December recall of 2 million vehicles.\n\nTesla is also facing a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBloomberg reported last year that federal regulators are investigating how\nTesla's driver-assistance software was marketed and if Musk had any\ninvolvement in the promotion of the technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrivers also have accused Tesla of inflating its vehicle mile range, bringing\na class-action lawsuit against the company. A judge said in March that\nplaintiffs will have to go through individual arbitrations.\n\nIn the company's 2023 third-quarter earnings report, Tesla disclosed that the\nJustice Department subpoenaed the company for information related to \"vehicle\nrange\" and other matters.\n\nMoskovitz also has long been skeptical of Elon Musk and his ventures.\n\nLast year, the Asana founder suggested that Tesla and SpaceX are overvalued\nand that the companies' leader is given too much credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The point is I don't really see these companies as dispensating impact, or at\nleast don't give nearly as much credit to him as others do,\" Moskovitz said on\nThreads. \"If they were really built on outward lies, rather than just self-\ndeceptions (rose-colored glasses), then we should really see them as scams he\ngot away with.\"\n\nMoskovitz has even called on Musk to resign from his executive role in all his\ncompanies after Musk called an antisemitic post on X the \"actual truth.\"\n\n\"I call on Elon Musk to resign,\" Moskovitz said on Threads last year, adding\nthat he should resign \"(from everything).\"\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch:\n\nTesla\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
