Within about 300,000\nyears, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels doubled, oceans became anoxic, and\nbiodiversity dropped on land and at sea.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the fastest warming events in Earth\u2019s history,\u201d said Isabel\nMonta\u00f1ez, distinguished professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary\nSciences at the University of California, Davis.\n\nAlthough several other \u201chyperthermal,\u201d or rapid warming events, are known in\nEarth\u2019s history, this is the first identified in an icehouse Earth, when the\nplanet had ice caps and glaciers, comparable to the present day. It shows that\nan icehouse climate may be more sensitive to changes in atmospheric carbon\ndioxide than warmer conditions, when CO2 levels are already higher. The work\nis published this week (May 2) in Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences.\n\nMonta\u00f1ez\u2019s lab has studied the period from 300 million to 260 million years\nago, when Earth\u2019s climate went from a glacial icehouse to a hot, ice-free\ngreenhouse. In 2007, they showed that the climate swung back and forth several\ntimes during this period.\n\nMore recently, Monta\u00f1ez\u2019s team and others have been able to home in on a\ntransition 304 million years ago, the Kasimovian\u2013Gzhelian boundary, or KGB.\nThey used multiple proxies, including carbon isotopes and trace elements from\nrocks and plant fossils, and modeling to estimate atmospheric CO2 at the time.\n\nThe researchers estimate that about 9,000 gigatons of carbon were released\ninto the atmosphere just before the KGB.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a rate, but it was one of the fastest in Earth\u2019s history,\u201d\nMonta\u00f1ez said. That doubled atmospheric CO2 from approximately 350 parts per\nmillion, comparable to modern pre-industrial levels, to about 700 ppm.\n\n## Deep ocean dead zones\n\nOne of the consequences of global warming is marine anoxia, or a drop in\ndissolved oxygen in the ocean. Melting ice caps release fresh water onto the\nocean surface, creating a barrier to deep water circulation and cutting off\nthe supply of oxygen. Without oxygen, marine life dies.\n\nLack of oxygen leaves its mark in uranium isotopes incorporated into rocks\nforming at the bottom of the ocean. By measuring uranium isotopes in carbonate\nrocks in present-day China, the researchers could get a proxy for the amount\nof oxygen \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 in the ocean when those rocks were laid down.\n\nAbout 23% of the seafloor worldwide became anoxic dead zones, they estimate.\nThat lines up with other studies showing big losses in biodiversity on land\nand at sea at the same time.\n\nThe effect of carbon release on ocean anoxia was significantly greater than\nthat seen in other studies of rapid warming during \u201cgreenhouse\u201d conditions.\nThat may be because the baseline level of atmospheric CO2 was already much\nhigher.\n\n\u201cIf you raised CO2 by the same amount in a greenhouse world, there isn\u2019t much\neffect, but icehouses seem to be much more sensitive to change and marine\nanoxia,\u201d Monta\u00f1ez said.\n\nThe massive carbon release may have been triggered by volcanic eruptions that\ntore through carboniferous coal beds, Monta\u00f1ez said. The eruptions would also\nhave started fires, and warming may have melted permafrost, leading to the\nrelease of more organic carbon.\n\nMonta\u00f1ez is co-corresponding author on the paper with Jitao Chen, formerly a\npostdoctoral scholar at UC Davis and now at the Nanjing Institute of Geology\nand Palaeontology, China, and Xiang-dong Wang, Nanjing University, China.\nAdditional co-authors are: Shuang Zhang, Texas A&M University; Terry Isson,\nSofia Rauzi and Kierstin Daviau, University of Waikato, New Zealand; Le Yao,\nYu-ping Qi and Yue Wang, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology;\nSophia Macarewich and Christopher Poulsen, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor;\nNoah Planavsky, Yale University; Feifei Zhang, Jun-xuan Fan and Shu-zhong\nShen, Nanjing University; and Ariel Anbar, Arizona State University.\n\nThe work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China,\nthe Chinese Academy of Sciences and the U.S. National Science Foundation.\n\n## Media Resources\n\nRead the paper (PNAS)\n\nMedia Contacts:\n\n  * Isabel Monta\u00f1ez, Earth and Planetary Sciences, ipmontanez@ucdavis.edu\n  * Andy Fell, News and Media Relations, 530-304-8888, ahfell@ucdavis.edu\n\n## Primary Category\n\nScience and Climate\n\n## Secondary Categories\n\nScience & Technology\n\n## Tags\n\nClimate Science Paleoclimate Earth and Planetary Sciences College of Letters\nand Science\n\nUniversity of California, Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616 | 530-752-1011\n\n  * Questions or comments?\n  * Privacy & Accessibility\n  * Principles of Community\n  * University of California\n  * Last update: April 17, 2023\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Regents of the University of California, Davis campus.
