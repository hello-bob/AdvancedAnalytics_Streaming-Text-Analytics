[ what? | play! | DONATE | source code | twitter ]\n\n# multizork\n\n>read leaflet\n\n## What is this?\n\nThis is an experiment in turning Zork 1 into a multiplayer game. Up to four\nplayers can explore the Great Underground Empire at the same time, interacting\nwith the world together or apart.\n\nSometimes this introduces new solutions to puzzles. Sometimes it breaks the\ngame in hilarious ways.\n\n## How do I play?\n\nYou need a telnet client and some friends.\n\nTelnet to multizork.icculus.org, start a game and tell your friends the access\ncode.\n\n## Where do I get a \"telnet client\"?!\n\nFrom a command line prompt, type \"telnet multizork.icculus.org\" ... you might\nalready have one! If not:\n\n  * On Windows: install PuTTY.\n  * On Linux and macOS: just use netcat! Type \"nc multizork.icculus.org 23\"\n\n## Who did this?\n\nMy name is Ryan. I run icculus.org. I help develop SDL. I'm on twitter.\n\n## Can I give you money?\n\nYou can! I build wild things like multizork for my patrons over at Patreon. If\nyou want to support me, please don't be afraid to throw in a few bucks and see\nwhat I do next:\n\nI also sell a game engine called DragonRuby Game Toolkit, which lets you build\n2D games quickly and pleasantly in Ruby. One-time sales and Pro subscriptions\nhelp a lot!\n\nThanks!\n\n## I have more questions!\n\nI wrote a deeply technical blog post about multizork here. But you can just\nhit me up on Twitter if you have more questions!\n\n", "frontpage": true}
