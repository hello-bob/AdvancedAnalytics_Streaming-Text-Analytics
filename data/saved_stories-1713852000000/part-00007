This 3-pendulum rotary type of harmonograph gives a wide\nvariety of pleasant results, and is fairly easy to build once you've settled\non a design and have acquired the appropriate materials and tools. This is a\ngreat project to do with kids and can result in endless experiments creating\nnew types of geometric designs.\n\nSkip to More Results and Movie\n\nTwo lateral pendulums swing back and forth at right angles to each other with\narms connecting to a pen. One moves the pen from side to side, and the second\nmoves it from front to back on the paper. A third \"rotary\" pendulum moves the\npaper by swinging on any axis or in circular motions, while the pen is drawing\non it. The combined motions of all three pendulums generate the resulting\ndrawing.\n\n## Construction\n\nTable\n\nStart by building a sturdy table. This table top is a 3'x3' square of 3/4\"\nthick plywood. The legs are 11\u20442\" x 11\u20442\" square and about 37\" long, with\ntriangular braces cut from 11\u20442\" x 8\"x 12\" wooden pieces. The legs are splayed\nout slightly to give the table strength, and to allow the rotary pendulum to\nswing without hitting a leg. Tip: screw and/or glue the braces to the legs\nfirst, and then cut their tops together at a slight angle with a table or\ncircular saw. Adjust the leg lengths to give a table-top height of about 37\".\n\nNote: if you want to be able to fit the table through doorways without taking\noff the legs, you might need slightly shorter legs and pendulums.\n\nHoles for pendulums\n\nDrill 3 holes of 3\" diameter through the table surface for the pendulums to\nhang through. The hole for the rotary pendulum should be centered in a corner\nabout 8\" from each side just clear of the leg brace underneath. The other two\nholes should be aligned near the opposite edges, about 8\" from the common\nside, and 3\" from the other. You'll need a special large circular drill bit\nfor this. Alternatively you can first drill a smaller hole, and then cut a\nwider opening with a jigsaw.\n\nPlates to support pendulums\n\nMount two metal plates (about 11\u20444\" x 4\") on the sides of the two lateral\npendulum holes, and drill a small indentation in the center of each plate.\nTip: first start the indentation in the metal plate with a small drill bit\n(such as 1/8\") and then continue with a larger bit (such as 1/4\"). Be careful\nnot to drill all the way through. Tip: unless you have a good drill press, it\nmay be easier to position the indentations of the plates on the table after\nyou create the fulcrum blocks with protruding screws below, because it can be\nharder to accurately position the screws in the blocks later to align with the\nindentations.\n\n> An alternate version of the arm-pendulum connection is shown to the right\n> that uses a magnetic ball joint instead of the simple nail method above.\n> Glue one 3/8\" spherical magnet to the end of the arm (making sure the N/S\n> alignment is horizontal by connecting a second magnet). File a hole in the\n> side of a nylon cylinder (1\" height, 1/2\" outer and 3/8\" inner diameter) and\n> use smaller cylinders (3/8\" outer diameter) to hold another magnet inside\n> that can rotate freely. Then glue the cylinder to the top of the pendulum.\n\nExperiment with pens and markers of various types and colors. Generally wide\npens or thin markers seem to work best.

The\nfrequency of a pendulum varies with the inverse of the square root of its\nlength, so to swing twice as fast, the length between the fulcrum and its\ncenter-of-mass would need to be 1/4 of the original length (which may not be\npractical with this harmonograph). For a 3:2 or 4:3 frequency increase, one of\nthe weights would be raised around 19\" or 15\" respectively, although you\nshould probably do some timing tests to find and mark these heights\nexperimentally.\n\nWeight Amount\n\nAdd more weight to a pendulum to counteract friction and make the swinging\nlast longer. I've found that 5 lb (2 x 21\u20442) on the rotary pendulum, and 71\u20442\nlb (3 x 21\u20442) on the other two works fairly well. Note that adding more weight\ndoes not generally change the frequency of the pendulum.\n\nPhase and Amplitude\n\nEach time you swing the pendulums to make a new drawing, the relative phases\nand amplitudes of each pendulum will vary. Try some where the rotary pendulum\nand the lateral pendulums are initially making circles in the same, or in\nopposite directions. Try some where the lateral pendulums are initially\nswinging in phase to make a diagonal line.\n\n## Results\n\nTwo-pendulum results\n\nTo simplify things, you can lock down the rotary pendulum by unclipping that\nweight so it rests on the floor and prevents the paper platform from swinging\nat all. Attach the other weights at their lowest position to start, since a\nslower pen speed tends to give smoother lines. If the two other pendulums\nswing in unison at the same frequency you will get simple patterns of circles,\nellipses, or lines. If their frequencies are slightly different, the pattern\nwill slowly change from circles to lines and back again as it decays, which\nwill give eye-like designs. When the frequencies are very different, you may\nget chaotic looking results. However, if you find a position that is near a\n\"harmonic\" ratio of frequencies such as 3:2 or 4:3 you can get pleasant\nLissajous figures, figure eights, or fish-like shapes.\n\nThree-pendulum near-unison results\n\nThe effect of the 3rd rotary pendulum increases the variety of possible\nresults. Some of the best designs occur when the three pendulums all swing at\nsimilar but slightly different frequencies, with the rotary pendulum swinging\naround in a circular motion. Note that the mass of the paper platform on top\nof the rotary pendulum causes it to swing at a slightly slower frequency when\nall weights are at their lowest position, so you would raise that one slightly\nif you want it to match the frequency of the other two.\n\nThree-pendulum harmonic results\n\nVarious star-shaped designs can be made by raising weights on both the lateral\npendulums, or just the rotary pendulum, to give harmonic frequency ratios. A\n3:2 ratio often results in 5-pointed stars and a 4:3 ratio tends to give\n7-pointed star shapes.\n\nAchieving higher frequency ratios, such as 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 etc. can be difficult\nwith this type of harmonograph, because a quickly swinging pendulum with its\nweights way up tends to slow down too soon. It may be preferable to add some\nweights on top of one or more pendulums above the fulcrum which will decrease\nthe frequency, rather than raising weights to increase frequency.\n\nThe harmonograph in action:\n\nFurther Reading\n\nMake Magazine featured a version of these instructions including some larger\nimages.\n\nHarmonograph: A Visual Guide to the Mathematics of Music by Anthony Ashton\n(Wooden Books) is a great little book with harmonograph examples and\nexplanation including the connection with musical harmonics.\n\nThings to Make, a 1920's book by Archibald Williams has a chapter on several\nharmonographs including the Twin Elliptic Pendulum harmonograph by Goold, and\nanother by Benham, which should be more successful at obtaining higher\nfrequency ratios.\n\nThanks to my sons, Jasper, Arlo, and Felix, for their help building this\nharmonograph and producing some of the results.\n\nBack to other work by Karl Sims\n\n\u00a92009, Karl Sims, All rights reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
