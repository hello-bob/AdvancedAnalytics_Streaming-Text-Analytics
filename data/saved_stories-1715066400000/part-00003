The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the\n> other 90 percent of the development time.^[1]^[2]\n>\n> \u2014 Tom Cargill, Bell Labs\n\nThis adds up to 180%, making a wry allusion to the notoriety of software\ndevelopment projects significantly over-running their schedules (see software\ndevelopment effort estimation). The anecdote expresses both the rough\nallocation of time to easy and hard portions of a programming undertaking, and\nthe cause of the lateness of many projects in their failure to anticipate\ntheir difficult, often unpredictable, complexities. In short, it often takes\nboth more time and more coding than expected to complete a project.\n\nThe rule is attributed to Tom Cargill of Bell Labs, and was made popular by\nJon Bentley's September 1985 \"Programming Pearls\" column in Communications of\nthe ACM, in which it was titled the \"Rule of Credibility\".^[1]\n\nIn some agile software projects, this rule also surfaces when a task is\nportrayed as \"relatively done.\" This indicates a common scenario where planned\nwork is completed but cannot be signed off, pending a single final activity\nwhich may not occur for a substantial amount of time.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Hofstadter's law \u2013 Self-referential adage referring to time estimates\n  * Lindy effect \u2013 Theorized increase of longevity with age\n  * Pareto principle \u2013 Statistical principle about ratio of effects to causes \u2013 the 80/20 rule\n  * Small matter of programming \u2013 Ironic phrase in software development\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Bentley, Jon (1985). \"Programming pearls: Bumper-Sticker Computer Science\".
