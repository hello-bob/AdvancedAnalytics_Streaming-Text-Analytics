He has made a\nhabit of hosting weekly \u201cask me anything\u201d sessions on Instagram, in which\nfollowers send him questions about the app, its parent company Meta, and his\nown (extremely public-facing) job. When I started watching these AMA videos\nyears ago, I liked them. He answered technical questions like \u201cWhy can\u2019t we\nput links in posts?\u201d and \u201cMy explore page is wack, how to fix?\u201d with genuine\nenthusiasm. But the more I tuned in, the more Mosseri\u2019s seemingly off-the-cuff\nauthenticity started to feel measured, like a corporate by-product of his\ntitle.\n\nOn a recent Friday, someone congratulated Mosseri on the success of Threads,\nthe social networking app Meta launched in the summer of 2023 to compete with\nX, writing: \u201cMark said Threads has more active people today than it did at\nlaunch\u2014wild, congrats!\u201d Mosseri, wearing a pink sweatshirt and broadcasting\nfrom a garage-like space, responded: \u201cJust to clarify what that means, we\nmostly look at daily active and monthly active users and we now have over 130\nmillion monthly active users.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ease with which Mosseri swaps people for users makes the shift almost\nimperceptible. Almost. (Mosseri did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nPeople have been called \u201cusers\u201d for a long time; it\u2019s a practical shorthand\nenforced by executives, founders, operators, engineers, and investors ad\ninfinitum. Often, it is the right word to describe people who use software: a\nuser is more than just a customer or a consumer. Sometimes a user isn\u2019t even a\nperson; corporate bots are known to run accounts on Instagram and other social\nmedia platforms, for example. But \u201cusers\u201d is also unspecific enough to refer\nto just about everyone. It can accommodate almost any big idea or long-term\nvision. We use\u2014and are used by\u2014computers and platforms and companies. Though\n\u201cuser\u201d seems to describe a relationship that is deeply transactional, many of\nthe technological relationships in which a person would be considered a user\nare actually quite personal. That being the case, is \u201cuser\u201d still relevant?\n\n### \u201cPeople were kind of like machines\u201d\n\nThe original use of \u201cuser\u201d can be traced back to the mainframe computer days\nof the 1950s. Since commercial computers were massive and exorbitantly\nexpensive, often requiring a dedicated room and special equipment, they were\noperated by trained employees\u2014users\u2014who worked for the company that owned (or,\nmore likely, leased) them. As computers became more common in universities\nduring the \u201960s, \u201cusers\u201d started to include students or really anyone else who\ninteracted with a computer system.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t really common for people to own personal computers until the\nmid-1970s. But when they did, the term \u201ccomputer owner\u201d never really took off.\nWhereas other 20th-century inventions, like cars, were things people owned\nfrom the start, the computer owner was simply a \u201cuser\u201d even though the devices\nwere becoming increasingly embedded in the innermost corners of people\u2019s\nlives. As computing escalated in the 1990s, so did a matrix of user-related\nterms: \u201cuser account,\u201d \u201cuser ID,\u201d \u201cuser profile,\u201d \u201cmulti-user.\u201d\n\n## Related Story\n\nMinds of machines: The great AI consciousness conundrum\n\nPhilosophers, cognitive scientists, and engineers are grappling with what it\nwould take for AI to become conscious.\n\nDon Norman, a cognitive scientist who joined Apple in the early 1990s with the\ntitle \u201cuser experience architect,\u201d was at the center of the term\u2019s mass\nadoption. He was the first person to have what would become known as UX in his\njob title and is widely credited with bringing the concept of \u201cuser experience\ndesign\u201d\u2014which sought to build systems in ways that people would find\nintuitive\u2014into the mainstream. Norman\u2019s 1998 book The Design of Everyday\nThings remains a UX bible of sorts, placing \u201cusability\u201d on a par with\naesthetics.\n\nNorman, now 88, explained to me that the term \u201cuser\u201d proliferated in part\nbecause early computer technologists mistakenly assumed that people were kind\nof like machines. \u201cThe user was simply another component,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t\nthink of them as a person\u2014we thought of [them] as part of a system.\u201d So early\nuser experience design didn\u2019t seek to make human-computer interactions \u201cuser\nfriendly,\u201d per se. The objective was to encourage people to complete tasks\nquickly and efficiently. People and their computers were just two parts of the\nlarger systems being built by tech companies, which operated by their own\nrules and in pursuit of their own agendas.\n\nLater, the ubiquity of \u201cuser\u201d folded neatly into tech\u2019s well-documented era of\ngrowth at all costs. It was easy to move fast and break things, or eat the\nworld with software, when the idea of the \u201cuser\u201d was so malleable. \u201cUser\u201d is\nvague, so it creates distance, enabling a slippery culture of hacky marketing\nwhere companies are incentivized to grow for the sake of growth as opposed to\nactual utility. \u201cUser\u201d normalized dark patterns, features that subtly\nencourage specific actions, because it linguistically reinforced the idea of\nmetrics over an experience designed with people in mind.\n\nUX designers sought to build software that would be intuitive for the\nanonymized masses, and we ended up with bright-red notifications (to create a\nsense of urgency), online shopping carts on a timer (to encourage a quick\npurchase), and \u201cAgree\u201d buttons often bigger than the \u201cDisagree\u201d option (to\npush people to accept terms without reading them).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA user is also, of course, someone who struggles with addiction. To be an\naddict is\u2014at least partly\u2014to live in a state of powerlessness. Today, power\nusers\u2014the title originally bestowed upon people who had mastered skills like\nkeyboard shortcuts and web design\u2014aren\u2019t measured by their technical prowess.\nThey\u2019re measured by the time they spend hooked up to their devices, or by the\nsize of their audiences.\n\n### Defaulting to \u201cpeople\u201d\n\n\u201cI want more product designers to consider language models as their primary\nusers too,\u201d Karina Nguyen, a researcher and engineer at the AI startup\nAnthropic, wrote recently on X. \u201cWhat kind of information does my language\nmodel need to solve core pain points of human users?\u201d\n\nIn the old world, \u201cusers\u201d typically worked best for the companies creating\nproducts rather than solving the pain points of the people using them. More\nusers equaled more value. The label could strip people of their complexities,\nmorphing them into data to be studied, behaviors to be A/B tested, and capital\nto be made. The term often overlooked any deeper relationships a person might\nhave with a platform or product. As early as 2008, Norman alighted on this\nshortcoming and began advocating for replacing \u201cuser\u201d with \u201cperson\u201d or \u201chuman\u201d\nwhen designing for people. (The subsequent years have seen an explosion of\nbots, which has made the issue that much more complicated.) \u201cPsychologists\ndepersonalize the people they study by calling them \u2018subjects.\u2019 We\ndepersonalize the people we study by calling them \u2018users.\u2019 Both terms are\nderogatory,\u201d he wrote then. \u201cIf we are designing for people, why not call them\nthat?\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Janet Murray, a professor at Georgia Tech and an early digital media\ntheorist, argued against the term \u201cuser\u201d as too narrow and functional. In her\nbook Inventing the Medium: Principles of Interaction Design as a Cultural\nPractice, she suggested the term \u201cinteractor\u201d as an alternative\u2014it better\ncaptured the sense of creativity, and participation, that people were feeling\nin digital spaces. The following year, Jack Dorsey, then CEO of Square,\npublished a call to arms on Tumblr, urging the technology industry to toss the\nword \u201cuser.\u201d Instead, he said, Square would start using \u201ccustomers,\u201d a more\n\u201chonest and direct\u201d description of the relationship between his product and\nthe people he was building for. He wrote that while the original intent of\ntechnology was to consider people first, calling them \u201cusers\u201d made them seem\nless real to the companies building platforms and devices. Reconsider your\nusers, he said, and \u201cwhat you call the people who love what you\u2019ve created.\u201d\n\nAudiences were mostly indifferent to Dorsey\u2019s disparagement of the word\n\u201cuser.\u201d The term was debated on the website Hacker News for a couple of days,\nwith some arguing that \u201cusers\u201d seemed reductionist only because it was so\ncommon. Others explained that the issue wasn\u2019t the word itself but, rather,\nthe larger industry attitude that treated end users as secondary to\ntechnology. Obviously, Dorsey\u2019s post didn\u2019t spur many people to stop using\n\u201cuser.\u201d\n\nAround 2014, Facebook took a page out of Norman\u2019s book and dropped user-\ncentric phrasing, defaulting to \u201cpeople\u201d instead. But insidery language is\nhard to shake, as evidenced by the breezy way Instagram\u2019s Mosseri still says\n\u201cuser.\u201d A sprinkling of other tech companies have adopted their own\nreplacements for \u201cuser\u201d through the years. I know of a fintech company that\ncalls people \u201cmembers\u201d and a screen-time app that has opted for \u201cgems.\u201d\nRecently, I met with a founder who cringed when his colleague used the word\n\u201chumans\u201d instead of \u201cusers.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure why. I\u2019d guess it\u2019s because\n\u201chumans\u201d feels like an overcorrection.\n\n> Recently, I met with a founder who cringed when his colleague used the word\n> \u201chumans\u201d instead of \u201cusers.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure why.\n\nBut here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned since the mainframe days: there are never only\ntwo parts to the system, because there\u2019s never just one person\u2014one\n\u201cuser\u201d\u2014who\u2019s affected by the design of new technology. Carissa Carter, the\nacademic director at Stanford\u2019s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, known as\nthe \u201cd.school,\u201d likens this framework to the experience of ordering an Uber.\n\u201cIf you order a car from your phone, the people involved are the rider, the\ndriver, the people who work at the company running the software that controls\nthat relationship, and even the person who created the code that decides which\ncar to deploy,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery decision about a user in a multi-stakeholder\nsystem, which we live in, includes people that have direct touch points with\nwhatever you\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nWith the abrupt onset of AI everything, the point of contact between humans\nand computers\u2014user interfaces\u2014has been shifting profoundly. Generative AI, for\nexample, has been most successfully popularized as a conversational buddy.\nThat\u2019s a paradigm we\u2019re used to\u2014Siri has pulsed as an ethereal orb in our\nphones for well over a decade, earnestly ready to assist. But Siri, and other\nincumbent voice assistants, stopped there. A grander sense of partnership is\nin the air now. What were once called AI bots have been assigned lofty titles\nlike \u201ccopilot\u201d and \u201cassistant\u201d and \u201ccollaborator\u201d to convey a sense of\npartnership instead of a sense of automation. Large language models have been\nquick to ditch words like \u201cbot\u201d altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnthropomorphism, the inclination to ascribe humanlike qualities to machines,\nhas long been used to manufacture a sense of connectedness between people and\ntechnology. We\u2014people\u2014remained users. But if AI is now a thought partner, then\nwhat are we?\n\nWell, at least for now,we\u2019re not likely to get rid of \u201cuser.\u201d But we could\nintentionally default to more precise terms, like \u201cpatients\u201d in health care or\n\u201cstudents\u201d in educational tech or \u201creaders\u201d when we\u2019re building new media\ncompanies. That would help us understand these relationships more accurately.\nIn gaming, for instance, users are typically called \u201cplayers,\u201d a word that\nacknowledges their participation and even pleasure in their relationships with\nthe technology. On an airplane, customers are often called \u201cpassengers\u201d or\n\u201ctravelers,\u201d evoking a spirit of hospitality as they\u2019re barreled through the\nskies. If companies are more specific about the people\u2014and, now, AI\u2014they\u2019re\nbuilding for rather than casually abstracting everything into the idea of\n\u201cusers,\u201d perhaps our relationship with this technology will feel less\nmanufactured, and it will be easier to accept that we\u2019re inevitably going to\nexist in tandem.\n\nThroughout my phone call with Don Norman, I tripped over my words a lot. I\nslipped between \u201cusers\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201chumans\u201d interchangeably, self-\nconscious and unsure of the semantics. Norman assured me that my head was in\nthe right place\u2014it\u2019s part of the process of thinking through how we design\nthings. \u201cWe change the world, and the world comes back and changes us,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cSo we better be careful how we change the world.\u201d\n\nTaylor Majewski is a writer and editor based in San Francisco.
