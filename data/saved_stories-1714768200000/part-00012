If you are newly arrived,\ncheck the outline to get oriented. (You might want to begin at the beginning!)\nIf you run into unfamiliar terms, consult the Glossary.\n\nMaking meta-rationality available opens important avenues for effective\nreasoning and action that may otherwise get missed.\n\nThese possibilities can be overlooked because meta-rationality is invisible\nfrom rationality\u2019s point of view, which is the view of most organizations.\nMeta-rationality doesn\u2019t fit into rationalism, which is the typical self-\nunderstanding of people doing rational work. Rationalism, as theory of\neffective thought and action, does not include a place for meta-rationality.\nIt is not part of the ontology.\n\nMeta-rationality is pervasive. It is always a part of all rational work, even\nif only as implicit default choices of ontologies and methods. When it is\noverlooked, when it is not understood and not engaged deliberately, it is\nunlikely to be done well. It\u2019s usually done mindlessly or lackadaisically,\nrather than by putting adequate thought into it.\n\nSince no one points at meta-rationality as a category and explains its\nimportance, it may not be seen at all. When seen, it is usually viewed as\ninsignificant informal trade-craft, and not worth talking about. From point of\nview of rationalism, only rational activity\u2014Solving Problems\u2014counts.\n\nMaking the meta-rational activity you are already doing visible, to yourself\nat least, allows you to make deliberate choices about how to use rationality.\n\nThis chapter returns to themes introduced at the very beginning of this book,\nand partially developed in \u201cRote rationality and unreflected meta-rational\nchoices\u201d at the end of Part Three. You might like to review those quickly, to\nsee how your understanding of them may have changed since you first read them.\n\nThis chapter addresses points like these:\n\n  * \u201cIf meta-rationality is so great, why have I never heard of it?\u201d\n\n  * \u201cSo how do I learn to do it? I can\u2019t find any books or training courses, and my more experienced coworkers have never heard of it.\u201d\n\n  * \u201cMuch of my actual work is figuring out how to translate concepts between teams in different disciplines, and several times that\u2019s resulted in significantly increased overall productivity. But I get no credit for that; it goes to the people whose productivity I increased, instead.\u201d\n\n  * \u201cI can explain ways we could significantly improve our work processes, but my boss says no: we follow standard industry practices unless there\u2019s some extremely good reason. Also, he says if any changes are going to be made, it has to come from the right level in the management hierarchy, and I\u2019m too junior to even be thinking about it.\u201d\n\n  * \u201cYou have written that institutions, societies, and cultures are falling apart, due to a loss of faith in rationality, and that creating a \u2018bridge\u2019 to meta-rationality may be necessary to avoid civilizational collapse. How can individuals and institutions get started?\u201d\n\nThis chapter has several sections:\n\n  * What it means that meta-rationality is \u201cinvisible,\u201d and what it may be seen as instead\n\n  * Several reasons meta-rationality is typically overlooked\n\n  * How to learn meta-rationality, even though explanations are mainly unavailable now\n\n  * Rational reconstruction: the strategy of disguising meta-rationality as rationality to make it acceptable to rationalists\n\n  * How to get credit for meta-rational work\n\n  * Exercises\n\n##\n\nHow meta-rationality is invisible\n\nMeta-rationality is invisible, and therefore inaccessible, at two levels:\n\n  * The category is not recognized, and there\u2019s no commonly accepted word for it, or for its aspects and operations.\n\n  * Individual situations in which meta-rational activity is helpful, or could be helpful, are overlooked as uninteresting and unimportant.\n\nThese blindnesses are mutually reinforcing. The category is not recognized\nbecause its members are ignored. Instances are not recognized because the ways\nthey are similar\u2014in being meta-rational, or in calling for meta-\nrationality\u2014are missed, for lack of the category.\n\nBecause the category is missing, its forms and aspects and subcategories\u2014the\nwhole ontology of diverse meta-rational activities\u2014are unknown. There are no\ncommonly recognized ways of saying \u201cwe have a nebulous mess here, so we need\nto construct some formal Problems whose Solutions would help manage it,\u201d or\n\u201cwhat sorts of formally correct inferences will go wrong here, and how do we\ninstall stops on reasoning to prevent them.\u201d We do those things sometimes, but\nthe lack of a vocabulary means we do them less often than we should, and less\nwell.\n\nLet\u2019s make this problem concrete, with simplified fictional examples. Suppose\na recently-hired programmer has been assigned to a team that\u2019s starting a\nproject to build a new software system. The newcomer may soon have some\ncomplaints:\n\n> The team spent weeks flailing around incoherently before finally making some\n> decisions and getting down to work. Man, that was a frustrating waste of\n> time!\n\nThat may have been meta-rational work, and critical to the eventual success of\nthe project. The group was reasoning together about how to do the rational\nwork of system construction. If it was frustrating and disorganized and took\nmuch longer than expected, that may have been because they weren\u2019t good at it.\nThey didn\u2019t have the conceptual vocabulary of meta-rationality to describe\nwhat they were doing as they were doing it. They hadn\u2019t developed meta-\nrational competence, because that was never explained to them, and they had\nnever been rewarded for it.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the team had outstanding meta-rational competence,\nthe time they took to do the meta-rational work may have seemed like time-\nwasting confusion, \u201cflailing around incoherently,\u201d to someone who wasn\u2019t\nfamiliar with meta-rationality.\n\n> They spent ages discussing words, and arguing about \u201cwhat a \u2018product\u2019 really\n> is,\u201d and I was rolling my eyes and trying to stop myself from yelling \u201cit\n> doesn\u2019t matter, why are we doing this, let\u2019s start coding! This is supposed\n> to be a software development team, not a late-night college dorm\n> philosophical bull session! A \u2018product\u2019 is just an object in the database.\n> It takes ten lines of code to implement that, let\u2019s write those and move\n> on.\u201d\n\nThe team may actually have been figuring out an adequate ontology for the\nsystem they are going to build. That is the foundation for any well-designed\nsoftware. Getting it as right as possible at the beginning\u2014and revising it\nthrough the development process\u2014is a major determinant of success. Engineering\nthe relationship between a representation (a \u201cproduct\u201d object in a database)\nand reality (a specific actual eggplant in a supermarket) can be difficult,\ncomplex, and critical.\n\n> They argued in circles for a couple weeks about which framework technology\n> to build on. Everyone had strong opinions that their favorite framework was\n> the best. This one was fastest, that one was most stable, another had the\n> best support, someone else\u2019s was written in an exciting new programming\n> language. All true, maybe, but there was no way of deciding which factor was\n> more important. Eventually the team leader just used a random number\n> generator to pick one.\n\nThis was a refusal on the team leader\u2019s part to make a meta-rational\njudgement; presumably due to lack of knowing how to, or even from lacking the\nconcept of \u201cmeta-rational judgement.\u201d In the next chapter, we\u2019ll look\nspecifically at how to construct software system ontology, and how choose a\nsoftware technology framework, as examples of meta-rationality in action.\n\nHaving seen some examples, let\u2019s discuss the problem of invisibility a bit\nmore abstractly now.\n\nMeta-rational activity may be entirely overlooked, in the same way reasonable\nactivity usually is. (See \u201cRoutine is too obvious to notice\u201d in Part Two.)\nThen, for example, you imagine that a technical project is a Problem with a\nseries of sub-Problems that must get Solved in succession. It\u2019s true that is\none aspect of it. But this hides questions like \u201cWhere did this Problem come\nfrom? How does it relate with reality? Why is it worth Solving? How was it\nsubdivided into smaller Problems? Are there better ways of doing that? How do\nwe decide what sorts of methods to use to Solve each one? What will be done\nwith a Solution once we\u2019ve got one?\u201d\n\nAlternatively, instead of being entirely overlooked, specific instances may\nget described accurately at the rational level. For example, \u201cwe spent two\nweeks figuring out what sorts of data objects our inventory software system\nshould keep track of, which was good to get done early in the project\u201d\ndescribes an instance of ontology construction, in rational language. The\nunusual, meta-rational quality of such instances is unlikely to be noticed\n(other than by people who have developed some meta-rational skills).\n\nWhen meta-rational activity is noticed (but not as such), it may be\nmisunderstood as circumrationality (\u201cmere technician-level stuff\u201d); as \u201cpeople\nskills\u201d; or in cases of undeniable spectacular success as \u201ccreative\u201d\n\u201cintuitive\u201d \u201cgenius.\u201d Let\u2019s see how each of those can play out.\n\nIn the previous chapter, we saw that Norman Heatley\u2019s immensely valuable,\nradically innovative work on penicillin was dismissed as technician work, not\nReal Science. (Recall from Part Three that a \u201ctechnician\u201d role means advanced\ncircumrationality, such as using sophisticated measuring equipment\ncompetently. That doesn\u2019t require full competence in rationality.) Real\nScience is the discovery of a universal law, and Heatley didn\u2019t do that. He\ndid invent an important chemical separation method, which is work scientists\ndo and technicians don\u2019t, but methods development didn\u2019t count. (This has\nchanged somewhat in the decades since, as it\u2019s become obvious that most\nscientific progress comes from new methods; but science class still mostly\nteaches the obsolete ideology of law discovery as the essence.) He also\ndesigned and built automated laboratory equipment, which was unheard of in\nacademic biology in Britain at the time. That is also not technician work, and\nshould at least count as engineering instead.\n\nIn technical organizations, meta-rationality is often confused with irrational\npeople-wrangling work. It\u2019s true that meta-rationality often does require\ncommunicating and coordinating with other people, and organizing groups. So\ndoes rationality. And meta-rationality can be important when working solo as\nwell; I\u2019ll give some personal examples in the next chapter. It\u2019s true that\nmeta-rationality is often left to \u201chigh-touch\u201d non-technical workers (managers\nand marketing people) in technical organizations. That is often just due to\nrational workers\u2019 revulsion for anything non-rational. While reluctantly\nadmitting that wrangling irrational people is often necessary, many would\nrather stay as far from it as possible. Unfortunately, this may result in\nleaving meta-rational technical decisions to non-technical people, which\nusually doesn\u2019t work out well.\n\nWhen meta-rationality undeniably produces valuable results, it is usually\nattributed to \u201ccreative intuition\u201d or even \u201cgenius.\u201d These are thought-\nstopping cliches, which function to prevent inquiry into what specifically was\ndone and how and why. The success is regarded as inherently inexplicable,\nbordering on mystical. That\u2019s a way to avoid having to understand the role,\nimportance, and details of a non-rational activity. Failure to understand it\nmakes future breakthroughs less likely.\n\n##\n\nWhy meta-rationality is invisible\n\nIn Part Three, we saw that rational reasoning requires deliberately un-seeing\neverything not theorized by the formal system you are using, to avoid\ndistraction. Competence in rationality comes with making this a reflex habit,\nto minimize the effort needed for un-seeing phenomena and motivations from\nbeyond the system\u2019s scope. Unfortunately, those include meta-rational\nconsiderations that could provide significant guidance for your rational work.\nThey become invisible.\n\nBecause the concept \u201cmeta-rationality\u201d has been missing, there\u2019s no collective\neffort to understand it better. It isn\u2019t discussed, taught, researched, or\ninnovated in as a coherent discipline. It is not part of the STEM curriculum,\nalthough meta-rationality is vital in STEM practice.1 That curriculum teaches\nrationality exclusively, and transmits rationalism as its ideology.\n\nRationalism denies the value of non-rational activities, including both meta-\nrationality and circumrationality. This is counterproductive in training\nfuture scientists and engineers, who on the job must do some of both.\n\nRationalism is fond of dual process theories, which lump everything non-\nrational in a single undifferentiated \u201cother\u201d category. (See \u201cThis is not a\ndual-process theory\u201d in Part Two.) Such theories contrast rationality with\nirrationality, superstition, fantasy, self-deception, emotionality,\naesthetics, unconscious thought, and subjectiveness. All these do have defects\nor limits. If meta-rationality was any of those things, ignoring it when doing\ntechnical work might be wise\u2014but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a different non-rational\ncategory.\n\nMeta-rationality extends reasoning to encompass nebulosity, which rationality\ncan\u2019t cope with. Nebulosity is uncomfortable because it makes complete\ncertainty, understanding, and control impossible. Rationality is comforting\nbecause you can un-see nebulosity and work instead in an imaginary world that\nexcludes it. It\u2019s emotionally difficult to accept that this is illusory, and\nto take meta-rationality\u2019s broader view that accepts and works with\nnebulosity.\n\nOpening up to meta-rationality, and to nebulosity, can be a profound emotional\nshock. Later we\u2019ll discuss a study of promising mid-level executives who were\ngiven training in meta-rationality and a view into the overall operation of\nthe large companies they worked in.\n\n> Despite being experienced managers, what they learned was eye-opening. One\n> explained that \u201cit was like the sun rose for the first time. I saw the\n> bigger picture.\u201d They realized that their prior view was narrow and\n> fractured. \u201cI had only thought of things in the context of my span of\n> control.\u201d\n>\n> Everyone was working on the part of the organization they were familiar\n> with, assuming that another set of people were attending to the larger\n> picture, coordinating the larger system to achieve goals and keeping the\n> organization operating. Except no one was actually looking at how people\u2019s\n> work was connecting across the organization day-to-day.\n>\n> This new perspective on the design and operation of their organization was\n> described by some participants as \u201ca turning point\u201d; \u201can epiphany,\u201d\n> \u201cdepressing and frustrating,\u201d or even \u201cdevastating.\u201d It revealed that there\n> were many opportunities to improve the organization, but also that working\n> within the current design as managers with line responsibilities might be a\n> waste of their efforts.2\n\nThese managers, originally trained in administrative rationality at business\nschool, had assumed that their companies worked overall on a rational,\nsystematic basis\u2014and discovered that they didn\u2019t. Every large company is a\ngiant mess, held together by circumrational \u201cglue people\u201d who compensate with\nreasonableness for the disconnects between the many internal rational systems.\nThe trainees discovered that meta-rationality was lacking, resulting in\nenormous waste of effort. About half left line management to take on meta-\nrational organizational restructuring roles instead. That usually implies\naccepting less highly rewarded jobs; but they thought they could be more\nuseful that way.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting analogy here, originally suggested in \u201cTrouble, repair,\nbreakdown, meaninglessness, and rationality\u201d in Part Two, and which we\u2019ll\nexplore further in \u201cDeveloping meta-rationality\u201d later in Part Four:\n\n> Just as the paralyzed blank stare of reasonableness breaking down resembles\n> the disinterested objectivity of rationality, so too the floundering vertigo\n> of rationality breaking down resembles the groundless open-ended curiosity\n> of meta-rationality.\n\n##\n\nLearning inscrutable sorcery\n\nClassroom instruction can\u2019t teach you to drive, ski, or make breakfast.\nReading books is only a little bit helpful. Rationality is unusual in being\nteachable in the abstract, in the classroom, rather than in the doing of the\nactivity. Meta-rationality is not like that. Currently, meta-rational skill is\nlargely tacit. It is learned through experience and apprenticeship. This is\npartly inevitable; we shouldn\u2019t expect a perfectly definite account of methods\nfor dealing with nebulosity.\n\nHowever, there are disciplines best learned with a combination of explicit and\nimplicit means. Medicine, for example: reading and classroom instruction are\nrequired, but so are hands-on experience and the practical one-on-one\nmentoring you get in a hospital residency. I believe meta-rationality can be\nlike that. Explaining it explicitly ought to help, and that\u2019s what this book\naims to do.\n\nMy explanations are less detailed than I would like, because we simply don\u2019t\nknow all that much about meta-rationality. The topic needs much more empirical\nstudy. A chapter late in this Part sketches a research agenda.\n\nIn the absence of a coherent existing body of knowledge, I\u2019m drawing together\nscattered observations from disparate academic and practical disciplines,\ntogether with collected anecdotes, case studies, and my own experience. My aim\nis to popularize these insights, in order to make them relevant to ordinary\ntechnical practice\u2014rather than abstractly academic, as the few in-depth\nstudies have mainly been.\n\nJust pointing out that meta-rationality is a distinct, valuable, and mostly-\noverlooked activity should be helpful in making it visible, and therefore\naccessible. It will help to draw attention to it, and to devote resources to\ndeveloping it. This is true at all levels: in your personal work and personal\ndevelopment; in organizational development; and society-wide. This book aims\nfor those broader scopes, as much as for being a manual for individuals.\n\nMeta-rationality is valuable in all rational work, but like medicine, it is\nmore craft than science. Crafts are not formally rational, but they rely on\nexplicable reasoning in part. A craft might be \u201cintuitive\u201d and \u201ccreative,\u201d but\nthis is not anti-rational or especially mysterious. We don\u2019t have a scientific\ntheory of what goes on in a theatrical costume designer\u2019s brain, but no one\nthinks it\u2019s alien or magical.\n\nSince classroom instruction and texts have been mainly unavailable so far,\nmeta-rationality is mostly learned through personal experience and through\ninformal apprenticeship.\n\nLearning meta-rationality from experience requires open-ended curiosity. This\nis the sort of curiosity that does not expect to find definite answers; it\nseeks understanding, rather than knowledge in form of true statements. It is\nexperimental and reasoned, but comfortable with nebulosity. It is willing to\nbe confused, and willing to allow confusion to persist. When a phenomenon\nstubbornly refuses to make sense, open-ended curiosity neither jumps to\njudgement, nor rejects it as boring or frightening.\n\nA main mode of learning meta-rationality from experience is reflection-in-\naction.3 That is observing yourself doing rationality, and considering how it\nis working, and how well, and why. It is wondering\u2014with open-ended curiosity,\nand taking into account the context and purposes\u2014how else you might do it. It\nis also observing and being curious about your own practice of meta-\nrationality.\n\nReflection-in-action requires enough cognitive power left over to reflect on\nit while you are doing it. It requires enough mastery of the rationality\ntrance that you can divide your attention between rational problem-solving and\nwatching and thinking about it, without distraction and confusion. Then you\nallow the rationality to flow while maintaining awareness of context and\npurpose as well.\n\nIt is also good to reflect on what you have done, and how it went, after the\nfact. That is usually easier, although you may have forgotten significant\ndetails already.\n\nReflection, whether in action or in retrospect, depends on noticing\nopportunities for meta-rational intervention. That may be in terms of the\nexplicit ontology of meta-rationality: you may notice instances of the\ncategories described in \u201cOpportunities for meta-rational improvement.\u201d Seeing\nan activity as improving a system\u2019s circumrational interface, or as providing\nnew material supports for reasoning, can be helpful. Reflection may also be\ntacit and vague: for example, you get a feeling that something is off, for\nreasons unclear, and it\u2019s time to step back and rethink your rational\napproach.\n\nThe role of a mentor in meta-rational apprenticeship is not to convey the\ntheory\u2014that\u2019s what this book is for\u2014but to encourage and support your learning\nfrom reflection. It\u2019s helpful even just to point and say \u201cpay attention when\nsomething like this happens, it\u2019s significant.\u201d Beyond that, the mentor may\nsay \u201clook here, this is meta-rationality\u201d or \u201cthis is an opportunity to apply\nmeta-rationality\u201d (maybe with \u201cof such-and-such a type\u201d), or suggest how.\n\nAs a fictional example, imagine a graduate student in data science has been\nasked to help a team studying the evolution of ecological predator-prey\nrelationships. They\u2019ve collected a large data set of interactions between\nspecies, and need to make sense of it.\n\nThe student bursts into their advisor\u2019s office with a breakthrough:\n\n> Student: I think I\u2019ve got it! An efficient new algorithm for computing the\n> overall ecological drift factor, without having to consider all pairs of\n> species. It\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s kind of complicated. First, it takes the\n> eigenvalues of the predation matrix. Um, I think that\u2019s going to work. Then\n> we construct a kappa-reduced bipartite clique meta-graph\u2014\n>\n> Advisor: Uh, let me interrupt there for a minute. This sounds very clever,\n> and I think I can see where you\u2019re going with it, and it does seem like it\n> could be made to work. So, what is your purpose in doing this?\n>\n> Student: It\u2019s a way of avoiding dealing with all possible species\n> interactions...\n>\n> Advisor: So, do you think you could get a publication out of this new\n> algorithm?\n>\n> Student: Well, maybe, I guess?

You wouldn\u2019t want to take the\n> time out to write and submit and revise the paper.

But it\u2019s really cool, it avoids\u2014\n>\n> Advisor: It avoids considering the n-squared species interactions. Does that\n> matter?\n>\n> Student: Well, an n-squared algorithm doesn\u2019t scale. They\u2019re no good.\n>\n> Advisor: How many species are there in the data set?\n>\n> Student: A bit over a thousand. I forget the exact number.\n>\n> Advisor: So the total number of interactions?\n>\n> Student: Well, a million and a bit.\n>\n> Advisor: And how long does it take to compute a single interaction?\n>\n> Student: I don\u2019t know?\n>\n> Advisor: Order of magnitude. How many arithmetic operations?\n>\n> Student: Uh... well, a hundred maybe, less than a thousand anyway... so the\n> total number of operations would be about a billion? I guess that would\n> take... maybe a minute? At the absolute worst, a few hours, counting non-\n> arithmetic overhead. So you are going to tell me to just consider all\n> possible interactions, and forget about the new algorithm!\n>\n> Advisor: How long have you spent working on this?\n>\n> Student: You are going to tell me I\u2019ve been wasting my time for the past\n> week\u2014but your approach doesn\u2019t scale.

Which means solving the problem I\u2019ve actually got as\n> quickly as possible...\n>\n> Advisor: Bingo. So, remember what I told you about meta-rationality, and\n> meta-rational maxims.

Upcoming later in Part Four,\nthe chapter \u201cDeveloping meta-rationality\u201d is about that.\n\nShare\n\n##\n\nRational reconstruction\n\nThe section after this one explains how to get credit for meta-rational work.\nOne strategy, introduced here, is rational reconstruction: re-presenting meta-\nrational work as if it were done rationally. To explain that, we need to\nrevisit some history of rationalism. Then we\u2019ll look at some good and bad\nconsequences.\n\nThe term comes from logical positivism.4 Remember that, from Part One? It was\nthe final serious attempt to make rationalism work, back in the first half of\nthe twentieth century.\n\nLogical positivists wanted an explanation for how science works, so we could\nbe sure that everything it discovers is true. Unfortunately, they discovered\nthat scientific discovery simply isn\u2019t explicable in rational terms. They\nfound that what happens during the discovery process appeared to be\n\u201cirrational\u201d\u2014by which they meant non-rational; and meta-rational in my terms.\n\nTo salvage the situation, they distinguished the context of discovery from the\ncontext of justification.5 Their view was that the function of science was to\nproduce true knowledge. They couldn\u2019t say how it did that; what happens in the\ncontext of discovery is mysterious, but (they said) it\u2019s a matter of human\npsychology, which they declared irrelevant. Anyway, the reasoning of actual\npeople is defective, capricious, nebulous, and inaccessible, so they didn\u2019t\nwant to deal with it.\n\nWhat matters, they said, is that science produces truths, however it does.\nWhat remains is to show that this is true: that science does produce truths.\nThis is an epistemological issue, not a psychological one. So what we need is\na formal procedure for verifying that a supposed truth is in fact true (or\ntrue with a numerically specified probability). The work done in the context\nof justification is to provide a proof of correctness, which anyone rational\ncan check.\n\nThat is a rational reconstruction of the discovery. We ignore any extraneous\nor inconvenient details of what actually happened, and explain how the truth\ncould have been discovered rationally. Then anyone can go through the same\nprocess and verify that it works.6\n\nSo, now you can see why I\u2019ve gone through this history: re-presenting your\nmeta-rational work as if it were rational is a way to make it understandable\nto rationalists, and then you can get credit for it. More on that in the next\nsection. But first, having introduced this useful concept, let\u2019s look at some\nmore consequences: both good ones and not-so-good ones.\n\nLogical positivism, although a failure in its own terms, is still more-or-less\nthe mainstream, implicit ideology of science.7 As a result, rational\nreconstruction became the standard for scientific publication. A journal\narticle doesn\u2019t explain what you actually did. It\u2019s especially required to\nleave out all your meta-rational and circumrational work: how you came up with\nyour hypothesis, how you worked out the experimental design, and all the many\nfalse starts, experimental and theoretical breakdowns, and your repairs in\nresponse. That stuff is irrelevant to whether what you say you discovered is\ntrue.8\n\nInstead, a scientific paper explains what, in retrospect, you rationally could\nhave done to get the results that you did get. Then other scientists can\nreplicate your experiment. So long as you did get the results you say you did,\nyour fictionalization of the process isn\u2019t misleading, because everyone\nunderstands that this is how it works.\n\nTruth is important. Insofar as your goal is to discover truths that hold\nindependent of context and purpose, this standard for explanation is valuable.\nHowever, for science, there\u2019s two downsides to ignoring the context of\ndiscovery.\n\nFirst, science actually has to be done by people, who actually do have to do\nthe meta-rational work, and who actually have to learn how to do it. It would\nbe very helpful if science papers explained the meta-rational aspects they are\nrequired to omit. Then you could learn meta-rationality from examples,\nespecially ones relevant to the particular sort of science you want to do. In\nfact, often scientists are most excited about the meta-rational parts of their\nwork, and try to sneak a couple sentences about it into the Discussion section\nof the paper. It officially doesn\u2019t belong there, and usually reviewers tell\nthem to take it out. Instead, this gets transmitted only orally, as folk\nwisdom or trade-craft. That\u2019s inefficient, and excludes anyone who doesn\u2019t\nhave a personal relationship with a meta-rational mentor or colleagues.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s a rationalist fallacy that the only goal of science is to\naccumulate universal true laws of nature. Science also aims at understanding,\nwhich is found in the context of discovery and obscured by rational\nreconstruction. Understanding involves \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201cwhat does it mean\u201d\nissues that rationality deliberately ignores. (The upcoming chapter on meta-\nrational epistemology explains this.) Discovery and justification are\ninterwoven, and can\u2019t be separated without damaging understanding.\n\nAlthough the term \u201crational reconstruction\u201d mostly only gets used when\ndiscussing science, it\u2019s a universal pattern across rational disciplines. The\nmost innovative and exciting rational work almost always has an unusual meta-\nrational component. It\u2019s normal to pass over or explain that away, in part for\nthe benefit of those who aren\u2019t ready to work meta-rationally themselves.\n\nWhen meta-rationality aids rationality in Solving a Problem, the Solution can\nbe understood without reference to the meta-rational work. An exciting Problem\nSolution is one that transfers: many other Problems can be solved the same\nway, by analogy. Then the meta-rational insight that led to the first Solution\nisn\u2019t needed any longer. Ideally, Solving Problems by analogy to the original\none gets reduced, for efficiency, to a routine rational procedure. That\nrequires no thought, just following a series of formal instructions.\n\nThis is good, if there are mechanisms in place to ensure that the mindless\nprocedure only gets applied when the relevant usualness conditions hold. This\nis an example of \u201climiting rational inference,\u201d a topic we\u2019ll look at in\ndetail later in this Part. Otherwise, you crank out Solutions that are\nformally correct, but that don\u2019t relate properly to reality, and cause\ntrouble. That is an example of \u201coblivious rationalization,\u201d discussed in \u201cRote\nrationality and unreflected meta-rational choices\u201d in Part Three.\n\nThe next step, as discussed in \u201cRote rationality,\u201d is degeneration into\nrationality theater: you know the procedure doesn\u2019t work in your context, or\nyou don\u2019t care whether or not it works, but for institutional reasons you have\nto perform it anyway.\n\nIn the next chapter, we\u2019ll look at examples of some important meta-rational\ninsights about software development (\u201cAgile\u201d and \u201cDomain-Driven Design\u201d)\ngetting gradually rationalized into counterproductive rationality theater.\n\n##\n\nGetting credit for meta-rational work\n\nCompetent technical rationality gains significant prestige. Competent meta-\nrationality rarely gets any, despite its rarity and sometimes-extreme value.\nRationalist institutions lump anything that is non-rational as uninteresting\nlow-value low-status work\u2014and almost all institutions run on rationalism.\n\nAs a personal strategy, I recommend mainly avoiding meta-rational work if you\naren\u2019t in a context that recognizes and values it. You may be tempted to do it\nanyway, because you can see that it would make your team, project, or\norganization more effective. However, if it\u2019s not valued you won\u2019t be able to\nget meta-rational insights adopted, and you may get actively punished for\nsuggesting them.\n\nThere are exceptions. If quietly doing some meta-rational work makes you\nbetter at deploying rationality, so you can Solve some difficult Problem, you\nwill get rewarded for the rationality. Here is where rational reconstruction\ncomes in! If you have to justify your work to people who see rational Problem\nSolving as the only worthwhile form of thinking and acting, you have to\npresent your work as if you did it rationally. How far your fiction must\ndiverge from reality, and how feasible it is to do this at all, varies from\ncase to case.\n\nHowever, whatever part of your time was spent on the meta-rational work\nprobably won\u2019t get recognized. (\u201cIt\u2019s great that you Solved the Problem, but\nwhy were you off in space wasting your time all last week?\u201d) Depending on how\nclosely your work is monitored, you may not be able to take the time for meta-\nrationality.\n\nAlso, not all meta-rational improvements can be made legible in rational\nterms. Likewise, if you enhance the effectiveness of other people\u2019s\nrationality, for example by developing a better ontology which they adopt, you\nprobably won\u2019t get any credit for that. It doesn\u2019t count as a Solution to a\nProblem. Your better ontology will get regarded as \u201cobvious common sense\u201d in\nretrospect.\n\nThese rather gloomy recommendations apply only to steadfastly rationalist\nenvironments. Some managers do recognize meta-rationality when they see it,\nand do reward it. I\u2019ve had two bosses who recognized my unusual ability to\nbring multiple, seemingly disparate fields to bear on projects, resulting in\nunexpected, valuable products.\n\nMeta-rationality is often recognized only when done by people who already have\nsenior roles. This is sometimes completely explicit: managers at some level in\nthe hierarchy decide how work is to be done, and worker bees are meant to\nfollow mandated procedures. This makes sense to some extent. Meta-rationality\ndoes require lots of experience, and also requires being in a position where\nyou can get the information needed to see the big picture. The senior person\nisn\u2019t any more rational, and may know less about cutting-edge methods of the\nfield, but may \u201chave a feel for things\u201d that finds shortcuts through\ndifficulties, devises or selects better approaches in some way that can\u2019t be\nexplained, and makes projects run smoothly. However, recent management theory\nemphasizes the value of delegating many decisions about how work is best done\nto the people doing it.\n\nSo, if you wish to develop meta-rational competence, I recommend seeking roles\nand work environments that recognize, allow, or encourage it. Those are only\nmoderately uncommon. Waiting until you have enough formal seniority is one\nstrategy.\n\nAlternatively, you may do well to create your own work environment, by\nbecoming a consultant or entrepreneur. In those roles, it\u2019s much less\nimportant how you get your work product, than that you do.\n\nA chapter in Part Five, about meta-rationality in organizations, discusses\nthese issues further.\n\n##\n\nExercises\n\nDid it occur to you, reading the discussion of meta-rational reflection in\nthis chapter, that many of the exercises in the book so far have been prompts\nfor you to do that? Some have asked you to recall instances of meta-\nrationality from your experience or reading. Others have suggested ways of\nlooking out for opportunities for meta-rationality in your work as you do it\nfrom now on.\n\nIn retrospect, can you remember times when you engaged in meta-rational\nreflection-in-action?\n\nHave there been times when you have noticed opportunities for meta-rational\nimprovements that were overlooked by others? Were you able to help other\npeople see them? How? Or did they continue to dismiss them? How?\n\nOr have there been times when someone you worked with noticed such an\nopportunity that you had overlooked, and then you could see it? Can you\nremember why you missed it?\n\nI described opening up to meta-rationality, and discovering the nebulosity\nthat reveals, as an emotional shock. Does that fit anything in your\nexperience?\n\nHave you had difficulty in getting credit for meta-rational work? Or seen\nothers have trouble with that? What did you, or they, do about that? Did it\nwork?\n\nWould you consider taking a different job in order to get support for\nexercising meta-rationality?\n\n##\n\nI would love to hear what you think!\n\nA main reason for posting drafts here is to get suggestions for improvement\nfrom interested readers.\n\nI would welcome comments at any level of detail: from typos, to improvements\nin sentence, paragraph, and section-level flow, to better explanations, to\noverall structural problems.\n\n  * What is unclear?\n\n  * What is missing?\n\n  * What seems wrong, or dubious?\n\n  * How could I make it more relevant? More practical? More interesting? More fun?\n\n  * Did you try the exercises? How did that go?\n\nLeave a comment\n\n1\n\nThere are some exceptions. Meta-rationality is sometimes taught and researched\nexplicitly, although not by that name, in the statistics curriculum at the\ngraduate level. It is also taught explicitly in business schools, and in some\ngraduate-level social science classes. In many fields, eccentric individual\nprofessors may include it. We\u2019ll look into these examples in Part Five.\n\n2\n\nRuthanne Huising, \u201cCan You Know Too Much About Your Organization?,\u201d Harvard\nBusiness Review, December 04, 2019; \u201cMoving off the Map: How Knowledge of\nOrganizational Operations Empowers and Alienates,\u201d Organization Science, 26\nJun 2019. Quotes lightly edited for concision.\n\n3\n\nI took this term from Donald A. Schon\u2019s The Reflective Practitioner: How\nProfessionals Think In Action. That is the only book-length study of meta-\nrationality that I know of, prior to this one.\n\n4\n\nSpecifically, it was coined by Rudolf Carnap, one of the foremost leaders of\nthe late phase of logical positivism. The phrase has been used by many people\nsince, with slightly different meanings. My usage is not entirely standard,\nbut not far from it.\n\n5\n\nAn excellent short explanation is Minwoo Seo and Hasok Chang\u2019s \u201cContext of\nDiscovery and Context of Justification,\u201d Encyclopedia of Science Education,\n2015. Hans Reichenbach introduced this distinction in the 1930s. Reichenbach\nand Carnap led the \u201clogical empiricism\u201d movement that sought to integrate\nprobability theory into logical positivism, once it became apparent that\ncomplete certainty was never possible in the material world. Current\nprobabilistic rationalism derives largely from their work.\n\n6\n\nReichenbach wrote: \u201cEpistemology does not regard the processes of thinking in\ntheir actual occurrence; this task is entirely left to psychology. What\nepistemology intends is to construct thinking processes in a way in which they\nought to occur if they are to be ranged in a consistent system; or to\nconstruct justifiable sets of operations which can be intercalated between the\nstarting-point and the issue of thought-processes, replacing the real\nintermediate links. Epistemology thus considers a logical substitute rather\nthan real processes.\u201d\n\n7\n\nThis vague, mostly-tacit ideology mashes up logical positivism with Karl\nPopper\u2019s falsificationism. It is incoherent because falsificationism directly\ncontradicts the attempted central principle of the logical positivist theory\nof scientific method, namely theory verification through induction. It remains\nvague and tacit because neither of these approaches can work, and also they\nare incompatible.\n\n8\n\nRecall from Part Two: \u201cRationality is powerful because it is not about\nspecific activities and situations. If a rational analysis is correct, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter who did the work, or how. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they used\npaper and pencil or a spreadsheet; it doesn\u2019t matter if they got it wrong\nthree times first; it doesn\u2019t matter that they were totally stressed out\nbecause they were in the middle of a messy divorce and that\u2019s why they had\ntrouble. Anyone can verify the solution, and the activity that led to it is\nirrelevant.\u201d That was in \u201cReasonableness is meaningful activity\u201d: by contrast,\n\u201cwho\u201d and \u201chow\u201d does matter for reasonableness.\n\n### Subscribe to Meaningness\n\nBy David Chapman \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nEssays on diverse topics; updates on what I am doing elsewhere; and for paying\nsubscribers: fun stories, rants, and previews of serious writing.\n\n7 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n7\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Making meta-rationality available\n\nmeaningness.substack.com\n\n9\n\nShare\n\n9 Comments\n\nWilliam11 hrs agoLiked by David ChapmanSomeday I should tell you the story of\nhow I tried to get Quora to revise how they ranked posts using an explanation\nthat involved metarationality.
