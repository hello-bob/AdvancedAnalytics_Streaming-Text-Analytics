The market\nperformed better than expected, reaching double-digit growth after ten\ndifficult quarters. The surge was primarily fueled by vendors introducing\nrefreshed portfolios and macroeconomic stabilization in emerging market\neconomies. Samsung regained the lead position, shipping 60.0 million units,\nbuoyed by updates to its A-series and early premium offerings. Apple slipped\nto second spot, shipping 48.7 million units, as it experienced a double-digit\ndecline amid headwinds in its core markets. Xiaomi maintained third place with\n40.7 million shipments and a 14% market share. TRANSSION and OPPO rounded out\nthe top five, shipping 28.6 million and 25.0 million units respectively,\nsecuring 10% and 8% market share.\n\n\u201cSamsung\u2019s S24 launch reflects a pivotal moment in its AI and premium\nstrategy, with the potential to reshape the industry,\u201d commented Canalys\nSenior Analyst Sanyam Chaurasia. \u201cCompared to last year\u2019s S23 release, Samsung\nlaunched the Galaxy S24 a month earlier and shipped 13.5 million units, a 35%\nyear-over-year shipment growth vs its predecessor in Q1. The pull factor from\nGalaxy AI, the large scale of retail points elevating the customer experience,\nand a better time-to-market strategy, drove the strong performance of the\nGalaxy S24. Beyond empowering Samsung's premium positioning, it also signals a\nbroader shift in the smartphone industry towards AI-driven innovation. Samsung\nwill look to leverage its early momentum by crafting compelling value\npropositions for users with Galaxy AI; solidifying premium competitiveness and\nfostering brand stickiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cMass-market brands are riding the wave of emerging markets rebounding, while\ncautiously stocking components,\u201d remarked Canalys Analyst Runar Bj\u00f8rhovde.\n\u201cWith improved inventory conditions at the outset of 2024, these brands have\ndriven strong performances with their portfolio refreshes. Vendors such as\nXiaomi and TRANSSION experienced robust year-over-year growth of 33% and 86%\nrespectively, driven by strong shipments of their latest models into the\nMiddle East, Africa, and Latin America markets. Notably, beyond the ongoing\nstabilization in emerging markets, these brands are ramping up production and\nstockpiling raw materials in anticipation of further increases in Bill of\nMaterials (BoM) costs. These brands will closely monitor the demand situation\nand will look to transfer rising costs to consumers, resulting in higher\noverall ASPs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2024, vendors will maintain a cautious stance, focusing on wallet share,\ninventory management, and supply chain optimization. Meanwhile, exploring\navenues to commercialize the generative AI wave remains critical for all\nplayers within the device ecosystem,\u201d said Chaurasia. \u201cThe evolution of on-\ndevice AI solutions for smartphones depends heavily on strategic alliances\namong brands, chipset providers, and software firms. Vendors will look for\nopen collaboration with industry leaders to bring unique and personalized AI\nsolutions to end users. In the long-term, vendors will look to bring these AI\nfeatures to mid-range price bands to add more users to their native AI\necosystems. Additionally, ecosystem expansion via cross-device integration and\nstrategic partnerships boosts revenue potential, highlighting the profound\nimpact of on-device AI on user experiences and brand profitability.\u201d\n\nGlobal smartphone shipments and annual growth Canalys Smartphone Market Pulse:\nQ1 2024  \n---  \nVendor| Q1 2024 shipments (million)| Q1 2024 market share| Q1 2023 shipments\n(million)| Q1 2023 market share| Annual growth  \nSamsung| 60.0| 20%| 60.3| 22%| -1%  \nApple| 48.7| 16%| 58.0| 21%| -16%  \nXiaomi| 40.7| 14%| 30.5| 11%| 33%  \nTRANSSION| 28.6| 10%| 15.4| 6%| 86%  \nOPPO| 25.0| 8%| 26.6| 10%| -6%  \nOthers| 93.3| 31%| 78.9| 29%| 18%  \nTotal| 296.2| 100%| 269.8| 100%| 10%  \nNote: Xiaomi estimates include sub-brand POCO, and OPPO includes OnePlus.\nTRANSSION includes Tecno, Infinix and iTel.
