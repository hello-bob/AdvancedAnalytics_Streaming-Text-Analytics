To attain high accuracy on this test,\n> models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability.\n> We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the\n> very largest GPT-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage\n> points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models\n> still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level\n> accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know\n> when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some\n> socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively\n> evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional\n> understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and\n> to identify important shortcomings.\n\nComments:| ICLR 2021; the test and code is available at this https URL  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2009.03300 [cs.CY]  \n(or arXiv:2009.03300v3 [cs.CY] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2009.03300arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Dan Hendrycks [view email] [v1] Mon, 7 Sep 2020 17:59:25 UTC (2,172 KB)\n[v2] Mon, 21 Sep 2020 05:06:57 UTC (2,402 KB) [v3] Tue, 12 Jan 2021 18:57:11\nUTC (2,578 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Measuring Massive Multitask Language\nUnderstanding, by Dan Hendrycks and 6 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CY\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2020-09\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\n### 3 blog links\n\n(what is this?)\n\n### DBLP - CS Bibliography\n\nlisting | bibtex\n\nDan Hendrycks Collin Burns Steven Basart Mantas Mazeika Dawn Song\n\n...\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
