Nasa to create lunar-centric time reference system\n\nSpace agency tasked with establishing Coordinated Lunar Time, partly to aid\nmissions requiring extreme precision\n\nDiana Ramirez-Simon and agencies\n\nShare\n\nThe White House wants Nasa to figure out how to tell time on the moon.\n\nA memo sent on Tuesday from the head of the US Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy (OSTP) has asked the space agency to work with other US\nagencies and international agencies to establish a moon-centric time reference\nsystem. Nasa has until the end of 2026 to set up what is being called\nCoordinated Lunar Time (LTC).\n\nMetal thought to be International Space Station trash rips through Florida\nhome\n\nRead more\n\nIt\u2019s not quite a time zone like those on Earth, but an entire frame of time\nreference for the moon. Because there\u2019s less gravity on the moon, time there\nmoves a tad more quickly \u2013 58.7 microseconds every day \u2013 compared with on\nEarth. Among other things, LTC would provide a time-keeping benchmark for\nlunar spacecraft and satellites that require extreme precision for their\nmissions.\n\n\u201cAn atomic clock on the moon will tick at a different rate than a clock on\nEarth,\u201d said Kevin Coggins, Nasa\u2019s top communications and navigation official.\n\u201cIt makes sense that when you go to another body, like the moon or Mars, that\neach one gets its own heartbeat.\u201d\n\nNasa has plans to send astronaut missions to the lunar surface beginning in\nSeptember 2026 through its Artemis program, which will also eventually\nestablish a scientific lunar base that could help set the stage for future\nmissions to Mars. Dozens of companies, spacecraft and countries are involved\nin the effort.\n\nWithout a unified lunar time standard, an OSTP official told Reuters, it would\nbe challenging to ensure that data transfers between spacecraft are secure and\nthat communications among Earth, lunar satellites, bases and astronauts are\nsynchronized.\n\nDiscrepancies in time also could lead to errors in mapping and locating\npositions on or orbiting the moon, the official said.\n\n\u201cImagine if the world wasn\u2019t syncing their clocks to the same time, how\ndisruptive that might be and how challenging everyday things become,\u201d the\nofficial said.\n\nClocks and time zones on Earth operate on Universal Coordinated Time (UTC),\nwhich is internationally recognized. It relies on a vast global network of\natomic clocks placed in different locations around the world. They measure\nchanges in the state of atoms and generate an average that ultimately makes up\na precise time.\n\nDeveloping LTC may require atomic clocks to be placed on the moon.\n\nDefining how to implement LTC will require international agreements, the memo\nsaid, through \u201cexisting standards bodies\u201d and among the 36 nations that have\nsigned a pact called the Artemis accords involving how countries act in space\nand on the moon. China and Russia, the two main US rivals in space, have not\nsigned the Artemis accords.\n\nUTC might influence how LTC is implemented, the official said. The UN\u2019s\nInternational Telecommunication Union defines UTC as an international\nstandard.\n\nThe International Space Station, being in low Earth orbit, will continue to\nuse Universal Coordinated Time. But just where the new space time kicks in is\nsomething Nasa has to figure out. Even Earth\u2019s time speeds up and slows down,\nrequiring leap seconds.\n\nUnlike on Earth, the moon will not have daylight saving time, Coggins said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Nasa\n  * The moon\n  * Space\n  * Biden administration\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
