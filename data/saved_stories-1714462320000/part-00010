This language is designed to meet the evolving needs\nof API developers, architects, and managers in an environment where the\ndelivery of consistently high-quality APIs and related experiences is becoming\nincreasingly complex and critical.\n\nTypeSpec is more than just a new language; it's a platform that enables\nabstraction, encourages code reuse, and leverages modern tooling for rapid\ndevelopment. Meeting these needs requires a blend of innovative technology and\nfresh processes that place the API as the fundamental truth on which we build\nour sophisticated abstractions.\n\nTypeSpec describes APIs using any protocol or serialization format with\nconcise, familiar syntax and great editor tooling for Visual Studio and VS\nCode. It can encapsulate common data types, API patterns, and API guidelines\ninto high level, reusable components that can be shared across teams or\necosystems. It can compile to standards compliant OpenAPI, JSON Schema, or\nProtobuf (or even all three at the same time).\n\nWe believe this new technology unlocks new ways for developers to build APIs\nand the applications around them in a more productive and higher quality way\nthan in the past.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Interoperability\n\nTypeSpec is not just another API description language; it's a higher-level\ndefinition language capable of defining your API and then outputting many\ndifferent protocols, clients, servers, documentation and more, even\nsimultaneously. This makes it a versatile tool that can adapt to a variety of\ndevelopment scenarios. Furthermore, TypeSpec is committed to being\ninteroperable with industry standard API definition languages, bridging the\ngap between different choices.\n\n### Productivity\n\nTypeSpec provides a superior developer experience, making the process of\ndefining data and APIs both enjoyable and productive. The language is concise\nand able to define complex data and API shapes with minimal typing. Its\ntooling makes development and maintenance a breeze, surfacing errors and\nguideline violations at development time, long before any human review process\ngets involved.\n\n### API Patterns\n\nTypeSpec improves API quality by encapsulating common data types, API\npatterns, and API guidelines into high-level, reusable components that can be\nshared across teams or ecosystems. This alignment of components with domain\nand business-specific concepts ensures that specs are written in a language\neveryone understands, rather than low-level protocol details.\n\n### Familiarity\n\nInspired by TypeScript and C#, TypeSpec is easy to learn and feels familiar to\nmany developers, reducing the learning curve.\n\n### Extensibility\n\nTypeSpec can be extended with custom decorator vocabularies and type\ntemplates, allowing you to model APIs in your business or application logic\ndomain. Its extensibility allows it to describe many different protocols,\nserialization formats, or domain-specific metadata, serving as a source-of-\ntruth for anything API-related.\n\n### Ecosystem\n\nTypeSpec allows packaging of common types, language extensions, linters, and\nemitters into packages, which can be distributed on NPM within your\norganization or across the ecosystem.\n\n## Community and Collaboration\n\n### Used at Microsoft\n\nAt Microsoft, we believe in the value of using our own products, a practice\noften referred to as \"dogfooding\". This approach allows us to test and\nunderstand our products firsthand. Many Azure services within Microsoft have\nalready adopted TypeSpec, and the number is growing daily. This internal use\nof TypeSpec not only demonstrates its effectiveness but also provides us with\nvaluable feedback for continuous improvement. By using TypeSpec in our own\ndevelopment processes, we ensure its reliability and efficiency for API\ndevelopment. Harnessing the power of TypeSpec, the Microsoft Graph team has\nrevolutionized API development within Microsoft. This collaboration has\nenhanced productivity and simplified customization, underscoring TypeSpec's\npotential.\n\n> \"In the Microsoft Graph team, we've been excited to partner with our\n> colleagues building TypeSpec to create a productive and innovative\n> environment for the engineers creating all the varied and rich APIs\n> accessible through Microsoft Graph. TypeSpec has provided us with an amazing\n> platform to build terse and expressive API descriptions, and customizing the\n> language to match Microsoft Graph's domain has been easy and fun.\"\n\n### Join Us\n\nTypeSpec is more than just a language; it's a community. We believe in the\npower of collaboration, and that's why TypeSpec is open source. We invite\ndevelopers from all backgrounds to join the public beta and experience the\npower of TypeSpec firsthand. Your feedback is invaluable in shaping the future\nof TypeSpec, and we encourage you to share your thoughts, suggestions, and bug\nreports on our community forums.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTypeSpec is a powerful tool that can revolutionize the way you approach API\ndevelopment. By facilitating an \"API First\" approach, it allows you to define\nyour APIs upfront, leading to more efficient development and higher quality\nend products. Its support for a variety of protocols, combined with its\nextensibility and robust ecosystem, make it a versatile tool that can adapt to\na wide range of development scenarios. We encourage you to try out TypeSpec\nand experience its benefits firsthand. Whether you're developing an OpenAPI\nspecification, a JSON RPC interface, or simply looking to improve data\nvalidation and type consistency, TypeSpec has the capabilities to meet your\nneeds. Check out our getting started guide, try out TypeSpec in your own\nprojects or in the TypeSpec Playground, and give us feedback on Github! We're\nsuper excited to work with the community on making TypeSpec awesome as we\nstart our march toward a stable release.\n\n  * Key Features\n\n    * Interoperability\n    * Productivity\n    * API Patterns\n    * Familiarity\n    * Extensibility\n    * Ecosystem\n  * Community and Collaboration\n\n    * Used at Microsoft\n    * Join Us\n  * Conclusion\n\nTypeSpec\n\nFollow us for latest updates, contributions, and more.\n\nDocs\n\n  * Introduction\n  * Language basics\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\u00a9 2024 Microsoft\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms of use\n\nTrademarks\n\n", "frontpage": true}
