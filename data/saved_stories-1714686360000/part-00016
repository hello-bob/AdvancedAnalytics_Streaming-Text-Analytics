Long before the internet, there was the Republic of Letters.\n  * The Republic was a network through which many scientists and philosophers communicated in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n  * Digital analyses of their letters can teach us new things about the Enlightenment \u2014 but the method has its own problems.\n\nFrank Jacobs\n\nShare The Enlightenment had its own internet: The Republic of Letters on\nFacebook\n\nShare The Enlightenment had its own internet: The Republic of Letters on\nTwitter (X)\n\nShare The Enlightenment had its own internet: The Republic of Letters on\nLinkedIn\n\nThere was no internet during the Enlightenment, but something surprisingly\nsimilar did exist in the 17th and 18th centuries. This was the Republic of\nLetters: a virtual, global community of scientists and intellectuals who\nexchanged information using the fastest technology available at the time \u2014 the\npostal service.\n\n## 15,000 letters\n\nThe clue is in the name: letters tied this self-proclaimed, transnational\nsociety together. Lots of letters. What this \u201cmetaphysical republic\u201d lacked in\nspeed, it made up for in volume. Take Leibniz and Voltaire, for example. In\ntheir lifetimes, these great minds wrote close to 15,000 letters each, sending\nthem to hundreds of correspondents across all of Europe.\n\nIgnatius Loyola managed only 9,000 letters, but the founder of the Jesuit\norder cast his intellectual net much wider. While Leibniz and Voltaire largely\nlimited their correspondence to Europe, Loyola had pen pals from Mexico to\nMacau, thanks to a global network of Catholic missionaries and other like-\nminded co-religionists.\n\nVoltaire penning one of his 15,000 letters, wearing what must be his writing\ncap. (Credit: Art Images via Getty Images)\n\nThis network linking thousands of scientific and philosophical letter writers\nhad a universal protocol: Experiment \u2014 not authority \u2014 should be the basis for\nfactual knowledge. The network not only spread this ideal but also its fruits:\nBiological, geological, and astronomical observations from all around the\nworld made their way back to the studies of Europe\u2019s most learned men (and the\noccasional woman), and eventually into their pamphlets and books.\n\nOf course, all that is now past. Not the experimental method \u2014 at least, not\nyet \u2014 but the hand-written letter is as good as dead, killed by almost two\ncenturies of innovations in communication, from social media all the way back\nto the telegraph.\n\n## Sifting through the remains\n\nAs one door closes, another opens. Our digital paradigm offers fresh methods\nof sifting through the remains of the Republic of Letters. With increasing\namounts of centuries-old sources digitized, it becomes easier to do\nquantitative analyses, and to \u201cscrape, mine, curate, analyze, and visualize\ndata.\u201d\n\nThat quote is from an article in the AHR Forum about Mapping the Republic of\nLetters, a collaborative project based at Stanford University that builds case\nstudies based on the metadata of the Republic\u2019s letters. Among the project\u2019s\nvarious results are some fascinating maps, some with new insights into the\ndevelopment of the intellectual climate in Enlightenment Europe and beyond.\n\nThere was not one Republic of Letters, but many smaller intellectual fiefdoms\nhiding within the larger whole. (Credit: Mapping the Republic of\nLetters/Stanford University)\n\nMany of those insights provide a more nuanced picture of the Republic of\nLetters than we had before. For example, the graph above shows that the\nRepublic of Letters could be better described as a collection of small\nintellectual fiefdoms rather than as one large whole.\n\nThe graph maps the correspondence network of the English philosopher John\nLocke. It shows just how disconnected the various social and national\nsubgroups in his network were from each other.\n\n## A multitude of communities\n\nRather than everyone writing to everyone, this visual representation clearly\nshows that several letter writers were the center of their own little\nepistolary universe, sending and receiving most of their letters to and from a\nsmall part of Locke\u2019s total group of correspondents. (Awnsham Churchill,\nRobert Boyle, Philippus van Limborch \u2014 we\u2019re looking at you!)\n\nBy demonstrating that there was \u201ca multitude of communities within, or rather\nunderneath, the surface of the Republic of Letters,\u201d this graph offers a\nvaluable corrective to the history of information. Rather than a network, the\nRepublic of Letters was more like a patchwork.\n\nWhile Enlightenment thinkers liked to style themselves \u201cmen of the world,\u201d a\nmeta analysis of their correspondence also calls into question the global\nnature of the Republic of Letters. Case in point: Benjamin Franklin, arguably\nthe most famous North American of the 18th century, and certainly among the\nmost traveled and best connected.\n\nMost of the letters sent and received by Ben Franklin, the most famous North\nAmerican of the 18th century, revolved on the London-Philadelphia axis.\n(Credit: Mapping the Republic of Letters/Stanford University)\n\nYet, despite having spent nearly 20 years in London and traveling on the\ncontinent, \u201cFranklin\u2019s correspondents were overwhelmingly found at either end\nof the London-Philadelphia axis,\u201d as this graph demonstrates. Some small\nforays aside, Franklin\u2019s correspondence doesn\u2019t venture deep into the\ncontinent. To be fair, though, the map also clearly shows that Paris was as\nimportant a destination for Franklin\u2019s letters as London.\n\n## From massive popularity to relative obscurity\n\nIt is somewhat ironic that Voltaire, who has been called \u201cthe most alive of\ndead white males,\u201d is remembered these days mainly for a quote misattributed\nto him. No, he did not say, \u201cI disapprove of what you say, but I will defend\nto the death your right to say it\u201d (not even in French). The phrase is from a\nVoltaire biography published in 1906 and was meant to be a summary of his\nattitude, not a direct quote.\n\nThis map highlights the places where Voltaire\u2019s works were published between\n1712 and 1800, illustrating his significant popularity during that time, in\nstark contrast to his relative obscurity today. The total number of\npublications of Voltaire\u2019s work stands at 1,973, of which 1,370 mention a\nplace of publication. Most of those locations are accurate, but for whatever\nreason \u2014 perhaps to evade censorship \u2014 162 are false...and 10 are made-up\n\u201cfantasy places.\u201d\n\nThis map shows the \u2018true\u2019 places of publication for Voltaire\u2019s work. The main\nones are Paris (333), Amsterdam (169), and Geneva (157), with London (130) not\nfar behind. But Voltaire was popular across the whole of Europe, and was\nprinted as far away as Lisbon (9 publications), Istanbul (5) and Stockholm\n(4). (Credit: Mapping the Republic of Letters/Stanford University)\n\nAbove is another Voltaire-inspired map, this time showing the locations of his\ncorrespondents. Paris and Geneva \u2014 and to a lesser extent, Berlin, Brussels,\nand Amsterdam \u2014 feature heavily. What\u2019s striking is the near-total absence of\naddresses in Britain. It\u2019s even more striking when you consider the canonical\nstory of the spread of Enlightenment ideas: from England via Voltaire to the\nContinent.\n\n## Page not found\n\nAs this map shows, the absence of correspondence to and from England points to\na different story. The mapmakers suggest that Voltaire\u2019s fascination was not\nwith the England of his day but with the reign of Charles II, who had close\nties to the court of Louis XIV at Versailles.\n\nIn the Republic of Voltaire\u2019s Letters, London is just an insignificant country\ntown. ((Credit: Mapping the Republic of Letters/Stanford University)\n\nStanford\u2019s project offers tantalizing summaries of other interesting maps and\nvisualizations from the Republic of Letters, but the project\u2019s web page has\nthe distinct look and feel of something that was last updated 10 years ago.\nClick on something and you\u2019re likely to see \u201cpage not found,\u201d or \u201cAdobe Flash\nplayer is no longer supported.\u201d Leibniz never had this problem. Perhaps\nthere\u2019s another lesson here for the meta-Enlightenment.\n\nFor more on this, check out the full article about Historical Research in a\nDigital Age: Reflections from the Mapping the Republic of Letters Project, in\nthe American Historical Review.\n\nSubscribe for counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to\nyour inbox every Thursday\n\nFor the Mapping the Republic of Letters Project itself, what\u2019s left of it,\ncheck its page at Stanford University.\n\nStrange Maps #12xx\n\nGot a strange map?
