After\nthey posted about their plans on Instagram, other parents wanted in. Now their\ngroup, Smartphone-Free Childhood, has more than 60,000 followers debating how\nto keep their children away from the demon devices\u2014a debate they are naturally\nconducting on smartphones of their own.\n\nThis group, based in Britain, is not the only one worried about children\u2019s\nscreen time. Last month the state of Florida passed a law banning social media\nfor under-14s. Britain\u2019s government is reportedly considering a ban on mobile-\nphone sales to under-16s. The concerns are summed up by a recent book by\nJonathan Haidt, \u201cThe Anxious Generation\u201d, which argues that smartphones, and\nespecially the social networks accessed through them, are causing a malign\n\u201crewiring of childhood\u201d.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get unlimited access for free\n\n### Explore all our independent journalism with a one-month free trial.
