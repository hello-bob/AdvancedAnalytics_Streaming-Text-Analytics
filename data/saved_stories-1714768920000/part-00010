ManraiMay 3, 2024\n\nReprints\n\nAdobe\n\nMillions of Americans rely on the internet to answer questions about their own\nhealth. The public release of powerful artificial intelligence models like\nChatGPT has only accelerated these trends.\n\nIn a large survey, more than half of American adults reported putting their\nown health information into a large language model (LLM). And there\u2019s reason\nto believe these models might bring real value to these people, such as the\ncase of a mother who, after seeing 17 physicians and receiving no diagnosis\nfor her son with chronic pain, put MRI reports and additional history into\nChatGPT. It returned a diagnosis of tethered cord syndrome, which was later\nconfirmed \u2014 and operated on \u2014 by a neurosurgeon.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis story is not unique. Missed or delayed diagnoses harm patients every day.\nEach year, an estimated 795,000 Americans die or become permanently disabled\nfrom misdiagnoses. And these misdiagnoses are not exclusively rare \u201czebras\u201d\nlike tethered cord syndrome. Just 15 or so diseases, many of them common, like\nheart disease and breast cancer, account for half of serious harms. The sicker\nan individual, the higher the stakes \u2014 and the more common these errors\nbecome. In a recent study of people admitted to the hospital who were then\ntransferred to an intensive care unit because their conditions got worse, 23%\nhad a diagnostic error affecting their case; 17% of those errors caused severe\nharm or death.\n\nWhile numerous factors \u2014 many of them outside the control of physicians \u2014 are\nat play in diagnostic errors, human cognition plays a major role. These\nproblems have long been realized by the medical community \u2014 the Institute of\nMedicine released its landmark report \u201cTo Err is Human,\u201d in 1999, with\ncomprehensive recommendations to tackle diagnostic errors. But 25 years later,\ndiagnostic errors remain stubbornly persistent.\n\n## Related: 6 tactics to make artificial intelligence work on the frontlines\n\nWhile many people might imagine that a physician approaches a diagnosis much\nlike Sherlock Holmes \u2014 or Dr. House \u2014 diligently collecting facts to compare\nagainst her or his encyclopedic knowledge of the disease, the reality is far\nmore prosaic. Decades of psychological study, influenced by the pioneering\nwork of Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky, have shown that diagnosis is subject\nto the same predictable biases and heuristics as other domains of knowledge.\nFor example, emergency room doctors were less likely to test for a pulmonary\nembolism (a blood clot in the lungs) when the triage information mentioned\nheart failure, even when objective data and documented symptoms suggested a\npulmonary embolism. This suggested that the physicians got stuck on the first\ninformation given to them, a problem called anchoring bias.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDoctors do a poor job of estimating the likelihood that patients have diseases\nand how testing changes those probabilities \u2014 and are readily outperformed by\ngeneral-purpose language models. Decades of research have similarly shown the\nwidespread involvement of other cognitive biases such as availability bias,\nconfirmation bias, and premature closure in the diagnostic process.\n\nSince ChatGPT was released to the public in late 2022, there have been\nhundreds of demonstrations of the diagnostic reasoning capabilities of\ngeneral-purpose large language models and other AI models on a broad array of\ngeneral diagnostic tasks, some of which we performed with various\ncollaborators. We believe there is compelling evidence that AI, safely\nintegrated into the clinical workflow, could be helpful today to address some\nof the limitations of human cognition for medical diagnosis. In particular, AI\ncould be made available as a \u201csecond opinion\u201d service in the hospital to\nassist physicians and other medical professionals with challenging medical\ncases and also to check for blind spots in diagnostic reasoning. Second\nopinion services with human physicians \u2014 admittedly on a much smaller scale \u2014\nhave already shown that they can provide real value to patients.\n\n## What would this look like in practice?\n\nBuilding a second opinion system powered by a large language model is no\nlonger in the realm of science fiction. As a physician treating patients\n(A.R.) and a medical AI researcher (A.M.), we envision a system that allows a\ntreating physician, using the electronic medical record, to place an \u201corder.\u201d\nBut instead of selecting a diagnostic test, the physician would summarize the\nclinical question about a patient the same way they would talk to a colleague.\nAfter submitting the order, the question, along with the entire chart, would\ngo to a secure computing environment where an LLM would process and provide a\nrecommendation of possible diagnoses, blind spots, and therapeutic options.\n\n## Related: Doctor vs. ChatGPT showed promise and blind spots of generative AI\n\nJust as in the opening case, where the diagnosis of tethered cord syndrome was\nconfirmed by a neurosurgeon, recommendations emerging from the model would be\nfirst reviewed by a physician who serves as a human in the loop to prevent\nobvious errors and hallucinations (where an AI model often confidently states\nfactual inaccuracies). After this review, the second opinion would be sent\nback to the requesting doctor to be placed in the medical record and\nconsidered by the ordering physician.\n\nSimilar to human second opinions, it is not essential that the requesting\nphysician follow the recommendations emerging from the LLM. But the mere\nprocess of considering other options can help reduce diagnostic errors. And\nunlike human second opinion services, the costs of running the model can be\nmeasured in cents, and the model can serve scores of clinicians and their\npatients in parallel.\n\nTo be sure, there are obvious risks that would need to be mitigated in early\nstudies with close human involvement. LLMs contain the ethnic, racial, and\ngender biases of the data they were trained on, which could influence second\nopinions in unpredictable and harmful ways. LLMs are also capable of\nhallucinating; while humans also make errors, AI hallucinations may be more\negregious and may be more likely to cause harm. Having a human expert in the\nloop would be absolutely essential, especially in early studies.\n\nHowever, the stakes of continuing the current rate of diagnostic errors are so\nhigh, and other attempts to reduce errors have failed to make any meaningful\ndent, that we feel now is the time to start studying these technologies. To\nriff off the old saying, to err is human, so AI must opine.\n\nAdam Rodman is a practicing internist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical\nCenter and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
