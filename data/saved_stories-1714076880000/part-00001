The purpose of this\ncollaboration is to combine unique advantages of different teams to obtain\ncomprehensive situational awareness and actionable information to effectively\ndefend constituencies in each Member State, from critical infrastructure\noperators targeted by state-sponsored actors to individual citizens affected\nby cybercrime. The main part of the Action addresses gaps in the Cyber Threat\nIntelligence (CTI) tooling that is currently used by the national level CSIRTs\nin Europe. By strengthening individual tools and interconnecting them, the\nbeneficiaries will achieve a new level of common situational awareness and\nthey will benefit from shared knowledge and tooling.\n\n  * \u2190 Older\n\nAIL Project 2024 | Mastodon Mastodon\n\n", "frontpage": false}
