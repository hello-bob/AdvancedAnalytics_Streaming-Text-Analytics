Phillip Talbert said in a statement.\nAll 12 were arrested at their homes Thursday morning and will be arraigned in\ncourt at a later date, a spokesperson said. They face up to five years in\nprison if convicted.\n\nCalifornia requires most cars to pass a smog emissions inspection every two\nyears. But for as long as California has had those rules, which were\ninstituted decades ago, there have been car owners who despaired that their\ncars wouldn\u2019t pass the tests, and unscrupulous smog check operations willing\nto help them cheat.\n\nIn the old days, cheating at a smog test was easy: A smog operation (there are\napproximately 7,000 in California) would just sign off. To combat that,\nCalifornia made it harder to defraud, by developing software that prevented\nsuch trickery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting about a decade ago, officials allege, a sophisticated criminal ring\ndeveloped and marketed a machine that tricked the state\u2019s software to \u201cpass\nvehicles that would otherwise fail California\u2019s smog inspections.\u201d\n\nClimate & Environment\n\n### EPA issues new clean air rules for heavy-duty trucks. California\u2019s rules\nare tougher\n\nThe federal regulations don\u2019t mandate electric trucks or school buses, unlike\nCalifornia\u2019s tougher standards. But the EPA\u2019s rules will curtail a billion\ntons of greenhouse gas emissions each year.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe conspiracy went on for a decade, the indictment alleges, starting in 2015,\nwhen a smog shop operator in Hawthorne, Hossam \u201cSam\u201d Hemdan, began selling a\nline of devices known as \u201cOBDNators\u201d which enabled failing cars to pass smog\ntests.\n\nHemdan, who owns several smog repair stores around Southern California, could\nnot be reached for comment, nor could his representatives.\n\nThe indictment said that as early as 2013, Hemdan hired programmers and\ndesigners to help him develop the device. He allegedly sold an early version\nto a smog shop operator in Anaheim in December of 2015 for $9,500.\n\nBy 2019, the indictment said, Hemdan had developed a \u201cstand alone\u201d device, by\nwhich a car owner could pass a \u201csmog check\u201d with their vehicle identification\nnumber alone \u2014 they didn\u2019t even have to take their car down to the smog check\nstation.\n\nThat device, the indictment said, cost around $18,000. (A fake passing grade\non a smog test from one of the devices, meanwhile, could be had on the black\nmarket for between $120 and $300, according to the indictment; a real smog\ncheck is usually about $50.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe devices were apparently popular among some smog shop operators. Hemdan was\nallegedly organizing in-person classes so new owners of the devices could\nlearn to operate them. \u201cMake sure everyone come to the class monday mostly\nabout the new n8tr and running the new software and operation other wise u\nwill miss a lot,\u201d Hemdan texted to a group of smog check operators in July of\n2019, according to the indictment.\n\nClimate & Environment\n\n### Los Angeles smog woes worsen as U.S. EPA threatens to reject local\npollution plan\n\nThe U.S. EPA is planning to reject Southern California\u2019s plan to reduce smog,\nwhich called for the federal government to take more action.\n\nFeb. 4, 2024\n\nBy 2020, the network appeared to have cornered the market on cheating smog\ntests, according to the indictment, which said that \u201cvirtually all\nsophisticated simulator devices\u201d found by investigators during the inspection\nof smog stations were from Hemdan\u2019s product line.\n\nOfficials have said they have no way of knowing how many pollution-spewing\ncars are operating on California roads as a result of the ring. But some signs\nsuggest the number is not insignificant. In 2023, only 7% of the 10.7 million\ncars that went to smog check stations failed their tests. But random roadside\ntests carried out by the Bureau of Automotive Repair posted a failure rate of\n13.5%.\n\n\u201cThe scheme here was organized and deliberately designed to deceive and\nfalsify emissions testing across California,\u201d EPA Criminal Investigation\nDivision Special Agent in Charge Kimberly Bahney said in a statement, adding:\n\u201cVehicle emissions testing is fundamental to protect air quality.\u201d\n\nThe indictment does not reveal how investigators cracked the alleged fraud\nring, but it does reveal that they obtained encrypted group text messages and\nwatched the alleged conspirators try to evade detection.\n\nClimate & Environment\n\n### Sensor network shows EVs are reducing CO2 emissions in the Bay Area. Is it\nenough?\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, the Bay Area\u2019s carbon emissions fell by 1.8% each year,\nwhich Berkeley researchers attribute to drivers switching to electric\nvehicles.\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\nOn Jan. 16, 2020, for example, one of the group sent a text message to a group\nchat with 35 people in it, warning that law enforcement was rumored to be\nconducting inspections at smog shops in the Inland Empire that day, according\nto the affidavit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn hour and a half later, Javier Salguero, who owned and controlled several\nsmog shops including one in Bell and two in Maywood, wrote in the group chat\nthat law enforcement was at one of his shops with a search warrant. \u201cCops, fbi\nat my shop,\u201d he allegedly texted. \u201cWatch yourselves.\u201d\n\nA few months earlier, he had chatted in a group text about needing to work\ntogether to avoid getting caught, and said they should consider pooling\nresources to put an attorney and a consultant on payroll. \u201cOrganized crime is\nthe only way,\u201d he joked.\n\nNeither Salguero nor his representatives could be reached for comment.\n\nNathaniel Le, the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Sacramento\nField Office, said that the arrests were a result of a five-year investigation\nby the FBI, the U.S. EPA, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office and the California Bureau\nof Automotive Repair.\n\nIn a statement, he pointed out how sophisticated the smog-check-cheating\ndevice was. \u201cBecause of these devices and the falsified data they provide,\nmany cars that could not pass emissions testing are still on the streets of\nCalifornia.\u201d\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### Letters to the Editor: Smog probably gave me cancer.
