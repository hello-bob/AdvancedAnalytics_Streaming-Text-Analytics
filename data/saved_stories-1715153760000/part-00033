This methodological adaptation allows artists\nto employ readily available home appliances for glass creation, significantly\nreducing the process\u2019s cost and complexity. Our experimental investigations\nreveal that, by using a 500W household microwave oven for heating, the silicon\ncarbide (SiC) in microwave kilns can efficiently absorb microwave energy,\nallowing the kilns to reach temperatures exceeding 700 \u00b0C, a critical\nthreshold for casting glass softening. We further demonstrate that by\nadjusting the number of heating cycles, producing high-quality, three-\ndimensional(3D) glass artworks is feasible, even for large-scale projects. In\naddition, the microwave kiln can be used as an effective cooling tool to\nuniformly cool the formed casting glass. This study presents a possible\nalternative to conventional kiln technology and marks a paradigm shift in\nglassmaking, offering a more accessible and sustainable avenue for artists and\npractitioners.\n\nKeywords:\n\n3D glass artwork; microwave kiln; lost-wax glass casting; high-temperature\nkilns; casting materials\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nGlass crafts played a pivotal role in the traditional crafts of ancient Egypt.\nIt not only laid the groundwork for contemporary glass crafts but also led to\nthe development of numerous glassmaking techniques. Initially, the focus of\nglassmaking was on creating jewelry and intricate decorative items. As time\nprogressed, however, the scope of glass craft broadened to include the\nmanufacture of practical glassware [1]. It was not until the Middle Ages that\nglass began to be widely used in architecture, with stained glass windows\nbeing the most common in churches throughout Europe [2]. In ancient times,\nglass was not commonly used as a material for sculptures. During the\nglassmaking process, even skilled artisans encountered challenges in making\nglass under extreme temperatures, whether high or low [3]. At that time,\nsilicate glass was mainly composed of sand, and it could be shaped into\nvarious glass artworks through techniques like blowing, casting, and flame\nworking [4]. The creation of these glass artworks is primarily inspired by\nnature, biological and human structures, geometric shapes, and abstract forms,\nthereby infusing new artistic styles into glass crafting [5]. However, after\ncenturies of evolution and advancements in technology and science, glass has\nemerged as a common material for sculpture [6]. By the 20th century,\nglassmaking techniques had advanced to a level that allowed for practice in\nindividual studios. Rather than adopting factory-style mass production, these\nartists prioritized experimental approaches to glass art [7]. These artists\nare not only knowledgeable in the science of glass but are also skilled in the\nuse of hot and cold glass processing techniques to realize their glass\ncreations [5]. The field of glassmaking has seen a notable shift in recent\nyears, with an increasing number of artists exploring the use of microwave\nkilns for creating small-scale glass and ceramic artworks. A microwave kiln, a\ncompact, refractory material-based tool, is designed to fit within a household\nmicrowave oven and uses microwave radiation to rapidly heat and melt glass.\nThis technology, primarily employed for melting small glass objects or glass\npieces into functional items and jewelry, offers artists a means to pursue\nglassmaking with considerations for safety, material conservation, and energy\nefficiency [8,9].\n\nAlthough suitable for small-scale production, microwave kilns have\ntraditionally been used primarily for melting flat glass and jewelry making,\nwith few studies confirming their utility in the manufacture of 3D glass\nartwork. In contrast, lost-wax glass casting is a method known for its\ncomplexity and interdisciplinary nature spanning art, science, and materials\nengineering. This method surpasses the design constraints associated with flat\nglass, facilitating the creation of more diverse 3D glass artworks. The lost-\nwax glass casting process involves initially crafting a wax model that is\nsubsequently transformed into a refractory plaster mold. Following dewaxing to\nachieve a hollow mold, casting glass is poured in. The final step entails\nfiring the mold within a kiln at elevated temperatures, causing the glass to\nmelt and fill the entire mold inside, thereby forming a 3D glass artwork\n[7,10,11]. However, the lost-wax process, particularly when executed at high\ntemperatures exceeding 1000 \u00b0C, presents substantial challenges, including the\nneed for specialized kiln equipment and expertise in temperature control [5].\nParticularly in the firing process of glass art, it is crucial to prevent the\nformation of air bubbles in the glass [12,13]. Although the technology demands\na complex production process and strict high-temperature control, it enables\nartists to actualize their design ideas and create unique glass pieces. Due to\nthe relatively high threshold of lost-wax glass casting technology, a\nsignificant investment in kiln equipment and processing tools is required for\nin-depth exploration and learning of this technique. Moreover, conventional\nfurnaces not only consume a considerable amount of electricity but also tend\nto emit harmful emissions and increase the ambient temperature. On the other\nhand, the cost of purchasing kiln equipment poses a significant burden for\nartists with limited space and funds.\n\nAddressing these challenges, this study proposes an innovative approach that\nintegrates the microwave kiln with lost-wax glass casting techniques. This\nintegration aims to simplify the traditional high-temperature glass firing\nprocess, potentially transforming it into a more accessible and time-efficient\npractice. Compared with previous studies that focused on the use of microwave\nkilns for flat glass art and the challenges of high-temperature control in\ntraditional lost-wax glass casting, this study provides a novel approach to\ncreating three-dimensional glass art without the need for traditional high-\ntemperature kilns. By doing so, it opens the door for creating unique,\nintricate 3D glass art pieces. Additionally, the study explores the potential\nof increasing the thickness of refractory gypsum in microwave kiln\napplications, aiming to enhance our understanding of the glass firing process\nwithin this novel context. Through this approach, the study seeks to lower the\ntechnical barriers inherent in traditional lost-wax glass casting, thereby\nexpanding the creative possibilities for artists in the realm of glassmaking\nand potentially revolutionizing the field with this accessible, innovative\ntechnology. This innovation not only offers a more convenient method for glass\nart practitioners to create 3D pieces but also broadens the application range\nof microwave kilns.\n\n## 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n#### 2.1. Microwave Kiln\n\nThe microwave kiln is a white cylindrical glass-melting refractory tool\nconsisting of a lid and a base. The top of the lid has a central hole that\nallows smoke to escape and also serves as a means to observe the glass melting\nprocess. Additionally, it is composed of two different materials. The white\npart is made of ceramic fiber, a material known for its fire-resistant\nproperties, whereas the interior of the kiln is made of silicon carbide (SiC),\nprimarily used to absorb microwave radiation within the microwave oven for\nrapid heating effects, as illustrated in Figure 1. This tool offers\nsignificant advantages for creating small glass sculptures. Under normal\noperation, placing the microwave kiln in a medium-sized home microwave oven\nwith a power of 1100 W can rapidly heat it to temperatures exceeding 900 \u00b0C\nwithin 5\u201310 min, causing the glass within the microwave kiln to melt. In terms\nof both glass firing and cooling times, it reduces more than half the time and\ndecreases electricity consumption compared to professional kilns, thereby\nenhancing production efficiency [14,15]. The microwave kiln is a very\npractical tool for studios with limited space and funds or for individual\ncreators.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the microwave kiln.\n\nIt is noteworthy that, in the case of glass firing using a microwave kiln,\nunlike professional kilns, there is no microcomputer temperature controller.\nTherefore, when melting glass in a microwave kiln placed inside a microwave\noven, observation of the glass melting process is required through the hole in\nthe kiln\u2019s lid. Due to the limited view from the hole, it is common practice\nto remove the microwave kiln from the microwave oven after the firing process\nis completed and then lift the lid of the kiln for further observation of the\nmelted glass. As usage increases, the microwave kiln\u2019s internal heating\nmaterial, silicon carbide, undergoes wear and tear from microwave heating.\nThis deterioration not only impairs the kiln\u2019s heating efficiency but may also\nlead to silicon carbide fragments dislodging from the kiln\u2019s lid and falling\nonto the glass artwork, causing defects. Consequently, the decision to replace\nthe microwave kiln should be based on careful consideration of its usage\nconditions. Additionally, factors such as the microwave oven\u2019s output power\nand the size and design of the glass can affect the firing temperature and the\nnumber and duration of the firing cycles.\n\n#### 2.2. Casting Glass\n\nLost-wax glass casting utilizes casting glass blocks with a coefficient of\nexpansion (COE) of 96 as the creative material. This type of casting glass is\nalso known as lead crystal glass, containing 24% to 40% lead oxide (PbO). The\nmost notable characteristics of casting glass are its lower processing\ntemperature, higher fluidity for easy molding, and considerable transparency\nand refractive index [16,17]. It is frequently utilized as an important\nmaterial in the production of high-quality tableware [18]. Furthermore, this\nleaded glass can be recycled and re-melted to form new glass [19]. In this\nstudy, the casting glass size is a circular disk with a diameter of 100 mm and\na thickness of 15 mm. Before firing, the casting glass needs to be cleaned and\nwiped dry. Then, it is shattered into small pieces and granules using a\ntungsten steel hammer. These glass fragments are then placed into a refractory\ngypsum mold, preparing for the heat processing stage.\n\n#### 2.3. Casting Refractory Gypsum\n\nDuring the lost-wax glass casting process, the preparation of refractory\nmaterials capable of withstanding high temperatures is essential in the pre-\nmanufacturing stage of heat processing. Refractory plaster molds are composed\nof adhesives, modifiers, quartz sand, and other refractory materials. They\npossess a robust structure capable of enduring high temperatures and exhibit\nexcellent fire-resistant properties, making them suitable for various high-\ntemperature casting applications. Refractory gypsum is typically mixed with\nwater and then poured into a wax model to create a thick refractory plaster\nmold. This is followed by a high-temperature dewaxing process, where the wax\nis melted away, leaving behind a hollow refractory plaster mold. Casting glass\nis then placed inside this mold, and subsequently, the assembly is put into a\nkiln. The glass is heated to high temperatures until it melts and takes the\nshape of the mold\u2019s interior. Subsequently, after firing and molding in the\nkiln, the refractory plaster molds have to be dismantled to remove the glass\nwork, a process that can lead to mold breakage, so these refractory molds are\ngenerally used only once and are not suitable for repeated use [11,19,20].\n\n#### 2.4. Lost-Wax Glass Casting\n\nCasting is one of the oldest technological crafts in the world [13]. Early\nhumans had already mastered the use of simple tools to create wax models,\nwhich were then placed in sand molds for heating. Subsequently, the wax was\npoured out to obtain a hollow sand mold, into which molten metal was poured\nand left to cool and solidify, ultimately yielding metal tools [21]. This\nintricate production process is defined as lost-wax casting. Over time and\nthrough the centuries, the casting technique has been widely adopted in\nvarious countries to create jewelry, idols, and other art forms. This is\nevidenced by ancient artifacts discovered in Egypt, Central and South America,\nGreece, Mexico, China, and India [22]. Throughout the development of casting\ntechniques, ancient Egyptians as early as 3000 BC not only knew how to utilize\nmetal for lost-wax casting but also mastered the transformation of metal into\nglass materials, giving rise to the earliest known lost-wax glass casting [3].\nThe uniqueness of lost-wax glass casting lies in the glass\u2019s ability to\nproduce varying refractions and color effects with changes in light angle.\nThis allows for the observation of the glass\u2019s internal fluidity, resulting in\na rich array of visual effects [23]. With the Syrian\u2019s discovery of glass\nblowing, artisans crafted a wide array of items, including glasses, bowls, and\nother everyday objects. As demand surged and glassware spread throughout the\nRoman Empire, the older technique of lost-wax glass casting gradually faded\ninto obscurity [24]. It was not until the late 19th century that the French\nceramic artist Henri Cros made significant improvements to the lost-wax glass\ncasting technique. Compared to the ancient version of lost-wax glass casting,\nwhich only allowed for partial glass objects on the surface of artworks, Henri\nCros\u2019 modification involved melting the primary components of glass at high\ntemperatures and then processing them into glass materials. Subsequently,\nthese glass materials were broken down or ground into granules or powder and\nplaced into refractory gypsum molds to cast integrated glass artworks. At the\ntime, artists in European countries extensively utilized this glass-casting\ntechnique in their arts and crafts designs [5,25,26,27].\n\nUp to the present day, lost-wax glass casting has evolved into a comprehensive\nproduction process. This process includes creating wax models and replicating\nthem in refractory gypsum molds, followed by high-temperature dewaxing to\nobtain hollow refractory gypsum molds. Casting glass material is then placed\ninside these molds and kiln-fired. Finally, the refractory gypsum molds are\ndismantled, and the pieces are ground and polished to create exquisite glass\nartwork [25]. This study aims to verify the feasibility of implementing lost-\nwax glass casting using a microwave kiln. For the heat processing stage, a\ncombination of a microwave oven and a microwave kiln is used to produce 3D\nglass artwork, with the production process illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of the lost-wax glass casting production process.\n\n#### 2.5. Experimental Procedures\n\nTo confirm the innovative application of the microwave kiln in lost-wax glass\ncasting technology, two sizes of microwave kilns were used in the heat\nprocessing stage to produce 3D glass artworks.\n\nThe large kiln measures diameter 195 mm \u00d7 height 110 mm externally and\ndiameter 135 mm \u00d7 height 45 mm internally. The small kiln measures diameter\n120 mm \u00d7 height 45 mm externally and diameter 75 mm \u00d7 height 45 mm. A 500 W\nhousehold microwave oven was utilized for the process. In addition, three\ndifferent sizes and shapes (from small to large) of refractory plaster molds\nwith a thickness of over 1 cm were prepared for testing, as shown in Figure 3:\n\nFigure 3. Schematic diagram of refractory plaster molds.\n\nA shell-shaped mold, diameter 6 cm \u00d7 height 2 cm in height, holds 30 g of\ncasting glass to produce an artwork of length 3.5 cm \u00d7 width 2 cm \u00d7 height 1\ncm.\n\nA mountain-shaped mold, diameter 8 cm \u00d7 height 3.5 cm in height, holds 60 g of\ncasting glass to produce an artwork of length 3.5 cm \u00d7 width 2 cm \u00d7 height 5.5\ncm.\n\nA leaf-shaped mold, the largest, at a diameter of 9.5 cm \u00d7 height 4 cm in\nheight, holds 219 g of casting glass to produce an artwork of length 7.5 cm \u00d7\nwidth 4 cm \u00d7 height 3 cm.\n\n## 3\\. Results and Discussion\n\nIn this study, refractory plaster with a thickness of over 1 cm was placed\ninside a microwave kiln and then heated using a microwave oven. This process\nsuccessfully produced 3D glass artworks of different sizes. Simultaneously,\nkey factors in the kiln firing process were established, including (1) the\noutput power of the microwave oven, (2) heating duration, (3) number of\nheating cycles, (4) kiln firing temperature, and (5) cooling time after kiln\nfiring.\n\nThe output power and heating time of the microwave oven are very important for\nthe microwave kiln to absorb microwave radiation. These two factors directly\naffect the degree of melting of the casting glass in the refractory plaster\nmold. Therefore, effective control of the heating time not only ensures that\nthe casting glass melts uniformly but also prevents overheating, which can\nlead to air bubbles in the casting glass.\n\n#### 3.1. The First Cast Glass Trial Firing\n\nTo investigate the effects of a 500-watt household microwave oven and a\nmicrowave kiln on three types of refractory plaster molds of varying shapes,\nsizes, and glass weights, this study aimed to identify the softening point of\nthe cast glass and the optimal firing time. Experimentally, a shell-shaped\nmold with a diameter of 6 cm \u00d7 height 2 cm was placed in a small microwave\nkiln. Additionally, a mountain-shaped mold with a diameter of 8 cm \u00d7 height\n3.5 cm, and a leaf-shaped mold, the largest, with a diameter of 9.5 cm \u00d7\nheight 4 cm, were placed in a large microwave kiln. Subsequently, the\nmicrowave kiln was placed in the microwave oven for the initial trial firing\nof the glass.\n\nAs shown in Table 1. Due to the three different molds with different weights\nof glass used, the first-time trial firing time was set to 15 min for the\nshell-shaped mold and 30 min for the mountain-shaped mold and leaf-shaped mold\nto obtain the first cast glass trial firing temperature. As shown in Figure 4,\nthe refractory plaster molds for the shell shape were microwaved for 15 min,\nand the temperature inside the microwave kiln reached 650.6 \u00b0C, which caused\nthe cast glass to melt into the shape inside the mold. However, the\ntemperatures of the cast glass inside the refractory plaster molds for the\nmountain shape and the leaf shape came to 550 \u00b0C and 275.8 \u00b0C, respectively,\nindicating that the cast glass had not yet reached the melting point.\nTherefore, a second cast glass trial firing will be conducted.\n\nFigure 4. Results of the first cast glass trial firing.\n\nTable 1. Time and temperature for first casting glass trial firing.\n\n#### 3.2. The Second Cast Glass Trial Firing\n\nSince the temperature of the refractory plaster mold for the mountain shape\nreached 550 \u00b0C during the first trial firing, and the cast glass was evaluated\nto be only 60 g, the second trial firing time was set to 15 min of microwave\nheating. Under these conditions, the internal temperature of the microwave\nkiln reached 681.3 \u00b0C, causing the cast glass to melt into the shape of the\ninterior of the mold. On the other hand, for the leaf-shaped refractory\nplaster mold, the temperature reached 275.8 \u00b0C during the first trial firing,\nand the cast glass was evaluated to be 219 g. The second trial firing time was\nset to 20 min of microwave heating; at this time, the temperature inside the\nmicrowave kiln reached 500 \u00b0C, and the cast glass began to soften but did not\nreach a completely molten state (as shown in Table 2). According to Figure 5,\nthe result of the second casting glass trial firing, therefore, the third\nglass trial firing will be carried out.\n\nFigure 5. Results of the second cast glass trial firing.\n\nTable 2. Time and temperature for second casting glass trial firing.\n\n#### 3.3. The Third Cast Glass Trial Firing\n\nDuring the second trial firing, the temperature of the casting glass in the\nrefractory plaster mold for leaf shaping reached 550 \u00b0C; therefore, the third\ntrial firing time was set to 15 min of microwave heating. At this time, the\ntemperature inside the microwave kiln reached 771.7 \u00b0C (as shown in Table 3),\ncausing the cast glass to melt into the shape inside the mold, as shown in\nFigure 6.\n\nFigure 6. Results of the third cast glass trial firing.\n\nTable 3. Time and temperature for third casting glass trial firing.\n\n#### 3.4. The Casting Glass Cooling\n\nAs shown in Figure 7, when the casting glass in the three different shapes of\nrefractory plaster molds is melted into the shape inside the molds, then it\nenters the cooling stage. When the shell-shaped cast glass reaches the\nsoftening point, the cooling process begins. After three hours, the\ntemperature inside the microwave kiln was reduced to room temperature. The\ncasting glass for the mountain and leaf shapes reached the softening point and\nstarted to cool down. After 5 and 8 h, respectively, the internal temperature\nof the microwave kiln was also reduced to room temperature.\n\nFigure 7. Casting glass firing temperature curves.\n\n#### 3.5. Finished 3D Glass Artwork\n\nAs shown in Figure 8, the kiln firing results show that the cast glass in the\nthree different shapes of refractory plaster molds can be softened uniformly\nduring the melting process after one to three different kiln firing times and\ntemperatures. This method prevents excessive glass fluidity due to rapid\nheating, thereby avoiding defects such as excessive air bubbles on the surface\nand inside the 3D glass artwork. In this study, it was found that there was a\ntemperature difference between the refractory plaster mold and the cast glass\nduring the kiln firing process. Notably, refractory plaster molds quickly\nabsorb and dissipate heat, whereas cast glass absorbs heat quickly but\ndissipates it slowly. Therefore, to create 3D glass artwork, the larger the\nrefractory plaster mold and the heavier the weight of the cast glass, the\nnumber of heat cycles will need to be increased to ensure consistent\ntemperatures inside and outside the mold.\n\nFigure 8. 3D glass artwork in different shapes.\n\n#### 3.6. Comparison of a Microwave Kiln and a Conventional Kiln in 3D Glass\nArtworks\n\nAs shown in Figure 9, a mountain-shaped 3D glass artwork serves as an example.\nThe same cast glass and refractory plaster molds were used and then fired in\nboth the microwave kiln and the traditional kiln, respectively. Subsequently,\na close-up examination of the back of the 3D glass artwork revealed that,\nwhile some tiny air bubbles exist in the pieces fired in the microwave kiln,\nfewer air bubbles were present in those fired in the traditional kiln. In\nother words, the quality of 3D glass artwork fired in a microwave kiln already\napproaches that of pieces fired in professional kilns.\n\nFigure 9. Comparison of the number of air bubbles in 3D glass artworks fired\nin different kilns.\n\n## 4\\. Conclusions\n\nThis study utilized a microwave kiln in combination with a household microwave\noven as an alternative to traditional kiln equipment, exploring the\nfeasibility of implementing lost-wax glass casting with the goal of lowering\nthe technical threshold and reducing production costs. This innovative\napproach challenges conventional reliance on traditional kiln equipment and\noffers a more accessible and cost-effective solution for glass artists and\nhobbyists. It significantly reduces the entry barrier and operational costs\nfor producing small-scale 3D glass artworks, making it an attractive option\nfor individual artists and small studios.\n\nAccording to the data from the temperature curves of three different cast\nglass kiln firings, using a small microwave kiln to produce shell-shaped cast\nglass required only 15 min to reach high temperatures of around 650 \u00b0C,\nsufficient for creating 3D glass artworks. In contrast, larger volumes of\nmountain and leaf-shaped glass artworks required a large microwave kiln, 2 to\n3 rounds of kiln firing, and observation. The firing duration for these larger\npieces ranged from 45 min to over an hour to reach temperatures around 770 \u00b0C.\nAdditionally, the glass cooling time for these larger artworks varied from 5\nto 8 h before proceeding to the subsequent cold processing and grinding\nprocedures. A critical contribution of this research lies in its detailed\ninvestigation of the optimal conditions required for producing 3D glass\nartworks. The study meticulously examined the interactions of several factors,\nsuch as microwave output power, heating duration, number of heating cycles,\nkiln firing temperature, and post-firing cooling time. These elements are\ncrucial for ensuring the uniform melting of cast glass within refractory\nplaster molds, thereby preventing common defects like excessive air bubbles\nthat compromise the integrity and aesthetics of the final artwork.\n\nMoreover, this study demonstrated that silicon carbide (SiC) inside the\nmicrowave kiln was able to produce a uniform heating effect on refractory\nplaster molds and casting glass when absorbing microwave radiation. This\nfinding underscores the potential for using SiC to enhance the quality and\nconsistency of microwave-assisted glass casting. Finally, based on the\nfindings of this study, the feasibility of producing 3D glass artworks can be\nfurther explored by considering the modification of microwave absorbers and\napplying them to the production process of dewaxed glass casting. This\nsuggests new avenues for research and application in the field of glass art\nproduction.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, J.-J.H. and S.-C.C.; methodology, M.-S.K. and J.-J.H.;\nformal analysis, S.-C.C. and M.-S.K.; investigation, J.-J.H. and S.-C.C.;\nresources, M.-S.K. and S.-C.C.; data curation, M.-S.K. and S.-C.C.;\nwriting\u2014original draft preparation, S.-C.C. and M.-S.K.; writing\u2014review and\nediting, J.-J.H. and M.-S.K.; visualization, M.-S.K.
