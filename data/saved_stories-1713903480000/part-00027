Licklider wrote a memo addressed to the \u201cMembers and\nAffiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network\u201d, widely considered to be the\ngenesis of ARPANET and by extension the modern Internet. Except, the memo\ndescribes a lot more than just \u201cinternetworking\u201d. Licklider has a very clear\nvision of an online, collaborative, malleable substrate for computing:\n\n> I want to retrieve a set of experimental data that is on a tape called\n> Listening Test. The data are called \u201cexperiment 3.\u201d These data are basically\n> percentages for various signal-to-noise ratios. There are many such\n> empirical functions. The experiment had a matrix design, with several\n> listeners, several modes of presentation, several signal frequencies, and\n> several durations. I want, first, to fit some \u201ctheoretical\u201d curves to the\n> measured data. I want to do this in a preliminary way to find out what basic\n> function I want to choose for the theoretical relation between percentage\n> and signal-to-noise ratio. On another tape, called \u201cCurve Fitting,\u201d I have\n> some routines that fit straight lines, power functions, and cumulative\n> normal curves. But, I want to try some others, also. Let me try, at the\n> beginning, the functions for which I have programs. The trouble is, I do not\n> have a good grid-plotting program. I want to borrow one. Simple, rectangular\n> coordinates will do, but I would like to specify how many divisions of each\n> scale there should be and what the labels should be. I want to put that\n> information in through my typewriter. Is there a suitable grid-plotting\n> program anywhere in the system? Using prevailing network doctrine, I\n> interrogate first the local facility, and then other centers. Let us suppose\n> that I am working at SDC, and that I find a program that looks suitable on a\n> disc file in Berkeley. My programs were written in JOVIAL.\n>\n> The programs I have located through the system were written in FORTRAN. I\n> would like to bring them in as relocatable binary programs and, using them\n> as subroutines, from my curve-fitting programs, either at \u201cbring-in time\u201d or\n> at \u201crun-time.\u201d\n>\n> Supposing that I am able to accomplish the steps just described, let us\n> proceed. I find that straight lines, cubics, quintics, etc., do not provide\n> good fits to the data. The best fits look bad when I view them on the\n> oscilloscope.\n>\n> The fits of the measured data to the cumulative normal curve are not\n> prohibitively bad. I am more interested in finding a basic function that I\n> can control appropriately with a few perimeters than I am in making contact\n> with any particular theory about the detection process, so I want to find\n> out merely whether anyone in the system has any curve- fitting programs that\n> will accept functions supplied by the user or that happen to have built-in\n> functions roughly like the cumulative normal curve, but asymmetrical. Let us\n> suppose that I interrogate the various files, or perhaps interrogate a\n> master-integrated, network file, and find out that no such programs exist. I\n> decide, therefore, to go along with the normal curve.\n>\n> At this point, I have to do some programming. I want to hold on to my data,\n> to the programs for normal curve fitting, and to display programs that I\n> borrowed. What I want to do is to fit cumulative normal curves to my various\n> sub-sets of data constraining the mean and the variance to change slowly as\n> I proceed along any of the ordinal or ratio- scale dimensions of my\n> experiment, and permitting slightly different sets of perimeters for the\n> various subjects. So, what I want to do next is to create a kind of master\n> program to set perimeter values for the curve- fitting routines, and to\n> display both the graphical fits and the numerical measures of goodness to\n> fit as, with light-pen and graphics of perimeters versus independent\n> variables on the oscilloscope screen, I set up and try out various (to me)\n> reasonable configurations. Let us say that I try to program repeatedly on my\n> actual data, with the subordinate programs already mentioned, until I get\n> the thing to work.\n>\n> Let us suppose that I finally do succeed, that I get some reasonable\n> results, photograph the graphs showing both the empirical data and the\n> \u201ctheoretical\u201d curves, and retain for future use the new programs. I want to\n> make a system of the whole set of programs and store it away under the name\n> \u201cConstrained-perimeter Normal-curve-fitting System.\u201d\n\nI find this a deeply compelling vision, even 61 years later! Online access to\ndata and applications, similar to the Web/cloud model we have today, but where\nthe applications (server-side as well as client-side) can be dynamically\nmodified to take advantage of new capabilities (no matter what language they\nwere originally built with). One where computation moves from a remote service\nto your local machine depending on which is most suitable. And where\nmodifications can be easily published for others to discover and reuse.\n\nPieces of it certainly exist today, but not in a deep, systematic way. In\nfact, while all the core technology was around in the 70s, to the best of my\nknowledge no one has ever built a demo of this workflow. (I\u2019d love to hear if\nanyone knows otherwise.)\n\nHyperMap is a new spec for REST APIs that is self-descriptive and supports\nclient-side code execution, two key capabilities that I think make it one of\nthe foundational rails for the Intergalactic Computer Network. In the next few\nweeks I\u2019ll release a HyperMap powered demo of Licklider\u2019s workflow. If you\u2019d\nlike to stay up to date follow along on Twitter or in the Discord.\n\n> Computers are COMPLETELY GENERAL, with no fixed purpose or style of\n> operation.
