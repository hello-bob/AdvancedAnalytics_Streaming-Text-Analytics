So here are some examples of tattoos\nwith information about their price, location, detail and information about the\nartist.\n\nThis will help you better understand how different tattoo jobs are priced.\n\n### Dotwork and Fineline - 1600$ - USA\n\nTattoo done in Phoenix, Arizona, by an experienced artist. Session lasted\nabout 9 hours and the tattoo boasts a lot of attention to detail.\n\n### Lettering Blackwork - 50$ - Poland\n\nTattoo was done in Krakow, Poland, by a starting artist.

Session lasted about\n10 hours and was done using several techniques.\n\n## Price Tables\n\n### Average Tattoo Costs Per Size\n\n(Based on a medium level of detail crafted by an established artist)\n\nTattoo artists often charge based on the time it takes to complete a piece, so\nnaturally larger tattoos require more time and dedication to complete. The\ntable above estimates the same drawing in different sizes.\n\nAn intricate design with fine details will demand more time and will impact\nthe price significantly. Of course in some cases a small tattoo can be more\nexpensive than a sleeve - it all depends on the context.\n\n### Average Tattoo Costs Per Artist Level\n\n(Based on a medium-sized tattoo with a basic level of detail)\n\nHighly skilled and experienced artists often charge more for their work,\nreflecting the quality and craftsmanship they bring to the table.\n\nBefore settling on an artist, take the time to review their portfolio, read\nclient reviews, and ensure their style aligns with your vision.\n\nIf you go to a studio, remember that it will not be the studio putting ink on\nyour skin, it will be an artist, so you should know specifically who you want\nto work with.\n\n### Average Tattoo Costs Per Region\n\n(Based on a medium-sized tattoo taking around 3 hours of work from an\nestablished artist)\n\nThe biggest impact on price is the hourly rate charged by the artist.\n\nThe table above refers to about 3 hours of work from an artist in each of the\nlocation.\n\nPlease consider that if it's not a walk-in, many artists will add the hours\ndedicated to meeting with you and designing your piece.\n\n### Aftercare Products\n\nThe costs don't stop when the needle stops.\n\nEnsuring the longevity and vibrancy of your new ink involves proper aftercare.\n\nWhile aftercare is not a direct part of the tattoo creation process, it's an\nessential step in maintaining the health of your skin and preserving the\nquality of the tattoo.\n\n### You should also Location on the Body\n\nDifferent parts of the body present varying levels of difficulty for the\nartist. Areas with thinner skin, more bone, or intricate curves may require\nextra care and precision, affecting the overall cost.\n\nFor example, a tattoo on a flat and fleshy area might be less expensive than\none on a bony or sensitive part of the body.\n\n### Tattoo Shop Location\n\nThe geographical location of the tattoo studio can influence pricing.\n\nIn urban areas with a higher cost of living, tattoo shops may charge more to\ncover overhead expenses such as rent, utilities, and other operational costs.\n\nFor instance, in Europe, every tattoo parlor located in a city center will be\nsignificantly more expensive than a parlor in the outskirts of the city.\n\nConsider researching different studios in your area and nearby cities to get\nan idea of the price range.\n\n### Color vs. Black and Gray\n\nThe choice between color and black-and-gray tattoos can also impact the cost.\n\nColor tattoos often require more time and skill, as well as a broader range of\nink colors. Simply changing between colors is time consuming and will require\nmore time from the tattoo artist.\n\n### Consultation and Customization\n\nSome artists charge for consultation and customization services.\n\nIf you require a unique design tailored to your preferences, be prepared to\ncover the artist's time and effort spent on creating and refining the artwork\nbefore the actual tattooing process begins.\n\n### Tip\n\nTipping applies only in the USA and other anglophone countries where it is\ncustomary. In most countries in Europe it will not be part of the equation.\n\nIn addition, tipping in the tattoo industry is not mandatory. It is also not\nalways expected but it's always appreciated:\n\n  * If you feel that the artist went above and beyond, we suggest tipping around 20% to 25%.\n  * If the work was well done and respectful, around 10% to 20%.\n  * If it was ok and uneventful, a 10% tip will suffice.\n\n## Golden Tips\n\n  * If you're getting a tattoo in the US, make sure to verify all possible additional costs such as added tax and expected tip\n  * Investing in a tattoo you'll love for the rest of your life is way cheaper than saving a few bucks - cover-ups are always more expensive than what they're covering\n  * Tattoos are a lifetime art commitment - invest proportionally to it's exposure on your body!\n  * The most expensive and painful part of a tattoo's lifecycle is the laser removal - make sure you won't ever need it!\n\n#### Additional Guides\n\nHow to Heal Your New Tattoo: An Aftercare Step by Step Guide\n\nTop 5 Tattoo Aftercare Lotions and Balms\n\n#### Tags:\n\naftercareartistcustomdesignexperiencehow toliststudiostyletattootattoo\nartisttattoo studiotechniques\n\n#### Share Article\n\nFollow Me Written By\n\n#### Julian Brzozowski\n\nJulian is an artist by nature and a tattoo enthusiast by choice.
