The breakthrough could shed new\nlight on unsolved crimes, as forensic gel lifters \u2014 which transfer prints onto\na gelatine surface \u2014 are used globally to preserve and visualise fingerprints\nfound at crime scenes.\n\nA number of tests can detect drugs directly from fingerprints, but these can\nbe destructive to the fingerprint, degrade drug residues or be affected by\nenvironmental interference. It has long been speculated that gel-lifted prints\ncontain valuable chemical information and could offer more accurate drug\ndetection; however, traditional techniques used to analyse the chemicals\npresent in a sample have previously not been suitable for gel lifters as they\ndetect all chemicals present \u2014 including those that make up the gel. The\nmethod used at Loughborough University, called sfPESI-MS, overcomes this issue\nusing a rapid separation mechanism that distinguishes the drug substance from\nthe background of the gel.\n\nThe process involves sampling the chemicals from the gel lifters into tiny\nliquid droplets. The chemicals extracted into the droplets are then ionised,\nwhich means they gain or lose electric charge depending on their chemical\nproperties. The drug substance chemicals are more surface active than the\nchemicals originating from the gel, which enables them to be separated from\nthe mixture. This separation method enables the direct detection of a drug\nsubstance using mass spectrometry, which identifies chemicals by measuring\ntheir molecular weight.\n\nThe Loughborough researchers successfully tested the technique using Zolpidem-\nlaced fingerprints lifted from glass, metal and paper surfaces in a laboratory\nsetting, with their results published in the journal Drug Testing and\nAnalysis. They now hope to work with police forces to analyse stored gel-\nlifted prints and use the method to identify other substances.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that analysis of gel-lifted prints for a drug\nsubstance has been accomplished, and shows that lifted prints and other\nforensic marks can be interrogated for useful information,\u201d said Dr Jim\nReynolds, the research lead.\n\n\u201cZolpidem was the focus of our research, but the method could just as easily\nbe applied to other drug substances a person may have been handling and could\nbe applied to other chemicals such as explosives, gunshot residues, paints and\ndyes.\n\n\u201cBy linking chemical information to the fingerprint, we can identify the\nindividual and link to the handling of an illicit substance, which may prove\nuseful in a prosecution.\u201d\n\nFirst author Dr Ayoung Kim said the researchers would like to apply their\nmethod to real samples from criminal investigations, with Reynolds adding,\n\u201cSince gel-lifted prints and marks can be stored for many years, the technique\ncould be of real use in cold cases where additional information may prove\nuseful to either link or exonerate a suspect to the investigation.\n\n\u201cWorking with police forces and applying the method to cold case samples could\nhelp bring criminals to justice who may have thought they have got away with\nit.\u201d\n\nImage credit: iStock.com/Rosendo Serrano Valera\n\nRelated News\n\n#### Mid-infrared microscope used to look inside bacteria\n\nResearchers have constructed an improved mid-infrared microscope, enabling\nthem to see the...\n\n#### Water-based paints contain potentially hazardous chemicals\n\nSome water-based paints contain compounds that are considered volatile organic\ncompounds, along...\n\n#### Portable device enables regular testing for kidney disease\n\nAccessible, affordable urinalysis to assess kidney function could be a boon in\nremote areas as...\n\nFeatured Articles\n\nClinical Trial Transformation: Recent Changes and Future Predictions\n\nNew Therapies: Bridge Knowledge, Speed and Quality\n\nMulti-Component FTIR Gas Analyser for Continuous Measurement of ppm to % vol\nin a Portable or Mobile Form\n\nPremium Listings\n\nResources\n\n  * How to innovate and scale up your lab with an end-to-end digital backbone\n\n  * [eBook] The 21st century lab: your roadmap for transformation\n\n  * How to ensure lab compliance and maximise your productivity\n\n  * 3 critical factors of successfully deploying a single ELN in your lab\n\n  * What you need to know at a glance\n\nEvents\n\n  * Gravitational Wave Advanced Detector Workshop 2024\n\n  * ANZAN 2024 ASM\n\n  * AusMedtech 2024\n\n  * Bionics Institute Innovation Lecture 2024\n\n  * 14th International NanoMedicine Conference\n\n## Content from other channels on our network\n\nUniversal Robots announces seamless integration with Siemens PLCs\n\nStratasys announces high-definition 3D printing\n\nInteroperability initiative announced to improve IIoT insights\n\nOPC Foundation launches OPC for AI working group\n\nEngineers Australia welcomes government\u2019s circular economy initiatives\n\nUS policy change for raw breaded stuffed poultry products\n\nOctopus inspires new gripper mechanism for robots\n\nPringles reduces height of can but not the number of chips\n\nFive consumer trends in the dairy market and beyond\n\nLess-gassy cows to help beef and dairy sector reduce emissions\n\nEnhancing primary care with data-driven clinical support\n\nCollaboration key to improving adherence to physical activity guidelines\n\nAlfred Health trials eye-tracking tech to assess brain function\n\nCould UV light protect against hospital infections?\n\nAustralian regions with high cardiac arrest rates and low CPR: study\n\n## Are you interested in joining any of our other professional channels?\n\n  * Electrical, Comms & Data Contracting\n  * Electronics Design & Engineering\n  * Food Manufacturing & Technology\n  * Laboratory Technology\n  * Life Science & Biotechnology\n  * Process Control & Automation\n  * Radio Communications\n  * Health & Safety at Work\n  * Sustainability -
