Credit: Karl F.\nMacDorman.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and robots are becoming increasingly\nadvanced, exhibiting capabilities that vaguely resemble those of humans. The\ngrowing similarities between AIs and humans could ultimately bring users to\nattribute human feelings, experiences, thoughts, and sensations to these\nsystems, which some people perceive as eerie and uncanny.\n\nKarl F. MacDorman, associate dean of academic affairs and associate professor\nat the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in Indiana, has\nbeen conducting extensive research aimed at better understanding what could\nmake some robots and AI systems feel unnerving.\n\nHis most recent paper, published in Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial\nHumans, reviews past studies and reports the findings of an experiment testing\na recent theory known as \"mind perception,\" which proposes that people feel\neeriness when exposed to robots that closely resemble humans because they\nascribe minds to these robots.\n\n\"For many Westerners, the idea of a machine with conscious experience is\nunsettling,\" MacDorman told Tech Xplore. \"This discomfort extends to inanimate\nobjects as well. When reviewing Gray and Wegner's paper published in Cognition\nin 2012, I considered this topic well worth investigating, as its urgency has\nincreased with the rapid rise of AIs, such as ChatGPT and other large language\nmodels (LLMs).\"\n\nLLMs are sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) models that can learn\nto answer user queries in ways that strikingly mirror how humans communicate.\nWhile their responses are based on vast amounts of data that they were\npreviously trained on, the language they use and their ability to generate\nquery-specific content could make them easier to mistake for sentient beings.\n\nIn 2012, two researchers at Harvard University and University of North\nCarolina carried out experiments that explored the so-called \"uncanny valley.\"\nThis term is used to describe the unnerving nature of robots that have human-\nlike qualities.\n\nWhen he first read this 2012 paper, MacDorman was skeptical about whether\n\"mind perception\" was at the root of the uncanny valley. This inspired him to\nconduct new studies exploring its existence and the extent to which robots\nwith human-like characteristics are considered eerie.\n\nThe mixed-effects meta-regression model with construct (experience or\neeriness) and stimulus (present or absent) as moderators. Credit: Karl F.\nMacDorman.\n\n\"Despite other researchers replicating Gray and Wegner's findings, their\nreliance on the same experimental method and flawed assumptions merely circles\nback to the initial hypotheses,\" MacDorman explained.\n\n\"Essentially, they assume the conclusions they seek to establish. The uncanny\nvalley is the relation between how humanlike an artificial entity appears and\nour feelings of affinity and eeriness for it. So, unless the cause of these\nfeelings is our perception of the entity through our five senses, the\nexperiment is not about the uncanny valley.\"\n\nThe first objective of MacDorman's recent paper was to pinpoint the possible\nshortcomings of past \"mind perception\" experiments. Specifically, his\nhypothesis was that these experiments disconnect the manipulation of\nexperimental conditions from the appearance of an AI system.\n\n\"The manipulation in 'mind perception' experiments is just a description of\nwhether the entity can sense and feel,\" MacDorman said. \"What better way to\nshow this disconnection than by re-analyzing previous experiments? When I did\nthat, I found that machines described as able to sense and feel were much less\neerie when they were physically present or represented in videos or virtual\nreality than when they were absent.\"\n\nIn addition to performing a meta-regression analysis of previous related\nfindings, MacDorman also designed a new experiment that could be used to test\nmind perception theory. This experiment entails convincing a group of\nparticipants who do not think that machines could be sentient that they in\nfact can be or vice versa, by asking them to read texts and write related\nessays.\n\n\"This experiment allows us to compare how eerie the same robots are when they\nare viewed by a group of people who ascribe more sentience to them and a group\nwho ascribe less sentience to them,\" MacDorman said. \"If Gray and Wegner\n(2012) were correct, the group that ascribes more sentience should also find\nthe robots eerier, yet the results show otherwise.\"\n\nOverall, the results of the meta-analysis and experiment run by MacDorman\nsuggest that past studies backing mind perception theory could be flawed. In\nfact, the researcher gathered opposite results, suggesting that individuals\nwho attribute sentience to robots do not necessarily find them eerier due to\ntheir human resemblance.\n\nA structural equation model showing the stimuli\u2019s effect of experience,\nagency, eeriness, and coldness with Aiko as the reference. Credit: Karl F.\nMacDorman.\n\n\"The uncanny valley is a research area littered with theories purporting to\nexplain the phenomenon,\" MacDorman said. \"There are dozens of such theories,\nand I must admit, I am one of the main culprits. What I often see is\nresearchers advancing a particular theory, and one of the problems with\nresearch in general is that positive results are more likely to be published\nthan negative results.\n\n\"What I seldom observed, with a few exceptions, is an attempt to falsify\ntheories or hypotheses or at least to compare their explanatory power.\"\n\nMacDorman's recent work is among the first to critically examine mind\nperception and experiments aimed at testing this theory. His findings suggest\nthat rather than being linked to mind perception, the uncanny valley is rooted\nin automatic and stimulus-driven perceptual processes.\n\n\"The paper shows that the main cause of the uncanny valley is not attributions\nof conscious experience to machines,\" MacDorman said. \"It also shows that mind\nperception theory reaches beyond humanoid robots and can be applied to\ndisembodied AI like ChatGPT. This is a positive result from the meta-\nregression analysis on the 10 experiments found in the literature.\"\n\nThis recent study gathered interesting new insight about the so-called uncanny\nvalley and the link between perceptions of mind and how eerie a robot is\nperceived to be. This insight contributes to the understanding of how humans\nperceive robots and could inform the development of future AI systems.\n\n\"Although attributions of mind are not the main cause of the uncanny valley,\nthey are part of the story,\" MacDorman added. \"They can be relevant in some\ncontexts and situations, yet I don't think that attributing mind to a machine\nthat looks human is creepy. Instead, perceiving a mind in a machine that\nalready looks creepy makes it creepier. However, perceiving a mind in a\nmachine that has risen out of the uncanny valley and looks nearly human makes\nit less creepy.\n\n\"Exploring whether there is strong support for this speculation is an area for\nfuture research, which would involve using more varied and numerous stimuli.\"\n\nMore information: Karl F.
