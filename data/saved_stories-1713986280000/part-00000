The Guidance provides insights on how\nthe USPTO will analyze inventorship issues when AI systems play a role in the\ninventive process.\n\nThe Guidance reiterates the Federal Circuit's Thaler v. Vidal holding that\n\"only a natural person can be an inventor, so AI cannot be\",^3 while\nexplaining that AI-assisted inventions are \"not categorically unpatentable.\"\nThe Guidance explains that the inventorship analysis for AI-assisted\ninventions turns on whether a natural person has significantly contributed to\nthe claimed invention and that the use of an AI system does not, in and of\nitself, preclude a natural person from qualifying as an inventor.\n\nWhen determining the significance of the human contribution, the USPTO will\nconsider the Pannu factors (traditionally applied when determining joint\ninventorship). Accordingly, an inventor must:\n\n  1. Contribute in some significant manner to the conception or reduction to practice of the invention,\n  2. Make a contribution that is not insignificant in quality, when that contribution is measured against the dimension of the full invention, and\n  3. Do more than merely explain to the real inventors well-known concepts and/or the current state of the art.\n\nThe Guidance then goes on to say that determining whether a person's\ncontribution to an AI-assisted invention is significant \"may be difficult to\nascertain, and there is no bright-line test,\" but sets forth certain non-\nexhaustive guiding principles to help inform this analysis, namely:\n\n  * Simply presenting a problem to an AI system is unlikely to constitute significant contribution (but this could possibly be shown by the way the natural person constructs the AI system prompts in view of a specific problem to elicit a particular solution)\n  * A person who merely recognizes and appreciates an output of an AI system as inventive (particularly when apparent to those of ordinary skill) is not necessarily an inventor, but a person who takes the output of an AI system and makes a significant contribution to it (or conducts a successful experiment using it) may be\n  * In some cases, the person who designs, builds or trains an AI system in view of a specific problem to elicit a particular solution could be listed as an inventor, where the designing, building or training is a significant contribution to the invention created by the AI system\n  * However, mere ownership or oversight of an AI system that is used to create an invention does not, by itself, constitute significant human contribution\n  * A natural person must make a significant contribution to each and every claim in the patent or patent application (not just some of them)\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Guidance stresses that the significant contribution\ndetermination is made on a claim-by-claim and case-by-case basis, in each\ninstance turning on its own set of facts. As such, the gray areas between the\nclear examples provided in the Guidance will likely be decided by the Courts\nand the USPTO. The Guidance is open to comments until May 13, 2024, and may\nchange; but in the meantime, inventors seeking patent protection for their AI-\nassisted inventions should consider carefully documenting the human\ncontributions made during the inventive process, on a claim-by-claim basis,\nincluding:\n\n  1. The technology used, and to the extent the AI system has been designed, built or trained in view of a specific problem, the nature and details of such design, build and training; and\n  2. The steps taken, including the prompts outlining the specific problem to be solved or outcome to be achieved, the AI system outputs, subsequent experimentation and refinement with respect to outputs (including further prompting or independent experimentation).\n\n_1 Inventorship Guidance for AI-assisted Inventions, USPTO, Feb. 13, 2024,\navailable at: _https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/events/inventorship-guidance-ai-\nassisted-inventions-webinar_ 2 Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and\nTrustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, The White House,\nOct. 30, 2023, available at: _https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-\nroom/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-\ntrustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/_ 3 Thaler v.\nVidal, 43 F.4th 1207, 1213 (Fed.
