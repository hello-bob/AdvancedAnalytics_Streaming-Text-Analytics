But\nthis is precisely where Intel finds itself as there is a server recession in\nthe datacenter. And this, along with the difficulties of cleaning up its mess\nin chip manufacturing, is weighing down Intel\u2019s financial results like Jovian\ngravity.\n\nEarlier this month, we got some insight into Intel\u2019s true financial health\nwhen it rejiggered its annual books for 2021, 2022, and 2023 to include its\nproduct groups paying the Intel Foundry business for chip etching and\npackaging services, just as if they were an outside customer like Microsoft\nand a handful of others who are signing up to use the company\u2019s future 18A and\nwe presume 14A processes. People are not just excited that Intel has opened up\nits fabs to outside business. They are trying to mitigate the risks of having\nall of the world\u2019s chips coming out of one basket called Taiwan Semiconductor\nManufacturing Co, which is having a tough time with earthquakes in recent\nweeks and is always under a threat of invasion by China.\n\nIntel thinks is can be the second largest merchant foundry in the world by\n2030, which seems likely enough, but as we pointed out in going over TSMC\u2019s\nfinancials more recently, even should Intel get to the $40 billion in overall\nrevenues that its forecasts suggest are possible \u2013 $15 billion of that from\noutside customers \u2013 TSMC will have an AI accelerator etching and packaging\nbusiness that itself is larger than Intel\u2019s foundry biz. Top be more specific,\nas we showed in our model, if TSMC grows faster than average in the next\ncouple of years and then slows down lower than average in the couple of years\nafter that, it will have around $178 billion in sales in 2030.\n\nSo yes, Intel can be number two. But TSMC will, unless something radical\nchanges, be 4.5X as large as Intel Foundry.\n\nYikes.\n\nThe good news for the Intel product groups is that their profit and loss\nstatements have been backcast three years and recast for Q1 2024 so that they\npay only market rates for foundry services from their sister foundry\noperation. Which has the immediate effect of making these product groups more\nprofitable than they looked in the past. In fact, the change in bookkeeping\nhas wiped out some embarrassing operating losses in the \u201creal\u201d datacenter\nbusiness at Intel, by which we mean the sum of the Data Center and AI (DCAI)\ngroup, the Network and Edge (NEX) group, and the newly spun out Altera FPGA\nbusiness.\n\nLook for yourself, no more red ink:\n\nAdmittedly, operating income is pretty low there in Q3 2022, as you can see.\nBut look at all of that money Intel made \u2013 by which we mean operating profits\n\u2013 between the end of the Great Recession and the beginning of coronavirus\npandemic, which coincided with the rise of AMD in CPUs and the absolute\ndominance of Nvidia in GPUs.\n\nJust for reference, here is the annual recasting of Intel\u2019s results, showing\nthe old and new ways of counting the beans:\n\nAnd here is an updated table showing quarterly results for the past five\nquarters:\n\nFor those of you who think visually, here is a chart that shows the important\ngroups and how their revenues have fared:\n\nWe find this chart to be almost useless. You cannot get a feel of the ups and\ndowns of these businesses from such a small amount of data. Intel should have\ngiven us three years of data plus the current quarter, or even a decade of\ndata plus the current quarter, so we could fully understand what has happened.\n\nThe good news is, Intel gave us a good sense of how Intel Foundry fared for\nthe past three years in its annual data, and we know exactly how well and\npoorly the Altera business did. So we can extract the Altera business out of\nthe numbers we had for the DCAI and NEX groups to recast the data back to Q1\n2021 when Pat Gelsinger, Intel\u2019s first chief technology officer and formerly\nthe general manager of its Data Center Group, returned to the company after\nrunning a chunk of EMC and VMware as its savior chief executive officer.\n\nThis may all be painful, but Gelsinger is doing the right things and is a\ntireless cheerleader for the future of the chip company that he loves and that\nwithout question he should have been running all along.\n\nIn any event, we got out that trusty Excel spreadsheet and projected what\nIntel Foundry revenues would have been for the eight quarters of 2021 and 2022\nand extracted Altera out of the other groups, and if you do this, then you\nactually get something that shows you something. Take a gander:\n\nIntel\u2019s inability to get 10 nanometer, 7 nanometer, and 5 nanometer processes\nin the field at roughly the same time that TSMC did hurt its product designs\nand left the door open for AMD and the Arm collective to get into the\ndatacenter. The lack of a GPU alternative to Nvidia has also harmed Intel and\nthe industry. Imagine a world where Nvidia had to open up its software and\ninterconnect specifications because users could demand this?\n\nThis chart also shows you why Intel has been banging the drum so hard about\nIntel Foundry. The foundry business is its second-largest group, and probably\nwill remain so for many years unless something weird happens in the IT sector.\nOK, something even weirder. After Gelsinger left, Intel operated as a monopoly\nsupplier of CPUs in a world that loved CPUs, and it did not keep its foot on\nthe gas for its foundry innovation. And the lack of CPU competition from AMD\nand the Arm collective allowed it to get away with it for many years, raking\nin big bucks and having operating margins around 50 percent even with the\nextra heavy burden of the costs of that foundry business on its back.\n\nBut that competition came, as it always does, and suddenly Intel was not a\nlow-cost producer of server CPUs or even a producer of much-wanted GPUs.\n\nWith all of that in mind, let\u2019s go over the Intel numbers for the first\nquarter ended in March and take a look out into the future.\n\nIn Q1, Intel\u2019s revenues were up 8.6 percent to $12.72 billion, but it posed a\nnet loss of $381 million. That was a lot better than the $2.76 billion loss it\nhad in the year ago period, when revenues were only $11.72 billion, but the\ncompany also burned $3.72 billion in cash, with its cash and marketable\nsecurities standing at $21.31 billion as the quarter ended. That is not a lot\nfor an Intel that is eager to build foundries and invest in chip designs,\nwhich is why getting $45 billion of cash, loans, and tax incentives as part of\nthe CHIPS Act was crucial to the survival and revival of Intel.\n\nIn the quarter, the DCAI group had sales of $3.04 billion, up 4.7 percent,\nwith an operating income of $482 million, up by a factor of 21.9X from the\nabysmal $22 million operating income DCAI posted in the year ago period. (But\nhey, this was an actual loss before Intel Foundry was created and started\nshouldering the losses that were rightfully its own.) The \u201cSierra Forest\u201d Xeon\n6 E-core chip is imminent and is etched with the Intel 3 5 nanometer process,\nand the \u201cGranite Rapids\u201d Xeon 6 P-core chip will be released in the third\nquarter of this year using the same Intel 3 process. (We profiled these chips\nlast fall.) The \u201cClearwater Forest\u201d Xeon 7 E-core, using Intel\u2019s 18A process,\nis on deck for next year.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expect share trends to stabilize this year before improving in\n2025,\u201d Gelsinger said on a call with Wall Street analysts. \u201cWhile budgets are\nstill being prioritized to generative AI build-out where we have a strong\nposition in the head node, customer conversations continue to show improving\nsigns for traditional CPU refresh starting in late Q2 and into the second-\nhalf.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Gelsinger said that Intel now expected more than $500 million\nin revenues in the second half of this year for its Gaudi 3 matrix math\naccelerators, which were launched two weeks ago and which are absolutely\ncompetitive with Nvidia\u2019s \u201cHopper\u201d GPU accelerators for AI workloads \u2013\nespecially Llama models running atop the PyTorch framework. Back in October,\nIntel said it had a $2 billion pipeline for Gaudi compute engines, so with\nonly $500 million of that being converted, that means Intel is supply\nconstrained on TSMC\u2019s 5 nanometer process, which is used to etch the Gaudi 3.\n\n\u201cWe are three years into our transformation and 2024 represents the steepest\npart of the climb with five node in four year start-up costs peaking and the\nmajority of our volume on pre-EUV process nodes with uncompetitive economics,\u201d\nexplained Dave Zinsner, chief financial officer at Intel. \u201cHowever, as we the\ncrest the hill and look toward the next few years, we have strong wins at our\nback and a clear path to achieving the mid and long-term financial targets we\nlaid out earlier this month.\u201d\n\nAltera and NEX are both dealing with inventory capacity issues that are being\nburnt off, and their revenues and operating income are obviously looking\npretty weak. But Gelsinger said on the call that they would start turning\naround in the second half along with the CPU business. Average selling prices\nof Xeon CPUs are already on the rise thanks the existing Xeons, and this trend\nis expected as Intel delivers CPUs on advanced processes and with a\ncompetitive number of cores and features. Intel is standing by its prediction\nthat Altera will break $2 billion in sales for 2024.\n\n#### Sign up to our Newsletter\n\nFeaturing highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to\nyour inbox with nothing in between.
