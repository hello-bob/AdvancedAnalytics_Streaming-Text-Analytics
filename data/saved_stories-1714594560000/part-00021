As teenagers, my friends and I read Auster\u2019s work avidly for\nboth its strangeness \u2014 that touch of European surrealism \u2014 and its closeness.\n\n\u201cLong before \u2018Brooklyn\u2019 became a place where every novelist seemed to live,\nfrom Colson Whitehead to Jhumpa Lahiri,\u201d she added, \u201cAuster made being a\nwriter seem like something real, something a person actually did.\u201d\n\nHis reputation was anything but local, however. He took home several literary\nprizes in France alone. Like Woody Allen and Mickey Rourke, Mr. Auster, who\nhad lived in Paris as a young man, became one of those rare American imports\nto be embraced by the French as a native son.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you hear as you approach an Auster reading, anywhere in the\nworld, is French,\u201d New York magazine observed in 2007. \u201cMerely a best-selling\nauthor in these parts, Auster is a rock star in Paris.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nMr. Auster received the Grand Vermeil medal from Bertrand Delano\u00eb, the mayor\nof Paris, in a ceremony in 2010. Mr. Auster\u2019s work was particularly revered in\nFrance.

His first novel, \u201cCity of Glass,\u201d was rejected by 17\npublishers before it was published by a small press in California in 1985.\n\nThe book became the first installment in his most celebrated work, \u201cThe New\nYork Trilogy,\u201d three novels later packaged in a single volume. It was listed\nas one of the 25 most significant New York City novels of the last 100 years\nin a roundup in T, the style magazine published by The New York Times.\n\nImage\n\nMr. Auster\u2019s 1982 memoir is a haunting rumination on his chilly relationship\nwith his recently deceased father.Credit...via Penguin Random House\n\nImage\n\nMr. Auster\u2019s breakout work was a series of three novels, beginning in the\nmid-1980s, that were later packaged in one volume.Credit...via Penguin Random\nHouse\n\n\u201cCity of Glass\u201d is the story of a mystery writer who is reeling from personal\nloss \u2014 an ever-present theme in Mr. Auster\u2019s work \u2014 and who, through a wrong\nnumber, is mistaken for a private detective named, yes, Paul Auster. The\nwriter begins to take on the detective\u2019s identity, losing himself in a real-\nlife sleuthing job of his own while descending into madness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn some ways the book was a classic shamus tale. But Mr. Auster chafed at\nbeing limited by genre. \u201cYou could also say \u2018Crime and Punishment\u2019 is a\ndetective story, I suppose,\u201d he said in his 2017 book, \u201cA Life in Words,\u201d a\nself-analysis of his own work.\n\nHow The Times decides who gets an obituary.

I wanted\nto turn everything inside out.\u201d\n\nWhile to some critics such experimentalism brought to mind the deconstruction\napproach of Jacques Derrida, Mr. Auster often described himself as a throwback\nwho preferred Emily Bront\u00eb over the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, as he\nsaid in a 2009 interview with the British newspaper The Independent.\n\nHe eschewed computers, often writing by fountain pen in his beloved notebooks.\n\n\u201cKeyboards have always intimidated me,\u201d he told The Paris Review in 2003.\n\n\u201cA pen is a much more primitive instrument,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel that the words\nare coming out of your body, and then you dig the words into the page. Writing\nhas always had that tactile quality for me. It\u2019s a physical experience.\u201d\n\nHe would then turn to his vintage Olympia typewriter to type his handwritten\nmanuscripts. He immortalized the trusty machine in his 2002 book \u201cThe Story of\nMy Typewriter,\u201d with illustrations by the painter Sam Messer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nSuch antiquarian methods did nothing to slow Mr. Auster\u2019s breathless output.\nWriting six hours a day, often seven days a week, he pumped out a new book\nnearly annually for years. He ultimately published 34 books, accounting for\nshorter works that were later incorporated into larger books, including 18\nnovels and several acclaimed memoirs and assorted autobiographical works,\nalong with plays, screenplays and collections of stories, essays and poems.\n\nHis novels include critically acclaimed works like \u201cMoon Palace\u201d (1989), about\nthe odyssey of an orphan college student who receives a bequest of thousands\nof books; \u201cLeviathan\u201d (1992), about a writer investigating the death of a\nfriend who blew himself up while building a bomb; and \u201cThe Book of Illusions\u201d\n(2002), about a biographer exploring the mysterious disappearance of his\nsubject, a silent-screen star.\n\nAmong his memoirs are \u201cHand to Mouth\u201d (1997), about his early struggles as a\nwriter, and \u201cWinter Journal\u201d (2012), which, while written in the second\nperson, was an examination of the frailties of his aging body.\n\nBy the 1990s, Mr. Auster had set his sights on Hollywood. He wrote several\nscreenplays, some of which he directed.\n\nImage\n\nWilliam Hurt, left, and Harvey Keitel in a scene from \u201cSmoke\u201d (1995), one of\nseveral movies for which Mr. Auster wrote the screenplay.

It drew\ndeeply from his life in Park Slope, where he shared a brick townhouse with his\nwife, the novelist Siri Hustvedt.\n\nThe film, heavy with philosophical musings, stars Harvey Keitel as Auggie, the\nproprietor of a Park Slope tobacco shop that is a locus for a colorful\nassortment of neighborhood dreamers and eccentrics. One is Paul Benjamin (Mr.\nAuster\u2019s early pen name; Benjamin was his middle name), a cerebral, cigarette-\npuffing writer (William Hurt) whose life is saved when a young man (Harold\nPerrineau) pulls him from the path of a truck.\n\nThe same year, Mr. Auster, with Mr. Wang, directed a loose-limbed comedic\nfollow-up, \u201cBlue in the Face,\u201d sprinkled with cameos by a host of stars,\nincluding Lou Reed musing on cigarettes, Long Island and the Brooklyn Dodgers\nand Madonna delivering a saucy singing telegram.\n\nImage\n\nMr. Auster on the set of the 1998 film \u201cLulu on the Bridge,\u201d which he wrote\nand directed.

In his early 20s, Mr. Auster had considered going to film school in\nParis, as he told the director Wim Wenders in 2017 in Interview magazine.\n\n\u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t pursue it was, fundamentally, that I was so grotesquely\nshy at that point in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI had such difficulty speaking in\nfront of a group of more than two or three people that I thought, \u201cHow can I\ndirect a film if I can\u2019t talk in front of others?\u201d\n\n## Son of a Landlord\n\nPaul Benjamin Auster was born on Feb. 3, 1947, in Newark, the elder of two\nchildren of Samuel and Queenie (Bogat) Auster. His father was a landlord who\nowned buildings in Jersey City with his brothers.\n\nPaul grew up in South Orange, N.J., and later nearby Maplewood, but his home\nwas not a happy one, he wrote. His parents\u2019 marriage was strained, and his\nrelationship with his father remote. \u201cIt was not that I felt he disliked me,\u201d\nMr. Auster wrote in \u201cThe Invention of Solitude.\u201d \u201cIt was just that he seemed\ndistracted, unable to look in my direction.\u201d\n\nHe took refuge in baseball, a lifelong passion, as well as books. \u201cWhen I was\n9 or 10,\u201d he told The Times in 2017, \u201cmy grandmother gave me a six-volume\ncollection of books by Robert Louis Stevenson, which inspired me to start\nwriting stories that began with scintillating sentences like this one: \u2018In the\nyear of our Lord 1751, I found myself staggering around blindly in a raging\nsnowstorm, trying to make my way back to my ancestral home.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Columbia High School in Maplewood, he enrolled in\nColumbia University, where he participated in the student uprising of 1968 and\nmet his first wife, the writer Lydia Davis, who was a student at Barnard.\n\nImage\n\nMr. Auster in 1987 as his writing career was beginning to blossom.\nCredit...Ulf Andersen/Getty Images\n\nAfter receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in comparative literature 1969, followed\nby a master\u2019s in the same subject, he did a stint working on an oil tanker\nbefore moving to Paris. There he scraped together rent money by translating\nFrench literature while starting to publish his own work in literary journals.\n\nHe published his first book, a collection of translations called \u201cA Little\nAnthology of Surrealist Poems,\u201d in 1972. In 1974, he returned to New York City\nand married Ms. Davis. He was soon trying such ventures as marketing a\nbaseball card game he invented before his writing career began to blossom in\nthe 1980s.\n\nAlong with success over the years came critical barbs. James Wood of The New\nYorker used a 2009 review of Mr. Auster\u2019s book \u201cInvisible\u201d to parody the\ntough-guy talk, violent accidents and \u201cB-movie atmosphere\u201d that Mr. Wood\nperceived in Auster novels. \u201cAlthough there are things to admire in Auster\u2019s\nfiction,\u201d Mr. Wood concluded, \u201cthe prose is never one of them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2017, Vulture published a tart appraisal of his work with the headline\n\u201cWhat happened to Paul Auster? A decade ago he was a Nobel candidate.\u201d\nDismissing his novel as fodder for college-age neophytes, Christian Lorentzen,\nthe article\u2019s author, described Mr. Auster\u2019s work as a \u201cgateway drug to\nstronger stuff \u2014 Beckett, DeLillo, Auster\u2019s own ex-wife Lydia Davis.\u201d\n\nBy that point, Mr. Auster had largely stopped reading reviews, arguing that\neven the positive reviews often miss the point. \u201cNo good can come of it,\u201d he\nsaid in the interview in The Independent. \u201cI spare my fragile soul.\u201d\n\nFor a writer whose work was filled with themes of pain and loss, far greater\npain would come his way.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, his son Daniel Auster, 44, died following a drug\noverdose 11 days after being charged in the death of his 10-month-old\ndaughter, Ruby. In a deposition, Daniel said he had shot heroin before taking\na nap with his daughter and, upon waking up, found her dead from what was\ndetermined to be acute intoxication of heroin and fentanyl.\n\nHis father issued no comment on the death.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Mr. Auster is survived by his daughter, Sophie\nAuster; his sister, Janet Auster, and a grandson, Miles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr. Auster remained prolific, publishing several books in recent years,\nincluding \u201cBurning Boy: The Life and Work of Stephen Crane\u201d (2021) and\n\u201cBloodbath Nation\u201d (2023), a chilling meditation on American gun violence.

But it is also a novel that reflects the inner struggles of an\nauthor in his later years dealing with age and grief.\n\n\u201cAt its heart, \u2018Baumgartner\u2019 is about warring states of mind,\u201d Ms. Maazel\nwrote. \u201cOur hero is a philosophy professor (for clarity I\u2019ll call him Sy, as\nhis friends do) who lost his wife nearly 10 years ago in a freak accident and\nhas been caught between hanging on and letting go \u2014 or even pushing away \u2014\never since.\u201d\n\nDespite his long and productive career, Mr. Auster at times expressed\nirritation that much of his career had been assessed in relation to \u201cThe New\nYork Trilogy,\u201d his breakout work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency among journalists to regard the work that puts you in the\npublic eye for the first time as your best work,\u201d he said in \u201cA Life in\nWords.\u201d \u201cTake Lou Reed.
