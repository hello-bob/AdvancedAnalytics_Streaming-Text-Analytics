It had just been\ndecreed that food-delivery people could not be allowed to roam the residence\nhalls after 8:00 p.m., thus germinating the long and rich tradition of\ndeciding who has to abandon the party for the lobby and keep a lookout for the\npizza. This, of course, was established in the interest of security, which\nmeant that anyone who had gone to the trouble of acquiring a bag full of subs\nand a hat reading \"Joey's Pizzamania\" for the purpose of molesting or\nassaulting someone in the building would find his choice of victims limited to\nthe bored, hungry souls loitering in the lobby.So, I asked myself: What would\nhappen if the rule-makers' worst fears were realized? How would they\noverreact? Thus was born what seemed to be a ludicrous premise... at the\ntime.You can see where this is going. Especially if you remember the first\nWorld Trade Center bombing (the one that didn't bring it down) and how the\n\"security\" business boomed directly afterward. This story was three years\nbefore then. After that, Tim McVeigh showed us it wasn't even necessary to get\ninside a building to blow it up, but it still produced another flurry of sales\nof cameras, key-cards and front-desk guards. Today, we're pretty sure the\nproblem is that we're not confiscating enough nail clippers.If there's one\nthing a bureaucracy can do, it's locking the barn door after the cow has burnt\ndown. Yet, even in such paranoid times, it would take a lot to disabuse people\nof the idea that crime only happens at night. Most of the post facto\nprecautions depicted are self-explanatory, if somewhat sloppily drawn, but\nallow me to shed some light on the whole fence thing. At the time, the plans\nhad just gotten underway for replacing the useless Phelps building in the\nmiddle of campus with a great big muddy hole. The first step was to fence off\nthe site of the proposed hole, and anything else it might be fun to fence off.\nThe erecting of the fence itself was more complicated than one might imagine,\nfor this is what we witnessed: The poles went in. Weeks passed. The poles were\nremoved and left to lie beside the post holes they had occupied. More weeks\npassed. The poles were put back exactly where they had been. Apparently, they\nmust have been installed incorrectly the first time, perhaps the wrong way up.\nNobody could think of a better explanation.Decker Dining Hall was a singular\nphenomenon. It was a caricature of the quintessential bad cafeteria, in that\nthe things said only in jest about most cafeterias were actually true of\nDecker. Wood Food Services, who was the sole supplier of all meal facilities\non the TSC campus, claimed that there was no difference between the dining\nhalls, because it supplied the same food to each of them. This was a fallacy\nthat ignored such factors as preparation, service, selection, and refrigerated\nstorage. Since the dining halls were officially identical, it was deemed\nunnecessary to allow students to choose between them. The dormitory in which\nyou lived determined where you ate. A resident of a dorm linked to the Decker\nmeal plan did not have the option of switching to the more sanitary and\ndiversified (but pricier) Travers/Wolfe meal plan unless he could conclusively\nprove that Decker served nothing that would not kill him. A number succeeded\nin this, largely due to the fact that the \"spaghetti sauce\" used in nearly\nevery dish of Decker's limited menu was actually clam sauce dyed red\n(information that was given only on a need-to-know basis, i.e. when a\nparticularly allergic person would return from the hospital feeling\ninquisitive). So, the idea that Decker pizza would have a chemical composition\ndistinctly different from real pizza is not as far-fetched as it might\nsound.Perhaps this isn't such a satisfying conclusion as it would be if you\nhad been eating Decker food all year.This was the first defining moment of the\ncharacter of Jay Raven.We weren't sure at the time exactly what was going on\nat the Phelps Construction Site (no one had even heard the name Community\nCommons yet), but we were sure that whatever it was, it didn't justify the\nconquest of separate territories. Many small, isolated chunks of land became\nsatellites of the construction area proper, for no other apparent reason than\nto use up the leftover fence. Now that they knew which way up the poles went,\nthe fence guys were unstoppable. Every day, more trees would find themselves\nimprisoned, even the celebrated evergreen at the center of the Allen Circle.\nThe news photograph at left (with the anonymous question taped to the fence)\nis an image burned into some students' minds as indelibly as the eerie visage\nof President Eickhoff, or the oft-photographed statue of the Lion of Trenton\nState College crushing the Serpent of Knowledge.Note for people squinting at\nthe screen: The book Biff is reading is \"Dreams and What They Mean.\"Bonus note\nfor people who have never been to college: The advertising brochures for any\ninstitution of higher education always have at least one photo of someone\nreading under a tree. Nobody ever really does this at college.\"Fight the\nFinal!\" was the rallying cry of the mass of students and faculty that gathered\nat the steps of Green Hall. The administration had decided, in order to give\nthe college a more Ivy-like image, that every class must base 30% to 60% of\nits grade on a final exam. Any professor with progressive teaching methods not\nrooted in short-term memory evaluation would have to do away with them. The\nstudent body wasn't going to take this; the privilege of attempting to\ngraduate from a more \"competitive\" school wasn't worth the frustration of\nknowing that a semester's worth of work and learning was worth less than one\nweekend of cramming. So, the whole campus converged on the administration\nbuilding to make some noise. In the end, no amount of noise was good enough.\nGreen Hall always had a talent for ignoring people, and the challenge of\nignoring them all at the same time was easily met. The new policy was set in\nstone, and the wiser members of the faculty, secure in the knowledge that they\nwere being ignored, subtly neglected to implement it.Notes: \"The Green Farm\nHouse\" is a landmark ruin on the outskirts of campus, far away from anyone.\nThe person delivering the pizza is not Jay or Biff or anyone we know. Really.\n\"Peter\" was the Senior Vice President who, a few years later, allegedly paid\nfor his own swimming pool with tuition money, among other misappropriations of\nfunds, and got away with it. Very few people protested; we had learned our\nlesson.If this worked, I'd be doing it.That's right, comic-strip crossovers\nweren't invented on the web. The Adventures of Mike was another feature that\nstepped in to fill the Signal's comic void early on. I got to know Elena in\nclass, and we decided it would be fun to have the two worlds cross paths.For\nthose who missed it, the plot of Mike was running thus: Mike was continually\nencountering snags in his attempts to even merely speak to this particular\ngirl with which he was smitten. The characters of Absurd Notions only play a\nsort of cameo role, but it started an excellent tradition: Every prominent and\ntalented Signal cartoonist in the years to come would collaborate with me at\nthe end of the academic year to produce a crossover of some sort.Alas, The\nAdventures of Mike were not resumed the following year. If you are still\nanxious to know the outcome of Mike's story, here is an epilogue for you. Mike\nfinally did get to meet Elise, and they hit it off just great. The two of them\nlater decided to run off together and become Bob Ross groupies, following the\nTV landscape artist on tours all over North America. Jude, Mike's roommate,\njoined the cast of BeatleManiaMania.  \n---  \n  \nArchived Classics by Semester: F1989 S1990 F1990 S1991 F1991 S1992 F1992 S1993\n\nAll content of this site is Copyright \u00a9 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996,\n1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 Kevin Pease.
