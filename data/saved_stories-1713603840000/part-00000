lately\n\nPublished Fri, Apr 19 202412:26 PM EDTUpdated 31 Min Ago\n\nJeff Cox@jeff.cox.7528@JeffCoxCNBCcom\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Most of the past several weeks have shown that first-time claims for unemployment benefits haven't fluctuated at all \u2014 as in zero.\n  * A string of weekly reports showing exactly 212,000 initial claims has raised a few eyebrows on Wall Street.\n  * A Labor Department spokesperson noted that while the string of 212,000 prints on the jobless claims data is \"uncommon,\" it can be attributed to a consistent jobs picture reflected in seasonal adjustments to the data.\n\nA \"Now Hiring\" sign is displayed on a shopfront on October 21, 2022 in New\nYork City.\n\nLeonardo Munoz | View Press | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nCalling the state of the U.S. jobs market these days stable seems like an\nunderstatement considering the latest data coming out of the Labor Department.\n\nThat's because most of the past several weeks have shown that first-time\nclaims for unemployment benefits haven't fluctuated at all \u2014 as in zero.\n\nFor five of the past six weeks, the level of initial jobless filings totaled\nexactly 212,000. Given a labor force that is 168 million strong, achieving\nsuch stasis seems at least unusual if not uncanny, yet that is what the\nfigures released each Thursday morning since mid-March have shown.\n\nThe consistency has raised a few eyebrows on Wall Street. The only week that\nvaried was March 30, with 222,000.\n\n\"How is this statistically possible? Five of the last six weeks, the exact\nsame number,\" market veteran Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research, posted\nThursday on X.\n\n\"Initial claims for unemployment insurance are state programs, with 50 state\nrules, hundreds of offices, and 50 websites to file. Weather, seasonality,\nholidays, and economic vibrations drive the number of people filing claims\nfrom week to week,\" he added. \"Yet this measure is so stable that it does not\nvary by even 1,000 applications a week.\"\n\nOthers chimed in as well.\n\n\"Numbers made up,\" one participant on the thread opined, while another said,\n\"Someone's cooking the books.\"\n\nHowever, others offered more analytical thoughts, attributing the uniformity\nin data to seasonal adjustments. Tracey Ryniec, a strategist at Zacks\nInvestment Research, suggested: \"You can go look at each state Jim. Those vary\ngreatly.\"\n\nIndeed, a Labor Department spokesperson noted that while the string of 212,000\nprints on the jobless claims data is \"uncommon,\" it would not be considered\nanomalous.\n\nThe streak \"can be reasonably interpreted as an indication that there has been\nvery little volatility in initial claims over this period relative to\nhistorical patterns, and that the seasonal adjustment factors are effectively\nremoving seasonality from the aggregate figures reported by states,\" the\nofficial said.\n\nMoreover, claims not adjusted seasonally have shown substantial fluctuation\nduring the five-week period, registering readings of 202,722; 191,772;\n193,921; 197,349; 215,265 and 208,509.\n\nFederal Reserve officials watch the weekly claims numbers as part of their\nbroader assessment of the labor market, which has shown surprising resilience\nas the central bank has tightened monetary policy.\n\nThe Labor Department official also pointed out that new seasonal factors to\nthe claims data were announced a month ago.\n\n\"Using the new seasonal adjustment factors, initial claims have been at a\nfairly consistent level since around mid-September 2023 and even more so since\nthe start of February 2024,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Thursday's biggest analyst calls: Tesla, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, eBay, Zoom, JetBlue, BJ's & more\n  * If you're worried about a correction and over-invested in Nvidia, replace it with these steady growth stocks instead\n  * It may be time for investors to sell Nvidia on the next bounce, according to the charts\n  * Wall Street is bullish on copper, thanks to AI.
