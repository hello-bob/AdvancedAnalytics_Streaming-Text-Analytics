So, what\u2019s new in this upcoming release?\n\nKubernetes 1.30 brings a plethora of enhancements, including a blend of 58 new\nand improved features. From these, several are graduating to stable, including\nthe highly anticipated Container Resource Based Pod Autoscaling, which refines\nthe capabilities of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler by focusing on individual\ncontainer metrics. New alpha features are also making their debut, promising\nto revolutionize how resources are managed and allocated within clusters.\n\nWatch out for major changes such as the introduction of Structured Parameters\nfor Dynamic Resource Allocation, enhancing the previously introduced dynamic\nresource allocation with a more structured and understandable approach. This\nensures that Kubernetes components can make more informed decisions, reducing\ndependency on third-party drivers.\n\nFurther enhancing security, the support for User Namespaces in Pods moves to\nbeta, offering refined isolation and protection against vulnerabilities by\nsupporting user namespaces, allowing for customized UID/GID ranges that\nbolster pod security.\n\nThere are also numerous quality-of-life improvements that continue the trend\nof making Kubernetes more user-friendly and efficient, such as updates in pod\nresource management and network policies.\n\nWe are buzzing with excitement for this release! There\u2019s plenty to unpack\nhere, so let\u2019s dive deeper into what Kubernetes 1.30 has to offer.\n\n## Kubernetes 1.30 \u2013 Editor\u2019s pick\n\nThese are the features that look most exciting to us in this release:\n\n#2400 Memory Swap Support\n\nThis enhancement sees the most significant overhaul, improving system\nstability by modifying swap memory behavior on Linux nodes to better manage\nmemory usage and system performance. By optimizing how swap memory is handled,\nKubernetes can ensure smoother operation of applications under various load\nconditions, thereby reducing system crashes and enhancing overall reliability.\n\nNigel Douglas \u2013 Sr. Open Source Security Advocate (Falco Security)\n\n#3221 Structured Authorization Configuration\n\nThis enhancement also hits beta, streamlining the creation of authorization\nchains with enhanced capabilities like multiple webhooks and fine-grained\ncontrol over request validation, all configured through a structured file. By\nallowing for complex configurations and precise authorization mechanisms, this\nfeature significantly enhances security and administrative efficiency, making\nit easier for administrators to enforce policy compliance across the cluster.\n\nMike Coleman \u2013 Staff Developer Advocate \u2013 Open Source Ecosystem\n\n#3488 CEL for Admission Control\n\nThe integration of Common Expression Language (CEL) for admission control\nintroduces a dynamic method to enforce complex, fine-grained policies directly\nthrough the Kubernetes API, enhancing both security and governance\ncapabilities. This improvement enables administrators to craft policies that\nare not only more nuanced but also responsive to the evolving needs of their\ndeployments, thereby ensuring that security measures keep pace with changes\nwithout requiring extensive manual updates.\n\nThomas Labarussias \u2013 Sr. Developer Advocate & CNCF Ambassador\n\n## Apps in Kubernetes 1.30\n\n#4443 More granular failure reason for Job PodFailurePolicy\n\nStage: Net New to Alpha Feature group: sig-apps\n\nThe current approach of assigning a general \u201cPodFailurePolicy\u201d reason to a\nJob\u2019s failure condition could be enhanced for specificity. One way to achieve\nthis is by adding a customizable Reason field to the PodFailurePolicyRule,\nallowing for distinct, machine-readable reasons for each rule trigger, subject\nto character limitations. This method, preferred for its clarity, would enable\nhigher-level APIs utilizing Jobs to respond more precisely to failures,\nparticularly by associating them with specific container exit code.\n\n#3017 PodHealthyPolicy for PodDisruptionBudget\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-apps\n\nPod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) are utilized for two main reasons: to maintain\navailability by limiting voluntary disruptions and to prevent data loss by\navoiding eviction until critical data replication is complete. However, the\ncurrent PDB system has limitations. It sometimes prevents eviction of\nunhealthy pods, which can impede node draining and auto-scaling.\n\nAdditionally, the use of PDBs for data safety is not entirely reliable and\ncould be considered a misuse of the API. Despite these issues, the dependency\non PDBs for data protection is significant enough that any changes to PDBs\nmust continue to support this requirement, as Kubernetes does not offer\nalternative solutions for this use case. The goals are to refine PDBs to avoid\nblocking evictions due to unhealthy pods and to preserve their role in\nensuring data safety.\n\n#3998 Job Success/completion policy\n\nStage: Net New to Alpha Feature group: sig-apps\n\nThis Kubernetes 1.30 enhancement offers an extension to the Job API,\nspecifically for Indexed Jobs, allowing them to be declared as successful\nbased on predefined conditions. This change addresses the need in certain\nbatch workloads, like those using MPI or PyTorch, where success is determined\nby the completion of specific \u201cleader\u201d indexes rather than all indexes.\n\nCurrently, a job is only marked as complete if every index succeeds, which is\nlimiting for some applications. By introducing a success policy, which is\nalready implemented in third-party frameworks like the Kubeflow Training\nOperator, Flux Operator, and JobSet, Kubernetes aims to provide more\nflexibility. This enhancement would enable the system to terminate any\nremaining pods once the job meets the criteria specified by the success\npolicy.\n\n## CLI in Kubernetes 1.30\n\n#4292 Custom profile in kubectl debug\n\nStage: Net New to Alpha Feature group: sig-cli\n\nThis merged enhancement adds the \u2013custom flag in kubectl debug to let the user\ncustomize its debug resources. The enhancement of the \u2018kubectl debug\u2019 feature\nis set to significantly improve security posture for operations teams.\n\nHistorically, the absence of a shell in base images posed a challenge for\nreal-time debugging, which discouraged some teams from using these secure,\nminimalistic containers. Now, with the ability to attach data volumes within a\ndebug container, end-users are enabled to perform in-depth analysis and\ntroubleshooting without compromising on security.\n\nThis capability promises to make the use of shell-less base images more\nappealing by simplifying the debugging process.\n\n#2590 Add subresource support to kubectl\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-cli\n\nThe proposal introduces a new \u2013subresource=[subresource-name] flag for the\nkubectl commands get, patch, edit, and replace.\n\nThis enhancement will enable users to access and modify status and scale\nsubresources for all compatible API resources, including both built-in\nresources and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). The output for status\nsubresources will be displayed in a formatted table similar to the main\nresource.\n\nThis feature follows the same API conventions as full resources, allowing\nexpected reconciliation behaviors by controllers. However, if the flag is used\non a resource without the specified subresource, a \u2018NotFound\u2019 error message\nwill be returned.\n\n#3895 Interactive flag added to kubectl delete command\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-cli\n\nThis proposal suggests introducing an interactive mode for the kubectl delete\ncommand to enhance safety measures for cluster administrators against\naccidental deletions of critical resources.\n\nThe kubectl delete command is powerful and permanent, presenting risks of\nunintended consequences from errors such as mistyping or hasty decisions. To\naddress the potential for such mishaps without altering the default behavior\ndue to backward compatibility concerns, the proposal recommends a new\ninteractive (-i) flag.\n\nThis flag would prompt users for confirmation before executing the deletion,\nproviding an additional layer of protection and decision-making opportunity to\nprevent accidental removal of essential resources.\n\n## Instrumentation\n\n#647 API Server tracing\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-instrumentation\n\nThis Kubernetes 1.30 enhancement aims to improve debugging through enhanced\ntracing in the API Server, utilizing OpenTelemetry libraries for structured,\ndetailed trace data. It seeks to facilitate easier analysis by enabling\ndistributed tracing, which allows for comprehensive insight into requests and\ncontext propagation.\n\nThe proposal outlines goals to generate and export trace data for requests,\nalongside propagating context between incoming and outgoing requests, thus\nenhancing debugging capabilities and enabling plugins like admission webhooks\nto contribute to trace data for a fuller understanding of request paths.\n\n#2305 Metric cardinality enforcement\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-instrumentation\n\nThis enhancement addresses the issue of unbounded metric dimensions causing\nmemory problems in instrumented components by introducing a dynamic, runtime-\nconfigurable allowlist for metric label values.\n\nHistorically, the Kubernetes community has dealt with problematic metrics\nthrough various inconsistent approaches, including deleting offending labels\nor metrics entirely, or defining a retrospective set of acceptable values.\nThese fixes are manual, labor-intensive, and time-consuming, lacking a\nstandardized solution.\n\nThis enhancement aims to remedy this by allowing metric dimensions to be bound\nto a predefined set of values independently of code releases, streamlining the\nprocess and preventing memory leaks without necessitating immediate binary\nreleases.\n\n#3077 Contextual Logging\n\nStage: Graduating to Beta Feature group: sig-instrumentation\n\nThis contextual logging proposal introduces a shift from using a global logger\nto passing a logr.Logger instance through functions, either via a\ncontext.Context or directly, leveraging the benefits of structured logging.\nThis method allows callers to enrich log messages with key/value pairs,\nspecify names indicating the logging component or operation, and adjust\nverbosity to control the volume of logs generated by the callee.\n\nThe key advantage is that this is achieved without needing to feed extra\ninformation to the callee, as the necessary details are encapsulated within\nthe logger instance itself.\n\nFurthermore, it liberates third-party components utilizing Kubernetes packages\nlike client-go from being tethered to the klog logging framework, enabling\nthem to adopt any logr.Logger implementation and configure it to their\npreferences. For unit testing, this model facilitates isolating log output per\ntest case, enhancing traceability and analysis.\n\nThe primary goal is to eliminate klog\u2019s direct API calls and its mandatory\nadoption across packages, empowering function callers with logging control,\nand minimally impacting public APIs while providing guidance and tools for\nintegrating logging into unit tests.\n\n## Network in Kubernetes 1.30\n\n#3458 Remove transient node predicates from KCCM\u2019s service controller\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-network\n\nTo mitigate hasty disconnection of services and to minimize the load on cloud\nproviders\u2019 APIs, a new proposal suggests a change in how the Kubernetes cloud\ncontroller manager (KCCM) interacts with load balancer node sets.\n\nThis enhancement aims to discontinue the practice of immediate node removal\nwhen nodes temporarily lose readiness or are being terminated. Instead, by\nintroducing the StableLoadBalancerNodeSet feature gate, it would promote a\nsmoother transition by enabling connection draining, allowing applications to\nbenefit from graceful shutdowns and reducing unnecessary load balancer re-\nsyncs. This change is aimed at enhancing application reliability without\noverburdening cloud provider systems.\n\n#3836 Ingress Connectivity Reliability Improvement for Kube-Proxy\n\nStage: Graduating to Beta Feature group: sig-network\n\nThis Kubernetes 1.30 enhancement introduces modifications to the Kubernetes\ncloud controller manager\u2019s service controller, specifically targeting the\nhealth checks (HC) used by load balancers. These changes aim to improve how\nthese checks interact with kube-proxy, the service proxy managed by\nKubernetes. There are three main improvements:\n\n1) Enabling kube-proxy to support connection draining on terminating nodes by\nfailing its health checks when nodes are marked for deletion, particularly\nuseful during cluster downsizing scenarios;\n\n2) Introducing a new /livez health check path in kube-proxy that maintains\ntraditional health check semantics, allowing uninterrupted service during node\nterminations;\n\n3) Advocating for standardized health check procedures across cloud providers\nthrough a comprehensive guide on Kubernetes\u2019 official website.\n\nThese updates seek to ensure graceful shutdowns of services and improve\noverall cloud provider integration with Kubernetes clusters, particularly for\nservices routed through nodes marked for termination.\n\n#1860 Make Kubernetes aware of the LoadBalancer behavior\n\nStage: Graduating to Beta Feature group: sig-network\n\nThis enhancement is a modification to the kube-proxy configurations for\nhandling External IPs of LoadBalancer Services. Currently, kube-proxy\nimplementations, including ipvs and iptables, automatically bind External IPs\nto each node for optimal traffic routing directly to services, bypassing the\nload balancer. This process, while beneficial in some scenarios, poses\nproblems for certain cloud providers like Scaleway and Tencent Cloud, where\nsuch binding disrupts inbound traffic from the load balancer, particularly\nhealth checks.\n\nAdditionally, features like TLS termination and the PROXY protocol implemented\nat the load balancer level are bypassed, leading to protocol errors. The\nenhancement suggests making this binding behavior configurable at the cloud\ncontroller level, allowing cloud providers to disable or adjust this default\nsetting to better suit their infrastructure and service features, addressing\nthese issues and potentially offering a more robust solution than current\nworkarounds.\n\n## Kubernetes 1.30 Nodes\n\n#3960 Introducing Sleep Action for PreStop Hook\n\nStage: Graduating to Beta Feature group: sig-node\n\nThis Kubernetes 1.30 enhancement introduces a \u2018sleep\u2019 action for the PreStop\nlifecycle hook, offering a simpler, native option for managing container\nshutdowns.\n\nInstead of relying on scripts or custom solutions for delaying termination,\ncontainers could use this built-in sleep to gracefully wrap up operations,\neasing transitions in load balancing, and allowing external systems to adjust,\nthereby boosting Kubernetes applications\u2019 reliability and uptime.\n\n#2400 Node Memory Swap Support\n\nStage: Major Change to Beta Feature group: sig-node\n\nThe enhancement integrates swap memory support into Kubernetes, addressing two\nkey user groups: node administrators for performance tuning and application\ndevelopers requiring swap for their apps.\n\nThe focus is to facilitate controlled swap use on a node level, with the\nkubelet enabling Kubernetes workloads to utilize swap space under specific\nconfigurations. The ultimate goal is to enhance Linux node operation with\nswap, allowing administrators to determine swap usage for workloads, initially\nnot permitting individual workloads to set their own swap limits.\n\n#24 AppArmor Support\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-node\n\nAdding AppArmor support to Kubernetes marks a significant enhancement in the\nsecurity posture of containerized workloads. AppArmor is a Linux kernel module\nthat allows system admins to restrict certain capabilities of a program using\nprofiles attached to specific applications or containers. By integrating\nAppArmor into Kubernetes, developers can now define security policies directly\nwithin an app config.\n\nThe initial implementation of this feature would allow for specifying an\nAppArmor profile within the Kubernetes API for individual containers or entire\npods. This profile, once defined, would be enforced by the container runtime,\nensuring that the container\u2019s actions are restricted according to the rules\ndefined in the profile. This capability is crucial for running secure and\nconfined applications in a multi-tenant environment, where a compromised\ncontainer could potentially affect other workloads or the underlying host.\n\n## Scheduling\n\n#3633 Introduce MatchLabelKeys to Pod Affinity and Pod Anti Affinity\n\nStage: Graduating to Beta Feature group: sig-scheduling\n\nThis Kubernetes 1.30 enhancement introduces MatchLabelKeys for PodAffinityTerm\nto refine PodAffinity and PodAntiAffinity, enabling more precise control over\nPod placements during scenarios like rolling upgrades.\n\nBy allowing users to specify the scope for evaluating Pod co-existence, it\naddresses scheduling challenges that arise when new and old Pod versions are\npresent simultaneously, particularly in saturated or idle clusters. This\nenhancement aims to improve scheduling effectiveness and cluster resource\nutilization.\n\n#3902 Decouple TaintManager from NodeLifecycleController\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-scheduling\n\nThis enhancement separated the NodeLifecycleController duties into two\ndistinct controllers. Currently, the NodeLifecycleController is responsible\nfor both marking unhealthy nodes with NoExecute taints and evicting pods from\nthese tainted nodes.\n\nThe proposal introduces a dedicated TaintEvictionController specifically for\nmanaging the eviction of pods based on NoExecute taints, while the\nNodeLifecycleController will continue to focus on applying taints to unhealthy\nnodes. This separation aims to streamline the codebase, allowing for more\nstraightforward enhancements and the potential development of custom eviction\nstrategies.\n\nThe motivation behind this change is to untangle the intertwined\nfunctionalities, thus improving the system\u2019s maintainability and flexibility\nin handling node health and pod eviction processes.\n\n#3838 Mutable Pod scheduling directives when gated\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-scheduling\n\nThe enhancement introduced in #3521, PodSchedulingReadiness, aimed at\nempowering external resource controllers \u2013 like extended schedulers or dynamic\nquota managers \u2013 to determine the optimal timing for a pod\u2019s eligibility for\nscheduling by the kube-scheduler.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the current enhancement seeks to extend the\nflexibility by allowing mutability in a pod\u2019s scheduling directives,\nspecifically node selector and node affinity, under the condition that such\nupdates further restrict the pod\u2019s scheduling options. This capability enables\nexternal resource controllers to not just decide the timing of schedulin,g but\nalso to influence the specific placement of the pod within the cluster.\n\nThis approach fosters a new pattern in Kubernetes scheduling, encouraging the\ndevelopment of lightweight, feature-specific schedulers that complement the\ncore functionality of the kube-scheduler without the need for maintaining\ncustom scheduler binaries. This pattern is particularly advantageous for\nfeatures that can be implemented without the need for custom scheduler\nplugins, offering a streamlined way to enhance scheduling capabilities within\nKubernetes ecosystems.\n\n## Kubernetes 1.30 storage\n\n#3141 Prevent unauthorized volume mode conversion during volume restore\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-storage\n\nThis enhancement addresses a potential security gap in Kubernetes\u2019\nVolumeSnapshot feature by introducing safeguards against unauthorized changes\nin volume mode during the creation of a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) from a\nVolumeSnapshot.\n\nIt outlines a mechanism to ensure that the original volume mode of the PVC is\npreserved, preventing exploitation through kernel vulnerabilities, while\naccommodating legitimate backup and restore processes that may require volume\nmode conversion for efficiency. This approach aims to enhance security without\nimpeding valid backup and restore workflows.\n\n#1710 Speed up recursive SELinux label change\n\nStage: Net New to Beta Feature group: sig-storage\n\nThis enhancement details improvements to SELinux integration with Kubernetes,\nfocusing on enhancing security measures for containers running on Linux\nsystems with SELinux in enforcing mode. The proposal outlined how SELinux\nprevents escaped container users from accessing host OS resources or other\ncontainers by assigning unique SELinux contexts to each container and labeling\nvolume contents accordingly.\n\nThe proposal also seeks to refine how Kubernetes handles SELinux contexts,\noffering the option to either set these manually via PodSpec or allow the\ncontainer runtime to automatically assign them. Key advancements include the\nability to mount volumes with specific SELinux contexts using the -o context=\noption during the first mount to ensure the correct security labeling, as well\nas recognizing which volume plugins support SELinux.\n\nThe motivation behind these changes includes enhancing performance by avoiding\nextensive file relabeling, preventing space issues on nearly full volumes, and\nincreasing security, especially for read-only and shared volumes. This\napproach aims to streamline SELinux policy enforcement across Kubernetes\ndeployments, particularly in securing containerized environments against\npotential security breaches like CVE-2021-25741.\n\n#3756 Robust VolumeManager reconstruction after kubelet restart\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-storage\n\nThis enhancement addresses the issues with kubelet\u2019s handling of mounted\nvolumes after a restart, where it currently loses track of volumes for running\nPods and attempts to reconstruct this state from the API server and the host\nOS \u2013 a process known to be flawed.\n\nIt proposes a reworking of this process, essentially a substantial bugfix that\nimpacts significant portions of kubelet\u2019s functionality. Due to the scope of\nthese changes, they will be implemented behind a feature gate, allowing users\nto revert to the old system if necessary. This initiative builds on the\nfoundations laid in KEP 1790, which previously went alpha in v1.26.\n\nThe modifications aim to enhance how kubelet, during startup, can better\nunderstand how volumes were previously mounted and assess whether any changes\nare needed. Additionally, it seeks to address issues like those documented in\nbug #105536, where volumes fail to be properly cleaned up after a kubelet\nrestart, thus improving the overall robustness of volume management and\ncleanup.\n\n## Other enhancements\n\n#1610 Container Resource based Pod Autoscaling\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-autoscaling\n\nThis enhancement outlines enhancements to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler\u2019s\n(HPA) functionality, specifically allowing it to scale resources based on the\nusage metrics of individual containers within a pod. Currently, HPA aggregates\nresource consumption across all containers, which may not be ideal for complex\nworkloads with containers whose resource usage does not uniformly scale.\n\nWith the proposed changes, HPA would have the capability to scale more\nprecisely by assessing the resource demands of each container separately.\n\n#2799 Reduction of Secret-based Service Account Tokens\n\nStage: Graduating to Stable Feature group: sig-auth\n\nThis improvement outlines measures to minimize the reliance on less secure,\nsecret-based service account tokens following the general availability of\nBoundServiceAccountTokenVolume in Kubernetes 1.22. With this feature, service\naccount tokens are acquired via the TokenRequest API and stored in a projected\nvolume, making the automatic generation of secret-based tokens unnecessary.\n\nThis aims to cease the auto-generation of these tokens and remove any that are\nunused, while still preserving tokens explicitly requested by users. The\nsuggested approach includes modifying the service account control loop to\nprevent automatic token creation, promoting the use of the TokenRequest API or\nmanually created tokens, and implementing a purge process for unused auto-\ngenerated tokens.\n\n#4008 CRD Validation Ratcheting\n\nStage: Graduating to Beta Feature group: sig-api-machinery\n\nThis proposal focuses on improving the usability of Kubernetes by advocating\nfor the \u201cshift left\u201d of validation logic, moving it from controllers to the\nfrontend when possible. Currently, the process of modifying validation for\nunchanged fields in a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is cumbersome, often\nrequiring version increments even for minor validation changes. This\ncomplexity hinders the adoption of advanced validation features by both CRD\nauthors and Kubernetes developers, as the risk of disrupting user workflows is\nhigh. Such restrictions not only degrade user experience but also impede the\nprogression of Kubernetes itself.\n\nFor instance, KEP-3937 suggests introducing declarative validation with new\nformat types, which could disrupt existing workflows. The goals of this\nenhancement are to eliminate the barriers that prevent CRD authors and\nKubernetes from both broadening and tightening value validations without\ncausing significant disruptions. The proposal aimed to automate these\nenhancements for all CRDs in clusters where the feature is enabled,\nmaintaining performance with minimal overhead and ensuring correctness by\npreventing invalid values according to the known schema.\n\nIf you liked this, you might want to check out our previous \u2018What\u2019s new in\nKubernetes\u2019 editions:\n\n  * Kubernetes 1.27 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.26 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.25 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.24 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.23 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.22 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.21 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.20 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.19 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.18 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.17 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.16 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.15 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.14 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.13 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n  * Kubernetes 1.12 \u2013 What\u2019s new?\n\nGet involved with the Kubernetes project:\n\n  * Visit the project homepage.\n  * Check out the Kubernetes project on GitHub.\n  * Get involved with the Kubernetes community.\n  * Meet the maintainers on the Kubernetes Slack.\n  * Follow @KubernetesIO on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you enjoy keeping up to date with the Kubernetes ecosystem, subscribe\nto our container newsletter, a monthly email with the coolest stuff happening\nin the cloud-native ecosystem.\n\nSubscribe and get the latest updates\n\nThank You For Signing Up!\n\nThis form failed to load.\n\nAn ad blocking extension or strict tracking protection is preventing this form\nfrom loading.
