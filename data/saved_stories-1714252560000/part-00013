The\nplants, known for their religious associations and medicinal properties, were\ndiscovered beneath a plaza floor upon which a ballcourt was built.\n\nResearchers said the ancient Maya likely made a ceremonial offering during the\nballcourt\u2019s construction.\n\n\u201cWhen they erected a new building, they asked the goodwill of the gods to\nprotect the people inhabiting it,\u201d UC Professor David Lentz said. \u201cSome people\ncall it an \u2018ensouling ritual,\u2019 to get a blessing from and appease the gods.\u201d\n\nThe study was published in the journal PLOS One.\n\nUC Professor David Lentz holds up a sculpture that bears reproductions of\nancient Maya glyphs.

New tools that can identify\nenvironmental DNA are helping them unlock secrets about how the ancient Maya\nmight have used these spaces.\n\nResearchers from 2016 to 2022 worked at Yaxnohcah in Campeche about 9 miles\nnorth of the border of Guatemala, where they excavated a small area of a\nballcourt.\n\nThe ancient Maya played several ball games, including pok-a-tok, which was a\nmix of soccer and basketball. Players tried to get a ball through a ring or\nhoop on a wall.\n\n\u201cBut not all of the ballcourts had hoops,\u201d Lentz said. \u201cWe think of ballcourts\ntoday as a place of entertainment. It wasn\u2019t that way for the ancient Maya.\u201d\n\n> Ballcourts occupied prime real estate in the ceremonial center. They were a\n> fundamental part of the city.\n\nDavid Lentz, UC College of Arts and Sciences\n\nHe referenced a famous Mayan myth of hero twins who must play a ballgame with\nthe gods to escape the underworld. And researchers believe in some instances,\ncompetitors were sacrificed at the conclusion of the match.\n\nIn some ancient Maya cities like Tikal in Guatemala, ballcourts were built\nprominently next to the biggest temples.\n\n\u201cBallcourts occupied prime real estate in the ceremonial center,\u201d Lentz said.\n\u201cThey were a fundamental part of the city.\u201d\n\nMany construction projects today are subject to ceremony, from groundbreaking\nto the placement of the last steel beam to the ribbon-cutting. The ancient\nMaya, too, were deliberate about their construction ceremonies as well.\n\n\u201cThe nearest analogy today might be like christening a new ship,\u201d Lentz said.\n\nUC Professor David Lentz and his research partners used environmental DNA to\nidentify evidence of plants of ceremonial significance buried beneath an\nancient Maya ballcourt in Mexico.

Here, in a place known as the Helena complex, researchers\nbelieve stood a civic ceremonial platform consisting of 1-meter-high stone and\nearth.\n\nThe site started out as a humble residential structure built on bedrock,\nDunning said. These community founder sites grew into places enshrined by\nmonumental architecture, he said.\n\n\u201cOver time, important family members were buried within the expanding\nplatforms, imbuing these places with power. The Maya practiced ancestor\nworship,\u201d Dunning said.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, structures like the Helena Group were thought to be alive or to\nhave souls that needed to be nourished,\u201d he said.\n\nDunning said when buildings were expanded or repurposed, as with the\nballcourt, the ancient Maya made offerings to bless the site. Archaeologists\nsometimes find ceramics or jewelry in these offerings along with plants of\ncultural significance.\n\n\u201cWe have known for years from ethnohistorical sources that the Maya also used\nperishable materials in these offerings, but it is almost impossible to find\nthem archaeologically, which is what makes this discovery using eDNA so\nextraordinary,\u201d Dunning said.\n\nA decorative ring made from carved stone is embedded in the wall of a\nballcourt in the ancient Maya city of Chichen Itza.

But using environmental DNA, researchers were able to\nidentify several types known for their ritual significance.\n\n\u201cAncient DNA sequencing is amazing,\u201d said Alison Weiss, a study co-author and\nprofessor emerita with the UC College of Medicine.\n\nUC researchers used a product called RNAlater to preserve the samples during\ntransit back to the labs. Special probes that are sensitive to species found\nin that region helped them single out the fragmented DNA of several species,\nshe said.\n\nThey discovered evidence of plants associated with ancient Maya medicine used\nin divination rituals.\n\nA type of morning glory called xtabentun is known for its hallucinogenic\nproperties. Today, people brew mead from the honey of bees that feed on the\npollen of xtabentun flowers.\n\nChili peppers today are a favorite spice around the world. But for the ancient\nMaya, chili peppers were used to treat a variety of illnesses. An offering of\nchili peppers might have been intended to ward off disease, Lentz said.\n\n\u201cWe think of chili as a spice. But it was much more than that for the ancient\nMaya,\u201d Lentz said. \u201cIt was a healing plant used in many ceremonies.\u201d\n\nResearchers also identified the tree Hampea trilobata or jool. The leaves of\nthis tree were used to wrap food bundles for Maya ceremonies. The ancient Maya\nalso wove food baskets from twine made from the tree\u2019s bark. And it was used\nin medicines to treat snake bites.\n\nLastly, researchers found evidence of the plant lancewood or Oxandra\nlanceolata. Its oily leaves are a known vasodilator, anesthetic and antibiotic\nagent.\n\n> I think the fact that these four plants, which have a known cultural\n> importance to the Maya, were found in a concentrated sample tells us it was\n> an intentional and purposeful collection under this platform.\n\nEric Tepe, UC College of Arts and Sciences\n\nBotanist and UC Associate Professor Eric Tepe said finding evidence of these\nplants together in the same tiny sediment sample is telling. He has studied\nmodern plants in the same forests once traveled by the ancient Maya.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that these four plants, which have a known cultural\nimportance to the Maya, were found in a concentrated sample tells us it was an\nintentional and purposeful collection under this platform,\u201d Tepe said.\n\nResearchers for years have identified the diets and uses of plants among\nancient cultures by studying trapped pollen, preserved charcoal and ancient\nrefuse piles. Now environmental DNA holds the promise of helping researchers\nlearn even more about ancient civilizations, Tepe said.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this tool becomes more common. You gain insights\nyou wouldn\u2019t learn any other way,\u201d he said.\n\nResearchers noted the challenge of trying to interpret a collection of plants\nthrough the opaque lens of 2,000 years of prehistory. But Lentz said the\nfindings help add to the story of this sophisticated culture.\n\nResearchers believe the ancient Maya devised water filtration systems and\nemployed conservation-minded forestry practices. But they were helpless\nagainst yearslong droughts and also are believed to have deforested vast\ntracts for agriculture.\n\n\u201cWe see the yin and yang of human existence in the ancient Maya,\u201d Lentz said.\n\u201cTo me that\u2019s why they\u2019re so fascinating.\u201d\n\nFeatured image at top: A painting on a serving vessel depicts ancient Maya in\ncostume playing a game with a ball.

The\nplants, known for their religious associations and medicinal properties, were\ndiscovered beneath a plaza floor upon which a ballcourt was built, suggesting\nthe building might have been blessed or consecrated during construction.\n\n2\n\n### Did the ancient Maya have parks?\n\nJune 22, 2021\n\nResearchers at the University of Cincinnati say Tikal\u2019s reservoirs \u2014 critical\nsources of city drinking water \u2014 were lined with trees and wild vegetation\nthat would have provided scenic natural beauty in the heart of the ancient\nMaya city. UC developed a novel system to analyze ancient plant DNA in the\nsediment of Tikal\u2019s temple and palace reservoirs to identify more than 30\nspecies of trees, grasses, vines and flowering plants that lived along its\nbanks more than 1,000 years ago. Their findings painted a picture of a lush,\nwild oasis.\n\n3\n\n### Ancient Maya used sustainable farming, forestry for millennia\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati researchers found evidence of sustainable agriculture\nand forestry spanning a millennia in one ancient Mayan city.\n\nGet personalized content from UC News\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati 2600 Clifton Ave. Cincinnati, OH 45220 513-556-0000\n\n## UC Tools\n\n  * Canopy & Canvas\n  * Enrollment Services\n  * Email\n  * Catalyst\n  * Bearcat Portal\n  * Shuttle Tracker\n  * IT Help\n  * UC VPN\n  * Bearcats Landing\n\n## About Us\n\n  * Maps & Directions\n  * Jobs\n  * News\n  * Diversity\n  * Governance & Policies\n  * Directory\n  * Events Calendar\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000\n\nAlerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Free Speech | Copyright Information\n\n\u00a9 2024 University of Cincinnati\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati 2600 Clifton Ave. Cincinnati, OH 45220 513-556-0000\n\n\u00a9 2024 University of Cincinnati\n\nRequest Info\n\n", "frontpage": false}
