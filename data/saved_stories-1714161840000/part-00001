And trying to get SSL.com\nto stop charging us and refunding us the money has been a nightmare over the\npast year. The UI on their site is so bad that I can\u2019t find anything and I am\nconstantly confused by all of the useless and cryptic information packed into\nevery single unreadable page.\n\nIn the end, I resorted to contacting customer support, who on the surface seem\nnice and helpful, but really all they do is refer matters to \u201cinternal teams\u201d\nwho never actually resolve any issues. This is nothing more than stonewalling.\n\nEventually they acknowledged that we are due a refund for $200+. But they were\nunable to refund the money because the credit card used for the original\ntransaction expired by the time SSL.com got its act together.\n\nThis entirely unforeseeable problem was, as you might guess, referred to an\ninternal team. Where it has been sitting for the past year now. Any attempts\nto get this to move along have resulted in nothing more but:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry for the inconvenience, we\u2019ve forwarded this to an internal team.\u201d\n\nJoy. I guess that $200 will never be recovered and I need to cut my losses\ndealing with evil corporations.\n\nSo, be warned: Do not do business with SSL.com and use the amazing Let\u2019s\nEncrypt service instead! If by some miracle, we get our money back, I\u2019ll\ndonate it to Let\u2019s Encrypt instead!\n\n### Related\n\nPicard 2.0.1 released!

Jaded Lover says:\n\nApril 26, 2024 at 06:18\n\nThey completely stole 300 or so dollars from me by double charging for\nwildcard SSLs that ended up not even working.\n\nThen also an absolutely insane roundabout between my pay processor and their\n\u201cinternal team\u201c, which proceeded to waste tons more of my time.\n\nAnd ultimately get absolutely no relief by way of getting the product to work\nproperly or getting my money back.\n\nSo to recap, double charged for one wildcard that did not even work in the\nend, and I had to re-install my hosts \u201cfree\u201c (not really, but meh) SSLs\nshortly after installing ssl.com wildcard anyway.\n\nIt had been a long time since I\u2019ve been taken for a sucker to this extent.\nDefinitely agree with this article do not use them.\n\n## Leave a comment\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
