An\namendment that would have required a warrant before conducting surveillance on\nAmericans failed on a 212-212 tie vote(new window) in the House of\nRepresentatives and a 58-34 vote(new window) in the Senate.\n\nSection 702 is just one way the US government can spy on people without a\nwarrant. It\u2019s important to understand how US surveillance laws work since so\nmany tech giants (and the data they collect) are subject to US law. Its\nrequirements shape the policies of Big Tech companies like Google, Apple,\nMeta, and Microsoft, and thus have an outsized impact on the internet.\n\nThis article examines some of the most important privacy legislation and law\nenforcement policies in the US and how they impact privacy online.\n\nThe FISA court The Section 702 loophole National security letters US\ngovernment spying via Big Tech Buying personal information Does this impact\nProton?\n\n## The FISA court\n\nBefore we can talk about Section 702, we must explain FISA and the FISA court.\n\nIn 1978, Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act(new window)\n(FISA), forbidding the CIA and NSA from operating within the US. It also\ncreated a special, secret court, known as the FISA court(new window) (or the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court or FISC), which reviews requests from\nthe federal government to conduct electronic surveillance on suspected\nterrorists and spies within the US.\n\nThere are several issues with the FISA court. First, it operates in almost\ncomplete secrecy(new window), issuing sealed court orders to companies that\npressure them to secretly disclose their users\u2019 information, such as the\ncontent and metadata of their messages and emails, or face legal consequences.\nCompanies that receive such an order cannot publicly acknowledge receiving it\nuntil six months have passed. And companies cannot share even redacted\nversions of the orders(new window) they receive. All this secrecy makes\neffective oversight difficult, if not impossible.\n\nThis secrecy also exacerbates the second issue, which is that critics claim\nthe FISA court is little more than a rubber stamp(new window) for the\ngovernment\u2019s surveillance program. Given that its role is to prevent\ngovernment overreach, you would expect the court to approach each request with\nskepticism. And yet, in 2022, it only rejected seven out of 354 requests. In\n2021, it rejected four of 456 requests. You can see the full statistics in the\ntable below.\n\nYear| Applications| Orders granted| Orders modified| Orders denied in part|\nApplications denied  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n2022| 354| 249| 87| 16| 7  \n2021| 456| 318| 113| 20| 4  \n  \nThe good news, relatively speaking, is that even though this appears to be\nmostly a rubber-stamping exercise, FISA requests have trended down over the\npast several years. Unfortunately, this might be because US government\nagencies like the FBI can much more easily weaponize Section 702 to spy on\nAmericans.\n\n## The Section 702 warrantless wiretap loophole\n\nIn 2008, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act(new window), which includes\nSection 702. While the FISA court has its issues, most FISA requests are at\nleast considered individually by a judge. However, Section 702 requests, which\nare a type of FISA request, are simply approved in batches, meaning the\nfederal agencies don\u2019t need to present the case for specific requests(new\nwindow).\n\nSection 702 gives the US government the ability to monitor foreign nationals\nlocated outside the United States without a warrant; however, a \u201cbackdoor\u201d\npermits warrantless surveillance to be extended to people in the US as well.\nThe NSA (or some other three-letter agency) can simply name a foreign national\noutside the US as the nominal target. If that person speaks with a US citizen\nor someone in the US, those communications are swept up as well, even though\nsuch collection would normally require specific approval from the FISA court.\n\nSection 702 enables agencies like the NSA to perform warrantless wiretaps on\nhundreds of thousands of individuals each year. This data is then compiled\ninto one massive, searchable database. Unlike FISA court requests, the number\nof Section 702 requests are massive, as seen below. (All tables below are\nbased on the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s 2023 Annual Statistical\nTransparency Report(new window).)\n\nSection 702 targets\n\n2015| 2016| 2017| 2018| 2019| 2020| 2021| 2022  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n94,368| 106,469| 129,080| 164,770| 204,968| 202,723| 232,432| 246,073  \n  \nGiven the prevalence of Section 702 surveillance, this ends up illegally\ncapturing the communications of thousands of US citizens each year. The FBI\u2019s\nuse of this database shows an agency using this database to conduct mass\nsurveillance without a warrant. The FBI accessed millions of communication\nrecords of US citizens and people living in the US, including protesters(new\nwindow), political donors(new window), and even a member of US Congress(new\nwindow).\n\nNumber of US person query terms (phone numbers, email addresses, etc.) the FBI\nused on Section 702 data, including content data and metadata\n\nDec. 2019 \u2013 Nov. 2020| Dec. 2020 \u2013 Nov. 2021| Dec. 2021 \u2013 Nov. 2022  \n---|---|---  \n852,894| 2,964,643| 119,383  \n  \nAs this shows, Section 702 has essentially given the US government the legal\nability to access any communications it wants. The government used Section 702\nto establish PRISM(new window), one of the mass surveillance programs exposed\nby Snowden, and force companies like Yahoo! to participate(new window). It\ncontinues to use Section 702 to send legal requests to US-based tech companies\n(Google, Meta, Apple, etc.) to harvest their users\u2019 data.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the abuses, the US Congress has not only repeatedly\nreauthorized Section 702, but it has now given spy agencies even more power.\nUnder the latest reauthorization, traditional communications providers like\nISPs and email companies could still be forced to participate \u2014 in addition to\nanyone with physical access to a target\u2019s communications infrastructure. That\nlist could include landlords, restaurants that offer WiFi, hotels, and more.\nEvery public router you\u2019ve ever used could be turned into an NSA listening\npost.\n\n## National security letters are another warrantless wiretap tool\n\nNational security letters (NSLs) allow the FBI to request data without ever\ngetting a warrant or submitting that request to judicial review. To pass the\nFBI\u2019s internal standard to issue an NSL, an FBI agent just has to attest that\nthe information it seeks is relevant to national security.\n\nNSLs also include gag orders, preventing the companies that receive them from\ndisclosing the request. Again, the secrecy surrounding NSLs makes oversight\ndifficult and almost ensures overreach. The FBI only allows 7% of reviewed\nNSLs to be made public, continuing an unnecessary veil of secrecy that all but\nensures their misuse. An FBI internal audit(new window) found over 1,000\nviolations where FBI agents received more information than they were legally\nallowed to. The FBI uses ambiguous language(new window) in their requests in\nan attempt to get companies to overshare rather than risk a protracted fight\nwith the Bureau.\n\nWhile less common than Section 702 requests, thousands of NSLs are sent to Big\nTech companies each year.\n\n## US government conducts spying via Big Tech\n\nIn many ways, the US government has effectively outsourced its surveillance to\nBig Tech companies and data brokers. Because of the fact that Big Tech\ncompanies are all American companies, they are subject to all the US laws\nmentioned above. Combined with the fact that all Big Tech companies have\nlarge-scale data harvesting as a critical part of their business models, the\nUS government has ready access to the largest mass surveillance system ever\ndevised. You can see how much data the US government requests from Big Tech\ncompanies and the tools it uses to do so by looking at Big Tech transparency\nreports.\n\nGoogle(new window), Meta(new window), and Apple(new window) have all broken\nout FISA requests and NSLs in their transparency reports. Because of the\nsecrecy surrounding these tools, they can only give broad ranges of how many\nof each request the company received (they can only provide a range of how\nmany accounts were affected and cannot disclose this information until at\nleast six months after the request was received). For simplicity\u2019s sake, the\ntable below shows the absolute minimum number of accounts that have been\naffected by surveillance. While this is likely an undercount, it still\nrepresents a massive invasion of privacy.\n\nCorporate-assisted surveillance in 2022\n\nFISA (non-content) requests| FISA content requests| NSLs  \n---|---|---  \nGoogle| 50,000| 200,000| 3,000  \nMeta| NA| 290,000| 500  \nApple| 74,000| 68,000| 1,004  \nNon-content requests refer to metadata. Content requests refer to access to\nactual messages, emails, and other communications.\n\nIn some cases, these companies push back on government overreach, but\nunfortunately the US legal system doesn\u2019t give these companies much of an\noption.\n\n## US agencies buy data to avoid seeking warrants\n\nThe proliferation of surveillance capitalism pioneered by Google and Facebook\nhas also led to the rise of data brokers, which store and sell all kinds of\nsensitive personal information, including location data. This massive amount\nof data available for sale means US government agencies no longer need to\nobtain warrants for data, when they can simply just buy it. Departments that\nhave been caught buying this information include the US Treasury(new window),\nNSA(new window), FBI(new window), Department of Homeland Security(new window),\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement(new window), and many others.\n\nMuch of this data would normally require a warrant to access under the Fourth\nAmendment, but data purchasing has become a billion dollar business that the\nfederal government actively participates in. And because these data brokers\ncompile their information from dozens of sources, they can be impossible to\navoid.\n\n## Does this impact Proton?\n\nProton is based in Switzerland(new window), which has a long history of\nneutrality; is located outside of US, EU, and NATO jurisdictions; and is not a\nmember of any binding intelligence-sharing agreements, such as the Five Eyes,\nNine Eyes, or Fourteen Eyes agreements(new window) or NATO intelligence\nprograms(new window). Proton\u2019s Swiss domicile means we are not subject to any\nof the US laws mentioned above in this article.\n\nWe believe this neutrality is important in ensuring that all users on Proton\nare protected, irrespective of any geopolitical considerations. Proton\u2019s use\nof end-to-end encryption(new window) also further ensures that Proton cannot\nbe used to spy on behalf of governments, as we ourselves don\u2019t have access to\nyour data.\n\nWe have also been actively strengthening privacy protections of the Swiss laws\nthat we are subject to. For example, in 2021, we won an important court\ncase(new window) that ruled that email services aren\u2019t telecom providers and\nthus aren\u2019t subject to their data retention requirements. Proton VPN(new\nwindow) is similarly shielded from logging obligations and cannot be forced to\nlog.\n\nIn the current legal environment, it\u2019s impossible for a US service provider to\noffer meaningful privacy guarantees. Companies in neutral jurisdictions such\nas Switzerland will always be able to offer greater privacy than an American\ntech firm.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth fighting for the right to privacy. If you\nlive in the US, you should challenge your representatives and senators to\nblock renewal of Section 702.
