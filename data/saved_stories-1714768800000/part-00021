Researchers\nbelieve the orangutan got hurt in a fight with another animal. It's not known\nwhether Rakus earlier treated other injuries.\n\nABC/wires\n\nPosted 12h ago12 hours agoFri 3 May 2024 at 12:31am\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\nMore on:\n\n  * Academic Research\n  * Animal Science\n  * Animals\n  * Indonesia\n  * Offbeat\n  * Sumatra\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * ### Bonza staff 'screaming and crying' after being told they won't be paid for April\n\n  * ### Missing surfers' burnt-out car found in Mexico\n\n  * ### Every year millions of Australians jet off overseas \u2014 so what happens if something goes wrong while a loved one is travelling?\n\n  * ### Prominent Gaza doctor dies in Israeli prison after four months of detention\n\n  * ### What's the unemployment rate in your region?
