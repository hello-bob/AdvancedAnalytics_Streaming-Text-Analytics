It\u2019s\nbrought us more technology than most of us would ever have guessed: from\ncamera phones, to baby formula, to LED lights, to Nike Air trainers.\nContinuing our series on futuristic food technologies, we next explore not Air\nMax but rather Air Proteins. Sounds far out, well it is a bit.\n\nBack in the 1960s NASA was looking into ways of feeding their astronauts on\nlong space missions where providing supplies for the entirety of the mission\npresented a significant, if not insurmountable challenge. By leveraging\nmicroorganisms known as Hydrogenotrophs (literally \u201ceats hydrogen\u201d) which have\na penchant for hydrogen but also Carbon Dioxide, the great minds at NASA came\nup with a solution. The very same gas we exhale and that is currently causing\nus some amount of bother on Earth, can be fed to these microorganisms to\nproduce nutritious protein. While you might wonder \u201cwhy not simply grow\nvegetables on board the shuttle?\u201d well, the remarkable efficiency of\nHydrogenotrophs in transforming Carbon Dioxide into food far exceeds that of\ntraditional plants: mere hours compared to months before harvest.\n\nThanks for reading WeBeGreen!

In their own words:\n\u201cProtein production is a massively disproportionate squanderer of the Earth\u2019s\nresources. It\u2019s time to enter the era of sustainable food production to\nliberate our planet from the burdens of agriculture.\u201d.\n\nAnother is Air Protein. Led by Founder and CEO Lisa Dyson they plan to usher\nin \u201cthe Age of landless agriculture\u201d and build \u201ca sustainable relationship\nbetween our food and our planet.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re doing this through a bioprocess which can largely be described as\nfermentation. Hydrogenotrophic microbes, which naturally occur in nature and\nour gut, are selected, placed in a bioreactor and fed the nutrients they\nrequire to multiply and proliferate into their billions. The bioprocess\ninvolves an air capture device that draws Carbon dioxide and water from the\natmosphere. The water is then split into oxygen and hydrogen through\nelectrolysis. Ammonia, serving as a nitrogen source, and essential inorganic\nnutrients like phosphorus and calcium \u2014 which the air lacks \u2014 are added.\n\nAs the microorganisms proliferate, they create a thickening liquid slurry in\nthe bioreactor. This slurry is then continuously extracted and dried to\nproduce a powder; mainly whole microbial cells with a protein content of\napproximately 70%. Solar Foods calls it \u201cSolein\u201d. It contains all nine\nessential amino acids, iron, fibre and B vitamins while being completely free\nof GMOs, pesticides, herbicides, hormones, microplastics, heavy metals and\nantibiotics.\n\nThis protein powder can then be used in much the same way as flour to make\nbread or pasta. With traditional culinary techniques and some level of\ncreativity we can produce a range of foods such as meats and seafood, each\nwith differing flavours, tastes, textures, and nutritional attributes.\n\nWhat\u2019s really exciting is this technology has already been tried and tested.\nAir Protein created their first meat product \u201cAir Chicken\u201d back in 2019 and\nlater \u201cAir Scallop and Fish\u201d in 2021. Solein has been successfully tested in\nmultiple foods with different tastes and textures, ranging from alternative\nmeat to noodles to ice cream, in fact George Monbiot tastes a Solein pancake\nin his book Regenesis.\n\nSource: solarfoods.com\n\nAccording to Air Protein their technology could produce 10,000 times more food\nper land area than soybean crops. Calysta, another player in the field of air-\nbased proteins, is able to produce 100,000 tonnes per year of their protein\npowder on 10 hectares of developed land. Producing an equivalent quantity of\nsoy protein would require a quarter of a million hectares of arable land. The\nnumbers for Beef and lamb are even more mind-blowing. For 100,000 tonnes we\u2019d\nneed 16.36 million hectares and 18.48 million hectares respectively.\n\nSolar Foods can produce a 1kg of Solein with a fraction of the water, land and\nC02 needed for beef and just a few days ago made history by opening the\nworld's first commercial scale air protein facility who\u2019s \u201cbioreactor can make\nthe protein equivalent of a 300-cow dairy farm in a day without the\nenvironmental impact and demands of traditional agriculture.\u201d\n\nAs we can see, air-based proteins require only the space for the bioreactors\nto sit on but they can also create an essentially unlimited food supply\nwithout the destructive side effect of our agricultural system: the animal\nslaughter, without the slash-and-burn of forests, without the pesticides,\nwithout the greenhouse gases, without the antibiotics and without the\nfertiliser run-offs.\n\n###\n\nConclusion -\n\nGrowing our food has always depended on highly unpredictable factors: weather,\ngeography, politics, pests, global agriculture supply chain costs, limited\nnatural resources and manufacturing disruptions. This no longer has to be the\ncase.\n\nAlternative proteins and their subgroups: Cultivated Meat, Precision\nFermentation, Air-based proteins, Biomass Fermentation and Molecular Farming\noffer us a very real climate solution and an opportunity to feed us all\nwithout destroying our planet.\n\nBut the technology faces significant hurdles. Routes to commercialisation are\nnot always clear. For entrepreneurs, playing both the commercial game and the\ntechnological one whilst growing an industry still very much in its infancy is\nno small feat.\n\nInfrastructure bottlenecks are a very real challenge. The cost to set up a\ncommercial scale facility, known as a biofoundry, which through economies of\nscale will drive down costs and allow alternative proteins to reach price\nparity with the conventional products they are aiming to replace, is estimated\nat over $400 million. At a time when funding is most needed, rising interest\nrates, unrealistic timescales and bad publicity have scared off generalist\ninvestors. Governments should step up and lead the way to bridge the gap to\nprice parity by shifting subsidies from Meat and Dairy to Alternative\nProteins.\n\nConsumer acceptance is another hurdle. Detractors are working hard at\nlabelling these food products as \u201cFrankenfood\u201d, \u201cLab -grown\u201d, \u201cUnnatural\u201d and\nso on. However, surveys have repeatedly shown that the more consumers know\nabout the technology the more willing they are to consume its products. If\nRennet, Riboflavin and Insulin are anything to go by consumers don\u2019t appear to\neven be aware, let alone mind. Even so, food is deeply ingrained in culture.\nEducation combined with outreach is essential to overcome any reservations.\n\nThe Alt Protein industry is also aggressively targeted by animal agriculture\nlobbies, both in the US and in Europe, see here for a comical example. Florida\nrecently banned and criminalised the sale of cultivated meat whilst Italy\ninstituted a sale ban in November 2023. It may well be that a technology born\nin Europe is blocked at home by myopic governments and incumbent industry but\nflourishes in Asia, leaving us behind.\n\nAir proteins, and alternative proteins more generally, can be produced in self\ncontained, landless and decentralised farm systems, requiring much fewer\nresources thus ensuring predictable costs, self sufficiency, virtually no\ndisruptions and continuous operation in any climate.\n\nSolar is already the cheapest form of energy on the planet. Expanding capacity\nwill mean we can generate hyper-abundant renewable electricity at a quasi-zero\nmarginal cost which will inevitably power all future operations. The process\nthen becomes immensely Carbon negative since not only does it consume Carbon\nas a food source, it can also free up swathes of land for rewilding and\nreforesting. This is the real \u201cDirect Air Capture\u201d technology we should be\ntalking about.\n\nPhoto by Teemu Paananen on Unsplash\n\nAt a time when extreme climate events make food shortages alarmingly likely,\nwhen 1 billion of us go hungry, and more than 3 billion of us can\u2019t afford a\nhealthy diet, when deteriorating geopolitics lead to increased supply chain\ndisruptions and food insecurity, when animal agriculture mutates the Amazon\nfrom a Carbon sink to a Carbon emitter we should be raving and embracing these\ntechnologies not hamstringing them.\n\nShare WeBeGreen\n\nIf you share our vision for a sustainable food future and want to support\nthese innovative solutions to help convince policymakers and investors, we are\ngathering endorsements from individuals and organisations who believe in the\npotential of Alternative Proteins.
