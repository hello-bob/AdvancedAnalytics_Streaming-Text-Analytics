It involved the usual\nthings, trust exercises, team bonding, and personality profiles.\n\nI filled in a few forms, answered some questions, and the very professional\nlooking lady marked up my paper and said, \"I see that you're a Scorpio. That\nmeans you're focused externally, and you deal with things rationally and\nlogically. You do have a tendency to act via your intuition - sometimes to\nyour detriment.\"\n\nO...k..., I thought, that's a bit of a weird thing to bring up in a business\ncontext. Working for a high tech company, I thought we were supposed to use...\nI dunno... science rather than make-believe. I expressed these concerns to the\nwoman running the course.\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, looking through my results, \"I see that you're also Chinese\nYear of the Goat. That means you tend to value personal considerations above\nobjective criteria. So you often give more weight to social implications than\nto logic.\"\n\nI was left rattled and confused. How can my personality be so restricted and\ncodified by something as random as the time of my birth? Was there any\nresearch behind this, I ask?\n\n\"Oh yes!\" She confidently replied, \"Astrology has been practised for a long\ntime. And thousands of top companies use it to make important decisions about\nwho to hire and promote. By looking at the stars, your business can gain a\ncompetitive edge!\"\n\n...\n\nLet that sink in for a moment. Companies are assessing their workforce and\npromoting their rising stars based on the planetary alignment at the time of\ntheir birth.\n\nDoes that even sound plausible? What rational company would do that? Surely no\nresponsible person uses astrology to understand themselves or others.\n\nGentle reader, I am teasing you! The above conversation did happen but it\ndidn't involve the Zodiac; it involved Myers-Briggs.\n\nFor those who don't know, Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter, the mystery\nwriter Isabel Briggs Myers, invented the Myers-Briggs system during World War\nTwo. There was a growing need to place women in the workforce and, therefore,\nwomen needed to be assessed to see what sort of work they were suited to.\n\nThe pair undertook no scientific study, looked at no test results, and didn't\nconsult with any qualified psychiatrists, psychologists, or social scientists.\nWhich, considering that they held no qualifications in these fields, didn't\nbode well for the accuracy of their project.\n\nDespite claims that they based their system on the work of Carl Jung, he\nrejected the idea of simple stratification out of hand.\n\n> \"There is such a factor as introversion, there is such a factor as\n> extraversion. The classification of individuals means nothing, nothing at\n> all.\"\n>\n> Carl Jung - McGuire, William and R. F. C. Hull, eds., C. G. Jung Speaking\n> (Princeton University Press, 1977).\n\nToday, Myers-Briggs tests are taken by millions of people every year. This\nnets the private company which owns Myers-Briggs around $20 million per year.\n\nOh, yes, this isn't a scientific test in any sense. It is a programme\nspecifically designed to make money. If you want to take the test, you need to\npay. If you want to administer the test, you need to pay.\n\nWhenever scientists have attempted to study it, the results have been\noverwhelmingly negative. The most common complaint is that \"personality\ntraits\" are meant to be fixed - yet when people take the test repeatedly, they\noften find that their types change radically.\n\nMyers-Briggs is, to put it mildly, bullshit.\n\n## Magical Thinking\n\nPeople want a pill which will make them thin. A herb to make their hair glossy\nand their skin clear. One simple trick to make $$$ working from home. A mantra\nto chant which will just make everything better.\n\nWe have magical-thinking-syndrome. That if we just invoke certain\nincantations, and do a certain course, all our troubles will just vanish into\nthin air.\n\nCreating a team is hard work. Self improvement is hard work. Communicating\nwith others is hard work. Becoming part of a Cargo Cult is no substitute for\ndeeply examining yourself and your working environment - and then making\nchanges to both.\n\nYou can't simply shortcut it by find your secret, magic code.\n\nBut that's what we want, apparently. That's what sells. Perhaps businesses\nlove magical thinking like Myers-Briggs and NLP because they want to show that\nthey care but they don't want to do the hard work that will actually make\npositive changes to their working environments.\n\nPeople want to have a simple, foolproof method which will allow them to\novercome their difficulties. Myers-Briggs, NLP, Astrology, and sacrificing\nchickens will give us the illusion that we are doing something.\n\nBut then, I would say that; I'm a Scorpio.\n\n## Moderation Policy\n\nI welcome all comments and criticisms.

No\ndiscussion. Also the \"scientific\" value of MBTI - accepted.\n\nBut I see one place in business where MBTI still can have its value: each of\nthe four traits describes one area where differences in work style or\ncommunication style could lead to tensions.\n\nIf a new team is put together knowing the MBTI of the other people in the\npeople to prepare for what kind of tensions one can expect when working\ntogether and for each member it becomes easier to adapt oneself.\n\nIn this scenario it is not so important whether the MBTI tends to change over\ntime because what it important for this is how your *current* MBTI is.\n\nReply\n\n    1. 2012-12-24 13:47\n\n### Terence Eden says:\n\nThis is where I disagree. I honestly can't believe that people can reach\nworking age without realising that some people communicate / react\ndifferently.\n\nRemember, the MBTI is designed to be vague and positive - just because it says\nsomething about you, doesn't mean that's how you actually feel.\n\n\"Knowing\" the MBTI (which can change during the _day_ let alone years) is a\nshortcut, but no more so than saying \"How much detail do you want me to go in\nto?\" or \"Do you mind if the report is late?\"\n\nReply\n\n      1. 2012-12-24 14:07\n\n### Tom Morris (@tommorris) says:\n\nWell, never underestimate the need for autistic geeks to categorise humanity\nin order to understand humans.\n\nReply\n\n        1. 2012-12-26 23:44\n\n### Vicki says:\n\nThat's just nasty.

However, that's not to say there aren't\ngood psychological studies that back up at least some of the claims of the\nMBTI. For example:\n\nAn Assessment of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Carlyn, M., Journal of\nPersonality Assessment. Oct1977, Vol. 41 Issue 5, p461-74 (Conclusion: \"The\nIndicator appears to be a reasonably valid instrument which is potentially\nuseful for a variety of purposes\")\n\nand:\n\nRecent Assessments of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Carlson, J. G., Journal\nof Personality Assessment, Aug1985, Vol. 49 Issue 4, p356-66. (A meta-study of\n24 peer reviewed papers, Conclusion: \"The applications of the MBTI have been\nbroad, although somewhat unsystematic, and with generally favorable validity\nassessment. Continued attempts to validate the instrument in a variety of\nsettings are needed.\"\n\nHowever, I'm much more in sympathy with the arguments of psychologists like\nGraham Richards. The extract below is from \"Putting Psychology in it's place\n(2nd edition, 2002)\" -\n\n\"... not everything which can be measured necessarily exists. This may sound\npuzzling, but is actually not so self contradictory as it seems.\n\nThe argument is best made using a hypothetical example: were we living in the\nMiddle Ages we might be very concerned about how devout people were. To\nmeasure this we devise a questionnaire containing such items as \u2018I prefer\nreading a holy book to attending a tournament\u2019, \u2018A strange feeling of Grace\nsometimes descends upon me\u2019, \u2018I enjoy attending High Mass\u2019 or to\ncounterbalance the direction \u2018I often find sermons boring\u2019. (\u2018I have never\nbeen tempted by lust\u2019 could serve as a lie item.) It is surely feasible that\nat the end of the day our \u2018sanctity scale\u2019 would appear to provide a handy way\nof measuring how holy people were.\n\nBut no psychologist proposes that there is a measurable \u2018sanctity\u2019 dimension\nto personality, and not even the most devout psychologists have attempted to\ndevise such a measure. Nor is this as far fetched as you might imagine; among\nthe earliest pioneers of scientific measurement were the fourteenth century\nFrench scholars Jean Buridan and Nicolas D\u2019Oresme whose efforts were spurred\nby the desire to quantify the amount of Grace in communion wafers.\"\n\nReification is the curse of our times!\n\nTim.\n\nReply\n\n  5. 2012-12-24 14:25\n\n### Bill Gates says:\n\nSometimes in the real world canidates A,B and C all seem to be equal in almost\nall regards, at that point meyers-briggs could be used to disambiguate the\nselection perhaps with slightly better results then a die roll on a d20.\nPersonally, I have noticed making long-term selections repeatedly is extremely\nmentally, emotionally, and also feels very physically draining, saying I have\n100 to 300 selections to fill positions that need to be filled. Perhaps 20 to\n50 percent of the applicants for each pool are all about equally valid by\nnormal \"scientific\" criteria. How can I rest easier and sleep sounder at night\nand get criticized less for somewhat arbitrary choices that someone from upper\nmanagement might want to bring down upon my head?

I was at work when I wrote the\ncomment so it was just a very quick flick through the papers I had to hand.\n\nI can thoroughly recommend the Graham Richards book if you're interested in a\ncritical view on much of \"traditional\" experimental social psychology - I tend\nto produce it when anyone tries to convince me that social psychological\nmeasurements of any kind (e.g. personality, intelligence, attitudes and so on)\nare truly scientific. They're not - because it's very difficult, if not\nimpossible, to remove the researcher from psychological experiments.\n\nAs I say, I really must dust my own post off on this subject - and maybe I\nwill after I've eaten too much turkey during the next couple of days.\n\nTim.\n\nReply\n\n  7. 2012-12-24 15:13\n\n### Elias Tandel says:\n\nYou really got me thinking for a minute \"what's unscientific about natural\nlanguage processing?\".

Please. Read about the MBTI and understand what it is. Of course the\nMBTI was \"amazingly accurate\" in your case. You Told It What You Are Like.\n\nLibra claims to guess based on your birthdate. The MBTI asks you what you\nprefer. You choose your own label. The more you understand yourself, the\nbetter fit you get with the results.\n\nAlso: \" the other types don't even come close.

It's meant for personal growth and understanding.\nIt's meant to help you understand why and how other people are different.

Far easier for them to give the\ncandidate an MBTI and say \"INFP? We need INFPs!\" or \"ISTJ?

Let me repeat. The MBTI is correlated with valid\npersonality traits _By Definition_.\n\nReply\n\n  13. 2012-12-25 01:20\n\n### Tom Hubbard says:\n\nHow many times have you taken the MBTI? I've done it three or four times, and\nhave gotten three or four different results. There are several questions that\ncould go either way, depending on my mood at the time. Some days I'm in the\nmood for coffee, others I'd prefer tea.\n\nBesides, some of the questions are awfully hard to understand, like \"Are you\nmore ideational or more concuspective?\" or \"Do you get annoyed by mombocious\nbehavior?\". Even when I can actually understand the words, my answer is \"Could\ngo both ways\", or maybe \"It depends on the context\".\n\nTry taking the test a few times over a span of several years, and I strongly\nsuspect you'll find that your personality type changes as you mature. I know\nI'm not the same person I was the first time I took that test, back in the\nearly 90s.\n\nIf the MBTI is useful at all (and I think it's highly overrated and poorly\nwritten), it should be thought of as a snapshot of a particular hour in a\nperson's life, not an eternal portrait or sculpture.\n\nReply\n\n  14. 2012-12-26 23:28\n\n### Vicki says:\n\nThis essay is amusing, but 180 degrees wrong. The MBTI is nothing like\nAstrology. In fact, it is about as opposite to astrology as anything can be.\n\nAs you point out (correctly) Astrology uses an external aspect of your life -\nthe time and place of your birth - to make decisions about your personality.\nThe MBTI DOES NOT DO THIS.\n\nThe MBTI uses your personality - your actual preferences and choices and\nbehaviours - to help you understand (duh) your personality. Your preferences\nand choices and behaviours.\n\nAstrology is like saying \"because you have red hair, therefore you have a\nvolitile temper\". The MBTI says \"Because you prefer X, you prefer X. Because\nyou think like this, that means you think like this\".\n\nYes, your answers can change over time. Some people's do. Most people's _do\nnot_. It's also VERY important to look at the final profile because, for some\npeople (for some personality types \ud83d\ude42 the questions are more ambiguous. Yes,\nsome of us would prefer \"neither\" or \"both\" as a response.\n\nAs is often the case with learning abut yourself, you have to understand your\npersonality to truly understand your personality. The MBTI is a learning tool.\n\nIt's true that Katherine and Isabel didn't have psychological degrees.\nHowever, they did collect a LOT of data and the MBTI has been refined over the\nyears using DATA. (A lot of programmers don't have CmpSci degrees; shall we\ntell them they can't program?)\n\n> Creating a team is hard work. Self improvement is hard work. Communicating\n> with others is hard work. Becoming part of a Cargo Cult is no substitute for\n> deeply examining yourself and your working environment - and then making\n> changes to both.\n\n> You can't simply shortcut it by find your secret, magic code.\n\nAbsolutely true. Managers and HR teams should never use just one thing to\nbuild teams. Especially if they don;t truly understand how that thing works.\nPersonalities are as important as skill sets -- and just as unique. While\nthere are only 16 general MBTI type codes, there are (of course!) an infinite\nnumber of people. I don't exactly match every other INTJ (and the MBTI states\nthis if you read further).\n\nSo, you are correct that the MBTI is not a magic bullet. It isn't meant to be.\nIt's meant to be a means of understanding yourself and perhaps understanding\nhow to interact with other people -- to understand why some family members or\nco-workers, managers, peers, or subordinates seem so vary different. Using it\nin forming a team, without being TRAINED in how MBTI is just one small aspect\nof how people work, is as bad as interviewing and choosing employees based on\nwhat tree they would be or whether they can guess how M&Ms are made.\n\nSo, your general summary is correct. I just wish you'd done enough research\nbefore writing this to understand that your starting analogy is so offbase\nthat the rest of the article is undermined by that analogy.\n\nReply\n\n    1. 2012-12-27 11:08\n\n### Terence Eden says:\n\nHi Vicki,\n\nThanks for all you comments. I can see that you're heavily invested in MBTI,\nso I won't try to change your mind with my comments. I'd just like to point\nout a few things.\n\nThe first problem with MBTI is that the questions are extremely vague and can\noften be answered with \"it depends\". Jung's theories are meant to be used as\npart of a dialogue between patient and doctor, so that these can be fully\nexplored. MBTI relegates these ambiguities to simple yes/no responses.\n\nA question like \"You like to be engaged in an active and fast-paced job\"\nreally has a host of answers. \"It depends on the money.\" \"What is the rest of\nthe team like?\" \"Do I have a lot going on in my personal life?\"\n\nYou say that most people's MBTI don't change over time. Repeated studies have\nshown that they do. For example, the paper \u201cTest-Retest Reliabilities of the\nMyers-Briggs Type Indicator as a Function of Mood Changes.\u201d Research in\nPsychological Type, Vol. 2, No. 1 (1979), pp. 67-72, by Howes, R. J. and T. G.\nCarskadon.\n\nThere's no evidence to suggest that the inventors had lots of data when they\nwere creating the system. You're right that there has been lots more data\nadded - unfortunately, when assessed it always seems to come up short. See\nDruckman, D. and R. A. Bjork, Eds. In the Mind\u2019s Eye: Enhancing Human\nPerformance. Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1991 (a study undertaken\nby the US Army).\n\nI quite agree that you don't need a CompSci degree to do programming - but if\nyou don't understand O(n), regression, and sorting algorithms - you're likely\nto make some very basic mistakes. The MBTI inventors had no training in\npsychology or statistics - and that shows in their work.\n\nWe both agree that MBTI is often misused - especially by people with little\ntraining in it. Where we differ is that I don't believe that someone who has\npaid to become MBTI Qualified knows any much about human psychology than an\nastrologer.\n\nIf, as you say, MBTI types are fixed, then they are presumably fixed at birth.\nMuch like star signs.\n\nThanks\n\nTerence\n\nReply\n\n  15. 2012-12-30 21:03\n\n### Vicky Jo Varner says:\n\nYour perspective has merit and you make some excellent points. And certainly\nthe way some practitioners deploy the mbti does resemble astrology. The first\ntime my husband took the mbti was during an organizational change. The company\nhired a consultant to transition employees, and everyone took the \"test.\"\nAfterwards, my husband received a bad xerox of a personality type description\nin the mail, and had a brief conversation with the practitioner who basically\n\"rubber-stamped\" his result. Surprisingly, this irritated him so much that he\nwent on to learn more about it, and eventually became a practitioner himself.\nAnd what he (and I) have learned through the years is that there are (as\nusual) good practices and bad practices. A bad practice was just described,\nwhich feels alienating and even violative. Good practices look very different\n-- and are extremely difficult to practice!\n\nMany individuals get sidetracked is by looking intensely at the mbti and\nquestioning its validity. That's a red herring. We already know the instrument\nis observing \"straws in the wind\" and taking a wild guess at what someone's\npreferences are. The questions aren't really \"scientific,\" and frankly it's a\nlittle clunky in this era of Mars Rovers and iPhones. The most it can do is\nopen the door to a conversation about healthy differences among people.\n\nAnd here's where it gets interesting. If you think the mbti is the whole\npoint, you've missed the point. The mbti is merely a frontrunner for the work\nof C.G. Jung's \"Psychological Types.\" So the instrument may be flawed, but the\ntheory it's based on is brilliant. As Jungian Joseph Henderson observed, the\ntheory is possibly perfect, and we humans are dreadfully flawed in our\nunderstanding and applications of it. Accordingly, I don't care if you find\nflaws in the mbti; I'm interested in the theory behind it. For that\nconversation, there are three things you must be aware of before I can\ndiscourse intelligently with you: 1. Understand that the mbti's dichotomies\nare an arbitrary creation by Isabel Briggs-Myers. However, the true premise of\npsychological types are the eight functions of consciousness described by C.G.\nJung. Those are the true essentials of his model, and if you confuse them,\nyou've altogether missed the boat. (Very few people know this.) 2. Type was\nnever intended to categorize people -- it was intended to categorize\nconsciousness. Big difference! (How many categories of *consciousness* are you\nfamiliar with?) When you try to solve a math problem, you are in a Thinking\nconsciousness. When you propose to your partner, you are in a Feeling\nconsciousness. It is not good to confuse the two (and some people do!). 3.\nType is a moral problem. Someone who prefers Thinking will feel that those who\nprefer Feeling are *immoral*. These are not learned beliefs; they are innate\nin the individual. And with this point, I have turned the discussion toward an\nexploration of \"shadow\" -- one of Jung's most important concepts. In this way,\ntype opens up the conversation into Jung's entire work: the Collective\nUnconscious, complexes, archetypes -- the whole enchilada. So if you think\ntype is nothing more than the dichotomies of the mbti and a silly parlor game\nlike astrology, you have frankly missed the point. And I feel a little sorry\nfor you, because this conversation can be SOOO much richer.\n\nI'm currently enrolled in a Masters/PhD program at Pacifica Graduate Institute\nto deepen my own learning around type. I started as an ordinary mbti\npractitioner in 1996; I have achieved Master Practitioner (the highest level).\nHowever, I rarely administer the mbti -- instead, I take my clients through a\n*structured* type discovery process supplemented by coaching that helps them\nlearn Jung's work and truly get to know themselves. I don't employ any\nassessment for this work, because most of my clients have been MIS-typed by\nthe Indicator or by a free online test. So why bother? Accordingly, I can\nappreciate your criticism of the mbti.... AND I'm disappointed that you\nhaven't learned more about the theory that informs it. That's a topic my INTJ\nhusband and I will *never* tire of.\n\nReply\n\n  16. 2013-01-01 02:01\n\n### jenirae905 says:\n\nFirst off, let me say that it SUCKS that you had such a shitty experience with\nMyer-Briggs. The theory on which this tool was based is actually very rich and\nmulti-layered, but understanding it on this level takes TIME, and time is\nunfortunately something that these bastards in Corporate America do not have\nenough of.\n\nI can tell that whoever did the MBTI assessment that you experienced did not\nknow their ass from their elbow based on some of the incredibly inaccurate\ninformation you had taken away from this experience and incorporated into your\narticle. I will reply to some of these inaccuracies here: ***\n\n\"...thousands of top companies use it to make important decisions about who to\nhire and promote.\"\n\nFirst off, THIS IS AN UNETHICAL USE OF THE MBTI INSTRUMENT, and no one who\nknows their shit would ever use it in such a manner. Practitioners who are\ntrained properly are aware that this tool is not designed to be used for\nhiring prompting decisions. However, it IS a tool that can help direct people\ntoward jobs that best suit their own preferences for judging and perceiving. I\nwould put my money on it that Lehman Brothers was using the MBTI unethically.\n(Unethical business practices seem to come naturally to them.)\n\n\"Oh, yes, this isn't a scientific test in any sense...\"\n\nActually true... because as any certified MBTI practitioner will tell you, the\nMBTI is NOT A TEST. (Seriously-- if I only had a dime for every time I have\nhad to point this out to someone...) Tests imply right-or-wrong answers, and\nthat one result is in some way better or more desirable than another. The MBTI\nis an \"indicator\" - a tool that is designed to be used as a compass, for lack\nof a better word - to point you in a certain direction -- In the case of the\nMBTI, the direction of your psychological preferences for taking in\ninformation and making decisions.\n\n\"the most common complaint is that 'personality traits' are meant to be fixed\n- yet when people take the test repeatedly, they often find that their types\nchange radically.\"\n\nTrait measure and Type measure are two different things. MBTI is not a 'trait'\nmeasure - it does not measure the \"amount\" of, for instance, Introversion and\nExtraversion a person \"contains\"... that is not possible. The MBTI attempts to\nindicate whether one prefers the Extraverted orientation over the Introverted\norientation, or vice versa for all four dichotomies. (ie: \"dichotomy\" =\n\"forced-choice\". Trait measures are usually represented by scales, not 'either\nor' preferences.) And before you argue PCI measure on the MBTI, PCI is not\nintended to measure the amount of any given thing, PCI simply indicated the\nconfidence level of the indicator on a given dichotomy. The closer the PCI is\nto 100, the more 'confident' the indicator is that the result on that\ndichotomy is your true cognitive preference.)\n\n\"You can't simply shortcut it by find your secret, magic code.\"\n\nAnyone who has studied the MBTI knows that it is not any sort of 'magic code.'\nHowever, Corporate America often treats this indicator as the 'be-all and end-\nall' of solutions to the Great Team-building Question. Actually using the MBTI\nthe way it was intended to be used requires a solid understanding of the\nunderlying Jungian psychological theory (which, believe it or not, has NOTHING\nto do with 'Letters' or squares on a 'Type-Table.') Unfortunately, Corporate\nAmerica ALSO has very little TIME to execute Psychological Type theory\nproperly, and often resorts to MBTI \"dog and pony shows\" not quite unlike the\none you experienced. YES - the sad but true truth is that the most popular\npsychological inventory in the world is being trivialized daily by those too\ngoddamned lazy to take the time to learn it and use it properly.\n\nReply\n\n    1. 2013-01-01 12:53\n\n### Terence Eden says:\n\nIt's an interesting comment. I'm largely in agreement with you, up to your\nlast point \"being trivialized daily by those too goddamned lazy to take the\ntime to learn it and use it properly.\"\n\nI'm arguing that it can't be used properly. It is not a valid psychological\ntool. The scientific community is not divided in this matter - they are\nconvinced that the MBTI is, essentially, useless.\n\nIf you have any links or papers which show the validity of MB - please let us\nknow in the comments.\n\nReply\n\n  17. 2013-01-03 14:24\n\n### Helen Marriott says:\n\nIf they are doing that they are mis-using the MBTI.
