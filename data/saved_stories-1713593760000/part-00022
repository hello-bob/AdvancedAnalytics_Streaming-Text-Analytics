Exposure to per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been linked\nto cancers, impacts to the liver and heart, and immune and developmental\ndamage to infants and children. This final rule will designate two widely used\nPFAS chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid\n(PFOS), as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund,\nand will help ensure that polluters pay to clean up their contamination.\n\nThis final action will address PFOA and PFOS contamination by enabling\ninvestigation and cleanup of these harmful chemicals and ensuring that leaks,\nspills, and other releases are reported. This action builds on the recently\nfinalized standards to protect people and communities from PFAS contamination\nin drinking water and represents the latest step the Biden-Harris\nAdministration is taking to protect public health and welfare and the\nenvironment under EPA\u2019s PFAS Strategic Roadmap and to prevent cancer before it\nstarts through the Biden Cancer Moonshot.\n\nIn addition to the final rule, EPA is issuing a separate CERCLA enforcement\ndiscretion policy that makes clear that EPA will focus enforcement on parties\nwho significantly contributed to the release of PFAS chemicals into the\nenvironment, including parties that have manufactured PFAS or used PFAS in the\nmanufacturing process, federal facilities, and other industrial parties.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden understands the threat that \u201cforever chemicals\u201d pose to the\nhealth of families across the country. That\u2019s why EPA launched its PFAS\nStrategic Roadmap, a whole-of-agency approach to protecting public health and\naddressing the harm to communities overburdened by PFAS pollution,\u201d said EPA\nAdministrator Michael S. Regan. \u201cDesignating these chemicals under our\nSuperfund authority will allow EPA to address more contaminated sites, take\nearlier action, and expedite cleanups, all while ensuring polluters pay for\nthe costs to clean up pollution threatening the health of communities.\u201d\n\nEPA is taking this step to designate PFOA and PFOS under CERCLA because both\nchemicals meet the statutory criteria for designation as hazardous substances.\nUnder the rule, entities are required to immediately report releases of PFOA\nand PFOS that meet or exceed the reportable quantity of one pound within a\n24-hour period to the National Response Center, State, Tribal, and local\nemergency responders. The designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances\nunder CERCLA enables the agency to use one of its strongest enforcement tools\nto compel polluters to pay for or conduct investigations and cleanup, rather\nthan taxpayers. Designation is especially important as delay in addressing\ncontamination allows PFOA and PFOS more time to migrate in water and soil,\nworsening existing contamination.\n\nThe final rule also means that federal entities that transfer or sell their\nproperty must provide notice about the storage, release, or disposal of PFOA\nor PFOS on the property and guarantee that contamination has been cleaned up\nor, if needed, that additional cleanup will occur in the future. It will also\nlead the Department of Transportation to list and regulate these substances as\nhazardous materials under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long past time for the polluters who poisoned all of us to be held\nresponsible. This comes too late for all the people who were poisoned without\ntheir knowledge or consent and have paid the price for one of the greatest\nenvironmental crimes in history,\u201d said Ken Cook, President and co-founder of\nEnvironmental Working Group. \u201cBut today\u2019s designation of PFOA and PFOS as\nhazardous substances is the first step to bring justice to those who have been\nharmed. By putting the needs of the people ahead of the profits of the\npolluters, the Biden EPA is once again delivering for the American people.\u201d\n\nThis final action is based on significant scientific evidence that these\nsubstances, when released into the environment, may present a substantial\ndanger to public health or welfare or the environment. PFOA and PFOS can\naccumulate and persist in the human body for long periods of time, and\nevidence from scientific studies demonstrate that exposure to PFOA and PFOS is\nlinked to adverse health effects.\n\n\u201cThis is another important step by EPA to protect people and communities from\nharmful PFAS chemicals, including legacy PFAS contamination across the U.S.\nThe science is clear that PFAS chemicals are linked to a wide range of health\nharms including cancer, damage to cardiovascular and immune systems, poor\npregnancy outcomes, and effects on the developing child,\u201d said Dr. Tracey\nWoodruff, Professor & Director, Program on Reproductive Health & the\nEnvironment (PRHE)/Environmental Research and Translation for Health at the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco. \u201cBy listing PFOA and PFOS as\nhazardous substances under the Superfund Law, it means that these chemicals\nwill have to be cleaned up from hazardous waste sites and polluters must pay\nthe bill. This is great news for the many communities grappling with PFAS\ncontamination \u2013 many of which are also low income and communities of color.\nThis is another step toward protecting people from the health harms of this\nwell-known toxic chemical.\u201d\n\nEPA\u2019s Superfund program has worked effectively for more than 40 years to\ntarget and prioritize cleanups of the nation\u2019s most contaminated sites that\npresent unacceptable risks to human health and the environment. The Superfund\nprogram addresses more than 800 hazardous substances, including widespread,\nhighly mobile, and persistent chemicals, like PFOA and PFOS. The program also\npromotes safer industrial practices that enhance community protections by\nreducing the likelihood of future releases. Additionally, cleanups allow\ncommunities to put land back into productive use, providing opportunities for\njobs and economic growth.\n\nIn addition, EPA\u2019s enforcement policy, consistent with EPA\u2019s past practice\nover decades of implementing the law, will provide additional clarity on the\nagency\u2019s intent not to pursue certain parties such as farmers, municipal\nlandfills, water utilities, municipal airports, and local fire departments,\nwhere equitable factors do not support seeking CERCLA cleanup or costs. EPA\nhas a proven track record of developing and applying enforcement discretion\npolicies that are effective and well-received by stakeholders, ensuring\nentities that have contributed significant contamination are held accountable.\n\nBiden-Harris Administration Takes Critical Action to Protect Communities from\nPFAS\n\nIn addition to efforts across the government, EPA has taken action under the\nagency\u2019s PFAS Strategic Roadmap to control PFAS at its sources, hold polluters\naccountable, ensure science-based decision making, advance environmental\njustice, and address the impacts on disadvantaged communities. Since launching\nthe Roadmap in 2021, EPA has taken a suite of actions to protect communities\nfrom exposure to \u201cforever chemicals\u201d including:\n\n  * Established first-ever national legally enforceable drinking water standard for PFAS: In April 2024, EPA finalized National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) for six PFAS which will protect 100 million people from PFAS exposure, prevent tens of thousands of serious illnesses, and save lives. This action complements the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to combatting PFAS pollution and delivering clean water.\n  * Dedicated $9 billion in funding to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in drinking water: President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law secured the largest-ever investment in tackling PFAS pollution in drinking water. An additional $12 billion in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law supports general drinking water investments, including PFAS treatment. The investments are part of the Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities.\n  * Guidance on Destroying and Disposing of PFAS: EPA released updated Interim Guidance which outlines the best-available science on techniques and treatments that may be used to destroy or dispose of PFAS and PFAS-containing materials from non-consumer products, including aqueous film-forming foam for firefighting, and highlights innovation and emerging technologies that warrant further evaluation.\n  * Addressing on-going uses of PFAS: In January 2024 EPA finalized a rule that prevents companies from starting or resuming the manufacture or processing of 329 PFAS; released three methods to better measure PFAS in the environment; and announced the addition of seven PFAS to the list of chemicals covered by the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), consistent with the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nEPA will publish the Final Rule in the Federal Register shortly. The rule will\nbe effective 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register.\n\nRead more about the CERCLA final rule here.\n\nRead EPA\u2019s CERCLA Enforcement Discretion Policy here.\n\nRead more about EPA\u2019s strategy to address PFAS here.\n\nRead more about EPA\u2019s Superfund program here.\n\nRead more about the Superfund Enforcement Program here.\n\nContact Us to ask a question, provide feedback, or report a problem.\n\nLast updated on April 19, 2024\n\n## Discover.\n\n  * Accessibility Statement\n  * Budget & Performance\n  * Contracting\n  * EPA www Web Snapshot\n  * Grants\n  * No FEAR Act Data\n  * Plain Writing\n  * Privacy\n  * Privacy and Security Notice\n\n## Connect.\n\n  * Data\n  * Inspector General\n  * Jobs\n  * Newsroom\n  * Regulations.gov\n  * Subscribe\n  * USA.gov\n  * White House\n\n## Ask.\n\n  * Contact EPA\n  * EPA Disclaimers\n  * Hotlines\n  * FOIA Requests\n  * Frequent Questions\n\n## Follow.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
