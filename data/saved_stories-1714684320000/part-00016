It aims to ensure that admitting foreign workers into the country\ndoesn't impact US workers' job opportunities, wages, or working conditions.\nIt's often the first step toward a green card.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

Have an account? .\n\nAmazon said in the memo it had initially paused PERM applications in 2023 and\ndecided to keep these suspended until the end of this year after reviewing\n\"labor market conditions and immigrant requirements.\"\n\n\"It was determined that we are unable to continue with PERM filings through\n2024,\" the memo said. \"We know this is disappointing, and we did not take this\ndecision lightly.\"\n\n## Tech layoffs make green cards harder to get\n\nJennifer Gordon, an immigration and labor law professor at Fordham University,\nsaid the wave of job cuts across Amazon and other tech companies has made the\nPERM process more complicated.\n\nCompanies now have to demonstrate that laid-off employees are not qualified\nfor the jobs intended for foreign workers. They also have to notify people who\nwere laid off in the past six months about job openings before filing PERM\napplications for foreign workers.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"To get a PERM application approved, an employer needs to show that there is\nno qualified US worker interested in filling the position,\" Gordon told BI.\n\"Given how many layoffs there have been recently across the tech industry,\nit's become difficult for them to sustain that claim.\"\n\n## 'Alternative immigration pathways'\n\nIn an email to BI, an Amazon spokesperson said the company has \"temporarily\npaused\" its PERM program and is working with affected employees to find\n\"alternative immigration pathways\" to extend their stay in the US.\n\n\"Due to government requirements for the Green Card process, we have\ntemporarily paused our permanent labor certification program,\" the\nspokesperson wrote. \"We know this is difficult for affected employees, and\nwe're working hard to support them and find alternate immigration pathways as\nsoon as possible.\"\n\nIf Amazon can restart the program this year, it will do so, the spokesperson\nadded.\n\nIn the internal memo, Amazon told employees it will \"resume analyzing labor\nmarket conditions\" at the end of 2024 to potentially reactivate the PERM\nprogram next year. Google also paused new PERM applications last year, the\nObserver reported.\n\n## A soft labor market\n\nGordon said the fact that Amazon is pausing all new PERM applications through\nthe end of the year suggests the company is anticipating a soft labor market\nin the near term. The more saturated the labor market is with laid-off US\nworkers, the more difficult it is for companies to assert that a foreign\nemployee is better suited for the job.\n\n\"It could reflect Amazon's best guess about when the labor market will be less\nglutted with unemployed US workers,\" Gordon said.\n\nThe Amazon spokesperson told BI that the company \"remains optimistic\" about\nthe US labor market and its ability to \"one day file these applications\nagain.\"\n\nDo you work at Amazon?
