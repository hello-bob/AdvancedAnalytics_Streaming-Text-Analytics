He was also a head of the\nCatholic crusader order the Knights Hospitaller, the sister order of the\nbetter known Knights Templar favored in conspiracy theories. Franco himself\nheld a conspiracy about threes.\n\nFranco developed many of the conventions of modern music notation. Including\nthe terrible idea of adding a dot to a note to indicate that its duration is\nincreased by 50%. If a half note is two beats, then a dotted half note is\nthree beats. Franco called this \u201cperfecting\u201d the note, because holy things\nshould come in threes. The English formerly called this perfectly holy dot the\n\u201cprick of perfection,\u201d because they are a silly people.\n\n### Editions and Renditions\n\nI was thinking about all this because I am working on another edition of my\nsubversive inferential methods book, Statistical Rethinking. This will be the\nthird edition, the dotted half note of textbooks. So expectations are running\nhigh.\n\nThe first edition of the book focused on the core idea that statistical and\nmachine learning tools are blind and reckless golems. Without some mature\nphilosophy to guide us in building and applying them to well-defined\nquestions, we should expect trouble. The second edition built on this by\nemphasizing formal and transparent ways to connect qualitative theories to\nquantitative procedures and evidence.\n\nThe prick of perfection for the third edition is a stronger emphasis on\nworkflow. There has always been workflow in the book, gradually developed\nexamples with explicit decisions and justifications. But there is so much more\nto workflow in reality. And workflow is possibly the least theorized and\nsupported part of quantitative methods. It is essential, often invisible, and\nat the heart of contemporary controversies about the reliability and\nrepeatability and transparency of scientific claims.\n\n### How to Draw an Owl\n\nSome steps omitted\n\nThe goal is to take scientific data analysis at least as seriously as\nillustration. In the popular \u201chow to draw an owl\u201d meme (right), the joke is\nthat how-to guides often leave out the many intermediate steps needed in real\nprojects. These steps are not obvious and require their own technical study.\nDrawing a detailed owl needs scaffold lines, layering, blending, and erasing.\nProfessional illustrators study and refine these techniques as part of their\ncraft. It is not possible to reverse-engineer the process from the result.\n\nScientific data analysis is similar. It too contains many non-obvious steps,\nincluding intermediate analyses that are necessary scaffolds but are\ndiscarded. A successful analysis does not automatically document the steps\nrequired in its construction. Compared to illustration, there has not been\nmuch study and technical development of scientific workflow. Researchers\nreceive little explicit instruction. We must aspire to do better.\n\nAnd so we need texts that address workflow more explicitly. And this is a\ngrowing trend. Just one example, Rohan Alexander\u2019s recent and excellent\nTelling Stories with Data pays a lot of explicit attention to workflow. In my\ntext, I want to address workflow in a way that explicitly connects theory,\nincluding qualitative reasoning, to research design and statistical analysis\nand the interpretation of results. A lot of these ideas have arisen through\nconversation with and reading my colleagues Aki Vehtari and Andrew Gelman. But\ndon\u2019t blame them.\n\n### Work Must Flow\n\nA reliable workflow also requires quality insurance flows that overlay the\ncentral scientific flow, such as testing and diagnostics. And each component\nof the workflow may need its own internal workflow so it can be reliably\nconstructed. For example, a complex multilevel model should not be built all\nat once. Rather it should be logically broken down into layers which can be\nprogrammed and tested in turn. This both helps ensure the model functions as\nintended and often teaches us how the model works, because it allows us to\ncompare the different sub-models.\n\nThis is a lot. But I don\u2019t see a way for the components of research to have\nmeaning without the holism. For example, here is a partial workflow diagram\nfrom one of my 3rd edition draft chapters:\n\nWhat could be easier? Don\u2019t worry. In the text, I build this up in small\npieces. In early chapters, the core relations between estimands (research\nquestions) and estimators (statistical models) and estimates is emphasized.\nThen quality assurance using synthetic data simulation and validation is\nadded, at first only in simple examples. Then post-fit diagnostics like\nposterior predictive checks. Then prior predictive checks to help design\nestimators. Then more detailed design of estimands and their relationships to\nestimators. Then the use of estimates to construct question-appropriate\nsummaries, such as post-stratifications and marginal effects. Then model\ncomparison. And so on.\n\nIn any single example, most of the diagram above can be hidden, so one can\nfocus on the point of the example. That\u2019s the goal anyway.\n\nAnd on top of all of this, I want to write some support tools to track the\nworkflow and prompt researchers to add and document things like validation and\ndiagnostics, as well as explicit justifications for how the estimates relate\nto the estimands (research questions).\n\nThis means some software development. Mathematicians have some amazing\nsoftware support for proof workflow. See this blog post by Terry Tao. These\ntools help to decompose, track, and document the requirements for a proof and\nthe justifications for each step. Proofs, like data analysis projects, can be\nvery big. Tracking this complexity benefits from software supported workflow.\n\nA Lean4 + Blueprint proof tree diagram\n\nWe could learn a lot from them, in general terms. Data analyses are never\n\u201cproven\u201d. But there are still targets and chains of intermediate steps with\nlogical requirements for compatibility. There are still professional and\nethical obligations to be transparent about justifications that link, for\nexample, estimands to estimators. Probably half the published papers I read\nhave no clear estimand and no workflow for justifying an estimator other than\nconvention or rhetoric. This is unacceptable, in any context. But supporting\nresearchers and prompting them for these justifications could help.\n\nI want to build on existing tools while remaining interoperable with any\nstatistical packages a research wants to use. I mean yeah, you should all be\nusing bespoke Bayesian models. But I am Bayesian of the people. I meet the\nsinner where he dwells.\n\n### Timeline\n\nEverytime I mention the 3rd edition, people throw money at me and ask when it\nwill be published. The original idea was to have a draft ready for\nprofessional peer review in 2024. That would mean the book might go to press\nin 2025. Maybe that plan will still hold.\n\nBut I will not rush it. There is a lot to do, and I have a lot going on in my\nlife besides. Administration. Commissions. Reading and doing research.\nSupporting my colleagues with their research. Teaching. Protecting my\ncolleagues from structural and personal bullshit inside the academy.\n\nAnd last but absolutely the first priority, raising a teenage boy, mostly by\nmyself. I don\u2019t often talk about my personal life online. But I am constantly\nscheduling everything around my son and for my son. That includes book\nprojects. So I can\u2019t really make any hard promises on timelines for big\nprojects like this. And this is also why I keep turning down your\ntalk/conference invitations. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nAnyway please be patient. I serve the research revolution. I will put a dot on\nthis half note.\n\n### Notes\n\nSee this nice, whingeing video about music notation for more about Franco and\nother music notation reformers.\n\nCurious about workflow?
