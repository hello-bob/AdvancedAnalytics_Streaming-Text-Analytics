Something shared\non Dropbox (or whatever) is a good idea.\n\nThe run the bellow command to initialize your data file.\n\n    \n    \n    crm init-crm\n\nThis creates a file called crm.json.\n\nThe full list of commands supported by the tool is available by just entering\ncrm on the command line.\n\n    \n    \n    usage: crm COMMAND [filter] Available commands: - reports: i,interactions ... list of interactions. com,companies .... list of companies. con,contacts ..... list of contacts. a,apps ........... list of apps. about ............ all we know about a contact / company. f,followup ....... list of required follow-up. - data entry: add-company ............ register a new company. add-contact ............ register a new contact. add-app ................ register a new app. add-i,add-interaction .. register a new customer interaction. edit-company .............. edit an existing company. edit-contact .............. edit an existing contact. edit-app .................. edit an existing app. edit-i,edit-interaction ... edit an existing interaction. done ...................... remove follow-up date from interaction. - email: template FILE .......... fill in values for an email template. template-help .......... show the list of template fields. - system: init-crm ........ create data file in current directory.\n\n## Note on filters\n\nAll reports commands accepts a filter argument, used to restrict the data\ndisplay.\n\nThe filter is a fuzzy case-insensitive operator.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * crm about microsft will show all data you have about Microsoft.\n  * crm about marc twain will show all data you have about Marc Twain.\n\n## Best practices\n\n  * Put the crm.json file in version control.\n\n## Template emails\n\nHere is how I use the template feature.\n\nI create a file that contains the headers and body of an email (see\ntemplates/subscriber-followup.txt for an example)\n\nTo initiate an email to our newly subscribed customer (Microsoftware in this\nexample):\n\n    \n    \n    crm template tempates/fup-registration.txt Microsoftware > email.txt neomutt -H email.txt\n\nThis will open a Draft in mutt with all fields replaced.\n\nI guess not everyone uses neomutt, but it's easy to adjust to your need. You\ncan simply paste the output of the crm template command and compose your email\nfrom gmail or whatever.\n\n## Data format\n\ncrm.json contains JSON formatted data.\n\nThe root element is an array of Companies.\n\n#### Company\n\nA Company has the following attributes:\n\n  * name: string\n  * url: string\n  * address: string\n  * contacts: array of Contacts\n  * interactions: array of Interactions\n  * apps: array of Apps\n\n#### Contact\n\nA Contact has the following attributes:\n\n  * firstName: string\n  * lastName: string\n  * role: string\n  * email: string\n\nThe email field is considered a primary key. Should appear in only 1 Contact\nacross all Companies.\n\n#### Interaction\n\nAn Interaction has the following attributes:\n\n  * kind: string -- the type of interaction (email, github, automated, ...)\n  * date: string -- date of the interaction (anything javascript Date constructor can parse)\n  * from: string -- email address of the contact\n  * summary: string -- short summary of the interaction\n  * content: string (optional) -- full interaction\n  * followUpDate: string (optional) -- when a follow-up is due\n\n#### Apps\n\nAn App has the following attributes:\n\n  * appName\n  * plan\n  * email\n  * createdAt\n  * upgradedAt\n  * churnedAt\n\nApps is basically one of your products or subscription you're trying to\nsell... It's specific to my use case, if the tool is useful to others, we\nmight make the App concept a little more generic.\n\n## Interested by the idea?\n\nAm I launching a rock in the water by sharing this on github?
