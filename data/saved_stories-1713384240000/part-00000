Part of that is imposing limits\nupon the government\u2019s ability to collect and access them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s\ncritical to reform Section 702, the mass surveillance law that creates an end\nrun around our constitutional rights and a back door for the government to\nquery our communications. In the last few weeks, there have been multiple\nattempts to reauthorize this power with varying levels of reform and\ncompromise. Nearly half of the U.S. House of Representatives supported\nrequiring the government to obtain court approval before accessing Americans\u2019\ncommunications in the government\u2019s Section 702 databases\u2014but at the last\nminute, the pro-mass surveillance side passed a bill which actually expands,\nrather than reforms these powers. That\u2019s why we need you to tell the Senate to\nstop it!\n\nWhat happened: Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)\nis set to expire on April 19. The House of Representatives just passed the\nReforming Intelligence and Securing America Act (RISAA), a reauthorization\nbill that greatly increases the scope of information the government can\ncollect under Section 702 , and allows the government to use this\nunaccountable and out-of-control mass surveillance authority to spy on hopeful\nimmigrants and asylum seekers. This move abandons any real argument that this\nis for terrorism or intelligence only.\n\nThe U.S. Senate will likely try to advance this terrible bill this week \u2013 a\nbill that Sen. Ron Wyden called \u201cone of the most dramatic and terrifying\nexpansions of government surveillance authority in history.\u201d He\u2019s right.\n\nTell your Senators to vote NO on the Reforming Intelligence and Securing\nAmerica Act. Our call tool will make it easy for you to call your Senator\u2014it\nonly takes a moment.\n\nSection 702 allows the government to conduct surveillance of foreigners inside\nthe United States. While Section 702 prohibits the NSA and FBI from\nintentionally targeting Americans, these agencies routinely acquire innocent\nAmericans' communications \u201cincidentally\u201d. The government can then search\nAmercians\u2019 \u201cincidentally collected\u201d communications, all without a probable\ncause warrant.\n\nThe government has repeatedly abused Section 702 by searching its databases\nfor Americans\u2019 communications. In 2021 alone, the FBI reported conducting up\nto 3.4 million warrantless searches of Section 702 data using Americans\u2019\nidentifiers.\n\nThis loophole, and many other things, need to change before Congress acts to\nrenew Section 702.\n\n## Take Action\n\n## Calling you now\n\n### Before You Call\n\nThis action will guide you through calling your representatives.
