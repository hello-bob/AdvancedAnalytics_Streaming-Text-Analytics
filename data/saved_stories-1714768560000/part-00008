It\njust keeps multiplying as the capacity on these GPUs are rented out and tens\nof thousands of enterprises are trying to get GPU clock cycles to train their\nown models and, it is hoped, transform their businesses. This includes the\nmassive GPU complexes created by Microsoft Azure (150K), Meta Platforms\n(150K), Amazon Web Services (50K), Google Cloud (50K), Oracle Cloud\nInfrastructure (50K), Tencent (50K), Baidu (30K), and Alibaba (25K), which are\nranked there by their Nvidia H100 allocations according to data from Omdia,\nbut it also incudes pure GPU cloud players like CoreWeave (40K) and Lambda\n(20K). And then two wild cards, ByteDance (20K) and Tesla (15K), which are\ntheir own thing and which are doing their own LLMs.\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, CoreWeave and Lambda (formerly known as\nLambda Labs), are the interesting ones because they are making a lot of noise\nabout GPU allocations and how they are raising venture capital. They also have\nWall Street hoping for two big initial public offerings either this year or\nnext.\n\nWe understand all the buzz, but we doubt Wall Street has done the math all the\nway through on this. We leave it to you to reckon if the valuations on these\npre-IPO companies make any sense. We think the entirety of the world\u2019s stock\nmarkets are overvalued based on the fundamentals, and have been increasingly\nso over the decades. But we don\u2019t let that cloud our analysis, because value\nis a relative, not an absolute, metric. Anyone with a 401(k) needs this hot\nair to be real. (Wait, that includes us, too.)\n\nLet\u2019s have some fun. We have been saving this fascinating chart, which was\nburied in the same October 2023 financial report that included Nvidia\u2019s\nroadmap and which we edited to make it more accurate, for a good occasion. It\nexplains how the economics of this GPU racket works, at least from the point\nof view of Nvidia\u2019s top brass:\n\nThe left pie chart is easy enough to understand. If you want to be a GPU cloud\nplayer, start with $1 billion. With that, you can buy AI servers with an\naggregate of 16,000 H100s for what looks like $400 million, and you spend\nanother $100 million for Nvidia\u2019s InfiniBand networking to link them all\ntogether. You spend another $500 million to build a datacenter and operate,\npower, and cool it over those four years. Nvidia did not depreciate the cost\nof the datacenter or the iron inside of it, but you obviously do that.\n\nWe don\u2019t know where Nvidia came up with that GPU compute price, but at\nsomewhere around $400,000 a pop minimum for a configured GPU server that is a\nclone of the eight-way DGX H100 from Nvidia, that\u2019s 2,000 servers and that is\na cost of $800 million \u2013 not $400 million. We do not think the hyperscalers\nand cloud builders are getting a 46.7 percent discount given the exorbitant\ndemand for H100s.\n\nNow, you move to the right side. Nvidia says that the rental opportunity at $4\nper GPU-hour over the course of four years is around $2.5 billion. We have to\ndo a certain amount of witchcraft to get that number to work out, which we\nwill explain.\n\nFirst, if you just take 16,000 GPUs and multiply by $4 per hour over four\nyears (at 365.25 days per year and 24 hours in a day), then you get a rental\nrevenue stream of $2.24 billion. Not $2.5 billion. The pie chart on the right\nseems to imply that by using the more expensive InfiniBand networking rather\nthan Ethernet, you can increase the utilization of the GPUs by 15 percent,\nwhich is worth $350 million over four years and increase the throughput of the\nGPU cluster by 25 percent, which is worth $600 million. If you assume that\naggregate 43.8 percent performance improvement means you only need 11,130 H100\nGPUs instead of 16,000, and you multiply out the cost at $4 per GPU-hour over\nfour years over 11,130 GPUs, then you get $2.51 billion in rental income.\n\nAh, but wait, we know from analyzing p5 GPU instance pricing from Amazon Web\nServices, which we did in detail last July, that the on-demand instance price\nfor an eight-way H100 system instance was $98.32 per hour, or $12.29 per GPU-\nhour. We estimated the one year reserved instance cost $57.63 per hour, or\n$7.20 per GPU-hour, and we know that the published price for the three year\nreserved instance is $43.16, or $5.40 per GPU-hour.\n\nWe think the GPU rent doesn\u2019t change because of the performance improvement or\nthe utilization improvement that comes with using InfiniBand. (We know if AWS\nis not using InfiniBand for these p5 instances, but rather its own EFAv2\nimplementation of 400 Gb/sec Ethernet.) So here is the deal: If you have\n16,000 GPUs, and you have a blended average of on-demand (50 percent), one\nyear (30 percent), and three year (20 percent) instances, then that works out\nto $5.27 billion in GPU rental income over four years with an average cost of\n$9.40 per hour for the H100 GPUs. The increased efficiency of using InfiniBand\nmeans a cloud could get more customers through those GPUs faster, but it\ndoesn\u2019t change the per hour rental costs. It just means customers finish\nquicker and more customers can use it, but there are only 35,064 hours in a\nyear with 365.25 days.\n\nSo here is how we would edit the chart that Nvidia put together, assuming a\nmore accurate price for H100 GPUs and an upgrade to 800 Gb/sec InfiniBand and\nmore accurate pricing on a mix of p5 instance terms on AWS:\n\nHere is what you need to know, Wall Street: You put $800 of investment in for\nNvidia GPUs, another $700 million for a datacenter and networking, and you get\n$5,270 in revenue back out again if you have a reasonable mix of on-demand and\nreserved instance customers.\n\nWe do not think the numbers will be all that different across the AWS,\nMicrosoft Azure, and Google Cloud infrastructure, and we doubt in the final\nanalysis that they will be much lower on the GPU price (and therefore revenue)\nfrom the likes of CoreWeave or Lambda so long as GPUs are scarce.\n\nSome food for thought: It is always cheaper to rent a smaller number of GPUs\nfor a long time than a larger number of GPUs for a short time, and this has to\nbe juxtaposed against the GPU memory capacity and the GPU memory bandwidth\nneeds of any given size of LLM. Customers might need a large number of GPUs\nfor the memory, not the compute, but they are charged for the compute anyway.\n\nIt is with all of this in mind that we consider recent investments in\nCoreWeave and Lambda.\n\nCoreWeave, which was a bitcoin mining company founded in the New York City\nsuburb of Roseland, New Jersey and which has pivoted to AI processing,\nannounced today that it had received $1.1 billion in Series C financing from\nCoatue with participation from Magnetar (which led the Series B funding round)\nas well as Altimeter Capital, Fidelity Management, and Lykos Global\nManagement. That Series B round in December 2023 came to $642 million, which\nfollowed a Series A round that raked in $420 million in April 2023. In August\nlast year, CoreWeave also got $2.3 billion in debt financing from Magnetar and\nBlackstone. This funding is what has allowed CoreWeave to go from three\ndatacenters to fourteen datacenters in the past year. That is $2.16 billion in\nventure funding and $2.3 billion in loans for a total of $4.46 billion. That\nsounds like a lot until you realize that this represents the cost for\ndatacenters and GPU systems that have around 47,600 GPUs in total. That used\nto sound like a lot.\n\nBut here\u2019s the fun bit. If you run that number of GPUs through our comparison\nabove, you get $15.68 billion in rental income over four years. So, $4.46\nbillion in, and $15.68 billion back as revenue.\n\nAssuming that CoreWeave is good enough to get the same 65 percent to 70\npercent operating income out of its infrastructure as we think AWS can with\nits GPU instances over the years, and then pay for sales, marketing, and other\nstuff, this might be a pretty good business to invest in. And what seems clear\nis that when it comes to GPU allocations, the size and the speed of the\norganization matters a lot to Nvidia, which wants to get GPU cycles into the\nhands of people as quickly as possible to spread the Jensen Way far and wide.\n\nCoreWeave figured out it can be a niche player, but that it has to go big to\ncompete with the hyperscalers and largest cloud builders, which have much\nlarger GPU fleets and will continue to do so. You have to judge for yourself\nif the tripling of CoreWeave\u2019s valuation by the venture capitalists, which has\ntripled since its last funding round to $19 billion with the current round,\nmakes sense. There is another equation: $4.46 billion in, $19 billion or more\nIPO out. CoreWeave founders get rich, and everyone has a different way to\ncatch the Nvidia Wave.\n\nLambda is going to have to play catchup here. Last December, Lambda got a $320\nmillion infusion, and has raised a total of $932.2 million in funding across\npre-seed, seed, venture rounds, and debt financing between 2017 and 2023.\nLambda started out as a cloud serving AI workloads, shifted to become an AI\nsystem maker, and is now focusing more on being a GPU cloud.\n\nOnce again: Both CoreWeave and Lambda are saying they can provide GPU access\nfor less money than the big clouds, but that only hurts their cause if you\nthink about it. With GPU capacity scarce, they should try to charge as much as\nAWS until they can\u2019t, or the price of AWS minus all of the value that comes\nfrom SageMaker and Bedrock. You don\u2019t see AMD giving away its MI300 GPUs,\nafter all; it is charging around the same per unit of compute and unit of\nmemory as what Nvidia is charging for H100s and H200s. And there is no reason\nfor clouds to give away their GPU capacity for less than AWS sells it \u2013 at\nleast not yet. When there is a glut of GPU capacity, that will be a different\nstory \u2013 and when the HPC centers of the world will be able to swoop in and get\na lot of science done on the cheap. Perhaps.\n\n#### Sign up to our Newsletter\n\nFeaturing highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to\nyour inbox with nothing in between.
