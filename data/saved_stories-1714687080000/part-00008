To date, there have been no\nsystematic global comparisons of humans\u2019 ability to absorb and recover from\ndisturbances through time^4,5. Here we synthesized resilience across a broad\nsample of prehistoric population time\u2013frequency data, spanning 30,000 years of\nhuman history. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of population decline\nshow that frequent disturbances enhance a population\u2019s capacity to resist and\nrecover from later downturns. Land-use patterns are important mediators of the\nstrength of this positive association: farming and herding societies are more\nvulnerable but also more resilient overall. The results show that important\ntrade-offs exist when adopting new or alternative land-use strategies.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Empirical evidence for recent global shifts in vegetation resilience\n\nArticle Open access 28 April 2022\n\n### Towards a rigorous understanding of societal responses to climate change\n\nArticle 24 March 2021\n\n### Rethinking resilience to wildfire\n\nArticle 19 August 2019\n\n## Main\n\nUnderstanding the range of past responses of human societies to disturbances\nis a global priority across the social and natural sciences and will support\nthe development of solutions to future crises^1,2,3. Numerous case studies\nhave addressed past cultural collapse, transformation and persistence,\nalthough how to best characterize these processes is a subject for debate^6. A\nmajor unresolved issue is the lack of comparability between cases of\npopulation resilience in the historical sciences^4,5. Few studies explicitly\nmodel impacts, recovery and adaptation, or formally account for long-term\nhistory, which contains important and previously overlooked variation within\nand between cultural or environmental settings. Furthermore, a tendency to\nnarrowly focus on responses to extreme events in both natural and social\nsystems^7,8 may overemphasize local or short-term adaptive success at the\nexpense of understanding large-scale or long-term vulnerabilities^6,9. A well-\nknown example is the shift to a narrow marine diet among the Greenland Norse\nthat initially offset the short-term risk of crop failure yet heightened\nsocietal vulnerability to longer-term North Atlantic cooling^10. Here, we\nestablish a global comparative approach to long-term resilience to identify\nthe factors that structure the response of prehistoric populations to\ndisturbances through time. The approach measures population capacity to\nwithstand changes, as well as the rate of recovery following a disturbance\nthrough the common proxy of radiocarbon time\u2013frequency data^11,12.\nDisturbances are the inferred drivers of relative reductions in population or\narchaeological activity in prehistory, which are described variously as\nrecessions, downturns, busts, negative deviations or similar^12,13,14,15 and\nform the focus of this study, using summed probability distributions (SPDs) of\ncalibrated radiocarbon dates. SPDs function as an index of relative levels of\nhuman activity, or population change, over time^16,17. Population downturns\nare defined as periods when SPDs are significantly below expected growth\ntrajectories in response to disturbances. Our efforts focus on two key\nquestions: (1) how quickly do past populations recover after downturns; and\n(2) what factors mediate past resistance and resilience to downturns?.\n\nTo quantify patterns in population resistance\u2013resilience, we performed a meta-\nanalysis of 16 published study regions that used archaeological radiocarbon\ndata to reconstruct regional palaeodemographic trends (Supplementary Table 1).\nOur approach trades specificity for a large-scale, comparative perspective\nthat still accounts for variation between cases to focus on the emergent\nproperties of the statistical analysis. Studies were reviewed based on three\ncriteria: evidence for significant downturns, their scope and the inclusion of\nradiocarbon datasets. A lack of any single criterion resulted in the exclusion\nof a study. Cases with no reported downturns were not included, nor were those\nwhose scope was restricted to specific activities within a regional\nradiocarbon dataset, such as flint mining^18. Where published data have been\nsuperseded by later compilations, dates were added from the People3k\ndatabase^19, a systematic compilation of cleaned radiocarbon dates, based on\nthe geographical area of the original study. Our global sample of regions\nranges from the Arctic to the tropics and spans 30,000 years of history (Fig.\n1a). Population downturns were reproduced using our protocol (Methods) and\nresistance\u2013resilience metrics (Fig. 1b) were collected on 154 periods of\npopulation downturn, with a median of 8.5 periods in each region (Fig. 1c and\nSupplementary Tables 1 and 2). The numerical metrics collectively capture the\nseverity, chronology and frequency of periods of statistically significant\npopulation downturn. Disturbances were classified into both general categories\nand specific drivers according to the original studies and expert\ninterpretation of regional social, cultural and environmental history\n(Extended Data Table 1). The broad category of land use and evidence for\nadaptive change during, or in the wake of, downturns were also recorded. The\nfocus of this meta-analysis is to identify the factors governing the relative\ndepth of downturns (resistance) and the rate of recovery at their conclusion\n(resilience). A suite of hierarchical linear mixed models was developed to\ntest for significant associations between parameters while controlling for\nregional variability (Methods).\n\nFig. 1: Map and summaries of all world regions and disturbance types included\nin this study.\n\na, World map of study regions made with Natural Earth. Time ranges in calendar\nyears before present (cal bp) and ^14C dates used in this meta-analysis are\nindicated for each region. b, Conceptual diagram of measuring\nresistance\u2013resilience on palaeodemographic downturns against expected growth\ntrajectories. Downturn A is longer and faster, with low resistance and low\nrelative rate of recovery (resilience). Downturn B is shorter and slower,\ndisplaying higher resistance and higher resilience. Other combinations of high\nor low resistance and/or resilience are possible (Extended Data Fig. 4).\nParameters b, x and e for the equations in Table 1 are indicated in white\ndots. c, Summary of disturbance types within three broad categories reported\nin published palaeodemographic studies. Listed proxies are examples drawn from\nthe surveyed literature. \u2018Unclear\u2019 downturns (downturns with a lack of clear\nevidence for a driver) are not shown (Extended Data Table 1).\n\nFull size image\n\nThis approach to past resistance\u2013resilience provides a glimpse into\npopulation-level responses to disturbances throughout human history. Results\ndemonstrate that a single factor\u2014the frequency of downturns\u2014increases both the\nability to withstand disturbances and to recover from them. Additionally, the\nfrequency of downturns experienced by a given population is influenced by land\nuse: agricultural and agropastoral populations experience significantly more\ndownturns over time than other land-use patterns recorded during downturns\n(Extended Data Table 1). These findings collectively suggest that the global\nshift to food-producing economies during the Holocene (starting 11,700\ncalendar years before present) may have increased population vulnerability to\ndisturbances, yet in the process enhanced their adaptive capacity through\nrepeated exposure. Parallels to our long-term perspective on human population\nchange in macroecology suggest that comparative approaches in the historical\nsciences have the potential to generate profound insights into past\nhuman\u2013environmental relationships on a broad scale.\n\n## Cross-sectionally high resilience\n\nThe most common high-level driver of downturns, after those with a lack of\nevidence for a specific cause (unclear, n = 65), is environmental (n = 48,\n31%), followed by mixed (cultural\u2013environmental) (n = 33, 21%). The most\ncommon disturbance type is aridity in the environmental category (n = 31),\nfollowed by mobility (n = 20) in the cultural category. Only a third of\nrecorded downturns have resistance values that drop more than 50% from pre-\ndownturn activity levels (n = 53, 34.4%; Fig. 2a). Most downturns (n = 133,\n86%) end before baseline relative population levels are attained; in other\nwords, observed SPD values are lower at the end of most downturns than at the\npre-disturbance reference value. Resilience is relatively high across all\ncases (median = 0.64, n = 154), with 40% (n = 63) still attaining 90% of pre-\ndownturn conditions by their end (Fig. 2b). Full returns to SPD baseline\nconditions are frequently interrupted by subsequent downturns. Downturns\nassociated with cultural drivers return the highest median resilience (0.74),\nwhereas the median mixed (cultural\u2013environmental) resistance is highest at\n0.79. Resistance (0.65) and resilience are lowest among climate-driven\ndownturns (0.57). However, we do not find support for significant differences\nin either metric across disturbance categories (analysis of variance,\nresistance: F = 0.541, P = 0.65, d.f. = 3, n = 154; resilience: F = 0.04, P =\n0.98, d.f. = 3, n = 154).\n\nFig. 2: Summaries of downturn numerical metrics showing the relationship\nbetween resistance, resilience and the duration and relative pace of\ndownturns.\n\na,b, Distributions of resistance (a) and resilience (b) across disturbance\ncategories (Extended Data Table 1).

The thick black line represents\nthe group median. Data beyond the whiskers are individually plotted outlying\npoints.

Modelled downturn durations skew towards multidecadal and\ncentennial timescales.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Global variation in recovery rate\n\nInitial modelling indicates that the geographical location of downturns does\nnot affect resistance, with the exceptions of significantly higher values in\nthe Caribbean archipelago and the Italian peninsula. Conversely, there is\nsupport for significantly lower values for resilience in three regions: the\nCentral China Plains, the Caribbean archipelago and the Korean Peninsula, when\ncompared with all other regions (Extended Data Table 2). Further examination\nof these cases reveals that a large minority of downturns in these three\nregions return negative values of resilience (n = 11, 39%), which are produced\nwhen the population proxy exceeds the SPD value at the start of the downturn\nby its end (Extended Data Fig. 4, 12). Although the SPD population proxy\nremains below modelled expectations in all of these cases and therefore they\nare, in the strictest sense, downturns relative to the null models, the\nresults nevertheless imply that populations in these regions were, on average,\nable to recover faster than the norm. Owing to the observed range of variation\nand its potential impact on the metrics, study region was retained as a random\neffect variable in the mixed-effect models.\n\n## Long-term downturns are the norm\n\nThe durations of population downturns tend towards centennial (100\u2013500 years,\nn = 48, 31%) and decadal periods (less than or equal to 50 years, n = 47,\n30.5%), with a median of 98 years across the sample. Downturns lasting longer\nthan 500 years are a minority (n = 29). The time taken to reach SPD minima\nskews further towards decadal timescales (Fig. 2c). Only a single downturn\nthat commences with the 8.2-thousand-years-ago event in the Near East^20 has a\ntime to minimum longer than a millennium (2,070 years). Both variables have a\nstrong positive skew (duration = 2.84, time to minimum = 4.23). To control for\nthe distribution and broad range of variation in these variables, the time to\nminimum was normalized by downturn duration to produce an index of its\nrelative speed, which we term \u2018pace\u2019 (Fig. 2d). This transformation enables\ncomparison of the variation between downturns, with higher numbers reflecting\nslower downturns (\u03c3 = 0.55, s.d. = 0.23) and lacking support for non-normally\ndistributed values as in the time to minimum and duration variables\n(Shapiro\u2013Wilk W = 0.98396, P = 0.07108). Consequently, relative pace was\nemployed as a fixed-effect candidate in the mixed-effect modelling.\n\n## Land use mediates resilience\n\nThe frequency of downturns over time by region was estimated by normalizing\nthe cumulative number of downturns in a region by their duration (Table 1). We\ntransformed this to the logarithm of events per millennium to account for its\nstrongly skewed distribution. The variable allows us to compare the rate at\nwhich downturns occur. It consistently displays the strongest relationship to\nboth resistance and resilience (P < 0.001 in both cases) (Extended Data Table\n3) and is the only fixed variable retained by the information criterion-based\nselection procedure.\n\nTable 1 Metrics and model parameters extracted from global case studies of\npast population downturns\n\nFull size table\n\nCollectively, these results indicate that populations experience an enhanced\nability to withstand disturbances as frequency increases, as well as to\nrecover in the aftermath (Fig. 3a,b). Further examination of frequency of\ndownturns shows that, among the recorded disturbance types, changes to\nmobility regimes (median frequency of downturns = 2.26, n = 20) and high\nenvironmental variability (median frequency of downturns = 2.19, n = 17) occur\nat the highest rate per millennium, whereas cooling occurs at the lowest rate\n(median frequency of downturns = 0.761, n = 4) (Fig. 3c). In terms of regional\nvariation, the highest frequency of downturn is recorded in the South African\nGreater Cape Floristic Region (median frequency of downturns = 2.41, n = 17\nover 9,950 years) and the lowest in the Korean Peninsula (median frequency of\ndownturns = 0.58, n = 3 over 4,000 years).\n\nFig. 3: Effect sizes of model terms and dominant land use during downturns\nover time.\n\na,b, Resilience (a) and resistance (b) are strongly influenced by the rate of\ndownturn per millennium, with a stronger effect for resistance.

The 95% confidence intervals are\nindicated in a\u2013c by shaded bands and error bars. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and\n***P < 0.001.\n\nFull size image\n\nTreating the frequency of downturns as a response variable (Methods) revealed\nthat agricultural and agropastoralist land-use patterns are associated with\nsignificantly higher rates of downturn compared with low-level food\nproduction, marine foraging or mixed subsistence. Results from this additional\nmodelling exercise suggest that the frequency of downturns is likely to have\nan important effect on resistance and recovery, whereas the frequency of\ndownturns itself covaries with the dominant pattern of land use and\ndisturbance type in a given time and place. A larger sample size of downturns\nwould increase the explanatory power of our approach and enhance our\ncharacterization of these relationships.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis meta-analysis has examined the potential factors influencing resistance\nand resilience across a broad archaeological sample, and was controlled for\nregional variation. The frequency of downturns is the main determinant of the\nobserved outcomes among the examined factors. The relationship between\nresistance and resilience displays variable rates, although these events all\ntend to unfold at multidecadal to centennial timescales. Well-known historical\nexamples support this finding: the catastrophic depopulation of indigenous\ngroups across the Americas took place over centuries^21, and the collapse of\nimperial power in Western Rome was preceded by a long period of rural\ndepopulation^22. Systematic data on independent population downturns in\nprehistory are less common. However, what data are available^23,24 corroborate\nthis result: palaeodemographic downturns resolved in radiocarbon data tend to\nlast at least one human generation but frequently much longer.\n\nThe frequency of downturns is associated with both the ability of past\npopulations to withstand downturns and the rate of recovery following them\nacross a broad sample of human populations. The results suggest the existence\nof a common mechanism among human populations that confers resilience to\ndisturbances. The size of this interaction is greater for resistance (eta-\nsquared (\u03b7^2) = 0.46, P < 0.001; Fig. 3b) than resilience (\u03b7^2 = 0.29, P <\n0.001; Fig. 3a). In practical terms, this suggests that the ability to\nwithstand downturns is distinct from the ability to recover in their wake. We\nnote that this result does not imply a monocausal or deterministic\nrelationship; there are likely to be several adaptive pathways that increase\npopulation resistance and resilience by means of the mechanism of increasing\ndownturn frequency.\n\nFurther testing indicates that land-use practices associated with food\nproduction, such as farming and herding, are significantly and positively\ncorrelated with the frequency of downturns (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Table\n3). From the early Holocene, the proportion of land use associated with food\nproduction in our sample of downturns also increased, as the aggregate global\npopulation became gradually more reliant on domesticated species for meeting\nsubsistence needs (Fig. 3d). Collectively, these trends show that although\npopulations generally increased resistance and resilience over time, the\nheightened rate of downturn over time is itself likely to be linked to the\nhistorical tendency towards food-producing subsistence systems. Current\narchaeological evidence does not indicate that this process was unidirectional\nor inevitable; foraging and food production are neither mutually exclusive nor\nin opposition. Our synthetic findings agree with specific cases showing that\nthe behavioural and social changes that food production entailed had trade-\noffs in other arenas^23.\n\nTraditional agricultural or agropastoral practices include a diverse range of\nsocio-ecological systems that are often highlighted as potential sources of\ninspiration for solutions to current sustainability, biodiversity and\nconservation challenges^5,10,25,26. The results suggest that population\ndownturns or collapse are an inherent property of these systems and a\npotential trade-off of promoting their use. Systematic reviews in disturbance\necology indicate that frequent natural disturbances enhance the long-term\nresilience of key ecosystem services and that localized subsystem declines are\nan important mechanism through which this occurs^27. Our study provides\ninsight into the possible existence of an analogous relationship within our\nsample of human populations; higher frequencies are strongly correlated with\nboth smaller downturns and closer matches to pre-downturn values in the SPD\nproxies. We suggest that humanity\u2019s overall constant long-term population\ngrowth^28 may have been sustained due, in part, to the emergent positive\nfeedback between vulnerability, resistance and recovery documented here.\n\nPopulation decline has been termed an \u2018inevitable\u2019 feature of our species\u2019\ndemographic dynamics^29. In their systematic review of historical collapse and\nresilience dynamics, Cumming and Peterson^1 list depopulation as a key metric\nor factor in every ancient socio-ecological system studied. We anticipate that\nthis singular status will continue undiminished. Our contribution indicates\nthat downturns play an important role in human population history by enhancing\nthe resilience of survivor populations. We speculate that the creation of\nbiased cultural transmission may be responsible; downturns provide critical\nopportunities for landscape learning and the strengthening of local-to-\nregional knowledge networks to propagate through a cultural system^30,31.\nPopulation downturns have been identified as potential triggers of labour\ninvestment in infrastructure, social cohesion and technological\nadvancement^15. Together, these mechanisms have the potential to enhance the\npreferential transmission of knowledge and practices that promote future\nresistance or resilience^10. Raising population thresholds by intensifying\nland use may also heighten the risk of more serious collapse in return for\nincreasingly marginal benefits^1,24,32. Other non-trivial and historically\ncontingent factors that are likely to affect outcomes are the diversity and\necology of domesticated species assemblages, degree and type of political\ncomplexity, and settlement patterning in relation to the environment.\nIndicators such as the cessation of monument construction, loss of literacy or\neconomic turmoil can provide additional insight into the consequences and/or\npotential drivers of population downturns. These potential causal links must\nbe rigorously tested, however, as they are not easily disentangled. A\nrealistic model for the generative mechanism underlying the resilience of\nhuman populations will therefore have to be multiscalar and sensitive to\ncascading effects to account for how various exogenous impacts unfold and\nendogenous strategies are developed to solve them. The approach used for our\ncomparative analysis of palaeodemographic resistance\u2013resilience, however, does\nnot distinguish between these elements of the studied populations. Future\nresearch may translate between our work and the microscale, the patterns of\nwhich are only truly understandable within the kind of generalist, synthetic\nframe of reference that we provide.\n\nThis study finds parallels in macroecology, where analogous\nresistance\u2013resilience outcomes have been suggested to only fully resolve at\ncentennial timescales or above^33,34. Archaeology is uniquely suited to\nexamining past population history, and the dynamics that underlie these\ntrends, at such long-term timescales^35,36,37. Understanding past societies\u2019\nresponses to crises is often explicitly motivated by the goal of applying\nlearnings from the historical sciences to present-day policy and activism,\ncontributing to the ultimate objective of fostering resilient adaptations for\nthe future^6. Most archaeological work on past resilience is historically\nparticularistic^4,9 and emphasizes the contingencies, decisions and practices\nthat underwrote successful adaptations in specific times and places^38,39.\nThis specificity can be illuminating but, if the historical sciences are to\nplay any role in fostering future resilience, improving our understanding of\nthe processes and drivers that influence long-term, centennial-scale\nresilience is a necessary prerequisite^5. Our approach has highlighted the\nglobal relationship between population change and frequency of disturbance\nover millennial timescales and applies across a broad geographical and\nchronological sample of past populations, including prehistoric examples that\nhave been overlooked in systematic reviews of societal resilience more\nbroadly. Improved clarity on the drivers of exposure frequency and type in the\npast will help to reveal the mechanism(s) behind the dynamics we describe and\ntheir potential limits, which is particularly important as environmental\nvariability is predicted to increase in the future^40,41. Archaeological and\nhistorical case studies have focused on the frequency of volcanism, warfare^42\nand hydroclimatic oscillations^23,43, as well as the rate of abrupt or extreme\nevents in general^8. Comparable evidence on different categories of downturns\nis necessary. Synthesis of these or similar data in a comparative framework\ncan provide important insights into the causal links between population\nresilience, risk of exposure and, ultimately, the ability to recover.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Calibration and aggregation\n\nArchaeological radiocarbon dates were collated from published studies that\npreviously adopted null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) approaches\ntowards prehistoric demography. Our literature search identified 16 studies\nthat collectively span six continents and approximately 30,000 radiocarbon\nyears (Supplementary Tables 1 and 3\u201318). We applied a consistent protocol to\nthe calibration of radiocarbon assays. The calibrate function within the R\npackage rcarbon^17 was used to convert ^14C radiocarbon years to calendar\nyears before present. The IntCal20 (ref. ^44) and SHCal20 (ref. ^45) curves\nwere applied to dates in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively.\nCalibrated ages are reported as the 95.4% (two-sigma, 2\u03c3) age range.\nLaboratory codes and site identification numbers were appended to each\ncalibrated date range and postcalibration distributions were not normalized.\nTo account for between-site variation in sampling intensity, several dates\nfrom a single site that are within 50 radiocarbon years of each other were\npooled (\u2018binned\u2019) before aggregation into regional SPDs.\n\n### Bayesian model fitting\n\nOur protocol aimed to replicate the results of the 16 identified case studies\nto the greatest extent possible. To reproduce statistically significant\nnegative population events (\u2018downturns\u2019) produced by rcarbon\u2019s \u2018modelTest()\u2019\nfunction in the original studies, while simultaneously addressing the well-\nknown limitations of using summed probability distributions in NHST, we\nadopted an alternative, Bayesian modelling approach. Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) methods implemented in the nimbleCarbon package^46 for radiocarbon data\ncan obtain robust parameter estimates, accounting for radiocarbon measurement\nerrors and sampling error simultaneously. Previously, this has been a major\ndrawback of NHST approaches to aggregated radiocarbon data, with several\nalternatives proposed in the literature^47,48,49. Using the MCMC-derived\nparameter estimates in posterior predictive checks enabled us to detect\nperiods where expected growth trajectories were lower than the fitted model\nparameters and which were more robust and accurate than least-squares\nregression approaches applied directly on SPDs. The protocol produced outputs\nthat are analogous to those in previous NHST studies (Extended Data Fig. 1).\n\nWe analysed regional SPDs separately by fitting identical bounded exponential\ngrowth models to each dataset. This common model is defined by three\nparameters: growth rate (r) and boundaries (a and b). A weakly informative\nexponentially distributed prior (\u03bb = 1/000.4) was used for r to capture a\nbroad range of potential growth rates among the cases. Parameters a and b were\nadopted from the original studies. Markov chain traceplots (Extended Data\nFigs. 2 and 3) evaluate chain mixing alongside model convergence (Gelman-Rubin\n\u0212) and effective sample size diagnostics (Extended Data Table 5). Three chains\nof 50,000 iterations were run per region, with a burn-in of 5,000 iterations\nand a thinning interval of 2. To ensure comparability of results with\npublished studies that used a logistic growth model as a null hypothesis,\nregional datasets were subset based on expert judgement at documented\npalaeodemographic transitions and treated as two separate exponential growth\nmodels. Subsetting was only performed on the Near East and Italy, Sicily and\nSardinia datasets. Downturns adjacent to transition points were removed from\nthe sample to avoid including data points introduced by the subsetting.\nPosterior predictive checks were executed using samples of parameter estimates\nobtained by the MCMC approach to simulate and back-calibrate a number of\nradiocarbon dates equal to the sample size. The procedure was repeated 1,000\ntimes to derive critical envelopes.\n\n### Resilience metrics\n\nThe resilience metrics target periods when empirical SPD curves are below the\n90% confidence envelopes of the fitted models, according to the posterior\npredictive checks (periods termed \u2018downturns\u2019). Extraction was performed using\na bespoke R function modified from Riris and De Souza^12, which is available\nat ref. ^50. The principal response metrics in our analysis are resistance and\nresilience (Extended Data Fig. 4). Respectively, these metrics quantify the\nnormalized response to downturns and the rate of recovery relative to baseline\nconditions. Resistance is measured on SPDs using two parameters: SPD values at\nthe start of a downturn (b) and at downturn minima (x), whereas resilience is\nmeasured across the entire period of decline until its end (e) relative to the\nminimum and baseline (Table 1). Resistance ranges between 0 and 1, indicating\na 100% change from baseline to no change. Resilience ranges between \u22121 and 1,\nwith 1 indicating full recovery by the end of the downturn. Negative values of\nresilience indicate that the baseline value has been exceeded, although\nremaining outside the expectations of the null model. Finally, zero indicates\nno recovery^11,51. Variations in the shape of the SPD can result under\ncomparable scenarios (that is, with similar demographic dynamics,\narchaeological sample sizes and disturbances) and hence can produce different\nresults in the metrics because of calibration effects despite their\nsimilarity. Although this issue may contribute to noise and error in\nmeasurement, it is nevertheless highly unlikely to be systematic or to\ncorrelate with other variables of interest. Finally, we conservatively only\nconsider events greater than ten years in duration for our statistical\nmodelling. These events are at an elevated risk of being artefacts of the null\nmodel rather than true downturns with an unclear driver.\n\nWe also collected information on the start and ends of downturns, their\nduration, elapsed time until SPD minima were reached, the cumulative number of\na downturn and the frequency of downturns (Supplementary Table 2). The\nfrequency of downturns is calculated on a per downturn basis within study\nregions, using the cumulative number of the downturn, normalized by its\nduration. We report frequency of downturns for each downturn as a logarithm\nper millennium.\n\n### Statistical modelling\n\nThe target of our comparative analysis is the resistance and resilience of\nhuman populations to disturbance as defined in each individual study. Our\napproach assumed that high values reflect resilient populations that\nsuccessfully reestablish growth regimes after periods of decline related to\ndisturbance events. We also assumed that downturns are randomly distributed in\ntime and geographical space. To account for the influence of interregional and\ninterevent cultural variation on outcomes, we drew on expert judgement and\nclose readings of the published literature to record the broad category and\nspecific type of disturbance during downturns, as well as the dominant land-\nuse type and the nature of resulting socio-cultural changes, if any (Extended\nData Table 1). These variables provided a control on whether a given\npopulation within a cultural system retained its identity and function over\ntime, or whether system transformation and adaptive change is archaeologically\nevident.\n\nLinear mixed-effect models were executed to evaluate the presence and strength\nof relationships between resistance, resilience, the recorded variables and\ncase study locations. This analysis was performed using the cAIC4 and lme4 R\npackages^52,53; scripts are available at ref. ^50. Initial models were defined\nwith resistance and resilience as response variables, with only case\nidentifiers (region) as a random effect. As observed downturns were sequential\nwithin each case, the random effect controlled for potential pseudoreplication\nand avoided the need to weight the data by group size. A stepwise search using\nAkaike\u2019s information criterion was implemented for investigating the\ninformation gain of including fixed effects in each model in turn. These\ncandidate models were sequentially fitted using restricted maximum likelihood.\nMost fixed covariates (Extended Data Table 3) were left out of the final\nmodels. Region was retained as a random effect in all cases, to produce two\nmodels:\n\n$${\\rm{resistance}}\\approx \\left(1{\\rm{|\n}}{\\rm{region}}\\right)+{\\rm{frequency}}\\,{\\rm{of}}\\,{\\rm{downturn}}$$\n\n$${\\rm{resilience}}\\approx \\left(1{\\rm{|\n}}{\\rm{region}}\\right)+{\\rm{frequency}}\\,{\\rm{of}}\\,{\\rm{downturn}}$$\n\nModel output is summarized in Extended Data Table 3 and diagnostics are shown\nin Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6. We present standardized residuals, by region\nand in full, as well as leverage and Cook\u2019s distance.\n\nTo further explore the relationship between rates of downturns and resistance\nand resilience, we performed an additional modelling exercise with the same\nrandom effect and full suite of fixed effects, with the frequency of downturn\nas the independent variable (Extended Data Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7).\n\n$${\\rm{frequency}}\\,{\\rm{of}}\\,{\\rm{downturn}}\\approx \\left(1{\\rm{|\n}}{\\rm{region}}\\right)+{\\rm{land}}\\,{\\rm{use}}+{\\rm{change}}+{\\rm{disturbance}}\\,{\\rm{type}}+{\\rm{pace}}$$\n\nThe effect sizes (standardized coefficients) of the significant model terms\nare plotted graphically in Fig. 3c and reported in full in Extended Data Table\n4. We report effect sizes in the text as \u03b7^2, that is, the total variance\nexplained by differences between means.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe data supporting the findings of this study are available via Zenodo at\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10061467 (ref. ^53).\n\n## Code availability\n\nThe code supporting the findings of this study is available via Zenodo at\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10061467 (ref. ^53).\n\n## References\n\n  1.
