Sign up to get Caleb\u2019s writing in your\ninbox.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever tussled with our daily mini crossword puzzles, you can most\nlikely blame Paolo Pasco. The good news is that the constructor who stumped\nyou is now the champion of the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament at the\nripe old age of 23. The ACPT is the largest speed-solving tournament in the\nworld, this year welcoming more than 800 competitors. The three finalists\nsolve puzzles on a big whiteboard in front of a crowd; wins come down to\nliteral seconds.\n\nWhen I first met Paolo, he was 13 and already creating stellar grids as\nelegant as they were playful. These days, I rely on him as The Atlantic\u2019s main\ncrossword contributor. To put into perspective what a phenomenal speed-solver\nPaolo is: He solved the latest Inferno (our special magazine puzzle that gets\nmore difficult as you descend into its depths) in one minute and 27 seconds.\nThe average solve time for that puzzle is 16 minutes, 28 seconds. I spoke with\nPaolo recently about his win, his speed-solving tactics, and, inevitably, the\n2024 Marvel masterpiece Madame Web.\n\nWeaving the Web\n\nCaleb Madison: Is this the big winner I\u2019m speaking to?\n\nPaolo Pasco: Well, look who said I would never become the big winner.\n\nMadison: To be honest, that was to motivate you. Because if I hadn\u2019t said that\nso many times when you were younger, you might not have worked as hard in\ndefiance of me.\n\nPasco: That is true.\n\nMadison: Okay, I have some serious questions, lest anyone think we\u2019re taking\nthis lightly. When did you start solving crosswords, and how did you\ntransition to speed-solving?\n\nPasco: I think I\u2019ve been solving puzzles in general for most of my life. I\nhave a pretty early memory of solving Sudoku on the kitchen floor in crayon on\na sheet my mom had printed out at work. That turned into those\u2014you know those\nDell puzzle magazines they have at airports and grocery stores?\n\nMadison: Yes.\n\nPasco: I\u2019d do a lot of those, but I would skip the ones that required you to\nknow trivia. Because I was a kid; I didn\u2019t know things. When I was in eighth\ngrade, my family was taking a big road trip up to Stanford for my brother\u2019s\ngraduation, so I downloaded the iPad app of the New York Times crossword, just\nfor something to do. I solved through some of the packs, and I realized: Whoa,\nthese are pretty cool. And you didn\u2019t even need to be a trivia god to make\nsome progress on them. It\u2019s a lot more fun than just a quiz in a box.\n\nShortly after that, I started getting a lot of those \u201cWill Shortz\u2019s favorite\ncrosswords\u201d kind of books. A lot of puzzles by this one young upstart named\nCaleb Madison.\n\nMadison: Heard of him.\n\nPasco: I think it was a combination of the app and those books that made me\nrealize that these puzzles were made by people, and there\u2019s a human sense of\nfun behind them. At about that same time, I started making crosswords.\n\nThe speed-solving began in 2015 or 2016. In the summer of 2016, I was\nregistered by my very kind parents for the indie tournament Lollapuzzoola. And\nI competed and won the lower division. That was kind of my first sense of, Oh,\nI can actually solve these on paper, and fast. I remember someone at the\ntournament said to me, \u201cI remember seeing G. Paolo Pasco on the leaderboards\non the website, and based on your times, I would have thought you\u2019re one of\nthose guys who sees the puzzle on someone else\u2019s computer and just copies it.\u201d\nEverything since then has been to prove to him that I am not one of those\nguys.\n\nMadison: How did you train? Are there any tactics that you found particularly\nhelpful in getting your time down?\n\nPaolo Pasco during the speed-solving competition (Donald Christensen, courtesy\nof American Crossword Puzzle Tournament)\n\nPasco: The standard advice people give, which I think is good, is to print out\na lot of puzzles and solve them on paper. It\u2019s a different thing if you\u2019re\ncompeting in an online tournament versus on paper, because with online\nnavigation, if your cursor is on 14-Down, you don\u2019t have to do any work to see\nthe clue. So training your eye to move back and forth from clues to grid\nwithout losing your place, remembering clues when you can, really helps.\n\nMadison: So when you look at the clues, you\u2019re not only looking at the clue\nthat you\u2019re solving at the moment; you\u2019re trying to get an impression of all\nthe clues around it so that you don\u2019t have to look back.\n\nPasco: Yeah, I think especially for big puzzles, where you\u2019re navigating your\neyes around the grid, that\u2019s a really big time save, because you do it so many\ntimes. When I glance down, I try to just remember the next three across clues.\n\nMadison: Oh, that\u2019s interesting.\n\nPasco: As for less common tricks, downs-only solving was very helpful for\nintuiting word patterns\u2014thinking, for example, if I have TH, blank, blank, E,\nthen the first one\u2019s probably a vowel, and the second is probably a consonant.\nIf you have a big section where nothing inevitably jumps out as a toehold,\nthere\u2019s value in putting something in to have something in and just seeing if\nthat works. Then if it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work\u2014but just to have the idea\nof something to go off. I think I feel the most comfortable solving one entry,\nseeing what crosses it, and building out from that, kind of like a web. Have\nyou seen Madame Web?\n\nMadison: I was going to say, that sounds kind of like some of the webs that\nMadame Web was dealing with in the film.\n\nPasco: Yeah. So eventually, I would want that web to connect them all.\n\nMadison: Describe that last moment where you\u2019re up there and you finish the\npuzzle. Do you check your grid really, really quickly?\n\nPasco: Oh gosh, I think I made a policy while I was solving it that when I was\ndone with a section, I\u2019d just check every clue in that section to make sure it\nmakes sense.\n\nMadison: So you\u2019re checking as you go along?\n\nPasco: Yeah. I think that was a conscious decision, because I knew that the\ntwo people I was up against, Will Nediger and David Plotkin, are both very\nfast. So if I was spending a lot of time checking at the end, then that might\nbe time for someone else to sneak in. Last year was kind of that scenario for\nme. One letter left, hesitated on it for too long, and Dan Feyer snuck one\npast the goalie.\n\nMadison: Last year, you came in second place?\n\nPasco: I came in second place by a margin of one and a half seconds.\n\nMadison: Wow.\n\nPasco: And if I had just gone with my gut and put in the letter I was\nguessing, I would have won. But I hesitated, and Dan pulled out a well-\ndeserved win.\n\nMadison: Have people started to treat you differently now that you\u2019re the\nchampion?\n\nPasco: I mean, I hope they don\u2019t. I feel like it\u2019s a very \u201cbig name in a small\nroom\u201d kind of thing.\n\nMadison: Have you said it at any New York restaurants? Maybe you could get a\nbetter reservation, or free appetizers.\n\nPasco: I do want to pull out \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d at least once.\n\nMadison: Do you have anything else you want to say to the good people at home\nabout your big win?\n\nPasco: I feel very fortunate. I truly did not expect for it to happen. Oh, I\nalso want to say thank you so much to my family for everything. For being so\ngracious when their kid had one of the weirdest hobbies you could have, and\nnot only encouraging it but also enrolling them in a crossword tournament to\nspend the whole day doing this weird hobby. I hope it paid off.\n\nMadison: I think it did. I mean, it\u2019s pretty exciting to be the best in the\nworld at something. Not many people get to do that.\n\nPasco: The current best in the world. Until David Plotkin or Tyler Hinman or\nDan Feyer or Andy Kravis compete again next year.\n\nMadison: You get a year of being the best. Most people don\u2019t even get an hour.\n\nPasco: True.\n\nMadison: A hearty congrats. It\u2019s very exciting. And you should be very proud.\nYou deserve it.\n\nPasco: Thank you.\n\nRelated:\n\n  * Play The Atlantic\u2019s daily crossword.\n  * Crossword tips for beginners\n\nCaleb Madison is the crossword-puzzles editor at The Atlantic and the author\nof The Good Word column.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
