Built in 1958, it was\noften regarded as the place for young creatives to gather if they needed a\nspark of inspiration, especially during the 1960s and '70s.\n\nThe building housed offices for a number of now-famous creators, but it also\nhad a cafe called Leon on its first floor \u2014 a rendezvous spot for creatives\nincluding Rei Kawakubo, a fashion designer who founded Comme des Garcons,\nKansai Yamamoto, another influential fashion designer, film director Juzo\nItami, and advertising copywriter Shigesato Itoi.\n\nMany of them rose to fame by networking at the Central Apartment, which was\ntorn down in 1996.
