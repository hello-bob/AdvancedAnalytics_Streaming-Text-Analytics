It is meant to resemble the\nmonad joke, and might also be a jab at the darcs patch theory, but\nfundamentally, the person making the joke didn't understand the monad joke.\n\nSources:\n\nThis is the original tweet containing the quote:\n\n> Wil Shipley (@wilshipley): Sweet god I hate git.\n>\n> Isaac Wolkerstorfer (@agnoster): @wilshipley git gets easier once you get\n> the basic idea that branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping\n> submanifolds of a Hilbert space.\n\nAnd this is a comment on Quora by the original author of the tweet:\n\n> To confirm what Leo said, it was intended as a joke.

[...]\n\nThe Leo he is referring to is another answerer in the same thread, a\nmathematician, who basically explains why that is nonsense. (Hilbert spaces\nare continuous, patches and branches are discrete.)\n\nHe also explains that he was inspired by this blog post (A Guide to GIT using\nspatial analogies), which actually does make sense.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Sep 17, 2014 at 8:18\n\nanswered Sep 16, 2014 at 21:40\n\nJ\u00f6rg W MittagJ\u00f6rg W Mittag\n\n104k2424 gold badges222222 silver badges323323 bronze badges\n\n9\n\n  * 18\n\nThat's disappointing.\n\n\u2013 Larry OBrien\n\nSep 16, 2014 at 22:44\n\n  * 6\n\n@amon: I added a quote by the author of that joke, wherein he explains that\nany sense that statement would potentially make is purely coincidental:\n\"Attempts to analyze it in this fashion should be futile, but due to a bug in\nreality, you can actually make any sufficiently hand-wavy statement fit if you\ntry hard enough.\"\n\n\u2013 J\u00f6rg W Mittag\n\nSep 17, 2014 at 8:21\n\n  * 11\n\nI've always assumed that the author of the joke did get the monad joke but was\npurposely descending in to gibberish as a parody.

I'm not even sure I had heard the joke at\nthe time. It's actually (as you point out later) based off the tartley blog\npost. I was mainly going for gibberish - I had no intent of mirroring a\n\"sounds like gibberish but is actually technically correct\" joke. But I love\nthe thoroughness of your answer!

The main objective of the theory is\nto model merging and, in particular, conflict resolution. The Darcs wiki has\nan introduction to the theory and a few pointers as well as a bibliography\n(unmaintained so outdated if you want a recent view on the subject, but it\ndoes list a 2009 survey paper by Petr Baudi\u0161) and a list of talks (which\nincludes more recent material). There's also a wikibook. One seminal paper is\nA Principled Approach to Version Control by Andres L\u00f6h, Wouter Swierstra and\nDaan Leijen3.\n\nPatch theory does lead to a categorical model, which has been more recently\nexplored in A Categorical Theory of Patches by Samuel Mimram and Cinzia Di\nGiusto and Homotopical Patch Theory by Carlo Angiuli, Ed Morehouse, Daniel R.\nLicata and Robert Harper. In Mimram and Di Giusto's work, the model has files\nas objects and patches as morphisms. I think that makes merging a branch a\nfunctor \u2014 an endofunctor if you're working in a single repository.\n\u201cHomeomorphic endofunctor\u201d doesn't make sense to me. And with homotopy theory\ninvolved (a concept from calculus \u2014 that's the branch of mathematics that\nstudies things like manifolds and Hilbert spaces \u2014 which has recently been\napplied to a fundamental model of mathematics called homotopy type theory),\nsubmanifolds of a Hilbert space might not be so far out...\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Apr 12, 2017 at 7:31\n\nCommunityBot\n\n1\n\nanswered Aug 18, 2015 at 18:11\n\nGilles 'SO- stop being evil'Gilles 'SO- stop being evil'\n\n2,68511 gold badge2222 silver badges2626 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n  * Also, Darcs is written in Haskell, so it's built on monads. :-)\n\n\u2013 Wyzard\n\nAug 19, 2015 at 1:50\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nHighly active question.
