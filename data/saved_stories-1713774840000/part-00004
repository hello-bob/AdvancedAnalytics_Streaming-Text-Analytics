He knew that four soldiers had been taking\nshelter there. Yet he saw two bodies \u2013 and no one else.\n\n\"When I got there, those two were already cold,\" he said. It was mid-February.\nThe men\u2019s limbs were torn off.\n\nThere was no time to linger around. The dugout, positioned near Russian-\noccupied Bakhmut in eastern Donetsk Oblast, could become a target again.\nMykhailo left.\n\nLater, he learned what happened at the dugout.\n\nFour soldiers were on their way back to the rear from the front-line positions\nfor a shift change and took cover in the dugout. When Russian drones hit it,\ntwo soldiers were killed, one was wounded, and one is still considered\nmissing.\n\nWhat happened next is typical for the parts of the front line that suffer from\nthe lack of combat medics and front-line evacuation.\n\nThe wounded soldier got out of the dugout and walked to the nearest evacuation\npoint, located a few hundred meters away, on his own.\n\nNo one arrived to check on the others until Mykhailo, a fellow soldier, looked\ninto the dugout.\n\nAt positions as heavily shelled and close to Russian troops as this one,\nsoldiers say that medical evacuation doesn't exist.\n\nFor Mykhailo, a soldier in Ukraine's elite 80th Air Assault Brigade fighting\nnear the liberated village of Klishchiivka, it means that every time he goes\nto the positions, he doesn\u2019t count on surviving.\n\n\"I know I am going to meet death (there),\" Mykhailo, who goes by the call sign\nNimy (\"Mute\"), said. \"(Evacuation) is impossible.\"\n\nUkrainian military medics treat wounded Ukrainian soldiers at a base near\nAvdiivka, Donetsk Oblast, on Dec. 31, 2023. (Ozge Elif Kizil/Anadolu/Getty\nImages)\n\nThe main reason for the absence of medical evacuation is simple and gruesome:\nThe fighting is just too intense.\n\nIt can take a day or even two for soldiers to get in and out of the fiercest\nfighting spots \u2013 killing any hopes of medics coming to save the wounded.\n\nLeft alone at the positions, the soldiers often have to pull out their\ncomrades on their own under heavy shelling, sometimes walking five to seven\nkilometers to the nearest evacuation points, where vehicles take them to\nmakeshift hospitals.\n\nWhen soldiers carry their wounded out, the group is easy to spot \u2013 and it\nimmediately becomes easy prey to Russian first-person view (FPV) drones and\nartillery.\n\nEvacuation vehicles can\u2019t come to the positions to get the wounded out fast:\nThey are even easier to spot, and Ukraine can\u2019t afford to lose the sparse\nequipment.\n\nThe front-line units say they face a severe shortage of basic equipment such\nas the U.S.-made M113 armored personnel carriers and even Soviet-era BMP\ninfantry vehicles. Dozens of servicemen from three battalions who spoke to the\nKyiv Independent stressed that the deficit is so critical that in their units,\nwhich number 300 to 600 infantrymen, they only have one M113 and BMP each \u2013\njeopardizing evacuation.\n\nThe vehicles often break down due to Russian attacks or complicated terrain,\nadding to the shortage.\n\nUkrainian army medics transfer a wounded Ukrainian soldier to a hospital in\neastern Ukraine on Dec. 27, 2022. (Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu Agency via\nGetty Images)\n\nThe army's Medical Forces agreed that the armored vehicles used for evacuation\nrequire \"constant replenishment and are not sufficient,\" and said the only way\nto solve the issue is to get more from allies.\n\n\"Of course, it (the shortage of armored vehicles) reduces the ability to\nimplement evacuation measures,\" the specialist corps said in an official\nresponse to the Kyiv Independent. \"The time of medical evacuation and its\nduration in most cases depends on the operational situation on the\nbattlefield.\"\n\nAfraid to lose armored vehicles, commanders sometimes have to prioritize the\nequipment over the wounded, ordering soldiers not to drive up closer to reduce\nthe risk of a direct hit, the interviewees say. But time is crucial to saving\na life or a limb.\n\n\"The root problem has remained the same throughout this war \u2013 there is a\ndeficit of armored vehicles to perform casevac missions,\" U.S.-based military\nexpert Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment for International\nPeace, told the Kyiv Independent.\n\nUkraine's army is \"extremely equipment-poor and medical-poor\" for its size,\nand the problem can be traced back to 2014, according to Glen Grant, a retired\nU.K. Lieutenant Colonel who until recently was a defense expert at the\nUkrainian Institute for the Future, a local think-tank that analyzes the\ncountry's policies.\n\n\"This goes even further back because this is a Soviet legacy where the Soviet\nUnion didn't really expect to bring anybody back... They either keep going or\nthey die,\" he said, naming Russia's approach to evacuation as an example.\n\"Unfortunately, that attitude hasn't been sucked out of the Ukrainian system\nproperly.\"\n\nBut unlike Russia, Ukraine is already facing a critical manpower shortage,\nespecially in the infantry, as it struggles to find recruits to refill the\nheavy losses. Every soldier lost to poor evacuation is another that has to be\nreplaced.\n\nMykhailo from the 80th brigade said that his unit had been decimated over the\neight months of fighting south of Bakhmut, estimating that only 10 percent of\nhis fellow assault soldiers remain in action \u2013 with the rest killed, wounded,\nor missing. Knowing he has little chance of being evacuated if wounded,\nMykhailo thinks his chances to survive are small.\n\n\"I'm just doing my job the best I can,\" Mykhailo, the father of two, said in\ntears. \"If I will be killed in the field...,\" he paused and caught up with\nbreathing, \"for Ukraine, I am ready.\"\n\n## 'Calling artillery on yourself'\n\nJunior Sergeant Iryna, a 26-year-old who goes by her call sign Wild, wears a\nGoPro camera when heading to dangerous front-line missions.\n\nThe former company commander of Ukraine's 67th Separate Mechanized Brigade\ndoes it because she is concerned that she could be sued for making what could\nbe perceived as a wrong decision on evacuation.\n\nThe choice between risking their own soldiers' lives to evacuate the wounded\nand halting the mission to avoid further casualties is a tough call for\ncommanders that almost always comes with guilt afterward.\n\nIryna sometimes watches the GoPro footage of an October day when she had to\ncall off an evacuation of a wounded friend deployed on the Kreminna front,\ntrying to see if she could have done anything differently.\n\nOn that day in the fall of 2023, Iryna and three others headed into the forest\nnear the Russian-occupied town of Kreminna in Luhansk Oblast to pull out three\nwounded soldiers. They got two, but the third one, a commander from another\ncompany with the call sign Sailor, was too far away.\n\nIt was clear to Iryna's team that going closer to Sailor would be \"suicidal\"\ndue to the incessant shelling. She had to call off the evacuation and leave\nhim.\n\n\"It was either we save these guys that we have now or lose everyone,\" Iryna\nsaid.\n\nHours later, Sailor died on the spot where he was wounded.\n\n\"You have to be cold-minded in war,\" she said. \"Quick decisions can save a lot\nof lives.\"\n\nA wounded Ukrainian soldier wears an identification tag with a trident, the\ncoat of arms of Ukraine, while being transported from a battlefield area to a\nhospital on a medical evacuation bus in eastern Ukraine on Feb. 22, 2023.\n(John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nAnother time, she recalls, when evacuation was impossible, the soldiers had\nthe final request: to hit their positions with artillery.\n\nAround the same time, in autumn 2023, Iryna recalled, seven soldiers were\nstuck under the rubble of a dugout after Russian shelling. When they finally\nreceived an order to withdraw, it was too late. The outnumbered Ukrainian\nsoldiers were buried inside the position that had just collapsed, and the\nfighting was too intense for anyone to come and dig them out.\n\nRussian troops soon reached the dugout.\n\n\"(One of the guys stuck in the dugout) was saying, 'There are (Russian\nsoldiers) above me, I won't make it out \u2013 call the artillery on me,' and I am\nthe commander, so you need to make the decision,\" Iryna said, recalling that\nmoment.\n\n\"Either you call (artillery), and you essentially kill them, or you somehow\nkeep the situation under control for a while, send a support group so that\nthey can clear it and try to get the guys out.\"\n\nIryna ordered smaller shells to be fired at the position to \"destroy a maximum\nnumber (of Russians) above but not harm our guys, who were buried underneath.\"\n\nBut it was still impossible to get anywhere close to them.\n\nThe next thing she heard on the radio was Russian soldiers trying to mimic her\ncomrades. To this day, she doesn\u2019t know what happened to the seven soldiers.\nOfficially, they are missing in action.\n\nHer unit, then led by 36-year-old veteran soldier Oleh, had encountered a\nsimilar incident in March 2023 when they were deployed near Bakhmut. Oleh, now\na platoon commander with the same brigade, told the Kyiv Independent about a\nlast-ditch rescue mission that failed, leaving 23 men stuck on the front line.\n\nThey also tried to call artillery on themselves, saying that Russian soldiers\nwere only 10 meters away and they had no chance of fighting them off.\n\nThe artillery didn\u2019t hit the positions. Then came the silence. No one answered\nthe radio anymore. Oleh and others believe that everyone in the group was\nkilled. The bodies could not be retrieved.\n\n\"Each of them wanted to live. Each of them was afraid of dying,\" said Oleh,\nwho goes by the call sign Tsvyk. He blamed himself for losing the 23 comrades,\nand it took a heavy toll on him, he added.\n\nMedics evacuate a wounded soldier who tripped on a petal mine as evacuation\ntakes place in darkness in the middle of a damaged forest in Kupiansk\nfrontline, Ukraine on Jan. 27, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)\n\n## Evacuation orders\n\nMultiple company and platoon commanders across the front line said they have\nalso suffered heavy losses due to the higher command's decisions to send men\nto defend the positions for \"as long as they can,\" in places where withdrawal\nand evacuation weren't possible.\n\nSoldiers often perceive such commands as mistakes, and say they cause\navoidable casualties and reduce morale.\n\nThe defense and fall of Avdiivka is a recent example. The situation gradually\nworsened in the small industrial city just outside of occupied Donetsk,\nforcing Ukraine to withdraw in mid-February.\n\nWestern experts and many Ukrainian soldiers interviewed by the Kyiv\nIndependent said the evacuation would not have been as chaotic if the decision\nhad been made a few weeks earlier.\n\nThe price of the last-minute evacuation was heavy. The soldiers had to\nwithdraw through a poorly prepared thin path with mines lying around and under\nheavy shelling west of the city.\n\nSome soldiers were given the order to withdraw at any cost, leaving the\nwounded and fallen comrades behind.\n\nWounded soldiers are taken care of by 3rd Assault Brigade medics near the\nBakhmut frontline during a counter-offensive in Donbas, Ukraine, on July 23,\n2023. (PGian Marco Benedetto/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nOther soldiers have described similar experiences they had during the fall of\nBakhmut in May 2023. Days before the fall, Oleh\u2019s unit was ordered to go to\nthe embattled western part of the city.\n\nFearing that it would be a suicide mission, the soldiers refused the order.\nThey worried that they only received instructions on how to get inside the\ncity on the verge of falling \u2013 but nothing concerning evacuation. Multiple\nlocal commanders blamed their leadership\u2019s lack of knowledge of the situation\non the ground and what they perceived as their unwillingness to listen to\ntheir advice.\n\nBut the officers stress that even late withdrawals may not have been as fatal\nif the units deployed on that front-line sector had enough ammunition to allow\nfor the arrival of evacuation vehicles.\n\n## Shortage of ammunition, equipment undermines evacuation\n\nUkraine\u2019s critical lack of ammunition also undermines the effectiveness of\nfront-line evacuation.\n\nJakub Janovsky, a Prague-based analyst at the Oryx OSINT project, underscored\nthat ammunition plays a crucial role in evacuation. If there was enough, it\nmay have been possible to temporarily suppress the enemy with artillery and\nthen risk a rescue mission, he explained.\n\n\"If you don't have that ammunition, that (rescue mission) immediately gets\nmuch more dangerous than it would otherwise be (in addition to equipment\nshortage),\" Janovsky said.\n\nThe priority list changes with the battlefield situation, but Kyiv is\ncurrently asking Western allies for additional air defense equipment,\nelectronic warfare equipment, artillery, ammunition, combat aircraft, and\ndrones, Ukrainian Ambassador to NATO Natalia Galibarenko told the Kyiv\nIndependent.\n\nUkraine has rightfully placed ammunition as the top priority since a higher\nfiring rate could lead to less demand for evacuation, said Anton Pyzhykov,\nhead of the Procurement Department at Serhiy Prytula Charity Foundation, which\nfundraises money for Ukraine's military.\n\nRetired U.K. Lieutenant Colonel Grant, however, stressed that ammunition\nshortage should signal that the medical side needs more attention, prompting\nhigher demand for armored vehicles for efficient evacuation.\n\n\"Military is a system. If you have any weak areas, the system breaks \u2013 and\nmedical is one of the key parts of the system,\" Grant said. \"We're at war. The\ngovernment has got to take responsibility for identifying how to sort out the\nweak areas.\"\n\nThe issue with the lack of armored vehicles like M113s for evacuation \"lies\nsomewhere between the right equipment not being requested, and the right\nequipment not being provided in sufficient numbers,\" according to military\nanalyst Kofman.\n\n\"Part of the issue is the continued focus on high-end capabilities instead of\nbasic systems and platforms that are needed in large numbers to sustain\nUkraine's war effort and exist in Western stocks because we are talking about\nprimarily Cold War period equipment that's decades old,\" he said.\n\nMedics from Medical company of the 59th Brigade during their work in Medical\nEvacuation Point in Mykolaiv Oblast, Ukraine, on Nov. 10, 2022. (Wojciech\nGrzedzinski/The Washington Post)\n\nIn a commentary to the Kyiv Independent, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said it\nhad included armored vehicles that support evacuation in the needs list shared\nwith Western allies but did not disclose the exact number of requested or\nreceived vehicles. While not calling it a shortage, the ministry agreed that\nthere is always \"a demand\" for them, as domestic production is limited and the\nlosses constantly need to be replenished.\n\nObserving the past months of military aid pledges and delivery, military\nanalyst Janovsky from the Oryx OSINT project said Western nations have focused\nmore on ammunition, possibly distracting them from other needs such as\nequipment.\n\nWestern nations have delivered over 2,000 infantry fighting vehicles and\narmored personnel carriers, including nearly 190 Bradley and about 960 M113,\nsince the full-scale war began in February 2022, according to Oryx.\n\nRoughly 1,000 more were pledged, though Janovsky stressed that not all the\npledges are made public, with certain countries likely wanting to keep their\narms stockpile a secret.\n\nWhile agreeing with the direness of Ukraine's ammunition scarcity, Janovsky\ninsisted that evacuation would significantly improve if Ukraine's major ally,\nWashington, provided at least half its M113 armored personnel carriers\ncurrently in storage.\n\nThe U.S. has about 13,000 M113 armored personnel carriers, including 5,000\nactively being used and 8,000 in storage, according to the International\nInstitute for Strategic Studies' The Military Balance 2023 book. Oryx says\nthat the U.S. has thus far delivered around 600.\n\nIt can take a few weeks to months for an M113 to be delivered after the\npledge, along with the spare parts, according to Janovsky. Even after the\npledge is made, issues sometimes arise with the delivery cost \u2013 further\ndelaying the transfer of the equipment, he added.\n\nDomestic political issues such as the U.S. Congress blocking Ukraine aid leave\nfuture Western support uncertain.\n\nSoldiers of the 58th Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian army wait for a lift\nto position in LAV M113 as Russian attacks on the city of Vuhledar continue in\nDonetsk Oblast on Dec. 1, 2023. (Andre Alves/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nPentagon spokesman Charlie Dietz confirmed the U.S. knows about Ukraine's\nstruggle with vital equipment such as Bradley.\n\n\"Given the ongoing equipment shortages that Ukraine is facing, the needs for\nthese are noticed, and specific numbers and timelines are subject to strategic\nconsiderations and ongoing discussions with Ukrainian and allied partners,\"\nDietz told the Kyiv Independent. \"However, we are fully aware of the urgency\nof the situation and are working diligently to ensure timely support as\nfeasible.\"\n\nWith equipment lacking, Ukraine's military heavily relies on regular cars and\npickup trucks to conduct evacuations.\n\nCars can beat bulky armored vehicles by speed and quietness, but they can\u2019t\nmaneuver through thick mud and break down more often \u2013 especially when driving\nthrough thin roads heavily struck by drones and artillery.\n\nCommanders on the ground say it's an endless race to keep repairing the cars,\noften from the soldiers' own pockets or through public fundraisers run by\nvolunteers.\n\nUkrainian combat medics evacuate a wounded Ukrainian servicemen from the front\nline near Bakhmut, Ukraine, on March 8, 2023. (Sergey Shestak/AFP via Getty\nImages)\n\n## Lack of experienced medics\n\nHowever unpleasant it may be, the harrowing scream of the wounded is a\nreassuring factor, the medics say. Worse is if they are silent and slowly\nlosing consciousness.\n\nThe so-called \"golden hour\" window, the first 60 minutes to provide medical\ncare for the best chance of survival, is rarely achieved on the front line.\n\nIt could take hours \u2013 or worse, days \u2013 for the wounded to get to the medics.\n\nIf the wounded are lucky enough to make it to the evacuation point and get\nmedical help, they face other issues, such as strained and sometimes\ninexperienced medics.\n\nA soldier with serious head and eye wounds is seen after an operation at a\nhospital where the military are treated in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Oct. 8,\n2022. (Paula Bronstein/Getty Images)\n\nVitalii, 46, who goes by the call sign King, served as a medic in the 42nd\nSeparate Mechanized Brigade when it was deployed on the northeastern Kreminna\naxis front in June 2023.\n\nThe unit was inexperienced and the casualties were catastrophic, he said. It\nput enormous pressure on the medics, most of whom had some training but no\nreal experience in medicine. Ukraine's Medical Forces confirmed that \"there is\na need for qualified medical personnel\" in the military.\n\nVitalii admitted that he and his fellow medics may have been too slow since\neverything was new to them. They had to take care of up to 300 wounded\nsoldiers on the toughest days. He wasn\u2019t prepared for it \u2013 neither in terms of\nskills, nor mentally.\n\n\"I thought I was stronger,\u201d Vitalii said. \"I wanted to see a psychologist or\njust get wasted (after the shifts).\"\n\nThe lack of experienced medics, especially surgeons who can conduct difficult\nsurgeries in front-line areas, is critical, according to experts and front-\nline medics. They have called for a system encouraging more doctors to join\nthe military to save the wounded.\n\n\"I definitely wasn't ready for this,\" said Vitalii.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\n### Note from the author:\n\nHi, this is Asami Terajima, the author of this article.\n\nThank you for reading our story. I had an idea to write about the brutal\nreality of front-line evacuation after losing a friend, who lived about 30\nminutes after a fatal injury, in November 2023. There were no combat medics\naround, and the roads were too terrible to even attempt an evacuation. I hate\nto think if anything could have changed the reality if the situation was\ndifferent \u2013 but I know there are plenty of such stories across the front line.\n\nTo help the Kyiv Independent tell more stories that would otherwise not be\ntold, please consider supporting us by becoming our member.\n\nAsami Terajima\n\nReporter\n\nAsami Terajima is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent covering the war from the\nfront line.
