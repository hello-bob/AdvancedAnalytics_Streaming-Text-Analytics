Our system operates on linear (RAW) photos, with\n> the (optional) addition of a contextual photo looking in the opposite\n> direction, e.g., using the \"selfie\" camera on a mobile device, which helps\n> disambiguate what should be considered the reflection. The system is trained\n> using synthetic mixtures of real-world RAW images, which are combined using\n> a reflection simulation that is photometrically and geometrically accurate.\n> Our system consists of a base model that accepts the captured photo and\n> optional contextual photo as input, and runs at 256p, followed by an up-\n> sampling model that transforms output 256p images to full resolution. The\n> system can produce images for review at 1K in 6.5 seconds on an iPhone 14\n> Pro. We test on RAW photos that were captured in the field and embody\n> typical consumer photographs.\n\nComments:| 10 pages with 11 pages of supplemental material  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.14414 [cs.CV]  \n(or arXiv:2404.14414v1 [cs.CV] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Eric Kee [view email] [v1] Wed, 28 Feb 2024 19:07:49 UTC (37,709 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Removing Reflections from RAW Photos, by Eric\nKee and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
