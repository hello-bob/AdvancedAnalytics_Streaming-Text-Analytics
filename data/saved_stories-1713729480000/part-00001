Most\nrestaurants don\u2019t allow gig workers like him to use their facilities and\nshopping centers insist they leave their backpacks and helmets outside. \u201cBut\nby doing so we risk getting everything stolen,\u201d the 29-year-old told Rest of\nWorld.\n\nA few months ago, he found a solution to this problem when he discovered a gig\nworkers\u2019 pit stop run by Nippy, an Argentine startup that has built a business\naround the lack of spaces and benefits for workers like Alba Trejo. The\ncompany rents out small storefronts where gig workers can use clean toilets\nand get coffee free of charge \u2014 in exchange for downloading Nippy\u2019s app. Nippy\nmakes money by processing and selling the data workers register on the app to\nfinancial, insurance, and telecommunications companies it has partnered with.\n\nGabriela V\u00e1zquez assists two Rappi delivery riders at Nippy\u2019s rest stop.\n\n\u201cReliable stats about how much income [gig workers are] bringing is hard to\nget,\u201d Ana Abreu, program and community engagement manager at Boost\nAcceleration Camp, a Dominican Republic-based startup incubator and one of\nNippy\u2019s investors, told Rest of World. \u201cThe fact that Nippy has all that data\nis what draws companies [who want to serve gig workers] to it.\u201d\n\nNippy was founded in the Argentine city of C\u00f3rdoba in 2019, and launched three\nyears later with almost $1 million in funding. It now operates four centers in\nArgentina, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic \u2014 home to about 435,000 gig\nworkers altogether.\n\nOver 35,000 workers in these countries have signed up to Nippy\u2019s app and about\nhalf have visited a Nippy center in the past six months, the company\u2019s co-\nfounder and CEO, Diego Amondaray, told Rest of World. Amondaray said the\ncompany is close to becoming profitable and hopes to open three more centers\nin Mexico by 2025.\n\nA worker can access a Nippy rest stop by registering on its app and scanning a\nQR code at the center each time they visit. At the time of registration, the\napp gathers personal data, including email address, place of residence, date\nof birth, and the ID assigned to a worker by each gig platform. Nippy then\nshares a log of anonymized aggregated data with its partners. Some of them\nwill offer gig workers special deals based on their status on a particular\nplatform: For instance, Movistar has discounts on phone plans and Mastercard\nis working on a financial product for gig workers.\n\nWorkers can access Nippy\u2019s rest stops by using its app, which gathers personal\ndata, including email, place of residence, date of birth, and platform IDs.\n\nMost workers who spoke to Rest of World, including Alba Trejo, said they were\nunaware that their data was being shared with third parties. But they are not\nconcerned. Jonathan Alejandro Pablo P\u00e9rez, a gig worker who frequents Nippy\u2019s\ncenter in Mexico City, said he \u201chas no problem with\u201d the company using his\ndata. He wishes the center offered additional services available in its\nArgentina facility, like bicycle repairs.\n\nThe fact that gig workers are willing to give up control over their data in\nexchange for access to a resting spot says a lot about the gig work economy,\nMariel Garc\u00eda\u2013Montes, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology who studies privacy and surveillance technologies, told Rest of\nWorld.\n\n\u201cWorkers delivering food and goods through apps have been failed by the tech\necosystem, the vendors, the end users, and the social security systems,\u201d\nGarc\u00eda-Montes said. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting that a Latin American startup\nbroke the mold by creating spaces where workers can take breaks, or even just\nuse a restroom because everybody else failed to provide these basic work\nrights.\u201d\n\nIn Argentina and the Dominican Republic, Nippy has partnered with Mastercard,\nwhich is planning to launch a financial product for gig workers in the coming\nmonths, Amondaray said. Mastercard did not respond to an interview request\nfrom Rest of World.\n\nAmondaray said the company is also working with the Inter-American Development\nBank and other international entities to help them better understand the gig\nwork economy. \u201cData helps us understand behaviors within the gig economy. This\ncan also help governments better regulate the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the Nippy center in Mexico City, there is space for about 20 gig workers at\na time. Workers can help themselves to tea and coffee, and occasional snacks.\nThe Nippy center is also one of three places where Rappi workers can return\nundelivered items. That was what initially drew Pablo P\u00e9rez to the place.\nBefore it opened its doors last year, delivery workers like him had to drive\nmiles to Rappi\u2019s two centers on the edges of the city to return undelivered\nitems, he told Rest of World.\n\nThe Nippy rest stop is one of only three places where Rappi workers can return\nundelivered items in Mexico City.\n\nRappi closed all of its physical support centers for gig workers in Mexico\nafter the pandemic, and moved its call center to Colombia. The company, which\ncut 6% of its regional workforce in 2020, has refocused its attention on its\nadvertisement business in Mexico: It recently announced a $110 million\ninvestment to boost its ultrafast grocery and food delivery service, promising\ndeliveries in under 10 minutes. The company did not respond to a list of\nquestions from Rest of World.\n\n\u201cRappi comes by each week to sort the returned items. They take back most of\nthem; others, mostly food and perishables, end up being donated or shared here\namong the workers,\u201d Milena Luc\u00eda Mastandrea, operations coordinator at Nippy,\ntold Rest of World. \u201cWe donated a whole turkey to [Alba Trejo] for Christmas.\u201d\n\nSome workers have become regulars at the Nippy center in Mexico City. Gabriela\nV\u00e1zquez, who works as a customer support agent at the center, told Rest of\nWorld they help her move heavy boxes of undelivered items and defend her when\na Rappi worker gets fussy or aggressive.\n\nDelivery rider Diego Bennets visited Nippy\u2019s rest stop for the first time in\nApril and feels fortunate to have a place to stop in between deliveries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not an exclusive Rappi worker support center for gig workers, but they\ndon\u2019t know that,\u201d V\u00e1zquez said. \u201cWe often get Rappi workers who\u2019ve struggled\nfor hours to find online assistance from the company and when they find us,\nthey\u2019re clearly frustrated.\u201d\n\nAmondaray said Nippy has become a reliable partner to platforms like Rappi.\n\u201cThey trust us to host a space where gig workers can go to rest, get a jacket\nor a backpack, or return a failed delivery. [These spaces] help platforms\nreduce costs,\u201d he said.\n\nAs they wait for Rappi to remove debts from returned items on their accounts\nor for their cellphones to charge, workers help themselves to a slice of cake\nwith colleagues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found a safe space,\u201d said Alba Trejo.\n\nDaniela Dib is a Rest of World reporter based in Mexico City.\n\nRead more stories\n\nCreator Economy\n\nIndonesia taps influencers to convince people to move to its new, under-\nconstruction capital\n\nSocial media stars are downplaying fears of deforestation and boredom in\nNusantara.\n\nBy Michelle Anindya\n\nAccess & Connectivity\n\nBangladesh built a tech park for 100,000 workers.
