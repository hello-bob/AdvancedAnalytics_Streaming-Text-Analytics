I\nwanted to answer it not just for the present day (which, as we\u2019ll see, is\nrelatively easy), but for every point in human history.\n\nSome of what follows is grim, I have to warn you. For most of human existence,\nif you were significantly far from all other people, you were probably about\nto die. But nevertheless, you\u2019d have a chance of breaking humanity\u2019s\nLoneliness Record before your impending death!\n\n# Early humanity\n\nBack when there were only 2 humans in the world, every time they got farther\nfrom each other, both of them would simultaneously break the Loneliness\nRecord.\n\nHowever, unless you\u2019re a Biblical literalist, it\u2019s hard to imagine that there\nwas ever a time when only 2 humans existed. Surely Homo sapiens emerged over\nthe course of generations, each composed of beings that, in different ways,\nmore or less resembled modern humans. So it makes more sense to start with the\nfirst migrations out of Africa, between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago. That\u2019s\nwhen the distances start to get interesting.\n\n# Prehistory\n\nAs our ancestors migrated out of central Africa, they pushed into wilderness\nthat was uninhabited by other humans. So we might think that they would have\nhad plentiful opportunities to break the Loneliness Record.\n\nHowever, we tend to travel in groups, especially when we\u2019re going far. And you\ncan\u2019t break the Loneliness Record if you\u2019re traveling in a group. Unless\nthings go terribly wrong.\n\nFor my money, the most likely way for the Loneliness Record to have been\nbroken during this period would be:\n\n  1. A group of travelers sets out.\n  2. They happen to go in a direction away from the rest of humanity.\n  3. They travel far \u2013 farther than anyone would be able to travel alone.\n  4. But then \u2013 uh oh! There\u2019s a rockslide or something, and they all die.\n\nIn this scenario, the last of the travelers to die breaks our Record. Hooray!\n\nAnother way it could have happened is if someone got swept out to sea on a\nlog. Since sailing ships hadn\u2019t been invented yet, there\u2019d be no other humans\nout there.\n\nNow, you might wonder, what about camels? Once humans domesticated the camel,\ncouldn\u2019t they travel much farther over land? Yes! But humans didn\u2019t figure out\nhow to ride camels until about 3000 BC, by which point Austronesian peoples\nhad already, for 15,000 years, been...\n\n# Sailing\n\nSailing ups the ante, because nobody lives in the ocean, and you can get a lot\nfarther sailing a boat than clinging to a log. One of the same issues still\nconfronts us, though: long distance sailing is usually done by groups, not\nindividuals.\n\nIt seems likely that early sailors would have broken the loneliness record\nfrom time to time. Say your ship gets caught in a storm and blown 100 km off\ncourse. Then it sinks. If you\u2019re the last survivor, you might get the dubious\nhonor of breaking humanity\u2019s Loneliness Record. Certainly, you could get a lot\nfarther from other humans by sailing than by walking on land.\n\nOnce sailing started being used for trade, though, one has to imagine that the\nRecord stopped getting broken so much. Advancements in sailing technology\nwould bring distance gains, but they would also bring congestion. If sailing\nships are frequently crossing the sea between nations, then even if you\u2019re\nlucky (?) enough to be the doomed last survivor of a remote shipwreck, there\u2019s\nprobably another ship just over the horizon. So no Loneliness Trophy for you.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t know when the Loneliness Record was broken during this\nperiod or by whom, because there\u2019s no documentation. So let\u2019s talk about the\nfirst era in which I was able to find any solid documentation of a person\nbeing Record-breakingly isolated.\n\n# The age of Antarctic Exploration\n\nFor some reason, people in the early 1900s thought it would be a really fun\nidea to trek to the South Pole. For Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy officer\nand one of the first to make the trip, it was... not.\n\nScott led the Terra Nova expedition, an attempt to reach the South Pole for\nthe first time in human history. But on January 17, 1912, when Scott\u2019s party\ngot to the Pole, they were devastated to find they\u2019d been bested by the\nexpedition of Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. Amundsen had reached the\nSouth Pole just 34 days before Scott.\n\nIf the explorers thought losing the race was bad, they were in for much worse.\nAfter a series of disasters, the entire party perished. Which is a bummer.\nBut, on the bright side, they were 160 km from the rest of humanity when they\nfinally succumbed to the cold. This is the first occurrence I could find of a\nplausible Loneliness Record-setting event with a specific distance and set of\nnames. So congratulations to the Terra Nova expedition!\n\nBut even so, their record didn\u2019t last long, on the historical scale. In 1934,\nRichard E. Byrd, an American Naval officer who had in 1926 made the first\nflight over the South Pole (but that\u2019s not of interest here, since he had a\nco-pilot) operated a small weather station in Antarctica. The station was\ncalled Bolling Advance Base, and it was situated 196 km from the nearest\ninhabited location: Little America II base, on the coast.\n\nEventually, around August of 1934, Byrd stopped sending intelligible radio\ntransmissions back to Little America II. A rescue party was dispatched, which\nfound Byrd near death, suffering from frostbite and carbon monoxide poisoning.\nHe survived to lead several more Antarctic expeditions, and for the rest of\nhis life, he held the record (at least as far as I can tell) for Loneliest\nPerson!\n\nAnd, by the same token, Byrd had become the last person to break the\nLoneliness Record while staying on Earth.\n\n# The final frontier\n\nSpacefaring really changed the scale of the Loneliness Record problem. Now our\nspecies was no longer confined to a 2-dimensional surface.\n\nThe first (human) spacefarer was Comrade Yuri Gagarin of the USSR. He took off\nfrom Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 12, 1961, and traveled in a parabolic orbit\nthat took him 327 km above the surface of the Earth. That\u2019s 131 km farther\nthan Byrd\u2019s weather station. Congratulations, Yuri Gagarin!\n\nGagarin got to hold this record for several years. His space mission, Vostok\n1, had a higher apogee than any other of the 1-crewmember space missions (the\nUSSR\u2019s Vostok program and the USA\u2019s Mercury program). And after those, we\nstopped sending people into space alone.\n\n327 km is pretty far. And since the apogee of Vostok 1\u2019s parabola was over the\nsouth Pacific, Gagarin\u2019s distance from other humans might even have been\nsomewhat greater. So it was eight years before the Loneliness Record was\nbroken again. This time, though, it was utterly smashed, by an order of\nmagnitude.\n\nA little while after Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong descended to the lunar\nsurface on July 24, 1969, Michael Collins (who continued orbiting the moon)\nreached a distance of 3592 km (the Moon\u2019s diameter and change) from his fellow\ntravelers.\n\n### The remaining Apollo missions\n\nNow from here, for Apollos 12\u201317, things are a little fuzzier. A lot depends\non the exact trajectories of the capsules, and I won\u2019t go into it here (but\ncorner me with a pen and a cocktail napkin some time). So I might have made a\nmistake here, even beyond the obvious mistake of embarking on this pointless\nthought experiment in the first place. But, after reviewing the numbers, I\nthink the next Record-breaking event occurred on Apollo 15:\n\nAnd the last time the Loneliness Record was broken was on the Apollo 16\nmission, by Command Module pilot Ken Mattingly:\n\nMy heartfelt congratulations to Ken Mattingly, the World Champion of\nLoneliness!\n\n# History isn\u2019t over... yet!\n\nOne day \u2013 assuming humanity doesn\u2019t somehow burn itself out of existence first\n\u2013 somebody is gonna come for what\u2019s Ken\u2019s.\n\nIn Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s Red Mars, Arkady Bogdanov and Nadia Cherneshevsky\nare among the First Hundred humans to live on Mars. They regularly travel the\nplanet\u2019s empty surface in lighter-than-air craft. Something like that could\nget you a Loneliness Record.\n\nMore likely, the next Record breaker will be the last survivor of some space\nvoyage. On Mars, you can\u2019t get meaningfully more than 6,800 km from any other\npoint. But if you\u2019re on the way to Mars and life support fails, then someone\ngets to break Mattingly\u2019s record by probably several orders of magnitude.\n\nThis article is off the beaten path for my blog, which is usually about\nincident response and site reliability engineering. I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this\npointless endeavor as much as I enjoyed wasting my time putting it together!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\nhistoryhuman historysciencespacespreadsheets\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n# Top Posts\n\n  * The World Record for Loneliness\n  * Do-nothing scripting: the key to gradual automation\n  * The Latency/Throughput Tradeoff: Why Fast Services Are Slow And Vice Versa\n  * Explaining the fire\n  * Clinical troubleshooting: diagnose any production issue, fast.\n\n# Archives\n\n  * May 2024\n  * April 2024\n  * March 2024\n  * February 2024\n  * January 2024\n  * December 2023\n  * August 2023\n  * May 2023\n  * April 2023\n  * March 2023\n  * February 2023\n  * December 2022\n  * November 2022\n  * October 2022\n  * July 2022\n  * June 2022\n  * May 2022\n  * February 2022\n  * December 2021\n  * March 2021\n  * August 2019\n  * July 2019\n  * June 2019\n  * May 2019\n  * March 2019\n  * February 2019\n  * October 2017\n  * July 2017\n  * June 2017\n  * April 2017\n  * September 2016\n  * August 2016\n  * June 2016\n  * March 2016\n  * December 2015\n  * October 2015\n  * July 2015\n  * June 2015\n  * September 2014\n  * August 2014\n  * July 2014\n  * May 2014\n  * October 2013\n  * September 2013\n  * June 2013\n  * May 2013\n  * April 2013\n  * March 2013\n  * December 2012\n  * November 2012\n  * August 2012\n  * July 2012\n\n# Categories\n\n  * Descriptive engineering\n  * incident-response\n  * Mind hacks\n  * Monitoring\n  * Post-mortems\n  * Postgres\n  * Problem-Solving\n  * Statistics and probability\n  * Uncategorized\n  * Workflow\n\n# Meta\n\n  * Register\n  * Log in\n  * Entries feed\n  * Comments feed\n  * WordPress.com\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n## Discover more from Dan Slimmon\n\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\n\nContinue reading\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Dan Slimmon\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
