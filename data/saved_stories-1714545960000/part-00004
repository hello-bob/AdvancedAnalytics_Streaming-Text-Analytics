Subscribers love the opportunity to interact directly\nwith creators and access exclusive content unavailable elsewhere.\n\n## Putting an end to \u201cvideo unavailable\u201d and licensing problems\n\nPatreon offers flexibility when it comes to uploading content from different\nsources, including direct video uploads via URL, from YouTube, or uploads from\nVimeo for Premium or Pro creators. And, because most creators on Patreon focus\non just creating the best exclusive content for their subs and not the\ntechnicalities of building their own video hosting platform, they opt to use\nYouTube or Vimeo, which sounds like a no-brainer.\n\nBut hold your carrots, and let's talk about the fine print, including the\ndreaded \"video unavailable\" message. We know how frustrating it is to get this\nmessage after working hard for several weeks or even months because you got an\naudio license violation.\n\nYouTube, for example, comes with its own set of inconveniences. Sure, it's a\nmassive platform with the most amount of eyeballs, but if not done correctly\nyou can get intrusive ads disrupting your user\u2019s quality of experience. And,\nnot to mention their ever-changing content policies, which seem to become\nstricter and stricter every time you turn around. Then there's Vimeo, with its\nstorage limitations and premium feature paywalls.\n\nUntil now, content creators on Patreon have lacked good video hosting service\noptions to control their content. This turns into platform dependency, putting\nthe creator's valuable business at risk. One wrong move and their content\ncould vanish into a rabbit hole.\n\nLuckily, we\u2019ve found the solution.\n\n## Introducing Bunny Stream integration with Patreon!\n\nWith Bunny Stream, you're in the driver's seat, so you can fully own your\ncontent and say goodbye to the hassle of using the traditional video hosting\nplatforms Vimeo or YouTube. This was possible thanks to our integration\nsupport for Player.js and because we also became an official embed.ly\nprovider.\n\nThe best part: Bunny Stream is easy to use! You upload your masterpiece, and\nwe process your video, including free and customizable adaptive bitrate\ntranscoding up to 4K, along with transcription, translation, watermark,\ncontent tagging, and much, much more. On top of all that, our pre-integrated\nembed player facilitates integration, eliminating the need for technical\nexpertise when looking to expand to other web platforms and services.\n\nHow do you actually upload the video in Patreon? You copy and paste your\nDirect Play URL, located in your Bunny Stream dashboard after we process your\nvideos, into Patreon via the Embed video URL option, and voil\u00e0 \u2014 you're good\nto go!\n\nNow, let's talk about the other benefits of Bunny Stream:\n\n1\\. Ownership and control: You keep full control of your content. No more\nexternal policies and restrictions \u2014 your content, your rules.\n\n2\\.

Integration capabilities: Take your videos beyond Patreon \u2014 and share them\non your website and other platforms.\n\n5\\.
