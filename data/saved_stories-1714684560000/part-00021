Richard Fallon revisits other Owen-inspired fictions \u2014 by R.

Gillot from\nthe cover of an 1870 issue of The Period: An Illustrated Review of What Is\nGoing On \u2014 Source.\n\nRichard Owen, known today for coining the term \u201cdinosaur\u201d and founding\nLondon\u2019s Natural History Museum, was Victorian Britain\u2019s most celebrated\ncomparative anatomist. He was also \u2014 to put it diplomatically \u2014 a divisive\nfigure. Writing in 1851, one of his various scientific nemeses, Thomas Henry\nHuxley, considered it \u201castonishing with what an intense feeling of hatred Owen\nis regarded by the majority of his contemporaries\u201d.^1 Yet, when one of his\nchief admirers, Richard Doddridge (R. D.) Blackmore, based a character in his\nlatest novel on Owen, that character was intended to epitomize the famous\nnaturalist\u2019s \u201ccommon sense, kindness and humility\u201d.^2 Huxley and Blackmore\nwere evidently seeing very different Owens.\n\nWe will return to Blackmore\u2019s intriguing but now largely forgotten novel, The\nRemarkable History of Sir Thomas Upmore, Bart., M.P., Formerly Known as \u201cTommy\nUpmore\u201d (1884), in which Owen is transmuted into the kindly \u201cProfessor\nMegalow\u201d. First, however, it must be asked why the man attracted such variety,\nand intensity, of feeling. In other words, why did so many fellow naturalists\nhate his guts? And why did so many titans of literary culture \u2014 including not\njust Blackmore but also Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, and many\nothers \u2014 find his recondite investigations into zoology and palaeontology so\nprofoundly inspiring?\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\n\u201cDinner in the Iguanodon\u201d.

Illustration after Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins from an\nissue of Illustrated London News that same year \u2014 Source.\n\nOwen rose up from relatively unglamorous family roots in Lancaster, becoming\ncurator, professor, and finally \u2014 in 1842 \u2014 conservator of London\u2019s well-\nstocked Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. Superintendency of\nthe natural history collections of the British Museum followed in 1856. Across\nboth spaces, Owen had access to the finest zoological and palaeontological\ntreasures of the ever-growing and ever-acquisitive British Empire. In addition\nto providing us with the dinosaurs, Owen\u2019s accomplishments included the\nreconstruction of the New Zealand moa and the giant South American ground\nsloth Mylodon, pioneering work on the gorilla, and \u2014 both before and after the\npublication of Charles Darwin\u2019s On the Origin of Species (1859) \u2014 he\npostulated innovative if arcane theories of life\u2019s natural development through\ntime.^3 Museums were his speciality: Owen\u2019s orchestration of the opening of\nthe Natural History Museum in 1881, absorbing scientific collections formerly\nhoused at the British Museum, capped an illustrious career.\n\nNonetheless, Owen\u2019s egotism and inscrutability made him enemies in the\nscientific world from the start. This habit of acquiring adversaries\neventually became a serious problem. In the late 1850s, tensions with the\nrising star Huxley were already foreboding future ill; in 1864, a powerful\ngroup calling itself the X Club formed to take charge of science\u2019s role in\nsociety and stuck a more persistent thorn in Owen\u2019s side. This influential\ngroup of secular scientific naturalists, whose members included Huxley as well\nas Herbert Spencer, stood for much that Owen detested. Their agnosticism and\nnaturalistic interpretation of evolutionary processes \u2014 sometimes understood\nas driven by what Spencer termed \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d, or what Darwin\ncalled \u201cnatural selection\u201d \u2014 were anathema to Owen\u2019s theistic evolutionism, in\nwhich humans represent the apex of God\u2019s providentially unfolding plan.\nCharles Kingsley\u2019s classic children\u2019s story The Water-Babies (1863) memorably\nsatirized one of the most public clashes between Owen and Huxley, in which the\nformer attempted to distance humans biologically from apes, while the latter,\nstressing our humble animal descent, did just the reverse.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nLinley Sambourne depicts opponents Owen (left) and Huxley (right) in an 1885\nedition of Charles Kingsley\u2019s The Water-Babies \u2014 Source.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nOwen dines at the Palaeontographical Society, accompanied by those prehistoric\ncreatures whose fossil bones he knew so intimately. 19th-century lithograph by\nA. Orton after E. C. Rye \u2014 Source.\n\nIn addition to espousing a more compartmentalized view of the relationship\nbetween science and religion than Owen, and a less compartmentalized view of\nthe relationship between humanity and other animals, those naturalists who\ncame to form the X Club distrusted his pervasive influence over scientific\nculture. As such, many opposed his ambitious proposals for a separate Natural\nHistory Museum. Although he got his museum in the end, acolytes of Darwin and\nHuxley wrote much of the subsequent history, creating a caricature of Owen as\na bigoted obscurantist. Notably, Darwin\u2019s statue currently holds pride of\nplace over Owen\u2019s in the latter\u2019s own museum.\n\nOwen, however, enjoyed propagandistic powers of his own. He came to number\nleading politicians and members of the royal family among his intimate friends\nand whipped up excitement for his work in lectures and publications for\ngeneral readers. Particularly integral to his reputation was the notion that\nOwen could identify an animal, even an extinct one, from a single bone. His\nmost sensational feat concerned a broken femur found in New Zealand. When it\nwas presented to Owen in 1839, he declared that this femur belonged to a then-\nunidentified ostrich-like bird. In 1843, further specimens vindicated his\napparently audacious prediction and revealed that New Zealand had, indeed,\nonce been infested by these giant, flightless moa birds, which Owen dubbed\nDinornis. Contemporaries found this story of scientific wizardry utterly\nenchanting. The reality, which Owen\u2019s media machine smothered with increasing\nseverity, was slightly more mundane: John Rule, the surgeon who presented Owen\nwith the femur, had already provided evidence for its avian origin.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nLate in life, holding the famous femur in one hand and caressing a moa in\nanother, Owen relives the high point of his career. Halftone after J. Smit\nafter a photograph, ca. 1877 \u2014 Source.\n\nMost of Owen\u2019s contemporaries, however, knew nothing of John Rule. As his\ncareer thrived in the 1840s, Owen befriended more and more star-studded\nlitterateurs, many of whose works he voraciously consumed in snatches of spare\ntime. This was an era when palaeontological reconstruction, geological time,\nand extinction were thrilling and still relatively novel notions. Pre-\nDarwinian controversies over \u201cdevelopment\u201d (or, to use a more recognisable\nterm, evolution) raged, while the largely Christian community of British\nnaturalists continued to construct sophisticated ways of making sense of\nEarth\u2019s history via liberal interpretation of the Book of Genesis \u2014 and vice\nversa. Owen, for his part, was happy to frame his work (or have others frame\nit) as confirming that even the most apparently monstrous prehistoric\ncreatures were the products of God\u2019s benign design, mysteriously unfolding\nover sublime aeons of deep time.\n\nOwen\u2019s ability to resurrect these strange animals from inadequate materials\nstruck several leading novelists as an apt analogy for their own literary\nmethods. \u201cHow can I tell the feelings in a young lady\u2019s mind; the thoughts in\na young gentleman\u2019s bosom?\u201d asks the narrator of William Makepeace Thackeray\u2019s\nThe Newcomes (1854\u201355). His justification is palaeontological: \u201cAs Professor\nOwen . . . takes a fragment of a bone, and builds an enormous forgotten\nmonster out of it, wallowing in prim\u00e6val quagmires . . . so the novelist puts\nthis and that together: from the footprint finds the foot; from the foot, the\nbrute who trod on it; from the brute, the plant he browsed on, the marsh in\nwhich he swam\u201d.^4 For Thackeray, this quasi-scientific pedigree \u2014 not entirely\nproposed in jest \u2014 was gratifying, implying as it did that his gigantic works\nwere painstakingly researched and planned.\n\nDickens was even closer to Owen. His periodicals, including Household Words,\npublished Owen\u2019s articles and promoted the naturalist\u2019s ideas, from his moa\nmythmaking to his esoteric concept of the ideal \u201carchetype\u201d underlying all\nvertebrate forms. Nor did Dickens\u2019 novels escape his friend\u2019s osseous\ninfluence. Direct reference to Owen in Our Mutual Friend (1864\u201365) is\nadmittedly limited to a droll description of the complacent Mrs Podsnap, a\n\u201cfine woman for Professor Owen\u201d possessing \u201cquantity of bone, neck and\nnostrils like a rocking-horse\u201d; nonetheless, as literary scholars like Gowan\nDawson have shown, an Owenian language of palaeontological reassembly pervades\nthis last of Dickens\u2019 completed novels.^5 Not least in scenes including the\nbone collector Mr Venus and the wooden-legged Silas Wegg, the question of\nconjuring the whole from the part comes to symbolize, as in Thackeray\u2019s The\nNewcomes, the task of the Victorian serial novelist, who must prove that\nisolated fragments are all integral contributions to a harmonious and\ninsightful end product.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nSatirical lithograph dating roughly to the 1840s: in a parody of the dagger\nscene in Macbeth, the dreaming palaeontologist is visited by creatures that he\nhas perhaps, in waking life, striven to reconstruct \u2014 Source.\n\nThackeray and Dickens were just two of the famous authors who extolled Owen in\nhis glory days. In 1884, R. D. Blackmore \u2014 to return, as promised, to Sir\nThomas Upmore \u2014 gave Owen, in the form of \u201cProfessor Megalow\u201d, a more\nprominent role than any author of fiction had ever attempted before, and at a\ntime when the man himself was passing out of fashion. Although he only retired\nfrom the Natural History Museum the previous year, Owen\u2019s scientific authority\nhad been besieged for decades. Alienating Darwin and X Clubbers like Huxley\nhad resulted in him being sidelined from many cutting-edge evolutionary\ndiscussions of later Victorian science, even if Owen continued to publish\nelaborate, lavishly illustrated zoological and palaeontological \u201cmemoirs\u201d and\nmonographs.\n\nThe two Richards \u2014 Owen and Blackmore \u2014 were fast friends (and fellow chess\naficionados), living not far from each other in what is now the London Borough\nof Richmond upon Thames. Blackmore had previously shot to fame with Lorna\nDoone: A Romance of Exmoor (1869), a historical romance set in the seventeenth\ncentury which remains in print today.^6 Sir Thomas Upmore, which stands out\namong the author\u2019s otherwise substantially rural literary oeuvre, has not\nenjoyed similar success, and the reasons are not far to seek. The Saturday\nReview\u2019s critic called it \u201cneither allegory nor novel, neither satire nor\nromance, but a mixture \u2013 not altogether a successful mixture \u2013 of all four\u201d.^7\nDespite, or because of, this generic confusion, it is highly interesting to a\npresent-day reader.\n\nThe titular character of Blackmore\u2019s allegorico-romantico-satirico novel, like\nmany fellow Victorian narrators, undertakes an upwardly mobile journey to\ngentlemanliness. The son of a soap manufacturer, young Tommy Upmore courts\nLaura, the beautiful daughter of Lady Twentifold of Twentifold Towers. To win\nthe respect of the aristocratic Laura\u2019s politically-obsessed brother, Roland,\nhe must also win a seat as Conservative MP and fight off the onslaughts of\nLiberals pursuing a dramatic reform agenda. What distinguishes this novel from\ncomparable realist works is its highly fantastic element: due to his body\u2019s\nabnormal density, Tommy can fly, or rather float. At the end of the novel, he\nliterally rises up above the party-political din in the House of Commons to\nunite Britain\u2019s politicians in nationalistic fervour.\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nWatercolour by Ernest Griset depicting Richard Owen (seated) and the\nmineralogist Bryce Wright, ca. 1873 \u2014 Source.\n\nDespite its protagonist\u2019s ability to float above divisions, Sir Thomas Upmore\nis hardly a conciliatory novel. Although not as diehard a Tory as Roland,\nTommy is shocked at the radical progressive reforms proposed by their Liberal\nfoes (led by the smooth-talking Panclast): \u201cgrand measures were being\nprepared, for a fine subversion of established things; Liberal statesmen being\nquite convinced by their own condition, that the universe was wrong\u201d.^8 Their\nnefarious plans include the abolition of land ownership, the secession of\nBritain\u2019s strategic and colonial territories, and even the restitution of\nplundered artefacts. In addition to swiping at socialists and anarchists,\nBlackmore caricatured the reforming aims of prime minister W. E. Gladstone\u2019s\nLiberal government, in power since 1880. In the eyes of the Saturday Review,\nthe novel\u2019s Panclast was \u201cas like Mr. Gladstone as one pea is like another\u201d.^9\n\nScience is central to the novel\u2019s conservative political intervention.\nBlackmore skewers \u201cProfessor Brachipod\u201d and the collective of evolutionists\nbrought in to investigate Tommy\u2019s remarkable floating abilities. Insensitive\nto the boy\u2019s feelings and quick to speculate baselessly about the origin of\nhis powers, these \u201cscientists\u201d \u2014 a neologism Blackmore accompanies with scare\nquotes to indicate his distaste \u2014 are impious champions of scientific\nnaturalism, like those men comprising the X Club. Blackmore\u2019s targets are\nindicated not just by the scientists\u2019 menacing association with vivisection,\nbut also when they help overthrow the traditional classical curriculum of\nTommy\u2019s school, replacing it with a new, scientistic syllabus. Both the\nnecessity of vivisection and the need for scientific instruction to accompany\n\u2014 or even replace \u2014 classical education, were standard talking points for men\nsuch as Huxley.\n\nIf Tommy mocks his scientific teachers\u2019 incompetence in the field of ancient\nGreek and Latin, patrician Lady Twentifold is concerned by something deeper:\nthe apparent atheism of the modern approaches to science they promulgate. \u201cWho\nbrought up this tree?\u201d she asks, gesturing to a grand oak. While some, Tommy\nobserves, would say \u201cNature\u201d, \u201cScience\u201d, or \u201cAccident\u201d, she prefers to say\n\u201cthat the Almighty made it so\u201d.^10 Luckily for both, a more positive model for\nthe scientific practitioner is at hand: Professor Megalow, \u201cwhose name shall\nnever be out-rubbed by time\u201d, and whose face, when Tommy first encounters it,\nappears \u201cthe kindest and grandest I had ever seen\u201d.^11\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nPhotomechanical portrait of Richard Owen, ca. 1880s \u2014 Source.\n\nMegalow is nothing like Brachipod (or their equally oddly named colleagues\nJargoon, Chocolous, and Mullicles). A devout Christian, softly spoken,\nreluctant to construct premature hypotheses, and uninterested in fame or\nlucre, he dispenses wisdom to Tommy throughout the latter\u2019s career. That\nBlackmore intended to flatter his friend is undeniable: he even wrote to Owen,\nasking permission to do so. Megalow was meant to be so recognisable \u201cthat the\npublic . . . will exclaim at once \u2018this must be Professor Owen\u2019\u201d.^12\n\nAs the title of an early chapter indicates, Megalow understands \u201cTrue\nScience\u201d. He is Blackmore\u2019s ideal scientific practitioner, albeit one at odds\nwith the times. \u201cEven upon subjects, he understands more thoroughly than any\nother man yet born\u201d, Tommy observes, Megalow \u201cspeaks (when he does speak at\nall) with more doubt, and diffidence, and humility, than a school-girl does,\nwho knows nothing about it, except from one of his own books\u201d.^13 Tommy\u2019s old\nschoolmaster, the classics-obsessed Dr Rumbelow, calls him \u201ca genuine acolyte\nof that glorious sage, Pythagoras\u201d.^14 Himself an enthusiast and one-time\ntutor of classical literature, as well as a conservative in both politics and\nreligion, Blackmore represented Owen as a reassuring and responsible steward\nof the era\u2019s dramatic scientific advances.\n\nMegalow\u2019s standout scene takes place when Tommy and Laura help him to excavate\na \u201cDeino-Saurian\u201d from a cliff face. It is tempting to suggest that this set\npiece reflects a growing interest in dinosaurs, catalysed by fossils unearthed\nin the United States during the 1870s and 1880s, including Brontosaurus and\nStegosaurus. Owen himself, after all, had coined \u201cdinosaur\u201d back in 1842 and\nMegalosaurus was even one of the creatures included in his definition. For\nmost of the nineteenth century, however, general audiences were surprisingly\nindifferent to the term \u201cdinosaur\u201d and Blackmore\u2019s pedantic spelling suggests\nthat the fossil is to be understood as some rather obscure animal. An arguably\nmore pertinent reference point here is the moa: just as Owen had, according to\nthe myth, predicted the form of the moa and been vindicated years later, the\n\u201cDeino-Saurian\u201d discovery acts as \u201ctangible proof\u201d of Megalow\u2019s \u201cinductions,\npublished in a treatise ten years ago\u201d.^15\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.\n\nOwen\u2019s life-like restoration of Megalosaurus, one of the gigantic extinct\ncreatures he included in his category \u201cDinosauria\u201d and the origin of the name\nof Blackmore\u2019s \u201cProfessor Megalow\u201d.

G. Lewis after T. J. Barker of notables\ngathered at Buckingham Palace. Gladstone (left, seated) gestures to a military\ntreaty, while Owen (right, with Dickens at his left shoulder), examines an\ninvention \u2014 Source.\n\nStrikingly, Megalow\u2019s method is presented as a third way not just in science\nbut also in the era\u2019s polarized politics. In an otherwise polemical and\nreactionary novel, Megalow\u2019s Liberal \u2014 and worse, \u201cRad\u201d (Radical) \u2014 allegiance\nis repeatedly stressed. As the ultra-Tory Roland thunders, \u201c[how] can such a\ngreat man as the Professor ever have become a Liberal?\u201d^16 Indeed, while far\nfrom being a revolutionary, the real Owen\u2019s early career had been steeped in\nthe liberal Conservatism of reformist prime minister Robert Peel, who even\ncommissioned a painting of Owen to hang in his country seat, Drayton Manor. In\nlater decades, the Liberal doyen Gladstone himself became a major ally in\nOwen\u2019s quest to establish the Natural History Museum, as well as supplementing\nthe ageing anatomist\u2019s pension and array of titles.\n\nAdmittedly, Tommy\u2019s tolerance for his mentor\u2019s inconvenient political beliefs\nis enabled by the latter\u2019s reluctance to act upon them: Megalow \u201cwas not at\nall a partisan, or active politician, but quietly held his opinions, upon\nreasons which satisfied him, and therefore cannot have been weak ones\u201d.^17\nAttempting conciliation, Tommy concludes that the party governing Britain,\n\u201c[w]hether it be Radical, or Tory, matters little to the average Englishman;\nso long as it acts with courage, candour, common sense, and consistency\u201d.^18\n(And, presumably, doesn\u2019t meddle with landowners or the country\u2019s colonial\npossessions.)\n\nSir Thomas Upmore is a fascinating and bizarre text (and, as readers will have\nnoticed, an excellent repository of Victorian character names, including those\nof Tommy\u2019s father Bucephalus, his friend Bill Chumps, and the formidable Lord\nGrando Crushbill). Far more so than its young leads and their somewhat\nperfunctory romance, Professor Megalow lingers with us as the novel\u2019s most\ncompelling character. A modest master of rarefied induction, and unwilling to\npursue scientific theories with disruptive social consequences, he represents\na safe pair of hands to usher in scientific modernity. This was something of\nthe impression Blackmore absorbed in conversation with his accomplished\nfriend, Owen, making Sir Thomas Upmore one of the century\u2019s greatest love\nletters to one of its most controversial men of science.\n\nNotes\n\n  1.

In subsequent decades, American discoveries \u2014 including\nBrontosaurus and Triceratops \u2014 proved that these so-called \u201cterrible lizards\u201d\nwere in fact hardly lizards at all. Unlike previous scholars, who have focused\non displays in American museums, Richard Fallon argues that literature was\ncritical in turning these extinct creatures into cultural icons. Popular\nauthors skillfully related dinosaurs to wider concerns about empire, progress,\nand faith; some of the most prominent, like Arthur Conan Doyle and Henry\nNeville Hutchinson, also disparaged elite scientists, undermining distinctions\nbetween scientific and imaginative writing. The rise of the dinosaurs thus\naccompanied fascinating transatlantic controversies about scientific\nauthority.\n\nMore Info and Buy\n\nPublisher\u2019s Website\n\nBookshop.org (US)\n\nBookshop.org (UK)\n\nAmazon (US)\n\n  * Richard Owen: Biology without Darwin\n\nBy Nicolaas Rupke\n\nIn the mid-1850s, no scientist in the British Empire was more visible than\nRichard Owen. But, a century and a half later, Owen remains largely obscured\nby the shadow of the most famous Victorian naturalist of all, Charles Darwin.\nWith this innovative biography, Nicolaas A. Rupke resuscitates Owen's\nreputation. Arguing that Owen should no longer be judged by the evolution\ndispute that figured in only a minor part of his work, Rupke stresses context,\nemphasizing the importance of places and practices in the production and\nreception of scientific knowledge.\n\nMore Info and Buy\n\nPublisher\u2019s Website\n\nBookshop.org (US)\n\nBookshop.org (UK)\n\nAmazon (US)\n\nThe Public Domain Review receives a small percentage commission from sales\nmade via the links to Bookshop.org (10%) and Amazon (4.5%).
