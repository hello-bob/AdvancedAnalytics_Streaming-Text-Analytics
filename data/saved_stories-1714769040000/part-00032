Founded by Thomas Schulz, Solaris is one of three\norganizations seeking to create a tech-focused zone called City Campus, which\nwould encompass Alamo Square, the Lower Haight and Hayes Valley, as earlier\nreported by the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nOther Solaris backers listed on the site included Caffeinated Capital, Eric\nWu, Homebrew and Form Capital. None of the funders responded to requests for\ncomment about Srinivasan\u2019s involvement or his statements about banning\nDemocrats. Corporate records show they collectively invested $2 million in a\nSchulz-led Delaware corporation called Together Casa, Inc., in 2021. It\u2019s\nunclear whether Solaris Society is an offshoot of Together Casa or a separate\nentity.\n\nOn April 30, the Chronicle revealed the project\u2019s existence in a story\nheadlined \u201cMysterious fliers are pitching a utopian \u2018city campus\u2019 in part of\nS.F. What is going on?\u201d Sometime between April 21 and April 30, when the\nChronicle story published its story, the Solaris Society\u2019s website underwent a\nmajor overhaul \u2014 with all mentions of Srinivasan and his fellow backers\nexpunged. Instead, the Solaris Society now markets itself as Solaris AI, \u201can\noffice for AI startups,\u201d backed by, among others, Open AI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nSrinivasan has been outspoken in presenting his vision for replacing current\ncommunities with new forms of tech-run societies, going so far as to document\nthem in a free-to-download book called \u201cThe Network State: How to Start a New\nCountry.\u201d\n\nAlongside the Solaris Society, the tech-funded groups Neighborhood SF and the\nCommons SF, which specialize in creating community spaces, are also behind the\nCity Campus.\n\nA map on the City Campus Real Estate website shows the project\u2019s target zone.\n\nIn an email, one of the City Campus project\u2019s leaders denied any connection to\nSrinivasan or the Network State.\n\n\u201cCity Campus isn\u2019t affiliated with the Network State or funded by Balaji,\u201d\nsaid Jason Benn, the founder of Neighborhood SF, which has been working to\ncreate co-living houses and \u201creproduce the vibes of a university campus\u201d in\nSan Francisco since 2021. \u201cAll of our projects [The Commons, Solaris and The\nNeighborhood] are separate from City Campus.\u201d\n\nThe City Campus website says otherwise: \u201cThe Commons, Solaris, and The\nNeighborhood are coming together to build a walkable city campus in the heart\nof SF \u2013 Hayes, Alamo & Duboce.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Benn gave a presentation about his Neighborhood SF project at\nSrinivasan\u2019s official Network State conference last October, during which\nspeakers detailed the progress being made on Network State projects. At the\nconference, Benn described his mission as helping to \u201cstart autonomous\ncommunities and hangout spots\u201d and said that 150 people had already been\ninspired to move to what he calls \u201cthe best\u201d one-square-mile area \u201cin the\nwhole Bay Area.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Benn, a former software engineer who has lived in San Francisco\nfor 11 years, described a vision different from Srinivasan\u2019s. \u201cOur goal isn\u2019t\nto exit society or build gated communities. It\u2019s the opposite: We want to\nbuild more bridging communities. As Robert Putnam says, bridging social\ncapital creates strong democracies. We\u2019d like to collaborate with the City and\nour neighbors, if possible \u2014 why else would we put up flyers? \u2014 and make SF\nfeel like a 15 minute city for friendship for as many people as possible.\u201d He\ndescribed the project as a \u201cnonprofit public good.\u201d\n\nY Combinator CEO Garry Tan, currently leading a tech-funded effort to win\ncontrol of City Hall, also participated in the October conference. In a\nconversation with Srinivasan during the conference, he outlined his efforts to\n\u201creplace\u201d parts of the city\u2019s \u201cpolitical machine\u201d and build \u201cparallel\neducation, nonprofits, media [and] unions.\u201d The discussion had the feel of a\nTED Talk, with no resemblance to Srinivasan\u2019s explosive interview on the\n\u201cMoment of Zen\u201d podcast.\n\nThrough a spokesman,Tan declined to comment on Srinivasan\u2019s remarks about\npushing Democrats out of the city. \u201cMr. Tan is a Democrat,\u201d said Sam Singer,\nthe spokesman.\n\nThe revision of the Solaris Society\u2019s website is not reflected on the personal\nwebsite of Solaris Society founder Thomas Shulz. As of May 2, it still listed\nSrinivasan as a \u201cfunder\u201d of the company and lists other Network State\nprojects, like a Peter Thiel-backed idea for a new city on the Mediterranean\ncalled Praxis, as \u201csimilar and inspiring\u201d to his own effort.\n\nSchulz, Srinivasan and his fellow Solaris Society backers did not respond to\nrequests for comment about the company\u2019s relationship to the Network State\n\n## Srinivasan talks about his views in a four-hour podcast interview\n\n\u201cYou know that there\u2019s something called De-Ba\u2019athification,\u201d said Srinivasan\nduring that four-hour appearance on the \u201cMoment of Zen\u201d podcast in September,\nreferring to Iraq\u2019s purge of members of Saddam Hussein\u2019s Ba\u2019ath party after\nhis overthrow. \u201cDe-Nazification after World War II, right? Lustration was the\nequivalent in communist countries where former communists were drummed out.\nDe-Blueification is the goal. Blues out, right?\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Srinivasan \u2014 a Stanford University graduate and former\npartner at Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm \u2014 called for\n\u201csomething like tech Zionism\u201d and envisioned a future in which members of a\ntech-aligned group he calls the \u201cGray tribe\u201d amass enough property and capture\nenough power to \u201cliterally have like the sovereign city of San Francisco and\nsecede effectively\u201d from California and the United States.\n\nHe imagined a \u201cGray Pride Parade\u201d in which tech workers in gray T-shirts\nemblazoned with logos for Elon Musk or Y Combinator would march through the\ncity, accompanied by police and \u201cdrones flying overhead in formation.\u201d He also\nrecommended building public monuments to commemorate victims of crimes that\nwould be blamed on Democratic policies. And he suggested renaming city streets\nto honor tech figures.\n\n## A \u2018Scenius\u2019\n\nFor his part, Benn has launched City Campus Real Estate, a special real estate\ncompany focused on housing in the proposed tech zone, which is largely located\nin District 5. The company aims to create what Benn calls a \u201cscenius\u201d\u2014 a\nportmanteau of the words \u201cscene\u201d and \u201cgenius\u201d \u2014 \u201cso that our kids can grow up\nsurrounded by caring and inspiring adults.\u201d A map on the company\u2019s website\nindicates that City Campus\u2019 target area also includes Buena Vista, Corona\nHeights, Duboce Triangle, Haight-Ashbury, Mint Hill, Panhandle and North of\nPanhandle. The company\u2019s website says that it will put 10 percent of its\nprofits to City Campus, which will reinvest the money into acquiring more\nterritory.\n\nCity Campus plans to officially launch on May 11, according to the Chronicle,\nand its founders depict it as a \u201cwalkable campus\u201d where residents can \u201cmeet\ninspiring collaborators,\u201d \u201clive near friends\u201d and \u201craise kids in community.\u201d\n\nDistrict 5 Supervisor Dean Preston, a main target of Tan\u2019s tech-funded\ncampaign, called the City Campus concept \u201cconcerning\u201d in an area already\n\u201cdevastated by racist redevelopment and mass displacement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI encourage those interested in this \u2018campus\u2019 to get to know their neighbors,\nrather than becoming part of an enterprise that seeks to displace them,\u201d he\nadded.\n\nPlans for City Campus came to light after the group taped posters advertising\nthe project to utility poles in Hayes Valley and the Lower Haight. This, too,\nechoes Srinivasan\u2019s playbook for Gray takeover of municipal land. In his\npodcast interview, Srinivasan talked about the need to put up signs or flags\nto mark the Grays\u2019 territory, and he likened the conflict between Grays and\nBlues to the rivalry between the Crips and Bloods gangs.\n\n\u201cA flag signifies control of territory,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not taken down, it\nindicates you control the territory, especially the longer it stays up,\nright?\u201d\n\nOn April 30, Schulz posted a photo on X of a green phoenix symbol \u2014 the\nofficial Solaris logo \u2014 stenciled onto a San Francisco sidewalk.\n\n\u201cSpotted,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhen this reporter replied to his tweet by asking him to respond to questions\nabout Srinivasan\u2019s involvement, he replied \u201cdecline to comment.\u201d\n\n> Spotted pic.twitter.com/3nYl1FO6d7\n>\n> \u2014 Thomas Schulz (@thomasschulzz) April 30, 2024\n\nGil Duran is a freelance journalist and co-founder of the FrameLab Newsletter.\nHe wrote a longer piece about Srinivasan for The New Republic\n\n## Latest news:\n\n### For your eyes only\n\nby Walter Mackins May 3, 2024, 6:00 amApril 30, 2024, 9:59 am\n\n### \u2018I\u2019m a victim of rape\u2019: Frank talk at San Francisco Dems\u2019 sexual\nmisconduct meeting\n\nby Joe Rivano Barros May 2, 2024, 10:42 pmMay 3, 2024, 4:56 am\n\n### Celebrating a Capoeira Queen at San Francisco\u2019s Z Space\n\nby Andrew Gilbert May 2, 2024, 9:31 pmMay 2, 2024, 9:32 pm\n\nWait!
