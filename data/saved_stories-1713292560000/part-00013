Some of these references are from ancient texts. In\nother cases, they are attempts to tie an eclipse with a historical event. The\npurpose of this web page is to present eclipse calculations for many such\neclipses mentioned in the literature.\n\nThe inclusion of an historical event in the tables below does not imply\nvalidation of the historical event nor its connection with an eclipse. Some\nevents may be either apocryphal or fictional, or an eclipse may be incorrectly\nassociated with a particular event. The eclipse maps and calculations are\nsimply presented so that they may be compared with references in the\nliterature. It is left to the reader to evaluate whether the eclipse\nassociation is valid or not.\n\nThe following two tables list solar eclipses identified with some historical\nevent of note. When selected, each Calendar Date links to a global map of\nEarth showing the region of visibility for that eclipse. The path of the\nMoon's penumbral shadow covers the region of partial eclipse, while the track\nof the umbral shadow defines the path of total or annular eclipse. These\nfigures are described in greater detail in the Key to Solar Eclipse Maps. Each\nfigure is stored as a PDF file.\n\nThe column labeled Eclipse Type links to a dynamic Google map with the eclipse\npath plotted on it. You can scroll and zoom in to any part of the eclipse\npath. If you click on a location, an marker will be plotted that gives the\neclipse circumstances at that position. Markers can be dragged around with the\nmouse and the eclipse circumstances are automatically updated.\n\nThe column labeled Central Duration gives the greatest duration of the\neclipse. It links to a table of eclipse path coordinates that permit the\nplotting the track on higher detail maps.\n\nThe last column gives the historical reference for each eclipse. Additional\nsources and/or literary references to many of these eclipses may be found at:\n\n####\n\nAncient and Early Medieval Eclipses in European Sources\n\nEclipse Quotations\n\nThe references at the bottom of this page provide additional information on\nsolar eclipses of historical interest. Visit Solar Eclipses for Beginners for\na basic primer on eclipses of the Sun. A complementary web page Lunar Eclipses\nof Historical Interest is also available.\n\nThis web site is a work in progress. If you know of an historic eclipse of\ninterest, please email the date and a little information or reference about\nthe event to fred.espenak@nasa.gov. I will generate a map for the eclipse and\nadd it to this page.\n\nSolar Eclipses: 2000 BCE to 1 BCE[3]  \n---  \nCalender Date| Eclipse Type| Saros Series| Ecl. Mag.

For annular eclipses, the eclipse magnitude is always less than 1. For\ntotal eclipses, the eclipse magnitude is always greater than or equal to 1.\nFor both annular and total eclipses, the value listed is actually the ratio of\ndiameters between the Moon and the Sun.\n\n[2] Central Duration is the duration of a total or annular eclipse at Greatest\nEclipse. Greatest Eclipse is the instant when the axis of the Moon's shadow\npasses closest to Earth's center.\n\n[3] BCE and CE are abbreviations for \"Before Common Era\" and \"Common Era,\"\nrespectively. They are the secular equivalents to the BC and AD dating\nconventions.

The Moon's coordinates are based on the\nELP-2000/82 theory [Chapront-Touze and Chapront, 1983]. For more information,\nsee: Solar and Lunar Ephemerides. The revised value used for the Moon's\nsecular acceleration is n-dot = -25.858 arc-sec/cy*cy, as deduced from the\nApollo lunar laser ranging experiment (Chapront, Chapront-Touze, and Francou,\n2002).\n\nThe largest uncertainty in the eclipse predictions is caused by fluctuations\nin Earth's rotation due primarily to tidal friction of the Moon. The resultant\ndrift in apparent clock time is expressed as \u0394T and is determined as follows:\n\n  1. pre-1950's: \u0394T calculated from empirical fits to historical records derived by Morrison and Stephenson (2004)\n  2. 1955-present: \u0394T obtained from published observations\n  3. future: \u0394T is extrapolated from current values weighted by the long term trend from tidal effects\n\nA series of polynomial expressions have been derived to simplify the\nevaluation of \u0394T for any time from -1999 to +3000. The uncertainty in \u0394T over\nthis period can be estimated from scatter in the measurements.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nThe data presented here are based on predictions published in:\n\n## Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000 (NASA\nTP-2006-214141) Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000\n(NASA TP-2009-214174)\n\nSpecial thanks to National Space Club summer intern Wesley Ripley for his\nassistance in updating and expanding this web page (July 2008).\n\nPermission is freely granted to reproduce this data when accompanied by an\nacknowledgment:\n\n\"Eclipse Predictions by Fred Espenak, NASA's GSFC\"\n\n## Return to: NASA Solar Eclipse Page\n\n  * Home\n  * Solar Eclipses\n  * Lunar Eclipses\n  * Transits\n  * Resources\n\n  * \\+ Heliophysics Science Division, Code 670 NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA\n  * \\+ Privacy Policy and Important Notices\n\n  * Website Manager: Robert.M.Candey@nasa.gov\n  * Responsible NASA Official: Michael S.
