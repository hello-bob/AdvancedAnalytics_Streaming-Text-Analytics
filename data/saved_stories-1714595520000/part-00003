Credit:\nDake Kang/AP via Alamy\n\nThe first person to publicly release the genome sequence of the virus that\ncauses COVID-19 \u2014 virologist Zhang Yongzhen \u2014 appears to have resolved a\npublic dispute with the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SPHCC), Fudan\nUniversity, that erupted last week.\n\nZhang had been photographed camping outside his laboratory from Sunday, after\nthe SPHCC closed the lab.\n\nThe SPHCC did not respond to Nature\u2019s request to comment but has released\npublic statements saying the laboratory was one of several that needed\nrenovations \u2014 and that it provided Zhang\u2019s team with an alternative space.\n\nAccording to social media posts on Zhang\u2019s personal Weibo account, the\ninstitute gave the research team two days to leave but the SPHCC did not\ninitially specify where they should relocate. Later, Zhang said officials told\nhis team to move to a lab that did not have the necessary biosafety conditions\nto store their samples, which contain unknown pathogens. Zhang\u2019s lab is a\nbiosafety level 3 laboratory.\n\nZhang said he had been sleeping outside his laboratory, even in the rain. The\nsocial media posts include photos of him lying under blankets.\n\nZhang told Nature on Monday that his situation was \u201cterrible\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I have experienced,\u201d he said, but declined to comment\nfurther.\n\nAccording to the social media account of Chen Yanmei, a virologist at the\nSPHCC, and a member of Zhang\u2019s team, their students\u2019 incomplete experiments\nwere now \u201cimpossible to save\u201d. Chen's social media also said she was camping\nout, but inside the lab. Chen, too, declined to be interviewed by Nature.\n\nBut by late Tuesday night, Zhang said in a post that a tentative agreement had\nbeen reached with the SPHCC to resume normal research activity in the\nlaboratory. The post states that Zhang will work with the centre to relocate\nthe laboratory and restart research.\n\n## Virus sequence\n\nIn 2020, Zhang was the first scientist \u2014 together with Edward Holmes, a\nvirologist at the University of Sydney in Australia \u2014 to share the genome of\nSARS-CoV-2 with the world on the website virological.org. That act is widely\ncredited as a key factor enabling the swift development of vaccines against\nCOVID-19.\n\nSince 2020, Zhang has received international acclaim. That year, Zhang\nfeatured in Nature\u2019s 10 \u2014 an annual list of people behind key developments in\nscience, and in 2022 he was awarded the Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum\nKnowledge Award, which carries a US$1 million bursary.\n\nNature\u2019s 10: ten people who helped shape science in 2020\n\nBut Holmes, a long-time collaborator of Zhang\u2019s, says that since 2020, Zhang\u2019s\nresearch output has dwindled. Before 2020, Zhang had an extensive research\nnetwork and would collect samples of animals and people to study viral\nevolution, says Holmes. But since 2020, Zhang\u2019s work has largely involved\nanalysing previously collected samples and Holmes\u2019s own collaboration with\nZhang is less prolific. \u201cHe drove that collaboration but there is nothing to\ncollaborate on now; he hasn\u2019t been able to get any data,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cAll I\ncan do is offer support from afar.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Dimensions database, Zhang co-authored 5 research articles in\n2018, 9 in 2019 and 18 in 2020. But that growing publication rate dropped to 3\nin 2021 and 4 in 2022. Zhang co-authored 6 articles in 2023, none of which\ncontained original data.\n\nHolmes believes the lab closure is part of an effort to sideline Zhang for\nunauthorized sharing of data. \u201cIt is heartbreaking to watch,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is\nunfathomable to me to have a scientist of that calibre sleeping outside his\nlab.\u201d\n\n## International star\n\nBut Yanzhong Huang, a specialist in Chinese health policy at the Council on\nForeign Relations in New York City, says the true nature of the dispute and\nprotest are \u201cshrouded in mystery\u201d.\n\nFan Xiaohong, a physician who heads the SPHCC told reporters for Chinese\nnewspaper Southern Weekly that Zhang\u2019s contract had expired, but he had\nrefused to leave. A post on Zhang\u2019s social media said that although his own\ncontract with SPHCC had formally ended in 2023, members of his team had\nrenewed their contracts with the hospital, and the laboratory is still owed\nfunding.\n\nEven without clarity on the details of the dispute, Dali Yang, a researcher\nwho studies politics in China at the University of Chicago, says it\u2019s\nconcerning that Zhang is sleeping outside his lab. \u201cMany people who know about\nhim are aghast because he is truly an international star,\u201d says Yang.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01293-0\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Nature\u2019s 10: ten people who helped shape science in 2020\n\n  * COVID-origins study links raccoon dogs to Wuhan market: what scientists think\n\n  * Scientists struggle to probe COVID\u2019s origins amid sparse data from China\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Politics\n  * Virology\n  * SARS-CoV-2\n\n## Latest on:\n\nSupport communities that will lose out in the energy transition\n\nEditorial 01 MAY 24\n\nWhy doing science is difficult in India today\n\nWorld View 30 APR 24\n\nCanadian science gets biggest boost to PhD and postdoc pay in 20 years\n\nNews 17 APR 24\n\nScientists tried to give people COVID \u2014 and failed\n\nNews 01 MAY 24\n\nBird flu virus has been spreading among US cows for months, RNA reveals\n\nNews 27 APR 24\n\nBird flu in US cows: is the milk supply safe?\n\nNews Explainer 25 APR 24\n\nScientists tried to give people COVID \u2014 and failed\n\nNews 01 MAY 24\n\nWHO redefines airborne transmission: what does that mean for future pandemics?\n\nNews 24 APR 24\n\nWhat toilets can reveal about COVID, cancer and other health threats\n\nNews Feature 17 APR 24\n\nSupport communities that will lose out in the energy transition\n\nEditorial 01 MAY 24\n\nWhy doing science is difficult in India today\n\nWorld View 30 APR 24\n\nCanadian science gets biggest boost to PhD and postdoc pay in 20 years\n\nNews 17 APR 24\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * #### Director, NLM\n\nVacancy Announcement Department of Health and Human Services National\nInstitutes of Health DIRECTOR, NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE THE POSITION:...\n\nBethesda, Maryland\n\nNational Library of Medicine - Office of the Director\n\n  * #### Call for postdoctoral fellows in Molecular Medicine, Nordic EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine\n\nThe Nordic EMBL Partnership is seeking postdoctoral fellows for collaborative\nprojects in molecular medicine through the first NORPOD call.\n\nHelsinki, Finland\n\nNordic EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine\n\n  * #### Associate or Senior Editor (microbial genetics, evolution, and epidemiology)\n\nwe\u2019re seeking an editor who has a critical eye, a deep understanding of their\nsubject and interests beyond, and who can think on their feet.\n\nLondon, New York, Philadelphia or Pune \u2013 Hybrid working model.\n\nSpringer Nature Ltd\n\n  * #### Professor\n\nDescription test\n\nBerlin (DE)\n\nSpringer Nature Group\n\n  * #### Postdoctoral Associate- Molecular Cell Biology\n\nHouston, Texas (US)\n\nBaylor College of Medicine (BCM)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Nature\u2019s 10: ten people who helped shape science in 2020\n\n  * COVID-origins study links raccoon dogs to Wuhan market: what scientists think\n\n  * Scientists struggle to probe COVID\u2019s origins amid sparse data from China\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Politics\n  * Virology\n  * SARS-CoV-2\n\n## Sign up to Nature Briefing\n\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your\ninbox every weekday.\n\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter \u2014 what matters in science, free to\nyour inbox daily.\n\nGet the most important science stories of the day, free in your inbox.
