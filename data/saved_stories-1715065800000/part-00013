Credit: Getty\n\nCultureDiversityMITSocietyUniversitiesUS\n\n#### Latest from the Newsroom\n\n16:00\n\n# Anti-immigration sentiment has reawakened Ireland\u2019s dormant Right\n\n13:06\n\n# Boeing: the latest US company to suffer from Russian sanctions\n\n09:30\n\n# Why Rishi Sunak will survive \u2014 for now\n\n###### May 5, 2024 - 4:00pm\n\nIn what\u2019s likely to be a watershed moment, the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology has ended the use of diversity statements for faculty hiring,\nmaking it the first elite private university to backtrack on the practice that\nhas been roundly criticised as a political litmus test.\n\nOn Saturday, an MIT spokesperson confirmed in an email to me that \u201crequests\nfor a statement on diversity will no longer be part of applications for any\nfaculty positions at MIT\u201d, adding that the decision was made by embattled MIT\nPresident Sally Kornbluth \u201cwith the support of the Provost, Chancellor, and\nall six academic deans\u201d.\n\nThe decision marks an inflection point in the battle over diversity, equity,\nand inclusion (DEI) in higher education. Since at least the late 2010s,\ndiversity statements have been ubiquitous in faculty hiring, sometimes\ncarrying serious weight in the selection process. As one dean at Emory\nUniversity put it while describing her approach to hiring, \u201cDiversity\nstatement, then dossier.\u201d\n\nMIT embraced the diversity statement trend. In late 2023, the university\u2019s\nDepartment of Nuclear Science and Engineering sought an assistant professor\n\u201cin fields from fundamental nuclear science to practical applications of\nnuclear technology in energy, security and quantum engineering\u201d. Applicants\nwere required to submit \u201ca statement regarding their views on diversity,\ninclusion, and belonging, including past and current contributions as well as\ntheir vision and plans for the future in these areas\u201d.\n\nSuch requirements have long been controversial, and the basic argument against\nthem is simple: \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d has come to connote a set\nof controversial views about identity, power, and oppression. Universities\nwhich require scholars to \u201cdemonstrate\u201d their \u201ccommitment\u201d to DEI can easily\ninvite ideological screening, as well as potentially unlawful viewpoint\ndiscrimination. Many groups thus oppose the diversity statements on the\ngrounds of academic freedom and free expression.\n\nAt MIT, these arguments seemed to have won the day. In a statement provided to\nme via email, president Kornbluth notes: \u201cWe can build an inclusive\nenvironment in many ways, but compelled statements impinge on freedom of\nexpression, and they don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThis is momentous. The pushback against diversity statements has succeeded\nalmost exclusively at public universities in red states, encouraged or enacted\nby lawmakers. Conservative states such as Florida, Texas, and Utah have passed\nlaws banning diversity statements at state universities. Some appointed state\nuniversity leaders, such as the University of North Carolina Board of\nGovernors, have also barred the practice.\n\nThe decision at MIT is different \u2014 reform from within, prompted by a\nuniversity president alongside deans and provosts, at a private institution.\n\nIt\u2019s very possible that more private universities, and state universities in\nblue states, will eventually follow MIT\u2019s lead for one basic reason: a\nsignificant number of faculty from across the political spectrum simply cannot\nstand mandatory DEI statements. Last month, Harvard Law School\u2019s Randall\nKennedy \u2014 a self-described \u201cscholar on the Left committed to struggles for\nsocial justice\u201d \u2014 described the general sentiment: \u201cIt would be hard to\noverstate the degree to which many academics at Harvard and beyond feel\nintense and growing resentment against the DEI enterprise because of features\nthat are perhaps most evident in the demand for DEI statements.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope Kennedy and his colleagues learn from MIT\u2019s example and take their\nindignation seriously. After all, it\u2019s more than a narrow issue of free\nexpression and compelled speech. Diversity statements don\u2019t merely create an\northodoxy. They create a uniquely bad orthodoxy, one that is corrosive to\ncivic life and inimical to true higher education.\n\n## Join the discussion\n\n### Join like minded readers that support our journalism by becoming a paid\nsubscriber\n\n### To join the discussion in the comments, become a paid subscriber.\n\n#### Join like minded readers that support our journalism, read unlimited\narticles and enjoy other subscriber-only benefits.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\n40 Comments\n\nMost Voted\n\nNewest Oldest\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\nJohn Kang\n\n1 day ago\n\nUntil the DEI Commisars are fired, and the \u201cOppression Studies\u201d departments\nare expelled from the academy, not much will change\n\n242\n\n-13\n\nReply\n\nJim Veenbaas\n\n1 day ago\n\nI am generally skeptical of identifying watershed moments, but I agree with\nthe author. MIT is a very Ivy League school and this move will eventually\nconvince others to follow. Compelled speech is the backbone of any\nauthoritarian movement.

But the Fabian playbook of\nincremental institutional takeover will continue. Two steps forward, one step\nback. Let\u2019s acknowledge this as a small victory, better than nothing, but it\u2019s\nimportant not to kid ourselves. The biggest mistake you can make is taking a\nMarxist at their word. We need to tackle this at the worldview level, and get\nenough people to see how much they\u2019ve been duped by psychopathy masquerading\nas compassion. Then we\u2019ll get meaningful, sweeping reforms that reclaim the\ninstitutions. I still have hope, as we all should. Evil can only corrupt.\nGoodness can create, develop, and sustain. We just need to stand up for what\u2019s\nright!\n\n140\n\n-2\n\nReply\n\nLancashire Lad\n\n1 day ago\n\nReply to Archibald Tennyson\n\nI fully agree: we should remain hopeful, a manifestation of our humanity since\ntime immemorial. We owe it to the countless generations that\u2019ve gone before to\nus to stand up for what sustains and enhances us all; to give ourselves a\nchance of a future. We can disagree on what the source of hope might be, and\neven whether such things as \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cgoodness\u201d exist other than their\nexpression through human actions. The changing institutional awareness of MIT\nas expressed through this action is an unmitigated good, and allows science to\nbe pursued for the greater good of all.\n\n19\n\n-3\n\nReply\n\nRight-Wing Hippie\n\n1 day ago\n\n\u201crequests for a statement on diversity will no longer be part of applications\nfor any faculty positions at MIT\u201d Faculty is great; now do staff.\n\n76\n\n-2\n\nReply\n\n2 plus 2 equals 4\n\n1 day ago\n\n\u201ccompelled statements impinge on freedom of expression, and they don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be hard to overstate the degree to which many academics at Harvard\nand beyond feel intense and growing resentment against the DEI enterprise\nbecause of features that are perhaps most evident in the demand for DEI\nstatements.\u201d\n\nIf only there had been someone warning left-wing academics about the dangers\nof compelled speech for the last 40 years.\n\n78\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nJohn Howes\n\n17 hours ago\n\nReply to 2 plus 2 equals 4\n\nRegrettably, Left Wing academics are not dissimilar from Left Wing politicians\nthey exist within a Left Wing echo chamber.
