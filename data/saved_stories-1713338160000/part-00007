An Internet connected radio, cd player, and\nweather station. I was unboxing merchandise at an old job when I arrived at\nthis box. I stopped on my trail and contemplated putting it aside for myself\nbefore any customer sees it.\n\nIn our upcoming sale, I spied on customers eying my device. They picked it up,\nread through the plethora of internet connected features, then put it down. I\nmade several prayers that were all answered because every single one put the\nbox back on the shelf. When the sale ended I used my 10 percent employee\ndiscount to get this marvel of technology.\n\nAt home, I placed it in my closet then somehow forgot all about it.\n\nA long time later, I was rummaging through my closet when I found this box\nburied under old clothes. I stopped on my trail again, interrupting whatever\nelse I was doing and opened the box. How I wish I had a picture of this device\nto show you. It\u2019s nowhere on the Internet.\n\nWhen I took it out of the box, I was stunned by the elegant design. A silver\ncylinder with flushed speakers on each side behind a soft black fabric. On the\ntop, the disc reader opened futuristically on the press of a mechanical eject\nbutton. On the front a tiltable 5 inch back lit LCD screen. Jony Ive would\nhave been proud.\n\nBut then, my first disappointment. This internet connected device wasn't\nwireless. You had to plug an ethernet cable to enjoy its promises. But this\nwas the 2000s, of course I had an unfathomably long ethernet cable laying\naround somewhere.\n\nPlug it to the router, plug it to the power, hit the power button and the\nscreen lights up with one word: Initializing.\n\nWhen you have waited long enough, the screen changes to Network error. Must be\na problem with my router of course. I unplugged it from the router, then\nconnected it directly to the modem. Nothing beats raw unfiltered Internet\ndata.\n\nInitializing... Network error.\n\nI unplugged it from the modem, then plugged it back on the router. I loaded my\nnetwork debugging tools and started my investigation. The domain it was\nattempting to connect to was no longer resolving.\n\nSo much for the Internet features for me I guess. At least it was still a\nRadio and a CD player.\n\nLet's tune in to the radio. Automatic station search. Apparently, that\nrequires the internet as well. After you wait long enough, Network Error.\n\nWell let's go with CDs then. I was a big fan of Linkin Park. Pop the disc\nhousing open, Hybrid Theory goes in, close it and the cd audibly starts\nspinning.\n\nAlbum info... Oh you don't have an internet connection? Network error it is.\nThen the disc stops spinning.\n\nI spent months trying to get this device to work. It became a night project\nwhere I'd sink my precious time that could have been better spent sleeping.\nThe device served as a conversation piece on my desk for some time. But one\nday, out of spite, I threw it in the garbage.\n\nCan't have long lasting hardware with Internet Powered Nonsense!\n\nBuy me a coffee\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Linkedin\n\n", "frontpage": false}
