Racknitz was wrong both about the\nposition of the operator and the dimensions of the automaton.^[1]\n\nThe Mechanical Turk, also known as the Automaton Chess Player (German:\nSchacht\u00fcrke, lit. 'chess Turk'; Hungarian: A T\u00f6r\u00f6k), or simply The Turk, was a\nfraudulent chess-playing machine constructed in 1770, which appeared to be\nable to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent. For 84 years, it\nwas exhibited on tours by various owners as an automaton. The machine survived\nand continued giving occasional exhibitions until 1854, when a fire swept\nthrough the museum where it was kept, destroying the machine. Afterwards,\narticles were published by a son of the machine's owner revealing its secrets\nto the public: that it was an elaborate hoax, suspected by some, but never\nproven in public while it still existed.^[2]\n\nConstructed and unveiled in 1770 by Wolfgang von Kempelen (1734\u20131804) to\nimpress Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, the mechanism appeared to be able to\nplay a strong game of chess against a human opponent, as well as perform the\nknight's tour, a puzzle that requires the player to move a knight to occupy\nevery square of a chessboard exactly once.\n\nThe Turk was in fact a mechanical illusion that allowed a human chess master\nhiding inside to operate the machine. With a skilled operator, the Turk won\nmost of the games played during its demonstrations around Europe and the\nAmericas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including\nstatesmen such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The device was\nlater purchased in 1804 and exhibited by Johann Nepomuk M\u00e4lzel. The\nchessmasters who secretly operated it included Johann Allgaier, Boncourt,\nAaron Alexandre, William Lewis, Jacques Mouret, and William Schlumberger, but\nthe operators within the mechanism during Kempelen's original tour remain\nunknown.\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\nA signed charcoal self-portrait of Kempelen, who constructed the Turk\n\nKempelen was inspired to build the Turk following his attendance at the court\nof Maria Theresa of Austria at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, where Fran\u00e7ois Pelletier was\nperforming an illusion act. An exchange afterward resulted in Kempelen\npromising to return to the Palace with an invention that would top the\nillusions.^[3]\n\nA copper engraving of the Turk, showing the open cabinets and working parts. A\nruler at bottom right provides scale. Kempelen was a skilled engraver and may\nhave produced this image himself.An engraving of the Turk from Karl Gottlieb\nvon Windisch's 1784 book Inanimate Reason\n\nThe result of the challenge was the Automaton Chess-player,^[4]^[5] known in\nmodern times as the Turk. The machine consisted of a life-sized model of a\nhuman head and torso, with a black beard and grey eyes,^[6] and dressed in\nOttoman robes and a turban\u2014\"the traditional costume\", according to journalist\nand author Tom Standage, \"of an oriental sorcerer\". Its left arm held a long\nOttoman smoking pipe while at rest, while its right lay on the top of a large\ncabinet^[7] that measured about 3.5 feet (110 cm) long,^[a] 2 feet (61 cm)\nwide, and 2.5 feet (76 cm) high. Placed on the top of the cabinet was a\nchessboard, which measured 18 inches (460 mm) on each side. The front of the\ncabinet consisted of three doors, an opening, and a drawer, which could be\nopened to reveal a red and white ivory chess set.^[8]\n\nAn illustration of the workings of the model. The various parts were directed\nby a human via interior levers and machinery. This is a distorted measurement\nbased on Racknitz's calculations, showing an impossible design in relation to\nthe actual dimensions of the machine.^[1]\n\nThe interior of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those\nwho observed it.^[3] When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet\nexposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was\ndesigned so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open at the same time\none could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house\nmachinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as\nwell as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line\nof vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two\nother doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a\nsimilarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the\npresenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to\nmaintain the illusion.^[9]\n\nNeither the clockwork visible to the left side of the machine nor the drawer\nthat housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they\ninstead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed,\nallowing the operator inside to slide from place to place and thus evade\nobservation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat\ncaused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person\ninside the cabinet.^[10]\n\nThe chessboard on the top of the cabinet was thin enough to allow for a\nmagnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet\nattached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would\nattract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the\nboard. This allowed the operator inside the machine to see which pieces moved\nwhere on the chess board.^[11] The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding\nnumbers, 1\u201364, allowing the operator to see which places on the board were\naffected by a player's move.^[12] The internal magnets were positioned in a\nway that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would\noften allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to\nshow that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.^[13]\n\nAs a further means of misdirection, the Turk came with a small wooden coffin-\nlike box that the presenter would place on the top of the cabinet.^[3] While\nJohann Nepomuk M\u00e4lzel, a later owner of the machine, did not use the box,^[14]\nKempelen often peered into the box during play, suggesting that the box\ncontrolled some aspect of the machine.^[3] The box was believed by some to\nhave supernatural power; Karl Gottlieb von Windisch wrote in his 1784 book\nInanimate Reason that \"[o]ne old lady, in particular, who had not forgotten\nthe tales she had been told in her youth ... went and hid herself in a window\nseat, as distant as she could from the evil spirit, which she firmly believed\npossessed the machine.\"^[5]\n\nThe interior also contained a pegboard chess board connected to a pantograph-\nstyle series of levers that controlled the model's left arm. The metal pointer\non the pantograph moved over the interior chessboard, and would simultaneously\nmove the arm of the Turk over the chessboard on the cabinet. The range of\nmotion allowed the operator to move the Turk's arm up and down, and turning\nthe lever would open and close the Turk's hand, allowing it to grasp the\npieces on the board. All of this was made visible to the operator by using a\nsimple candle, which had a ventilation system through the model.^[15] Other\nparts of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when\nthe Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion, and for the\nTurk to make various facial expressions.^[16] A voice box was added following\nthe Turk's acquisition by M\u00e4lzel, allowing the machine to say \"\u00c9chec!\" (French\nfor \"check\") during matches.^[4]\n\nAn operator inside the machine also had tools to assist in communicating with\nthe presenter outside. Two brass discs equipped with numbers were positioned\nopposite each other on the inside and outside of the cabinet. A rod could\nrotate the discs to the desired number, which acted as a code between the\ntwo.^[17]\n\n## Exhibition[edit]\n\nThe Turk made its debut in 1770 at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, about six months after\nPelletier's act. Kempelen addressed the court, presenting what he had built,\nand began the demonstration of the machine and its parts. With every showing\nof the Turk, Kempelen began by opening the doors and drawers of the cabinet,\nallowing members of the audience to inspect the machine. Following this\ndisplay, Kempelen would announce that the machine was ready for a\nchallenger.^[18]\n\nKempelen would inform the player that the Turk would use the white pieces and\nhave the first move (note that the convention that White moves first was not\nyet established, so these were not redundant statements). Between moves the\nTurk kept its left arm on the cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it\nthreatened its opponent's queen, and three times upon placing the king in\ncheck. If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head,\nmove the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its\nopponent's move.^[19] Louis Dutens, a traveller who observed a showing of the\nTurk, attempted to trick the machine \"by giving the Queen the move of a\nKnight, but my mechanic opponent was not to be so imposed upon; he took up my\nQueen and replaced her in the square from which I had moved her\".^[20]\nKempelen made it a point to traverse the room during the match, and invited\nobservers to bring magnets, irons, and lodestones to the cabinet to test\nwhether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights. The first\nperson to play against the Turk was Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, an Austrian\ncourtier at the palace. Along with other challengers that day, he was quickly\ndefeated, with observers of the match stating that the machine played\naggressively, and typically beat its opponents within thirty minutes.^[21]\n\nThe knight's tour, as solved by the Turk. The closed loop that is formed\nallows the tour to be completed from any starting point on the board.^[22]\n\nAnother part of the machine's exhibition was the completion of the knight's\ntour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight\naround a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most\nexperienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the\nTurk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any\nstarting point via a pegboard used by the operator with a mapping of the\npuzzle laid out.^[22]\n\nThe Turk also had the ability to converse with spectators using a letter\nboard. The operator, whose identity during the period when Kempelen presented\nthe machine at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace is unknown,^[23] was able to do this in\nEnglish, French, and German. Carl Friedrich Hindenburg, a university\nmathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk's time in\nLeipzig and published it in 1789 as \u00dcber den Schachspieler des Herrn von\nKempelen und dessen Nachbildung (or On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And\nIts Replica). Topics of questions put to and answered by the Turk included its\nage, marital status, and its secret workings.^[24]\n\n## Tour of Europe[edit]\n\nFollowing word of its debut, interest in the machine grew across Europe.\nKempelen, however, was more interested in his other projects and avoided\nexhibiting the Turk, often lying about the machine's repair status to\nprospective challengers. Von Windisch wrote at one point that Kempelen\n\"refused the entreaties of his friends, and a crowd of curious persons from\nall countries, the satisfaction of seeing this far-famed machine\".^[25] In the\ndecade following its debut at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace the Turk only played one\nopponent, Sir Robert Murray Keith, a Scottish noble, and Kempelen went as far\nas dismantling the Turk entirely following the match.^[26] Kempelen was quoted\nas referring to the invention as a \"mere bagatelle\", as he was not pleased\nwith its popularity and would rather continue work on steam engines and\nmachines that replicated human speech.^[27]\n\nIn 1781, Kempelen was ordered by Emperor Joseph II to reconstruct the Turk and\ndeliver it to Vienna for a state visit from Grand Duke Paul of Russia and his\nwife. The appearance was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour\nof Europe for the Turk, a request to which Kempelen reluctantly agreed.^[28]\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor won a match against the Turk in Paris in 1783.\n\nThe Turk began its European tour in 1783, beginning with an appearance in\nFrance in April. A stop at Versailles beginning on April 17, preceded an\nexhibition in Paris, where the Turk lost a match to Charles Godefroy de La\nTour d'Auvergne, the Duc de Bouillon. Upon arrival in Paris in May 1783, it\nwas displayed to the public and played a variety of opponents, including a\nlawyer named Mr. Bernard who was a second rank in chess ability.^[29]\nFollowing the sessions at Versailles, demands increased for a match with\nFran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor, who was considered the best chess player of\nhis time.^[30] Moving to the Caf\u00e9 de la R\u00e9gence, the machine played many of\nthe most skilled players, often losing (e.g. against Bernard and\nVerdoni),^[31] until securing a match with Philidor at the Acad\u00e9mie des\nSciences. While Philidor won his match with the Turk, Philidor's son noted\nthat his father called it \"his most fatiguing game of chess ever!\"^[32] The\nTurk's final game in Paris was against Benjamin Franklin, who was serving as\nambassador to France from the United States. Franklin reportedly enjoyed the\ngame with the Turk and was interested in the machine for the rest of his life,\nkeeping a copy of Philip Thicknesse's book The Speaking Figure and the\nAutomaton Chess Player, Exposed and Detected in his personal library.^[33]\n\nFollowing his tour of Paris, Kempelen moved the Turk to London, where it was\nexhibited daily for five shillings. Thicknesse, known in his time as a\nskeptic, sought out the Turk in an attempt to expose the inner workings of the\nmachine.^[34] While he respected Kempelen as \"a very ingenious man\",^[3] he\nasserted that the Turk was an elaborate hoax with a small child inside the\nmachine, describing the machine as \"a complicated piece of clockwork ... which\nis nothing more, than one, of many other ingenious devices, to misguide and\ndelude the observers\".^[35]\n\nAfter a year in London, Kempelen and the Turk travelled to Leipzig, stopping\nin various European cities along the way. From Leipzig, it went to Dresden,\nwhere Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Racknitz viewed the Turk and published his\nfindings in \u00dcber den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen\nNachbildung, along with illustrations showing his beliefs about how the\nmachine operated.^[36] It then moved to Amsterdam, after which Kempelen is\nsaid to have accepted an invitation to the Sanssouci palace in Potsdam of\nFrederick the Great, King of Prussia. The story goes that Frederick enjoyed\nthe Turk so much that he paid a large sum of money to Kempelen in exchange for\nthe Turk's secrets. Frederick never gave the secret away, but was reportedly\ndisappointed to learn how the machine worked.^[37] This story is almost\ncertainly apocryphal; there is no evidence of the Turk's encounter with\nFrederick, the first mention of which comes in the early 19th century, by\nwhich time the Turk was also incorrectly said to have played against George\nIII of Great Britain.^[38] It seems most likely that the machine stayed\ndormant at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace for over two decades, although Kempelen attempted\nunsuccessfully to sell it in his final years. Kempelen died at the age of 70\non 26 March 1804.^[39]\n\n## M\u00e4lzel and the machine[edit]\n\nFollowing the death of Kempelen, the Turk remained unexhibited until 1805 when\nKempelen's son decided to sell it to Johann Nepomuk M\u00e4lzel, a Bavarian\nmusician with an interest in various machines and devices. M\u00e4lzel, whose\nsuccesses included patenting a form of metronome, had tried to purchase the\nTurk once previously, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had\nfailed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold\nthe machine to M\u00e4lzel for half this sum.^[40]\n\nUpon acquiring the Turk, M\u00e4lzel had to learn its secrets and make some repairs\nto get it back in working order. His stated goal was to make explaining the\nTurk a greater challenge. While the completion of this goal took ten years,\nthe Turk still made appearances, most notably with Napoleon Bonaparte.^[41]\n\nIn 1809, Napoleon I of France arrived at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace to play the Turk.\nAccording to an eyewitness report, M\u00e4lzel took responsibility for the\nconstruction of the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (Johann\nBaptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon before the start of the match. The details\nof the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of\nthem contradictory.^[42] According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the\nTurk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table.\nNapoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into\nthe Turk's area, with M\u00e4lzel crossing back and forth to make each player's\nmove and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move,\nNapoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first\nmove, as was usual; but M\u00e4lzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly\nthereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the\nTurk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon\nattempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing\nthe piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted\nthe move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking\nall the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played\na real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over\nhis king in surrender.^[43] Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon\nbeing unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later\ntime, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a\nshawl around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its\nvision.^[44]\n\nIn 1811, M\u00e4lzel brought the Turk to Milan for a performance with Eug\u00e8ne de\nBeauharnais, the Prince of Venice and Viceroy of Italy. Beauharnais enjoyed\nthe machine so much that he offered to purchase it from M\u00e4lzel. After some\nserious bargaining, Beauharnais acquired the Turk for 30,000 francs\u2014three\ntimes what M\u00e4lzel had paid\u2014and kept it for four years. In 1815, M\u00e4lzel\nreturned to Beauharnais in Munich and asked to buy the Turk back. There exist\ntwo versions of how much he had to pay, eventually working out an\nagreement.^[45] One version appeared in the French periodical Le Palam\u00e8de.^[b]\nThe complete story does not make a lot of sense since M\u00e4lzel visited Paris\nagain, and he also could import his \"Conflagration of Moscow\".^[c]\n\nAn advertisement for M\u00e4lzel's appearance with the Turk in London^[48]\n\nFollowing the repurchase, M\u00e4lzel brought the Turk back to Paris, where he made\nacquaintances of many of the leading chess players at Caf\u00e9 de la R\u00e9gence.\nM\u00e4lzel stayed in France with the machine until 1818, when he moved to London\nand held a number of performances with the Turk and many of his other\nmachines. In London, M\u00e4lzel and his act received a large amount of press, and\nhe continued improving the machine,^[49] ultimately installing a voice box so\nthe machine could say \"\u00c9chec!\" when placing a player in check.^[50]\n\nIn 1819, M\u00e4lzel took the Turk on a tour of the United Kingdom. There were\nseveral new developments in the act, such as allowing the opponent the first\nmove and eliminating the king's bishop's pawn from the Turk's pieces. This\npawn handicap created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W.\nJ. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap.^[51] Despite\nthe handicap, the Turk (operated by Mouret at the time)^[52] ended up with\nforty-five victories, three losses, and two stalemates.^[53]\n\n## M\u00e4lzel in North America[edit]\n\nThe appearances of the Turk were profitable for M\u00e4lzel, and he continued by\ntaking it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826, he opened an\nexhibition in New York City that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to\nmany newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret.\nM\u00e4lzel's problem was finding a proper operator for the machine,^[54] having\ntrained an unknown woman in France before coming to the United States. He\nended up recalling a former operator, William Schlumberger, from Alsace in\nEurope to come to America and work for him again once M\u00e4lzel was able to\nprovide the money for Schlumberger's transport.\n\nUpon Schlumberger's arrival, the Turk debuted in Boston, M\u00e4lzel spinning a\nstory that the New York chess players could not handle full games and that the\nBoston players were much better opponents.^[55] This was a success for many\nweeks, and the tour moved to Philadelphia for three months. Following\nPhiladelphia, the Turk moved to Baltimore, where it played for a number of\nmonths, including losing a match against Charles Carroll, a signer of the\nDeclaration of Independence. The exhibition in Baltimore brought news that two\nbrothers had constructed their own machine, the Walker Chess-player. M\u00e4lzel\nviewed the competing machine and attempted to buy it, but the offer was\ndeclined and the duplicate machine toured for a number of years, never\nreceiving the fame that M\u00e4lzel's machine did and eventually falling into\nobscurity.^[56]\n\nM\u00e4lzel continued with exhibitions around the United States until 1828, when he\ntook some time off and visited Europe, returning in 1829. Throughout the\n1830s, he continued to tour the United States, exhibiting the machine as far\nwest as the Mississippi River and visiting Canada. In Richmond, Virginia, the\nTurk was observed by Edgar Allan Poe, who was writing for the Southern\nLiterary Messenger. Poe's essay \"Maelzel's Chess Player\" was published in\nApril 1836 and is the most famous essay on the Turk, even though many of Poe's\nhypotheses were incorrect (such as that a chess-playing machine must always\nwin).^[57]\n\nM\u00e4lzel eventually took the Turk on his second tour to Havana, Cuba. In Cuba,\nSchlumberger died of yellow fever in February 1838, leaving M\u00e4lzel without an\noperator for his machine. Dejected, M\u00e4lzel died at sea in July 1838 at the age\nof 65 during his return trip, leaving his machinery with the ship\ncaptain.^[58]^[59]\n\n## Final years and beyond[edit]\n\nA 1980s Turk reconstruction\n\nWhen the ship on which M\u00e4lzel died returned, his various machines, including\nthe Turk, fell into the hands of M\u00e4lzel's friend, the businessman John Ohl. He\nattempted to auction off the Turk, but owing to low bidding ultimately bought\nit himself for $400.^[60] Only when John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia,\nEdgar Allan Poe's personal physician and an admirer of the Turk, approached\nOhl did the Turk change hands again.^[3] Mitchell formed a restoration club\nand went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances,\ncompleting the restoration in 1840.^[61]\n\nAs interest in the Turk outgrew its location, Mitchell and his club chose to\ndonate the machine to the Chinese Museum of Charles Willson Peale. While the\nTurk still occasionally gave performances, it was eventually relegated to the\ncorners of the museum and forgotten about until 5 July 1854, when a fire that\nstarted at the National Theater in Philadelphia reached the Museum and\ndestroyed the Turk.^[62] Mitchell believed he had heard \"through the\nstruggling flames ... the last words of our departed friend, the sternly\nwhispered, oft repeated syllables, 'echec! echec!!'\"^[63]\n\nJohn Gaughan, an American manufacturer of equipment for magicians based in Los\nAngeles, spent $120,000 building his own version of Kempelen's machine over a\nfive-year period from 1984.^[64] The machine uses the original chessboard,\nwhich was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in\nthe fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a\nhistory of magic conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen\npresented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a computer\nrunning a chess program.^[65]\n\n## Revealing the secrets[edit]\n\nWhile many books and articles were written during the Turk's life about how it\nworked, most were inaccurate, drawing incorrect inferences from external\nobservation.\n\nThe first articles on the mechanism were published in a French magazine\nentitled Le Magasin pittoresque in 1834.^[66] It was not until Silas\nMitchell's series of articles for The Chess Monthly that the secret was fully\nrevealed. Mitchell, son of the final private owner of the Turk,^[67] wrote\nthat \"no secret was ever kept as the Turk's has been. Guessed at, in part,\nmany times, no one of the several explanations ... ever solved this amusing\npuzzle\". As the Turk was lost to fire at the time of this publication, Silas\nMitchell felt that there were \"no longer any reasons for concealing from the\namateurs of chess, the solution to this ancient enigma\".^[63]\n\nThe most important biographical history about the Chess-player and M\u00e4lzel was\npresented in The Book of the First American Chess Congress, published by\nDaniel Willard Fiske in 1857.^[59] The account, \"The Automaton Chess-Player in\nAmerica\", was written by Professor George Allen of Philadelphia, in the form\nof a letter to William Lewis, one of the former operators of the chess\nautomaton.\n\nIn 1859, a letter published in the Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch by William F.\nKummer, who worked as an operator under John Mitchell, revealed another piece\nof the secret: a candle inside the cabinet. A series of tubes led from the\nlamp to the turban of the Turk for ventilation. The smoke rising from the\nturban would be disguised by the smoke coming from the other candelabra in the\narea where the game was played.^[68]\n\nLater in 1859, an uncredited article appeared in Littell's Living Age that\npurported to be the story of the Turk from French magician Jean Eug\u00e8ne Robert-\nHoudin. This was rife with errors ranging from dates of events to a story of a\nPolish officer whose legs were amputated, but ended up being rescued by\nKempelen and smuggled back to Russia inside the machine.^[69]\n\nA new article about the Turk did not turn up until 1899, when The American\nChess Magazine published an account of the Turk's match with Napoleon\nBonaparte. The story was basically a review of previous accounts, and a\nsubstantive published account would not appear until 1947, when Chess Review\npublished articles by Kenneth Harkness and Jack Straley Battell that amounted\nto a comprehensive history and description of the Turk, complete with new\ndiagrams that synthesized information from previous publications. Another\narticle written in 1960 for American Heritage by Ernest Wittenberg provided\nnew diagrams describing how the operator sat inside the cabinet.^[70]\n\nIn Henry A. Davidson's 1945 publication A Short History of Chess, significant\nweight is given to Poe's essay which erroneously suggested that the player sat\ninside the Turk figure, rather than on a moving seat inside the cabinet. A\nsimilar error would occur in Alex G. Bell's 1978 book The Machine Plays Chess,\nwhich falsely asserted that \"the operator was a trained boy (or very small\nadult) who followed the directions of the chess player who was hidden\nelsewhere on stage or in the theater ...\"^[71]\n\nMore books were published about the Turk toward the end of the 20th century.\nAlong with Bell's book, Charles Michael Carroll's The Great Chess Automaton\n(1975) focused more on the studies of the Turk. Bradley Ewart's Chess: Man vs.\nMachine (1980) discussed the Turk as well as other purported chess-playing\nautomatons.^[72]\n\nIt was not until the creation of Deep Blue, IBM's attempt at a computer that\ncould challenge the world's best players, that interest increased again, and\ntwo more books were published: Gerald M. Levitt's The Turk, Chess Automaton\n(2000), and Tom Standage's The Turk: The Life and Times of the Famous\nEighteenth-Century Chess-Playing Machine, published in 2002.^[73] The Turk was\nused as a personification of Deep Blue in the 2003 documentary Game Over:\nKasparov and the Machine.^[74]\n\n## Legacy and popular culture[edit]\n\nAn advertisement for an exhibition of Ajeeb, an imitation of the Turk\n\nOwing to the Turk's popularity and mystery, its construction inspired a number\nof inventions and imitations,^[3] including Ajeeb, or \"The Egyptian\", an\nAmerican imitation built by Charles Hopper that President Grover Cleveland\nplayed in 1885, and Mephisto, the self-described \"most famous\" machine, of\nwhich little is known.^[75] The first imitation was made while M\u00e4lzel was in\nBaltimore. Created by the Brothers Walker, the \"American Chess Player\" made\nits debut in May 1827 in New York.^[76] El Ajedrecista was built in 1912 by\nLeonardo Torres Quevedo as a chess-playing automaton and made its public debut\nduring the Paris World Fair of 1914. Capable of playing rook and king versus\nking endgames using electromagnets, it was the first true chess-playing\nautomaton, and a precursor of sorts to Deep Blue.^[77]\n\nThe Turk was visited in London by Rev. Edmund Cartwright in 1784. He was so\nintrigued by the Turk that he would later question whether \"it is more\ndifficult to construct a machine that shall weave than one which shall make\nall the variety of moves required in that complicated game\". Cartwright would\npatent the prototype for a power loom within the year.^[78] Sir Charles\nWheatstone, an inventor, saw a later appearance of the Turk while it was owned\nby M\u00e4lzel. He also saw some of M\u00e4lzel's speaking machines, and M\u00e4lzel later\npresented a demonstration of the speaking machines to the researcher and his\nteenage son. Alexander Graham Bell obtained a copy of a book by Wolfgang von\nKempelen on speaking machines after being inspired by seeing a similar machine\nbuilt by Wheatstone; Bell went on to file the first successful patent for the\ntelephone.^[3]\n\nA play, The Automaton Chess Player, was presented in New York City in 1845.\nThe advertising, as well as an article that appeared in The Illustrated London\nNews, claimed that the play featured Kempelen's Turk, but it was in fact a\ncopy of the Turk created by J. Walker, who had earlier presented the Walker\nChess-player.^[79]\n\nRaymond Bernard's silent feature film The Chess Player (1927) weaves elements\nfrom the real story of the Turk into an adventure tale set in the aftermath of\nthe first of the Partitions of Poland in 1772. The film's \"Baron von Kempelen\"\nhelps a dashing young Polish nationalist on the run from the occupying\nRussians, who also happens to be an expert chess player, by hiding him inside\na chess playing automaton called the Turk, closely based on the real Kempelen\nmodel. Just as they are about to escape over the border, the Baron is summoned\nto Saint Petersburg to present the Turk to the empress Catherine II. In an\necho of the Napoleon incident, Catherine attempts to cheat the Turk, who wipes\nall the pieces from the board in response.^[80]\n\nThe Turk has also inspired works of literary fiction. In 1849, just a few\nyears before the Turk was destroyed, Edgar Allan Poe published a tale \"Von\nKempelen and His Discovery\".^[81] Ambrose Bierce's short story \"Moxon's\nMaster\", published in 1909, is a morbid tale about a chess-playing automaton\nthat resembles the Turk. In 1938, John Dickson Carr published The Crooked\nHinge,^[82] a locked-room mystery in his line of Dr. Gideon Fell detective\nnovels. Among the puzzles presented included an automaton that operates in a\nway that is unexplainable to the characters.^[83] Gene Wolfe's 1977 science\nfiction short story \"The Marvellous Brass Chessplaying Automaton\" also\nfeatures a device very similar to the Turk.^[84] Robert Loehr's 2007 novel The\nChess Machine (published in the UK as The Secrets of the Chess Machine)\nfocuses on the man inside the machine. F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre's 2007 story\n\"The Clockwork Horror\" reconstructs Edgar Allan Poe's original encounter with\nM\u00e4lzel's chess-player, and also establishes (from contemporary advertisements\nin a Richmond newspaper) precisely when and where this encounter took\nplace.^[85] Jingetsu Isomi's 2013 manga series Chrono Monochrome is about a\n21st-century Japanese child chess prodigy who travels back in time and becomes\nthe Turk's original operator. In 2023, the story \"Alone Together\" from the\nTales from the Pizzaplex book series, itself a part of the Five Nights at\nFreddy's franchise, features a Mechanical Turk as a school project.\n\nWalter Benjamin alludes to the Mechanical Turk in the first thesis of his\nTheses on the Philosophy of History (\u00dcber den Begriff der Geschichte), written\nin 1940.^[86]\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ These dimensions are taken from Jay's Journal, which expresses them to the nearest half-foot. Metric versions thus can only be precise to the nearest multiple of fifteen centimetres. If conventionally rounded to the closest multiple of five centimetres, the cabinet was very roughly 110 cm \u00d7 60 cm \u00d7 75 cm (43 in \u00d7 24 in \u00d7 30 in), and the chessboard very roughly 2,500 cm^2 (390 sq in).\n  2. ^ \"The writer in the Palam\u00e8de makes the result a kind of partnership in an exhibition tour\u2014the title of the Automaton was to remain in the princely owner, and Maelzel was to pay the interest of the original cost as his partner's fair proportion of the profits. But another account\u2014current, I believe, at Munich\u2014makes the transaction to have been a sale: Maelzel bought back the Automaton for the same thirty thousand francs, and was to pay for it out of the profits of his exhibitions\u2014'Provided, nevertheless,' that Maelzel was not to leave the Continent to give such exhibitions. The latter account I believe to be the more correct one.\"^[46]^: 426\n  3. ^ \"Mr. Maelzel, who had already experienced some regret at parting with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, requested the favour to be again reinstated in the charge, promising to pay Eugene the interest of the thirty thousand francs Mr. M. had pocketed. This proposition was graciously conceded by the gallant Beauharnois, and Maelzel thus had the satisfaction of finding he had made a tolerably good bargain, getting literally the money for nothing at all! Leaving Bavaria with the Automaton, Maelzel was once more en route, as travelling showman of the wooden genius. Other automata were adopted into the family, and a handsome income was realised by their ingenious proprietor. Himself an inferior player, he called the assistance of first-rale talent to the field as his ally. On limits compel us to skip over some interval of time here, during which M. Boncourt (we believe) was Maelzel's chef in Paris, where the machine was received with all its former favour; and we take up the subject in 1819, when Maelzel again appeared with the Chess Automaton in London.\"^[47]\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Standage, 88.\n  2. ^ See Schaffer, Simon (1999), \"Enlightened Automata\", in Clark et al.
