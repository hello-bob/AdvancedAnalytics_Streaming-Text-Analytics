Since before\nthe founding, the colonies had been ever short of metallic currency. Our 18th-\ncentury forebears substituted credit for cash. They bought goods \u2018on account\u2019,\nborrowing to buy time until the harvest came in or some other windfall enabled\nthem to repay what they owed.\n\nThe 19th-century shift from agriculture to industry brought many American\nworkers predictable wages and fixed salaries. Industrial businesses \u2013 selling\nsewing machines, pianos, home appliances, and especially automobiles \u2013\ndeveloped novel credit arrangements to transform steady paychecks into steady\nrepayments. Instalment credit enabled consumers to purchase expensive durable\ngoods with a small down payment, followed by weekly or monthly payments\nthereafter.\n\nIn cities, department stores refined another form of borrowing: the charge\naccount. These accounts granted affluent consumers a fixed line of credit,\nwhich they repaid monthly without paying interest. Like instalment credit,\ncharge accounts existed to sell goods, rather than generating profits from\nlending as such. Charge accounts made credit convenient, encouraging consumers\nto buy more.\n\nConvenience came in part through a new link between credit and identification\nmedia. Stores issued charge tokens and later charge plates \u2013 fobs and metal\ncards that carried consumer account information \u2013 granting affluent consumers\nthe prestige of recognition in cities full of strangers.\n\nMass consumer credit greased the wheels of mass production. In the early 20th\ncentury, proponents praised a virtuous lending cycle. Credit generated\nconsumer demand; which encouraged industrial investment; which led to\neconomies of scale, lower costs, and more industrial work; finally encouraging\nfurther consumer demand. Critics worried that consumers, having committed\nfuture income to present consumption, would have no future buying power to\nturn the wheel the next cycle, or the next. \u2018Larger and larger doses of the\nstimulant must be injected merely to prevent a relapse,\u2019 two prominent critics\nwarned in 1926.\n\nThe Great Depression ended the debate. The 1929 stock market crash stalled\ncredit buying. Consumers worried. They waited. They postponed credit purchases\n\u2013 a month, two months, three. Individual delays, in the aggregate, froze the\neconomy. Without credit purchases, factories had fewer orders. With fewer\norders, factories idled and laid off workers. Unemployed workers cut spending\nfurther. They did not borrow to buy. They did not buy at all. The virtuous\ncredit circle that turned in the 1920s shuttered and stopped in the 1930s.\n\nPolicymakers took an unexpected lesson from this experience: the United\nStates\u2019 industrial capacity had been built to run on a steady fuel of consumer\nborrowing. If private lenders would not provide that fuel, New Dealers\nreasoned, the federal government should.\n\nUndated postcard of Brandeis department store; Omaha, Nebraska. Courtesy\nHistory Nebraska\n\nThe New Deal has many conflicting legacies but, from that point forward,\nfederal policy unambiguously supported a political economy with household\nborrowing at the centre. Federal lending programmes legitimised credit buying\nby aligning it with national economic priorities of stable employment and\nsteady growth.\n\nThose national priorities changed course when the nation shifted from recovery\nto warmaking during the Second World War. Policymakers wanted consumers to\nsave, not spend, a policy the US Federal Reserve pursued through firm controls\non consumer credit. Government controls encouraged credit innovation, first to\ncircumvent the rules, then to comply with them.\n\nPolicymakers initially targeted instalment credit, which consumers used to buy\ndurable goods like cars and home appliances. Retailers, still eager to\ngenerate sales, modified their unregulated charge account plans to enable\nconsumers to pay over longer periods of time. Charge accounts gained the now-\nfamiliar 30-days interest-free period, with interest charged monthly on the\nremaining balance.\n\nBrandeis \u2018Boston Store\u2019; Omaha, Nebraska, 1938. Courtesy the Library of\nCongress\n\nFed officials clamped down on regulatory avoidance, prompting businesses to\ninvest in information technology that would help them stay within the rules.\nRetailers needed to maintain thorough records of their customers\u2019 credit\nactivity and to halt credit sales that violated Fed regulations. Large\ndepartment stores adopted card-based accounting systems, called Charga-Plate,\nthat streamlined the links between their sales floors and credit departments.\nThese systems solidified the connection between metallic identification cards\nand retail credit: the credit card was born.\n\nFederal policymakers restrained consumer spending during wartime on the\nexplicit promise that the postwar years would bring unprecedented abundance.\nDepartment stores were apostles of this future, and they entered the postwar\nera with a new credit product to draw in customers. Credit cards were a key\nfeature of department store expansion in the 1940s and \u201950s, out of city\ncentres and into the growing suburbs.\n\nThe card allowed executives to wine and dine clients at restaurants and clubs\n\nOther businesses also made credit cards central to their postwar plans.\nGasoline companies, like Standard Oil of New Jersey, had developed nationwide\ncharge account networks linking service stations in the years before the war.\nWartime rationing halted credit sales. But in the late 1940s, service stations\nheavily promoted gasoline credit cards. Railroads, too, rolled out unified,\ncard-based credit plans.\n\nCourtesy Nicholas Eckhart/Flickr\n\nThese travel cards set the stage for \u2018universal\u2019 travel-and-entertainment\ncards. Department store cards, offered by firms like Macy\u2019s or Gimbels, were\nstore specific. Gasoline and rail cards linked independent businesses within\nthe travel industry under a unified credit plan. The watershed came in 1950,\nwhen Frank McNamara introduced the Diners Club card to executives in New York\nCity. The name was self-explanatory. The card allowed executives to wine and\ndine clients at restaurants and clubs, first in New York and soon around the\ncountry. The plan quickly expanded to include the full suite of travel and\nentertainment services. The card was, in its own estimation, the\n\u2018Indispensable New CONVENIENCE for the Executive \u2013 the Salesman \u2013 the man who\ngets around!\u2019\n\nBankers came to universal cards by another road. In the 1950s, most US banks\nwere small, local institutions. Financial regulations imposed during the New\nDeal bound banks in a web of rules that constrained their growth and\nprofitability. Banks primarily served business customers, but many were eager\nto find new products and services to expand beyond the era\u2019s tight regulatory\nlimits.\n\nThe postwar growth of department store chains provided an opportunity.\nDepartment stores offered credit cards. Small retailers did not. In the early\n1950s, a cohort of bankers in cities and towns across the country began\nexperimenting with local card plans that linked small retailers into local\ncredit networks. Although the plans were modest, bankers saw opportunity.\nBanks \u2018should be the reservoirs for every type of credit in their\ncommunities,\u2019 a Virginia banker observed in 1953, predicting that \u2018banks may\nbe handling the bulk, maybe all, charge account financing\u2019 in the near future.\n\nThe scale of the bank credit-card market changed in the late 1950s when\nCalifornia\u2019s Bank of America launched its BankAmericard plan. Unlike most US\nbanks, the Bank of America was big. By 1958, it had more than 800 branches\nacross the Golden State. Unlike most US banks, Bank of America also focused on\nconsumer lending, financing the home mortgages and auto loans that made\nCalifornia suburban. To manage millions of consumer accounts, Bank of America\ninvested in information processing technology. The bank was the first to adapt\nmainframe computers to banking in the 1950s, and executives believed that,\nwith computers, a state-wide credit card could be possible \u2013 even profitable.\n\nBank of America\u2019s executives recognised a fundamental challenge that\nconfronted all universal credit-card plans: the bank needed to recruit enough\nmerchant and consumer participants to make the card plan worthwhile to each\ngroup. Bankers had initially solved this problem by signing up merchants\nfirst, and then relying on merchants to solicit cardholders among their\nexisting customers. Bank of America started from the other end. The bank had a\nlarge customer base. If it recruited cardholders first, executives reasoned,\ncard-carrying consumers would draw merchants into the plan.\n\nBeginning in Fresno in September 1958, Bank of America mailed unsolicited\nBankAmericards to its consumer accountholders, ultimately sending more than 2\nmillion cards across California in the first few years. The cards came\nunexpectedly. They were also special: for the first time, the credit cards\nwere not metal or cardboard, but embossed plastic, an innovation that added\ngee-wiz novelty to the bank\u2019s card plan. The strategy proved expensive,\nreckless and effective. Bank of America gained a huge cardholder base, but at\nthe cost of massive delinquencies and fraud losses.\n\nBy the early 1960s, department store and travel cards were well rooted in\nAmerican wallets, but it was not yet clear that bank cards would succeed.\nChase Manhattan, the nation\u2019s second-largest bank, abandoned its credit card\nexperiment after less than four years of trying in 1962. But other banks in\nthe US were also struggling. Strict regulations ensured that, although banks\nwere safe \u2013 very few banks failed in the postwar years \u2013 they were not very\nprofitable. By the late 1960s, bankers increasingly saw credit cards, which\ncombined innovative information technology with access to affluent consumer\nmarkets, as the road to the future \u2013 as the key to innovating around the\nrestrictive financial rules.\n\nA 1960s postcard showing the Brandeis department store relocated out of\ndowntown Omaha, Nebraska. Public domain\n\nThe route to this future, however, was not initially obvious. Early on, credit\ncard executives obsessed over scale. Card systems had high fixed costs, so\nthat the more transactions a card plan processed, the lower the cost of each\ntransaction. Yet the quest for scale ran first into the market\u2019s fundamental\ndivision by gender. Travel and entertainment cards, like Diners Club and\nAmerican Express \u2013 the latter of which began issuing cards in 1958 \u2013 catered\nto male business executives. Department store and bank cards, by contrast,\nfocused on female-led family shopping. The BankAmericard was the \u2018family\ncredit card!\u2019\n\nIn the early 1960s, Bank of America set out to merge rather than segment. The\nbank enrolled hotels and airlines, expanding its market from suburban\nhousewives to their husbands. In these ambitions, Bank of America faced the\nsecond impediment to scale: geography. Under existing banking laws, it could\nnot build branches outside of California. Its travel card competitors offered\ncards from coast to coast. \u2018We do not believe that the Bank of America is a\ncompetitor of the Diners Club,\u2019 boasted Alfred Bloomingdale, the Diners Club\nchairman, in October 1966.\n\nIn their haste to get cards into consumer hands, most banks failed to perform\nthorough credit checks\n\nBloomingdale was correct, but the tide was turning against him. As he wrote,\nBank of America executives were building a credit card network that would link\nthe plans of local banks into a nationwide system. To overcome the regulatory\nbarriers that confined banks within individual states, Bank of America\nexecutives recruited large banks across the country, using their local\nmerchant and consumer relationships in their states to create a national bank\ncard plan.\n\nThe California bank also lit a fuse. BankAmericard was exclusive: only banks\nchosen by Bank of America could join. Competing firms responded by forming\ntheir own card networks. At first, these were regional \u2013 the Midwest Bank Card\nSystem centred on Chicago, while the New England Bankcard Association centred\non Boston. Quickly, these regional consortia coalesced into a competing\nnational network \u2013 Master Charge (later renamed MasterCard).\n\nIt is difficult to overstate the frantic growth of bank card plans in the late\n1960s. Fewer than 70 banks issued cards in 1965. More than 1,200 did by 1970.\nConsumers experienced this growth as a steady hail of plastic. Bank of America\nencouraged licensees to adopt unsolicited mailing. As the banker Dee Hock\nrecalled in his memoir, the strategy \u2018all boiled down to \u201cmass issue hundreds\nof thousands of unsolicited cards, sign every merchant in sight, and all will\ncome right in the end.\u201d\u2019 Competing banks adopted the strategy as well. Not to\nbe outdone, department stores and gasoline companies also mass-mailed cards.\nTens of millions of unsolicited cards flooded consumer mailboxes from the\nstart of the boom in 1966 until US Congress banned unsolicited card mailing in\nMay 1970.\n\nBanks careened into the credit card market to recruit new customers, meaning\nthat, while many used their existing accountholder lists as the starting point\nfor mass solicitation campaigns, banks invariably bought catalogues of\npotential cardholders from credit bureaus, mass mailing firms and other\nsources. David M Kennedy, chairman of Continental Illinois Bank in Chicago in\nthe 1960s, explained that his bank mailed cards to \u2018customers and shareholders\nand a few others in whom there was reason to place confidence [emphasis\nadded].\u2019 His vagueness was suggestive. Later investigations revealed that, in\ntheir haste to get cards into consumer hands, most banks failed to perform\nanything like thorough credit checks. Beating competitors to the mailbox was\nthe overriding concern.\n\nTo call these campaigns reckless fails to do them justice. Unsolicited mailing\ndelivered plastic credit that was live and ready to use. There were no systems\nfor activating credit cards. Recipients \u2013 intended or unintended, legitimate\nor fraudulent \u2013 needed only open the envelope, sign the card, and use it.\n\nThe cascade of unsolicited credit drew the attention of consumer groups,\nlabour unions and policymakers at all levels of government. Bankers pursued\ncards to innovate around New Deal regulatory restrictions and to build\nconsumer lending markets from scratch. Many did so to expand beyond downtowns\nthat were becoming Blacker and poorer, and to reach affluent, white suburbs.\nIn doing so, bankers inadvertently sparked a political backlash that would\ndrastically hem in their ambitions.\n\nThe first thrust came in the form of price controls, which reflected\nconsumers\u2019 desire for fair credit prices and protection from excessive debt.\nAt the time, state laws regulated the interest rates lenders could charge on\nmost consumer lending. Credit cards were expensive and initially fell under an\nexemption that allowed banks and other card issuers to charge whatever rates\nthey saw fit. As cards rained down, organisations like the American Federation\nof Labor and Congress Industrial Organizations and the Consumer Federation of\nAmerica led state-level campaigns to bring credit card lending under state\ninterest-rate rules. By the early 1970s, most states restricted card rates to\nbetween 12 and 18 per cent.\n\nThese restrictions, in turn, discouraged banks and other lenders from putting\nconsumers into long-term debt. Banks borrowed the money that they ultimately\nlent consumers. Price controls forced banks to hold the risk that if their\nborrowing costs went up \u2013 for example, because the Fed raised rates to fight\ninflation \u2013 they would not be able to pass higher costs on to borrowers. Price\ncontrols encouraged bankers to keep repayment periods short, making cards\ntools for convenient credit, not long-term debt.\n\nMass credit card mailing sparked a full-scale moral panic and a massive policy\nresponse\n\nAs consumer and labour groups organised to control the price of credit, they\nalso sought protection from the multiplying risks that appeared with the\ndeluge of cards. Consumers feared identity theft and potential liability if\ntheir cards were lost or stolen (especially cards they had never requested and\nnever seen). The cascade of cards alerted consumers to the new power of\nnational credit bureaus and to the infuriating problems of correcting billing\nerrors generated through automated accounting systems. Some even feared for\nthe moral integrity of the household, as banks mailed cards to wives, children\nand a few deceased relatives.\n\nMass mailing sparked, in short, a full-scale moral panic and a massive policy\nresponse. Congress enacted a wave of consumer legislation in the late 1960s\nand early \u201970s, including the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Fair Credit Reporting\nAct, and the Fair Credit Billing Act, all meant to make consumer credit\nmarkets safer. By 1976, Fed analysts reflected that \u2018credit cards have been\nthe principal subject of by far the majority of the consumer credit\nlegislation proposed and/or enacted since 1970.\u2019\n\nBankers leapt into the credit card market in the late 1960s to escape the\ntight regulations that constrained their industry. The consumer backlash and\nthe wave of legislation that followed fundamentally constrained credit card\nplans. Instead of a source of profits, cards became another source of low-\nmargin lending. What had once seemed like the road to the future appeared as\njust another dead end.\n\nThe political emphasis on credit cards as a consumer protection issue missed\ntheir importance as a bank regulatory problem. After the Great Depression, US\nCongress tried to keep banks small and geographic restrictions were a\ncornerstone of this policy. Bankers built card networks to overcome these\nrestrictions, but in the 1960s they still thought of cards as local products.\nBanks signed up merchants and consumers in their geographic territories.\nBecause cards did not generate large profits on their own, bankers expected\ncards to create relationships with merchants and consumers who would then use\nother banking services. Consumers could use their BankAmericards and Master\nCharge cards across the country, but they mostly used them close to home.\n\nThe card networks, though, also opened vectors to the gradual breakdown of\ngeographic restrictions and with them the state-level protections consumers\nhad so recently won. The process was gradual and largely unanticipated. In\nsome parts of the country, bank card plans began to cross state lines. In the\nMidwest, for example, large urban banks \u2013 like the First National Bank of\nOmaha, in Nebraska \u2013 partnered with small community banks in neighbouring\nstates \u2013 like the Coralville Bank and Trust, in Iowa. The Coralville Bank\nsuggested potential cardholders and signed up local merchants, while First of\nOmaha issued BankAmericards to the Coralville Bank\u2019s customers and managed\ntheir credit accounts.\n\nThese arrangements raised difficult legal questions about where card plans\nwere regulated \u2013 in Iowa where consumers lived and used their cards, or in\nNebraska where the bank was located? Over time, federal courts and eventually\nthe US Supreme Court determined that cards would be regulated by the state\nwhere the bank was located. At first, the cases attracted little attention \u2013\nnearly all states regulated credit card rates, and the difference between 12\nand 15 per cent interest was significant but small. Soon, though, the stakes\nwould change.\n\nAt the same time that legal questions about regulatory place and space worked\nthrough the Midwestern courts, large banks in cities like New York and Chicago\nbegan to look for new ways to innovate around geographic regulations and other\nrestrictive policies. State consumer regulations enforced a limited view of\ncards as strictly a credit device. Bankers, like Walter Wriston, chairman of\nNew York\u2019s Citibank, came to see cards as something else: banks in miniature.\nCitibank was a giant, global bank. It operated more than 200 branches abroad,\nbut it could not build branches outside New York State. Paired with other\ntechnologies, like point-of-sale terminals and ATMs, Citibank executives and\ntheir peers increasingly saw cards as a way to break the territorial\nrestrictions on consumer banking.\n\nAt the peak in 1979, banks approved nearly 75,000 credit card applications a\nday\n\nIn August 1977, Citibank made its move. The year before, BankAmericard\nannounced plans to rebrand itself as Visa, distancing the card from Bank of\nAmerica and signalling the globe-spanning ambitions of the network. By this\ntime, Citibank executives believed that consumers saw only the card network \u2013\nVisa and Master Charge \u2013 rather than the local banks that issued cards and\nmanaged consumer accounts. Timed with Visa\u2019s rebranding, Citibank launched a\nnationwide card-solicitation campaign, mailing reams of pre-approved\napplications to consumers across the country. Consumers, many assuming the\noffer was part of the Visa changeover, accepted Citi cards by the millions.\n\nCitibank\u2019s card blitz took its competitors by surprise. Bankers still believed\nthat local ties were essential to making card plans profitable and ensuring\nthat borrowers repaid their debts. But bankers also knew not to be complacent.\nJust like in the 1960s, Citi\u2019s competitors responded in kind, sparking a\nrenewed cycle of mass solicitation. At the peak in 1979, banks approved nearly\n75,000 credit card applications a day, ultimately surpassing department stores\nas the leading source of credit card borrowing.\n\nCitibank\u2019s timing initially proved ill-chosen. In the late 1970s, policymakers\nin the Jimmy Carter administration and at the Federal Reserve struggled to\ndeal with persistent, unyielding inflation. Prices ratcheted up 6.5 per cent\nin 1977, then 7.5 per cent in 1978, before jumping over 11 per cent in 1979.\nThe causes of inflation were heavily debated, and some blamed consumer credit\ngenerally \u2013 and credit cards specifically. Consumers used credit to engage in\n\u2018anticipatory buying\u2019, seeking to buy ahead of price increases and thereby\ncreating more demand and driving prices higher.\n\nBeginning in October 1979, Paul Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve,\nbegan a dramatic campaign to kill inflation. The Fed determined to limit the\ngrowth of the money supply, allowing interest rates to rise as high as\nnecessary to constrain monetary growth. Because lenders like banks and\ndepartment stores borrowed the money they lent consumers through cards, and\nbecause state interest rate restrictions limited the prices card lenders could\ncharge consumers, surging interest rates punished card issuers. By March 1980,\none Fed governor observed that \u2018there is also a good deal of concern regarding\nlosses on consumer credit cards, but that\u2019s news to no one.\u2019\n\nWhat was a problem for the industry was a crisis for Citibank. As Volcker\nratcheted up rates, Citi\u2019s cost of funds exceeded what it could charge\ncardholders. New York\u2019s consumer protection laws were strict. Despite Citi\u2019s\npleading, policymakers would not budge. The bank, which already had more than\n2 million MasterCard customers in and around New York before Citibank\u2019s Visa\ncampaign, now had 4 million customers across the country. Citi had staked its\nfuture on its card business; Fed policy threatened to destroy it.\n\nThe usual explanation is that consumers are irrational, a polite way to say\nthey\u2019re always getting tricked\n\nDesperate, Citibank\u2019s lawyers searched for a loophole. They found one in an\nobscure law called the Bank Holding Company Act, which allowed them to\nrelocate their card operation to another state \u2013 one without New York\u2019s strict\nrules \u2013 but only if the state\u2019s legislature invited them to do so. Citi\nexecutives promised hundreds of financial services jobs, an offer South Dakota\naccepted in March 1980. South Dakota had no applicable price restrictions, and\nCitibank exported its high rates to cardholders across the country.\n\nState-level price controls had fundamentally restrained credit card plans,\nforcing card issuers to internalise interest-rate risk and discouraging them\nfrom keeping borrowers in long-term debt. South Dakota, though, traded\nregulatory benefits for jobs and tax revenues. Other states quickly followed.\nIn 1981, Delaware copied South Dakota\u2019s legislation verbatim, luring banks\nlike Chase Manhattan. As Volcker\u2019s Fed eased rates in the early 1980s, banks\nlaunched card promotions from their new homes, offering not only high interest\nrates but also new annual fees.\n\nSome states tried to hold out. For a time, Massachusetts maintained its 18 per\ncent rate limit and did not allow annual cardholder fees. Beginning in 1983,\nout-of-state banks flooded the state with card offers. Expensive credit pushed\nout inexpensive credit. Massachusetts\u2019s banks lost patience. They threatened\nto relocate if the state legislature did not raise rates, a concession they\nwon in early 1985.\n\nAt first glance, the Massachusetts story is counterintuitive. If consumers\nprefer lower prices, wouldn\u2019t they just choose the lowest-cost cards? Yet as\nthe Massachusetts bankers recognised, card issuers in high-interest states\ncould afford heavy marketing costs, pushing out low-cost alternatives.\nComparison shopping is not costless. For consumers, it was easier to take the\noffer in the mailbox. For banks, it was cheaper to fight for deregulation than\nto fight for market share. Bad plastic money crowded out good.\n\nIn the years since, bank credit card plans have been consistently more\nprofitable than other forms of bank lending. In theory, competition should\nbring down these profits, but it doesn\u2019t. The traditional explanation is that\nconsumers are irrational, which is a polite way to say they are always getting\ntricked. Over time, banks and other card issuers found new ways to manipulate\nconsumers: affinity cards to create emotional and social connections (I got my\nfirst card from my university\u2019s alumni association); low minimum payments to\ndrag out debt; teaser rates to encourage consumers to shift debts from one\nbank to another; high fees for the slightest contractual infraction.\n\nThe largest card-issuers are the worst offenders. Consolidation\u2014like the\nrecently proposed Capital One and Discover merger\u2014further restrains\ncompetition and ensures that the practices of the most exploitative firms\nbecome industry norms.\n\nPart of the story, too, is that the US political economy has continued to rely\non household borrowing, even as the high-paying jobs that enabled Americans to\nrepay their debts have disappeared for many. Indeed, the great benefit \u2013 if it\ncan be called that \u2013 of unregulated credit is that banks are willing to offer\ncards to consumers deemed less creditworthy: often poor and minority borrowers\nwho had been excluded from mainstream finance. Such borrowers, often with\nprecarious incomes, are that much more likely to get stuck in a high-interest\ndebt trap, always revolving, never repaying.\n\nAll the while, aggregate credit card debt continued on a relentless upward\nratchet. Outstanding card debt doubled from 1980 to 1985, doubled again by\n1990, again by 1995, and again by 2005, topping out in April 2008 at more than\n$1 trillion. The crisis of 2008 brought a brief reckoning. By 2011, debt\ngrowth resumed until the COVID-19 pandemic, broke when the economy broke, and\nhas since spiked up, reaching new all-time highs month after month.\n\nThe obvious question is: what to do? A federal interest rate cap would be a\ngood start, as would strict limits on cardholder fees. US Congress could (and\nshould) eliminate reward plans that make cards engines of upward\nredistribution, from struggling borrowers to affluent point-collectors. These\nwould be dramatic changes and would still not get close to the root of the\nproblem. In the United States, mass consumption came into being paired with\nmass credit. Critics recognised then the dangers of this combination, the need\nfor larger and larger doses of the credit stimulant to prevent an economic\nrelapse. Absent some fundamental restructuring, there is little to do but keep\nthe plastic juice flowing.\n\nPlastic Capitalism: Banks, Credit Cards, and the End of Financial Control is\nthe forthcoming book by Sean H Vanatta, publishing in July 2024 via Yale\nUniversity Press.\n\nEconomic historyHistory of technologyEconomics\n\n22 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHuman rights and justice\n\nMy elusive pain\n\nThe lives of North Africans in France are shaped by a harrowing struggle to\nbelong, marked by postcolonial trauma\n\nFarah Abdessamad\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nReligion\n\nConscientious unbelievers\n\nHow, a century ago, radical freethinkers quietly and persistently subverted\nScotland\u2019s Christian establishment\n\nFelicity Loughlin\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHistory of technology\n\nWhy America fell for guns\n\nThe US today has extraordinary levels of gun ownership.
