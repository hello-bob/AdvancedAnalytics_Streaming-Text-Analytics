Our mission is to help more people\nstart the best startups.\n\nThanks for reading Extraordinary Aliens ! Subscribe for free to receive new\nposts and support my work.\n\nWe help you find the missing pieces to get started \u2014 what to build, how you\u2019ll\nbuild it, who you\u2019ll build it with, and what needs to happen for you to start.\n\nMany founders need to figure out their immigration status before they start,\nso we help them navigate the process.\n\nI got my O1 six months ago after being told I didn\u2019t qualify. Since then, I\u2019ve\nsupported dozens of other founders in the ODF community to get their visas and\nstart their companies. Let me show you how!\n\nContrary to popular belief, you don\u2019t need a Nobel prize, to raise any money,\nor to have a co-founder to get an O1 visa. You can be scrappy, a solo founder,\nand bootstrap.\n\nUnlike visas like the TN or the HB1, which have restrictions on the title you\ncan have (no founder or CTO), your wages (really high salaries), and where you\nwork, the O1 is founder-friendly and a stepping stone to the green card with\nthe EB1. It\u2019s the fastest, most flexible way to live in the US and build a\nstartup with unlimited extensions.\n\n##\n\nDebunking the O1 myths\n\n  * The bar for the O1 isn\u2019t Nobel prize high!\n\nYou can totally build up to it. Most lawyers see tech-adjacent fields as a\nrisk due to their own unwillingness to understand highly complex roles. This\ndoesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t quality - it just means you need a better provider\n\n  * You don\u2019t need to raise funding or be part of an accelerator.\n\nHowever, you need to show that you have reasonable funds to pay yourself for a\nfew months and comply with state minimum wage laws. Wiring your savings in\nyour startup bank account is an option here.\n\n  * You don\u2019t need an American US co-founder, let alone any co-founder.\n\nThe O1 is an employment-based visa, so you need to be employed and fireable.\nIn a startup context, that doesn\u2019t mean you need a co-founder. A way folks\nhave done this is by having a board with at least three people, even including\nyourself, to demonstrate your role has some level of hire-fire authority.\n\n> Think about the O1 as a fundraising process\u2014it\u2019s storytelling. You\u2019re\n> pitching the government on why they should invest in you long-term.\n\nRather than \u201cticking boxes\u201d with criteria, you need to think about how to\nstructure the narrative so it\u2019s compelling to the reader. The criteria and\nevidence, such as letters, support that overarching narrative.\n\n> Quality > Quantity.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out the employment part (who is hiring you \u2192 incorporating\nyour startup & who\u2019s paying you \u2192 do you have money in the bank), you need to\nget a minimum of 3 criteria out of 8.\n\n  * Use your entire career for this; it all counts!\n\n  * It doesn\u2019t have to be US-related: doing something impressive in the motherland works too!\n\nI\u2019ve built up to mine, and you can do it too.\n\n##\n\nMemberships\n\nExclusive memberships show that you\u2019re at the top of your field. For founders,\nthings like ODF, YC, and Thiel fellowship are great. You can choose more niche\nones linked to your field, too. Memberships linked to prestigious\norganizations like the Global Shapers (World Economic Forum) are golden as\nwell.\n\nHere\u2019s what matters:\n\n  * Exclusivity: Show that it\u2019s invitation-only or a strict application process with a thorough review of your background, aka you\u2019ve been selected because of your achievements\n\n  * Judges: Show that the folks that chose you are world-class (they have raised tons of money, they have press, are a public persona)\n\n  * Members: Name-drop people who are part of the same orgs and are really impressive. Use their LinkedIn profiles and press about them, as well as articles about their companies. Your association with world-class folks makes you world-class.\n\n##\n\nJudging\n\nUSCIS cares about this criterion because it shows you\u2019re recognized in your\nfield. You\u2019re so knowledgeable that you\u2019re trusted to judge the work of\nothers.\n\nYou need to show that you\u2019ve been singled out to judge because of your\nexpertise, have an invitation to judge (email is great), and provide\nconfirmation you\u2019ve judged (essential). It can\u2019t be paid work or incident of\nemployment: reviewing deals if you\u2019re a VC doesn\u2019t work.\n\nFor this, you can:\n\n  * Judge Hackathons\n\n  * Review accelerator applications\n\n  * Review deals for VCs\n\n  * Peer review journal articles\n\n##\n\nHigh Remuneration\n\nThat one is great \u2014 if you\u2019ve been paid a US salary abroad, bingo!\n\nThis works with any past, present, or future jobs.\n\nUse government data or Glassdoor screenshots to prove that your salary is in\nthe top 10% for your job category.\n\nIf you\u2019re a founder who has raised capital, you can argue remuneration based\non the value of your equity (a high post-money valuation cap on your latest\nSAFE is golden for this).\n\n##\n\nAwards\n\nAwards are great for second-time founders since venture capital funding is\nconsidered an internationally recognized award for entrepreneurs!\n\nThese all count:\n\n  * Venture capital funding (past, present, future)\n\n  * Forbes 30u30 (and adjacent)\n\n  * Government grants\n\n  * Grants like 1517, Fullbright...\n\n  * Major Hackathons like Microsoft Imagine Cup with a broad applicant pool\n\n    * Don\u2019t join hackathons to try to win, USCIS is harsher on that \u2014 it\u2019s more effective to judge them \u2014 unless they\u2019re word-class and everyone can apply\n\n##\n\nPublications\n\nAuthored articles must be published in either peer-reviewed journals or major\nmedia specific to your field.\n\nFor scholarly articles, you don\u2019t need citations (more of a nice to have); you\nsimply need to be peer-reviewed \u2014 articles in IEEE or Springer work super\nwell.\n\nFor major media, it needs to be highly circulated (use SimilarWeb to show it\nhas significant readership).\n\nQuality publications in Hackernoon work!\n\n##\n\nPress\n\nApparently, some lawyers say having press is essential for an O1 (not true at\nall). Only go with that one if you already have a strong foundation. It\u2019s too\npainful to build up and unnecessary.\n\n  * Go with legit pieces (Techcrunch, Forbes, Wired)\n\n  * Avoid paid press\n\n  * Use SimilarWeb reports to show significant readership \u2014 if the website is a bit more niche\n\nSome folks have used podcasts. Do it only if it\u2019s an impressive host/podcast\nthat is available across multiple platforms (Apple podcast, Spotify).\n\n##\n\nOriginal contribution\n\nHas your work contributed to major success for a company?\n\nYou need to prove that what you were doing is (1) original and (2) of major\nsignificance to get that criteria.\n\nYou can show that it\u2019s original using examples of what you\u2019ve created (GitHub\nrepos, Notion docs about processes, outline of the algorithm you\u2019ve created,\nBusiness strategy docs, Slide Decks that name you \u2014 as well as an evidence\nletter signed by someone who worked with you).\n\nTo show its major significance, it needs to have widespread implementation or\ncommentary. Press about the startup/company/product is gold, but you can also\nuse NDAs, LOIs and user adoption dashboards.\n\nIf you published a highly circulated scholarly article in a prominent peer-\nreviewed journal, you may be able to angle this simply on the argument that\nyour citations reflect widespread commentary.\n\nThe idea is to show cause & effect.\n\n##\n\nCritical role\n\nThis isn\u2019t always slam dunk criteria. It works if you have a prominent or\nessential role in the company (founder is great) and the company is prominent.\nIt doesn't have to be Apple/Google; if it\u2019s a smaller company with great\npress, it works!\n\nTwo elements for this to work:\n\n  1. You have an essential role\n\nThis means critical oversight on projects with significant impact\u2014this could\ninclude growth, revenue, expanding departments, or handling finance for the\ncompany.\n\n  2. The company is distinguished\n\nTo show that the company is distinguished, you can use funding, press, LOIs,\npartnerships, or NDAs and elaborate on why it\u2019s important. For instance, a\nletter of intent from a prominent company (VC-backed/press).\n\nThe US is the best place to build anything ambitious. Come with a deck & a\ndream; scale up like it\u2019s 1776. \ud83e\udd85 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nSubscribe to Extraordinary Aliens to vote on this poll\n\nOnly subscribers can vote on this poll.\n\nAlready a subscriber?
