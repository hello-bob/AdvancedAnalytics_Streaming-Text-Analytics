However, using a structured framework\ncan help you deliver your answer clearly and effectively highlight your\nproduct sense intuition.\n\nThis product sense interview guide accompanies Exponent's product management\ninterview course, trusted by 25,000+ senior product managers and APMs to ace\ntheir interviews.\n\nSneak peek: - Watch a Google PM answer, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite product?\u201d -\nWatch a Google PM answer, \u201cHow can Airbnb increase bookings?\u201d - Watch a Meta\nPM answer, \u201cDesign Facebook Movies.\u201d\n\n## 8 common product sense questions\n\nExponent users say these are the most commonly asked product sense questions.\nThey include a mix of product design, improvement, and strategy questions.\n\n  * What's your favorite product and why?\n  * How would you improve your favorite product?\n  * How would you improve Instagram Stories?\n  * Design a product for Meta space travel.\n  * Design a parking feature for Google Maps.\n  * How would you improve Facebook Marketplace?\n  * Design a product for drivers in rush hour.\n  * How would you improve Spotify?\n  * How would you improve iOS in 5 years?\n\ni\ufe0f\n\nRead more: Check out our lessons on How to Answer Product Design Questions and\nProduct Strategy Questions.\n\n## Companies with product sense interviews\n\nThese are notable companies with distinct product sense interview rounds.\n\n  * Stripe PM Interview Guide\n  * Meta PM Interview Guide\n  * Microsoft PM Interview Guide\n  * Lyft PM Interview Guide\n\n## Interview framework\n\nTo deliver an effective answer to product sense questions, follow this 7-step\nprocess. This same framework can be applied broadly to product design and\nstrategy questions.\n\n  * Step 1: Clarify and get context\n  * Step 2: Define users\n  * Step 3: Identify pain points and opportunity areas\n  * Step 4: Brainstorm possible solutions\n  * Step 5: Define a product vision\n  * Step 6: Prioritize features\n  * Step 7: Evaluate and recap\n\n### Step 1: Clarify and get context\n\nFirst, clarify the problem you\u2019ve been given.\n\nGather context that will help you understand the problem space and define any\nstrategic considerations that might influence your design.\n\nQuestions like these are fair game:\n\n  * What\u2019s the timeline?\n  * Are there any constraints I should be aware of?\n\nBut be prepared for an interviewer to give you a vague answer!\n\ni\ufe0f\n\nMake assumptions. Then repeat them back to your interviewer so they have a\nchance to correct you if you\u2019re veering off-track.\n\n### Step 2: Define users\n\nNext, divide the total userbase into subsets of users. Then, select an\ninteresting group for a more detailed analysis.\n\nA few starting points could be:\n\n  * Demographics like age or income level\n  * Behavioral traits such as frequency of use or users performing certain actions\n  * Geographic location\n\nChoose a segmentation method that is relevant to the question at hand.\n\nAfter choosing a segmentation method and identifying basic user subsets,\nselect a subset that interests you and explain why it's valuable to discuss.\n\nConsider the following factors:\n\n  * User subsets that may be strategic, such as early adopters\n  * Scale of impact, or the intensity of pain that users experience\n  * How effectively you or your company can address these users in the context of your question\n\n### Step 3: Identify pain points and opportunity areas\n\nNext, consider any goals your users might have. Do they have any obvious\nobstacles or pain points?\n\nIf nothing\u2019s blocking users from achieving their goals but some point of\nfriction clearly exists, you\u2019ve uncovered an opportunity area.\n\nTake a moment to summarize the goals you think your user subset has, then\nbrainstorm pain points and opportunity areas preventing them from achieving\nthose goals.\n\nUse the \"broad then deep\" mini-framework to quickly hone in on key pain\npoints.\n\nConsider the circumstances users are in.\n\n  * Is the user's goal urgent?\n  * Are the decisions involved important or trivial?\n\ni\ufe0f\n\nAsking yourself these questions and putting yourself in the user's shoes\ndemonstrates user empathy.\n\nCheck out our guide to Meta (Facebook) product management interviews. Meta is\nknown for their product sense interviews.\n\n### Step 4: Brainstorm possible solutions\n\nNow, brainstorm ideas that could solve the pain point you\u2019ve identified.\n\nOne helpful tip for coming up with solutions is to think of products you like\n\u2014 especially anything solving a similar problem in another context.\n\nFor example, Duolingo might be a good analogue for improving a gym. Both\nproducts remove barriers for people who want to improve themselves (by\nlearning a language) but who have trouble with motivation, routine, or\nplanning. The app is fun, easy to use, and the emphasis is on consistency\nrather than intensity.\n\nThese are all characteristics you might incorporate into your recommendations.\n\nAim to generate at least three solid ideas before moving on to the next step.\nIt\u2019s fine to brainstorm a bigger list and eliminate weak ideas.\n\nCheck each idea against the pain point you identified and don't be afraid to\nget creative. Interviewers want to see excitement and passion for products.\n\n### Step 5: Come up with a forward-looking product vision\n\nPick the strongest solution from the previous section and take a moment or two\nto envision what that product will look like in five or ten years.\n\nCome up with a brief tagline that really emphasizes the point you're making.\nYou want to leave the interviewer with a soundbite they\u2019ll remember when\nthey\u2019re scoring your interview.\n\nWrite it on the whiteboard (if you\u2019re using one) and refer back to it as you\ncontinue.\n\n### Step 6: Prioritize features\n\nOnce you\u2019ve crafted a compelling product vision, it\u2019s time to prioritize\nfeatures.\n\nTake the interviewer through a quick user journey where a user interacts with\nyour product. This will help you concretely identify how your product fits\ninto the existing user flow which will help you prioritize features.\n\nIt\u2019ll also help you stay user-centric instead of over-defining an idea that\nappeals to you personally.\n\nThen, brainstorm a short list of features based on your use case(s) and\nprioritize according to which features best support your product vision. Be\nsure to tie the discussion back to user pain points.\n\nHere are a few helpful dimensions to consider:\n\n  * Scale: How many users does this help?\n  * Ease of expansion: How easily will this feature expand to other user subsets? Will it attract new users?\n  * Strategic impact: How well does this feature support the company vision?\n\nYou don\u2019t need to describe every part of the feature in detail, but\ninterviewers do expect you to describe what the user sees and interacts with\nand how that delivers on the product goals and vision you defined.\n\n### Step 7: Evaluate and recap\n\nAs you wrap up, summarize your insights for your interviewer, then spend a few\nminutes evaluating your design and discussing next steps. Consider:\n\n  * Tradeoffs you made\n  * Alternate use cases and edge cases\n  * What you\u2019d do differently given more time\n\nCommon follow-up questions from interviewers include:\n\n  * Can you see any risks with this design?\n  * What challenges do you anticipate in implementing this product?\n\nDiscussing risks and challenges preemptively signals to interviewers that your\nideas are grounded in reality.\n\nThis is a sample whiteboard from a product design interview where a candidate\nwas asked to design a better gym experience.\n\n## Interview tips\n\n### Consider the company strategy\n\nBringing strategic concerns into the mix can help you reach a broader and\ndeeper understanding of the problem at hand. Here are some prompts to\nconsider:\n\n  * Company mission: What\u2019s the company mission? Why does the company care about this space? How could this product support the mission?\n  * Company strategy: What are the relevant strategic goals the company might have? How could this tie into those or open up a new strategy? What products make sense strategically?\n  * Market understanding: What alternatives already exist in the market? Where are the gaps? What\u2019s valuable in this market?\n\n### Abstract the problem\n\nMoonshots are bold ideas that go beyond incremental changes.\n\nThey\u2019re frequently associated with Google interviews, but you can \u201cmoonshot\u201d\nany design question by digging deep until you\u2019ve uncovered the root of an\nimportant problem in a way that feels transformative.\n\nYou\u2019re on the right track if you\u2019ve found a way to solve the problem\ncompletely and simply for the user. If you\u2019re able to eliminate the conditions\nthat cause the problem in the first place, even better.\n\nFirst, try to think of the product as a black box. The input is the user\u2019s\ncurrent state, and the output is the user as they want to be.\n\nBy eliminating all assumptions about how to get users from where they are to\nwhere they want to be and exploring what could happen in that space, really\ntransformative solutions can sometimes become clear.\n\nAnother strategy is to use something like the 5 Whys technique to dig deeper\nand deeper until you uncover the root of the problem.\n\nYou could also consider what the user\u2019s actual goals are. For instance, if\nyou\u2019re asked to build an alarm clock for deaf users, consider that the user\u2019s\ngoal is to wake up at a certain time. Rather than limiting yourself to\nmodifying how existing alarm clocks work, this framing allows for new options\nthat rethink what an alarm clock is.\n\ni\ufe0f\n\nFocus on the user and their needs \u2014 this approach will never steer you wrong.\n\n### Consider existing users and goals\n\nSometimes, you\u2019ll be asked to improve an existing product.\n\nQuestions like \u201cImprove Instagram\u2019s homepage\u201d are similar to \u201cdesign X\u201d\nquestions.\n\nConsider established users, goals, and market dynamics. Keep these in mind,\nand consider addressing under-served users, supporting new use cases, or\nadapting a product to open new strategic opportunities.\n\n## Common mistakes\n\n  * Jumping straight to a solution: Ensure you articulate your thought process so the interviewer can understand your reasoning and why your idea is a viable solution. Avoid settling on a solution immediately after hearing the question. Maintain an open mind as better ideas often emerge as you delve deeper into the problem.\n  * Forgetting to segment users: In certain design questions, you may be given a specific user subgroup or constraint to design for, such as \"Design Gmail for kids.\" A common mistake is overlooking the need to segment users despite having an upfront constraint. For the Gmail question, \"kids\" is a broad group. You could focus on a specific age range or school level. To delve deeper, consider discussing capabilities and constraints relevant to your segment. For instance, if your segment is early elementary school kids, some key constraints could be their limited writing skills, potential lack of tech savviness, and the paramount importance of their safety. These factors will influence your product design and can be easily overlooked if not explicitly considered.\n  * Trying to design for everybody: Designing for everyone often results in a product that fails to resonate with anyone. Without narrowing your scope, obtaining meaningful insights about your users and their pain points becomes challenging.\n  * Checking off the boxes: While using a framework can be helpful for staying on track, remember that its steps are recommendations for gaining insights, not a mandatory checklist. Ensure you evaluate your answer comprehensively at each stage.\n\n## Improving your product sense\n\nShreyas Doshi is a product lead at Stripe. We discuss improving the elusive\n\"product sense,\" a relevant skill for all product managers. Previously,\nShreyas served as a director of product management at Twitter and a group\nproduct manager at Google and Yahoo!.\n\ni\ufe0f\n\nThis is an excerpt of an interview on 10-30-50 product management.\n\nThe first step to enhance your product sense is to understand what it means. I\ndefine it as the skill to make the right decisions, even when things are\nunclear.\n\nThis applies to all levels: from deciding on what products we should create,\nto the details of user interactions and interfaces, and everything in between.\nThis is what product sense is all about.\n\nThere are three main parts to product sense.\n\nEmpathize with users, explore the market, and get creative with your\nsolutions.\n\n  * User empathy. This means imagining how different people will react to situations. For example, how users, partners, or competitors might respond to what we do.\n  * Domain knowledge: The better you understand your area, the better your ideas will be. This means knowing your customers, your competitors, and the possibilities and limits of your technology.\n  * Being Creative. This is about thinking differently and developing new ideas for problems or situations.\n\nImproving your product sense involves developing more empathy, growing your\ndomain knowledge, and boosting your creativity.\n\nTo enhance your empathy, interact with diverse users and partners. Instead of\nsimply acquiring information, understand the reasons behind their responses.\nThis understanding lets you predict user reactions even when they're not\npresent.\n\nAnother strategy is to deepen your understanding of psychology. Engaging with\ncognitive biases, behavioural economics, and general psychology literature can\nhelp you build user archetypes and empathize with them.\n\nDomain knowledge requires identifying relevant resources and reviewing them\nregularly. Books, online resources, and podcasts can be useful for this\npurpose.\n\nIf you're building smartphone apps, use as many apps as possible. Scrutinize\nthe details and ask questions about design choices. When faced with a\nchallenge, draw on your extensive experience, enabling creativity through\npattern recognition.\n\n## Acing PM interviews\n\nLanding a product job requires more than just applying!\n\nSpend time understanding the companies you want to work for, practice top\nquestions alone and with peers, and build a story bank for your big day.\n\n  1.
