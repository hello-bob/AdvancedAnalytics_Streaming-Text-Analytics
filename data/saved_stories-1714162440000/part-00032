Before you do, steel yourself for what\u2019s to come: A normal person\ncould easily mistake his rambling train wrecks of thought for a crackpot\u2019s\nravings, but influential Silicon Valley billionaires regard him as a genius.\n\n\u201cBalaji has the highest rate of output per minute of good new ideas of anybody\nI\u2019ve ever met,\u201d wrote Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the VC firm Andreessen-\nHorowitz, in a blurb for Balaji\u2019s 2022 book, The Network State: How to Start a\nNew Country. The book outlines a plan for tech plutocrats to exit democracy\nand establish new sovereign territories. I mentioned Balaji\u2019s ideas in two\nprevious stories about Network State-related efforts in California\u2014a proposed\ntech colony called California Forever and the tech-funded campaign to capture\nSan Francisco\u2019s government.\n\nBalaji, a 43-year-old Long Island native who goes by his first name, has a\nsolid Valley pedigree: He earned multiple degrees from Stanford University,\nfounded multiple startups, became a partner at Andreessen-Horowitz and then\nserved as chief technology officer at Coinbase. He is also the leader of a\ncultish and increasingly strident neo-reactionary tech political movement that\nsees American democracy as an enemy. In 2013, a New York Times story headlined\n\u201cSilicon Valley Roused by Secession Call\u201d described a speech in which he \u201ctold\na group of young entrepreneurs that the United States had become \u2018the\nMicrosoft of nations\u2019: outdated and obsolescent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe speech won roars from the audience at Y Combinator, a leading start-up\nincubator,\u201d reported the Times. Balaji paints a bleak picture of a dystopian\nfuture in a U.S. in chaos and decline, but his prophecies sometimes fall\nshort. Last year, he lost one million dollars in a public bet after wrongly\npredicting a massive surge in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nStill, his appetite for autocracy is bottomless. Last October, Balaji hosted\nthe first-ever Network State Conference. Garry Tan\u2014the current Y Combinator\nCEO who\u2019s attempting to spearhead a political takeover of San\nFrancisco\u2014participated in an interview with Balaji and cast the effort as part\nof the Network State movement. Tan, who made headlines in January after\ntweeting \u201cdie slow motherfuckers\u201d at local progressive politicians, frames his\ncampaign as an experiment in \u201cmoderate\u201d politics. But in a podcast interview\none month before the conference, Balaji laid out a more disturbing and extreme\nvision.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really calling for is something like tech Zionism,\u201d he said, after\ncomparing his movement to those started by the biblical Abraham, Jesus Christ,\nJoseph Smith (founder of Mormonism), Theodor Herzl (\u201cspiritual father\u201d of the\nstate of Israel), and Lee Kuan Yew (former authoritarian ruler of Singapore).\nBalaji then revealed his shocking ideas for a tech-governed city where\ncitizens loyal to tech companies would form a new political tribe clad in gray\nt-shirts. \u201cAnd if you see another Gray on the street...you do the nod,\u201d he\nsaid, during a four-hour talk on the Moment of Zen podcast. \u201cYou\u2019re a fellow\nGray.\u201d\n\nThe Grays\u2019 shirts would feature \u201cBitcoin or Elon or other kinds of logos ... Y\nCombinator is a good one for the city of San Francisco in particular.\u201d Grays\nwould also receive special ID cards providing access to exclusive, Gray-\ncontrolled sectors of the city. In addition, the Grays would make an alliance\nwith the police department, funding weekly \u201cpoliceman\u2019s banquets\u201d to win them\nover.\n\n\u201cGrays should embrace the police, okay? All-in on the police,\u201d said\nSrinivasan. \u201cWhat does that mean? That\u2019s, as I said, banquets. That means\nevery policeman\u2019s son, daughter, wife, cousin, you know, sibling, whatever,\nshould get a job at a tech company in security.\u201d\n\nIn exchange for extra food and jobs, cops would pledge loyalty to the Grays.\nSrinivasan recommends asking officers a series of questions to ascertain their\npolitical leanings. For example: \u201cDid you want to take the sign off of Elon\u2019s\nbuilding?\u201d\n\nThis refers to the August 2023 incident in which Elon Musk illegally installed\na large flashing X logo atop Twitter headquarters, in violation of building\nsafety codes. City inspectors forced him to remove it. This was the second\ntime Musk had run afoul of the city in his desire to refurbish his\nheadquarters: In July, police briefly halted his attempt to pry the \u201cTwitter\u201d\nsignage from the building\u2019s exterior. But in Balaji\u2019s dystopia, he implies\nthat officers loyal to the Grays would let Musk do as he pleases\n(democratically-inclined officers, he suggests, can be paid to retire).\n\nSimply put, there is a ton of fascist-chic cosplay involved. Once an officer\njoins the Grays, they get a special uniform designed by their tech overlords.\nThe Grays will also donate heavily to police charities and \u201cmerge the Gray and\npolice social networks.\u201d Then, in a show of force, they\u2019ll march through the\ncity together.\n\n\u201cA huge win would be a Gray Pride Parade with 50,000 Grays,\u201d said Srinivasan.\n\u201cThat would start to say: \u2018Whose streets? Our streets!\u2019 You have the AI Flying\nSpaghetti Monster. You have the Bitcoin parade. You have the drones flying\noverhead in formation ... You have bubbling genetic experiments on beakers ...\nYou have the police at the Gray Pride Parade. They\u2019re flying the Anduril\ndrones...\u201d\n\nEveryone would be welcome at the Gray Pride march\u2014everyone, that is, except\nthe Blues. Srinivasan defines the Blue political tribe as the liberal voters\nhe implies are responsible for the city\u2019s problems. Blues will be banned from\nthe Gray-controlled zones, said Balaji, unlike Republicans (\u201cReds\u201d).\n\n\u201cReds should be welcomed there, and people should wear their tribal colors,\u201d\nsaid Srinivasan, who compared his color-coded apartheid system to the Bloods\nvs. Crips gang rivalry. \u201cNo Blues should be welcomed there.\u201d\n\nWhile the Blues would be excluded, they would not be forgotten. Srinivasan\nimagines public screenings of anti-Blue propaganda films: \u201cIn addition to\ncelebrating Gray and celebrating Red, you should have movies shown about Blue\nabuses ... There should be lots of stories about what Blues are doing that is\nbad.\u201d\n\nBalaji goes on\u2014and on. The Grays will rename city streets after tech figures\nand erect public monuments to memorialize the alleged horrors of progressive\nDemocratic governance. Corporate logos and signs will fill the skyline to\nsignify Gray dominance of the city. \u201cEthnically cleanse,\u201d he said at one\npoint, summing up his idea for a city purged of Blues (this, he says, will\nprevent Blues from ethnically cleansing the Grays first). The idea, he said,\nis to do to San Francisco what Musk did to Twitter.\n\n\u201cElon, in sort of classic Gray fashion ... captures Twitter and then, at one\nstroke, wipes out millions of Blues\u2019 status by wiping out the Blue Checks,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cAnother stroke ... [he] renames Twitter as X, showing that he has true\ncontrol, and it\u2019s his vehicle, and that the old regime isn\u2019t going to be\nrestored.\u201d\n\nThose who try to downplay Balaji\u2019s importance in Silicon Valley often portray\nhim as a \u201cclown.\u201d But Donald Trump taught us that clowns can be dangerous,\nespecially those with proximity to influence and power. In the nearly eleven\nyears since his secession speech at Y Combinator, Balaji\u2019s politics have\nbecome even more stridently authoritarian and extremist, yet he remains a\ncelebrated figure in key circles.\n\nHe has one million followers on X-Twitter, where Musk regularly boosts him.\nTim Ferriss and Lex Fridman, two influential podcasters, have interviewed him.\n\u201cBalaji is a friend of mine and is neither a dumbshit nor a clown,\u201d tweeted\neconomics blogger Noah Smith last June, defending Balaji from critics. Alex\nLieberman, co-founder of the Morning Brew newsletter, recently listed Balaji\nat the top of what appears to be his ranked wish list of guests for an\nupcoming How to Start a Startup podcast (Musk and Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg\nranked sixth and fourteenth, respectively). This week, he will headline\nToken2049, a sold-out conference in Dubai that bills itself as the \u201cpremier\ncrypto event.\u201d\n\nEven more disturbing, however, is Balaji\u2019s tight connection with Tan, the Y\nCombinator CEO who has publicly aligned himself with the Network State for\nyears. \u201cI legit believe [Y Combinator] is a prototype model for what @balajis\ntalks about when he says the Network State,\u201d wrote Tan in August 2022, shortly\nbefore he was named CEO. Over the past two years, as Musk has transformed\nTwitter into a right-wing information weapon, Tan has used the platform, along\nwith his bully pulpit at Y Combinator, to wage all-out war for political\ncontrol of San Francisco. This fits with Balaji\u2019s recommendation that, as an\nalternative to forming new cities, tech zillionaires can use elections to\nseize existing governments.\n\nIncreasingly, Tan has also pursued another key Network State goal: attacking\njournalists. Balaji portrays the press, especially The New York Times, as the\nchief enemy of the Network State ideology. He accuses the venerable paper of\nupholding something called \u201cwoke capital.\u201d\n\n\u201cWoke Capital is the ideology of America\u2019s ruling class as explicated by\nAmerica\u2019s ruling newspaper, The New York Times,\u201d wrote Balaji in his book.\n\u201cIt\u2019s capitalism that enables decentralized censorship, cancel culture, and\nAmerican empire.\u201d Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger, whom Balaji characterizes\nas a \u201crich white male nepotist,\u201d especially irks him. \u201cWhat if Sulzberger is\nmore like Keyser S\u00f6ze?\u201d wrote Balaji, comparing Sulzberger to the mysterious\ncriminal mastermind in 1995\u2019s The Usual Suspects. \u201cWhat if his employees are\nhighly self-interested professional prevaricators? What if they\u2019ve always been\nlike that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo long as you aren\u2019t running a corporation based on hereditary nepotism\nwhere the current guy running the show inherits the company from his father\u2019s\nfather\u2019s father\u2019s father, you\u2019re more diverse and democratic than the owners\nof The New York Times Company. You don\u2019t need to take lectures from them, from\nanyone in their employ, or really from anyone in their social circle\u2014which\nincludes all establishment journalists.\u201d\n\nThe solution, he says, is to create rival media outlets\u2014\u201cparallel\u201d forms of\njournalism controlled by tech plutocrats. Both he and Tan point to Musk\u2019s\ntransformation of Twitter as a perfect example of parallel media: a propaganda\nmachine that smears real journalism as \u201cfake\u201d while aggressively promoting\ndisinformation.\n\nOver the past year, Tan has ramped up his attacks on reporters at The San\nFrancisco Chronicle, The San Francisco Standard, and Mission Local. \u201cIf you\nwant to understand why we got here, you have to understand three things,\u201d Tan\nwrote in an anti-media Twitter screed last year. \u201c1/The local political\nmachine and the local media (Chronicle, Mission Local) are complicit in\nkeeping it this way, supporting the worst, most corrupt candidates and\nrepeating their propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody likes this article,\u201d he tweeted at the Standard, owned by billionaire\nMichael Moritz, after the site published a feature about a progressive leader\nlast year. \u201cFix your headline,\u201d he commanded in a tweet after it published a\nstory about a Cruise robo-taxi hitting a pedestrian in October.\n\n\u201cMission Local besmirches the city with unbalanced coverage that only\nemboldens Preston, Peskin, Chan,\u201d he wrote in November, name-checking three of\nthe elected officials upon whom he would later wish a \u201cslow death.\u201d\n\nAmid his drunken tweet scandal, Tan paused such attacks. He hired a public\nrelations consultant, apologized, and ceased sending out caustic\ntweets\u2014temporarily. Then, on March 29, the Times published a favorable profile\nof him. Written by former Chronicle columnist Heather Knight, it characterized\nhim as a \u201cmiddle-of-the-road\u201d Democrat agitating for \u201ccommon sense\u201d ideas. Tan\ncame across as contrite and humble, a civic-minded centimillionaire who let\nhis passion for political change get the best of him. \u201cMr. Tan has tried to\nlearn from his online mess\u2014or says he has,\u201d wrote Knight. \u201cIn person, he\nspeaks kindly and calmly and smiles often, frequently bowing to people while\nmaking a prayer gesture with his hands.\u201d\n\nProgressives groaned at what they saw as a conspicuous whitewashing of Tan\u2019s\nbehavior. Tan proudly shared the piece on social media. He has nevertheless\nreturned to his old antics. \u201cSF legacy media is dishonest and lies to you,\u201d he\nwrote to his 428,000 followers on April 1.\n\nWhat\u2019s stunning, however, is the degree to which coverage of Tan has been\nquite evenhanded and fair, if not positive. The press has unquestioningly\naccepted the framing that he represents moderate or \u201ccommon sense\u201d politics.\nNot one local story has mentioned his long affiliation with Balaji or the\nNetwork State cult that is currently trying to create tech-controlled cities\naround the globe, and which maintains a fascination with an alt-right, neo-\nfascist movement known as the \u201cDark Enlightenment.\u201d (In 2021, Cade Metz of the\nTimes wrote that Balaji had suggested targeting journalists who mention these\nconnections. \u201cIf things get hot, it may be interesting to sic the Dark\nEnlightenment audience on a single vulnerable hostile reporter to dox them and\nturn them inside out with hostile reporting sent to *their*\nadvertisers/friends/contacts,\u201d wrote Balaji in an email viewed by the Times.)\nIn a twisted way, these omissions almost lend credence to claims that\nmainstream press outlets don\u2019t tell us what\u2019s really going on.\n\nIn the aftermath of Tan\u2019s death threat tweets, both the Chronicle and the\nStandard hesitated for at least a day before publishing full stories. For a\nmoment, it seemed unclear whether they would cover it at all. Yet despite the\nlocal media\u2019s generally fair approach and the puffy Times glow-up, Tan\ncontinues to rage against the press. Nothing less than absolute control and\nfealty seems acceptable to the Network State types.\n\n\u201cDo not hire PR,\u201d tweeted Balaji on April 4, days after Tan\u2019s PR-wrangled\nTimes profile. \u201cThey want to \u2018train\u2019 you to talk to journos. But journos hate\nyou! So this is an obsolete model. Instead, just hire influencers. Build your\nown channel. And go direct.\u201d\n\nTan boosted the message to his feed.\n\nGil Duran @gilduran76\n\nGil Duran is a San Francisco journalist who previously served as editorial\npage editor of The Sacramento Bee and The San Francisco Examiner.\n\nRead More:\n\nPolitics, Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Big Tech, Balaji Srinivasan, Garry\nTan, California, Elon Musk, Plutocrats\n\nEditor\u2019s Picks\n\nDystopias\n\nHow Big Tech Is Ruining the Dream of AI\n\nMike Pearl\n\nDystopias\n\nMike Pearl\n\nHow Big Tech Is Ruining the Dream of AI\n\nThe Dystopians\n\nThe Tech Plutocrats Dreaming of a Right-Wing San Francisco\n\nGil Duran\n\nThe Dystopians\n\nGil Duran\n\nThe Tech Plutocrats Dreaming of a Right-Wing San Francisco\n\nPlatform Wars\n\nThe Red States Fighting the Good Fight Against Big Tech\n\nSandeep Vaheesan, Tara Pincock\n\nPlatform Wars\n\nSandeep Vaheesan, Tara Pincock\n\nThe Red States Fighting the Good Fight Against Big Tech\n\nDystopias\n\nThe People of Solano County Versus the Next Tech-Billionaire Dystopia\n\nGil Duran\n\nDystopias\n\nGil Duran\n\nThe People of Solano County Versus the Next Tech-Billionaire Dystopia\n\nBreaking News\n\nScathing\n\nUvalde Parent Obliterates Police Response to Texas University Protest\n\nHafiz Rashid\n\nScathing\n\nHafiz Rashid\n\nUvalde Parent Obliterates Police Response to Texas University Protest\n\nLooped in\n\nEven More People Were in on Trump\u2019s Hush-Money Scheme Than We Knew\n\nEllie Quinlan Houghtaling\n\nLooped in\n\nEllie Quinlan Houghtaling\n\nEven More People Were in on Trump\u2019s Hush-Money Scheme Than We Knew\n\noop\u2014\n\nKey Witness Says Trump Knew About Every Single Hush Money Payment\n\nHafiz Rashid\n\noop\u2014\n\nHafiz Rashid\n\nKey Witness Says Trump Knew About Every Single Hush Money Payment\n\n  * BREAKING NEWS\n  * POLITICS\n  * CLIMATE\n  * CULTURE\n  * MAGAZINE\n  * PODCASTS\n  * GAMES\n\n  * Events\n  * Travel\n  * Bookstore\n  * Donate\n  * Advertise\n  * FAQ\n  * Press\n  * Jobs\n  * Submissions\n\n  * Subscribe to The New Republic\n  * Sign Up for Our Newsletters\n\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookies Settings\n  * Copyright 2024 \u00a9 The New Republic.
