Genius indeed.\n\n  * Watch: Rare Second World War footage of Bletchley Park-linked MI6 intelligence heroes emerges, shared online\n  * Ticker tape and a binary message: Bank of England's new Alan Turing \u00a350 must be the nerdiest banknote ever\n  * Missing Alan Turing memorabilia to be returned to Blighty from the US, 36 years after it went walkabout\n  * Larry Ale-ison institute invests in Oxford pub linked to Tolkien, CS Lewis\n\nLed by Grady Booch, a software engineer famed for developing the Unified\nModeling Language, the social media reaction was swift and brutal.\n\n\"Absolute and complete trash. I hope that Turing's heirs sue you into\noblivion,\" he said on the social media platform now calling itself X.\n\nOne intrepid Twitter user went so far as to discuss the wisdom of the decision\nwith the Turing chatbot itself.\n\nThe response was that the choice \"raises important ethical considerations,\nincluding respect for the individual's legacy, the wishes they may have\nexpressed during their lifetime, and the feelings of their surviving family\nand members of the public.\"\n\nBut it didn't answer the question.\n\nThe point Genius Group is so wantonly missing is that Turing was a real person\nwhose life meant something, both in terms of the history of computing and\nmathematics, but also in society.\n\nIn 2009, then-UK prime minister Gordon Brown issued an unequivocal apology to\nTuring on behalf of the government. Shortly before he took his own life in\n1954, Turing was sentenced to chemical castration for being gay, which was\nillegal at the time.\n\nThat this legacy should be cheapened as a marketing trick speaks volumes about\ntoday's tech industry. Genius Group should be ashamed. It should remove the\nimage, end the campaign, and apologize. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Computer Science\n  * Encryption\n  * United Kingdom\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Computer Science\n  * Encryption\n  * United Kingdom\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * BBC\n  * Brexit\n  * British Armed Forces\n  * ESA\n  * Five Eyes\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Let's Encrypt\n  * London\n  * Parliament of the United Kingdom\n  * Scotland\n  * Signal\n  * TLS\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Education\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n  * Programming\n  * Security\n\n#### More about\n\n46 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Computer Science\n  * Encryption\n  * United Kingdom\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Computer Science\n  * Encryption\n  * United Kingdom\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * BBC\n  * Brexit\n  * British Armed Forces\n  * ESA\n  * Five Eyes\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Let's Encrypt\n  * London\n  * Parliament of the United Kingdom\n  * Scotland\n  * Signal\n  * TLS\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Education\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n  * Programming\n  * Security\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Australia\u2019s spies and cops want \u2018accountable encryption\u2019 - aka access to\nbackdoors\n\nAnd warn that AI is already being used by extremists to plot attacks\n\nPublic Sector8 days | 109\n\n#### Europol now latest cops to beg Big Tech to ditch E2EE\n\nDon't bore us, get to the chorus: You need less privacy so we can protect the\nchildren\n\nSecurity10 days | 24\n\n#### Watchdog reveals lingering Google Privacy Sandbox worries\n\nAd tech rewrite to replace web cookies still not to regulatory taste\n\nSecurity3 days | 10\n\n#### Java thriving after 30 years\n\nWhy OpenJDK is as important as ever in the big picture of IT\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Encrypted email service files DMA complaint claiming it vanished from\nGoogle Search\n\nTuta cries foul, Chocolate Factory denies service unreachable\n\nApplications6 days | 62\n\n#### If Britain is so bothered by China, why do these .gov.uk sites use\nChinese ad brokers?\n\nExclusive One wonders why are there adverts on public-sector portals at all\n\nResearch8 days | 106\n\n#### Some smart meters won't be smart at all once 2/3G networks mothballed\n\nUK reckoning with prospect of millions of homes with obsolete hardware\n\nNetworks13 days | 282\n\n#### UK unions publish AI bill to protect workers from 'risks and harms' of\ntech\n\nTUC questions government's approach so far\n\nAI + ML13 days | 3\n\n#### Why making pretend people with AGI is a waste of energy\n\nInterview Industrial revolution didn't give us human mimics, so why should AI\nthink like us, this computer scientist wonders\n\nAI + ML18 days | 61\n\n#### Apple's failure to duck UK antitrust probe could bring \u00a3785M windfall for\ndevs\n\nThat 30% app tax may turn out to be a hefty liability\n\nLegal20 days | 18\n\n#### Fancy building a replacement for Post Office's disastrous Horizon system?\n\n\u00a375 million in the offing in government tender\n\nPaaS + IaaS21 days | 106\n\n#### UK businesses shockingly unaware of how to handle security threats\n\nMany decide to make no changes after detecting a breach\n\nCyber-crime23 days | 23\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
