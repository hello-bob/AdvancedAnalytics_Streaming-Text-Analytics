Gavin Newsom at a press conference on September 28, 2022, in\nSan Francisco, California.\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nRachel M. Cohen is a senior reporter for Vox covering social policy. She\nfocuses on housing, schools, homelessness, child care, and abortion rights,\nand has been reporting on these issues for more than a decade.\n\nFor years, the easiest thing to do about building new housing was nothing.\n\nThe federal government largely deferred to state and local governments on\nmatters of land use, and states mostly deferred to local governments, which\ntypically defer to their home-owning constituents who back restrictive zoning\nlaws that bar new construction.\n\nThat\u2019s slowly changing as the housing supply crisis ripples across the\ncountry. Experts say the US is short somewhere between 3.8 million and 6.8\nmillion homes, and most renters feel priced out of the idea of homeownership\naltogether. The lack of affordable housing is causing homelessness to rise.\n\nIn Washington, DC, Congress has held more hearings on housing affordability\nrecently than it has in decades, and President Joe Biden has been ramping up\nattention on the housing crisis, promising to \u201cbuild, build, build\u201d to \u201cbring\nhousing costs down for good.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s at the state level where some of the most consequential change is\ntaking place.\n\nOver the last five years, Republican and Democratic legislators and governors\nin a slew of states have looked to update zoning codes, transform residential\nplanning processes, and improve home-building and design requirements. Some\nstates that have stepped up include Oregon, Florida, Montana, and California,\nas well as states like Utah and Washington. This year, Maryland, New York, and\nNew Jersey passed state-level housing legislation, and Colorado may soon\nfollow suit.\n\nNot all state-level bills have been equally ambitious in addressing the supply\ncrisis, and not all states have been successful at passing new laws,\nespecially on their first few tries. And some states have succeeded in passing\nhousing reform one year, only to strike out with additional bills the next.\nReal housing reform requires iterative and sustained legislative attention; it\nalmost never succeeds with just one bill signing.\n\nTrying to determine why exactly a housing reform bill passes or fails on the\nstate level can be difficult, though advocates say it certainly helps when a\ngovernor or other powerful state lawmaker invests time and political capital\nin mobilizing stakeholders together. Given that housing challenges are not\nspread equally across a state, sometimes it can be hard to decide whether to\npass statewide laws that apply equally to all communities or to pass more\ntargeted legislation aimed only at certain areas.\n\nPartly due to pressure from voters and from more organized pro-housing\nactivists, legislative trends are starting to emerge. More states and housing\nexperts are thinking not only about passing laws to boost housing production,\nbut also about how best to enforce those laws, close loopholes, and demand\ncompliance.\n\n### States can make it easier to build more housing in a wider variety of\nplaces\n\nWhile states typically grant local communities a lot of discretion in land use\npolicy, more lawmakers are realizing that balance may have tilted too far.\n\nAs researchers with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis outlined last\nfall, some states are now looking to increase housing production by enabling\nmore multifamily housing and accessory dwelling units (ADUs) to be built\nwithout having developers first seek approval from local planning agencies or\nelected boards. This accelerated construction process is known as building \u201cby\nright.\u201d\n\nFor example, Oregon passed a law in 2019 allowing fourplexes (a multifamily\nhome that typically houses four families under one roof) to be built anywhere\nin large cities and for duplexes to be built anywhere in mid-size cities.\nBefore, a developer would have needed to seek special permission to build such\nhousing.\n\nStates like Utah and Massachusetts are incentivizing the construction of new\nmultifamily housing near public transit, while states like California and\nFlorida are making it easier to build residential housing in places zoned for\nretail. Other states, like Maine and Vermont, are making it easier to build\nADUs, which are second (and smaller) residential units on the same plot of\nland as one\u2019s primary residence, like apartments or converted garages.\n\nState lawmakers sometimes impose new rules on localities to adjust their\nhousing planning requirements, which can mean lowering the barriers builders\nmust go through to begin construction or incentivizing cities to set more\nambitious targets for production. Sometimes it means easing requirements like\nminimum lot sizes or parking spot mandates.\n\n### Not all state-level bills will move the needle on the housing crisis\n\nUnder pressure to do something about the housing crisis, some state lawmakers\nare advancing bills that allow politicians to claim they\u2019re taking action,\nalthough the legislation itself is weak and unlikely to make big dents on the\nvarious problems. Some bills may even make affordability issues worse over the\nlong term.\n\nFor example, after failing to pass housing reform last year, lawmakers in New\nYork came together again this year to push something through. Democratic Gov.\nKathy Hochul and her allies in the state legislature are cheering their\nrecently agreed-upon housing package, which includes tenant protections and\nincentives to spur new construction, but experts and activists say it lacks\nreal ambitious zoning and production measures and will be unlikely to drive\nnew affordability.\n\nLikewise in Maryland, Democratic politicians are cheering the passage of a new\nstatewide housing reform package that includes renter protections and\nincentives to spur new affordable and dense development, though Yes-In-My-\nBackyard pro-housing advocates concede they do not expect the legislation to\ncreate much new housing, at least in the near term. Still, given that it was\nhousing advocates\u2019 first real attempt at passing statewide legislation in\nMaryland, they are hailing it as an impressive first step.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time the Maryland legislature overrode local zoning in a\npro-housing way, and I would say this is a surprisingly drastic shift from the\nstatus quo even though it\u2019s not enough,\u201d said Tom Coale, a housing lobbyist in\nMaryland.\n\n### When it comes to state-level housing reform, implementation and compliance\nmatter\n\nPassing legislation for housing reform on the state level is often just the\nfirst step, as opponents then sometimes seek to challenge the new laws in\ncourt or localities search for loopholes or other ways to avoid compliance.\nSometimes lawmakers water down housing production mandates and other\nenforcement mechanisms before the bills even pass through the legislature.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not uncommon for local communities to try and avoid compliance when\na housing law is first passed, some states have also been firing back in\nsubsequent sessions to close loopholes and ramp up penalties for local\ngovernments. While some statutes have strong enforcement mechanisms built in\nto begin with, many lawmakers are recognizing the housing reform process will\njust need to be dogged and responsive to resistance and new challenges.\n\nHousing experts with the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy say it\u2019s likely to\ntake at least three to five years after a statewide policy is passed before\nthe public should expect to see any real changes in housing production, and\nthey urge patience before claiming a reform has failed or succeeded.\n\n\u201cMany of the ambitious state housing policies that have been adopted are still\nin the early stages of implementation, so we don\u2019t yet have definitive\nevidence about what works and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d they wrote in September. \u201cWithout\nrealistic expectations about this time frame, pro-housing advocates may get\ndiscouraged, while opponents claim that zoning changes are ineffective\u2014all\nbefore the policies have kicked in.\u201d\n\nWill you support Vox today?\n\nWe believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.\nThat kind of knowledge helps create better citizens, neighbors, friends,\nparents, and stewards of this planet.
