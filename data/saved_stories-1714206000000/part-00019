In the meantime, here\nare some teaser shots of our new chassis parts we discussed in our last\nupdate, which we recently SLS printed for test fitting purposes:\n\nDue to a miscommunication, 3 pieces of our lens assembly came out in aluminum\n(though their fit still appears to be pretty good):\n\n# 2 Anton Bukov Investment\n\nWe recently received a $250,000 investment from Anton Bukov[1], a Simula One\npreorderer and founder of the 1inch Network. (Yes, this is our second\ninvestment from a high-profile person in the crypto community; but don't worry\nthough, we're not about to unveil a Simula Coin or some new blockchain project\n:))\n\nThough Anton has made lots of investments in crypto and DeFi spaces, we're\nonly his second VR investment, which we take as a pretty large vote a\nconfidence. All in all, we're super happy to receive his support!\n\n[1] For more background on Anton: he helped found the 1inch Network, which is\na DeFi platform that enables crypto users to exchange tokens across multiple\nliquidity sources within a single atomic transaction in a permissionless and\ndecentralized manner. Before 1inch, crypto users had two main methods for\nexchanging tokens: (i) through a centralized exchange (like Coinbase) or (ii)\nthrough a Decentralized Exchange (or \"DEX\"). 1inch introduced a third option:\nexchanging assets across multiple DEXes and via different intermediary assets\nto achieve optimal value flow and maximize the exchange rate. Five years after\nits inception, 1inch's algorithm, called Pathfinder, aggregates hundreds of\nprotocols with tens of thousands of pools on multiple chains. Today, 1inch is\na leading DeFi project empowering Web3 users with several revolutionary\nblockchain protocols and products such as an aggregator, wallet, developer\nportal, limit orders, and many more.

Variable costs (components). Principle components include raw materials, displays, lenses, NUC compute units, carrier boards, batteries, and cameras. Also included are things like fasteners, screws, and springs.\n  2. Labor costs (annually recurring). Includes salaries for our existing 3-person team, assembly labor (which scales with batch size), and money to hire additional engineers (also scales with batch size). We also include a small allocation towards legal and accounting expenses.\n  3. NRE costs (capital expenditures). Includes CNC, injection mold tools, assembly line setup (fixtures, applicators, fastening tools, etc), and lens tooling. A few of our suppliers also pass on some of their own NRE to us. We also include an allocation for regulatory compliance & testing.\n\nWith that in mind, our remaining costs range from ~$343 to $1M, depending upon\nour batch size target and runway length:\n\nUnits| 125 (1 Year of Runway)| 250 (1 Year of Runway)| 250 (1.5 Years of\nRunway)| 250 (2 Years of Runway)  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nVariable Costs (Components)| $418,783.55| $720,732.10| $720,732.10|\n$720,732.10  \nFixed Costs (Annually Recurring)| $405,240.00| $405,240.00| $607,860.00|\n$810,480.00  \nNRE Costs (Capital Expenditures)| $353,480.00| $348,328.00| $348,328.00|\n$348,328.00  \nTotal Costs Remaining| $1,177,503.55| $1,474,300.10| $1,676,920.10|\n$1,879,540.10  \n\u2193| \u2193| \u2193| \u2193  \nRemaining Funds Required| $343,447.85| $640,244.40| $842,864.40| $1,045,484.40  \n  \n# 4 Seeking Investment\n\nWe're still seeking investors -- both institutional and angels -- who align\nwith our VR computing vision. Interested parties (accredited investors) should\nreach out to me at georges@simulavr.com.\n\n## 4.1 Simula's Mission: VR which affirmatively replaces your laptop\n\nWe only care about one thing: using VR to make a more productive computing\ndevice.\n\nSimula's thesis: While most people have thought the future of VR/AR has been\nprimarily in games & entertainment, the truth is that VR offers a superior way\nfor performing knowledge work: more screens, bigger screens, improved\nimmersion, improved focus, more privacy, and fully portable freedom of\nmovement. In VR you can sit up, lean back, walk or even lay down while you\ncompute...all in a compact form factor that saves on desk space. We believe\nthat in the coming years, nearly every office worker in the developed world\nwill be using VR to perform their creative and professional office work. We\nwant to help make this future happen by building the first viable VR computing\ndevice, built over Linux Desktop.\n\nWith the recent release of Apple's headset, the age of ubiquitous VR computing\nis now closer than ever. Yet despite it being more than 10 years since the\nrelease of the original Oculus, people still cannot use any VR headset to\nrealistically replace their laptop (unfortunately, not even with the Vision\nPro). Overall, we want to give people an alternative to Meta and Apple's\nconstrained devices: one that is based on Linux Desktop (preferred by software\ndevelopers) instead of the Android/iOS ecosystems existing headsets are built\nover, and one which is focused on productive desktop computing over casual\ngaming, social networking, or the passive consumption of entertainment.\n\nThe Simula One is our first iteration towards this goal. Its selling points\ninclude:\n\n  * Native VR computing (not WiFi streaming). No latency or bandwidth limitations to deal with from tethering to another host.\n\n  * Insanely good text clarity. Excellent 35.5 PPD pixel density (e.g., 56% higher than the Quest Pro, 42% higher than the Quest 3, & 220% higher than the Valve Index). This is extremely important for facilitating multi-hour VR sessions without eye fatigue.\n\n  * 100% office app coverage (via Linux Desktop). Any app that runs on a premium Linux laptop runs on our headset. Your native apps are not limited to Android or iOS platforms.\n\n  * Laptop level compute specs. Includes specs comparable to premium office laptops (i7 13th gen processor, x86 architecture, up to 32GB of RAM).\n\n  * AR Mode for touch typing. High-resolution passthrough cameras allow you to see your environment and keyboard while you compute.\n\n  * Proper hackability. Simula is built over FOSS, and isn't tethered to Meta, Apple, or other platforms. If there's something about our headset you want to change or tweak, you're free to do so.\n\nIf you find our VR computing vision compelling, and are in a position to help\nus in the form of investment, let us know!
