We had seen what\nmakes a competitive team, and what we would need to do to replicate that for\nourselves. Our new team, 23650, quickly became a force to be reckoned with in\nNew Jersey. We established ourselves, building relationships with local and\ninternational teams, sponsors, and our community. We hit our fair share of\nroadblocks this season. The robot broke (many times), we had to redesign\ncountless mechanisms, and we were always working against the clock when\ngetting ready for competitions. But we prevailed. The team was incredibly\ndedicated and I couldn't be more grateful for their tireless commitment.\n\nAfter winning our regional championship (and the 2nd place Inspire award), we\nwere champions of the Parkway divison at the state championship, and we ended\nas state finalists after 2 closely contested finals matches.\n\nI have learned a lot this year, and I hope to share with you some ideas on\nwhat helped us succeed this year. Even if you don't participate in the FTC\ncompetition, I believe you can take something away from these points.\n\n1\\. Emphasize team chemistry\n\nStrong team chemistry is incredibly underrated. But I believe that it can make\nor break a team. If you foster an environment of growth, your team feels\nexcited to participate. You can count on dedication. Dedication and hard work\nare the most important guarantors of success. Engineering skill can be\nlearned, but commitment has to be fostered.\n\n2\\. Recognize the importance of outreach\n\nBuilding a cool robot is only half of the FTC competition. Outreach is equally\nas important. We emailed as many local businesses as we could for sponsorhips.\nWe also secured a rookie team grant. And we mentored local and international\nFTC teams, including teams from Brasil and Kazakhstan. Our engineering\nporfolio details all of our outreach commitments this year. I hope it gives\nyou some inspiration.\n\n3\\. Build a community\n\nFIRST is all about fostering community. By participating in this competition,\nI quickly found a community of like-minded individuals, who have become my\nclosest friends. There are many resources such as the FTC Discord server which\nprovide platforms for communication with participants from around the world.\nAs important as it is to maintain a global network, I also believe it is also\nincredibly important to build a local community. This year, with help from a\nfriend from another FTC team in New Jersey, I formed the Garden States\nAlliance, a New Jersey focused community of FTC participants. It has grown to\nrepresent 200+ members from many NJ teams. Through this community, like-minded\nindividuals share ideas and discuss the competition. We help each other\nsucceed. At states, many teams could be seen donning our Garden State Alliance\nstickers. Find your community, I promise it can change your life.\n\n4\\. Develop strong relationships with local teams\n\nThis point is similar to the idea of building a community. It is incredibly\nimportant to be familiar with your local teams. In a competition where teams\nmust form alliances to win, having strong connections with local teams can be\nextremely beneficial. In the lead up to states, we had scrimmages to prepare,\ndeveloping combined autons and perfecting our match strategy. This eventually\nallowed us to be picked in the first seed alliance in our division. The\nconnections we had fostered were essential to this happening, and I believe\nour outcome at states would have been vastly different had we not developed\nthe relationships that we did.\n\nAttached here is our Engineering Portfolio for the season. There is a lot of\ntechnical information as well as information about our outreach efforts this\nseason. I hope you can draw some inspiration from it.\n\nI want to extend a special thank you to my mentors and all the incredibly\ntalented and special members of my team. Thank you for making this year so\nspecial.\n\n\u2190 Back to blogs\n\n", "frontpage": false}
