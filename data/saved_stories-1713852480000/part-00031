With RSA\napproaching, here are some female founders and leaders to follow who are\nleveling the playing field:\n\n  * Rita Gurevich is the founder and CEO of SPHERE Technology Solutions, a cybersecurity company that protects identities and data for Fortune 100 financial, healthcare, retail and energy companies globally.\n  * Michelle Zatlyn is co-founder, president and COO at Cloudflare, which protects about 20% of the world\u2019s Internet traffic \u2013 with more than 300 of the Fortune 1,000 companies as customers.\n  * Masha Sedova is co-founder of Elevate Security, a platform that enables organizations to identify risky employees, reduce the likelihood of future incidents and proactively defend their workforce.\n  * Jennifer Andre is vice president of product at Greynoise Intelligence, which analyzes internet background noise to reduce false positive security alerts and identify emerging threats.\n  * Shilpi Bhattacharjee is co-founder of Kaizenteq, an ed-tech company and community that dives into cloud security.

Look for a\nlink at the bottom of this page to manage or withdraw consent in privacy and\ncookie settings.\n\nData preferences\n\n# Manage your data\n\nYou can choose how your personal data is used. Vendors want your permission to\ndo the following:\n\nTCF vendors\n\n## Store and/or access information on a device\n\nCookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers,\nrandomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other\ninformation (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size,\nsupported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise\nit each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the\npurposes presented here.\n\nView details\n\n## Use limited data to select advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data,\nsuch as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your\ndevice type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for\nexample, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\n\nView details\n\n## Create profiles for personalised advertising\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nView details\n\n## Use profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nView details\n\n## Create profiles to personalise content\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you\nsubmit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with\nother information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (which might for example include possible\ninterests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to\npresent content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests,\nsuch as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is\neven easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\n\nView details\n\n## Use profiles to select personalised content\n\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content\npersonalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other\nservices (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible\ninterests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the\norder in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to\nfind (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\n\nView details\n\n## Measure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nView details\n\n## Measure content performance\n\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact\nwith it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g.\nreached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance,\nwhether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a\nproduct description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you\nvisit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-\nadvertising) content that is shown to you.\n\nView details\n\n## Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from\ndifferent sources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nView details\n\n## Develop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nView details\n\n## Use limited data to select content\n\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as\nthe website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type,\nor which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to\nlimit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\n\nView details\n\n## Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\n\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly\nfraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots),\nand ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be\nused to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may\nencounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with\nthem.\n\nView details\n\n## Deliver and present advertising and content\n\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to\nensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to\nfacilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\n\nView details\n\n## Match and combine data from other data sources\n\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined\nwith other information relating to you and originating from various sources\n(for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a\nloyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the\npurposes explained in this notice.\n\nView details\n\n## Link different devices\n\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be\nconsidered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your\nhousehold (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both\nyour phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet\nconnection on both devices).\n\nView details\n\n## Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically\n\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it\nautomatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address\nof your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support\nof the purposes exposed in this notice.\n\nView details\n\n## Use precise geolocation data\n\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500\nmetres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\n\nView details\n\nVendor preferences\n\n# Confirm our vendors\n\nVendors can use your data to provide services.
