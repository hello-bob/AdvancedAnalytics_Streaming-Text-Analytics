How does it relate\nto the API?\n\nWhat's the difference between WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business?\n\nBy Typie\n\nWhatsApp marketing assistant\n\nPosted: March 07, 2024\n\nUpdated: April 26, 2024\n\nWhatsApp Business\n\nGet your cCom Book\n\n\u2705 Use WhatsApp for conversion \u2705 Use conversations for retention \u2705 Level up\ncustomer relationships\n\nWhat is WhatsApp Business web? How do you set it up and does it relate to the\nWhatsApp Business app or the API \u2013 or both? Find out in our starter guide.\n\nMost people spend their working day on a computer, not a phone.\n\nBut if you're a business that uses the WhatsApp Business app, you might find\nyourself having to use your phone to manage conversations and your account.\n\nLuckily, you have a handy alternative at your fingertips: WhatsApp Business\nweb.\n\nThis desktop version of the WhatsApp Business app is for those who prefer to\nmanage their WhatsApp conversations with customers on their computer.\n\nBecause when you're doing business, sometimes you want to leave your personal\nlife to your smartphone and keep your desktop strictly business. Or you just\nfind it easier to type on a keyboard.\n\nWhatsApp Business web lets WhatsApp Business app users manage chats and\nfeatures on their laptop or PC, so they don't have to do everything on their\nphone.\n\nThis blog post helps you understand the essentials of WhatsApp Business web.\n\n## What you'll learn:\n\n  * What is WhatsApp Business web\n  * Can I use WhatsApp Business on desktop?\n  * Benefits of WhatsApp Business web\n  * Key features of WhatsApp Business web\n  * How to set up WhatsApp Business on your desktop\n  * The difference between WhatsApp Business web and the WhatsApp API\n  * Why larger enterprises aiming to maximize profit should partner with a WhatsApp Business Solution Provider like charles\n\n## What is WhatsApp Business web?\n\nWhatsApp Business Web is a desktop user interface that lets WhatsApp Business\napp users manage their customer WhatsApp communications directly from a web\nbrowser or desktop application.\n\nIt mirrors the functionality of the mobile app, offering features such as\nautomated greetings, quick replies, and the ability to organize contacts and\nchats with labels.\n\nThis tool is particularly useful for businesses seeking to enhance their\ncustomer service and engagement strategies without constantly relying on a\nmobile device.\n\nIt's similar to WhatsApp web for private WhatsApp users, but with business\nfunctionality \u2013 and is only available to users of the WhatsApp Business app.\n\n### Or use the WhatsApp Messenger app on your desktop\n\nWhatsApp Business web lets you use your browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox or\nother) to use WhatsApp on your desktop, but you can also download the WhatsApp\nMessenger app directly on your laptop, iMac or PC:\n\n  1. Download the Windows WhatsApp Messenger app\n\nThis is how WhatsApp Messenger app looks on a Windows device (Image: WhatsApp)\n\n2\\. Download the Mac WhatsApp Messenger app\n\nThis is how WhatsApp Messenger app looks on a Windows device (Image: WhatsApp)\n\n## Can I use WhatsApp Business on desktop?\n\nYes, businesses can extend operations to the web by linking their WhatsApp\nBusiness account to WhatsApp web or the desktop application.\n\nThis integration provides the flexibility to use the same functionality and\ndata as the mobile app, directly from a desktop:\n\n  * Send and receive messages\n  * Share files\n  * Use the same automated messaging features\n\nYou can access WhatsApp Business on your desktop through:\n\n  1. WhatsApp web url in your browser: web.whatsapp.com\n  2. Downloading WhatsApp Business app for your\n\n## Benefits of WhatsApp Business web\n\nWhy should you get set up to use WhatsApp Business web when you already have\nthe app?\n\nHere are a few reasons WhatsApp life can be easier on your desktop:\n\n  * Immediate access: Quickly respond to customer WhatsApp queries from the comfort of your desktop. Typing is easier on a keyboard than a mobile phone (save your thumbs).\n  * Efficiency at its best: Handle multiple conversations simultaneously without switching devices.\n  * Keeps your mobile free: Continue other tasks on your phone while managing business chats on the desktop.\n\n  * Use WhatsApp on your computer even when your phone is off.\n  * Be more productive with multi-tasking and faster typing on a larger keyboard.\n  * Use WhatsApp on a bigger screen for more comfort and to view and share your media and files with others.\n  * Use the WhatsApp Mac or Windows app to make voice calls with up to 32 people and video calls with up to 8 people.\n\nWhatsApp Business app on mobile: fits in your pocket, but maybe not with your\nworking life\n\n(Image: WhatsApp)\n\nWhatsApp Business on a desktop: roomier and easier to type into (Image:\nTechCrunch)\n\n## Key features of WhatsApp Business web\n\nWhatsApp web for WhatsApp Business users is not so different from the app, but\nhere are the key features:\n\n  * Desktop notifications: Stay on top of messages without constantly checking your phone.\n  * File sharing made easy: Drag and drop documents, images, and more directly into your chats.\n  * Quick search: Find messages, contacts, or chat histories in seconds.\n\n## Features that aren't supported on WhatsApp Business web\n\nThese features aren't supported:\n\n  * Viewing live location\n\n  * Creating and viewing Broadcast Lists\n\n  * Interacting with businesses using WhatsApp Flows\n\n## The difference between WhatsApp Business web and WhatsApp API\n\nWhile WhatsApp Business web caters to small and medium-sized enterprises with\nits user-friendly interface, larger companies with more complex communication\nneeds may find it limiting.\n\nHere's where the WhatsApp API (officially: WhatsApp Business Platform) comes\ninto play.\n\nUnlike the web version, the WhatsApp API allows for integration with existing\nbusiness systems, enabling automated, high-volume messaging and advanced\ncustomer interaction analytics.\n\nIt's designed for enterprises requiring a more robust solution to handle\ncustomer communications at scale.\n\nIf you're a larger company looking to use WhatsApp Business, you'll need to\nuse the WhatsApp API through a WhatsApp Business Solution Provider (BSP) like\ncharles.
