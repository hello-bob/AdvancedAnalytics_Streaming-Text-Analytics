games\n\nWorldwide Exchange\n\nArcade giant Dave & Buster\u2019s is taking its games to a new level by offering\nsocial wagering on its app.\n\nCustomers can soon make a friendly $5 wager on a Hot Shots basketball game, a\nbet on a Skee-Ball competition or on another arcade game. The betting\nfunction, expected to launch in the next few months, will work through the\ncompany\u2019s app.\n\nDave & Buster\u2019s, started in 1982, now has more than 222 venues in North\nAmerica, offering everything from bowling to laser tag, plus virtual reality.\nThe company says it has five million loyalty members and 30 million unique\nvisitors to its locations each year. The company\u2019s stock is up more than 50%\nover the past year.\n\nAs a boom in betting increases engagement among sports fans, digital\ngamification could have a similar effect within Dave & Buster\u2019s customer base\nby allowing loyalty members to compete with one another and earn rewards.\nUltimately, it could mean people spend more time and money at the venues.\n\nDave and Buster\u2019s is using technology by gamification software company Lucra.\n\nA general view of the atmosphere during The SDI Takeover @ Dave & Buster\u2019s in\nLos Angeles on June 23, 2022\n\nTiffany Rose | Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to work with Lucra to bring this exciting new gaming platform\nto our customers,\u201d said Simon Murray, senior vice president of entertainment\nand attractions at Dave & Buster\u2019s. \u201cThis new partnership gives our loyalty\nmembers real-time, unrivaled gaming experiences, and reinforces our commitment\nto continuing to elevate our customer experience through innovative, cutting-\nedge technology.\u201d\n\nLucra and Dave & Buster\u2019s said there will be a limit placed on the size of\nbets it will allow, but that they\u2019re not publicly disclosing that threshold\njust yet. Lucra said across its history the average bet size has been $10.\n\nLucra, created in 2019 by then-Stanford Graduate School of Business classmates\nDylan Robbins and Michael Madding, is a software platform that allows users to\ncompete for real money on friendly competitions. Robbins and Madding\npreviously worked together at Goldman Sachs.\n\n\u201cLucra helps our partners drive user adoption, increase retention and\nengagement and add new monetization streams to their business,\u201d said Robbins,\nLucra\u2019s CEO.\n\nRobbins and Madding saw the incredible growth of legal sports betting, but\nsought to capitalize on the recreational wagers taking place between peers.\nThe company has raised about $14 million with investors that include\nbillionaire investor Marc Lasry, former and current professional athletes John\nIsner and Julie and Zach Ertz, along with the Raptor Group and SeventySix\nCapital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a new form of kind of a digital experience for folks inside of\nthese ecosystems,\u201d said Madding, Lucra\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWe\u2019re\ngetting them to engage in a new way and spend more time and money,\u201d he added.\n\nLucra says its skills-based games are not subject to the same licenses and\nregulations gambling operators face with games of chance. Lucra is careful not\nto use the term \u201cbet\u201d or \u201cwager\u201d to describe its games.\n\n\u201cWe use real-money contests or challenges,\u201d Madding said.\n\nLucra\u2019s contests are only available to players age 18 and older. The contests\nare available in 44 states.\n\nThe social betting category is a $6 billion industry, according to gaming\nresearch firm Eilers & Krejcik. Several companies such as Fliff and ReBet have\nemerged, hoping to mimic the success of the gambling industry and capture a\nyounger market.\n\nLucra recently signed a deal with Dupr, the pickleball ratings system, and\nTennisOne, a tennis app, to allow players to compete against one another for\nreal money. Lucra\u2019s app has been downloaded 150,000 times, facilitated more\nthan one million unique contests on the platform and collected more than $20\nmillion of handle, according to the company.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re playing pickleball with your friends or playing golf on the\nweekend, we help to amplify that and digitize that experience with our\npartners,\u201d said Robbins.\n\nTV\n\nClosing BellWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Closing Bell 04:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
