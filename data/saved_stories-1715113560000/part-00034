RealVNC is installed by default\non Pi OS, and has been for a long time, and many Pi users came to rely on it\nfor remote Pi access.\n\nWhen Pi OS 12 'Bookworm' was launched, they switched from X11 to Wayland, and\na number of GUI-reliant apps needed tweaks. RealVNC hasn't been updated to\nwork with Wayland, so it is not runnable by default on the latest Pis or Pi\nOS\u2014though you can force Pi OS back to X11 instead of Wayland to get RealVNC\nworking.\n\nI've been using Connect for a few weeks in early beta access, and it's been\nabout as decent as any other VNC solution. It's not quite as good as\nMicrosoft's Remote Desktop under bandwidth-constrained use, but it's not bad\neither.\n\nIn this video, I go over use from home to the office (wired cable and fiber\nInternet) to use on a slow 5G connection (< 1 Mbps with 500ms ping times), and\nin all cases it's usable, but it's certainly less enjoyable on the slow\nconnection!\n\nThere are a few quirks about Connect, like on mobile (I tested on my iPad and\niPhone), there's no way to bring up the virtual keyboard, so text entry is\nimpossible unless you use a USB or Bluetooth keyboard.\n\nRealVNC has a full mobile app, so you're able to fully control a remote PC,\nMac, or Linux machine much more easily.\n\nAlso, Raspberry Pi Connect can do odd things like pick the wrong display if\nyou have multiple monitors connected. You can switch displays in the Pi OS\nsettings, but RealVNC, again, handles that situation better, allowing you to\npick a monitor directly in its own UI, or show all monitors.\n\nThere are a number of other advantages to RealVNC as well, like multi-user\naccounts, so I hope they will update to work with Wayland soon. But it's nice\nto have a free option directly from Raspberry Pi. Especially when it's so\nsimple to use.\n\nI'm especially happy Raspberry Pi added a basic CLI to rpi-connect\u2014you can\neven sign into the service on a Pi over SSH with the command rpi-connect\nsignin. Copy out the URL, log in via a browser, and the Pi will connect\nheadlessly:\n\nYou do need to be running the full desktop Pi OS\u2014Pi OS Lite won't work. And\nyou also need auto-login enabled... at least for the time being. Eventually, I\nimagine you'll be able to configure Raspberry Pi Connect while flashing the OS\nusing Raspberry Pi Imager, but the service is in Beta, so I'm sure things will\nchange quickly!\n\nI'm sure some people better suited to discussing Connect's security will do\nthat in good time, but I didn't see anything bad in that regard in my initial\ntesting. Keeping the service so simple helps keep the attack surface small.\nEspecially when the potential damage (allowing someone direct remote control\naccess to your Pi, and by extension, your network) is so great!\n\nI have a few other thoughts in the video embedded above, especially regarding\nwhether the service could be monetized at some point, but I'm interested in\nhearing your thoughts too!
