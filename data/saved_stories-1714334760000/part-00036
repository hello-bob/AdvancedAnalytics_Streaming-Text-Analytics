This freedom is\nincredibly rare on the internet today, and I\u2019m proud that Standard Notes has\nbecome one of the few places online that allows people a safe haven to think\nfreely.\n\nOur goal with Standard Notes has always been to build a principled service\nthat can endure. Which is why we\u2019re excited to announce we\u2019re joining forces\nwith Proton, the Swiss organization behind the end-to-end encrypted email\nservice Proton Mail (as well as Proton VPN, Proton Drive, and Proton Pass).\n\nProton is one of the few organizations that understands the challenges we face\nat Standard Notes. It\u2019s also a self-sustaining, mission-driven organization\nthat has rejected venture capital so it can focus on serving its community and\nprotecting the privacy of people around the world. By combining forces, both\nthe Proton and Standard Notes communities can ensure the internet of tomorrow\nhas a place where you can be free to think and act without the worry that\nsomeone is looking over your shoulders.\n\n## What this means for the Standard Notes community\n\nI agreed to join Proton because of how well-aligned we are in our goals and\nprinciples. This means you won\u2019t see any major changes in the Standard Notes\napps or organization. We will continue to work on designing and building the\nbest note-taking app on the planet. In particular:\n\n  * Standard Notes will continue to be open source\n  * Standard Notes apps will continue to undergo independent audits\n  * All current Standard Notes subscriptions (including 5-year plans) will continue to be honored and prices are staying the same\n  * We will continue to develop new features and updates for Standard Notes\n\nStandard Notes will continue to operate independently as a separate product\nwhile leveraging Proton\u2019s resources and experience to improve reliability and\nresilience for the long run.\n\nAs an engineer who has worked on a privacy-focused product for seven years, I\ncan tell you it\u2019s not easy work. Technology advances, new threats crop up,\noperating systems change\u2014the challenges are neverending. To protect your\ninformation, we have to constantly stay one step ahead.\n\nIn Proton, we\u2019ve found a partner who shares our focus on protecting privacy.\nIts teams of engineers are world-class in delivering powerful, user-first\ntechnologies that incorporate end-to-end and zero-access encryption. This\nshould help us deliver new features even faster (even though we\u2019ll never lose\nour love for simple and straightforward product design). Proton also has a\nfully staffed support team that can provide dependable guidance to any\nStandard Notes user who gets lost or needs help.\n\nProton also builds and runs its own server infrastructure to ensure privacy,\nsecurity, and high uptime. Joining Proton means Standard Notes gains access to\ncutting edge on-premise infrastructure along with a team of experts, allowing\nus to maintain the high standards we\u2019ve set for our uptime and address any\nincidents swiftly.\n\nWe already submit our apps to regular third-party audits, but we can now\ncollaborate with the Proton team to ensure even higher security standards.\n\nFinally, as we\u2019ve run Standard Notes these past seven years, we\u2019ve noticed a\nconsiderable overlap between our community and Proton\u2019s. We\u2019re excited to find\nways to integrate Standard Notes into the Proton ecosystem, expanding the\nfreedom and possibility for everyone.\n\n## Building a future where privacy is the default\n\nPartnering with Proton is a big announcement, but I feel like it\u2019s actually a\nway for us to stay razor-focused on our goals. Our intention has always been\nto build a small, sustainable organization that helps protect your right to\nkeep personal information private and preserve your freedom to think, speak,\nand act. Joining with Proton\u2014one of the rare organizations that can (and is\nwilling) to take a long-term approach\u2014gives us the best opportunity to achieve\nthis ambition.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to join Proton on its mission to build a better internet where\nprivacy is the default. Amidst the chaotic backdrop of big-tech surveillance\nand government overreach, our job is simple: give you the tools to think\nfreely and fearlessly. I believe our best work lies ahead.\n\nThanks for reading \u2713\n\n### \u2190 Nowhere to hide\n\n## A steel vault for your most sensitive data.\n\nStart using Standard Notes completely free on all your devices, with full end-\nto-end encryption and two-factor authentication.
