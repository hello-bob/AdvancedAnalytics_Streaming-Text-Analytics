At night, big\nrigs pull up to one end to unload boxes and padded mailers \u2013 some after a\nshort drive from a bigger warehouse down the road, others following a flight\nin the hold of a cargo plane. Waiting employees scan, sort and load them into\nrolling racks.\n\nBefore 7 a.m. each day, many of those racks are wheeled out to dozens of vans\nlined up in four painted lanes. It\u2019s the starting line at a Formula One race,\nbut for $22-an-hour delivery drivers who ferry bottles of shampoo and packs of\nbatteries to suburban Seattle doorsteps.\n\nTheir routes, the last step in a journey that can take products thousands of\nmiles, are the source of a large chunk of the carbon emissions Amazon has\npledged to eliminate in the coming decades.\n\nThe solution lies in the parking lot across the street: 309 Siemens electric\nvehicle (EV) chargers, which power delivery vans built by Rivian Automotive.\nMaking deliveries without tailpipe emissions, and increasing the size of the\nelectric fleet, is among the most straightforward ways Amazon can wipe carbon\nfrom its operations.\n\nIn a little more than two years, Amazon has installed more than 17,000\nchargers at about 120 warehouses around the US, making the retail giant the\nlargest operator of private electrical vehicle charging infrastructure in the\ncountry. \u201cWe\u2019ve figured out the path,\u201d said Tom Chempananical, who oversees\nAmazon\u2019s fleet of last-mile delivery vehicles.\n\nLogistics companies like United Parcel Service and FedEx have rolled out their\nown ambitious electric vehicle targets, though many have failed to\nmeaningfully curb the growing emissions from e-commerce deliveries. Amazon,\nmeanwhile, backed away from a vow to make half of all deliveries with zero\ncarbon pollution by 2030, saying that initiative was superseded by broader\nclimate goals. But the company has come farther and faster in the transition\nto EVs than most of its competitors. Understanding the challenges faced by\nAmazon, a company known for going to extreme lengths to meet tight delivery\ndeadlines, can help chart a roadmap for other companies across industries\ntrying to eliminate their own carbon bills.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s scale matters,\u201d said Kellen Schefter, director of transportation at\nthe Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned utilities that\nhas worked to connect Amazon to power companies. \u201cIf Amazon can show that it\nmeets their climate goals while also meeting their package-delivery goals, we\ncan show this all actually works.\u201d\n\nAmazon has a long way to go. The Seattle-based company says its operations\nemitted about 71 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2022, up\nby almost 40% since Jeff Bezos\u2019s 2019 vow that his company would eventually\nstop contributing to the emissions warming the planet. Many of Amazon\u2019s\nemissions come from activities \u2013 air freight, ocean shipping, construction,\nand electronics manufacturing, to name a few \u2013 that lack a clear, carbon-free\nalternative, today or any time soon. The company has not made much progress on\ndecarbonisation of long-haul trucking, whose emissions tend to be concentrated\nin industrial and outlying areas rather than the big cities that served as the\nbackdrop for Amazon\u2019s electric delivery vehicle rollout.\n\nBut Amazon is on track to purchase by next year as much electricity produced\nby solar, wind and other carbon-free sources as it uses to power its\noperations. And in Rivian, which Amazon has backed with a massive investment\nand an order for 100,000 custom-built delivery vans \u2013 13,500 of which have\nbeen delivered to date \u2013 the company has suggested it can eliminate much of\nthe emissions associated with its last-mile delivery business.\n\nTo get there, Amazon had to learn how to pick up the phone and call the power\ncompany. Electric utilities, which to that point primarily dealt with electric\nvehicles through powering the odd home car charging setup, encountered a new\ntype of customer in Amazon. Government electricity use estimates show a\n100,000-square-foot warehouse tucked in an industrial area might be powered by\nabout 50 kilowatts, mainly for lighting and air circulation. Setting up 100\nchargers in the parking lot could require 10 to 20 times as much power.\n\n\u201cWhat was different here was this was a new type of electric use,\u201d said\nSchefter, of the EEI. \u201cThat\u2019s a really big power requirement in a parking\nlot.\u201d That need could be met relatively quickly if the transmission lines in\nthe area have spare capacity. In areas of the grid that don\u2019t, upgrades can\ntake years.\n\nAmazon also learned how to be flexible and how to wait. The company prefers\ncookie-cutter processes that can be run like a production line. That breaks\ndown in the physical world, where Amazon\u2019s hundreds of last-mile delivery\nwarehouses come in different designs or parking lot layouts, subject to\ndiffering local utility protocols.\n\n\u201cIt was a bit of a surprise, how long we would need to prepare for the lead\ntime for infrastructure,\u201d said Chris Atkins, who leads Amazon\u2019s logistics\nsustainability teams.\n\nIn 2020, Amazon met with some of the country\u2019s large utilities, who probed the\ncompany on how much power it would need and where. Representatives of\nCommonwealth Edison, Illinois\u2019s largest power provider, were there. The\nutility, which was struggling to secure some types of new equipment during the\npandemic, opted to repurpose old transformers for Amazon. \u201cWe were doing some\npretty creative stuff internally to make sure that we had what they needed and\nthat we could meet the timelines that they wanted,\u201d said Diana Sharpe, who\ndeals with large customers at the Exelon-owned company.\n\nBy the time Rivian began rolling out large quantities of vans during the\nspring of 2022, ComEd had routed additional power to an Amazon warehouse in\nChicago\u2019s Pullman neighbourhood. Rivian\u2019s CEO stopped by that July for a\nribbon cutting to announce the vans were hitting the road. Today, ComEd powers\nabout 1,100 chargers at four Amazon warehouses in greater Chicago.\n\nAnother lesson Amazon learned is one the company isn\u2019t keen to talk about:\ngoing green can be expensive, at least initially. Based on the type of\nchargers Amazon deploys \u2013 almost entirely mid-tier chargers called Level 2 in\nthe industry \u2013 the hardware likely cost between $50 million and $90 million,\naccording to Bloomberg estimates based on cost estimates supplied by the\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory. Factoring in costs beyond the plugs and\nrelated hardware \u2013 like digging through a parking lot to lay wires or set up\nelectrical panels and cabinets \u2013 could double that sum. Amazon declined to\ncomment on how much it spent on its EV charging push.\n\nIn addition to the expense of the chargers, electric vehicle fleet operators\nare typically on the hook for utility upgrades. When companies request the\nsort of increases to electrical capacity that Amazon has \u2013 the Maple Valley\nwarehouse has 3 megawatts of power for its chargers \u2013 they tend to pay for\nthem, making the utility whole for work done on behalf of a single customer.\nAmazon says it pays upgrade costs as determined by utilities, but that in some\nlocations the upgrades fit within the standard service power companies will\nhandle out of their own pocket.\n\nWhen Amazon made the Rivian order, people who worked on the programme expected\nthat running an electric delivery fleet would eventually be cheaper than the\ncompany\u2019s conventionally fuelled fleet, a hodgepodge of bulk-ordered gasoline\nand diesel vehicles built by the likes of Ford, Mercedes-Benz Group, and\nStellantis. It\u2019s unclear if Amazon is there yet, though Chempananical said\nAmazon was happy with the price tag of the Rivian vehicles. \u201cAll of those\ncosts continue to scale down,\u201d he said. \u201cAs usage grows, there\u2019s more demand,\nthere\u2019s more supply, it gets more efficient and continues to drive to a better\nspot.\u201d\n\nAmazon also had to figure out the logistics of charger sharing. That\u2019s not an\nissue at the Maple Valley warehouse, where 77 electric vans have their pick\nfrom among a fleet of 307 level 2 chargers. But other sites have fewer\nchargers than available vans. Fully charging a van can take several hours, and\nat first, that created some headaches. Amazon initially required the\nsubcontractors who manage van fleets and drivers to keep their own staff\nworking overnight to rotate vans among available chargers. Last fall Amazon\nbrought that work in house, freeing subcontracted workers to drive, rather\nthan babysit chargers. \u201cThey need the drivers, at the end of the day,\u201d\nChempananical said.\n\nAmazon\u2019s contract drivers say they love the vans, which were built for the\ncompany\u2019s sometimes punishing, package-every-90-seconds routes and frequent\nstops. The people who employ the drivers \u2013 Amazon\u2019s Delivery Service Partners\n\u2013 have some complaints. Two West Coast delivery service providers, who asked\nfor anonymity to protect their relationship with Amazon, said body work can\ncost two or three times as much as conventional vehicles, because few body\nshops are authorised to work on Rivian vans. Spare parts can be hard to come\nby.\n\nTrucking presents a bigger challenge, for Amazon and the industry. Automakers\nare much farther along in electrifying cars and light-duty trucks than the\ntractors that haul shipping containers from ports and between warehouses (see\nTesla\u2019s semi truck, which is still in pilot production years after being\nunveiled). Bug-eyed Rivian electric vans are a common sight crisscrossing\nmajor cities like Seattle, Los Angeles, New York and their suburbs. But the\ncommunities that host the massive warehouses further up the supply chain,\noften poorer precincts in places like northeast Pennsylvania or California\u2019s\nInland Empire, have yet to see the same benefits of electrification. In the\ncompany\u2019s post-pandemic cost cutting drives, Amazon has delayed and shelved\nsome trucking-related and other so-called \u201cmiddle mile\u201d sustainability\ninvestments, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAtkins rejected the critique, rattling off moves Amazon has made in the arena:\nbuying trucks that run on compressed natural gas, and investing in makers of\ngreen hydrogen, among other fuel sources. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we get it right\nand not just scale with the wrong partners,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt will get there,\u201d Chempananical said of Amazon\u2019s investments in the \u201cmiddle\nmile.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when and how we get there.\u201d\n\nBack at the Maple Valley warehouse, Justin Shearer, who runs Pacific Delivery\nand Logistics, an Amazon delivery service provider, gives a tour of his corner\nof the facility. Like many of Amazon\u2019s small army of delivery contractors, he\nholds another job. Shearer is a commercial fisherman, and earlier in his\ncareer he sold mining and logging equipment. He doesn\u2019t consider himself an\nenvironmentalist. But the benefits of keeping oil products off the road are\nobvious, he said.\n\n\u201cPutting this infrastructure in is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not been done at\nthis scale, but you\u2019re not going to get better at it unless you start\nsomewhere.\u201d\n\nShare\n\n## Most Read\n\n1\n\n#### 'Energy independent' Uruguay runs on 100% renewables for nine straight\nmonths\n\n2\n\n#### Exclusive interview: Inside South Australia\u2019s world-leading energy\ntransition\n\n3\n\n#### Solar-leader Chile has got 61% of its power from renewables this year\n\n4\n\n#### These cities are building solar plants on trash to save space\n\n5\n\n#### How the Netherlands built a thriving circular economy\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Climate & Energy\n\n## Scotland\u2019s grid becomes even cleaner as gigantic offshore wind farm comes\nonline\n\nThe share of fossil fuels in the nation's electricity mix has rapidly shrunk.\n\n  * Climate & Energy\n\n## Exclusive interview: Inside South Australia\u2019s world-leading energy\ntransition\n\nA pioneer of big batteries and other decarbonisation tech, the state aims to\nget to 100% net renewables within seven years.\n\n  * Climate & Energy\n\n## In numbers: America\u2019s dramatic shift from gas power plants to batteries\n\nIn 2024, gas will account for just 4% of new electrical capacity brought onto\nthe grid.\n\n  * Climate & Energy\n\n## These 12 US states now get most of their electricity from renewables\n\nThese states also dominate the electricity affordability rankings.\n\n  * Transport\n\n## Why the US\u2019 new vehicle pollution standards are a big deal\n\nFor the time being, the US is a laggard when it comes to the adoption of zero-\nemission vehicles.\n\n  * Climate & Energy\n\n## Surge in renewables output slashes power prices in Spain and Portugal\n\nIn March, prices dipped to just \u20ac19.26 per megawatt hour in Portugal as\nrenewables covered 91% of the country's electricity needs.\n\n## Comments\n\n## Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n## Subscribe to our free newsletter\n\n## About\n\nEditorial team\n\nAdvertise with us\n\nContact us\n\n## Privacy & Terms\n\nPrivacy policy\n\nTerms of use\n\nCookies policy\n\n## Follow Us\n\nTwitter Linkedin Youtube Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": true}
