This is the story of how\nsynth\u2019s biggest players narrowly averted a standards war and made sweet music\ntogether\n\nAn early MIDI logo from a 1983 v1.0 spec document (Image credit: MIDI\nAssociation)\n\nThese days it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine a world of hardware and software\nincompatibility in the music tech world.\n\nImagine a DAW or plugin that only runs on a certain make and model of\ncomputer. Or a synth that can only be sequenced via a specific costly box.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly the world of the early '80s, as synths began to escape the\nland of the rock dinosaur and become the non-musician\u2019s weapon of choice.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\n(Image credit: Press/Dave Smith)\n\nDave Smith: synth prophet \u2018Legend\u2019 can be an overused term, but there can be\nno argument when applying this description to synth pioneer Dave Smith. Here\nwe trace his influential career...\n\nIn the \u201860s, Moog had pioneered the creation of the synthesizer, and by the\nlate '70s countless companies were racing to make the tech cheaper and not the\nsize of a wardrobe. The likes of ARP, Obeheim and Sequential Circuits, not to\nmention new, ever more affordable synths from Japan by Roland, Korg and\nYamaha...\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM musicradar\n\nMoog had coined the CV/Gate system for controlling its synths. CV/Gate sent a\nvoltage to the Gate in order to open it (and allow the sound to escape) then\ncut the voltage to close it again.\n\nMeanwhile, different voltages to the CV (control voltage) controlled the\npitch. The higher the voltage, the higher the note. Their keyboard modules\nfired out CV/Gate to play their synths while their built-in sequencers skipped\nthe need to play the thing and let the machine trigger itself.\n\n> Soon other synth makers realised that creating a synth \u2018that played itself\u2019\n> could be more than just a synth nerd\u2019s novelty. Make no mistake. This was\n> going to be big...\n\nSoon other synth makers realised that creating a synth \u2018that played itself\u2019\ncould be more than just a synth nerd\u2019s novelty. Creating a programmable\nsequencer could literally liberate music, freeing for the first time the act\nof composition from the ability to play an instrument. Make no mistake: this\nwas going to be big.\n\n## Get the MusicRadar Newsletter\n\nWant all the hottest music and gear news, reviews, deals, features and more,\ndirect to your inbox?

It used\na simple system where a single volt represented a single octave. So 1V would\nplay C1 and 2V would play C2. With 12 levels of voltage between each whole\nvolt for all the notes in between. Simple.\n\nEarly synths from Roland (System-100) and Sequential Circuits (Prophet-5)\nhijacked Moog\u2019s standards and enjoyed a degree of compatibility as a result.\nHowever, even they required fine tuning and careful attenuation of the\nvoltages to ensure flawless playback.\n\nAnd even synths from the same manufacturer had their own foibles. Moog\u2019s own\nMinimoog, for example, was a notoriously tricky beast to tame when used\nalongside its other gear, with voltages triggering C on one synth but an F on\nthe Mini.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nWhat are CV, Gate and Triggers, and how do they relate to semi-modular\nsynthesis?\n\nMeanwhile, in pursuit of ever lower costs, the likes of Korg and Yamaha\npursued an easier-to-build and more workmanlike system where doubling the\nvoltage doubled the octave. The extra power and more capacious steps resulted\nin less finickity playback, but incompatibility with other systems.\n\nAnd with the world of CV/Gate becoming a nightmare of endless fine-tuning\nbetter suited to electronics engineers than musicians, each manufacturer\nsought to create the best, most reliable, most \u2018tweakproof\u2019 interface and\nclaim victory over its rivals.\n\nRoland went with its DCB (Digital Control Bus) system in 1981. It featured on\nits Juno-60 and later models of the Jupiter-8. This proprietary system aced\nthe competition by offering control of the amplifier and filter in addition to\nsimple note values. And if you wanted to run a drum machine alongside, no\nproblem - Roland had invented an interface for that, too. DIN-Sync used a\n5-pin DIN cable (popular on Japanese hi-fi components) so your MC-4\nMicrocomposer could run alongside your TR-808 drum machine.\n\nOberheim, meanwhile, went with its (super-impressive for the time) 37-pin\nD-Sub connector, creating \u2018The Oberheim System\u2019. This enabled users to connect\ntheir DX or DMX drum machine and up to eight OBX, OBXa or OB-8 synths together\nand sequence the lot from their DSX sequencer (capable of running eight\ndifferent parts and storing 6000 notes).\n\nSequential Circuits, Moog and Korg gazed on enviously, still stuck with\nCV/Gate with their Model 800, Moog 960 and Korg SQ-10 sequencers respectively.\nBut ultimately, they all realised that the writing was on the wall for CV/Gate\nas tricks such as the ability to send patch changes and record knob movements\nalongside notes would soon leave them all for dead.\n\nDespite creating DCB and - at least for now - besting his rivals, Ikutaro\nKakehachi, President of Roland, had even bigger ideas. Conventional wisdom up\nto this point had been that by creating your own standards you could lock your\naudience in; if they loved your synth then they\u2019d HAVE to buy your sequencer\nand drum machine to use with it, too.\n\nIn reality, while there were some musicians willing to part with thousands for\na complete, matching, one-manufacturer \u2018system\u2019, the majority of users simply\nstayed away from everything, fearful of investing in the wrong box as '80s\ninnovations piled on by the month.\n\nKakehachi realised that, if liberated from purchase anxiety, musicians could\nbuy what they wanted (and lots more of it), safe in the knowledge their studio\nwould \u2018just work\u2019 for years to come. So, he reached out to Tom Oberheim (of\nOberheim) to discuss how they might collectively avoid the impending standards\nwar that would see them all innovating their way to oblivion.\n\nRoland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi in 2000 (Image credit: The Asahi\nShimbun/Getty)\n\nWhile Oberheim was very happy with its System, which had found favour with a\nnumber of serious (read: minted) pros, he suggested that Kakehachi get in\ntouch with Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits, as Smith was already working on\na plan.\n\nSmith had imagined a world where all gear used the same data format \u2013 just as\nthey all used the same power cables and jack plugs.\n\nAs the founder and lead designer of 1977\u2019s Prophet 5 - the world\u2019s first\ndigitally programmable polyphonic synth - Smith had created a legend. A\nsuperb-sounding analogue synth with instant, digital storage and recall of\npatches, it naturally sold by the thousand and put his company on the map.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, its successor the Prophet 10 (essentially two Prophet 5\u2019s with a\ndouble keyboard) featured a built-in digital sequencer that recorded the state\nof every key of its two, five-octave keyboards every few microseconds and was\nable to play back performances. Smith made the tech public in the hope that\nother companies would adopt the standard and make sequencers for his Prophet\nsynths, thereby expanding their appeal.\n\nUnfortunately, the system was too data-intensive and failed to take off.\nInstead, Smith had started work on a simpler system that, rather than report\non every key every few microseconds, would simply record just the note on and\noffs.\n\nWith Oberheim\u2019s introduction, Smith finally had an ally in Kakehachi. Now all\nthey had to do was get the entire synth industry to agree with them.\n\nSmith had christened his system the Universal Synthesizer Interface, and at\nthe Gakki Music Fair in October 1981 he, with Ikutaro Kakehachi\u2019s\nintroduction, revealed it to representatives from Yamaha and Korg. It was well\nreceived, but its problems were obvious. Korg noted that the use of jack plugs\nto transmit the required signals would cause noise in the system. Plus, there\nwere no provisions for synchronising sequencers to drum machines or a way for\none machine to start and stop another.\n\nYamaha suggested adding a grounding pin to cure the noise problem, while\nRoland chipped in a way to control tempo and send start and stop messages.\nSoon, after mutually agreeing what USI was lacking, a new standard began to\ntake shape, and while the Japanese contingent began working with the name UMI\n(Universal Musical Interface - pronounced You-Me) Smith countered with Musical\nInstrument Digital Interface (similarly pronouncable as MIDI) to better convey\nits on-trend all-digital nature.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\n(Image credit: MIDI Association)\n\nLooking for some light reading? 350 pages of new MIDI 2.0 specs have just been\npublished\n\nWithin a couple of months, Smith had incorporated his partners\u2019 ideas and\nsuggested a broader discussion with the great and the good in the synth world\nat the annual NAMM show in the States in January 1982. Every synth maker would\nbe in town - Moog, ARP, Yamaha, Roland, Korg, Voyetra, Syntauri, Octave\nPlateau - and Smith found a willing audience, if only to find out what hot new\nmachine Sequential Circuits had up its sleeve next.\n\nAt the meeting Smith outlined his proposal. Instead of all developing and\nbuilding different sequencing standards, all with ever-dwindling sales, why\ndidn\u2019t they all agree on one format and all reap the benefits for years to\ncome?\n\nMIDI would be a digital system with a resolution of 128 values (enough detail\nto cover off any parameter setting) being broadcast over 16 channels (because\nwho had more than 16 synths?) that featured a \u2018running status\u2019 that could\nstart and stop other devices and run everything in sync. And everything could\nbe sent down the grounded, noiseless 5-pin DIN cable already in use by Roland\nas its DIN Sync, and a popular, cheap hi-fi connector.\n\n> The meeting did not go well... many of the big players had already begun\n> work on far more complex systems allowing much finer control\n\nBut the meeting did not go well. While the general consensus was that digital\nwas the way to go, Smith's utopian vision - devised to be as user-friendly and\nas fast-a-fix as possible - was derided for its simplicity. The lack of\nresolution and limited number of channels in Smith\u2019s new interface impressed\nno-one.\n\nMany of the big players had already begun work on far more complex systems\nallowing much finer control. Some manufacturers demanded an unlimited number\nof synths. Some required that audio be digitally passed from one device to\nanother. Some even debated the logic of allowing users to buy another brand\u2019s\nsynths at all. With the debate going precisely nowhere, the audience\ndisbanded.\n\nBut Smith's dialogue with Roland and Yamaha continued. By now most of the hard\nwork had already been done at Sequential\u2019s offices in San Francisco with\ndocuments dispatched to Japan for approval. And the rest of the industry? What\ndid it matter? Smith knew that if the giants of Sequential, Yamaha and Roland\ncreated a standard the rest of the world\u2019s synth makers would come begging not\nto be left out.\n\nThus, through 1982 work continued. Remarkably, the three parties never traded\nhardware, visited each other or performed any kind of tests. Instead the three\ncompany\u2019s engineers agreed on the specs then set about implementing them into\ntheir next synths.\n\n(Image credit: Reverb / Billy Corgan)\n\nFor Sequential Circuits that synth was the Prophet-600. This six-voice (up\nfrom five) sequel to the Prophet-5 cut costs with more digital chips but\nultimately failed to impress with its harsher sound. Nevertheless, just as\nSmith dreamed, it was the first ever synth to sport MIDI ports on its release\nin December 1982.\n\nRoland\u2019s first MIDI synth was the Jupiter-6. While the step from Jupiter-4 to\nJupiter 8 had been a big one, doubling the polyphony and the VCOs (up from one\nper voice to two), the move to Jupiter-6 was a gap-plugging exercise. The\ncostly Jupiter-8 had been undercut by Roland's own Juno-6, 60 and 106, leaving\na hole just big enough for a \u2018baby 8\u2019 with six-note polyphony.\n\nIt's worth noting that, possibly due to a lack of faith in MIDI taking off,\nthe \u20186 skipped the standard\u2019s MIDI Thru port as - keen to keep costs down -\nRoland's engineers couldn\u2019t envisage an edge case where someone would ever own\nmore than two MIDI devices...\n\nMeanwhile, Yamaha's first step into MIDI was the DX7, the groundbreaking, all-\ndigital FM synth that went on to leave its analogue contemporaries in the dust\nthroughout the '80s. Controlling digital innards with analogue CV/Gate would\nhave been a costly interfacing nut to crack, so when the concept of MIDI\narrived as the project neared completion, it was a godsend.\n\nThere were problems, however. A rush to complete the DX7\u2019s design meant the\ndeprioritisation of \u2018non-key features\u2019, and so early DX7s have no way to alter\nthe MIDI channel that the DX7 broadcasts on. It\u2019s MIDI channel 1 or nothing,\nmaking it less than ideal as a controller keyboard.\n\nAnd, with the MIDI spec coming late in the day, it turned out that the chosen\nkeybed wasn\u2019t up to the job of accurately producing MIDI\u2019s 127 different\nlevels of velocity. Typically, DX7s send in the range of 16 to 116. If you\u2019re\nlucky.\n\nAnd while the synth giants were enjoying a new era of collaboration, Smith\ndidn\u2019t want to reveal too many of his plans for the future. Smith was certain\nthat the future lay in multitimbral synths - synths able to play more than one\nsound at once - and thus built a \u2018Mono Mode\u2019 into MIDI for one synth to run\nmultiple sounds.\n\nHowever, rather than flag it up as such, and tip off his rivals to the arrival\nof his upcoming MultiTrak synth, Smith sneaked it into the specs, leading\nYamaha to interpret \u2018Mono Mode\u2019 as a switch to make the entire synth\nmonophonic.\n\nPerhaps most tellingly, MIDI was such a late addition to the DX7 that its\nminimal (and already designed) control panel features zero mention of it. To\nadjust the DX7\u2019s receive channel (which, mercifully IS editable) users had to\naccess it as a hidden feature revealed by pressing Function/Space then Button\n8 (labeled Feedback)...\n\nIt\u2019s therefore a bit of a minor miracle that when MIDI was revealed to the\nworld, on the Sequential Circuits stand at the NAMM show in January 1983\n(precisely one year since Smith\u2019s proposal got the brush off), that the system\nworked at all.\n\nJohn Bowen, the head of sound design at Sequential recounts that he had of\ncourse tested the Prophet-600 plugged into another Prophet-600, but had no\naccess to the yet-to-be-revealed Jupiter-6. And, by making its tight 1982\nshipping date, the Prophet-600 had shipped even before the DX7 was announced.\n\nNevertheless, when Roland\u2019s Kakehachi brought over the new Jupiter-6 (revealed\nfor the first time at the show) and plugged it into Sequential\u2019s Prophet 600\nthe two worked together flawlessly for the gathered press. The fact that you\ncould play on one synth and trigger the sounds of another was remarkable - a\ngenuine first that made music paper news internationally.\n\nBut perhaps Smith and Kakehachi\u2019s greatest creation was in agreeing to make\nMIDI an open standard. There are no fees involved in producing MIDI gear. The\nspec is freely available and the newly formed, non-profit International MIDI\nAssociation set about spreading the word.\n\nWithin a year, as Smith predicted, practically every manufacturer was on\nboard, and even if you don't even own a 5-pin DIN cable, MIDI\u2019s standards and\nprotocol are likely still churning away in your studio behind the scenes,\nempowering creators and ensuring compatibility between every piece of music\nhardware and software.\n\nDaniel Griffiths\n\nDaniel Griffiths is a veteran journalist who has worked on some of the biggest\nentertainment, tech and home brands in the world.
