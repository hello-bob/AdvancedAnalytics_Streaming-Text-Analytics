Barr/GettyImages\n\nWhen Procter & Gamble began market-testing a fat-free version of their popular\nPringles snack in late 1996, Pringles brand manager Casey Keller called their\nattempt to revolutionize the food industry with the calorie-conscious chips\n\u201cthe number-one unmet consumer need\u201d of the moment.\n\nThe chip, which had zero grams of fat and only half the calories of\nconventional Pringles, was made possible by Procter & Gamble\u2019s olestra, a\nsynthetic fat molecule marketed under the brand name Olean. Because it was too\nlarge to be absorbed by the intestine, it passed through the digestive tract\u2014a\nlittle too quickly, as it turned out.\n\nOlestra, which was found in Pringles and later in Frito-Lay products like\nRuffles and Doritos, was burdened by a nagging problem. The miraculous fat\nmolecule gave a percentage of consumers stomach cramps, loose bowel movements,\nand diarrhea. It also led to the coining of phrases not normally associated\nwith snack foods, like \u201cfecal urgency\u201d and \u201canal leakage.\u201d\n\n## A 25-Year-Long Journey\n\nOlestra\u2019s origins date back to 1968, when Procter and Gamble researchers were\ninvestigating fats that premature infants might be able to tolerate more\neasily. Over time, they found that attaching an increased number of fatty\nacids to the sorbitol molecule rendered the fats unable to pass through the\nmucus membrane of the intestine and were therefore totally indigestible.\n\nBecause sorbitol was expensive, researchers substituted sucrose and combined\nit with triglycerides. With this \u201cfake\u201d fat derived from cottonseed and\nsoybean oils, they seemed to have discovered the holy grail of satiety: a\ngreasy additive that provided flavor with zero calories, zero fat, and zero\ncholesterol.\n\nThe development process took 15 years. It took another 10 years for the Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) to approve olestra for the so-called savory food\ncategory: potato chips, pretzels, and other salty snacks\u2014but there were a few\nwrinkles. For one, olestra appeared to affect how the body absorbed vitamins\nA, E, D, and K. It also impacted dietary carotenoids, which may help the body\nward off cancer and heart disease. The FDA insisted snacks made with olestra\nbe supplemented with vitamins to offset any imbalance that ingestion might\ncause. The agency also mandated a package warning about abdominal cramping and\nloose stools, an observed side effect of olestra consumption.\n\nProcter & Gamble made a minor stir about the label\u2014after all, it can be\ndifficult to market food with a warning that it might give you explosive\ndiarrhea\u2014but was otherwise pleased. After 25 years and an estimated $200\nmillion in development costs, olestra was finally ready for store shelves.\n\nProcter & Gamble started with Pringles, test marketing a fat-free version of\nthe baked chips in Ohio in 1996. As the company was prepared to sell the\ningredient to other snack companies, Frito-Lay began experimenting with it in\nLay\u2019s, Ruffles, Tostitos, and Doritos that same year. Early word was\nencouraging, and all products went on to a national rollout in 1998.\n\n## Something\u2019s Stirring\n\nCare for some chips with a side of gastrointestinal distress? / James\nLeynse/GettyImages\n\nFor a public weaned on the idea that dietary fats were bad, olestra caused a\nhuge stir. Frito-Lay, which marketed the chips under the brand name Wow!,\npushed the idea that the chips had just 75 calories per serving, half the\ncalories of the regular recipe, and no fat instead of the 10 grams typical of\nchips. That the snacks could conceivably create bathroom emergencies was\nrelegated to late-night talk show jokes. Procter & Gamble largely dismissed\nthe claims, comparing the potential gastrointestinal distress of olestra to\neating beans or broccoli.\n\nBut broccoli had never been demonstrated to cause an orange-yellow liquid to\nseep out of one\u2019s rear end. The FDA and Procter & Gamble were inundated with\n16,700 complaints from consumers that products made with olestra were giving\nthem problems from flatulence to stained underwear. A meeting of Washington\u2019s\nCenter for Science in the Public Interest, which had criticized Procter &\nGamble for hyping olestra, featured video testimony of people afflicted by the\nmolecule. One claimed the cramps of snacking were comparable to the early\nstages of labor.\n\nOther experiences with olestra were said to include the passing of orange-\nyellow \u201cglobules\u201d of oil as well as difficulty wiping. The Center even shared\na study commissioned by Frito-Lay which was meant to be confidential that\ndemonstrated \u201canal oil leakage\u201d was experienced by 3 to 9 percent of study\nsubjects. \u201cUnderwear spotting\u201d was present in 5 percent. A variety of\ngastrointestinal issues were observed in 7 percent.\n\nThe potential for leakage aside, olestra overcame much of its bad publicity.\nFrito-Lay sold $347 million in Wow! chips in 1998 alone. The fat-free Pringles\nwere good for $100 million that same year. It appeared that consumers were\nsufficiently enticed by a lower-calorie option that they wanted to see how\nolestra would affect them first-hand.\n\n## High Hopes and Loose Stool\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know what percentage of consumers experienced adverse\neffects. But it\u2019s not hard to see why it could have proven so problematic.\nUnlike the practical serving sizes eaten in studies, consumers tend to binge\non chips, devouring a bag at a time or in conjunction with other food. While\nProcter & Gamble admonished that chips were snacks, it was hard to dissuade\npeople from seeing a bag of chips with half the calories and eating the entire\nthing. Even Procter & Gamble admitted that gorging could give you loose stools\nand cramping.\n\nProcter & Gamble had high hopes for olestra, projecting $1 billion in sales in\n2000 and eventually an entire line of olestra-infused goods like salad\ndressings and desserts. But two years after its explosively profitable debut,\nsales were just half that, and only a few other companies like Utz and Herr\u2019s\nused olestra in their products. Even after the FDA removed the label warning\nrequirement in 2003, consumers weren\u2019t finding runny stool all that\nappetizing.\n\nFrito-Lay renamed their Wow! chips to Ruffles Light and Doritos Light in 2004.\nIn 2009, Procter & Gamble made olestra an additive in eco-friendly paints and\nlubricants. Some foods are still made with olestra, though it\u2019s no longer the\nindustry disruptor the company had hoped for.\n\nSpeaking of its potential in 1998, Procter & Gamble\u2019s then-chairman and chief\nexecutive John E. Pepper, Jr. believed that olestra could soon take a place of\nprominence among other Procter & Gamble products, like Pampers diapers. He did\nnot mention whether he expected sales of the former would help sales of the\nlatter.\n\nA version of this story originally ran in 2020; it has been updated for 2023.\n\n### Related Tags\n\nFOODTHE BODYSCIENCENEWSVIDEORETRODISEASEPOOPTBT\n\nHome/FOOD\n\nAround the Web\n\nRecommended by\n\nABOUT\n\nCONTACT US\n\nNEWSLETTERS\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nCOOKIE POLICY\n\nTERMS OF SERVICE\n\nACCESSIBILITY STATEMENT\n\nSITEMAP\n\nA-Z Index\n\n\u00a9 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved\n\n", "frontpage": false}
