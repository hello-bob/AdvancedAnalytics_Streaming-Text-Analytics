While this problem is well understood, it\u2019s becoming\nmore difficult to contain in leading-edge designs.\n\nOf particular concern is electromigration, which is becoming more troublesome\nin advanced packages with multiple chiplets, where various bonding and\ninterconnect schemes create abrupt changes in materials and geometries. For\nexample, electrons may travel from a copper trace to a solder bump of SAC\n(tin-silver-copper), then to an underbump metal based on nickel, and finally\nto an interposer copper pad. That, in turn, can cause atoms to shift,\nresulting in failures in solder joints or in copper redistribution layers in\nhigh-density fan-out packages.\n\n\u201cFrom an electromigration perspective, advanced packaging causes increased\npackaging density, reduced packaging size, and the dimensions of interconnects\nto shrink, so the current density is now in close proximity to the maximum\ncurrent density limit per EM design rules,\u201d said Dermott Lynch, director of\ntechnical product management in Synopsys\u2018 EDA Group.\n\nAny additional stresses the package may be subjected to during assembly and\nuse, whether mechanical or thermal, also can help induce or accelerate\nelectromigration. \u201cElectromigration, in general, gets worse due to temperature\nand stress, both of which advanced packaging increases,\u201d said Lynch.\n\u201cElectromigration is also cumulative, so essentially it integrates all the\ntemperature highs and stress over the lifetime until an interconnect breaks\ndown or shorts. Larger processing temperature and operation temperature will\nmake it worse, but it also depends on time under that temperature.\u201d\n\nIn fact, managing thermal pathways is perhaps the greatest challenge\nassociated the movement toward the ultimate package, a 3D-IC.\n\u201cElectromigration is very temperature-sensitive,\u201d said Marc Swinnen, director\nof product marketing in Ansys\u2019 Semiconductor Division. \u201cDepending on your\nthermal map, your power integrity will have to adapt to the local temperature\nprofile that you have. So when you look at a chip, you can calculate how much\npower the chip is putting out, but you cannot tell how hot the chip will get\nbecause \u2018it depends.\u2019 Is it sitting on a cold plate or sitting in the sun in\nthe Sahara? System concerns come in, and multi-physics modeling is important\nto understanding these co-dependent effects.\u201d\n\nThermal engineering also means moving heat away from the most vulnerable\npoints of failure, such as solder bumps. \u201cEffective thermal management is\nessential for bump reliability,\u201d said Curtis Zwenger, vice president of\nengineering and technical marketing at Amkor. \u201cEngineers are incorporating\nthermal enhancement techniques, such as the use of thermal interface materials\nand advanced heat dissipation solutions, to ensure that bumps are not\nsubjected to excessive temperature-related stresses.\u201d\n\nZwenger noted that engineers are looking into new materials, while optimizing\nthe use of existing materials to minimize the possibility of electromigration.\n\u201cSemiconductor packaging engineers are implementing a range of measures to\nenhance bump reliability and maximize bump yield. These strategies include new\nmaterials for solder bumps and underbump metallization, optimizing bump size,\npitch and shape for reliability, advanced process control methods to control\nvariability and maximize yield, and simulating and modeling reliability.\u201d\n\nWhat is electromigration? Electromigration is the mass transport of metal\natoms caused by the electron wind from current flowing through a conductor,\ntypically copper. When current density is high enough, metal will diffuse in\nthe direction of current flow, creating tiny hillocks downstream and leaving\nbehind vacancies or voids. With enough electromigration, failures occur due to\nsevere line thinning, causing opens, or due to hillocks that bridge adjacent\nlines, causing short circuits.\n\nElectromigration is a diffusion-controlled mechanism that can take three forms\n\u2014 bulk, grain boundary, or surface diffusion, depending on the metal. Aluminum\nmigrates by grain boundary diffusion whereas copper migrates on the surface or\nat its grain boundaries.\n\nFor most of the semiconductor industry\u2019s history, electromigration was\nprimarily an on-chip concern, but on-chip EM is largely under control by\nreliability engineers. But with the scaling and rapid developments in advanced\npackaging \u2014 implementing TSVs, fan-out packaging with redistribution layers,\nand copper pillar bumps \u2014 electromigration has emerged as a major threat at\nthe package level. Current flowing through the solder bump causes joule\nheating, and heat from other parts of the package may also dissipate through\nthe solder bumps. EM can become an issue for solder joint connections between\nchip and interposer, or chip and PCB, as well as in RDLs. Solder joint\nfailures typically manifest as voids or cracks.\n\nFig. 1: Electromigration can create short circuits between two interconnects\nthrough the development of hillocks, or an open circuit through the creation\nof voids in interconnect. Source: Ansys\n\nElectromigration progresses more quickly at higher temperatures, at higher\ncurrents, under greater mechanical stress and in the presence of defects or\nimpurities in the metal. Black\u2019s equation describes an interconnect\u2019s mean\ntime-to-failure with respect to its temperature, current density and the\nactivation energy needed to dislodge a metal atom as:\n\nJ is the current density, k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, T is temperature, Ea is\nthe activation energy, and N is a scaling factor that depends on the metal\u2019s\nproperties. Black\u2019s equation is useful because it easily shows how shorter,\nwider interconnects will tend to have longer MTTF. In addition,\nelectromigration time-to-failure very strongly depends on the interconnect\u2019s\ntemperature. That temperature is primarily the result of the chip\u2019s\nenvironmental temperature, self-heating of the conductor caused by current\nflow, the heat from neighboring interconnects or transistors, and the thermal\nconductivity of the surrounding material.\n\nIt is also important to note that electromigration is a runaway process. As\ncurrent density and/or temperature increases, electromigration increases,\nwhich raises current density, causing more metal to migrate in a destructive\nfeedback loop.\n\nEM failure modes and allowable current density In the case of copper\nredistribution layers in polyimide material, as current flows through the RDL,\nheat accumulates in the conductor due to Joule heating generation, which can\ndegrade performance. As the required current density and Joule heating\ntemperature is increasing in the fine-line Cu RDL structures (<5nm lines and\nspaces), self-heating is considered a key factor in the reliability of high-\ndensity fan out packages.\n\nJiHye Kwon, senior manager of R&D at Amkor, recently used EM testing and\nBlack\u2019s equation to determine the electromigration failure mechanisms for a\ngiven RDL stack and high-density fan-out package with 2\u03bcm or 10\u03bcm wide RDL\nlayers, 1,000\u03bcm long. [1]\n\nHigh density fan-out is an emerging technology, as it features more aggressive\nscaling than wafer level fan-out packages. The three layers of copper RDL (3\u03bcm\nthick with Ta/Cu seed) were fabricated followed by polyimide fill, copper\npillar deposition, die attach, and overmold. Kwon\u2019s team tested both 2 and\n10\u03bcm RDL at different current densities and temperatures until resistance\nincreased by 100% (EM failure), but the maximum allowed current density\ncorresponded with a 20% resistance increase. The failure modes occurred in two\nstages, first by void nucleation and growth and second with copper reduction\nand oxidation. The study yielded Ea and current density exponent values that\ncan be useful in future designs of RDLs.\n\nMeanwhile, a team of researchers from ASE recently demonstrated how\nsusceptibility to electromigration is determined on copper pillar\ninterconnects in flip chip quad flat no-lead (FCQFN) for high-power automotive\napplications. The multi-layered copper pillar bumps with a Cu/Ni/Sn1.8Ag\nconfiguration were bonded to a silver-plated copper leadframe and tested under\nextreme EM conditions of 10 kA/cm^2 current density and temperatures of 150\u00b0C,\n160\u00b0C and 180\u00b0C, while taking in-situ resistance measurements. [2] The EM\nfailures corresponded with rapid rises in electrical resistance that\ncorresponded with the formation of intermetallic compounds and voids at the\nCu/solder interfaces. The team built an EM prediction model of interconnects\nbased on a Black-type EM equation, following the JEDEC standard with five test\nconditions.\n\nAfter the statistic calculation from the lifetime of samples, the ASE team\ndetermined activation energy of Cu pillar interconnects in the FCQFN package\n(1.12 \u00b1 0.03 eV). The maximum current of the Cu pillar interconnects allowable\nlasting 10 years at a 105\u00b0C operating temperature at a 0.1% failure rate was\nlarger than 2A for the FCQFN Cu pillar structure. \u201cThe FCQFN package has great\npotential in terms of its excellent anti-EM performance for future high-power\napplications,\u201d the article said.\n\nDesigning/manufacturing for EM resiliency Building electromigration resilience\ninto advanced devices begins with using only EM-compliant linewidths in\ncircuit designs based on the current density and heat profile that the\ninterconnects will experience during operation over the lifetime of the\ndevice. Electromigration mitigation also requires process and materials\nengineering to ensure durability, for instance, of copper pillar bumps under\nBGA packages. It also calls for an optimized assembly process window and tight\nprocess control to prevent tiny violations of design rules that can later\nprecipitate as EM failures.\n\nAs the industry makes its way toward true 3D packages, and eventually 3D-ICs,\nit seems clear that modeling and simulation will play an increasing role in\ndetermining many of the guard rails for manufacturing and assembly before\nmanufacturing and assembly even begins. \u201cReliability modeling and simulation\ntools are being used to better understand the reliability of bump structures.\nThis proactive approach helps in identifying potential issues before they\narise, enabling engineers to implement preventive measures,\u201d said Zwenger.\n\nModeling and simulation at the system level also will be essential to\nunderstanding the complex interplay between reliability mechanisms with\nthermal and mechanical stress in multi-chiplet systems during operation.\n\n\u201cElectromigration for stacked die is challenging,\u201d said Synopsys\u2019 Lynch.\n\u201cLocalized, die-to-die workloads cause repetitive current flow in specific\nareas. This generates local heat, increasing EM resulting in wire degradation,\nwhile producing even more heat. Reducing the thermal issue becomes critical to\nensuring EM reliability.\u201d\n\nAs stated previously, solder bumps can become a site for EM reliability\nfailure. \u201cEngineers fine-tune bump design in terms of bump size, pitch, and\nshape to ensure uniformity and reliability across the entire package. This\nincludes the adoption of innovative Cu bump structures for improved mechanical\nand electrical properties,\u201d said Amkor\u2019s Zwenger.\n\nIn flip-chip BGA and other flip-chip applications, underfill materials \u2014\ntypically thermoset epoxies \u2014 are used to reduce the thermal stresses on\nsolder bumps. \u201cUnderfill materials play a critical role in providing\nmechanical support and thermal stability to the bumps,\u201d Zwenger said.\n\u201cEngineers are investing in the development of advanced underfill formulations\nwith enhanced properties, such as improved adhesion, thermal conductivity, and\nstress relief.\u201d\n\nConclusion Because of its dependence on temperature, electromigration is a\nfailure mechanism to watch and plan for as devices continue to scale and\nsystems integrators continue to cram more and more chiplets of various\nfunctions into advanced packages.\n\n\u201cIn advanced technologies, the current density is now in close proximity to\nthe maximum density,\u201d said Synopsys\u2019 Lynch. \u201cAnything that causes an increase\nin temperature poses a threat. Designers of multi-die systems need to\nunderstand the impact of temperature and design systems to remove the heat.\u201d\n\nReferences\n\n  1.
