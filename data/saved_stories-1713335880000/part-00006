Their ways of thinking become yours. You may\nthink this is not happening, but if, for example, you take a role at a fast\nfood restaurant, eventually you may have nightmares of overcooked fries. You\nmay claim not to really care about this job, but it is hammered into you every\nshift not to make certain mistakes. Your mind is not equipped to ignore this.\nFar below your conscious thoughts; you actually want the customer to leave\nwith a smile. Not because you care. Whether you do or not is irrelevant. This\nhappens because you\u2019ve been reinforced to want a certain outcome with various\nfinancial, social, emotional and para-social incentives. Between work, your\nfamily and your friends, you often switch from \u2018individual mode\u2019 to \u2018hive\nmember mode\u2019. You are not yourself anymore.\n\nThis is 100% natural and necessary. Humans would not have been able to develop\nand grow the societies and civilizations they have without the powers of\nempathy, sympathy and group-think. It allows us to construct cohesive\ncollectives in a meaningful way; making sure that an individual within the\nsystem accepts what is important to the system itself. This is what manifests\nitself in you when you build and develop relationships to the various groups\nin your life.\n\nSo, whats the problem? Maybe nothing; maybe something. The purpose of this\nshort post is to remind you to be conscious that this is happening. Yes, you\nare part of the collective; but you are still an individual. You should not\nblindly accept what is important to the group. It is your responsibility, to\nyourself and even to the group, to assess priorities, goals and beliefs. You\nmay have become reliant on external sources of priorities and meaning:\npolitical affiliation, your workplace, activism, your religion, your lack of\nreligion (this is a \u2018negative group\u2019; a group defined as opposition to another\ngroup or groups), or a specific subculture.\n\nIn the end, these may be right for you, but be sure you are not being fooled.\nIf you tether yourself to a group and are one day ousted or leave; your\nfoundations will be shaken. Don\u2019t end up in a situation where you miss out on\na fulfilling life on your own terms. Your questioning might even be the\ninception of change in the greater group. Think twice before clicking\ndownload; it may save you and those around you.\n\n### Subscribe to DG @ DG\n\nBy David Gorski \u00b7 Launched a month ago\n\nDocumenting my thoughts, feelings and attempts.
