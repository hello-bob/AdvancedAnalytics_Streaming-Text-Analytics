(Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group)\n\nBy Molly Gibbs | mgibbs@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\n\nPUBLISHED: April 19, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. | UPDATED: April 22, 2024 at 2:53 a.m.\n\nA correction to an earlier version of this article has been appended to the\nend of the article.\n\nHrihaan Bhutani is already thinking about college. The Dublin Unified freshman\nis taking four Advanced Placement classes next year and has crammed his\nschedule with extracurricular activities to better his chances of getting into\nan Ivy League school.\n\nBut a change at the district designed to get students less focused on grades\nhas done the opposite. Suddenly, in some classes, A\u2019s are almost unachievable,\nunless you score 100%. And F\u2019s don\u2019t exist. For high-achieving students like\nBhutani, who attends Emerald High School, a new school on the Dublin High\ncampus, the pressure to be perfect is even more of a burden.\n\n\u201cI feel more stressed ... now with this new system,\u201d said Bhutani, who is\nespecially sweating his biology class, one of dozens trying a variety of new\ngrading scales under a two-year experiment. \u201cEven if you\u2019re at a 99, you would\nget moved down to an 85,\u201d he explained, which translates to a world-ending B.\n\nEmerald High School freshmen Hrihaan Bhutani, right, in a Dublin High School\ncampus classroom on Thursday, April 11, 20124, in Dublin, Calif. (Aric\nCrabb/Bay Area News Group)\n\nDublin Unified\u2019s new grading policy will go into effect for all 6th through\n12th grade classes next year and is part of a national shift toward \u201cequity\ngrading\u201d \u2013 a controversial concept that moves away from traditional grading to\nbetter measure how well students understand what they are being taught.\n\nThe goal is to lower the impact of things that \u201cfluff\u201d grades \u2013 extra credit,\nclass participation and homework \u2013 while also making it easier for lower-\nperforming students to bounce back from failing.\n\nSeveral school districts in the Bay Area have explored similar ideas,\nincluding Oakland Unified, Pleasanton Unified, Santa Clara Unified and most\nrecently Palo Alto Unified. But how districts implement the change differs,\nwith some choosing to eliminate D\u2019s and F\u2019s, while others move away from zero\ngrades or eliminate late penalties.\n\nDublin High School students head to their second period class on campus in\nDublin, Calif., on Wednesday, March 15, 2023. (Dai Sugano/Bay Area News Group)\n\nEquitable grading was first coined by Joe Feldman in his 2018 book, \u201cGrading\nfor Equity,\u201d which has become the instruction manual for more than 200 schools\nacross the country. Feldman said he\u2019s partnered with 25 districts and schools\nin California to guide them as they make the transition.\n\nLiliana Castrellon, an assistant professor in the department of education at\nSan Jose State University whose research focuses on equity in education, said\nequitable grading practices became more common in school districts after the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cIf anything, what we learned during the pandemic is that our traditional\neducation system is not working for everyone,\u201d Castrellon said. \u201cSo there\u2019s\nbeen a lot of conversations around ... how do we reimagine and re-envision\npractices that are more equitable and that are going to benefit all students?\u201d\n\nA task force at Dublin Unified first discussed revising grading policies in\n2021. The following year 28 teachers began testing new ways to measure\nstudents\u2019 proficiency.\n\nDublin Unified\u2019s superintendent Chris Funk explained at a board meeting last\nyear that the district\u2019s grading system wasn\u2019t consistent across all schools,\nwhich caused issues in the classroom.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the grading system that\u2019s been around is an\ninequitable practice. Much of the grading that is involved does not grade\nanyone\u2019s mastery of the subject content,\u201d he said at the meeting. \u201cZeros in a\ngrading system do not accurately reflect a student\u2019s proficiency. Awarding\nzeros as discipline is not an appropriate consequence as they can be almost\nimpossible to recover from.\u201d\n\nA student walks down the hall at Dublin High School in Dublin, Calif., on\nTuesday, March 7, 2023. (Shae Hammond/Bay Area News Group)\n\nBut the incremental changes led to widespread pushback among parents, students\nand teachers \u2013 inciting a Change.org petition to stop the practice and a\nWhatsApp group with more than 400 parents against the policy shift.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Education |\n\nFremont High School celebrates its centennial\n\n  * Education |\n\nNonprofit works with Los Gatos school district to offer plant-based meals\n\n  * Education |\n\nSouth Bay students get a taste of AI at The Tech Interactive\n\n  * Education |\n\nFallout from alleged harassment and a desk on a roof: Antioch school board\npresident demands superintendent\u2019s resignation\n\n  * Education |\n\nNot your parents\u2019 prom: One school\u2019s transforming prom culture\n\nNext year, the district will restrict all letter grades to a 10% range and\nremove the practice of awarding zero points for assignments as long as they\nwere \u201creasonably attempted.\u201d The new policy will also remove extra credit and\nbonus points that elevated grades, and provide students with multiple chances\nto make up missed or failed assignments and minimize homework\u2019s impact on a\nstudent\u2019s grade.\n\nSome parents and teachers said they worry the changes will encourage students\nto slack off and leave them unprepared for college.\n\n\u201cI think the dumbing down of curriculum will lead to our kids failing in\ncollege because they\u2019re not going to be prepared on the same level as kids\nfrom other districts and other states,\u201d said Dublin parent Olena Stadnyuk.\n\nSkeptics say school districts are implementing no-zero policies and removing\nfailing letter grades to boost graduation rates as they struggle to recover\nfrom learning loss caused by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis will up kids graduating, it will up their numbers,\u201d said Laurie Sargent,\nan eighth grade English teacher at Cottonwood Creek, a TK-8th grade school in\nDublin. \u201cThey\u2019ll have fewer kids failing and then that looks good. It\u2019s\nstrategic.\u201d\n\nSome schools have shifted their grading policies in response to the University\nof California and California State University \u201cA to G\u201d requirements, which\nmandate students receive a C or better in 15 of their high school courses to\nqualify for admission.\n\n\u201cAlmost all kids in California graduate high school but only about half who\ngraduate are eligible to apply to UC or CSU schools,\u201d said Alix Gallagher,\ndirector of strategic partnerships for Policy Analysis for California\nEducation. \u201cIn California, grades are the sole determinant ... Grades are a\ngatekeeper for kids.\u201d\n\nDela Antoinette, a parent of a sophomore at Dublin High, said she worries that\nequity grading will harm the high-achieving students who are performing well\nunder the current system.\n\n\u201cInstead of pushing this agenda, let\u2019s focus on lifting this particular group\nup and get them up to the standard of other students that are excelling,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cNot lower the standards, not change the entire system for everyone.\u201d\n\nEmerald High School freshmen Bhuvan Krishnamohan, left, and Hrihaan Bhutani,\nright, in a Dublin High School campus classroom on Thursday, April 11, 20124,\nin Dublin, Calif. (Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group)\n\nBhutani and his biology classmate Bhuvan Krishnamohan, who are just completing\ntheir first year of high school, are already thinking about transferring to a\nschool that doesn\u2019t use equitable grading.\n\n\u201cI think the system favors the people that are not doing so well and they want\nto do well, rather than the people that are doing really well and want to\ncontinue that,\u201d Krishnamohan said.\n\nSargent, the English teacher, said Dublin Unified\u2019s new grading system doesn\u2019t\nset students up for success in the real world.\n\n\u201cWe want to make our students college and career ready,\u201d Sargent said.\n\u201cNowhere in college do you get 50% for doing nothing. Nowhere in the world of\nwork do you get 50% for doing nothing...If I don\u2019t show up to work, they don\u2019t\npay me 50% of my salary even if I made a reasonable attempt to get there.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version on this story misidentified the school where two Dublin\nUnified students are enrolled. Hrihaan Bhutani and Bhuvan Krishnamohan attend\nEmerald High School, located on the Dublin High School campus.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share a free article with a friend\n\n###### GIFT THIS ARTICLE\n\n###### What is article sharing?\n\nSubscribers are entitled to 10 gift sharing articles each month.
