In fact, I joined five of our favorite maintainers for a discussion on\nexactly that topic last Friday that is worth a watch.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to channel my inner optimist and take a slightly different\nposition on xz today:\n\nxz shows the open source model working.\n\nThere\u2019s a well-worn saying in open source that, \u201cgiven enough eyeballs, all\nbugs are shallow.\u201d It\u2019s a bit of a riff on a quote from Supreme Court Justice\nLouis Brandeis in 1913 that \u201csunlight is the best disinfectant\u201d as a way to\nenshrine the importance of transparency. And open source is transparent in\nthat people can actually look at changes, reason about them, and provide\nimprovements or alternatives.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how things played out with xz. Despite an incredible amount\nof obfuscation and effort to make this exploit difficult to find, a member of\nthe open source community stumbled upon it because the code was freely\navailable for inspection, triaged the issue, and disclosed it in a responsible\nway.\n\nIf someone (or multiple someones) had gone to a similar level of effort to get\na job working for a commercial software company and then made changes in that\ncompany\u2019s proprietary codebase, the likelihood that it would have been noticed\nbefore it was broadly in the wild causing damage would be far, far lower. This\nisn\u2019t to say that commercial software doesn\u2019t have people reviewing changes\nand looking at them but there are just fewer ways that someone could notice or\nreally dig in.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt thrown around in the\ncoming months about open source post xz, but that\u2019s the thing I keep coming\nback to. Because this is open source, and the code was available, this exploit\nwas uncovered before it was widely deployed. And because this is open source,\nwe can have an ongoing and detailed discussion about how to prevent future\nexploits because all of the social interactions, all of the technical details,\nall of the code, is right there where everyone can see it and learn from it\u2014in\nthe open.\n\nThat\u2019s an amazing display of the power of open source.\n\nThat said, we should still invest in reducing the likelihood of such efforts\nsucceeding in the future, whether from copycats or more sophisticated actors.\nAnd for that, things like thinking more closely about binaries in source\nrepos, moving away from having auto-generated files distributed and used vs\nregenerated at build time, and investing in paying maintainers to help ensure\nthey can get the support they need are still important! Also thinking about\nways to help improve distributed trust in an ever growing ecosystem of people\nwanting to contribute to open source. These are all conversations worth having\nas we look back at xz.\n\nBut don\u2019t see xz as a failure of open source. Because in many ways it also\nshows us what is great about open source.\n\n#### Maintainers, Vulnerabilities, xz utils backdoor\n\n## You might also like:\n\n#### Maintainers, Vulnerabilities, xz utils backdoor\n\n## New report from Atlantic Council finds paying maintainers can positively\nimpact open source security\n\n#### Maintainers, Vulnerabilities, xz utils backdoor\n\n## Paying maintainers: the HOWTO\n\n##### Address\n\n50 Milk St, 16th Floor, Boston, MA 02109 (339) 210-5630 ext. 106\n\n#### Tidelift\n\n  * About\n  * Log in\n  * Blog\n  * Press\n  * Contact\n  * Jobs\n\n  * #### Product\n\n  * Solutions\n  * Pricing\n  * Free demo\n  * Documentation\n  * Scope of support\n\n  * #### Resources\n\n  * Blog\n  * Guides\n  * Videos\n  * Podcasts\n  * Webinars\n  * News\n  * Surveys\n  * Partnerships\n\n  * #### For Maintainers\n\n  * Packages with income\n  * Maintainer tasks\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Tidelift, Inc.\n\nPrivacy policy\n\nTerms of service\n\nSystem status\n\n", "frontpage": false}
