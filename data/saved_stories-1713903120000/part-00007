Agulhas II. Records include water surface elevation across a range of\nwave conditions spanning from early stages of wave growth to full development.\nWe give experimental evidence of rogue seas, i.e., sea states characterized by\nheavy tails of the probability density function well beyond the expectation\nbased on bound mode theory. These conditions emerge during wave growth, where\nstrong wind forcing and high nonlinearity drive wave dynamics. Quasiresonance\nwave-wave interactions, which are known to sustain the generation of large\namplitude rogue waves, capture this behavior. Wave statistics return to\nnormality as the wind forcing ceases and waves switch to a full developed\ncondition.\n\n  * Received 4 October 2023\n  * Revised 16 January 2024\n  * Accepted 29 February 2024\n\nDOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.154101\n\n\u00a9 2024 American Physical Society\n\n#### Physics Subject Headings (PhySH)\n\n  1.
