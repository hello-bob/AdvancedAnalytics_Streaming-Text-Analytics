Amid a\nhistorically hot labor market, the United Auto Workers and Hollywood writers\u2019\nand actors\u2019 guilds launched high-profile strikes that made front-page news and\nresulted in significant victories. Strikes, organizing efforts, and public\nsupport for unions reached heights not seen since the 1960s. Two in three\nAmericans support unions, and 59 percent say they would be in favor of\nunionizing their own workplace. And Joe Biden supports organized labor more\nvocally than any other president in recent memory. You could look at all this\nand say that the U.S. labor movement is stronger than it has been in decades.\n\nBut you could just as easily say that worker power in America is as low as it\nhas been in nearly a century. Despite all the headlines and good feeling, a\nmere 10 percent of American workers belong to unions. In the private sector,\nthe share is just 6 percent. After years of intense media attention and dogged\norganizing efforts, workers at Amazon, Starbucks, and Trader Joe\u2019s still don\u2019t\nhave a contract, or even the start of meaningful negotiations to get one.\nUnion membership is associated with higher earnings, better benefits, stable\nhours, protection from arbitrary discipline, and more\u2014but most Americans\nhaven\u2019t had the chance to experience these advantages firsthand. In 2023,\naccording to an estimate by the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think\ntank, 60 million working people in this country wanted a union but couldn\u2019t\nget one.\n\nHow can this be? The answer, as I learned during my 25 years working for the\nAFL-CIO, the nation\u2019s largest federation of unions, is that the story of\norganized labor in America is really two stories. On the one hand, established\nunions\u2014especially those that emerged in the 1930s, when labor protections were\nat their most robust and expansive\u2014are thriving. On the other hand, workers\nwho want to unionize for the first time can\u2019t get their efforts off the\nground.\n\nThis is because the legal and policy shifts that hobbled the American labor\nmovement were not primarily aimed at dismantling existing unions, at least not\nright away. Rather, they were designed to make it difficult to form new ones.\nThose efforts worked. In 1954, 16 million working people belonged to a union,\nand they accounted for about a third of the workforce. Today, nearly as many\npeople are in unions\u2014about 14 million\u2014but they make up only 10 percent of the\nworkforce. In other words, the numerator of unionized workers has held steady\neven as the denominator of overall jobs in the economy has grown dramatically.\nAnd all the support from the public and even the president can\u2019t do much to\nchange that. As hopeful as today\u2019s moment might seem for workers, those hopes\nwill not be realized without reversing the changes that laid unions low in the\nfirst place.\n\nA century ago, an even smaller portion of the workforce belonged to a union\nthan does today, and it showed. Then, as now, income inequality had reached\nstaggering heights. Industrial workplaces of the 1920s were police states,\nwith corporate spy agencies, private armies, and company stores.\n\nThe tide shifted in workers\u2019 favor during the Great Depression. In 1935,\nresponding to years of rising labor militancy, Congress passed the Wagner Act,\nan integral part of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal agenda. The law gave\nworking people robust rights to form and join labor unions and to take\ncollective action, such as strikes. It created the National Labor Relations\nBoard, tasked with ensuring that employers didn\u2019t violate these rights. And it\ndeclared that protecting \u201cthe free flow of commerce\u201d also meant protecting the\n\u201cfull freedom\u201d of working people to organize. Overall union membership rose\nfrom just 11 percent of the workforce in 1934 to 34 percent in 1945.\n\nMorgan Ome: What the labor movement can learn from its past\n\nThen the tide shifted back. After the Congress of Industrial Organizations\nbegan organizing multiracial unions in the South, segregationist Southern\nDemocrats, whose votes had been crucial for passing the Wagner Act, joined\nforces with pro-corporate Republicans to stymie the New Deal labor agenda.\nThis effort culminated in the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which stripped key\nlabor protections from the Wagner Act. President Harry Truman denounced the\nbill as \u201ca shocking piece of legislation\u201d that would \u201ctake fundamental rights\naway from our working people.\u201d But Congress overrode his veto.\n\nTaft-Hartley marked the beginning of the end of America\u2019s short-lived period\nof strong organized-labor rights. It allowed states to pass \u201cright to work\u201d\nlaws that let workers free-ride on union benefits without paying dues, which\nwould help keep southern states low-wage and non-union. Taft-Hartley made it a\ncrime for workers to join together across employers in \u201csympathy strikes\u201d\n(unlike in Sweden, where postal workers refused last year to deliver license\nplates as a show of support for striking Tesla workers), or even across\nworkplaces in the same industry. It also included anti-communist provisions\nthat led to a purge of many of the labor movement\u2019s most effective organizers,\nespecially those most successful in promoting multiracial organizing. Taken\ntogether, these changes choked off the growth of working-class solidarity that\nwas flourishing in other Western democracies at the time.\n\nTaft-Hartley did not immediately doom the labor movement, however. It was more\nlike a time bomb. Established unions remained strong and popular for decades,\nboosted by the conventional wisdom that a careful balance between labor and\ncapital was the goose laying the postwar golden eggs. As Dwight Eisenhower\nwrote to his brother in 1954, \u201cShould any political party attempt to abolish\nsocial security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm\nprograms, you would not hear of that party again in our political history.\u201d\n\nThe time bomb finally began to go off in the 1970s, when a confluence of\nfactors\u2014the stagflation crisis, the rise of Milton Friedman\u2013style economic\ntheory, the fracturing of the Democratic coalition\u2014made anti-union policy much\nmore politically viable. And corruption in some unions, laid bare by high-\nprofile congressional hearings, cast doubt on the integrity of unions\ngenerally. Richard Nixon appointed pro-corporate justices to the Supreme Court\nwho over the following decades would dilute labor protections even further\nthan Taft-Hartley had. And in 1981, Ronald Reagan crushed the air-traffic-\ncontroller strike, signaling that the federal government would tolerate\naggressive union-busting actions by employers. This in turn gave birth to a\nnew \u201cunion avoidance\u201d consulting business that taught bosses how to exploit\nthe vulnerabilities that had been injected into labor law. Those\nvulnerabilities turned out to be extensive.\n\nDuring the period between the passage of the Wagner Act and Taft-Hartley,\nunion organizing was relatively straightforward. Organizers would typically\ndistribute cards to rank-and-file activists, who would collect signatures and\nreturn them to the organizers, who would file the signed cards with the NLRB.\nIf a majority of a workplace signed the cards, the NLRB would certify the\nunion. During bargaining, if the company and the union couldn\u2019t reach\nagreement, the workers had various ways of exerting leverage, including\ncalling a sit-down strike or blocking the employer\u2019s goods from being accepted\nat other workplaces.\n\nToday, even if a majority of workers sign union cards, the union has to win an\nNLRB election to be recognized. This process does not much resemble the free\nand fair elections we vote in every other November. The company can hire anti-\nunion consultants, who will advise doing everything possible to delay that\nelection, giving management time to intensify its lobbying efforts to scare\nemployees out of voting yes. Thanks to Taft-Hartley\u2019s so-called free-speech\nclause, employers have a broad range of tactics to choose from. For instance,\nalthough they are not technically allowed to threaten to close a warehouse if\nworkers unionize, they can \u201cpredict\u201d that the warehouse will have to close if\nthe union goes through. They can make employees attend anti-union propaganda\nmeetings during work hours, and they don\u2019t have to let union organizers set\nfoot in the parking lot to respond.\n\nIf a union overcomes these obstacles to win majority support, corporate\nhigher-ups, though technically obligated to bargain in good faith, can drag\ntheir heels on contract negotiations with few repercussions. This helps\nexplain why the Amazon Labor Union\u2014which was founded in Staten Island in April\n2021 and recognized by the NLRB in April 2022\u2014 still doesn\u2019t appear close to\nhaving a contract. Labor might be regaining its cultural cachet, but after the\ntriumphant vote is complete and the news cameras go away, employers hold\nalmost all the cards.\n\nAdam Serwer: The Amazon union exposes the emptiness of \u2018woke capital\u2019\n\nThis dynamic, rather than economic or technological shifts, is the key reason\nworkers in more recently established industries are not organized. If Uber and\nLyft had been invented in the 1930s, there would be a large, powerful\nRideshare Drivers\u2019 Union. If movies had been invented in the 2020s, the notion\nof an actors\u2019 guild or a screenwriters\u2019 union would seem absurd to most\npeople. There is nothing more inherently \u201cunionizable\u201d about one job versus\nanother.\n\nOrganized labor could still make a true comeback, one reflected not just in\npublic goodwill but in actual union jobs. The Protecting the Rights to\nOrganize Act, first introduced in 2019, is a comprehensive effort to restore\nthe balance of power in the workplace\u2014repealing much of the Taft-Hartley Act,\nincluding its so-called right-to-work provisions and its ban on solidarity\nactions. The PRO Act passed the House, but stalled in the Senate when a few\nDemocratic senators refused to back filibuster-reform efforts in 2021.\n\nThe PRO Act is a strong bill, and I fought for it during my time as political\ndirector of the AFL-CIO. But one of the lessons of the American labor movement\nis that legal change tends to follow cultural change. Recent trends are\nencouraging. Biden brags about being the first president to visit a picket\nline, and Trump, despite having pursued anti-labor policies while president,\nat least feels the need to try to appear pro-union. At the same time, with\nless fanfare, the strategic effort to dilute worker power continues apace:\nRed-state legislatures are rolling back basic labor laws, including those that\nprotect children, and lawyers for Amazon, Starbucks, SpaceX, and Trader Joe\u2019s\nhave recently challenged the constitutionality of the NLRB.\n\nThe paradox is that it\u2019s hard for labor law to become a top-tier political\nissue precisely because so few Americans have firsthand experience with union\nmembership, or recognize what they have to gain from resetting the balance of\npower between workers and corporations. Overcoming that challenge requires\nrecovering the wisdom that created the modern labor movement: that the fate of\nworking people anywhere is the fate of working people everywhere. It happened\nonce, nearly a century ago. The country was a very different place back then.\nBut, for better and for worse, it was also much the same.\n\nThis article previously misstated the legal venue in which Amazon, Starbucks,\nSpaceX, and Trader Joe's have challenged the constitutionality of the NLRB.\n\nSupport for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett\nFoundation.\n\nMichael Podhorzer is a political strategist and the former political director\nof the AFL-CIO.
