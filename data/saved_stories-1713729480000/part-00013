This is the company's high-end model\naimed at stills shooters, and it is the first-ever Lumix Micro Four Thirds\ncamera to include phase detection autofocus. Despite its target demographic,\nthe G9 II comes with a surprisingly long list of video features as well. A\nthorough redesign, the G9 II is based on the chassis of the full-frame Lumix\nS5 II and S5 IIX, giving it room for plentiful controls and ports.

And if you're someone whose photography it\nsuits, then I'm happy for you. But that's very rarely the case, so it's just\nnot a feature I find very useful, and it's certainly not one I'd use to choose\none camera over another.\n\nA lot of this is because most implementations are terrible. Noticeably, every\nbrand appears to have a slightly different implementation, with the exact\napproach, the number of shots and whether they can be combined in-camera\ndiffering. This strongly points to it being an area in which each manufacturer\nis patenting its own approach and blocking others using it, and in doing so,\nmaking it harder for anyone else to deliver a usable/useful version.\n\n### Lost in a thicket of patents\n\nIt's no surprise that some of the earliest pixel shift modes came from Olympus\nand Pentax: two companies that committed early to the idea of in-body\nstabilization, both looking for other features it could be used to deliver.\n\nThe Pentax system shoots four images, canceling out the Bayer pattern so that\nit has full-color information for each output pixel. This delivers greater\ncolor resolution with less aliasing, greater sharpness (through lack of\ndemosaicing) and the improvement in noise that comes from combining multiple\nimages. These individual shots are combined into a finished output file.\n\nThe Olympus method shoots eight images: four canceling out the Bayer pattern,\nthen moving to position 1/2 a pixel offset from this and repeating the process\nto quadruple the output resolution. This system also combines the images in-\ncamera and is unique in letting you set a delay if you were shooting, say,\nproduct photos and needed time for your strobes to recycle between shots.\n\nPanasonic currently has one of the best (least-terrible?) high-res implementations. There's an eight-shot mode with the option of 4X or 2X the normal pixel count, with or without motion correction, or a handheld mode. But the fact that it's essentially three modes, each with its own trade-offs, hints at how far from ideal they all are. At least they're combined in-camera, though.Panasonic G9 II | Panasonic 12-60mm F2.8-4 Asph OIS | ISO 100 | F5.6 | 1/320 sec Photo: Jeff Keller  \n---  \n  \nIt's been mostly downhill from here, though. Sony first adopted a Pentax-like\nfour-shot mode that had to be combined on a computer, before later adding a\nmore Olympus-like 16-shot option. Nikon also offers a choice of Pentax-like\nBayer-canceling or an Olympus-like res-boosting one, each with the option to\nperform it twice for a greater noise/tonal quality improvement. But, like\nSony, these need to be combined off-camera, which requires a level of\npatience, file management and messing around in clunky own-brand software that\nbuilds into an appreciable hurdle.\n\nThanks to the complexity of the X-Trans sensor, the mode on its X-series\ncamera requires 20 shots to deliver its pixel shift mode. Personally, I find\nthat most subjects (even landscapes) have too much movement to wait this long\nand, on a grander scale, that life might be too short for such a commitment.\n\n### Limited benefits\n\nI wanted to capture this burnt-out car, abandoned outside a defunct car dealership before it disappeared. I made the effort to arrive early on one of the only spring mornings with any light and then combined the images when I got home. As a result, I have a bit more detail, some odd cross-hatching in areas of movement, 16 massive Raw files and more information than I wanted about the lens' corner performance. Yay.Sony a1 | Sony 16-35mm F2.8 GM @ 16mm | ISO 100 | F9 | 1/100 sec Photo: Richard Butler  \n---  \n  \nNot only are they slow and clunky to use, but the benefits of multi-shot mode\nare often limited. Even with a static scene and optimal conditions, a 100MP\nmulti-shot mode won't match the results of a 100MP camera, but in most\nsituations it often won't even deliver its own maximal performance.\n\nUnlike smartphones, which make extensive use of multi-shot combination, most\nlarge-sensor cameras read out their sensors quite slowly, creating appreciable\ndelays between each shot, raising the risk of subject movement. The more\nsophisticated systems correct for this motion to some degree but do so by\ndropping back down to using a single image's data, throwing away the detail\nbenefit for any subject that's moved, as well as leaving ghosts and artifacts\naround the image.\n\nThey're also based on making precise sub-pixel movements, so are very\nsensitive to any camera motion, and can't apply stabilization because the\nmechanism is too busy making pre-planned movements.\n\nFinally, the flip-side of the higher resolution pushing aliasing to higher\nfrequencies is that, just like a high-resolution sensor, the shots are quickly\nlimited by diffraction. This means that you'll need very sharp lenses, fairly\nwide open if you want to minimize the degree to which lens shortcomings and\ndiffraction eat away at the hoped-for resolution boost.\n\nMy point being that it's very easy to go to considerable extra effort for\nminimal gain. You still get the noise benefit, of course, but you can gain\nthat by pressing the shutter button several times and merging the images\nyourself: you don't really need a special mode for that.\n\n### Handheld multi-shot modes\n\nHand-held multi-shot modes don't work the same way as tripod modes, so don't offer the Bayer-canceling benefits or the same level of additional detail capture, but they're usable in a much wider range of circumstances. This was shot on an impromptu hike on which I didn't want to play tripod-sherpa.OM System OM-1 | 12-40mm F2.8 Pro II @ 18mm | ISO 200 | F5 | 1/1250 sec Photo: Richard Butler  \n---  \n  \nIncreasingly, we're seeing handheld multi-shot modes appear, and these can be\nused in a broader range of circumstances. But it's worth noting that these\naren't quite the same thing. Instead of moving the sensor in a precise,\ncontrolled way, they measure the degree to which your hand shake has moved the\ncamera, then combine some of a burst of shots to try to boost detail levels.\nYou don't gain the Bayer-cancelling improvement in color resolution or\nsharpness through this approach, and won't see the same degree of detail\nimprovement.\n\n### Old man yells at cloud?\n\nUltimately, I'm not so vehemently against multi-shot modes that I don't think\nthey should exist. Even if they're only useful to a tiny subset of users, I\ncertainly don't begrudge those people gaining a feature they want. But they're\nso often so awkward to use and offer so little benefit in most circumstances,\nthat I find it hard to be that enthusiastic about even the best (least-bad?)\nversions.\n\nThere's a chance that my position is every bit as solipsistic as those who\nargue that cameras shouldn't have video modes, just because they don't use\nthem. I'd like to think that my position is slightly different in that I\ndislike them because I don't use them and have found them to be highly\nimpractical and often awkward to use.\n\nBut to each their own. I'm certainly not about to start marking a camera down\nfor having an extra feature, no matter how much clutter it adds to the menus.\nBut equally, I'm not about to take up the cause of any commenters demanding\nthat it's a feature every new camera MUST have.\n\nTags: opinion, pixel-shift\n\nView Comments (219)\n\n## Comments\n\nAll (219)\n\nMost popular (15)\n\nEditors' picks (0)\n\nDPR staff (8)\n\nOldest first\n\nComments on this article may be moderated before they are made public.
