This issue skews\n> benchmark effectiveness and fosters potentially unfair comparisons, impeding\n> the field's healthy development. To address this, we introduce a detection\n> pipeline utilizing Perplexity and N-gram accuracy, two simple and scalable\n> metrics that gauge a model's prediction precision on benchmark, to identify\n> potential data leakages. By analyzing 31 LLMs under the context of\n> mathematical reasoning, we reveal substantial instances of training even\n> test set misuse, resulting in potentially unfair comparisons. These findings\n> prompt us to offer several recommendations regarding model documentation,\n> benchmark setup, and future evaluations. Notably, we propose the \"Benchmark\n> Transparency Card\" to encourage clear documentation of benchmark\n> utilization, promoting transparency and healthy developments of LLMs. we\n> have made our leaderboard, pipeline implementation, and model predictions\n> publicly available, fostering future research.\n\nComments:| 30 pages; Homepage: this https URL  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.18824 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.18824v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.18824arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Zengzhi Wang [view email] [v1] Mon, 29 Apr 2024 16:05:36 UTC (393 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Benchmarking Benchmark Leakage in Large\nLanguage Models, by Ruijie Xu and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
