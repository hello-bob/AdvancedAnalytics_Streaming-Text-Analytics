(The 5-Minute Sniff Test)\n\nMay 3, 2024\n\n> If you can\u2019t spend 5 minutes testing your work, then don\u2019t make me.\n\nI\u2019ve spent 18 years in the software engineering industry, and have been called\na programmer, then a developer, and now a software engineer \u2014 next is\n\u201cdelivery demon,\u201d mark my words. In that time, I\u2019ve tested my fair share of\ncode. I\u2019ve worked as a part-time tester, tested code I\u2019ve written, ran Quality\nAssurance (QA) groups, and poked my nose into systems I shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nThere are many titles for those who professionally test software. You might be\ncalled a Tester, a QA Analyst, or an Engineer in Test. You might be creating\nincredibly advanced automation scripts that produce beautiful reports via\nSonarQube, or you might be doing fully manual testing. Regardless of your\ntitle or approach, you are trying to discover issues before they make it to\nproduction, and users discover them.\n\nA Tester is an Engineer\u2019s partner in crime. Just like the editor of a book,\nyou take what others (i.e. Engineers) have written and make it greater. As\nSteinbeck said of his editor Pat Covici, \u201cHe was much more than my friend. He\nwas my editor. Only a writer can understand how a great editor is a father,\nmother, teacher, personal devil, and personal god. For 30 years Pat was my\ncollaborator and my conscience. He demanded more than I had, and thereby\ncaused me to be more than I should have been without him.\u201d\n\nTesters help Software Engineers go from Good to Great.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve come to believe two things about testing:\n\nFirst, what a tester does is hard. Their task requires the application of\nprecision to a project\u2019s specific requirements, unconventional thinking (box,\nwhat box?), channelling the end user, and a holistic/system-level view.\nTesters do an amazing job and have been critical to my success in releasing\nawesome software.\n\nSecond, a Tester\u2019s job is made even harder by Software Engineers, because\nEngineers hand over shit code that doesn\u2019t pass what I call the \u201c5-Minute\nSniff Test.\u201d\n\n# The 5-Minute Sniff Test\n\nAs a Software Engineer, you chose a career building great software. You love\nsolving fun and interesting problems using the latest frameworks, the coolest\nalgorithms, and rainbows & unicorns. On a daily basis, \u201cYou Crush It!\u201d\nHowever, all that screeches to a halt if you have to stumble through the muck\nof poorly defined (sometimes incomprehensible) requirements just to get to the\nheart of the problem.\n\nYour progress is delayed, your time is wasted, and you\u2019re pissed off! All of\nthis could have been avoided if the Product Manager had just put a little more\ncare into what they handed you. Doesn\u2019t the PM take pride in their work? Do\nthey even know what they are doing? Garbage in is garbage out.\n\nWhen it is the Software Engineer\u2019s turn to hand over their work, the code\nquality determines the efficiency, success, and morale of the person testing.\nThe Tester expects the same level of quality as the Software Engineer expected\nfrom the PM. This doesn\u2019t mean your code is bug free \u2014 we don\u2019t want to be\nputting anyone out of a job \u2014 but it does mean your code meets a certain level\nof quality and professionalism.\n\nHow do we quantify the quality and professionalism expected? Enter the\n5-Minute Sniff Test. Basically, if a someone (Tester, QA, Spouse, or Priest)\ncan find major and obvious bugs in the first five minutes of testing your\ncode, then you didn\u2019t spend enough time testing. You\u2019ve wasted your time,\ndisrespected the Tester\u2019s time, and started to build a reputation for\ndelivering sloppy work (question: do you even know what you\u2019re doing?). You\nlaid a rotten egg that smells bad, everyone knows it is you, and you should be\nembarrassed. Garbage in is garbage out.\n\n# A Lesson from the Front\n\n> That \u201cI want to crawl under a rock\u201d feeling\n\nMy team and I once built an awesome new feature in our iPad app that was\ntechnically challenging and had the coolest design, and I was very proud of\nthe work we did. It rocked and we had crushed it!\n\nWith a cheshire cat grin, I presented the app to our CTO of Asia (senior guy\nwith about 10,000 people reporting to him). He started clicking everywhere\nexcept where I wanted him to click.\n\nNo. Don\u2019t! STOP!\n\nBut he just kept clicking. The app crashed, data wouldn\u2019t load, and mayhem\nensued. He eventually handed the iPad back to me and grumbled, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t\nlook ready.\u201d\n\nHe never actually saw the new features we had built. I was devastated,\nembarrassed, and wanted to crawl under a rock, but I had also learned an\nimportant lesson.\n\n# Take Care of Your Stuff\n\n> Don\u2019t make someone else pick up after you.\n\nTypically I\u2019ll hear software engineers argue that it\u2019s too hard to change\ntheir mindset from coding to testing.\n\nThat is why we have a testing team, right?\n\nBullshit!\n\nI\u2019m not asking you to walk, rub your tummy, and chew gum at the same time (it\nis harder than you think). I\u2019m asking you to literally spend five minutes\ntesting what you built and what you should be proudly standing behind.\n\nJust because the city has street cleaners, doesn\u2019t mean you should toss your\ncandy wrapper onto the ground.\n\nDon\u2019t make someone else pick up after you.\n\nWe need to do better.\n\nAnd we can.\n\n# How To Perform Your Own 5-Minute Sniff Test\n\nThe 5-Minute Sniff Test is the first line of defense against the \u201cI will just\nhand over anything\u201d mentality.\n\nIt means before you hand over your feature, stop, take a deep breath, clear\nyour mind, and for the next 300 seconds, test what you just built.\n\n  * Outside the Box \u2014 90 Seconds: Did you step outside of your engineering shoes and test from a user\u2019s perspective? Does the feature look nice and feel right, aside from the requirements? I\u2019ve painted myself into corners arguing a feature is valid because it is \u201cwhat the requirements asked for.\u201d\n  * Check Your Unit Tests \u2014 30 Seconds: Do all the unit tests pass, and is there full code coverage? You can\u2019t test everything by hand, so automated unit tests are vital for code quality. The 30 seconds allotted isn\u2019t to create the unit test, but just to verify they pass. You should also consider failing the build if the unit tests don\u2019t pass, which would allow more time for the obvious.\n  * The Obvious \u2014 190 Seconds: Did you test all the obvious cases? For example, if the pressed button should cause unicorns to dance across the screen, be sure to test if pressing the button actually makes unicorns dance across the screen. Do I get any errors in the logs, do rainbows show even though that isn\u2019t part of the requirements (although it should be, because that would be awesome), and what happens if I double click the button? Review the requirements and make sure everything adds up. For example, did you catch that the total number of seconds listed here equals 310 instead of 300 seconds? Let\u2019s correct \u201cThe Obvious\u201d to 180 seconds.\n\nFive minutes is all it takes to make sure you\u2019re not handing over shit. If all\nelse fails, grab a colleague and ask them to sniff around.\n\n# Looking Ahead\n\nIn his book \u201cBlink,\u201d Malcolm Gladwell relates the story of interviewers making\nsnap judgements about the quality of a candidate within the first five seconds\nof meeting. The interviewer continues to subconsciously reinforce their\ninitial impression by subjectively weighing the candidate\u2019s answers towards\ntheir bias.\n\nIn other words, your first impression is your last impression. I don\u2019t believe\nI ever fully recovered my reputation with the CTO of Asia after that bad first\nimpression.\n\nPerforming the 5-Minute Sniff Test to check your shit takes very little time,\nbut it can be of tremendous benefit to you, your colleagues, and your company:\n\n  * It helps you build a Reputation for excellence and quality,\n  * It Respects your partner in crime, the Tester, and\n  * It is more Efficient with everyone\u2019s time.\n\nWhen everything looks and feels right after the 5-Minute Sniff Test, go ahead\nand hand off the feature you are proud of and can stand behind. You\u2019ll have a\nthankful Tester, and have built yourself a reputation as an awesome engineer.\n\n### It's easy to get started.
