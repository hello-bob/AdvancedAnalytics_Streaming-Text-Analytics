It is approved in Canada and\nother countries for use on commercial crops of cereal grains, which can be\nimported to the U.S.\n\nIn EWG's study, the chemical was detected in 77 of 96 urine samples taken from\n2017 to 2023, with levels increasing in the most recent years. The group also\ntested 25 samples of non-organic oat-based foods from U.S. grocery stores,\nincluding Quaker Oats and Cheerios, and found chlormequat in 92% of them.\n\n\"Animal studies link chlormequat to reduced fertility, harm to the\nreproductive system and altered fetal growth,\" the group says.\n\nExperts say it's good to be mindful of this, but not to fixate on it as we\ndon't yet know what it may mean for human health.\n\n\"I think that it was the first study in the right direction, but it's too\nearly to tell,\" Dr. Tomer Singer, chief of reproductive endocrinology and\ninfertility at Northwell Health, tells CBS News. \"And if we should be\nconcerned? I think it warrants definitely more extensive and prospective\nstudy, which unfortunately take years to obtain.\"\n\nHis advice? \"I think that the main thing that we need to advise our patient\nwho are trying to conceive is to have a healthy, balanced diet, eating fruits\nand vegetables as we usually recommend.\"\n\n## Studies on chlormequat side effects\n\nDr. Asima Ahmad, chief medical officer and co-founder of fertility care\nplatform Carrot Fertility says there have been several animal studies on\nchlormequat's impact on fertility, which have shown:\n\n  * Mating difficulties and disruption\n  * Decreased sperm motility and fertilization rates\n  * Dltered embryo growth and development\n  * Fetal development during pregnancy\n\nThese studies all focused on animals like pigs and rats \u2014 not humans.\n\n\"Though these exact studies were not conducted with humans, using animal\nmodels can help us predict how these same exposures may affect humans,\" Ahmad\nexplains.\n\n## Should I not eat oats to support my fertility?\n\nShould oats be out of your diet? Not necessarily \u2014 grains are part of a\nhealthy, balanced diet, Singer points out \u2014 but experts say the study can help\nguide mindful shopping and decision-making.\n\n\"It's going to be the responsibility of each and every patient to read the\ningredients of every product that they consume,\" Singer says. \"Nothing in high\namounts is healthy. Try to diversify and not to eat the same product or the\nsame exact grain and from the same company over and over again. I think that's\nthe best advice we can tell our patients.\"\n\nIf you want to go further, you can opt for organic.\n\n\"Similar to how I counsel my own patients, I recommend trying to eat organic\nand freshly prepared foods as much as possible,\" Ahmad says.\n\nThe companies behind Cheerios and Quaker Oats say they stand by the safety and\nquality of their products.\n\n\"All our products adhere to all regulatory requirements,\" a spokesperson for\nGeneral Mills, the maker of Cheerios, told CBS News in a statement. \"Food\nsafety is always our top priority at General Mills, and we take care to ensure\nour food is prepared and packaged in the safest way possible.\"\n\nA statement from Quaker said: \"We have a comprehensive food safety management\nsystem in place. We adhere to all regulatory guidelines to ensure the safest,\nhighest quality products for our consumers.\"\n\nThe study comes amid an increase in infertility in the United States, with\nabout 12% to 15% of couples unable to conceive after one year of trying,\naccording to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSinger explains diet, lifestyle and environment all play a role in fertility.\nBut instead of focusing on oats specifically, he says it's better to keep a\nbig picture of health in mind.\n\n\"We know that fruits and vegetables and balanced diet \u2014 what we call the\nMediterranean diet \u2014 is healthy for fertility,\" Singer notes, noting that\nbalancing carbohydrates, fat and sugars, taking prenatal vitamins and being\nphysical active are all part of supporting your fertility goals.\n\n-Kate Gibson contributed to this report.\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nWhy you should add gold to your retirement plan now\n\nIsraeli strikes in Rafah kill 18, mostly children, Palestinian officials say\n\nScotland halts prescription of puberty blocking hormones for minors\n\nJawbone of Marine killed in 1951 found in boy's rock collection\n\nMaps show states where weed is legal for recreational, medical use\n\nSara Moniuszko\n\nSara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.
