And the\ntemptation to use AWS\u2019 proprietary databases, queues, and load balancers is\nstrong. They seem to perfectly solve problems and get you moving quickly.\n\nHowever, the moment you start building tight integrations with these niche,\nproprietary cloud services, you're putting your startup's future flexibility\nat serious risk.\n\nWant to migrate? Sorry, but Dynamodb has no real equivalent on other clouds.\nNeed multi-cloud for compliance? Too bad, we don\u2019t have any alternative to\nSQS.\n\nEarly on, you may not realize how debilitating vendor lock-in can be for\nscaling, optimizing costs, expanding globally, or accommodating enterprise\ncustomer needs. It also puts you at a competitive disadvantage because you\u2019re\nnot able to use that new serverless offering that came to market.\n\nI\u2019m not here to say you need to sacrifice cloud-native functionalities. But\nwhen you do use them, use them with caution.\n\nWhat I mean by that is you need to have a \"blue cloud\" mentality - stick to\nusing standard, open, and protocol-compliant resources as much as humanly\npossible. And when you do leverage proprietary capabilities for a key\nadvantage, wrap them in clean abstractions so you can easily swap out\nimplementations across clouds if needed.\n\nFor example, for databases, leverage standard database services like\nPostgreSQL or MySQL RDS rather than proprietary PaaS databases.\n\nIf you do use proprietary services for specific advantages, wrap them for\nportability. For example, if using AWS Lambda for serverless functions, build\nan abstraction layer around it using CDK or Serverless Framework. That way\nyour functions could theoretically be ported to GCP Cloud Functions or Azure\nFunctions with the wrapper handling the differences.\n\nEven for higher-level services, consider portable alternatives. Instead of\nproprietary caching, use portable Redis. Instead of proprietary queues, use\nportable RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka. The options are endless.\n\nThe upfront engineering work to keep provider dependencies enclosed is much\nless costly than the massive asset/revenue risk and technical debt of getting\nstuck in a lock-in prison.\n\nCloud portability may seem like a daunting task when you're just trying to\nship MVP features and grow. But I guarantee you'll be thankful for putting in\nthose abstractions down the road when new opportunities and challenges arise.\nKeep your options open, prioritize portability early, and avoid my scars of\nproprietary regret.\n\nComment on Hackernews.\n\n### Subscribe to DevOps, K8s, and the Cloud\n\nBy Anshul Sao \u00b7 Launched 8 minutes ago\n\nStrong opinions on everything DevOps, Kubernetes and the Cloud\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Stay the hell away from anything that's not cloud portable\n\nanshulsao1.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nNo posts\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Anshul Sao\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
