Obtaining a comprehensive\nunderstanding of cultural developments such as the emergence and lifeways of\nNeolithic groups has been hindered by the limited preservation of stratified\narchaeological assemblages and organic remains, a common challenge in arid\nenvironments. Underground settings like caves and lava tubes, which are\nprevalent in Arabia but which have seen limited scientific exploration, offer\npromising opportunities for addressing these issues. Here, we report on an\narchaeological excavation and a related survey at and around Umm Jirsan lava\ntube in the Harrat Khaybar, north-western Saudi Arabia. Our results reveal\nrepeated phases of human occupation of the site ranging from at least the\nNeolithic through to the Chalcolithic/Bronze Age. Pastoralist use of the lava\ntube and surrounding landscape is attested in rock art and faunal records,\nsuggesting that Umm Jirsan was situated along a pastoral route linking key\noases. Isotopic data indicates that herbivores primarily grazed on wild\ngrasses and shrubs rather than being provided with fodder, while humans had a\ndiet consistently high in protein but with increasing consumption of C_3\nplants through-time, perhaps related to the emergence of oasis agriculture.\nWhile underground and naturally sheltered localities are globally prominent in\narchaeology and Quaternary science, our work represents the first such\ncombined records for Saudi Arabia and highlight the potential for\ninterdisciplinary studies in caves and lava tubes.\n\n## Figures\n\nCitation: Stewart M, Andrieux E, Blinkhorn J, Guagnin M, Fernandes R, Vanwezer\nN, et al.

Human occupation in northern Arabia during the\nPleistocene was sporadic and seemingly linked to periods of improved climate,\nthough by the Holocene people were able to more consistently settle the region\nthrough dry intervals [1, 2]. The proliferation of archaeological sites in the\nHolocene has been interpreted as reflecting population growth in the region,\nspurred by the onset of the Holocene Humid Period (HHP) at around 10,600 years\nbefore present (BP). This was followed by the introduction of domestic\nlivestock, and later by the development of water-harnessing technologies\n(e.g., wells, dams) and oasis agriculture in the Bronze Age, when arid\nconditions returned [2]. Many of the features that define the Neolithic\nelsewhere, such as sedentism, pottery, and agriculture, are notably absent\nfrom northern Arabia until the Bronze Age. As such, we follow previous works\n[3] in classifying the \u2018pre-Neolithic\u2019 as the period preceding the\nintroduction of livestock (before ca. 8,000 years BP) but for which there are\napparent cultural links to Neolithic groups in the Levant, and the subsequent\n\u2018Neolithic\u2019 as the period following the introduction of livestock (after ca.\n8,000 years BP) and characterized by highly mobile herders that retain hunting\nin their cultural subsistence practices.\n\nEvidence for pre-Neolithic occupation is recorded in the rock art of northern\nArabia. This includes hunting scenes superimposed by depictions of livestock\nherds, as well as reference to the HHP in the depiction of fauna (e.g., lesser\nkudu, African wild ass) that today do not inhabit true deserts [4\u20136]. Pre-\nNeolithic artefacts have also been recovered, though such findings are\nrestricted to just a handful of sites. In the Jubbah Basin, lithics with\nsimilarities to the Levantine Geometic Kebaran were found deposited on\nsediments dated to ca. 12,250 years BP at Al-Rabyah [7]. However, detailed\ngeochronological analysis suggests that this may reflect a minimum age [8],\nwith similar assemblages in the Levant dating to ca. 18,000\u201316,250 years BP\n[9]. Assemblages with similarities to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN; dated to\nca. 12,175\u20138,450 years BP in the Levant) have been documented at Jebel Qattar\n101 [10] and Jebel Oraf [11] with finds at the former putatively associated\nwith an adjacent palaeolake dated to 8,978\u20137,900 years BP. Just south of the\nNefud Desert at the recently discovered site of Sahout, a backed bladelet of a\ntype common in the Levantine Natufian (where this period dates to ca.\n14,900\u201311,750 years BP), albeit also known from the PPNA (ca. 12,175\u201311,000\nyears BP), was found [12]. The presence of archaeological deposits at the site\ndating to the Neolithic, but also to earlier periods (ca. 13,400\u20138,800 years\nBP), and their association with large naturalistic camel engravings, supports\nearlier hypotheses that this rock art tradition may pre-date the Neolithic\n[12].\n\nNeolithic occupations in northern Arabia are better represented. This includes\na rich rock art record in which the herding of cattle and caprids is commonly\ndepicted [4, 13]. Hearth sites are also a common feature of the early\nNeolithic landscape of northern Arabia, often occurring in high numbers\nalongside ancient lake deposits. For example, at Jebel Oraf, 170 hearths have\nbeen documented, the majority of which date to roughly between 7,300 and 7,000\ncal. years BP, but also extending up until the recent period, indicating a\nrecurrent and long-term use of the basin [3]. At Alshabah in the western Nefud\nDesert, 125 hearths were documented, with the dating of three of these\nproducing ages between ca. 7,300 and 6,500 cal. years BP [14]. The abundant\nrock art, hearth deposits, and associated wild (e.g., gazelle, ostrich) and\ndomesticated faunal remains (e.g., cattle, caprids) suggest that regions like\nthe Jubbah and Alshabah basins were important foci in the landscape for early\npastoralists and their herds.\n\nMore recently, efforts to document, excavate, and date the plethora of\nmegalithic stone structures that can be found scattered across the deserts\nhave revealed that these too formed part of the pre-Neolithic, Neolithic, and\nlater period landscapes of northern Arabia [15\u201322]. Of these, the famous\nhunting mega-traps\u2014commonly known as \u2018desert kites\u2019\u2014may be the oldest, as\nsuggested by recent work in southern Jordan indicating their construction by\nas early as ca. 10,000 years BP [23\u201325]. Although very few of these structures\nhave been directly dated, it appears that they may have been built and in use\nfor millennia [26, 27], including into historic times, as implied in early\nethnographic accounts that recall gazelle hunts in Jordan and Syria seemingly\nemploying such structures [26, 28, 29].\n\nThe next oldest structures appear to be the circular dwellings with upright\nstones and the large rectangular structures called \u2018mustatils\u2019, both dating\nfrom around 7,200 years BP [16, 17, 20]. The latter appears to have had a\nritualistic purpose, as suggested by the intentional placement of selected\nwild and domestic animal remains\u2014namely bucrania\u2014as well as orthostats and\nsmall fires within the structure\u2019s chambers [17, 30]. More than their ritual\npurpose, it has been suggested that mustatils were important for maintaining\nsocio-economic and cultural links between families and the wider community\nthrough activities such as feasting, as well as having functioned as\nterritorial markers [21].\n\nAnother impressive feature of the region are the \u2018funerary avenues\u2019 which\ncomprise long-distance pathways flanked by pendant-shaped structures that\nradiate out from major oases, and which may date from as early as ca. 5,600\nyears BP [31]. The fact that these \u2018avenues\u2019 link together major water\nsources, while the earlier mustatils are often oriented towards water,\nsuggests that these stone structures may have played an important role in\npastoralist social, economic, and cultural lifeways over millennia. In\naddition to these, a variety of other structures such as trapezoidal platforms\n[19] and thousands of burial cairns have also been documented [16, 32].\n\nTaken together, these findings have highlighted the dynamism of the\nHolocene\u2014and possibly terminal Pleistocene\u2014archaeological record of northern\nArabia. Despite these efforts, however, the exact timing and nature of the\nvarious occupations in northern Arabia, and their connections with groups in\nthe nearby Levant, remain poorly understood. A principal reason for this\nrelates to the poor preservation of organic remains (e.g., bone, pollen,\nphytoliths) in arid environments [33, 34]. This is well illustrated at the\nOraf 2 hearth site, where of the >1800 bone fragments less than 1% were\nidentifiable to a taxon [3], and where almost no macrobotanical remains were\nrecovered despite strong use-wear evidence for the on-site processing of plant\nremains [33]. Wind erosion, heat exposure, and high amplitude temperature\nfluctuations all serve to degrade and fragment bones and other organic remains\nin Arabia [34]. Such processes are even problematic for remains interred\nwithin structures. However, some recent excavations have uncovered\nexceptionally well-preserved faunal remains due to their positioning under\nrocky outcrops that serve to protect the remains from the elements [17, 30].\n\nTo that end, our fieldwork was redirected to investigate caves and other\nunderground settings where organic remains have a better chance of survival.\nDespite long-standing explorations of caves and lava tubes in northern Arabia\n[35\u201338], often for their potential as tourism show caves, none have been\nsubjected to systematic archaeological survey or investigation. Here, we\nreport our work on the Umm Jirsan lava tube (25.5888 N, 39.7570 E; WGS84),\napproximately 125 km north of Medina. Umm Jirsan Cave represents both one of\nthe first documented underground archaeological sites in the interior of\nArabia and one of the few sites in Saudi Arabia that has been dated to the\nearly to mid-Holocene (Figs 1 and 2).\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 1.

Early work by Gilmore and colleagues [41, p. 13] reported\narchaeology ranging from the Lower Palaeolithic through to the Neolithic, the\nlatter including \u201ctabular flint scrapers, blades, bifacial retouch, ground\nstone, trianguloids... and \u201cT\u201d shaped notched tools.\u201d More recently, aerial\nand remote sensing work has documented hundreds of Neolithic and Bronze Age\nmegalithic structures [22, 42, 43]. This work has demonstrated the rich\narchaeological record of the area. However, with only limited excavations and\nabsolute dating, it has remained challenging to build a detailed view on human\nprehistory in the area.\n\nAnnually the area receives little rainfall (<100 mm), soil cover is sparse,\nand vegetation consists mostly of xeromorphic dwarf shrublands [44]. Despite\nthe limited rainfall, the harrats often have well-developed wadi systems that\nfeed into major oases, promoting aquifer recharge and the activation of\nsprings [18]. During the more humid periods of the Pleistocene and Holocene,\ndepressions bordering the lava fields would have boasted freshwater ponds and\nlakes, generating wetlands along these drainage courses that would have\npromoted vegetation growth, increased biodiversity, and facilitated human and\nanimal movements [45].\n\nUmm Jirsan is currently the longest reported lava tube in Arabia in terms of\nthe horizontal length of passages, at 1481 metres (m), and has a typical\npassage height of 8\u201312 m and maximum passage width of 45 m [36]. The lava tube\nconsists of three segments separated by two large collapses. Previously, entry\ninto the cave was rather difficult, but in 2017 a wall was built by the Saudi\nCommission for Tourism and National Heritage around the main collapse entrance\nand a large staircase inserted. From this collapse, the huge western entrance\nleads to a large passage, at the end of which the passage rises and then soon\nbecomes blocked with boulders.\n\nHere, and elsewhere throughout Umm Jirsan, massive caches of bone can be\nfound, and we previously reported on the excavation of one such cache located\nin the back chamber of Area A (Fig 2) [40]. Taphonomic and ethological\nanalysis revealed that the Area A bone assemblage is the product of striped\nhyena (Hyaena hyaena) bone accumulating and denning behaviours. The material\nis exceptionally well-preserved and preliminary radiocarbon dating revealed\nthat the fossils date as far back as 7,000 cal. years BP. From the excavation,\nremains of microfauna (e.g., lizards, birds, hare, rock hyrax), carnivores\n(e.g., wolf, hyena), various ungulates (e.g., gazelle, caprid, cattle, camel,\nand equids), and two human cranial fragments were recovered, the latter likely\nresulting from striped hyena\u2019s ability to loot human grave sites. In addition\nto these two specimens, seven human cranial fragments were recovered from\nelsewhere in Umm Jirsan: four from the Area A front chamber; one from nearby\nTrench 1 in Area C; and another further along the eastern passage between Area\nC and Area D (Fig 2) [see 40].\n\nThe eastern passage from the main collapse entrance is also very large, around\nten metres high and 30 metres wide. Various circular stone structures\u2014as well\nas apparent rectangular structures and a stone wall found elsewhere at Umm\nJirsan\u2014attest to human use of the lava tube at some point in the past (S9 Fig\nin S1 File) [36]. Here, we report on a second excavation undertaken in the\neastern passage of the lava tube, supplemented with the discovery of lithic\nartefacts and rock art in the surrounding region, as well as isotopic data\nobtained from human and faunal remains recovered from throughout Umm Jirsan.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Survey and excavation\n\nWe surveyed Umm Jirsan Cave with an interdisciplinary team to evaluate visible\narchaeological, palaeontological, and sedimentary materials and identify areas\npossibly preserving sub-surface material. For ease of description, several\nareas of the cave have been labelled with simple codes following our earlier\nexploration of the cave [40] and shown in Fig 2.\n\nA pit previously dug along the northern wall of the entrance to Area C,\npossibly for the purposes of looting or reaching water, revealed that lithic\nartefacts were present in the sediments. Therefore, we decided to place a 1 x\n1 m test excavation in an undisturbed area adjacent to the pit (Trench 1). We\nused a single context excavation method, differentiating discrete excavation\nunits (XUs) based on the sedimentology, but subdividing them into 10 cm thick\narbitrary XUs where necessary to help control artefact provenance within a\ngiven deposit. A total station was employed with EDM software [46] to record\nthe position of large artefacts (>20 mm), as well as spatial extents of each\ndeposit, the location of sediment samples recovered, and key characteristics\nof the trench location within the cave. All excavated sediments were sieved\nthrough 5 mm mesh to enhance artefact recovery, with further sieving of spoil\nfrom the pit to collect further finds. Samples for luminescence dating were\nrecovered from the sediment section in opaque metal tubes with associated bulk\nsamples.\n\nIn addition to the excavation, the area to the east of Umm Jirsan was\nsurveyed. Where archaeological materials were observed, their location was\nrecorded using GPS devices, photographs taken, and representative samples\ncollected. In the case of rock art, multiple photos were taken and then the\nImageJ \u00a9 plugin DStretch was used to aid visibility. DStretch uses a number of\npre-set algorithms that allow reproducible modification of contrast, hue, and\ncolour space [47]. Although the DStretch plugin is designed to enhance the\nvisibility of rock paintings, several settings also produce good results for\nrock engravings. In addition, photographs were modified using Adobe Lightroom\nto enhance visibility of the faded engravings.\n\n### Lithic and faunal analysis\n\nLithics were analysed to record their raw material characteristics and basic\ntypo-technological features. Photographs and illustrations were taken of\nselected pieces. The methodology follows that previously utilised by our\nproject in the region [48, 49]. Samples of obsidian were collected at\nidentified raw material outcrops in the survey east of Umm Jirsan and used for\nknapping experiments to understand the properties of the rock [see also 50,\n51]. While this rock has previously been described as obsidian [49, 50], it\nhas not yet been geochemically analysed in detail, and appears rather opaque\nand may well be characterised as rhyolitic obsidian or rhyolite/obsidian.\nHereafter we refer to the material as obsidian but note the need for future\nstudies to elucidate its characteristics.\n\nFaunal bones recovered from Trench 1 and the spoil heap (NRSP = 653) were\nidentified to the lowest taxonomic level, facilitated by key literature [e.g.,\n52, 53] and osteological collections housed at the Royal Museum for Central\nAfrica, Belgium. Maximum specimen length and width were collected using\ndigital callipers and additional morphometric measures taken following\nHarrison and Bates [52] and von den Driesch [54] to assist in taxonomic\nattribution. Well-established quantitative units were used to present the\nresults: number of recovered specimens (NRSP); number of identified specimens\n(NISP); minimum number of elements (MNE); and minimum number of individuals\n(MNI). MNE and MNI were calculated using a zonation system adapted from Dobney\nand Rielly [55]. Unlike MNE, MNI was calculated by taking into consideration\nthe laterality (left, right) of the element and age of the individual.\nNormalized values (%NISP, %MNE) were also calculated following Binford [56].\n\nGiven the limited assemblage, all specimens were placed into one of two size\nclasses of animal; microfauna (<1 kg; e.g., rodents, birds) and macromammals\n(>1 kg; gazelle, caprids, equids). All specimens were assessed for bone\nsurface modifications (e.g., weathering, gnaw marks) by eye and light\nmicroscopy following established methods [e.g., 57]. Long bone fracturing\n(fracture angle, edge, and outline) and circumference completeness were\nrecorded following Villa and Mahieu [58] and Bunn [59], respectively. Mandible\nand maxilla fragmentation and degree of digestion of rodent in-situ molars and\nisolated incisors were recorded following the criteria described by Fern\u00e1ndez-\nJalvo et al. [60]. For full discussion of the methods used, see Stewart et al.\n[61].\n\n### Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating\n\nThree samples (UJS1, UJS2, and UJ3) were collected from the excavated trench\nat depths of 1.04 m, 0.94 m, and 0.45 m from the surface, respectively (Fig\n3). The samples were sent to the Royal Holloway Luminescence Laboratory, Royal\nHolloway University of London, to be prepared under subdued red-light\nconditions. The outer, light-exposed portions of each sample were removed and\nused for environmental dose rate measurements and estimation of the sample\u2019s\nmoisture content. The remaining sediment was treated with hydrochloric acid\n(1M HCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H_2O_2) to remove carbonate and organic matter\nrespectively. The samples were wet sieved to the 150\u2013180 \u03bcm fraction size.\nQuartz and K-feldspars were extracted using density separation at 2.58 g/cm^3,\n2.62 g/cm^3, and 2.70 g/cm^3. Full details of the equipment used and results\ncan be found in the S1 File.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 3.

Collagen was extracted using a modified Longin method and the\ndried extract was subject to combustion, reduction, and AMS measurement\nfollowing established methods [62, 63]. Charcoals were subject to an acid-\nbase-acid cleaning protocol prior to radiocarbon measurement following Dunbar\net al. [62].\n\n### Isotopic analysis and Bayesian modelling\n\nCollagen extracted for radiocarbon dating was also subject to stable isotope\nanalysis at SUERC following Dunbar et al. [62]. Ancillary carbon (\u03b413C) and\nnitrogen (\u03b415N) stable isotope ratios are expressed using delta notation\nrelative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB), Atmospheric Nitrogen (AIR)\nstandards, respectively. Laboratory uncertainty values were calculated as\n\u00b10.1\u2030 for \u03b413C and \u00b10.2\u2030 for \u03b415N.\u201d\n\nA small number of faunal remains recovered from throughout Umm Jirsan, though\nprimarily from the Area A excavation and reported in Stewart et al. [40, Table\n1], were assessed for their \u03b4^13C and \u03b4^15N isotope values (n = 9). This\ncomprises teeth (dentine) from two gazelle (Gazella sp.), a single caprid\n(Capra sp.), a single aurochs/cattle (Bos sp.), and five wild ass/donkey\n(Equus sp.). Of the nine human cranial fragments recovered from Umm Jirsan,\nfour were radiocarbon dated and have corresponding stable \u03b4^13C and \u03b4^15N\nisotopic data. One of these originated from the original Area A excavation\n(UJS-2019-1031), two were discovered in the Area A front chamber\n(UJS-2019-200040, UJS-2019-200042), and the fourth from Area C near the new\nTrench 1 (UJS-2019-100013) (see Fig 2).\n\nThe faunal remains range in age from ca. 400 to 4,100 cal. years BP, whereas\nthe human remains range from ca. 150 to 6,000 cal. years BP [40]. While these\nfinds were not recovered from the Trench 1 excavation directly, given their\nproximity to the trench\u2014all from within a few hundred meters of Trench 1\u2014and\nthe broad and overlapping ages, they provide a through time record of climatic\nand dietary change over a period directly relevant to the findings from Trench\n1.\n\nLocal annual rainfall and temperature is correlated with the prevalence of\nplant photosynthetic pathways in the grass cover of arid regions [64\u201366], with\ntypically a greater presence of C_4 plants in hotter and drier settings. Using\n\u03b4^13C values from the skeletal remains of grazing herbivores, which randomly\nsample from available grasses and are not subject to foddering by humans, it\nis possible to reconstruct past grass covers [67]. In addition, aridity is\nalso correlated with \u03b4^15N values in plants, with higher aridity levels\nresulting in higher \u03b4^15N values for plants and consequently for grazers [68,\n69]. Therefore, there is an expected relationship between \u03b4^13C and \u03b4^15N\nvalues for grazers feeding on wild grasses.\n\nBayesian dietary estimates were made using the R-based software ReSources, an\nupgraded version of the Bayesian mixing model FRUITS [70, 71]. To model\nherbivore C_3 vs. C_4 intakes, a two-member model was employed with reference\n\u03b4^13C values of -25.2\u2030 and -11\u2030, respectively. These correspond to averages of\nmodern grasses published by Cerling and colleagues [67] shifted by 1.5\u2030 to\naccount for fossil fuel contributions to atmospheric CO_2 \u03b4^13C values. An\nisotopic offset of 5\u00b10.5\u2030 between plant diets and herbivore bone collagen was\nincluded in the model. A similar model was implanted for human estimates of\nC_3 vs. C_4 protein intakes. This assumes that there is a negligible isotopic\ndifference in human \u03b4^13C values when consuming directly C_3 or C_4 plants or\nanimals fed on these. Finally, for human estimates of plant vs. animal protein\nintakes, a two end-member model was implemented with an \u03b4^15N offset of\n5.5\u00b10.5\u2030 between diet and consumer [72]. Reference plant and animal \u03b4^15N\nvalues were 6.8\u2030 and 10.3\u2030, respectively. The latter correspond to selected\nherbivore average and to obtain a plant reference an offset of 3.5\u2030 was\nsubtracted.\n\nTo produce a smooth curve for human \u03b4^13C values though time, the Bayesian\nsoftware PlotR was employed. This uses a thin plate spline approach to produce\nsmoothed curves following Wood [73]. The curve was generated using 4 basis\nfunctions with a uniform distribution for x-values (95% calibrated ranges for\nindividual radiocarbon dates). Full model description can be found on the\nPandora & IsoMemo software platform [74].\n\n### Ethics statement\n\nAll necessary permits were obtained for the described study, which complied\nwith all relevant regulations.\n\nThe nine human skeletal remains from Umm Jirsan mentioned in the described\nstudy are presently housed at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology,\nGermany. Once all analyses are finalized, these specimens will be returned to\nthe Saudi Heritage Commission, Saudi Arabia, for permanent storage. Collection\nand analysis of these specimens were done under a permit granted by the Saudi\nHeritage Commission.\n\nSpecimen numbers: UJS-2019-1031, UJS-2019-100013, UJS-2019-200040,\nUJS-2019-200041, UJS-2019-200042, UJS-2019-200043, UJS-2019-200044,\nUJS-2019-200045, UJS-2019-300027.\n\n## Results\n\n### Umm Jirsan archaeology\n\nArchaeological remains were found in various parts of Umm Jirsan (Fig 1). We\ndescribe these from west to east. At the far western end of the lava tube,\nArea A consists of the large bone accumulation that was published in Stewart\net al. [40], where, among the bones, fragments of cloth and worked wood were\nfound. Moving east, three lithics were found just inside the western entrance\nto the lava tube (Area B). One large lithic (360 g) and a fresh obsidian flake\nwere found on the entrance slope down into the tube, and two smaller flakes\nwere slightly further underground at the base of the passage where a small\nstreambed has incised the floor. At least one semi-circular structure is\nlocated against the northern wall of the western entrance, the age of which\nremains unknown. Occasional lithics were also found at the base of the main\nentrance collapse (i.e., at the base of the newly built stairs).\n\nIn the eastern entrance (Area C) we retrieved several lithics located in the\nspoil heap of the previously dug hole. Sieving the spoil heap produced 20\nlithics with an average weight of 11.4 g from approximately 375 litres of\nsediment (Fig 4A\u20134G). Eighteen of these are of different forms of dark green\nobsidian, with the other two being of chert and basalt. Most of the lithics\nconsist of small flakes, but interesting pieces include three similar\nretouched flakes (Fig 4C, 4E and 4F), which are invasively retouched distal\nfragments of large flakes. The repeated shape suggests that flake breakage to\nproduce short and wide flakes was deliberate and a way to produce thick squat\n\u2018scrapers\u2019. The chert piece is a very thin plaquette (Fig 4D), laterally\nbroken and finely retouched along one margin. The chert must have been\nimported from quite a considerable distance, probably from the north [75].\nSemi-circular stone structures and pits are also present in the Area C\nentrance (S9 Fig in S1 File). Due to the volume of stone, dust, and bird\ndroppings, it is hard to distinguish these features clearly, but a large\nproportion of the area is clearly anthropogenically modified.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 4. Umm Jirsan lithic artefacts.\n\nA-G: Area C looters pit spoil heap, H-O: Trench 1, P-AI: Area D. Grey areas\nare retouched. a,b,h,k,n,n,p-ab = flakes, c,d-f, ac-ae = retouched flakes\n(including burins: ac and ad), cores: o, af-ai.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299292.g004\n\nFollowing the eastern passage underground eventually leads to another collapse\nentrance (Area D; 25.58823 N, 39.7648 E). Just inside the entrance, several\ncircular structures (essentially cleared areas) are present (S9 Fig in S1\nFile). In the eastern part of this collapse, a lithic assemblage was\nidentified from an area measuring approximately 6 x 6 m (Fig 4P\u20134Ai). This\nArea D lithic scatter included six cores (Fig 4Af\u20134Ai), 91 flakes, eight\nretouched flakes, and 28 chips and chunks (n = 133). Most of the assemblage\n(86%) consists of obsidian of varying colours from green, to grey, and black,\nwith greenish colour being the most common. Aside from a single rhyolite\nartefact, the rest of the assemblage consists of quartz. The lithics are in a\nfresh condition and are mostly very small, with an average weight of 1.8 g,\nwith the smallest weighing only 0.1 g. Indeed, aside from a single retouched\nflake at 18.1 g and a quartz core at 17.4 g, all lithics from the site weigh\nless than 10 g and 75% are less than 2 g. The assemblage reflects the use of\nbipolar reduction to produce small and elongated flakes. There is also some\nuse of multiplatform methods, likely with free-hand percussion. Three burins\nwere identified (Fig 4Ac and 4Ad), and retouched forms display relatively\nsimple and informal retouch, focussed on the lateral margins. Overall, the\nweathering and technology of these lithics suggest that they are younger than\nthose from Area C. While not confirmed by absolute dating, it is possible that\nthe Area D lithics date to a period such as the Chalcolithic or Bronze Age. In\naddition to the lithics, a piece of pottery and three ostrich eggshell\nfragments were recovered among the Area D lithic scatter.\n\n### Trench 1 excavation and dating\n\nA 1 x 1 m trench (Trench 1) was excavated a few metres east of the previously\ndug pit (Figs 2 and 3) resolving five major layers excavated across thirteen\nexcavation units (XUs), reaching a total depth of 114 cm.\n\nSurface deposits (Layer 1; XU 001) were excavated as a single 18 cm thick\nlayer, comprising dry and dusty greyish brown silty sands that were\ndistinguished from underlying deposits due to differences in moisture content.\nLayer 2 (XU 002\u2013005) comprised a ~30 cm thick deposit of increasingly moist,\nmoderately compacted pale yellowish-brown silty sand. Potentially bioturbated\ndeposits observed at the interface with the underlying sediment unit were\nconstrained in a single XU (XU 006), which comprised a soft dark grey deposit\ncontaining charcoal and rootlets. Layer 3 (XU 007\u2013009) comprised a ~25 cm\nthick deposit of mid greyish brown silty sands supported by pebble to cobble\nsized clasts. Underlying this, Layer 4 (XU 010\u2013011) was an approximately 20 cm\nthick deposit of pale to dark yellowish brown silty sand with some clast\nsupport present in XU 010. The basal deposits uncovered (Layer 5; XU 012\u2013013)\nwere observed to a minimum thickness of ~25 cm and composed of a firm pale\nbrownish yellow silty clay with sub-angular geometric texture.\n\nAnimal bone fragments were common throughout the sequence but were fragile and\ngenerally turned to powder as soon as they were touched. Charcoal was also\nrelatively common, and four samples were selected for radiocarbon dating\n(Table 1). The sediment sequence suggests early sediment formation in very\nlow, humid depositional settings (Layers 5\u20134), interrupted by potential cave\nwall collapse or increased clast mobility within the lava tube (Layer 3), with\na return to lower energy but drier depositional conditions towards the top of\nthe sequence (Layers 2\u20131).\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nTable 1. AMS radiocarbon ages from Umm Jirsan Trench 1 calibrated using Calib\n(v. 8.20) and using IntCal20 [76].\n\nRadiocarbon dating analysis conducted at the SUERC Radiocarbon Laboratory,\nUniversity of Glasgow.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299292.t001\n\nThe upper part of the trench dates to the mid/late Holocene with the OSL\nsample from XU 005 (Layer 2) and radiocarbon sample from XU 004 both giving\nages of ca. 5,800 cal. years BP (Tables 1 and 2). The main occupation horizon,\nXU 011 (Layer 4), has a radiocarbon date of ca. 10,300 cal. years BP. OSL ages\nfrom just beneath this were ca. 8,700 years BP for XU 012 and ca. 9,800 years\nBP for XU 013 (Layer 5). There is a slight inversion with regards to the lower\nOSL and radiocarbon ages, so the age of the main occupation layer may\nconservatively be described as more than the ca. 6,000 years BP and less than\nca. 10,300\u20138,700 years BP. Given the depth and presence of another episode of\nroof fall between XU 011 and the upper dates, we suggest the most likely age\nrange is towards the older end of that range, at approximately 10,300\u20138,700\nyears BP. Given the thin concentration of lithics in the main occupation\nhorizon, and the fact that most of the radiometric age estimates are in\nstratigraphic order, we assume that we are dealing with a basically in-situ\ndeposit.

Thirteen of the lithics were\nwidely distributed in XUs 003 to 010. All remaining 31 lithics (71%) were\nfound in the thin XU 011. Aside from a single core in XU 007 (Fig 4O), which\nshows bidirectional flaking perhaps by the bipolar method, the lithics from\nthe trench all consist of flakes and chips. The 31 lithics found in XU 011\nconsist of 13 flakes and 18 chips with an average weight of 2.3 g, although\n75% are below 1.3 g. Some flakes have a relatively laminar form, while others\nare very wide. Overall, the character of the assemblage indicates on site\nknapping.\n\nA total of 653 faunal bones were recovered (NRSP) from the trench and spoil\nheap, of which 161 (25% of NRSP) were identifiable to a specific skeletal\nelement (full results of the zooarchaeological and taphonomic analysis are\nprovided in the Supplementary Online Material, S5\u2013S11 Tables in S1 File).\nMicromammals dominate the assemblage, whereas larger mammals (e.g., equids)\nand non-mammalian microfauna (e.g., birds, reptiles) are rarely represented.\nBone preservation is variable and appears to correlate with animal body size:\nmicrofauna show fragmentation and digestion due to predation by raptors but\nare on the whole comparatively well-preserved, whereas remains of larger\nanimals are fragile and often heavily fragmented.\n\nA minimum number of 15 individuals representing 11 taxa were recovered from\nthe trench and spoil heap (S5 Table in S1 File). Macromammals include small\ncarnivores (NISP = 3, MNI = 1), gazelles (NISP = 2, MNI = 1), caprids (NISP =\n2, MNI = 1), and equids (NISP = 2, MNI = 1). Non-mammalian microfauna include\nbirds (NISP = 5, MNI = 1), reptiles (NISP = 4, MNI = 2), and frog (NISP = 1,\nMNI = 1). Rodents (NISP = 63, MNI = 7) dominate the assemblage and are\nrepresented by at least three taxa: Gerbillus sp. (gerbil), cf. Arvicanthis\nniloticus (African grass rat), and either Mus sp. (mouse) or Acoyms sp. (spiny\nmouse) (S6 Fig in S1 File). Interestingly, throughout the sedimentary sequence\nthere is an inverse relationship between microfauna and larger animals (S7 Fig\nand S9 Table in S1 File). This suggests that raptors were utilizing the Area C\nentrance as a roosting site when humans were absent.\n\nSubaerial weathering appears to have had little impact on the assemblage (S7\nTable in S1 File), suggesting that bones were buried relatively quickly or, in\nthe case of microfauna, protected from the elements by the pellets in which\nthey were encased. A small number of bones (2.5% of NISP), as well as plant\nremains, are burnt (S6 Fig in S1 File). Three of these were found in the spoil\nheap and therefore might be of more recent origin, while a single burnt small\nanimal midshaft fragment was recovered from XU 011. A few small-sized animal\nmidshafts exhibit flake scars and pits that might be of anthropogenic origin,\nand several bone flakes were also recovered. Several long bones exhibit\noblique, curved, and smooth fracture patterns indicative of fracturing while\nfresh (S10 Table in S1 File). Gastric corrosion is common among micromammal\nremains. For limb bone elements, corrosion is light and restricted mostly to\nthe epiphyses and protuberances (e.g., trochanters). Most teeth had no signs\nof digestion (n = 6), while the remainder exhibited light (n = 2) to moderate\n(n = 2) levels of digestion. Only the mandible bodies were preserved, falling\ninto the low and moderate breakage categories of Fern\u00e1ndez-Jalvo et al. [60].\n\n### Stable carbon (\u03b4^13C) and nitrogen (\u03b4^15N) isotopes of faunal remains\n\nA significant correlation (R^2 = 0.94, F(1,3) = 23.46, p<0.01) between \u03b4^13C\nand \u03b4^15N values for herbivores (excluding asses) was observed at Umm Jirsan\n(Fig 5A). Although caution is warranted given the limited dataset (n = 4), the\ncorrelation suggests that both domesticates and non-domesticates exploited\nthroughout their movements locally available wild grasses instead of being fed\nwith crops managed by humans. There is a wide range in \u03b4^13C herbivore values,\nfrom -18.3 to -8.0\u2030, with corresponding Bayesian estimates for the consumption\nof C_4 plants ranging from 9\u00b19 to 89\u00b18%. Comparison of the regression trend\nfor grazing herbivores with equid isotopic values shows that three of the\nlatter deviate from the trend (Fig 5B). Two asses, dating to the 15^th to\n17^th centuries CE, exhibited a substantial consumption of C_4 plants, yet the\nlowest \u03b4^15N values of all herbivores. This suggests they were likely fed with\nplants grown under wetter conditions, either locally available or from other\nregions. Another equid showed similar \u03b4^13C values to the previous two, yet\nhigher \u03b4^15N values, which implies the consumption of plants from manured\nplots and/or from more arid conditions. No correlation was observed between\ngrazer \u03b4^13C values and their median calibrated radiocarbon age (R^2 = 0.12,\nF(1,3) = 0.4218 p = 0.5623).\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 5.

The continuous line\nis the estimated mean while the band represent the 95% credible interval of\nthe standard error of the mean. Calibrated human radiocarbon ages are\nsummarized by the mean (points) and 95% credible intervals (whiskers).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299292.g005\n\nHuman isotopic results show a wide range in \u03b4^13C values (-16.3 to -10.9\u2030) and\nrelatively high and constrained \u03b4^15N values (15.7 to 17.2\u2030) (Fig 5B).\nBayesian estimates of C_4 intake by humans vary from 21\u00b114 to 65\u00b110%. This\ncould be accounted for by direct consumption of C_4 plants, including cereals\nsuch as millet or sorghum, or by the consumption of animals fed with C_4\nplants, as observed for Umm Jirsan. Due to a lack of reference plant isotopic\nvalues, estimates for the intake of plant versus animal protein are difficult\nto determine. Nonetheless, the difference of c. 6\u2030 between the \u03b4^15N herbivore\naverage (10.3\u00b11.6\u2030, excluding equids) and the \u03b4^15N human average (16.4\u00b11.6\u2030)\nindicates a heavy intake of animal protein. Under a scenario where we assume a\nstandard \u03b4^15N offset of 3.5\u2030 between animal bone collagen and plant protein\n[77], Bayesian estimates of the dietary protein contribution from animal\nproducts range closely from 74\u00b128 to 88\u00b118%. The wide variability in \u03b4^13C\nvalues is indicative of the different individuals consuming different\nproportions of C_3 plants. Notably, there is a significant correlation between\nthe median chronological range for each human and respective \u03b4^13C values (Fig\n5C). This shows that, although a tradition for high protein intake was\nmaintained across time, there was a temporal increase in the consumption of\nanimals fed on C3 plants and possibly also some direct consumption of C_3\nplants such as fruits (e.g., dates, figs) or cereals (e.g., wheat) associated\nwith oasis agriculture. While the human and faunal isotopic trends are\nintriguing, more samples should be sought to further test these correlations.\n\n### Rock art and close environs\n\nSurveys in the area surrounding Umm Jirsan resulted in the discovery of\nadditional archaeological findings (Fig 1). Approximately 2.5 km to the north\nand 3 km to the west of Umm Jirsan, various subcircular cell-like structures\nwere identified, as well as low densities of lithics including small obsidian\nflakes. Near the circular structures north of Umm Jirsan a \u2018bow-tie\u2019 shaped\nstone structure, low in height but covering a large area was also recorded.\nThe age of these structures remains unknown.\n\nThe most interesting locality is a large collapse entrance to another lava\ntube 1.3 km to the east of Umm Jirsan. The lava tube entrance at the end of\nthe collapse is large, but sediments reach the ceiling after ca. 75 metres.\nSeveral small structures (including two small cairns, small clearings, and\ncells) are located both in the entrance and in the base of the collapse area.\nLow density non-diagnostic lithics were identified at the base of the collapse\narea. In addition, 16 rock art panels were documented within the collapse,\nrepresenting the only documented rock art in the vicinity of Umm Jirsan (Figs\n6 and 7). The depicted content is similar across all panels, and most motifs\nare shown in a similar style. Almost all figures have been produced with very\nsmall and fine peck marks that remain visible, attesting to the preservation\nof the rock surfaces at the site. These peck marks also suggest that a similar\ntool was used for most of the engravings.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 6.

Both dogs are extremely simplified but\nshow the characteristic curled up tail.

Bottom right: close up of Panel 9 enhanced using the ybk\nsetting on DStretch.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299292.g007\n\nThe varnish of the engravings is advanced but not complete. On most panels,\nengraved lines are distinguishable as a reddish grey colour against the dark\ngrey surface of the varnished rock (Fig 6). However, many of the figures have\nareas that have darker varnish, and it appears that to an extent this may be\nthe result of vertical streaking, caused by water running down the rock face,\nwhich can accelerate or slow varnish formation. The incomplete varnish on\nsurfaces unaffected by steaking is comparable to possible Chalcolithic panels\nthat have been observed at multiple locations in northern Saudi Arabia,\nalthough a difference in geological substrate and local environment may result\nin difference varnish accumulation rates. Stylistically the rock art shares\nsimilarities with the Neolithic rock art of northern Arabia. However, there is\nsome indication of time depth, suggesting that the art may cover multiple\ncultural periods. In some instances, engravings overlap others, such as a\nhuman figure superimposed over an ibex on panel 7, or a bovid superimposed\nover a cow/bull on panel 6 (Fig 6C). Nevertheless, these superimpositions\ncould have been achieved within a relatively short time span. Only two\nsubstantially later additions can be observed, both carved in a more\nsimplistic style, and coated with markedly lighter varnish: a stick-figure\nibex on the upper right of panel 7, and a stick-figure human on the lower left\nof panel 8. These two figures are also pecked with a cruder tool, producing\nlarger and less precisely placed peck marks.\n\nBased on stylistic conventions, four different bovid depictions can be\nidentified\u2014cattle, sheep, goat, and possibly ibex (Fig 6). Goats are depicted\nwith their horns rising in almost parallel lines, with the tips curved\noutwards (Fig 6B). Another type of bovid is shown with the horns curving back\nin large arches. In some cases, the ridges that are typical for ibex horns can\nbe identified (Fig 6D) and it is possible that bovids with large arched horns\nrepresent ibex. Sheep are depicted with their horns curving back over the neck\nand ears in a characteristic curve (Fig 6A). Several bovids with backward\ncurving horns are shown with very large, exaggerated horns, giving them a\ncattle-like appearance (Fig 6). However, the direction and shape of the horns,\ncombined with a very short tail suggest these are all sheep. Only two bovid\ndepictions could be confidently identified as cattle, and both have large\nforward pointing horns. In one of the depictions the tail is preserved and is\ndepicted as long and downward pointing as is typical for cattle (Fig 6C).\n\nFollowing this stylistic distinction, sheep are the most commonly represented\nanimal in the rock art, with 23 identifiable depictions. In addition, 15 ibex,\nseven goat, and two cattle were identified and these are frequently associated\nwith human figures in apparent herding scenes (S12 Table in S1 File). The\ninclusion of ibex-like animals, in mixed scenes with domesticated species is\ninteresting. However, the possibility remains that some of the bovids with\nbackward arching horns represent a different type of goat breed rather than\nibex. Panel 2 shows an animal with a mixture of both traits with backward\ncurving horns which flare outwards at the tip.\n\nAt least six herding scenes were identified on panels 2, 7, 8 (2 scenes), and\n9. This is notable as these are generally quite rare in the rock art of\nnorthern Arabia. At least one of the pastoral scenes also shows the use of\ndogs (panel 8) to herd a mixed herd of goats and sheep (Fig 7, bottom left and\ninset). The human figures are very simple, most are stick-figure like with\nstraight legs and curved arms, which echo the horn shape of the sheep\ndepictions (Fig 6B).\n\nGiven the content and advanced varnish, the engravings most likely relate to\nthe later occupation phase of the cave, perhaps during the middle Holocene.\nThe dominance of sheep and goat is significant, as they are rarely depicted in\nthe rock art of northern Arabia, particularly in oasis settings such as Jubbah\nand AlUla [6], as well as sites such as Shuwaymis [13] which are dominated by\ncattle.\n\nFinally, we surveyed the volcanic area around Jebel Abyad (Fig 1) to attempt\nto locate the source(s) of obsidian found at and around Umm Jirsan (S4 Fig in\nS1 File). At two localities (named Locality 1 and 2), obsidian clasts and\nlithics were abundant, which, at the former, included Levallois lithics as\nwell as probable Holocene structures. At a third locality (Locality 3), lithic\nartefacts were also identified but unlike the other two localities which had a\nrather mixed character, this locality appears to be comprised entirely of\nMiddle Palaeolithic artefacts. Cores showed a focus on centripetal\npreparation, while most of the larger Levallois flakes have primarily\nunidirectional scar patterns, often with additional minor lateral or distal\npreparation. We also collected some obsidian blocks for knapping experiments.\nThe obsidian was of reasonable quality for flaking, but is very brittle. The\nprevalence of edge damage on the experimental sample matched that of the\narchaeological materials observed at Umm Jirsan. Images of archaeological and\nour experimentally knapped obsidian are shown in S5 Fig in S1 File.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe excavation and survey work conducted in and around Umm Jirsan reveal\nrepeated occupations of the lava tube and surrounding region by\nChalcolithic/Bronze Age, Neolithic, and possibly pre-Neolithic peoples over at\nleast the past seven thousand years and perhaps for as long as ten thousand\nyears. The occupation at Umm Jirsan represents one of the first documented\narchaeological cave sites in the Arabian interior, and one of the few sites in\nSaudi Arabia dated to the early to mid-Holocene. The site highlights the\npotential for archaeological surveys and excavations in underground cave\nsettings in the region for the recovery of novel natural and cultural\narchives.\n\nBased on the radiocarbon and OSL dating, the age of the main occupation layer\n(XU 011) falls between ca. 10,300 and 7,000 years BP. This age range overlaps\nwith other early Holocene archaeological sites in northern Arabia, notably Al\nRabyah, Jebel Qattar, Jebel Oraf, and Sahout, where distinctive\nEpipalaeolithic/PPN artefacts in the form of El-Khiam points and Helwan points\nand bladelets hint at cultural connections to the Levant [7, 10, 12]. However,\nthe lithic assemblages recovered from the Trench 1 excavation and surrounding\narea lack diagnostic forms such as arrowheads or geometric microliths which\nwould allow comparisons with Epipalaeolithic/Neolithic assemblages in the\nwider region. A Neolithic presence at Umm Jirsan is attested by the recent\nidentification of a human cranium dated to ca. 6,800 years BP from Area A, the\nhyena accumulation at the western end of the lava tube [40]. This age matches\nwell with recent radiocarbon dates obtained from mustatils in the Harrat\nKhaybar, as well as circular domestic structures from the nearby Harrat\n\u2018Uwayrid, which suggest that the construction and use of these megalithic\nstructures largely took place between ca. 7,200 and 6,800 years BP [16, 17,\n20, 21], with the age of this particular individual perhaps related to the\nfinal stages of the use of these structures.\n\nLater occupations are evident at Umm Jirsan, as documented by the Area D\nsurface lithic scatter and the nearby rock art which likely dates to the\nChalcolithic, as well as the four human cranial remains recovered from\nelsewhere at Umm Jirsan dating to between ca. 4,500 and 3,000 years BP [36,\n40]. There is again an interesting correspondence between the age of the\narchaeological findings at Umm Jirsan and megalithic structures in the region,\nin this case the pendant tombs, dating to between ca. 4,600 and 4,000 years BP\n[18, 31]. These structures form what have been termed \u2018funerary avenues\u2019 [31].\nEssentially, these avenues comprise composite path and monumental features\nconnecting oases and, in some instances, extending over hundreds of\nkilometres. Notably, Umm Jirsan is situated between the Khaybar oasis on the\none hand, and al Ha\u2019it and al Huwayyit oases on the other, each of which is\nconnected by extended funerary avenues (see Fig 1).\n\nIf, as Dalton and colleagues [31] suggest, these avenues were used by\npastoralists during the movement of their herds between oases and hinterland\npastures, it seems probable that Umm Jirsan marks a stopping off point.\nClearly, pastoralists visited the area, as evidenced by probable Chalcolithic\ndepictions of goat, sheep, and cattle herding scenes in the rock art and the\nrecovery of livestock remains. For such pastoralists, Umm Jirsan may have\nserved as a place of refuge, providing protection from the sun and wind and\npotentially as a natural reservoir of water. Indeed, the use of lava tubes as\nwater reservoirs in antiquity has been suggested previously. In the Harrat al-\nSham (Black Desert) of eastern Jordan, artificial channels leading to and\ndamming walls within lava tubes have been documented, as well as various\nstructures (e.g., walls, crescent-shaped shelters, and possible \u201cpost holes\u201d)\nclearly associated with the lava tube entrances [78\u201381]. Although the age and\nfunction of these various features is not yet known, some scholars have\nsuggested that they date to prehistory [81], and it is of note that the Late\nChalcolithic/Bronze Age settlement of Jawa is nearby to these lava tubes. Even\ntoday, some of these caves are used as sheep pens [80].\n\nAdditional insights regarding human herding and dietary practices over time\ncan be gleaned from the isotopic data. Human isotopic results show a wide\nrange in \u03b4^13C values and relatively high and constrained \u03b4^15N values. The\nwide variability in the former indicates that individuals consumed different\nproportions of C_3 plants and/or C_3-consuming animals, while estimates of the\ndietary protein contribution from animal products range closely from 74\u201388%.\nNotably, there is a significant correlation between the median chronological\nage of each of the human remains and their respective \u03b4^13C values. Taken\ntogether, this suggests a tradition of high protein alongside an increase over\ntime in the consumption of C_3 plants (e.g., fruits, cereals) and/or browsers\n(e.g., goats), with the Neolithic-aged individual having the lowest proportion\nof C_3 resources in their diet. The increasing trend in C_3 resource\nconsumption may relate to the arrival of Bronze Age oasis agriculture which\nsaw the emergence of sophisticated farming and water management technologies\nthat allowed people to cultivate an increasingly diverse array of plant foods,\nas well as settle more permanently in the deserts [2, 82]. This is well\ndocumented in the Tayma Oasis some 200 km northwest of Khaybar, where\npalynological evidence indicates the cultivation of grapevine (Vitis vinifera)\nand fig (Ficus) by as early as ca. 5,300 years BP and the farming of date\npalms (Phoenix) before 3,000 years BP [83]. Although no direct evidence for\nearly agriculture exists yet for Harrat Khaybar, the oasis, with its large\ncatchment area, deep sediments and wadi channels, underlying geology, and\nshallow water table [18, 84, 85], would have been amenable to oasis\nagriculture during Bronze Age times.\n\nThe strong correlation between faunal \u03b4^13C and \u03b4^15N suggests that these\nanimals consumed grasses locally available instead of being fed with crops\nmanaged by humans. For the latter, crop management practices such as\nirrigation or manuring would likely deviate isotopic values from the observed\ncorrelation. Interestingly, the \u03b4^13C values indicate highly varied diets,\nwith some individual consuming mostly C_4 plants, whereas others incorporated\ninto their diets a significant proportion C_3 and/or CAM photosynthesizing\nplants (e.g., as sedges and succulents). Only the more recent 15^th to 17^th\ncentury CE equids remains show a deviation from this trend, with \u03b4^13C values\nthat suggest they were fed with plants grown under wetter conditions, either\nlocally available or from other regions.\n\nGiven the limited size of our dataset and lack of mobility isotopic data\n(e.g., O or Sr isotopes) it is difficult to put forward robust interpretations\non animal mobility. It is possible that the herbivores were fed in two\ndistinct ecozones having extreme isotopic end-members. In this case, one would\nexpect the observed correlation between \u03b4^13C and \u03b4^15N for grazer bone\ncollagen to result from different residence times and seasonal mobility across\nend-members. However, it is also possible that there were an unknown number of\necozones with intermediate isotopic values spread across extreme isotopic\nvalues. More data is needed to test these hypotheses.\n\nThe rock art nearby Umm Jirsan attests to prehistoric livestock practices and\nherd composition in the region. Of particular note is the dominance in the\nrock art of sheep and goat, which are rarely depicted in other oasis settings\nin northern Arabia, such as at Jubbah, or at sites like Shuwaymis [13], which\nare dominated by cattle. It is possible that the local environment made sheep\nand goat herding more economically, and perhaps more symbolically, important.\nHunting of gazelle and perhaps of ibex is also attested at the site in the\nrock art, consistent with the faunal remains from Trench 1.\n\nBoth domestic (e.g., caprids, cattle) and wild (e.g., gazelles) animals were\nprocessed and/or consumed at the site, with evidence pointing to people as the\nlikely accumulators of these remains for several reasons. Firstly, the large\nopen entrance to the eastern passage is not an ideal denning spot for\ncarnivores like striped hyena and foxes, which tend to prefer more sheltered\nsettings [52]. Secondly, the assemblage is rather distinct from clearly\ncarnivore accumulated assemblages found elsewhere throughout Umm Jirsan. This\nincludes the large hyena accumulated caches as reported in [40], as well as\nsmall fox accumulated caches which comprise primarily small accumulations of\nmicrofauna (e.g., rodents, birds) remains surrounding small cracks and\ncrevices in the cave walls. Thirdly, the inverse relationship between the\nmicro and macrofauna is easily explainable by a human presence\u2014through the\ndisturbance of raptors via activities such as hunting and fire use\u2014but less so\nby a carnivore presence. And lastly, the faunal remains are associated with\nlithic artefacts, while some of the bones have possible evidence for human\nbutchery in the form of burning, percussion pits, and fresh fracturing (i.e.,\nmidshafts with oblique, curved, and smooth fracture characteristics). Taken\ntogether, the evidence points to humans as the main accumulating agent of the\nmacromammal remains recovered from the excavation.\n\nIn contrast, the microfauna found at the site appear to be the result of\nraptor predation, most likely some nocturnal owl based on the degree of\nbreakage and digestive corrosion. There is a clear inverse relationship\nbetween the micro and macrofauna throughout the sequence. Namely, when larger\nfauna are present, microfauna are largely absent, and vice versa, indicating\nthat raptors were using the cave while people were absent. A simple reading of\nS6 Fig in S1 File suggests perhaps as many as four distinct occupational\nphases of the cave by people, possibly related to the various Neolithic and\nChalcolithic/Bronze Age occupations of the area. While little is currently\nknown on questions such as occupation continuity in the area, our findings\nsuggest pulses of occupation reflected in both the cultural and faunal\nrecords.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOur findings point to use of Umm Jirsan by predominantly pastoral populations\nthat had increasing links through time with oasis settlements. The lava tube\ndoes not appear to have served as a permanent habitation location, but rather\nas a site that likely lay on herding routes and that allowed access to shade\nand water for passing herders and their animals. Prior to this, as well as\nduring pastoral periods, the lava tube was likely also linked with hunting\nactivities, which probably remained a cornerstone of local economies into the\nBronze Age. Lava tubes like Umm Jirsan offered a rich resource for human\npopulations living in arid habitats and provide important insights into the\nresources these populations drew upon to increase their resilience in a\nchallenging environment.\n\nOur research at Umm Jirsan highlights the value of further research and\ntesting of northern Saudi Arabia\u2019s rich record of caves and rock shelters.\nThese records hold substantial potential to address major limitations of the\ncurrent archaeological record, which relates to open air sites subjected to\nmajor post-depositional transformations and taphonomic degradation. Future\nresearch should target additional sites, drawing upon the full potential of\nmultiproxy methods to document linked cultural and environmental records, in a\nkey and fascinating arid region of the Eurasian continent.\n\n## Supporting information\n\nSupplementary online material.\n\n### S1 File.
