Sometimes my patients wonder if it\u2019s\ntoo good to be true. But as a humble servant of pharmacology, evidence-based\nmedicine, and my patients who struggle with metabolic health, I\u2019m here to tell\nyou that Ozempic is more than meets the eye.\n\nYou might stop here and wonder if I\u2019ve lost my marbles. You might assume I\u2019ve\ndrunk the KoolAid of Big Pharma\u2014or that I\u2019m concocting fake versions of\nOzempic in a camper van and selling it on the internet. Worse, you might think\nthat I prescribe Ozempic as a \u201cone-and-done\u201d slam dunk for anyone trying to\nlose weight.\n\nBut you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nSo, how is it possible that an injectable medication is as magical as it is\neffective at helping patients lose weight and control their type II diabetes?\n\nPhoto by Pablo Merch\u00e1n Montes on Unsplash\n\nThe short story: It is because Ozempic is more than merely a \u201cweight loss\ndrug.\u201d It treats mental health, specifically by targeting the part of the\nbrain where ruminations about food, eating, and body size fester. Ozempic is a\nsophisticated mind/body medication that helps people turn the volume down on\nshame and turn the volume up on their sense of agency in areas where they need\nit the most.\n\nMy patients for whom I\u2019m prescribing Ozempic (and who are taking it for the\nappropriate FDA-approved reasons such as type II diabetes and obesity) are not\nonly losing weight and improving their diabetes, they are unlocking the very\nmechanisms that got them there in the first place. Most importantly, they are\non a newly-paved, biologically-sound road to self-compassion.\n\n###\n\nThe mental and physical weight of obesity\n\nHaving cared for patients for 20-plus years, I think it\u2019s fair to say that\nmost of my patients who have struggled with their weight have experienced\nsome, if not all, of the accompanying challenges:\n\n  * The shame that accompanies obesity and overweight, conditions that our society inappropriately equates with poor willpower or unworthiness.\n\n  * The frustration about the gap between the intent to be healthy and the execution of sustainable and improved habits\u2014a chasm that exists specifically not because of the lack of willpower or information on the harms of excess body weight and one that is only exacerbated by diet culture, thinness bias and the constant drum-beat of doctors telling people to \u201cjust lose weight.\u201d\n\n  * An excessive amount of brain space that is occupied with thoughts about weight, food, eating, and the ongoing judgment about body size by others (including medical providers).\n\nAs I have feverishly and incessantly argued, health is not defined by a\ncertain body weight or cholesterol level. It\u2019s not about the lab test results\nat your annual check up. It\u2019s not about pleasing other people or your doctor.\n\nThis is an ad-free, reader-supported newsletter. Consider supporting this work\nwith a paid subscription!\n\n###\n\nRedefining health\n\nHealth is, in fact, about awareness of the totality of our medical data\n(which, of course, includes body weight, but also includes facts about our\ngenetics, family history, and our life story.) Specifically it includes facts\nsuch as: whether or not your mother had substance use issues during your\nadolescence, you were bullied on the school bus, you are an overachiever and\nchronic people-pleaser, you have a genetic predisposition to type II diabetes\nand a family history of obesity and heart disease.\n\nThose facts matter just as much as the lab tests at your doctor\u2019s office.\n\nHow so? The facts of our life story\u2014from our genetics and birth order to what\nkind of household, chaotic or alcoholic or calm or dismissive, we grew up\nin\u2014directly inform how we think, feel, and behave in our everyday adult lives.\nThey inform how we relate to food, nourish our bodies, and talk to ourselves.\nThese facts inform our exercise and sleep habits, or stress and anxiety\nbarometers, and the way we conceptualize our worthiness in the world.\n\nAnd for health to improve, we need access to these facts. Of course we need\nmedical evidence\u2014i.e., data and science\u2014too. We need to check your cholesterol\npanel and lipoprotein (a) and hemoglobin A1c and TSH and metabolic markers\u2014oh\nyes! However medical evidence doesn\u2019t stop with your BMI and LDL cholesterol\nreadings. It must include the facts of your story. Those facts need to be\nmined and explored in order to conceptualize health in a more nuanced way\u2014and\nto address your health in a way that treats you, not just your lab results.\n\nAfter all, health is mental, physical, and spiritual. It\u2019s a process, not an\noutcome. And health can only improve as our sense of agency does.\n\nAgency, however, doesn\u2019t come easy. Agency grows only when we\u2019re aware of the\nfacts first, when we accept the facts that we cannot control, then when we\nshift our energy from focusing on facts we cannot control\u2014e.g., aspects of our\npast life, or how fast our metabolism is\u2014and move that energy toward effecting\nchange in areas we can control\u2014e.g., fact-checking the stories we tell\nourselves, asking for help, redefining health as more than the number on the\nscale, and then deploying sophisticated pharmacologic agents like Ozempic,\nespecially when Weight Watchers plus self-flagellation hasn\u2019t done the trick.\n\n###\n\nBack to why Ozempic is magical, almost mystical\n\nIn essence, Ozempic is a drug that, when appropriately prescribed to the\nappropriate person, can elegantly help them more effectively engage in the\nprocess of 1) self-awareness 2) acceptance and 3) agency.\n\nAnd for people struggling with obesity, this path commonly includes an unfair\ndegree of suffering. Suffering (specifically, shame and self-doubt) is part of\nlife, however when the suffering itself becomes its own barrier to better\nhealth, it\u2019s time to address it (quite literally) head first.\n\nEven if Ozempic did not elicit weight loss, it would be, to me, the most\nimportant pharmacological intervention of our time because of its ability to\nhelp people experience a sense of agency. Its pharmacology is so elegant that\nthe mechanism of action alone is worthy of discussion.\n\nShare\n\n###\n\nHow does Ozempic work?\n\nOzempic has a few mechanisms of action. First, it helps occupy the dopamine\nreceptor in the brain. This helps people feel less compelled to overeat and\nruminate about food. In short, it helps turn the volume down on \u201cfood noise.\u201d\nThis effect is distinctly and importantly different from quieting hunger;\nOzempic helps diminish the amount of brain space that is occupied by thoughts\nand feelings about eating, food, and the complex relationship with both.\nOzempic helps with the emotional aspect around food in a unique and novel way.\n\nIn other words, Ozempic not only reduces emotional burden, it liberalizes\nprecious brain space that can be spent thinking about other, more pleasant and\nrelevant things. That reallocation of brain space is the very definition of\nagency.\n\nOzempic also helps people better regulate hunger and satiety. It helps slow\ndigestion, which helps people feel more full and, ultimately, lose weight\nwhich, for people with weight-related medical problems can be a game-changer.\nAs I\u2019ve written about, regularly experiencing satiety (e.g. the feeling of\nfullness) is essential for health. First, for the obvious reason that when our\nbrain registers fullness, it means that our body has been appropriately\nfueled. Second, satiety is essential for emotional and mental health.\nExperiencing fullness is critical for attention and focus and managing stress\nand regulating anxiety.\n\nOzempic helps insulin work more efficiently. When insulin works more\nefficiently, you process carbohydrates more effectively. For people with\ninsulin resistance\u2014that is, the problem whereby insulin doesn\u2019t work\nwell\u2014Ozempic provides the metabolic \u201cwheel-greasing\u201d that is the opposite of\ncheating; it\u2019s akin to putting on reading glasses for people who squint\nlooking at a menu.\n\n###\n\nThe upshot\n\nThe magic of Ozempic lies not in its proven benefits on metabolic\nefficiency\u2014or even in its ability to reduce the risk of diabetes, stroke,\nheart disease and dementia\u2014all of which are stunningly remarkable. Its magic\nis in its ability to give people a sense of agency they didn\u2019t think was\npossible.\n\n###\n\nThe caveats\n\nLest you think I\u2019m trolling for new patients, on the sales team for Ozempic\u2019s\nmanufacturer (Novo Nordisk), or just a total nut job, there are a lot of\ncaveats with Ozempic. It\u2019s not a panacea. To recommend Ozempic to every person\nwith weight problems or emotional distress about body image or eating or with\n\u201cfood noise\u201d would be completely unethical. It would fly in the face of the\nHippocratic Oath.\n\nIn other words, there are many people for whom Ozempic would do\u2014and is\ndoing\u2014more harm than good. For example, many of my patients need lunch\u2014not\nOzempic\u2014to experience satiety. Some need a good therapist\u2014not Ozempic\u2014to work\non body acceptance. Others need more time in their day\u2014not Ozempic\u2014in order to\ncook healthy meals to control their diabetes. Some need anti-anxiety\nmedication\u2014not Ozempic\u2014to get out of their own way.\n\nOzempic can have unpleasant and potentially dangerous side effects. It carries\nserious risk for people who struggle with restrictive eating disorders,\npancreatitis, colitis, and myriad other gastrointestinal, metabolic and\nsocial-emotional problems. Ozempic already has done great harm on a societal\nlevel. Tragically for people who need and appropriately use this drug, Ozempic\nhas generated moral outrage. It has been scorned by the fitness industry and\nby leaders within the Health At Every Size movement. It has been gate-kept by\nboth our health care system and the insurance industrial complex. It has\nbirthed a new generation of questionable drug compounders and profiteering\nprescribers. It has widened inequities between people who can afford Ozempic\nand those who cannot. It has been wildly and inappropriately misused by people\nwho conflate thinness with health.\n\nBut for those who understand Ozempic\u2019s mechanism and limitations, whose health\ngoals extend beyond achieving a number on a scale, who are fortunate to have\ntrusted guides to monitor their physical and emotional health, and whose\nhealth problems stem from the combination of unfortunate medical facts, some\nless-than-ideal habits, and a sizable serving of shame, Ozempic can be a\nwonderful tool.\n\n###\n\nWhat happens when people stop taking Ozempic?\n\nI get this question a lot. First, not everyone should stop taking Ozempic.\nChronic health conditions such as diabetes are managed longitudinally, with\nmedications adjusted as needed. Second, other than a serious adverse event due\nto the drug, there is no medical reason that a patient would have to \u201cjust\nstop\u201d taking Ozempic. Doctors can adjust the dosing, timing, and frequency of\nOzempic just as we do with other medications. Lastly, the psychological impact\nof Ozempic\u2014specifically, improved insight and self-awareness\u2014isn\u2019t something\nthat disappears after the drug is gone.\n\nAgency plus faith in what\u2019s possible are two crucial ingredients for health.\n\nTherein lies the power of Ozempic.\n\n###\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWhat\u2019s even more fascinating\u2014and, to me, lies at the intersection of\nspirituality, consciousness, and medicine\u2014is considering the multiple uses of\nOzempic for people with problems like addiction or other compulsive behavioral\nhealth problems.\n\nOf course Ozmepic is only one tool in the toolbox. However, if you\u2019re human,\nyou know first-hand that stopping an unhealthy habit is easy to talk about and\nmore difficult to execute on. To the extent Ozempic\u2019s effect on the brain is\nthat of reducing the shame and limiting the self-sabotage that accompanies our\nmost un-proud behaviors\u2014and to the extent Ozempic helps create space between\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors\u2014it is poised to begin helping more and more\npeople who struggle with issues such as alcohol overuse and nicotine\naddiction.\n\nI\u2019ll be long gone before our healthcare system prioritizes mental health,\nbefore diet culture is dead, and before Ozempic is appropriately delivered to\npeople who need it most. In the meantime, I will keep writing about the\nintersection of risk and reward, mental and physical health, medicine and\nmagic. Because none exists without the other. \ud83e\uddda\u2642\ufe0f\n\nLeave a comment\n\nIf you found this post helpful, please share it widely!

I've been using Mounjaro with\ngreat success, however, noticing on the higher doses, that my SSRI feels\nalmost ineffective with a return of panic attacks and depression. I've worked\nclosely with my psychiatrist and prescribing obesity medicine doctor, and\nwhile unusual, there are reports coming in from patients about delayed effects\nof mental health medication. Since it does delay gastric emptying and reduce\neffectiveness of birth control, I'm hoping more attention will be paid to this\nconcern in the future. I'm still using GLP medications but with a different\nperspective and strategy (scheduled intervals OFF the medication) of making\nsure while I reach my physical health goals, that my mental health stays on\ntrack as well :)Expand full commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Dr. Lucy McBride\n\n10 more comments...\n\nA Surprising Fix for Weight Gain, Digestive Woes & Skeletal Pain\n\nThere's no pill for self-compassion \ud83d\udc8a\n\nFeb 19\n\n156\n\nShare this post\n\n#### A Surprising Fix for Weight Gain, Digestive Woes & Skeletal Pain\n\nlucymcbride.substack.com\n\n36\n\nWhy Taylor Swift is Good for Your Health\n\nI got stuck in the algorithm, and I don\u2019t want out \ud83d\udc9c \ud83e\udd84\n\nMar 4 \u2022\n\nDr. Lucy McBride\n\n129\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why Taylor Swift is Good for Your Health\n\nlucymcbride.substack.com\n\n42\n\nFriday Q&A: dietary protein; holistic primary care; long COVID & Paxlovid; &\npreventing caregiver burnout\n\nGreat questions this week.
