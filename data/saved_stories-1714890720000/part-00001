The research community often relies on a\n> model's average performance across the test prompts of a benchmark to\n> evaluate the model's performance. This is consistent with the assumption\n> that the test prompts within a benchmark represent a random sample from a\n> real-world distribution of interest. We note that this is generally not the\n> case; instead, we hold that the distribution of interest varies according to\n> the specific use case. We find that (1) the correlation in model performance\n> across test prompts is non-random, (2) accounting for correlations across\n> test prompts can change model rankings on major benchmarks, (3) explanatory\n> factors for these correlations include semantic similarity and common LLM\n> failure points.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.16966 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.16966v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16966arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Charlotte Siska [view email] [v1] Thu, 25 Apr 2024 18:35:54 UTC (10,192\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Examining the robustness of LLM evaluation to\nthe distributional assumptions of benchmarks, by Melissa Ailem and Katerina\nMarazopoulou and Charlotte Siska and James Bono\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
