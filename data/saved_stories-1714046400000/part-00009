Born\nin 1732 into a second-tier Virginia family, Washington was drawn to a military\ncareer as a way to propel himself upward\u2014with ambition that bordered on the\nlunatic. By 20, he was a colonial militia leader, described as \u201ctemperamental,\nvain, thin-skinned, petulant, and awkward.\u201d He was emotionally needy and prone\nto making mistakes.\n\nThose errors caused an international uproar when Washington, acting without\norders, tracked down and attacked a small mission led by the French with no\nprovocations, slaughtering 35 French soldiers in their tents. His actions set\noff a skirmish that would become the seven-year French-Indian war.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

He\u2019d learned from\nhis hot-headed early days. \u201cHe was able to master and control some of his\npersonality from his earlier years,\u201d explains Daniel Silverman, a political\nscientist at Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy & Technology. Silverman\nand two colleagues used Washington as a case study in a paper that analyzes\nhow the age of rebel leaders impacts their success in military operations.\n\n> Young rebel leaders were the most likely to lose.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThe researchers assessed the careers and wars fought by 425 rebel leaders\nthroughout history and around the world and found some major themes: Young\nrebel leaders were the most likely to lose, middle-aged rebels were most\nlikely to find military success, and older rebels were most likely to reach\nnegotiated settlements.\n\nRebels are generally weaker than the governments they\u2019re fighting, Silverman\npoints out, which means they have to be creative. \u201cYou need to know how to\npick your battles, how to take advantage of opportunities,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s\na lot of decision making and marshaling resources instead of going for a\nmaximum brute force approach, as you could if you were more powerful.\u201d\n\nThe results point to a few universal truths about age and maturity\u2014especially\nfor men, as all but one of the leaders in the study were male. Young men can\nbe prone to hot-headed behavior, especially in situations where they are\nprovoked and need more common sense and patience. On the other end of the\nspectrum, age and wisdom can go together, Silverman says.\n\nYoung men between the ages of 15 and 30 commit the most acts of criminal and\npolitical violence around the globe, which the authors attribute to\ntestosterone, which peaks in males in their mid 20s and falls off afterward.\nThat puts young men at a disadvantage as rebel leaders, where restraint is\nmore important than impulsivity. Older leaders, they argue, are more likely to\nsee the bigger picture in their actions, and are better able to regulate their\nemotions.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

She also notes that the\noutcome is aggregated\u2014focused on the final winners instead of looking at\nindividual rebel events. \u201cI would be interested to see data on actual battle\noutcomes,\u201d she says, \u201crather than war end outcomes to compare young leaders to\nother leaders.\u201d\n\nSilverman says that while age matters in the context of rebel leaders, it can\nbe overridden by other factors: The context of the conflict is important, of\ncourse. Some research has shown that if a leader starts a conflict rather than\ninheriting it from someone else, they are more likely to cling to it and not\ncompromise, no matter their age.\n\nIn Washington\u2019s later years, he was insistent on treating British POWs\nhumanely and avoiding theft from and harm to local farmers, even while his\nsoldiers were starving. This restraint, gained from age, ultimately won him\nclear-eyed victory, as well as a storied place in history.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
