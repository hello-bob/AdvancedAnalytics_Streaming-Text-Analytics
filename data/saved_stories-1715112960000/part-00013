Today, the company is building foundation models for autonomy, similar to a \u2018GPT for driving,\u2019 that can empower any vehicle to see, think, and drive through any environment.\n  * This investment supports Wayve in fully developing and launching the first Embodied AI products for production vehicles. As Wayve\u2019s core AI model advances, these products will enable OEMs to efficiently upgrade cars to higher levels of driving automation, from L2+ assisted driving to L4 automated driving.\n\nWayve, the market leader in Embodied artificial intelligence (AI) for\nautonomous driving, is thrilled to announce the successful closure of $1.05\nbillion in Series C funding. This round was led by SoftBank Group\n(\u201cSoftBank\u201d), with contributions from new investor NVIDIA and existing\ninvestor Microsoft. This investment will accelerate Wayve\u2019s mission to\nreimagine autonomous mobility through embodied intelligence.\n\nEmbodied AI represents the next frontier of AI innovation, going beyond\nGenerative AI and large language models. The integration of Embodied AI into\nvehicles and robots will lead to a paradigm shift in how machines interact\nwith and learn from human behavior in real-world environments. This innovation\nholds tremendous potential to enhance the usability and safety of autonomous\ndriving systems, empowering them with the intelligence to confidently navigate\nsituations that do not follow strict patterns or rules, such as unexpected\nactions by drivers, pedestrians, or environmental elements.\n\nFounded in 2017, Wayve has emerged as a trailblazer in the field of Embodied\nAI for autonomous driving. Notably, Wayve was the first to develop and test an\nend-to-end (e2e) AI autonomous driving system on public roads. This pioneering\neffort paved the way for an industry-wide shift towards AI, coined \u2018AV2.0\u2019.\nThrough their long-standing work, Wayve has successfully developed foundation\nmodels for autonomy, similar to a \u2018GPT for driving,\u2019 that can empower any\nvehicle to perceive its surroundings and safely drive through diverse\nenvironments.\n\nThe integration of Embodied AI into vehicles and robots will lead to a\nparadigm shift in how machines interact with and learn from human behavior in\nreal-world environments.\n\nWayve has dedicated years of extensive research and development to\nestablishing itself as the market leader in AV2.0. They have developed\nhardware-agnostic AI driving models for mapless autonomous driving and a suite\nof innovative technologies, such as fleet learning, data infrastructure,\nevaluation, and simulation platforms designed to rapidly enhance their AI\nmodels using real-world and simulated data.\n\nBy leveraging Wayve\u2019s advanced proprietary tools, OEMs and fleet owners can\ngenerate valuable data assets that bridge the gap between raw data and\nunparalleled driving capabilities. Moreover, the company\u2019s research on\nmultimodal and generative models, known as LINGO and GAIA, is driving the\nautomotive industry towards a future where AI in vehicles can offer advanced\nfeatures like intuition, language-responsive interfaces, personalized driving\nstyles, and co-piloting to enhance the automated driving experience.\n\nAlex Kendall, Co-founder and CEO of Wayve: \u201cAt Wayve, our vision is to develop\nautonomous technology that not only becomes a reality in millions of vehicles\nbut also earns people\u2019s trust by seamlessly integrating into their everyday\nlives to unlock extraordinary value. This significant funding milestone\nhighlights our team\u2019s unwavering conviction that Embodied AI will address the\nlong-standing challenges the industry has faced in scaling this technology to\neveryone, everywhere.\n\nOur collaboration with SoftBank, NVIDIA, and Microsoft will help advance our\nmission to redefine driving with AI at the core. This investment will enable\nus to develop and launch our first Embodied AI products for the automotive\nindustry, empowering OEMs to provide consumers with trustworthy and beneficial\nautomated driving experiences.\u201d\n\nKentaro Matsui, Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, Head of the\nNew Business Office at SoftBank Group and Board Member at Wayve: \u201cAI is\nrevolutionizing mobility. Vehicles can now interpret their surroundings like\nhumans, enabling enhanced decision-making that promises higher safety\nstandards. The potential of this type of technology is transformative; it\ncould eliminate 99% of traffic accidents. SoftBank Group is delighted to be at\nthe forefront of this effort with Wayve, as advanced intelligence redefines\nmobility and connectivity, contributing to a more convenient and safer\nsociety.\u201d\n\nRishi Dhall, Vice President of Automotive Business at NVIDIA: \u201cWayve is\npioneering new AI applications for their next-generation AV2.0 approach, built\non NVIDIA DRIVE Orin and DRIVE Thor, which uses the new NVIDIA Blackwell\narchitecture designed for transformer, LLM, and Generative AI workloads.\nTogether, we can help enable self-driving vehicles that deliver the\nintelligence, dependability, and skill of the best human drivers.\u201d\n\nDominik Wee, Corporate Vice President of Manufacturing and Mobility at\nMicrosoft: \u201cMicrosoft is pleased to be working with Wayve to develop and\ndeploy Wayve\u2019s end-to-end AI autonomous driving products for automotive\nenterprise customers. By utilizing Microsoft\u2019s supercomputing capabilities and\ncloud computing technology, copilot-enabled developer platform, enterprise\ndata management applications, and leading AI model commercialization\nexpertise, Wayve can deliver and scale innovative Embodied AI solutions that\nenable safer and more accessible autonomous driving experiences.\u201d\n\n### This Series C investment enables Wayve to fully develop and launch the\nfirst Embodied AI products for production vehicles.\n\nWayve\u2019s hardware-agnostic, mapless product solutions allow OEMs to efficiently\nsoftware upgrade cars to higher levels of driving automation (from \u2018eyes on\u2019\nassisted driving to \u2018eyes off\u2019 fully automated driving) as Wayve\u2019s AI models\nprogress. The company will also focus on scaling its foundation models,\nadvancing Embodied AI research, and building an industry-leading AV2.0\nPlatform with reliable simulation, measurement, and active learning tools for\nautomotive applications.
