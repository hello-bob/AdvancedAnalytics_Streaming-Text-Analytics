On the other hand, wouldn\u2019t we be better off dealing with\nmore interfaces, each adapted to specific demands?\n\nPhone calls, for example, are a more humane and more efficient way to fix\nmisunderstandings. E-mail, board discussions, well-made e-commerce sites...\nall this fell into disuse or lost ground for text balloons and groups on\nWhatsApp (or iMessage if you\u2019re in the US).\n\n\u00ab Android features I'm envy of as an iPhone user\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter:\n\nRodrigo Ghedin is a Brazilian journalist covering consumer tech for a small,\nindependent publication called Manual do Usu\u00e1rio.
