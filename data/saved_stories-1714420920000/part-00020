(Utrecht\nUniversity)\n\nFor the first time, researchers have simulated neurological junctions called\nsynapses using the same water and salt ingredients the brain uses,\ncontributing to an emerging field that combines biology with electronics\ncalled iontronics.\n\nThe team from Utrecht University in the Netherlands and Sogang University in\nSouth Korea claim to have been inspired by the functioning of the human brain,\nwhich also uses charged particles called ions dissolved in water to transmit\nsignals within neurons.\n\nAn important feature of the brain's ability to process information is synaptic\nplasticity, which allows neurons to adjust the strength of connections between\nthem in response to input history.\n\nCalled an iontronic memristor, the device 'remembers' how much electrical\ncharge has previously flowed through it, bringing us closer to generating\nartificial systems capable of mimicking the superpowers of the human brain.\n\nA graphical representation of the new synapse. (Utrecht University)\n\n\"It represents a crucial advancement toward computers not only capable of\nmimicking the communication patterns of the human brain but also utilizing the\nsame medium,\" says theoretical physicist Tim Kamsma from Utrecht University.\n\nShaped like a cone with a solution of water and salt inside, the iontronic\nmemristor measures just 150 by 200 micrometers \u2013 the width of about three or\nfour human hairs side-by-side. Electrical impulses cause ions to move through\nthe cone-shaped channel, with variations in the electrical charge leading to\nvariations in the ion movement. The change in how the synapse conducts\nelectricity can be measured and decoded to understand what the input signal\nwas, representing a kind of memory.\n\nA microscopic picture of the artificial synapse. (Kamsma et al., PNAS, 2024)\n\nIt's still very early stages for the device, and for iontronics in general.\nYet the way the length of the channel affects the memory retention duration of\nthe memristor already suggests channels could be tailored for specific tasks,\nmuch like they are in the brain. The physicists also want to see how these\nsynthetic synapses could be combined in different ways.\n\nBeing relatively quick and cheap to produce, the new design could be scaled\nfor a range of future applications.\n\n\"While artificial synapses capable of processing complex information already\nexist based on solid materials, we now show for the first time that this feat\ncan also be accomplished using water and salt,\" says Kamsma.\n\n\"We are effectively replicating neuronal behavior using a system that employs\nthe same medium as the brain.\"\n\nThe hope is that by following the blueprint provided by the brain so\nfaithfully, rather than relying on traditional electrical processes and\ncomponents, we'll be able to get close to the capacity and the efficiency of\nthe brain with our own computers.\n\nFor the researchers, it's also a powerful example of how theoretical and\nexperimental physics can be combined to break new scientific ground \u2013 giving\nthe team a 'wow' factor moment when the artificial synapse was created.\n\n\"I thought wow!\" says Kamsma. \"It's incredibly gratifying to witness the\ntransition from theoretical conjecture to tangible real world outcomes,\nultimately resulting in these beautiful experimental results.\"\n\nThe research has been published in PNAS.\n\nTrending News\n\nCommon Blood Pressure Drug Increases Lifespan And Slows Aging in Animals\nHealth2 days ago\n\nCannabis Use Linked to Epigenetic Changes, Study Reveals Health3 days ago\n\nIt's Official: Scientists Finally Confirmed What's Inside The Moon Space6 days\nago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
