Drezner\n\nreviews two new and very interesting looking books (one by\n\nHenry Farrell\n\nwho\u2019s also here on\n\nSubstack Writers\n\n####\n\nThe New Empires of the Internet Age (link)\n\n> \u201cIn Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy, Henry\n> Farrell and Abraham Newman posit that the United States still wields a\n> considerable amount of structural power in the global system. Anu Bradford\u2019s\n> Digital Empires: The Global Battle to Regulate Technology, however, argues\n> that the surprising superpower is neither the United States nor China but\n> the European Union.\n>\n> Both books examine the exercise of power and governance in the digital\n> sphere. Their contrasting evaluations help explain why it is so difficult\n> for even the sharpest observers of global affairs to agree about the current\n> state of the world\u2014particularly when technology is involved.\u201d (more via link\n> above).\n\nSometimes you can squeeze without being seen to squeeze: internet choke points\nrunning through the US give it leverage in ways that are hard to recognise\nunless you really know what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nA cruder intervention is the following: \u2018Russian intelligence agents\nreportedly went to Ireland to inspect undersea cables, and it's reigniting\nfears they could cut them and take entire countries offline\u2019. Hmm. It appears\nthat \u2018Three-quarters of all cables in the northern hemisphere pass through or\nnear Irish waters, most of them off the southwest coast.\u2019 Not good for a\ncountry with a pivotal north Atlantic position, a huge tech sector, and an\ninadequate naval service.\n\n####\n\nThe Coddling of the American Parent\n\nExcellent read about our latest moral panic: it\u2019s the phones (this time)! Do\nyou remember all that \u2018parental advisory\u2019 stuff on CDs, imposed by people in\ntheir 50s holding very serious opinions in the early 1990s? What difference\ndid a parental advisory sticker make? It increased the transgressive value of\nsaid music, and little else. Or do you recall the previous nuttiness about\naudible satanic messages available if you played your vinyl records backwards?\nI have yet to hear anyone saying this about the widespread availability 2020s\nversion of vinyl: I guess the song remains the same*, even if the lyrical\nfocus moves on to the new shiny thing that seemingly ails us.\n\nSee also in Nature: The great rewiring: is social media really behind an\nepidemic of teenage mental illness? The evidence is equivocal on whether\nscreen time is to blame for rising levels of teen depression and anxiety \u2014 and\nrising hysteria could distract us from tackling the real causes. By Candice L.\nOdgers\n\nAnd another: Social media bans don\u2019t address youth mental health problems\n\nWe have the classic syllogism being deployed at scale:\n\n> \u2018something must be done about problem x; this is something; therefore we\n> must do this\u2019.\n\n* Yes, they were accused of promoting satanic messages...\n\nShare\n\n####\n\nCognitive dissonnance for illiberals\n\n> \u201c...all contemporary illiberal movements face a fundamental problem: the\n> illiberal\u2019s dilemma. On the one hand, everybody wants what modern prosperity\n> offers\u2014power, comfort, security, wealth. On the other hand, illiberals\n> reject what makes modern prosperity possible\u2014freedom, diversity, the\n> continual churn of change.\u201d Source\n\nIf you want to know what this latter choice felt like in a western democracy,\ngive this brilliant book a blast: Preventing the Future: Why was Ireland so\npoor for so long? (published in 2004; it concerns Ireland\u2019s inward-looking,\nconversative experiment from the late 1920s to the late 1950s; here\u2019s a review\nwhich says \u2018Ireland\u2019s failure to participate in the \u201cgolden era\u201d of post-war\neconomic growth was because two powerful players, the Catholic Church and\nEamon de Valera\u2019s Fianna F\u00e1il party did not want a modern economy with the\nthreats to traditional morality that that would entail\u2019).\n\nGet 20% off a group subscription\n\n####\n\nEcology and the internet\n\nInteresting and challenging essay by Maria Farrell, opening with a description\nof the problems of internet monoculture:\n\n> We Need To Rewild The Internet: The internet has become an extractive and\n> fragile monoculture. But we can revitalize it using lessons learned by\n> ecologists.\n\n####\n\nSalience Network\n\nThe Salience Network is a new section here on the Brain Pizza substack,\nexclusively for paid subscribers. The title is a loose play on the brain\u2019s\n\u2018salience network\u2019 which monitors striking external inputs as well as internal\nbrain events, with a key role in identifying important biological and\ncognitive events. You'll find lots of extra material beyond the paid and free\nregular newsletter, all examined through a psychology and neuroscience lens.\nFirst piece up later this week.\n\n  * Sign up for a paid subscription: lots of content, archival access\n\n  * BrainPizza: bringing you the finest in psychology and neuroscience blogging.\n\n####\n\nIllusory conversation\n\n> The LLMentalist Effect: how chat-based Large Language Models replicate the\n> mechanisms of a psychic\u2019s con\n\nI've previously referred to this as being fooled by an \u2018illusory\nconversation\u2019.\n\n####\n\nRoman Emperor: from behind \u2018the desk\u2019\n\nI\u2019m about a third of the way onto this magnificent beast of a book. Mary Beard\nneeds to be here on\n\nSubstack Writers\n\n.\n\nHere's a pic I took April 20219 of JC's grave\n\nOne thing that strikes me forcefully is how inadequate the frameworks we have\nfrom psychology and neuroscience are for understanding how and why people do\nwhat they do in the circumstances they found themselves in exercising power\nand generally trying to survive in these most extreme of circumstances where\nbetrayal is everywhere and life is fleeting. At certain times, Roman Emperors\nturned over quickly, staying in office for very short periods, and ended their\ntime under the sword.\n\nWhy would anyone want this perilous position? I don't know \ud83d\ude15, but the story as\nBeard tells it is enthralling: it is a \u2018new way of seeing the Roman empire\u2019.\n\nSmall extra story: we visited the Roman forum a few years ago, and there were\nplenty of fresh flowers at the supposed cremation site of Julius Caesar at the\nthe Temple of Caesar. Seems this is a continuing activity there: 2000 years\nlater.\n\n####\n\nEffective Altruism\n\nAbsolutely killer article on effective altruism - a banger from start to\nfinish. It\u2019s an intellectual and moral scam: life is very complicated, despite\ngood intentions. Interesting that\n\nScott Barry Kaufman\n\nhas a new paper out: \u2018Healthy Selfishness and Pathological Altruism: Measuring\nTwo Paradoxical Forms of Selfishness\u2019. This paper examines healthy selfishness\n(HS) and pathological altruism (PA), which have not been widely studied\nbefore. HS was linked to higher psychological well-being and adaptive\nfunctioning, while PA was associated with negative psychological outcomes and\nselfish motivations for helping others. I guess SBF might fall into the\npathologically-altruistic category?
