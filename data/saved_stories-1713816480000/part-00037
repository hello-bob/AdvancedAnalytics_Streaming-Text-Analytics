Meanwhile, these creatures are kept in harsh,\ncrowded conditions and slaughtered inhumanely. The close confinement and\nunsanitary conditions on factory farms can breed zoonotic diseases and\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\n#### Related\n\nTaking Aim at Animal Research \u2014 From the Right\n\nWhat\u2019s more, scientists tell us that eliminating animal products from our\nplates is one of the best things we can do as individuals to mitigate climate\nchange and other environmental threats.\n\nAmid this moral, environmental, and public health catastrophe, meat industry\ntechnologists are proposing precision livestock farming, or PLF, as a\nsolution. PLF is the use of digital tools to continuously monitor livestock\nparameters, offering precise information about farmed animals in real-time.\n\nPLF is a small but rapidly growing field. Although these tools have been\naround since the early 2000s, 65 percent of all literature on the matter was\npublished in the past five years alone. Improvements in sensor technology and\nthe computing power to interpret the sensors\u2019 output are responsible for this.\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, in particular has given rise to many new PLF\napplications. Still, the reality of AI on farms, for now at least, is more\nmundane than what some may imagine: fewer robots, more surveillance cameras\nand buzzing sensors.\n\nWe are a group of university students, advocates, and scientists affiliated\nwith the nonprofit Allied Scholars for Animal Protection. With calls to\ndrastically reduce or eliminate meat, dairy, and egg consumption from many\nscientists and animal advocacy groups such as ours, the livestock industry is\nscrambling for ways to improve its public image.\n\n###### Get Our Newsletter\n\nSent Weekly\n\nThe meat industry often uses exaggeration and greenwashing to assuage public\nconcern. For example, \u201cregenerative\u201d or lower-carbon agricultural practices\nhave received much hype, despite the fact that the most sustainable way to\nproduce meat is to not produce it at all. PLF, touted for its supposed\nbenefits to animal welfare, human health, and the environment, may be the meat\nindustry\u2019s next marketing ploy.\n\nConveniently for the industry, PLF tools achieve all of these changes by\nincreasing production efficiency. For example, precision nutrition\ntechnologies purport to give animals optimized, individualized diets, thus\nreducing food waste.\n\nMeanwhile, physical afflictions can be ameliorated via automated systems that\nadjust indoor conditions in response to signs of animal distress. Sickness can\nhurt farm output by slowing animals\u2019 growth, so disease detection systems\ncould improve efficiency by obviating the need for costly clinical testing.\n\n> PLF, touted for its supposed benefits to animal welfare, human health, and\n> the environment, may be the meat industry\u2019s next marketing ploy.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, though, that illness and misery do not seem to have\nbeen much of an impediment to production in the past. Respiratory illness is\ncommonplace among farmed pigs, and bodily mutilations without pain relief are\nstandard practice. It would be hard for factory farms to do worse on animal\nwelfare than currently, but it is unlikely that incremental technological\nimprovements will yield anything that could reasonably be described as humane.\n\nWe would be remiss not to mention emotion-monitoring systems, intended to\ncapture animals\u2019 affective states and enable adjustments to improve welfare\nconditions. Once commercial options become available, they would likely be\nmarketed as husbandry practices that maximize animal \u201chappiness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisements that such tools herald a revolution in farm animal welfare miss\nthe obvious point that no farm animal will ever be happy living their life in\na tiny crate.\n\nIt seems more likely that industry insiders, who for decades have used bogus\ncertifications labeling their products as \u201chumane\u201d to distract the public from\ntheir abuses, will use PLF as yet another means to delude the public about\nwhere their food comes from. There is no universal standard for assessing\nanimal welfare, so the meat industry enjoys ample room for exaggeration.\n\n> Even the worst-performing plant-based diet has a lower impact on land and\n> climate than the best diet that includes animal products.\n\nIt is plainly inaccurate to frame PLF as a net positive for farmed animals.\nPLF methods will only be implemented when they benefit the animal slaughter\nindustry by increasing efficiency and bolstering production. In perpetuating\nthe exploitation of animals, PLF fundamentally opposes their best interests.\n\nPutting ethics aside, there are many reasons why the end of large-scale animal\nfarming is crucial for the future of our planet. For example, global adoption\nof a plant-based diet could reduce agricultural land use by about 75 percent.\n\nInstead of reforming animal agriculture, the world should move away from a\nfood system based on animal products. Even the worst-performing plant-based\ndiet has a lower impact on land and climate than the best diet that includes\nanimal products. This shouldn\u2019t be too surprising, given that animal\nagriculture currently accounts for 80 percent of global farmland but only\nproduces 17 percent of calories.\n\nAs consumers, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed by the scale of global problems\nand our limited ability to make a difference. When it comes to what\u2019s on our\nplates, though, the benefits of opting for plant-based diets are clear: better\npublic health, a more livable climate, and better lives for our fellow\ncreatures. Incremental tweaks to animal agriculture through PLF are misleading\nto consumers and do not get us to the world we need.\n\nShann Chongwattananukul, Benny Smith, and Dr. Faraz Harsini work with Allied\nScholars for Animal Protection, a U.S.-based nonprofit founded by Dr. Harsini\nthat focuses on animal advocacy and educates university students on\nsustainable food systems.
