The toxin has been\nlinked to the above health effects in adults and children\n\n  * Copy link to paste in your message\n\nThe majority of toxic chemicals were found in the seat foam in 99 percent of\nthe vehicles studied\n\nResearchers analyzed 101 cars across the US and tested about half of the\nvehicles in both the summer and winter and found that the higher temperatures\ncaused higher flame-retardant concentrations, according to the study published\nin the Environmental Science and Technology journal.\n\n#### Read More\n\n#### Having two copies of the 'Chris Hemsworth' gene makes you 99% likely to\nget dementia\n\nThe amount of TCIPP in the summer was two to five times higher compared to\nwinter because of what's called off-gassing - when the gas containing\nchemicals that was absorbed in materials is released into the air.\n\nThey also analyzed samples of the seat foam from half of the cars and found\nthat those containing TCIPP had higher concentrations of the chemical in the\nair.\n\nThe average person spends about an hour in a car per day, making the findings\n'particularly concerning for drivers with longer commutes as well as child\npassengers, who breathe more air pound for pound than adults,' said Rebecca\nHoehn, the study's lead author and a scientist at Duke University.\n\nInfants and children are also considered to be more vulnerable because they're\ntransported to and from schools, doctor's appointments and childcare,\naccording to the study.\n\nIt revealed that increased exposure to the toxic chemicals could reduce a\nchild's IQ levels by three to five points because it interferes with the\nthyroid which emits brain-developing hormones.\n\nExposure to the toxins at a young age could lead to a child developing\nlearning disabilities, autism and behavioral issues.\n\nCar manufacturers have continued to inject harmful chemicals into cars\nincluding tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and tris\n(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) which have been linked to neurological and\nreproductive issues.\n\nThe chemicals have also been labeled as two Proposition 65 carcinogens by the\nCalifornia government because they can cause cancer.\n\n  * Copy link to paste in your message\n\nChildren are more at risk because they breathe in more air pound for pound\nthan adults. Increased levels of flame-retardant chemicals can cause\nchildren's IQ levels to drop by three to five points\n\nThe researchers also referenced a separate research paper that revealed people\nwith the highest levels of flame-retardant chemicals in their blood had four\ntimes greater risk of dying from cancer than those who had low levels.\n\n'Firefighters are concerned that flame retardants contribute to their very\nhigh cancer rates,' said Patrick Morrison, who oversees Health and Safety for\n350,000 U.S. and Canadian firefighters at the International Association of\nFire Fighters.\n\n'Filling products with these harmful chemicals does little to prevent fires\nfor most uses and instead makes the blazes smokier and more toxic for victims,\nand especially for first responders.'\n\nA 1975 law that required all furniture manufacturers, including automakers, to\nadd flame-retardant chemicals to upholstered furniture, which has since been\ndisbanded.\n\nIn 2013, lawmakers found that the typical sofa produced two to three pounds of\ncancer-causing chemicals which were also linked to reproductive issues.\n\nThe following year, a new flame-retardant law was implemented that removed the\nneed for the chemicals to be injected into upholstered products but didn't ban\nthe chemicals from being used.\n\nUp until the early 2000s, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were used in\nfurniture, vehicles and electronics, but when scientists linked it to\ncognitive developmental and reproductive issues, it became restricted.\n\nHowever, automakers found ways around it by using non-restricted flame-\nretardants like the TCIPP to comply with flammability standards even though\nthey still carry major health risks.\n\nThe study said the harmful effects of using the chemicals in furniture was\nstudied extensively but evidence of exposure from personal vehicles is still\nrelatively understudied.\n\nMore studies need to be conducted to determine the exact types of flame-\nretardant chemicals that are injected into manufactured vehicles and what\nlevels humans are exposed to.\n\nThe researchers said there are ways to mitigate the risk of exposure such as\nopening your windows or parking in the shade, 'but what's really needed is\nreducing the amount of flame retardants being added to cars in the first\nplace,' said co-author Lydia Jahl, a senior scientist at the Green Science\nPolicy Institute.\n\n'Commuting to work shouldn't come with a cancer risk,' she added, 'and\nchildren shouldn't breathe in chemicals that can harm their brains on their\nway to school.'\n\nCaliforniaCancer\n\n### Share or comment on this article: 99% of cars sold in US between 2015 and\n2022 expose passengers to toxin linked to cancer and autism, study warns\n\n  * e-mail\n  * 9\n\nshares\n\n  * Add comment\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * Download our iPhone app\n  * Download our Android app\n\n  * Today's headlines\n  * Most Read\n\n  * Alexander the Great's bathroom is discovered after 2,300 years: Archaeologists uncover a room in Greece...\n  * What would happen if you fell into a black hole?
