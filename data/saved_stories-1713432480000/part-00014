By aiming for smaller details, cameras and other detectors\nneeded to become more sensitive and less noisy due to less available photons\nper resolvable detail. Sensitivity was mostly improved by using higher\nlight/laser power and increasing the quality of fluorescent markers; but the\ndrawback of investing more light (or using short-wavelength with higher\nenergy) is that, particularly when looking at living organisms, large amounts\nof phototoxic side products are created which degrade and eventually kill the\norganism. This makes it hard to say whether the observation is taking place at\na healthy time point or at a decaying state.\n\nOne way to circumvent this problem came in 1990 with 2-photon laser scanning\nmicroscopy, which \u2013 back then \u2013 was meant to replace single-photon confocal\nmicroscopy (Denk et al., 1990). In principle, the use of near-infrared and\ninfrared wavelengths could penetrate much deeper into a sample and was gentler\nto it (when compared with excitation using shorter wavelengths) as there was\nless phototoxicity. However, the cost was an almost prohibitively expensive\nTitanium-Sapphire laser which has only barely decreased in price today.\nFurthermore, as 2-photon laser scanning microscopy is a scanning technique,\nthe acquisition is very slow \u2013 or if fast, very noisy. Large samples take\nhours to acquire and the only way to increase speed is to make smaller regions\nand restrict the field of view.\n\nThe new player is light sheet fluorescence microscopy, an illumination\napproach orthogonal to the detection that allows for a single plane\nillumination. This was first introduced by Richard Zsigmondy and Henry\nSiedentopf in 1903 using a slit-based system when they were working for Carl\nZeiss. They called it the Ultramicroscope, and regrettably, it was soon\nforgotten.\n\nIt was reintroduced by Voie and colleagues in 1993 as a technique for\northogonal plane fluorescence sectioning (OPFOS), but the idea wasn\u2019t really\npicked up by the scientific community until 2004 when Ernst Stelzer and\ncolleagues refined the idea and built a new light sheet microscope called SPIM\n(Single Plane Illumination Microscopy). Both revivals used a cylindrical lens\nsystem to generate the light sheet improving its quality. They began by\nimaging embryonic development in animals and quickly adapted it to include the\nworld of plants and nowadays even histopathology samples.\n\n## Technology In Brief\n\nThe main aim of light sheet microscopy is imaging a large sample with short\ntime intervals under healthier conditions over longer periods (e.g. days) than\ncompared to conventional types of microscopy or using the single plane\nillumination to improve single-molecule imaging (FCS, TIRF).\n\nLooking closely at the illumination of a widefield microscope we notice that\nthe sample which is placed in the plane of focus \u2013 where the energy of the\nexcitation beam is the highest \u2013 is also excited above and below the focus\n(Fig.1A). The sample is moved to various planes of focus to acquire a z-stack\nand by this, the researcher obtains 3D information about the structures of\ninterest and relation to secondary structures. If this was performed in a live\ncell experiment, planes above, in and below the focus would be exposed\nconstantly which is detrimental to the sample. Aside from photobleaching,\nphototoxic side effects will cause the sample to be in non-physiological and\nlater in apoptotic conditions, resulting in at least in extensive photodamage\nand even cell death.\n\nOne could assume that using a point scanning device such as a confocal\nmicroscope would improve the situation as only individual points are excited.\nThis is not the case because the beam, a) needs to be focused onto a certain\npoint and thereby will also above and below the point of focus, and b) as the\nbeam resides only briefly at each individual point, a much higher laser power\nis required which in turn causes even more damage to the sample (Fig. 1B/C).\n\nFigure 1: Beam distribution within a sample. A) Widefield microscopy \u2013 the\nbeam is illuminating the entire sample above and below the plane of focus. B)\nA confocal beam is illuminating the sample only partially but needs to be\nscanned C) and is of a higher power. D) The theoretical layout of a light\nsheet system, where the excitation beam is placed perpendicular to the imaging\naxis. (Adapted from Brad Amos, Cambridge)\n\nOne solution is to create a beam that is parallel to the focal plane (Fig.\n1D). Above and below the plane of focus there is no excitation, and hence no\nadditional negative effects in the out-of-focus planes. Rather than having a\nGaussian beam profile, the beam is shaped by a cylindrical lens creating a\nsheet of light at and around the point of focus. The cylindrical lens\nmaintains the round Gaussian beam\u2019s profile in one dimension but compresses it\nin the other, as seen in Fig.2.\n\nFigure 2: Cylindrical lens. Light passing through the cylindrical lens will\nretain its width but is condensed in height and hence flattened. Image from\nEdmund Optics.\n\nThe light sheet allows the system to be designed in a way that only the sample\nplane in the focus of the imaging lens is illuminated. The emitted light is\npicked up by the imaging lens and detected by a camera. In terms of imaging,\nthis has multiple benefits. Firstly, a single plane can be acquired in one\nquick snap due to multiplexing with the pixel array of the camera (benefit of\nthe widefield system), and secondly, by illuminating one plane and avoiding\nexciting too much the planes above and below the imaging plane, the signal-to-\nbackground is improved (benefit of confocal in the z-axis). A light sheet\ndiagram is shown in Fig.3.\n\nFigure 3: A light sheet microscopy imaging setup. The sample (clear barrel) is\nilluminated with a light sheet from the side (perpendicular to the objective),\nexciting fluorophores in the 2D focal plane. The light sheet is hourglass-\nshaped and the thinnest section is used to illuminate the sample. At 90\u00b0 to\nthis illumination is the objective lens, which sends emitted fluorescence to\nthe detector camera.\n\nIn most light sheet systems, the majority of the optical components remain\nstatic while imaging. To obtain an image in 3D, the sample needs to be moved\nacross the light sheet (other variations using adaptive optics sweep the sheet\nin XYZ across the sample). This is usually achieved by the movement of the\nsample holder which is a 3D- (XYZ) or 4D-stage (XYZ\u03b8, where \u03b8 is rotation).\nThe movement in XYZ allows imaging of larger samples which can be larger than\nthe already large FOV, which will require stitching in post-processing. The\nrotation gives access to the sample from multiple angles which can then be\nfused together. Because of this fusion process, the image will gain quality\nbecause the resolution will improve (see below for details).\n\nApart from that, there is a massive time benefit to be gained by this\napproach. Scanning a comparably sized sample on a confocal over minutes to\nhours can be reduced on a light sheet system to seconds and minutes. As\nmentioned before, phototoxic side effects are highly reduced by a factor of\nbetween 20-100x. And this is the main goal of light sheet microscopy: Image\nunder physiological conditions for much longer and obtain more relevant data\nin live-cell experiments.\n\n## Light Sheet Optics\n\nTo obtain a sheet of light, a wide Gaussian beam needs to be converted to a\nsheet. When a beam is sent through a lens it will converge to the point of\nfocus and diverge from there (Fig. 5). The numerical aperture (NA) is of\nspecial importance as it determines the strength of convergence and\ndivergence, and thereby the usable field of view (FOV), as seen in Fig.4.\n\nFigure 4: Variation in FOV in two light sheets. The arrow indicates the\ndirection of the excitation beam. The width of the sheet dependent on the NA\nof the light sheet lens. As the \u2018waist\u2019 of the light sheet is the section to\nexcite the sample, the widt of this area is paramount, with beam waist width\nshown by \u03c90. FOV is shown by b. A wider beam (left image) results in a larger\nFOV but less specific excitation. A thinner beam (right) has very specific\nexcitation but a small FOV and a rapid decay in intensity on the opposite\nside.\n\nTwo important distinctions need to be made regarding the depth of focus. If\nthe NA of the imaging lens is very high it may be the determining factor for\nthe depth of focus (in case the sheet is thicker than this). However, if the\nNA of the imaging lens is low the sheet is much thinner than the depth of\nfocus and will thereby improve the signal to noise as only objects from within\nfocus will be excited. Researchers in light sheet microscopy often strive to\ncreate the \u2018thinnest\u2019 or \u2018ultrathin\u2019 light sheet.\n\nThe simplest way to achieve a sheet of light is by introducing a cylindrical\nlens (very low NA) into the light path to create a 1D sheet. By focusing this\npre-shaped beam onto the back-focal plane of the illumination objective, the\nsheet will be created at the focal point of this objective. The imaging\nobjective is then placed perpendicular to the illumination objective and\nfocused on the sheet.\n\nTheoretically \u2013 using a Gaussian beam, cylindrical lens and a high NA (1.4)\nillumination objective \u2013 a light sheet of thickness 0.24 \u03bcm is possible, but\nlimited in usability as it would only have a depth of focus of 0.17 \u03bcm. On the\nother hand, a 10x/0.3NA water immersion lens would have a thickness of 1.1 \u03bcm\nwith a depth of focus of 3.7 \u03bcm. Due to the nature of the system, this sheet\nwill converge and diverge massively. Ernst Stelzer introduced a rule-of-thumb\nwhich is now well accepted in the field, which states that the usable width\n(b) of the sheet is maximal until it reaches twice the diameter of the waist\n(2\u03c90). By artificially lowering the NA it is possible to achieve a thicker\nsheet that remains parallel over a longer distance. This allows a larger field\nof view to be exposed. Typically, this can reach up to 1 mm in length and will\nhave a thickness of 8 \u03bcm, at which point the imaging objective will\npotentially determine the depth of field and axial resolution.\n\nNew light sheet technologies often revolve around novel ways in which to\ngenerate a light sheet, including lattice light sheet and tiling light sheet,\nboth discussed in their own application notes in our light sheet section.\n\n## Sample Preparation\n\nBefore researchers decide to perform light sheet microscopy, they should\nconsider how to mount their sample in the most sensible way, because this will\ninfluence which light sheet configuration they will eventually have to use.\n\n#### Live Samples\n\nTo enable live-cell imaging, samples must be immersed in some form of culture\nmedium which requires objectives to be at least water dipping lenses. In order\nto retain the sample in its position, it has to be restrained. There are\nvarious options available, but it all comes down to the creativity of the\nresearcher and the sample\u2019s demands, as long as the mount is optically\ntransparent, allows gas exchange (if necessary) and provides enough physical\nsupport to immobilize the living sample.\n\nFigure 5: Examples of sample mounting. A) Zebrafish embryo immobilized in\nAgarose. B) Tissue/organ on a hook. C) Spheroids in a PTFE cup. D) An adherent\ncell on a coverslip. Adapted from Reynaud et al. (2015)\n\nInitially, samples such as zebrafish were mounted by using a gel matrix, such\nas agarose (suitable due to its low-melting-point so as not to boil the\nsample) while mounting at a low enough concentration to not have a detrimental\nimpact on the light sheet quality (Fig. 5A). As zebrafish do not tolerate\ntemperatures above 32 \u00b0C for a long period of time, the agarose needs to be\nchilled down to below this temperature, which causes it to set quickly.\n\nThe sample can be otherwise mounted in a small volume/diameter syringe. The\nspecimen is sucked in while being immersed in still liquid agarose. While the\nagarose is cooling down and sets, the sample can still be manipulated and\noptimally positioned. Once the agarose is set, the sample can be partially\nextruded into the water-filled sample chamber and is ready to be imaged.\n\nOther ways of sample mounting have been developed such as the use of tubes\nmade out of PTFE (Fig. 35C). This plastic has nearly the same refractive index\nas water and once immersed, is optically transparent and does not affect the\nlight sheet properties. The tube approach has the additional benefit as one\ncan use a small amount of potentially costly medium (few \u03bcl) that is separated\nfrom the rest of the sample chamber with its large volume (few ml).\n\nPlenty of different mounting techniques (Fig. 5A-D) have already been\nestablished and optimized for various sized samples, ranging from individual\ncells such as oocytes to entire organs such as brains.\n\n#### Tissue Clearing\n\nLight sheet microscopy is also a tool to image larger samples, which in\ncomparison would take hours to image by conventional means. But large samples\nare quite opaque and light will be scattered and dispersed, for example,\ncompartments rich in lipids can be imagined to function as microlenses.\nDepending on the tissue, pigments can also cause problems as pigments function\nas barriers and prevent light from ending up in the designated location.\n\nTo overcome those problems, tissue clearing was re-introduced (Fig. 6). Known\nfor over a century, various methods using organic and inorganic solvents have\nbeen applied to larger samples (up to entire organisms such as mice) which\nenable researchers to look deeper into opaque structures and in more detail.\n\nFigure 6: Tissue clearing. Mouse brain A) before and B) after clearing using\nCLARITY. Adapted from Chung et al. (2013)\n\nSome of those recipes will use organic solvents such as a mixture of benzyl\nalcohol and benzyl benzoate. Those solvents are very harsh and can easily\ndestroy, or at least affect, various materials such as glues used on\nmicroscope lenses. A regular water dipping lens would suffer severely in the\npresence of those solvents. Hence, microscope companies have tried to overcome\nthose issues as the clearing quality achieved by organic solvents is clearly\nsuperior to other methods using less harsh ingredients.\n\n## Drawbacks and Artifacts\n\nDepending on the sample, light sheet microscopy enables the researcher to\nobserve live processes never observed before. But unfortunately, it is not\nartifact-free.\n\nOne of the biggest problems is striping patterns in the sample (Fig. 7A-B) \u2013\nespecially when using a standing wave and static mirrors. Those areas which\nseem to get less exposure are due to shadowing from optically dense structures\nand can be improved by pivoting the sheet (Fig. 7C-D). This problem can also\nbe caused by dispersion which, due to the nature of the sample, may contain\nstructures such as lipids which can act as microlenses in the tissue.\n\nFigure 7: Striping artifacts and image degradation. A) Objects and obstacles\nwithin a sample will cause shadows behind them when hit with a light sheet.\nThis causes striping artifacts. B) Zebrafish embryo 32 hours post-\nfertilization imaged using single illumination SPIM. The light sheet was\nintroduced from the left. Signal degradation and striping can be observed due\nto objects in the sample. C) By pivoting the light sheet at different angles,\nthe shadows and artifacts are reduced. D) Same sample and imaging setup as B\nbut with pivot scanning. The artifacts are consideraly reduced B) and D)\nadapted from Huisken & Stainier (2009).\n\nAnother problem that leads to further non-uniformity of the sample\nillumination is the fact that the shape of the sheet and the intensity within\nwill degrade as it passes through the sample. The same is true for emitted\nphotons from deep within the sample not ending up in the imaging objective.\nFinally, sample mounting can be an issue. Researchers commonly state that\nlight sheet microscopy is straightforward if not for the sample mounting.\n\n## Light Sheet Implementations\n\nThe standard light sheet implementation is SPIM, as seen in Fig.3, involving\none microscope objective and one perpendicular light sheet. Due to the way\nthis setup is shaped, it can also be referred to as L-SPIM (due to the sheet\nbeing 90\u00b0 to the objective and making an L).\n\nA great many other variations of SPIM exist, virtually one for every letter of\nthe alphabet. Some of the main implementations of light sheet are discussed\nhere, but be sure to check the other application notes for more advanced\ntechniques on the light sheet learn page. Fig.8 shows some of the variations\nof SPIM.\n\nFigure 8: Different formats of SPIM with a sample (black circle). L-SPIM)\nStandard light sheet, illumination perpendicular to detection. T-SPIM)\nIllumination from both sides. Multi-view SPIM) Illumination and detection from\nboth sides. iSPIM) Sample adhered to a surface with objectives at 45\u00b0. diSPIM)\niSPIM but both objectives can illuminate or detect. Reflective SPIM) One\nobjective illuminates the sample from the side via micromirror and then\ndetects signal. Oblique) One objective illuminates the sample with an angled\nlight sheet and then detects signal\n\n#### L-SPIM\n\nThe light sheet is created by using a cylindrical lens in conjunction with a\nlarge Gaussian beam. The pre-shaped (flattened) beam is focused onto the back\nfocal plane of a lens, sent through it, and the sheet is created.\n\nUsing one sheet and one detection results in the L-SPIM layout (Fig. 3). With\nimaging depth, signal quality (excitation and emission) will degrade. In\naddition, L-SPIM uses a static sheet that only partially illuminates the\nsample. To overcome these issues, the sample has to be rotated, in the optimal\ncase rotating four times by 90\u00b0 and reassembled using sophisticated\nalgorithms. This is computationally challenging in terms of speed and time.\nFurthermore, it will be quite prone to artifacts. Another solution is to have\ntwo light sheets, one from each direction.\n\n#### T-SPIM\n\nT-SPIM involves having two sheets from opposing sides which can be overlaid\n(Fig.8). As the intensity of a single sheet can decrease due to scatter and\ndispersion, the opposing sheet will increase imaging quality. Both sheets can\nbe overlaid perfectly by matching their individual f. To increase the sheet\nand therefore image quality, researchers sometimes assign a slight offset to\nboth as this will make the sheet more parallel over a longer distance. T-SPIM\nalso results in less artifacts, as potential obstacles are illuminated from\nboth sides, eliminating shadows, as seen in Fig.9.\n\nFigure 9: Images of an 8 hour post-fertilization Zebrafish embryo with L-SPIM\n(left) and T-SPIM (right). Note the elimination of right-side shadows in the\nT-SPIM image.\n\nIn the T-SPIM layout, a large sample will be difficult to image, especially\nthe rear, as the emitted light has to travel a long way into the sample and\nout of it. Dispersion and scattering will influence signals from deeper layers\nin the sample massively. To obtain a full stack of the sample only one\nrotation by 180\u00b0 is required. More rotations at smaller intervals might\nimprove the overall quality. As the FOV is required to be bigger individual\nfile sizes will be larger, but fusion and the required computational\nprocessing can be quicker and easier. The T-SPIM layout can be used to\nilluminate very large samples on a macroscope at low magnification to get an\nentire organ for example imaged as quickly as possible. Various flavours are\nout there, which mainly differ in the number of sheets and their individual\npositioning, all aiming for a better imaging quality with fewer artifacts.\n\n#### mSPIM\n\nMulti-view spim (mSPIM or 4-lens SPIM) combines two excitation and two imaging\nlight paths, where the cameras are synced with each other (Fig.8). For optimal\nresolution, the sample is imaged twice. First at 0\u00b0 and a second time rotated\nby 45\u00b0. Objects imaged in XY can be resolved to a much higher detail compared\nto Z. This is owed to the way an object gets convolved by a series of lenses\nwhich is a function depending on the emission wavelength. The imaged object \u2013\nbe it infinitely small \u2013 will resemble a prolate spheroid, which is narrow\n(XY) and elongated (Z). This underlying convolution function is called the\npoint spread function (PSF). When registering the stacks obtained at 0\u00b0 and\n45\u00b0 \u2013 which requires fiducial markers around or in the sample \u2013 the PSFs from\neach individual point will be merged. Thereby, the resolution will become\nisotropic and improved by a factor of 3 in Z.\n\n#### iSPIM and diSPIM\n\nInverted SPIM (iSPIM) and dual-view inverted SPIM (diSPIM) involve placing the\nobjectives above the sample in a V-shape (Fig.8). The sample itself rests on\nsome kind of platform. Either the objectives are moved up and down to acquire\nz-stacks or the sample is relative to the objectives. In essence, iSPIM is\nL-SPIM but at a different angle and with the sample fixed onto a stage. In\ndiSPIM, excitation and emission occurs through both lenses. Excitation\nalternates between the two sides, as does the imaging. This system achieves\nisotropic resolution when used with two lenses of the same specifications.\nSometimes this system can utilize different NA lenses. This will not result in\nisotropic resolution, but still dramatically improves the image quality.\n\n#### Virtual Light Sheet\n\nWhile the previous iterations of SPIM use a standing beam, some\nimplementations of light sheet use a scanning beam.\n\nBy rapidly scanning a single beam and integrating the signal on camera, a\nvirtual sheet can be produced. The beam itself needs to be of higher power\ncompared to a standing sheet as each portion can only be excited for a\nfraction of the exposure time of the camera (which however is still much less\ncompared to conventional widefield or confocal techniques). In this case,\nthere is no requirement for a cylindrical lens.\n\nThis version of the light sheet allows a more sophisticated use of the camera.\nThe position of the beam can be registered with the position of the row of\npixels which is currently receiving a signal. All other neighboring rows are\ninactive and won\u2019t detect a signal. As the Gaussian beam intensity drops off\nin all directions around the central axis, it will excite signal to a lesser\nextent all around the beam. With the single-row read-out, the out-of-focus\nsignal can be rejected and the image will become crisper. This is also\nreferred to as virtual slit mode.\n\n#### Bessel Beams\n\nAnother variant of the scanning beam method was introduced by Eric Betzig\u2019s\nlab. Rather than a beam with Gaussian characteristics, it is based on a Bessel\nbeam which in theory is non-diffractive. In contrast to a Gaussian beam, it\nwill propagate without diffraction and spreading. An important feature is its\nself-healing property. In case the beam gets partially obstructed at one\npoint, it\u2019ll reform further down the beam axis. Although this only happens in\nthe ideal case, one can get a close to and by this achieve nearly no\ndiffraction over a limited distance.\n\nWith the help of a lens called an axicon, a Gaussian beam can be converted\ninto a Bessel-Gaus beam. Axisymmetric diffraction gratings or a narrow annular\naperture placed in the far-field can achieve a similar outcome. The reason why\nit is tempting to use the Bessel beam \u2013 apart from its reduced sensitivity to\ndiffraction \u2013 is that its profile is much smaller in diameter than the usually\nachievable Gaussian beam: <1\u03bcm. In essence, this allows super-resolution\nmicroscopy to be performed as the beam is now the limiting factor for\nresolving details, rather than the imaging lenses. Synchronization between\nbeam position and the active line on the camera is crucial. For more on Bessel\nbeams, please refer to our application note on lattice light sheet.\n\n## Data Storage and Processing\n\nFast data acquisition of large samples in 3D with very small pixels (high\nresolution) can result in a tremendous amount of data. Before one even starts\nto think about buying a light sheet system, considerations of proper data\nhandling during imaging (no bottleneck between camera and PC to slow\nacquisition down) and post-processing should be done carefully. If a simple\nz-stack obtained in one color can already be hundreds of MB, imaging over time\ncan easily reach 10-100 GB or more. Hence the appropriate hardware in the form\nof servers, SSDs, and fast data connections are required, and those will\nsometimes be even more expensive than the microscope itself.\n\n## Summary\n\nLight sheet is a rapidly growing field in imaging due to its flexibility, low\ncost, and power as a platform. With the low phototoxicity, ability to image\nlarge samples and acquisition of images at a high speed, light sheet is the\ntechnique of choice for a number of researchers. The many flavors of SPIM\nallow for a customizable platform to be built in-house, for any imaging needs.\n\n## Download As PDF\n\n## References\n\nChen BC, Legant WR et al (2014) Lattice Light Sheet Microscopy: Imaging\nMolecules to Embryos at High Spatiotemporal Resolution.
