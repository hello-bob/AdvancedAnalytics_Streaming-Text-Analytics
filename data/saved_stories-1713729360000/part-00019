A vast amount\nof available capital has resulted in the growth of \u2018pre-seed\u2019 as a venture\nstage while also keeping companies private for much longer. The role of a GP\nis now more specialised, with a greater focus either on the qualitative\nmetrics at early stage, or the quantaitive metrics at later stage.\n\nThis divergence is new enough that it still causes significant confusion; it\u2019s\neasy to find people talking at cross purposes because they exist at opposite\nends of the market. The differences are so fundamental that they are\npractically separate asset classes.\n\nIt is in these differences that I think the future of venture capital lies:\nthe value unlocked by embracing the divergent strengths of early and late\nstage managers.\n\nThis approach is already being prototyped by firms like Lightspeed, using\ncontinuation funds as a strategy to unlock liquidity for LPs. This represents\na major positive development for venture capital, for a number of good\nreasons:\n\n  * Shortening liquidity horizons to ~6 years^1\n  * Allowing GPs to raise smaller funds, more often, and invest more responsively\n  * Better optimised for different risk:return profiles and a firm\u2019s specialisation on go-to-market or growth problems\n  * Limiting capital waste by introducing sell/buy tension at an earlier point in the startup\u2019s life cycle, encouraging more rational pricing\n\nIn practice, this results in a division of the venture asset class into two\nmain categories. While there will inevitably be some overlap in the middle,\nand some exceptions, it seems worth separating the two disciplines and their\nspecific attributes:\n\n### Early VC: Pre-Seed \u2013 Series C\n\nSmaller, thesis-driven firms that are focused on finding outliers. Founder\nfriendly, research heavy, experimental, eccentric. Carrying a relatively\nsmaller burden in terms of dilligence and transparency.\n\n  * Fund size: < $300M\n  * LPs: Accredited Investors/HNWs/FOs\n  * Liquidity: Primarily secondaries\n\n### Late VC: Series C \u2013 Exit\n\nLarger, metrics-driven firms that source strong performers directly from the\nearly stage firms. Looking at proven businesses with high growth potential\nthrough a more standardised lens. Transparent about both deployments and LPs.\n\n  * Fund size: > $300M\n  * LPs: FOs/Pension Funds/Insurance Companies/Endowments/Sovereign Funds\n  * Liquidity: IPO, PE secondaries, M&A\n\nThis bifurcation has two important additonal benefits:\n\n  1. It shortens the feedback window for VC performance, and disincentivises pouring capital into hot deals for inflated TVPI.\n  2. It provides clear deliniation for introducing major institutional capital and the enhanced regualtory scrutiny that should imply.\n\nThese two points reflect the goals of creating a more favourable environment\nfor LPs, a more robust fundraising ecosystem that is less prone to bubbles and\ncrashes, and an approach to enhancing transaprency without hampering the\nsmaller early stage firms.\n\nThere are three hanging questions about the economics of this change:\n\n  1. Whether the basic 2/20 fee structure ought to change in this scenario, and whether it should be significantly different between the two?\n  2. The degree to which a rational market will change venture capital returns. How much have expectations been warped by the history of dumping overheated companies at IPO? Can we expect a more stable growth in value through the life of a company?\n  3. What is different for firms like Lightspeed which may be using a continuation fund to buy their own secondaries?\n\nIn both of these cases, I think the solution is to let the market experiment\nand work this out \u2014 especially with added transparency and scrutiny on\npractices \u2014 I have more faith in positive outcomes. Even for Lightspeed, the\nperformance of both units will be under seperate scrutiny, so the incentives\nshould still work.\n\n### Why now?\n\nWhat has changed in the last two years which makes this proposition\nattractive? Well, the IPO window closed. The strategy (as discussed in my\nprevious article) of dumping companies with inflated valuations on public\nmarket investors came to an end.\n\nAn underestimated effect of that strategy, which dominated VC for the previous\ndecade or so, was that it meant a disproportionate amount of value was\nunlocked at IPO \u2014 and VCs didn\u2019t necessarily believe in the value of companies\non the way there.^2\n\nConsequently, nobody wanted to offload their shares in a winning company until\nit went public. That\u2019s when the big payout was. Clearly LPs liked the outsized\nreturns for as long as they lasted, but now that era is over we are firmly\nback to looking at the timeline on returns.\n\nIn a market with a more rational perspective on value and pricing, you can\nmake sense of a transaction at any point. Secondaries become much more\nappealing. Again, this is all covered in more detail in the previous article.\n\nCertainly we appear to be at a point in history where every stakeholder in\nventure, from founders to LPs, should be interested in finding a better way\nforward.\n\nThis is just one proposal for what that might look like.\n\n  1. Maybe longer in today\u2019s market, but I expect that to contract again []\n  2. This is where the frankly obnoxious view of valuation as an arbitrary milestone comes from.
