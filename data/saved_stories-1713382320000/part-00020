It has begun applying for permits for a two-\nyear pilot project at the port, that said it could safely remove hundreds of\ntons of carbon a year from the air.\n\nEbb Carbon is a California startup that plans to use electrochemical processes\nto filter seawater through a series of tanks and shipping containers on shore\ninto two streams: one alkaline and one acidic. It would then return just the\nalkaline water back to the ocean, triggering a natural chemical reaction.\n\nCompany spokeswoman Kyla Westphal said it would \u201caccelerate the natural\nprocesses within the ocean that have been capturing and storing carbon dioxide\nfrom the air for millennia.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Ebb Carbon\n\n/\n\nEbb Carbon\n\nHow the Ebb carbo removal system works\n\nShe said the pilot project would start small.\n\n\u201cBut really, it's a stepping stone to scaling this technology in the future,\nso that we can ultimately be drawing down millions or even the billions of\ntons we need to, in order to prevent the worst impacts of climate change,\u201d\nWestphal said.\n\nWestphal said they would only do so safely and responsibly, with systems in\nplace to monitor the environment closely and ensure that the higher alkaline\ndischarge doesn\u2019t harm local ecosystems.\n\n\u201cSo that if we observe anything out of the ordinary, we can take the steps\nnecessary to pause the operation, stop the operations, and really assess\nwhat's going on,\u201d she said.\n\nAnne Shaffer, lead scientist with the Coastal Watershed Institute in Port\nAngeles, said the project is moving too quickly and without proper safeguards.\n\n\u201cNo matter what you do, you have to make sure that you do not harm these\ncritical species and their habitats that we've worked for literally decades\nand invested hundreds of millions of dollars to conserve and restore,\u201d Shaffer\nsaid.\n\nShe said the proposed state permit would allow the discharge of water that\nexceeds state limits for temperature and PH. This would be very close to the\nnearshore area off the mouth of the Elwha River, where multiple endangered\nspecies are still recovering after dam removal.\n\nAdditionally, she notes that Ebb Carbon is currently testing a smaller-scale\nmethod in Sequim in partnership with the Pacific Northwest National\nLaboratory. The company outlines on its website how at that project, they used\ntreatment systems to neutralize the water before they returned it to the\nocean.\n\n\u201cSo they know how to do that, and it can be done. They're not doing it in the\nPort Angeles project,\u201d Shaffer said.\n\nWestphal said its technology is not designed to work in tanks and that it\nneeds the vast surface area of the ocean to maximize the amount of CO2 it can\nsafely draw down.\n\nAdditionally, Westphal said Ebb Carbon is also aiming to address the ocean\nacidification that goes along with climate change (among other effects, it\nharms shellfish and is sometimes called the \u2019evil twin\u2019 of climate change.)\n\nBy releasing alkaline water into the ocean, the company aims to counteract\nthat.\n\n\u201cAnd we really can't address coastal acidification if we're releasing our\nalkalinity into tanks,\u201d Westphal said.\n\nEbb Carbon still needs permits at the local, state and federal levels. A state\nwater quality permit for the project is open for public comment through May 2.\nThey hope to get those permits in quickly and be up and running by late this\nsummer or early fall.\n\nProduced with assistance from the Public Media Journalists Association Editor\nCorps funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private corporation\nfunded by the American people.\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Flipboard\n  * Email\n\nBellamy Pailthorp\n\nBellamy Pailthorp covers the environment for KNKX with an emphasis on climate\njustice, human health and food sovereignty.
