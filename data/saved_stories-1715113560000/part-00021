Common Corpus is a dataset that only uses text from\ncopyright-expired sources to bypass the legal issues. It\u2019s a useful\nachievement, paving the path to research without immediate risk of lawsuits. I\nalso fear that this approach may lead to bad policies, reinforcing the power\nof copyright holders; not the small creators but large corporations.\n\n## A dataset built on public domain sources\n\nIn March 2024 Common Corpus was released as an open access dataset for\ntraining large language models (LLMs). Announcing the release, the lead\ndeveloper Pierre-Carl Langlais says \u201cCommon Corpus shows it is possible to\ntrain fully open LLMs on sources without copyright concerns.\u201d The dataset\ncontains 500 billion words in multiple European languages and different\ncultural heritages. It is a project coordinated by the French startup Pleias\nand supported by organizations committed to open science such as Occiglot,\nEleuther AI and Nomic AI as well as being partly funded by the French\ngovernment. The stated intention of Common Corpus is to democratize access to\nlarge quality datasets. It has many other positive characteristics,\nhighlighted also by Open Future\u2019s summary of a talk given by Langlais.\n\n## The commons needs more data\n\nThe debates sparked by the Deep Dive: AI process on the role of training data\nhighlighted that AI practitioners encounter many obstacles assembling\ndatasets. At the same time, we discovered that tech giants have an incredible\nadvantage over researchers and startups. They\u2019ve been slurping data for\ndecades, have the financial means to go to court and can enter into bilateral\nagreements to license data. These strategies are inaccessible to small\ncompetitors and academics. Accepting that the only path to creating open large\ndatasets suitable to train Open Source AI systems is to use sources in the\npublic domain, risks cementing the dominant positions of existing large\ncorporations.\n\nThe open landscape already faces issues with big tech and their ability to\ninfluence legislation. The big corporations have lobbied to extend the\nduration of copyright, introduced the DMCA, are opposing the right to repair,\nand have the resources to continue lobbying and sue any new entrant who they\ndeem to get too close. There are plenty of examples showing an unequal\nadvantage in protecting what they think is theirs. The non-profit Fairly\nTrained certifies companies \u201cwilling to prove that they\u2019ve trained their AI\nmodels on data that they own, have licensed, or that is in the public domain,\u201d\nrespecting copyright law: who\u2019s going to benefit from this approach?\n\n## Unsuitable for public policies\n\nInitiatives like Common Corpus and The Stack (used to train Starcoder2) are\nimportant achievements as they allow researchers to develop new AI systems\nwhile mitigating the risk of being sued. They also push the technical\nboundaries of what can be achieved with smaller datasets that don\u2019t require a\nnuclear power plant to train new models. But I think they mask the underlying\nissue: AI needs data and limiting open datasets to only public domain sources\nwill never give them a chance to match the size of the proprietary ones. The\nlobby for copyright maximalists is always looking for ways to expand scope and\nextend terms for copyright laws, and when they succeed it is a one-way\nratchet. It would be a tragedy for society if legislators listened to their\nsophistry and made new laws doing this based on the apparent consensus that\ncreators need protection from AI. The role of data for training machine\nlearning systems is a divisive topic and a complex one. Having datasets like\nCommon Corpus is a very useful way for the science of AI to progress with\nbetter sources. For policies, we\u2019d be better off pushing for something like\nthe proposal advanced by Open Future and Creative Commons in their paper\nTowards a Books Data Commons for AI Training.\n\nOpen Source AI Definition \u2013 Weekly update May 6\n\nJoin the discussion\n\n## Keep up with Open Source\n\nWe\u2019ll never share your details and you can unsubscribe with a click!\n\nJoin Us\n\n## About\n\n  * About\n  * Our team\n  * Associations\n  * Sponsors\n  * Articles of Incorporation\n  * Bylaws\n  * History\n  * Privacy policy\n\n## Open Source AI\n\n  * Open Source AI\n  * Bi-weekly Townhalls\n  * Online forum\n  * OSAI Definition Roadshow\n\n## Licenses\n\n  * Open Source Definition\n  * Licenses\n  * License Review Process\n  * Open Standards Requirement for Software\n\n## Board\n\n  * Board of Directors\n  * Minutes\n  * Elections\n  * Organization & Operations\n  * Conflict of Interest Policy\n  * Board member agreement\n\n## Trademark and logo\n\n  * OSI Trademark Guidelines\n  * OSI Logo Files\n  * Logo Usage Guidelines\n\n## Community\n\n  * Resources\n  * Become an Individual Member\n  * Events\n  * Become an OSI Affiliate\n  * Affiliate Organizations\n\nThe content on this website, of which Opensource.org is the author, is\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n\nOpensource.org is not the author of any of the licenses reproduced on this\nsite.
