The middle-aged woman had no history of recent blood\ntransfusions, injectable drug use or sexual contact with an HIV-positive\nindividual, but she did report receiving a vampire facial.\n\nThe other reports came from women who had also had vampire facials in 2018.\nOne was diagnosed with early-stage HIV in 2019, and the other last year when\nshe wound up in hospital with severe symptoms.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThese are people who had no known risks for HIV acquisition,\u201d said CDC\nepidemiologist Anna Stadelman-Behar, the Washington Post reports. \u201cIt was a\nshock to them, definitely.\u201d\n\n1:57 \u2018I stayed scared for years\u2019: 2 Sask.

Those touting the technique, including celebrities\nlike Gwyneth Paltrow and Kim Kardashian, claim better-looking skin.\n\nThe email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the\nworld.\n\nHowever, the American Academy of Dermatology says there\u2019s little evidence to\nsupport claims that vampire facials can help reduce the appearance of saggy\nskin, acne or wrinkles.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s report said that while the transmission likely occurred at the\nsalon, the source of contamination remains a mystery.\n\nAt the time of the investigation, NMDOH epidemiologist Dr. Michael Landen told\nKOAT News they were shocked by how VIP Spa was storing, handling and disposing\nof needles.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nUnlabelled tubes of blood were found on a rack on a kitchen counter as well as\nin the kitchen fridge next to personal food and other injectables.\nInvestigators also found unwrapped syringes on counters, in trash cans and in\ndrawers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s concerning, because if needles aren\u2019t handled appropriately, you could\npotentially increase the risk of a blood-borne infection,\u201d he said.\n\nTrending Now\n\n  * Stuck in B.C. lagoon for weeks, killer whale calf is finally free\n\n  * B.C. teen\u2019s killer says new TV show about Reena Virk\u2019s murder \u2018disrespectful\u2019\n\nView image in full screen\n\nA patient receives an injectable treatment in this photo illustration. Getty\nImages\n\nAccording to NBC affiliate KOB, the spa\u2019s owner pleaded guilty to five felony\ncounts of practicing medicine without a licence in 2022 and was sentenced to\nthree-and-a-half years in prison.\n\nThis marks the first time that HIV transmission through cosmetic injection\nservices has been documented, officials say.\n\nStadelman-Behar told the New York Times that the \u201cbiggest takeaway is that\nlicensing is super important.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re licensed, then they have had infection-control training and know\nthe correct procedures, and are bound by law to follow proper infection-\ncontrol practices.\u201d\n\nShe recommends that anyone receiving these kinds of medi-spa procedures ask\nproviders to open fresh syringes and vials in front of them, and to double-\ncheck that any blood drawn is properly labelled with their name, date of birth\nand collection date.\n\n1:54 Do you know your HIV status?
