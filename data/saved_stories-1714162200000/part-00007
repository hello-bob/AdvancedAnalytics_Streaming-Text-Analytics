Page\n1 of 5. 31 Comments.\n\nOne of the leading-edge benefits of Fedora Linux is that it always ships with\nthe most up-to-date open-source compiler toolchains at release. For their\nspring releases each year, it typically means shipping with a GCC compiler\nthat isn't even officially released as stable yet. With this week's release of\nFedora 40, it's shipping with GCC 14.0.1 as the development version that will\nculminate with the inaugural GCC 14 stable release in the coming weeks. Plus\nFedora 40 has all of the other latest GNU toolchain components and then over\non the LLVM side is with the current LLVM 18 stable series. For those curious\nhow GCC 14 vs. LLVM Clang 18 performance is looking, here is a wide range of\nC/C++ benchmarks carried out on Fedora Workstation 40 using a System76 Thelio\nMajor workstation powered by the Zen 4 AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7980X.\n\nFor our first look at the GCC 14 vs. Clang 18 compiler performance, I ran more\nthan 120 benchmarks this week looking at how the 64-core Ryzen Threadripper\n7980X is performing for each of these compilers as shipped by Fedora 40 and\nmaintaining the same CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS throughout.\n\nIt's quite a straight-forward look in seeing how the GCC vs. Clang x86_64\nperformance is competing with these new 2024 versions. For those that haven't\nlooked at GCC vs. Clang benchmarks in recent years, it's very competitive on\nthe x86_64 side and on AArch64 there are a number of areas where Clang leads.\n\nWhen the GCC 14.1 stable release is out I'll be following up with a more\ndiverse range of CPUs and benchmarks being carried out for these latest open-\nsource compilers. For now is the Fedora 40 look at GCC 14 vs. Clang 18 on AMD\nZen 4 as a preview.\n\n31 Comments - Next Page\n\nPage: 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page\n\nRelated Articles\n\nLinux 6.9 Drives AMD 4th Gen EPYC Performance Even Higher For Some Workloads\n\nIntel Core Ultra \"Meteor Lake\" Yields Faster Performance With Linux 6.9\n\nGoogle Cloud's C3D Instances Provide Strong Performance Value For PingCAP's\nTiDB\n\nLinux 6.9 Features: DM VDO, AMD Preferred Core, Intel FRED & Larger Console\nFonts\n\nLLVM Clang Shows Off Great Performance Advantage On NVIDIA GH200's Neoverse-V2\nCores\n\nThe Performance Impact Of Intel's Register File Data Sampling \"RFDS\"\nMitigation\n\nLatest Linux News\n\nGCC 14.1 Compiler Aiming For Release Around 7 May\n\nGCC 14 Adds \"GFX90C\" For OpenMP Offloading To APUs With GFX9/Vega Graphics\n\nLinux 6.10 Adding Intel Low-Latency Hint To Aggressively Boost GT Frequency\nFor GPU Compute\n\nAMDGPU Linux Driver Patches Enable SOC24 & MMHUB 4.1.x IP\n\nServo Web Engine Now Passing Acid2 Layout Engine Test\n\nMicrosoft Open-Sources MS-DOS 4.0 Under MIT License\n\nSystemd 256-rc1 Brings A Huge Number Of New Features\n\nNVIDIA Developer Opens Feature Pull Request For Open-Source NVK Driver\n\nWayland 1.23 Alpha Released With OpenBSD Support & New APIs\n\nSovereign Tech Fund Makes New Investments Into GNOME & PHP, Bug Bounty For\nsystemd\n\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS Downloads Now Available\n\nFedora Miracle Spin Proposed For Fedora 41\n\nShow Your Support, Go Premium\n\nPhoronix Premium allows ad-free access to the site, multi-page articles on a\nsingle page, and other features while supporting this site's continued\noperations.\n\nLatest Featured Articles\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7950X & Intel Core i9 14900K: Ubuntu 22.04 vs. 23.10 vs. 24.04\nLinux Performance\n\nGCC 14 vs. LLVM Clang 18 Compiler Performance On Fedora 40\n\nKioxia KCD8XPUG1T92 CD8P-R & KCMYXVUG3T20 CM7-V PCIe 5.0 SSDs\n\nUbuntu 24.04 Boosts Performance, Outperforming Windows 11 On The AMD Ryzen\nFramework 16 Laptop\n\nAMD Announces Ryzen PRO 8840 & PRO 8000G Series CPUs\n\nSupport Phoronix\n\nThe mission at Phoronix since 2004 has centered around enriching the Linux\nhardware experience.
