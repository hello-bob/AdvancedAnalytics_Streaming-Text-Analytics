The name refers to a French culinary phrase that roughly translates to\n\"setup\" or \"put in place\". The idea is that before one begins cooking, they\nshould have all their utensils and ingredients ready to go in their place.\n\nmise does the same for your projects. Using its .mise.toml config file, you'll\nhave a consistent way to setup and interact with your projects no matter what\nlanguage they're written in.\n\nIts functionality is grouped into 3 categories described below.\n\nmise installs and manages dev tools/runtimes like node, python, or terraform\nboth simplifying installing these tools and allowing you to specify which\nversion of these tools to use in different projects. mise supports hundreds of\ndev tools.\n\nmise manages environment variables letting you specify configuration like\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID that may differ between projects. It can also be used to\nautomatically activate a Python virtualenv when entering projects too.\n\nmise is a task runner that can be used to share common tasks within a project\namong developers and make things like running tasks on file changes easy.\n\n## Contact\n\nmise is mostly built and maintained by me, Jeff Dickey. The goal is to make\nlocal development of software easy and consistent across languages. I have\nspent many years building dev tools and thinking about the problems that mise\naddresses.\n\nI try to use the first-person in these docs since the reality is it's\ngenerally me writing them and I think it makes it more interesting having a\nbit of my personality in the text.\n\nThis project is simply a labor of love. I am making it because I want to make\nyour life as a developer easier. I hope you find it useful. Feedback is a\nmassive driver for me. If you have anything positive or negative to say-even\nif it's just to say hi-please reach out to me either on Twitter, Mastodon,\nDiscord, or jdx at this domain.\n\nEdit this page\n\nLast updated: 1/13/24, 11:49 AM\n\nLicensed under the MIT License.
