He angrily hopped on his electric tricycle and\ntraveled several kilometers to another branch where he finally managed to\nwithdraw some money after wasting the entire morning.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be so difficult to get the money you earn by working,\u201d the\n23-year-old told The Associated Press in a recent interview.\n\nFonseca is one of an increasing number of frustrated Cubans who have to\ngrapple with yet another hurdle while navigating the island\u2019s already\ncomplicated monetary system \u2014 a shortage of cash.\n\nLong queues outside banks and ATM\u2019s in the capital, Havana, and beyond start\nforming early in the day as people seek cash for routine transactions like\nbuying food and other essentials.\n\nExperts say there are several reasons behind the shortage, all somehow related\nto Cuba\u2019s deep economic crisis, one of the worst in decades.\n\nOmar Everleny P\u00e9rez, a Cuban economist and university professor, says the main\nculprits are the government\u2019s growing fiscal deficit, the nonexistence of\nbanknotes with a denomination greater than 1,000 Cuban pesos (about $3 in the\nparallel market), stubbornly high inflation and the non-return of cash to\nbanks.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe family of Mexican serial killer\u2019s first known victim protest at the site\nwhere bones were found\n\nTemporary farmworkers get more protections against retaliation and other\nabuses under new rule\n\nMexican film wins top prize at Moscow International Film Festival while major\nstudios boycott Russia\n\n\u201cThere is money, yes, but not in the banks,\u201d said P\u00e9rez, adding that most of\nthe cash is being held not by salaried workers, but by entrepreneurs and\nowners of small- and medium-size business who are more likely to collect cash\nfrom commercial transactions but are reluctant to return the money to the\nbanks.\n\nThis, P\u00e9rez says, is either because they don\u2019t trust the local banks or simply\nbecause they need the Cuban pesos to convert into foreign currency.\n\nMost entrepreneurs and small business owners in Cuba have to import almost\neverything they sell or pay in foreign currency for the supplies needed to run\ntheir businesses. As a consequence, many end up hoarding Cuban pesos to later\nchange into foreign currency on the informal market.\n\nConverting those Cuban pesos to other currencies poses yet another challenge,\nas there are several, highly fluctuating exchange rates in the island.\n\nFor example, the official rate used by government industries and agencies is\n24 pesos to the U.S. dollar, while for individuals, the rate is 120 pesos to\nthe dollar. However, the dollar can fetch up to 350 Cuban pesos on the\ninformal market.\n\nP\u00e9rez notes that in 2018, 50% of the cash in circulation was in the hands of\nthe Cuban population and the other half in Cuban banks. But in 2022, the\nlatest year for which information is available, 70% of cash was in the wallets\nof individuals.\n\nCuban monetary authorities did not immediately respond to AP\u2019s emailed request\nfor comment.\n\nThe shortage of cash comes as Cubans grapple with a complex monetary system in\nwhich several currencies circulate, including a virtual currency, MLC, created\nin 2019.\n\nThen, in 2023 the government announced several measures aimed at promoting a\n\u201ccashless society,\u201d making the use of credit cards mandatory to pay for some\ntransactions \u2014 including purchases of food, fuel and other basic goods \u2014 but\nmany businesses simply refuse to accept them.\n\nMaking things worse is stubbornly high inflation, meaning more and more\nphysical bills are needed to buy products.\n\nAccording to official figures, inflation stood at 77% in 2021, then dropped to\n31% in 2023. But for the average Cuban, the official figures barely reflect\nthe reality of their lives, since market inflation can reach up to three\ndigits on the informal market. For example, a carton of eggs, which sold for\n300 Cuban pesos in 2019, these days sells for about 3,100 pesos.\n\nAll while the monthly salary for Cuban state workers ranges between 5,000 and\n7,000 Cuban pesos (between $14 and $20 in the parallel market).\n\n\u201cTo live in an economy that, in addition to having several currencies, has\nseveral exchange rates and a three-digit inflation is quite complicated,\u201d said\nPavel Vidal, a Cuba expert and professor at Colombia\u2019s Javeriana University of\nCali.\n\n## ___\n\nAndrea Rodr\u00edguez on X: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP\n\n## ___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to\nfactual reporting.
