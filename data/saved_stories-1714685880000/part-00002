The first was when he pointed to my iPhone\nSE (the one with the home button that\u2019s mostly hated) and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the\nbest iPhone.\u201d More revealing, though, was the vision he sketched for how AI\ntools will become even more enmeshed in our daily lives than the smartphone.\n\n\u201cWhat you really want,\u201d he told MIT Technology Review, \u201cis just this thing\nthat is off helping you.\u201d Altman, who was visiting Cambridge for a series of\nevents hosted by Harvard and the venture capital firm Xfund, described the\nkiller app for AI as a \u201csuper-competent colleague that knows absolutely\neverything about my whole life, every email, every conversation I\u2019ve ever had,\nbut doesn\u2019t feel like an extension.\u201d It could tackle some tasks instantly, he\nsaid, and for more complex ones it could go off and make an attempt, but come\nback with questions for you if it needs to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a leap from OpenAI\u2019s current offerings. Its leading applications, like\nDALL-E, Sora, and ChatGPT (which Altman referred to as \u201cincredibly dumb\u201d\ncompared with what\u2019s coming next), have wowed us with their ability to\ngenerate convincing text and surreal videos and images. But they mostly remain\ntools we use for isolated tasks, and they have limited capacity to learn about\nus from our conversations with them.\n\nIn the new paradigm, as Altman sees it, the AI will be capable of helping us\noutside the chat interface and taking real-world tasks off our plates.\n\n### Altman on AI hardware\u2019s future\n\nI asked Altman if we\u2019ll need a new piece of hardware to get to this future.\nThough smartphones are extraordinarily capable, and their designers are\nalready incorporating more AI-driven features, some entrepreneurs are betting\nthat the AI of the future will require a device that\u2019s more purpose built.\nSome of these devices are already beginning to appear in his orbit. There is\nthe (widely panned) wearable AI Pin from Humane, for example (Altman is an\ninvestor in the company but has not exactly been a booster of the device). He\nis also rumored to be working with former Apple designer Jony Ive on some new\ntype of hardware.\n\nBut Altman says there\u2019s a chance we won\u2019t necessarily need a device at all. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think it will require a new piece of hardware,\u201d he told me, adding that\nthe type of app envisioned could exist in the cloud. But he quickly added that\neven if this AI paradigm shift won\u2019t require consumers buy a new hardware, \u201cI\nthink you\u2019ll be happy to have [a new device].\u201d\n\nThough Altman says he thinks AI hardware devices are exciting, he also implied\nhe might not be best suited to take on the challenge himself: \u201cI\u2019m very\ninterested in consumer hardware for new technology. I\u2019m an amateur who loves\nit, but this is so far from my expertise.\u201d\n\n### On the hunt for training data\n\nUpon hearing his vision for powerful AI-driven agents, I wondered how it would\nsquare with the industry\u2019s current scarcity of training data. To build GPT-4\nand other models, OpenAI has scoured internet archives, newspapers, and blogs\nfor training data, since scaling laws have long shown that making models\nbigger also makes them better. But finding more data to train on is a growing\nproblem. Much of the internet has already been slurped up, and access to\nprivate or copyrighted data is now mired in legal battles.\n\nAltman is optimistic this won\u2019t be a problem for much longer, though he didn\u2019t\narticulate the specifics.\n\n\u201cI believe, but I\u2019m not certain, that we\u2019re going to figure out a way out of\nthis thing of you always just need more and more training data,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHumans are existence proof that there is some other way to [train\nintelligence]. And I hope we find it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### On who will be poised to create AGI\n\nOpenAI\u2019s central vision has long revolved around the pursuit of artificial\ngeneral intelligence (AGI), or an AI that can reason as well as or better than\nhumans. Its stated mission is to ensure such a technology \u201cbenefits all of\nhumanity.\u201d It is far from the only company pursuing AGI, however. So in the\nrace for AGI, what are the most important tools? I asked Altman if he thought\nthe entity that marshals the largest amount of chips and computing power will\nultimately be the winner.\n\nAltman suspects there will be \u201cseveral different versions [of AGI] that are\nbetter and worse at different things,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be over some\ncompute threshold, I would guess. But even then I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m certain.\u201d\n\n### On when we\u2019ll see GPT-5\n\nYou thought he\u2019d answer that? When another reporter in the room asked Altman\nif he knew when the next version of GPT is slated to be released, he gave a\ncalm response. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied, smiling, and said nothing more.\n\n### by James O'Donnell\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
