It is simply a computer screen that\nworks in front of a window or on a sunny day instead of using the embedded\nelectric light. A desktop screen that is resistant to function at night times.\nTechnically speaking; the computer screen doesn\u2019t need the LEDs inside in\norder to function. The LEDs are taken out of the screen and another window\nbehind it is opened. The screen\u2019s light source is now the environmental light\nor daylight.\n\n25.01.2023\n\n\"Our screens have defined new spaces for new social engagements. Our houses\nhave been transforming themself into a 24/7 lit environment. Home can no\nlonger be considered only as a shelter, but personally, I find it fascinating\nand scary to consider it as a node in a highly connected network, like the one\nUgo La Pietra described in his statement for the New Domestic Landscape; \"The\ndomestic cell: a microstructure inside the information and communication\nsystems\". Personal devices are part of this node that maintains our daily\nroutines. The omnipresence of electric light provides any scheduled task to be\ndone without interruption from home. Consequently, our daily lives are\nstructured on the reliability of an electric network. We rely on our devices\nand their ability to connect with digital platforms. Artificial light has\nbecome a substance of which we don't question its existence but its absence\nbecause it is one of the main components of our daily life. Especially with\neveryday devices, like personal phones and computers, we have become the\nextension of these networks. We not only receive visual inputs, but we also\nsend and receive large amounts of information every day through light. In the\ndomestic context, light is used in many different ways. Evidently, light is\nnot by itself able to govern our daily routines, but it governs them through\nan electric apparatus.\n\n# Ba\u015fak Tuna, Folding Screens. Site specific installation, 2021. Broken\ncomputer screens, metal frame.\n\nIt turns on and off; it alerts, it flickers, it flashes; it changes colour; it\nindicates a space; it gives directions; it changes the user's movement; it\nchanges the mood of a space... Light is separate from its use, yet it\neliminates time and space factors in human association in cooperation with our\nsmart personal devices. We are no longer in need of natural time reminders to\nshape our schedule like daylight; instead, we have access to it twenty-four\nhours and seven days a week. As a consequence, physical space around the\ndevice loses its significance because the device itself highlights the\ninformation on a specific surface by one specific light source. Quite visibly,\nthe pandemic has sharpened the disengagement with the city, public space,\nmobility and with physicality; we are left living more and more fixed but more\nconnected to our light-emitting object networks that surround us. Even though\nthere is no apparent physical labour, the work itself is the usage of the\ndevice, thus including being exposed to the device's blue light. As\nexperienced by everybody, with or without notice, there is always more to do,\nand there is always the urge to keep doing things. We are busy all the time\nwith our glowing devices. Where does human usership's agency start, and where\ndoes it end? \"\n\nAIR InSILO\n\nis a non-profit association for the promotion of art and culture, the\ninternational artist exchange, the mediation of artistic projects in the\nregional and supraregional area, and the implementation of an artist-in-\nresidence program.\n\nADDRESS\n\nAIR INSILO MITTERWEG 30 2020 HOLLABRUNN AUSTRIA\n\nIMPRESSUM\n\nZVR-ZAHL 1364727313 IN.SILO.AIR@GMAIL.COM T: +43 664 1122306 RESPONSIBLE FOR\nTHE CONTENT: Martin Breindl, Ksenia Yurkova\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE NEWS\n\nWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing\nexperience on our website, to analyze our website traffic, and understand\nwhere our visitors are coming from.
