In\nparticular, the psychological control dimension has rarely been explicitly\nmodelled and there is limited insight into joint parenting styles that\nsimultaneously characterize maternal and paternal practices and their impact\non child development. Using data from a sample of 600 Flemish families raising\nan 8-to-10 year old child, we identified naturally occurring joint parenting\nstyles. A cluster analysis based on two parenting dimensions (parental support\nand behavioral control) revealed four congruent parenting styles: an\nauthoritative, positive authoritative, authoritarian and uninvolved parenting\nstyle. A subsequent cluster analysis comprising three parenting dimensions\n(parental support, behavioral and psychological control) yielded similar\ncluster profiles for the congruent (positive) authoritative and authoritarian\nparenting styles, while the fourth parenting style was relabeled as a\ncongruent intrusive parenting style. ANOVAs demonstrated that having\n(positive) authoritative parents associated with the most favorable outcomes,\nwhile having authoritarian parents coincided with the least favorable\noutcomes. Although less pronounced than for the authoritarian style, having\nintrusive parents also associated with poorer child outcomes. Results\ndemonstrated that accounting for parental psychological control did not yield\nadditional parenting styles, but enhanced our understanding of the pattern\namong the three parenting dimensions within each parenting style and their\nassociation with child outcomes. More similarities than dissimilarities in the\nparenting of both parents emerged, although adding psychological control\nslightly enlarged the differences between the scores of mothers and fathers.\n\nKeywords: Parenting styles, Cluster analysis, Psychological control,\nPsychosocial outcomes, School-aged children\n\nParenting has gained ample research attention from various scientific\ndisciplines. Many theoretical frameworks emphasize that parenting plays a\nvital role in child development, which has fueled research investigating the\nimpact of parenting on child development for over 75 years. When studying\nparenting, researchers can take various strategies by considering parenting\npractices, parenting dimensions or parenting styles. Parenting practices can\nbe defined as directly observable specific behaviors that parents use to\nsocialize their children (Darling and Steinberg 1993). For example, parenting\npractices intended to promote academic achievement are showing involvement by\nattending parent\u2013teacher meetings or regular supervision of children\u2019s\nhomework. Other parenting practices pertain to positive reinforcement,\ndiscipline, or problem solving.\n\nRather than focusing on specific parenting practices, other researchers have\nidentified overarching parenting dimensions that reflect similar parenting\npractices, mostly by modeling the relationships among these parenting\npractices using factor analytic techniques. There is consensus among\nscientists about the existence of at least two broad dimensions of parenting,\nlabeled parental support and parental control. Parental support pertains to\nthe affective nature of the parent-child relationship, indicated by showing\ninvolvement, acceptance, emotional availability, warmth, and responsivity\n(Cummings et al. 2000). Support has been related to positive development\noutcomes in children, such as the prevention of alcohol abuse and deviance\n(Barnes and Farrell 1992), depression and delinquency (Bean et al. 2006) and\nexternalizing problem behavior (Shaw et al. 1994).\n\nThe control dimension has been subdivided into psychological and behavioral\ncontrol (Barber 1996; Schaefer 1965; Steinberg 1990). Parental behavioral\ncontrol consists of parenting behavior that attempts to control, manage or\nregulate child behavior, either through enforcing demands and rules,\ndisciplinary strategies, control of rewards and punishment, or through\nsupervisory functions (Barber 2002; Maccoby 1990; Steinberg 1990). An\nappropriate amount of behavioral control has been considered to positively\naffect child development, whereas insufficient (e.g., poor parental\nmonitoring) or excessive behavioral control (e.g., parental physical\npunishment) has been commonly associated with negative child developmental\noutcomes, such as deviant behavior, misconduct, depression and anxious affect\n(e.g., Barnes and Farrell 1992; Coie and Dodge 1998; Galambos et al. 2003;\nPatterson et al. 1984). While parental behavioral control refers to control\nover the child\u2019s behavior, parental psychological control pertains to an\nintrusive type of control in which parents attempt to manipulate children\u2019s\nthoughts, emotions, and feelings (Barber 1996; Barber et al. 2005). Due to its\nmanipulative and intrusive nature, psychological control has almost\nexclusively been associated with negative developmental outcomes in children\nand adolescents, such as depression, antisocial behaviour and relational\nregression (e.g., Barber and Harmon 2002; Barber et al. 2005; Kuppens et al.\n2013). The three parenting dimensions (support, psychological control, and\nbehavioral control) have been labelled conceptually distinct, although they\nare related to some extent (Barber et al. 2005; Soenens et al. 2012).\n\nOther authors have taken yet a different approach to studying parenting by\nemphasizing that specific combinations of parenting practices within a parent\nparticularly impact child development rather than separate parenting practices\nor dimensions (e.g., Baumrind 1991; Maccoby and Martin 1983). Within such a\nconfigurational approach, one examines which patterns of parenting practices\noccur within the same parent and how these patterns\u2014commonly labelled as\nparenting styles\u2014 are related to children\u2019s development. Such parenting styles\nhave the clear advantage of accounting for different parenting practices at\nthe same time within the same person. As such, it comprises a person\u2013centered\napproach that focuses on configurations within individuals rather than a\nvariable\u2013centered approach that focuses on relationships among variables\nacross individuals as has been used to identify parenting dimensions\n(Magnusson 1998).\n\nBaumrind (1966, 1967, 1971) is commonly considered a pioneer of research into\nparenting styles. She introduced a typology with three parenting styles to\ndescribe differences in normal parenting behaviors: the authoritarian,\nauthoritative and permissive parenting style. Baumrind (1971) suggested that\nauthoritarian parents try to shape, control, and evaluate their children\u2019s\nbehavior based on the absolute set of standards; whereas permissive parents\nare warmer and more autonomy granting than controlling. She considered an\nauthoritative parenting style to fall between those two extremes. Later on in\nthe 1980s, Maccoby and Martin (1983) attempted to bridge Baumrind\u2019s typology\nand parenting dimensions. Based on the combination of two dimensions \u2013\ndemandingness and responsiveness \u2013 they defined four parenting styles:\nauthoritative (i.e., high demandingness and high responsiveness);\nauthoritarian (i.e., high demandingness and low responsiveness); indulgent\n(i.e., low demandingness and high responsiveness); and neglectful (i.e., low\ndemandingness and low responsiveness). These two parenting dimensions are\nsimilar, yet not identical to the dimensions \u2018parental support\u2019 and \u2018parental\nbehavioral control\u2019. Based on Maccoby and Martin\u2019s work, Baumrind (1989, 1991)\nexpanded her typology with a fourth parenting style, namely the \u2018neglectful\u2019\nparenting style.\n\nMaccoby and Martin (1983) research efforts primarily focused on the\nconfiguration of the parenting styles and to a lesser extent on their\nassociation with children\u2019s development. Baumrind, in contrast, has also\nextensively studied the association between parenting styles and child\ndevelopment (1967, 1971, 1989, 1991). This work consistently demonstrated that\nyouth of authoritative parents had the most favorable development outcomes;\nauthoritarian and permissive parenting were associated with negative\ndevelopmental outcomes; while outcomes for children of neglectful parents were\npoorest. These aforementioned associations have also been replicated by other\nresearchers. An authoritative parenting style has consistently been associated\nwith positive developmental outcomes in youth, such as psychosocial competence\n(e.g., maturation, resilience, optimism, self-reliance, social competence,\nself-esteem) and academic achievement (e.g., Baumrind 1991; Lamborn et al.\n1991; Steinberg et al. 1994). Findings regarding permissive/indulgent\nparenting have been inconsistent yielding associations with internalizing\n(i.e., anxiety, depression, withdrawn behavior, somatic complaints) and\nexternalizing problem behavior (i.e., school misconduct, delinquency), but\nalso with social skills, self\u2013confidence, self\u2013understanding and active\nproblem coping (e.g., Lamborn et al. 1991; Steinberg et al. 1994; Williams et\nal. 2009; Wolfradt et al. 2003). An authoritarian parenting style has\nconsistently been associated with negative developmental outcomes, such as\naggression, delinquent behaviors, somatic complaints, depersonalisation and\nanxiety (e.g., Hoeve et al. 2008; Steinberg et al. 1994; Williams et al. 2009;\nWolfradt et al. 2003). Children of neglectful parents have shown the least\nfavorable outcomes on multiple domains, such as lacking self-regulation and\nsocial responsibility, poor self-reliance and social competence, poor school\ncompetence, antisocial behavior and delinquency, anxiety, depression and\nsomatic complaints (e.g., Baumrind 1991; Hoeve et al. 2008; Lamborn et al.\n1991; Steinberg et al. 1994).\n\nBaumrind\u2019s typology (1966) was initially determined on theoretical grounds,\nalthough with time she did conduct empirical validation research (1967, 1971,\n1989, 1991). Nonetheless, the empirical studies always started with parenting\nstyles that were predefined in a prototypical score profile in terms of\nminimum or maximum limit scores (e.g., scores above or below the median) on\nthe different parenting practices; thus parents were first classified using\ncut\u2013off scores for these predefined parenting styles and afterwards\nassociations with child developmental outcomes were examined. However, such a\nconfirmatory approach is not preferred to investigate parenting styles types\n(Mandara 2003) as it does not allow the identification of the naturally\noccurring typology, because people are actually forced into some predefined\ncategory defined on theoretical grounds. To empirically identify typologies in\na certain population an exploratory clustering approach is needed (Everitt et\nal. 2001; Mandara 2003). Such clustering methods entail that persons are\nassessed on different variables (e.g., parenting practices) and patterns that\nnaturally occur in the data are identified. Persons with a similar score\nprofile are classified in the same cluster and those with distinctly different\nprofile scores are classified into other clusters; with the number of clusters\nand associated score profiles being unknown a priori. The literature shows\nthat researchers started to adopt such clustering methods in research into\nparenting styles about 15 to 20 years ago (Aunola et al. 2000; Beato et al.\n2016; Brenner andand Fox 1999; Carlson and Tanner 2006; Chaudhuri et al. 2009;\nDwairy et al. 2006; Gorman-Smith et al. 2000; Heberle et al. 2015; Hoeve et\nal. 2008; Lee et al. 2006; Mandara and Murray 2002; Martin et al. 2007;\nMcGroder 2000; McKinney and Renk 2008; Meteyer and Perry-Jenkins 2009;\nMets\u00e4pelto and Pulkkinen 2003; Pereira et al. 2008; Russell et al. 1998;\nShucksmith et al. 1995; Tam and Lam 2004; van der Horst and Sleddens 2017;\nWolfradt et al. 2003). These studies have generally identified three or four\nparenting styles that resemble the initial theoretical parenting styles.\n\nAlthough Baumrind\u2019s typology has greatly influenced parenting research, two\nissues have largely been overlooked in the existing knowledge. A first issue\nrelates to the psychological control dimension which is currently considered\nthe third parenting dimension. Initially, Baumrind paid little attention to\nthe role of psychological control because her control dimension solely\nreferred to parental socializing practices aimed at integrating the child in\nthe family and society (Darling and Steinberg 1993). In her later work (1971,\n1989, 1991), Baumrind did incorporate aspects of psychological control but the\nconfirmatory nature of that research (cf. using predefined clusters) makes it\nimpossible to determine which parenting styles would naturally evolve when\npsychological control would be taken into account. Empirical studies have also\nrarely explicitly included parental psychological control when modeling\nparenting styles. So far, the limited research including psychological control\nindices (e.g., Pereira et al. 2008; Wolfradt et al. 2003) has mostly\nidentified four parenting styles that match the theoretically distinct styles.\nWithin these parenting styles psychological control coincided with behavioral\ncontrol levels in the authoritarian parenting style, yet cumulative knowledge\nremains too limited to draw firm conclusions.\n\nA second issue is that existing research provides little insight into the\ncoexistence of maternal and paternal parenting styles and their joint impact\non child development. Although Baumrind included both parents in her studies,\nshe assigned a (pre-defined) parenting style to each one separately. In some\nstudies (1991), data was limited to mothers if both parents were assigned a\ndifferent parenting style; in others (1971) families were entirely excluded in\nsuch instances. Not only Baumrind, but research on parenting styles in general\nhas paid less attention to the impact of joint parenting styles on child\ndevelopment (Martin et al. 2007; McKinney and Renk 2008; Simons and Conger\n2007), but has mainly focused on the unique, differential or interaction\neffects of maternal and paternal parenting styles adopting a variable-oriented\nperspective (e.g., Beato et al. 2016; Miranda et al. 2016). Children in two-\nparent households are influenced by the combined practices of both parents\n(Martin et al. 2007); and some studies have clearly shown that mothers and\nfathers can differ in their parenting style (Conrade and Ho 2001; McKinney and\nRenk 2008; Russell et al. 1998). Considering how the parenting styles of both\nparents cluster together, therefore, aligns more closely with the real\nexperiences of children growing up in two-parent households. Only such an\napproach can shed light onto possible additive and compensatory effects\n(Martin et al. 2007). For example, Simons and Conger (2007) found evidence for\nan additive effect as having two authoritative parents was associated with the\nmost favorable outcomes in adolescents, as well as a compensatory effect where\none parent\u2019s authoritative parenting style generally buffered the less\neffective parenting style of the other parent. Similarly, McKinney and Renk\n(2008) suggested that in late adolescence perceiving one parent as\nauthoritative while the other parent has a different parenting style, partly\nbuffered for emotional adjustment problems.\n\nOnly two studies have simultaneously clustered maternal and paternal practices\ninto joint parenting styles and examined how they are associated with child\ndevelopment (for other approaches, see Martin et al. 2007; Simons and Conger\n2007; Steinberg et al. 1994). Meteyer and Perry-Jenkins (2009) modeled the\nwarmth and dysfunctional discipline practices of both parents resulting in\nthree parenting styles that aligned with Baumrind\u2019s typology, namely\nsupportive parents (i.e., similar to Baumrind\u2019s authoritative style),\nmixed\u2013supportive parents (i.e., mother\u2019s parenting style is similar to\nBaumrind\u2019s \u2018good enough parenting\u2019\u2013style and father\u2019s to Baumrind\u2019s\nauthoritarian style) and non\u2013supportive parents (i.e., similar to Baumrinds\u2019\nauthoritarian style). Although insightful, this study did not incorporate\naspects of psychological control; was limited to early elementary school\nchildren (6\u2013 to 7\u2013 year olds); and was based on a rather small sample size (85\nfamilies). McKinney and Renk (2008) identified four joint parenting styles in\ntheir cluster analyses using late adolescents\u2019 (18\u201322 years) reports of\nauthoritative, authoritarian, and permissive parenting: congruent\nauthoritative (i.e., an authoritative parenting style by both parents),\ncongruent authoritarian (i.e., an authoritarian parenting style by both\nparents), an authoritarian father\u2013authoritative mother combination, and a\npermissive father\u2013authoritarian mother combination. This study used ratings of\nparenting styles as input for cluster analysis leaving the role of separate\nparenting dimensions unclear.\n\nWe aimed to extend the existing research on the well-known parenting styles\nconcept by identifying joint parenting styles in an exploratory manner using\ndata on three major parenting dimensions (i.e., support, behavioral control\nand psychological control) and their associations with child behavioral\noutcomes in a large sample of mothers and fathers raising elementary school\nchildren. In particular, we first examined whether the configuration of\nexploratory identified parenting styles differed when the \u2013 often neglected \u2013\npsychological control dimension was considered in addition to the support and\nbehavioral control dimensions. Secondly, we identified how parenting practices\nof mothers and fathers clustered together into joint parenting styles. We were\nparticularly interested in exploring whether similarity or dissimilarity would\ndepict the joint parenting styles. Incongruence could be expected from\nattachment or gender theories that particularly stress differences between\nparents\u2019 roles, while assortative or socialization processes could result in\nhighly congruent parenting styles. Thirdly, we associated these joint\nparenting styles to child behavioral outcomes. For incongruent parenting\nstyles, we particularly examined whether the different parenting styles may\nbuffer each other\u2019s impact on child outcomes. For congruent parenting styles,\nwe looked at additive effects in which parents\u2019 (very) similar styles may\nreinforce each other\u2019s impact on child outcomes.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Method\n\n### Participants\n\nParticipants were 600 Flemish families with an elementary-school child (301\nboys; 299 girls). The children\u2019s age ranged from 8 to 10 years (M= 9.27, SD =\n0.83). For 556 children both parents participated, while for the remaining\nchildren only the mother (n = 40) or father (n = 4) took part in the study.\nThe participating mothers and fathers were on average 38.09 (SD = 4.00) and\n40.39 years old (SD = 4.85), respectively. Most parents received 12 to 15\nyears of education. The vast majority of children (92%) were of Belgian origin\n(i.e., children and both parents born in Belgium). The remaining children\nmostly originated from another European country (n= 28); a limited number had\nan African (n = 7), US (n = 4), Middle East (n= 1), Asian (n= 1) or unknown\norigin (n = 7). Most children (84%) lived in traditional two-parent families\nwith married biological parents; others belonged to a blended family (5%), a\nhousehold with shared custody (2%), or a single-parent household (9%). In this\nstudy, we focused on the subsample of families for which both parents\nconsented to participate. Of the initial 556 families, data were available for\na final sample of 527 families due to some non-response.\n\n### Procedure\n\nWe used data on parenting collected in a Flemish large-scale study on social\ndeterminants of child psychosocial functioning including three cohorts: 8\u2013, 9\u2013\nand 10\u2013 year olds. To safeguard representativeness, a two-stage proportional\nstratified random sample of elementary school children enrolled in mainstream\nFlemish schools was drawn. In a first stage, 195 Flemish schools were randomly\nselected taking into account the distribution of schools across the five\nFlemish provinces and the Brussels region of which 55 schools agreed to\nparticipate. In a second stage, 913 children (2nd to 4th grade) were randomly\nselected within the participating schools. Parents received an introductory\nletter and consent form via the teachers. Informed consent to participate in\nthe study was obtained for 600 families with both parents participating for\n556 children. We used information on parenting practices collected from both\nparents. The parents received their questionnaires via the teacher during the\nsecond trimester and were asked to complete them individually and\nindependently of each other. Given that 583 mothers (98%), and 538 fathers\n(96%) actually completed the questionnaire, non-response was fairly low.\n\n### Measures\n\n#### Parental behavioral control\n\nParental behavioral control was operationalized via 19 items of the subscales\nRules (8 items; \u03b1_mother = 0.79; \u03b1_father = 0.82)), Discipline (6 items;\n\u03b1_mother = 0.78; \u03b1_father = 0.80) and Harsh Punishment (5 items; \u03b1_mother =\n0.76; \u03b1_father = 0.80) of the Ghent Parental Behavior Scale (Van Leeuwen and\nVermulst 2004). Each item was scored on a 5\u2013point Likert scale from 1 = never\ntrue to 5 = always true. The subscale Rules reflects the extent to which\nparents provide rules for their children\u2019s behavior (e.g., \u201cI teach my child\nthat it is important to behave properly\u201d; \u201cI teach my child to obey rules\u201d).\nThe subscale Discipline pertains to effective punishments after unwanted\nbehavior (e.g., \u2018...taking away something nice\u2019; \u2018... give him/her a chore for\npunishment); whereas the subscale Harsh Punishment points towards parental\nphysical punishment when children misbehave (e.g., \u201cI slap my child in the\nface when he/she misbehaves\u201d; \u201cI spank my child when he/she doesn\u2019t obey\nrules\u201d; \u201cI shake my child when we have a fight\u201d). We included multiple\nsubscales to represent the multidimensional nature of the behavioral control\ndimension, as demonstrated by others (Van Leeuwen and Vermulst 2004). In\naddition, we consider aspects of adequate (i.e., subscales Rules and\nDiscipline) and inadequate behavioral control (i.e., subscale Harsh\nPunishment) in this study, given the differential association with child\noutcomes. While the first has been linked to positive child development, the\nlatter has commonly been associated with negative child outcomes. Correlations\nbetween maternal and paternal reports were moderate for the subscales Rules (r\n= .31; p< .001) and Discipline (r = 0.47; p< 0.001), but strong for the\nsubscale Harsh Punishment (r = 0.52; p< 0.001). Within each parent, weak-to-\nmoderate positive correlations were found between the subscales Rules and\nDiscipline (r_mother = 0.32; r_father = 0.26; p< 0.001); weak positive\ncorrelations between the subscales Discipline and Harsh Punishment (r_mother =\n0.22; r_father = 0.22; p< 0.001); and small negative correlations between the\nsubscales Rules and Harsh Punishment (r_mother = \u22120.14, p = 0.009; r_father =\n\u22120.11; p= 0.001).\n\n#### Parental support\n\nParental support was operationalized by 11 items (1 = never true to 5 = always\ntrue) of the subscale Positive Parenting of the Ghent Parental Behavior Scale\n(Van Leeuwen and Vermulst 2004). This subscale (\u03b1_mother = 0.85; \u03b1_father =\n0.88) pertains to parental involvement, positive reinforcement and problem\nsolving (e.g., \u201cI make time to listen to my child, when he/she wants to tell\nme something\u201d; \u201cI give my child a compliment, hug, or a tap on the shoulder as\na reward for good behavior\u201d). Maternal and paternal reports were moderately\ncorrelated (r = 0.35, p< 0.001).\n\n#### Parental psychological control\n\nParents assessed their own psychologically controlling behavior by means of a\nDutch version of the Psychological Control Scale (Barber 1996; Kuppens et al.\n2009a) via a 5\u2013point Likert scale from 1 = never true to 5 = always true. This\nscale (\u03b1_mother = 0.70; \u03b1_father = 0.71) included 8 items pertaining to\ninvalidating feelings, constraining verbal expressions, personal attack, and\nlove withdrawal (e.g., \u201cI am less friendly with my child when (s)he doesn\u2019t\nsee things my way\u201d; \u201cIf my child has hurt my feelings, I don\u2019t speak to\nhim/her until (s)he pleases me again\u201d; \u201cI change the subject when my child has\nsomething to say\u201d). Correlations between maternal and paternal reports were\nmoderate (r = 0.32, p< 0.001).\n\n#### Child behavioral outcomes\n\nBoth parents completed the 20-item Dutch Strengths and Difficulties\nQuestionnaire (SDQ; van Widenfelt et al. 2003) using a 3\u2013point scale in order\nto assess child psychosocial behavior (0 = not true to 2 = certainly true).\nExternalizing problems were operationalized via the subscales Conduct Problems\n(5 items; \u03b1_mother = .60; \u03b1_father = 0.61) and Hyperactivity (5 items;\n\u03b1_mother = 0.80; \u03b1_father = 0.76), while internalizing problems were reflected\nby the subscale Emotional Symptoms (5 items; \u03b1_mother = 0.73; \u03b1_father =\n0.72). We also included the subscale on Prosocial Behavior (5 items; \u03b1_mother\n= 0.67; \u03b1_father = 0.64). Because high correlations (r= 0.54\u20130.71; p< 0.001)\nbetween mother and father reports was obtained, an average parental score was\ncreated for each subscale.\n\n### Data Analyses\n\nTo identify joint parenting styles, we conducted cluster analysis in MATLAB.\nCluster analysis is an overarching term for procedures used to identify groups\nor clusters of individuals based on their scores on a number of variables\n(Everitt et al. 2001). Greater similarity emerges between individuals of the\nsame cluster (or who lie geometrically closer according to some distance\nmeasure) than between individuals from different clusters (Steinly and Brusco\n2011). We first ran a cluster analysis based on the four parenting subscales\nof mothers and fathers (i.e., eight variables as input) that reflect parental\nsupport and parental behavioral control to identify joint parenting styles\nbased on these two parenting dimensions (i.e., without considering parental\npsychological control). To gain insight into the role of parental\npsychological control in identifying joint parenting styles, we subsequently\nconducted a cluster analysis on all five parenting subscales of mothers and\nfathers (i.e., ten variables as input) representing the three parenting\ndimensions.\n\nWe used the conceptual framework of Milligan for a stepwise implementation of\ncluster analysis (Steinly & Brusco 2011) by (1) determining the observations\nto be clustered; (2) selecting the variables to be included in the clustering\nprocedure; (3) determining whether and how the selected variables should be\nstandardized; (4) selecting a cluster algorithm and association measure (e.g.,\na distance measure); (5) determining the number of clusters; and (6)\nvalidating clustering (i.e., interpretation, testing, and replication). During\nsteps 1 through 3, we performed analyses on the sum scores of the different\nparenting subscales which were standardized to give each variable equal weight\nin the analysis. In step 4, we chose Mac Queens K\u2013means cluster algorithm\nwhich aims to identify K\u2013clusters with the largest possible between\u2013cluster\ndifferences and the smallest possible within\u2013cluster differences (Everitt et\nal. 2001), while the value of K is specified by the user. K-means consists of\na reallocation procedure by which persons, starting from an initial random or\nrational clustering, are reallocated in clusters as long as this yields a\ndecrease in the loss function (i.e., sum of squared Euclidean distance from\nthe corresponding cluster mean). Because the resulting clustering strongly\ndepends on the initial clustering (Steinley 2003), we used 1000 random starts\nand retained the clustering with the lowest loss function value. To determine\nthe optimal number of clusters in step 5, or in other words to define the\nvalue of K, we used the CHull procedure (Ceulemans and Kiers 2006; Wilderjans\net al. 2013). CHull is an automated model selection procedure that scans a\ncomplexity versus fit plot to find the model with the best complexity versus\nfit balance. Applied to K-means clustering, this means that we look for the\nmodel after which allowing for additional clusters does not substantially\ndecrease the loss function. To interpret the resulting clusters (step 6), we\nvisually inspected the pattern emerging in the cluster profile plots. When\ncomparing the cluster-specific profile scores between parents, we focused on\nthe position of the corresponding profile scores compared to zero (i.e., the\nstandardized mean of the sample) and differences in its substantial\ninterpretation. For example, the terms above and below average mean that a\nparent scores higher or lower than the standardized mean of the sample.\n\nTo assess the validity of the empirically identified joint parenting styles\nrepresenting all parenting dimensions, we examined their association with\nchild behavioral outcomes via four analyses of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS\nVersion 23 with the SDQ-subscales as dependent variables and the identified\njoint parenting styles based on the three parenting dimensions as the\nindependent variable. Analyses of residuals did not reveal meaningful\nviolations of model assumptions.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Results\n\nIn the following sections, the empirically identified joint parenting styles\nbased on the four subscales reflecting the two parenting dimensions \u2018support\u2019\nand \u2018behavioral control\u2019 are first presented; followed by the results of\nanalyses also considering \u2018parental psychological control\u2019 as input behavior.\nWe end with linking the identified joint parenting styles based on three\nparenting dimensions to child behavioral outcomes.\n\n### Clusters with Two Parenting Dimensions\n\nIn a first step, we conducted a K\u2013means cluster analysis on the maternal and\npaternal ratings only using the four parental support and behavioral support\nsubscales for each parent (i.e., eight variables) as input, representing the\ntwo parenting dimensions. The analysis was conducted for 1 to 8 clusters each\nwith a 1000 random starts. The corresponding number of clusters versus loss\nfunction plot is shown in Fig. Fig.1.1. Applying the CHull procedure to this\nplot pointed towards a solution with four clusters.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFig. 1\n\nNumber of clusters vs. loss function plots for the cluster analyses based on\nthe two parenting dimensions (left) and on the three parenting dimensions\n(right)\n\nParents belonging to the first cluster (Fig. (Fig.2)2) scored above average on\npositive parenting, rules and discipline; and scored below average on harsh\npunishment. A visual inspection of the cluster plot did not reveal notable\ndifferences between mothers and fathers. These parents show warmth and\ninvolvement in their interaction with their child, but at the same time set\nclear rules and expectations for children\u2019s behavior. They also discipline the\nchild\u2019s undesirable behavior, but rarely use strict physical punishment when\ndoing so. Because these parents demonstrate elevated support and (adequate)\nbehavioral control levels, we labeled this parenting style as the congruent\nauthoritative parenting style.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFig. 2\n\nCluster profiles of the analysis based on two parenting dimensions\n\nParents belonging to the second cluster (Fig. (Fig.2)2) also scored above\naverage on positive parenting and rules, but clearly below average on\neffective (subscale Discipline) and harsh disciplining (subscale Harsh\nPunishment). Based on a visual inspection, levels of positive parenting and\nproviding rules of mothers seemed somewhat higher, while effective discipline\nwas somewhat lower compared to fathers, but the substantive interpretation was\nsimilar across parents. These parents show warmth and involvement in their\nparenting while also setting clear rules for children\u2019s behavior, yet they\nhardly discipline their child in any manner after showing unwanted behavior.\nBecause these parents showed elevated support levels combined with aspects of\nbehavioral control that focus on promoting desired behavior (instead of\ndiscouraging unwanted behavior), we labeled this cluster as the congruent\npositive authoritative parenting style.\n\nThe third cluster (Fig. (Fig.2)2) included parents who scored clearly above\naverage on harsh punishment, above average on discipline, and below average on\npositive parenting and rules; without any notable visual differences between\nmothers and fathers. These parents are therefore less warm and involved in the\nrelationship with their child. Their parenting is particularly characterized\nby strict physical punishment following unwanted behavior, without setting\nclear rules for their children\u2019s behavior. This cluster reflected the\ncongruent authoritarian parenting style.\n\nA fourth cluster (Fig. (Fig.2)2) was identified that yielded below average\nscores for both parents on all subscales; without salient visual differences\nbetween mothers and fathers. These parents do not show marked warmth and\ninvolvement with their child, and also do not prominently provide rules or\ndiscipline unwanted behavior. Because these parents demonstrated below average\nscores on both dimensions, we labeled this cluster as a congruent uninvolved\nparenting style.\n\n### Clusters with Three Parenting Dimensions\n\nIn a second step, we performed the same K\u2013means cluster analysis, but now\npsychological control was included as a third parenting dimension. The\nanalysis was again conducted for 1 to 8 clusters each time using 1000 random\nstarts. Applying the CHull procedure to the number of clusters versus loss\nfunction plot (Fig. (Fig.1)1) pointed toward a solution with 2 or 3 clusters.\nHowever, to enable comparisons between the cluster solution based on the two\nparenting dimensions, we again selected the solution with four clusters of\nwhich the cluster profiles are visualized in Fig. Fig.33.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFig. 3\n\nCluster profiles of the analysis based on three parenting dimensions\n\nWhen comparing both cluster solutions, a remarkable similarity in the cluster\nprofiles was observed with the cluster scores on parental psychological\ncontrol for the congruent authoritative, congruent positive authoritative and\ncongruent authoritarian parenting styles covarying with scores on harsh\npunishment. These three clusters could thus be interpreted and labeled in a\nsimilar manner as earlier. For the congruent uninvolved parenting styles, the\npattern for parental support and behavioral control remained fairly unchanged,\nbut both showed slightly above-average psychological control scores. It seems\nthat these parents are thus less supportive and behavioral controlling, yet\nshowing somewhat elevated levels of psychologically intrusive practices. As\nsuch, we relabeled the congruent uninvolved cluster as a congruent intrusive\nparenting style. Adding the psychological control dimension slightly enlarged\nthe differences between the scores of mothers and fathers within each\nparenting style, but the substantive interpretation remained similar across\nparents\n\nGiven the substantial similarity in emerging parenting styles after including\ntwo or three parenting dimensions, we computed the agreement in classification\nof the corresponding parents. Analyses revealed that parents were generally\nassigned to the same parenting style if psychological control was taken into\naccount, (Cramer\u2019s V = .87). Note that the agreement was substantial\nregardless of the retained number of clusters (2 clusters: V= .77; 3 clusters:\nV= .86; 5 clusters: V= .83; 6 clusters: V= .69; 7 clusters: V= .68; 8\nclusters: V= .65).\n\n### Parenting Styles and Child Behavioral Outcomes\n\nThe four joint parenting styles were associated to significantly different\nbehavioral outcomes: Prosocial Behavior [F(3, 520) = 20.15, p< 0.001, R^2=\n0.10]; Hyperactivity [F(3, 520) = 12.98, p< 0.001, R^2= 0.07]; Emotional\nSymptoms [F(3, 520) = 3.77, p= .011, R^2= 0.02]; and Conduct Problems [F(3,\n520) = 20.15, p< 0.001, R^2= 0.10]. The mean subscale score per joint\nparenting style are presented in Fig. Fig.4.4. To gain more insight into the\nnature of the differences, pairwise contrasts (Tukey\u2013Kramer) were computed for\neach ANOVA.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFig. 4\n\nMean subscale scores on child behavioral outcomes per parenting style\n\nFor each child behavioral outcome, a significant difference (p < 0.05) was\nestablished between the congruent authoritarian parenting style and at least\none other parenting style. Children of authoritarian parents demonstrated more\nnegative (i.e., hyperactivity, conduct problems, emotional symptoms) and less\npositive (i.e., prosocial behavior) child outcomes compared to children whose\nparents belonged to another parenting style. For conduct problems, the\nassociated standardized mean difference involving authoritarian parents was\nmost pronounced compared to positive authoritative parents (d= 1.06, p<\n0.001), whereas a medium difference (range d= 0.67 \u2013 0.73, p< .001) with the\nauthoritative and intrusive parenting styles was found. Similarly, for\nhyperactivity standardized mean differences involving authoritarian parents\nwere large (d= 0.85, p< 0.001) compared to positive authoritative parents; and\nmedium (range d= 0.60 \u2013 0.63, p< 0.001) compared to authoritative and\nintrusive parents. Standardized mean differences involving authoritarian\nparents were large (range d= 0.83\u20130.93, p< 0.001) for prosocial behavior, but\nonly a small difference (d= 0.37, p= 0.031) with the intrusive parenting style\nemerged. Standardized mean differences for emotional symptoms between the\nauthoritarian parenting style were small in magnitude (range d= 0.40 \u2013 0.43,\np< 0.05), except for a non-significant (d= 0.28, p= 0.159) difference with the\nintrusive parenting style.\n\nIn addition, the congruent positive authoritative parenting style yielded\nsignificantly lower conduct problem levels in children (range d= 0.33 \u2013 0.39,\np< 0.05) compared to authoritative and intrusive parents. In contrast,\nsignificantly less prosocial child behavior (range d= 0.46\u20130.56, p\u2264 0.001) was\nfound for the congruent intrusive parenting style compared to (positive)\nauthoritative parents.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Discussion\n\nWith this study, we aimed to add to the parenting styles literature by\nidentifying empirically derived joint parenting styles based on data regarding\nthe three major parenting dimensions as perceived by both mothers and fathers\nraising elementary school children. These resulting joint parenting styles\nwere subsequently associated with child behavioral outcomes. As highlighted in\nthe introduction, the commonly used parenting typologies have a theoretical\nunderpinning, although empirical studies have generally identified three or\nfour similar parenting styles. Our empirically derived parenting styles based\non the two parenting dimensions Support and Behavioral Control bear\nresemblance to the initial authoritative, authoritarian, and neglectful\nparenting styles, yet some differences also emerged.\n\nThe authoritative parenting style was further broken down into a disciplinary\nand non-disciplinary subtype. Similarly, although differences between parents\nwithin each parenting style were minor, they were more pronounced for the non-\ndisciplinary than for the disciplinary control strategies. These findings\nhighlight that all parenting practices aimed at controlling, managing or\nregulating child behavior are not necessarily simultaneously used by the same\nparent, suggesting that considering a variety of parenting practices is\ncrucial to identifying naturally occurring parenting substyles. Some parents\nseem to provide clear rules, guidelines and expectations for child behavior,\nbut hardly have deviant child behavior followed by an effective disciplinary\nstrategy. One subgroup appears to reflect parents that mostly adopt positive\nparenting practices (i.e., high support, high rule setting), whereas another\nsubgroup uses a combination of positive (i.e., high support, high rule\nsetting) and negative (i.e., high effective discipline) parenting practices.\nThe latter closely resembles the authoritative parenting style as originally\ndefined (Baumrind 1966, 1967, 1971), while the former clustering aligns more\nwith a second\u2013order positive dimension obtained in research adopting a\nvariable\u2013oriented approach (Van Leeuwen et al. 2004).\n\nIn this study, the positive dimension tapped into parenting practices such as\nparental involvement, positive reinforcement, rule setting, and\nautonomy\u2013stimulating behavior, while the negative dimensions pertained to\nnegatively controlling efforts such as effective discipline, ignoring or harsh\npunishment following children\u2019s unwanted behavior. In the uninvolved parenting\nstyle, parenting practices bear a resemblance to the neglectful parenting\nstyle given the below average scores on all subscales suggesting that parents\nshow less warmth, place fewer restraints on and display little monitoring of\nchildren\u2019s behavior. However, we did not identify extreme low scores on\nparenting dimensions that would suggest a truly neglectful parenting style as\noriginally defined; thus an uninvolved parenting style seems a more\nappropriate label. Although parent self-reports could overestimate scores of\npositive parenting and underestimate scores of negative parenting due to\nsocial desirability bias, it should be noted that a previous study using\nadolescent reports also did not find extreme scores for the parenting style\nclusters (McKinney and Renk 2008).\n\nWe were not able to empirically identify the originally proposed permissive\nparenting style reflecting parents that are very loving, warm and involved\n(high support), yet have relatively few rules for children\u2019s behavior and\nhardly discipline (low behavioral control). This finding diverges from some\nprevious empirical studies in which the latter parenting style did emerge\nusing an a theoretical (Aunola et al. 2000; Carlson and Tanner 2006;\nShucksmith et al. 1995; Wolfradt et al. 2003) or empirical clustering approach\n(McKinney and Renk 2008). Our operationalization of the support dimension via\nthe positive parenting subscale of the Ghent Parental Behavior Scale could\nunderlie this divergent finding, because the subscale does not only pertain to\nwarm and responsive parenting practices, but also includes items on problem\nsolving. In contrast to other studies tapping only into warmth and\nresponsiveness, lower scores on solving problems together with the child can\nattenuate overall scores on parental support. As a result, the pronounced\nscores on parental support which typify a permissive parenting style may have\nbeen somewhat masked in the present study. Alternatively, the parent self-\nreports may not accurately reflect their actual parenting practices due to a\nsocial desirability bias, hampering the identification of the permissive\nparenting style.\n\nRegarding the role of psychological control in empirically deriving parenting\nstyles, cluster analyses revealed a very similar configuration with four\nparenting styles when parental psychological control was taken into account.\nThus, its addition did not lead to the identification of additional parenting\nstyles, but the third parenting dimension did enhance our understanding.\nResults clearly pointed toward a substantial overlap between parental\npsychological control and parental harsh punishment for the congruent\nauthoritarian, authoritative and positive authoritative parenting styles. This\nfinding coincides with research suggesting that inadequate behavior control\n(e.g., physical punishment) and psychological control by parents are\ncorrelated, whereas parental psychological control and adequate behavioral\ncontrol are considered orthogonal dimensions (Barber 1996; Gray andand\nSteinberg 1999; Steinberg 1990). For example, Pettit et al. (2001) found that\nparental psychological control was preceded in adolescence by harsh,\nrestrictive disciplinary parenting during childhood. Barber and Harmon (2002)\nhave further argued that parental psychological control may be a marker of a\nhostile and dysfunctional parent \u2013 child relationship, including the use of\nharsh disciplinary parenting practices.\n\nFor the congruent uninvolved parenting style, including parental psychological\ncontrol actually led to an improved understanding of the previously considered\nuninvolved parents. As it turned out these parents did use psychologically\ncontrolling strategies to some extent, regardless of their lower levels on the\nother parenting dimension. This pattern could mean that in the parents\u2013child\nrelationship these parents are not so much concerned with the child and their\nbehavior, but with manipulating children\u2019s thoughts, emotions, and feelings to\nfit their own. It is commonly recognized that by using psychologically\ncontrolling strategies, parents intrude into children\u2019s \u2018psychological world\u2019,\nexert parental authority over the children\u2019s own life, and intervene in the\nindividuation process (Barber and Xia 2013; Steinberg 2005). A recent study by\nZhang et al. (2015) also demonstrated that parental psychological control\nindeed positively correlated with parent\u2013centered intentions, implying that\nparents intend to satisfy their own needs by applying controlling behaviors\nwith their children.\n\nSeveral theories point towards differences in parenting between mother and\nfather (McKinney and Renk 2008). For example, psychoanalytic theory argues\nthat mothers are children\u2019s primary attachment figure whereas a greater\ndistance between fathers and their children occurs; the gender and role theory\nlink differences in child rearing to male and female characteristics (e.g.,\nexpressiveness and instrumentality) with the traditional mother role as caring\nfigures and fathers taking on the role of authority figure and family\nprovider. The literature also indicates that differences in parenting between\nmothers and fathers may arise if one parent wants to compensate for the other\nparent (Meteyer and Perry-Jenkins 2009; Simons and Conger 2007). Nonetheless,\nour results revealed more similarities than dissimilarities in the parenting\nstyles of both parents, despite small-to-moderate correlations between mother\nand father reports. These similarities may reflect an assortative process when\nchoosing a partner, meaning that people tend to look for a partner with\nsimilar characteristics (Botwin et al. 1997; Buss 1984, 1985; Larsen and Buss\n2010). Similarity in parenting could also result from socialization processes\n(Simons and Conger 2007); through a process of mutual influence or reciprocity\npartners gradually form similar views and beliefs on parenting. The slight\ndifferences that emerged pertained particularly to a dissimilar position on\npositive parenting and rule setting. Although less pronounced, this finding\naligns with the study by Meteyer and Perry-Jenkins (2009) that yielded\ncongruent parenting styles for mothers and fathers of 7-year old children,\nexcept for a dissimilar position on self-reported parental warmth. Another\nstudy using adolescent reports of parenting (McKinney and Renk 2008) found\nmore pronounced sex differences. Perhaps sex differences in parenting styles\nbecome more apparent as children grow older or when children\u2019s perspectives\nare considered.\n\nResults on associations between the joint parenting styles and child\nbehavioral outcomes indicated that children of two authoritarian parents\nshowed the poorest behavioral outcomes. These children were perceived as\nshowing significantly more internalizing and externalizing problem behavior\nand less prosocial behavior compared to children of parents adopting other\nparenting styles. In contrast, children of two positive authoritative parents\ndemonstrated the lowest levels of conduct problems. These findings could\nsuggest an additive effect in which the impact of similar parenting styles is\nreinforced as having two authoritarian and two positive authoritative parents\nwas associated with the least and most favorable child behavioral outcomes,\nrespectively.\n\nThe obtained associations between parenting styles and child behavioral\noutcomes partially align with previous research. Firstly, it has repeatedly\nbeen demonstrated that an authoritative parenting style coincides most with\npositive developmental outcomes in children (e.g., Aunola et al. 2000;\nBaumrind 1967, 1971, 1989, 1991, Darling and Steinberg 1993; Dornbusch et al.\n1987; Lamborn et al. 1991; Querido et al. 2002; Shucksmith et al. 1995;\nSteinberg et al. 1994; Steinberg et al. 1992). Our findings confirm this\npattern for the children having parents who employ an authoritative parenting\nstyle, but children with parents both using a positive authoritative parenting\nstyle even showed less conduct problems. This finding could point towards the\nvalue of rule setting \u2013 in contrast to disciplinary strategies \u2013 in preventing\nbehavioral problems. However, as parenting is a reciprocal process with\nchildren and parents mutually influencing each other, it is equally likely\nthat parents show less disciplinary strategies simply because their children\npose fewer behavior problems as demonstrated by others (Kerr et al. 2012;\nKuppens et al. 2009b; Laird et al. 2003).\n\nSecondly, previous research has repeatedly linked an authoritarian parenting\nstyle with externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in children\n(e.g., Hoeve et al. 2008; Lamborn et al. 1991; Steinberg et al. 1994; Williams\net al. 2009; Wolfradt et al. 2003). The present findings extend this body of\nresearch, although the association was most pronounced for externalizing\nbehavior problems which may be due to children\u2019s age (8 to 10 year olds). In\nyounger children, having authoritarian parents may be more strongly associated\nwith externalizing problem behavior, whereas the association with\ninternalizing problems only emerges as children grow older. The shift in the\nnature of behavior problems as children age has been linked to the physical,\ncognitive and social maturation of children and the associated changes in\nsocial demands and expectations.\n\nThirdly, the neglectful parenting style has been associated with the poorest\ndevelopmental outcomes in children (Baumrind 1991; Lamborn et al. 1991;\nMandara and Murray 2002; Shucksmith et al. 1995; Steinberg et al. 1994). As\nthis parenting style did not emerge in the present study, we were not able to\nmodel its association with child outcomes. Even children having parents who\nwere less involved, but intrusive, were doing better than children having\nauthoritarian parents. Findings did reveal that prosocial behavior and conduct\nproblems were significantly lower for children having parents who adopted an\nintrusive parenting style compared to children of (positive) authoritarian\nparents. This findings coincides with a growing body of evidence on the\ndeleterious of impact of psychologically controlling parenting in children and\nadolescents adopting a variable approach (Barber et al. 2005; Kuppens et al.\n2013; Soenens et al. 2012), but likewise extends this evidence-base with\nperson-oriented findings on the impact of an intrusive parenting style on\nchild development.\n\n### Limitations and Future Research\n\nAlthough the present study has several merits, it falls short in that only\nparent self-reports were used to assess parenting and child behavioral\noutcomes; children\u2019s perspective on their parenting practices may be quite\ndifferent. For example, Smetana (1995) found that adolescents perceived their\nparents as being more permissive and authoritarian compared to parents\u2019 own\nview on the matter, whereas parents perceived themselves as being more\nauthoritative than their adolescent children. Although a significant\nconvergence between child and parent reports on parenting dimensions has been\nestablished in elementary school (Kuppens et al. 2009a), future research\nshould explicitly take a multiple informant approach when identifying\nparenting styles as informant perspectives on parenting styles in this age\nperiod may differ. In a related vein, multiple informant assessments of child\nbehavioral problems have been shown to be context\u2013specific with differences\noccurring according to the context (e.g., home, school) that forms the basis\nfor informant\u2019s assessment (Achenbach et al. 1987). Involving informants other\nthan parents in the assessment of child behavioral outcomes therefore seems\nparticularly interesting in future research on parenting styles.\n\nFurthermore, inspecting a normally developing sample generally results into a\nlow occurrence of inadequate parenting practices and child behavioral\nproblems. Studying parenting styles in a clinical sample could certainly\nsupplement this view because more variation in parenting practices may yield\nmore or different parenting styles. Hoeve et al. (2008) have conducted one of\nthe few studies using a sample of children with a high or low risk of\nantisocial and behavioral problems; and they were able to identify a\nneglectful parenting style. In addition, the role of parental psychological\ncontrol in identifying parenting styles may be more pronounced in a clinical\nsample; an issue that to date remains unresolved.\n\nThe present sample closely resembled the population distribution with regard\nto family composition and paternal educational level, but it was rather\nhomogeneous for ethnicity and mothers were more highly educated. As such, the\npresent findings may not generalize to minority groups or families with less\neducated mothers; an issue that should be resolved by future studies. For\nexample, previous research has demonstrated that harsh punishment and\npsychological control are more common among lower SES parents (e.g., Eamon\n2001; El\u2010Sheikh et al. 2010) and that Caucasian caregivers were more prevalent\nin an authoritative parenting style cluster (van der Horst and Sleddens 2017).\nThe present study clearly complements the scarce body of research on naturally\noccurring joint parenting styles conducted in US samples, but additional\nresearch is needed to replicate these findings. Moreover, as parenting occurs\nwithin a cultural belief system that influences attitudes towards particular\nparenting practices (Durrant et al. 2003), cross-cultural research could\nfurther clarify the role of culture in identifying naturally occurring (joint)\nparenting styles incorporating three parenting dimensions. Finally, the cross-\nsectional associations among joint parenting styles and child outcomes should\nbe complemented by longitudinal research to gain more insight into the\ndirectionality of these associations. Longitudinal research covering the\nentire childhood and adolescence period could also increase our understanding\nof age-of-child and sex-of parent differences in naturally occurring parenting\nstyles.\n\nDespite these limitations, this study adds to the literature by further\nempirically validating well-known parenting styles and by increasing our\nunderstanding of the role of parental psychological control and joint\nparenting. The overlap between harsh punishment and parental psychological\ncontrol in congruent parenting styles and its unique role in the uninvolved\nparenting style suggests that this intrusive parenting dimension should be\nroutinely considered in practice settings. We also found that adequate\nbehavior controlling practices may be particularly interesting in preventing\nbehavioral problems; and that not only an authoritarian but also a\n(psychologically) intrusive parenting style can impede upon child development.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nSK: designed and executed the study, conducted part of the data-analysis, and\nwrote the paper.
