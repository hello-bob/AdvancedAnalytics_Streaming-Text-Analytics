Mapping the brain pathways of visual memorability\n\n# Mapping the brain pathways of visual memorability\n\nFor the first time, researchers use a combination of MEG and fMRI to map the\nspatio-temporal human brain dynamics of a visual image being recognized.\n\nRachel Gordon | MIT CSAIL\n\nPublication Date:\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nPress Inquiries\n\n### Press Contact:\n\nRachel Gordon\n\nEmail: rachelg@csail.mit.edu\n\nPhone: 617-258-0675\n\nMIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\n\nClose\n\nCaption:\n\nA team of MIT researchers found highly memorable images have stronger and\nsustained responses in ventro-occipital brain cortices, peaking at around\n300ms.

To do\nthis, they set out to map the spatio-temporal brain dynamics involved in\nrecognizing a visual image. And now for the first time, scientists harnessed\nthe combined strengths of magnetoencephalography (MEG), which captures the\ntiming of brain activity, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),\nwhich identifies active brain regions, to precisely determine when and where\nthe brain processes a memorable image.\n\nTheir open-access study, published this month in PLOS Biology, used 78 pairs\nof images matched for the same concept but differing in their memorability\nscores \u2014 one was highly memorable and the other was easy to forget. These\nimages were shown to 15 subjects, with scenes of skateboarding, animals in\nvarious environments, everyday objects like cups and chairs, natural\nlandscapes like forests and beaches, urban scenes of streets and buildings,\nand faces displaying different expressions. What they found was that a more\ndistributed network of brain regions than previously thought are actively\ninvolved in the encoding and retention processes that underpin memorability.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to remember some images better than others, even when they are\nconceptually similar, like different scenes of a person skateboarding,\u201d says\nBenjamin Lahner, an MIT PhD student in electrical engineering and computer\nscience, CSAIL affiliate, and first author of the study. \u201cWe've identified a\nbrain signature of visual memorability that emerges around 300 milliseconds\nafter seeing an image, involving areas across the ventral occipital cortex and\ntemporal cortex, which processes information like color perception and object\nrecognition. This signature indicates that highly memorable images prompt\nstronger and more sustained brain responses, especially in regions like the\nearly visual cortex, which we previously underestimated in memory processing.\u201d\n\nWhile highly memorable images maintain a higher and more sustained response\nfor about half a second, the response to less memorable images quickly\ndiminishes. This insight, Lahner elaborated, could redefine our understanding\nof how memories form and persist. The team envisions this research holding\npotential for future clinical applications, particularly in early diagnosis\nand treatment of memory-related disorders.\n\nThe MEG/fMRI fusion method, developed in the lab of CSAIL Senior Research\nScientist Aude Oliva, adeptly captures the brain's spatial and temporal\ndynamics, overcoming the traditional constraints of either spatial or temporal\nspecificity. The fusion method had a little help from its machine-learning\nfriend, to better examine and compare the brain's activity when looking at\nvarious images. They created a \u201crepresentational matrix,\u201d which is like a\ndetailed chart, showing how similar neural responses are in various brain\nregions. This chart helped them identify the patterns of where and when the\nbrain processes what we see.\n\nPicking the conceptually similar image pairs with high and low memorability\nscores was the crucial ingredient to unlocking these insights into\nmemorability. Lahner explained the process of aggregating behavioral data to\nassign memorability scores to images, where they curated a diverse set of\nhigh- and low-memorability images with balanced representation across\ndifferent visual categories.\n\nDespite strides made, the team notes a few limitations. While this work can\nidentify brain regions showing significant memorability effects, it cannot\nelucidate the regions' function in how it is contributing to better\nencoding/retrieval from memory.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the neural underpinnings of memorability opens up exciting\navenues for clinical advancements, particularly in diagnosing and treating\nmemory-related disorders early on,\u201d says Oliva. \u201cThe specific brain signatures\nwe've identified for memorability could lead to early biomarkers for\nAlzheimer's disease and other dementias. This research paves the way for novel\nintervention strategies that are finely tuned to the individual's neural\nprofile, potentially transforming the therapeutic landscape for memory\nimpairments and significantly improving patient outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese findings are exciting because they give us insight into what is\nhappening in the brain between seeing something and saving it into memory,\u201d\nsays Wilma Bainbridge, assistant professor of psychology at the University of\nChicago, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe researchers here are picking\nup on a cortical signal that reflects what's important to remember, and what\ncan be forgotten early on.\u201d\n\nLahner and Oliva, who is also the director of strategic industry engagement at\nthe MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, MIT director of the MIT-IBM Watson AI\nLab, and CSAIL principal investigator, join Western University Assistant\nProfessor Yalda Mohsenzadeh and York University researcher Caitlin Mullin on\nthe paper.
