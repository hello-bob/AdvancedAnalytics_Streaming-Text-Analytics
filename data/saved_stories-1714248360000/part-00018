We applaud this decision to\nkeep the internet open and accessible to all, and reverse the 2018 roll-back\nof net neutrality protections. Alongside our many partners and allies, Mozilla\nhas been a long time proponent of net neutrality across the world and in U.S.\nstates, and mobilized hundreds of thousands of people over the years.\n\nThe new FCC order reclassifies broadband internet as a \u201ctelecommunications\nservice\u201d and prevents ISPs from blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization\nof traffic. This action restores meaningful and enforceable FCC oversight and\nprotection on the internet, and unlocks innovation, competition, and free\nexpression online.\n\nYou can read Mozilla\u2019s submission to the FCC on the proposed Safeguarding and\nSecuring the Open Internet rules in December 2023 here and additional reply\ncomments in January 2024 here.\n\nNet neutrality and openness are essential parts of how we experience the\ninternet, and as illustrated during the COVID pandemic, can offer important\nprotections \u2013 so it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that such a majority of\nAmericans support it. Yesterday\u2019s decision reaffirms the internet is and\nshould remain a public resource, where companies cannot abuse their market\npower to the detriment of consumers, and where actors large and small operate\non a level playing field.\n\nEarlier this month, Mozilla participated in a roundtable discussion with\nexperts and allies hosted by Chairwoman Rosenworcel at the Santa Clara County\nFire Department. The event location highlighted the importance of net\nneutrality, as the site where Verizon throttled firefighters\u2019 internet speeds\nin the midst of fighting a raging wildfire. You can watch the full press\nconference below, and read coverage of the event here.\n\nWe thank the FCC for protecting these vital net neutrality safeguards, and we\nlook forward to seeing the details of the final order when released.\n\n#### More articles in \u201cTelecom\u201d\n\n  * ##### Global Network Fee Proposals are Troubling.
