I was super happy with the choice and the screen\u2019s\nlook.\n\nI found a new screen still for sale for double the price so I messaged the\nguy, but I wasn\u2019t lowballing too much. By then, I already saw myself having\nthe screen in my study.\n\nThe guy accepted my $15 less offer and I drove to nearby town to pick it up.\nSo far so good.\n\nThe screen looked great but I made a mistake. I didn\u2019t even want to see the\nscreen on. I just took the guy\u2019s word for it, gave him the money, loaded the\nscreen into my car and headed home. I was still thinking I was getting an\namazing deal.\n\nTo be fair, I had a great experience buying second-hand electronics recently,\nwhich made me feel like buying second-hand stuff is a risk-free activity.\n\nWhen I connected the screen at home to my M1 Max 16\" Mac, the text was blurry.\nBlurry!\n\nI thought it had to be the cable, so I ordered five different cables (display\nport, USB-C 4, thunderbolt, HDMI) to try them. The next day, I tried them one\nby one and found that the issue was in MacOS.\n\nI tried to return the screen to the guy, but he stopped taking my calls.\n\nShortly after, I found that a brand-new model could be bought only for a few\ndollars more. That lowered the price I could re-sell the screen for.\n\nWhen I realised I had become a seller instead of a buyer, my mindset changed.\nAnd this mindset is something I want to remember and talk about.\n\nWhen I\u2019m about to buy something new, I\u2019m excited. I see myself using the thing\nand I\u2019m in a state of mind where the thing is the missing piece to my\nhappiness and once I get it, my life will be amazing. This is never the case\nbut I feel that way.\n\nI buy the thing, excitedly unpack it, play with it for a while and then it\nstarts gathering dust. The dust gathering is especially strong if it didn\u2019t\nreplace an item I use daily (e.g. laptop, phone, or watch).\n\nIf I use it seldom enough, I\u2019ll try to sell it and the difference between how\nI feel when I\u2019m selling it couldn\u2019t be bigger.\n\nbuying| selling  \n---|---  \nprice| The price is a bargain| I\u2019ll sell it for much less to get it off my\nhands  \nutility| I need it so much| I\u2019m not using it. It has a low value  \nvalue to others| everyone needs one| nobody will probably want this  \n  \nThere is a new behaviour that I\u2019d like to try. Imagine that I already have the\nthing and try to sell it before I buy it.\n\n  * Go to Craigslist and see what the selling \u201ccompetition\u201d is. How much lower I\u2019ll have to go with the price?\n  * Imagine dealing with people who are lowballing me + all the spam that\u2019s happening on the FB marketplace\n\n## What helps with taming the buy beast\n\n  * Buy things second-hand (when I\u2019m inevitably selling, the value won\u2019t drop as much as for a new thing)\n  * Buy common items with a large customer base (they are easy to sell quickly). I still remember buying a niche Ergodox EZ keyboard for $450 and then trying to sell it in the small Czech market.\n  * Try to mainly replace existing items (laptop, headphones, phone, watch..). That way, you know you\u2019ll be using the thing.\n\n#### New article updates\n\nWhen I write a larger post, I'll send you an email.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Tomas Vik. RSS feed\n\nGenerated by Hugo.
