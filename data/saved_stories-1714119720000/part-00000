This is called a gene-environment interaction.\"\n\nThe findings build on decades of research by UCLA Health investigators Drs.\nJeff Bronstein and Beate Ritz into the associations between pesticide exposure\nand Parkinson's disease risk in the Central Valley.\n\nThe study's co-lead author and assistant professor of Neurology at UCLA, Dr.\nKimberly Paul, said that Parkinson's disease is the fastest growing\nneurodegenerative disease in the world. While an increase in the number of new\npatients is expected given the large aging population in the U.S., the rate of\nnew Parkinson's disease patients is outpacing the rate that is expected from\naging alone, Paul said.\n\nPaul said the findings of the new study raise the question of whether there\nare other genetic variants that may be altering the susceptibility to\nParkinson's disease among this population, including other biological pathways\naffected by different types of pesticides.\n\n\"These patients were susceptible somehow and if we can figure out why they\nwere susceptible, maybe we can act on those pathways,\" Paul said.\n\n\"There are data for a lot of common disorders suggesting that environmental\ninfluences impact the development of these diseases, but we don't yet have a\ngood way of measuring that impact or determining who is specifically at risk,\"\nFogel said. \"This is a step forward in that direction.\"\n\nMore information: Lysosomal Genes Contribute to Parkinson's Disease near\nAgriculture with High Intensity Pesticide Use, npj Parkinson's Disease (2024).\nDOI: 10.1038/s41531-024-00703-4. www.nature.com/articles/s41531-024-00703-4\n\nJournal information: npj Parkinson's Disease\n\nProvided by University of California, Los Angeles\n\nCitation: Genetic variations may predispose people to Parkinson's disease\nfollowing long-term pesticide exposure, study finds (2024, April 25) retrieved\n25 April 2024 from https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-genetic-variations-\npredispose-people-parkinson.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
