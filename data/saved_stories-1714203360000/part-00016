The move comes after 404 Media\nreported on the service, called Spy Pet, last week and verified it was selling\naccess to genuine user messages ripped from Discord servers.\n\nSince then, and especially over the last several days, the number of servers\nthat Spy Pet says it collects data from has fluctuated, dropping from around\n14,000 to 12,000, before eventually on Thursday reaching zero. As of Friday,\nthe Spy Pet website is also unavailable, and Discord says it is considering\nlegal action against the site.\n\n## This post is for paid members only\n\nBecome a paid member for unlimited ad-free access to articles, bonus podcast\ncontent, and more.\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Sign up for free access to this post\n\nFree members get access to posts like this one along with an email round-up of\nour week's stories.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAlready have an account?
