By crafting requests with conflicting\nTransfer-Encoding headers, attackers can bypass security restrictions and\naccess restricted endpoints. This issue is due to Gunicorn's handling of\nTransfer-Encoding headers, where it incorrectly processes requests with\nmultiple, conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, treating them as chunked\nregardless of the final encoding specified. This vulnerability has been shown\nto allow access to endpoints restricted by gunicorn. This issue has been\naddressed in version 22.0.0.\n\nTo be affected users must have a network path which does not filter out\ninvalid requests. These users are advised to block access to restricted\nendpoints via a firewall or other mechanism if they are unable to update.\n\n### References\n\n  * https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1135\n  * https://huntr.com/bounties/22158e34-cfd5-41ad-97e0-a780773d96c1\n  * benoitc/gunicorn@ac29c9b\n  * https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/releases/tag/22.0.0\n\nPublished by the National Vulnerability Database Apr 16, 2024\n\nPublished to the GitHub Advisory Database Apr 16, 2024\n\nReviewed Apr 16, 2024\n\nLast updated Apr 16, 2024\n\n### Severity\n\nHigh\n\n8.2\n\n/ 10\n\n#### CVSS base metrics\n\nAttack vector\n\nNetwork\n\nAttack complexity\n\nLow\n\nPrivileges required\n\nNone\n\nUser interaction\n\nNone\n\nScope\n\nUnchanged\n\nConfidentiality\n\nLow\n\nIntegrity\n\nHigh\n\nAvailability\n\nNone\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nCWE-444\n\n### CVE ID\n\nCVE-2024-1135\n\n### GHSA ID\n\nGHSA-w3h3-4rj7-4ph4\n\n### Source code\n\nbenoitc/gunicorn\n\nThis advisory has been edited.
