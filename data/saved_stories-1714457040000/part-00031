These\ninterfaces operate like slot machines at a casino, providing a dopamine boost\nevery few seconds. The goal is to keep users\u2019 eyes glued to their screens\u2014thus\nmaximizing advertising revenues.\n\nThe leader in this movement is TikTok. But the other major platforms\n(Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) are imitating its fast-paced\nvideo reels.\n\nMy articles have stirred up discussion and debate\u2014especially about the impact\nof slot machine-ish social media platforms on youngsters.\n\nSo I decided to dig into the available data on children and social media. And\nit was even worse than I feared.\n\n####\n\nIf you want to support my work, the best way is by taking out a premium\nsubscription (for just $6 per month).\n\nChild with smartphone (Andi Graf)\n\n###\n\n30% of children ages 5 through 7 are using TikTok\u2014despite the platform\u2019s\npolicy that you can\u2019t sign up until age 13.\n\nThe story gets worse. The numbers are rising rapidly\u2014usage among this\nvulnerable group jumped 5% in just one year.\n\nBy the way, almost a quarter of children in this demographic have a\nsmartphone. More than three-quarters use a tablet computer.\n\nSource: Ofcom\n\nThese figures come from Ofcom, a UK-based regulatory group. I\u2019ll let you\ndecide how applicable they are to other countries. My hunch is that the\nsituation in the US is even worse, but that\u2019s just an educated guess based on\nhaving lived in both countries.\n\n###\n\nWhat happened in 2010?\n\nOne thing is certain\u2014the mental health of youths in both the US and UK is\ndeteriorating rapidly. There are dozens of ways of measuring the crisis, but\nthey all tell the same tragic story.\n\nSomething happened around 2010, and it\u2019s destroying millions of lives.\n\nSource: Financial Times\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the timeline for global smartphone usage. This also\naccelerated around 2010.\n\nSource: Gartner/Statista\n\nApologists for TikTok will tell you that these mental health problems are\nmerely correlated with excessive screen time and that does not prove\ncausation. Well, yes, of course, but...I will simply ask you to judge the\nplausibility of that defense based on your own common sense observations and\nlife experiences.\n\nTheir defense would be more plausible if youngsters were spending only a small\nportion of their day online. So let\u2019s look at more data on how they allocate\ntheir time.\n\n###\n\nAs early as age 11, children are spending more than four hours per day online.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison of time spent online by age. Even before they reach their\nteens, youngsters are spending more than four hours per day staring into a\nscreen.\n\nSource: Ofcom\n\nHere\u2019s what a day in the digital life of a typical 9-year-old girl looks like.\n\nSource: Ofcom\n\nI don\u2019t find any of this amusing. But if you\u2019re looking for dark humor, I\u2019ll\npoint to the four minutes spent on the Duolingo language training app at the\nend of the day. This provides an indicator of the relative role of learning in\nthe digital regimen on the rising generation.\n\n###\n\nEven five year olds are immersed in streaming and scrolling interfaces.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at even younger children. Here\u2019s a glimpse at the digital life\nof a child aged 5 through 7.\n\nSource: Ofcom\n\n###\n\nAround 20% of five year olds have their own phone, and almost all children do\nby age 12.\n\nThe role of digital media increases dramatically between ages 8 and 12.\n\nSource: Ofcom\n\nBy the way, more than 20% of underage users have an adult profile which allows\nthem to access all content on these platforms.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\n####\n\nRELATED ARTICLES:\n\nI Ask Seven Heretical Questions About Progress\n\nWhere Did TikTok Come From?\n\nThe State of the Culture, 2024\n\nI Receive a Letter from a High School Student\n\nNotes Toward a New Romanticism\n\nThirteen Observations on Ritual\n\nHow to Break Free from Dopamine Culture\n\nSkeptics can pretend this is all quite normal. But, judging by the feedback\nI\u2019m getting, the vast majority of adults have already lost trust in the\ntechnocracy. They are deeply troubled by what the dominant platforms are doing\nto society, especially vulnerable children.\n\nThey know that a terrible crisis is underway, and blame tech leaders and their\napologists\u2014who are destroying the next generation in pursuit of profits.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it before. There was a time when tobacco companies denied that\nsmoking caused cancer. (Their argument\u2014that correlation does not prove\ncausation\u2014will sound familiar.)\n\nThat was too bad for all the people who died because of that smokescreen\nargument (literally and figuratively). There was also a time when\ncorporations\u2014and the US government!\u2014issued propaganda to support the use of\nDDT and other dangerous pesticides. We\u2019ve seen the same narrative spinning in\nso many other business: asbestos, automobiles, opioids, etc.\n\nBut you should always follow the money.\n\nAcademics who defended smoking took big cash from Big Tobacco. You should\ncheck out how much tobacco money went to distinguished statisticians back\nthen\u2014who would ever have guessed that these STEM academics could be corrupted\nby cash?\n\nI believe we are at a similar juncture right now.\n\nWe will eventually have access to peer-reviewed, longitudinal studies with\ntightly defined control groups. Along the way, statisticians getting funded by\ntech, and their fellow travelers, will try to obfuscate as much as they can.\nBut wise parents\u2014who live in the real world, not academia\u2014are already taking\nprudent steps.\n\nThat\u2019s what parenting is all about.\n\nIt would be nice if the government and tech billionaires (now lining up to buy\nTikTok) helped them out. But since so much money is at stake, parents will\nprobably have to fight this battle on their own.\n\nThe rest of us should support them as best we can. A good starting point is to\nspeak honestly and forthrightly about what tech is actually doing in our\ncommunities. I\u2019ll certainly be writing more about this in the future.\n\n### Subscribe to The Honest Broker\n\nBy Ted Gioia \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nA trustworthy guide to music, books, arts, media & culture by Ted Gioia\n\n386\n\nShare this post\n\n#### 30% of Children Ages 5-7 Are on TikTok\n\nwww.honest-broker.com\n\n73\n\nShare\n\n73 Comments\n\nAlex FoxTechnoskeptical23 hrs agoI did some graduate research on this\nrecently.
