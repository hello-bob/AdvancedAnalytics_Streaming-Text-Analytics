The company disclosed that GPT-4 is\nlarger but hasn\u2019t yet shared specific numbers. Some reports suggest that\nOpenAI\u2019s flagship LLM includes 1.76 trillion parameters while Google LLC\u2019s\nGemini Ultra, which has comparable performance to GPT-4, reportedly features\n1.6 trillion.\n\nThat Microsoft\u2019s MAI-1 reportedly comprises 500 billion parameters suggests it\ncould be positioned as a kind of midrange option between GPT-3 and ChatGPT-4.\nSuch a configuration would allow the model to provide high response accuracy,\nbut using significantly less power than OpenAI\u2019s flagship LLM. That would\ntranslate into lower inference costs for Microsoft.\n\nAccording to The Information, the development of MAI-1 is being overseen by\nMustafa Suleyman, the founder of LLM developer Inflection AI Inc. Suleyman\njoined Microsoft in March along with most of the startup\u2019s employees through a\ndeal reportedly worth $625 million. The executive earlier co-founded Google\nLLC\u2019s DeepMind AI research group.\n\nMicrosoft may reportedly use training data and certain other assets from\nInflection AI to power MAI-1. The model\u2019s training dataset is said to include\ntypes of information as well, including text generated by GPT-4 and web\ncontent. Microsoft is reportedly carrying out the development process using a\n\u201clarge cluster of servers\u201d equipped with Nvidia Corp. graphics cards.\n\nThe Information\u2019s sources indicated that the company hasn\u2019t yet determined how\nit will use MAI-1. If the model indeed features 500 billion parameters, it\u2019s\ntoo complex to run on consumer devices. That means Microsoft will most likely\ndeploy MAI-1 in its data centers, where the LLM could be integrated into\nservices such as Bing and Azure.\n\nIt\u2019s believed the company could debut MAI-1 during its Build developer\nconference, which will kick off on May 16, if the model shows sufficient\npromise by then. That hints the company expects to have a working prototype of\nthe model within a few weeks, if it doesn\u2019t have one already.\n\nThe news that Microsoft is developing MAI-1 comes less than two weeks after it\nopen-sourced a language model dubbed Pi-3 Mini. According to the company, the\nlatter model features 3.8 billion parameters and can outperform LLMs more than\n10 times its size. Pi-3 is part of an AI series that also includes two other,\nlarger neural networks with slightly better performance.\n\n##### Photo: Microsoft\n\n# A message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\n\n### Your vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content\nFREE.\n\n### One click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant\ncontent.\n\n### Join our community on YouTube\n\n### Join the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts,\nincluding Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael\nDell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\u201cTheCUBE is an important partner to the industry.
