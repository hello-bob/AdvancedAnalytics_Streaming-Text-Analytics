They acquired a panoramic mosaic of the Saturn system that\nallows scientists to see details in the rings and throughout the system as\nthey are backlit by the sun. This mosaic is special as it marks the third time\nour home planet was imaged from the outer solar system; the second time it was\nimaged by Cassini from Saturn's orbit; and the first time ever that\ninhabitants of Earth were made aware in advance that their photo would be\ntaken from such a great distance.\n\nWith both Cassini's wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras aimed at Saturn,\nCassini was able to capture 323 images in just over four hours. This final\nmosaic uses 141 of those wide-angle images. Images taken using the red, green\nand blue spectral filters of the wide-angle camera were combined and mosaicked\ntogether to create this natural-color view. A brightened version with contrast\nand color enhanced (Figure 1), a version with just the planets annotated\n(Figure 2), and an annotated version (Figure 3) are shown above.\n\nThis image spans about 404,880 miles (651,591 kilometers) across.\n\nThe outermost ring shown here is Saturn's E ring, the core of which is\nsituated about 149,000 miles (240,000 kilometers) from Saturn. The geysers\nerupting from the south polar terrain of the moon Enceladus supply the fine\nicy particles that comprise the E ring; diffraction by sunlight gives the ring\nits blue color. Enceladus (313 miles, or 504 kilometers, across) and the\nextended plume formed by its jets are visible, embedded in the E ring on the\nleft side of the mosaic.\n\nAt the 12 o'clock position and a bit inward from the E ring lies the barely\ndiscernible ring created by the tiny, Cassini-discovered moon, Pallene (3\nmiles, or 4 kilometers, across). (For more on structures like Pallene's ring,\nsee PIA08328). The next narrow and easily seen ring inward is the G ring.\nInterior to the G ring, near the 11 o'clock position, one can barely see the\nmore diffuse ring created by the co-orbital moons, Janus (111 miles, or 179\nkilometers, across) and Epimetheus (70 miles, or 113 kilometers, across).\nFarther inward, we see the very bright F ring closely encircling the main\nrings of Saturn.\n\nFollowing the outermost E ring counter-clockwise from Enceladus, the moon\nTethys (662 miles, or 1,066 kilometers, across) appears as a large yellow orb\njust outside of the E ring. Tethys is positioned on the illuminated side of\nSaturn; its icy surface is shining brightly from yellow sunlight reflected by\nSaturn. Continuing to about the 2 o'clock position is a dark pixel just\noutside of the G ring; this dark pixel is Saturn's Death Star moon, Mimas (246\nmiles, or 396 kilometers, across). Mimas appears, upon close inspection, as a\nvery thin crescent because Cassini is looking mostly at its non-illuminated\nface.\n\nThe moons Prometheus, Pandora, Janus and Epimetheus are also visible in the\nmosaic near Saturn's bright narrow F ring. Prometheus (53 miles, or 86\nkilometers, across) is visible as a faint black dot just inside the F ring and\nat the 9 o'clock position. On the opposite side of the rings, just outside the\nF ring, Pandora (50 miles, or 81 kilometers, across) can be seen as a bright\nwhite dot. Pandora and Prometheus are shepherd moons and gravitational\ninteractions between the ring and the moons keep the F ring narrowly confined.\nAt the 11 o'clock position in between the F ring and the G ring, Janus (111\nmiles, or 179 kilometers, across) appears as a faint black dot. Janus and\nPrometheus are dark for the same reason Mimas is mostly dark: we are looking\nat their non-illuminated sides in this mosaic. Midway between the F ring and\nthe G ring, at about the 8 o'clock position, is a single bright pixel,\nEpimetheus. Looking more closely at Enceladus, Mimas and Tethys, especially in\nthe brightened version of the mosaic, one can see these moons casting shadows\nthrough the E ring like a telephone pole might cast a shadow through a fog.\n\nIn the non-brightened version of the mosaic, one can see bright clumps of ring\nmaterial orbiting within the Encke gap near the outer edge of the main rings\nand immediately to the lower left of the globe of Saturn. Also, in the dark B\nring within the main rings, at the 9 o'clock position, one can see the faint\noutlines of two spoke features, first sighted by NASA's Voyager spacecraft in\nthe early 1980s and extensively studied by Cassini.\n\nFinally, in the lower right of the mosaic, in between the bright blue E ring\nand the faint but defined G ring, is the pale blue dot of our planet, Earth.\nLook closely and you can see the moon protruding from the Earth's lower right.\n(For a higher resolution view of the Earth and moon taken during this\ncampaign, see PIA14949.) Earth's twin, Venus, appears as a bright white dot in\nthe upper left quadrant of the mosaic, also between the G and E rings. Mars\nalso appears as a faint red dot embedded in the outer edge of the E ring,\nabove and to the left of Venus.\n\nFor ease of visibility, Earth, Venus, Mars, Enceladus, Epimetheus and Pandora\nwere all brightened by a factor of eight and a half relative to Saturn. Tethys\nwas brightened by a factor of four. In total, 809 background stars are visible\nand were brightened by a factor ranging from six, for the brightest stars, to\n16, for the faintest. The faint outer rings (from the G ring to the E ring)\nwere also brightened relative to the already bright main rings by factors\nranging from two to eight, with the lower-phase-angle (and therefore fainter)\nregions of these rings brightened the most. The brightened version of the\nmosaic was further brightened and contrast-enhanced all over to accommodate\nprint applications and a wide range of computer-screen viewing conditions.\n\nSome ring features -- such as full rings traced out by tiny moons -- do not\nappear in this version of the mosaic because they require extreme computer\nenhancement, which would adversely affect the rest of the mosaic. This version\nwas processed for balance and beauty.\n\nThis view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 17 degrees below\nthe ring plane. Cassini was approximately 746,000 miles (1.2 million\nkilometers) from Saturn when the images in this mosaic were taken. Image scale\non Saturn is about 45 miles (72 kilometers) per pixel.\n\nThis mosaic was made from pictures taken over a span of more than four hours\nwhile the planets, moons and stars were all moving relative to Cassini. Thus,\ndue to spacecraft motion, these objects in the locations shown here were not\nin these specific places over the entire duration of the imaging campaign.\nNote also that Venus appears far from Earth, as does Mars, because they were\non the opposite side of the sun from Earth.\n\nThe Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European\nSpace Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a\ndivision of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the\nmission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini\norbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at\nJPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nFor more information about the Cassini-Huygens mission visit\nhttp://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov and http://www.nasa.gov/cassini.
