He copied someone else's work.\n\nBryan Lunduke\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nGo to any search engine and type in, \"Who invented HTML\" and you'll -- almost\nalways -- be given the following answer (or some variation on it):\n\n> \"HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee.\"\n\nWant to know a little secret? That is utter hogwash.\n\n\"Heresy,\" you proclaim! \"Everyone knows Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who was knighted\nby the Queen and won of the Turing Award, created the HyperText Markup\nLanguage! You better have some serious proof to backup such an outlandish\nclaim!\"\n\nChallenge accepted.\n\nTo start with, let's look at a simple HTML document.\n\nHTML. I think? Maybe?\n\nOh, wait. Hold up. I accidentally used the wrong screenshot. That's not\nHTML... that's SGML. A totally different language used several years before\nHTML.\n\nHere. Let me post an HTML screenshot.\n\nOr is it the other way around?\n\nDagnabbit! I did it again! This time I accidentally posted a picture showing\nan HTML sample next to an SGML sample!\n\nFunny. They look exactly the same.\n\n### What the heck is SGML?\n\nSGML -- the Standard Generalized Markup Language (aka ISO 8879) -- was set as\na standard back in 1986... 7 years before the release of the HTML 1.0\nspecification.\n\nOver in Switzerland, at CERN (\"Conseil europ\u00e9en pour la Recherche nucl\u00e9aire\"\naka \"European Organization for Nuclear Research\"), Anders Berglund adopted\nSGML primarily for usage in formatting documentation.\n\nTitle page of the CERN SGML User's Guide\n\nThat variation on SGML -- dubbed \"SGMLguid\" -- remained in usage at CERN for\nseveral years. And, in 1987, Tim Berners-Lee was hired as a contractor at\nCERN.\n\nWhere, wouldn't you know it, part of Tim's job was using that CERN\nimplementation of SGML.\n\nA few years later, HTML was born. Just to jog your memory, here is a document\nmarked up in both Tim's HTML 1.0... and the CERN variant of SGML.\n\nMic drop.\n\nFind the difference. I dare ya.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that Sir Tim Berners-Lee directly copied HTML from SGML\n(and the implementation that Anders Berglund made of it)... wait... yes. Yes,\nI am. I am saying exactly that.\n\nHTML is a copy.\n\n### That's not entirely fair to Sir Tim.\n\nIn defense of Sir Tim, Knight of Her Majesty the Queen, he did do more than\nsimply make a copy of SGML when \"creating\" HTML.\n\nIn fact, Sir Tim made three -- very important -- changes to SGML in order to\nmake it HTML:\n\n  1. He added the \"a href\" link tag.\n  2. He changed the file extension from \".sgml\" to \".html\".\n  3. He implemented an SGML parser which only implemented a little over a dozen tags from SGML... and ignored the rest. And called it \"HTML\".\n\nWhile item 1 (the HREF tag) is a noteworth change over SGML, items 2 and 3\n(which are very real) only serve to reinforce the fact that HTML is -- for the\nmost part -- simply a copy of an existing SGML implementation. And a less\nfunctional one at that.\n\nAs an example, here is the very first HTML document ever written. Which, other\nthan the usge of HREF, is identical to SGML.\n\nThe very first HTML document, written by Sir Tim Berners-Lee - December 3rd,\n1990\n\nChange that \"href\" tag to something which SGML recognizes -- such as a\ndifferent \"Anchor\" type (which is what the \"a\" stands for in \"a href\") -- and\nthis instantly becomes a valid SGML document.\n\n### But... HyperText! That's important!\n\nWhile the addition of a standardized way of including simple looking HyperText\nAnchors (aka \"links\" or \"a href\") was a welcome addition to SGML... that was,\nat the time, the only significant change which Sir Tim implemented in his SGML\ncopy known as HTML.\n\n(Other than changing the file extension to \".html\", of course. That was\npretty... important. *cough*)\n\nBack in the late 1980s, people were adding HyperText (and linking between\n\"documents\") everywhere. Shoot. Apple already had a fully graphical HyperText\nsystem known as HyperCard.\n\nHyperCard 1.0\n\nIn fact, nearly every major On-Line service of the day included some form of\nlinking between documents.\n\nWith the HyperText hype train fully underway -- across the entire computing\nuniverse -- it was only natural that any update to -- or copy of -- SGML would\ninclude that functionality.\n\nSo... yes. Sir Tim Berners-Lee adding \"HREF\" to SGML was important. But,\notherwise, HTML was little more than a direct copy of existing work.\n\n### None of this is disputed.\n\nThese are historical facts that are well documented. Shoot. The W3C, itself,\nagrees with everything I said above.\n\nSo why, then, is this important to talk about any of this?\n\nBecause the getting history right is important.\n\nThe ridiculous myth that \"Tim Beners-Lee invented HTML\" has been repeated,\nover and over again, every single day... for decades... resulting in that myth\nbecoming accepted as gospel truth. With awards and acclaim (and even a\nknighthood) showered upon Sir Tim, in part, because of that myth.\n\nThe work which Tim Berners-Lee did on that initial HTML 1.0 release was -- to\nput it bluntly -- trivial. At most. Bordering on plagiarization.\n\nThe reality is... Tim stood on the backs of giants. He wasn't simply inspired\nby others... he directly copied them. To the point where Tim's work is almost\nindistinguishable (see the screenshots above) from the work which he copied\n(and is almost always attributed to him).\n\nSome of the giants he stood on the backs of:\n\n  * Anders Berglund (and his work on SGMLguid at CERN).\n  * Charles Goldfarb, Edward Mosher and Raymond Lorie (the original creators of GML, upon which SGML was based -- note that \"GML\" was named after the first letters in their last names).\n  * Ted Nelson and Douglas Engelbart for their early (1960s) work on HyperText systems.\n  * And so many others.\n\nEvery single one of those names contributed something new and significant to\nthe world of HyperText and Markup Languages. They blazed new trails.\n\nSir Tim copied the existing SGML, changed the file extension, removed a few\nfeatures, added an anchor tag (which was a feature everyone and their dog was\ndoing at the time), and released it.\n\n### \"Modifying a Work\" vs \"Claiming it as Your Own\"\n\nIf I were to, for example, fork the Linux kernel -- change one line of code --\nand release it as \"NotLinuxWinkWink\"... I can do that. It's an open source\nproject, and I can legally make modifications and release copies.\n\nBut, if I were to then receive near universal acclaim for inventing\n\"NotLinuxWinkWink\"... that's a problem. Legality aside, that just wouldn't be\nright. Or true.\n\nLikewise, if I were to copy the specification for the C programming\nlanguage... and change one line (or add one feature)... it would not be true\nto say that I \"invented\" a new language. I tweaked something that already\nexisted (that somebody else built). A little.\n\nThus is the case with Sir Tim and HTML.\n\nWas Sir Tim an instrumental figure in computing? You bet. Does he deserve a\nmention in the history books because of that? Absolutely. And in some positive\nways, at that!\n\nBut did he \"invent\" HTML? Not by a long shot.\n\nAnd we need to stop repeating that myth.\n\nJoin the Lunduke Community\n\nTo read more articles like this, sign up and join my community today\n\n32\n\nView All\n\n31\n\nWhat else you may like...\n\nVideos\n\nPodcasts\n\nPosts\n\nArticles\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\n16 hours ago\n\nThe Lunduke Journal gets a little Political!\n\nThe Lunduke Journal adds political topics, simplifies subscriptions:\nhttps://lunduke.locals.com/post/5514785/the-lunduke-journal-adds-political-\ntopics-simplifies-subscriptions\n\nLunduke Journal Link Central: https://lunduke.locals.com/post/4619051/lunduke-\njournal-link-central-tm\n\n00:29:45\n\n19\n\nView All\n\n7\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\nNew Exclusive Leak: Red Hat CEO states racist hiring goals at company meeting\n\nPlus: Red Hat CEO responds to O'Keefe leaks.\n\n[Originally published on December 22nd, 2023.]\n\n00:04:47\n\n10\n\nView All\n\n7\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nVideo: Myth - \"HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee\"\n\nThe article: https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5499910/myth-html-was-invented-\nby-tim-berners-lee\n\n00:29:58\n\n21\n\nView All\n\n9\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nNovember 22, 2023\n\nThe futility of Ad-Blockers\n\nAds are filling the entirety of the Web -- websites, podcasts, YouTube videos,\netc. -- at an increasing rate.

It was a truly unique\nexperience. Wouldn't trade a moment of it (even the less than enjoyable\nparts).\n\nBecause I am feeling nostalgic, here's a few little tidbits from my time\nselling Linux-y stuff for Linux-y companies.\n\n### SUSE - The Oldest Linux Company\n\nI spent roughly 4 years at SUSE as -- I kid you not -- often the only person,\nin the entire marketing department, who actually used Linux. As such I tended\nto be the guy that every random marketing idea needed to be run by... you\nknow, just to make sure SUSE didn't end up saying something that insulted\nLinux-folk.\n\nSeriously. It was crazy. At one point the lady who ran all of marketing -- for\nthe oldest Linux company -- had almost no clue, whatsoever, about how to even\nbegin using Linux. Or what the history of Linux was. Or what the major\nprojects were.\n\nIt was like if the head of marketing for Coca Cola had never tasted Coke\nbefore... and refused to even take a sip. And was only vaguely aware that it\nwas even a liquid.\n\nJust the same... most of the time it was pretty fun. I kept churning out ad\ncampaigns that were some of the biggest successes SUSE had ever had --\nresulting in SUSE numbers shooting up -- and, as a result, they gave me a lot\nof freedom.\n\nOf the many varied and weird marketing projects I put together at SUSE... my\nfavorite was a music video parody of \"Uptown Funk\"... about Linux kernel\npatching.\n\n\"Uptime Funk\" was a fun one. We hired a great group of musicians and dancers\n-- down in Provo, Utah -- who did a stellar job. Our cinematographer and\neditor was absolutely amazing.\n\nAnd, most importantly, nobody messed with my lyrics. Which made me happy. \ud83e\udd23\n\nI tell ya. The executives almost always messed with my words.\n\nI remember, one time I wrote a parody of Justin Timberlake's \"Can't Stop the\nFeeling\". I turned it into a song about a guy eating pie a dinner... singing\nabout how he runs Linux on absolutely everything in his house. He compulsively\ninstalls Linux on everything. If it has electricity, he installs Linux on it.\nAnd then he installs Linux inside of VMs on Linux. And he uses a remote X\nsession to log into his crock pot.\n\nIt was glorious. And ridiculous.\n\nThen the powers that be swooped in. Non-Linux-understanding marketing people\ngot assigned to \"revise\" the lyrics with the explicit instruction of making it\n\"more marketing-y\".\n\nThe result was \"Can't Stop the SUSE\". Which, annoyingly, still lists me as\nhaving written the lyrics. I'll let you decide how I feel about that song.\n\nNear the end of my tenure at SUSE, things weren't quite as fun. At one point I\nrecall getting into an argument with the VP of Marketing... who told me, point\nblank, to never use the phrase \"Free Software\" and to stop talking about \"Open\nSource\" so much.\n\nSeriously. Things were going in a weird direction.\n\nThen I left, SUSE got a new CEO, and everything went to heck in a handbasket\nfor the oldest Linux company.\n\n### Purism - The Linux Hardware Guys\n\nI spent a short spell as the Director of Marketing at Purism -- a company\nwhich sells laptops and whatnot pre-loaded with Linux. While I ended up\nleaving the company due to some disagreements over how the business was run...\nthere were definitely some fun moments.\n\nFor the launch of Librem One (Purism's effort to make a privacy-respecting\nonline service), we created a commercial. It's just a wee bit naughty. No\nswearing but... definitely a lot of innuendo. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nYou might recognize the voice at the end.\n\nUltimately, the Librem One service had some success -- but was severely bogged\ndown by technical issues, and code licensing conflicts, early on. Which was a\nbummer. Really hobbled what could have otherwise been a fun product launch.\n\nBut, heck, the commercial was fun. So it had that going for it!\n\nRead full Article\n\n25\n\nView All\n\n10\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\nRed Hat vs Hyprland: Silencing political \"undesirables\"\n\nBeneath the drama: The abuse of corporate power, extremist politics, bullying,\n& censorship of \"wrongthink\".\n\nThe Open Source world is no stranger to drama. Heck, if it's a day that ends\nin \"Ay!\", there's likely some random, usually overblown, drama happening in\none Open Source organization or another.\n\nBut, sometimes, within that drama, there exists a bigger story.\n\nSuch is the case with \"Red Hat vs Hyprland\".\n\nWithin this drama there lies a tale of extremist poltiics, abuse of corporate\npower, and silencing of political \"undesirables\". The things we learn here --\nburried beneath the layers of drama -- are deeply disturbing, with significant\nramifications for the entire Open Source industry.\n\n### Cutting through the noise\n\nAs with all drama, there's a lot of finger pointing. And... noise. So much\nnoise. Let's cut through all of that and get right to the facts.\n\nThe basic facts of this event:\n\n  1. The core developer behind Hyprland (a tiling Linux window manager which has gained significant traction), a man who goes by the name \"Vaxry\", has been banned from any involvement in the Freedesktop project (an umbrella project covering Xorg, Wayland, and many other core Linux Desktop projects).\n  2. This ban means that Vaxry will not be allowed to report bugs or submit code patches to Freedesktop projects -- often directly relevant to his own work on the Hyprland window manager.\n  3. The ban (affecting Freedesktop) was enacted by a Red Hat representative (using a RedHat.com email address), based on a perceived 2 year old \"Code of Conduct Violation\" on a Hyprland chat server.\n  4. Red Hat, Freedesktop, and Hyprland are all separate organizations.\n\nAs with any drama, there's a great deal of other information out there --\nalong with frenzied onlookers yelling about it from the sidelines -- but those\nare the core actions and facts.\n\nThe key takeaway: A representative from Red Hat was using corporate power to\nforce a person out of other (read: non-Red Hat) organizations. For reasons not\nrelated to Red Hat. Nor related to the organization the person was being\nbanned from.\n\nIn essence, Red Hat flexing it's muscle -- bending large portions of the Open\nSource world to do it's bidding.\n\nBy itself, that's bad enough. But it gets worse. Much worse.\n\n### What was the \"violation\"?\n\nIn order to understand how truly disturbing this issue is, we need to know a\nfew additional details. Starting with the initial \"Code of Conduct Violation\".\n\nBack in 2022 -- yes, two years ago -- on the Discord chat server for the\nHyprland window manager project, a man who identified as \"Trans\" listed his\npreferred prouns as \"she/her\".\n\nA moderator on that Hyprland chat server changed that \"Trans\" person's\npronouns to list as \"who/cares\".\n\nScreenshot of the \"Code of Conduct Violation\".\n\nFlash forward to 2024, and this \"who/cares\" action comes to the attention of\nanother man who identifies as \"Trans\". An employee of Red Hat named Lyude\nPaul.\n\nTo give you an idea of the motivations of the actions which follow: Lyude Paul\nhas a publicly stated goal of \"bullying\" anyone who does not adequately show\nrespect to \"Trans\" issues, as shown in his social media posts.\n\nSource: Lyude Paul's Mastodon account.\n\nLyude Paul also promotes the idea that \"right-wing people are not welcomed\" in\norganizations.\n\nSource: Lyude Paul's Mastodon account.\n\nAs Lyude Paul has a stated objective of \"bullying\" people -- making sure they\nare \"not welcomed\" -- if they do not profess the correct political ideals (or\ndo not support \"Trans\" activism in the proper way)... it is not entirely\nsurprising that this gentleman would use his position at Red Hat to ban those\nhe disagrees with.\n\nAnd that is exactly what happened.\n\nSource: Lyude Paul's official email from RedHat.com.\n\nLyude Paul -- using his Red Hat email address -- informed Vaxry (the lead\ndeveloper of Hyprland -- the project where the \"who/cares\" chat server\nincident occurred) that he was now banned from the entirety of the Freedesktop\nproject and organization.\n\nAn important note: When a person sends an email from their corporate email\naccount, they are acting on behalf of the corporation. That is a hard and fast\nrule that has been in place since... well... forever. Likewise Red Hat has not\ndistanced itself from these actions in the least.\n\nYou can read the full emails, from Lyude Paul / Red Hat, as published by\nVaxry.\n\n### The Red Hat Problem\n\nThis is an example of Red Hat, a corporation with a wild history of\ndiscrimination and censorship, using their corporate power (and strength\nwithin the Linux and Open Source world) to bully and silence those they\npolitically disagree with.\n\nRed Hat could condemn these actions (which were done in Red Hat's name) by\ntheir employee. They have not done so.\n\nNone of this should be terribly surprising, considering what we already know\nabout the IBM subsidiary. They have a history of taking extreme political\nstances... and they actively discriminate against employees who deviate from\ntheir allowed, always extremely politically Leftist, ideals.\n\n  * Red Hat holds official \"Anti-White\" training programs.\n  * Red Hat / IBM employees are given \"badges\" for being a good \"ally\".\n  * Red Hat has a \"Word Usage Council\" where they actively find words and thoughts to ban.\n  * Red Hat / IBM has racist hiring quotas and more.\n\nConsidering Red Hat's historical stances and actions, it is no surprise that\nan employee of Red Hat would be able to use the corporate power of Red Hat to\nbully others who possessed the wrong ideas (as was the publicly stated\nobjective of Lyude Paul).\n\n### A singular bit of drama... and a trend.\n\nThis particular incident has elicited strong reactions -- and has grabbed the\nattention of many across the Linux and Open Source industry. Lots of drama.\nLots of opportunities to quote people who are making big, outlandish\nstatements.\n\nAnd most of that drama is little more than distracting fluff.\n\nBut the core -- the facts -- are truly disturbing. And, once again, Red Hat\nfinds itself at the center of another story where people are being\ndiscriminated against.\n\nA few closing thoughts.\n\n  * If this sort of bullying, censorship, and blacklisting of those with the \"wrong politics\" is allowed to continue... it will get worse.\n  * Lyude Paul is guilty of far more extreme \"Code of Conduct\" violations than Vaxry -- as is shown in the screenshots above. Yet Lyude Paul has not been banned, censored, or punished in any way by Red Hat or Freedesktop.\n  * It would appear fairly obvious that the \"Code of Conduct\", at least in this case, is being used as a weapon to selectively harm specific individuals.\n  * Considering Red Hat / IBM's history and dedication to discriminating against specific groups, it seems a fair assumption that these actions are not only allowed but encouraged by corporate leadership. Should that not be the case, The Lunduke Journal encourages Red Hat and IBM to make a statement regarding it. If such a statement is made, The Lunduke Journal will publish it in full.\n  * Will Open Source organizations -- such as Freedesktop -- allow these sorts of discriminatory actions to continue?\n  * Should Freedesktop, and others, continue allowing this type of discrimination... what result will that have on existing Open Source projects and users of those projects?\n\nThe Lunduke Journal has reached out to representatives from IBM and Red Hat\nfor comment. As of the time of publication The Lunduke Journal has received no\nresponse.\n\nRead full Article\n\n15\n\nView All\n\n10\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\nCrazy Tech People Who Hate Lunduke - Part I\n\nLunduke drives Tech Journalists to mADnEsS & destroys entire projects... with\nhis magic words!\n\nOne of my super-powers (apparently) is writing words which burrow into the\nbrains of many nerds... driving them slowly insane.\n\nTech Journalists, Software Developers, Project Managers... even your average\ncomputer nerds are susceptible to my wizardly words of wickedness.\n\nAnd, because I have to see their linguistic detritus, I am now going to\nsubject all of you to the insanity which they spew.\n\nI present to you: \"Crazy Tech People Who Hate Lunduke - Part I\"\n\nYeah.
