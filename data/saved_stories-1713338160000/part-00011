Today, I have even more. The reasons are many, but start with the\nprogress we\u2019ve made in our financial results and customer experiences, and\nextend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front\nof us.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon\u2019s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (\u201cYoY\u201d) from $514B to\n$575B. By segment, North America revenue increased 12% YoY from $316B to\n$353B, International revenue grew 11% YoY from $118B to $131B, and AWS revenue\nincreased 13% YoY from $80B to $91B.\n\nFurther, Amazon\u2019s operating income and Free Cash Flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) dramatically\nimproved. Operating income in 2023 improved 201% YoY from $12.2B (an operating\nmargin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month\nFCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8B in 2022 to\n$35.5B (up $48.3B).\n\nWhile we\u2019ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we\u2019re\nmost pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across\nour businesses.\n\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our\nrelentless focus on selection, price, and convenience. We continue to have the\nbroadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products available,\ntens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to\nlist on Amazon (e.g. Coach, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart,\nClinique, Lanc\u00f4me, and Urban Decay).\n\nBeing sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain\neconomy, where customers are careful about how much they\u2019re spending. As a\nresult, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days,\nan exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday\nshopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday\nholiday shopping event, open to all customers, that became our largest revenue\nevent ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions of\ndeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\n\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company\nrecords. In 2023, Amazon delivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime\nmembers, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including\nmore than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the\nU.S., this result is the combination of two things. One is the benefit of\nregionalization, where we re-architected the network to store items closer to\ncustomers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023,\nwe increased the number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70%\nYoY. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to\nfulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in\nvarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing\n(over 20% YoY in Q4 2023).\n\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances,\nhelping lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we\nreduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\ncost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit YoY. Decreasing cost to\nserve allows us both to invest in speed improvements and afford adding more\nselection at lower Average Selling Prices (\u201cASPs\u201d). More selection at lower\nprices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\n\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we\u2019re not done lowering our cost to\nserve. We\u2019ve challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network,\nand reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we\ncan lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our\ninbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas\nof focus in 2024, and we have optimism there\u2019s more upside for us.\n\nInternationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see\nmeaningful progress in our emerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil,\nAustralia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to expand\nselection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico\nbecame our latest international Stores locale to turn profitable). We have\nhigh conviction that these new geographies will continue to grow and be\nprofitable in the long run.\n\nAlongside our Stores business, Amazon\u2019s Advertising progress remains strong,\ngrowing 24% YoY from $38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our\nsponsored ads. We\u2019ve added Sponsored TV to this offering, a self-service\nsolution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streaming\nTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend.\nRecently, we\u2019ve expanded our streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into\nPrime Video shows and movies, where brands can reach over 200 million monthly\nviewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies and\nshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night\nFootball. Streaming TV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong\nstart.\n\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with\nmost companies trying to save money in an uncertain economy. Much of this\noptimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the cloud more\nefficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like\nGraviton chips (our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-\nperformance than other leading x86 processors), S3 Intelligent Tiering (a\nstorage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and\nstore them in less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give\ncustomers lower prices in exchange for longer commitments). This work\ndiminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,\nand should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we\nsaw cost optimization attenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing\nat larger commitments over longer time periods, and migrations growing again.\n\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our\nnext generation of generalized CPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30%\nbetter compute performance and 75% more memory bandwidth than its already-\nleading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips, which\nwill deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative\nAI applications and three times more memory capacity than Trainium1. We\ncontinued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint, now offering 105\nAvailability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions\ncoming (Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand,\nand a second German region in Berlin). In Generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d), we added\ndozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easier for developers to\nbuild new Foundation Models (\u201cFMs\u201d). We invented and delivered a new service\n(Amazon Bedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI\napplications. And, we launched the most capable coding assistant around in\nAmazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we\u2019re seeing\nsignificant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we\u2019re approaching\nGenAI and why we believe we\u2019ll be successful later in the letter.)\n\nWe\u2019re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have\nthe potential to be important to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on\ntwo of them:\n\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable\nbusiness on its own. This confidence is buoyed by the continued development of\ncompelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night Football, Lord of the\nRings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House, etc.), Prime Video customers\u2019\nengagement with this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our\nthird-party Channels program, as well as the broad selection of shows and\nmovies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising in Prime Video.\n\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project\nKuiper when we launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space, and\nsuccessfully validated all key systems and sub-systems\u2014rare in an initial\nlaunch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims\nto provide broadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don\u2019t\nhave it today (as well as governments and enterprises seeking better\nconnectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large\nrevenue opportunity for Amazon. We\u2019re on track to launch our first production\nsatellites in 2024. We\u2019ve still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by\nour progress.\n\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I\u2019m grateful to our collective teams who\ndelivered on behalf of customers. These results represent a lot of invention,\ncollaboration, discipline, execution, and reimagination across Amazon. Yet, I\nthink every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in\nevery one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers\u2019\nlives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the\nbusinesses in which we\u2019re investing.\n\n===\n\nIn my annual letter over the last three years, I\u2019ve tried to give shareholders\nmore insight into how we\u2019re thinking about the company, the businesses we\u2019re\npursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes us tick. We operate in a\ndiverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint\nmission to make customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day. This is true\nacross every customer segment we serve (consumers, sellers, brands,\ndevelopers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we\u2019re not just customer\nobsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy,\nscrappy, delivering quickly, and operating like the world\u2019s biggest start-up.\n\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and\noutside of our company. We characterize builders as people who like to invent.\nThey like to dissect a customer experience, assess what\u2019s wrong with it, and\nreinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience\nis perfect. This doesn\u2019t hinder them from delivering improvements along the\nway, but it drives them to keep tinkering and iterating continually. While\nunafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about using high-\nquality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to\nbuilders is having the right tools to keep rapidly improving customer\nexperiences.\n\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services. Think\nof them as discrete, foundational building blocks that builders can weave\ntogether in whatever combination they desire. Here\u2019s how we described\nprimitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\n\n\u201cPrimitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks\nfor software developers. They\u2019re indivisible (if they can be functionally\nsplit into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They\u2019re meant to\nbe used together rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we\u2019ll\nbuild them for maximum developer flexibility. We won\u2019t put a bunch of\nconstraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves.\nRather, we\u2019ll optimize for developer freedom and innovation.\u201d\n\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software\ndevelopment, but they\u2019re especially relevant in technology. And, over the last\n20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we\u2019ve innovated quickly.\n\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed. Let me give you\ntwo counter examples that illustrate this point. First, we built a successful\nowned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazon where we bought\nall our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them\nin our warehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could\nadd broader selection and lower prices by allowing third-party sellers to list\ntheir offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search and product\ndetail pages. We\u2019d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search,\nordering, browse, item management) that made trying different marketplace\nconcepts simpler than if we didn\u2019t have those components. A good set of\nprimitives? Not really.\n\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not\npartitioned right. We learned this the hard way when we partnered with\ncompanies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early 2000s. The\nconcept was that target.com would use Amazon\u2019s ecommerce components as the\nbackbone of its website, and then customize however they wished. To enable\nthis arrangement, we had to deliver those components as separable capabilities\nthrough application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d). This decoupling was far\nmore difficult than anticipated because we\u2019d built so many dependencies\nbetween these services as Amazon grew so quickly the first few years.\n\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to\noperate called \u201cNPI.\u201d Any new initiative requiring work from multiple internal\nteams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where each team would communicate\nhow many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrained what\nwe accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate\nit by refactoring these ecommerce components into true primitive services with\nwell-documented, stable APIs that enabled our builders to use each other\u2019s\nservices without any coordination tax.\n\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building\na new set of infrastructure technology services that would allow both Amazon\nto move more quickly and external developers to build anything they imagined.\nThis set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiences convinced\nus that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed\ntogether how anybody saw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were\nvery feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobs simultaneously. As a\nresult, they often didn\u2019t do any one job that well.\n\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They\noffered important, highly flexible, but focused functionality. For instance,\nour first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service (\u201cS3\u201d) in March\n2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high\ndurability and availability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other\nwords, be stellar at object storage. When we launched S3, developers were\nexcited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they\nwondered, why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute\nCloud (\u201cEC2\u201d) in August 2006 and Amazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we\nwere building a set of primitive infrastructure services that would allow them\nto build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and\nwithout having to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or\nhardware. As AWS unveiled these building blocks over time (we now have over\n240 at builders\u2019 disposal\u2014meaningfully more than any other provider), whole\ncompanies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram,\nPinterest, Stripe, etc.), industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g.\nstreaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox, Paramount), and even critical\ngovernment agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several other U.S.\nIntelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was\nAmazon\u2019s own consumer businesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across\nretail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and Fire TV), Prime Video and Music,\nAmazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with which\nAWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders\u2019\nability to innovate.\n\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?\n\nPursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could\nbuild, and even more ways to combine them. But, a good compass is to pick real\ncustomer problems you\u2019re trying to solve.\n\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon\u2019s early years,\nwe built core capabilities around warehousing items, and then picking,\npacking, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers. As we added\nthird-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able\nto use these same logistics capabilities. Because we\u2019d built this initial set\nof logistics primitives, we were able to introduce Fulfillment by Amazon\n(\u201cFBA\u201d) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon\u2019s Fulfillment Network to store\nitems, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus\nof these products being available for fast, Prime delivery. This service has\nsaved sellers substantial time and money (typically about 70% less expensive\nthan doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more\nmerchants began to operate their own direct-to-consumer (\u201cDTC\u201d) websites, many\nyearned to still use our fulfillment capabilities, while also accessing our\npayments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion on their own\nwebsites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity\ninformation with Amazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to\naddress this customer need. Prime members can check out quickly on DTC\nwebsites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds on Buy\nwith Prime items\u2014increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their\ndefault experience.\n\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become\nmore complex, we\u2019ve had to develop a slew of capabilities in order to offer\ncustomers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fast delivery\ntimes. We\u2019ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the\nU.S., clearing customs, and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we\ndon\u2019t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centers to store all the\ninventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we\u2019ve built a set of\nlower-cost, upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without\nsophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and ship functions). Having these two\npools of inventory has prompted us to build algorithms predicting when we\u2019ll\nrun out of inventory in our shipping fulfillment centers and automatically\nreplenishing from these upstream warehouses. And, in the last few years, our\nscale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own last mile\ndelivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number\nof consumers and sellers wanting to use Amazon.\n\nWe\u2019ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment\nprimitives that both serve Amazon consumers better and address external\nsellers\u2019 increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, for sellers\nneeding help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages\nour expertise here. To ship inventory from the border (or anywhere\ndomestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers to use either our\nfirst-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our\nPartnered Carrier Program. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure\nhigher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times, we\u2019ve opened our upstream\nAmazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along with\nautomated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For\nthose wanting to manage their own shipping, we\u2019ve started allowing customers\nto use our last mile delivery network to deliver packages to their end-\ncustomers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to\nuse our fulfillment network as a central place to store inventory and ship\nitems to customers regardless of where they ordered, we have a Multi-Channel\nFulfillment service. These are all primitives that we\u2019ve exposed to sellers.\n\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom. You can\nkeep your primitives to yourself and build compelling features and\ncapabilities on top of them to allow your customers and business to reap the\nbenefits of rapid innovation. You can offer primitives to external customers\nas paid services (as we have with AWS and our more recent logistics\nofferings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external, paid\napplications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a\nrecently released logistics service that integrates several of our logistics\nprimitives). But, you\u2019ve got options. You\u2019re only constrained by the\nprimitives you\u2019ve built and your imagination.\n\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They\u2019re\nlocated in the largest metro areas around the U.S. (we currently have 58),\nhouse our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millions of other SKUs that\ncan be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day\nfacilities), and streamline the time required to go from picking a customer\u2019s\norder to being ready to ship to as little as 11 minutes. These facilities also\nconstitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has been so\npositive for customers that we\u2019re planning to double the number of these\nfacilities.\n\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core\nbuilding block? We have a very large and growing grocery business in organic\ngrocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods (e.g. consumables,\ncanned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We\u2019ve been working hard on\nbuilding a mass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great\nperishable experience; however, what if we used our same-day facilities to\nenable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to any\nAmazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting\nup their weekly grocery shopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient\nas non-perishable shopping already is.\n\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that\u2019s making\nsubstantial progress and we think of as a very valuable future primitive\ncapability\u2014our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventually\nallow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won\u2019t start\noff being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we\nbelieve it\u2019ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience of\nordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\n\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an\nantibiotic, or some other medication? Same-day facilities already deliver many\nof these items within hours, and that will only get shorter as we launch Prime\nAir more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed across\nbusinesses and in new combinations that change what\u2019s possible for customers.\n\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience. Releasing the\nfirst couple primitive services can sometimes feel random to customers (or the\npublic at large) before we\u2019ve unveiled how these building blocks come\ntogether. I\u2019ve mentioned AWS and S3 as an example, but our Health offering is\nanother. In the last 10 years, we\u2019ve tried several Health experiments across\nvarious teams\u2014but they were not driven by our primitives approach. This\nchanged in 2022 when we applied our primitives thinking to the enormous global\nhealthcare problem and opportunity. We\u2019ve now created several important\nbuilding blocks to help transform the customer health experience: Acute Care\n(via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One Medical), and a Pharmacy service to\nbuy whatever medication a patient may need. Because of our growing success,\nAmazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and\nnutrition opportunities\u2014which can be partially unlocked with some of our\nexisting grocery building blocks, including Whole Foods Market or Amazon\nFresh.\n\nAs a builder, it\u2019s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus\njust combining a bunch of components together to solve a specific problem. The\nlatter can be faster, but almost always slows you down in the future. We\u2019ve\nseen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There\nare dozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity,\nand cost. Some of the biggest opportunities require invention in domains such\nas storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobility of large cages across\nlong distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip\nright to the complex solution, baking in \u201cjust enough\u201d of these disciplines to\nmake a concerted solution work, but which doesn\u2019t solve much more, can\u2019t\neasily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can\u2019t be reused for\nother initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think\nin primitives, like our Robotics team does, you prioritize the building\nblocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit from each of these\nprimitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and\nquickly) for future and complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives\nin each of the above domains that will be lynchpins in our next set of\nautomation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,\nlarge pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound\nprocesses (including in vehicles). The team is also building a set of\nfoundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,\noptimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the\nbottlenecks in our facilities.\n\nSometimes, people ask us \u201cwhat\u2019s your next pillar? You have Marketplace,\nPrime, and AWS, what\u2019s next?\u201d This, of course, is a thought-provoking\nquestion. However, a question people never ask, and might be even more\ninteresting is what\u2019s the next set of primitives you\u2019re building that enables\nbreakthrough customer experiences? If you asked me today, I\u2019d lead with\nGenerative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d).\n\nMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications, with the\nremarkable 2022 launch of ChatGPT. But, to our \u201cprimitive\u201d way of thinking,\nthere are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each of which is gigantic,\nand each of which we\u2019re deeply investing.\n\nThe bottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation\nmodels (\u201cFMs\u201d). The primary primitives are the compute required to train\nmodels and generate inferences (or predictions), and the software that makes\nit easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip\ninside it. To date, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia\nchips, and we continue to offer the broadest collection of Nvidia instances of\nany provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue as\ncustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push\nthe envelope on price-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton\nfor generalized CPU chips. As a result, we\u2019ve built custom AI training chips\n(named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, we announced\nsecond versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both\nmeaningfully more price-performant than their first versions and other\nalternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic, announced it would\nuse Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We\nalready have several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic,\nAirbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh, and Snap.\n\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a\nmodel into production. Getting data organized and fine-tuned, building\nscalable and efficient training infrastructure, and then deploying models at\nscale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve built\nAmazon SageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that\u2019s been a game changer for\ndevelopers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training\nmodels faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster in SageMaker),\nlowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80%\nwith SageMaker), and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced\nits time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months to under seven months using\nSageMaker).\n\nThe middle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM,\ncustomize it with their own data, and leverage a leading cloud provider\u2019s\nsecurity and features to build a GenAI application\u2014all as a managed service.\nAmazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way\nto build and scale GenAI applications with the broadest selection of first-\nand third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-use capabilities that allow\nGenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is\noff to a very strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after\njust a few months. The team continues to iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently\ndelivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will answer),\nKnowledge Bases (to expand models\u2019 knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration\u2014or RAG\u2014and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step\ntasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching and refining models), all of which\nimprove customers\u2019 application quality. We also just added new models from\nAnthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language\nmodel in the world), Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and\nour own Amazon Titan family of FMs. What customers have learned at this early\nstage of GenAI is that there\u2019s meaningful iteration required to build a\nproduction GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost\nand latency needed. Customers don\u2019t want only one model. They want access to\nvarious models and model sizes for different types of applications. Customers\nwant a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is\nwhat Bedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers\nusing Bedrock already include ADP, Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge,\nClariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines, Druva, Genesys,\nGenomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart,\nPerplexity AI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\n\nThe top layer of this stack is the application layer. We\u2019re building a\nsubstantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer\nbusiness. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant), to\nan even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities\n(making it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and\nedit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), to customer and\nseller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We\u2019re also building\nseveral apps in AWS, including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use\ncase\u2014a coding companion. We recently launched Amazon Q, an expert on AWS that\nwrites, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doing transformations\n(like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying\ncustomers\u2019 various data repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce,\nAmazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answer questions, summarize\ndata, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable\nwork assistant available today and evolving fast.\n\nWhile we\u2019re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the\nvast majority will ultimately be built by other companies. However, what we\u2019re\nbuilding in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundation model. These AWS\nservices, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that\ndemocratize this next seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and\nexternal builders to transform virtually every customer experience that we\nknow (and invent altogether new ones as well). We\u2019re optimistic that much of\nthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\n\n(By the way, don\u2019t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI.\nCustomers\u2019 AI models contain some of their most sensitive data. AWS and its\npartners offer the strongest security capabilities and track record in the\nworld; and as a result, more and more customers want to run their GenAI on\nAWS.)\n\n===\n\nRecently, I was asked a provocative question\u2014how does Amazon remain resilient?\nWhile simple in its wording, it\u2019s profound because it gets to the heart of our\nsuccess to date as well as for the future. The answer lies in our discipline\naround deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to\ncontinually improve and expand what\u2019s possible; 2/ solving real customer\nchallenges, rather than what we think may be interesting technology; 3/\nbuilding in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest\nrate; 4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always\nlose)\u2014when we discover technology that enables better customer experiences, we\nembrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments\u2014actually\nbecoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\n\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with\nunusual opportunities for growth across the areas in which we operate. For\ninstance, while we have a nearly $500B consumer business, about 80% of the\nworldwide retail market segment still resides in physical stores. Similarly,\nwith a cloud computing business at nearly a $100B revenue run rate, more than\n85% of the global IT spend is still on-premises. These businesses will keep\nshifting online and into the cloud. In Media and Advertising, content will\ncontinue to migrate from linear formats to streaming. Globally, hundreds of\nmillions of people who don\u2019t have adequate broadband access will gain that\nconnectivity in the next few years. Last but certainly not least, Generative\nAI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself,\nis still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet. Unlike the mass\nmodernization of on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, where there\u2019s work\nrequired to migrate, this GenAI revolution will be built from the start on top\nof the cloud. The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions\nthat will be possible will astound us all.\n\nThere has never been a time in Amazon\u2019s history where we\u2019ve felt there is so\nmuch opportunity to make our customers\u2019 lives better and easier. We\u2019re\nincredibly excited about what\u2019s possible, focused on inventing the future, and\nlook forward to working together to make it so.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndy Jassy President and Chief Executive Officer Amazon.com, Inc.\n\nP.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows.\nWhat\u2019s written there is as true today as it was in 1997.\n\nTo our shareholders:\n\nAmazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more\nthan 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million,\nand extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.\n\nBut this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com.\nToday, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow,\nthrough personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of\ndiscovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers\nand, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established\nand large markets.\n\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to\npursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are\nreceptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has\ncontinued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with\ncredible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to\nbuilding awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to\nsolidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online\ncommerce opportunities in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the\nlarge markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without risk: it requires\nserious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\n\nIt\u2019s All About the Long Term\n\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder\nvalue we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our\nability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The\nstronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market\nleadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability,\ngreater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested\ncapital.\n\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure\nourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership:\ncustomer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to\npurchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have\ninvested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our\ncustomer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring\nfranchise.\n\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh\ntradeoffs differently than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with\nyou our fundamental management and decision-making approach so that you, our\nshareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment\nphilosophy:\n\n  * We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.\n\n  * We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\n\n  * We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.\n\n  * We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\n\n  * When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we\u2019ll take the cash flows.\n\n  * We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.\n\n  * We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\n\n  * We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model.\n\n  * We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.\n\nWe aren\u2019t so bold as to claim that the above is the \u201cright\u201d investment\nphilosophy, but it\u2019s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren\u2019t clear in the\napproach we have taken and will continue to take.\n\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus,\nour progress in 1997, and our outlook for the future.\n\nObsess Over Customers\n\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling\nvalue. We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait.\nTherefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get\nany other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more\nselection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6\nfootball fields), and presented it in a useful, easy- to-search, and easy-to-\nbrowse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a\ndogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially\nenhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click\nshoppingSM, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing\ncustomer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition\ntool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in\nus. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the\nmarket leader in online bookselling.\n\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\n\n  * Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million \u2013 an 838% increase.\n\n  * Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 \u2013 a 738% increase.\n\n  * The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.\n\n  * In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the top 20.\n\n  * We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support\nthese greatly increased traffic, sales, and service levels:\n\n  * Amazon.com\u2019s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our management team.\n\n  * Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\n\n  * Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.\n\n  * Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\n\nOur Employees\n\nThe past year\u2019s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working\ngroup, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar\nhigh in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single\nmost important element of Amazon.com\u2019s success.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, \u201cYou can work\nlong, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can\u2019t choose two out of three\u201d),\nbut we are working to build something important, something that matters to our\ncustomers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things\naren\u2019t meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of\ndedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.\n\nGoals for 1998\n\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our\ncustomers through Internet commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to\ncontinue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires\nsustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding\ncustomer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to\nadd music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other\nproducts may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant\nopportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing\ndelivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a\nbig part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand\nour business, but in prioritizing our investments.\n\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was\nfounded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must\nremain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we\nwill face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:\naggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges\nand execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the\nneed for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity.\nHowever, as we\u2019ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in\ngeneral, should prove to be a very large market, and it\u2019s likely that a number\nof companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about what we\u2019ve done,\nand even more excited about what we want to do.\n\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our\ncustomers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and\nto our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\n\nJeffrey P. Bezos Founder and Chief Executive Officer Amazon.com, Inc.\n\nRelated Tags\n\nShareholder letterAndy Jassy\n\n28 min\n\nReading:\n\nCEO Andy Jassy\u2019s 2023 Letter to Shareholders\n\n  * Facebook Share\n  * Twitter Share\n  * LinkedIn Share\n  * Email Share\n  * Copy\n\nLink copied\n\nStories we think you'll like\n\n  1.
