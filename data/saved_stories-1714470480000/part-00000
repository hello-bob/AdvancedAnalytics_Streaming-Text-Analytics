Furthermore, why did they need an expensive service dog? Couldn\u2019t\na regular dog of whichever size be able to do the same thing if loved and\ntreated properly! Thankful that the dog was removed and retired.\n\nB\n\nBigJake Verified Apr 26, 2024 12:38 PM\n\nThis does not pass the smell test. It took 2 years for a decision? Why? given\na 12 year lifespan, the dog has lost 1/6 of his life. Retired to where? Does\nhe get a pension? Questionable as to whether his physical problems were caused\nby his weight. Some dogs are predisposed for such maladies. Certainly being\nover weight did not help. Going forward, who is going to pay for his vet\ntreatments? Is he being treated. How did this affect the child? Most\nimportantly, is the dog still alive, or was he euthanized \u2018for his own good\u2019?\n\nC\n\ncdn.chick Verified Apr 26, 2024 12:44 PM\n\n\"Adjudicator ... came to the decision last week, two years after Sammy the\nservice dog was taken from the Mississauga home where he'd been living as a\ncompanion animal since 2018.\"\n\nDog placed in 2018, removed in 2022 and then the family filed a complaint. The\ndecision on the fact of disability discrimination was what took two years.\n\nAs for your other good questions, those aren't answered in the article. I\ndon't know either.\n\nB\n\nbillychan Apr 26, 2024 1:40 PM\n\nMost of the questions you asked can be answered by reading the article all the\nway through to the end\n\nJ\n\nJaquesCousteau Apr 26, 2024 2:16 PM\n\nWhy did it take so long? Because they don't want to be hasty when making these\ndecisions. They need to prove that they gave the family ample warning and\nopportunity to fix the issue before acting to avoid situations just like this.\n\nI imagine he will be adopted out, and the new owner will have to pay for the\nvet visits. It also says the dog lost 7.5lbs within a month of leaving their\nhome, so my assumption is that the dog is still alive.\n\nLS\n\nLucas Schmiedendorf Apr 26, 2024 3:23 PM\n\nseems like they did everything they could to work with the family. i feel bad\nfor the child and the dog, but the parents have no excuse for not taking care\nof the animal.\n\nVictor Valerian Apr 27, 2024 12:36 PM\n\nOnce a dog starts to get older it's energy and activity aren't high enough to\nburn the calories found in standard dog food. The real only alternative is to\nmanage its food, at amounts that would be seen, from todays standards as\nstarvation. In which case is grounds to take the dog again. It's really a\nlose, lose situation. Sometimes it's best to look at the big picture. The dog\nhas a better life then trying to survive in its natural habitat.... the\nforest. Doesn't make sense to me.\n\nGrambo705 Apr 26, 2024 6:04 PM\n\nThis makes me sick to my stomach\n\nS\n\nSaraO Apr 27, 2024 9:42 AM\n\nThis is really sad. I have a child with special needs and if we had the\noppertunity to have a service dog we would be out with the dog and my child as\nmuch as possible. Makes me sad for the animal and the child..\n\nC\n\nCanadazfinest420 Apr 27, 2024 5:24 PM\n\nDon't be lazy, walk the dog.
