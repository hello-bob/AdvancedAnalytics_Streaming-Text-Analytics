A U.S. intelligence analysis says there is\ninsufficient evidence to prove either theory, but the debate has further\ntainted relations between the U.S. and China.\n\nA photographer tries to take photos of the World Health Organization convoy at\nthe Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in China's Hubei on Jan. 31, 2021.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)\n\nUnlike in the U.S., there is virtually no public debate in China about whether\nthe virus came from nature or from a lab leak. In fact, there is little public\ndiscussion at all about the source of the disease, first detected in the\ncentral city of Wuhan.\n\nCrucial initial efforts were hampered by bureaucrats in Wuhan trying to avoid\nblame who misled the central government; the central government, which muzzled\nChinese scientists and subjected visiting WHO officials to stage-managed\ntours; and the U.N. health agency itself, which may have compromised early\nopportunities to gather critical information in hopes that by placating China,\nscientists could gain more access, according to internal materials obtained by\nAP.\n\nMORE ON COVID-19\n\nParis-bound Olympians look forward to a post-COVID Games with fans in the\nstands\n\nIRS claws back money given to businesses under fraud-ridden COVID-era tax\ncredit program\n\nSeveral probes target Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro, but his COVID decisions are catching\nup to him first\n\nIn a faxed statement, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry defended China\u2019s handling of\nresearch into the origins, saying the country is open and transparent, shared\ndata and research, and \u201cmade the greatest contribution to global origins\nresearch.\u201d The National Health Commission, China\u2019s top medical authority, said\nthe country \u201cinvested huge manpower, material and financial resources\u201d and\n\u201chas not stopped looking for the origins of the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nIt could have played out differently, as shown by the outbreak of SARS, a\ngenetic relative of COVID-19, nearly 20 years ago. China initially hid\ninfections then, but WHO complained swiftly and publicly. Ultimately, Beijing\nfired officials and made reforms. The U.N. agency soon found SARS likely\njumped to humans from civet cats in southern China and international\nscientists later collaborated with their Chinese counterparts to pin down bats\nas SARS\u2019 natural reservoir.\n\nBut different leaders of both China and WHO, China\u2019s quest for control of its\nresearchers, and global tensions have all led to silence when it comes to\nsearching for COVID-19\u2019s origins. Governments in Asia are pressuring\nscientists not to look for the virus for fear it could be traced inside their\nborders.\n\nEven without those complications, experts say identifying how outbreaks begin\nis incredibly challenging and that it\u2019s rare to know with certainty how some\nviruses begin spreading.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing how quickly the search for the origins of (COVID-19)\nescalated into politics,\u201d said Mark Woolhouse, a University of Edinburgh\noutbreak expert. \u201cNow this question may never be definitively answered.\u201d\n\nA security person moves journalists away from the Wuhan Institute of Virology\nafter a World Health Organization team arrived for a field visit in Wuhan in\nChina\u2019s Hubei province on Feb. 3, 2021. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)\n\n## CLOUDS OF SECRECY\n\nSecrecy clouds the beginning of the outbreak. Even the date when Chinese\nauthorities first started searching for the origins is unclear.\n\nThe first publicly known search for the virus took place on Dec. 31, 2019,\nwhen Chinese Center for Disease Control scientists visited the Wuhan market\nwhere many early COVID-19 cases surfaced.\n\nHowever, WHO officials heard of an earlier inspection of the market on Dec.\n25, 2019, according to a recording of a confidential WHO meeting provided to\nAP by an attendee. Such a probe has never been mentioned publicly by either\nChinese authorities or WHO.\n\nIn the recording, WHO\u2019s top animal virus expert, Peter Ben Embarek, mentioned\nthe earlier date, describing it as \u201can interesting detail.\u201d He told colleagues\nthat officials were \u201clooking at what was on sale in the market, whether all\nthe vendors have licenses (and) if there was any illegal (wildlife) trade\nhappening in the market.\u201d\n\nA colleague asked Ben Embarek, who is no longer with WHO, if that seemed\nunusual. He responded that \u201cit was not routine,\u201d and that the Chinese \u201cmust\nhave had some reason\u201d to investigate the market. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to figure out what\nhappened and why they did that.\u201d\n\nBen Embarek declined to comment. Another WHO staffer at the Geneva meeting in\nlate January 2020 confirmed Ben Embarek\u2019s comments.\n\nThe Associated Press could not confirm the search independently. It remains a\nmystery if it took place, what inspectors discovered, or whether they sampled\nlive animals that might point to how COVID-19 emerged.\n\nPeter Ben Embarek of a World Health Organization team attends a joint press\nconference at the end of their mission to investigate the origins of the\ncoronavirus pandemic in Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei on Feb. 9, 2021. (AP Photo/Ng\nHan Guan, File)\n\nA Dec. 25, 2019, inspection would have come when Wuhan authorities were aware\nof the mysterious disease. The day before, a local doctor sent a sample from\nan ill market vendor to get sequenced that turned out to contain COVID-19.\nChatter about the unknown pneumonia was spreading in Wuhan\u2019s medical circles,\naccording to one doctor and a relative of another who declined to be\nidentified, fearing repercussions.\n\nA scientist in China when the outbreak occurred said they heard of a Dec. 25\ninspection from collaborating virologists in the country. They declined to be\nnamed out of fear of retribution.\n\nWHO said in an email that it was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the Dec. 25 investigation. It\nis not included in the U.N. health agency\u2019s official COVID-19 timeline.\n\nWhen China CDC researchers from Beijing arrived on Jan. 1 to collect samples\nat the market, it had been ordered shut and was already being disinfected,\ndestroying critical information about the virus. Gao Fu, then head of the\nChina CDC, mentioned it to an American collaborator.\n\n\u201cHis complaint when I met him was that all the animals were gone,\u201d said\nColumbia University epidemiologist Ian Lipkin.\n\nMarion Koopmans, right, and Peter Ben Embarek, center, of the World Health\nOrganization team say farewell to their Chinese counterpart Liang Wannian,\nleft, after a WHO-China Joint Study Press Conference at the end of the WHO\nmission in Wuhan, China, on Feb. 9, 2021. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)\n\nRobert Garry, who studies viruses at Tulane University, said a Dec. 25 probe\nwould be \u201chugely significant,\u201d given what is known about the virus and its\nspread.\n\n\u201cBeing able to swab it directly from the animal itself would be pretty\nconvincing and nobody would be arguing\u201d about the origins of COVID-19, he\nsaid.\n\nBut perhaps local officials simply feared for their jobs, with memories of\nfirings after the 2003 SARS outbreak still vivid, said Ray Yip, the founding\nhead of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outpost in China.\n\n\u201cThey were trying to save their skin, hide the evidence,\u201d Yip said.\n\nThe Wuhan government did not respond to a faxed request for comment.\n\nAnother early victim was Zhang Yongzhen, the first scientist to publish a\nsequence of the virus. A day after he wrote a memo urging health authorities\nto action, China\u2019s top health official ordered Zhang\u2019s lab closed.\n\n\u201cThey used their official power against me and our colleagues,\u201d Zhang wrote in\nan email provided to AP by Edward Holmes, an Australian virologist.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2020, a WHO delegation arrived in Wuhan for a two-day mission.\nChina did not approve a visit to the market, but they stopped by a China CDC\nlab to examine infection prevention and control procedures, according to an\ninternal WHO travel report. WHO\u2019s then-China representative, Dr. Gauden Galea,\ntold colleagues in a private meeting that inquiries about COVID-19\u2019s origins\nwent unanswered.\n\nBy then, many Chinese were angry at their government. Among Chinese doctors\nand scientists, the sense grew that Beijing was hunting for someone to blame.\n\n\u201cThere are a few cadres who have performed poorly,\u201d Chinese leader Xi Jinping\nsaid in unusually harsh comments in February. \u201cSome dare not take\nresponsibility, wait timidly for orders from above, and don\u2019t move without\nbeing pushed.\u201d\n\nThe government opened investigations into top health officials, according to\ntwo former and current China CDC staff and three others familiar with the\nmatter. Health officials were encouraged to report colleagues who mishandled\nthe outbreak to Communist Party disciplinary bodies, according to two of the\npeople.\n\nSome people both inside and outside China speculated about a laboratory leak.\nThose suspicious included right-wing American politicians, but also\nresearchers close to WHO.\n\nThe focus turned to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a high-level lab that\nexperimented with some of the world\u2019s most dangerous viruses.\n\nIn early February 2020, some of the West\u2019s leading scientists, headed by Dr.\nJeremy Farrar, then at Britain\u2019s Wellcome Trust, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, then\ndirector of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, banded together to assess\nthe origins of the virus in calls, a Slack channel and emails.\n\nThey drafted a paper suggesting a natural evolution, but even among\nthemselves, they could not agree on the likeliest scenario. Some were alarmed\nby features they thought might indicate tinkering.\n\n\u201cThere have (been) suggestions that the virus escaped from the Wuhan lab,\u201d\nHolmes, the Australian virologist, who believed the virus originated in\nnature, wrote in a Feb. 7, 2020, email. \u201cI do a lot of work in China, and I\ncan (assure) you that a lot of people there believe they are being lied to.\u201d\n\nAmerican scientists close to researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology\nwarned counterparts there to prepare.\n\nJames LeDuc, head of a Texas lab, emailed his Wuhan colleague on Feb. 9, 2020,\nsaying he\u2019d already been approached by U.S. officials. \u201cClearly addressing\nthis will be essential, with any kind of documentation you might have,\u201d he\nwrote.\n\nA security guard waves for journalists to clear the road after a convoy\ncarrying the World Health Organization team entered the Huanan Seafood Market\nin Wuhan, China on Jan. 31, 2021.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)\n\nThe Chinese government was conducting its own secret investigation into the\nWuhan Institute. Gao, the then-head of the China CDC, and another Chinese\nhealth expert revealed its existence in interviews months and years later.\nBoth said the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing, which Holmes, the\nAustralian virologist, also heard from another contact in China. But Gao said\neven he hadn\u2019t seen further details, and some experts suspect they may never\nbe released.\n\nWHO started negotiations with China for a further visit with the virus origins\nin mind, but it was China\u2019s Foreign Ministry that decided the terms.\n\nScientists were sidelined and politicians took control. China refused a visa\nfor Ben Embarek, then WHO\u2019s top animal virus expert. The itinerary dropped\nnearly all items linked to an origins search, according to draft agendas for\nthe trip obtained by the AP. And Gao, the then-head of the China CDC who is\nalso a respected scientist tasked with investigating the origins, was left off\nthe schedule.\n\nInstead, Liang Wannian, a politician in the Communist Party hierarchy, took\ncharge of the international delegation. Liang is an epidemiologist close to\ntop Chinese officials and China\u2019s Foreign Ministry who is widely seen as\npushing the party line, not science-backed policies, according to nine people\nfamiliar with the situation who declined to be identified to speak on a\nsensitive subject.\n\nLiang ruled in favor of shutting the Wuhan market at the beginning of the\noutbreak, according to a Chinese media interview with a top China CDC official\nthat was later deleted. Significantly, it was Liang who promoted an\nimplausible theory that the virus came from contaminated frozen food imported\ninto China. Liang did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nMost of the WHO delegation was not allowed to go to Wuhan, which was under\nlockdown. The few who did learned little. They again had no access to the\nWuhan Institute of Virology or the wildlife market and obtained only scant\ndetails about China CDC efforts to trace the coronavirus there.\n\nOn the train, Liang lobbied the visiting WHO scientists to praise China\u2019s\nhealth response in their public report. Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saw it as the \u201cbest way to\nmeet China\u2019s need for a strong assessment of its response.\u201d\n\nThe new section was so flattering that colleagues emailed Aylward to suggest\nhe \u201cdial it back a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is remarkable how much knowledge about a new virus has been gained in such\na short time,\u201d read the final report, which was reviewed by China\u2019s top health\nofficial before it went to Tedros.\n\nAs criticism of China grew, the Chinese government deflected blame. Instead of\nfiring health officials, they declared their virus response a success and\nclosed investigations into the officials with few job losses.\n\n\u201cThere were no real reforms, because doing reforms means admitting fault,\u201d\nsaid a public health expert in contact with Chinese health officials who asked\nnot to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nIn late February 2020, the internationally respected doctor Zhong Nanshan\nappeared at a news conference and said that \u201cthe epidemic first appeared in\nChina, but it did not necessarily originate in China.\u201d\n\nA policeman moves journalists back from a farewell event held for the last\ngroup of medical workers who came from outside Wuhan to help the city during\nthe coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan in central China\u2019s Hubei province on April\n15, 2020. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)\n\nDays later, Chinese leader Xi ordered new controls on virus research. A leaked\ndirective from China\u2019s Publicity Department ordered media not to report on the\nvirus origins without permission, and a public WeChat account reposted an\nessay claiming the U.S. military created COVID-19 at a Fort Detrick lab and\nspread it to China during a 2019 athletic competition in Wuhan. Days later, a\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson repeated the accusation.\n\nThe false claims enraged U.S. President Donald Trump, who began publicly\nblaming China for the outbreak, calling COVID-19 \u201cthe China virus\u201d and the\n\u201ckung-flu.\u201d\n\nChinese officials told WHO that blood tests on lab workers at the Wuhan\nInstitute of Virology were negative, suggesting COVID-19 wasn\u2019t the result of\na lab accident there. But when WHO pressed for an independent audit, Chinese\nofficials balked and demanded WHO investigate the U.S. and other countries as\nwell.\n\nBy blaming the U.S., Beijing diverted blame. It was effective in China, where\nmany Chinese were upset by racially charged criticism. But outside China, it\nfueled speculation of a lab leak coverup.\n\nBy the time WHO led another visit to Wuhan in January 2021, a year into the\npandemic, the atmosphere was toxic.\n\nLiang, the Chinese health official in charge of two earlier WHO visits,\ncontinued to promote the questionable theory that the virus was shipped into\nChina on frozen food. He suppressed information suggesting it could have come\nfrom animals at the Wuhan market, organizing market workers to tell WHO\nexperts no live wildlife was sold and cutting recent photos of wildlife at the\nmarket from the final report. There was heavy political scrutiny, with\nnumerous Chinese officials who weren\u2019t scientists or health officers present\nat meetings.\n\nDespite a lack of direct access, the WHO team concluded that a lab leak was\n\u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d So it was infuriating to Chinese officials when WHO\nchief Tedros said it was \u201cpremature\u201d to rule out the lab leak theory, saying\nsuch lab accidents were \u201ccommon,\u201d and pressed China to be more transparent.\n\nChina told WHO any future missions to find COVID-19 origins should be\nelsewhere, according to a letter obtained by AP. Since then, global\ncooperation on the issue has ground to a halt; an independent group convened\nby WHO to investigate the origins of COVID-19 in 2021 has been stymied by the\nlack of cooperation from China and other issues.\n\nChinese scientists are still under heavy pressure, according to 10 researchers\nand health officials. Researchers who published papers on the coronavirus ran\ninto trouble with Chinese authorities. Others were barred from travel abroad\nfor conferences and WHO meetings. Gao, the then-director of the China CDC, was\ninvestigated after U.S. President Joe Biden ordered a review of COVID-19 data,\nand again after giving interviews on the virus origins.\n\nNew evidence is treated with suspicion. In March 2023, scientists announced\nthat genetic material collected from the market showed raccoon dog DNA mixed\nwith COVID-19 in early 2020, data that WHO said should have been publicly\nshared years before. The findings were posted, then removed by Chinese\nresearchers with little explanation.\n\nThe head of the China CDC Institute of Viral Disease was forced to retire over\nthe release of the market data, according to a former China CDC official who\ndeclined to be named to speak on a sensitive topic.\n\n\u201cIt has to do with the origins, so they\u2019re still worried,\u201d the former official\nsaid. \u201cIf you try and get to the bottom of it, what if it turns out to be from\nChina?\u201d\n\nOther scientists note that any animal from which the virus may have originally\njumped has long since disappeared.\n\n\u201cThere was a chance for China to cooperate with WHO and do some animal\nsampling studies that might have answered the question,\u201d said Tulane\nUniversity\u2019s Garry. \u201cThe trail to find the source has now gone cold.\u201d\n\n## ___\n\nCheng reported from Geneva.\n\nDAKE KANG\n\nKang covers Chinese politics, technology and society from Beijing for The\nAssociated Press.
