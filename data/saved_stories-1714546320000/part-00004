The goal is to improve on-package connectivity,\nspanning all the way to 12.8 Tbps of bandwidth.\n\n\"As we bring more computational capability into the mass packaging, data\ntransfers become a challenge, but we find ourselves often limited by the I/O\nvendors,\" said Kevin Zhang, Vice President of Business Development at TSMC.\n\"At TSMC, we have spent many, many years working on silicon photonics. We have\nthe capability to bring silicon photonics close to the switching elements in\norder to create a very energy efficient high-speed signaling to address the\nfuture computation requirement.\"\n\nSilicon photonics is set to be a game-changer for future datacenters due to\nincreasing bandwidth demands that copper signaling just cannot meet. TSMC's\nsilicon photonics technology relies on the Compact Universal Photonic Engine\n(COUPE) that combines a 65nm electronic integrated circuit (EIC) with a\nphotonic integrated circuit (PIC) using the company's SoIC-X packaging\ntechnology. TSMC claims that its SoIC-X interconnection has very low\nimpedance, which means that COUPE is very efficient in terms of power usage.\n\n(Image credit: TSMC)\n\nThe development trajectory of COUPE has three major phases. TSMC's first\nsilicon photonics product is an optical engine for OSFP connectors (Octal\nSmall Form Factor Pluggable) that features a data transfer rate of 1.6 Tbps,\ntwice the maximum of current top-tier copper Ethernet solutions. This initial\niteration promises not just superior bandwidth but also improved power\nefficiency, addressing two critical concerns in modern datacenters. Subsequent\ngenerations of COUPE aim to push the boundaries further.\n\nThe second generation silicon photonics will integrate COUPE into CoWoS\npackaging (Chip on Wafer on Silicon) and features co-packaged optics with a\nswitch. This will enable motherboard-level optical interconnections with\nspeeds of up to 6.4 Tbps.\n\nThe third generation targets transfer rates of up to 12.8 Tbps and is designed\nto be integrated into processor packaging. This iteration is still in the\nexploratory phase, with no definite release timeframe. TSMC says it's looking\nat further reductions in power use and latency.\n\nTSMC's strategic pivot into the silicon photonics market, previously dominated\nby companies like GlobalFoundries, indicates a significant shift in the\ncompetitive landscape. By deploying its 3D Optical Engine, TSMC not only\nenters a crucial datacenter connectivity field, but it plans to significantly\nreduce power consumption of silicon photonics technology. This could\nsignificantly impact future chip designs, particularly in the area of AI\nworkloads where communication is becoming a significant bottleneck.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.
