For the 1915 silent film, see Do Unto Others\n(film).\n\n\"Golden Rule Sign\" that hung above the door of the employees' entrance to the\nAcme Sucker Rod Factory in Toledo, Ohio, 1913.\n\nThe Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as one would want to be\ntreated by them. It is sometimes called an ethics of reciprocity, meaning that\nyou should reciprocate to others how you would like them to treat you (not\nnecessarily how they actually treat you). Various expressions of this rule can\nbe found in the tenets of most religions and creeds through the ages.^[1]\n\nThe maxim may appear as a positive or negative injunction governing conduct:\n\n  * Treat others as you would like others to treat you (positive or directive form)^[1]\n  * Do not treat others in ways that you would not like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form)\n  * What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself (empathetic or responsive form)\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\nThe term \"Golden Rule\", or \"Golden law\", began to be used widely in the early\n17th century in Britain by Anglican theologians and preachers;^[2] the\nearliest known usage is that of Anglicans Charles Gibbon and Thomas Jackson in\n1604.^[3]\n\n## Ancient history[edit]\n\n### Ancient Egypt[edit]\n\nPossibly the earliest affirmation of the maxim of reciprocity, reflecting the\nancient Egyptian goddess Ma'at, appears in the story of \"The Eloquent\nPeasant\", which dates to the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040\u20131650 BCE): \"Now this is\nthe command: Do to the doer to make him do.\"^[4]^[5] This proverb embodies the\ndo ut des principle.^[6] A Late Period (c. 664\u2013323 BCE) papyrus contains an\nearly negative affirmation of the Golden Rule: \"That which you hate to be done\nto you, do not do to another.\"^[7]\n\n### Ancient India[edit]\n\n#### Sanskrit tradition[edit]\n\nIn Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, the ancient epic of India, there is a discourse in which sage\nBrihaspati tells the king Yudhishthira the following about dharma, a\nphilosophical understanding of values and actions that lend good order to\nlife:\n\n> One should never do something to others that one would regard as an injury\n> to one's own self. In brief, this is dharma. Anything else is succumbing to\n> desire.\n>\n> \u2014 Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata 13.114.8 (Critical edition)^[citation needed]\n\nThe Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is usually dated to the period between 400 BCE and 400\nCE.^[8]^[9]\n\n#### Tamil tradition[edit]\n\nIn Chapter 32 in the Book of Virtue of the Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37 (c. 1st century BCE to\n5th century CE), Valluvar says:\n\n> Do not do to others what you know has hurt yourself.\n>\n> \u2014 Kural 316^[10]\n\n> Why does one hurt others knowing what it is to be hurt?\n>\n> \u2014 Kural 318^[10]\n\nFurthermore, in verse 312, Valluvar says that it is the determination or code\nof the spotless (virtuous) not to do evil, even in return, to those who have\ncherished enmity and done them evil. According to him, the proper punishment\nto those who have done evil is to put them to shame by showing them kindness,\nin return and to forget both the evil and the good done on both sides (verse\n314).^[11]\n\n### Ancient Greece[edit]\n\nThe Golden Rule in its prohibitive (negative) form was a common principle in\nancient Greek philosophy. Examples of the general concept include:\n\n  * \"Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing.\" \u2013 Thales^[12] (c. 624 \u2013 c. 546 BCE)\n  * \"What you do not want to happen to you, do not do it yourself either.\" \u2013 Sextus the Pythagorean.^[13] The oldest extant reference to Sextus is by Origen in the third century of the common era.^[14]\n  * \"Ideally, no one should touch my property or tamper with it, unless I have given him some sort of permission, and, if I am sensible I shall treat the property of others with the same respect.\" \u2013 Plato^[15] (c. 420 \u2013 c. 347 BCE)\n  * \"Do not do to others that which angers you when they do it to you.\" \u2013 Isocrates^[16] (436\u2013338 BCE)\n  * \"It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living pleasantly.\" \u2013 Epicurus (341\u2013270 BC) where \"justly\" refers to \"an agreement made in reciprocal association ... against the infliction or suffering of harm.\"^[17]\n\n### Ancient Persia[edit]\n\nThe Pahlavi Texts of Zoroastrianism (c. 300 BCE \u2013 1000 CE) were an early\nsource for the Golden Rule: \"That nature alone is good which refrains from\ndoing to another whatsoever is not good for itself.\" Dadisten-I-dinik, 94,5,\nand \"Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others.\" Shayast-na-\nShayast 13:29^[18]\n\n### Ancient Rome[edit]\n\nSeneca the Younger (c. 4 BCE \u2013 65 CE), a practitioner of Stoicism (c. 300 BCE\n\u2013 200 CE) expressed a hierarchical variation of the Golden Rule in his Letter\n47, an essay regarding the treatment of slaves: \"Treat your inferior as you\nwould wish your superior to treat you.\"^[19]\n\n## Religious context[edit]\n\nThe golden rule, as described in numerous world religions\n\nAccording to Simon Blackburn, the Golden Rule \"can be found in some form in\nalmost every ethical tradition\".^[20] A multi-faith poster showing the Golden\nRule in sacred writings from 13 faith traditions (designed by Paul McKenna of\nScarboro Missions, 2000) has been on permanent display at the Headquarters of\nthe United Nations since 4 January 2002.^[21] Creating the poster \"took five\nyears of research that included consultations with experts in each of the 13\nfaith groups.\"^[21] (See also the section on Global Ethic.)\n\n### Abrahamic religions[edit]\n\nSee also: Abrahamic religions\n\n#### Judaism[edit]\n\nSee also: Judaism and Jewish ethics\n\nA rule of reciprocal altruism was stated positively in a well-known Torah\nverse (Hebrew: \u05d5\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05ea \u05dc\u05e8\u05e2\u05da \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05da):\n\n> You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love\n> your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.\n>\n> \u2014 Leviticus 19:18^[22]\n\nRashi commented what constitutes revenge and grudge, using the example of two\nmen. One man would not lend the other his ax, then the next day, the same man\nasks the other for his ax. If the second man should say, \"\u201cI will not lend it\nto you, just as you did not lend to me,\" it constitutes revenge; if \"Here it\nis for you; I am not like you, who did not lend me,\" it constitutes a grudge.\nRashi concludes his commentary by quoting Rabbi Akiva on love of neighbor:\n\"This is a fundamental [all-inclusive] principle of the Torah.\"^[23]\n\nHillel the Elder (c. 110 BCE \u2013 10 CE),^[24] used this verse as a most\nimportant message of the Torah for his teachings. Once, he was challenged by a\ngentile who asked to be converted under the condition that the Torah be\nexplained to him while he stood on one foot. Hillel accepted him as a\ncandidate for conversion to Judaism but, drawing on Leviticus 19:18, briefed\nthe man:\n\n> What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: this is the whole Torah;\n> the rest is the explanation; go and learn.\n>\n> \u2014 Babylonian Talmud^[25]\n\nHillel recognized brotherly love as the fundamental principle of Jewish\nethics. Rabbi Akiva agreed, while Simeon ben Azzai suggested that the\nprinciple of love must have its foundation in Genesis chapter 1, which teaches\nthat all men are the offspring of Adam, who was made in the image of\nGod.^[26]^[27] According to Jewish rabbinic literature, the first man Adam\nrepresents the unity of mankind. This is echoed in the modern preamble of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.^[28]^[29] And it is also taught, that\nAdam is last in order according to the evolutionary character of God's\ncreation:^[27]\n\n> Why was only a single specimen of man created first? To teach us that he who\n> destroys a single soul destroys a whole world and that he who saves a single\n> soul saves a whole world; furthermore, so no race or class may claim a\n> nobler ancestry, saying, 'Our father was born first'; and, finally, to give\n> testimony to the greatness of the Lord, who caused the wonderful diversity\n> of mankind to emanate from one type. And why was Adam created last of all\n> beings? To teach him humility; for if he be overbearing, let him remember\n> that the little fly preceded him in the order of creation.^[27]\n\nThe Jewish Publication Society's edition of Leviticus states:\n\n> Thou shalt not hate thy brother, in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy\n> neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. 18 Thou shalt not take\n> vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou\n> shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.^[30]\n\nThis Torah verse represents one of several versions of the Golden Rule, which\nitself appears in various forms, positive and negative. It is the earliest\nwritten version of that concept in a positive form.^[31]\n\nAt the turn of the era, the Jewish rabbis were discussing the scope of the\nmeaning of Leviticus 19:18 and 19:34 extensively:\n\n> The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as one of your citizens;\n> you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt:\n> I the LORD am your God.\n>\n> \u2014 Leviticus 19:34^[32]\n\nCommentators interpret that this applies to foreigners (= Samaritans),\nproselytes (= 'strangers who reside with you')^[33] and Jews.^[34]\n\nOn the verse, \"Love your fellow as yourself\", the classic commentator Rashi\nquotes from Torat Kohanim, an early Midrashic text regarding the famous dictum\nof Rabbi Akiva: \"Love your fellow as yourself \u2013 Rabbi Akiva says this is a\ngreat principle of the Torah.\"^[35]\n\nIsrael's postal service quoted from the previous Leviticus verse when it\ncommemorated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on a 1958 postage\nstamp.^[36]\n\n#### Christianity[edit]\n\nSee also: Christian ethics and Great Commandment\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount by Carl Bloch (1877) portrays Jesus teaching during\nthe Sermon on the Mount\n\nThe \"Golden Rule\" was proclaimed by Jesus of Nazareth^[37] during his Sermon\non the Mount and described by him as the second great commandment. The common\nEnglish phrasing is \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". A\nsimilar form of the phrase appeared in a Catholic catechism around 1567\n(certainly in the reprint of 1583).^[38] Various applications of the Golden\nRule are stated positively numerous times in the Old Testament: \"Thou shalt\nnot avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou\nshalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"^[39] Or, in Leviticus 19:34: \"But treat\nthem just as you treat your own citizens. Love foreigners as you love\nyourselves, because you were foreigners one time in Egypt. I am the Lord your\nGod.\".^[40]\n\nThe Old Testament Deuterocanonical books of Tobit and Sirach, accepted as part\nof the Scriptural canon by Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and the Non-\nChalcedonian Churches, express a negative form of the golden rule:\n\n> \"Do to no one what you yourself dislike.\"\n>\n> \u2014 Tobit 4:15\n\n> Recognize that your neighbor feels as you do, and keep in mind your own\n> dislikes.\n>\n> \u2014 Sirach 31:15\n\nTwo passages in the New Testament quote Jesus of Nazareth espousing the\npositive form of the Golden rule:\n\n> Do to others what you want them to do to you. This is the meaning of the law\n> of Moses and the teaching of the prophets.\n>\n> \u2014 Matthew 7:12\n\n> And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.\n>\n> \u2014 Luke 6:31^[41]\n\nA similar passage, a parallel to the Great Commandment, is Luke 10:25.^[42]\n\n> Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, \"Teacher, what\n> shall I do to inherit eternal life?\"\n>\n> He said to him, \"What is written in the law? How do you read it?\"\n>\n> He answered, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all\n> your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and love your\n> neighbor as yourself.\"\n>\n> He said to him, \"You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.\"\n\nThe passage in the book of Luke then continues with Jesus answering the\nquestion, \"Who is my neighbor?\", by telling the parable of the Good Samaritan,\nwhich John Wesley interprets as meaning that \"your neighbor\" is anyone in\nneed.^[43]\n\nJesus' teaching goes beyond the negative formulation of not doing what one\nwould not like done to themselves, to the positive formulation of actively\ndoing good to another that, if the situations were reversed, one would desire\nthat the other would do for them. This formulation, as indicated in the\nparable of the Good Samaritan, emphasizes the needs for positive action that\nbrings benefit to another, not simply restraining oneself from negative\nactivities that hurt another.^[44]\n\nIn one passage of the New Testament, Paul the Apostle refers to the golden\nrule, restating Jesus' second commandment:\n\n> For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy\n> neighbour as thyself.\n>\n> \u2014 Galatians 5:14^[45]\n\nSt. Paul also comments on the golden rule in the book of Romans:\n\n> The commandments, \"You shall not commit adultery\", \"You shall not murder\",\n> \"You shall not steal\", \"You shall not covet\", and whatever other command\n> there may be, are summed up in this one command: \"Love your neighbor as\n> yourself.\"^[46]\n\n#### Islam[edit]\n\nSee also: Islamic ethics\n\nThe Arabian peninsula was known to not practice the golden rule prior to the\nadvent of Islam. According to Th. Emil Homerin: \"Pre-Islamic Arabs regarded\nthe survival of the tribe, as most essential and to be ensured by the ancient\nrite of blood vengeance.\"^[47] Homerin goes on to say:\n\n> Similar examples of the golden rule are found in the hadith of the prophet\n> Muhammad. The hadith recount what the prophet is believed to have said and\n> done, and traditionally Muslims regard the hadith as second to only the\n> Qur'an as a guide to correct belief and action.^[48]\n\nFrom the hadith, the collected oral and written accounts of Muhammad and his\nteachings during his lifetime:\n\n> A Bedouin came to the prophet, grabbed the stirrup of his camel and said: O\n> the messenger of God! Teach me something to go to heaven with it. Prophet\n> said: \"As you would have people do to you, do to them; and what you dislike\n> to be done to you, don't do to them. Now let the stirrup go! [This maxim is\n> enough for you; go and act in accordance with it!]\"\n>\n> \u2014 Kitab al-Kafi, Volume 2, Book 1, Chapter 66:10^[49]\n\n> None of you [truly] believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes\n> for himself.\n>\n> \u2014 An-Nawawi's Forty Hadith 13 (p. 56)^[50]\n\n> Seek for mankind that of which you are desirous for yourself, that you may\n> be a believer.\n>\n> \u2014 Sukhanan-i-Muhammad (Teheran, 1938)^[51]\n\n> That which you want for yourself, seek for mankind.^[51]\n\n> The most righteous person is the one who consents for other people what he\n> consents for himself, and who dislikes for them what he dislikes for\n> himself.^[51]\n\nAli ibn Abi Talib (4th Caliph in Sunni Islam, and first Imam in Shia Islam)\nsays:\n\n> O my child, make yourself the measure (for dealings) between you and others.\n> Thus, you should desire for others what you desire for yourself and hate for\n> others what you hate for yourself.

As part of the prohibition of causing any\nliving beings to suffer, Jainism forbids inflicting upon others what is\nharmful to oneself.\n\nThe following line from the Acaranga Sutra sums up the philosophy of Jainism:\n\n> Nothing which breathes, which exists, which lives, or which has essence or\n> potential of life, should be destroyed or ruled over, or subjugated, or\n> harmed, or denied of its essence or potential. In support of this Truth, I\n> ask you a question \u2013 \"Is sorrow or pain desirable to you?\" If you say \"yes\n> it is\", it would be a lie.

Epstein, a Humanist chaplain at Harvard University, \"\n'do unto others' ... is a concept that essentially no religion misses\nentirely. But not a single one of these versions of the golden rule requires a\nGod\".^[76] Various sources identify the Golden Rule as a humanist\nprinciple:^[77]^[78]\n\n> Trying to live according to the Golden Rule means trying to empathise with\n> other people, including those who may be very different from us. Empathy is\n> at the root of kindness, compassion, understanding and respect \u2013 qualities\n> that we all appreciate being shown, whoever we are, whatever we think and\n> wherever we come from. And although it isn't possible to know what it really\n> feels like to be a different person or live in different circumstances and\n> have different life experiences, it isn't difficult for most of us to\n> imagine what would cause us suffering and to try to avoid causing suffering\n> to others. For this reason many people find the Golden Rule's corollary \u2013\n> \"do not treat people in a way you would not wish to be treated yourself\" \u2013\n> more pragmatic.^[77]\n>\n> \u2014 Maria MacLachlan, Think Humanism^[79]\n\n> Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you. [is] (...)\n> the single greatest, simplest, and most important moral axiom humanity has\n> ever invented, one which reappears in the writings of almost every culture\n> and religion throughout history, the one we know as the Golden Rule. Moral\n> directives do not need to be complex or obscure to be worthwhile, and in\n> fact, it is precisely this rule's simplicity which makes it great. It is\n> easy to come up with, easy to understand, and easy to apply, and these three\n> things are the hallmarks of a strong and healthy moral system.

'To do as you would be done by,' and 'to love your\nneighbour as yourself,' constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian\nmorality.\"^[82]\n\n## Other contexts[edit]\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\nAccording to Marc H. Bornstein, and William E. Paden, the Golden Rule is\narguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of human rights, in\nwhich each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal\nresponsibility to ensure justice for others.^[83]\n\nHowever, Leo Damrosch argued that the notion that the Golden Rule pertains to\n\"rights\" per se is a contemporary interpretation and has nothing to do with\nits origin. The development of human \"rights\" is a modern political ideal that\nbegan as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of Jean\nJacques Rousseau in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced\nThomas Jefferson, who then incorporated Rousseau's reference to \"inalienable\nrights\" into the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776. Damrosch\nargued that to confuse the Golden Rule with human rights is to apply\ncontemporary thinking to ancient concepts.^[84]\n\n## Science and economics[edit]\n\nFurther information: Reciprocity (social psychology) and Reciprocal altruism\n\nThere has been research published arguing that some 'sense' of fair play and\nthe Golden Rule may be stated and rooted in terms of neuroscientific and\nneuroethical principles.^[85]\n\nThe Golden Rule can also be explained from the perspectives of psychology,\nphilosophy, sociology, human evolution, and economics. Psychologically, it\ninvolves a person empathizing with others. Philosophically, it involves a\nperson perceiving their neighbor also as \"I\" or \"self\".^[86] Sociologically,\n\"love your neighbor as yourself\" is applicable between individuals, between\ngroups, and also between individuals and groups. In evolution, \"reciprocal\naltruism\" is seen as a distinctive advance in the capacity of human groups to\nsurvive and reproduce, as their exceptional brains demanded exceptionally long\nchildhoods and ongoing provision and protection even beyond that of the\nimmediate family.^[87] In economics, Richard Swift, referring to ideas from\nDavid Graeber, suggests that \"without some kind of reciprocity society would\nno longer be able to exist.\"^[88]\n\nStudy of other primates provides evidence that the Golden Rule exists in other\nnon-human species.^[89]\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\nPhilosophers such as Immanuel Kant^[90] and Friedrich Nietzsche^[91] have\nobjected to the rule on a variety of grounds. One is the epistemic question of\ndetermining how others want to be treated. The obvious way is to ask them, but\nthey might give duplicitous answers if they find this strategically useful,\nand they might also fail to understand the details of the choice situation as\nyou understand it. We might also be biased to perceiving harms and benefits to\nourselves more than to others, which could lead to escalating conflict if we\nare suspicious of others. Hence Linus Pauling suggested that we introduce a\nbias towards others into the golden rule: \"Do unto others 20 percent better\nthan you would have them to unto you-to correct for subjective bias.\"^[92]\n\nOne religion that officially rejects the Golden Rule is the Neo-Nazi religion\nof the \"Creativity Movement\" founded by Ben Klassen.^[93] Followers of the\nreligion believe that the Golden Rule doesn't make sense and is a \"completely\nunworkable principle.\"^[94]\n\n### Differences in values or interests[edit]\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw wrote, \"Do not do unto others as you would that they\nshould do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same.\"^[95] This suggests that\nif your values are not shared with others, the way you want to be treated will\nnot be the way they want to be treated. Hence, the Golden Rule of \"do unto\nothers\" is \"dangerous in the wrong hands\",^[96] according to philosopher Iain\nKing, because \"some fanatics have no aversion to death: the Golden Rule might\ninspire them to kill others in suicide missions.\"^[97]\n\nWalter Terence Stace, in The Concept of Morals (1937) argued that Shaw's\nremark\n\n> ...seems to overlook the fact that \"doing as you would be done by\" includes\n> taking into account your neighbour's tastes as you would that he should take\n> yours into account. Thus the \"golden rule\" might still express the essence\n> of a universal morality even if no two men in the world had any needs or\n> tastes in common.^[98]\n\n### Differences in situations[edit]\n\nImmanuel Kant famously criticized the golden rule for not being sensitive to\ndifferences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly convicted of a crime\ncould appeal to the golden rule while asking the judge to release him,\npointing out that the judge would not want anyone else to send him to prison,\nso he should not do so to others.^[90] On the other hand, in a critique of the\nconsistency of Kant's writings, several authors have noted the\n\"similarity\"^[99] between the Golden Rule and Kant's Categorical Imperative,\nintroduced in Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals (See discussion at this\nlink).\n\nThis was perhaps a well-known objection, as Leibniz actually responded to it\nlong before Kant made it, suggesting that the judge should put himself in the\nplace, not merely of the criminal, but of all affected persons and then\njudging each option (to inflict punishment, or release the criminal, etc.) by\nwhether there was a \u201cgreater good in which this lesser evil was\nincluded.\u201d^[100]\n\n### Other responses to criticisms[edit]\n\nMarcus George Singer observed that there are two importantly different ways of\nlooking at the golden rule: as requiring (1) that you perform specific actions\nthat you want others to do to you or (2) that you guide your behavior in the\nsame general ways that you want others to.^[101] Counter-examples to the\ngolden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.\n\nIn his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation\nthat such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain\ngeneral ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste or situation, failing to\ncompensate for subjective bias, etc.) But if we apply the golden rule to our\nown method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to\napply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since\nothers' ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It\nfollows that we should not do so ourselves\u2014according to the golden rule. In\nthis way, the golden rule may be self-correcting.^[102] An article by Jouni\nReinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.^[103]\n\nIt is possible, then, that the golden rule can itself guide us in identifying\nwhich differences of situation are morally relevant. We would often want other\npeople to ignore any prejudice against our race or nationality when deciding\nhow to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing\npreferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on. This principle of\n\"doing unto others, wherever possible, as they would be done by...\" has\nsometimes been termed the platinum rule.^[104]\n\n## Popular references[edit]\n\nCharles Kingsley's The Water Babies (1863) includes a character named Mrs Do-\nAs-You-Would-Be-Done-By (and another, Mrs Be-Done-By-As-You-Did).^[105]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Empathy\n  * Eye for an eye\n  * General welfare clause\n  * Kali's morality - a literary example of character not using the Golden Rule\n  * Norm of reciprocity, social norm of in-kind responses to the behavior of others\n  * Reciprocity (cultural anthropology), way of defining people's informal exchange of goods and labour\n  * Reciprocity (evolution), mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation\n  * Reciprocity (international relations), principle that favours, benefits, or penalties that are granted by one state to the citizens or legal entities of another, should be returned in kind\n  * Reciprocity (social and political philosophy), concept of reciprocity as in-kind positive or negative responses for the actions of others; relation to justice; related ideas such as gratitude, mutuality, and the Golden Rule\n  * Reciprocity (social psychology), in-kind positive or negative responses of individuals towards the actions of others\n  * Serial reciprocity, where the benefactor of a gift or service will in turn provide benefits to a third party\n  * Ubuntu (philosophy), an ethical philosophy originating from Southern Africa, which has been summarised as 'A person is a person through other people'\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Antony Flew, ed.
