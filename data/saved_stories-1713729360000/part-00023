In \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d Jane Austen\nimplies that he is a picky paramour, since he likes a beloved to have \u201cfine\neyes\u201d, \u201ca thorough knowledge of music\u201d and a mind improved \u201cby extensive\nreading\u201d. But read actual Georgian \u201clonely heart\u201d advertisements and it is\nclear that Mr Darcy was pretty lax. Others were much fussier, demanding, among\nother things, that their beloveds be \u201cnot fat\u201d, have \u201ca good set of Teeth\u201d,\nand a bosom that is \u201cfull, plump, firm and white\u201d.\n\nBritain\u2019s affair with lonely-hearts ads is more than 300 years old but it is\nnow all but over. Another infatuation, for dating apps, has taken their place.\nThis year, for the first time, Tinder is running ads in British cinemas, which\ntempt viewers to \u201cjust go out and find\u201d someone. Modern Britons have adopted\nthe apps\u2019 turns of phrase (\u201cswipe right\u201d has entered the vernacular); some\nclaim an addiction to them.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get unlimited access to The Economist\n\n### Explore all our independent journalism with a one-month free trial.
