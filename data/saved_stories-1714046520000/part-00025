Fitzgerald is one of my favourite writers. I have loved her novels\nand biographies ever since I first discovered The Bookshop on a hot and boring\nafternoon in Cambridge fifteen years ago. I read them again while I was\nrecovering from chemotherapy a few years ago. In the final edit of the book,\nFitzgerald has a short section. This is the full chapter, which I didn\u2019t have\nroom for. It\u2019s long for a Substack post, but if there are any readers who will\nappreciate an in-depth discussion of this great writer it is surely all of\nyou.

In the 1980s and 1990s she wrote\nsome of the great fiction of the twentieth century. She won the Booker Prize\nin 1979 (and was nominated another three times) and the American National\nBooks Critics Circle Award in 1998. Philip Hensher said, after she died, \u201cOf\nall the novelists of the last quarter-century, she has the most unarguable\nclaim on greatness.\u201d To A.S. Byatt, she was \u201cJane Austen\u2019s nearest heir for\nprecision and invention.\u201d Robert McCrum included her in his list of the\nhundred best novels. Despite the fact that she initially had to endure the\nsort of reviews women were given in the 1980s (Valentine Cunningham called The\nBookshop \u201canguished women\u2019s fiction\u201d) her reputation has grown since she died\nin 2000 and she is being realised as one of the great writers of the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nPenelope Fitzgerald had been expected to be a prodigy. She was a Knox, a\nfamily of writers, thinkers, code breakers, and priests. It was competitive\nand intellectual. She went to the same Oxford college as her mother (who died\nwhen she was eighteen), and wrote when she went down that she was ready to\nstart writing. The fact that she was fifty-eight, rather than twenty-one, when\nher first book came out is the big mystery of her life. Why did she start so\nlate?\n\nTwo basic answers have been given to this question. The first is men: her\nhusband was a hindrance, emotionally and financially. His drinking, a failed\ncareer at the bar, and an erratic life caused by the pursuit of creditors,\nleft Fitzgerald with little time or energy for writing. For many years she\nslept on a sofa bed in the sitting room. And her intense childhood might have\nbeen a burden. In support of this, we might cite the fact that she began her\nfirst book just after her father died and her second as her husband lay dying.\n\nThe other answer given is that she wasn\u2019t, in fact, such a late starter.\nCritics point to her childhood stories, anonymous reviews for the Times\nLiterary Supplement, her probable contributions to Desmond\u2019s history of the\nIrish Guards, and the literary magazine she and Desmond ran together when the\nchildren were little. There were also four short stories she wrote earlier in\nlife: two as a young child, two in the 1950s when she was a mother.\n(Fitzgerald wrote very few short stories overall.) We know about these from a\nnotebook entry where she listed them with dates in 1997, when she was eighty-\none. The title of the first story on the list, written aged six, was later\nlightly crossed out. As an undergraduate, she wrote brief paragraph length\nparodies of Victorian and Edwardian fiction along with some other\ncontributions to the university magazine. It also seems likely that she\npublished a short story under her husband\u2019s name in 1951, but this is\nimpossible to verify. Taken together these are meant to provide an explanation\nfor the fact that Penelope started writing fiction when most other people\nstart retiring. The most recent critical study, part of the Writers at Work\nseries, manages to take both of these standard lines that Desmond held her\nback and that she wasn\u2019t a late starter at all.\n\nThis matters because Fitzgerald\u2019s work is deeply biographical. Her early\nbooks, The Bookshop, Offshore, At Freddies, Human Voices, have obvious roots\nin her own life. The children\u2019s names in Offshore are remarkably close to her\nown daughters\u2019 names, and the vivid, detailed stories about them are thought\nto be accurate representations of the state of the family. (In the manuscript,\nFitzgerald used her own children\u2019s names throughout.) While the later books\nare based on immense, detailed research, there are clear resonances with her\nlife and earlier work, such as the state of the marriage in The Beginning of\nSpring, or the discussion of materialism which occurred first in The Bookshop.\nFitzgerald believed in poltergeists and was a quietly, but deeply, religious\nperson. Her life was transmogrified into art. Even for those late novels,\nFitzgerald\u2019s life experiences are essential. She could not have written them\nas a younger woman. And not just because she was reshaping and reworking her\nexperiences. Her ethical views were profoundly informed by her experiences.\n\nIn one interview she made a remark usually thought to be cryptic, but which we\nmight see as a plain, factual statement, almost a double-bluff: \u2018I think you\ncan write at any time of your life.\u2019 Without dismissing the other explanations\nof Fitzgerald\u2019s lateness, it is time to start taking this one more seriously.\nHer talents bloomed best late in life. Critics often see her public statements\nas a pose: she pretended to be an old English lady, not a steely novelist of\ngenius. In fact, she was both. Why must these identities be incompatible?\nFitzgerald inherited the culture of understatement that her father and uncles\nhad learned at Eton. This wasn\u2019t just a decoy. She told Peter Lennon in 1998,\nwhen he accused her of being modest, \u2018all modesty is considered false\nmodesty... I don\u2019t really think it is modesty, I think it is a temperament,\nthat you feel you are either one of life\u2019s winners or life\u2019s losers.\u2019 Lennon\ndecided that labels like modesty were insufficient. Instead, he said she had\nan \u201calert repose.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to take her statement that \u2018you can write at any time in your\nlife\u2019 at face value precisely because she lived such a turbulent life. (Also\nbecause at other times she said it was for other reasons, such as because the\nchildren had grown up. Her comments in interviews were often ironic or\nevasive.) The circumstances of her marriage make her a prime example of a\nwoman born during the First World War held back because she was a woman. The\npresence of some juvenalia and early reviews cannot justify this. Most people\nwho write anonymous reviews for the TLS don\u2019t become genius novelists. This\nlooks at her life backwards. One of the remarkable things about Hermione Lee\u2019s\nPenelope Fitzgerald: A Life is the way it shows that until her late thirties,\nwhen the children were young, Fitzgerald lived an interesting, bohemian,\nHampstead life, until the money and credit ran out. It was just one that\ndidn\u2019t involve writing any fiction.\n\nNot until The Bookshop (published in 1978 when Fitzgerald was 62) did\nFitzgerald produce a serious work of fiction. She had her children in her\nthirties, and once she started teaching she could, presumably, have made time\nto write, as writers like William Golding did, during school hours. Not all\nthe women novelists of the twentieth century lived easy lives. As well as the\nvicissitudes of her life, her father, and her marriage, there must be\nsomething about Fitzgerald herself that explains her late start. We risk not\ntaking her seriously if we think that a difficult marriage and a teaching job\nare enough to turn a potential genius into a mute inglorious Milton. Of\ncourse, she might have failed. There are times when it seems as if life might\nhave got her down for good. There is a long unwritable history of great talent\nfailing to prosper. That is exactly why Fitzgerald\u2019s story is so important.\n\nWhen she interviewed the South African novelist Christopher Hope in 1989, just\nafter she had published the first of her four great historical novels,\nFitzgerald said, in a quiet aside, \u2018Comedy is a very much more cruel thing\nthan tragedy.\u2019 This aphorism applies to Fitzgerald\u2019s life, as well as her\nfiction. Like a comedy, it seems to have a happy resolution. The disorder and\nconfusion of her early life are turned into a series of highly respected,\nsuccessful novels. But tragedy has a release. There is an endpoint. In her own\nlife, Penelope Fitzgerald was often trapped with no sight of how things would\nbe resolved. Her characters are often in a similar position. Wendy Lesser\ncompares her work to Vermeer, who shows us a snapshot that \u2018feels like an\neternity\u2019. The endings of The Bookshop, Offshore, and The Beginning of Spring\nare deeply ambivalent. There is no sign things are guaranteed to get better,\neven though the disasters have, perhaps, been avoided. It is like watching a\ncouple drive off leaving their wedding guests feeling uneasy about the\nsuitability of the match. In the margins of her copy of Middlemarch,\nFitzgerald wrote, \u2018The characters\u2019 prospects narrow as the novel closes.\u2019 She\nwrote that in her fifties, when her husband Desmond had been disbarred for\nstealing money, when she lived in a council flat after her houseboat had sunk,\nand when she had taken on laborious teaching work, to keep the family\nfinancially stable. It is difficult not to see it as a personal comment as\nwell as a literary one.\n\nIf we can stop seeing Fitzgerald as \u2018late\u2019, and appreciate the role her life\nplayed in the development of her moral views, we might see that her fiction\narrived at the right juncture. Yes she finally had the mental space to write\n(often scribbling on the backs of envelopes in the staff room), but she had\nalso lived a life that enabled her to write a sort-of tragi-comic wisdom\nliterature.\n\nHer life was spent immersed in European culture. After Desmond got disbarred\nand became a travel agent\u2019s clerk, she went on package holidays which he could\nbook for them. They sat in the rafters at the opera with their own sandwiches.\nAs a teacher, the books she most admired and kept coming back to were works\nlike Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, by James Joyce. From Fitzgerald\u2019s\nannotated teaching books, Lee gleaned the details of Fitzgerald\u2019s second,\nlifelong education. This long accretion of knowledge is something separate\nfrom her childhood and Oxford education, and is an essential part of the\nexplanation to the question, \u2018How did she do it?\u2019 If we want to understand how\nshe created what Wendy Lesser calls the Russianness and Germanness of her late\nbooks, we have to look to her life as a teacher, student, and traveller, not\njust as a put-upon wife of squashed brilliance. Both stories are true.\n\nWe should no more assume these novels were ready and waiting to be written if\nonly it were not for the demands of family life than we should explain the\nfact that Montaigne started writing when he did because the world was keeping\nhim busy as a bureaucrat before. The time they spent living first was an\nessential part of what made them both great writers. The other explanations\nslightly overlook the fact that both Penelope and Desmond were hapless, and\nsimply bad at living.\n\nUltimately, the biggest influence on her fiction was something she could only\nlearn by experience. Who knows, if she had been a prodigy, she might not have\nbeen any good. As she wrote in Offshore: \u2018not being wanted is a positive\ncondition.\u2019 Reviewing The Gate of Angels, Victoria Glendinning drew the lesson\nthat it is a mistake to think \u2018there is only one explanation for who we are\nand what happens to us.\u2019\n\nIt is time to apply that lesson to Fitzgerald\u2019s own life.\n\n####\n\nA kitchen-table novelist\n\nAt 106 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, a part of west London where artists, thinkers,\nand writers have often lived, sixty houseboats are moored on the river Thames.\nThere is a persistent smell of river, a mix of salt and dank. Birds pick at\nthe low tide detritus: ravens, geese, moorhens, and pigeons. Behind the\nmoorings are the tall towers of the World\u2019s End housing estate; opposite the\nneat, well-kept boats are glass blocks of flats. It wasn\u2019t like that in 1960\nwhen Penelope Fitzgerald and her family moved into a damp, leaky houseboat\ncalled Grace. What does remain, apart from the terraced houses, the smell, and\nthe birds, is the Lots Road power station and, on the opposite bank, St Mary\u2019s\nBattersea, an eighteenth century church whose quoins shine in the sun.\n\nShe wrote a portrait of life on the river, twenty years later, in Offshore, a\nnovel which ends with a flood; in reality, after three years, the Fitzgeralds\u2019\nhouseboat sank. This was fitting. Desmond was drunk and disbarred. They had\nleft London to avoid creditors and could only afford to return to the boat.\nPenelope had a teaching job to provide the family with more income than\nDesmond could manage and to compensate for how much he spent on drinking.\nTheir whole lives seemed to be sinking.\n\nThis is not how she had started. From letters to her university friend Hugh\nLee, we can see glimpses of her life as a young graduate in 1939, twenty-one\nyears before she lived on the boat. We see her going to the ballet with\nfriends, going through several \u201cnot very serious engagements\u201d, going to a\n\u201cdreadful diplomatic party\u201d, going to the country to \u201cget some air\u201d; but we do\nnot see her writing. When she does mention writing she says, \u201cit is one of my\nminor ambitions to write as good letters as you do.\u201d In 1940 she moved from\nworking for the civil service to the BBC. It was a demanding position. \u201cI have\nhad to sign their grasping contract which says that I have to devote all my\ntime attention and skills, within reasonable limits, to the service of the\nCorporation.\u201d\n\nThis might indicate the strain of her work (she did have to sleep there\nsometimes) or it might simply be part of a general unworldliness about\nFitzgerald. She wrote to her editor in 1979, \u201cI\u2019m not the sort of person who\never has any money.\u201d In 1999 she wrote to another editor, in a discussion of\ncopyright, \u201cI feel this paragraph makes me sound stupider than I am. But I\u2019m\njust no good at business.\u201d The main character in The Bookshop, Florence,\nthinks that if she always knew where she was \u201cdown to the last three\nfarthings\u201d as she ought to, to keep the accounts of her business, \u201cshe would\nnot have the courage to carry on for another day.\u201d It\u2019s possible to overstate\nthis side of Fitzgerald. Her editor Stuart Priffit said, \u2018you could sometimes\nfeel she was impractical but then she would cut through in the most direct way\nand showed she knew exactly what was going on.\u2019 Nonetheless, Fitzgerald was so\nunversed in money her daughters didn\u2019t think she knew what a mortgage was. She\ndescribes a contract between two bookstores, where one supplies the other with\nbooks for a small lending library, as \u201csuggestive of a moral philosophy, or\nthe laws of an ideal state, rather than a business transaction.\u201d She thought\nmoney was a \u201ctedious and ungetroundable problem\u201d. Her PR man, she said,\n\u201cabsolutely despairs of me, but it is no good pretending to be what you are\nnot.\u201d\n\nHer impracticality ran deep. She once couldn\u2019t change a typewriter ribbon\ncorrectly, even though \u201cthe booklet says, in four languages, that it\u2019s a very\nsimple operation.\u201d It is quite likely, however, that she could read all four\nlanguages. When she won the Booker Prize she said she would use the money to\nbuy an iron and a typewriter, an example of what many see as her pose as a\nlittle old lady. Her reasons for buying the typewriter were revealing though,\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to have an electric one, you see, with a self threading\nribbon, so you don\u2019t get your fingers dirty.\u201d This sort of thing was a pose to\ndisarm interviewers, but it was also based in reality.\n\nShe also called life at the BBC \u201cnot exactly tedious\u201d but depressing: \u201cI have\nto eat all the time to keep my spirits up.\u201d She didn\u2019t lack material to write\nabout in her twenties: her time at the BBC was the basis of her fourth book\nHuman Voices, written when she was sixty-three. She stopped working for the\nBBC in 1945. She was writing reviews for Punch and scripts for the BBC. She\nwas well regarded but some of her work started to come in below her usual\nquality. Desmond came home with war trauma, waking in the night screaming.\nPenelope had a miscarriage and a baby that died shortly after birth. She was\nthirty-one when her first surviving child was born. Lee says of Fitzgerald\u2019s\nsub-par work, \u201cthere were signs of strain.\u201d No wonder she was a pessimist. She\nwrote to her daughter over thirty years later, \u201cyou\u2019ve often told me that I\u2019m\nan old bag, who says nothing will turn out well.\u201d This is a strand of thought\nthat developed throughout her life. Writing to a friend about her husband\nDesmond coming back at the end of the war with jaundice (they married in 1942)\nshe said: \u201cit\u2019s a mistake to look forward to anything too much in this world.\u201d\n\nThe big question hanging over this period is whether she would have started\nwriting fiction if it weren\u2019t for the strain of marrying Desmond. Hermione Lee\nthinks Fitzgerald showed all the signs of someone who would have started\nwriting in their thirties. Of course, Penelope was writing: scripts, film\nreviews, science and children\u2019s programmes, and a special for Woman\u2019s Hour.\nShe took this work seriously. In 1950, the Fitzgeralds took on the editorship\nof a literary magazine. They also moved house and decorated it fashionably,\nwith black walls and ceramics, some of them her own. She was taking pottery\nlessons in Hampstead and practising her drawing. She was regarded by\nacquaintances as a knowledgeable, artistic, and literary person. It is a\nmistake to think that there was no creative time or space available to\nPenelope at this period.\n\nNor should Desmond be blamed, or not entirely. The novelist Philip Hensher,\nreviewing Lee\u2019s biography, said \u201cThe name of the catastrophe was Desmond.\nThough plausible and, by many accounts, personally charming, Desmond was a\nfeckless alcoholic who could not sustain much of a career.\u201d Hensher sees\nDesmond as the interruption, saying Fitzgerad\u2019s \u201cprofessional experience was\nseamless and well-considered before she met Desmond; it starts to move again\nvery efficiently in the very last years of his life.\u201d True enough. But we have\nseen there was space for Fitzgerald to be creative. And to blame Desmond is to\ntake a straightforward view of complicated things. Many lives were affected by\nthe war. As Penelope said, in a very different context, \u201cnothing is ever all\nanybody\u2019s fault.\u201d It would also be misleading to say that Desmond was entirely\na burden to Penelope. After he died, she wrote to a friend, \u201cthe truth is I\nwas spoilt, as with all our ups and downs Desmond always thought everything I\ndid was right.\u201d She wrote later to the same friend: \u201cI really don\u2019t see how\none can do without a family.\u201d Talking to the Guardian in 1998 she said, \u201cThe\nsort of men I like are life\u2019s losers. They struggle gallantly, but they really\nought to be left in peace.\u201d If she did make a choice between her family and\nher art, however conscious, however much choice she really had, she didn\u2019t\nentirely regret it. These were partly years of impediment, partly, as her son-\nin-law says, \u201cThe years when, as Cervantes said to explain his own long\nsilence, she was living her life.\u201d\n\nCertainly her life was exhausting. In the 1960s and 1970s her letters are full\nof references to her tiredness. On one occasion, she fell asleep in the\nBritish Library and was woken up by the man sitting next to her. In 1977, the\nyear Desmond died, she wrote to a friend, \u201cI think we middle-class ladies are\nreally driving ourselves mad by doing all the things that were formally done\nby a \u2018staff\u2019 and keeping up our cultural interests as well \u2014 tho\u2019 there you\nare, we can\u2019t help it. But when I lived in the council flat I noticed the\nother ladies seemed to have time to stand on their doorsteps and talk to each\nother all day, and I thought they managed better than I did.\u201d There is a clear\nimage of a woman struggling under the many demands of her life here; but also\nof a woman with time, space, and energy for \u201ccultural interests\u201d. These were\nwide ranging and significant to her later writing.\n\nBeing hassled was never an impediment when she was a novelist; quite the\nopposite. She wrote in the staff room between lessons, scribbling on the back\nof envelopes. (She wrote to her editor in 1980, \u201cI have found various small\nbits on the backs of envelopes that should have gone in, but perhaps it\u2019s too\nlate to do this.\u201d) Working at the BBC might have precluded this sort of\nwriting, but it is an instructive parallel. She seemed to thrive in busy\nenvironments. When she moved to Somerset with her daughter and son-in-law in\n1982, she said in a letter: \u201cI personally can only write in London, I love the\nnoise and squalor and the perpetual distractions.\u201d\n\nIt would be absurd to compare this with the strains of Desmond\u2019s war trauma,\ndrinking, and uncertain income. But we also cannot see her as simply prevented\nfrom writing by the business of her life as a wife and mother. In the last\nyear of her life she wrote that most women will always be \u201ckitchen-table\nwriters\u201d. Unable to write any other way, \u201ca woman, in my experience, can pick\nup her draft novel and go on with it, precisely until the telephone, the\ndoorbell, the egg timer, or the alarm rings.\u201d She compared this to the way\nNapoleon could nap for ten minutes exactly. This wasn\u2019t something she was\nhappy about \u2014 she was by no means romanticising the realities of women\u2019s\nlives. But she said that once she left teaching she missed the staff room\n\u201cfull of undercurrents of exhaustion, worry, and reproach\u201d. Those are the\nundercurrents of her fiction, too. For a long time after she retired, sitting\nin silence meant, \u201cI could scarcely get anything written.\u201d\n\n####\n\nA snapshot that feels like an eternity.\n\nAll of this has to be put in the context that Fitzgerald didn\u2019t only want to\nbe a literary writer. Despite the fact that she would look back nostalgically\nto the poetry rhyme sheets she\u2019d had on her bedroom wall as a child, and the\nfact that she was a hugely literary person, her son-in-law wrote, \u201cShe is on\nrecord as saying in an ideal life she wouldn\u2019t have gone to Oxford to read\nEnglish, but would have become an artist. Much of her writing in World Review\n(and her first book Burne-Jones) was on art.\u201d There were discussions with a\npublisher as late as the 1970s about Penelope writing a book on flower\nsymbolism in Renaissance art.\n\nClaims that she was held back from writing aspirations need to be seen not\nonly in the context of her early life and creative pursuits, but also her\nearly interests, which were not always literary. Through various means and\nimpediments \u2014 her marriage, her lifelong self-education, the development of\nher moral perspective, her teaching \u2014 she arrived at literature; she wasn\u2019t\nentirely diverted from it. As late as 1981, when she had written four novels,\nshe wrote to her editor Richard Ollard that she had been asked to look at\nWilliam Morris\u2019 novel and \u201ca mysterious chestful of Pre-Raphaelite papers\u201d as\nwell as having her (ultimately never published) work on the Poetry Bookshop to\nkeep her busy. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m better employed doing this... than in writing\nnovels,\u201d she muses. A response, no doubt, to the slow sales of Human Voices\nthat year (she was never a very fashionable novelist in the time of Martin\nAmis) and a coy way of sounding out his support for her work, but telling\nnonetheless. She had won the Booker Prize at this point. (Stuart Proffit\npoints out that Penelope was the last person to win the Booker before it was\ntelevised. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have the transformative effect it does now. It was hard\nfor her when it was difficult to sell the books.\u201d She knew the value of her\nwork and she had to keep waiting for success after this.)\n\nHer absorbing interest in the Arts and Crafts movement, part of her broader\nVictorian sympathy and her preference for the Georgian poets over the\nBloomsbury writers (despite her admiration for modernism, especially the\nnovels of Beckett and Joyce), did not just inform her biography of Burne-\nJones; it recurs in The Beginning of Spring. That novel was informed by a\npackage holiday she took to Moscow in 1975, after years of studying Russian,\ninvolving many events \u2014 \u201clectures, films, theatres, exhibitions\u201d \u2014 with the\nGreat Britain-USSR Association. Similarly, in 1979, when Desmond was ill and\nshe felt resentful of him, believing no-one cared about the publication of\nBurne-Jones, she went to Florence on her own, a visit that would re-emerge\nnearly a decade later in her novel Innocence. She also studied Spanish,\nGerman, and Chinese, visited Venice, Germany, Elba, Turkey, Madrid, Greece,\nand other countries. Her letters mention studying Spanish grammar at night.\nShe was studying Russian at a similar period. So esoteric was the influence of\nthis cultural immersion that when she based Human Voices on a poem by Heine\n(indicated by the name Asra and the reference in the novel to Asra being the\nname of a tribe) no critic noticed it, as she predicted. She asked the\nnovelist A.S. Byatt, her old teaching colleague, to write something pointing\nthis out. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed that and I don\u2019t know how she expected anyone to\ndo so,\u201d Byatt recalled.\n\nPenelope\u2019s daughter studied Balzac at A-level and Penelope studied with her,\nSc\u00e8nes de le Vie de Provence. As her son-in-law says, \u201cthe moral atmosphere\u201d\nof The Bookshop \u201cperhaps also some of the form (each chapter a scene)\u201d is\ninfluenced by Balzac. For The Blue Flower as well as reading the letters of\nNovalis in the original eighteenth century German, she read the \u201crecords of\nthe salt mines from cover to cover in German to understand how her hero was\nemployed.\u201d She had Novalis\u2019 letters and private documents out of the London\nLibrary for two years. \u201cMy German\u201d, she said, \u201creally wasn\u2019t up to it though.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a sign of her modesty, but also her respect for scholarship and the\nseriousness with which she approached her novels. It is that depth of learning\nthat gives the last four novels what Wendy Lesser calls \u201ca sense of\nGermanness, Russianness.\u201d Lesser compares Fitzgerald to Vermeer, who shows us\na snapshot that \u201cfeels like an eternity\u201d. It was only with deep learning that\nshe could know what snapshot to show. Lesser also shows that details of\nlanguage, like the use of the definite article before a name in Germany, have\na specific usage at the time period Fitzgerald was writing about, highlighting\nthe immense subtlety of how Fitzgerald achieves her effects. She simply could\nnot have written like this when she was young. She is a novelist of great\nlearning, in all senses, from books, classes, travel, culture, and living.\n\nHer teaching experience was another vital part of her development. She was a\nprecise and attentive reader of literature, and her work at the two colleges\nwhere she taught aspiring Oxbridge students meant she had to re-read the canon\nof English Literature with an inquiring eye and life-wearied imagination. As\none of her pupils recalled, \u201cshe taught literature like a novelist, always the\ntext back to the stuff of experience and getting us to look at how it was\nbeing done.\u201d This constituted an apprenticeship for Fitzgerald, who made\ndetailed annotations in her teaching books. There is tentative evidence that\nshe was not undertaking her intensive self-education out of sheer curiosity.\nOne of her notes on an exam paper with the question \u2018Should there be limits to\ncuriosity?\u201d reads, \u201cScarcely an adult quality in itself \u2014 what is it an\nelement of? Ambitious search for truth etc in biography.\u201d In her restless\npursuit of the truth about literature and history, she was laying the\nfoundations for her fiction. The dialogue between Vladimir and Estragon in\nWaiting for Godot is marked as being between mind and body, which Lee links to\nthe later fiction, especially The Gate of Angels. Of Middlemarch, Fitzgerald\nsays, \u201clow-keyed emotions but minutely traced\u201d and \u201cthe characters\u2019 prospects\nnarrow as the novel closes.\u201d (Penelope used that last note in her Introduction\nto Middlemarch, some twenty years later.) Both of these could be comments on\nFitzgerald\u2019s own technique. She often shows sympathy or keenness for minor\ncharacters, ordinary people, the overlooked \u2014 the ones she would write about.\nShe started off with little enthusiasm for George Eliot and ended by admiring\nher hugely.\n\nFitzgerald\u2019s novels could only have been written later in her life, partly\nbecause of the huge amount of research and learning they required, but also\nbecause they are evocations of a lost England, the Edwardian culture of her\nchildhood. When she was a young woman this England was still slipping away; by\nthe time she started writing, it was gone. Writing to a friend in 1998, when\nshe was in her eighties, she said, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s ridiculous to regret the\nLiberal Party, the Church of England, Lyons tea shops, Carter Paterson,\ntelegrams and so on, but so many of them seemed to disappear at once.\u201d\n\nOne of her first books was The Knox Brothers, a group biography of her uncles,\na group of intellectual Victorians who edited Punch, wrote detective fiction,\nand cracked codes at Bletchley Park. This book was a very conscious and\nobvious study of the lost world of the Liberal Party and the Church of\nEngland, as well as of Punch (\u201can important paper in its day, has been reduced\nto nothing.\u201d) Years after she published it, she said to her editor, \u201cEven\nwhile I was writing it I thought what a closed chapter of history it was, but\nI didn\u2019t mind, because I wanted to leave a record of it before it was too\nlate.\u201d By the end of the year, when The Knox Brothers was being reissued, she\nwrote, \u201cit seems to belong more and more to vanished era.\u201d This was not a\nworld she was always interested in preserving. As a young woman, \u201cI tried to\nget away from them and do my own thing. I didn\u2019t realise until much later,\nindeed until after my father\u2019s death, how much there was to find out about\nthem, and by that time it was almost too late.\u201d When she came back into\nsympathy with her uncles, she did so in a fairly serious way: \u201cin so far as\nthe world disagrees with them, I disagree with the world.\u201d Far from being\ninhibited from pursuing this work earlier in her life, she had to go away and\ncome back before she was able to contemplate it properly: \u201cI count a violent\nreaction against an upbringing,\u201d she said of her uncles, but could have been\ntalking about herself, \u201ca kind of faithfulness.\u201d It was not until the world\nshe had known was fading that she could write about it, or wanted to.\n\nShe regularly evokes this lost world in her fiction. Characters in Human\nVoices, set in the BBC during 1940, discuss going to Lyons tea rooms. In one\nscene, after a night of bombing, Lyons is serving potatoes through one hole in\ntheir windows and taking in money through another. When Annia Asra in that\nnovel falls in love with her boss Sam, Fitzgerald writes, \u201chers must have been\nthe last generation to fall in love without hope in such an unproductive way.\u201d\nSam ends up quitting his job to be with Annie. This isn\u2019t nostalgia exactly,\nbut a form of preservation. As Sam says, \u201cnothing is an experience unless it\u2019s\nshared.\u201d\n\nThe Bookshop is also a bastion of a vanishing world. In 1997, she wrote to her\nAmerican editor, \u201cIt seems like another world... Mrs Neame (name of the\noriginal proprietor, now dead, alas, would have been horrified at the idea of\nonline book-selling).\u201d During a dispute about who is allowed to read the new\nbiography of Queen Mary first, there is gossip that Mrs Thornton \u201cwas known to\nhave voted Liberal in the last election.\u201d That book is set in the 1950s, a\nhopeless time for the Liberal Party. The indifferent workings of the bookshop,\noperating on commercial principles, clashes with the traditional hierarchy of\nthe town\u2019s class system. Fitzgerald was capturing the decline of the culture\nshe had known, not its peak.\n\nIt is tempting to see Fitzgerald herself in these two early novels. Annie Asra\nsays of music, \u201cless is more, sometimes.\u201d This was Fitzgerald\u2019s view of\nfiction. The year she was writing Human Voices she said in a letter, \u201cI deeply\nbelieve that \u2018less is more\u2019. I like Daisy Miller better than Wings of a Dove\nand even Master and Man better than War and Peace.\u201d Like Penelope, Annie finds\nthe BBC controlling. Annie falls in love with Sam, a hopeless middle-aged man,\nnot a parallel with Penelope who married Desmond in 1942 when he was a dashing\nyoung Guards officer. But she is the first in a series of women characters who\nfall in love with men with significant failings. Fitzgerald writes these men\nto be understood, not judged. \u201cYou\u2019ve no idea about others, and you don\u2019t\nnotice what makes them suffer,\u201d Annie tells Sam, in a line that wouldn\u2019t be\nout of place in Offshore, a novel much more closely modelled on the\nFitzgerald\u2019s marriage. Annie and Sam leave the BBC together and meet a utopian\ncrank called Willie, who tells them, \u201ca good society transforms its members.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a good deal of Penelope\u2019s Church of England Liberalism in that\nsentiment. Like Penelope, Annie is a young woman of the arts, somewhat adrift\nin wartime London, who finds an unlikely husband; as with so many of her\ncharacters, we feel slightly weary of their happiness at the end, not least\nbecause of the omen of Sam\u2019s colleague Jeff leaving the BBC building to go and\nmeet them only to be killed when he mistakes a taxi for an unexploded bomb.\n\nSimilarly, Penelope haunts The Bookshop, rather like the poltergeist that\nlurks in that novel. In the opening, when deciding what to do with an\ninheritance from her husband, Florence \u201chad recently come to wonder whether\nshe hadn\u2019t a duty to make it clear to herself, and possibly to others, that\nshe existed in her own right.\u201d This isn\u2019t literally Penelope \u2014 but she too was\na recent widow and had reason to understand and write about such people. Here\nagain she evokes a lost England, and something of a lost self: M\u00fcllers, a\nbookshop on Wigmore Street, closes after many years, which Florence takes \u201cas\na personal attack on her memories.\u201d Penelope, too, had worked in a bookshop.\nAnd Florence has changed her life mid-way on the wave, just as Penelope was\ndoing. \u201cIt is a peculiar thing to take a step forward in middle age, but\nhaving done it I don\u2019t intend to retreat.\u201d Indeed, the whole novel is about\nbeing a late bloomer, about \u201cthat precious sense of beginning again which she\ncould not expect too often at her age.\u201d\n\nThey would have been different, less accomplished novels, if she had written\nthem young. Both have aphorisms wrought from experience. In The Bookshop we\nare told, \u201cCourage and wisdom are useless if they are never tested.\u201d And, \u201cThe\nuselessness of feeling ashamed.\u201d In Human Voices Annie\u2019s father\u2019s friends say,\n\u201cWe\u2019re never sent more than we can bear.\u201d And, \u201cYou begin life helpless and\nyou end life helpless.\u201d It took a novelist who had lived through what\nFitzgerald had lived through to write these books. Even when her books weren\u2019t\nbased on her own life, they were recreating this lost time, whether in England\nor other places. \u201cAll my books are before the 1960s as this was the last time\nanyone was stopped from doing anything for moral considerations.\u201d\n\nThere is more to this than aphorisms. The whole philosophy of Fitzgerald\u2019s\nwriting, as well as her plots, comes out of her experiences. It tells in the\nminor characters, the asides. Mrs Simmonds is \u201cgenerous enough to learn\nnothing from experience.\u201d Sam says of Annie, \u201cShe isn\u2019t carried out of\nherself... by the sheer injustice of life\u2019s coincidence.\u201d This philosophy of\nhaving to ignore the reality of life if you are to get through it is described\ndirectly in The Bookshop:\n\n> She blinded herself, in short, by pretending for a while that human beings\n> are not divided into exterminators and exterminatees, with the former, at\n> any given moment, predominating. Will-power is useless without a sense of\n> direction. Hers was at such a low ebb that it no longer gave her the\n> instructions for survival. It revived, however, without any effort on her\n> part, and within the space of ten minutes on a Tuesday morning at the end of\n> March.\n\nHow much is contained in this paragraph. The distinction between\n\u201cexterminators and exterminatees\u201d is often quoted by critics; the rest of the\nparagraph is just as important. \u201cWill-power is useless without a sense of\ndirection\u201d might easily describe Penelope\u2019s dilemma about writing earlier in\nher life: what did she have to write about, what was her purpose in writing?\nAs she aged, and needed the money, and wanted to have something to fill her\ntime, and was free of some of her domestic responsibility, writing began. She\nwrote to Hugh Lee the year she wrote The Bookshop, \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure why I\nhave taken to writing either, but it\u2019s better than weaving, hand-printing &c\nin that it represents a slight profit rather than a large loss for the\namateur; also it struck me that I was getting to the end of my life and would\nlike to write one or 2 biographies of people I loved and novels about people I\ndidn\u2019t like, put it that way.\u201d\n\nPenelope started researching her first biography in her early fifties. Just as\nher first novel would be written when her husband was dying, this book was\nwritten after her father died. Psychological speculation would be easy but\nuseless, possibly misleading. Maybe she wanted to finally live up to her\nfamily\u2019s expectations; maybe she needed to be free of them; maybe she had\ndemons to exorcise; maybe she finally had the emotional space away from\neveryone\u2019s expectations; maybe, maybe, maybe. This is all very vague and not\nvery Penelope. All sorts of triggers motivate people to change their lives for\nall sorts of reasons. Sometimes, the simple fact of change inspires further\nchange.\n\nThe most likely effect of her father\u2019s death was that she realised just how\nmuch of the old world that she had come to affectionately admire was slipping\naway. She wrote to her daughter about her father on his deathbed:\n\n> He complained gently as people do when they\u2019re dying that the room was\n> getting dark. We said that the lights were on. My father said \u201cof course\n> they are. How absurd one is. [Very Edwardian. We\u2019ve lost the secret.] But\n> there\u2019s an awkward thing about dying \u2013 one gets so little practice.\u201d I\n> treasure that \u201chow absurd one is\u201d and hope I won\u2019t forget it when the time\n> comes.\n\nThat is the culture she captures so well in her books, those snapshots of\neternity.\n\n####\n\nDrawn to the solitary, gazing lamp.\n\nThe idea that Fitzgerald was prevented from writing earlier than she did gets\nexpressed in many ways. It is a pervasive and persuasive idea. In her preface\nto the novels, Hermione Lee quotes Fitzgerald saying, after she won the Booker\nPrize, \u201cI knew I was an outsider.\u201d This gives the impression of someone who\nhas finally made it, someone with a long-held sense of their potential,\nsomeone held back by the world. That\u2019s probably true of Fitzgerald. And as Lee\npoints out, many of her characters are outsiders. But what Fitzgerald actually\nsaid, in a letter to her friend Francis King, was \u201cI know I was an outsider.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a small difference, the shift from knew to know, but it changes the\nmeaning quite significantly. In the letter where she says this, Fitzgerald\nwasn\u2019t talking about anything long-term, any sense of herself she had nurtured\nover the years. She was acknowledging that she was a surprise choice for the\nprize and that she won because the judges were split. Her intuition was\ncorrect. Frank Kermode had written before the prize that Fitzgerald was \u201con\nthe list to be eliminated\u201d. Hilary Spurling, one of the judges, later wrote\nabout how Fitzgerald was \u201ceveryone\u2019s second choice\u201d and won because of a\njudges\u2019 dispute. \u201cI know I was an outsider,\u201d she said, meaning she knew how\nthe prize committee worked. It was no sort of bigger commentary on her career.\n\nThe idea of Fitzgerald as a perpetual outsider is compelling. But she didn\u2019t\nstart as an outsider. Quite the contrary. Her father edited Punch. Her uncles\nand aunt were renowned cryptographers, writers, and priests. Both grandfathers\nwere bishops (Manchester and Lincoln). Indeed, she was born in a Bishop\u2019s\nPalace. After her girls boarding school, she went to the same Oxford college\nas her mother. There was something suffocating about this brilliant childhood,\nperhaps especially because her mother died when she was a teenager. It is easy\nto see the influence of Desmond on her later life, but it is sensible to ask,\nas James Wood did, whether \u201csome Knoxian combination of insecurity and\nconfidence held her back until she could be sure of avoiding public failure?\u201d\nIf so, it makes sense that she would dwell on the fact that she won the Booker\nPrize as an outsider, because in her words the judges \u201cruled out novels\nevidently written with one eye on film rights.\u201d\n\nThis insecurity is evident after she was nominated for the Booker Prize in\n1978. She asked her publisher Colin Haycraft if he was interested in taking\nmore of her novels after The Bookshop and he seems to have said no, and in a\nrather dismissive manner. She wrote to him, entirely in good faith, saying she\nwas taking his advice to get another publisher. She thanked him for giving her\na start by publishing her novels, \u201cI\u2019m sure you were right in saying no-one\nelse would have taken them.\u201d Haycraft was upset by this, thinking her cunning\nand careerist. In fact she was taking advice from Francis King, who was\nappalled at her poor treatment from Haycraft. Haycraft wrote to her denying he\nhad told her to go elsewhere or that he had said he disliked her work. He was\nupset at her sudden departure. Haycraft was mean and gossipy, but Fitzgerald\nlacked confidence and was apt, as she wrote to him, to take remarks too\nseriously. As Hensher says, \u201cit was definitely a strange moment for the\nnovelist to be convinced of her lack of success in the world.\u201d\n\nIt would be easy to read more steel into Fitzgerald than she displayed here.\nShe was firmly rejecting Haycraft\u2019s muddled and overbearing treatment,\nrefusing to be treated like a little old lady \u2014 but she was also bad at\nbusiness, perhaps the result of her combination of firm independence and mild\ninsecurity. She was an unworldly artist, uncomfortable with practicalities and\nnecessities. One of her students remembered the way she talked about authors\u2019\nlives, especially the poet Yeats coming downstairs from his tower and saying,\nabout his own children, \u201cwho are they?\u201d She wasn\u2019t quite that bad; but she was\nthat sort of person. She was hugely earnest and absorbed in what mattered to\nher. Stuart Proffit remembered that she didn\u2019t make small talk in any\nconventional way. \u201cShe wanted to know what you were doing and reading and she\ntalked about her grandchildren in little asides.\u201d He noted that she wasn't\nsomeone you could get to know easily\u2014\u201dshe wasn\u2019t a quick study\u201d\u2014but the people\nwho did work with her became hugely devoted to her. She had an artist\u2019s\ninterest in, and detachment from, the world.\n\nFirst, Fitzgerald wrote biographies, reliant on research. Then she moved into\nnovels. \u201cBiographies and novels are the forms I can just about manage.\u201d She\ntold an interviewer that biography was easier than fiction, because of the\nresearch, whereas with fiction \u201cyou\u2019re out on your own.\u201d She moved to fiction\nbecause biography was hard, competitive work and she preferred being able to\nwrite dialogue. And in those early novels, she wrote from life. In Human\nVoices, \u201cI never went away from the truth.\u201d In At Freddies \u201call the characters\nare taken straight from life.\u201d The facts were transmogrified sometimes \u2014 she\nhad to help two people having epiletic fits when she worked at the BBC; in the\nnovel, this became a woman giving birth. But often, the novels hew closely to\nreality. The poltergeist in The Bookshop was entirely real to her experience.\nSo she was not quite out on her own: she was always a historical novelist,\nbuilding and working from the materials of history, first her own, later other\npeople\u2019s.\n\nThis technique was slowly refined. As A.S. Byatt said, \u201cHer genius became\napparent when she began to write fiction about the facts of other times and\nplaces.\u201d Even in those last four novels, we see personal experience seeping\nthrough. Innocence has a character described as a dwarf. During a holiday to\nElba, some twenty years before she wrote Innocence, Penelope took her first\ntrip to Florence. In a letter about that holiday she described a member of the\nhotel staff as \u201ca dwarf, only 3 ft high.\u201d The Gate of Angels is about a young\nman in Cambridge at the start of the twentieth century who meets his future\nwife when he has a bicycling accident. This was surely inspired by a puncture\nher uncle Ronald Knox once had at Cambridge in 1908, which he had to repair at\na country Vicarage. No addresses were exchanged with the vicar\u2019s daughters.\nDespite this, and despite the fact they were not \u201cextremely beautiful\u201d and\nthat once one of them was engaged, \u201cwho shall say it was not a romance,\u201d wrote\nthe young Ronald, \u201cbecause the threads were broken?\u201d The threads were broken\nin The Gate of Angels too \u2014 but inspired by the way fiction can go beyond\nhistory, how it can let you see a life again in different terms, Penelope\nweaved those threads back together, albeit with an ambivalent sense of the\nfuture.\n\nIn \u201cWhy I Write\u201d Fitzgerald gave three reasons for writing fiction. She felt\ncompelled to tell stories, like all writers. \u201cI get great satisfaction out of\nmaking people believe that this even happened at that time.\u201d She wanted to\nmake money. And, perhaps most importantly,\n\n> I am drawn to people who seem to have been born defeated or, even,\n> profoundly lost. They are ready to assume the conditions the world imposes\n> on them, but they don\u2019t manage to submit to them, despite their courage and\n> their best efforts. They are not envious, simply compassless. When I write\n> it is to give these people a voice.\n\nAs much as she was a historical novelist, working from her carefully\ncultivated knowledge of European history and culture, she was repeatedly re-\nwriting her and her family\u2019s lives. She had to live the life she lived before\nshe could become the writer she became. Not everyone in her position, whether\nthey are writers, mathematicians, musicians, or talented people who never\nfound their direction, are so lucky. Fitzgerald had to be defeated and\nprofoundly lost in her life before she could write; she had to experience the\nreality of her subjects to be able to make them vivid in historical fiction.\n\nAll those years when she, presumably, was hoping for relief from the\ndifficulties of her life, she was in fact storing up material for her novels.\nIt was by reimagining her whole life \u201cAll prayers are answers,\u201d Fitzgerald\nwrote in the manuscript of The Gate of Angels, a line she later deleted, \u201cYou\njust have to make the best you can of the answer.\u201d\n\nWhen her father Evoe died, and Penelope became painfully aware of the loss of\nEdwardian England, one very specific trigger for her start as a writer came\nfrom a newspaper article she read in November 1974 about the academic and\nghost story writer M.R. James, written by the biographer Richard Holmes.\nPenelope told Holmes twenty-three years later that she started to write \u201cas a\nresult of reading your piece about Monty James in the Times, so many years\nago. I\u2019ve still got it, although it\u2019s almost falling to pieces.\u201d\n\nThe article is a long biographical appreciation of James, written in an\nevocative tone that summons up warmly the whole world of Edwardian Cambridge\nthat Penelope grew up in and would write about in The Knox Brothers and then\nagain in The Gate of Angels. Holmes ends his piece by quoting a passage from\none of M.R. James\u2019 stories and then saying that psychologists, sociologists,\nand historians will have their own \u2018comforting dictums\u2019 and will want to\n\u2018study\u2019 and \u2018trace\u2019 various trends and evolutions in response to James\u2019 work.\nNot so the literary Holmes.\n\n> For myself, I shall call to mind only the view from the College Library, as\n> the dark finally settles into the courts, and very faintly the sounds of\n> evensong drifts on the chill airs in the sweet harmonious voices of the\n> King\u2019s choristers, and here and there a scholar twitches his curtains, seals\n> his door, and draws up his chair to the pool of light beneath his solitary,\n> gazing lamp.\n\nPenelope was settled into the second half of her life when she read that, with\na dead father and grown-up children. She didn\u2019t seal her door or twitch her\ncurtains, but she was increasingly drawn to the gazing lamp, ready to\ndissaccumulate her experiences and to start gathering more purposefully the\nresearch for biographies and novels so that she too could write like Richard\nHolmes. Whatever the reason, this article, with its gorgeous, accurate prose,\nwas part of what started her actually writing. Her books would start being\npublished the following year. M.R. James himself would appear in The Gate of\nAngels, some sixteen years later. Holmes\u2019 inspiration ran deep with Penelope,\nbut it came at the right time.\n\nThe way she kept studying literature throughout her life, and the way her\nmoral perspective changed, were the basis of writing literature for Penelope.\nAs she said, \u201cThe truth is, though I would never dare saying it in public,\nthat the value of studying literature only really appears as you go on\nliving.\u201d\n\n### Subscribe to The Common Reader\n\nBy Henry Oliver \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nEssays for interesting people about talent, literature, and biography. \"One of\nmy favourite Substacks.\" Helen Lewis\n\n47\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How Penelope Fitzgerald became a late blooming novelist.\n\nwww.commonreader.co.uk\n\n11\n\nShare\n\n11 Comments\n\nTashVirginia Woolf Reading GroupApr 4Liked by Henry OliverA really well-\nwritten, well-researched essay.
