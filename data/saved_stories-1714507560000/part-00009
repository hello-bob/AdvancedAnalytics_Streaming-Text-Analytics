When making decisions or considering options, the\nrubric I use is the idea of extremes for scoring a given decision against\nothers.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, take a situation where you need to make a\ndecision. I will use the example of a founder of a social media platform, who\nhas to decide about the level of free speech.\n\nWhat a normal founder is likely trying to achieve is (even if they don\u2019t\nrealise it) - a middleground. Why? Extremes.\n\nIf users joined their platform and contributed absolutely zero, nothing -\nwell, the platform has no reason to exist. Conversely, If users who joined\nonly wrote incomprehensible nonsense, for example every message was something\nlike \u201cgsgshsj\u201d repeated, this also renders their platform pretty unhelpful for\nall, and the platform may need to reconsider its existence.\n\nSo we have two extreme points - zero, and garbage. What is acceptable between\nthose two? That can be difficult to decide, but at least it is clear that a)\nusers must be able to contribute something and b) if what they contribute is\nincromprehensible, it is actually detrimental to the platform.\n\nThis post is not a discussion of what that \u201cacceptable\u201d is in the above case,\nbut hopefully it does help illustrate that a lot of decisions at the very\nleast have two poles within which one can work within. This is often\nespecially helpful when making decisions with other people, where this rubrick\ncan help lay out the opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nLiving in a city like Singapore starts to help redefine extremes. Let\u2019s take\nthe recent legalisation of cannabis in various nations. The extreme of banning\nit is that, in theory, nobody uses cannabis. The extreme on the other side is\nthat every single citizen does indeed use it. Reality of course suggests that\neven if it is banned, there will be people that enjoy/want/need a use for a\nsubstance and find a way to make that happen. On the other side, it is very\nunlikely every citizen will indeed use it. However of the two extremes, which\nis most likely to maintain a productive nation where productivity is arguably\nplaced above all else? If it is hard to police / regulate / agree on a middle\nground, perhaps an extreme based on the ultimate goal of a nation, is the\nanswer until further notice.\n\nLet\u2019s take a more innocuous example. You are travelling on holiday to a cold\nclimate, do you need to buy new clothes? Well, if you only own t-shirts and\nshorts, and you buy nothing additional, the extreme case is that you will\nlikely have a very unpleasant time. On the other side, you could purchase some\nkind of hyper-insulating suit probably designed for space, at vast expense. So\none of the extremes dictates \u201cI do actually need to buy some new clothes, or I\nwill get hypothermia\u201d and on the other side, \u201cthere is clearly a limit\nsomewhere as to the amount of insulation I require and money I should spend on\nthis\u201d.\n\nIn the above example, those that refuse to spend money on new clothes, might\nhave considered extremes before booking that holiday to the north pole.\n\nA final example in the realms of business - hiring. This one is perhaps the\nmost interesting as virtually everyone needs to be hired (whether by a\ncompany, or merely deliver a product to a customer) or in fact hire someone\nfor their own or their employer\u2019s business.\n\nLet\u2019s try with extremes for a solo small business owner of a flower shop. The\nshop is successful and pays for a very ok life for me (the owner) and my\nfamily. Should I hire an employee?\n\nOn the one hand, the extreme of not hiring anyone is that the limits (e.g.\nfinancial) of the business are the time that I (the owner) is willing to put\ninto the business. The business will end when I can no longer - or are willing\nto continue - this business. The business must also be closed on a given day\nif I am sick, or need some rest. On the other extreme, if I hire thirty people\ntomorrow, their salaries will make us bankrupt in a matter of days based on\nthe money in the bank and the very high unlikelihood they can bring in 30x\nrevenue in the ensuing days (this is not even accounting for the time and\neffort needed to hire these people, taking time away from running a successful\nflower shop).\n\nSo there is something in the middle. I consider the middle if any of the\noutcomes of the \u2018hire nobody\u2019 extreme are not acceptable to me. Equally, if\nthose scenarios are acceptable, do I need to hire anyone? On that basis, the\ndecision to hire is just a function of money wanting to be made and the\ndesired flexibility of my time. There is actually no extreme on the side of\n\u2018not hiring\u2019 in the sense it may totally work for your business, unlike some\nother extremes that are game over. There is absolutely an existential extreme\non the other side (ie hiring 30 people tomorrow) that will put you out of\nbusiness.\n\nAsking yourself \u201cwhere is the limit\u201d can help define these extremes. In the\nabove example, hiring one million employees tomorrow is clearly not feasible,\nso using that as the extreme is not very helpful. Hiring one employee probably\nis feasible but, could it also be two, or even three?\n\nSo, there is a limit, somewhere. That limit can help you define the extremes\non either side (the \u2018limit\u2019 on the other side is one employee, on the basis a\nbusiness is very unlikely to function with zero people).\n\nDoes AI now change the definitions of the extremes outlined above? Perhaps.\nBut that is a topic for another day.\n\nThe next time that you need to make a decision, try and figure out the two\nextremes first. It may help you arrive at your answer faster than you\nexpected. When neither extreme is acceptable, because both extremes can pose\nan existential threat to the situation, it can greatly help with decision-\nmaking. Especially when making decisions with others who may have a different\npoint of view, extremes can help you both/all find a faster acceptable\nsolution in the wide middle ground.\n\nit is 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
