As citizens, we don\u2019t have nearly enough access\nto our own photographic histories that we collectively own in the public\ndomain. In light of that, we\u2019re thrilled to announce the founding of our very\nown nonprofit, the Flickr Foundation.\n\nHow did we get here? It starts in 2018 when, after years of attempts, we\n(SmugMug) were fortunate enough to be able to buy Flickr from Yahoo!. We\ndidn\u2019t buy Flickr because we thought it was an amazing business opportunity\u2014it\nwas losing staggering amounts of money, and nobody else seemed interested in\nthe potential. Instead, we bought Flickr because we\u2019ve built our company\naround a love for photography, and we couldn\u2019t imagine an internet without the\namazing community and the staggering collection of photography that Flickr\nsupported.\n\nWe knew Flickr meant a lot of things to a lot of communities, but it rapidly\nbecame clear just how important it was once the acquisition announcements went\nout. Within hours and days, we were fielding requests from organizations and\nindividuals around the globe wondering what it meant for their work and their\ncommunities. The CEO of Creative Commons flew out to our offices immediately\nto discuss the future of the hundreds of millions of open licensed works being\nshared on Flickr. It was an easy decision to not only protect those photos,\nbut to work on growing the collection collaboratively.\n\nGovernment agencies around the globe reached out to express how important\ntheir Flickr community is to connecting to the people they support. Schools,\nclubs, and community organizations also shared with us how critical Flickr has\nbecome to what they do and how they share.\n\nOne of those first contacts we received really spoke to the importance and\ntruly unique position Flickr occupied online. The team at the Library of\nCongress reached out to ask about the future of the Flickr Commons. This huge\ncollection of public domain, cultural heritage works had been tirelessly\ndigitized, curated, and uploaded to share with the entire world by over a\nhundred organizations. Those organizations included larger institutions like\nthe Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institution, British Library and so many\nmore. But it also contained much smaller organizations, opening collections to\nthe public from all over the world.\n\nWe already knew we would preserve these collections, but we wanted to do more\nthan just focus on preservation. Millions of photos from hundreds of\ninstitutions is a huge collection, but it barely scratches the surface of\npublic domain historic photography that still isn\u2019t easily accessible to the\ngeneral public. We were determined, but directionless. I couldn\u2019t stop\nthinking about the opportunity to do something meaningful, but I really didn\u2019t\nknow where to start or how to prioritize what mattered.\n\nOne night, while very unproductively thinking through the challenges, I sent a\ncold email to George Oates. More than a decade before, George had started this\nwhole Flickr Commons project and laid the foundation I was now hoping to build\nupon. I simply reached out, and told her that I loved the Flickr Commons and I\nwanted to do more with that community. She answered my email, we met, and we\nfairly quickly went to work together to think through what the future of this\npreservation could look like. The scope of the project has dramatically\nexpanded as our vision and mission became more clear, but it still all comes\nback to one simple idea.\n\nThe Flickr Foundation is working to expand access to photographic history, and\nto preserve those photographs for generations to come. We\u2019re also aware that\nour communities are documenting those histories right now. Flickr is full of\nevents, both significant and small, that document our humanity. In order to\ntruly preserve and share our photographic history, we must also build out a\nplan and a foundation for the living history on all our digital platforms.\n\nWe\u2019re doing this so that in 100 years, we aren\u2019t just sharing millions of\ncultural heritage photographs. With the work of the Flickr Foundation, we\u2019re\ncreating a visual commons\u2014a collective reference of our history and our\nhumanity, accessible by anyone, anywhere.\n\n##### The 501(c)(3) Flickr Foundation exists to keep Flickr pictures visible\nfor 100 years, preserving our shared visual commons for future generations.\n\nContact\n\n    hello@flickr.org\n    Follow @flickrfdn\n\nThe content on flickr.org is shared under a CC-BY 4.0 license.
