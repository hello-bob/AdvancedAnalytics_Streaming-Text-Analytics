Acknowledging these\nconcerns, Kenya\u2019s technology cabinet secretary on April 16 told the committee\nhearing the petition that the government preferred to enhance the regulation\nof TikTok, as opposed to a full-on ban.\n\nAD\n\nTikTok\u2019s head of public policy for sub-Saharan Africa, Fortune Mgwili-Sibanda,\nhad earlier urged the committee to dismiss the petition, highlighting TikTok\u2019s\ninvestment in a mix of human and AI-led content moderation and its efforts to\nwork with policy makers and regulators. He said TikTok took down more than\n296,000 inappropriate videos from Kenya in 2023. Mgwili-Sibanda appeared\nalongside a representative of Majorel, TikTok\u2019s content moderation partner in\nKenya.\n\nMgwili-Sibanda emphasized TikTok\u2019s role in the creative economy by \u201csurfacing\nlocal Kenyan talent and exporting it to global audiences.\u201d He also said a ban\nwould be \u201ctantamount to silencing citizens and denying them of their\nConstitutional rights.\u201d\n\nMPs\u2019 concerns included fears that the AI moderation tools used by TikTok may\nnot be able to decipher local languages and contexts, allowing dangerous or\nharmful videos to find their way into timelines.\n\nAD\n\nIn this article:\n\n### The News\n\n### Know More\n\n### Martin\u2019s view\n\n### The View From the African Union\n\n### Know More\n\nKenya\u2019s ministry of information, communications and technology also told the\ncommittee that TikTok had, in talks last year, agreed to share quarterly\ncompliance reports with the government. The ministry argued for enhanced\nregulation as opposed to a ban.\n\n\u201cTo facilitate easy community reporting, TikTok is required to share quarterly\ncompliance reports with the ministry, clearly showing content removed and\nreasons for the same,\u201d said the ministry\u2019s principal secretary, John Tanui.\n\n### Martin\u2019s view\n\nA ban is unlikely due to TikTok\u2019s popularity, particularly among young people\nand small businesses, Nairobi-based media consultant Brian Ndegwa told Semafor\nAfrica. Several TikTok content creators in Kenya have come out to oppose the\nproposed ban, as have some lawmakers who cited its heavy use by influencers\nand businesses.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt would also go against Kenya\u2019s positioning as a tech and innovation leader\non the continent,\u201d Ndegwa said. \u201cBut their moderation just isn\u2019t good enough\nyet for content in Kenya and most of Africa,\u201d he added.\n\nThe use of AI alongside human content moderators, in particular, highlights\nthe need to train large language models (LLMs) on more African languages,\ntexts and multimedia content. In Kenya, for example, at least 47 languages are\nspoken by different ethnic communities in addition to the official languages\nof English and Swahili.\n\n\u201cWhat you [TikTok] are doing is simply not enough. Your AI and moderating\nformula is not built to work effectively in Kenya,\u201d said Mbeere South member\nof parliament Nabert Muriuki at the hearings. \u201cHow is your system going to\nfilter content that is spoken in different dialects such as Ki-Meru?\u201d\n\nStricter regulation of TikTok is, however, a far more likely possibility.\n\nNdegwa said he expected more African governments to take a closer look at\nTikTok, citing recent disruptions, proposed bans on TikTok in Somalia,\nSenegal, Egypt and Uganda. He warned that such bans could \u201copen the door\u201d to\ncensorship.\n\n### The View From the African Union\n\nTikTok and the African Union in March announced a new online safety education\npartnership.\n\nThe campaign aims to \u201craise awareness of online safety among youth as well as\nparents, teachers and guardians in Africa.\u201d The campaign, launched amid\nheightened scrutiny of the platform by African governments, was rolled out on\nTikTok across the continent.\n\nAD\n\n", "frontpage": false}
