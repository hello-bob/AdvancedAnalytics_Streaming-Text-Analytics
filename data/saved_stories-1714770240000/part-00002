This Japanese Gacha machine is just\nfor you\n\nNews\n\nBy Andy Edser\n\npublished 26 April 2024\n\nMakes a change from a bit of plastic tat, doesn't it?\n\n(Image credit: Sawara-San / cluster140)\n\nI've sometimes toyed with the idea of building a wall display of dead\nhardware, so I can live out my fantasies of a house covered in futuristic\ngreebles. This Japanese Gacha machine might be the cheapest way of getting\nhold of a large number of borked chips for my project, as it dispenses them\nfor a mere $3.25 a go.\n\nLocated outside of a Japanese electronics store, this Gacha machine is the\nsort that usually dispenses a small toy in a plastic bubble (via Techspot).\nHowever, YouTuber Sawara-san has discovered that for a mere 500 Yen\u2014equivalent\nto around $3.25\u2014this one instead provides you with a CPU. In this case, the\nprize was an Intel Core i7-8700, although some later testing revealed that the\nchip, presumably like all the others in the machine, had some serious issues.\n\nA Windows Task Manager screenshot reveals the beleaguered CPU only reported\nfive working cores and 10 threads, whereas a fully functioning Core i7 8700\nshould have six cores and 12.\n\nStill, for $3.25 you really can't complain, especially as you can still buy\nthis particular model (fully functional, of course) for $200. Given that this\nvending machine appears to be located in a district full of electronics\nretailers, I would imagine that this is simply a way of making a bit of extra\ncash from damaged hardware by selling broken chips off as curiosities.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM pcgamer\n\nGiven that e-waste is an ongoing issue, the idea of giving broken hardware a\nsecond life as an aesthetically pleasing, slightly desirable object is a\npleasant one, if not perhaps a sustainable solution.\n\nYour next machine\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nBest gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.

Holding a chip in my hands and\nmarvelling at the capabilities inside, never mind all the effort required to\nproduce it is something I find immensely satisfying when constructing a PC\nbuild, and I think if I passed this machine on the street I'd end up buying\nquite a few for myself.\n\n## Comic deals, prizes and latest news\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nAndy Edser\n\nHardware Writer\n\nAndy built his first gaming PC at the tender age of 12, when IDE cables were a\nthing and high resolution wasn't. After spending over 15 years in the\nproduction industry overseeing a variety of live and recorded projects, he\nstarted writing his own PC hardware blog for a year in the hope that people\nmight send him things.
