However, the numbers tell a different tale.\n\n5\n\nRemote work offers affordability, but at the cost of your career path.\nGoffkein \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nFrom mid-2022 to mid-2023, major metropolitan areas continued hemorrhaging\nresidents. New York alone saw a loss of 238,000 people \u2014 while Los Angeles,\nSan Francisco and Seattle bled tens of thousands each, according to the Census\nBureau.\n\nThe exodus persists, albeit less severely than the initial pandemic-induced\nflight.\n\n## Explore More\n\n### How NYC's reclusive retail kingpin sold billions in buildings to Gucci,\nPrada in mere days\n\n### Developers want to convert unused offices into housing \u2014 here's what's\nstopping them\n\n### World's No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler purchased a modest $2.1M newlywed\nhome\n\n5\n\nWas escaping a big city in 2020 worth it? For many, yes \u2014 but not for all.\nProstock-studio \u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nUrban flight\u2019s impact extends beyond empty streets and shuttered shops.\n\nA new study co-authored by Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley, highlights its repercussions on fleeing professionals.\nMoretti\u2019s research reveals that leaving major cities can cripple career\nprospects.\n\n5\n\nNew York saw 238,000 people flee the city between 2022 and 2023. Getty Images\n\nWorkers in smaller markets face challenges in finding suitable employment,\noften resorting to geographical relocation or settling for mismatched roles.\n\nThe study underscores the significance of market size in job opportunities.\n\nEconomists emphasize the concept of agglomeration, where industries and\nprofessionals cluster in specific cities, amplifying career prospects.\n\n5\n\nWorkers in smaller markets face challenges in finding suitable employment.\nGetty Images\n\nMoretti\u2019s findings challenge the notion that remote work heralded an era of\ngeographic flexibility in living and working, stressing the enduring\nimportance of urban hubs in career advancement.\n\n\u201cThe big takeaway is that market size matters,\u201d Moretti told Insider. \u201cIt\u2019s\nclear that larger markets improve the quality of the match.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic-induced migration might have lured many with promises of lower\ncosts and spacious homes, but it came at a cost. Living in industry hubs\nfosters professional networks and serendipitous knowledge exchanges, fueling\ninnovation and productivity.\n\n5\n\nResearch reveals that leaving major cities can cripple career prospects. Getty\nImages\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nThe allure of smaller cities pales in comparison to the career insurance and\nnetworking advantages offered by major urban centers.\n\nWhile some may prioritize lifestyle over career, Moretti predicts a resurgence\nof urban migration as job seekers flood back to major cities, reviving their\nstatus as bustling hubs of opportunity.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * career advice\n  * careers\n  * employment\n  * office\n  * remote learning\n  * work\n  * workers\n  * 4/15/24\n\nRead Next This sprawling ranch just became the most expensive home t...\n\n#### What to Shop Now\n\n  * ### Apple AirPods are STILL at their lowest price of the year right now on Amazon\n\n  * ### The 82 best gifts to buy for the lush woman in your life in 2024\n\n  * ### These are the 11 best bronzing drops we tested for glowy, sun-kissed skin every time\n\n  * ### Shop these 45 Amazon Mother's Day gifts \u2014 all under $100 \u2014 as the holiday is only a month away\n\n  * ### Finally, the 43 best gifts to give your wife this Mother's Day, listed for you\n\n#### Trending Now in Real Estate\n\n  * This story has been shared 10,925 times. 10,925\n\n### How NYC's reclusive retail kingpin sold billions in buildings to Gucci,\nPrada in mere days\n\n  * This story has been shared 2,912 times. 2,912\n\n### Developers want to convert unused offices into housing \u2014 here's what's\nstopping them\n\n  * This story has been shared 1,605 times. 1,605\n\n### World's No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler purchased a modest $2.1M newlywed\nhome\n\n## Now on Page Six\n\n  * ### Bill Gates\u2019 ex-wife, Melinda, sparks engagement rumors with massive diamond ring\n\n  * ### Rumors swirl that Jeff Bezos bought Howard Stern\u2019s Palm Beach mansion for $300M \u2014 here\u2019s the truth\n\n  * ### Taylor Swift reacts to \u2018TTPD\u2019 reviews after critic goes anonymous over \u2018safety\u2019 concerns\n\nSee All\n\n#### Video\n\n  * ### New York Post launches video series 'Listen Up!
