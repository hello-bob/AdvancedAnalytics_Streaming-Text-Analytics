Not being a technical person, I had no ability to assess the hype on the\nmerits, but companies were putting real money into it, and so I wrote pieces\nlooking at the labor market, land use, and transportation policy implications.\nBut the tech turned out to be way overhyped, progress was much slower than\nadvertised, and then Elon Musk further poisoned the water by marketing some\nlimited (albeit impressive) self-driving software as \u201cFull Self-Driving.\u201d\n\nThat whole experience seems to have left most people with the sense that self-\ndriving cars are 10 years away and always will be.\n\nI am still not a technical person, but at this point I am prepared to make a\ntechnical judgment: The current conventional wisdom is wrong and autonomous\nvehicle technology has become underhyped. The key mistake I\u2019ve noticed people\nmaking is they don\u2019t seem to realize that autonomous taxis are no longer a\nhypothetical future technology. They exist, and you can ride in them. Waymo\nhas been operating in San Francisco and Phoenix for a while now and is\nexpanding soon to Austin and to a sort of awkward-to-describe-accurately\nswathe of Los Angeles County.\n\nThe technology that exists is not without its limits. Waymo\u2019s Driver software\nrelies on detailed local mapping to work, which is not how humans drive cars.\nAs a result, you can\u2019t expand Waymo into an arbitrary geography without a\nsignificant capital outlay upfront. That\u2019s a real business model challenge for\nthe company, because this is obviously also a highly regulated space. In\npurely business terms, what you would want to do is start with the most\nlucrative geographies to start generating cash flow and only expand out from\nthere. But in practice, Waymo needs to balance where it makes business sense\nto operate and where they can get permission. What\u2019s more, they seem to only\nbe targeting warm cities, as if they have a known problem with dealing with\nsnow or ice.\n\nSo it\u2019s not a solved problem; we\u2019re still talking about a world of hype and\npotential more than a reality. But the reality is that if you have a business\nmeeting in Downtown Phoenix, you can take a driverless taxi to the airport\nwhen you wrap up. Not in the future. Not hypothetically. But right now. We\u2019re\nlooking primarily at questions of business models and economics, not\ntechnology. Driverless cars are on the road as we speak, and more are coming\nin the very near future.\n\n####\n\nThe freeway frontier\n\nOne reason that not a lot of people know about the world\u2019s actually existing\ndriverless taxis is that even in the places where they operate, there isn\u2019t\nactually a good reason to take them.\n\nThe big problem is that Waymo\u2019s vehicles aren\u2019t authorized to drive on\nfreeways. That means that in most cases, going somewhere in a Waymo One\ndriverless taxi would be slower than going in an Uber or driving yourself.\nThat\u2019s fun if you\u2019re a curious tourist, a journalist, or just a technophile\nwho enjoys adventure. But what they have is essentially a product that is\ntechnically impressive but practically inferior to the existing alternatives.\nThe inability to use freeways is a particularly crippling issue in Phoenix,\ngiven its urban design, but San Francisco also has a strong freeway spine for\na lot of the most common trips you might want to take. And in San Francisco,\nthe service area doesn\u2019t include the airport, which in every city I\u2019m familiar\nwith is a really important pillar of the taxi market.\n\nImportantly, though, this isn\u2019t because there\u2019s any technical problem with\noperating driverless cars on freeways.\n\nThe somewhat paradoxical thing about city versus freeway driving is that\nfreeway driving is higher-stakes (because the cars are going much faster), but\nit\u2019s cognitively and logistically easier. In the city, even when everyone is\nfollowing the rules, you have all kinds of conflicts between moving cars and\nparking cars, between turning cars and pedestrians, between cars and bikes\nsharing lanes, and God knows what else. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s just not the case\nthat everyone is following the rules. People unloading trucks double-park all\nthe time. Pedestrians frequently cross mid-block. Cyclists don\u2019t always stop\nat stop signs. And the rule violations compound in complicated ways: The truck\nparks in the bike lane, so the cyclist serves into the traffic lane. Because\nthe vehicles are all moving relatively slowly, you\u2019re less likely to have a\nspectacular crash. But because the situation is more chaotic, it is a much\nmore technically difficult problem.\n\nRegulators have, reasonably, wanted Waymo to demonstrate success with the\nharder-but-lower-stakes problem before tackling the easier-but-higher-stakes\nproblem.\n\nBut Waymo has gotten regulatory permission to expand onto freeways and as far\nsouth as Sunnyvale, just outside San Jose. When this service rolls out it will\nbe much more useful than the existing version of Waymo, letting people get\nrides to the airport and to the major Silicon Valley corporate campuses at\nreasonable speeds. They are also testing service on Phoenix freeways, which\nagain will make it an actual competitive product that people might want to use\nfor reasons other than curiosity. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve seen humans driving Waymo\ncars around DC, which is apparently how their buildout works. The point is,\ndriverless cabs are really happening, to a greater extent than most people\nseem to know.\n\n####\n\nAutonomous vehicles could be a huge deal\n\nDuring the Obama-era AV hype cycle, the prospect of driverless cars was mostly\npresented as a threat. I remember former SEIU president Andy Stern making a\nbig deal about the possibility that automation would eliminate a lot of truck\ndriver jobs and create a disemployment crisis.\n\nOne nice thing about having a moderately inflationary full employment economy\nis that it helps focus political attention on questions of productivity and\ngrowth. It would of course be sad for cab drivers to lose their jobs. But the\ncurrent American economy has low unemployment and a decent number of job\nopenings, which means they\u2019re likely to find new work. And if driverless cars\nbring down the price of taxi rides, that reduces inflation, which reduces\ninterest rates and that benefits everyone \u2014 in particular, it reduces the cost\nof investment in the future of the American economy.\n\nTaxi rides are not a particularly large swathe of the Consumer Price Index.\n\nBut Stern\u2019s truck drivers are a much bigger deal. The price of much of what we\nbuy is at least in part a function of the cost of shipping, often via truck.\nMore cost-effective shipping would be a huge deal for the economy and a big\nboost to productivity and disinflation. Again, of course, every lost job is\nsad for the people who lose their jobs. Which, again, is a reason that it\u2019s\ngood to have a low-unemployment economy. But even better when you consider the\nimplications of making it cheaper to ship stuff, you\u2019re clearly creating more\ndemand for workers at other stages of the process by knocking out part of the\ncost of doing business.\n\nAnother area I\u2019m excited for is the humble city bus. Because a bus runs a\nfixed route across a constrained geography, it\u2019s ideally suited to this\ntechnology. Reducing bus operating costs lets you run more \u2014 and more frequent\n\u2014 routes, which is a huge win for riders. Transit agencies are currently\nfacing big financial deficits while also struggling to attract drivers at\ncurrent wages and also facing pressure to add security personnel. So in this\ncase, there\u2019s no big labor market issue at all, it\u2019s just a win.\n\nMost exciting of all, though, driverless cars (at least theoretically) have\nthe potential to revolutionize land use. The current business model problem\nfor Waymo is trying to compete with Uber, Lyft, and traditional taxi\ncompanies. But the ultimate promise of self-driving, if the geography becomes\nexpansive enough, is to make hiring a driverless taxi cost-competitive with\nowning your own car. If it\u2019s cheap enough to take driverless cabs basically\neverywhere you go rather than owning a car, then you don\u2019t need a parking\nspace. And if a critical mass of people start going the robotaxi route, then\nyour destination doesn\u2019t need a parking space either. That makes all kinds of\nconstruction projects cheaper and would be a huge shot in the arm to the\noverall economy.\n\nWe are currently a long way from the operating range of Waymo\u2019s product being\nlarge enough to even contemplate that. The ability of a human driver to roam\nacross an arbitrary and unfamiliar geography has a lot of value, even if most\nof us mostly just drive familiar streets near to where we live.\n\n####\n\nRegulatory choices matter\n\nThe key thing about this is that anything to do with moving vehicles on public\nthoroughfares is, correctly, going to be a pretty tightly regulated space.\n\nRight now, one cap on driverless taxi expansion is the need to get stepwise\nregulatory approval for expansion. But another cap is just the reality that\neven though human-driven cars kill people every day, anyone operating in the\ndriverless space knows that a single fatality could prompt a massive backlash.\nBased on its existing range, human drivers get into crashes 3-6 times as often\nas Waymo vehicles. That\u2019s good news. What would be better would be to hear\nclearer statements from taxi regulators and state transportation departments\nthat they are going to hold driverless vehicles to some kind of objective and\nreasonable \u201csafer than humans on average\u201d standard rather than pulling the\nplug the first time something bad happens.\n\nHuman driving is obviously much too useful to ban, but it\u2019s genuinely\nincredibly deadly \u2014 tons of people die every day, through no fault of their\nown, due to error on the part of other human drivers, and plenty others die as\na result of their own error.\n\nWhen it come to the safety of driverless cars, letting the perfect be the\nenemy of the \u201cbetter than the status quo\u201d is going to be a huge loss for\npublic health and economic productivity. And a lack of clear standards, or\neven verbal commitments, creates an unduly uncertain landscape for expansion.\nThis map is a helpful guide to the unclear statutory landscape for driverless\ncars, but keep in mind that land area isn\u2019t really the relevant criterion\nhere. North Dakota is very large, but as a taxi market, it\u2019s tiny compared to\nNew York City.\n\nMeanwhile, there is already some explicit backlash. The governor of Kentucky\nvetoed a driverless car bill as some kind of Teamsters Union thing (he got\noverridden). More insidiously, there is an effort afoot in California to\nestablish local control over driverless car regulation. As we know from the\nhousing landscape, the principle of localism is a good way to block stuff\nwithout explicitly saying you want to block stuff. An unfortunate aspect of\nthe American labor paradigm is that if specific unionized workplaces lose\njobs, that\u2019s bad for the union, even if the technological shift creates jobs\nand raises wages on average. As a result, union leaders are essentially duty-\nbound to oppose productivity-enhancing innovation, regardless of the merits.\n\nThat said, I think the labor backlash is in important ways a good sign. People\nmobilize against real threats, and those with something at stake can see that\nthis technology is real.\n\nIn my view, the more uncertain regulatory issue relates to land use.\nInnovations in transportation have historically been a very big deal\neconomically. But the reason they are a big deal is they facilitate changes in\nland use. When trains were invented, people built dense towns near train\nstations. When cars were invented, people built sprawling settlements along\nroadways. If you look at the pre-car world, there were no parking lots and no\ngarages. If you said \u201cwell, of course people can use cars, but nobody can\nbuild anything that\u2019s out of character with the existing environment,\u201d then\ncars would not have become very useful. In the opposite direction, the promise\nof driverless shouldn\u2019t just be that people can watch TV shows while commuting\n\u2014 it should be to allow the nature of communities to transform to use space\nmore efficiently. But for generations now, we\u2019ve been weirdly prescriptive\nabout the intersection of land use and transportation, not only allowing\nstructures that accommodate the personal automobile but requiring them. That\nleaves AVs stuck in the niche taxi market when they should be truly\ntransformational.\n\nShare\n\n88 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n5 Restacks\n\n88\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Self-driving cars are underhyped\n\nwww.slowboring.com\n\n201\n\nShare\n\n201 Comments\n\nJohn from FL5 hrs agoLiked by Ben KraussI think the idea of self-driving\nvehicles is very exciting.
