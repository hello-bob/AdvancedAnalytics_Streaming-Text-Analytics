He made a solo ascent of Mount Everest without bottled oxygen\nor Sherpa support on 23 May 1996, for which he travelled by bicycle, alone,\nfrom Sweden and part-way back.^[1]\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\nIn 1972 Kropp's father took him up Galdh\u00f8piggen, Norway, the highest peak in\nScandinavia. After finishing school, he served in the Swedish Parachute\nRangers, where he trained rigorously and met his future climbing partner Mats\nDahlin.^[2]\n\n## Mountaineering[edit]\n\nIn 1988, Kropp traveled to climb his first major peak, Lenin Peak (7134 meters\nhigh), located on the border between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Kropp and his\ncompanions ascended the peak in a record time of 10 days.^[3]\n\nIn 1989, Kropp had hopes of climbing Cho Oyu, but he had no permit. Instead,\nhe went to South America and climbed Iliniza Sur (5266 meters), Cotopaxi (5897\nmeters), Illimani (6300 meters), Huayna Potosi (6088 meters), and Illampu\n(6520 meters).\n\nIn a 1990 Swedish expedition, he and Danish climber Rafael Jensen climbed\nMuztagh Tower (7273 meters) in Pakistan. The mountain is one of the most\ndifficult 7000-meter mountains in the Himalayas, and their ascent was the\nfourth of the mountain.^[citation needed]\n\nIn 1991, Kropp climbed Pik Pobeda (7439 meters) in eastern Kyrgyzstan.\nTogether with Mats Dahlin, Kropp made a summit attempt, but Dahlin was forced\nto cancel his bid because of illness. Kropp continued and reached the top with\na severe headache.\n\nIn 1992, Kropp finally obtained permits to climb Cho Oyu. In preparation, he\nclimbed with Dahlin in Chamonix. While climbing the Aiguille Verte, a stone\nfell from the top of the ridge and hit Dahlin just below the helmet, at the\nedge of his temple, killing him.\n\nKropp decided to climb Cho Oyu nonetheless, on the grounds that his companion\nwould have preferred that he do so. He drove his Range Rover all the way to\nNepal. At the top, Kropp placed Dahlin's ice axe with an image of Dahlin\ndirected towards Mount Everest.\n\n### K2[edit]\n\nIn 1993, Kropp returned to Karakoram, this time to climb K2. Initially, he\nplanned to participate in a Swedish expedition, but Kropp realized that if he\ncould reach the top before the expedition's other participants, he would\nbecome the first Swede and Scandinavian to reach the top. Kropp therefore\njoined a Slovenian expedition scheduled to climb the mountain before the\nSwedes.^[citation needed] Another reason why he brought forward the date of\nhis climb was that his Range Rover had remained in Pakistan since his Cho Oyu\nclimb the previous year because customs in Iran refused to allow it\nthrough.^[citation needed]\n\nKropp's Slovenian colleagues had decided however to exclude him from their\nclimbing plans. Kropp settled, instead, to join David Sharman, who hoped to\nbecome the first Englishman to come down alive from the top.\n\nDuring the Slovenians' summit bid, a violent storm arose and stranded them at\nhigh altitude. Kropp abandoned his climb to save those he could. A week after\nthis incident, he stuck with his British colleague, but Sharman fell,\nfractured a leg, and went back down. Kropp climbed on and reached the peak\nsolo, without bottled oxygen. On the way down another storm on the mountain\nmarooned Kropp at 8,000 meters above sea level. Kropp made it later to base\ncamp.^[4]\n\nMedia interest after the climb proved to be extensive, and Kropp then started\nhis company, Kropp & Adventure AB.\n\nIn 1994, he returned again to Karakoram, accompanied by Andrew Lock and the\nSwedish climbers Mats Holmgren and Nicolas Gafgo. Their object was Broad Peak,\nand their goal was a first ascent of the hitherto unclimbed south-southwest\nridge, on which several reputable climbers had failed. They also failed and\nhad to turn back to below 7000 metres. Afterwards, they focused on the regular\nroute to the summit, where, on the first attempt Lock, Holmgren, and Kropp\nreached the foresummit. Kropp made another attempt at the main summit and\nsucceeded after a fast, non-stop solo climb.\n\n### Mount Everest[edit]\n\nThis section relies excessively on references to primary sources.

He traveled\n13,000 kilometres (8,000 mi) on the bicycle and arrived at Everest Base Camp\nin April 1996. Following a meeting of all of the Everest expeditions on the\nmountain at the time, it was agreed that Kropp would attempt to summit first.\nOn 3 May, Kropp climbed through thigh-deep snow and reached Everest's South\nSummit, a point 100 metres (328 ft) from the summit.^[5] However, he decided\nto turn around because it was too late in the day and if he continued, he\nwould be descending in the dark. While Kropp recovered from the ordeal at base\ncamp, the 1996 Everest Disaster unfolded. He helped bring medicine up the\nmountain. Three weeks later, on 23 May, he again tackled the mountain, this\ntime successfully summitting without extra oxygen support.^[6] He then cycled\npart of the way back home.^[7]\n\nHe returned to Everest in 1999 with his girlfriend Renata Chlumska to\nundertake a cleanup, during which they removed 25 discarded canisters from the\nmountain. They also successfully summited together.\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\nIn early 2000, Kropp and fellow Swede Ola Skinnarmo attempted to ski\nunsupported to the North Pole. Kropp had to abandon the expedition due to a\nfrostbitten thumb.^[8] During the expedition, he shot a polar bear which had\nbeen stalking the two men. This led to accusations in the Swedish tabloid\npress by writer Jan Guillou that Kropp was a poacher, since shooting polar\nbears was an inevitable consequence of skiing across the North Pole.^[9] Kropp\nsued for libel and when he lost, decided to move to Seattle in the US.\n\nLater that year, in London, the 1996 Everest expedition leader, Michael\nTrueman, successfully sued the publisher of Kropp's autobiography for\nlibel.^[10] Kropp had mixed Trueman's name up with that of expedition member\nMike Burns and thereby made false allegations about Trueman's character.\nConsequently, the book is banned in the UK.\n\n## Death[edit]\n\nOn 30 September 2002, Kropp died from head injuries when he fell 18 metres (60\nfeet) while ascending the Air Guitar route at Frenchman Coulee near Vantage,\nWashington. While being belayed by Seattle climber Erden Eru\u00e7, his protection\npulled out from a crack, and the wire-gate carabiner of the next piece of\nprotection broke.^[11]^[12] According to Eru\u00e7, Kropp died on impact.^[13]\n\n## Racing career[edit]\n\nKropp drove a couple of seasons in the Swedish and Nordic Formula Three\nseries. His last race was in 2000.^[citation needed] Kropp loved fast sports\ncars and drove Ferraris and Maseratis privately on the road. Together with von\nBraun Sports Cars he developed an advanced Ferrari F355 GT car for endurance\nracing. Only a few test races were made before he died.\n\n## Tribute[edit]\n\nAt the starting point of the climbing route Air Guitar at Sunshine Rock\noutside Seattle on which Kropp had died, climbing partner Erden Eru\u00e7, from\nSeattle, carved into the rock:\n\n    With a thumb up\n    Kropp on Top!\n    G\u00f6ran lives\n    1966\u20132002^[14]\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"\u00c5ttonde svensken p\u00e5 Mount Everest\" (in Swedish).
