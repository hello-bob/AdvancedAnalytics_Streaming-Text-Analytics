(AP) \u2014 With the midday sun blazing, an\nexperimental orange and white F-16 fighter jet launched with a familiar roar\nthat is a hallmark of U.S. airpower. But the aerial combat that followed was\nunlike any other: This F-16 was controlled by artificial intelligence, not a\nhuman pilot. And riding in the front seat was Air Force Secretary Frank\nKendall.\n\nAI marks one of the biggest advances in military aviation since the\nintroduction of stealth in the early 1990s, and the Air Force has aggressively\nleaned in. Even though the technology is not fully developed, the service is\nplanning for an AI-enabled fleet of more than 1,000 unmanned warplanes, the\nfirst of them operating by 2028.\n\nIt was fitting that the dogfight took place at Edwards Air Force Base, a vast\ndesert facility where Chuck Yeager broke the speed of sound and the military\nhas incubated its most secret aerospace advances. Inside classified simulators\nand buildings with layers of shielding against surveillance, a new test-pilot\ngeneration is training AI agents to fly in war. Kendall traveled here to see\nAI fly in real time and make a public statement of confidence in its future\nrole in air combat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have it,\u201d\nKendall said in an interview with The Associated Press after he landed. The\nAP, along with NBC, was granted permission to witness the secret flight on the\ncondition that it would not be reported until it was complete because of\noperational security concerns.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nNervous about falling behind the GOP, Democrats are wrestling with how to use\nAI\n\nWhat to know about Trump strategist\u2019s embrace of AI to help conservatives\n\nAI use by businesses is small but growing rapidly, led by IT sector and firms\nin Colorado and DC\n\nThe AI-controlled F-16, called Vista, flew Kendall in lightning-fast maneuvers\nat more than 550 miles an hour that put pressure on his body at five times the\nforce of gravity. It went nearly nose to nose with a second human-piloted F-16\nas both aircraft raced within 1,000 feet of each other, twisting and looping\nto try force their opponent into vulnerable positions.\n\nAt the end of the hourlong flight, Kendall climbed out of the cockpit\ngrinning. He said he\u2019d seen enough during his flight that he\u2019d trust this\nstill-learning AI with the ability to decide whether or not to launch weapons\nin war.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of opposition to that idea. Arms control experts and\nhumanitarian groups are deeply concerned that AI one day might be able to\nautonomously drop bombs that kill people without further human consultation,\nand they are seeking greater restrictions on its use.\n\n\u201cThere are widespread and serious concerns about ceding life-and-death\ndecisions to sensors and software,\u201d the International Committee of the Red\nCross has warned. Autonomous weapons \u201care an immediate cause of concern and\ndemand an urgent, international political response.\u201d\n\nKendall said there will always be human oversight in the system when weapons\nare used.\n\nThe military\u2019s shift to AI-enabled planes is driven by security, cost and\nstrategic capability. If the U.S. and China should end up in conflict, for\nexample, today\u2019s Air Force fleet of expensive, manned fighters will be\nvulnerable because of gains on both sides in electronic warfare, space and air\ndefense systems. China\u2019s air force is on pace to outnumber the U.S. and it is\nalso amassing a fleet of flying unmanned weapons.\n\nFuture war scenarios envision swarms of American unmanned aircraft providing\nan advance attack on enemy defenses to give the U.S. the ability to penetrate\nan airspace without high risk to pilot lives. But the shift is also driven by\nmoney. The Air Force is still hampered by production delays and cost overruns\nin the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which will cost an estimated of $1.7\ntrillion.\n\nSmaller and cheaper AI-controlled unmanned jets are the way ahead, Kendall\nsaid.\n\nVista\u2019s military operators say no other country in the world has an AI jet\nlike it, where the software first learns on millions of data points in a\nsimulator, then tests its conclusions during actual flights. That real-world\nperformance data is then put back into the simulator where the AI then\nprocesses it to learn more.\n\nChina has AI, but there\u2019s no indication it has found a way to run tests\noutside a simulator. And, like a junior officer first learning tactics, some\nlessons can only be learned in the air, Vista\u2019s test pilots said.\n\nUntil you actually fly, \u201cit\u2019s all guesswork,\u201d chief test pilot Bill Gray said.\n\u201cAnd the longer it takes you to figure that out, the longer it takes before\nyou have useful systems.\u201d\n\nVista flew its first AI-controlled dogfight in September 2023, and there have\nonly been about two dozen similar flights since. But the programs are learning\nso quickly from each engagement that some AI versions getting tested on Vista\nare already beating human pilots in air-to-air combat.\n\nThe pilots at this base are aware that in some respects, they may be training\ntheir replacements or shaping a future construct where fewer of them are\nneeded.\n\nBut they also say they would not want to be up in the sky against an adversary\nthat has AI-controlled aircraft if the U.S. does not also have its own fleet.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep running. And we have to run fast,\u201d Kendall said.\n\nTARA COPP\n\nCopp covers the Pentagon and national security for the Associated Press.
