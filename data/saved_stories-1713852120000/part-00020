She\nwent through the social media maelstrom herself and now chronicles its effects\non her generation. She writes widely, especially on her Substack, GIRLS.\n\nZach and I enjoy her writing so much that we invited her to join the core team\nat AnxiousGeneration.com. We\u2019ve already published one of her essays:\nAlgorithms Hijacked My Generation. I Fear For Gen Alpha. Now that she\u2019s on our\nteam, you can look forward to an essay from her each month as part of our\nseries of \u201cVoices of Gen Z.\u201d Welcome, Freya!\n\nScreenshot: YouTube @ryanjuanzemis, 1 Hour Of 90s High School Videos\n\nThere is a beautiful and melancholic word I like called anemoia. It means\nnostalgia for a time or a place one has never known.\n\nThis is a sentiment I often sense from my generation, Gen Z\u2014especially in\nrecent years. I see it in the YouTube videos of old concerts that get millions\nof views. I see it in our fascination with polaroids, vinyls, vintage cameras,\nand VHS tapes. And I see it in our reaction to gut-wrenching videos about how\nlife has changed, like this short movie about dating that recently went viral:\n\n@kylenutt117How dating has changed.. #shortfilm\n\nBut perhaps the best example of anemoia is the popularity of \u201890s high school\nvideos, like this one trending on TikTok. Or this one on YouTube, with\nmillions of views, captioned \u201cPhones? No. We had each other.\u201d\n\nThis video has nearly 30,000 comments, some from Gen Xers nostalgic for their\n\u201890s youth\u2014but many from Gen Z, aching for a world they never experienced.\nOlder generations might dismiss this as teens wanting to be different and\nreject modern culture, as they often do. But the comments reveal something\ndeeper:\n\n> \u201cThis feels nostalgic despite me not even existing during this time.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cThe whole concept of a real \u2018childhood\u2019 is completely out the window at\n> this point in time and that\u2019s extremely sad to me. Btw I\u2019m 15, born in\n> 2003.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cI\u2019m 20 years old so I wasn\u2019t even conceived at the time of this video but\n> it leaves me feeling empty. My highschool experience was nothing like this.\n> I remember short bursts of people living in the moment but EVERYTHING\n> revolved around our phones, Snapchat/Instagram status. It almost makes me\n> angry because I\u2019ve never had simple straight forward interaction as shown in\n> this video. Even looking at people in the background, they are completely\n> present and not buried in their phones. Everyone seemed a lot more social.\n> I\u2019m jealous of millennials/gen x, yall experienced a golden time to be young\n> and free.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cAs someone who graduated in 2015 this looks like such a nice time. Not a\n> phone in sight. People actually talking face-to-face. I wish I could have\n> grew up in an era like this.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cThe Matrix came out that year. Now we live in it.\u201d\n\nThere were hard times, of course\u2014the \u201890s weren\u2019t all bliss; no era is. But\nthe world we inhabit now is so markedly different. New technologies cheapen\nand undermine every basic human value. Friendship, family, love, self-\nworth\u2014all have been recast and commodified by the new digital world: by\nconstant connectivity, by apps and algorithms, by increasingly solitary\nplatforms and video games. I watch these \u201890s videos, and I have the\noverwhelming sense that something has been lost. Something communal, something\njoyous, something simple.\n\nOf course, we have so many material comforts and conveniences now. I can\nfollow the news all over the world, Google any statistic I want, write on\nSubstack, and WhatsApp someone on the other side of the world. All for free.\nIn a world like this, it\u2019s easy to see why older generations might not\nunderstand why Gen Z is struggling to cope.\n\nBut God, that loss\u2014that feeling. I am grieving something I never knew. I am\ngrieving that giddy excitement over waiting for and playing a new vinyl for\nthe first time, when now we instantly stream songs on YouTube, use Spotify\nwith no waiting, and skip impatiently through new albums. I am grieving the\nanticipation of going to the movies, when all I\u2019ve ever known is Netflix on\ndemand and spoilers, and struggling to sit through a entire film. I am\ngrieving simple joys\u2014reading a magazine; playing a board game; hitting a\nswing-ball for hours\u2014where now even split-screen TikToks, where two videos\nplay at the same time, don\u2019t satisfy our insatiable, miserable need to be\nentertained. I even have a sense of loss for experiencing tragic news\u2013\u2013a\nmoment in world history\u2013\u2013without being drenched in endless opinions online. I\nam homesick for a time when something horrific happened in the world, and\ninstead of immediately opening Twitter, people held each other. A time of more\nshared feeling, and less frantic analyzing. A time of being both disconnected\nbut supremely connected.\n\nBut I never knew it. Maybe briefly, as a child. But most of us in Gen Z were\ngiven phones and tablets so early that we barely remember life before them.\nMost of us never knew falling in love without swiping and subscription models.\nWe never knew having a first kiss without having watched PornHub first. We\nnever knew flirting and romance before it became sending DMs or reacting to\nSnapchat stories with flame emojis. We never knew friendship before it became\nkeeping up a Snapstreak or using each other like props to look popular on\nInstagram. And the freedom\u2014we never felt the freedom to grow up clumsily; to\nbe young and dumb and make stupid mistakes without fear of it being posted\nonline. Or the freedom to be unavailable, to disconnect for a while without\nthe pressure of Read Receipts and Last Active statuses. We never knew a\nchildhood spent chasing experiences and risks and independence instead of\nchasing stupid likes on a screen. Never knew life without documenting and\nmarketing and obsessively analyzing it as we went.\n\nNow, the next generation? Gen Alpha? I can only imagine the loss they will\nfeel. They are on track to never know friendship without AI chatbots, or\nlearning without VR classrooms, or life without looking through a Vision Pro.\nThey are being born into a world already anxious and atomised. My guess is\nthat one day they will find family photo albums and hear stories about how\ntheir Millennial parents met and be hit with anemoia.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m naive. Maybe all generations look back with nostalgia. But my sense\nis they don\u2019t do it for a time they never knew. They feel a longing for their\nyouth; their childhood. My parents might flick through black-and-white photos\nand hear stories from my grandparents and feel intrigued, but not so much\ngrief. I think there is something distinctly different and deserving of our\nattention about online forums filled with Zoomers wishing that they lived\nbefore social media. Wishing it didn\u2019t exist. These are children grieving\ntheir youth while they are still children. These are teens mourning childhoods\nthey wasted on the internet, writing laments such as \u201cI know I\u2019m still young\n(14F), and I have so many years to make up for that, but I can\u2019t help but hate\nmyself for those years I wasted doing nothing all day but go on my stupid\nphone.\u201d\n\nI think anemoia is partly why we\u2019re seeing a rise in sales for flip phones in\nthe United States, particularly among young people. I think that\u2019s why Gen Z\nis moving away from dating apps. And it\u2019s why, when Jonathan Haidt asked me to\njoin his Free the Anxious Generation team, and his chief researcher Zach\nRausch asked me to explain why I care about the movement, my first thought was\nto try and express this feeling\u2014the anxiety of a phone-based world. The\nloneliness, yes, but also the grief. The loss. The feeling of wanting to be\nfree from the only world we\u2019ve ever known.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can give future generations a real-\nworld childhood. We can prioritize play. We can delay entry to social media\nplatforms until at least 16. We can encourage young people to just hang out\nwith each other, without supervision and without smartphones. We can take\nelements of childhood from previous eras and re-introduce them in modern life.\nBut we have to remember what has been lost. When we are grieving record\nstores, mixtapes, old-school romance, and friends goofing around in \u201890s high\nschools, what are we actually grieving? Delayed gratification. Deeper\nconnection. Play and fun. Risk and thrill. Life with less obsessive self-\nscrutiny. These are things we can reclaim\u2014if we remember what they are worth\nand roll back the phone-based world that degraded them.\n\nWe have to start somewhere. I suppose what I\u2019m asking for here is some\nsympathy and a little more grace. It\u2019s easy to mock Gen Z and Gen Alpha for\ntheir soaring screen time, to roll your eyes at teenagers wasting their youth\nin their rooms, ruminating about themselves, and feeling hopeless about the\nfuture. But they are trying their best to keep up with a world so agonizingly\ndifferent from any before it\u2014and it is the only one they have ever known.\n\nSo please. Next time you cringe at Gen Z for not coping, for not feeling cut\nout for this world, remember how painful it is to think that the good times\nare over. Then imagine how much more painful it would be to realize you never\nknew them.\n\nPostscript from Jon Haidt:\n\nI am engaged in debates with other researchers about whether there is evidence\nthat social media is causing harm to adolescents rather than\u2014as some skeptics\nsay\u2014merely being correlated with harm (over and over again, in many\ncountries). The debate is entirely about quantitative evidence from studies\nthat measure time spent on social media, or that try to get young people to\nreduce their social media usage. But in the social sciences, qualitative\nevidence is an important kind of causal evidence. Freya is not just describing\nan accidental correlation. She is an eyewitness to the abduction of childhood,\nand in this essay, she brought us the eyewitness testimony of many others in\nher generation. Of course, we are then obligated to seek out voices on the\nother side\u2014members of Gen Z who write essays or books asserting that\nsmartphones and social media have improved their childhoods, their lives, or\ntheir mental health. We have done that in this essay by Eli George, in which\nhe found almost nobody offering a defense (we are still looking for Gen Z\u2019ers\nwho disagree with us. Please send us essays or videos of your critiques). This\nis not just another groundless moral panic. Freya is bringing us a plea for\nhelp from young people caught in a collective action trap.\n\nShare\n\n250 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n49 Restacks\n\n250\n\nShare this post\n\n#### A Time We Never Knew\n\nwww.afterbabel.com\n\n74\n\nShare\n\nA guest post by| Freya IndiaFreya India is a writer based in London, England.|\nSubscribe to Freya  \n---|---  \n  \n74 Comments\n\nSarah CooganPaths That Lead Home6 hrs agoI don't ordinarily comment on\nSubstack posts, but as a millennial, I just want to say: Freya, there are so\nmany people older than you who understand and resonate with what you say here.\nSome may \"cringe at Gen Z for not coping,\" but many others fully understand\nwhy you feel the way you do. It's unfair that Gen Zers couldn't enjoy screen-\nfree childhoods. Your willingness to speak on this subject is a gift to Gen\nAlpha, who can still be spared much of that technocratic infection. And it's a\ngift to our society more broadly.The good news is that embodied presence is\nalways available to those who make the conscious choice to fight for it. And\none of the glorious parts of adulthood is learning to recognise and prioritise\nthe things you need to flourish\u2014including freedom from screens. I hope that\nGen Z increasingly finds that to be true in the coming years.Thank you for\nsharing your perspective.Expand full commentLike (26)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n3 replies\n\nRuth GaskovskiSchool of the Unconformed5 hrs agoLiked by Freya IndiaThanks\nFreya for delving into the grief of what has been lost to remind us that we\ncan go beyond the present lament and have agency to change what lies ahead.\nWe, especially us parents, are not powerless to return to: \u201cDelayed\ngratification.
