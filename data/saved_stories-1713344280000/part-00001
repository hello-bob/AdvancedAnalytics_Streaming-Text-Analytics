To create successful products with long-lasting market impact,\nit\u2019s essential for the critical IP to be differentiated by performance, power,\nand features. It is difficult to predict and design for every potential\napplication, especially considering each application has unique interfaces and\nprocessing requirements. Adding embedded programable logic enables designers\nto adapt their IC to support any interface and associated data processing.\nEmbedded FPGA technology like Flex Logix\u2019s IP enables greater market\napplicability and product differentiation.\n\nFig. 1: Typical applications for eFPGA in AI and signal processing ICs.\n\nConsider figure 1 above, each of the interfaces requires different pre-\nprocessing. Let\u2019s first examine data coming from network interfaces. These\noften require deterministic packet processing for parsing high speed data\npackets. These functions include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * Packet forward and redirection (switching)\n  * Detection and correction of data errors\n  * Decryption and security policy enforcement\n  * Transformation and data reduction\n  * UDP/IP encapsulation\n\nWhile many of these functions can be performed in a lookaside implementation,\nEFLX eFPGA IP can efficiently execute these functions in line. This increases\neffectiveness and performance, which can be essential in real-time\napplications like industrial networking. Figure 2 shows a hardware protocol\nstack engine from CAST, which only uses a few EFLX eFPGA tiles. Because it\u2019s\nreconfigurable, this IP can scale from 1G up to 100G networks, increasing\nmarketability.\n\nFig. 2: 40G/50G UDP/IP Hardware Protocol Stack Engine from CAST.\n\nIn addition to packet parsing, real-time security policies can be implemented\npreventing external threats from corrupting the device and incoming data.\nFigure 3 shows an implementation of a dynamic packet security engine from\nDynanic. This utilizes the programmable logic to efficiently capture, filter,\ndivert or tag all traffic of interest at very high speeds to detect network\nanomalies or malicious traffic. Moreover, it has the capability to\ncontinuously adapt to the entire solution to the target network and evolving\nthreats.\n\nFig. 3: Dynanic SmartNIC solution.\n\nThis is only a small subset of packet processing applications of network data.\nAlternatively, another common application of these ICs is inferencing data\nfrom video streams. Video sources come from a variety of sensor interfaces\nincluding MIPI, USB, LVDS and Ethernet, which requires flexibility. Each can\nvary in resolution, frame rate and color depth. This affects the data path,\nboth data width and data rate. Processing performance can be further\naccelerated by not only processing the pixels in parallel, but also multiple\nvideo channels in parallel. Figure 4 shows common IP utilized in image signal\nprocessing pipelines, which efficiently run in eFPGA IP.\n\nFig. 4: Components of a typical image signal processing pipeline.\n\nFinally, the third application we examine is generic signal processing of\nsampled data from data converters. This data requires a completely different\ntype of signal processing, which typically includes adaptive filters,\ntransforms like FFTs and IFFTs, as well as generic matrix multiplication and\ninversion algorithms. Many of these signal processing applications can be\nimplemented in embedded programmable logic and further accelerated with\ndigital signal processing IP and TPU cores \u2013 both available from Flex Logix.\nIn addition, these IP remain dynamic and flexible, enabling adaptability to\nevolving application demands.\n\nShown below is a simplified block diagram of Flex Logix\u2019s DSP IP core. The\n22\u00d722-bit signed real multiplier is also configurable as an 11\u00d711-bit signed\ncomplex multiplier without additional resources. Similarly, the pre-adder and\nthe post-adder can do 11- and 24-bit complex signed additions/subtractions,\nrespectively. Other DSP features include the rounding operations using the\nbuilt-in sign-detection logic and the local carry-in signals.\n\nFig. 5: Simplified DSP diagram.\n\nMultiple DSP blocks can be efficiently concatenated to realize larger\nmultipliers and adders, in both real and complex modes. Figure 6 shows a\n10-tap symmetric FIR filter using only five DSPs blocks.\n\nFig. 6: An example of a 22-bit 10-tap FIR filter utilizing only 5 DSP blocks.\n\nDynamic and reconfigurable in real-time, the DSP blocks enable adaptive\nfilters as shown in figure 7.\n\nFig. 7: Common adaptive noise filter design.\n\nAs mentioned above, Flex Logix IP also offers a TPU core, InferX, ideal for\nany vector/matrix computation. InferX is effectively a scalable one-\ndimensional tensor processor (vector & matrix) controlled by the eFPGA fabric\nallowing IP adaptability to any signal processing algorithm implementation,\nincluding AI models. InferX has roughly 10 times the DSP performance of the\naforementioned DSP IP and uses only one-quarter of the area.\n\nFig. 8: InferX IP scalable from 1/8th of a tile to > 8 tiles.\n\nInferX achieves up to dozens of TeraMACs/second at TSMC 5nm node. It is ideal\nfor applications including FFT, FIR, IIR, beam forming, matrix/vector\noperations, matrix inversions, Kalman functions and more. It can handle Real\nor Complex, INT16x16 with accumulation at INT40 for accuracy. Multiple DSP\noperations can be pipelined in streaming mode or packet mode. See below for\nmore benchmarks for common algorithms running on TSMC\u2019s 5nm node.\n\nInferX DSP solutions are easily programmed via common tools like Matlab\nSimulink. Flex Logix built a ready-to-use standard Simulink block set that\nprovides a simplified configuration, bit-accurate modeling with flexible\nprecision.\n\nThis illustrates how Flex Logix IP can tackle any pre-processing algorithm\nwhile maintaining flexibility to adapt to emerging market demands. Beyond\npreprocessing data, whether it be network data, video streams, or sampled\ndata, it\u2019s also important to manage data into the central processor. Flex\nLogix IP can buffer data into the CPU to maximize efficiency and prevent\nstarvation. And once computation has completed, Flex Logix IP can also assist\nin getting the data off chip by adapting the output data to any protocol and\nphysical layer. By utilizing Flex Logix IP in your design, you can not only\nincrease your market applicability but also adjust to novel protocols,\nevolving security threats, and most importantly, emerging market demands!\n\nWant to learn more about Flex Logix IP for adaptable and high performance pre-\nand post-processing?
