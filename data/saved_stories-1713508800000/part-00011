According to a theory proposed by theoretical physicist John\nWheeler, who outlined his thoughts in a conversation with fellow physicist\nRichard Feynman, there is only one electron \u2013 it just looks like there are a\nlot more because it is moving forward and backward in time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs odd as this sounds, it is itself a response to the incredible weirdness of\nelectrons. Electrons, like other elementary particles, are indistinguishable\nfrom each other. They have the same negative charge, the same mass, and the\nsame spin. Swap one electron for another, and you won't be able to tell.\n\nIts antiparticle \u2013 the positron \u2013 are also indistinguishable from each other,\nidentical in their charge, mass, and spin. Strangely, they are identical to\nelectrons, aside from their positive charge. It was these factors that led\nWheeler to suggest that electrons and positrons were actually just one\nparticle, negatively charged as it goes forward in time, and positively\ncharged as it goes backward in time.\n\n### SPONSORED CONTENT\n\n  1.

And, then he explained on the\ntelephone, 'suppose that the world lines which we were ordinarily considering\nbefore in time and space \u2013 instead of only going up in time were a tremendous\nknot, and then, when we cut through the knot, by the plane corresponding to a\nfixed time, we would see many, many world lines and that would represent many\nelectrons, except for one thing. If in one section this is an ordinary\nelectron world line, in the section in which it reversed itself and is coming\nback from the future we have the wrong sign to the proper time \u2013 to the proper\nfour velocities \u2013 and that\u2019s equivalent to changing the sign of the charge,\nand, therefore, that part of a path would act like a positron'.\u201d\n\nThat would make for an old particle, having bounced back and forth through\ntime a truly incomprehensible number of times. While this would be a fun way\nto explain why electrons and positrons share properties, it is incredibly\nunlikely to be correct. As Feynman points out, there are not nearly as many\npositrons as electrons in the universe, and there is more matter than\nantimatter. If positrons and electrons were the same elementary particle going\nforward and backward in time, you'd expect there to be an even number.\n\n\"Well, maybe [the missing positrons] are hidden in the protons or something,\"\nwas the explanation that Wheeler offered, pretty unconvincingly. Though a\nthought experiment, and likely not supposed to be taken seriously, the phone\ncall had a lasting impact on Feynman, writing a paper on how positrons can be\ndescribed as if they are electrons moving backward in time.\n\n\"I did not take the idea that all the electrons were the same one from him as\nseriously as I took the observation that positrons could simply be represented\nas electrons going from the future to the past in a back section of their\nworld lines,\" he added. \"That, I stole!\"\n\n### ARTICLE POSTED IN\n\nSpace and Physicsphysics\n\n  * electrons,\n\n  * time travel,\n\n  * antimatter,\n\n  * Richard Feynman,\n\n  * physics,\n\n  * positrons,\n\n  * weird and wonderful\n\nFOLLOW ONNEWS\n\n## More Space and Physics Stories\n\nNearby Supernova Was Surprisingly Lacking In Cosmic Rays, Throwing Doubts On\nTheories\n\nAstronomy\n\n### Nearby Supernova Was Surprisingly Lacking In Cosmic Rays, Throwing Doubts\nOn Theories\n\n5 hours ago\n\n14\n\nScientists Searching For Extraterrestrial Life Have First \"Contact Call\" \u2013\nWith A Whale\n\nSpace and Physics\n\n### Scientists Searching For Extraterrestrial Life Have First \"Contact Call\" \u2013\nWith A Whale\n\n10 hours ago\n\n200\n\nMilky Way\u2019s Newly Record-Breaking Stellar Black Hole Has The Mass Of 33 Suns\n\nAstronomy\n\n### Milky Way\u2019s Newly Record-Breaking Stellar Black Hole Has The Mass Of 33\nSuns\n\n11 hours ago\n\n190\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### SPONSORED CONTENT\n\n  1.
