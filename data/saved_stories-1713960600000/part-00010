Sadly, one year later I've reached a\npoint where I'm just not willing to continue the way I did before.\n\nSo this is my letter of resignation.\n\n## Why?\n\nEver since I first started to use Linux I was fascinated by the idea of open\nsource. Almost everything I built on my own is open source, and I'm still\ncontributing to upstream projects I'm using if I encounter things I can\nimprove.\n\nI sponsored an open source project for the first time over ten years ago when\nI was still in university, because I always held the belief that if a project\nis valuable for me, it's worth supporting it. And if I don't have the time to\ncontribute to it myself, I should at least support the people that do.\n\nOf course, there are people that explicitly do not want any kind of\nsponsorship, but if they do, I'm happy to help. Working on an open source\nproject is still work, and if you're doing a good job, you should be rewarded\nfor it. I also always believed that if you ever started a project that is\nvaluable for companies, they would support you in return, at least that's the\nreason why my own company is a monthly sponsor of Verdaccio and why I\nsponsored maintainers of libraries I'm relying on.\n\nSo, due to these naive believes, I started to work on nut.js under Apache-2.0\nlicense, because I thought that if companies and individuals alike are able to\npermissively use my software, they would also be willing to support me in\nreturn. Now, before you start judging me that I'm only in for the money,\nwouldn't you agree that it sounds awesome to work on an open source project\nfull time, and still be able to pay your bills?\n\nDid it work out? No. All I got was complaints.\n\nIn the beginning, people were complaining that the image search plugin was\nbaked into the core of nut.js, and that they were forced to use certain\ncompatible versions of node or Electron. Then they started complaining that\nthe image search plugin was not compatible with Apple Silicon. Which I made\nclear I would not be able to fix without a machine to test on. So if nobody is\nwilling to lend me a machine or sponsor me, so I could get one myself, it's\nnot going to happen.\n\nYou think anyone made a move? Nope.\n\nOnce I decided to take the investment myself, but charge for the new plugin, I\nsuddenly turned into the greedy asshole that's not giving away everything for\nfree.\n\nSame goes for companies. Nobody cares about you as long as everything is\nworking smoothly, but as soon as they encounter a problem, guess who comes\nknocking on my door?\n\nThis public issue on the nut.js repo, where I'm publicly accused of something\nthat's entirely not true was the final nail in the coffin.\n\nThis has happened several times already. I've been insulted for the things I\ndo with nut.js on Discord, Reddit and now GitHub, but this time, I'm not just\nsucking it up.\n\nIt may seem to you that open source is great because it's free to use. Truth\nis, it certainly is not free. Someone is paying a price for it, and if it's\nnot the user, it's the maintainer.\n\nEveryone's time is valuable, and you may want to spend it wisely. If it's fun\nto spend time on something, that's great. But if it becomes a burden, it's not\nfun anymore.\n\nAnd if people start insulting you for something you're doing in your free\ntime, it's time to stop.\n\nOpen source is great, but it's not sustainable. We self-sabotaged ourselves\nover decades, and now we're at a point where it's hard to turn back.\nPublishing source code for the greater good is a noble cause, but to be\nhonest, I think that over the years, using \"open source\" has become an excuse\nto avoid paying for software.\n\nAnd who's to blame if something goes wrong? The maintainers, of course.\n\nI've played this game with nut.js for almost six years, but it's coming to an\nend now.\n\n## What's next?\n\nAll of my packages around nut.js will cease to exist publicly on npm. Ready-\nto-use packages will only be available through the private nut.js package\nregistry, which requires an active subscription to be used.\n\nThe GitHub repo will remain public, so if you want to continue using nut.js on\nyour own, you'll have to take care of building, testing and hosting packages\nyourself.\n\nIf you want to save yourself some time and work, you should grab a license\ntoday, because prices will also increase with the release of additional\nplugins. Existing subscribers will not be affected by this increase.\n\n## Will I stop working on nut.js entirely?\n\nDefinitely not.\n\nI'll continue to work on nut.js, but updates to the repo will happen with a\ndelay. New features, patches, bug fixes and security updates will be made\navailable to subscribers first.\n\nAs I said, if you want to continue using nut.js, you'll have to take care of\nbuilding, testing and hosting packages yourself.\n\nAll the best\n\nSimon\n\nNext\n\n    A short nut.js plugin summary \u2192\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 nutjs.dev | Imprint | Cancellation policy\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
