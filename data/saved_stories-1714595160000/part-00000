To visualize this, I used\nPennDOT's Traffic Information Repository (TIRe) to map and graph the hourly\ndirectional traffic volume for April 8th. Below is a map of the locations of\ntraffic counters for this post. I picked a sampling of counters in a variety\nof locations on highways going roughly north and south. For reference, the\nsolar eclipse occurred from 2:02 PM to 4:30 PM in Erie, PA. Totality occurred\nfrom 3:16 to 3:20.\n\n### Locations of Traffic Counters Mentioned in this Post\n\nPowered by Esri\n\nThis first counter in Crawford county just south of Erie shows an expected\nincrease in northbound traffic in the morning and then a huge surge of\nsouthbound traffic after totality.\n\nMy family travelled through the Route 15 counter shown below around 6 pm.\nTioga county is pretty rural and this road is usually empty, and so it was\nrare to see so many cars going in one direction. Traffic was about 600% of\nnormal. Notice the peak time of southbound traffic is about two hours after\ntotality, reflecting the time required to drive from the totality path area to\nthe counter.\n\nThis counter on I-81 near Scranton is further south. The disparity of\nsouthbound traffic here spans multiple hours into the evening. This position\nwould likely pick up a large portion of travellers going back to the NYC area.\n\nThe chart for this I-83 counter is several hours south of the totality path.\nIt does not look as dramatic, but you notice a large disparity late in the\nevening starting at 10 p.m with traffic around 300% of normal.\n\nAside from major accidents our road closures, The traffic disparities on April\n8 were significant. A good follow-up project could be to compare the elipse to\nother events like big sporting events or holidays. If you have any events in\nmind to rival April 8th, send them my way.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
