(Throwflame photo)\n\nThe robodog itself is guided by Light Detection and Ranging, or LIDAR, a low-\npower, eye-safe laser technology which measures light reflected from short\npulses to quickly and accurately make 3D maps of an environment. Such systems\nare used for surveying and even in some self-driving cars. LIDAR has become\npopular for drones that are meant to operate in dense environments, especially\nurban ones.\n\nThe ARC flamethrower is attached to the robodog via Picatinny rails found on\nfirearms to attach scopes, lasers, bipods, and other accessories.\n\nThe flamethrower attaches to the robodog by a grooved mount. (Throwflame\nimage)\n\nAccording to Throwflame\u2019s literature, Thermonator can be used for a variety of\npurposes, including wildfire control and prevention, agriculture management,\nconservation, snow and ice removal, as well as for entertainment and special\neffects purposes.\n\nA flamethrowing robodog, however, also has potentially far less benign\napplications.\n\nFlamethrowers have been used as weapons since the German army began fielding\nthem in 1911. They were used to devastating effect in ensuing conflicts to\nburn out enemy positions like pill boxes and other hardened targets, as well\nas to clear trenches, and spark fear.\n\nGerman troops using a flamethrower during WW1. (New Zealand History photo)\n\nThe war in Ukraine has shown the value of uncrewed weapons systems, ranging\nfrom aerial and surface drones, with small uncrewed ground vehicles becoming\npopular as of late, especially explosive-laden types. The ability to hit the\nenemy without risking troops has gained tremendous practical applications as\nRussia\u2019s all-out invasion grinds on. Something like the Thermonator could have\ngreat appeal, especially if it had more robust autonomous capabilities.\nDealing with these rushing into trenches could be a terrifying affair.\n\nUsing robodogs as weapons delivery systems is not a new concept.\n\nAs we reported last year, the U.S. Marine Corps already explored using\nrobodogs as weapons, mounting a training version of the M72 infantry anti-\narmor rocket launcher on one of the four-legged automatons. Such weapon\nsystems are gaining increasing interest not just from U.S. armed forces \u2014 the\nChinese and Russian militaries are also exploring arming four-legged uncrewed\nground systems. The Marine design bears a striking resemblance to a Chinese-\nmade commercial-of-the-shelf quadrupedal robot that has emerged in anti-armor\nrocket launcher and submachine gun-armed configurations in Russia in the past.\n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps has tested a four-legged \"robotic goat\" armed with a\ntraining version of the M72 anti-armor rocket launcher.

You can read\nmore about what these systems are currently capable of in this past report.\n\nWe asked Throwflame if they have had any contact with the U.S. or any other\nmilitary about Thermonator and will update this story should they respond.\nHowever, their website does acknowledge that there is a likely military use\nfor this system.\n\n\u201cNeed a Wolfpack? Send us an email and ask about our bulk discounts!\u201d\nThrowflame says on its website, above images of U.S. military service branches\nand a box containing information about \u201cagency-specific procurement and\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) export controls for the\nThermonator.\u201d\n\nGiven the tough fight in Ukraine, and anticipated brutal battles in the\nPacific, it likely won\u2019t be long until Thermonator, or something like it,\nfinds itself on a killing field somewhere.\n\nContact the author: howard@thewarone.com\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
