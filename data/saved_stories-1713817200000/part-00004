Credit: Kyle Palmer / PPPL\nCommunications Department\n\nIn their ongoing quest to develop a range of methods for managing plasma so it\ncan be used to generate electricity in a process known as fusion, researchers\nat the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory\n(PPPL) have shown how two old methods can be combined to provide greater\nflexibility.\n\nWhile the two methods\u2014known as electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) and\napplying resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP)\u2014have long been studied, this is\nthe first time researchers have simulated how they can be used together to\ngive enhanced plasma control.\n\n\"This is kind of a new idea,\" said Qiming Hu, a staff research physicist at\nPPPL and lead author of a new paper published in Nuclear Fusion about the\nwork, which has also been demonstrated experimentally. \"The full capabilities\nare still being figured out, but our paper does a great job of advancing our\nunderstanding of the potential benefits.\"\n\nUltimately, scientists hope to use fusion to generate electricity. First, they\nwill need to overcome several hurdles, including perfecting methods for\nminimizing bursts of particles from the plasma that are known as edge-\nlocalized modes (ELMs).\n\n\"Periodically, these bursts release a little bit of pressure because it's too\nmuch. But these bursts can be dangerous,\" said Hu, who works for PPPL at the\nDIII-D National Fusion Facility, a DOE user facility hosted by General\nAtomics. DIII-D is a tokamak, a device that uses magnetic fields to confine a\nfusion plasma in a donut shape. ELMs can end a fusion reaction and even damage\nthe tokamak, so researchers have developed many ways to try to avoid them.\n\n\"The best way we've found to avoid them is by applying resonant magnetic\nperturbations, or RMPs, that generate additional magnetic fields,\" said PPPL\nPrincipal Research Physicist Alessandro Bortolon, who was one of the co-\nauthors of the paper.\n\n## Magnetic fields generate islands, microwaves adjust them\n\nThe magnetic fields initially applied by the tokamak wind around the torus-\nshaped plasma, both the long way\u2014around the outer edge, and the short way\u2014from\nthe outer edge and through the center hole. The additional magnetic fields\ncreated by the RMPs travel through the plasma, weaving in and out like a\nsewer's stitch. These fields produce oval or circular magnetic fields in the\nplasma called magnetic islands.\n\nThe image on the left shows the tokamak and 3D magnetic perturbation generated\nby 3D coils, with the purple-blue hues representing lower amplitude\nperturbations and the red representing higher amplitude perturbations. The\nimage on the right is a closer view showing the top half of the tokamak and\nplasma. The coils are used to generate the magnetic field perturbations that\nproduce the islands (blue). Another coil can also be found on the bottom of\nthe machine. The injection system for the ECCD microwaves is depicted on top\n(red). These can be used to adjust the width of the islands. Credit: Qiming Hu\n/ PPPL\n\n\"Normally, islands in plasmas are really, really bad. If the islands are too\nbig, then the plasma itself can disrupt.\"\n\nHowever, the researchers already knew experimentally that under certain\nconditions, the islands can be beneficial. The hard part is generating RMPs\nbig enough to generate the islands. That's where the ECCD, which is basically\na microwave beam injection, comes in. The researchers found that adding ECCD\nto the plasma's edge lowers the amount of current required to generate the\nRMPs necessary to make the islands.\n\nThe microwave beam injection also allowed the researchers to perfect the size\nof the islands for maximum plasma edge stability. Metaphorically, the RMPs act\nlike a simple light switch that turns the islands on, while the ECCD acts like\nan additional dimmer switch that lets the researchers adjust the islands to\nthe ideal size for a manageable plasma.\n\n\"Our simulation refines our understanding of the interactions in play,\" Hu\nsaid. \"When the ECCD was added in the same direction as the current in the\nplasma, the width of the island decreased, and the pedestal pressure\nincreased. Applying the ECCD in the opposite direction produced opposite\nresults, with island width increasing and pedestal pressure dropping or\nfacilitating island opening.\"\n\n## ECCD at the edge, instead of the core\n\nThe research is also notable because ECCD was added to the plasma's edge\ninstead of the core, where it is typically used.\n\n\"Usually, people think applying localized ECCD at the plasma edge is risky\nbecause the microwaves may damage in-vessel components,\" said Hu. \"We've shown\nthat it's doable, and we've demonstrated the flexibility of the approach. This\nmight open new avenues for designing future devices.\"\n\nBy lowering the amount of current required to generate the RMPs, this\nsimulation work could ultimately lead to lowering the cost of fusion energy\nproduction in commercial-scale fusion devices of the future.\n\nMore information: Q.M.
