Of course, the\nmotivation is around Valve's Steam Deck but for Linux gaming at large to\nbenefit too from this scheduler work to ideally yield less stuttering during\ngameplay.\n\nThe Igalia presentation focused on the impact the Linux scheduler has on\nstuttering during gaming and then how \"sched_ext\" can come into play as the\nBPF-based extensible scheduler framework. The sched_ext effort has been\ninteresting for many reasons for extending the kernel scheduler via (e)BPF\nranging from Canonical/Ubuntu exploring its possibilities, faster prototyping\nof new scheduler designs, to now showing positive results for Linux gaming\nwith a new scheduler implementation.\n\nThe Latency-criticality Aware Virtual Deadline (LAVD) scheduler was the main\ntechnical focus of Changwoo Min's presentation. This deadline-based scheduler\nwritten in Rust for sched_ext has shown promising results. The LAVD scheduler\nwas showing better or similar performance to EEVDF in the tests carried out by\nIgalia atop a Linux 6.9-rc1 based kernel when looking both at the average FPS\nand the 1% low frame rates.\n\nThose wishing to learn more about the LAVD scheduler exploration for Linux\ngaming can see the slide deck from OSS NA 2024 for those that weren't in\nSeattle for the conference. Those wanting to explore this LAVD scheduler can\nsee scx_lavd on crates.io. It will be interesting to see what Valve ultimately\ndecides to do around the scheduler for the Steam Deck / Steam OS and what\nfurther scheduler optimizations may still come about in the near-term.\n\n17 Comments\n\nTweet\n\nRelated News\n\nFEX-Emu 2404 Optimization Can Take Memcpy From 2-3 GB/s To 88 GB/s\n\nLinux 6.10 To Merge NTSYNC Driver For Emulating Windows NT Synchronization\nPrimitives\n\nProposed \"LibGodot\" Lets You Embed Godot Game Engine Into Other Apps\n\nOpenRazer 3.8 Brings Support For Newer Razer Devices On Linux\n\nSDL 3.0 Will Now Prefer PipeWire Over PulseAudio\n\nLutris 0.5.17 Game Manager Brings Bug Fixes, Library Syncing & New Runners\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
