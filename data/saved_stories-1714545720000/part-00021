We leverage our\nSAFE (see below) principles to provide the framework to create that experience\nfor both users and developers. Here's what these principles mean in practice:\n\n  * (S)afeguard our Users. Help them discover quality apps that they can trust.\n  * (A)dvocate for Developer Protection. Build platform safeguards to enable developers to focus on growth.\n  * (F)oster Responsible Innovation. Thoughtfully unlock value for all without compromising on user safety.\n  * (E)volve Platform Defenses. Stay ahead of emerging threats by evolving our policies, tools and technology.\n\nWith those principles in mind, we\u2019ve made recent improvements and introduced\nnew measures to continue to keep Google Play\u2019s users safe, even as the threat\nlandscape continues to evolve. In 2023, we prevented 2.28 million policy-\nviolating apps from being published on Google Play^1 in part thanks to our\ninvestment in new and improved security features, policy updates, and advanced\nmachine learning and app review processes. We have also strengthened our\ndeveloper onboarding and review processes, requiring more identity information\nwhen developers first establish their Play accounts. Together with investments\nin our review tooling and processes, we identified bad actors and fraud rings\nmore effectively and banned 333K bad accounts from Play for violations like\nconfirmed malware and repeated severe policy violations.\n\nAdditionally, almost 200K app submissions were rejected or remediated to\nensure proper use of sensitive permissions such as background location or SMS\naccess. To help safeguard user privacy at scale, we partnered with SDK\nproviders to limit sensitive data access and sharing, enhancing the privacy\nposture for over 31 SDKs impacting 790K+ apps. We also significantly expanded\nthe Google Play SDK Index, which now covers the SDKs used in almost 6 million\napps across the Android ecosystem. This valuable resource helps developers\nmake better SDK choices, boosts app quality and minimizes integration risks.\n\n## Protecting the Android Ecosystem\n\nBuilding on our success with the App Defense Alliance (ADA), we partnered with\nMicrosoft and Meta as steering committee members in the newly restructured ADA\nunder the Joint Development Foundation, part of the Linux Foundation family.\nThe Alliance will support industry-wide adoption of app security best\npractices and guidelines, as well as countermeasures against emerging security\nrisks.\n\nAdditionally, we announced new Play Store transparency labeling to highlight\nVPN apps that have completed an independent security review through App\nDefense Alliance\u2019s Mobile App Security Assessment (MASA). When a user searches\nfor VPN apps, they will now see a banner at the top of Google Play that\neducates them about the \u201cIndependent security review\u201d badge in the Data safety\nsection. This helps users see at-a-glance that a developer has prioritized\nsecurity and privacy best practices and is committed to user safety.\n\nTo better protect our customers who install apps outside of the Play Store, we\nmade Google Play Protect\u2019s security capabilities even more powerful with real-\ntime scanning at the code-level to combat novel malicious apps. Our security\nprotections and machine learning algorithms learn from each app submitted to\nGoogle for review and we look at thousands of signals and compare app\nbehavior. This new capability has already detected over 5 million new,\nmalicious off-Play apps, which helps protect Android users worldwide.\n\n## More Stringent Developer Requirements and Guidelines\n\nLast year we updated Play policies around Generative AI apps, disruptive\nnotifications, and expanded privacy protections. We also are raising the bar\nfor new personal developer accounts by requiring new testing requirements\nbefore developers can make their app available on Google Play. By testing\ntheir apps, getting feedback and ensuring everything is ready before they\nlaunch, developers are able to bring more high quality content to Play users.\nIn order to increase trust and transparency, we\u2019ve introduced expanded\ndeveloper verification requirements, including D-U-N-S numbers for\norganizations and a new \u201cAbout the developer\u201d section.\n\nTo give users more control over their personal data, apps that enable account\ncreation now need to provide an option to initiate account and data deletion\nfrom within the app and online. This web requirement is especially important\nso that a user can request account and data deletion without having to\nreinstall an app. To simplify the user experience, we have also incorporated\nthis as a feature within the Data safety section of the Play Store.\n\nWith each iteration of the Android operating system (including its robust set\nof APIs), a myriad of enhancements are introduced, aiming to elevate the user\nexperience, bolster security protocols, and optimize the overall performance\nof the Android platform. To further safeguard our customers, approximately 1.5\nmillion applications that do not target the most recent APIs are no longer\navailable in the Play Store to new users who have updated their devices to the\nlatest Android version.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nProtecting users and developers on Google Play is paramount and ever-evolving.\nWe're launching new security initiatives in 2024, including removing apps from\nPlay that are not transparent about their privacy practices.\n\nWe also recently filed a lawsuit in federal court against two fraudsters who\nmade multiple misrepresentations to upload fraudulent investment and crypto\nexchange apps on Play to scam users. This lawsuit is a critical step in\nholding these bad actors accountable and sending a clear message that we will\naggressively pursue those who seek to take advantage of our users.\n\nWe're constantly working on new ways to protect your experience on Google Play\nand across the entire Android ecosystem, and we look forward to sharing more.\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. In accordance with the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) reporting requirements, Google Play now calculates policy violations based on developer communications sent. \u21a9\n\nGoogle\n\nLabels: android , android security , google play , google play protect\n\n#### No comments :\n\nPost a Comment\n\n## Labels\n\n  * #sharethemicincyber\n  * #supplychain #security #opensource\n  * android\n  * android security\n  * android tr\n  * app security\n  * big data\n  * biometrics\n  * blackhat\n  * C++\n  * chrome\n  * chrome enterprise\n  * chrome security\n  * connected devices\n  * CTF\n  * diversity\n  * encryption\n  * federated learning\n  * fuzzing\n  * Gboard\n  * google play\n  * google play protect\n  * hacking\n  * interoperability\n  * iot security\n  * kubernetes\n  * linux kernel\n  * memory safety\n  * Open Source\n  * pha family highlights\n  * pixel\n  * privacy\n  * private compute core\n  * Rowhammer\n  * rust\n  * Security\n  * security rewards program\n  * sigstore\n  * spyware\n  * supply chain\n  * targeted spyware\n  * tensor\n  * Titan M2\n  * VDP\n  * vulnerabilities\n  * workshop\n\n## Archive\n\n  * 2024\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n  * 2023\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2022\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2021\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2020\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2019\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2018\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2017\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2016\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2015\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2014\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2013\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2012\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2011\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2010\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n  * 2009\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n  * 2008\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2007\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n## Feed\n\nFollow\n\nGive us feedback in our Product Forums.\n\n  * Google\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n\nDiese Website verwendet Cookies von Google, um Dienste anzubieten und Zugriffe\nzu analysieren.
