Sign in\n\nYou are logged in\n\nSwitch accounts\n\nThe supertalls, defined as being more than 300 metres tall by global non-\nprofit Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), have divided\nhousing observers. Proponents argue the vertical behemoths will add much\nneeded housing as the city faces a severe affordability crisis, while critics\nsay supertalls are impractical, luxury housing with units too pricey for the\naverage buyer and will likely serve as investment vehicles for the world\u2019s\nwealthiest.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\u201cThe supertall, because it\u2019s so iconic, so large and so present, really\nbecomes a lightning rod for debate about, first of all, that question of\naffordability, but also generally what kind of city Toronto should be,\u201d said\nPeter Sealy, assistant professor of architecture at the University of Toronto.\n\n## Rising giants\n\nRecently, the city gave the green light for the construction of a 99-storey\ntower at 19 Bloor St. W., just steps away from The One, the troubled and\ncontroversial condo project approved for 85 storeys.\n\nThose two condos are among seven approved supertall developments, including\nForma West Tower, by renowned Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, on King\nStreet West (84 storeys), Union Park East Tower on Front Street West (58\nstoreys), Sky Tower (105 storeys) and One Yonge Phase Three (92 storeys), both\nnear Yonge Street and Queens Quay, and 191 Bay Street near King Street (64\nstoreys).\n\nIf all proposed projects are completed, Toronto will have the fifth highest\nnumber of mixed-use residential supertalls in the world, alongside heavy\nhitters like New York City and Hong Kong, according to Isaac Work, building\ndata co-ordinator at the CTBUH.\n\n\u201cBecause of the Greenbelt, the constraints on urban development and the rapid\ninflux of immigrants ... there\u2019s no place to build but up,\u201d said Work.\n\nThe supertalls would add 6,700 residential units to the city, he added, but\nthey won\u2019t necessarily be accessible to most Torontonians.\n\nAt least seven \u201csupertall\u201d skyscrapers are expected to rise in Toronto and\nforever alter the look of Canada\u2019s busiest downtown.\n\nStephen Velasco\n\nThe prices at Sky Tower, for example, range from $1.2 million to more than $3\nmillion for units of 780 to 1,650 square feet, according to Livabl, which\ntracks new home construction news and listings across North America. At The\nOne, units are priced from $3 million to a whopping $31 million, according to\nLivabl.\n\n\u201cBecause land is typically very expensive in the areas where supertalls make\nsense, it\u2019s tough for developers to justify building affordable housing,\u201d said\nStephen Velasco, creator of Future Model Toronto, a 3D visualization platform\nfor urban planners.\n\n\u201cDevelopers and landowners are seeking to maximize land use and value by\nupzoning existing properties and constructing taller buildings,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Toronto, most supertalls will be concentrated in highly coveted areas close\nto transit, including neighbourhoods on King, Yonge and Bloor streets.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe city and the province have also been incentivizing the construction of\ntaller buildings to increase density in Toronto\u2019s downtown core.\n\nOntario\u2019s recently introduced Bill 185, Cutting Red Tape to Build More Homes\nAct, which is making its way through Queen\u2019s Park, exempts condos near major\ntransit hubs from having parking requirements, other than bicycle spots. That\nmeans developers wouldn\u2019t need to build as many underground levels for\nparking, which could result in lower building costs.\n\n\u201cThe City of Toronto is also coming around to that idea,\u201d said Emelie Rowe,\nsales associate at commercial real estate services firm CBRE.\n\n\u201cThey are more willing to approve higher density, higher heights than they\nwere even a couple of years ago.\u201d\n\n19 Bloor West, seen in this elevated rendering, is part of a larger movement\nof supertalls popping up in the city. It\u2019s one of seven approved developments,\nof which two \u2013 SkyTower and The One \u2013 are under construction.\n\nStephen Velasco\n\n## Serving a flourishing market\n\nMeanwhile, there is growing concern that supertalls might not make comfortable\nhomes.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nResidents at the top of 432 Park Avenue, a luxury skyscraper on Billionaires\u2019\nRow in Manhattan, have reported issues with plumbing and wind sways that make\nthe walls \u201ccreak like the galley of a ship,\u201d the New York Times reported.\n\nElevator malfunctions and capacity are also potential problems. At 19 Bloor\nSt. W. the developer is projecting to build eight elevators for 1,290 units,\nor one elevator per 161 units.\n\n\u201cEven buildings that have a higher ratio than that have issues with long wait\ntimes,\u201d said Velasco. \u201cSo that\u2019s, I think, a serious concern that needs to be\naddressed.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s perhaps what makes supertalls a luxurious commodity: something nice to\nlook at despite low functionality. But advocates defending them say they won\u2019t\nworsen, and might even help, the housing crisis by serving Toronto\u2019s\nflourishing luxury real estate market.\n\n\u201cPeople will say \u2018how can a $2-million condo help the person that\u2019s waiting\nfor an apartment that is $1,500 a month?\u2019\u201d said Mike Czestochowski, vice-chair\nof CBRE. \u201cThe more we build, the more it\u2019s going to free up units at a more\naffordable level.\u201d\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nInstead of buying up large swaths of smaller residential units they don\u2019t\nintend to live in and becoming \u201ccorporate landlords,\u201d sophisticated real\nestate investors could park their money in supertalls, Work explained.\n\n\u201cGiving a dedicated place in the market for the luxury buyer is a good way to\nfree up middle-class housing,\u201d he added.\n\nBut critics worry that increased investment in supertalls will feed into the\naffordability crisis and increase inequality by creating a mismatch between\nshelter costs and incomes.\n\n\u201cThese supertalls essentially convert housing and buildings into financial\nassets,\u201d said U of T\u2019s Sealy. \u201cAnd this \u2018financialization\u2019 leads to massively\nrising prices and actually makes housing much less affordable.\u201d\n\n## Toronto as a \u2018global metropolis\u2019\n\nWhat most seem to agree on is that the supertall trend is here to stay, given\nthe demand for housing and especially as developers expect relief from\ninterest rate cuts forecasted to begin this year.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe broader question that remains is whether Torontonians can accept the\nreality and the growing pains of the city itself transforming into a\nmetropolitan giant.\n\nMany Torontonians seem to be stuck in North American ideals around\nsuburbanization and the love for backyards, Sealy said.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely struggling with the fact that, in many ways, Toronto has\nbecome a global metropolis,\u201d adding that we should start looking to cities\nlike Seoul, Hong Kong and London for examples of urban development as Toronto\ncompetes in the global arena.\n\nAna Pereira is a Toronto-based general assignment reporter for the Star.
