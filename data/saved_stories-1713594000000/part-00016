The two agencies kept watch on a\nSoviet intelligence officer, Arthur Adams, who was living illegally in the\nUnited States and serving as Hiskey\u2019s control officer. Despite an extensive\ninvestigation, neither Hiskey nor Adams was ever arrested. Although Adams was\nnamed in a sensational tabloid newspaper article shortly after the end of\nWorld War II and closely shadowed by the FBI, he was able to flee to the\nSoviet Union. Hiskey was never indicted for espionage. Based on material\nreleased from declassified Russian archives and FBI files made available under\nthe Freedom of Information Act, the following article tells the story of the\nfirst U.S.-based nuclear spy and how he got away with it.\n\nIn U.S. popular imagination, Julius Rosenberg and Ethel Rosenberg are usually\nseen as the most important Soviet nuclear spies. Historians would give that\ndubious honor to Klaus Fuchs or Theodore Hall. The Rosenbergs and Fuchs were\narrested in the early 1950s and convicted of turning over important\ninformation about the Manhattan Project to Soviet intelligence agencies. Hall\nadmitted his actions after the Venona decryptions identifying him as a Soviet\nspy were declassified and made public in 1995. But years before any of their\nnames were public, the U.S. government had discovered another Soviet nuclear\nspy and removed him from any classified work. His Soviet controller was put\nunder intense surveillance, their machinations were publicly exposed by a\ntabloid reporter, and congressional hearings gave the U.S. public a glimpse of\nSoviet efforts to infiltrate the most secret wartime program in the United\nStates. But no one was ever arrested or tried in court. The first government\nattempt to hold nuclear spies responsible for their actions collapsed several\nyears before the Rosenbergs became the only U.S. citizens to be executed for\nhelping the USSR build its own nuclear bomb.\n\nThis article first appeared in the Fall 2023 issue of the Journal of Cold War\nStudies\n\nThe saga of Clarence Hiskey, a chemist employed by the Manhattan Project, and\nArthur Adams, a Soviet military intelligence officer illegally in the United\nStates, has largely fallen down a memory hole. U.S. Army security officials,\nthe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the U.S. Department of\nJustice were concerned that arrests would publicize the Manhattan Project\nbefore the nuclear bomb was used in combat. They were also leery of disrupting\nrelations with a wartime ally (the USSR) and of mounting a successful\nprosecution based on covert break-ins and warrantless searches.^1\n\nOnce an anti-Communist reporter for the New York Journal-American broke the\nstory in 1945, shortly after the United States had dropped two bombs on Japan,\nhis combination of factual material and falsehoods ricocheted around the\npublic square, distorting any understanding of what had actually happened.\nWhen Hiskey relied on the Fifth Amendment to refuse to testify or answer FBI\nquestions and Adams escaped to the Soviet Union, the case collapsed. After\n1991, Russian intelligence agencies continued to follow the Soviet practice of\nnot naming sources who never admitted their spying, and thus even the release\nof archival records in recent decades has left Adams and Hiskey in obscurity.\n\n> The FBI\u2019s reliance on illegal eavesdropping and break-ins thwarted any\n> attempt to bring Hiskey to trial for espionage.\n\nNonetheless, enough information is now available to tell the story of the\nfirst Soviet nuclear spy and the man who recruited him and then successfully\nevaded the FBI. Some aspects of their actions remain obscure, and the precise\nnature of the information Hiskey passed to the Soviet Union is unclear, but a\ngreat deal of evidence has emerged in recent years about his role as an\nimportant spy.\n\nHiskey was an unlikely candidate for a top-secret government project. Born in\n1912 as Clarence Szczechowski in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Polish Catholic\nparents, he had attended La Crosse Teachers\u2019 College before receiving an\nundergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1935 and a Ph.D. in\nchemistry in 1939. Both he and his wife, Marcia Sand Hiskey, were active in\nCommunist organizations on campus. He first came to the attention of the FBI\nin 1941 in connection with Communist activities at the University of\nTennessee, where he was then employed. A former teacher, upon learning that\nHiskey was about to be hired by the Tennessee Valley Authority, contacted the\nFBI to report that, although Hiskey was a brilliant chemist, he was a\nCommunist. A cursory investigation established that Hiskey was widely disliked\nby his colleagues at Tennessee. One recalled that he was \u201cdespicable to\ninferiors and always trying to impress superiors.\u201d Another said he had a\n\u201cdisgusting personality with a know-it-all attitude.\u201d Later hired at Columbia\nUniversity to work with Harold Urey, a Nobel Prize\u2013winning chemist, Hiskey\nexperienced a setback in his teaching career when a classroom experiment\ninvolving sulfuric acid went awry and caused an explosion.\n\nRelatedLessons From Operation \"Denver,\" the KGB\u2019s Massive AIDS Disinformation\nCampaign\n\nArmy Counter-Intelligence personnel interviewed former professors who\ndescribed Hiskey as \u201can out-and-out Red\u201d and outspokenly pro-Soviet and anti-\ncapitalist, but he was still brought to work at the Substitute Alloy Materials\nLaboratory at Columbia University to take part in sensitive research. At least\nonce, Urey had to caution him to stop discussing his work with unauthorized\nemployees.\n\nUnbeknownst to U.S. investigators, Hiskey was already discussing his\nclassified work with Communist friends connected to Soviet intelligence. In\nMarch 1942 he had dinner at his New York apartment with an old comrade from\nthe University of Wisconsin, Zalmond Franklin. Franklin had fought in Spain\nwith the Communist International Brigades and had been recruited to work as a\ncourier by Soviet foreign intelligence officials after his return to the\nUnited States. Accompanying him to the subway after dinner, Hiskey swore\nFranklin to secrecy and then told him that he was working on a powerful\nradioactive bomb. When Franklin said he certainly hoped that Soviet officials\nknew about this weapon, Hiskey responded that he \u201choped so too.\u201d\n\nWhen Franklin\u2019s report reached Moscow, it stimulated a sustained but futile\neffort to recruit Hiskey, complicated by his transfer to Chicago to work at\nthe Manhattan Project\u2019s Metallurgical Laboratory. Ultimately, the recruitment\neffort failed because, even before his conversation with Franklin, Hiskey was\nalready working for another Soviet intelligence agency, the Main Intelligence\nDirectorate (GRU) of the Red Army\u2019s General Staff.^2\n\nHiskey\u2019s GRU contact was Arthur Adams. Several years after being abruptly but\nquietly removed from the Manhattan Project, Hiskey admitted to the FBI that he\nhad met Adams in the fall of 1941 at a record shop in New York City owned by\nEric Bernay. He insisted that the relationship was entirely innocent, claiming\nthat the two had bonded over a shared enthusiasm for left-wing music, such as\nSpanish Civil War and labor songs. The friendship continued in Chicago, where\nthey supposedly discussed plastics, including Hiskey\u2019s idea of manufacturing a\nseamless ping-pong ball and Adams\u2019s career in the Soviet Union. Hiskey\nadamantly denied that Adams ever asked him about his work. Both were lying.\n\nAdams was an important Soviet spy-runner whose long career included several\nstints in the United States. He lived in several states both legally and\nillegally, with gainful employment and contrived jobs, as an official of the\nSoviet government and as an ostensible technical consultant to several U.S.\ncompanies. At times his activities were closely monitored by the FBI, but more\noften he operated totally under its radar.\n\nSeveral of his U.S. acquaintances had long-standing ties to Soviet\nintelligence agencies, but the FBI was never able to develop enough evidence\nto initiate legal prosecutions against any of them. None of the people with\nwhom he had contact were ever successfully prosecuted, even though the FBI\nfound notes on the nuclear bomb during an illegal search of Adams\u2019s hotel room\nin New York City. He was surveilled for several years by the FBI, but he still\nmanaged to flee the country after eluding its agents.\n\nThe story of Adams\u2019s connections to Hiskey was a media sensation years before\nKlaus Fuchs and Julius Rosenberg became household names. Well before several\nSoviet agents connected to the Rosenbergs eluded the FBI, Adams managed to\nflee the United States and return to the Soviet Union. He was the first Soviet\nintelligence officer linked to nuclear espionage and the one about whom the\nleast is known. To this day, his background remains a muddle, with conflicting\naccounts of his personal history and activities.\n\nArmy security officials had belatedly begun to worry that Hiskey was a\nsecurity risk in 1944, after receiving a tip that he was a Communist.\nInvestigators observed him meeting with a man they later identified as Adams.\nAn illegal entry into Adams\u2019s New York hotel room turned up books on atomic\ntheory and notes indicating that Adams seemed to have knowledge about the\nManhattan Project. Concluding that Hiskey was indeed a security risk, the Army\nsent him a notice that he was being called to active duty (he held a reserve\ncommission).\n\nThe day after receiving his call-up, Hiskey met Adams in Chicago and flew to\nCleveland after Adams made an airplane reservation for him. During the flight,\nhe engaged in a remarkable conversation with his seat mate, an undercover Army\ninvestigator, to whom he declared that capitalism needed to be abolished, that\nthe maldistribution of wealth must be ended, and that \u201csome people will lose\ntheir heads to accomplish it.\u201d He spoke warmly about the Soviet Communist\nsystem. Once in Ohio, Hiskey met with John Hitchcock Chapin, another chemist\nworking on the Manhattan Project and arranged for him to meet with Adams in\nthe future.\n\nJust a few days later, Hiskey left for his new assignment, a military base in\nCanada near the Arctic Circle. (The Army later sent him to Hawaii, where he\nworked on flame-throwing devices.) During the trip, yet another Army\ninvestigator obtained access to his luggage and found a notebook with seven\npages of top-secret written material, \u201ca concise and comprehensive outline of\nthe DSM Project [initial cover name for the Manhattan Project].\u201d The Army\nquietly confiscated his luggage, and Hiskey never reported the loss. He wrote\nto his girlfriend and future wife that, unfortunately, he had been unable to\nmeet as planned with someone in Nome, Alaska, but \u201cthings happened which\ncaused him to change his plans,\u201d a hint suggesting to the investigators that\nhe had hoped to rendezvous with another Soviet agent.^3\n\nHaving concluded that Hiskey could be prosecuted or court-martialed for\nunauthorized possession of classified information (when he left the\nMetallurgical Laboratory, Hiskey had been instructed to turn in all notes\nrelated to the project), the Army was nevertheless reluctant to pursue legal\ncharges for fear of calling attention to the still top-secret Manhattan\nProject. Satisfied that Hiskey had been neutralized and isolated in the wilds\nof Canada, Army security decided to turn the investigation of Adams over to\nthe FBI, which put him under surveillance in late August 1944.\n\nArthur Adams\u2019s official NKVD photograph (1948).\n\nAdams, like most Soviet officers, was far from the Hollywood version of a\nsecret agent. About 5 feet, 7 inches tall, weighing 150 pounds, with dark\nbrown eyes, he wore bifocal glasses and was allegedly blind in one eye. His\nhair was brown, and he was bald on top. Adams wore orthopedic shoes with\nbuilt-up arches and had an extractable upper plate. He suffered from chronic\nrespiratory illnesses. He dressed conservatively, usually wearing a dark\nbusiness suit.\n\nAdams had entered the United States from Canada in 1938, falsely swearing that\nhe had never been in the United States before and was planning to open a\nbusiness. Three days before he arrived in New York, two businessmen, Philip\nLevy and Jacob Aronoff, opened a bank account for the newly created\nTechnological Laboratories, a company that was to specialize in tool design,\nwith Adams listed as treasurer. Adams later claimed Technological Laboratories\nemployed him through 1943, but, when it was dissolved, a note in its corporate\nfile indicated that it had apparently never done any business, had no\ninventory, and had never reported any income.\n\nAs the FBI dug into Adams\u2019s life, it concluded that he was an \u201cillegal,\u201d that\nis, a Soviet citizen infiltrated into the United States, operating without\ndiplomatic cover, to direct a group of spies. In 1936 Arthur Ranto, claiming\nto be Adams\u2019s uncle, had gone before a notary public in Canada and sworn that\nAdams had been born on 4 May 1890 in Toronto. Thanks to Ranto\u2019s testimony,\nAdams received a birth certificate and Canadian citizenship. But the Royal\nCanadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was never able to locate Ranto later or find\nany records of Adams\u2019s alleged parents. The notary public turned out to be a\nsecret member of the Canadian Communist Party. The records from the town where\nAdams claimed to have lived from 1909 to 1919 had been destroyed in a fire.\n\n> Adams told the local postmaster that he had lost two sons during the war,\n> and he then broke down and sobbed. In fact, he had no children.\n\nAdams told a variety of stories about his birthplace, parents, upbringing,\neducation, and travels. Friends, acquaintances, and business contacts whom the\nFBI interviewed from 1944 to 1950 offered differing accounts. Adams was\nsparing with details. According to one relative of his second wife, he would\nnever tell \u201chow long he would be in a place or anything else.\u201d He was also\n\u201cvery cold and unemotional.\u201d He was also a good actor. In 1945, vacationing at\na lake in New York State, he told the local postmaster that he had lost two\nsons during the war, and he then broke down and sobbed. In fact, he had no\nchildren. He had abandoned both his first wife and her son (his stepson) and\nhad no contact with them after 1922.\n\nAs best the FBI could learn, Adams was actually born in Eskiltuna, Sweden, on\nOctober 25^th, 1885 to Alexander Adams and Regina Ranto, supposedly an\nAmerican father (although Adams also later claimed on one visa application\nthat his father was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and in another that he was of\nthe \u201cScottish-Finnish race\u201d) and Russian (or Scottish) mother, although no\nrecords of his birth could be located. One informant claimed Adams\u2019s father\nwas Swedish and his mother a Russian Jew. In one version of his life story,\nAdams wrote that he graduated from a naval engineering school in Kronstadt in\n1909. A recent Russian account of his background has him brought up in a small\nvillage in Russia after his parents died, becoming a revolutionary in 1904,\nand going into exile after the 1905 Revolution.\n\nAdams entered the United States around 1910 and worked as a tool and die maker\nin New York in 1917 and 1918. An acquaintance from that time recalled that he\n\u201cspoke good English\u201d and was thoroughly Americanized. A member of the American\nSocialist Party, he was appointed head of the technical department of the\nMartens Mission, the unofficial representative of the new Soviet government to\nthe United States in June 1919. Along with most of the other members of the\nMartens Mission, Adams returned to the USSR in January 1921 when threatened\nwith deportation.\n\nFor the next seven years, Adams lived in the USSR. According to his own\naccount, he variously served as a production engineer and director for the 1st\nState Auto Works in Moscow, as chief engineer of an aircraft engine department\nin Leningrad, and as a member of the board of directors of the National\nAircraft Industries in Moscow.\n\nAdams returned to the United States in November 1928 for three months as head\nof a Soviet trade mission attached to Amtorg, the Soviet purchasing company,\nto buy machinery and plans for the construction of a plant in the Soviet Union\nto make gas masks. In December 1932, he returned for 10 months as part of a\ndelegation to study and purchase a certain kind of airplane motor at the\nCurtiss-Wright airplane factory in Paterson, New Jersey. Official delegation\ndocuments listed Adams as being in charge of tool design and equipment and\nindicated he was a Soviet citizen.\n\nAdams was once again in the United States in late 1936 and early 1937,\nostensibly to visit relatives of his second wife, Dorothy. Born in Boston in\n1898, she had also worked for the Martens Mission and moved to Moscow, where\nshe had worked as a stenographer for high-ranking Soviet officials and as an\nassistant for the Moscow correspondent of The New York Times. She returned to\nthe Soviet Union in June 1937, but there is no record of when Adams departed.\nThe FBI later speculated that he went to Canada, given that September 1936 was\nwhen he showed up in Toronto and falsely claimed Canadian citizenship.\n\nAs the FBI dug into Adams\u2019s murky background in 1944 \u2014 he had been entirely\noff its radar until then \u2014 it also undertook close surveillance of his\nmovements. But by that point it was too late. A Russian collection of messages\non Soviet nuclear espionage, published in 2000, reproduces a letter from\nAdams, then code-named \u201cAchilles,\u201d to the head of the GRU. Adams had delivered\nit to Pavel Mikhailov, the acting Soviet consul in New York and the GRU\nstation chief (rezident) in the United States, who presumably shipped it to\nMoscow via diplomatic courier. Received in Moscow on June 13^th, 1944, the\nletter reported that the United States was working on a bomb using uranium and\nplutonium (something Soviet officials already knew), headed by six world-\nfamous physicists, including Enrico Fermi and J. Robert Oppenheimer, employing\nthousands of engineers and technicians, and using three methods of plutonium\nproduction at plants in New Mexico and Mississippi (an error). His source was\n\u201ca highly qualified specialist.\u201d In addition to sending some 1,000 pages of\nfilm, Adams included samples of uranium and beryllium. In August, the head of\nthe GRU, General Ivan Il\u2019ichev, sent another 3,869 pages of material received\nfrom Adams to Mikhail Pervukhin, one of the main figures overseeing\ndevelopment of the Soviet nuclear bomb.^4\n\nIn late September 1944, FBI agents observed Adams meeting with John Hitchcock\nChapin, the Manhattan Project chemist Hiskey had flown to Cleveland to see.\nThey saw something pass between the two men (Chapin later told the FBI it was\na key he had given Hiskey as an identifying device). In early October, after\nAdams had returned to New York, the FBI did a black bag job (gaining\nsurreptitious entry) in Adams\u2019s room at the Peter Cooper Hotel. In a locked\nbriefcase in a locked closet, agents found a sheet of paper with notes\ncontaining references to the secret K-25 uranium separation plant at Oak Ridge\nand \u201cthe progress of the experimentation and sources of raw materials\u201d used in\nthe nuclear bomb.\n\nA month later Adams left Aronoff\u2019s New York apartment carrying a heavy\nsuitcase. About 10 PM he entered a car registered to Mikhailov, and the\nluggage was placed in the trunk. Adams had delivered the final cache of\nmaterials he had collected on the nuclear bomb.\n\nA bevy of Adams\u2019s associates and contacts were also closely monitored. Not\nonly Levy and Aronoff but Eric Bernay, one-time publisher of the Communist New\nMasses and owner of the left-wing music business where he had initially met\nHiskey; Samuel Novick, a wealthy businessman who had tried to facilitate\nAdams\u2019s initial efforts to emigrate from Canada in 1937; Julius Heiman, a\nlong-time conduit for the Soviet jewels that financed the American Communist\nmovement; Irving Lerner, a documentary filmmaker suspected of trying to take\nunauthorized photographs of the Radiation Laboratory at the University of\nCalifornia; and Victoria Stone, Adams\u2019s mistress and owner of a jewelry store\nin Manhattan \u2014 all were suspected of being part of his apparatus. Most had\nCommunist backgrounds and connections to Soviet intelligence operations.^5\n\nBy January 1945, Adams had become aware of the FBI surveillance, evidently\nalerted by the break-in at his hotel room. Detecting signs that he was\npreparing to leave the country, the FBI consulted Manhattan Project security.\nThe Army did not want him to leave the United States because the bomb project\nwas still secret, but also did not want him prosecuted for espionage, for fear\nthat it \u201cwould bring the project out into the open.\u201d\n\nOn February 25^th, 1945, Adams vanished. He had last been seen at 1:30 AM\nleaving Victoria Stone\u2019s apartment. Appearing to be waiting for a bus, he\nsuddenly jumped into a taxi, and the FBI agent who was trailing him was left\nstranded when his official car was delayed in arriving. Agents across the\ncountry were alerted to be on the lookout for Adams. Train stations and\nairports were checked, and border offices were instructed to stop him. Worried\nthat he might be en route to the USSR (he had recently purchased a fur coat,\ncollar, and hat), the FBI ordered coverage of all airfields in Alaska used by\nSoviet aircraft. He was, however, soon spotted on a train to Chicago and,\ntrailed by FBI agents, followed to Portland, Oregon, where, once again\nconcluding that he had been discovered, Adams purchased a ticket to return to\nNew York.\n\nTo preclude having to arrest him for espionage, the FBI had filed a sealed\ncomplaint charging Adams with violating the Alien Registration laws and making\nfalse statements on his Selective Service registration. He was not to be\narrested, however, unless he actually tried to leave the country. The charges\nwere thin gruel. Because Adams was 55 years old, the Selective Service charge\nwas unlikely to persuade a jury. Likewise, the Justice Department worried that\nthe immigration charge might run afoul of the statute of limitations. Still,\nFBI headquarters instructed field agents that under no circumstances should\nAdams be permitted to board a Soviet vessel of any description, nor should he\nbe permitted to board a Soviet plane. In event such is attempted he should be\ntaken into custody immediately and given a strip search. His luggage should\nlikewise be carefully searched with due regard for rules of evidence.\n\nThe spring passed uneventfully. Adams, aware he was being watched, stuck to a\nboring and predictable routine. But after nuclear bombs were dropped on\nHiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945, the FBI began to press for action\nagainst Adams. The Justice Department showed no sense of urgency, and, before\nit could decide what to do, its hand was forced. On December 3^rd, 1945,\nHoward Rushmore, a reporter for the New York Journal-American, called two\nhigh-ranking FBI officials to tell them that a breaking story on Adams was\nabout to hit the newsstands.\n\nWith the headline \u201cReds Seek Jet Secrets, Spies Bribe US Engineers, FBI Keeps\nWatch on Atom Agent,\u201d Rushmore\u2019s story published on December 4^th, 1945\nreported that a Soviet agent was \u201cliving under an assumed name at a midtown\nhotel.\u201d The paper thinly disguised Adams as Alfred Adamson, choosing to keep\nhis real name out of the story. It inaccurately asserted that the FBI had\ngiven the State Department \u201cirrefutable proof that Adamson had in his\npossession secret plans of the atomic bomb given him by an American scientist\nin Chicago in 1943.\u201d The FBI believed \u201cAdamson passed on atomic bomb\ninformation to a Soviet vice-consul a year ago.\u201d Interviewed by a reporter \u201cat\nan obscure communist musical shop [Bernay\u2019s music store] where he is\nemployed,\u201d Adamson, \u201cvisibly nervous,\u201d \u201cdenied being a Moscow agent.\u201d\n\n> Neither the FBI nor Army investigators ever determined exactly how much\n> nuclear information Hiskey passed to Adams.\n\nRushmore, a one-time Communist expelled from the party for writing a favorable\nreview in the Daily Worker of \u201cGone with the Wind,\u201d flogged the Adams story\nfor the next four years, offering a mix of truth spiced with innuendo and wild\nfantasies. His major source was a disgruntled former FBI special agent, Larry\nKerley. An enraged J. Edgar Hoover pushed for the Justice Department to indict\nKerley but, by testifying before a House committee, Kerley ensured that any\nattempt to prosecute him would appear to be an act of petty vindictiveness.\n\nRushmore\u2019s stories kept the issue of nuclear espionage in the public\nconsciousness, sparking congressional demands for investigations and\nconsequences and intense speculation about how and why no arrests had taken\nplace. The clamor was given an additional dollop of mystery insofar as\nRushmore declined to name any of those under suspicion \u2014 except for his thinly\ndisguised Adams \u2014 for fear of a libel suit. Although reporters knew the\nidentities of everyone mentioned in the articles, the public was treated to\nstories about \u201cprominent scientists,\u201d \u201cwealthy businessmen,\u201d and \u201cwell-\nconnected lawyers.\u201d\n\nThe State Department issued truthful denials that it had anything to do with\nthe Adams case, and the FBI remained silent. Out of public view, however, FBI\nofficials conceded that \u201cwe have no evidence of espionage activity which can\nbe introduced in court.\u201d There was no proof that the material turned over to\nMikhailov, who left the country 10 days after the first Journal-American story\nappeared, was espionage-related, although it almost certainly was. The most\npertinent and damaging physical evidence \u2014 a list of questions dealing with\nthe nuclear bomb project \u2014 had been obtained through an illegal break-in and\ncould not be introduced into court. Chapin, the one conspirator who later\nwillingly talked to the FBI, had initially claimed that he had not been\ndirectly approached to commit espionage. Not until 1946 did he admit that\nAdams and Hiskey had solicited him to do so. By then, the outstanding\nindictments against Adams were unlikely to hold up in court.\n\nThe blanket surveillance around Adams clearly rattled him, and the FBI hoped\nhe might break down, confess, and ask for asylum. On January 12^th, 1946, he\nhad an impromptu and remarkable hour-and-a-half-long conversation with one\nsurveilling agent. Insisting he was a Canadian citizen who wanted to gain U.S.\ncitizenship, Adams denied ever living in the Soviet Union or knowing what the\nscientists he met in Chicago were working on. He appeared \u201cvery nervous and\nvery emotional.\u201d At one point he was \u201cso despondent\u201d that the agent asked\nwhether he had any friends. Adams teared up, saying he had only \u201cthat little\ngirl you probably know about,\u201d referring to Stone. He seemed \u201cextremely\nanxious to talk to someone about his troubles.\u201d The FBI was puzzled by this\nuncharacteristic behavior and speculated that Adams, knowing that Mikhailov,\nhis GRU superior, had been recalled to Moscow, also feared a recall and was\nsignaling a desire to speak to the FBI. Hoover authorized an interview with\nhim. Approval for the interview came on January 23^rd, 1946, the same day that\nAdams vanished again.\n\nAn all-out search failed to turn up any trace of Adams. For months the FBI\npursued leads and interviewed his contacts, to no avail. Rushmore broke the\nstory of his flight on February 16^th, 1946 with a front-page story, \u201cAtom Spy\nEludes FBI as Canada Nabs 22,\u201d referring to the arrests of Canadians\nimplicated by Soviet defector Igor Gouzenko, who had been a GRU code clerk.\nBecause one of those arrested in Canada had the surname Adams, initial reports\nerroneously stated that Adams had been picked up by the RCMP.\n\nIn October 1946, the Justice Department again concluded that the evidence\nagainst Hiskey and Chapin was too thin to warrant an indictment. Even so, the\nclamor around the case continued. Rushmore wrote in the anti-Communist Plain\nTalk in January 1948 that at least seven unnamed members of Adams\u2019s ring, \u201cthe\nmost dangerous spy ring in the history of the United States,\u201d whose members\nhad helped \u201cStalin\u2019s ace agent attempt to steal the secret of our atom bomb,\u201d\nwere going about their daily lives, \u201cunmolested in the daily pursuit of\nliberty and happiness.\u201d^6\n\nThe political pressure and growing anger prompted the House Committee on Un-\nAmerican Activities (HUAC) to hold hearings on nuclear espionage in 1948\nduring which Kerley testified in executive session that Adams had been allowed\nto escape by the Truman administration. Rushmore promptly wrote about Kerley\u2019s\nsecret testimony. Hiskey and Chapin testified in public, as did most of\nAdams\u2019s other American contacts. For the first time, Hiskey\u2019s name became\npublic. He took the Fifth Amendment in response to most questions. Chapin\nswore that Hiskey and Adams had pressed him to provide nuclear information but\nthat he had refused. In a report issued in October 1948, HUAC recommended that\nHiskey, his former wife Marcia, Chapin, and Adams all be prosecuted for\nconspiracy to commit espionage.^7\n\nOn October 28^th, 1948, Moscow Center sent an encrypted message to a high-\nranking Soviet foreign intelligence officer in New York complaining that, even\nas the U.S. government had embarked on an extensive program to improve its\nnuclear capabilities, Soviet intelligence efforts had been \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d\nSources who had provided vital information during World War II \u2014 \u201cMlad,\u201d\n\u201cCaliber,\u201d and \u201cGodsend\u201d \u2014 no longer worked at Los Alamos, and the identity of\nanother spy, \u201cKemp,\u201d had been \u201ccompletely revealed,\u201d making him useless.^8\n\nThis message was never decrypted and read by U.S. counterintelligence. It was\nfirst disclosed in 2009 when the Vassiliev Notebooks (transcriptions of Soviet\nforeign intelligence documents compiled by Alexander Vassiliev) became\navailable. Whereas Mlad (Theodore Hall), Caliber (David Greenglass), and\nGodsend (Oscar Seborer) had been publicly identified as Soviet spies in the\n1990s, the spy with the cover name \u201cKemp\u201d had not yet been identified. He was\nlauded in a book published in 2002 in Russia by Vladimir Lota, who credited\nKemp with providing a small container of heavy water and samples of uranium\nand beryllium, along with thousands of pages of documents from the Manhattan\nProject to Adams, beginning in 1944. Lota identified \u201cKemp\u201d as Martin Kemp, a\nU.S. scientist never previously identified as a Soviet source. Lota claimed\nthat when Kemp failed to show up for a meeting in September 1944, Adams\nlearned he was seriously ill in a hospital and possibly dying. Saying nothing\nfurther about \u201cKemp,\u201d Lota implies by omission that after September 1944 he\nwas dead or no longer involved in the Manhattan Project.\n\nLota, the nom de plume of retired GRU Colonel Vladimir Ivanovich Boiko, never\nanticipated that the October 1948 message admitting that \u201cKemp\u201d had been\nexposed would ever surface. Like most books written by former Soviet\nintelligence officers with the approval of their agencies, Lota\u2019s account\nmixes accurate information with a great deal of disinformation. The only\nnuclear spy who had dealt extensively with Adams until he was \u201cexposed\u201d in the\nfall of 1944 was Hiskey.^9\n\nIn late 1949, after the Soviet test of a nuclear bomb, the Justice Department\nthought about bringing the case to a federal grand jury, but the FBI was\nreluctant. For several years, the Justice Department remained interested in\nfiling indictments, but the FBI was still unenthusiastic. Adams was in the\nUSSR. All the principal figures in his ring had either refused to cooperate or\ndenied any knowledge of Adams\u2019s activities. Chapin\u2019s story alone was\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction. He had no evidence but his own\nrecollection, which had changed over time. Although the FBI did not doubt that\nAdams had been managing Soviet spies since the early 1940s, or that he had\nsolicited the assistance of several people and obtained nuclear information\nfrom Hiskey and Chapin, legally admissible evidence to support those charges\nwas thin. Files released by the FBI give no indication that either Hiskey or\nChapin was ever observed passing material to Adams. The FBI had never even\nseen Hiskey and Adams together because that part of the investigation had been\nconducted by the Army. Material produced during the grand jury proceedings was\neither classified or based on problematic investigative techniques such as\nillegal searches. No indictments were issued.^10\n\nThe FBI learned in 1948 from Anna Louise Strong, a prominent pro-Soviet U.S.\njournalist expelled from the USSR in 1949 on false charges of being a U.S.\nspy, that Adams was in the Soviet Union. In 1956 a high-level FBI informant in\nthe Communist Party USA reported that Tim Buck, the leader of the Canadian\nCommunist Party, told him that he had recently met with Adams in Moscow. Adams\nhad told Buck a remarkable story of escaping from the United States by\nclimbing through windows, smuggling himself aboard a ship bound for Europe,\nsneaking into Yugoslavia, and flying to Moscow on a plane provided by the\nYugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. After a lengthy investigation, the FBI\nconcluded that Buck had indeed met with Adams, but that the account of his\nescape was hogwash. The FBI never learned how Adams eluded surveillance and\nfled the country.\n\nAccording to information on a Russian website, Adams worked from 1946 to 1948\nfor the GRU General Staff but was dismissed in 1948 as the purge of \u201crootless\ncosmopolitans\u201d (Stalin\u2019s derogatory term for Jews) gathered steam. For many\nyears, according to the website, he worked as a political writer for the TASS\nnews agency. He died on January 14^th, 1969. In 1999 Boris Yeltsin\nposthumously awarded him the title of Hero of the Russian Federation \u201cfor\ncourage and heroism shown during the performance of special assignments.\u201d\n\nHiskey was called before several congressional committees over the years but\npersistently pleaded the Fifth Amendment. He had obtained a teaching job at\nBrooklyn Polytechnic Institute before his name became public. The president of\nthe institute was an anti-Communist, but he rebuffed demands that Hiskey be\nfired, insisting that only if Hiskey were found guilty would he be let go.\nAlthough Hiskey was suspended after being indicted for contempt of Congress,\nhe was reinstated after being acquitted. Nevertheless, he was never promoted,\nand in 1952 he finally resigned to become an industrial consultant. He later\nworked for a chemical company and as director of analytical research for Endo\nLaboratories. He died in 1998.^11\n\nNone of those investigated for ties to Adams ever faced prosecution, although\none, Samuel Novick, a wealthy businessman, moved to Mexico in 1951 and\nremained there for the rest of his life. Hiskey\u2019s most notorious acquaintance\nturned out to be his son, Nicholas Sand, also a chemist. Sand made headlines\nin the 1960s not for espionage but for producing the purest commercial version\nof the psychedelic drug LSD, labeled \u201cOrange Sunshine.\u201d Convicted of drug\ntrafficking and sentenced to 15 years in prison, Sand jumped bail while his\ncase was being appealed and fled to Canada, where he lived under an alias for\ntwo decades while producing psilocybin mushrooms and LSD. Arrested by the RCMP\nwith enough LSD \u201cto dose the whole of Canada two times over,\u201d he was\nimprisoned and eventually deported to the United States. Released from prison\nin 2001, he remained an unrepentant drug producer until his death in 2017,\nboasting that he had manufactured enough LSD for nearly 140 million doses.\n\nNeither the FBI nor Army investigators ever determined exactly how much\nnuclear information Hiskey passed to Adams, although Russian archival\ndocuments claim that, beginning in 1944, \u201cKemp\u201d gave Adams samples of nuclear\nmaterials and nearly 4,000 pages of documents. Hiskey apparently cooperated\nwith Adams beginning in 1941, but exactly what information he provided remains\nunknown. Because Hiskey went to his grave denying he had been a spy, the GRU\nnever credited him. The Soviet practice \u2014 still observed by the intelligence\nservices in post-Soviet Russia \u2014 was not to reveal the names of spies who had\nnot admitted their activities. Hiskey was one of only two chemists employed by\nthe Manhattan Project who turned over nuclear information to the USSR. Fuchs\nand Hall were physicists, Greenglass a machinist, and Seborer an engineer.\nGeorge Koval was a chemist, but his information was mostly about polonium\ninitiators and plutonium production. The classified information provided by\nHiskey relating to other chemicals may well have been unique.\n\nOther Russian sources are far from reliable. One website asserts that Hiskey\ntold Adams that his friend \u201cKemp\u201d had access to classified material and that\nhe photographed what Kemp gave him. But the site also erroneously says that\nAdams sent more than 5,000 pages of material and samples of plutonium from Los\nAlamos to Moscow \u2014 at times when Hiskey was in Canada, Adams was under\nsuffocating surveillance, and no one fitting Kemp\u2019s description was at Los\nAlamos.\n\nThe FBI obtained records indicating that Adams stayed at the LaSalle Hotel in\nChicago at least eight times from December 1942 to September 1943. Hiskey was\nnot assigned to the Metallurgical Laboratory until October 1943, so it is\npossible that Adams was meeting with someone else connected with the Manhattan\nProject during this period, perhaps someone suggested by Hiskey. Thus, some of\nthe material Adams sent to Moscow in 1944 might have come from someone other\nthan Hiskey. The 1948 Soviet cable about the source\u2019s public exposure leaves\nlittle doubt that \u201cKemp\u201d was a GRU code name for Hiskey, the only nuclear spy\nwho had been exposed by 1948, and that some of the claims in Lota\u2019s book were\nnothing more than disinformation.^12\n\nClarence Hiskey, lionized as late as 1986 as an innocent victim of government\nintimidation in a book on the ravages of McCarthyism, paid a small price for\nturning over a significant amount of top-secret information to Adams, a\nveteran Soviet intelligence agent who enlisted numerous prominent, well-\nconnected businessmen to assist him in purloining information. Although the\ndamage Adams and his enablers did to U.S. security was likely not as bad as\nthat done by Fuchs and Hall, it no doubt contributed to the ability of the\nUSSR to build and test a nuclear bomb years before U.S. counterintelligence\nexpected it.^13\n\nHarvey Klehr is a professor of politics and history at Emory University.\n\nJohn Earl Haynes is senior historian emeritus in the Manuscript Division of\nthe U.S. Library of Congress.\n\nKlehr and Haynes are co-authors of \u201cThe Secret World of American Communism\u201d\nand \u201cVenona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America,\u201d both published by Yale\nUniversity Press. This article first appeared in the Fall 2023 issue of the\nJournal of Cold War Studies.\n\n  1. Scholars have not entirely neglected the Hiskey case. We discussed Hiskey and Adams briefly in John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America (New Haven: Yale University Press), 1999, pp. 322\u2013335; and in more detail in John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev, Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 75\u201383. Our discussion here expands considerably beyond those publications, using released FBI files. Hiskey and Adams have also been discussed by Katherine A. S. Sibley, Red Spies in America: Stolen Secrets and the Dawn of the Cold War (Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas, 2004), pp. 157\u2013162; Anne Hagedorn, Sleeper Agent: The Atomic Spy in America Who Got Away (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2021), pp. 69\u201371, 73\u201375, 87\u201388, 131\u2013132, 154; Herbert Romerstein and Eric Breindel, The Venona Secrets: Exposing Soviet Espionage and America\u2019s Traitors (Washington, DC: Regnery, 2000), pp. 222\u2013223; and Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America\u2014The Stalin Era (New York: Random House, 2000), pp. 179\u2013183. All those discussions of the Hiskey case, however, are brief, treat it as part of a larger story, and are constrained by the lack of detail about how the case developed. They are also dwarfed by the many thousands of pages in hundreds of journalistic and scholarly articles and books about the Rosenberg, Fuchs, and Oppenheimer cases.\n  2.
