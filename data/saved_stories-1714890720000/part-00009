So what if that guy with the\nWRX knows more about vape coils than wastegates or blow-off valves? And who\ncares if an Outback driver memorized their Aussiedoodle's DNA sequence but not\ntheir engine code? The cars are popular for a reason: They carry you and your\nstuff (almost) anywhere.\n\nI talked to a handful of Subaru owners who are making their cars even better\nat that core purpose by \"regearing\" their continuously variable transmissions.\nCVTs don't have gears so much as pulleys (see our explainer here), so they\nachieve this by switching out the factory CVT for another whose built-in front\ndifferential has an improved final drive. From there, they swap in a\ncorrelating rear diff, completing the mod.\n\nClearly, these drivers care more about off-road performance than most Subie\nloyalists. And while those same CVTs draw the ire of blowhard enthusiasts\nacross the internet, the units in these builds are being put to good use. It\nall starts with diving into the Subaru parts bin for some OEM+ upgrades.\n\nI first found out about these mods when Milton Salguero posted in the Lifted\nSubie Society Facebook group. (We used to own a Forester, so you can bet I\njoined the day we drove it home.) Since I come from the world of trucks and\n4x4s, you can probably imagine how my eyebrow raised when I read about his\nregeared, 2.5-liter engine-swapped Crosstrek, pictured at the top of the page.\n\n\"CVTs are interesting to work with. Most people have full four-wheel drives,\ntwo-speed transfer cases. That's a lot easier to work on, easier to regear, et\ncetera,\" Salguero told me over the phone. \"Thankfully, a buddy of ours [Bruce\nYeager] discovered that the parts within the CVT are identical between several\nplatforms, whether it's Outback or Crosstrek or Impreza or Forester. They all\nuse a TR580 transmission and all the internal parts, except the differential\ngears and wiring harnesses, are almost identical.\n\n\"All you have to do to make this swap work is change the valve body cover and\nthe wiring harness from the original vehicle's transmission onto the donor\ntransmission, which we've been taking off 2015-2017 Subaru Outbacks with the\n2.5-liter naturally aspirated engine.\"\n\nYeager was the first to make the mod on his 2013 Outback, which he's turning\ninto a DIY Wilderness model of sorts. He's been chronicling the project\nonline, both on YouTube and owner forums like subaruoutback.org. In his case,\nYeager swapped his Subie's final drive ratio from 3.9:1 to 4.11:1\u2014that means\nimproved performance in low-speed situations like crawling.\n\nBecause the transmission's output shaft now has to rotate 4.11 times instead\nof 3.9 times to turn the differential gears one full rotation, wheel speed is\nslowed as a result. All the while, the lower gearing increases torque sent to\nthe wheels, which are now turning at a slower pace. This means the car can\nclimb up and over obstacles in a more controlled manner. This is especially\nhelpful when your vehicle has upsized tires, as more torque is needed to turn\nthe larger-diameter rubber.\n\nLando tells me, \"As far as we know, this kind of swap works on \u201813-\u201814 2.5\nOutback, \u201813-\u201817 Crosstrek; \u201812-\u201816 Impreza, \u201813-\u201818 Legacy, and \u201813-\u201818\nForester...with a 2.0-liter or 2.5-liter FB engine with a CVT.\" Matthew\nHeiskell/@sk_foz\n\nThe next Subaru owner to do it was Carey Lando, a three-time Rebelle Rally\ncompetitor who goes by MtnSubi on social media. Her Outback's upgrade was\nactually forced when a CV axle lodged into the car's front differential. \"Once\nwe determined there were no other options to salvage the existing CVT, we\nsourced a new transmission and had it installed and working in 2-3 days,\"\nLando told me. \"My generation Outback is underpowered and has a lot of self-\npreservation programming for the older-generation CVT. It often bogged down\nduring certain situations and this regear helped address some of that, and\nmade it peppier to drive around town.\"\n\nThat's a common thread among these more modified Subarus. On-road performance\nhas seen a healthy boost as well because now, the gearing is more well-suited\nto the taller tires. Salguero claims that his car's zero to 60 mph time jumped\nnearly two seconds, putting it close to where it was stock.\n\nAll this stems from a mod that's relatively inexpensive and simple to make:\n\n\"You can find these transmissions at pick 'n' pulls or through Facebook\nMarketplace,\" Salguero said. \"I found two or three on Marketplace for between\n$450 and $500. All you have to do after that is match the rear differential\nand potentially change the rear axles, but that's not necessarily required.\nOnce you swap those couple of things, you drive the car away like normal. It\ndoesn't have any check engine lights or throw any codes. It just works.\n\n\"I did it over a weekend in a home garage with just normal jacks and whatnot.\nIt's remarkably accessible for a lot of these Subaru owners to do.\"\n\nKyle Newton / @tidepool_media\n\nIn closing, Salguero told me about an adventure he and a group of wheeling\nbuddies went on in Washington's Tahuya State Forest. A friend with a Crosstrek\nlearned while on the trail that his front motor mounts were toast, causing\nsuper harsh vibrations. Rather than drive it out, Salguero offered to tow it\nout with his Crosstrek. He finished the job, three-wheeling and articulating\nthrough dips and divots\u2014all while pulling a 4,000-pound car with its\ntransmission in neutral.\n\nTimes like those are when mods get the chance to prove themselves. For a DIY,\nOEM+ upgrade, I'd say that's not half bad.\n\nGot a tip or question for the author?
