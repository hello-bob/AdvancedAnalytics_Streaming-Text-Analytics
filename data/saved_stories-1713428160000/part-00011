However, the estimation of calories\nburned during exercise is inaccurate and cannot be used for medical diagnosis.\nIn this work, we present JoulesEye, a smartphone thermal camera-based system\nthat can accurately estimate calorie burn by monitoring respiration rate. We\nevaluated JoulesEye on 54 participants who performed high intensity cycling\nand running. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of JoulesEye was 5.8%,\nwhich is significantly better than the MAPE of 37.6% observed with commercial\nsmartwatch-based methods that only use heart rate. Finally, we show that an\nultra-low-resolution thermal camera that is small enough to fit inside a watch\nor other wearables is sufficient for accurate calorie burn estimation. These\nresults suggest that JoulesEye is a promising new method for accurate and\nreliable calorie burn estimation.\n\nSkip Supplemental Material Section\n\n## Supplemental Material\n\n###### Available for Download\n\nzip\n\nadhikary.zip (122.9 MB)\n\nSupplemental movie, appendix, image and software files for, JoulesEye: Energy\nExpenditure Estimation and Respiration Sensing from Thermal Imagery While\nExercising\n\n## References\n\n  1.
