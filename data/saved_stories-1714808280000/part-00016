As someone who\u2019s currently aiming\nfor a complete Famicom Disk System set, I\u2019m halfway toward acquiring all\nroughly 200 officially licensed games thanks to generally low prices. In the\nover six years I\u2019ve lived in Japan, it\u2019s been great experiencing the thrill of\nfinding complete in box Super Famicom games that are in near-pristine off-the-\nshelf condition.\n\nAnd yet, something has changed. Earlier in April I tweeted about how the\nSurugaya I frequented for years is now a hollow shell of its former self. Once\nfully-stocked shelves are now half full, the Famicom Disk games are all gone,\nand those great deals I used to find are nowhere to be seen. I never expected\nmy grumbling to really get much attention, but my tweets quickly went viral\nand even ended up being featured here on Time Extension.\n\nHaving gotten in touch with Damien, Time Extension's editor, I figured I\u2019d\nweigh in with some extended thoughts on the state of retro game collecting in\nJapan. How exactly did we get here?\n\n2021 - CIB Metal Gear Twin Snakes and F-Zero \u2014 Image: Oliver Jia\n\nFirst, I should provide some background on who I am. I\u2019m an American doctoral\ncandidate who researches Japan-North Korean relations. Dreary stuff beyond the\nscope of this website, I know. But when I\u2019m not researching despotic regimes\nand tense geopolitical problems for my PhD or writing articles as a freelance\njournalist, I like to kick back and enjoy some of my esoteric hobbies, which\ninclude collecting books, films, vinyl records and, of course, video games.\n\nI grew up with my mother\u2019s NES around the same time I got a Wii, which meant\nthat I\u2019ve always had an appreciation for video games new and old. I was around\n10 or 11 years old when I realized that the NES had some great, timeless\nclassics that still held up. My first system was the Game Boy Advance, which,\nin turn, unlocked an entire library of other games from the original Game Boy\nand Game Boy Color. I\u2019m from Pittsburgh, PA which has always had a decent\nselection of retro games compared to most places in the Northeastern United\nStates, so I slowly built up a sizable NES collection.\n\nThis was in the late 2000s going into the early 2010s right when YouTube was\nbecoming a mainstream source of information to learn more about old video\ngames. Thanks to the likes of The Angry Video Game Nerd and Classic Game Room,\nsuddenly, more people were learning about once-obscure titles or reminded\nagain of classic gems, leading to the demand increasing. This began the\nphenomena of video game collecting no longer just being a hobby, but a truly\nviable business on the secondary market where online resellers on sites like\neBay could make a profit off of nostalgia.\n\nDen Den Town Osaka in 2022 - note the fully stocked shelves \u2014 Images: Oliver\nJia\n\nYet despite all of this, Japan for years remained largely immune to these\ntrends. There have certainly always been video game collectors over here, but\nnowhere to the same extent as in the United States. Keep in mind that living\nspaces are generally much smaller in Japan, which means that there\u2019s a limit\nto how much stuff one can keep. People are always unloading and reselling\ntheir old books, movies and games, which is why secondhand chains like Book\nOff and Surugaya have been so successful.\n\nSome video games like Gimmick for Famicom or Magical Chase on PC Engine are\nextremely expensive, but that\u2019s because those titles are legitimately scarce\nand never had large print runs. When it comes to standard fare like a boxed\ncopy of Super Mario Bros. or complete copies of all the original Pok\u00e9mon Game\nBoy games \u2013 where literally millions of units were produced \u2013 one hardly had\nto break the bank if they wanted to re-experience their childhood in Japan.\n\nUnlike the United States, there is currently no culture here of organizations\nlike Wata Games or Heritage Auctions artificially inflating prices as part of\na speculation bubble that YouTubers like Karl Jobst have exposed as shady, to\nsay the least. This accounts for why Sonic creator Yuji Naka was seemingly\nbaffled that a copy of Sonic the Hedgehog on Mega Drive (and one not even in\npristine condition) sold for over $430,000 in 2021. Retro video games being\nviewed as actual six-figure investments has simply never been a thing in\nJapan.\n\nKobe Surugaya 2021 - Full shelves of PS1 games \u2014 Image: Oliver Jia\n\nWhen I first came to Japan in 2017 to do an internship at a glass plant and\nlater do a study abroad program, I arrived at a good time for collecting video\ngames. I first lived in Ube, a rural town in Yamaguchi Prefecture with few\ntourists and a Book Off in the same neighbourhood as my apartment. Even now,\nthe countryside is still the best place to find games in Japan due to the\ngenerally lower demand compared to the cities. But back then, though, large\npopulation centres like Tokyo and Kobe were not automatically bad spots for\ngame hunting, either. You simply had to know where to go and be quick on the\ndraw.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic later upended everyone\u2019s lives the world over, and one\nof the ensuing responses was a rush of renewed interest in retro video games\nwhen people had to stay home with little else to do for months on end. When\nyou pair this with the nonsense of speculator bubbles fueled by groups like\nWata, it\u2019s no surprise that it has become an even more expensive hobby than a\ndecade ago. But this was largely something only affecting the American market.\n\nBecause there were no tourists in Japan for nearly two years due to the\ngovernment closing the borders in response to COVID-19, stores had\nconsistently stocked inventories of games. While many domestic Japanese\nconsumers likely took advantage of this time, there were enough Zeldas and\nMetroids to go around since the hardcore collector base here has always been\nmuch smaller than overseas relative to the items that are available. I truly\ngot some of the best deals I\u2019ve ever experienced three years ago, but we are\nnow unfortunately long past those days.\n\nMike Tyson Punch Out CIB bought for 3800 yen in 2021 at Kyoto Surugaya \u2014\nImage: Oliver Jia\n\nThis brings us to the present and the sad display of Surugaya shelves that\ninitially inspired me to write this piece. The way I see it, the problem is\nnow two-fold \u2014 a sharp increase in foreign visitors and a sharp decrease in\nthe value of the yen. With the number of tourists to Japan returning to pre-\npandemic levels and likely on their way to surpassing them, people from abroad\nare coming to game stores found in the country\u2019s urban centres en masse. One\nhalf of this crowd is your average tourist who simply wants two or three games\nas a souvenir to take home, while the other half is the inevitable scalpers\nwho will clear entire shelves to resell on eBay.\n\nAs of this writing, 1 U.S. dollar is currently in the ballpark of around 158\nyen. This means that a \u00a55000 game to a Japanese consumer would only cost $31\nUSD to an American tourist, making it understandably a steal. I don\u2019t blame\nany tourist who buys a couple of games they\u2019re nostalgic for because it\u2019s a\ngood deal and cheaper than what they would get back home. You\u2019re much more\nlikely to find a complete-in-box Super Famicom or N64 game here than you would\nfor their equivalents in the U.S., for example. But the other side of this is\nthe scalpers who make the hobby worse for everyone in trying to turn a profit,\nleaving nothing left for those who actually want to play these games.\n\nAnother reason for the changing environment of retro video games in Japan is\nhow some retailers are creating online portals which allow foreigners to buy\nitems without even stepping foot in the country. Proxy sites like Buyee\nadditionally serve as middlemen with how they purchase products on an overseas\ncustomer\u2019s behalf, charge them a fee, and ship them out of Japan. This has led\nto a notable depletion of domestically available stock and is likely a major\ncontributing factor to those empty shelves I\u2019ve posted about.\n\nKyoto Surugaya 2024 - the shelves are emptied \u2014 Images: Oliver Jia\n\nI should stress, of course, that none of this is illegal, and if an individual\nconsumer wants to buy an item for whatever reason, that\u2019s completely within\ntheir right to do so. I\u2019m merely providing an autopsy for how we\u2019ve gotten to\nthis point and explaining what the reality of the situation is. Retro video\ngames, being long discontinued items which are often decades old, are a finite\nresource. That goes for anything \"retro\" \u2013 be it out-of-print books or first\npressings of vinyl records. We also, fortunately, live in a time where\nemulation means that for most of these games, original hardware is usually no\nlonger a necessity and more of a luxury for enthusiasts like myself.\n\nBut have things truly gone off the deep end for retro gaming in Japan? To\nbegin with, the golden age of retro game collecting ended long before I even\narrived here. If we turn the clock back to the early to mid-2000s before the\nadvent of smartphones and YouTube, most of this stuff was in clearance bins or\nbeing sold for practically nothing apart from the truly rare stuff. By the\ntime I came to Japan in 2017, those deals were already no longer to be found.\nWith that said, the stuff I find these days is still generally much cheaper\nthan what\u2019s available in the U.S., something I verified when I recently\nvisited my family earlier this year.\n\nI\u2019ve generally given up on retro game hunting in big cities, but every so\noften I\u2019ll venture into the countryside to places far removed from tourist\ntraps like Tokyo\u2019s Akihabara or Kyoto\u2019s Kawaramachi and find the hidden\ntreasure I\u2019m searching for. As one gets older and reaches the physical limits\nof their collection, you naturally become more selective in what you want to\nown anyway. I still have my goal of getting a complete Famicom Disk set and as\nfar as I can tell, it\u2019s not a system most people care about due to the\nhardware maintenance involved. I recently got an Analogue Duo and the sheer\nabundance of PC Engine games available in Japan means I\u2019ll never run out of\nstuff to play.\n\nKyoto, 2024 - the return of the tourists \u2014 Image: Oliver Jia\n\nWhile the online proxy sites are eating into places like Yahoo Auctions and\nSurugaya, I can still usually find what I\u2019m looking for on sites such as\nMercari and Amazon JP because it\u2019s only really the bigger outlets which cater\nto foreigners. Knowing Japanese means that I can find the best deals if I\nfrequently conduct new searches and bargain with individual online sellers for\neven better prices.\n\nIn situations like that, the prices really haven\u2019t changed for me that much\nnow compared to five years ago. Some games, like the Dragon Quest series, are\nalways going to be readily available due to their large quantity, and the\ntext-heavy nature of their gameplay means most non-Japanese speakers have\nlittle interest.\n\nThe state of retro video game collecting in Japan has undoubtedly changed, but\ndespite some new challenges, I\u2019m fully aware of how lucky I am to live in a\ncountry that\u2019s still the best country for this hobby. It\u2019s understandable why\nso many tourists want to take advantage of that when they come from countries\nwith far worse scarcity like mainland China or South Korea. But if you do\ndecide to come to Japan for the video games, I personally hope you\u2019ll actually\nplay what you buy.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### News \"The Tourists Have Taken Everything\" Laments Japanese Resident As\nRetro Runs Dry\n\n\"I don\u2019t bother shopping for retro games in big Japanese cities anymore\"\n\n### Guide Retro Game Shopping In Tokyo, Japan\n\nThe place where you can find everything\n\n### News Here's Some Footage Of A Young Matt Berry Exploring CeX's Legendary\nRetro Shop\n\nBack when the idea of retro was still pretty new...\n\n  * Share:\n  * 38\n\n  * 5\n  * 13\n\nAbout Oliver Jia\n\nOliver is a Kyoto-based American researcher on Japan-DPRK relations and has\ncontributed to NK News, Lost in Cult and The Spectator.

Sometimes they mislabel games with Engrish\nso even more likely you'll get a fair price\n\nOne bummer tho is that Mega Drive did so poorly in Japan that a bunch of games\nare more expensive than their USA version, and the rare games are crazy, like\n$500-1500 ;(\n\nSince the author mentioned Gimmick, which is like $1500 CIB, you can make your\nown circuit pretty simply and solder it to a $10 game (I forget which Fami\ngames, but google knows).\n\nI'm sure there are many of you who also want to experience the actual game on\nreal hardware and have real art/case/manual, so I think these ways are as\nclose as you can get without shelling out $1000 for Saturn games\n\n  * 2\n  * Reply\n\n  * 2\n  * NinChocolate\n  * 3:23pm\n\nI\u2019d love to visit Japan and take a look at the game shops there.

That's the year my N64 collection grew from just\nConker's Bad Fur Day and a busted Japanese Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2 (Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\n1 for the west) to almost 30 games in the span of less than 365 days.\n\nAround February, someone was selling loose Japanese N64 games in my area, I\ngot about 18 games for about 5000 Mexican Pesos (about $250 back then) in\nthree different bunches.\n\nI got Smash Bros., Mario Kart 64, Diddy Kong Racing, Kirby 64, Yoshi's Story,\nPok\u00e9mon Snap, Pok\u00e9mon Stadium (the Japanese one that has only 41 of the\noriginal 151 Pok\u00e9mon), Pok\u00e9mon Stadium Kin Gin (Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2 for the\nwest), Hey You, Pikachu! (no VMU), Mario Tennis 64, Doubutsu no Mori (Animal\nCrossing), Bomberman Hero, Shiren the Wanderer 2, Donkey Kong 64, Banjo-\nKazooie and 1080\u00b0 Snowboarding.\n\nThat same year I also found cheap American copies of GoldenEye 007 with some\nissues, Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, Blast Corps, Ridge Racer 64, an\nexpensive copy of Banjo-Tooie and a Japanese copy of the first Doraemon game\non N64.\n\nOh, and the guy who sold me the Japanese games was also a technician and fixed\nmy Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2 and GoldenEye 007.\n\nCoincidence or not, my N64 collection started to grow on January 2021 when I\nfinally decided to get a working controller and give the system the attention\nI had neglected it all these years. That year I also got an Expansion Pak, a\nRumble Pak with the battery cover and one of the rarities of my collection:\nthe official N64 Game Drawer for 24 games. That's where I have my Japanese\ngames.\n\nSome Japanese games I regret not getting are the 2 versions of Super Mario 64,\nMario Golf 64, the Mario Party trilogy, the Shindou Pak Taio version of Wave\nRace 64, Star Fox 64, F-Zero X, Star Wars Episode I Racer and Ocarina of Time.\n\nBut I suppose I'll get my chance another day.\n\nOther retro gaming highlights of that year include getting the screws to open\nNintendo games and systems from the same guy to fix my Gamecube on my own that\nwas pending since 2006, finding copies of WarioWare: Twisted!, Banjo-Pilot,\nEternal Darkness, Metroid Prime 1 and 2, Sonic Gems Collection and Sonic\nRiders GC.\n\n  * 3\n  * Reply\n\n  * 4\n  * HammerGalladeBro\n  * 4:12pm\n\n> I personally hope you\u2019ll actually play what you buy.\n\nThe only ones I haven't played from my Japanese bunch are Shiren the Wanderer\n2, Doubutsu no Mori and Doraemon due to the language barrier; ergo, I don't\nundertand the context of the dialogues, but I'm starting to learn Japanese\nslowly but surely.\n\nI haven't played Hey You, Pikachu due to a lack of VMU, and when I do get one,\nI still probably won't be able to play it.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 5\n  * SpeedRunRocks\n  * 4:17pm\n\nI have 7 or 8 years of import collecting under my belt.

There are a few I broke that rule with.\nCrisis Force for Famicom was one of the best decisions I ever made. It's such\na good game!\n\nThings really did get stupid in 2020.

I remember when the pandemic hit, I took my love of the DS /\n3DS library, and decided to start collecting (with the intention of playing).\nAt first, it was so nice being able to find games that I had always wanted to\nplay or wanted to play again pretty easily and affordably, but that quickly\nchanged. It was pretty disheartening, especially when I started expanding to\nGBA games. My family and I do play all of them, and it just really bothers me\nthe price gouging that has occurred with what should be being able to enjoy my\nfavorite form of entertainment.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 8\n  * Pastellioli\n  * 4:44pm\n\nI don\u2019t collect retro games (only play them on modern hardware) but the hobby\nseems rather interesting; having a large collection of old games and being\nable to play all of them is so cool! Not to mention some do it for\npreservation reasons, and I really appreciate it when people try to preserve\nolder games for those in the future to keep looking back at.\n\nThe prices some sell for retro games online is pretty shocking to say the\nleast, and that increases if the game is unique or rare. Like I said, I don\u2019t\nbuy retro games and only inexpensive re-releases on modern hardware, but I\u2019ve\nheard some N64 games go for pretty high prices. It\u2019s worse here in America,\nand the same goes for titles that are scalped.\n\nI watched a video by Nathaniel Bandy where showcased his entire N64 game\ncollection, and he had a section dedicated to games that were re-sold at high\nprices. One of the games, Conker\u2019s Bad Fur Day, he mentioned going for\nhundreds to even thousands of dollars online, and I read on Wikipedia that the\nlikely reason for why the original cartridge has a high price tag was the\nunique styling of the game and it being considered the most impressive N64\ngame technically. I occasionally visit an N64 forum and posters there have\nbeen able to snag the game for cheap, maybe for $10 or $20. Because of how\nexpensive the game is, others are under the assumption that the copy sold for\ncheap is pirated or a reproduction, but I\u2019ve seen all the time that the copies\nare real.\n\nIt\u2019s surprising, because that game got a port on the Xbox One via Rare Replay\nand a remake in 2005, so you would think a retro game readily playable on a\nmodern console would have its original copies go for cheaper.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 9\n  * alisia__dragoon\n  * 6:31pm\n\n\"But if you do decide to come to Japan for the video games, I personally hope\nyou\u2019ll actually play what you buy.\"\n\nPersonally, I don't appreciate being lectured like that, especially by someone\nwho is so privileged as to live in Japan.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 10\n  * Ristar24\n  * 6:45pm\n\nWe used to have import shops in London... I bought a lot of my Japanese Saturn\ngames in Game Focus in Goodge St. Still have my Japanese GameCube copy of\nSonic Gems I pre ordered there, the shop is long gone sadly. Ha, I only ever\nbuy retro games to play them in the first instance, lots of them are in the\nloft now though. Be nice to visit Japan one day.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 11\n  * HumanDog\n  * 7:12pm\n\nI dislike Western (mostly American) retro gaming culture ruining the Japanese\nmarket. The Japanese was mostly about playing games and often selling them for\nreasonable prices. American gaming is just about consuming as much as\npossible. Hoarding, collecting, flipping and bragging about it in Youtube\nvideos. It's quite sad.\n\n  * 1\n  * Reply\n\n  * 12\n  * BlaizeV\n  * 56m ago\n\nCannot be overestimated how many Japanese are also aware of the value and\nprofit they can make selling their domestic releases abroad. If you could shop\nlocally and quintuple the value of readily available stock at your local\nsecond hand stores you'd be hard pressed to turn those oppurtunities down. So\nit's not just tourists ransacking stock but locals too.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\n  * 13\n  * Sketcz\n  * 54m ago\n\nThank you for the fascinating write up.\n\nSadly retro collecting in the UK, not just America, has been utterly ruined by\nscalpers. I just go without - I'm not giving in to their insane price demands.\nThose items get relisted infinitely.\n\nI miss old Japan. Visited 2001, 2002, and 2013.\n\nThe first time Akihabara was incredible. Paradise. I brought a Duo-R home. The\nlast time Japan had changed. It sounds like it hs changed even more.\n\n  * 0\n  * Reply\n\nTap here to load 13 comments\n\nLeave A Comment\n\nHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Grand Theft Auto III Likely Wouldn't Exist Without The Sega Dreamcast\n\nHere's how Sega's console helped Rockstar find its groove\n\n  * Limited Run Games Apologises For Shipping 3DO Games On CD-Rs\n\n\"We will strive to do better\"\n\n  * PS1 Exclusive Crash Bandicoot Gets Ported To Sega Saturn\n\n\"Bringing Crash Bandicoot to Sega's 32-bit console is quite a challenge\"\n\n  * The Cost Of Owning A MiSTer FPGA Is About To Come Down Dramatically\n\nUpdate: New board shown in action\n\n  * Someone Has Finally \"Fixed\" The Mega Drive's Audio Shortcomings\n\nSay hello to MegaMP3\n\nPopular Right Now\n\n  * The Cost Of Owning A MiSTer FPGA Is About To Come Down Dramatically\n\n10am\n\n  * Limited Run Games Apologises For Shipping 3DO Games On CD-Rs\n\nYesterday, 8:50pm\n\n  * All Analogue Pocket OpenFPGA Cores And Where To Download Them\n\nThu 25th Apr 2024\n\n  * The Truth About Retro Game Hunting In A Post-Pandemic Japan\n\n2:05pm\n\n  * Vanillaware Artist's 1996 PS1 Shmup 'Devil Blade' Is Getting A Modern-Day Reboot\n\n8am\n\n  * Ghosts 'n Goblins-Esque Platformer 'Gladmort' Heading To Neo Geo, Steam, & Dreamcast\n\n11:45am\n\n  * FPGA Vs Software Emulation - Which Is Best?
