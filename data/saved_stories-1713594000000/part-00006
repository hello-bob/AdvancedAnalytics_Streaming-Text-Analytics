I had met Omi the day\nbefore, after a long struggle to get permission to set my foot on this remote\narchipelago. Omi, the holder of the bird\u2019s nest concession, had granted me a\nride but he was not to join until the very end of the harvest. The men around\nme were leaving for the first trip of the season and I did not really know\nwhat to expect from the three days and nights I was about to spend on this\ncut-off island in the Sulu Sea. Needless to say, I did not speak a word of\nFilipino, but I was lucky to be with Alfred, a friend I had met a couple of\ndays before at the local market who was willing to be my translator for the\ncoming days. I was up and ready to follow these workers on their daily quest\nfor nests.\n\nI must confess the first time I heard of edible nests I thought it was a hoax.\nIs somebody seriously willing to pay for a bowl of soup made from hardened\nstrands of bird saliva? Yet, Rosmal was not up for jokes. He was a serious man\nliving in a small village in the North-East of Borneo, father of five and a\nhard worker. He was about to spend a whole season away from his family to\ncollect nests in the most inaccessible of places: on the roofs and sharp walls\nof the intricate Gomantong cave system.\n\n> It seemed so extraordinary that I was totally hooked by the story.\n\nThe idea was to be back in a year and a half during the harvest season, but\nthe more I was making plans the more I was stumbling into closed doors. Nest\ncollection is a heavily regulated business and getting a permit to Gomantong\ncave was proving to be a hard and costly task. After yet another disappointing\ncall to the local government office, I had eventually given up and started\nlooking into alternative locations. It did not take long before setting my\neyes on the Northern tip of Palawan, Philippines.\n\nThe engine-propelled Bangka, an overgrown canoe outfitted with two bamboo\noutriggers for increased stability, had just left the pier of Taytay, a sleepy\ntown on the Northeastern tip of Palawan. During the 1-hour long trip that led\nus to the Pabellon Island, Alfred was doing his best to translate the common\nset of questions about my age, number of children and marital status. On my\npart, I was trying to get a first glimpse into the life of these hard-looking\nmen, thought it was difficult to get over the embarrassment you might expect\nfrom people who just met for the first time. Things would have certainly\nstarted to smooth over by the end of the day.\n\nWhat a sight this island was. A pristine stretch of sand lapped up by the\nazure waters, surrounded by a dramatic limestone cliff. A few shacks were\nscattered around, providing food and shelter to a dozen of fearless workers\nlocally known as busyadores.\n\n### Busyadores have been climbing these karsts for centuries and regulations\nhave been introduced in Taytay as early as 1927 to guarantee the conservation\nof the birds. The collection period begins in December with the \u201climpiada\u201d,\nliterally the cleaning of the cave wall from the old nests in preparation of\nthe new season. The first harvest follows in January and it is completed over\nseven collection periods with 15 days interval. After the last harvest,\nbusyadores observe a long resting period to allow swiftlets, known by the\nlocals as balinsasayaw, to repeatedly lay eggs until fledging.\n\nWe were welcomed by the island caretaker. \u201cPlease, join us for dinner\ntonight!\u201d, he said while handling a large pot on the backyard fire. Men were\nstarting to assemble around the fireplace with the few exceptions of those on\nduty for the night.\n\nAt more than $2500/Kg, bird\u2019s nests are among the most expensive food consumed\nby humans, feeding a growing market worth $5 billion a year. It comes as no\nsurprise that nest poaching is a major problem, posing a major threat to not\nonly the workers but also to the swiftlets population. Thieves are sometimes\nspotted in the middle of the night; they leave their boats and swim to the\nshore for a few hundred meters before climbing in darkness on the top of the\nisland. They will spend a few days in solitude, trying to steal as many nests\nas possible before getting back to their comrades. To prevent poaching, armed\nguards patrol the island for the length of the harvesting season, on the look\nout for unwanted visitors. \u201cWhat if they are caught?\u201d, I asked Omi\u2019s brother\nwho had just joined with another boat. \u201cWe bring them to the authorities, but\nchances are that they are shot to death and let sink in the sea\u201d.\n\nThe next morning busyadores set out for the neighboring Pequeno Island,\ncarrying flashlights, ropes and bamboo poles. Some of the men were holding a\nhandmade stick ending with a bent fork, to remove nests from the most\nunapproachable walls.\n\nArthur, 24 years-old, was among the youngest and the only one climbing without\npoles. Eduardo, 51 years-old from Pangatalan, was the oldest. \u201cI started\nclimbing 45 years ago at the age of six; there was a narrow cave where only\nsmall children could go\u201d, he recalls.\n\n> \u201cMost of us prefer climbing without ropes, but rocks can be sharp and\n> slippery, and the risk of an accident is high. I remember a few men falling;\n> it\u2019s a dangerous business\u201d.\n\nGuano is among the most accessible caves on the island and one of the few\nwhere light found a way through. It can be entered through a narrow passage,\nwhich quickly opens up into a 100m high chamber, making it one of the few\nplaces where it is actually possible to witness the whole process.\n\nSlowly and steady, busyadores made their way through a path walked by their\nancestors for countless generations. It took them about 1 hour to set up ropes\nand bamboo ladders and another hour to harvest the nests.\n\n> I was holding my breath when Alfred forced his way through a crack in the\n> cliff face, fighting with darkness and the constant risk of falling to his\n> death for a bunch of nests.\n\nIt took them approximately two days to cover the craggy skyscrapers that\ncharacterize the entire concession. Busyadores knew the pathway and quickly\nventured from one dark cave to the other through an established routine,\nbringing back their gatherings to the wooden hut. Michael, 27 years old from\nMeytegued island and among the most skilled climbers, was particularly\nsatisfied.\n\n> \u201cI collected more than 100 nests; at Php 80/gram, this is worth three times\n> the salary I get on a gasoline boat during the resting season\u201d\n\nBack to the hut, Michael and the other workers would then fine-tune their\ngatherings by removing feathers and dirt with a blade and the most precise\ninstrument of their hands.\n\nOmi had arrived the same morning to sort through the nests and pay the\nseasonal worker. The finest grade of bird\u2019s nest (\u201cA\u201d grade) would fetch up to\nPhp 170/gram, while the lower quality \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d grade would sell for Php\n130/gram and Php 70/gram, respectively. For one of the most expensive foods on\nearth, even the debris did not go waste; they would be soaked in water,\ncleaned from impurities and sold for Php 10/gram. \u201cI am taking the nests to\nTaytay, traders are waiting for me there. Most of the nests will be shipped to\nManila and then to other Asian markets\u201d, he revealed.\n\n> In China, bird nests are considered a treasured health supplement, raising\n> libido and improving the immune system.\n\n### While demand for this delicacy is soaring, nest gatherers are faced with\nsome major challenges. Prices are plummeting, owing to artificial nest farming\nin windowless building that emulate cave environments, putting the income of\ntraditional gatherers at risk. Sustainability concerns have also been raised\nand the swiftlets population is suspected to be in decline because of poaching\nand over harvesting. In this regard, the Pabellon concession is a virtuous\nexample of sustainability, as the strict regulations put in place (nests are\nnever collected if eggs are present and harvesting times are strictly\nfollowed) give the birds enough time to reproduce. Given the mutual\nrelationship between the birds and the local communities dependent on them, a\nbright future might still lie ahead.\n\nMen where ready to return to their families. When I began my journey back to\nTaytay, night was approaching and I had time to reflect on this captivating\nexperience. Meeting these people brought concepts such as courage, strength,\nand determination on a totally new dimension.\n\n* * * * *\n\nExplore my Portfolio\n\nFollow me on Facebook\n\n### Comments\n\n  1.

But I never thought how precious this commodity is and\nhow deadly the task of getting. (Love your shots btw) This is a real \u201cbuwis-\nbuhay\u201d as we Pinoys call it.
