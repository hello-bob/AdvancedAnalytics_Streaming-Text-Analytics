And it takes\neffort to become more effective. But bad leadership gets worse almost\neffortlessly, says Barbara Kellerman, a Center for Public Leadership Fellow at\nHarvard Kennedy School. She shares real examples from the public and private\nsectors of how bad leaders spiral downward, and how bad followership enables\nthat negative trend. She gives her advice for recognizing and avoiding\nineffective and unethical leaders. Kellerman is the author of the new book\nLeadership from Bad to Worse: What Happens When Bad Festers.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I\u2019m\nCurt Nickisch.\n\nWhen Volkswagen appointed a CEO in 2007, that leader came in with a firm\nreputation. Martin Winterkorn was known for unbridled ambition and ruling with\nan iron fist. VW set the goal of becoming the number one carmaker in the\nworld. Winterkorn wanted the German car company to beat Toyota and General\nMotors in units sold, profits, and customer satisfaction within ten years.\n\nAt first, there were big successes. But in 2015, a scandal broke:\nEmissionsgate. Volkwagen had created a so-called defeat device. It let its\ncars meet pollution regulations only when they were tested, not when they were\non the road.\n\nNow those few lines of software were not Martin Winterkorn\u2019s idea. But his\nleadership was widely criticized for making them possible. Looking back, you\ncan point to a weak company board, compliant employees, and an enabling\nculture. So if the signs were there, why did no one act on them?\n\nThat\u2019s something today\u2019s guest has researched. She says if you want good\ncompany leaders, one of the worst things you can do is tolerate bad ones.\nBecause that can easily spiral and make things much worse.\n\nBarbara Kellerman is a fellow at the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard\nKennedy School, and she\u2019s the author of the new book Leadership from Bad to\nWorse: What Happens When Bad Festers. Barbara, glad to have you on the show.\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: My pleasure.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: You write in the book, \u201cBad leadership is a social disease.\u201d\nWhat makes you say that?\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: Well, I have been interested in the question of how bad \u2013\nbad leadership, and I might add bad followership \u2013 have persisted. So we are\nvery good at attacking, trying to cope with physical diseases. We pour\nhundreds of millions into all of these every year and we pour hundreds of\nmillions into mental diseases.\n\nBut for some reason we put up with bad leaderships, which is sometimes to say\nthe obvious, extremely bad to the point of being evil, as if somehow we are\ncompletely incapable of tackling it. I compare it to a disease because it\u2019s\nsomething that has forever plagued the human condition. It startles me that we\nput up with bad leadership, whether it\u2019s in the workplace or in the body\npolitic or in the military or in education, you name the domain, without\nhaving the slightest conception, virtually the slightest conception of how to\nstop or at least slow it.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: We should define bad because I think when we say bad bosses or\nbad leaders, we immediately think we know what we\u2019re talking about. But of\ncourse that can encompass so many different failures. How do you define bad\nwhen you think about bad leadership?\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: I just wrote an article for a leadership journal about what\nhas stopped us from taking on bad. And certainly one of the reasons is not\nonly because bad is hard to define, but because of differences in values and\nopinions. So your definition of a bad leader could be my definition of a good\nleader.\n\nBut my overarching way of trying to acquaint audiences and students with what\nI mean is to have two simple axis. One of them is an axis from effective to\nineffective. So very simply, along that axis, a leader is a good leader if he\nor she is effective and a leader is a bad leader if he or she is ineffective.\n\nThe other all-important axis, is the axis that is the continuum from ethical\nto unethical. So a leader is good if he or she is ethical, not to speak of\nbeing both ethical and effective. And a leader is bad if he or she is\nunethical, not to speak of being simultaneously unethical and ineffective.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: So a good leader is ethical and effective?\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: Exactly.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: You have it in the title of your book that things go from bad\nto worse. You say that bad leadership can fester very easily if we don\u2019t stop\nit and it doesn\u2019t get better or rarely gets better. Its natural progression is\nto get worse. What did you see in your studies and research that tells you\nthat?\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: To me, it\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s so self-evident that\nit\u2019s amazing we don\u2019t act on it. But again, I think it\u2019s a lot to do with...\nit\u2019s not something we take seriously enough, as I said earlier. So I\u2019m going\nto try to take a non-controversial example and simply point of Vladimir Putin.\n\nVladimir Putin has been in charge of Russia in one or another guise for over\n20 years and the Vladimir Putin that we see in 2022, 2023, 2024, and I\nmentioned 2022 because that\u2019s when he made the decision to invade Ukraine, is\nquite different from the Vladimir Putin that first took office in around the\nyear 2000. He is a perfect exemplar of a leader who has gone from not so great\nto somewhat bad, certainly by the standards of an American liberal Democrat,\nto increasingly worse.\n\nAnd now as we speak in 2024, worse in every possible way. Again, speaking from\nthe perspective of a liberal Democrat, if by worse you mean oppressive and\nrepressive both at home and abroad.\n\nBad leaders do not typically wake up one morning and say, \u201cGolly gee, I\u2019ve\nbeen bad. I need to change my ways.\u201d They will stop being bad only if someone\nelse or something else stops them. And if nothing stops them and no one stops\nthem, they will go from bad to worse. I do talk about four stages or phases in\nmy book, and I might add that the more time goes by and the worse they get,\nthe more difficult they become to uproot.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: You mentioned before that we are not very good at stopping bad\nleaders.. Are we bad at identifying it? Do we have bias against change? Do we\nfeel powerless? I\u2019m wondering what the reason is for the bad followership that\nyou also talk about.\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: So to your questions, Curt, the answers are yes, yes and\nyes, but your last word is one that I do want to pick up on. Leadership, it\u2019s\nnot a person, it\u2019s a system. It\u2019s a little bit more complicated than focusing\nonly on the leader. So the system, what I call the leadership system, consists\nof three parts of equal importance.\n\nPart one is the leader. Part two are the followers. You cannot have a leader\nwithout at least one follower. Part three, the contexts, plural, within which\nleaders and followers are situated. And you cannot tackle bad leadership\nunless you educate followers to, number one, the possibility that they might\nbe able to do something about a bad leader. And then number two, provide\nfollowers with some tools for how they might go about doing this.\n\nI never want to downplay how hard it is to uproot a bad leader, whether it\u2019s\nin the workplace, whether it\u2019s in the body politic, whether it\u2019s in the\nmilitary, whether it\u2019s in a school. Upending bad leaders is often hard work\nand it is sometimes even quite risky. So I don\u2019t want to make it seem easy to\nupend a bad leader. It is much more difficult to uproot a bad leader the\nlonger we wait.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: Well, let\u2019s talk about the phases of bad leadership. You can\nend up with a catastrophic situation with a terrible leader. But as you make\nthe point, it\u2019s a progression. What are some of the early signs of bad\nleadership and ineffective leadership that you think followers should pay more\nattention to? And in this case that might be employees in a company, right?\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: So stage one is watching out for a leader who seems to\npromise the moon and the stars. Every leader, especially when they take over,\nwhether it\u2019s in politics or in business or in the military or in a higher\neducation, wherever, they promise changes and they promise that the changes\nthey make will make things better.\n\nBut if you have a leader who seems to promise things that are almost\nfantastical, wildly ambitious, exceedingly ambitious, almost narcissistically\nambitious, as if that was previous was bad and everything under their reign\nwill be good, then I would argue that\u2019s the initial warning sign.\n\nPay attention. If a leader promises you, as I said, the moon and the stars, if\nthe promises seem unrealistic, almost fantastical, then I would say be alert,\npay attention. I\u2019m all for a leader being optimistic and determined and\nwanting to get to a better place, no question about it, that optimism is\nreally, really important. But if it seems somewhat unrealistic, somewhat\ndetached from reality, then I would be slightly suspicious.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: And it\u2019s interesting, promising the moon and the stars could be\nany entrepreneur nowadays, and it probably was in Elizabeth Holmes\u2019s case,\nright? What other signs should followers look out for?\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: Phase two is to acquire followers to expand and enlarge\ntheir base. But in this case, I\u2019m talking about followers who seem to buy into\nthat fantasy in an either excessively docile way or a way that at the other\nextreme is wildly enthusiastic and supportive.\n\nIn other words, the role of the follower, whether it\u2019s, again, in the\nworkplace or in a country or in any setting that we can possibly conceive of,\nis to be aware that leadership makes a difference and to be enlightened to the\npoint of being willing to act if they see something or hear something that\nseems to them to be off base. So when you talk about the private sector, of\nElon Musk\u2019s board at Tesla, and you have the feeling that followers are so on\nboard, so dedicated and devoted that they\u2019ve reached the point of being\nlargely, if not entirely uncritical, then you can assume that trouble might\nensue.\n\nSo the nature of the followership, the size of the followership, if too many\npeople are going along too uncritically, that\u2019s phase two, then you could be\nrunning into trouble because there is no corrective that is being put in\nplace. So phase one is promising the moon in the stars in ways that seem\nperhaps untethered to reality. And phase two, by promising such an abundance\nof good things, you acquire followers who are too often uncritical,\nunjudgmental, and conversely too enthusiastic about a leader who is promising\nthings that cannot reasonably be attained without upending the system.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about exercising that control and\nrecognizing that because it\u2019s a judgment call, right? So do you have any\nrecommendations for somebody who\u2019s an employee at a company and they\u2019re not\nsure if the leader is out of touch or just really ambitious and that could be\na good thing?\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: Absolutely. I think maybe implicitly you\u2019re talking about\ntech entrepreneurs who often are visionaries and are seeing futures that the\nrest of us absolutely cannot, and how do we distinguish between the fantasist\nand the person who really is just able to have some kind of a vision that will\nlead to some kind of splendid outcome.\n\nI would simply point out, Curt, that many of the tech visionaries grounded\ntheir early language in a global morality that turned out in relatively short\norder to be completely untrue. So if you go back to the young Mark Zuckerberg\nor you go back to the young Steve Jobs, or you go back to the young Larry\nPage, or you go back to even younger than he is now, Sam Altman. In every one\nof these cases, it wasn\u2019t just about the technology per se, it was about\npersuading us, the public at large, but also persuading employees who then in\nmany, many, many cases, as I do not have to tell you, became later wildly\ndisenchanted; It is not uncommon for the technologies to evolve in ways that\nseem not just not in line with the original moral vision, but indeed the\nantithesis of it.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: So that\u2019s one, you might want to pay extra attention to that.\nMost people maybe vote with their feet, they leave the company if they feel\nlike it\u2019s not going somewhere. What can you do in that situation as an\nemployee to maybe better suss out whether or not you have a good leader at the\nhelm taking you into the future or a bad leader at the helm taking you the\nwrong direction?\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: You know, anytime you talk about leadership and\nfollowership, you\u2019re certainly not talking in exact science here by any\nstretch of the imagination. But I do talk about certain things that you can\ndo. You know, so much of this is about, and I\u2019m going to use a phrase that\nbecame popular first in the sixties and probably much more in the seventies\nand into the early eighties in the women\u2019s movement, which has to do with\nconsciousness. The phrase is consciousness raising, which is just being aware.\nMost of us go to work and we don\u2019t think a lot about the mission of the\norganization that we\u2019re a part of, and we don\u2019t think a lot about the moral\nquality of the leadership of the organization.\n\nSo I think much of it is simply what I\u2019m trying to do is consciousness\nraising. Pay attention, watch for the signals. Do not assume that what\nhappened in 2022 is going to be the same thing that\u2019s happening in 2024 or\n2026. So it\u2019s a lot about paying attention. And then if you start to become\npersuaded that something may not be going as well as you think, speak up and\nspeak out. Do not be afraid to speak truth to power. But be aware, as I\nearlier said, of the risks that are involved and do so intelligently, which\ngenerally means don\u2019t go out on a limb alone, try to work with other people,\nsee if you have allies in the organization who are willing to speak up.\n\nBut you and I both know that there are plenty of people in virtually every \u2013\nand I\u2019ll go back to the tech companies who started mainly because they\u2019ve\nevolved so quickly, who have worked at places like Meta and Google Alphabet\nand who started off thinking they were on the side of the angels only to\nrealize in a certain amount of time that theirs was a business like any other,\ntheirs was a profit-making enterprise like any other. And that if harm had to\nbe done in order to increase profits, by and large people were not giving it a\nsecond thought. Some of these moral issues are actually quite profound.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: I wonder, I don\u2019t know, if you are advising a student or if\nyou\u2019re advising somebody in your family who\u2019s taking a new job. Are there\nquestions you think they should ask during the interview process? Wuestions\nthat you think they should ask their manager as they go along to try to raise\ntheir consciousness. They want to be aware, but what are some of your favorite\nways to do that in a safe way as they\u2019re getting rolling and building up their\nconfidence with it?\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: I think it\u2019s a great question because most people who are\nin the position of applying for a job and then getting the job are often so\nhappy to get the job that they don\u2019t ask the larger questions about the\norganization that, apparently, because they\u2019re applying for the job in the\nfirst place, they\u2019re eager to join. But I think looking at past performance,\nnot just in terms of efficacy and efficiency, but in terms of morality, I\u2019m\ngoing to go back to the two axis of what is not only a good leader and a good\nfollower, but also a good place to work.\n\nOne is, is the place of potential employee effectively doing what it says it\nis intent on doing what its purpose is? And the other is the ledger of\nmorality. Do I feel that this is a place based on past performance precisely\nbecause we\u2019re unable to predict the future \u2013 but based on past performance, do\nI feel this is a place to which I could be not just professionally committed,\nbut personally committed in that I believe not only in the mission of the\ncompany, but I believe that the mission is being adhered to as opposed to\nneglected, that the words have some meaning behind them?\n\nSo I would say that perhaps the best thing you can do is to be alert to the\nkinds of issues that you and I have been talking about, but then also to look\nat past performance. So a combination of consciousness raising, being aware of\nthe concerns that you might have about performance, whether it\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, ethical, efficacy, being aware of it. Number one, being aware.\nNumber two, looking at past performance as some kind of indicator of future\nperformance.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: And then that\u2019s a baseline that you work from when you\u2019re in\nthat job and you see things change or you see things that come up?\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: Yeah, it depends. We all have many things that motivate us,\nCurt, as I don\u2019t have to tell you, and I don\u2019t underestimate the power of\nmoney, I don\u2019t underestimate the power of safety and security. I have no doubt\nthat many listeners are working in places that they wish could in some ways be\ndifferent. And we all do our own personal and professional cost and benefit\nanalyses to calculate when it\u2019s worth saying something, when it\u2019s worth\nprotesting, when it\u2019s worth even quitting.\n\nCURT NICKISCH: Barbara, thanks so much for giving us some food for thought and\nsome tools to make a difference when we choose to do so. I really appreciate\nyou talking about this on the show.\n\nBARBARA KELLERMAN: Thanks very much for the conversation.

Here\u2019s How to Get Out of the Rut\n\nWorker disengagement is on the rise around the world. Even those of us who\ngenerally like our jobs sometimes find it hard to muster energy and focus. So\nwhat's the key to regaining motivation? Harvard Business School professor\nBoris Groysberg and research associate Robin Abrahams share a four part\nprocess to help you get your groove back: detachment, empathy, action and\nreframing. They offer simple tips like thinking in the third person, helping\nothers, and gamification to help get back on track. Groysberg and Abrahams are\nthe authors of the HBR article \"Advice for the Unmotivated.\"\n\nRead More\n\nView Podcast\n\nEpisode 962\n\n### Are You Asking the Right Questions?\n\nFew leaders have been trained to ask great questions. That might explain why\nthey tend to be good at certain kinds of questions, and less effective at\nother kinds. Unfortunately, that hurts their ability to pursue strategic\npriorities. Arnaud Chevallier, strategy professor at IMD Business School,\nexplains how leaders can break out of that rut and systematically ask five\nkinds of questions: investigative, speculative, productive, interpretive, and\nsubjective. He shares real-life examples of how asking the right sort of\nquestion at a key time can unlock value and propel your organization. With his\nIMD colleagues Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dalsace and Jean-Louis Barsoux, Chevallier wrote the\nHBR article \"The Art of Asking Smarter Questions.\"\n\nRead More\n\nView Podcast\n\nEpisode 961\n\n### A Roadmap for Today\u2019s Entrepreneurs\n\nMany people aspire to entrepreneurship but we all know it's a high-risk\nendeavor.
