(Photo: Reuters)\n\nIn the eastern Chinese port of Dongying, the start of 2024 has often seen\nseveral tankers docked simultaneously discharging Russian crude oil into a new\n31.5-million-barrel storage facility completed late last year.\n\nIt is, traders say, all part of a concerted and deliberate Chinese effort to\nbuild up strategic stockpiles for a perhaps uncertain future.\n\nEstimates of China's total strategic energy reserve vary from 280 to 400\nmillion barrels, the upper amount exceeding the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve\nat roughly 364 million. China consumes some 14 million barrels a day of oil in\npeacetime.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat does seem clear, however, is that China is deliberately stockpiling at\nspeed, part of a much wider national effort to accumulate essential raw\nmaterials and resource.\n\nWhen it comes to energy, much of the new inflows now come primarily from\nRussia, whose energy exports to China rose by roughly one quarter last year to\na record 2.14 million barrels per day.\n\nRELATED\n\nThat makes the Kremlin Beijing's largest energy supplier for the second year\nrunning, overtaking Saudi Arabia -- and allowing China to benefit from\nsubstantially discounted Russian oil as US and Western sanctions have turned\naway multiple other buyers since Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBeijing's stockpiling of oil is just one example of what appears a broad\nnational effort to significantly increase the holdings of key raw materials.\nIt is a move that some increasingly suspect is intended to help insulate\nBeijing against any future war or international sanctions, such as those that\nmight be sparked by a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n\nIn a piece for international affairs and conflict blogging site \"War on the\nRocks\" published on April 17, Mike Studeman, former commander of the US Office\nof Naval Intelligence and intelligence and director of the US Indo-Pacific\nCommand, argued that this was part of a much wider process.\n\n\"Xi Jinping is preparing his country for a showdown,\" he wrote, describing the\nChinese leader as \"militarising Chinese society and steeling his country for a\npotential high-intensity war.\"\n\nPart of that, he suggested, included building up strategic stockpiles of\nessential goods and resources, protecting China against the kind of sanctions\nimposed on Russia after its Ukraine invasion -- or, indeed, a militarily\nenforced blockade as part of a regional or global war.\n\nOther examples of heightened preparedness, he said, included the much higher\ntempo of Chinese military operations around Taiwan -- designed to both\nexercise China's military and implicitly threaten the government in Taipei\nwith the consequences of its own total military blockade.\n\nUS officials say they believe Mr Xi has given his armed forces until 2027 to\nbe prepared to invade Taiwan, although those inside and outside the US\ngovernment remain divided on whether a decision to actually attack has\ngenuinely been made.\n\nThis week, the outgoing head of the US Indo-Pacific Command said Beijing was\ncontinuing to plough resources into its military despite economic turmoil\ncaused by a real estate crisis and a slump in US-China trade.\n\n\"Despite a failing economy, there is a conscious decision to fund military\ncapability,\" Admiral John Aquilino told a naval conference in Japan. \"That's\nconcerning to me.\"\n\nWhat is clear, Western experts and officials say, is that the government in\nBeijing has learned multiple lessons from Russia's troubled experience in\nUkraine.\n\nThese include the desirability of managing any military takeover extremely\nquickly, presenting the outside world -- and particularly the US -- with a\nlightning change of government in Taiwan's capital Taipei before anyone can\ntruly react.\n\nOver the last year, US President Joe Biden and counterpart Xi have held one\nrelatively cordial meeting in California in November and at least one follow-\non bilateral telephone call, while military officials have held direct\nmeetings aimed at finding ways to ensure communication and reduce tensions in\nany future crisis.\n\nSo far, neither Washington nor other Western states have moved to\nsignificantly cut China off from raw materials, although the US has\nincreasingly worked to strip Beijing of access to high-tech microchips,\nparticularly those that could be used for weapons.\n\nEuropean states remain publicly divided over their approaches to Beijing, with\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz visiting China this month in what appeared to be\nan effort to maintain ongoing trade links.\n\nGerman officials say Mr Scholz pressed Chinese counterparts including Mr Xi on\nmultiple issues including human rights and Beijing's support for Russia in\nUkraine.\n\nMore broadly, however, Western-Chinese relations continue to deteriorate --\nand not just over Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rogue province with which\nit vows to pursue \"reunification\" either peaceably or by force.\n\nThis month, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told fellow Nato foreign\nministers that ever more Chinese components were being found inside Russian\nweapons in Ukraine. Beijing's support for Moscow, Mr Blinken said, was\napproaching the threshold of delivering lethal weapons systems.\n\nThis week also saw two rounds of arrests in Europe linked to alleged espionage\nby China, including two parliamentary researchers in Britain and three Germans\nworking on defence programmes. China's embassies in both countries denied\ninvolvement in spying.\n\nHaving initially recovered following the Covid pandemic, US-Chinese trade\nnosedived in 2023 and so far shows little signs of recovering.\n\nOfficials in both the US and Europe also say they are considering introducing\ntrade tariffs on Chinese production of electric vehicles in particular,\naccusing Beijing of deliberate overproduction in a way that threatens US and\nEuropean rivals.\n\nShould such tariffs be introduced, relations would almost certainly\ndeteriorate still further.\n\nChina's government buyers have never been ones to turn down a bargain,\nfrequently building up their national stockpiles when short-term prices fall.\nNewly imposed Western sanctions on Russian nickel, aluminium and copper that\nentered force this month are seen as likely to spur further Chinese buying.\n\nWhen it comes to lithium, a vital component in many types of battery, Beijing\nhas bought up not just stock but also processing facilities and mines,\nincluding overseas.\n\nIn March, investment bank UBS estimated that China might control a third of\nall global lithium supply as soon as 2025, again exploiting a price crash to\nfurther build its holdings.\n\nA US Geological Survey report from 2016 showed China's mineral deposits\ncontaining aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium, iridium,\ntantalum, tin, tungsten, zinc and zirconium as well as other rare earth\nelements.\n\nSince then, China has sometimes sold off elements of its strategic reserves\nwhen prices have been particularly high, thereby reducing the costs for\nChinese industry. More broadly, however, those stockpiles have continued to\ngrow.\n\nWhen it comes to one particular commodity, those purchases appear to go well\nbeyond the government. Chinese consumers and companies, as well as state\ninstitutions, have been on a particular buying spree this year for gold,\npushing its global price to a record high above $2,400 (88,704 baht) an ounce.\n\nThat has prompted speculation that China is about to make a concerted effort\nto wean itself and other major emerging economies off their long-term\ndependence on the US dollar.\n\nBut it may also be a reflection that China's elite expect a more dangerous-\nfeeling world over the rest of the 2020s and beyond, and would rather\nconsolidate their wealth within Chinese borders well before that situation\nworsens.
