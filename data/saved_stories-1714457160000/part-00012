Towering trees with massive\nbuttress roots create a dense, emerald-hued canopy where monkeys hoot,\nmalimbes chatter and hornbills flutter between the branches with their high-\npitched honks and impressive wingspans.\n\nAlong the park\u2019s fringes, 122 communities own small patches of the jungle\nwithin the four-kilometer-wide (2.5-mile) buffer zone. In the past, people\nhere relied on these community forests to harvest timber and other forest\nproduce, hunt for bushmeat and grow staple crops.\n\nIn the 1900s, logging and mining intensified in the region\u2019s forests,\nincluding the area that would become Gola Rainforest National Park. People cut\ndown large swaths of trees in the buffer zone to grow cash crops like oil palm\nand cacao, from which chocolate is made. Poaching and encroachment in the\nforest increased during Sierra Leone\u2019s civil war in the 1990s and into the\nearly 2000s, further threatening the rainforest and its wildlife. According to\na 2017 geospatial analysis published by Purdue University in the U.S., such\nactivities led to massive deforestation, with the Gola community forests\nlosing more than 4% of their tree cover annually between 1991 and 2016.\n\nGola Rainforest National Park sits on Sierra Leone\u2019s border with Liberia and\nprotects one of the country\u2019s last large tracts of primary forest.\n\nIn 2013, a carbon credit project was launched in the Gola rainforest to stymie\ndeforestation and provide a sustainable, alternate livelihood for forest-\ndependent communities. The 30-year project follows the United Nations-backed\nframework to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation\n(REDD+) by managing forest resources sustainably and enhancing forest carbon\nstocks. Companies, countries and other entities can purchase carbon credits\nthrough the program and use them to offset their emissions and meet the\ntargets of the Paris Agreement, which aims to slow global warming enough to\nthwart its worst effects. In return, the forest-rich, low-income tropical\ncountries receive monetary benefits for conserving their forests and\nsafeguarding biodiversity.\n\nThe 30-year Gola REDD+ carbon project began as a collaboration between the\nU.K.\u2019s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which has been\nworking in Gola since the 1980s; the Conservation Society of Sierra Leone\n(CSSL), one of the country\u2019s oldest conservation organizations; and the\ngovernment of Sierra Leone. Their joint venture, the Gola Rainforest\nCompany\u2013Limited by Guarantee (GRC-LG), sells carbon credits and works with the\nforest-edge communities \u2014 the project\u2019s beneficiaries \u2014 to enact conservation\nmeasures.\n\n### Gola rainforest: A biodiversity hotspot\n\nSpanning more than 740 square kilometers (286 square miles), about twice the\nsize of the U.S. city of Detroit, the picturesque Gola rainforest teems with\nlife. More than 60 threatened species, including many endemic to the Upper\nGuinean forests, call these forests home.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the richest biodiversity areas in the world,\u201d says Fiona\nSanderson, a principal conservation scientist at the RSPB who has studied the\nbiodiversity of the Gola rainforest for more than a decade.\n\nThe rainforest harbors a dozen primate species, including Diana monkeys\n(Cercopithecus diana) and western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius),\nmore than 300 species of birds, including endemic rufous fishing owls\n(Scotopelia ussheri) and yellow-casqued hornbills (Ceratogymna elata), and a\ndizzying array of butterflies. The forest is also a refuge for western\nchimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), African forest elephants (Loxodonta\ncyclotis), pygmy hippos (Choeropsis liberiensis) and giant pangolins (Smutsia\ngigantea) \u2014 all of which are threatened.\n\n\u201cSome of them are fantastic specimens of nature [and] they are very, very\nattractive,\u201d says Sierra Leonean conservation biologist Hazell Shokellu\nThompson. \u201cIf we lose the Gola forest, we will certainly lose quite a number\nof these animals and birds in this region, not only from Sierra Leone but also\nfrom West Africa.\u201d\n\nAfrican forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) are listed as critically\nendangered by the IUCN. Image by Rhett A. Butler/Mongabay.\n\nThe rainforest stores some 19 million metric tons of carbon, and the REDD+\nproject is expected to result in emissions reductions of around 550,000 tons\nof CO2 per year. \u201cIt is a large tract of rainforest that is acting as a huge\ncarbon sink,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cIt is important for avoided emissions [and] for\nour battle against climate change.\u201d\n\nThe REDD+ program aims to trade this stored carbon to save the rainforest and\nits impressive biodiversity.\n\n### Forest-friendly cacao: Reviving livelihoods and protecting forests\n\nA major component of the Gola REDD+ project is establishing forest-friendly\ncacao plantations within the buffer zone around the national park. Although\nnot a native species to the region, cacao has been grown in Sierra Leone since\nthe British colonial era and is a crop that farmers rely on for income. Nearly\n70% of the world\u2019s cacao comes from smallholders in West Africa, particularly\nGhana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, where large swaths of forests are cut down to make\nway for monoculture plantations.\n\nIn partnership with the RSPB, the Gola REDD+ project encourages farmers to\ngrow shade-loving cacao under the canopy of native rainforest trees such as\nIvory Coast almond and African teak (iroko). Cacao relies on native insects,\nbats and birds for pollination and pest control.\n\nAccording to the RSPB, 2,587 farmers living in the forest fringes cultivate\nmore than 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres) of forest-friendly, shade-grown cacao\nas part of the REDD+ project. In 2020, 44 metric tons of cacao was grown in\nthese farms. Apart from cacao, farmers also grow kola nuts, coffee and\nvegetables.\n\nResearch suggests cocoa crops produce higher yields if grown under the\ncanopies of rainforest trees. Image by Fiona Sanderson.\n\nThese agroforestry patches don\u2019t just provide food and income for forest\ncommunities \u2014 they also act as corridors and habitat for wildlife in areas\nthat would otherwise be cleared for conventional agriculture, according to the\nRSPB.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do is flip it on its head,\u201d Sanderson says of the\nforest-friendly cacao plantations. \u201cIt creates a kind of forest-like structure\nwith the same native trees.\u201d She says that more than 100 native tree species\nare found in these agroforestry plots, and nearly half of them have potential\neconomic value \u2014 a key driver for agroforestry.\n\nThe cacao plantations are also a haven for wildlife, according to researchers.\nA study conducted by Sanderson and colleagues and published in Agriculture,\nEcosystems & Environment in 2022 recorded more than 140 bird species in Gola\u2019s\nshade-grown cacao plantations, of which nearly 60% were forest-dependent\nspecies such as hornbills. Many plantations had more native species than the\nthreshold required for sites to qualify as Important Bird and Biodiversity\nAreas \u2014 a designation given by BirdLife International that signifies the\npotential of a site for bird conservation. Chimpanzees, monkeys and forest\nelephants also venture into the cacao plantations to raid crops, much to the\nchagrin of local farmers.\n\nAs a cash crop, cacao generates revenue for farmers. However, access to\nbetter-paying markets hasn\u2019t been easy. As part of the Gola REDD+ project, the\nGRC-LG has set up cooperatives within the communities where farmers, as\nmembers, can sell their beans at a premium. The beans are then exported to\ninternational markets, where their selling price is higher than what the\nmiddlemen visiting the communities offer. Through the cooperatives, farmers\nreceive training on best practices to improve cacao yields and adopt forest-\nfriendly cultivation practices.\n\nA farmer in a Gola community works in a shade-grown cocoa plantation. Image by\nMichael Duff.\n\n\u201cForest-friendly cacao is quite a unique program because it is encouraging\nshade-growing cacao by providing a premium or a bonus for farmers [which]\nincentivizes them to be a part of the program,\u201d says social scientist Natasha\nConstant at the RSPB. She says preliminary results indicate cacao production\ncontributes to 69% of farmers\u2019 incomes. \u201cThe merit in [shade-grown cacao] is\nthat ... the income generated through agroforestry cacao can be almost twice\nas high as that of monoculture.\u201d\n\n### Benefits galore for forest-edge communities\n\nSince the inception of the Gola REDD+ project, the GRC-LG has partnered\ncontinuously with the seven Gola chiefdoms and their member forest-edge\ncommunities in the spirit of obtaining free, prior and informed consent, as\nenshrined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous\nPeoples (UNDRIP). According to GRC-LG representatives, paramount chiefs and\nthe communities that are part of the REDD+ benefit-sharing agreement have the\nfinal say in how the funds are used.\n\n\u201cDuring the development of the REDD+ carbon project, we went into community\nconsultation, participatory meetings and assessment,\u201d says Fomba Kanneh, who\nheads the GRC-LG and who grew up in a Gola forest-edge community. \u201cWe did [a]\nneed[s] assessment with all the communities \u2014 looking into the historical\nprofile of the area and what they used to do before the commencement of the\nprogram.\u201d\n\nAs a result of these consultations, the Gola REDD+ project was expanded to\nprovide scholarships, uniforms and books for students, set up a savings-and-\nloan scheme for women-owned small businesses, invest in building schools and\nhospitals, and provide training for farmers to increase their crop yields so\nthey don\u2019t have to slash and burn additional patches of the forest to feed\ntheir families. Growing forest-friendly cacao was also a choice the\ncommunities made.\n\n\u201cBefore the REDD+ project, communities were involved in mining, logging and\npoaching for money, but now it is hard to access these resources,\u201d Kanneh\nsays. \u201cSo, the communities have agreed to develop a beneficiary agreement that\npays a royalty for conservation.\u201d Kanneh adds that the GRC-LG has 56 rangers\nwho regularly monitor and patrol the park for deforestation, logging,\npoaching, mining and other illegal activities.\n\nA member of the Malema Cocoa Farmer\u2019s Association weighs his cacao produce at\nthe cooperative. Image by Michael Duff.\n\nSheku Kamara, executive director of the Conservation Society of Sierra Leone,\nsays the project links conservation to livelihood. \u201cThe dependency on the\nforest is for people to get their livelihood. So if you can provide them\nsomething of an alternative, where they can increase their income, they will\nbe less dependent on the forest,\u201d he tells Mongabay. \u201cLivelihood is a tool\nthat we use in conservation.\u201d\n\nThese principles have translated into results, according to a recently\npublished 2024 study in Nature Sustainability that found that in its first\nfive years, the Gola REDD+ project reduced the average annual deforestation\nrate in the buffer zone by 30% compared to areas that weren\u2019t part of the\nREDD+ project. This reduction in deforestation translates to 340,000 metric\ntons of avoided CO2 emissions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not removing deforestation [through the REDD+ project]; we\u2019re just\nreducing it,\u201d study co-author Maarten Voors, an economist at Wageningen\nUniversity and Research in the Netherlands and who is not affiliated with the\nGola REDD+ project, tells Mongabay. He attributes this reduction to forest-\nfriendly cacao plantations. \u201cTo a large extent, they\u2019re not clearing the dark\ngreen stuff \u2014 the important trees, the big ones that have sequestered a lot of\ncarbon \u2014 they\u2019re leaving those aside and doing other activities.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that the reduction in deforestation didn\u2019t affect\npeople\u2019s incomes. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see win-win, but we saw a win-no loss,\u201d Voors\nsays.\n\nA small cocoa plantation coexists with rainforest in the Gola region. Image by\nFiona Sanderson.\n\nThe Gola REDD+ project isn\u2019t without its challenges. Kamara tells Mongabay the\ncarbon credit market tends to be volatile and can impact the revenues\ngenerated for the communities. Bringing together over more than 100\ncommunities with different priorities and needs requires years of hard work,\ntrust and transparency in benefit-sharing. Shashi Kumaran, head of sustainable\nfinancing at the RSPB, says imparting financial literacy to farmers to manage\ntheir cacao farm business can be challenging. Cacao yields, although\npromising, can vary, pushing farmers to resort to more lucrative but forest-\nharming activities like logging, according to the RSPB\u2019s Sanderson. She adds\nthat deforestation in the buffer zone can spike during periods of economic\ninstability, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDespite these challenges, those involved in implementing the Gola REDD+\nproject say they see a bright future for it because the communities see the\nbenefits and appreciate the efforts put in by the different partners.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have conservation without people, and we want a landscape that\ndelivers for everyone because the communities living within them are\nabsolutely [an] integral part of the landscape,\u201d Sanderson says.\n\nBanner image: A western red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus badius) by user\npeterichman via Wikimedia Commons (CC 2.0).\n\nSee related:\n\n> Can agroforestry chocolate help save the world\u2019s most endangered rainforest?\n\nCitations:\n\nAbu-Kpawoh, J.
