Startups making Millions\n\n  2. A tool to draw diagrams faster\n\n  3. One recommended video on getting out of poverty\n\n## Startups making Millions\n\nBest way to succeed in startups is copying already successful startups.\n\nYou don't need to be a genius to find an original idea.\n\nAfter all, everything is a remix.\n\nEverything is a remix\n\nBut where do you find these successful startups making millions?\n\nWell, its quite simple.\n\n100s of Indiehackers have been tooting their own revenue on Twitter with the\n#buildinpublic hashtag.\n\nYou can find them through it but its a tedious process.\n\nWe can make it much simpler.\n\nEnter Acquire, previously known as MicroAcquire. Bdw, I still have their\nT-shirt.\n\nAcquire is a marketplace for Startup Founders to sell their profit-generating\nStartups. These are usually small ones that are made by a team of 1-10 people.\nSince they are small, they are easy to copy.\n\nAcquire shows you everything from Revenue to Profit to Competitors to the Cost\nit takes to run. What they don't tell you is the exact startup domain.\n\nBut if you are smart enough, you can find the exact domain through your OSINT\nand SOCMINT Skills.\n\nJust sign up at Acquire. Click on your Avatar on top right and click Explore\nMarketplace.\n\nThen Select the Type of Category you want to choose. I choose SaaS but you can\nfind Shopify Apps, Mobile App, Content, Agency, and more.\n\nAcquire - SaaS Listing\n\nYou can find extremely good ideas on Acquire but I'll list a few that caught\nmy eye:\n\n## 1\\. Twitter outreach tool to find, reach and nurture prospects as well as\ngrow your audience\n\nLink:\nhttps://app.acquire.com/startup/zq3DbEFLHnZscyLRbTlxE1BosXv2/0wfJfThkimzDeVmJuieS?source=marketplace\n\nAcquire SaaS - Twitter Outreach\n\nThis product is a Cold DM tool that has $185 mrr.\n\nThe total profit is $1k and the asking price is $30k.\n\nIf you scroll down a bit, you'll find the founding date, the team size, the\ntech stack, the business model, the competitors, and the growth opportunities.\n\nAcquire SaaS - Twitter Outreach Details\n\nThe best part is when you scroll down a little further. You can find the exact\nAcquisition channels as it connects with Google Analytics.\n\nAcquire SaaS - Twitter Outreach Acquisition Channel\n\nThis is a good idea to build because let's be honest, every business needs\nleads.\n\nAnd what better way to get leads than to automate it with a Twitter outreach\ntool.\n\n## 2\\. AI-Powered Roleplay Site running custom LLM model based off Meta's\nLlama\n\nLink:\nhttps://app.acquire.com/startup/fMWCklAW4PPxiJ4xxpGKzu2Prct2/gvkmQYR8o3GFhG9pbYkS?source=marketplace\n\nAcquire SaaS - AI-Powered Roleplay\n\nNotice on the right there are 15 buyers interested. This shows demand.\nInvestors are mostly interested in the fastest-growing startups.\n\nAI-Powered Roleplay is a huge market.\n\nWe recently covered AI Girlfriends being a Billion Dollar Business and with\nthe recent release of Llama 3, there will be more alternatives like this.\n\nAcquire SaaS - AI-Powered Roleplay Details\n\nThis product is a 1-person product launched last year in June 2023. It has $5k\nin profit and $520 mrr but massive potential.\n\nIf you scroll a bit, we get a Chartmogul graph of ARR, MRR, Customers, and\nChurn rate.\n\nAcquire SaaS - AI-Powered Roleplay Revenue\n\n## 3\\. AI Photography Studio\n\nLink:\nhttps://app.acquire.com/startup/daNCPe3tsEOyluwxQ5PybYIRVA53/KI3d9vSNWsE499iQjQqW?source=marketplace\n\nAcquire SaaS - AI Photography Studio\n\nAI Photography Studios are all the rage launched during the 2nd wave (text-to-\nimage) of AI.\n\nThis one made $2.1m profit and $76k MRR.\n\nAcquire SaaS - AI Photography Studio Details\n\nIt had a TikTok go viral so you can assume they are acquiring customers to\nTikTok. Shouldn't be too hard to find, eh?\n\nAcquire SaaS - AI Photography Studio Competitors\n\nThey have said the competitors are Aragon and Headshot so you can cut those of\nyour list now. There are only so many alternatives. You can nail this startup\ndown even further.\n\nAcquire SaaS - AI Photography Studio Metrics\n\nThe metrics are 100,000+ customers. I'm sure they are boasting it on their\nlanding pages.\n\nYou can easily find this one.\n\n## 4\\. A lead generation platform for businesses to generate and build email\nlists. 100% Organic Traffic.\n\nLink:\nhttps://app.acquire.com/startup/nEOrnThIWNgtBK07TTdQ4Wbn3f73/eB78ZuQwKlVXFaszdnVJ?source=marketplace\n\nAcquire SaaS - Lead Generation\n\nThis one has 43 serious buyers.\n\nThe description is extremely enticing. Hands-off and automated with traffic\nfrom Google? Of course, who doesn't like that.\n\nAcquire SaaS - Lead Generation Competitors\n\n4.7 rating on Trustpilot with 380 reviews!!\n\nAnd the competitor is Uplead.\n\nAcquire SaaS - Lead Generation Metrics\n\nMetrics are incredible. ~$50k mrr ($578k / 12 months) with 100-1000 customers.\n\nAcquire SaaS - Lead Generation Google Analytics\n\nThe traffic is consistent.\n\nNow how do we find which niche this SaaS is in?\n\nTry copying the description we found above and paste it into Google:\n\nAn all-in-one platform designed for businesses aiming to generate leads by\nextracting data from various social media channels and quickly building email\nlists, with an amazing Trustpilot rating of 4.7 based on over 380 reviews from\nsatisfied customers.\n\nGoogle Search for Lead Generation SaaS\n\nAnd scroll down a bit to see Outscraper and LeadSwift recommended.\n\nOpen them both up in the New Tab.\n\nRemember the listing had Tech Stack?\n\nYep, we'll use that to nail it down further.\n\nInstall Wappalyzer on your platform of choice. I use Chrome so I installed the\nChrome Extension.\n\nReload the websites (Outscraper and LeadSwift) so the extension loads.\n\nNow, you'll see only Outscraper is using WordPress and jQuery while LeadSwift\nonly uses jQuery.\n\nBut remember, they might be using React for their dashboard which you can only\nfind after login.\n\nBut I've found an important datapoint. Outscraper was founded earlier than\n2022. You can check the Oldest Tab on their YouTube channel.\n\nTherefore, it might be Leadswift.\n\nNote that this might not be 100% accurate as I'm sure Acquire has used ChatGPT\nto rewrite the description so it isn't easily searchable through Google but\nyou can use OSInt Techniques to nail it down to the actual SaaS in question.\n\nA few tips:\n\n  1. Find their founding date and compare.\n\n  2. Find Trustpilot ratings and sort by reviews. Don't forget to search for \"leads\"\n\n  3. Stalk the founders on Linkedin to find their company starting date. You can also do that through YouTube Oldest Search.\n\n  4. Reverse-engineer their SEO strategy\n\n  5. Check their location on the website. The location in the listing is United States (Florida)\n\nIf you just want to build a startup in this niche, then the approximation is\nmore than enough to get an idea of what to build.\n\nHowever, every listing gives enough info to find them. Some numbers might be\nmisinterpreted to misdirect you.\n\n## A tool to draw diagrams faster\n\nTldraw is a really easy-to-use drawing tool.\n\nThe name is easy to remember. Like TL;DR but ending with Draw.\n\nYou can use it to draw quick images.\n\nI use it all the time to point arrows to it cross-platform as I sometimes use\nWindows, Linux, or Mac.\n\nTldraw makes for consistent arrows.\n\nIt also has AI-powered generation nowadays.\n\nTry it especially with your kids. This is much easier than Microsoft's Paint.\n\n## One recommended video on getting out of poverty\n\nAlex Hormozi made this video 9 months ago after his tweet went viral.\n\nIt has insane advice on volume, skill, and outreaching in just 15 minutes.\n\nWatch it if you haven't watched any Hormozi videos. He knows his stuff.\n\n## Tweet of the day\n\n> How to Use Youtube for free backlinks:\n>\n> YouTube backlinks are external links to your site that come from a YouTube\n> video or anywhere on the surrounding platform.\n>\n> Like this one: twitter.com/i/web/status/1...\n>\n> \u2014 Dumpster Rental Guy-GMB Optimizer (@irentdumpsters) Apr 19, 2024\n\nBacklinks matter if you want to rank your site.\n\nAnd Google is prioritizing backlinks from big sites so use them to your\nadvantage.\n\nGet yourself backlinks from Reddit, Quora, Linkedin, Medium, YouTube, Twitter.\n\nThey directly impact your ranking.\n\n## Rabbit Holes\n\n  1. But are you really serious about it? - Don't half-ass anything. Either finish what you started or don't try.\n\n  2. Two succinct pieces of writing advice from Charles Bukowski - Charles Bukowski had one of the best insights per word ratio. Listen to his poems.\n\n  3. 3 things i know about growth - Some unconventional growth advice.\n\n### What'd you think of today's email?  \n  \n---  \n  \n  * \ud83e\ude84\ud83e\ude84\ud83e\ude84\ud83e\ude84\ud83e\ude84 F**king great\n  * \ud83e\ude84\ud83e\ude84\ud83e\ude84 Meh, do better\n  * \ud83e\ude84 You didn't bring the heat\n\n  \nLogin or Subscribe to participate in polls.  \n  \nUntil next time,\n\nYour Spells Master!\n\nEnjoyed the newsletter?
