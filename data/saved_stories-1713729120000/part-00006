Is\ndelivery any safer now?\n\nIn October 1985, a teenage Domino\u2019s driver was handed a pizza for delivery\njust outside Pittsburgh. It had been 23 minutes since the customer placed the\norder. He needed to hurry.\n\nHe accelerated out of the restaurant parking lot and, without yielding, plowed\ninto the car of Frank and Mary Jean Kranack, who suffered injuries. In the\nmoments following the accident, a Domino\u2019s manager allegedly grabbed the pizza\nfrom the driver\u2019s car and passed it off to another delivery worker, with a\nmessage: There\u2019s still time.\n\n\u201cYou had to wonder what kind of pressure was being placed on that manager and\non the drivers that they felt compelled to put pizzas over someone\u2019s life,\u201d\nsays the Kranacks\u2019 lawyer, Kenneth Behrend, recalling the incident decades\nlater.\n\nThe pressure stemmed from a now-infamous Domino\u2019s marketing campaign:\nguaranteed pizza delivery in 30 minutes or less.\n\nIt was a policy that had helped establish Domino\u2019s as one of America\u2019s leading\npizza chains \u2014 and, ultimately, nearly destroyed the company\u2019s reputation.\n\n#### Making speed a guarantee\n\nIn 1960, at the first location of what would become Domino\u2019s, founder Thomas\nMonaghan, a former Marine and seminary school dropout, hired two unemployed\nfactory workers to deliver pizzas. They drove the store\u2019s Volkswagen Beetle\nand made 10 cents an hour plus commission.\n\nSoon, the typical Domino\u2019s store had more delivery drivers than pizza makers,\noutfitted gas ovens to work in delivery cars, and made specialized boxes that\nfolded faster than anyone else\u2019s. Its restaurants sold just two sizes of pizza\nand soft drinks (no pasta or exotic Pizza Hut concoctions) and featured no\ntables to maintain a minimalist, delivery-centric aesthetic.\n\nThomas Monaghan (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThat focus started to pay off in the 1980s as Americans got hooked on the\nconcept of delivery:\n\n  * Women\u2019s participation in the workforce was booming, creating a greater need for quick family meals.\n  * The rise of microwaves and frozen dinners made Americans more accustomed to convenience and averse to going out in public. (One food industry exec described these consumer habits as \u201ccocooning.\u201d)\n\nIn 1985, Domino\u2019s claimed a delivery customer could expect the staff to cook a\npizza in seven minutes and have it arrive at their doorstep, on average, 28\nminutes after they placed their phone call.\n\nThat time wasn\u2019t a ballpark estimate. Monaghan was serious about speed,\nrecommending franchises offer free or discounted pizzas if they didn\u2019t arrive\nin 30 minutes or less. By at least the mid-1980s, the 30-minute recommendation\nbecame a guarantee: Any pizza that took longer than 30 minutes was free. (It\nwas later changed to a $3 discount.)\n\nThe Hustle\n\nThe restaurants didn\u2019t live up to the guarantee every time (especially when\ncheap college students tormented drivers with imprecise directions). But the\nchain claimed it had a national success rate of 89% in 1984 and 95% in the\nlate \u201980s. A franchisee that operated 17 stores in Dayton, Ohio, set the\ncompany record by delivering 99% of its pizzas within 30 minutes.\n\nCorporate headquarters audited the stores\u2019 performances by enlisting three\nmystery customers in every market. They\u2019d order pizzas monthly, judge the\ntiming and quality of the pie, and report back to corporate. Monaghan said\nDomino\u2019s used these tests to evaluate employee compensation, bonuses, and\npromotions.\n\nAs he described in his autobiography Pizza Tiger, he considered the 30-minute\nguarantee to be part of a \u201cdefensive mindset.\u201d Instead of spending heavily on\nmarketing, he believed that Domino\u2019s would grow its base by consistently\nmeeting customers\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe Hustle\n\nHe was right: In the 1980s, the Domino\u2019s share of the US pizza industry\nincreased from a small sliver to ~15%, growing from ~300 restaurants to more\nthan 2k.\n\nPizza Hut, pressured by its growing rival, introduced delivery in 1986,\nigniting the \u201cPizza Wars.\u201d But Pizza Hut didn\u2019t offer any timing guarantee,\nand analysts gave Domino\u2019s the advantage.\n\nAs Monaghan had put it a few years earlier, the chain focused on delivery \u201cas\nif it was life or death.\u201d\n\n#### Reckless driving, lawsuits, and pressure\n\nAt a Domino\u2019s restaurant outside Indianapolis, employees kept a tally of\ndrivers who took longer than 30 minutes to deliver a pizza. Every week, the\ndriver with the most late deliveries had to wear a badge that said \u201cKing of\nLates.\u201d Jesse Colson, a punctual teenage driver, never had to wear it.\n\nOn a rainy Saturday night in early June 1989, Colson fatally crashed into a\nutility pole while speeding to deliver a pizza. He wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt \u2014\nhis girlfriend, a fellow employee, told the Indianapolis Star he may have done\nthat to save a few precious seconds when he got out of the car at the\ncustomer\u2019s house.\n\nA Domino\u2019s delivery vehicle follows a rival from Pizza Hut in 1989. (Greg\nWhite/Fairfax Media via Getty Images)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an uncommon scene in Midwestern and Sunbelt communities, strongholds\nfor chain pizza restaurants. The night before, a Domino\u2019s delivery driver was\ninvolved in a nonfatal crash in another Indianapolis suburb.\n\n\u201cIf anything good could come from my son\u2019s death,\u201d Colson\u2019s mother told the\nStar, \u201cI hope that Domino\u2019s does away with that 30-minute or less delivery\npolicy.\u201d\n\nThe chain wasn\u2019t interested. Domino\u2019s emphasized it didn\u2019t ask deliverers to\nspeed or drive recklessly and said the foundation of its delivery guarantee\nwas its efficient cooking process. The company claimed it rejected two-thirds\nof driver applicants and its franchise manual contained an all-caps line that\nsaid: \u201cFAST DELIVERY DOES NOT COME FROM SPEEDING AND RECKLESS DRIVING.\u201d\n\nDomino\u2019s confirmed it knew of 20 people who died in crashes involving its\ndrivers in 1988 (the National Safe Workplace Institute would later claim\nDomino\u2019s delivery drivers had about the same death rate as miners, who had a\nfatality rate of ~35 per 100k). In the company\u2019s annual report that year,\nMonaghan described the failure to honor the 30-minute guarantee as \u201cone of the\nbig disappointments of 1987\u201d and called it the restaurant\u2019s biggest priority\nfor the year ahead.\n\nBut Colson\u2019s death happened around the same time that Kenneth Behrend\u2019s\nlawsuit for the crash involving Frank and Mary Jean Kranack made national\nnews.\n\nBefore Domino\u2019s, Behrend\u2019s most high-profile cases involved lawsuits against a\nprominent lender and a regional branch of the Bell System. But, with a degree\nfrom Cornell in hotel and restaurant administration, Behrend had a grasp on\nhow the restaurant industry worked.\n\nHe started the Delivery Services Negligence Litigation Group and took calls\nfrom attorneys across the country to explain how to structure their lawsuits\nusing a negligent corporate policy claim, a tort technique he pioneered that\nwould allow them to tie a car wreck from a franchisee back to the 30-minute\ncorporate policy of Domino\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThat was the heart and soul of their corporation,\u201d Behrend says. \u201cAnd their\nentire mantra, their entire business model, their entire focus of all\noperations was on 30-minute service.\u201d\n\nAttorney Kenneth Behrend helped organize many lawsuits while representing the\nKranacks in Pittsburgh. (Illustration via Newspapers.com/Miami Herald)\n\nWhen he complained to the press that Domino\u2019s wasn\u2019t providing any data on its\ncrashes, he\u2019d receive packages filled with company documents in the mail from\nanonymous employees. He learned the most common crash happened when a driver\novershot somebody\u2019s house, put their car in reverse, and slammed into a car\nbehind them.\n\nA 1984 company survey revealed that:\n\n  * 17% of Domino\u2019s drivers felt stressed trying to reach their destination in under 30 minutes.\n  * 10% admitted to driving recklessly.\n\nBy 1990, Behrend estimated at least 200 lawsuits had been filed against\nDomino\u2019s, and pressure mounted from legislators and labor unions.\n\nIn late 1993, a case for a woman who\u2019d been struck by a Domino\u2019s driver while\ntaking her kid to a bowling alley went to trial. The jury found Domino\u2019s\nliable for $750k in actual damages and $78m in punitive damages \u2014 the same\namount the company lost in late fees to customers the prior year. (A\nsettlement was eventually reached.)\n\nAn announcement from Monaghan came shortly after the trial ended. Domino\u2019s,\nwhich did not respond to interview questions from The Hustle, was ending the\nguarantee. In a prepared statement, he said that the restaurant chain had\nheard the message \u201cloud and clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what we do in the areas of safety and training for our drivers,\nsome of the public still have a negative perception about us because of the\nguarantee, so we are eliminating the element that creates that negative\nperception.\u201d\n\n#### The new dangers of delivery driving\n\nBehrend says his Pittsburgh case, which had crawled through the court system,\nsettled after the St. Louis decision. So did other lawsuits. But the Domino\u2019s\nlitigation, according to Behrend, also had an unintended consequence. He says\nbaseline personal insurance policies stopped covering drivers who were using\ntheir cars for business purposes.\n\nThat\u2019s an important distinction today, with the US food delivery market having\ndoubled during the pandemic and gig workers facing uncertainty over coverage.\n\nDepending on the app and the specific point in the delivery process, they may\nnot be covered by insurance from the likes of DoorDash or Uber Eats and risk\nsteep costs if they get in an accident \u2014 a too-frequent occurrence.\n\nGeorgetown researcher Katie Wells, who wrote Disrupting D.C.: The Rise of Uber\nand the Fall of the City, authored a report based on interviews with 41 gig\ndelivery drivers in Washington DC, finding that roughly a quarter had been\ninvolved in a collision on the job.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the fatality rate of driver/sales\nworkers (a group that includes delivery drivers) was 14.6 per 100k in 2022 \u2014\nhigher than the rate for protective services workers like police officers and\nfirefighters (10.2 per 100k) and miners (11.7 per 100k).\n\nThe Hustle\n\nGig drivers don\u2019t face an edict for speed like past Domino\u2019s drivers, but\nWells says the requirement to be fast is built into the job, with drivers\nhurrying to make financial incentives, avoid bad ratings, and ensure the food\nis warm upon delivery.\n\n\u201cYour livelihood depends on you getting somewhere and getting there fast,\u201d she\nsays.\n\nThat kind of motivation can be dangerous.\n\nWhen Behrend was preparing his Domino\u2019s case, he remembers speaking to\nbehavioral scientists who explained that delivery drivers stressed by time\nconstraints get a form of tunnel vision. They focus on their destination and\nless on the world around them, leaving themselves and everyone else\nvulnerable, because they must arrive a little bit faster.\n\nThe 30-minute guarantee may have ended decades ago. But its legacy lives on.\n\nTopics: Food\n\n## Follow us on social media\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * ### How One Professor\u2019s Lecture Launched a Food Movement\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### How We Launched a Physical Product in 3 Months\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### Why chocolate is skyrocketing in price\n\nApr 12, 2024\n\n  * ### The radical transformation of the avocado\n\nApr 05, 2024\n\n  * ### Did SunnyD really turn a girl orange?\n\nMar 22, 2024\n\n  * ### The curious case of the disappearing Hydrox cookies\n\nJan 08, 2024\n\n  * ### Why the world\u2019s best vanilla is so easy to steal\n\nAug 15, 2023\n\n  * ### How nuns got squeezed out of the communion wafer business\n\nJul 21, 2023\n\n  * ### How One Professor\u2019s Lecture Launched a Food Movement\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### How We Launched a Physical Product in 3 Months\n\nSep 19, 2020\n\n  * ### Why chocolate is skyrocketing in price\n\nApr 12, 2024\n\n  * ### The radical transformation of the avocado\n\nApr 05, 2024\n\n## Get Smarter on Business and Tech Thanks for subscribing!\n\nGet the 5-minute newsletter keeping 2M+ innovators in the loop.\n\nWant even more business resources?
