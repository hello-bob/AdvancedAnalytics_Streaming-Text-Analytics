An infinite number more, in fact.\n\nPhysicists from the University of California, Davis (UCD), the Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory in the US, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology\nLausanne have redrawn the map of fundamental reality to demonstrate the way we\nrelate objects in physics could be holding us back from seeing a bigger\npicture.\n\nFor about a century, our understanding of reality has been complicated by the\ntheories and observations that fall under the banner of quantum mechanics.\nGone are the days when objects had absolute measures like velocity and\nposition.\n\nTo understand the fabric from which the Universe is made, we need mathematics\nthat breaks down games of chance into likely measures.\n\nThis is far from an intuitive view of the Universe. In what has come to be\nknown as the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum physics, it seems there are\nwaves of possibility until there isn't. Even now, it's not at all clear what\nultimately decides the fate of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat.\n\nThat hasn't stopped physicists from considering the options. American\nphysicist Hugh Everett suggested in the 1950s that all possible measures\nconstituted their own reality. What makes this one special is merely the fact\nyou happen to be observing it.\n\nEverett's 'many worlds' model isn't quite a theory so much as a way of\ngrounding the absolute weirdness of quantum mechanics in something tangible.\n\nWe start with an impression of the infinite multiverse of maybes, or what\nphysicists might refer to as the sum of all energies and positions known as a\nglobal Hamiltonian, and then zoom in on what interests us, constraining the\ninfinite within a finite and far more manageable Hamiltonian subsystem.\n\nYet as a means of comprehending the infinite, could this 'zooming in' be\nholding us back? Or as the researchers behind this latest exercise frame it,\nis it \"too provincial an approach, born out of our familiarity with certain\nmacroscopic objects?\"\n\nTo put it another way, we might readily ask whether Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is alive\nor dead inside its box, but not consider whether the table beneath is warm or\ncold or if the box is starting to smell.\n\nIn an effort to determine whether our tendency to keep our focus on what's\ninside the box even matters, the researchers developed an algorithm to\nconsider whether some quantum possibilities known as pointer states might be a\nlittle more stubbornly set than others, making some critical properties less\nlikely to entangle.\n\nIf so, the box describing Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is to some degree incomplete\nunless we're considering a long list of factors that may potentially stretch\nfar across the Universe.\n\n\"You can have part of the Earth and the Andromeda galaxy in one subsystem,\nthat's a perfectly legitimate subsystem,\" UCD physicist Arsalan Adil explained\nto Karmela Padavic-Callaghan at New Scientist.\n\nIn theory, there is no limit to the way subsystems could be defined, adding\nlong lists of states near and far that could fence off a reality in subtly\ndifferent ways.\n\nStarting with Everett's 'many worlds' the team have come up with what they\nrefer to as a 'many more worlds' interpretation \u2013 taking an infinite set of\npossibilities and multiplying it with an infinite range of realities that we\nmight not normally consider.\n\nMuch as with the original interpretation, this novel take is less a comment on\nhow the Universe behaves but more about our attempts to study it one bite at a\ntime.\n\nThe researchers emphasize they haven't attached a lot of conceptual\nsignificance to their algorithm, but do wonder if it might have applications\nin developing better ways of probing quantum systems, such as those inside\ncomputers.\n\nNo doubt in some other reality, they already have their answer.\n\nThis research is yet to be peer-reviewed and is available on arXiv.\n\nTrending News\n\nFor The First Time, Scientists Showed Structural, Brain-Wide Changes During\nMenstruation Health1 day ago\n\nAI Detects Mysterious Detail Hidden in Famous Raphael Masterpiece Humans3 days\nago\n\nDoctor Reveals What Happens When You Stop Taking Ozempic Health1 day ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
