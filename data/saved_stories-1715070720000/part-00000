Here's Five Tips for Picking Books that \"Blitz\" \u2022\nButtondown\n\n### May 6, 2024, 7:36 a.m.\n\n# Learning a Language? Here's Five Tips for Picking Books that \"Blitz\"\n\n## Bimodal Blitz\n\nI just finished the nightmarish, heartwrenching book and audiobook Wrony by\nCzech writer Petra Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, and it reminds me of what makes a good pick for\na Bimodal Blitz. I'll share five tips with you now.\n\nUSE AUDIOBOOK LENGTH to GUIDE YOU\n\nWhen starting out with Bimodal Blitzing, it's best to choose audiobooks that\nare no longer than five hours. Wrony is three hours and 20 minutes, right in\nthe sweet spot. As you become more comfortable with reading and listening to\nyour target language at faster speeds, you can gradually increase the length\nof the books you blitz. The audiobook's duration is a quick way to gauge the\nbook's length and complexity.\n\nENSURE BOOK and AUDIOBOOK COVERS MATCH\n\nTo avoid discrepancies between the written text and the narration, always make\nsure that the book cover design and the audiobook cover design are identical.\nIf they have different designs, they may be different translations of the same\nstory, which can lead to confusion and hinder your blitzing experience. As you\ncan see, Wrony has the same design.\n\nFOLLOW YOUR INTERESTS and READ WIDELY\n\nBimodal Blitzing is like drinking from a firehose of your target language. Go\nahead and blitz fiction and non-fiction, classic literature and pulp, even\ncontent that seems \"over your head.\" If you think the topic will slake your\nthirst, drink up! The Bimodal Blitz isn't about finding perfectly\ncomprehensible input; it's about exposing yourself to a wide range of\nvocabulary and ideas. Jump into the deep end of the pool, and you'll learn to\nswim fast.\n\nAUDIOBOOKS vs TEXT-TO-SPEECH\n\nWhile AI-driven text-to-speech (TTS) technology has made significant strides,\nit still can't match the quality and nuance of a professional human narrator.\nAudiobooks provide you with native speakers who breathe life into new\nvocabulary with their intonation, pacing, and emotion. This authentic\nnarration gives added context and leads the way as you follow along with the\ntext, translating on the fly and making meaning as you go. It's a fast way to\nimprove your listening comprehension and pronunciation. Wrony has stellar\nstorytelling by two narrators.\n\nThe POWER of GOOD WRITING\n\nEven if you're blitzing using only Google Translate and context clues, a well-\nwritten book by an experienced author will shine through. The engaging\nstoryline and compelling characters will draw you in, making it easier to\nenter a flow state where you're no longer consciously aware that you're\nlearning a language. So, don't hesitate to blitz translated classics by\nrenowned writers like Stephen King or John Steinbeck. Wrony was written by\nPetra Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, a Czech writer, translated by Miros\u0142aw \u015amigielski into\nPolish, and then partially translated into English for my quick reference.\nThat's almost two translations deep, and I still found it to be a life-\nchanging story.\n\nThe TWO-STAGE BLITZATHON\n\nIf you're embarking on a 30-day or 100-day Bimodal Blitzathon like me,\nremember that this is just the first stage of the program. In the second\nstage, you'll choose your favorite book from all the ones you blitzed and\nfocus solely on that one. This deeper dive using different modalities will\nhelp you reinforce the language patterns, vocabulary, and cultural insights\nyou encountered during your initial blitz.\n\nWant more?
