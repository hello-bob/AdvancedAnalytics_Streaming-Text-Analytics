Turner would not disclose the specific\nsite due to the client's desired confidentiality, but said it is in the\ngreater Boston area and within ready-mix truck distance from the BS&G\nfacilities.\n\n\"It's going to be in that building for decades to come,\" says Leah Ellis,\nSublime Systems' CEO. \"It really was the culmination of a lot of effort to see\nit not just being done for testing's sake, but actually, replacing cement that\nwould otherwise have been the carbon intensive variety.\"\n\nSublime's cement is produced through a process developed at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology and pioneered by Ellis, with co-founder Yet-Ming\nChiang, an MIT professor also involved in a similar technology startup, the\niron-air battery producer Form Energy.\n\nThe cement is produced using electrochemical processes to make cement powder.\nSublime's cement-making technology can be fueled by renewable electricity and\nits processes allow electrons to break the ingredients down at room\ntemperature, rather than the traditional way of producing portland cement by\nheating limestone and clay, mixed with iron ore or fly ash, in a kiln up to\n2,700\u00b0F.\n\n\"That shift in how you define cement really lets you adopt innovative products\nthat may not be made in a fossil-fueled kiln that gives you a certain\ncrystalline composition,\" Ellis says.\n\nDavid Robb, a Turner estimator and the preconstruction manager on the Boston-\narea project, says there was nothing out of the ordinary about the concrete\nplacement on the project and that the material provided by BS&G using\nSublime's cement was tested for temperature and slump when it arrived in\nready-mix trucks just as it would have been on any other project.\n\nThe placement is being used by Sublime to validate several key aspects of the\nperformance of its cement in concrete in a commercial project. While only a\nsmall quantity of Sublime's cement was used on the project, it was mixed into\na ready-mix concrete truck, maintained workability during transit, was poured\nout of the concrete truck into a boom pump and pumped through the boom and a\nseries of rubber hoses and finally placed and finished in its final location\non-site to set as hardened concrete. All firsts for the material.\n\n\"In the grand scheme of things, it was, really, very boring for construction,\"\nRobb says. \"But it's it's a huge step in terms of our embodied carbon\nreduction goals that we're striving toward in the future here at Turner.\"\n\nHe says the seven-day breaks on the mud mat placement came back in line with\nplanned design strength. A mud mat is a layer of concrete beneath a structural\nconcrete floor or footing over softer, wetter soil.\n\nRobb, who heard about the Sublime in mid-2023, was looking for new\ntechnologies as a part of Turner's embodied carbon corporate commitment .\n\nTurner has a self-perform concrete group and Robb asked local project managers\nto inform him of any good opportunities to pilot a product with Sublime\ncement. In late January, a mud mat placement on a job with Turner self-\nperforming as concrete contractor and Boston Sand & Gravel as the vendor came\ntogether.\n\nEllis says Sublime provided its cement products to Boston Sand & Gravel who\nmixed it to required tolerances and sent the material out in trucks where it\nwas pumped 200 ft.\n\n\"We had an opportunity for low-risk placement,\" says Robb. \"These guys were\nthrown into the the gauntlet on a cold day in January pumping their material.\"\n\nSublime Systems received Department of Energy award of up to $87 million to\ncatalyze its commercial-scale, zero cement manufacturing technology March 25.\nThe award from the department\u2019s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED)\nwill be used for the construction of Sublime\u2019s first commercial manufacturing\nplant in Holyoke, Mass., the company said.\n\nKEYWORDS: Concrete low carbon materials Materials sustainability\n\n### Share This Story\n\nENR Midwest Editor and Associate Technology Editor Jeff Yoders has been\nwriting about design and construction innovations for 16 years.
