As an open-source project, it invites\ncollaboration and creativity from the community, allowing enthusiasts and\ndevelopers to contribute to its evolution. This aspect of open-source\ndevelopment adds a unique dimension to Thetawave, as it grows and diversifies\nwith inputs from its user base. Engaging in both gameplay and development,\nplayers and developers alike can experience the thrill of space combat while\nshaping the game's future.\n\n## Gameplay\n\n## Controls\n\nAction| Keyboard \ud83d\uddae| Controller \ud83c\udfae  \n---|---|---  \n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Movement| 'WASD' / Arrow Keys| D-Pad  \n\ud83d\udd2b Fire Weapon| Left Click / Spacebar| Right Bumper (RB)  \n\ud83d\udca5 Special Ability| Right Click / Shift| Left Bumper (LB)  \n  \n## How to Play\n\nObjective: Protect the planet from invading enemies!\n\nGame Over Conditions:\n\n  * When all players' health bars are depleted from damage.\n  * When the blue defense bar is depleted (occurs when enemies reach the bottom of the arena).\n\nPower-Ups:\n\nWrenches restore health.  \n---  \nGems increase fire rate.  \nArmor negates damage.  \nEnergy orbs give additional projectiles.  \n  \nSpecial Mechanics:\n\n  * Letting cargo hauler mobs reach the bottom of the arena heals the defense bar.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nWe welcome contributions from all community members.
