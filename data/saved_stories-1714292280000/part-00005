Millennials and Gen Zers face\nsky-high mortgage rates, soaring home prices and inflation, and it\u2019s slowing\nsome traditional, or otherwise historic, milestones like having a child.\n\nIndeed, women are starting families later and having fewer children\u2014with some\nforgoing starting a family altogether, according to a report released Thursday\nby the National Center for Health Statistics within the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention. But the most staggering statistic in the report is\nthat the U.S. total fertility rate hit a record low in 2023, falling to 1.62\nbirths per woman. That\u2019s well below the \u201creplacement rate,\u201d or the number of\nbirths needed to meet the number of older generations, of 2.1 births.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in our nation\u2019s history, a 30-year-old man or woman isn\u2019t\ndoing as well as his or her parents were at 30. That is the social compact\nbreaking down,\u201d Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern\nSchool of Business, said in a recent interview with Morning Joe. Only 27% of\nadults ages 30-to-34 have one child, he said, but in 1990 that percentage was\n60%.\n\n\u201cPeople are opting out of America,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cThey\u2019re not optimistic\nabout it. They\u2019re not having kids.\u201d Indeed, the National Center for Health\nStatistics report showed that birth rates declined for women aged 15 through\n39. Overall, there were about 3.59 million births in the U.S. in 2023, down 2%\nfrom 2022, according to the report.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, birth rates are declining at an even faster rate for minority\nwomen. General fertility declined 5% for Black women as well as American\nIndian and Alaska Native women and 3% for Asian women, according to the\nreport. That\u2019s largely driven by rising morbidity and mortality rates for\nwomen of color, Peggy Roberts, a board-certified women\u2019s health nurse\npractitioner licensed in New York, tells Fortune.\n\nThese trends \u201cinstill a sense of apprehension among women regarding the risks\nlinked with pregnancy and childbirth,\u201d she says. \u201cConsequently, women are\nopting to forgo the prospect of having children.\u201d\n\n## Why are fewer women having children?\n\nThere are a number of factors affecting the declining birth rate, but personal\nfinance and career choices continue to be top-of-mind for women in the years\ntraditionally committed to having children. Many women are delaying having\nchildren into their late 30s and 40s to get ahead in their career.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true for some of the most successful women in business,\nincluding Indra Nooyi, the former CEO of PepsiCo. While Nooyi undoubtedly had\nan illustrious career, she always felt guilty about balancing the care of her\ntwo daughters and work, she told Fortune at the 2014 Aspen Ideas Festival.\n\n\u201cThe biological clock and the career clock are in total conflict with each\nother,\u201d she said. Plus, women reach their peak earning years in their 40s, and\nthe prime employment age for women continues to rise, according to a 2023\nreport from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business.\n\nA woman\u2019s 30s and 40s are traditionally dedicated to career development, but\nthat timeframe also overlaps with when they\u2019re expected to have children,\nNooyi said. Kids become teenages as their mothers are promoted to middle\nmanagement, and \u201cthat\u2019s the time your husband becomes a teenager,\u201d she joked.\nPlus, as children grow older, that\u2019s also the time a mother\u2019s aging parents\nneed care, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re screwed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot have it all.\u201d\n\nMore women are \u201cvocalizing their choice to remain childless\u201dto pursue higher\neducation, said RobertsPlus, \u201cwomen express concerns about the lack of\navailable partners for forming long-term relationships and starting families.\u201d\n\nThe birth rate has also been affected by an increased awareness of\ncontraception, Janet Choi, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and\nchief medical officer at fertility care provider Progyny, tells Fortune. More\nwomen now have access to contraception and use it. \u201cThis can be especially\nsaid of long-acting reversible contraceptives in recent years,\u201d she says.\n\nSubscribe to The Broadsheet newsletter to stay updated on the world's most\npowerful women in business.
