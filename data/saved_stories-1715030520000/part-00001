Essays have been sub-\nclassified as formal and informal: formal essays are characterized by \"serious\npurpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\" whereas the informal essay is\ncharacterized by \"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and\nexperiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure,\nunconventionality or novelty of theme,\" etc.^[1]\n\nEssays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned\narguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the\nauthor. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have\nbeen dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism and An Essay\non Man). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John\nLocke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Malthus's An Essay\non the Principle of Population are counterexamples.\n\nIn some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a\nmajor part of formal education.^[2] Secondary students are taught structured\nessay formats to improve their writing skills; admission essays are often used\nby universities in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social\nsciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of\nstudents during final exams.\n\nThe concept of an \"essay\" has been extended to other media beyond writing. A\nfilm essay is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles\nand focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. A photographic essay\ncovers a topic with a linked series of photographs that may have accompanying\ntext or captions.\n\n## Definitions\n\nJohn Locke's 1690 An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\n\nThe word essay derives from the French infinitive essayer, \"to try\" or \"to\nattempt\". In English essay first meant \"a trial\" or \"an attempt\", and this is\nstill an alternative meaning. The Frenchman Michel de Montaigne (1533\u20131592)\nwas the first author to describe his work as essays; he used the term to\ncharacterize these as \"attempts\" to put his thoughts into writing.\n\nSubsequently, essay has been defined in a variety of ways. One definition is a\n\"prose composition with a focused subject of discussion\" or a \"long,\nsystematic discourse\".^[3] It is difficult to define the genre into which\nessays fall. Aldous Huxley, a leading essayist, gives guidance on the\nsubject.^[4] He notes that \"the essay is a literary device for saying almost\neverything about almost anything\", and adds that \"by tradition, almost by\ndefinition, the essay is a short piece\". Furthermore, Huxley argues that\n\"essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied\nmost effectively within a three-poled frame of reference\". These three poles\n(or worlds in which the essay may exist) are:\n\n  * The personal and the autobiographical: The essayists that feel most comfortable in this pole \"write fragments of reflective autobiography and look at the world through the keyhole of anecdote and description\".\n  * The objective, the factual, and the concrete particular: The essayists that write from this pole \"do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Their art consists of setting forth, passing judgment upon, and drawing general conclusions from the relevant data\".\n  * The abstract-universal: In this pole \"we find those essayists who do their work in the world of high abstractions\", who are never personal and who seldom mention the particular facts of experience.\n\nHuxley adds that the most satisfying essays \"...make the best not of one, not\nof two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to\nexist.\"\n\n## History\n\nThe examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide\nview of the subject.

(January 2011) (Learn how\nand when to remove this message)  \n---  \n  \n### Montaigne\n\nMontaigne's \"attempts\" grew out of his commonplacing.^[5] Inspired in\nparticular by the works of Plutarch, a translation of whose \u0152uvres Morales\n(Moral works) into French had just been published by Jacques Amyot, Montaigne\nbegan to compose his essays in 1572; the first edition, entitled Essais, was\npublished in two volumes in 1580.^[6] For the rest of his life, he continued\nrevising previously published essays and composing new ones. A third volume\nwas published posthumously; together, their over 100 examples are widely\nregarded as the predecessor of the modern essay.\n\n### Europe\n\nWhile Montaigne's philosophy was admired and copied in France, none of his\nmost immediate disciples tried to write essays. But Montaigne, who liked to\nfancy that his family (the Eyquem line) was of English extraction, had spoken\nof the English people as his \"cousins\", and he was early read in England,\nnotably by Francis Bacon.^[7]\n\nBacon's essays, published in book form in 1597 (only five years after the\ndeath of Montaigne, containing the first ten of his essays),^[7] 1612, and\n1625, were the first works in English that described themselves as essays. Ben\nJonson first used the word essayist in 1609, according to the Oxford English\nDictionary. Other English essayists included Sir William Cornwallis, who\npublished essays in 1600 and 1617 that were popular at the time,^[7] Robert\nBurton (1577\u20131641) and Sir Thomas Browne (1605\u20131682). In Italy, Baldassare\nCastiglione wrote about courtly manners in his essay Il Cortigiano. In the\n17th century, the Spanish Jesuit Baltasar Graci\u00e1n wrote about the theme of\nwisdom.^[8]\n\nIn England, during the Age of Enlightenment, essays were a favored tool of\npolemicists who aimed at convincing readers of their position; they also\nfeatured heavily in the rise of periodical literature, as seen in the works of\nJoseph Addison, Richard Steele and Samuel Johnson. Addison and Steele used the\njournal Tatler (founded in 1709 by Steele) and its successors as storehouses\nof their work, and they became the most celebrated eighteenth-century\nessayists in England. Johnson's essays appear during the 1750s in various\nsimilar publications.^[7] As a result of the focus on journals, the term also\nacquired a meaning synonymous with \"article\", although the content may not the\nstrict definition. On the other hand, Locke's An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding is not an essay at all, or cluster of essays, in the technical\nsense, but still it refers to the experimental and tentative nature of the\ninquiry which the philosopher was undertaking.^[7]\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, Edmund Burke and Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote\nessays for the general public. The early 19th century, in particular, saw a\nproliferation of great essayists in English\u2014William Hazlitt, Charles Lamb,\nLeigh Hunt and Thomas De Quincey all penned numerous essays on diverse\nsubjects, reviving the earlier graceful style. Thomas Carlyle's essays were\nhighly influential, and one of his readers, Ralph Waldo Emerson, became a\nprominent essayist himself. Later in the century, Robert Louis Stevenson also\nraised the form's literary level.^[9] In the 20th century, a number of\nessayists, such as T.S. Eliot, tried to explain the new movements in art and\nculture by using essays. Virginia Woolf, Edmund Wilson, and Charles du Bos\nwrote literary criticism essays.^[8]\n\nIn France, several writers produced longer works with the title of essai that\nwere not true examples of the form. However, by the mid-19th century, the\nCauseries du lundi, newspaper columns by the critic Sainte-Beuve, are literary\nessays in the original sense. Other French writers followed suit, including\nTh\u00e9ophile Gautier, Anatole France, Jules Lema\u00eetre and \u00c9mile Faguet.^[9]\n\n### Japan\n\nMain article: Zuihitsu\n\nAs with the novel, essays existed in Japan several centuries before they\ndeveloped in Europe with a genre of essays known as zuihitsu\u2014loosely connected\nessays and fragmented ideas. Zuihitsu have existed since almost the beginnings\nof Japanese literature. Many of the most noted early works of Japanese\nliterature are in this genre. Notable examples include The Pillow Book (c.\n1000), by court lady Sei Sh\u014dnagon, and Tsurezuregusa (1330), by particularly\nrenowned Japanese Buddhist monk Yoshida Kenk\u014d. Kenk\u014d described his short\nwritings similarly to Montaigne, referring to them as \"nonsensical thoughts\"\nwritten in \"idle hours\". Another noteworthy difference from Europe is that\nwomen have traditionally written in Japan, though the more formal, Chinese-\ninfluenced writings of male writers were more prized at the time.\n\n### China\n\nThe eight-legged essay (Chinese: \u516b\u80a1\u6587; pinyin: b\u0101g\u01d4w\u00e9n; lit. 'eight bone text')\nwas a style of essay in imperial examinations during the Ming and Qing\ndynasties in China. The eight-legged essay was needed for those test takers in\nthese civil service tests to show their merits for government service, often\nfocusing on Confucian thought and knowledge of the Four Books and Five\nClassics, in relation to governmental ideals. Test takers could not write in\ninnovative or creative ways, but needed to conform to the standards of the\neight-legged essay. Various skills were examined, including the ability to\nwrite coherently and to display basic logic. In certain times, the candidates\nwere expected to spontaneously compose poetry upon a set theme, whose value\nwas also sometimes questioned, or eliminated as part of the test material.\nThis was a major argument in favor of the eight-legged essay, arguing that it\nwere better to eliminate creative art in favor of prosaic literacy. In the\nhistory of Chinese literature, the eight-legged essay is often said to have\ncaused China's \"cultural stagnation and economic backwardness\" in the 19th\ncentury.^[10]\n\n## Forms and styles\n\nThis section describes the different forms and styles of essay writing. These\nare used by an array of authors, including university students and\nprofessional essayists.\n\n### Cause and effect\n\nThe defining features of a \"cause and effect\" essay are causal chains that\nconnect from a cause to an effect, careful language, and chronological or\nemphatic order. A writer using this rhetorical method must consider the\nsubject, determine the purpose, consider the audience, think critically about\ndifferent causes or consequences, consider a thesis statement, arrange the\nparts, consider the language, and decide on a conclusion.^[11]\n\n### Classification and division\n\nClassification is the categorization of objects into a larger whole while\ndivision is the breaking of a larger whole into smaller parts.^[12]\n\n### Compare and contrast\n\nCompare and contrast essays are characterized by a basis for comparison,\npoints of comparison, and analogies. It is grouped by the object (chunking) or\nby point (sequential). The comparison highlights the similarities between two\nor more similar objects while contrasting highlights the differences between\ntwo or more objects. When writing a compare/contrast essay, writers need to\ndetermine their purpose, consider their audience, consider the basis and\npoints of comparison, consider their thesis statement, arrange and develop the\ncomparison, and reach a conclusion. Compare and contrast is arranged\nemphatically.^[13]\n\n### Expository\n\nAn expository essay is used to inform, describe or explain a topic, using\nimportant facts to teach the reader about a topic. Mostly written in third-\nperson, using \"it\", \"he\", \"she\", \"they,\" the expository essay uses formal\nlanguage to discuss someone or something. Examples of expository essays are: a\nmedical or biological condition, social or technological process, life or\ncharacter of a famous person. The writing of an expository essay often\nconsists of the following steps: organizing thoughts (brainstorming),\nresearching a topic, developing a thesis statement, writing the introduction,\nwriting the body of essay, and writing the conclusion.^[14] Expository essays\nare often assigned as a part of SAT and other standardized testing or as\nhomework for high school and college students.\n\n### Descriptive\n\nDescriptive writing is characterized by sensory details, which appeal to the\nphysical senses, and details that appeal to a reader's emotional, physical, or\nintellectual sensibilities. Determining the purpose, considering the audience,\ncreating a dominant impression, using descriptive language, and organizing the\ndescription are the rhetorical choices to consider when using a description. A\ndescription is usually arranged spatially but can also be chronological or\nemphatic. The focus of a description is the scene. Description uses tools such\nas denotative language, connotative language, figurative language, metaphor,\nand simile to arrive at a dominant impression.^[15] One university essay guide\nstates that \"descriptive writing says what happened or what another author has\ndiscussed; it provides an account of the topic\".^[16] Lyric essays are an\nimportant form of descriptive essays.\n\n### Dialectic\n\nIn the dialectic form of the essay, which is commonly used in philosophy, the\nwriter makes a thesis and argument, then objects to their own argument (with a\ncounterargument), but then counters the counterargument with a final and novel\nargument. This form benefits from presenting a broader perspective while\ncountering a possible flaw that some may present. This type is sometimes\ncalled an ethics paper.^[17]\n\n### Exemplification\n\nAn exemplification essay is characterized by a generalization and relevant,\nrepresentative, and believable examples including anecdotes. Writers need to\nconsider their subject, determine their purpose, consider their audience,\ndecide on specific examples, and arrange all the parts together when writing\nan exemplification essay.^[18]\n\nMalthus' Essay on the Principle of Population\n\n### Familiar\n\nAn essayist writes a familiar essay if speaking to a single reader, writing\nabout both themselves, and about particular subjects. Anne Fadiman notes that\n\"the genre's heyday was the early nineteenth century,\" and that its greatest\nexponent was Charles Lamb.^[19] She also suggests that while critical essays\nhave more brain than the heart, and personal essays have more heart than\nbrain, familiar essays have equal measures of both.^[20]\n\n### History (thesis)\n\nA history essay sometimes referred to as a thesis essay describes an argument\nor claim about one or more historical events and supports that claim with\nevidence, arguments, and references. The text makes it clear to the reader why\nthe argument or claim is as such.^[21]\n\n### Narrative\n\nA narrative uses tools such as flashbacks, flash-forwards, and transitions\nthat often build to a climax. The focus of a narrative is the plot. When\ncreating a narrative, authors must determine their purpose, consider their\naudience, establish their point of view, use dialogue, and organize the\nnarrative. A narrative is usually arranged chronologically.^[22]\n\n### Argumentative\n\nAn argumentative essay is a critical piece of writing, aimed at presenting\nobjective analysis of the subject matter, narrowed down to a single topic. The\nmain idea of all the criticism is to provide an opinion either of positive or\nnegative implication. As such, a critical essay requires research and\nanalysis, strong internal logic and sharp structure. Its structure normally\nbuilds around introduction with a topic's relevance and a thesis statement,\nbody paragraphs with arguments linking back to the main thesis, and\nconclusion. In addition, an argumentative essay may include a refutation\nsection where conflicting ideas are acknowledged, described, and criticized.\nEach argument of an argumentative essay should be supported with sufficient\nevidence, relevant to the point.\n\n### Process\n\nA process essay is used for an explanation of making or breaking something.\nOften, it is written in chronological order or numerical order to show step-\nby-step processes. It has all the qualities of a technical document with the\nonly difference is that it is often written in descriptive mood, while a\ntechnical document is mostly in imperative mood.^[23]\n\n### Economic\n\nAn economic essay can start with a thesis, or it can start with a theme. It\ncan take a narrative course and a descriptive course. It can even become an\nargumentative essay if the author feels the need. After the introduction, the\nauthor has to do his/her best to expose the economic matter at hand, to\nanalyze it, evaluate it, and draw a conclusion. If the essay takes more of a\nnarrative form then the author has to expose each aspect of the economic\npuzzle in a way that makes it clear and understandable for the reader\n\n### Reflective\n\nA reflective essay is an analytical piece of writing in which the writer\ndescribes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought,\nmemory, or form\u2014adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the topic in\nthe author's life. Thus, the focus is not merely descriptive. The writer\ndoesn't just describe the situation, but revisits the scene with more detail\nand emotion to examine what went well, or reveal a need for additional\nlearning\u2014and may relate what transpired to the rest of the author's life.\n\n### Other logical structures\n\nThe logical progression and organizational structure of an essay can take many\nforms. Understanding how the movement of thought is managed through an essay\nhas a profound impact on its overall cogency and ability to impress. A number\nof alternative logical structures for essays have been visualized as diagrams,\nmaking them easy to implement or adapt in the construction of an\nargument.^[24]\n\n## Academic\n\nUniversity students, like these students doing research at a university\nlibrary, are often assigned essays as a way to get them to analyze what they\nhave read.\n\nMain article: Free response\n\nIn countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, essays have become\na major part of a formal education in the form of free response questions.\nSecondary students in these countries are taught structured essay formats to\nimprove their writing skills, and essays are often used by universities in\nthese countries in selecting applicants (see admissions essay). In both\nsecondary and tertiary education, essays are used to judge the mastery and\ncomprehension of the material. Students are asked to explain, comment on, or\nassess a topic of study in the form of an essay. In some courses, university\nstudents must complete one or more essays over several weeks or months. In\naddition, in fields such as the humanities and social sciences,^[citation\nneeded] mid-term and end of term examinations often require students to write\na short essay in two or three hours.\n\nIn these countries, so-called academic essays, also called papers, are usually\nmore formal than literary ones.^[citation needed] They may still allow the\npresentation of the writer's own views, but this is done in a logical and\nfactual manner, with the use of the first person often discouraged. Longer\nacademic essays (often with a word limit of between 2,000 and 5,000\nwords)^[citation needed] are often more discursive. They sometimes begin with\na short summary analysis of what has previously been written on a topic, which\nis often called a literature review.^[citation needed]\n\nLonger essays may also contain an introductory page that defines words and\nphrases of the essay's topic. Most academic institutions require that all\nsubstantial facts, quotations, and other supporting material in an essay be\nreferenced in a bibliography or works cited page at the end of the text. This\nscholarly convention helps others (whether teachers or fellow scholars) to\nunderstand the basis of facts and quotations the author uses to support the\nessay's argument. The bibliography also helps readers evaluate to what extent\nthe argument is supported by evidence and to evaluate the quality of that\nevidence. The academic essay tests the student's ability to present their\nthoughts in an organized way and is designed to test their intellectual\ncapabilities.\n\nOne of the challenges facing universities is that in some cases, students may\nsubmit essays purchased from an essay mill (or \"paper mill\") as their own\nwork. An \"essay mill\" is a ghostwriting service that sells pre-written essays\nto university and college students. Since plagiarism is a form of academic\ndishonesty or academic fraud, universities and colleges may investigate papers\nthey suspect are from an essay mill by using plagiarism detection software,\nwhich compares essays against a database of known mill essays and by orally\ntesting students on the contents of their papers.^[25]\n\n## Magazine or newspaper\n\nMain article: Long-form journalism\n\nEssays often appear in magazines, especially magazines with an intellectual\nbent, such as The Atlantic and Harpers. Magazine and newspaper essays use many\nof the essay types described in the section on forms and styles (e.g.,\ndescriptive essays, narrative essays, etc.). Some newspapers also print essays\nin the op-ed section.\n\nAn 1895 cover of Harpers, a US magazine that prints a number of essays per\nissue\n\n## Employment\n\nEmployment essays detailing experience in a certain occupational field are\nrequired when applying for some jobs, especially government jobs in the United\nStates. Essays known as Knowledge Skills and Executive Core Qualifications are\nrequired when applying to certain US federal government positions.\n\nA KSA, or \"Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities\", is a series of narrative\nstatements that are required when applying to Federal government job openings\nin the United States. KSAs are used along with resumes to determine who the\nbest applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The knowledge,\nskills, and abilities necessary for the successful performance of a position\nare contained on each job vacancy announcement. KSAs are brief and focused\nessays about one's career and educational background that presumably qualify\none to perform the duties of the position being applied for.\n\nAn Executive Core Qualification, or ECQ, is a narrative statement that is\nrequired when applying to Senior Executive Service positions within the US\nFederal government. Like the KSAs, ECQs are used along with resumes to\ndetermine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a\njob. The Office of Personnel Management has established five executive core\nqualifications that all applicants seeking to enter the Senior Executive\nService must demonstrate.\n\n## Non-literary types\n\nThis section is missing information about video essays.

(October 2023)  \n---  \n  \n### Film\n\nA film essay (also essay film or cinematic essay) consists of the evolution of\na theme or an idea rather than a plot per se, or the film literally being a\ncinematic accompaniment to a narrator reading an essay.^[26] From another\nperspective, an essay film could be defined as a documentary film visual basis\ncombined with a form of commentary that contains elements of self-portrait\n(rather than autobiography), where the signature (rather than the life story)\nof the filmmaker is apparent. The cinematic essay often blends documentary,\nfiction, and experimental film making using tones and editing styles.^[27]\n\nThe genre is not well-defined but might include propaganda works of early\nSoviet filmmakers like Dziga Vertov, present-day filmmakers including Chris\nMarker,^[28] Michael Moore (Roger & Me, Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit\n9/11), Errol Morris (The Thin Blue Line), Morgan Spurlock (Supersize Me) and\nAgn\u00e8s Varda. Jean-Luc Godard describes his recent work as \"film-essays\".^[29]\nTwo filmmakers whose work was the antecedent to the cinematic essay include\nGeorges M\u00e9li\u00e8s and Bertolt Brecht. M\u00e9li\u00e8s made a short film (The Coronation of\nEdward VII (1902)) about the 1902 coronation of King Edward VII, which mixes\nactual footage with shots of a recreation of the event. Brecht was a\nplaywright who experimented with film and incorporated film projections into\nsome of his plays.^[27] Orson Welles made an essay film in his own pioneering\nstyle, released in 1974, called F for Fake, which dealt specifically with art\nforger Elmyr de Hory and with the themes of deception, \"fakery\", and\nauthenticity in general.\n\nDavid Winks Gray's article \"The essay film in action\" states that the \"essay\nfilm became an identifiable form of filmmaking in the 1950s and '60s\". He\nstates that since that time, essay films have tended to be \"on the margins\" of\nthe filmmaking the world. Essay films have a \"peculiar searching, questioning\ntone ... between documentary and fiction\" but without \"fitting comfortably\"\ninto either genre. Gray notes that just like written essays, essay films \"tend\nto marry the personal voice of a guiding narrator (often the director) with a\nwide swath of other voices\".^[30] The University of Wisconsin Cinematheque\nwebsite echoes some of Gray's comments; it calls a film essay an \"intimate and\nallusive\" genre that \"catches filmmakers in a pensive mood, ruminating on the\nmargins between fiction and documentary\" in a manner that is \"refreshingly\ninventive, playful, and idiosyncratic\".^[31]\n\n### Music\n\nIn the realm of music, composer Samuel Barber wrote a set of \"Essays for\nOrchestra\", relying on the form and content of the music to guide the\nlistener's ear, rather than any extra-musical plot or story.\n\n### Photography\n\n\"After School Play Interrupted by the Catch and Release of a Stingray\" is a\nsimple time-sequence photo essay.\n\nA photographic essay strives to cover a topic with a linked series of\nphotographs. Photo essays range from purely photographic works to photographs\nwith captions or small notes to full-text essays with a few or many\naccompanying photographs. Photo essays can be sequential in nature, intended\nto be viewed in a particular order\u2014or they may consist of non-ordered\nphotographs viewed all at once or in an order that the viewer chooses. All\nphoto essays are collections of photographs, but not all collections of\nphotographs are photo essays. Photo essays often address a certain issue or\nattempt to capture the character of places and events.\n\n### Visual arts\n\nIn the visual arts, an essay is a preliminary drawing or sketch that forms a\nbasis for a final painting or sculpture, made as a test of the work's\ncomposition (this meaning of the term, like several of those following, comes\nfrom the word essay's meaning of \"attempt\" or \"trial\").\n\n## See also\n\n  * Abstract (summary)\n  * Body (writing)\n  * Book report\n  * Essay thesis\n  * Five-paragraph essay\n  * Introduction\n  * List of essayists\n  * SAT Essay\n  * Schaffer paragraph\n  * Treatise\n\n## References\n\n  1. ^ Holman, William (2003).
