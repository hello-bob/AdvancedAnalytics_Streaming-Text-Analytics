Her choices \u2013 different as they were \u2013\ncame with different trade-offs from mine. But they existed all the same.\n\nThe beauty in framing the conversation about the trade-offs is that we talked\nabout which trade-offs we had made peace with and which trade-offs we were\nstill struggling to deal with. We talked about how these trade-offs felt in\ncomparison to everything that was good.\n\nConversations about trade-offs have a way of capturing the nuances in this\nlife.\n\nAnd the nuances are where the richness and meaning lie.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Email\n\n### Related\n\nPainful trade-offsFebruary 25, 2024In \"Everything else\"\n\nWhat are the trade-offsOctober 2, 2023In \"Everything else\"\n\nTrade-offMay 19, 2021In \"Everything else\"\n\nPosted on April 26, 2024April 25, 2024Author alearningadayCategories\nEverything else\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * A Learning a Day\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
