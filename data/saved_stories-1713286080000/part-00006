For\nothers it's simply a way to move up the pay scale.\n\nBefore you start talking to your manager or applying for your next job it's\nworth considering what you're getting yourself into. Depending on where you\nwork there will be different definitions of a Development Team Leader (DTL).\nTo put this post in perspective this is my interpretation,\n\n> A Development Team Leader is someone who owns the technical delivery of a\n> solution. They need to understand the business drivers behind the project\n> and be able to lead a team of Developers to realise these drivers in working\n> software.They are (IMHO) the central player in a project team and need to\n> maintain excellent communication with all members of the team from Client to\n> Developers and everyone in between.\n\nI tend to distinguish between what I call a Senior Developer (SD) and a DTL. A\nSD is someone who still does the tasks of a developer but does them really\nwell and has lots of experience. They don't tend to have the added\nresponsibilities of a DTL. DTL's often (but not necessarily) have a SD\nbackground.\n\nAssuming you're a developer this is what I reckon your job entails.\n\nLet's face it the life of your average developer is focused around cutting\ncode. Sure you might have daily Scrums or other team meetings to attend but\nyour main focus is writing software. And you love it!\n\nWhen you become a DTL you work balance is up for a bit of a change.\n\nOther than the coding slice don't place to much attention on the relative\nweights of the pie slices - suffice to say you won't be zoning out for 8 hours\na day to your favourite tunes - you're the one that gets interrupted, you're\nthe one putting out the fires and making sure the wheels are oiled. Your head\nis on the line if the solution doesn't meet expectations or is delivered late.\nYou have some responsibilities and influence now.\n\n  * Coding - don't worry, you still get to practice your craft but just not as much as you used to. There are now lots of other things that you need to be involved in too.\n\n  * Documentation - even with the increasing popularity of Agile methodologies and a move away from excessive documentation there are still times when (technical) documentation is necessary - and guess what? You will be first in line to do it.\n\n  * Meetings - if you thought you were in lots of meetings as a developer then you ain't seen nothing yet. Depending on the size of the project you are involved in you will be the main participant in a wide variety of meetings. Whether it's a meeting with the client, the delivery team, the PM, you are the one with the most knowledge of both the requirements and the implementation of the solution.\n\n  * Communications - beyond official meetings you will also be heavily involved with communicating to others via emails, issue tracking software, the phone and face to face catch ups on progress. It's a bit of a cliche but good communication skills really are the key to succeeding in many professions - and for any leadership role it's essential.\n\n  * Delegation - because of your other duties it's an essential part of your role to be able to delegate work to others. Someone once told me that the job of the DTL is to make themselves redundant - an apparent contradiction to your pivotal role on the project but one that sums up the responsibility you have to ensure the project moves forward even when you can't personally be there to solve an issue. The more you delegate responsibility to others in your team the more involved and productive they become. Don't try and do everything yourself.\n\n  * Mentoring - part of reason for delegating tasks to others is to provide them with opportunities for personal growth and development. Mentoring carries this idea further and is a key part of your role. No-one is an island and you must be prepared to share your knowledge with others. As an aside you should also be prepared to learn from your team - DTL's who think they know it all are usually wrong and always disruptive to the morale and effectiveness of the team.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that if you love sitting in front of a\ncomputer coding up a storm with your headphones on then becoming a DTL may not\nbe where you want to go. However, if you're someone who loves being involved\nin the entire SDLC, has strong communication skills and enjoys the\nresponsibility of owning the delivery of a solution then sign up now.\n\n### Subscribe to kelsey\u2019s Substack\n\nBy Tom Jordell\n\nMy personal Substack\n\n1 Like\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Do you Really Want to Be a Development Team Leader?\n\nezalii.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Soumow Atitallah\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
