It was 1994, and Shor had just come up with a new\nalgorithm. His discovery unlocked efficient factoring of integers, destroying\ncryptographic algorithms like RSA if quantum computers ever were to become a\nreality. At the time, the quantum computer was just a theory, a concept of a\nnew class of computer based on quantum physics. The idea remained to be\nproven. In mid-2015, the National Security Agency (NSA) took everybody by\nsurprise after announcing their plans to transition to quantum-resistant\nalgorithms (cryptographic algorithms not vulnerable to quantum computers).\n\nFor those partners and vendors that have not yet made the transition to Suite\nB elliptic curve algorithms, we recommend not making a significant expenditure\nto do so at this point but instead to prepare for the upcoming quantum\nresistant algorithm transition. [. . .] Unfortunately, the growth of elliptic\ncurve use has bumped up against the fact of continued progress in the research\non quantum computing, which has made it clear that elliptic curve cryptography\nis not the long term solution many once hoped it would be. Thus, we have been\nobligated to update our strategy.\n\n## 14.1 What are quantum computers and why are they scaring cryptographers?\n\n### 14.1.1 Quantum mechanics, the study of the small\n\n### 14.1.2 From the birth of quantum computers to quantum supremacy\n\n### 14.1.3 The impact of Grover and Shor\u2019s algorithms on cryptography\n\n### 14.1.4 Post-quantum cryptography, the defense against quantum computers\n\n## 14.2 Hash-based signatures: Don\u2019t need anything but a hash function\n\n### 14.2.1 One-time signatures (OTS) with Lamport signatures\n\n### 14.2.2 Smaller keys with Winternitz one-time signatures (WOTS)\n\n### 14.2.3 Many-times signatures with XMSS and SPHINCS+\n\n## 14.3 Shorter keys and signatures with lattice-based cryptography\n\n### 14.3.1 What\u2019s a lattice?\n\n### 14.3.2 Learning with errors (LWE), a basis for cryptography?\n\n### 14.3.3 Kyber, a lattice-based key exchange\n\n### 14.3.4 Dilithium, a lattice-based signature scheme\n\nsitemap\n\nadd to cart\n\n\u00a9 2024 Manning Publications Co.\n\n\u00d7\n\n### Unable to load book!\n\nThe book could not be loaded.\n\n(try again in a couple of minutes)\n\nmanning.com homepage\n\nmy dashboard\n\nrecent reading\n\nshopping cart\n\nproducts\n\nall\n\nLB\n\nbooks\n\nLP\n\nprojects\n\nLV\n\nvideos\n\nLA\n\naudio\n\nM\n\nMEAP\n\nnew edition available\n\nThis edition is included with the purchase of the revised book.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
