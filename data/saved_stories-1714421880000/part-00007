The results are derived from 30 CMIP6 models under the\nSSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios.\n\n  * SSP1-2.6 scenario assumes that the development of renewable energy technology minimizes the use of fossil fuels (CO_2 Concentration of 432 ppm in 2100), leading to environmentally sustainable economic growth.\n  * SSP5-8.5 scenario assumes the high use of fossil fuels (CO_2 Concentration of 1089 ppm in 2100) and the indiscriminate development of cities, with a focus on rapid industrial technological advancements.\n\nMore detailed information on the models used is provided at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-23-0346.1\n\nZoom level changed to 1\n\n13008 total views , 740 views today\n\n  * MIT\n  * Parsons Laboratory\n  * CEE\n  * Contact\n  * Accessibility\n  * Login (for group members only)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
