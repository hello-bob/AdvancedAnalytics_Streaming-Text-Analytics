By the time of his death, he\u2019d\namassed a fortune\u2014and earned the admiration of seemingly everyone who met him.\n\nBy W.K. Stratton\n\nMay 2024 0\n\nOne day in the late 1930s, Daniel Webster Wallace\u2014\u201c80 John,\u201d as he was known\nin ranching circles\u2014rode his favorite horse, Blondie, from his Mitchell County\nranch to the Loraine post office. It was a familiar route for him in this\nmostly flat, sandy part of the state halfway between Midland and Abilene. He\nhad made the six-mile round trip dozens of times. Wallace collected his mail\nthen walked back to Blondie. In his time, 80 John had broken hundreds of\nbroncs. His tougher-than-bull-hide body had never failed him. But on this day,\nhe lacked the strength to swing his leg over the saddle. A group of men saw\nhim struggling and hustled over to lift 80 John onto Blondie.\n\nWallace was Black. The men who helped him were white. One might imagine that\nsuch a scene would have been jaw-dropping in Depression-era Texas, where white\nhostility toward people of color was common. But the West Texas cowboy culture\nof the time was distinctive. Men of different races often supported and\nrespected one another. And no cowboy was more respected than Wallace.\n\nIn fact he was one of the most remarkable figures in our history. By the time\nof his death from influenza and pneumonia in 1939, Wallace had built a West\nTexas ranch of 8,800 acres and amassed a personal fortune purported to be more\nthan a million dollars\u2014equivalent to about $22 million today. He brought about\ntechnical innovations that are still used and devoted much of his savings to\nstrengthening his community\u2014all at a time when it would have been difficult\nfor a white man, much less a Black man born enslaved, to accomplish any of\nthat.\n\nYet few have heard of him today. Last year I attended the awards banquet at\nthe National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum, in Oklahoma City, at which\nWallace was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners, joining such\nluminaries as Buffalo Bill and U.S. Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor.\nI pride myself on being knowledgeable about the Old West, but I hadn\u2019t heard\nof 80 John until that night, nor had many other attendees.\n\n### Popular Videos\n\nMeet the Man of Steel Behind Austin\u2019s Tomii Cycles\n\nNao Tomii takes us along for the ride as he applies his background in\nsculpture to creating one-of-a-kind bikes in his studio.\n\nMore Videos\n\n0 seconds of 34 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nNext Up\n\nThe Lone Bookstore in a Town With No Library\n\n00:31\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n00:34\n\n00:34\n\nMeet the Man of Steel Behind Austin\u2019s Tomii Cycles\n\nmore\n\n#### Meet the Man of Steel Behind Austin\u2019s Tomii Cycles\n\nmore\n\n#### The Lone Bookstore in a Town With No Library\n\nmore\n\n#### A Texas Artist Creates Detailed Images With Nothing but Her Lips\n\nmore\n\n#### Jeffie Brewer Creates Giant Metalworks for the Kids Inside Us All\n\nmore\n\n#### The Story Behind a 70-Foot Concrete Arrow Near Odessa\n\nmore\n\n#### The Black Cowboy Museum, in Rosenberg, Fills an Important Gap\n\nmore\n\n#### Med School Can Wait.

And it\u2019s not just recognition for my\ngreat-grandfather. There have been a lot of cowboys of color, and their\nstories don\u2019t get told.\u201d\n\nLarry Callies, founder of the Black Cowboy Museum, in Rosenberg, believes that\nthe Houston region is the birthplace of the American cowboy. \u201cThe word\n\u2018cowboy\u2019 itself began being used in Fort Bend County and the surrounding area\nin 1821,\u201d Callies says. \u201cIt was applied to Black slaves who worked with\ncattle.\u201d (He notes that just as an enslaved person who worked inside the\nmansion would be referred to as a \u201chouseboy,\u201d one who took care of cattle was\nreferred to as a \u201ccowboy.\u201d Even decades later, the term \u201ccowboy\u201d remained\nunpopular with white cowpunchers because of its racial connotations.) As early\nas the 1840s, Black men who were enslaved rounded up free-range Longhorns on\nthe plains west of Houston and drove them north across Indian Territory to\nKansas, establishing Texas\u2019s fabled cattle-drive era. 80 John\u2019s story emerges\nfrom this rich culture.\n\nHe was born in 1860 on a two-hundred-acre farm outside Inez, in Victoria\nCounty, not far from the Gulf Coast, to parents who were enslaved. His mother,\nMary Wallace, had been bought by the farm\u2019s owners, Mary and Josiah O\u2019Daniel,\nto serve as a maid and wet nurse. His father, William Wallace, worked as a\nfarmhand. The O\u2019Daniels put young Wallace to work in the fields as a small\nchild, and he received virtually no formal education. \u201cSchools were scarce,\u201d\nhe told his daughter in the 1930s. \u201cI received most of my learning by contact\nwith others and observation.\u201d 80 John and his family remained enslaved until\nthe Juneteenth emancipation announcement, in 1865.\n\nThe following year, the O\u2019Daniels moved to a larger farm about eighty miles\nnorth, outside Flatonia, taking the Wallace family with them\u2014this time as paid\nemployees. The families maintained ties for the next seventy years; 80 John\nstayed in touch with the O\u2019Daniels\u2019 sons, M. H. and Dial, until his death.\n\nMary Wallace saved her coins with the intent of someday buying real estate.\nThe lesson was not lost on 80 John, who from an early age dreamed of owning a\nspread. He loathed chopping cotton for someone else.\n\nCattle drives often passed through the area, and Wallace decided they were his\nescape route, since many of the cowboys he saw were Black. One predawn morning\nin March 1876, he ran away from the O\u2019Daniel farm and joined a crew moving\ncattle nearly three hundred miles northwest, to Buffalo Gap. Wallace was a\ngreen hand when he departed Flatonia. By the time the herd reached its\ndestination, he had plenty of experience at \u201ctrailing.\u201d Thereafter, work was\nnot hard to find.\n\n\u201cHe rode for the most famous and respected cattle barons of these seminal days\nof the Texas cattle industry,\u201d says his great-grandson Alfred McMichael, who,\nalong with his son, Keir, hosts a website devoted to 80 John. \u201cHe rode every\nmajor cattle trail, from the Chisholm Trail to the Goodnight-Loving Trail. He\nmade long, daring solo rides.\u201d None of it was easy. He contended with\nthunderstorms, blizzards, droughts, dust storms, outlaw gangs, poisonous\nsnakes, disease, infection, sunstroke, lack of food and water, stampedes, and\nskirmishes with Native Americans. Once he spent days tracking a handful of\nComanches who had stolen one of his favorite horses.\n\n\u201cA friend recommended that I read Lonesome Dove,\u201d McMichael says. \u201cI got a\nsense of what my great-grandfather\u2019s life on the cattle ranges was like from\nreading about Joshua Deets.\u201d Deets was the much-respected Black cowboy\nportrayed by Danny Glover in the TV rendition of Larry McMurtry\u2019s novel. On\nthe other hand, 80 John\u2019s time on the trails was nothing like the world\nportrayed in the vast majority of Hollywood westerns, in which all of the\ncharacters\u2014other than the \u201cevil Indians\u201d\u2014are white.\n\n\u201cEven now, in 2024, a lot of people aren\u2019t aware of how diverse cowboy culture\nwas,\u201d says Robert Tidwell, interim director of collections, exhibits, and\nresearch at Texas Tech\u2019s National Ranching Heritage Center, in Lubbock. \u201cThe\nmain concern on a ranch is, Can you do the job? Can you pull your own weight?\nAnd when that\u2019s the main criteria, you\u2019d be surprised at how things shake out.\nYou had more tolerance than you\u2019d find in other places where social structures\nwere more defined. Between twenty and thirty percent of cowboys were Black.\u201d A\ncomparable number of ethnic Mexicans worked on the cattle trail.\n\nStill, 80 John did occasionally run into racists, and he refused to tolerate\nthem. His daughter Hettye Wallace Branch writes in her book, The Story of \u201c80\nJohn,\u201d that one white man bullied him at a cow camp in West Texas. The six-\nfoot-three 80 John responded by whupping the offender in a fistfight, which\napparently instilled respect in his adversary. Improbable as it seems, the two\nmen developed a friendship.\n\nIn 1878 a letter informed Wallace that his mother, whom he had not seen since\nleaving the O\u2019Daniels\u2019 farm, two years earlier, was deathly ill. He hurried\nback home but arrived too late. He settled his mother\u2019s estate\u2014which included\na few acres she had bought\u2014and then returned to West Texas, where he went to\nwork for Clay Mann. Neither man\u2019s life would be the same.\n\nDaniel Webster Wallace\u2019s employer, Clay Mann, and his wife, Mary Mann, in\n1871.Courtesy of Scurry County Museum\n\nThough largely forgotten now, Mann was a prototype for the white Texas\nwheeler-dealer. In his time he was a legend in cow camps throughout the West,\na figure who had, as a teenager, started a cattle herd and killed his father\u2019s\nmurderer. At one point Mann owned tens of thousands of cattle and thousands of\nacres in Texas, New Mexico, and Wyoming. He also owned a 600,000-acre ranch in\nMexico.\n\nBut there was a problem.\n\n\u201cNow, Clay, he liked to drink, and he liked to gamble,\u201d his great-grandson Tom\n\u201cPossum\u201d Mann tells me. \u201cHe loved to play a game called Mexican Monte, which\nwas popular in the West at the time. He might win ten thousand dollars in a\nnight, then lose it the next night.\u201d Mann knew he needed someone in his outfit\nwho was levelheaded and trustworthy. 80 John fit the bill. \u201c80 John didn\u2019t\ndrink or gamble or anything,\u201d Possum says. Soon Wallace and Mann were heading\nup large drives from Texas to cattle towns throughout the Midwest.\n\n\u201cAt the end of a drive,\u201d Possum says, \u201cClay would pay the hands then give most\nof the leftover money to 80 John to take back to Clay\u2019s wife, Mary Mann, in\nMitchell County. She\u2019d deposit it in the bank he founded in Colorado City.\nClay would stay behind with some of the money to gamble and eventually catch a\ntrain home.\u201d Mann once gave Wallace $30,000 (the equivalent of $900,000 today)\nin cash to take to Midland, a three-day ride west from Mann\u2019s ranch. 80 John\nmade sure the money arrived safely.\n\nMann\u2019s operations were extensive enough that he registered 43 cattle brands,\nincluding, most famously, a huge number 80. Wallace oversaw the burning of\nthat brand onto Mann\u2019s stock, and cattlemen associated him with it. \u201cIn West\nTexas,\u201d Tidwell says, \u201cthe name \u2018John\u2019 was sort of a generic term for cowhands\nin general.\u201d Hence the nickname 80 John.\n\nWallace\u2019s expertise extended to more than branding and bronc busting. Mann\ndiscovered his top employee was freakishly good at arithmetic. He could add\ncolumns of numbers in his head, which proved especially useful when it came to\nfinancial transactions. \u201cI have a method of figuring of my own which has stood\nme in good stead,\u201d 80 John told his daughter. \u201cVery seldom I have missed\nanything due me any larger than a fraction.\u201d He could also scan a pasture with\nhundreds of cattle and produce a head count that was usually off by fewer than\na dozen animals.\n\nEarly in their business relationship, Wallace told Mann that his goal in life\nwas to own land and a herd. Mann began setting aside the lion\u2019s share of 80\nJohn\u2019s pay to accomplish that. Bit by bit, Wallace acquired cattle as he\ncontinued working for Mann. Among his other responsibilities, Wallace was the\nde facto foreman of many of Mann\u2019s properties. Even amid the relative racial\ncomity of cowboy culture it was extraordinarily unusual\u2014perhaps\nunprecedented\u2014for a Black man to oversee white ranch hands.\n\nIn 1885, Wallace had saved enough to buy 1,280 acres of railroad land south of\nLoraine, intending to homestead it. Realizing he needed to learn how to read\nand write before he could become a successful rancher, he enrolled as a second\ngrader at a segregated Black school in Navarro County, almost three hundred\nmiles east of his newly acquired land. Over two terms of studying alongside\nchildren, he became functionally literate. He also met and fell in love with\nLaura Dee Owens, a Corsicana beauty who was finishing high school. They were\nmarried in 1888 and remained together until his death almost 51 years later.\nLaura sacrificed her plans to teach in order to help him build a ranch from\nscratch. They started life as a married couple in a two-room cabin on one of\nMann\u2019s ranches.\n\nIn 1889, 80 John\u2019s world was turned upside down when Mann died from a stomach\nhemorrhage, caused by decades of hard drinking. Wallace took charge of the\ncattle operations and became a father figure to Mann\u2019s sons, teaching them the\nfundamentals of ranching. The Wallace and Mann families established a bond\nthat continued through generations. (Fowler, Wallace\u2019s great-granddaughter,\nsays Mann\u2019s great-great-granddaughter, Becca Mann George, was her childhood\nbest friend, and they remain close.)\n\nWallace\u2019s wife, Laura Dee Owens Wallace, with two of their grandchildren,\ncirca 1918.Courtesy of the Wallace family\n\nOver the next decades, 80 John and Laura lived as frugally as possible and\nsaved every dime they could to buy more land and cattle. They made for an\nideal partnership. He was good with numbers, while she was more verbal. She\ncould parse the thickest contracts and deeds and then read the salient points\naloud to her husband. Wallace had a near-photographic memory when it came to\nbusiness matters. In meeting with lawyers, he could quote passages verbatim\nthat Laura had read to him. She also took charge of treating sick and injured\nlivestock. Whenever 80 John had to be absent to tend to business, she ran the\nranch by herself.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Fowler says, \u201cwhat it was like in the late 1800s and\nearly 1900s with that pressure of being the only Black rancher out here.\nSometimes I\u2019ll go by the cemetery and I\u2019ll smile thinking about what he and\nLaura did.\u201d\n\nAs early as 1903, Wallace was admitted to the Cattle Raisers Association of\nTexas and became a highly regarded member. He was, so far as I can tell, the\nonly Black man during that era who was invited to join the group. To attend\neach year, he had to board a segregated passenger car at the Colorado City\nrailroad station to travel to Fort Worth. He had to find lodging at a so-\ncalled colored hotel. From there he walked to the whites-only hotel that\nhosted the convention. During one of his train trips, some of his white\nrancher friends joined him for conversation in the segregated passenger car.\nThe conductor attempted to remove the white men, but one refused to budge. \u201cI\nhave known 80 John for thirty years,\u201d the cattleman said. \u201cWe ate and slept on\nthe ground together. I see no reason that makes it impossible for me to sit\nhere now.\u201d\n\nOne of Wallace\u2019s homes, now preserved at the National Ranching Heritage\nCenter, in Lubbock.Sue Hancock Jones/Courtesy of National Ranching Heritage\nCenter\n\nThe Wallaces eventually lived in a four-room house that 80 John designed and\nbuilt himself. It has since been moved to the grounds of the National Ranching\nHeritage Center and restored to its original condition. Wallace disdained\nautomobiles, airplanes, telephones, gramophones, and indoor plumbing. \u201cBut he\nwas ahead of his time when it came to raising cattle,\u201d says Mark Merrell, a\nretired Mitchell County judge and educator. The man who started out herding\nwild Longhorns ended up crossbreeding Herefords and Durhams (Shorthorns),\ndecades before doing so became commonplace.\n\nHe also was an early adopter of windmill technology in West Texas (one of his\nwindmills is on display at the American Windmill Museum, in Lubbock) and\ncreated sophisticated concrete watering troughs that other ranchers copied. As\nthe couple became more affluent, they contributed to Mitchell County\ncharities, including paying the construction costs for a Baptist church in\nLoraine. They also built the Wallace namesake school, in Colorado City, that\nprovided area Black children their only access to education.\n\nIn the 1930s, 80 John and Laura drew up a will that put the ranch into a\ntrust. Their primary goal was to provide education funding for subsequent\ngenerations of their family. They also wanted to keep the ranch intact. The\nproperty is now held by seven trusts. \u201cEach one of the members of the family\nmakes it very specific: don\u2019t sell the land, except to a family member,\u201d says\nDwayne Harris, who, as trust officer at City National Bank, managed the ranch\nfor more than twenty years before his retirement. \u201cWe had cattle-grazing\nleases and oil leases as well as revenue from cotton fields, a gravel quarry,\nand, more recently, wind turbines.\u201d Harris estimates the ranch\u2019s value at $15\nmillion.\n\nIt\u2019s said that around the time Wallace made that mail trip on Blondie, he sank\na post in the sandy loam on his property and announced he wanted to be buried\nat that exact spot. The tombstone that now sits in the middle of the family\ngraveyard replaced the post more than eight decades ago. Even facing death, 80\nJohn proved to be a man who knew what he wanted\u2014and achieved it, stampedes and\nracism be damned.\n\nAustin writer W. K.
