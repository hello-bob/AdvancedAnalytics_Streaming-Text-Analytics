The Sierra Space Ghost Beta\ndecelerator, part of the company\u2019s recently announced Sierra Space\nAxeleratorTM incubator, is a cutting-edge thermal protection system tailored\nfor the safe return of small payloads from space. See video here and download\nphotos here.\n\nLast month, the first drop test of the Sierra Space Ghost was completed in\nFlorida, enabling Sierra Space test engineers to fully understand the flight\ncharacteristics of the system and how recovery operations can be rapidly\ncompleted on the ground.\n\n> \u201cAs we continue to innovate at speed, this test enables us to build, test,\n> learn and accelerate the development of a revolutionary new operational\n> asset for national security,\u201d said Tom Vice, CEO of Sierra Space. \u201cWe\n> envision having an inventory of Sierra Space Ghost vehicles strategically\n> positioned and readily accessible and deployable within 90 minutes to\n> critical locations anywhere on Earth. Sierra Space Ghost enables our\n> customers to deliver vital resources to frontline personnel with\n> unparalleled precision and speed.\u201d\n\nThe ability to deliver critical supplies within 90 minutes to any location on\nEarth is a game-changing technology that could potentially turn the tide of a\nconflict. With this new technology, the warfighter on the ground could order\npre-staged supplies that are waiting in an on-orbit inventory, or positioned\nwith rapid launch capability, and deploy them down to Earth within 100 yards\nof where they are needed.\n\nSierra Space performed a series of three drop tests on February 1 at Space\nFlorida\u2019s storied Launch and Landing Facility (LLF) in Florida, one of the\nlongest runways in the world and where most of NASA\u2019s space shuttle orbiters\nended their missions. With the support of the Florida-based company Operator\nSolutions, three test articles were dropped from a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter to\nensure stable flight for the hardware at subsonic speeds. Sierra Space will\nscale-up to hypersonic in upcoming tests.\n\nThe entire testing campaign came together in 90 days as part of Sierra Space\u2019s\nAxelerator incubator charter. Key highlights included:\n\n  * Terminal drop (no parachute) of the first test article from an altitude of 2,000 feet, assessing impact dynamics and payload integrity\n  * Deployment of a parachute-equipped test article from 4,000 feet, demonstrating controlled descent and precise landing proximity\n  * Separation of shield and payload components in the third test article, showcasing advanced payload return capabilities\n\nSierra Space Axelerator is the company\u2019s innovation-at-speed incubator\ndesigned to fast-track the development of revolutionary defense technologies\nand mission solutions. The Axelerator incubator is part of Sierra Space\u2019s\nOrbital Missions and Services organization, founded in 2023 to focus on\ninnovative national security solutions. Sierra Space has since been awarded\n$1.3 billion in prime satellite constellations contracts.\n\nThe Sierra Space Ghost will now continue through a robust beta testing\nprogram, developing operations in real time. Beta testing allows the Sierra\nSpace test team to consider the infrastructure and architecture needed to\noperate the spacecraft, as well as the communications system, the data system\nand the recording of every facet of operations.\n\nAdditional background on Sierra Space Ghost:\n\n  * On-orbit time of five years, vehicles are outfitted with pre-determined supplies (a survival kit, inflatable boat, rations, weaponry, etc.) pre-staged on orbit\n  * On call-up, the system re-orients and begins re-entry/targeting cycle; the de-orbit motor slows the vehicle to 7,000 meters per second\n  * Gravity then captures the vehicle and it begins to re-enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere with the thermal protection shield withstanding temperatures up to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit\n  * Once through atmosphere, the shield is then discarded leaving just the requested payload and a parafoil\n  * At the right altitude, the parafoil is released and it steers the payload to the required area within 100 meters\n\nAbout Sierra Space\n\nSierra Space is a leading commercial space company at the forefront of\ninnovation and the commercialization of space in the Orbital Age\u00ae, building an\nend-to-end business and technology platform in space to benefit life on Earth.\nWith more than 30 years and 500 missions of space flight heritage, the company\nis reinventing both space transportation with Dream Chaser\u00ae, the world\u2019s only\ncommercial spaceplane, and the future of space destinations with the company\u2019s\ninflatable and expandable space station technology. Using commercial business\nmodels, the company is also delivering orbital services to commercial, DoD and\nnational security organizations, expanding production capacity to meet the\nneeds of constellation programs. In addition, Sierra Space builds a host of\nsystems and subsystems across solar power, mechanics and motion control,\nenvironmental control, life support, propulsion and thermal control, offering\nmyriad space-as-a-service solutions for the new space economy.\n\n###\n\nMEDIA CONTACTS:\n\nAlex Walker, Sierra Space (303) 803-2297 | alex.walker@sierraspace.com\n\nPrevPrevious\n\nLinkedin Instagram Youtube Twitter Facebook-f\n\nSierra Space Corporation^\u00ae\n\n##### Company\n\n  * About\n  * Leadership\n  * Patents\n  * Investors\n  * Contact\n\n  * Careers\n  * Ventures\n  * Human Spaceflight\n  * Hardware Catalog\n  * Store\n\n##### Capabilities\n\n  * Dream Chaser Spaceplanes\n  * Space Stations\n  * Space Technology\n\n##### Media\n\n  * News\n  * Blog\n  * Media Hub\n\nAll Rights Reserved \u00a9 2024 Sierra Space Corporation | Privacy | Terms of Use\n\nNotifications\n\nPrevious Slide\n\nNext Slide\n\n", "frontpage": false}
