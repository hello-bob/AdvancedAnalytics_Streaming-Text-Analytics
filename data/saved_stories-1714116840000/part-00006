After I joined the IE\nteam in 2004, I fell in love with a browser extension written by Ralph Hare\nand I later blogged about it on the IEBlog and helped Ralph get it running in\n64bit IE.\n\nMany years passed. By 2015, I had abandoned the outdated IE and moved to\nChrome fulltime. When I joined the Chrome team in 2016, I was heartened to\nnote that mouse gestures were one of the very few features slated for\ninclusion in the first version of Chrome. They were repeatedly postponed and\neventually cut, with the idea that perhaps a browser extension was the way to\ngo. I installed the most popular Mouse Gestures extension from the Chrome web\nstore only to later discover that it was sending my browser traffic to a\nquestionable server in China. I uninstalled it and reported it to the Chrome\nWeb Store folks who delisted it. Apparently a while later they slightly\nreduced the data leakage and got it back up on the Web Store, and in 2019 a\nnew hire PM lead on the Edge team suggested we all install it. I took a look\nat what it was doing and found that it was still engaged in questionable\nprivacy practices. Bummer.\n\nFast forward to earlier this year, when I discovered that the Edge team has\nlanded gestures in Edge on Windows! I was excited to see the implementation,\nand feel like it\u2019s one of several features that makes Edge feel like it\u2019s a\nbatteries-included browser. (Unfortunately, this feature presently seems to be\nWindows-only. If you\u2019re using a Mac or Linux, you should click the menu ...\n>Help and Feedback > Send Feedback to ask for it.)\n\nDozens (hundreds?) of times a day, I enjoy the satisfaction of closing browser\ntabs by right-click-drawing a \u201cL\u201d on them.\n\nTo enable Mouse Gestures support in Edge, simply visit edge://flags/#edge-\nmouse-gesture and enable the feature:\n\nAfter you restart the browser you can go visit the\nedge://settings/mouseGesture page to configure them:\n\nDon\u2019t worry about memorizing a ton of shortcuts \u2014 I really only use two: back\n(right-click+left-drag) and close tab (right-click+DrawL).\n\nI smile every time this works, and every time I test something in Chrome I\nlament their absence.\n\n-Eric\n\nPS: Besides support for Mac OS, one other missing feature I\u2019d love to see is\nthe ability to bind a gesture to an extension or JavaScript-bookmarklet. That\nwould allow me to recreate one of my other IE-era gestures\u2013 I could waggle my\nmouse to run a JavaScript which would remove all ad-like elements from a page.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPosted byericlaw2024-04-232024-04-24Posted inbrowsers, webTags:Chrome, Edge,\nextensions\n\n## Published by ericlaw\n\nImpatient optimist.

Thomas Levesque says:\n\n2024-04-23 at 20:55\n\nNo, with the left. I didn\u2019t read carefully so I thought the gestures where\ndone with the left button. So I guess it could work for me after all!\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n## Search Text/Plain\n\n## Pages\n\n  * About\n  * Browse All Posts\n  * Categories\n  * IEInternals Archive\n\n## RSS\n\nRSS - Posts\n\n## Blog Stats\n\n  * 2,212,109 hits\n\n## Categories\n\n#### ericlaw\n\nImpatient optimist.
