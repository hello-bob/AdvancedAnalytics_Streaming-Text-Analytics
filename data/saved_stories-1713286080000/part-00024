It\u2019s like the end of the world in the middle of the Atlantic. Five\ndays, with a northwesterly course, and only then do the sheer black cliffs\nappear in front of RMS St. Helena. The island\u2019s 4500 residents are often\nwaiting impatiently for the ship\u2019s arrival and panic if the schedule changes.\nDirector Thomas Denzel and his team went on the journey to Saint Helena and\nmet the people living on the island. Many of the residents are descendants of\npeople who were sent into exile there by the British crown - the most famous\namong them, the French Emperor Napoleon. This is a report about life at the\nend of the world, loneliness, unique vegetation, and a very special journey.\n_______ Exciting, powerful and informative \u2013 DW Documentary is always close to\ncurrent affairs and international events.
