It is said to have been extended by the lack of a\npeace treaty for 335 years without a single shot being fired, which would make\nit one of the world's longest wars, and a bloodless war. Despite the uncertain\nvalidity of the declaration of war, and thus uncertainty about whether or not\na state of war ever actually existed, peace was finally declared in 1986,\nbringing an end to any hypothetical war that may have been legally considered\nto exist.\n\n## War[edit]\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\nThe origins of the war can be found in the English Civil War, fought between\nthe Royalists and Parliamentarians from 1642 to 1651.^[1] Oliver Cromwell had\nfought the Royalists to the edges of the Kingdom of England. In the West of\nBritain this meant that Cornwall was the last Royalist stronghold. In 1648,\nCromwell pushed on until mainland Cornwall was in the hands of the\nParliamentarians. The Royalist Navy was forced to retreat to the Isles of\nScilly, which lay off the Cornish coast and were under the ownership of\nRoyalist John Granville.^[2]\n\n### Dutch Navy alliance[edit]\n\nThe navy of the United Provinces of the Netherlands was at the time allied\nwith the Parliamentarians. The Netherlands had been assisted by the English\nunder a number of rulers in the Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648), starting with\nQueen Elizabeth I. The Treaty of M\u00fcnster (30 January 1648) had confirmed Dutch\nindependence from Spain. The Netherlands sought to maintain their alliance\nwith England and had chosen to ally with the Parliamentarians as the side\nlikely to win the Civil War.^[2]\n\nThe Dutch merchant navy was suffering heavy losses from the Royalist fleet\nbased in Scilly. On 30 March 1651, Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Harpertszoon\nTromp arrived in Scilly to demand reparation from the Royalist fleet for the\nDutch ships and goods taken by them.^[2]\n\nAccording to Whitelocke's Memorials, a letter of 17 April 1651 explains:\n\"Tromp came to Pendennis and related that he had been to Scilly to demand\nreparation for the Dutch ships and goods taken by them; and receiving no\nsatisfactory answer, he had, according to his Commission, declared war on\nthem.\" As most of England was now in Parliamentarian hands, war was declared\nspecifically upon the Isles of Scilly.^[3]\n\n### Royalist surrender[edit]\n\nIn June 1651, soon after the declaration of war, the Parliamentarian forces\nunder Admiral Robert Blake forced the Royalist fleet to surrender. The Dutch\nfleet, no longer under threat, left without firing a shot. Due to the\nobscurity of one nation's declaration of war against a small part of another,\nthe Dutch did not officially declare peace.^[2] When the Dutch and the\nCommonwealth of England signed the Treaty of Westminster (1654), this separate\nstate of war was not mentioned and thus not included in the peace.\n\n### Peace treaty[edit]\n\nFor many years in the Isles of Scilly, the local legend was that the state of\nwar was still in effect.^[4] In 1986, Roy Duncan, historian and Chairman of\nthe Isles of Scilly Council, decided to investigate and wrote to the Dutch\nEmbassy in London. Embassy staff found that no peace treaty had ever been\nsigned, and Duncan invited the Dutch ambassador Jonkheer Rein Huydecoper to\nvisit the islands and officially end the \"conflict\". Peace was declared on 17\nApril 1986, 335 years after the supposed declaration of war. The Dutch\nambassador joked that it must have been horrifying to the Scillonians \"to know\nwe could have attacked at any moment.\"^[5]\n\n## Authenticity[edit]\n\nBowley (2001) argues that the letter in Whitelocke's Memorials^[6] is the\nprobable origin of the \"declaring war\" legend: \"Tromp had no 'Commission' from\nhis government to declare war on the rebels in Scilly; but he did come to try\n\u2013 by a show of force, threats and even by violence perhaps, although this\nnever happened \u2013 to seek reparation for Royalist piracies, but short of\nresorting to any action which might offend the Commonwealth even if [a war]\nhad occurred in 1651, all matters pertaining would have been resolved in 1654\nas a part of the treaty between England and the United Provinces at the end of\nthe First Dutch War\".^[3]\n\nThe reality of this war is also disputed by Graeme Donald. In his book Loose\nCannons: 101 Myths, Mishaps and Misadventurers of Military History he argues\nthat no such war could have existed because neither side was sovereign: \"Tromp\nwas an admiral, not a nation, and Scilly part of England\". He goes on to\ndescribe it as \"a great PR coup for the island's tourist board\".^[7]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Cornwall portal\n\n  * List of wars extended by diplomatic irregularity\n  * Arauco War (1536\u20131881), another example of a very long war\n  * Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War, generally considered the world's shortest war\n\nIt's not true that no shots were fired. Shots were fired in 1667 when Admiral\nDe Ruyter attacked the islands. He took the Island of St. Agnes as his base\nand mounted an attack on St. Marys. His ships came under the guns of the\nGarrison and Star Castle, and as they passed, the engagement began. However,\nthe tide was against a landing on Porthmellon & Town Beach, so De Ruyter\nturned his ships around with the intention to try again later. Two Dutch\nvessels were reported as damaged during the fighting. The next day, a storm\nblew up, forcing the Dutch fleet out to sea, and there ended the only time the\ntwo exchanged fire.
