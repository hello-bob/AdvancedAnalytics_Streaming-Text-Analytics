She had just had her iris scanned.\n\n\u201cNo one told me what they\u2019ll do with my eye,\u201d de Le\u00f3n, 57, told Rest of World.\n\u201cBut I did this out of need.\u201d\n\nDe Le\u00f3n, who lives off the $95 pension she receives from the state, had been\ndesperate for money. Persuaded by her nephew, she agreed to have one of her\nirises scanned by Worldcoin, Sam Altman\u2019s blockchain project. In exchange, she\nreceived nearly $50 worth of WLD, the company\u2019s cryptocurrency.\n\nDe Le\u00f3n is one of about half a million Argentines who have handed their\nbiometric data over to Worldcoin. Beaten down by the country\u2019s 288% inflation\nrate and growing unemployment, they have flocked to Worldcoin Orb verification\nhubs, eager to get the sign-up crypto bonus offered by the company.\n\nA network of intermediaries \u2014 who earn a commission from every iris scan \u2014 has\nlured many into signing up for the practice in Argentina, where data privacy\nlaws remain weak. But as the popularity of Worldcoin skyrockets in the\ncountry, experts have sounded the alarm about the dangers of giving away\nbiometric data. Two provinces are now pushing for legal investigations.\n\n> \u201cI did this out of need.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing that [iris scans have] been banned in European countries, shouldn\u2019t we\nbe trying to stop it, too?\u201d Javier Smaldone, a software consultant and digital\nsecurity expert, told Rest of World.\n\nIn March, Spain, France, and Portugal temporarily banned Worldcoin. Last year,\nKenya ordered the company to shut down operations, and Worldcoin has stopped\noffering its Orb services in India and Brazil. But in working-class\nneighborhoods around Buenos Aires, dozens of Worldcoin Orb scanning points\nhave been set up \u2014 lines of people waiting to get their irises scanned snake\nout of nightclubs, cellphone repair shops, bars, theaters, and train stations.\nThe greater Buenos Aires area, home to almost 16 million residents, has a\npoverty rate of 45%.\n\nWith nearly 60 centers set up across Argentina in under a year, Worldcoin\u2019s\nexpansion in the country has been swift and has come at a tumultuous time.\nSince taking office in December, President Javier Milei, a far-right\neconomist, has laid off tens of thousands of public workers, eliminated social\nwelfare plans and subsidies, and closed down public institutions aimed at\nhelping the country\u2019s poor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a shocking economic crisis,\u201d Ignacio Carballo, head of\nalternative finance at market research firm Americas Market Intelligence, told\nRest of World. \u201cIn economies under recession like ours, these kinds of\nphenomena [like Worldcoin] bloom.\u201d\n\nIn January, the company announced it had already scanned the irises of more\nthan 1% of Argentina\u2019s population.\n\nThe cryptocurrency offered in exchange for iris scans has given rise to a\ncommission scheme to recruit new customers to sign up.\n\nAuthorities have taken notice. Last year, Worldcoin halted its operations in\nthe central-western province of Mendoza, after a lawyer issued a complaint\nagainst the company for violating the data privacy law. In March this year,\nthe province of Buenos Aires accused Worldcoin of failing to answer specific\nquestions about \u201cabusive clauses\u201d in its terms and conditions.\n\nA Worldcoin spokesperson told Rest of World the company responded promptly to\nall requests and aims to be \u201ctransparent about its practices.\u201d Worldcoin\nrecently announced that it was taking security measures to keep underage users\nfrom signing up.\n\nRest of World visited nine Orb centers in Buenos Aires, where an intermediary\nscheme has taken hold. Young people are now luring relatives and friends or\napproaching strangers on social media, pitching them the prospect of easy\nmoney.\n\nBrian, a 29-year-old street sweeper, waited outside an Orb center for an\nelderly couple whom he had convinced to sign up for Worldcoin. Brian, who\nrequested his last name be withheld due to fear of legal repercussions, told\nRest of World he makes a profit by cashing in the WLD tokens given to new\nclients \u2014 most of whom have little knowledge of cryptocurrency. He then\ntransfers the money to them in pesos using Mercado Pago, Argentina\u2019s most\npopular digital wallet. Brian takes a cut, which varies depending on the\nclient. \u201cI keep more from the junkies,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the time of writing, Brian said he makes about $114 every week. He\nestimated that there are \u201cdozens\u201d of intermediaries seeking out people in need\nof \u201ceasy money\u201d amid economic turmoil. Rest of World found dozens of\nintermediaries on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, offering to exchange the\nWLD for the \u201cbest rate.\u201d\n\nNearly 60 Worldcoin Orb centers have been set up across Argentina, with many\nlocated in working-class neighborhoods around Buenos Aires. The iris-scanning\npoints operate out of a range of locations, including nightclubs, bars,\ntheaters, and train stations.\n\nMalena Saito, a writer and poetry teacher in Buenos Aires, began borrowing\nmoney from relatives about four months ago after her income dropped\nsignificantly. \u201cI wanted to pay it back, and I had no quick way of getting\nmoney,\u201d Saito told Rest of World. When a friend told her about Worldcoin, she\ndownloaded the app immediately and headed to the nearest Orb center, located\nat a cellphone repair shop. Once there, she rushed to accept the terms and\nconditions.\n\nShe read them later that evening and immediately regretted signing up.\n\n\u201cA [foreign] company, no right to claim if anything happened with the data,\nand compensation of just up to $100 if anything happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the\nkind of person who is generally aware of how risky these things are. Never in\nmy life did I think I would do [something like] this.\u201d\n\nLast year, Worldcoin Orbs were available in 25 countries. Today, they are\nlimited to Argentina, Chile, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Mexico, South Korea,\nand the U.S.\n\nAccording to Smaldone, Argentina\u2019s economic woes and weak privacy laws have\ncreated a fertile ground for Worldcoin \u2014 and a dangerous one for its clients.\n\n\u201cWhen you earn money by bringing people in, people are the product,\u201d he said.\n\u201c[Worldcoin] is taking away something much more valuable than cash.\u201d\n\nLuc\u00eda Cholakian Herrera is a freelance journalist based in Buenos Aires.\n\nRead more stories\n\n3 Minutes With\n\nThe co-founder of India\u2019s largest crypto exchange says building trust among\nusers is most valuable\n\nCoinSwitch\u2019s Ashish Singhal wants to level the playing field between virtual\nand capital assets.\n\nBy Ananya Bhattacharya\n\nThe Rise of AI\n\nAI companies are making millions producing election content in India\n\nAs India\u2019s political parties pay for AI ads, startups say they have set their\nown \u201cethical\u201d boundaries around deepfakes.\n\nBy Fahad Shah\n\nExporter Newsletter\n\nThe TikTok ban is bigger than just ByteDance\n\nThe U.S. clampdown on Chinese-owned companies won't end here.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\n  * About us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Platforms\n  * Newsletters\n  * Donate\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rest of World\n\n", "frontpage": true}
