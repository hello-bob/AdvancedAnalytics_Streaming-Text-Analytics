This drop has sparked some\npublic attention, as demonstrated during a meeting of police chiefs in\nFebruary 2024 at the White House.\n\nDuring the meeting, President Joe Biden lauded investments made in law\nenforcement and community anti-violence initiatives during his administration.\nIn 2023, Biden said, the U.S. \u201chad one of the lowest rates of all violent\ncrime in more than 50 years.\u201d\n\nBut the most striking fact about homicide in the U.S. has been largely\noverlooked during such meetings \u2013 Black Americans are murdered at nearly eight\ntimes the rate of white Americans.\n\nYoung Black men in inner cities are disproportionately affected. They are both\nthe primary victims and perpetrators of gun assaults and homicides.\n\nThis grave reality does not mean Black people are inherently violent. Instead,\nit largely reflects their disproportionate experience of systemic barriers\nsuch as poverty and limited access to quality education, good jobs and\naffordable housing \u2013 all factors that research shows contribute to\nneighborhood violence.\n\nMaking matters worse are the high rates of illegal gun possession among young\nmen in urban areas. This behavior is often driven by reasons beyond criminal\nintent and include distrust of the legal system and the perceived need for\nself-protection.\n\nMore people walking around with weapons raises the risks for minor disputes\nescalating into deadly encounters. Studies revealing a connection between\nincreased gun carrying and a rise in gun-related fatalities highlight the\ndangers of ready access to guns.\n\n## Limits of tough-on-crime policies\n\nTo be clear, keeping Americans safe requires arresting and locking up\ndangerous offenders. But the problem of street violence transcends punishment\nstrategies that emphasize more police, more enforcement of petty crimes and,\nultimately, more incarcerations.\n\nSuch traditional, tough-on-crime responses fail to address deeper social\nissues and unwritten rules like the \u201cstreet code\u201d and the elusive American\ndream dictating daily life in many inner cities.\n\nThis street code discourages police cooperation and glorifies guns and\nviolence as ways to resolve conflicts and gain respect. At the same time, the\ncode encourages intimidation and swift retaliation against perceived threats\nor insults.\n\nAn Alameda County Coroner\u2019s Bureau van leaves the scene of a fatal shooting by\npolice officers in West Oakland, Calif., on April 17, 2024.

When people are presented with few legitimate\neconomic prospects, studies show that some turn to crimes such as drug-dealing\nand theft.\n\nDespite being classified as nonviolent offenses, those involved frequently use\nviolence to establish dominance or settle disagreements.\n\nAs scholars of criminal justice \u2013 one of us is also a former police officer of\n10 years \u2013 we have found that one way to reduce crime and its harmful effects\non communities is to develop strategies for at-risk individuals that offer a\nrange of mental health and other professional services, including a monthly\nstipend.\n\nIt is no coincidence that young Black males, who are most at risk of gun\nviolence, also have the lowest chance of escaping poverty.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 54% of Black men born in the\npoorest households end up in the lowest earnings bracket between the ages of\n28 to 35, compared with 22% of white men, 29% of white women and 34% of Black\nwomen.\n\nSuch grim prospects, along with the relatively small group of offenders\ndriving community violence, highlight the importance of targeted, holistic\ninterventions.\n\n## Cash incentives\n\nThere is one approach that cities can consider \u2013 cash allowances for young\nBlack men at greatest risk of committing gun violence.\n\nCommunity-based initiatives like Advance Peace, a nonprofit agency focused on\nanti-gun violence, are addressing the economic pressures behind street\nviolence and demonstrate the potential of providing people with guaranteed\npayments each month.\n\nAdvance Peace members gather for a meeting in Sacramento, Calif., on Oct. 26,\n2018. Mason Trinca for The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nLaunched in Richmond, California, in 2009, Advance Peace receives its funding\nfrom city contracts, federal grants and private donations.\n\nIts programs offer participants as much as US$1,000 monthly for up to nine\nmonths. This stipend is conditional on meeting goals intended to steer them\naway from crime and violence, such as completing educational courses or\nfinding jobs.\n\nTo address underlying emotional and behavioral issues, participants are also\nconnected with round-the-clock mentorship by staff counselors for at least 18\nmonths. Other services include cognitive behavioral therapy to help manage\naggressive and impulsive tendencies associated with violence.\n\nIn addition, gang rivals are paired together during sponsored trips to foster\ndialogue and humanize one another.\n\nIn California cities implementing Advance Peace, such as Richmond, Sacramento\nand Stockton, shootings decreased from 2018 to 2021, and the overwhelming\nmajority of participants have avoided both gun violence and new arrests.\n\nResearch on these California cities shows that neighborhoods with Advance\nPeace programs saw a 5% to 52% decrease in the number of victims of gun\nviolence in 2021 compared with 2018.\n\nBlack men under 35 also were involved in 15% to 42% fewer shootings across the\nthree cities.\n\n## Solutions that address root causes\n\nOpponents of the monthly stipend, including former Sacramento County Sheriff\nScott Jones, have criticized the idea of paying people to obey the law as\n\u201ccash for criminals.\u201d They contend that this approach suggests compliance\nrequires monetary incentives rather than personal accountability. While\nunderstandable, we believe these criticisms are misguided.\n\nThe objective is not to pay off potential offenders but rather to stabilize\ntumultuous lives and open avenues for personal and professional growth. It is\nchallenging to develop these initiatives without stigmatizing recipients or\ncreating dependency. But the harsh truth is that we either pay now or pay\nlater.\n\nBesides the loss of life and the trauma caused by gun violence, its massive\neconomic burden extends beyond victims and their families. Recent estimates\nreveal that the financial toll of gun violence in the U.S. amounts to a\nstaggering $557 billion annually, surpassing the gross domestic products of\ncountries such as South Africa and Denmark.\n\nThese costs include immediate and long-term medical bills, legal expenses and\nlost earnings from victims\u2019 death or disability.\n\nTo this point, another analysis found the potential shootings prevented by\nAdvance Peace programs saved cities $67 million to $268 million in associated\ncosts in 2022. But direct payments to participants offer only temporary\nrelief.\n\nTo effectively break the cycle of violence, comprehensive efforts are needed\nto improve access to quality education, jobs, housing, health care and\ncommunity development in inner cities. Initiatives that address community\nviolence without tackling its underlying causes is akin to treating symptoms\nwhile ignoring the root causes of a disease.\n\nStrategically investing in equal opportunities for upward mobility can create\na society in which young Black men are less likely to turn to guns for\nempowerment and self-preservation. We view this investment as a small price to\npay for the promise of safer cities.\n\n  * Race\n  * Affordable housing\n  * US education\n  * Community policing\n  * US gun violence\n  * Systemic racism\n  * US poverty\n  * Urban violence\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Assistant Editor - 1 year cadetship\n\n  * ##### Executive Dean, Faculty of Health\n\n  * ##### Nutrition Research Coordinator \u2013 Bone Health Program\n\n  * ##### Lecturer/Senior Lecturer, Earth System Science (School of Science)\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
