For the artist, see Joshua Norton (artist).\n\nJoshua Abraham Norton  \n---  \nNorton, c. 1871\u201372  \nBorn| (1818-02-04)February 4, 1818Deptford, England  \nDied| January 8, 1880(1880-01-08) (aged 61)San Francisco, California, U.S.  \nResting place| Woodlawn Memorial Park, Colma, California  \n  \nJoshua Abraham Norton (February 4, 1818 \u2013 January 8, 1880) was a resident of\nSan Francisco, California, who in 1859 proclaimed himself \"Norton I., Emperor\nof the United States\", commonly known as Emperor Norton. In 1863, after\nNapoleon III invaded Mexico, he took the secondary title of \"Protector of\nMexico\".\n\nFor the first few years after arriving in San Francisco in 1849, Norton made a\nsuccessful living as a commodities trader and real estate speculator. However,\nhe was financially ruined following a failed bid to corner the rice market\nduring a shortage prompted by a famine in China. He bought a shipload of\nPeruvian rice at 12 cents per pound (26 \u00a2/kg), but more Peruvian ships arrived\nin port, causing the price to drop sharply to three cents per pound (6.6\n\u00a2/kg). He then lost a protracted lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice\ncontract, and his local prominence faded.\n\nIn September 1859, he proclaimed himself \"Emperor of the United States\".\nNorton had no formal political power, but was treated deferentially in San\nFrancisco nevertheless, and currency issued in his name was honored in some of\nthe establishments he frequented. Some considered Norton to be insane or\neccentric, but residents of San Francisco and the city's larger Northern\nCalifornia orbit enjoyed his imperial presence and took note of his frequent\nnewspaper proclamations. Though Norton received free ferry and train passage\nand a variety of favors, such as help with rent and free meals, from well-\nplaced friends and sympathizers, the city's merchants also capitalized on his\nnotoriety by selling souvenirs bearing his image.\n\nOn January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed and died before he could be given medical\ntreatment. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, upwards of 10,000 people\nlined the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral. Norton\nhas been immortalized as the basis of characters in the literature of Mark\nTwain, Robert Louis Stevenson, Christopher Moore, Morris, Ren\u00e9 Goscinny, Selma\nLagerl\u00f6f, Neil Gaiman, Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu and Charles Bukowski.\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\nNorton's parents were John Norton (1794-1848) and Sarah Nordon (1796-1846),\nwho were English Jews. John was a farmer and merchant, and Sarah was a\ndaughter of Abraham Norden and a sister of Benjamin Norden, a successful\nmerchant. The family moved to South Africa in early 1820 as part of a\ngovernment-backed colonial scheme whose participants came to be known as the\n1820 Settlers.^[1]^[2]^[3] Most likely, Norton was born in the Kentish town of\nDeptford, today part of London.^[2]^[4]\n\nThe best available evidence points to February 4, 1818, as the date of\nNorton's birth. Obituaries published in 1880, following Norton's death,\noffered conflicting information about his date of birth. The second of two\nobituaries in the San Francisco Chronicle, \"following the best information\nobtainable,\" cited the silver plate on his coffin which said he was \"aged\nabout 65\",^[5] suggesting that 1815 could be the year of his birth. However,\nNorton's biographer, William Drury, points out that \"about 65\" was based\nsolely on the guess that Norton's landlady offered to the coroner at the\ninquest following his death.^[6] In a 1923 essay published by the California\nHistorical Society, Robert Ernest Cowan claimed that Norton was born on\nFebruary 4, 1819.^[7] However, the passenger lists for the La Belle Alliance,\nthe ship that carried Norton and his family from England to South Africa, list\nhim as having been two years old when the ship set sail in February\n1820.^[8]^[9] This information appears not to have been known until after\n1934, the year that Norton's headstone was placed at his grave in Colma,\nCalifornia \u2014 when Cowan's account remained prominent. This may help to explain\nwhy those who had the stone made used 1819 as the birth year.\n\nThe February 4, 1865, edition of The Daily Alta California newspaper included\nan item in which the Alta wished Emperor Norton a happy 47th birthday,\nindicating that his birth date was February 4, 1818 (not 1819, as Cowan\nclaimed)\u2014a date that would line up with La Belle Alliances passenger list from\n2 years later.^[10]^[11]^[12] Moreover, when Cowan quoted the 1865 Alta item\nin his essay, he used an altered version in an apparent attempt to advance his\nclaim of an 1819 birth date.^[12] Persistent claims for an 1819 birth date are\nof doubtful provenance, tracing to unsubstantiated assertions made online,\nduring the early years of the internet.^[13] The Emperor Norton Trust, a\nnonprofit organization that engages in Norton research and education, produced\na 2018 bicentennial series, Emperor Norton at 200, that took as its starting\npoint a February 4, 1818, birth date for Norton. Supporting and participating\nin the series were a number of institutions that long have helped to preserve\nthe historical record of Emperor Norton: the California Historical Society,\nthe San Francisco Public Library, the Mechanics' Institute and the Society of\nCalifornia Pioneers.^[14]\n\nThere are often-repeated historical claims that Joshua Norton arrived in San\nFrancisco on a specific vessel, the Franzeska, on November 23, 1849; that he\narrived with $40,000, in whole or in part a bequest from his father's estate;\nand that he parlayed this into a fortune of $250,000 ($9,865,032.05 in 2023\nUSD). None of this is substantiated by contemporaneous\ndocumentation.^[15]^[16] What is known is that, after Norton arrived in San\nFrancisco, he enjoyed a good deal of success in commodities markets and in\nreal estate speculation, and that by late 1852, he was one of the more\nprosperous, respected citizens of the city.\n\nIn December 1852, Norton thought he saw a business opportunity when China,\nfacing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of rice, causing the price\nof rice in San Francisco to increase from four to thirty-six cents per pound\n(9 to 79 cents/kg). When he heard the Glyde, which was returning from Peru,\nwas carrying 200,000 pounds (91,000 kg) of rice, he bought the entire shipment\nfor $25,000 (or twelve and a half cents per pound), hoping to corner the\nmarket. Shortly after he signed the contract, several other shiploads of rice\narrived from Peru, causing the price of rice to plummet to three cents a\npound. Norton tried to void the contract, stating the dealer had misled him as\nto the quality of rice to expect.^[17]^[18]\n\nFor nearly two years, from early 1853 to late 1854, Norton and the rice\ndealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in\nthe lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which\nruled against him in October 1854.^[19] Later, the Lucas Turner and Company\nbank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's\ndebt.^[17] He filed for insolvency in August 1856.\n\nNorton continued to run newspaper ads selling various commodities. Although\nthese ads appear to have run their course by mid 1857, there are other public\ntraces of Norton during this period. In September 1857, he served on a jury\nfor a case of a man accused of stealing a bar of gold from Wells, Fargo & Co.\nand, in August 1858, Norton ran an ad announcing his candidacy for US\nCongress.^[20] By this time, he was living in reduced circumstances at a\nworking-class boarding house.^[17]\n\n## Reign as emperor[edit]\n\n### Declaring himself emperor[edit]\n\nEmperor Norton in full dress uniform and military regalia, his hand on the\nhilt of a ceremonial sabre, c. 1875\n\nBy 1859, Norton had become completely discontented with what he considered the\ninadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States. In\nJuly 1859, he issued a brief manifesto addressed to the \"Citizens of the\nUnion\". It outlined in the broadest terms the national crisis as Joshua saw it\nand suggested the imperative for action to address this crisis at the most\nbasic level. The manifesto ran as a paid ad in the San Francisco Daily Evening\nBulletin.^[20]\n\nTwo months later, on September 17, 1859, Norton hand-delivered the following\nletter declaring himself \"Emperor of these United States\", to the offices of\nthe Bulletin:\n\n> At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of\n> these United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good\n> Hope, and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of San Francisco,\n> California, declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these United States; and\n> in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct\n> the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in\n> Musical Hall, of this city, on the 1st day of February next, then and there\n> to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate\n> the evils under which the country is laboring, and thereby cause confidence\n> to exist, both at home and abroad, in our stability and integrity.\n>\n> \u2014 NORTON I., Emperor of the United States.^[21]\n\nThe paper printed the letter in that evening's edition, for humorous effect,\nand thus began Norton's whimsical 20-year \"reign\" over the United\nStates.^[22]^[23]\n\nOne of Norton's undated proclamations\n\nNorton issued numerous decrees on matters of state, including a decree on\nOctober 12, 1859, to formally abolish the United States Congress. In it, he\nobserved:\n\n> fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public\n> voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by\n> mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects; that the\n> citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is\n> entitled.^[24]\n\nIn this same decree, Norton repeated his order that all interested parties\nassemble at Musical Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to \"remedy the evil\ncomplained of.\"\n\nIn an imperial decree issued in January 1860, Norton summoned the Army to\ndepose the elected officials of the US Congress:\n\n> WHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in\n> session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th\n> of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished;\n>\n> WHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree\n> should be strictly complied with;\n>\n> NOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott, the\n> Commander-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our\n> Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of\n> Congress.^[25]\n\nNorton's orders were ignored by the Army, and Congress likewise continued\nwithout any formal acknowledgement of the decree. A decree in July 1860\nordered the dissolution of the republic in favor of a temporary monarchy.^[26]\nNorton issued a mandate in 1862 ordering both the Roman Catholic Church and\nthe Protestant churches to publicly ordain him as \"Emperor\", hoping to resolve\nthe many disputes that had resulted in the Civil War.^[7]\n\nNorton then turned his attention to other matters, both political and social.\nIn a proclamation dated August 12, 1869, and published in the San Francisco\nDaily Herald, he declared the abolition of the Democratic and Republican\nparties, explaining that he was \"desirous of allaying the dissensions of party\nstrife now existing within our realm.\"^[27]\n\nThe failure to treat Norton's adopted home city with appropriate respect was\nthe subject of a particularly stern edict that often is cited as having been\nwritten by Norton in 1872, although evidence is elusive for the authorship,\ndate, or source of this decree:^[28]\n\n> Whoever after due and proper warning shall be heard to utter the abominable\n> word \"Frisco\", which has no linguistic or other warrant, shall be deemed\n> guilty of a High Misdemeanor, and shall pay into the Imperial Treasury as\n> penalty the sum of twenty-five dollars.^[29]\n\nNorton was occasionally a visionary, and some of his imperial decrees\nexhibited profound foresight. He is said to have issued instructions to form a\nLeague of Nations,^[30]^[better source needed] he explicitly forbade any form\nof conflict between religions or their sects, and he issued several decrees\ncalling for the construction of a suspension bridge or tunnel connecting\nOakland and San Francisco\u2014with the last of these decrees showing his\nirritation at the lack of prompt obedience by the authorities:\n\n> WHEREAS, we issued our decree ordering the citizens of San Francisco and\n> Oakland to appropriate funds for the survey of a suspension bridge from\n> Oakland Point via Goat Island; also for a tunnel; and to ascertain which is\n> the best project; and whereas the said citizens have hitherto neglected to\n> notice our said decree; and whereas we are determined our authority shall be\n> fully respected; now, therefore, we do hereby command the arrest by the army\n> of both the Boards of City Fathers if they persist in neglecting our\n> decrees. Given under our royal hand and seal at San Francisco, this 17th day\n> of September, 1872.^[31]\n\nLong after his death, similar structures were built in the form of the San\nFrancisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube,^[32]^[33] and there have\nbeen efforts since the 1930s to name the Bay Bridge after Emperor Norton or at\nleast to add \"Emperor Norton Bridge\" as an honorary name for the\nbridge.^[34]^[35]\n\n### Norton's imperial acts[edit]\n\nA fanciful depiction of Norton dressed as the Pope at the funeral of the\nitinerant dog Lazarus^[36]\n\nNorton spent most of his daylight hours inspecting the streets, spending time\nin parks and libraries, and paying visits to newspaper offices and old friends\nin San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley. In the evenings, he often was seen at\npolitical gatherings or at theatrical or musical performances.^[citation\nneeded]\n\nHe wore an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, at some time\ngiven to him secondhand by officers of the United States Army post at the\nPresidio of San Francisco. He embellished that with a variety of\naccoutrements, including a beaver hat decorated with a peacock or ostrich\nfeathers and a rosette, a walking stick and an umbrella.^[37] In the course of\nhis rounds, he took note of the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the\nstate of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. He\nalso often had conversations on the issues of the day with those he\nencountered.\n\nNorton caricaturist, Edward Jump, started a rumor that two noted stray dogs,\nnamed Bummer and Lazarus, were Norton's pets.^[38] Norton ate at free-lunch\ncounters where he shared his meals with the dogs, although he did not, in\nfact, own them.^[39]\n\nSpecial officer Armand Barbier was part of a local auxiliary force whose\nmembers were called \"policemen\", although they were private security guards\npaid by neighborhood residents and business owners. He arrested Norton in 1867\nto commit him to involuntary treatment for a mental disorder.^[17] The arrest\noutraged many citizens and sparked scathing editorials in the newspapers,\nincluding the Daily Alta, which wrote \"that he had shed no blood; robbed no\none; and despoiled no country; which is more than can be said of his fellows\nin that line\".^[40] Police Chief Patrick Crowley ordered Norton released and\nissued a formal apology on behalf of the police force,^[17] and Norton granted\nan Imperial Pardon to Barbier. Police officers of San Francisco thereafter\nsaluted him as he passed in the street.\n\nNorton did receive some tokens of recognition for his position. The 1870 US\ncensus lists Joshua Norton as 50 years old and residing at 624 Commercial\nStreet, with his occupation listed as \"Emperor\". It also notes that he was\ninsane. (However, the US Census instructions state \"The fact of idiocy will be\nbetter determined by the common consent of the neighborhood, than by\nattempting to apply any scientific measure to the weakness of the mind or\nwill.\"^[41])^[42]\n\nA ten dollar note issued by the imperial government of Norton I\n\nDuring the 1860s and 1870s, there were occasional anti-Chinese demonstrations\nin the poorer districts of San Francisco, and riots took place, sometimes\nresulting in fatalities. Starting in the late 1870s, those riots were fomented\nat rallies on Sunday afternoons at the sandlots across from City Hall. The\nrallies were led by Denis Kearney, a leader of the anti-Chinese Workingmen's\nParty of California. At a sandlot rally held on April 28, 1878, Emperor Norton\nappeared just before the start of proceedings, stood on a small box and\nchallenged Kearney directly, telling him and the assembled crowd to disperse\nand go home. Norton was unsuccessful, but the incident was widely reported in\nlocal papers over the next couple of days.^[43]\n\nNorton issued his own money in the form of scrip, or promissory notes, which\nwere accepted from him by some restaurants in San Francisco.^[44] The notes\ncame in denominations between fifty cents and ten dollars, and the few\nsurviving ones are collector's items that routinely sell for more than $10,000\nat auction.^[45]\n\n### Foreign diplomacy[edit]\n\nThroughout his reign, Norton commented on the policies and actions of foreign\ngovernments, issuing proclamations and sending letters to foreign leaders in\nattempts to establish congenial and fruitful relations with them and their\ncountries and, if he felt it necessary, to cajole better behavior.\n\nIn 1862, Mexico was invaded by French Emperor Napoleon III after not being\nable to pay war reparations following the disastrous Reform War. Napoleon\ninstalled the Habsburg Maximilian I as his puppet ruler. That news quickly\nreached the United States and a man in San Francisco suggested that Emperor\nNorton take the title \"Protector of Mexico\", both because no-one had been\nappointed protector, and because of a popular legend stating Norton was the\nson of Napoleon III. Norton happily obliged, adding the title to many of his\nproclamations, but he later would revoke the title, stating, \"It is impossible\nto protect such an unsettled nation\".^[7]\n\nNorton wrote many letters to Queen Victoria, including a suggestion that they\nmarry to strengthen ties between their nations. That proved futile because the\nqueen never responded.^[46]\n\nNorton also sent a number of letters to Kamehameha V, the King of Hawaii at\nthe time, regarding an estate in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Near the end of his\nreign, Kamehameha would refuse to recognize the democratic US government,\ninstead opting to only recognize Norton as sole leader of the United\nStates.^[47]^[48]^[better source needed]\n\n### Later years and death[edit]\n\nNorton was the subject of many tales. One popular story suggested that he was\nthe son of Emperor Napoleon III and that his claim of coming from South Africa\nwas a ruse to prevent persecution.^[citation needed] Rumours also circulated\nthat Norton was supremely wealthy and was feigning poverty because he was\nmiserly.^[citation needed]\n\nStarting a few years after Norton declared himself emperor, local newspapers,\nnotably the Daily Alta California, began to print fictitious decrees. It is\nbelieved that newspaper editors themselves drafted the fake proclamations to\nsuit their own agendas.^[17] Weary of that, in January 1871 Norton named the\nblack-owned and -operated Pacific Appeal as his \"imperial organ.\" Between\nSeptember 1870 and May 1875, the Appeal published some 250 proclamations over\nthe signature of Norton I. Historians and researchers who have studied Norton\nclosely generally regard those proclamations as being authentic.\n\nOn the evening of January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed on the corner of\nCalifornia Street and Dupont Street (now Grant Avenue), across the street from\nOld Saint Mary's Cathedral, while on his way to a debate at the California\nAcademy of Sciences.^[17] His collapse was immediately noticed, and \"the\npolice officer on the beat hastened for a carriage to convey him to the City\nReceiving Hospital\", according to the next day's obituary in the San Francisco\nMorning Call. Norton died before a carriage could arrive. The Call reported:\n\"On the reeking pavement, in the darkness of a moonless night, under the\ndripping rain ... Norton I, by the grace of God, Emperor of the United States\nand Protector of Mexico, departed this life\". Two days later, the San\nFrancisco Chronicle led its article on Norton's funeral with the headline \"Le\nRoi Est Mort.\" (lit. \"The King is dead\", and the first half of the traditional\nproclamation of a new king)^[49]\n\nIt quickly became evident that Norton had died in complete poverty, contrary\nto rumours of wealth. Five or six dollars in small change was found on his\nperson, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street\nturned up a single gold sovereign, worth around $2.50. His possessions\nincluded his collection of walking sticks, his rather battered sabre, a\nvariety of headgear, including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and\nanother cap suited to a martial band-master. There was an 1828 French franc\nand a handful of the Imperial bonds that he sold to tourists at a fictitious\n7% interest.^[17] Also found were fake telegrams, purporting to be from Tsar\nAlexander II of Russia, congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to\nQueen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union\nwould be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen\nVictoria and 98 shares of stock in a defunct gold mine.^[50]\n\nInitial funeral arrangements were for a pauper's coffin of simple redwood.\nHowever, members of a San Francisco businessmen's association, the Pacific\nClub, established a funeral fund that provided for a handsome rosewood casket\nand arranged a dignified farewell.^[7] Norton's funeral on Sunday, January 10,\nwas solemn, mournful, and large. Paying their respects were members of \"all\nclasses from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the pickpocket, well-\ndressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing hinted of the social\noutcast\".^[51] The next day, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, under the\nheadline \"Le Roi Est Mort,\" that some 10,000 people had come to view the\nemperor's body in advance of the 2 p.m. funeral. Notwithstanding the later\nlegend of a \"two-mile-long cortege,\" the Chronicle reported in the same\narticle that people lined the streets for only the first block or two. The\nemperor's casket was attended by \"only three carriages,\" with no mourners on\nfoot, and there were \"about thirty people\" at the burial service in the\nMasonic Cemetery.^[52]\n\nIn 1934, Norton's remains were transferred to a grave site at Woodlawn\nMemorial Park Cemetery in Colma, California.^[53]\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\nMain article: Emperor Norton in popular culture\n\nThis 1939 plaque commemorating Norton's role in the history of the Bay Bridge\nwas originally at the Cliff House, San Francisco and then at the now-\ndemolished Transbay Terminal. It is currently located inside Old Molloy's\nTavern, in Colma, Calif.\n\nDetails of Norton's life story may have been forgotten, but he has been\nimmortalized in literature. Mark Twain resided in San Francisco during part of\nEmperor Norton's public life, and modeled the character of the King in\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn on him.^[17] Robert Louis Stevenson made Norton\na character in his 1892 novel, The Wrecker. Stevenson's stepdaughter Isobel\nOsbourne mentioned Norton in her autobiography, This Life I've Loved, stating\nthat he \"was a gentle and kindly man, and fortunately found himself in the\nfriendliest and most sentimental city in the world, the idea being 'let him be\nemperor if he wants to.' San Francisco played the game with him.\"^[17]\n\nIn more modern times, the life of Emperor Norton is the inspiration for\nL'Empereur Smith, a Lucky Luke comic book adventure published in 1976. Norton\nalso appears as a character in the comic book The Sandman, Vol. 2, No. 31,\n\"Three Septembers and a January\", by Neil Gaiman and Shawn McManus, and is\nvoiced by John Lithgow in the audio book version of the comic. He appeared\nbriefly in Captain America Comics #11.\n\nThere have been a number of television adaptations of the Norton story. In the\nJune 15, 1956, episode of the western anthology series Death Valley Days,\ntitled \"Emperor Norton\", Parker Garvie played the title character. In the\nFebruary 27, 1966, episode of the western television series Bonanza, titled\n\"The Emperor Norton\", Sam Jaffe played the title role. The episode also\nfeatured William Challee as Sam Clemens a.k.a. Mark Twain. In the December 18,\n1956, episode of Broken Arrow season 1, episode 11, titled \"The Conspirators\",\nFlorenz Ames played the \"Emperor Norton\".\n\nSince 1974, the Imperial Council of San Francisco has been conducting an\nannual pilgrimage to Norton's grave in Colma, California, just outside San\nFrancisco.^[54] In January 1980, ceremonies were conducted in San Francisco to\nhonor the 100th anniversary of the death of \"the one and only Emperor of the\nUnited States\".^[55]\n\nThe Emperor Norton Trust, founded and based in San Francisco from 2013 to\n2019, and originally known as The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, is a non-profit\nthat engages in research, education, and advocacy to advance the legacy of\nEmperor Norton.^[56]\n\nEmperor Norton is considered a patron saint of Discordianism,^[57] and a park\nin the micronation Molossia is named after him.\n\n## Public tributes[edit]\n\nThere have been perennial efforts to name major public San Francisco landmarks\nafter Emperor Norton or to enact other permanent local tributes to him.\n\n### \"Emperor Norton Place\" \u2014 Honorary naming of 600 block of Commercial\nStreet[edit]\n\nThe most recent of those efforts has been the most successful.\n\nIn February 2023, San Francisco Board of Supervisors president Aaron Peskin\nintroduced a resolution to add \"Emperor Norton Place\" as a commemorative name\nfor the 600 block of Commercial Street. The resolution was adopted by the\nSupervisors, and approved by Mayor London Breed in April 2023, with signage\ninstalled in early May.^[58]^[59]^[60]\n\n### Clock tower of the San Francisco Ferry Building[edit]\n\nIn October 2022, The Emperor Norton Trust announced a new effort to have the\nSan Francisco Ferry Building clock tower named \"The Emperor Norton Tower\" in\n2023, the 125th anniversary of the opening of the building in 1898.^[61]\n\n### San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge[edit]\n\nIn 1939, the group E Clampus Vitus commissioned and dedicated a plaque\ncommemorating Emperor Norton's call for the construction of a suspension\nbridge between San Francisco and Oakland. The group intended to place the\nplaque on the recently opened San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge or, failing\nthat, the new Transbay Terminal. However, that was not approved by the bridge\nauthorities and the plaque was installed at the Cliff House in 1955. It was\nmoved to the Transbay Terminal in 1986, in connection with the 50th\nanniversary of the bridge. The Terminal was closed and demolished in 2010 as\npart of the project to construct a new Transbay Transit Center, and the plaque\nwas placed in storage. After being restored in late 2018, it was rededicated\nand reinstalled at the new transit center in September 2019 but, after being\nvandalized in 2020, was moved to Molloy's Tavern, in Colma, California, in\n2021.^[62]\n\nThere have been two 21st-century campaigns to name all or parts of the Bay\nBridge after Emperor Norton. In November 2004, San Francisco District 3\nSupervisor Aaron Peskin introduced a resolution to the San Francisco Board of\nSupervisors, after a campaign by San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Phil Frank\ncalling for the entire bridge to be named for Norton.^[63] On December 14,\n2004, the Board approved a modified version of this resolution, calling for\nonly \"new additions,\" i.e., the planned replacement for the bridge's eastern\nsection, to be named \"The Emperor Norton Bridge\".^[64] Neither the City of\nOakland nor Alameda County passed any similar resolution, so the effort went\nno further.\n\nIn June 2013, eight members of the California Assembly, and two members of the\nCalifornia Senate, introduced a resolution to name the western section of the\nbridge after former California state Speaker and San Francisco Mayor Willie\nBrown.^[65] In response, there were public efforts seeking to revive the\nearlier Emperor Norton effort. An online petition, launched in August 2013,\ncalled for the entire bridge system to be named after him.^[34]^[66]^[67] The\npetition was the impetus for the creation of \"The Emperor's Bridge Campaign\",\nnow known as \"The Emperor Norton Trust\", which continued the bridge-naming\neffort until 2022, citing the precedent of 30 California bridges for which the\nstate had authorized multiple names. The Trust called on the legislature\nsimply to make \"Emperor Norton Bridge\" an honorary name for the Bay Bridge,\nleaving in place all existing names. Most recently, the organization hoped to\nsponsor a legislative resolution that would take effect in 2022, the 150th\nanniversary of Emperor Norton's proclamations of 1872, setting out the\noriginal vision for the bridge. The legislature did not take up the issue in\n2022, and the Trust suspended its bridge-naming effort.^[68]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * San Francisco Bay Area portal\n  * Biography portal\n\n  * Kinjir\u014d Ashiwara\n  * Bummer and Lazarus\n  * Frank Chu\n  * Frederick Coombs\n  * Jos\u00e9 Sarria\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Dakers, Hazel (April 6, 2000). \"Southern Africa Jewish Genealogy SA-SIG\".
