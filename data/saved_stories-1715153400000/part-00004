As the sun set on our outlandish odyssey, we\ndeliriously descended down the bluff to the Pacific.\n\nWestern Avenue transitions into Paseo Del Mar near White Point and the Pacific\nOcean.\n\nWe took more than 60,000 steps. We toured five cities, numerous neighborhoods\nand a couple of unincorporated communities. We passed establishments and\nvendors offering the cuisines of Armenia, Belize and countless other\ncountries. We overheard so many religious services. To walk Western was to\nforcefully remember how disparate and disconnected our city can feel, even on\none straight line. All this life exists on the same street?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was our third annual attempt to trek the length of a Los Angeles\nthoroughfare on foot. In February 2022, we walked all 16 miles of Wilshire\nBoulevard. In March 2023, we scaled all 25 miles of Sunset Boulevard.\n\nLifestyle\n\n### 7 perfect L.A. spots beyond the beach for a tranquil walk by the water\n\nDriving to the beach can be a pain. Here are 7 inland gems with bodies of\nwater that make for refreshing outdoor excursions.\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\nAll three end at the coast, but we knew Western would present a distinct\nchallenge and setting. We had collectively spent far more time day-to-day\ntraversing the more famous boulevards. Western represents unheralded parts of\nLos Angeles that make this city what it is. It\u2019s fitting that its final 10\nmiles bear the moniker of State Route 213, our original area code.\n\nWestern also cuts a refreshingly coherent course toward the ocean, as you\nprobably know if you\u2019ve been to the Griffith Observatory and let your eyes\nfollow the straight line in your sightline. Sunset zigs and zags across the\ncity. Western doesn\u2019t veer one iota from a 180-degree angle until its fourth\nand final freeway crossing, with the 405, more than 17 miles from the northern\nterminus. It doesn\u2019t meaningfully bend until it crosses the Pacific Coast\nHighway in Lomita, some 22 miles in.\n\nA group of friends cross the 105 Freeway during their end-to-end walk along\nWestern Avenue.\n\nPrecise measurements of our city\u2019s longest streets are confusingly hard to\nfind, maybe because our city is so confusingly defined. Like all of the\ncontenders, Western juts in and out of Los Angeles city limits as it passes\nthrough Gardena, Torrance, Lomita and Rancho Palos Verdes.\n\nOfficial lists tend to include only the parts of our streets within city\nlimits. But maps reliably show that Western extends at least 28 miles without\ninterruption. Since Sepulveda Boulevard splits off into four sections, that is\nat least two miles longer than any other stretch of street across the Los\nAngeles Basin. (It\u2019s a mile longer than Chicago\u2019s longest continuous road,\nalso named Western Avenue.)\n\nWestern tested our limits. Perhaps it proved them. Counting bathroom breaks,\nside quests and switching sides of the street in search of shade, we surpassed\n30 miles on the day. We scheduled this in late April primarily for daylight\u2019s\nsake. Doing it any later would risk hotter temperatures. Doing it any earlier,\nat least this year, would have risked rain. We could\u2019ve started a little\nearlier in the day. We could\u2019ve planned to walk in darkness. Or we could\u2019ve\npicked a different street.\n\nBut, boy, pushing ourselves this time was thrilling. A half-hour in, we\nchatted with a bus driver who was heading southbound on Metro route 207. He\ninquired about our destination. When we told him, he asked if we wanted a\nride.\n\nLifestyle\n\nFor Subscribers\n\n### They walked 50 miles in a day, and swear L.A. is \u2018very walkable\u2019\n\nZachary Weathers and Brooke Palmieri walked 50 miles in a day and discovered\nthat Los Angeles is best experienced while walking.\n\nMarch 2, 2022\n\n\u201cI see you\u2019re hanging in there,\u201d he said two hours later, when he spotted us\nas he headed northbound.\n\nWe received a number of queries about our origin and destination. My favorite\nsuch sequence came after meeting a man walking outside Think Prime Steak House\nin Rancho Palos Verdes. I told him we had started in Los Feliz. He asked where\nthat was. I said it was near Griffith Park. It wasn\u2019t evident he recognized\nthat, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, we were more than 25 miles from there, over an hour\u2018s drive with\ntypical traffic. And no one can know all, or even most, of Los Angeles.\n\nPedro Moura, center, passes out snacks while the walking group pauses in front\nof Donut King in Gardena.\n\n(Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThat Sunday, it seems safe to say we learned a little more, especially about\nour food. In Koreatown, we walked by El Cholo Cafe, the 100-year-old\nrestaurant often incorrectly credited with introducing both the burrito and\nnachos to America, though it claims neither. In South L.A., we devoured an\narray of offerings from Dulan\u2019s, the soul food specialists. In Gardena, we\nsampled Sakura-ya\u2019s satisfyingly soft mochi, made there the same way for 64\nyears. And a couple of miles later, we stopped for sustenance at Monkish,\nmaybe our region\u2019s best brewery.\n\nSomehow, we walked by two of the two dozen Marie Callender\u2019s still standing\nand at least one defunct location, along with so much standout signage,\nincluding the Snooty Fox Motor Inn and, across the street, its competitor the\nMustang Motel. And we witnessed plenty of classic California Crazy and\nprogrammatic architecture, including a KFC shaped like a bucket of fried\nchicken and one of our many massive donuts.\n\nTravel & Experiences\n\nFor Subscribers\n\n### This must be San Pedro\n\nSouth Bay\u2019s maritime city where creativity and community seem to emerge in the\nmost unexpected spaces.\n\nDec. 4, 2023\n\nWe also walked where we weren\u2019t wanted. Like on Sunset and in so many other\nareas, the sidewalks vanished when we reached the wealthiest enclave \u2014 in San\nPedro, between 9th and 19th streets, where the median income is 246% greater\nthan the norm, according to 2023 census data.\n\nThe wiser among us skirted that segment and strolled through a pleasant detour\non Weymouth Avenue. The purists, myself included, bushwhacked a bit on both\nsides before opting for the median. That worked well enough until the median\nshrunk to a few feet in width. Wordlessly, we settled into single file as cars\nzoomed past with us arm\u2019s length from their side mirrors. One driver did slow\ndown to exclaim that he had seen us at Monkish. That was nice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe water, and the prodigious Port of L.A., first came into view around then,\ndue east. In our city, east and west are the more prominent cardinal\ndirections, for whatever reason. People endlessly debate the dividing line:\nthe 405? La Cienega? La Brea? The L.A. River? Downtown?\n\nThere\u2019s no such north-south paradigm, even though Los Angeles\u2019 boundaries are\n50% larger that way than east-west. Perhaps we forget sometimes that driving,\nor walking, south can lead to the ocean too. And on a street named Western, no\nless.\n\nA sign in West Park Terrace along Western Avenue.\n\n(Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times)\n\nJasper Donovan takes a rest on the grass at Jesse Owens Park during a walking\nbreak.\n\nWestern may never have officially marked Los Angeles\u2019 western boundary. But\nit\u2019s clear it was named to denote the then-edges of what became a vastly\nlarger metropolis. It has retained its significance. For more than a century,\nWestern has connected our city to itself, often literally, as in the so-called\nShoestring Strip of 1906 that extended Los Angeles proper to the port.\n\nOn this Sunday, Western connected us to our city and to each other. We laughed\nabout ridiculous restaurant names and marveled over the variety of our group\u2019s\nchoices in snacks, both packed and procured from the street\u2019s myriad markets.\nNear the end, we split a red bell pepper like you might a caramel apple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTravel & Experiences\n\n### 18 inspiring L.A. run clubs to kickstart your running era\n\nThere\u2019s a club for every type of runner, from ultra-marathoners to leisurely\njoggers looking to explore new parts of the city. Find a group that\u2019s right\nfor you.\n\nFeb. 22, 2024\n\nWe lamented the lack of trees in areas long neglected by city officials. We\ntook note of places to visit at a later date, and probably by another means of\ntransportation. And we started thinking about where we\u2019re going next year.\nAtlantic, anyone?\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### L.A. Affairs: I was new to Los Angeles.
