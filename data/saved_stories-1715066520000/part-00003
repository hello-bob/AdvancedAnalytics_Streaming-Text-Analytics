Also, we\u2019ve changed the headline to address that the apps\nthemselves are not malicious and don\u2019t need to be deleted. We\u2019ll update this\nstory as we learn more.\n\nMicrosoft is sounding the alarm about a recently discovered critical security\nvulnerability on Android named \"Dirty Stream\" that can let malicious apps\neasily hijack legitimate apps. Worse still, this flaw impacts multiple apps\nwith hundreds of millions of installs. If you have one of the best Android\nphones, here's what you need to know to protect your data.\n\nThe vulnerability relates to the ContentProvider system prevalent across many\npopular Android apps, which manages access to structured data sets meant to be\nshared between different applications. It's basically what lets your Android\napps talk to one another and share files. To protect users and ward off\nunauthorized access, the system includes safeguards such as strict isolation\nof data, unique permissions attached to specific URIs (Uniform Resource\nIdentifiers), and path validation security.\n\nAccording to Microsoft's alert, two vulnerable apps that have since been\npatched include Xiaomi Inc.\u2019s File Manager (1B+ installs) and WPS Office\n(500M+ installs).\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomsguide\n\nWhat makes the Dirty Stream vulnerability so devious is how it manipulates\nthis system. Microsoft has found that hackers can create \"custom intents,\"\nmessaging objects that facilitate communication between components across\nAndroid apps, to bypass these security measures. By exploiting this loophole,\nmalicious apps can send a file with a manipulated filename or path to another\napp using a custom intent, sneaking in harmful code disguised as legitimate\nfiles.\n\nFrom there, a hacker could trick a vulnerable app into overwriting critical\nfiles within its private storage space \u2014 and the results can be devastating.\nAs BleepingComputer put it, Dirty Stream essentially turns a common OS-level\nfunction into a weaponized tool to execute unauthorized code, steal data, and\neven hijack an app while the user is none the wiser.\n\n\"Arbitrary code execution can provide a threat actor with full control over an\napplication\u2019s behavior,\" Microsoft said in a security bulletin this week.\n\"Meanwhile, token theft can provide a threat actor with access to the user\u2019s\naccounts and sensitive data.\"\n\n## Sign up to get the BEST of Tom\u2019s Guide direct to your inbox.\n\nUpgrade your life with a daily dose of the biggest tech news, lifestyle hacks\nand our curated analysis.

The company uncovered incorrect implementations of the content provider\nsystem across many popular Android apps.\n\n\"We identified several vulnerable applications in the Google Play Store that\nrepresented over four billion installations,\" Microsoft explained. \"We\nanticipate that the vulnerability pattern could be found in other\napplications.\"\n\nGiven the nature of how this vulnerability works, it's hard to know exactly\nhow many other legitimate apps may have been impacted. But it's safe to assume\nthis potential risk is on an industrial scale until all apps are patched.\n\n## How to stay safe from Android malware\n\n(Image credit: Google)\n\nWhen it comes to staying safe from Android malware, one of the easiest and\nsimplest things you can do is to limit the number of apps on your phone. I\nknow this may sound silly but think of it this way, the fewer apps you have,\nthe less likely that one of them may turn out to be malicious. Before\ninstalling any new app, first ask yourself whether or not you actually need\nit.\n\nFrom here, you want to make sure that you\u2019re installing new security updates\nand patches as soon as they become available. These often fix vulnerabilities\nand zero-day flaws which can be used to launch attacks by hackers. While you\ncan use an old phone for longer than you\u2019d expect, it\u2019s worth upgrading to a\nnew device once your current phone isn\u2019t receiving security updates any more,\nespecially if you want to be on the safe side.\n\nYou also want to make sure that Google Play Protect is enabled on your device.\nThis pre-installed app scans both your existing apps and any new ones you\ndownload for malware. Likewise, if you want extra protection and potentially\neven some extra features like a VPN or password manager, you also want to\ncheck out the best Android antivirus apps.\n\nAs \u2018Dirty Stream\u2019 is a very serious flaw, it\u2019s likely that Google is already\nworking on a fix as Microsoft would have shared any of the info it uncovered\nwith the search giant before publishing its alert.\n\n### More from Tom's Guide\n\n  * New Wpeeper Android malware adds a backdoor to your phone to steal your data\n  * Google blocked over 2 million dangerous Android apps from the Play Store last year\n  * FBI warns scammers are using \u2018free\u2019 verification services to dupe dating app users\n\nToday's best Bitdefender Mobile Security deals\n\n\u20ac6.93\n\nView\n\n\u20ac6.99\n\nView\n\n\u20ac9.99\n\nView\n\n\u20ac11.99\n\nView\n\n\u20ac15.59\n\nView\n\nShow More Deals\n\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n\nAlyse Stanley\n\nNews Editor\n\nAlyse Stanley is a news editor at Tom\u2019s Guide overseeing weekend coverage and\nwriting about the latest in tech, gaming and entertainment.

It literally\ncan't, it's just a GUID scanner to match apps with their app store versions.\nNot on the app store? Oh no it's horrible malware.\n\nApp store apps go through no processes to vet them for malicious behavior, as\nseen by repeatedly infected apps getting Gplay's seal of approval. A side\nloaded app is less likely to be malicious as at least the user knows where it\ncame from.\n\nReply\n\n  * Mark Spoonauer\n\n> CaptainBrowncoat said:\n>\n> \"How to stay safe from Android malware:\" don't sideload - but, hey, this\n> malware came from the Play Store, so we're just giving insipid \"advice\" that\n> doesn't work to do what we promise, anyway!\n>\n> I swear - do you guys really expect to be taken seriously when you\n> contradict yourselves like this?

I know every Internet company wants to be \"the\nfirst\" to report; but, in doing so, they don't just make mistakes, without\nproof-reading, but, they no longer fact check, and ensure proper grammar is\nused, along with incorrect spellings, relying fully on spell-check. Which\nreminds me of the old spell check joke: Eye no this is spelled core wreck lee,\nfour my com pewter tolled me sew. Regardless, get so sick of companies\nbypassing all the rules of proper journalism.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nYouTube Premium members can 'skip ahead' to the good bits with new feature now\navailable\n\nHow to watch Italian Open 2024: live stream the tennis from anywhere\n\nOne of the year's best-selling games just got pulled from Steam in over 170\nregions\n\nNew Android security flaw lets hackers seize control of apps \u2014 how to stay\nsafe\n\nCrystal Palace v Man Utd live stream: How to watch Premier League game online\nand on TV today\n\nGoogle Maps is getting a makeover \u2014 here's everything you need to know\n\n5 best shows like Baby Reindeer on Netflix, Prime Video and Max\n\nUdio gets a major upgrade \u2014 now you can make 15 minute songs\n\n5 dark sci-fi movies on Prime Video with 95% or higher on Rotten Tomatoes\n\nNYT Strands today \u2014 hints, spangram and answers for game #63 (Sunday, May 5\n2024)\n\nLiverpool vs Tottenham live stream: How to watch Premier League game online\n\n  1. 1\n\nHelldivers 2 will no longer require PSN on PC as Sony changes its mind\n\n  2. 2\n\nNew iPad Pro and iPad Air details leak right before Apple event\n\n  3. 3\n\nApple's first-ever foldable just tipped to launch next year \u2014 and it's a huge\n20.3-inch hybrid\n\n  4. 4\n\nHow to watch Apple\u2019s May 7 'Let Loose' event online \u2014 live stream the iPad\nlaunch\n\n  5. 5\n\nThe Boulies NUBI could be the perfect office chair if you\u2019re trying to outfit\na home office that\u2019s tight on space\n\n  1. 1\n\nHelldivers 2 will no longer require PSN on PC as Sony changes its mind\n\n  2. 2\n\nNew iPad Pro and iPad Air details leak right before Apple event\n\n  3. 3\n\nApple's first-ever foldable just tipped to launch next year \u2014 and it's a huge\n20.3-inch hybrid\n\n  4. 4\n\nHow to watch Apple\u2019s May 7 'Let Loose' event online \u2014 live stream the iPad\nlaunch\n\n  5. 5\n\nThe Boulies NUBI could be the perfect office chair if you\u2019re trying to outfit\na home office that\u2019s tight on space\n\nTom's Guide is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading\ndigital publisher.
