This marks significant progress towards advancing\nthe onboard digital experience as the company delivers a new era of rail.\n\nSeeking feedback from organizations: As the company identifies parties\ninterested in progressing high-speed connectivity, Amtrak is embarking on a\njourney to build a wireless network from the ground up along the Northeast\nCorridor.\n\nThe two RFIs include the following requests:\n\n  1. Organizations interested in deploying a fiber network along the NEC to support long-term digitization.\n  2. Metrics for understanding the market demand for fiber along six subsections of the 450-mile NEC route (Washington Union Station to Baltimore Penn Station, Baltimore Penn Station to Philadelphia\u2019s Gray 30^th Street Station, Philadelphia\u2019s Gray 30^th Street Station to Newark Penn Station, Newark Penn Station to New York Penn Station, New York Penn Station to New Haven Union Station and New Haven Union Station to Boston South Station)\n\nThe big picture: Amtrak is seeking partners to design, deploy and operate a\nfiber optics and wireless network that improves onboard passenger Wi-Fi,\nnetwork connectivity, and other use-cases. Following this RFI, an RFP (Request\nfor Proposals) may be issued to design and build a new high-capacity fiber\noptic cable along the route. Based on what Amtrak learns from these NEC-\nfocused RFIs, Amtrak will consider options to bring modern, reliable Wi-Fi to\ntrains throughout the country.\n\nAmtrak continues to transform the customer Wi-Fi digital experience to improve\nconnection, network reliability, stability, and faster access with:\n\n  * Acela software upgrades completed in April 2024 that improve Wi-Fi resource allocation on busier trains\n  * Upgraded 5G on the Amtrak Auto Train, Pacific Surfliner, and Acela\n  * Northeast Regional upgrades to 5G planned for Summer 2024\n  * The latest update on Wi-Fi improvements can be found here.\n\nInterested parties: Must complete a short questionnaire on a potential fiber\nnetwork along the Northeast Corridor.\n\n### For More Information\n\nOlivia Irvin MediaRelationsOakland@Amtrak.com Senior PR Manager\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n  * PHOTO/VIDEO: Amtrak Executive Laura Mason Tours Harrisburg Track Renewal Project May 3, 2024\n\n  * Introducing Amtrak Borealis trains with Expanded Service between St. Paul and Chicago via Milwaukee May 1, 2024\n\n  * Amtrak CEO Stephen Gardner Statement on the Retirement of STB Chairman Martin J.
