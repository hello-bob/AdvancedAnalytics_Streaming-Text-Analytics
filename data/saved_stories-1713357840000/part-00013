You have been warned.\n:)\n\nUnleash your creative spirit with Phantom of the Author-a, an AI-powered\nghostwriting app designed to transform your thoughts into literary\nmasterpieces. Whether you're crafting your first novel, spinning a short\nstory, or penning a powerful speech, Phantom of the Author-a is your silent\npartner in the writing process. With cutting-edge AI technology, this app\nunderstands your voice and style, helping to articulate your ideas with\nclarity and flair. Embrace the freedom to create with an intuitive interface\nthat ensures your writing is always authentic and engaging. Turn the whisper\nof inspiration into the roar of published work with Phantom of the Author-a,\nwhere your ideas come to life.\n\n## What is this?\n\nPhantom of the Author-a is an AI-powered ghostwriting app. It maintains\ninformation about your story outline, themes, locations, and characters, and\nuses that information to flesh out your story. You can use as much or as\nlittle AI help as you want. PotA currently has support for several engines and\nmodels: Ollama (Llama2, Gemma, Mistral, Mixtral), Anthropic (Claude3), and\nOpenAI (GPT4, GPT3.5).\n\n## Process\n\nPhantom of the Author-a is designed as a top-down, start to finish app. Using\nit in a manner other than specified below may cause unexpected behavior or\nerrors, because PotA makes assumptions about what tasks have already been\ncompleted. The supported process is:\n\n  1. Enter a seed idea for your story along with any other instructions. PotA will generate a basic story outline along with themes, genre(s), and target audience(s).\n  2. Validate and edit the story information to your liking.\n  3. Generate some locations for your story. You can generate as many as you like, and you can also include custom instructions each time you create more.\n  4. Validate and edit the location information to your liking.\n  5. Generate some characters for your story. You can generate as many as you like, and you can also include custom instructions each time you create more.\n  6. Validate and edit the character information to your liking.\n  7. Generate the overall structure for your story. This will create a hierarchy of acts and chapters, each with an associated outline. Note: This prompt may take a while.\n  8. Validate and edit the act and chapter outlines to your liking.\n  9. Create your story in a top-down, start-to-finish manner:\n\n    1. For each act:\n\n      1. For each chapter:\n\n        1. Create a list of scenes for the chapter. Include custom instructions if desired.\n        2. Validate and edit the scene outlines to your liking.\n        3. PotA may generate new minor characters for the scenes. Validate and edit their information to your liking.\n        4. For each scene:\n\n          1. Create a list of beats for the scene.\n          2. Validate and edit the beat outlines to your liking.\n          3. For each beat:\n\n            1. Create the prose for the beat. Include custom instructions if desired.\n            2. Validate and edit the prose to your liking.\n          4. Summarize the scene.\n          5. Validate and edit the scene summary to your liking.\n        5. Summarize the chapter.\n        6. Validate and edit the chapter summary to your liking.\n      2. Summarize the act.\n      3. Validate and edit the act summary to your liking.\n\n## Known Bugs:\n\n  * Deleting a beat does not refresh the beat list. You need to close and re-open the scene.\n  * Loading a story does not refresh the interface. You need to refresh the page.\n  * The Anthropic API requires a proxy due to CORS, so it will only work when running in development mode.\n\n## Local Setup\n\n  1. Checkout the code: https://github.com/daemonalchemist/phantom.wittrock.us/\n  2. Install dependencies:\n    \n        > yarn\n\n  3. Start the development server:\n    \n        > yarn dev\n\n  4. Enter your API key(s) for the Anthropic and OpenAI engines\n  5. Download and install the Ollama server if you want to run local models.\n\n## About\n\nNo description, website, or topics provided.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n1 star\n\n### Watchers\n\n2 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 2\n\n  * DaemonAlchemist\n  * andrew-wittrock\n\n## Languages\n\n  * TypeScript 85.3%\n  * SCSS 6.8%\n  * EJS 3.6%\n  * Shell 2.7%\n  * JavaScript 1.3%\n  * HTML 0.3%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
