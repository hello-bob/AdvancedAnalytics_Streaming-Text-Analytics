Phillips\nwas the man behind two of the best comedies of the last quarter century \u2013 Old\nSchool and The Hangover. He also, along with Judd Apatow, may have represented\nthe last comedy film giants, which says a lot about our culture. We went from\nMel Brooks to Zucker & Abrams to Harold Ramis to the Farrelly Brothers and Ben\nStiller to Phillips and Apatow. I am probably missing some big people in\nthere, but the point is for close to 50 years there were writers and directors\nwho defined their respective decade(s) for comedy movies. So it is fair for\nsomeone to ask why this stopped in the last decade.\n\nOne reason, in my opinion, is the increasing reliance on superhero and big\ntent movies for both revenue and comic relief, which has rendered the big\ncomedy movie a less attractive investment. Another reason is the comedy\nsensibilities of younger people appear underdeveloped at best and completely\nlacking at worst (Thor and Tik Tok cannot be the main sources of comedy for\nhumor to grow and survive \u2013 sorry to young people, including my nephew, but\n\u201cthat\u2019s facts\u201d). And then there is the reliable, and heavy over-reliance, on\nblanketly blaming \u201cwokeness.\u201d Wokeness has become this magical complaint that\nseems impervious to the most common complaint about overdone comedy from\ncomedians \u2013 that it is HACK. It seems on this one topic and term, there is no\nexhausting the bro comedians, the elder curmudgeons like Bill Maher and every\nother simplistic troll who just wants an easy answer to why things are not the\nsame as they were 10 or 50 years ago in with comedy. There is such little\nnuance and creativity, even in the complaining that a reasonable person could\nask \u2013 this is neither funny, nor original \u2013 is the only reason your keep using\nvaluable stage or screen time to lament this is because there is a sizeable\nportion of the audience who just like simple complaints repeated? I don\u2019t\nknow, let\u2019s ask a Trump rally hearing Trump share the same 4 phrases and 5\ncomplaints for the 7th straight year of his Hateful Moron gatherings.\n\nThat said, I am not unsympathetic to some nuanced complaints about political\ncorrectness, as I have had numerous issues with many of my most vocal, least\ninvested \u201cfans\u201d about jokes they do not like. Conflating good comedy with\nrighteous opinions, however, is bad for comedy and not great for society. I\nfeel like wokeness is maybe 10% of the problem and gets 95% of the blame. But\nwhen a comedy legend or genius is offering their genuine opinion on a shift in\ncomedy, based on their vast experience, it is worth at least listening and\nconsidering, even if you disagree.\n\nSo in Phillips\u2019 case, which is sort of a precursor to the current Internet\nrage/love being showered on Jerry Seinfeld, he had said he felt like he\ncouldn\u2019t make comedies anymore because things had gotten too woke (or whatever\nword he used in an interview). What followed from that, on the Internet, was a\nbarrage of \u201cthe guy with the unfunny frat movies can\u2019t make movies now?\u201d Now,\nPhillips did use certain language in his movies that would, understandable to\nme (some of you may still think being able to use homophobic slurs in 2024 is\nwhat stands between us and 1984), be out of step and maybe even frowned upon\ntoday. But his movies were massive hits across many demographics and were\ndefining comedies for their time. The revisionist history that vocal, and\noften truly unfunny people, need to put forward to make their disagreement\nwith a comedy writer a moral crusade is borderline pathetic. If Todd Phillips\nhas an opinion on comedy, he has more than earned the right to share it and\nhave it considered, even if you ultimately disagree. And of course, no one is\n\u201cstopping him\u201d from speaking, but I think you know what I mean.\n\nAnd then Phillips\u2019 film Joker made $1 billion and was nominated for 10 Oscars.\nClearly he has no business in Hollywood.\n\nThat brings me to the comedy complaint du jour \u2013 Jerry Seinfeld. Seinfeld\nrecently said, during the promotional tour for his new movie, Unfrosted\n(confession \u2013 I watched it last night expecting to hate it. I didn\u2019t. It was\nmostly fun, occasionally funny and campy in a Muppets Show sort of way \u2013 I can\nsee why people might have not liked it, but I think it\u2019s bad ratings and\nreviews may be influenced by his current bete noire status), that he believed\nwokeness and PC crap is hindering television comedy (I had listened to the\ninterview on the New Yorker podcast before the \u201ccontroversy\u201d broke out, but\ndid not think it was worth more than half an eye roll and a \u201cgood interview,\ndisagree on that point\u201d from me.\n\nJerry Seinfeld in Unfrosted\n\nBut what has now predictably followed is a series of complaints about\nSeinfeld\u2019s entire career and a listing of all the shows that prove Seinfeld\nwrong.\n\nOn the first point, I do believe Curb Your Enthusiasm proved definitively that\nLarry David was perhaps the Simon to Seinfeld\u2019s Garfunkel or his Stephen\nMerchant to Jerry\u2019s Gervais. But that does not erase Seinfeld\u2019s deep\ncontribution to American television and comedy history with Seinfeld. And his\nstand up career is legendary, even if he remains a stickler for well-crafted\njokes instead of producing glorified podcast episodes as annual \u201cspecials.\u201d\nAnd loads of people enjoy his Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. I can\nunderstand not being a fan of Seinfeld and/or disagreeing with his take here.\nBut this need to wholly erase a well-earned legacy to simply bolster a current\ndisagreement is Phillips all over again multiplied by five.\n\nBut the second part, where people are presenting all the shows that prove\nSeinfeld wrong... yes they exist (from Eastbound and Down (well not that\nrecent, but I need to always praise it) to It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\nto The Other Two there have been exceptional comedies recently that focus on\nterrible people and decidedly non-PC language and situations. But to defend\nSeinfeld, those comedies are now niche, like so much other great art (see the\nstore page of this very site to purchase and stream such brilliant, yet\ndisappointingly niche content). What have the best comedies at the Emmys been\nthe last 5 years? Ted Lasso. Schitt\u2019s Creek. The Bear. The last great FUNNY\ncomedy to win best comedy at the Emmys was Veep. (But J-L, you are forgetting\nabout Fleabag! Am I?) The culture clearly has embraced nice (or in the case of\nThe Bear, drama?) to be their celebrated comedies. Laughter has given way to\nfeel good, at least in what we have recently celebrated. So is Seinfeld wrong?\nIn my opinion, yes. But he is not completely without merit if you see how\npeople respond to Todd Phillips or what shows they reward with comedy awards.\nAnd the fact that some of the best and most successful comedy work on TV in\nthe last decade has been with Seinfeld alums Larry David and Julia-Louis\nDreyfuss (the only J-L I put above me and J-Lo in the J-L GOAT discussion)\nwould only further bias Seinfeld (understandably) to his show and era.\n\nSo people can agree or disagree with Seinfeld, but I believe, just like\nscience and other disciplines there are people who could be considered experts\nin comedy. In fact, just because Seinfeld chose to work clean only strengthens\nhis credibility to speak on this issue. He is not as self-interested as\nanother comedian might be when he expresses this. Rather, he seems to be\nexpressing a concern for the course he sees comedy taking in general, not his\npersonal comedy. Comedy is, of course more subjective than math or science,\nbut if you with one tweet or thread condemn Jerry Seinfeld as out of touch\nwith comedy and in the next post hail Ted Lasso as the proof that Seinfeld is\nwrong on comedy, then we can at least all agree that you are not that expert.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n\nThe Ballad of The 24 Year Root Canal\n\nJ-L Cauvin Jerry Senifeld PC wokeness comedy in 2024 Unfrosted Todd Phillips\ngreat comedies is comedy too woke\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n## Sign-up for J-L's Newsletter\n\n## Enter your email and we will add you to the mailing list!\n\nBy submitting this form, you are consenting to receive marketing emails from:\n.
