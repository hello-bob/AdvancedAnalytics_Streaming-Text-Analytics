Yet,\nwe\u2019re doing things just as stupidly as we did in the early days of cloud\ncomputing.\n\nIf you have not noticed lately, enterprises are running around in circles to\nfix mistakes they made 10 years ago in migrating and building new cloud-based\nsystems. Repatriation is shorthand for \u201cwhoops!\u201d The lack of planning and\nunderstanding has led to huge bills that nobody expected, and CIOs are\nattempting to mitigate. This means instead of focusing on innovation, we\u2019re\nlooping back to fix things after the fact.\n\n## Functional failure\n\nGenerative AI is not just a shiny new tool; it demands a radical rethinking of\narchitectural principles. Current trends show a heavy reliance on reusing and\nrepurposing old strategies without substantial innovation. This approach may\noffer short-term convenience but leads to long-term stagnation and, more\noften, \u201cfunctional failure.\u201d\n\n#### [ Keep up with the latest developments in cloud computing. Subscribe to\nthe InfoWorld All Things Cloud newsletter ]\n\nI use the term \u201cfunctional failure\u201d since all of these poorly planned\narchitectures work, but they cost between 2 and 10 times more than they\nshould. Moreover, they return no value (or return negative value) to the\nbusiness. This has been a common scenario in the world of cloud computing. It\nis generally a huge resource drain and hugely annoying if you work in these IT\ngroups, but it likely won\u2019t kill the business.\n\nAI systems are a lot different. For most businesses they have the potential to\nbe a huge innovative differentiator, meaning the business becomes that AI\nsystem. One example is intelligent supply chain systems that are being built\naround AI for some industry players; they are able to leverage this technology\nto build things faster and cheaper, and, at the same time, provide a better\ncustomer experience. Although most businesses will tell you that they do that\nalready, most don\u2019t, and a business that figures that out will disrupt its\nmarket like Uber and Netflix did.\n\n## It\u2019s a bespoke architecture, dummy!\n\nMost generative AI systems crafted today resemble each other too closely,\nwhich is concerning since the businesses they aim to serve differ\nsignificantly and have specific needs. As I stated above, generative AI should\nbe an innovative differentiator with unique solutions designed and built for\nyour specific business use cases. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s being done.\n\nWhen systems mirror each other, as they do with common frameworks, tools, and\napproaches, they fail to leverage their full potential and instead become\ncostly liabilities. I dread hearing, \u201cThis is the way that this guy showed me\nat a conference.\u201d Good architecture is designed for a very specific use case.\nThe chances you can replicate what you saw at a conference to a value-\ndelivering ending are nil.\n\nThe architect working for a specific cloud provider in Hall C at the 2:15 talk\ncan only provide you with general patterns, most of which are not useful to\nyour specific use cases and architecture. Sorry, there is no easy button for\nthis. Even during my presentations, if I see people taking photos of my\nslides, I\u2019m quick to remind them that the task is not to move through some\nstatic and reusable approach but to come up with unique and innovative\nsolutions for your specific situation.\n\nSuccess in generative AI depends on how well the technology aligns with a\nbusiness\u2019s unique needs. It is crucial to move away from one-size-fits-all\nsolutions and to craft bespoke architectures that are robust and agile enough\nto evolve with changing business demands. Instead of pursuing rapid deployment\nfor immediate gains, we need a shift towards thoughtful, strategic integration\nof AI technologies. Only then can we ensure systems provide long-lasting\nbenefits and adapt to evolving needs.\n\n## Getting smart quickly\n\nThe role of a generative AI architect should go beyond merely applying\nexisting technologies; it should involve pioneering new methodologies and\npushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. As leaders, we must foster a\nculture that not only encourages innovation but actively rewards it.\n\nAre we questioning established norms and continuously seeking opportunities to\nimprove and innovate? Are we blindly following other people\u2019s approaches to\ncompletely different business problems? It\u2019s time to stop imitating\narchitectural processes from hyperscaler conferences or reusing frameworks,\nspreadsheets, and slides developed for another project by whatever consulting\nfirm. You need to get smart quickly and stop copying off other people\u2019s\npapers.\n\nThe journey toward exceptional generative AI architecture for use in or out of\nthe cloud is challenging yet crucial. It requires a break from tradition, a\ncommitment to deep customization, and a resolve to innovate. I wish I could\ntell you this is easy, but we\u2019re about to embark on building core IT systems\nthat will define the business\u2019s value. Get it wrong, and the business is\nlikely to be displaced. No pressure.\n\nNext read this:\n\n  * Why companies are leaving the cloud\n  * 5 easy ways to run an LLM locally\n  * Coding with AI: Tips and best practices from developers\n  * Meet Zig: The modern alternative to C\n  * What is generative AI?
