He was a shining light of rationality and\nclarity in a world that is often a dark and murky place. He was also the\nauthor of, among many other works, Consciousness Explained, which I think is\none of the most important books ever written because it gives a plausible\nanswer to what seems like an intractable question: what is consciousness? And\nthe answer is, to the extent that it is possible to condense a 450-page-long\nscholarly work down to a single sentence: consciousness is an illusion.\n\nI don't know if Dennett would have agreed with my pr\u00e9cis, and I don't expect\nyou to believe it just because I've proclaimed it, or even because Dennett\nvery ably (IMHO) defends it. I might be wrong. Dennett might be wrong. You can\nread the book and judge for yourself, or you can wait for me to get around to\nit (and I plan to). But for now I just want to talk about what illusions\nactually are and why they matter for someone trying to apply the scientific\nmethod. In so doing I hope to persuade you only that the hypothesis that\nconsciousness is an illusion might not be as absurd as it seems when you first\nencounter it. I am not hoping to convince that it's true here -- that is much\ntoo big a task for one blog post -- only that the hypothesis is worthy of\nconsideration and further study.\n\nYou are almost certainly reading this on a computer with a screen. I probably\ndon't have to convince you that that screen is a real thing. But why do I not\nhave to convince you of that? Why can I take it for granted that you believe\nthat your computer screen is a solid tangible object that actually exists?\n\nThe answer can't be merely that you can see it. In fact, if you are reading\nthis, you probably actually can't see most of your computer screen! What you\nare seeing instead is an image on your computer screen, and that image is not\na real thing. Here, for example, is something that looks like a leopard:\n\nbut it is not a leopard, it is a picture of a leopard, and a picture of a\nleopard is not a leopard. The latter is dangerous, the former not so much. But\nthe point is that, when a computer screen is in use, most of it does not look\nlike a computer screen, it looks like something else. The whole point of a\ncomputer screen is to look like other things. Computer screens are the\nultimate chameleons.\n\nAs I write this, it is still pretty easy to distinguish between real and\nimage-inary leopards (and even imaginary leopards), but that may not be the\ncase much longer. Virtual reality headsets are becoming quite good. I recently\nhad an opportunity to try an Apple Vision Pro and it was a transformative\nexperience. While I was using it, I genuinely thought I was looking through a\ntransparent pane of glass out onto the real world. It was not until later that\nI realized that this was impossible, and what I was seeing was an image\nprojected into two very small screens. God only knows where this technology\nwill be in another few decades.\n\nNow take a look at this image, which is called \"Rotating Snakes\":\n\nIf you are like most people, you will see the circles moving. (If you don't\nsee it, try looking at the full-size image.) Since you are almost certainly\nviewing this on a computer screen, a plausible explanation is that the image\nactually is moving, i.e. that it is not a static image like the leopard photo\nbut a video or an animated gif, like this\n\nBut that turns out not to be the case. The Rotating Snakes image is static.\nThere are a couple of ways to convince yourself of this. One is to focus on\nvery small parts of the image rather than the whole thing at once, maybe even\nuse a sheet of paper with a hole cut in it to block out most of the image.\nAnother is to print the image on a sheet of paper and look at it there.\n\nThe motion you see (again, if you are typical) in Rotating Snakes is an\nexample of an illusion. An illusion is a perception that does not correspond\nto actual reality. Somehow this image tricks your brain into seeing motion\nwhere there is none. The feeling of looking out at the world through a pane of\ntransparent glass in a Vision Pro is also an illusion. And in fact the motion\nyou see in the animated gif above is also an illusion. That image is changing,\nbut it's not actually moving. And even if we put that technicality aside, you\nprobably see a rotating circle, but the white dots that make up that circle\nare actually all moving in straight lines.\n\nThe Rotating Snakes image is far from unique. Designing illusions is an entire\nfield of endeavor in its own right. Illusions exist for all sensory\nmodalities. There are auditory illusions, tactile illusions, even olfactory\nillusions. The first impression of your senses is not a reliable guide to what\nis really out there.\n\nThere are two other kinds of perceptions besides illusions that don't\ncorrespond to reality: dreams and delusions. You are surely already familiar\nwith dreams. They are a universal human experience, and they happen only while\nyou are asleep. But one of the characteristics of dreams is that you are\ngenerally unaware that you are asleep while you are dreaming. Dreams can feel\nreal at the time. It is possibly to become aware that you are dreaming while\nyou are dreaming. These are called \"lucid dreams\". They are rare, but not\nunheard of, and some people claim that you can improve your odds of\nexperiencing one with practice. I've had a few of them in my life, and they\ncan be a lot of fun. For a little while I feel like I am living in a world\nwhere real magic exists, and I can do things like fly simply by thinking about\nit.\n\nBut then, of course, I always wake up.\n\nThis is the thing that distinguishes dreams from illusions and delusions:\ndreams only happen when you are asleep. Illusions and delusions happen when\nyou are awake. The difference between illusions and delusions is that\ndelusions, like dreams, are private. They are only experienced by one person\nat a time, and they are not dependent on any external sensory stimulus.\n\nThe word \"delusion\" is sometimes understood to be pejorative, but it need not\nbe. Delusions are a common part of the human experience. Tinnitus and\npsychosomatic pain are delusions but the people who suffer from them are not\nmentally ill or \"deluded\". Even schizophrenics are not necessarily \"deluded\"\n-- many schizophrenics know that (for example) the voices they hear are not\nreal, just as people with tinnitus (I am one of them) know that the high-\npitched squeal they experience is not real. What drives them (us?) crazy is\nthat they (we?) can't turn these sounds off.\n\nDelusions don't even have to be unpleasant. They can be induced by\npsychoactive chemicals like LSD, and (I am told -- I have not tried LSD) those\nexperiences can be quite pleasant, sometimes even euphoric.\n\nIllusions, on the other hand, are only experienced in response to real sensory\nstimulus, and for the most part in predictable ways that are the same across\nnearly all humans and even some animal species. Illusions can be shared\nexperiences. Two people looking at the Rotating Snake illusion will experience\nthe same illusory motion.\n\nSo how do we know that illusions are not actually faithful reflections of an\nunderlying reality? After all, the main reason to believe in reality at all is\nthat it's a shared experience. Everyone agrees that they can see cars and\ntrees and other people, and the best explanation for that is that there really\nare cars and trees and people in point of actual physical (maybe even\nmetaphysical) fact. So why do we not draw the same conclusion when everyone\nsees movement when looking at Rotating Snakes?\n\nI have already pointed out that you can print the Moving Snakes image on a\nsheet of paper and it will still appear to move when you look at it. That is\npowerful evidence that the motion is an illusion, but it's not proof. How can\nwe be sure that there aren't certain patterns that, when printed on paper,\nactually move by some unknown mechanism? Maybe the Moving Snakes image\nactually causes ink to move around on a sheet of paper somehow. It's not a\ncompletely outrageous suggestion. After all, we know that printing very\nspecific patterns on a silicon chip can make it behave in very complicated\nways. How can you be sure that paper doesn't have the same ability?\n\nThe full argument that Moving Snakes is an illusion is actually quite\ncomplicated when you expand it out in full detail. You have to get deep into\nthe weeds of why silicon can be made to do things that ink and wood pulp\ncan't. But the bottom line is that we have a pretty good idea of how silicon\nworks, and we have a pretty good idea of how paper and ink work, and if it\nturns out that paper can ink could be made to do anything even remotely like\nwhat silicon can do it would be Big News, and since there hasn't been any Big\nNews about this, the best explanation of the perceived motion is that it's an\nillusion.\n\nThings are very different when it comes to consciousness. Consciousness is\nalso a universal human perception, just like the motion in Moving Snakes, but\nthe suggestion that it might be an illusion and not an actual reflection of\nreality is obviously far less of a slam-dunk than the idea that Moving Snakes\nis an illusion. In fact, most people when first presented with the idea\ndismiss it as absurd and unworthy of further consideration. For starters, we\nhave a good understanding of silicon and paper, but we don't have a good\nunderstanding (yet) of human brains (Dennett's book notwithstanding). We are\nnowhere near being able to definitively being able to rule out definitively\nthe possibility that our perception of consciousness is a faithful reflection\nof some underlying reality that we just don't understand yet.\n\nAnother argument against consciousness being an illusion is that it is\nprivate. All humans, and possibly some animals, experience it, but each of us\nonly has direct experience of our own consciousness. We cannot directly\nexperience anyone else's.\n\nThere is also an argument from first principles that consciousness cannot be\nan illusion in the same way that Rotating Snakes is: optical illusions are\nfalse perceptions, but they are still perceptions. In order to have a\nperception at all, whether that perception is a faithful reflection of an\nunderlying reality or not, there has to be something real out there to do the\nperceiving. Consciousness in some sense is that \"thing that does the\nperceiving\", or at least it is a perception of the thing-that-does-the-\nperceiving (whatever that might be) but in any case the idea that\nconsciousness is an illusion is self-defeating: if our perception of\nconsciousness were not a faithful reflection of some underlying reality, we\ncould not perceive it because there would not be any real thing capable of\nperceiving (the illusion of) consciousness. To quote Joe Provenzano: if\nconsciousness is an illusion, who (or what) is being illused?\n\nI will eventually get around to answering these questions, which will consist\nmainly of my summarizing Dennett's book so if you want a sneak preview you can\njust go read it. Fair warning though: it is a scholarly work, and not\nparticularly easy to follow, so you might just want to wait. But if you're\nfeeling ambitious, or merely curious, by all means go tot he source.\n\nIn the meantime, rest in peace, Daniel Dennett. Your words had a profound\nimpact on me. I hope that mine may some day do the same for a younger\ngeneration.\n\nPosted by\n\nRon at\n\n4/29/2024 03:41:00 PM\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\n####
