California startup touts its new battery technology as a fast-charging\n'universal adapter'\n\nby Rob Nikolewski, The San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nOfficials at a startup based in Carlsbad, California, expect a battery\ntechnology they have engineered will transform the way e-bikes and electric-\npowered hand-held tools are charged. And once it's scaled up, they believe the\ntechnology will reshape even more sectors of the economy.\n\n\"We unleash batteries here,\" said Daniel Glenn, president of ZapBatt, a\ncompany headquartered in a 4,000-square-foot office not far from\nMcClellan\u2013Palomar Airport.\n\nZapBatt engineers have designed a battery operating system that acts as a\nuniversal adapter for devices that run on electricity.\n\nAt his lab bench, company co-founder and Chief Technical Officer David Felzer\ntakes a 12-volt battery and, through a process using ZapBatt's software and\nhardware technology, increases the effective voltage level to 25 volts\u2014enough\nto power a cordless vacuum cleaner\u2014within a matter of seconds.\n\n\"Traditionally, you can't just plug in a 12-volt or 18-volt battery to the\nvacuum; it just won't work,\" Felzer said. \"But we're manipulating the voltage\nso that it gets whatever it needs.\"\n\nZapBatt's technology uses trademarked SCiB Toshiba lithium titanium oxide\n(LTO) battery cells during the process.\n\nAnd ZapBatt officials say their battery operating system opens the door for\ndifferent battery chemistries to easily integrate into all kinds of consumer\nproducts\u2014from electric power tools and appliances to e-bikes to industrial\nrobotics.\n\n\"This is really the starting gun for us,\" said Glenn, who is also ZapBatt's\nchief operating officer. \"We're ready for the market, and we are accepting\nanyone who's interested in this technology, and we're talking to some major\nplayers.\"\n\nAlready in partnership with Toshiba, ZapBatt and the Japanese electronics\ngiant recently announced an expansion of their collaboration efforts.\n\n\"Breaking through technological and cost barriers to enter markets previously\nout of reach, our technology can now be applied across a wider spectrum of\nmarkets,\" Toshiba Vice President and General Manager Greg Mack said in a\nstatement.\n\nOne of the selling points of Toshiba's SCiB technology is its safety.\n\nMost electronic devices use lithium-ion battery chemistries, which have\nresulted in instances of fires breaking out. While relatively rare, excessive\nheat or circuit malfunction inside a battery can lead to a chemical reaction\nthat spreads in a chain reaction in what's called a \"thermal runaway.\"\n\nBut Glenn said LTO batteries that ZapBatt concentrates on have zero documented\ncases of thermal runaway.\n\n\"This is a major, major point of advantage,\" Glenn said\u2014especially after a\nstring of deadly fires in New York City connected to overheated e-bikes. The\nNew York Fire Department in 2023 reported 267 fires that led to 18 deaths and\n150 injuries.\n\nIn addition, LTO batteries boast of operating at temperatures as low as minus\n22 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nZapBatt's battery operating system also touts:\n\n  * achieving 80 percent charge in less than six minutes, and\n  * extending battery lifespan to more than 20,000 cycles, even with fast charging and discharging.\n\n\"With LTO, instead of 1,000 or 1,500 cycles, you're getting 20,000 cycles off\nof these (batteries) with almost no degradation,\" Glenn said.\n\nThat would have major implications in a variety of settings, including\nwarehouses and distribution centers that increasingly rely on robots and\nautomated systems to move equipment and transport materials.\n\nFelzer envisions the advancements in battery technology growing from e-bikes,\nappliances, and manufacturing to electric cars, autonomous vehicles, and even\nairplanes powered by electricity instead of jet fuel.\n\n\"What's unlocked is a very interesting business model,\" Felzer said. \"Because\nnow you can scale across (battery) chemistries, you can scale across producers\nand manufacturers\u2014into all the markets you can conceive of in terms of\nrechargeable batteries.\"\n\nSafer battery technologies could also soothe concerns about thermal runaway at\nenergy storage facilities that run on utility-scale batteries. A 320-megawatt\nand 1,280-megawatt-hour facility between Escondido and San Marcos that\nrenewable energy company AES wants to build has run into opposition from some\nneighbors worried about a fire breaking out should the facility be\nconstructed.\n\nImproved battery technology \"has a lot of domino-effect implications,\" Felzer\nsaid.\n\nA study by the international consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated the\nglobal battery market will grow 30 percent annually as governments try to\nreduce their reliance on fossil fuels and transition to electrification.\n\nCalifornia policymakers intend to derive 60 percent of the state's electricity\nfrom renewable energy by 2030 and 100 percent from carbon-free sources by\n2045.\n\nA private company, ZapBatt was founded in 2019 by Felzer and Chief Executive\nOfficer Charles Welch. It has a staff of 12 full-time employees, including 10\nengineers.\n\nFelzer credits Welch with coming up with the company's name.\n\n\"It sort of makes sense,\" Felzer said because of the emphasis on batteries\nthat charge quickly. \"It's like zap\u2014just plug it in and, poof, it's fully\ncharged.\"\n\n2024 The San Diego Union-Tribune.
