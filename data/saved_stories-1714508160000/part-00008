Typically, traders will use\nserveral different displays so that they can keep track of multiple\ninformation sources at once. FDC3 helps with this by sharing the \"context\"\nbetween multiple applications, so that they collectively track the topic the\nuser is focused on.\n\n## 2\n\n### \ud83c\udfc3\u2642\ufe0f Work Faster\n\nFDC3 standardizes a way to call actions between applications (called\n\"intents\"). Applications can raise intents for other apps to resolve,\nextending each other's functionality. Instead of the user copy-and-pasting\nbits of data from one application to another, FDC3 makes sure the intents have\nthe data they need to seamlessly transition activity between applications.\n\n## 3\n\n### \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Platform Agnostic\n\nAs an open standard, FDC3 can be implemented on any platform and in any\nlanguage. All that is required is a \"Desktop Agent\" that implements the FDC3\nstandard, which is responsible for co-ordinating application interactions.\n(For a list of open source and proprietary desktop agents, see \"Platform\nproviders\" here.) FDC3 is successfully running on Web and Native platforms in\nfinancial institutions around the world.\n\n## 4\n\n### \ud83d\udd0c End the Integration Nightmare\n\nBy providing support for FDC3, vendors and financial organizations alike can\navoid the bilateral or trilateral integration projects that plague desktop app\nroll-out, cause vendor lock-in and result in a slow pace of change on the\nFinancial Services desktop.\n\n## 5\n\n### \ud83d\udc50 Open Standards Innovation\n\nFDC3 is developed collaboratively by a consortium of industry participants\nincluding banks, agent vendors, app developers and FinTech firms. By design,\nFDC3 is open to extension. We have an active community working on growing and\nimproving the standard with new data and intents.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThe design of FDC3 is based on a set of foundational interoperability use-\ncases, validated by firms across the industry.\n\nThis ensures the standard meets the real-world needs of the financial\nindustry, not just assumptions.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n## The Standard\n\nThe FDC3 standard consists of five main parts...\n\n# 1\n\n## The API\n\nCreate a consistent developer experience by adhering to the API standard\n\n# 2\n\n## Intents\n\nUse standardized verbs to instruct other apps to take an action\n\n# 3\n\n## Context Data\n\nShare context between apps to eliminate re-keying and streamline workflow\n\n# 4\n\n## App Directory\n\nDiscover trusted apps that can take part in a FDC3 workflow using an App\ndirectory\n\n# 5\n\n## Agent Bridging\n\nLink 2 or more Desktop Agent APIs together via a bridge to extend interop\nacross them.\n\n@experimental\n\nREAD THE STANDARD\n\n## Who is Using FDC3?\n\nThe FDC3 standards are created and used by leading organizations across the\nfinancial industry.
