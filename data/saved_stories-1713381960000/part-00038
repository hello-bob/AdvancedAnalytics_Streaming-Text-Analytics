The poster is a\ndentist and visited his parents house to see the new travertine they\ninstalled. It's no surprise that he recognized something right away:\n\nThis travertine would get the notice of any anthropologist. Photo: Reddit user\nKidipadeli75\n\nA section cut at a slight angle through a very humanlike jaw! I'm working in\nSouth Africa currently and I showed the image to some of our fossil\npreparation specialists today. Everybody agreed it is pretty cool!\n\nThe Reddit user who posted the story (Kidipadeli75) has followed up with some\nupdates over the course of the day. The travertine was sourced in Turkey, and\na close search of some of the other installed panels revealed some other\ninteresting possible fossils, although none are as strikingly identifiable as\nthe mandible. A number of professionals have reached out to offer assistance\nand I have no doubt that they will be able to learn a lot about the ancient\nperson whose jaw ended up in this rock.\n\nThis naturally raises a broader question: How many other people have installed\ntravertine with hominin fossils inside?\n\nTravertine is a limestone that forms near natural springs. Spring water that\nemerges from lime-rich bedrock often carries a high concentration of dissolved\ncalcium carbonate. When the water evaporates or cools\u2014especially near hot\nsprings\u2014this calcium carbonate precipitates as rock and may form very large\ndeposits around the spring. Travertine has an interesting internal texture\nwhen polished, and often has color bands and inclusions of calcite crystals,\nwhich make it an appealing choice for decorative flooring or wall covering.\n\nTravertine also commonly includes fossils. Many are fossil inclusions of\nalgae, plants, and small animals\u2014especially molluscs and crustaceans\u2014that live\nwithin the spring water. Much larger animals may be found and humans are no\nexceptions: Several well-known hominin fossil discoveries are from travertine\ndeposits. Most of these discoveries have happened because of quarrying of the\ntravertine deposits for use in construction.\n\nFor example, the Steinrinne site is on a terrace of the Wipper River near\nBilzingsleben, Germany. The site was quarried from the Middle Ages onward into\nthe twentieth century. Naturalists took notice of the fossils there in the\nnineteenth century, and straight-tusked elephants, woolly rhinos, and macaques\nall occur in great numbers, dating to an interglacial period sometime between\n470,000 and 280,000 years ago. Many of the archaeological discoveries at the\nsite were made by Dietrich Mania starting in 1969. Excavations since then have\nidentified stone tools and many animal bones with cutmarks from ancient humans\nwho butchered them\u2014even stone handaxes made from elephant bone.\n\nBilzingsleben cranial reconstructions by Vl\u010dek. Photo from Landesmuseum fur\nVorgeschichte Halle (Saale), Germany\n\nParts of at least two hominin skulls and a mandible were uncovered in the\ntravertine during Mania's excavations. The remains were first studied by\nEmanuel Vl\u010dek, who created reconstructions of the two skulls. They have many\nsimilarities with Homo erectus, as Vl\u010dek emphasized, including the thick\ncranial bone, thick and pronounced browridges, and highly angled occipital\nbone at the back of the skull. Today's scientists, while recognizing these\naspects, more often consider the skulls as representatives of an early\nNeandertal or related population, which sometimes is known as Homo\nheidelbergensis.\n\nAnother fossil human was discovered in an even more dramatic way. In 2002,\nMehmet Cihat Alcicek was examining fossils recovered from travertine quarries\nof the Denizli Basin of southwestern Turkey when he identified a cross-section\nof a hominin cranium. The upper and lower surfaces where the fossil was cut\nare well preserved, suggesting that more of the skull had likely been present\nbut no more was found. Dating of the travertine by Anne-Marie Lebatard and\ncollaborators in 2014 suggests that the individual lived sometime between 1.6\nmillion and 1.2 million years ago. The quarry that produced the fossil is near\nthe village of Kocaba\u015f, and that is the name by which the fossil has been\ndesignated.\n\n> \u201cGiven the nature of its discovery in a factory workshop, the hominin was\n> unfortunately reduced to a standard rough-cut tile thickness of about 35\n> mm...\u201d \u2014John Kappelman and coworkers\n\nThe shape of this portion of the Kocaba\u015f skull and its thick supraorbital\ntorus have led most researchers to identify it as a Homo erectus individual.\nThe endocranial surface of the frontal bone has granular impressions that were\ninitially suggested as possible evidence of tuberculosis infection. While this\nis still possible, later work suggested that these impressions may rather\nreflect a common condition in which the cranial bone remodels due to arachnoid\ncell growth.\n\nThe Kocaba\u015f skull points to the most obvious question that Reddit posters\nshared: Why didn't anybody notice a human jaw in the travertine before it was\ninstalled in someone's house?\n\nThis question isn't so hard to answer. Quarries rough-cut travertine and other\ndecorative stone into large panels, doing basic quality checks for gaps and\nlarge defects on the rough stone before polishing. Small defects and\ninclusions are the reason why people want travertine in the first place, so\nthey don't merit special attention. Consumers who buy travertine usually\nbrowse samples in a showroom to choose the type of rock, and they don't see\nthe actual panels or tile until installation. Tile or panels that are polished\nby machine and stacked in a workshop or factory for shipping are handled\npretty quickly.\n\nWhat this means is that there may be lots more hominin bones in people's\nfloors and showers.\n\nMost will be hard to recognize. Random cross-sections of hominin bones are\ntough to make out from other kinds of fossils without a lot of training.\nNoticing a fossil is not so hard, but I have to say that I've often been\nsurprised at what the rest of a fossil looks like after skilled preparators\npainstakingly extract it from the surrounding rock. The ways that either\nnature or a masonry saw may slice a fossil don't correspond to an anatomy\nbook, and a cross-section through part of a bone doesn't usually resemble an\nX-ray image of a whole bone.\n\nBelieve me, anthropologists don't want to hear about every blob of bone in\nyour tile. Bones from other kinds of animals massively outnumber hominin bones\nin large travertine deposits. Most tile and panels are cut thin enough that if\na fossil not clearly identifiable from its exposed surface, the thin portion\nbeneath the surface is not likely to identify it either. Nobody wants to drill\ninto your shower wall on a wild goose chase.\n\nBut certainly somebody has more pieces of the mandible from the Reddit post,\nand more pieces of the Kocaba\u015f individual are probably installed in hotel\nbathrooms all across Europe. If you take another look at your shower wall and\nsuspect an ancient human is looking back at you, it might actually be one.\n\nThe broader point is that a lot of the archaeological and fossil record has\nemerged as a result of industrial processes and construction. Paleontologists\nare in an uneasy symbiosis with quarries. The work of the rockcutters exposes\nunderground sections that scientists would never know for centuries, yet at\nthe same time it destroys evidence that might be recovered with enough\npaleontological labor. It helps for workers to have some training to notice\npotentially interesting finds as they encounter them, and for paleontologists\nand archaeologists to be engaged with the industries and construction projects\nthat often encounter ancient remains.\n\nAnd if you do happen find a jawbone in your bathroom, my suggestion is first\nto contact the local authorities. Sure, a fossil in travertine likely comes\nfrom hundreds of thousands of years ago. It isn't a crime scene. But depending\non your state or nation of residence, laws governing discovery of human\nremains on your property may be complicated and having the paperwork in order\nwith the police, sheriff, or coroner is the first step for most\ninvestigations.\n\nFor myself, I'll be following the Reddit story with interest\u2014I expect there\nwill be many twists and turns in the story of this jawbone. With some teeth\npreserved and abundant surrounding rock, I expect that specialists will be\nable to learn a great deal about the life of this individual and when he or\nshe lived.\n\nAssuming, that is, the parents wouldn't rather keep it where it is installed\nnow.\n\nNotes: I've included some references for the Kocaba\u015f and Bilzingsleben\ndiscoveries below. There is much more to say about both of them. Investigation\nof Middle Pleistocene and earlier travertine deposits is one of the most\npromising avenues to understand ancient environments in which human ancestors\nand relatives lived.\n\n### References\n\nKappelman, J., Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek, M.
