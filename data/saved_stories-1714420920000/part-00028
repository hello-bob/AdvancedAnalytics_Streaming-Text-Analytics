Here's how we addressed the issue of copyright\ninfringement and created a pro-artist business model.\n\nBy Julia Enthoven\n\nApr 15, 2024 \u2014 7 min read\n\nImage by Foreign Nolstagia on Tess\n\nWe\u2019re the creators of Tess, the first properly-licensed AI image generator.\nTess clarifies the ownership of AI art through a licensing agreement and a\nmodel trained in a single artist\u2019s visual style. The artist owns their style\nand gets paid each time it's used.\n\n# The problem\n\nDoes the world need another AI image generator? In a word, yes.\n\nNo one feels good about using current AI image generators because they cut out\nthe artist entirely. Although most small creators can\u2019t afford to commission\nillustrators, they don\u2019t embrace generative AI given the anger and frustration\nfrom the art community.\n\nIn a recent episode of Hard Fork, for example, tech journalist Casey Newton\ncommented that he recently stopped using AI generated images in his\nnewsletter, Platformer, because he \u201cgot a lot of feedback from readers that\nthey hated it\u201d and \u201cfelt like [he] was stealing money from artists.\u201d\n\nMany companies - including local newspapers under the Hearst umbrella - have\nprohibited their publications from using AI image generators due to ongoing\nlegal concerns. OpenAI, Midjourney, StabilityAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Google\nare all facing large lawsuits related to their image generators outputting\ninfringing material. Journalists we\u2019ve talked with say that they want to\nproduce more original art but are barred from the tools by their legal team.\n\nIn addition, the existing AI tools are hard to use. Unless you\u2019re a trained\nprompt engineer, most Midjourney and Dall-E results look robotic or straight\nout of a sci-fi movie.\n\nAI-generated images can look, well, AI-generated. (from an AI Substack)\n\nWith increasing restrictions on image generator prompts, it has become harder\n- not easier - to produce good-looking art. Serial creators and brands find\nthat it can be difficult to create images with a consistent visual style.\n\nScreenshot from ChatGPT\n\nSo, we\u2019ve set out to build an alternative that people feel good about using,\nthat empowers rather than cuts out artists, and that enables people to\ngenerate beautiful art in a consistent style.\n\nImage by Foreign Nolstagia on Tess\n\n# What is Tess?\n\nTess is an AI image generator that serves editorial teams, media companies,\nand creators. On Tess, each AI model is trained in a single visual style, with\npermission from the artist, and the artist gets paid each time someone\ndownloads an image.\n\nWe buy the rights to generated works from the artist through a transparent\ncontributor agreement. The artist works with Tess voluntarily (and\nexclusively) and defines what 10-20 works will be used to train the model.\nBecause of this, we can sell an editorial and commercial license to the\ngenerated artwork.\n\nImage by Foreign Nolstagia on Tess\n\nImportantly, Tess does not output images in a style it does not have\npermission to reproduce (unless that style is in the creative commons). We\nprotect artists who choose not to license their work to us by preventing users\nfrom generating in their style. While Dall-e and other image generators\nprevent users from generating in the style of a living artist and block\nprompts of copyrighted characters, Tess enables this powerful use case by\nhelping living artists own, share, leverage, and profit from their own AI\ngenerator.\n\nAs a result, creators and publishers can generate images on Tess without fear\nof copyright infringement.\n\n# A Healthier Ecosystem\n\nWhen someone uses Tess, they\u2019re supporting the artist who authored the style.\nBecause it reduces the cost and increases the speed of producing art, Tess\nopens up a large segment of the market that before could not afford custom\ncommissions, creating a new passive income stream for artists to make up for\ndisplaced work. Publishers can connect with the artists they discover through\nthe Tess marketplace, and artists have more visibility and control over who is\nusing their model and how.\n\n\u201cWhat Tess does is great because it works directly with the artists, so that\nthere is still a human aspect of the artwork,\u201d Andrea Sanchez, a Tess artist,\nexplains when asked why she joined the marketplace.\n\nTess was built in partnership with artists, ensuring proper attribution and\nroyalty payments, and we have about 25 accomplished artists onboard.\n\nWe\u2019re also in talks with several of the country\u2019s biggest news organizations\nwho are seeking an alternative to the legally-fraught AI image generators on\nthe market. Small creators - like musicians making band posters or bloggers\nmaking cover images \u2013 can feel good about using AI as their usage payments\nwill fund artists who have consented to put their style on Tess.\n\nImage by Foreign Nolstagia on Tess\n\nTess is designed to accelerate the design and illustration process, helping\nthe artist to scale their own creative capacity. Artists get access to their\nown model for free and leverage built-in ideation tools for prompting and\nediting. With features for brainstorming, transforming sketches into images,\nand making mockups in their visual style, design teams can use Tess as an\naccelerant rather than a replacement for human creativity.\n\nThe Tess licensing model can be applied to other media outside of image\ngeneration. In the future, we plan to expand Tess to voice, music, animations,\nvideos, and graphics in the future.\n\n# Why we believe in the Tess future\n\nAfter dozens of conversations, we believe that Tess is a better solution for\nall involved than the current generative AI applications. It enables artists\nto leverage the technology themselves and to benefit when their style is used\nin the wild. Tess is the first place where an artist can \u201cown\u201d their visual\nstyle. They can use it to free up their time and focus on more complex\nprojects.\n\nImage by Foreign Nolstagia on Tess\n\nWe hope that creators, individuals, and small businesses will find Tess much\neasier to use and feel better about how they contribute to the artistic\necosystem. For media companies, we envision that Tess will enrich the\nrelationship between artists and publishers, enabling them to collaborate more\neffectively, rather than blocking the human out.\n\nNot everyone agrees that Tess is good for the world. For artists who don\u2019t\nwant to be on Tess, we respect your choice; users won\u2019t be able to generate in\nyour visual style on our platform.\n\nThanks for reading! Let us know your thoughts and join the waitlist at\ntess.design.\n\nJulia Enthoven\n\nCofounder and CEO, Tess\n\n### How is this different from other \u201cethical\u201d AI image generators?\n\nSome image generators - like those by Getty Images and Adobe - claim to be\nmore ethical because they\u2019ve been trained only on licensed work or images in\nthe creative commons. This can reduce the quality of outputs significantly as\nthe model has learned from far less data, but it also means that the\nattribution and inputs are untraceable.\n\nAs a result, no other platform - to our knowledge - pays usage royalties to\nillustrators when their visual style is used or enables users to generate in\none consistent style. (Adobe Firefly also allows users to generate based on a\nreference image that they may or may not have the rights to use).\n\nIn contrast, Tess images are defined and transformed by a signal visual style\nfrom one artist licensed specifically for that purpose, making the credit and\nroyalty model more clear for both sides.\n\n### How do you train a model on such few images?\n\nTess uses a custom pipeline loosely based on SDXL to generate images. Each\nmodel is adapted and fine-tuned on the artist\u2019s visual style. Unlike AI\ngenerators by Shutterstock, Tess benefits from a large foundational model, but\nsignificantly reduces the risk of copyright infringement because the visual\nstyle outweighs (and significantly transforms) the underlying data.\n\nTess gets better and better as the underlying models improve, which means that\nthe artist stands to build more passive income through usage royalties over\ntime.\n\n### Does Tess dilute the value of the artist\u2019s work?\n\nWe believe that new tools increase the value of original ideas rather than\ndiluting them. As Tess grows, the impact of the artist's style grows too. More\npeople can leverage it to create original art, although the artist will still\nown the nuance of their visual concepts and innovative ideas.\n\nGiven that artists give up some control when joining Tess, we\u2019ve taken steps\nfor them to preserve the value of their personal brand. The artist can give\ntheir Tess model a generic name, a pseudonym, or their real name for\nattribution. Also, Tess images are watermarked with a C2PA-protocol metadata\nto help distinguish them from original works. Read more on tess.design/artists\n\n### Did you work with a lawyer on Tess?\n\nYes. We have worked extensively with a senior lawyer through the law firm\nFenwick to draft and iterate on a novel Contributor Agreement and licensing\nagreement.\n\n### Who else has contributed to Tess?\n\nThanks to the following people who have met with us about Tess: Jillian\nD\u2019Onfro, Steven Heller, Jamie Jiang, Katherine Schwab, Byron Walker, PJ\nLoughran, Yiren Lu, Sarah Roberts, Anjana Susarla, Lisa Iaboni, Chris Lyons,\nand more than 40 different professional illustrators.\n\nAbout the author\n\nHey, I'm Julia Enthoven! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nStartups, art, and local journalism\n\nTESS\n\nHomeFor PublishersFor ArtistsModelsBlogSign In\n\nResources\n\nTerms of Service\n\nPrivacy PolicyGuidelinesLicenseAbout Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Tess.
