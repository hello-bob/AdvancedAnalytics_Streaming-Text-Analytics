It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nWhat\u2019s Slowing You Down?\n\nWhat is your biggest inhibitor to shipping software faster?\n\nComplicated codebase and technical debt.\n\nQA, writing tests, and debugging.\n\nWaiting for PR review or stakeholder approval.\n\nI'm always waiting due to long build times.\n\nRework due to unclear or incomplete specifications.\n\nInadequate tooling or infrastructure.\n\nOther.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nThis year saw the launch of a new programming language consisting of one giant\ndata structure \u2014 so that programmers can avoid ever having to name things.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ca tongue-in-cheek reaction to the everpresent naming problem,\u201d software\nengineer Oleksandr Kaleniuk said in an email interview. \u201cNaming is hard so\nlet\u2019s not name anything at all and see if this way programming gets any\neasier.\u201d\n\nSpoiler: He then added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe language has no real-world applications but it\u2019s fun to play with both as\na developer and a user.\u201d\n\nEven the language itself has no name.\n\nZoom\n\nA snippet from the namingless programming language documentation.\n\n## The Language\n\n\u201cThere is one and only one data structure,\u201d explains the language\u2019s repository\non GitHub. \u201cSince there is only one, it doesn\u2019t need a name.\u201d Yet branches and\nsub-branches within that data structure can represent smaller arrays and even\nmatrixes. Pairs of characters indicate everything from strings and numbers \u2014\nas well as logical comparison and mathematical operations. (And there are even\nsymbols for reading or writing data from a file \u2014 or even deleting that file.)\n\n\u201cThere is also the operation. Not \u2018an operation\u2019 but \u2018the operation\u2019 since\nthere is only one operation in the language.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1.

Golang 1.22 Redefines the For Loop for Easier Concurrency\n\n\u201cSince there is only one, it doesn\u2019t need a name either.\u201d\n\nThe interpreter works its way through its one-and-only data structure, adding\nvalues onto the stack whenever it encounters the _ symbol, or operating on\nthem (if the _ symbol precedes a mathematical operation).\n\n> \u201cSince there is only one such language in existence, it doesn\u2019t need a\n> name.\u201d\n\nAnd the character pair for \u201chelp\u201d is e_ (so running a file named\nthe_namingless_programming_language would launch the help menu as soon as the\nparser hits the e_ characters...)\n\nThe resulting glob of source code is even used as the filename \u201cto avoid the\nnaming problem for the programs you write.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, the official repository on GitHub also stresses that even the\nlanguage itself also has no name. So the act of referring to it as \u201cthe\nnamingless programming language\u201d is, instead, merely speaking a definition of\nwhat this as-yet-unnamed language is attempting to accomplish.\n\n\u201cSince there is only one such language in existence, it doesn\u2019t need a name.\u201d\n\n## Inspirations\n\nYet there are some real programming concepts at work here. Kaleniuk says\nnamingless is \u201cjust a fancy name for stack-oriented and tacit.\u201d\n\nThis means it was inspired by languages like Forth, APL, and Uiua (which\nKalenuik says also incorporates array programming and stack orientation).\nHowever, in our email interview, he said his main inspiration was another\nstack-oriented language: PostScript.\n\nPostScript is famously a \u201cpage description\u201d language for the electronic\npublishing industry, sending not just data (about where lines and curves\nshould be drawn) but also code, according to Kaleniuk \u2014 \u201ca runnable program\nthat is open for interpretation by the machine that does the actual printing.\u201d\nAnd the same need crops up at Kaleniuk\u2019s job as a software engineer for a\nglobal 3D printing company.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be useful if the shapes to be printed could be encoded in a\nformula instead of a just one massive dump of data?\n\nKaleniuk settled on an array-processing language to keep everything concise.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about gigabytes of code/data.\u201d And since it\u2019s \u201c99% machine\nproduced and 100% machine consumed,\u201d it can also be highly abstract (since, as\nKaleniuk sees it, \u201cNobody would want to read that anyway.\u201d) That led Kaleniuk\nto settle on a stack-oriented language using highly abstract tacit\nprogramming.\n\nKaleniuk calls it \u201cjust an experiment in design, a thing to play with, a\ntoy...\n\n## Coding in Kyiv\n\nKaleniuk also writes a website with programming and math tutorials (along with\ndemos and quizzes) called Words and Buttons Online. (Just last month he added\na post running through all the technologies that were supposed to have a\ncompetitive advantage over his long-time programming language, C++.) And last\nyear Kaleniuk also authored the book Geometry for Programmers. (\u201cMaster the\nmath behind CAD, game engines, GIS, and more!\u201d says its official page at\nManning Publications (where the entire text is available online for free).\n\nYOUTUBE.COM/THENEWSTACK\n\nTech moves fast, don't miss an episode.

I did the same in 2014. It\u2019s like a rule. Every time you hear a blast \u2014\nyou donate. That gives you the illusion of control...\n\n\u201cYou also check that the financial system is still working.\u201d\n\nToday he says most of the software engineers he knows who aren\u2019t in the army\npay their taxes \u201cand split the rest between the army and the family. Although\nsome work for the front directly... We want the war to be over and we\u2019re\nwilling to pay for it...\u201d\n\nHanging over it all is a very clear sense that this is a war. \u201cSome already\npaid with their lives. My friend was killed in action a few days before my\nbook came out in print. He was a software engineer too.\u201d Kaleniuk tries to\nsplit his own donations between the ministry \u2014 who he said \u201cbuy shells and\nrockets\u201d \u2014 and non-governmental organizations and individual volunteers (who\n\u201chelp close urgent requests fast but they don\u2019t do weapons and ammunition.\u201d)\n\nThe first payment from his book\u2019s publisher came in early March of 2022 \u2014 just\nweeks after Russia\u2019s invasion \u2014 \u201cand I immediately donated that too.\u201d And the\nwar continued... In December Kaleniuk wrote on his website that \u201cAbout an hour\nago, a Russian missile hit something in my neighborhood. Again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a civilian, an engineer, and a mathematician, I can\u2019t do much about this.\nBut I can earn a few bucks and donate to people who can. That\u2019s what I have\nbeen doing since February, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m planning to do until the\nvictory.\u201d\n\n## Reactions\n\nEarlier this year Kaleniuk found his programming language being discussed on\nHacker News. And Kaleniuk was delighted that it received a \u201cmostly positive\nreception\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis kind of reminds me of super low-level programming, manipulating stacks\nof data etc,\u201d wrote Australia-based web developer Ben Winding, adding \u201cit\ncould prove to be a useful learning tool.\u201d\n\nThere was the inevitable discussion about how naming improves readability, but\nseveral commenters were appreciative of Kaleniuk\u2019s efforts, with one saying\nsaw the true value of the experiment. \u201cFrom my own experience, working on\n\u2018silly\u2019 projects like this, with severe artificial constraints for example,\ncan be quite interesting and challenging and lead to lessons learned that can\nbe applied to real projects later.\u201d\n\nKaleniuk says he\u2019s moved on to other projects \u2014 but feels richer for the\nexperience. \u201cI do keep the lessons I learned in mind so maybe some day you\u2019ll\nsee some awesome 3D printed thing and think \u2018How did they manage to print\nsomething that complex?\u2019 And you\u2019ll remember that small esoteric language with\nno real-world applications at all...\u201d\n\n## Epilogue\n\nTowards the end of the README file, Kaleniuk acknowledges the language was\ncreated \u201cto get it out of my system and it was a great success. I mean, I did\nget it out of my system successfully, and I somehow don\u2019t feel like playing\nwith it anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it beautiful? No,\u201d Kaleniuk posted on LinkedIn. \u201cIs it practical? Hell no.\nIs it fun? More than you\u2019d think it would be.\u201d\n\nIn our email interview, Kaleniuk also told us where that all leads to. \u201cI had\nfun with it, and now I shared the code so others could play with it too.\u201d\n\nDavid Cassel is a proud resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, where he's\nbeen covering technology news for more than two decades.
