We\ncalled it \u201cKritische Zone riechen und sehen\u201d, or, translated, \u201cSeeing and\nsmelling the Critical Zone\u201d.\n\nThe Critical Zone is all about the processes of living, about living organisms\nand their entanglements. The difficult thing about dealing with the Critical\nZone is that our usual mental models that describe the space we live in seem\ninadequate and insufficient: top-down maps may show geographical features but\nare frozen in time. Worse yet, they don\u2019t show any chemical, biological,\nmechanical processes of living, or any living organisms at all for that\nmatter. They capture a specific point of view, not a point of life (point de\nvue vs. point de vie as Bruno Latour would say). Sure, maps might sometimes\nshow a single tree, but not the other things that make the tree alive \u2013 the\nwater level, the rain, the chemical exchange between tree roots and bacterial\ncolonies, the parasites and the birds that hunt them and so on. There is no\nfuture nor past in a map, there is no illness, no movement, no birth or death\nin a map.\n\nIt\u2019s not a problem of scale, as it does not change even if we become very\nlocal, if we zoom in closely on one specific point. Here an example:\n\nOn the left you see the changes to Dubai over a time period of 1984-2016,\ntaken by satellite, looking down on earth from the outside. This is as an\nextreme example of terraforming and land development, fueled by vanity and the\npolitical will to build funny looking shapes into the ocean. And even with\nthis being the extreme example, the timeframe of thirty years is a large one.\nA casual observer drinking tea in the orbit and looking down on earth would\nnot notice the change brought by our processes of life.\n\nOn the right, a flock of common wood pigeons landed in front of my house in\nKarlsruhe, February 2021. The polar vortex broke in February, covering large\nparts of US and Europe in ice and snow. The wood pigeons moved from the woods\nto cities to find a bit more warmth and food. They move as individuals, until\nthey get spooked by an arriving bike driver, and fly away as a flock, as a\nsuperorganism. This slice of life may be human scale, but it still shows just\na point of view. The text description above is needed to turn it into a (very\nlimited, admittedly) point of life.\n\nSo Hanna and I decided to cast aside the hyper-global medium of maps and\nhyper-local medium of video, and searched for a new way to get attuned to the\nprocesses of living, of all the tiny interwoven actions happening within the\nCritical Zone. We arrived at similar but distinct approaches.\n\nHanna talking about the similarities in shape and texture between human-made\nand non-human made found objects\n\nHanna would take the workshop participants for a walk and let them gather\nmaterial, human-made and non-human-made alike. Gather everything that grew\naround the museum or was discarded by people. All the unseen, unintentional\nobjects in the surroundings. Like a dog that sheds hair, processes of life\nshed bottle caps, pieces of glass, feathers, drinking straws, leaves, bark,\nempty vodka bottles, screws, scrunchies, moss and concrete.\n\nAll the gathered material would later be arranged into sculptures and new\ntaxonomies by the participants.\n\nSome of the sculptures and taxonomic reorderings that happened in the first\nworkshop\n\nMy own approach was to try and capture the scent of the world around us. I let\nparticipants gather fragrance materials from within their homes \u2013 basically\neverything that has a smell \u2013 and use these to create perfumes. Old coffee\ngrounds, earth from a flower pot, fresh leaves, stale bread, or a mushroom\nfound in the garden \u2013 all that was welcome, all that we would mix together\ninto a perfume. A perfume of our own \u2013 very local \u2013 part of the Critical Zone.\n\nI see these perfumes as true \u2018scent maps\u2019 of one specific point of life. Not\nonly were the materials gathered by a person who (most of the time) somehow\ndecided to have them in their lives, scents are also seemingly immaterial\nwitnesses of material processes of life. Most smells that surround us are\norganic in origin, are witnesses of transformation of matter through living\norganisms, often unseen by us humans. Smell is a process. One other thing I\nparticularly like about smells is the sensory parallelism. Sure, some\nparticularly smelly molecule might be overpowering others, but most of the\ntimes what we perceive as a scent is a combination of many different scents,\nmany different organic molecules stemming from many different processes of\nlife. And we perceive it all at once \u2013 something that is impossible to achieve\nby mapping the Critical Zone in the usual, top-down way.\n\nOn the walk with Hanna we would sometimes also pick up fragrance materials,\nadding the surroundings of the ZKM to the perfumes.\n\nFragrance materials found around ZKM: cigarette butts, earth, leaves, sawdust,\nan old sock and moldy jeans.\n\nThe fragrance materials brought from home often included herbs and leaves,\nspices, as well as discarded cooking materials.\n\nTo extract a fragrance from the materials we would put them into freezer bags\nand put enough 96% alcohol to cover the contents.\n\nFreezer bags of fragrance material covered in ethanol.\n\nSoaking fragrance materials in alcohol and waiting for some time is the usual\nprocess for making tinctures. Of course, we didn\u2019t have the 3-6 weeks that it\nusually takes, but just the 3 hours of the workshop. To speed things up we\nused an ultrasonic machine commonly utilized to clean delicate things like\njewelry or glasses.\n\nWhile the machine is far from silent, it is not as loud as it appears in the\nvideo \u2013 the microphone in the camera is much more sensitive to the high\nfrequencies than the human ear.\n\nThe ultrasonic waves create cavitation bubbles in water and alcohol. As these\ntiny high pressure bubbles collapse, they agitate the liquids and move the\nfragrance molecules into the solution. A tincture that before would take 3-6\nweeks to create now takes just 10-12 minutes.\n\nAfter running the machine, we filtered the newly formed tinctures to get rid\nof larger pieces of organic matter.\n\nFiltering (from left to right):\n\n  * puffball mushroom, paprika, rotten mushroom, chili sauce, half-dried plantain peel (smelled tasty, of hot chili, a bit like mushroom pizza, but also a bit wet and mossy)\n  * rosemary, thyme, lavender and peppermint (smelled fresh, of lavender, grassy and a bit oily)\n  * caraway, lavender, evening primrose seeds, coffee grains, bread (smelled fresh, grassy but also sweet and warm)\n\nWe would label the filtered perfumes, and talk about what we think about the\nsmell. Interestingly, even though we used some questionable and uncommon\nmaterials, none of the scents could be described as \u2018repugnant\u2019 or \u2018foul\u2019.\nInstead, many smelled mossy, grassy, woody or fresh.\n\nExcept, perhaps, the one time a participant brought a 100 Kenyan Shilling\nbanknote with them \u2013 the lowest denomination and most commonly used note. We\ndid a tincture solely of the note, without mixing it with other ingredients.\nThe tincture took a while to filter through, and had a very intense metallic,\noily, dusty warm smell.\n\nHere are the results of the first batch of Critical Zone perfumes:\n\nLeft to right:\n\n  * mushroom from near the St\u00e4dtische Galerie Karlsruhe (smelled earthy)\n  * puffball mushroom, paprika, rotten mushroom, chili sauce, half-dried plantain peel (smelled tasty, of hot chili, a bit like mushroom pizza, but also a bit wet and mossy)\n  * mushroom, old sock, unwashed sheep wool, sage (smelled earthy, mossy, warm)*\n  * banana peel, peanut, peanut husk, mint, blackberry and blackberry leaves (smelled a bit fruity, grassy and tart)\n  * caraway, lavender, evening primrose seeds, coffee grains, bread (smelled fresh, grassy but also sweet and warm)*\n  * bovist mushroom, bolete mushroom, straw, dry grass, various branches (smelled earthy, mushroomy, spicy)\n  * sheep wool, lavender, mint (smelled of sweaty lavender)*\n  * sawdust, white lichen, dry leaves, grass (smelled woody and a bit of olive oil)*\n  * rosemary, thyme, lavender and peppermint (smelled fresh, of lavender, grassy and a bit oily)*\n  * rosemary, lavender, dried linden leaves, street jasmine, fir branch (dark, smooth, coniferous)\n  * spirulina (intense algae smell)\n\n*interesting scent, should try again!\n\nWith this process we captured the scents around us and moved them onto one\npoint, into one bottle. What was before atmospheric, nebulous, became\nconcentrated and focused. Which goes, perhaps, counter our notion that the\nunfocused, atmospheric, the background should be just as valuable as the\nfocused, clearly defined, the foreground.\n\nI thought of using a nebulizer to spread the perfume back into open space, but\ninstead got inspiration from another source: the pomanders and the long-beaked\npestilence masks of the Middle Ages, which used to house herbs and perfumes,\nintended to protect the doctor from the bad smells (at the time thought to\ncause the illnesses).\n\nResults for image search on \u2018medieval pomander\u2019\n\nAs we were wearing masks at the time (the future reader probably remembers\nthat there was once a pandemic when we had to wear masks indoors), we felt\ndisconnected from the scents in our surroundings through the thin cloths of\nthese masks covering our noses. So, we decided to invert the experience: to\nput the extracted scents of our surroundings onto our masks, allowing us to\nperceive the smell of the surroundings again.\n\nPutting the Critical Zone perfumes on our masks\n\nAnd so we went full circle, from not consciously perceiving the smells and\nassociated processes around us, to isolating and focusing on them, to bringing\nthem back to the periphery of our senses.\n\nThe Critical Zone is hard to map. Processes of life are disjointed in time and\nspace. Organisms turn out to be holobionts, assemblages of multiple other\norganisms for which the host is the territory. A simple task to list all the\nthings one organism depends upon explodes into describing half the world \u2013\nsince if I\u2019m dependent on bread from a bakery, I\u2019m also dependent on the well-\nbeing of the bakers and so on and so forth. I was quite discontent with the\nbeautiful bottles of colorful liquids that were created. They seemed too\nbeautiful, too precise, just one more of those things that are created to\ndescribe something but end up being a thing in itself. I suspect, it has\nsomething to do with our senses. Our eyes focus on just one thing, and\neverything we create for our eyes ends up being in focus, ends up offering\nonly one point of view at a time, covering up other things behind it. There is\nno simultaneity possible if we remain focused on one thing.\n\nAnd perhaps, there\u2019s quite enough things out there that let us focus on just\none thing. Enough visual media, enough displays, diagrams and films. Enough.\nPerhaps it\u2019s time to start describing processes in a medium that allows for\ntheir complexity. Like sound. Like movement and proprioception. Like putting\nthe extracted perfumes on our masks and forgetting about them. Let\u2019s allow\nourselves to listen to the peripheral, the background, the ephemeral. Let\u2019s\ngive ourselves time to smell the Critical Zone.\n\n##### See Also\n\n  * A village for Paul Signac\n  * Henri Matisse's home\n  * Marc Chagall's home\n  * Octopus hugging a tree\n  * Places of belonging\n\n\u041b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c, \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430, \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043b\u044b\u0432\u0443\u0442 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430, \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430, \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0432\u0438 \u043d\u0435\n\u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
