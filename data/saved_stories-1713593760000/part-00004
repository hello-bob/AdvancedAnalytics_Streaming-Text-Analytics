As he focused on getting there on time, he felt a\ntug on his arm and turned to see Starlax, his best human friend.\n\n\u201cOh, Flamey, I\u2019m so relieved you\u2019re here!\u201d Starlax exclaimed, dragging him\nalong. \u201cProfessor Evergreen is known to be a person with ATTITUDE.\u201d\n\nFlamey groaned. He wouldn\u2019t have signed up for this class if he had not missed\nthe registration deadline for another history course. APCSP was known to be\ndull and perplexing. Why did he have to learn about the old languages from the\nControlled Silicon Era that ancient computers used to speak? The textbook\nlisted a lot of strange names like Binary, Assembly, C, Python, Javascript\nblah blah. They went extinct 500 years ago!\n\nThey entered the room through a glass bubble door, where Prof. Evergreen was\nsitting behind his desk with lots of empty chairs. As expected, they were the\nonly two students today.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Prof. Evergreen muttered. \u201cI guess I have to adapt, otherwise this\nclass will not be offered next year. As history has taught us, modern kids\nhave no patience for long lectures. For today\u2019s topic \u2013 Binary, how about I\nstart with a poem?\u201d\n\nOh, Binary, the language of simplicity, With only 1 and 0, you create infinite\npossibilities. From two digits, a power grows Of logic, number, art, and code.\n\nFlamey and Starlax looked at each other, not sure what to say. With the eager\nlook of their professor waiting for feedback on his \u201cnew\u201d style of teaching,\nFlamey slowly raised his hand and opened up: \u201cErr... I want to know why Binary\nwas invented? Why didn't ancient computers use NORMAL math, like\n1,2,3,4,5...?\u201d\n\n\u201cConvenience, young droid.\u201d Prof. Evergreen elaborated, \u201cJust like the fact\nthat humans having ten fingers contributed to the popularity of the 10 based\nnumber system. Ancient computers used electric signals to communicate. So\nnatually 1 represents On, 0 represents Off.\u201d Professor gestured with his hand\nand a hologram of a cat flipping switch showed up. \u201cBy flipping the switch non\nstop, the cat generated the sequence of Ones and Zeros, which can be used to\nrepresent anything, including numbers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWow.\u201d Starlax was instantly convinced. Cat pictures are ageless for little\ngirls like her.\n\n\u201cSo here is the first rule of a number system\u201d, Prof. Evergreen projected a\nslide in the air:\n\nFor a X based number system, there are X symbols to use.\n\nFor example,\n\n10 based number system has ten: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\n2 based number system has only two: 1 and 0.\n\n\u201cWhat if a number system\u2019s base is larger than ten? Don\u2019t we run out of\nnumbers to use?\u201d Flamey quickly found a way to argue - how can you blame him?\nAs his brain cpu is set to teenage mode, argument is his specialty.\n\n\u201cYou can invent more symbols beyond 0 to 9, or just reuse existing symbols,\nlike letters.\u201d Prof. Evergreen replied as he had heard of this question\nmillions of times. \u201cFor example, the 16-based number system (Hex), which is\nalso very popular, uses: A for ten, B for eleven, C for twelve, D for\nthirteen, E for fourteen and F for fifteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh...\u201d Flamey was a little disappointed that his question was answered so\neasily.\n\n\u201cOnce we run out of single symbols \u2013 whatever the number is - we are going to\ncombine them to build more complicated numbers. \u201c Prof. Evergreen continued,\n\u201cRemember Place Value that you learned at Elementary school? It is the value\nof each digit in a number based on its position. Here is the second rule of a\nnumber system,\u201d Prof. Evergreen casted another slide in the air:\n\nIn a number system with base X, each symbol\u2019s place value corresponds to a\npower of X, with the exponent being the symbol\u2019s position, starting from 0 on\nthe right.\n\nFor example:\n\nDecimal number 2583 can be represented as: 2*10^3+5*10^2+8*10^1+3*10^0\n\nSimillarly, Binary number 1101 can be represented as: 1*2^3+1*2^2+0*2^1+1*2^0\nwhich is thirteen in Decimal\n\n\u201cWow!\u201d said Starlax, not sure she was complimenting the rule or the cats on\nthe slides holding signs.\n\n\u201cOh, it starts to make sense now.\u201d As immune to any cuteness as he can be,\nFlamey found something: \u201cSo you can convert a binary number into decimal by\nadding up those parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood find.\u201d Nodded Prof. Evergreen, \u201dBut we ran out of time. As science has\nshown, your attention must be depleted now.\u201d Prof. Evergreen walked out of the\nroom in a rush without even acknowledging his two students.\n\n\u201cHmm...\u201d Starlax looked at Flamey with a puzzled look, \u201cHe is definitely a man\nwith character, but not the way I expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d Answered Flamey, \u201cDon\u2019t think he overused cats to make a point?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope\u201d, Said Starlax, \u201cThere is no such thing as too many cats.\u201d\n\nLater tonight..\n\n", "frontpage": false}
