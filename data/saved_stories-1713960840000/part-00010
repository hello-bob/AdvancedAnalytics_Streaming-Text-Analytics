In contrast, at last week\u2019s close Informatica\u2019s shares\nstood at $35.19, translating the value of the company to $11.2 billion with\nthe inclusion of debt.\n\nAn email sent to Salesforce and Informatica enquiring about the deal didn\u2019t\nelicit an immediate response but an earlier email sent to enquire about the\nacquisition last week received a response from Salesforce saying that the\ncompany doesn\u2019t comment on speculations.\n\nAccording to analysts, if the deal went through, it would not only mean\nconsolidation in the iPaaS market but also a new revenue source for\nSalesforce.\n\nSalesforce was most likely to integrate Informatica\u2019s offerings with its\nMuleSoft offerings, which competes in the iPaaS market along with vendors such\nas Informatica, Oracle, SAP, Microsoft, Boomi, IBM, TIBCO, and AWS.\n\nMuleSoft, acquired by Salesforce in 2018 for $5.7 billion, offers the Anypoint\nPlatform \u2014 an iPaaS service \u2014 that offers integration, automation, and API\nmanagement capabilities.\n\nOn the other hand, Informatica offers similar services via its Intelligent\nData Management Cloud (IDMC) platform. Some of the services and components of\nthe platform include cloud API and application integration, Cloud B2B Gateway,\nCloud Integration, API Manager and API Center, and data integration among\nothers.\n\nExperts had said that the deal could be a significant opportunity for\nSalesforce as it comes at a time when the average enterprise, especially the\nlarge ones, has over 1,000 applications and data sources, which throws up the\nchallenge of cleaning up long-tail data and matching it with core enterprise\ndata.\n\nInformatica too, according to the experts, could have gained from the\nacquisition, at least from the investor\u2019s perspective.\n\nThe acquisition would be beneficial for Informatica to counter its perceived\ninability to communicate a roadmap or strategy that would satisfy Wall Street,\nthey said, with the warning that Informatica employees could have faced some\ndownsizing.\n\n## Related content\n\n  * news\n\n#### US government extends warrantless FISA monitoring\n\nSection 702 of FISA has a new lease on life thanks to a reauthorization passed\nover the weekend.\n\nBy Jon Gold\n\nApr 23, 2024 3 mins\n\nRegulation Government Privacy\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### Will AI kill jobs?
