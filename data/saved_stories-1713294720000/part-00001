Manet didn\u2019t have the guts to join them, so he participated in\nthe \u2018Refused\u2019 exhibit. The others understood that a real change was possible.\n\nMonet, Renoir, Sisley, Degas, Berthe Morisot, Pissarro, B\u00e9liard, Guillaumin,\nLepic, Levert, and Rourt all participated. They not only put their art in the\nshow, they organized and paid for it.\n\nA few lessons worth taking away:\n\nThe first exhibit was a financial and critical failure. The show received\nfewer than 1% of the number of visitors that the mainstream salon benefitted\nfrom, and there were few reviews, most of them negative.\n\nThey knew someone who had a building, and the empty space he offered them was\nenough of an instigator that it turned some maybes into yesses. Use it or lose\nit.\n\nOne of the most positive things to come from the exhibit was a scathing\nsatirical piece, the one that gave the impressionists their name. The insecure\ncritics came to regret their inability to see what was possible.\n\nAnd yet, the artists persisted. Year after year, eight times, gaining momentum\neach time, they returned, working their way from outsiders to become the\ndominant form of artistic expression of their time.\n\nBut most of all, so much easier today than in Paris 150 years ago, these\nindividual painters did two things: They picked themselves and they did it\ntogether.\n\nEveryone wants to be picked, but no one wants to organize the collective \u2018we\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s the \u2018we\u2019 that creates a school of thought, a movement, a network, a\nculture.\n\nCurate, connect, organize and lead. Who better than you?\n\nPS launched yesterday, a GOODBIDS auction for a very rare signed first edition\nof a nationwide bestseller.\n\nA rare signed first edition of Remarkably Bright Creatures. A beloved\nbestseller, this one is signed by the author with a doodle of the novel\u2019s\nstar.\n\nAnd new auctions coming later today.\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nShare This\n\nFacebook\n\n### Share on Mastodon\n\nPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
