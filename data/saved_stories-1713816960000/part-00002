Ives compared it to Apple CEO Tim Cook dropping a similar\nbombshell during its earnings call on May 2.\n\n\u201cThis would be like Cook on May 2 coming out and being like, \u2018OK, iPhone\n15\u2014now look, we\u2019re not going to have anything until iPhone 21. But trust us.\nThanks for being on the conference call,'\u201d Ives quipped.\n\nTo be sure, he said he remains bullish on Tesla over the long term but said he\nalso needs to hear Musk\u2019s growth strategy in China, which represents 60%-70%\nof the company\u2019s growth but where cutthroat EV competition has set up a \u201cGame\nof Thrones\u201d situation.\n\nMusk\u2019s credibility on the line as well, because the last few earnings calls\nwere \u201ctrain wreck horror shows,\u201d Ives added.\n\nThe stakes are high for Tesla after reporting quarterly delivery numbers that\nwere 13% below Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimates earlier this month.\nMeanwhile, Tesla stock is down 41% year to date.\n\nIn a research note last week, Ives said Musk and company are going through a\n\u201cCategory 5 demand storm\u201d in the EV market. He said Tesla is stuck between\n\u201ctwo waves of growth\u201d\u2014the first led by spiking high-end EV sales, and a\nsecond, which should come from mass-market EVs and robo-taxis. But despite\nthis narrative, \u201cpatience is starting to wear very thin among investors.\u201d\n\nThat comes after Reuters reported earlier this month that Tesla had abandoned\nplans to build the Model 2. Musk responded in a tweet, saying simply that\n\u201cReuters is lying (again),\u201d without clarifying.\n\nAmid the recent demand concerns, Musk also announced on April 5 that Tesla\nwill unveil its robo-taxi at the end of the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla cut prices on its EV in the U.S. late Friday, bringing some\nmodels to the lowest levels ever. That comes after Musk announced 10% layoffs\nlast week and recalled almost 3,900 Cybertruck pickups to fix or replace\naccelerator pedals that can cause unintentional acceleration.\n\nSubscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the\nfuture of business.
