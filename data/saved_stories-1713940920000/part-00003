He said he tried to beat the conditions and the\nsolitude of the journey by focusing on his own reaction.\n\n\"I try to focus on what's in my control,\" he told ABC News. \"I can't change\nthe wind and the waves. All I can change is how I react to it.\"\n\nTez Steinberg is the founder and Chief Engine Officer of a non-profit\norgani...Show more ---\n\nRichard Cummings\n\nSteinberg used his rowing challenge to raise awareness for ocean conservation.\n\n### MORE: How climate change affects atmospheric rivers\n\nHis solo trip from Hawaii to Australia was the second leg of an adventure that\nbegan in 2020 when he rowed solo for 71 days from Monterey, California, to\nOahu, Hawaii.\n\nIn an interview prior to his departure in December, Steinberg told ABC News\nhis journey while at sea during the first expedition inspired him to \"go back\nout again\" for his second expedition.\n\n\"I was so surprised by the experience of being on the ocean, by how beautiful\nthe ocean is, and also how much plastic I saw,\" he said at the time.\n\n## Embracing endurance after mental health struggles\n\nSteinberg told ABC News he began rowing as a way to help his battle with\ndepression, which he said he began experiencing while in college. At the time,\nhe said, he found a solution by participating in endurance sports.\n\n\"And it helped me feel better, which isn't a surprise,\" he explained. \"But as\nI went farther and farther, pushing myself through marathons and triathlons, I\ndiscovered this belief in myself that I'm so much stronger than I thought I\nwas.\"\n\nTez Steinberg embarked on his first expedition rowing from Monterey,\nCalif...Show more ---\n\nKelli with an Eye Photography\n\nHowever, in 2016, his life took a big turn after the sudden death of his\nfather, who died by suicide. The tragedy prompted him to challenge himself\neven more by solo rowing across an ocean. After successfully completing the\ntask without any prior professional experience, Steinberg said he realized he\ncould use his story to \"inspire other people to believe in themselves and\ntheir potential to change and grow.\"\n\nHe subsequently created United World Challenge, a nonprofit organization with\na mission to \"accelerate solutions for the ocean plastic crisis and inspire a\nmore courageous world,\" according to its website. The nonprofit was also born\nout of Steinberg's lifelong passion for the environment, having grown up\nsurrounded by forests in upstate New York.\n\n## Embarking on the second expedition with a new goal\n\nInspired by his first expedition, Steinberg said his new mission was intended\nto focus on \"ocean conservation, and specifically ocean plastic,\" adding, \"All\nthe plastic I saw at sea was just heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"And I couldn't come back and ignore it, and [I] needed to find some way to\nmake a difference,\" he continued. \"And so with [the] next expedition, [we]\nlaunched a crowdfund. And we're raising funds to build river barriers in some\nof the most polluted rivers of the world, stopping plastic before it flows to\nsea.\"\n\n### MORE: Effects of climate change worsening across US, new report says\n\nIn the previous interview with ABC News, Steinberg said the voyage from Hawaii\nto Australia would also be part of an attempt to break a Guinness World Record\nin combination with his first trip from California to Hawaii. Nevertheless, he\nsaid, breaking records wasn't his priority.\n\n\"If I complete this next leg [from Hawaii to Australia] in under 120 days,\nthen I have a world record for solo rowing the entire Pacific Ocean, from east\nto west,\" Steinberg said at the time. \"Personally, although a world record is\nexciting, that's not why I'm in it. World record is fun for media attention,\nbut really the media attention is just so that we can get more donations and\nsupport and action for ocean plastics.\"\n\n## Training and overcoming setbacks\n\nAs preparation for the journey, Steinberg said he ensured he was as equipped\nmentally as he was physically.\n\nTez Steinberg embarked on his first expedition rowing from Monterey,\nCalif...Show more ---\n\nKelli with an Eye Photography\n\n\"Things as simple as meditation, gratitude, journaling, just developing more\nemotional awareness,\" he said prior to the expedition. \"Because while I'm at\nsea, eventually my muscles will get tired, but nobody quits an ocean row\nbecause their muscles get tired, they quit because it gets too hard ... and so\na lot of my training and preparation for this comes back to mindset.\"\n\nDespite having trained for his first expedition, Steinberg said he had to\nstart from the beginning to prepare for his second expedition after\nexperiencing a heart attack in July 2022, an event he said occurred \"out of\nnowhere, out of the blue,\" given his good health record at the time.\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks\n\n### How climate change is affecting national parks\n\n### Community relocates due to climate change displacement\n\n### 2023 likely the hottest year on record\n\n\"And after that event, I had to completely rest, no exercise, no movement for\nthree months. And I was already planning this expedition,\" he said. \"I was\nstarting from zero ... I could do, like, three curls, I could walk for one\nminute before I needed to rest. And then five months after my heart attack, my\ndoctors had cleared me to resume training, green light across the board, they\ngave me their blessing for me to do the expedition.\"\n\nWhen discussing his feelings prior to his second expedition, he said \"I'm\nscared again, for sure.\"\n\n\"This is a very risky and challenging endeavor. And courage is not the absence\nof fear. It's choosing to take that step even when you're afraid,\" he added at\nthe time.\n\nTez Steinberg embarked on his first expedition rowing from Monterey,\nCalif...Show more ---\n\nSebastian Stewart\n\nUsing rowing as a metaphor in his message to the public, Steinberg noted, \"We\nall have waves washing overboard. I like to say we all have an ocean to cross,\nsomething in our life that seems too daunting, too bold or impossible to even\nconsider attempting. And I hope that this can be an example for people to find\ntheir ocean and the courage to cross it.\"\n\nIn his continued efforts to create awareness about his environmental mission,\nSteinberg shared a reminder that \"we all have a role to play in creating clean\noceans and a prosperous future and we can take action,\" even something as\nseemingly small as carrying a reusable water bottle or cutlery.\n\n\"And it's really through that level of engagement from a little bit from\neveryone that we can make a huge difference,\" he added.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, free,\nconfidential help is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
