Probably the most popular and\nexclusive accelerator in tech, they accept less than 300 companies while\nreceiving around 44k applications, resulting in an acceptance rate of less\nthan 1%. By comparison, Harvard has an acceptance rate of 3.2%.\n\nTwice a year, near the application deadline, you\u2019ll hear a chorus of YC\ngeneral partners telling you you should apply. It usually goes like this\n\n  * YC: You should apply to YC!\n\n  * Person: But I don\u2019t have a product\n\n  * YC: You should still apply, we let in a lot of people with just an idea!\n\n  * Person: But I don\u2019t have a co-founder\n\n  * YC: You should still apply, successful solo founders have made it into the program!\n\n  * Person: But I [perfectly valid reason not to waste your time]\n\n  * YC: You should still apply!\n\n  * Person: Wow, you\u2019re being very encouraging, does this means I have a chance to get in?\n\n  * YC: Almost certainly not!\n\nI have never heard anyone from YC ever give a reason not to apply. Why would\nthey?\n\nSo why is YC so keen on getting as many applications as possible?\n\n##\n\nMaybe YC wants the best?\n\nMore applications means a better cohort right? It depends on how you filter\nand whether they have an algorithm.\n\n###\n\nSuppose they have an algorithm\n\nIn this case, maybe you do want a lot of applications. But why not open source\nthe algorithm? Tell me I get N points if my startup is in one of these fields,\n-N points if its in one of these other fields, N points for ivy dropout, -N\npoints for over 40, etc. You can still apply discretion, but give me some\nguidance.\n\nSure you\u2019re giving up your \u201csecret sauce\u201d, but they do that all the time. Why\ndo they publish so many resources on start up best practices? They even\npublished the SAFE contract that ended up being standard for early stage VCs.\n\nThey could save tens of thousands of hours of valuable time of founders every\nyear by just giving some guidance as to whether to bother applying.\n\n###\n\nSuppose they don\u2019t have an algorithm\n\nIn that case, why do you need hundreds of applications for 1 spot? Assuming\nyou have some error rate, diversification works with a lot smaller sample\nsize. In fact, the 100th application is a net negative if you are actually\nlooking carefully at all the applications.\n\nI just don\u2019t believe that the partners carefuly consider tens of thousands of\napplications for a few hundred spots. They obviously have some screening,\nwhich they don\u2019t want you to know about\n\n##\n\nThe truth is YC wants a low acceptance rate\n\nThe real reason for maximizing number of apps and the bi annual BS chorus of\n\u201ceveryone should apply\u201d is because they want to maintain their exclusively and\nlow acceptance rate. If not consciously, then subconsciously for sure because\nthat's what all the incentives lead to.\n\nIf you know anything about YC, it\u2019s that it has a low acceptance rate. In\nfact, that\u2019s pretty much the only thing you need to know. Low acceptance rate\nmeans its exclusive and popular. Therefore they\u2019re \u201cthe best\u201d to start ups,\nlimited parterns and other VCs. Its true for VCs, universities and night\nclubs. Exclusivity is good signal.\n\nSo don\u2019t play into these stupid prestige games. As Peter Thiel said,\ncompetition is for losers. Things like YC are zero sum games. Much like\nlanding a coveted Supreme Court clerkship, there are a fixed number of spots.\nWhy be the umpteenth guy waiting on line to get into a nightclub that doesn't\nwant you? And the same system that rejects you benefits from the hype and\nsignal you helped them generate by your failed application.\n\nSo what's not zero sum? Friends and family rounds aren't zero sum. Your uncle\nis perfectly happy to keep his money in an index fund if your business plan\nsucks. Other methods of financing are less zero sum as well. At least your\ntypical VC isn't rejecting more than 99% of their pitches. How could they\nmanage logistically unless they had an entire cult of personality and\nmythology around their accelerator?\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Don't play status games\n\nmleverything.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nWhen did writing in major newspapers become so bad?\n\nRun on sentences, indiscernible insider nods and confusing narrative\nperspective plague major news publications\n\nMar 8, 2021 \u2022\n\nBee\n\n10\n\nShare this post\n\n#### When did writing in major newspapers become so bad?\n\nmleverything.substack.com\n\n13\n\nWhy does NBC make it so difficult to watch the Olympics?\n\nNBC drops the ball on distribution\n\nJul 26, 2021 \u2022\n\nBee\n\n2\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why does NBC make it so difficult to watch the Olympics?\n\nmleverything.substack.com\n\n4\n\ncomma.ai, self-driving cars and indefinite optimism\n\ncomma.ai gets punished for being open, so why would anyone even bother?\n\nFeb 16, 2021 \u2022\n\nBee\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### comma.ai, self-driving cars and indefinite optimism\n\nmleverything.substack.com\n\n1\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Branko\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
