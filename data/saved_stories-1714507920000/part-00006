Here's why they're almost certainly false.\n\nThe source of these articles is a new note from supply-chain analyst Ming-Chi\nKuo. Kuo's claims sometimes turn out to be true, but not always, and his\nlatest contradicts not only what we know about Vision Pro production, but what\nKuo himself said just a few months ago.\n\nSpecifically, Kuo is claiming that Apple reduced its sales forecast for Vision\nPro from a \"market consensus\" of 700-750K units to 400-450K units, a roughly\n40% reduction.\n\nThere are two reasons this claim doesn't make sense.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nFirstly, Kuo claims the decision is due to weaker than expected US demand,\nleading to a production cut ahead of global launch. Yet as recently as\nFebruary Kuo said Apple's US target for 2024 was 150-200K units, and in\nJanuary he said Apple sold almost 200K preorders. MacRumors separately cited\n\"a source with knowledge of Apple's sales numbers\" as saying Apple had sold\n200K preorders, particularly ironic given it's now presenting Kuo's claim and\nas if it were official news.\n\nBut more importantly, in January Kuo was referencing Apple Vision Pro\n\"achieving a shipment volume of 500,000 units\" as the goal for 2024. And this\nisn't just a random number - it's what multiple sources report is Apple's\nsupply limit for the year, regardless of demand.\n\nThe Financial Times, The Information, and The Elec have previously reported\nthat Vision Pro production is heavily constrained by the extremely limited\nsupply of near-4K OLED microdisplays. All three sources reported that Sony,\nthe supplier, can only produce enough microdisplays for less than 500K\nheadsets in 2024. And Kuo himself agreed with this figure, saying in a\nSeptember note that Vision Pro production in 2024 will be limited to \"at most\n400,000\u2013600,000 units\".\n\nGiven this, why is Kuo suddenly claiming the \"market consensus\" was 700-750K\nunits? It simply doesn't make sense.\n\nPlease disable your ad blocker or become a member to support our work \u2639\ufe0f\n\nApple Reportedly Can\u2019t Make Many Vision Pro Headsets\n\nApple reportedly can\u2019t make more than half a million Vision Pro headsets per\nyear due to limited supply of its near-4K OLED microdisplays.\n\nUploadVRDavid Heaney\n\nWith a $3500 entry price Apple Vision Pro was never going to be a breakout\nmass market hit. The product's very name suggests it's just the beginning of\nthe Vision headset line, and multiple sources have reported that Apple plans a\nmuch more affordable model later in the decade. But Vision Pro's price is\ndictated by its production and supply constraints, and it's those constraints\nlimiting its volume, not lower than expected demand.\n\nDon't believe everything you read.\n\nApple Vision Pro Review: A Heavy Portable Cinema & Monitor\n\nAt $3500, Apple sets huge expectations with Vision Pro. But does it deliver?\nAnd what\u2019s it really like to own and use?
