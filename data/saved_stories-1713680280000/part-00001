Not according to experts, who say such outages now really are\nhappening more frequently.\n\nThese recent high-profile cases have thrust one particular website into the\nspotlight.\n\nDowndetector is a platform which monitors web outages - its data gives an idea\nof the extent of the problems companies have been facing recently.\n\nMore than 1.75 million user-reported issues were flagged worldwide for\nWhatsApp on 3 April, according to the site.\n\nIt says tens of thousands were also reported for the App Store and Apple TV.\n\nNeither firm responded to the BBC's questions about what had caused their\noutages.\n\nBut Brennen Smith, vice-president of technology at Downdetector's parent\ncompany Ookla, says such instances reflect what they are seeing - which is\nmore outages taking place and a higher number of reports from users as they\nhappen.\n\n\"The internet is not exactly getting more stable,\" he told the BBC.\n\nTo understand why, you need to understand a little more about the internet\nitself.\n\nLike software, it is composed of many layers. And every time regulators demand\nchanges to platforms, consumers seek seamless access to data or investors push\nfor buzzy new features like AI chatbots, new layers are added.\n\nIntroducing more layers and complexity creates more risk of things going\nwrong.\n\n\"Right now there's a push for these mega giants to incorporate very game-\nchanging new technology into their products and services,\" Mr Smith said.\n\n\"I think with the push for innovation now, we're going to start to see tech\ncompanies move faster [but] it comes at the risk of potentially breaking\nthings.\"\n\n## Moving parts and thundering herds\n\nThe other thing to bear in mind with the internet: there are lots of different\nthings that can make it fall over. Typos in code, faulty hardware, power\nfailures and cyber attacks are just a few examples of why a service might go\ndown.\n\nEven severe weather, such as heatwaves, storms and natural disasters can\naffect data centres - the huge halls housing powerful computers, known as\nservers, upon which online services rely.\n\n\"There are a lot of moving parts, and if just one of those goes wrong you can\nsee problems,\" says Sam Kirkman of cyber-security firm NetSPI.\n\nAnother issue is lots of firms have moved from managing their servers and\ninfrastructure in-house to putting them on the cloud over the last decade.\n\nThat has enabled those firms to do more \"faster than they ever could before\",\nMr Kirkman told the BBC - but it also means a single outage in one place at\nthe cloud service provider can \"cascade across a lot of the platforms,\ntechnologies and companies we use today\".\n\nGlitches for some of the biggest names in the industry - namely Amazon Web\nServices (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud - have previously led to\ndowntime for thousands of customers.\n\nEven those impacting smaller, yet heavily relied-upon providers like Fastly\nand Cloudflare have also had a knock-on effect for services.\n\nThe UK government's portal gov.uk was among major platforms knocked offline\nwhen Fastly had issues in June 2021.\n\n  * 'It had just vanished' - the shock when tech fails\n\nSudden spikes in demand for a service can cause prolonged or complex outages,\nespecially on high-traffic events like Black Friday or during low-staffed\nperiods like bank holidays or weekends.\n\nTheories that Fridays see more outages than other days of the week may just be\nspeculation, Mr Smith says.\n\nBut he notes many firms do have policies not to ship updates or changes on\nthem.\n\n\"Less humans have hands on keyboards, less eyes on monitoring systems. It's a\ntime where you don't want to be rolling out changes,\" he says.\n\nIT glitches affecting Nationwide, McDonald's and Sainsbury's all took place on\nor began on Fridays in March, though they have been attributed to different\ncauses.\n\nMore widely, engineers trying to patch problems and get a service back online\nduring outages can also find themselves contending with a stampede of users\ntrying to get hold of it.\n\nCloudflare said it encountered one of these so-called \"thundering herds\" when,\nduring an outage stemming from a data centre power failure in November 2023, a\nslew of requests initially overwhelmed a recovery site.\n\n## 'Technical debt'\n\nUnderpinning all of this is another fundamental truth of the online world:\nwhile the services and products on offer grow ever more sophisticated, its\nbasic architecture is, often, quite antiquated.\n\nIn other words, the modern internet relies \"on a fabric of really old\ntechnology\", says Mr Kirkman.\n\nHe highlights Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - one of the internet's most\nimportant in determining where traffic goes - as a good example, shown by\nMeta's six-hour outage in October 2021.\n\nMisconfigured BGP updates by Facebook meant it essentially stopped talking to\nthe rest of the internet.\n\nAnd users of its platforms were likewise left unable to communicate with\nfamilies or manage their businesses.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nMr Kirkman says BGP represents an ongoing challenge because it has to be\nmaintained, but cannot be easily updated and minor configurations can take\ndown entire platforms.\n\nIt highlights what he says some might consider \"technical debt\" as an issue\npotentially affecting the whole of the internet.\n\nThese problems are not new. But our growing reliance upon online services\nmeans they are becoming an ever bigger challenge for firms seeking to prevent\nthem.\n\n\"What really we're seeing is that people are caring more and more,\" says Mr\nSmith.\n\n\"I'd say now more than ever, it's really important that services are able to\nstay resilient to stay online and still bring new innovations and features to\nmarket,\" he adds.\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
