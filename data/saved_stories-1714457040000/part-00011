There are plenty of similarities, but there are also\nimportant differences. I claim that the stereotypical personality of the\nHippie was high in openness. The stereotypical personality of today\u2019s social\njustice activist is high in neuroticism.\n\nIncidentally, you may have seen me mentioned by David Leonhardt in the New\nYork Times about the campus protests. He cites my oppressor-oppressed axis to\ndescribe progressives and civilization-barbarism axis to describe\nconservatives. He says that campus administrators are caught in the middle. I\nthink that scheme is actually a better fit for how people look at the Israel-\nGaza conflict itself, but it also pertains to the protests.\n\nBoth in 1968 and 2024 there were campus protests that drew the attention of\nthe media. In both cases, campus administrators were reluctant to crack down\non disruptive protests.\n\nBoth in 1968 and 2024 there were radicals who denounced America and praised\nthe the insurgents that most Americans thought of as bad guys\u2014the Communist\nVietcong in 1968 and Hamas in 2024. It should go without saying that the\nradicals who cheered the Communists were wrong on moral grounds. And the\nradicals who cheer on Hamas are wrong on moral grounds.\n\nIn 1968, the Communist-supporting radicals were at the fringe of the anti-war\nmovement. John Lennon made that point, singing \u201cBut if you go carryin\u2019\npictures of Chairman Mao, You ain\u2019t gonna make it with anyone anyhow.\u201d\n\nMost of the 1960s anti-war protesters were not pro-Vietcong. They were upset\nwith the sacrifices Americans were making and the casualties on both sides in\na war that seemingly had no end. They wanted American policy to aim toward\npeace, even if this meant conceding that the war would not be won.\n\nMuch of mainstream America came to agree that the war was a terrible mess.\nThey were tired of being lied to by President Johnson. They were tired of\nwatching what was happening to their young men in a far-off jungle land. They\nwere tired of South Vietnamese generals whose prowess was at staging coups\nrather than fighting the enemy. They were tired of the nightly television news\nthat made the war seem grotesque and hopeless. Even Richard Nixon, the\ncandidate of the more hawkish Republican Party, campaigned on a slogan of\n\u201cPeace with Honor.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, my sense is that the protesters are limited to the fringe that\nsupports the bad guys. There is no broader peace movement, as far as I can\ntell. I could be wrong, but I suspect that the anti-Israel movement on campus\nis not as popular with the student body as the anti-war movement in 1968. For\nmost people, sympathy for Hamas is too much of a stretch.\n\nI also suspect that the anti-Israel movement is not going to gain a large\nfollowing in the general public, the way that the anti-war movement gained a\nfollowing in the Vietnam era. American lives are not being lost in the Middle\nEast. Many Americans admire Israel and view it as a stalwart ally, which was\nnot their perception of South Vietnam.\n\nIn less than a decade after 1968, the Hippies had blended into the rest of\nAmerican society. Mainstream America adopted their music along with some of\ntheir style of dress and looser sexual norms. And the Hippies themselves found\njobs, without taking political crusades into the work place.\n\nI think that the Hippies were mostly healthy psychologically. Although some\ncults did form, and some factions were extremist in their goals and tactics,\nthe overall Hippie phenomenon was not a cult and the extremists were a\nminority. Because its distinctive personality characteristic was high\nopenness, it was aligned with free speech and with trying to persuade (the\nearly anti-war actions on campus were \u201cteach-ins\u201d at which government\nofficials were invited to debate anti-war faculty) rather than to cancel.\nPeople who were mostly straight could still be accepted by Hippies.\n\nBecause Hippies were not highly neurotic, the anti-war movement was able to do\nmore than sprout protests on campuses. It was able to gain sympathy and\nsupport from the general public and engage successfully in the political\nprocess.\n\nThe social justice activists strike me as closer to being a cult than a\nmovement. I think that the cult attracts people who are unhealthy\npsychologically. They have a lot of negative emotions, and the social justice\nideology serves to validate and reinforce those emotions.\n\nAt the work place, they are increasingly being viewed as toxic and impossible\nto integrate. And perhaps this is wishful thinking on my part, but I doubt\nthat their anti-Israel protests are winning many converts among the general\npublic.\n\nNoah Smith seems to agree with me.\n\n> Leftists would like to believe that the Palestine protests are\n> reinvigorating their movement; instead, I think they represent a dead end\n> that the movement won\u2019t easily be able to recover from, no matter who wins\n> the election in November.\n\nShare\n\nsubstacks referenced above: @\n\nNoahpinion\n\nPalestine is the end of the line for the New Left\n\nOstensibly, this is supposed to be an economic blog. So how are leftist\nprotests, like the ones currently happening at Columbia University, related to\neconomics? Unfortunately, there are several connections. First of all,\nleftists are potentially an important vector by which economic ideas enter our\ndiscourse \u2014 if it weren\u2019t for the Bernie Sanders movement, we probably\nwouldn\u2019t be talking about things like student debt relief, universal basic\nincome, national health insurance, and so on. The Seattle WTO protests\nhighlighted a bunch of problems with the way globalization was being done in\nthe 90s, Occupy Wall Street made financial reform more urgent, and so on...\n\nRead more\n\n7 days ago \u00b7 520 likes \u00b7 324 comments \u00b7 Noah Smith\n\n### Subscribe to In My Tribe\n\nBy Arnold Kling \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nimproving social epistemology, rewarding reasoned discourse\n\n80 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n16 Restacks\n\n80\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Hippies vs. The Woke\n\narnoldkling.substack.com\n\n53\n\nShare\n\n53 Comments\n\nGraham CunninghamSlouching Towards BethlehemApr 28\u00b7edited Apr 28Liked by\nArnold KlingSorry but your openness/neuroticism thesis - whether narrowly true\nor not - is largely beside the point. Anyone old enough to have been a teen in\nthe Hippie 'era' should know that it shared its most salient socio-\npsychological characteristic by far with today's student antics....namely\ngroupthink. The hard truth that Western liberalism so so struggles with is\nthat those people who are 'liberal', free-thinking and open-minded are (and\nhave always been) the exception, not the rule.Expand full commentLike\n(8)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n3 replies\n\nCWApr 28Liked by Arnold Kling\"In 2024, my sense is that the protesters are\nlimited to the fringe that supports the bad guys.\"There is a\nsociological/psychological experiment I have been thinking about for some time\nnow that I would like to see run.
