Other carmakers such as Xpeng -\nheadquartered in Guangzhou - have been attempting to compete with Tesla by\nrolling out similar self-driving functions in their cars.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Musk described Chinese car manufacturers as \"the most\ncompetitive car companies in the world\".\n\nTesla has taken previously taken steps to reassure Chinese authorities about\nthe rollout of FSD in the country, including establishing a data centre in\nShanghai to process data about Chinese consumers in accordance with local\nlaws.\n\nThe trip comes days after the US's National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdministration (NHTSA) said it was investigating whether a recall successfully\naddressed safety concerns relating to Tesla's driver assistance system.\n\nThe NHTSA said that despite requirements that drivers maintain focus on the\nroad and be prepared to take control at a moment's notice when autonomous\ndriving was enabled, drivers involved in the crashes \"were not sufficiently\nengaged\". The regulator's analysis was conducted before a recall Tesla said\nwould fix the issue.\n\nTesla's software is supposed to make sure that drivers are paying attention\nand that the feature is only in use in appropriate conditions, such as driving\non highways.\n\nMr Musk has promised that Teslas will be able to act as autonomous \"robotaxis\"\nfor years. In 2015, he said Teslas would achieve \"full autonomy\" by 2018. And\nin 2019, he said the company would have robotaxis operating by the following\nyear.\n\nThis month, the Tesla chief executive said he would reveal the company's\nrobotaxi in August.\n\nCritics accuse Mr Musk of consistently hyping up the prospects of full\nautonomous driving to prop up the company's share price, which has fallen on\nthe back of challenges including falling demand for electric vehicles\nworldwide and competition from cheaper Chinese manufacturers. Mr Musk denies\nthe accusations.\n\nTesla has been cutting the prices of its cars in China and other markets to\ndrum up demand.\n\n\"Tesla prices must change frequently in order to match production with\ndemand,\" Mr Musk recently said on X, the microblogging platform previously\nknown as Twitter which the billionaire owns.\n\nTesla recently reported a 13% fall in automotive sales to $17.3bn (\u00a313.7bn)\nfor the first three months of this year.\n\nOverall sales across Tesla dropped by 9% while its profits fell sharply to\n$1.13bn compared to $2.51bn for the same period last year.\n\nSo far in 2024, its share price has collapsed by 32%.\n\n## Tesla overtaken by China's BYD at end of 2023\n\n## China tech giant Xiaomi starts electric car sales\n\nElon Musk\n\nTesla\n\nChina\n\nRelated\n\n## Tesla Autopilot recall to be probed by US regulator\n\n2 days ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n## Tesla profits slump by more than a half\n\n4 days ago\n\nTechnology\n\n## Australia PM calls Elon Musk an 'arrogant billionaire'\n\n5 days ago\n\nAustralia\n\nMore\n\n3 hrs ago\n\n## Watch: Moment tornado hits power lines in China\n\nA tornado that hit China's Guangdong province killed five people and left\ndozens injured.\n\n3 hrs ago\n\nAsia\n\n15 hrs ago\n\n## Germany grapples with wave of spying threats\n\nSix arrests in quick succession show Germany is being targeted by spies but\nalso that it is fighting back.\n\n15 hrs ago\n\nEurope\n\n1 day ago\n\n## Why is the US going after TikTok?\n\nThe BBC's Suranjana Tewari considers what the future holds for the hugely\npopular social media app.\n\n1 day ago\n\nUS & Canada\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Hungary opens up to Chinese tech despite protests\n\nHungary is attempting to be a world power in manufacturing electric vehicle\nbatteries, despite locals' reservations.\n\n2 days ago\n\nEurope\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Blinken says China helping fuel Russian threat to Ukraine\n\nThe US Secretary of State was speaking to the BBC at the end of a three-day\ntrip to China.\n\n2 days ago\n\nChina\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
