His experience in university administration,\nparticularly in relation to computer science departments, is equally\ninsightful and troubling. Bogost notes that enrollment in computer science\ncourses at some of America\u2019s most prestigious universities has ballooned. At\nStanford and MIT, the number of students who graduate with computer science\ndegrees every year has doubled in the previous decade.\n\nThis is something which I experienced at my undergraduate institution \u2014\nSwarthmore College \u2014 as well. Competition for slots in introduction to\ncomputer science were doled out in a lottery every year.\n\nSome schools, like Cornell University and MIT, have created colleges of\ncomputing which allows students to remain hyper-focused on the field of\ncomputer science without having to take courses outside of these colleges.\nBogost asserts that universities should require students to take more classes\noutside of computation and mathematics \u2014 that this would make more well-\nrounded and thoughtful stewards of the field.\n\nBogost states that these days \u201cculture moves through computation\u201d. As a video\ngame designer and professor of computer science and engineering, it is\nunderstandable that Bogost holds this view. But is this what we want?\n\nAs a student and proponent of humanities education, computer science and the\nfields it enables - modern day econometrics, finance, and more \u2014 are at the\nheart of societies most pressing problems: data colonialism, alienation, and\nfinancialization.\n\nIn their ground-breaking article Data Colonialism: Rethinking Big Data\u2019s\nRelation to the Contemporary Subject, sociologists Ulises A. Mejias and Nick\nCouldry unpack the way in which data reconfigures the human experience and\nhuman relations. Mejias and Couldry posit that data, like oil or water, is a\nresource which can be extracted. How data differs from other natural resources\nis that it is at the center of our lives as humans navigating the modern\nworld. The authors write:\n\nData colonialism combines the predatory extractive practices of historical\ncolonialism with the abstract quantification methods of computing\n\nHistorically and in the present day, colonial powers reconfigure societies\nwhich they rule to meet specific goals. The graphic below (source) from the\nCenter for Economic and Policy Research shows how colonial railroads built\nunder British occupation had a profound and lasting effect on Kenya\u2019s economic\ngeography.\n\nColonial railroads were built with the sole goal of extraction: bringing\nnatural resources from the resource-rich interior of the country to a port for\nextraction, in this case the city of Mombasa. Through economic domination,\nsociety was completely reconfigured for resource extraction. The methods of\ndata appropriation in society today are not as overt; however, they too have\nresulted in the reconfiguration of our society and economy.\n\nTo extract our data, society must first be transformed in a way to make data\nitself a natural resource. Couldry and Mejias state that the availability of\ndata has to be constructed \u201cthrough an elaborate means of marketization\u201d. The\nnatural resource which results from our use of modern day technology is\ntransformed through the social quantification sector, the companies which\ntransform our data into usable tools. The reach of these entities knows no\nboundaries \u2014 every click on Facebook and Google, every second of video watched\non YouTube, and every like on Instagram is appropriated from the user to feed\nthe algorithm which drives the internal logic of these platforms. ChatGPT for\nexample, is trained on data extracted from and generated by people like you\nand me.\n\nThese companies obfuscate the appropriation of the data we create through\ncomplicated terms of service agreements \u2014 which theoretically would take on\naverage take 76 work days to read every year. If you do not accept the terms\nof these agreements, the functionality of applications you use everyday is\nseverely limited.\n\nIn this way, social interactions through these platforms has become an ipso\nfacto factor of production under data capitalism. The new logic of a post-\nMarxian techno-capitalism is an economic process which transforms life\nprocesses \u2014 in this case interaction through technology and social networks \u2014\ninto commodities. Data colonialism opens a new frontier for Marxian labor\nalienation: the way in which labor, in this case our contribution to these\nplatforms, distances us from our humanity. The outcome of these extractive\nprocesses is a platform which flips the relation between technology and user\non its head - through product placements and gamification, technology begins\nto use you.\n\nData has become king. Financial institutions, technology companies, and\ngovernments utilize increasingly complex algorithms which in turn require\nincreasingly immense sources of data to make decisions which have vast\nrepercussions for our daily lives. Financial markets rise and fall and policy\nis written based off complex processes of data extraction. When our lives are\nexpropriated, flattened, and slotted into databases, can we trust that our\nhumanity is well-represented when making these decisions?\n\nFor this reason, I must reject Bogost\u2019s assertion that computer scientists\nrequire a more well-rounded education to be stewards for the field. The\nproblem is not computer science itself, rather the internal logic of\ndatafication it advocates. A computer scientist working at Palantir with a\nhigh proficiency in a foreign language and an ethics course on their\ntranscript will not stop using facial recognition technology to perpetuate\nracist policing practices.\n\nSome of the richest and most powerful people today got their starts in\ntechnology. Beginning in the 1970s, computational science was inextricably\ntied to the military industrial complex. Tech billionaires may be individually\neccentric, but their interests were always connected to American militarism.\nThey have wielded their vast influence to fundamentally reshape society to\nbenefit their project of data colonialism and financialization.\n\nBogost, to his credit, raises an alarm \u2014 technology moves quickly, but it can\nalso be reckless: \u201cSomeone [may] ask you to solve a problem, and you solve it\nwithout asking if it\u2019s a problem worth solving.\u201d In China, the highest\ndecision-making bodies have been on a mission to solve problems with\ntechnology without interrogating the possible outcomes.\n\nThe PRC is an interesting case study in what happens when you let engineers\nand computer scientists run a society. The highest organs of power in the PRC\nare dominated by engineers. The STEM-ification of society in China has had\nsome horrific consequences.\n\nData collection - through super apps such as WeChat (\u5fae\u4fe1) and the worlds most\nformidable surveillance network complete with facial recognition technology,\nenable problematic predictive policing practices and the holding up to one\nmillion Uyghur muslims in political education camps. The flattening of the\nhuman experience into discrete data points can be seen in the architecture of\nthe often misunderstood social credit system.\n\nWhen I lived in Beijing, billboards at crosswalks like the one shown below\n(source) would name and shame citizens who were photographed jaywalking,\ndisplaying the last digits of their resident identify card number (\u5c45\u6c11\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc1) and\neven their address.\n\nChina, to its credit, does benefit from an increasingly safe society.\nOfficials estimate that the country experiences a homicide rate 1/10th of the\nglobal average.\n\nSome readers may believe that these tradeoffs are worth it. In China, I was\nable to leave my computer at my table in a cafe without fear of it being taken\nbecause I knew every square inch of that cafe was in the view of cameras.\n\nThese tradeoffs, however, require nuanced discussions and center around our\nagency as citizens existing in our respective societies. What cannot happen is\nour forced enrollment in a modern day colonial apparatus which considers our\ndaily existence - payment for groceries, riding the metro, digital connections\nwith friends and loved ones \u2014 as a resource to be exploited.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n  1.
