Rain is unusual\nin the UAE, on the arid Arabian peninsula, but occurs periodically during the\ncooler winter months.\n\nHomes were flooded and vehicles were abandoned on roadways across Dubai as\nauthorities sent tanker trucks into the streets to pump away the water. Many\nroads and other areas lack drainage given the lack of regular rainfall.\n\n> \u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f.. \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639 \u0645\u0646\u0633\u0648\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u0645\u0637\u0627\u0631 #\u062f\u0628\u064a#\u0645\u0646\u062e\u0641\u0636_\u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u064a\u0631\n> pic.twitter.com/8gswSzbJKJ\n>\n> \u2014 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a (@AlArabiyaUAE) April 16, 2024\n\nThe major shopping centres Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates had flooding,\nwith ankle-deep water in at least one Dubai Metro station, according to images\nposted on social media.\n\nLightning was seen flashing across the sky, occasionally touching the tip of\nthe Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest building.\n\nA partially submerged vehicle after heavy rain in the United Arab Emirates.\nPhotograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nThe National Center for Meteorology in a post on X urged residents to \u201ctake\nall the precautions ... and to stay away from areas of flooding and water\naccumulation\u201d.\n\nThe UAE government media office posted on its X account that the downpours\nwere an \u201cexceptional\u201d climate event.

Dubai\u2019s government also extended remote working for its employees\ninto Wednesday.\n\nDubai\u2019s international airport also diverted some incoming flights on Tuesday.\n\nCars lie half-submerged in a flooded street in Dubai on Tuesday. Photograph:\nAbdel Hadi Ramahi/Reuters\n\nEarlier the weather system caused floods across Bahrain, and left 18 dead in\nOman, on the eastern edge of the Arabian peninsula, on Sunday and Monday,\naccording to Agence France-Presse, including 10 schoolchildren swept away in a\nvehicle with an adult.\n\nThe UAE, which heavily relies on energy-hungry desalination plants to provide\nwater, started cloud-seeding operations in 2002 to address water security\nissues, but the lack of drainage in many areas can trigger flooding.\n\nCloud seeding involves using aircraft or drones to add small particles of\nsilver iodide, which has a structure similar to ice, to clouds. Water droplets\ncluster around the particles, modifying the structure of the clouds and\nincreasing the chance of precipitation.\n\nCloud-seeding experiments have taken place since the 1940s but until recently\nthere was little certainty the method had any positive impact.\n\nHuman-caused climate breakdown is supercharging extreme weather across the\nworld, driving more frequent and more deadly disasters from heatwaves and\nwildfires to floods. At least a dozen of the most serious events of the last\ndecade would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating.\n\nExtreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused\nclimate breakdown across most of the world. This is because warmer air can\nhold more water vapour. It is most likely that flooding has become more\nfrequent and severe as a result.\n\nAssociated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * United Arab Emirates\n  * Middle East and north Africa\n  * Dubai\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Strasbourg court\u2019s Swiss climate ruling could have global impact, say experts\n\n4d ago\n\n  * ### World Bank must take \u2018quantum leap\u2019 to tackle climate crisis, UN expert says\n\n7d ago\n\n  * ### Human rights violated by Swiss inaction on climate, ECHR rules in landmark case\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### MPs accuse Charity Commission of legal breach over climate sceptic thinktank\n\n5 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### US banks \u2018sabotaging\u2019 own net zero plans by livestock financing, report claims\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Millions go hungry as a billion meals binned every day, says UN report\n\n27 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Geologists reject declaration of Anthropocene epoch\n\n22 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018When it\u2019s this hot, time stands still\u2019: surviving west Africa\u2019s blistering heat\n\n22 Mar 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
