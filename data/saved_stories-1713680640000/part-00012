The Hollywood Reporter reports that a fake, partially AI-generated\nmovie trailer with Henry Cavill as James Bond \u2014 a fan favorite to succeed\nDaniel Craig \u2014 has racked up millions of views on YouTube.\n\nMisleadingly billed as \"Bond 26 - First Trailer,\" the fake casts Margot Robbie\nas Cavill's co-star, and envisions \u2014 in another common fantasy pick \u2014\nChristopher Nolan as director, according to the suspiciously ChatGPT-sounding\nsynopsis in the video description.\n\nCreated by KH Studio, which has dozens of fake trailers like these on its\nchannel, the video uses a mix of AI imagery and real movie footage, including\nscenes from what appears to be \"The Man From Uncle,\" Cavill's most Bond-like\nrole to date.\n\nAs of Thursday, the video has surpassed 2.5 million views, probably in no\nsmall part thanks to how much it tries to pass itself as the genuine article,\nfeaturing an AI-generated thumbnail that centers the two movie stars.\n\n\"Henry Cavill and Margot Robbie star in James Bond 26 with filming planned for\n2024!\" the top of the video description reads.\n\n## Get a Grip\n\nOf course, it's only beneath that faux trailer copy that the video's\ndisclaimer is hidden away.\n\n\"Please note that this video is a concept trailer created solely for artistic\nand entertainment purposes,\" KH Studio wrote. \"I have meticulously\nincorporated various effects, sound design, AI technologies, movie analytics,\nand other elements to bring my vision to life.\"\n\nBased on the comments, some viewers know it's a fake. Despite that, they're\njust thrilled to see their fantasy casting realized in one way or another.\n\nBut if there are suckers among them, it's not necessarily because they believe\nthe trailer is real \u2014 which inevitably there will be those that do \u2014 but\nbecause they seem to think it is somehow evidence of Cavill's suitability for\nthe role, despite the heavy use of hideous AI imagery. And honestly, we don't\nknow which is worse.\n\nIn keeping with the sheer incredulity of the comments, somehow almost none of\nthem point out a pretty comical error: Cavill, for some reason, speaks in a\ndistinctly American accent (more evidence of the trailer's riffing on \"The Man\nFrom Uncle,\" which stars Cavill as a US secret agent).\n\n\"[Cavill's] portrayal of Bond is set to redefine the character for a new\ngeneration, blending classic sophistication with modern edge,\" the synopsis\nreads. Evidently, some of that tide-turning \"redefining\" is turning this\nBritish icon into a Yank \u2014 a surefire hit in the making.\n\nMore on AI: A24 Admits Those Ads for \"Civil War\" Were AI-Generated\n\nShare This Article\n\nWhat Netflix Did\n\nNetflix True Crime Producer Responds to AI Allegations in \"What Jennifer Did\"\nDocumentary\n\nApr 19, 10:55 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nAI Romcom\n\nThe First AI-Generated Romcom Is Coming Out This Summer\n\nApr 16, 5:30 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nInnkeeper 3000\n\nUbisoft Shows Off AI-Powered NPC That Can Talk Back\n\nMar 20, 1:08 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nGenAI Sand Worms\n\nResearchers Create AI-Powered Malware That Spreads on Its Own\n\nMar 4, 10:38 AM EST\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
