In the\npast three years, 29 hospitals stopped delivering babies, according to a\nCalMatters investigation on maternity ward closures. Nearly 50 obstetrics\ndepartments have closed over the past decade.\n\nNow, California lawmakers are trying to slow the trend.\n\nAssemblymember Akilah Weber and Sen. Dave Cortese are pursuing legislation to\nincrease transparency around planned maternity ward closures, potentially\ngiving counties and the state time to intervene.\n\nWeber, a Democrat from La Mesa, wants hospitals to notify the state a year in\nadvance if labor and delivery services are at risk of ending. The measure\nwould also require the state to conduct a community impact report when a\nhospital indicates that it may lose maternity care.\n\nCortese, a Democrat from Campbell, wants to increase the public notification\nrequirement of an impending closure from 90 days to 120 days and require the\nhospital to conduct an analysis of how a closure could increase costs for the\ncounty health system, where the next closest maternity wards are located and\nwho is most likely to be affected.\n\nCortese\u2019s bill would also require increased notification for planned closures\nof inpatient psychiatric services.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to just discuss these issues and not implement policies to\nprevent or mitigate the harms and the continued disparities,\u201d Weber said\nduring an Assembly Health Committee hearing Tuesday.\n\n  1.

Cortese\u2019s bill is supported by nurses and consumer health advocates.\n\n### Why are California maternity wards closing?\n\nRyan Spencer, a lobbyist for the regional chapter of American College of\nObstetricians and Gynecologists who testified in support of Weber\u2019s measure,\nsaid there are often situations during birth where \u201cevery minute can be the\ndifference between life and death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if you are a patient like this and literally had nowhere to go who had\nto drive hours upon hours to get care? We have to find a way to end this\ncrisis,\u201d Spencer said during his testimony.\n\nLearn more about legislators mentioned in this story.\n\nDave Cortese\n\nDemocrat, State Senate, District 15 (Campbell)\n\nAkilah Weber\n\nDemocrat, State Assembly, District 79 (La Mesa)\n\nMaternity wards are closing for a number of reasons, according to hospital\nadministrators. They cite labor shortages, increasing costs, low\nreimbursements and declining birth rates.\n\nThe California Hospital Association opposes Cortese\u2019s bill and has registered\n\u201cconcerns\u201d about Weber\u2019s. The group argues that neither bill will address the\nunderlying reasons for maternity ward closures and may cause hospitals to\nterminate services sooner as employees leave and patients look elsewhere for\ncare, said Kirsten Barlow, vice president of policy with the hospital\nassociation during a Senate hearing earlier this month.\n\nCurrent law requires hospitals to notify the public 90 days before a proposed\nservice cut, but doesn\u2019t require additional notification to be given to the\nstate. Weber said that 90 days is \u201cclearly not sufficient for the state to be\nable to intervene.\u201d\n\n### Maternity care deserts emerge\n\nCalMatters found that 12 counties have no hospital delivering babies,\nincluding Madera County where the sudden closure of the county\u2019s only hospital\nin 2022 spurred a flurry of emergency legislation supporting distressed\nhospitals.\n\nMadera Community Hospital now is on track to reopen, but without a maternity\nward. The company reopening the hospital, American Advanced Management, has\nindicated that low insurance reimbursement rates factored into its decision to\nopen without labor and delivery.\n\n\u201cReopening maternity would be like reopening two hospitals at the same time,\u201d\nMatthew Beehler, chief strategy officer at American Advanced Management,\npreviously told CalMatters.\n\nStill, the bill authors and advocates are adamant that access to maternity\ncare is a necessity. National studies indicate that rates of preterm birth\nincrease and women receive less prenatal care when labor and delivery units\nshut down, particularly in rural areas. CalMatters found that maternity\nclosures in California disproportionately impact low-income and Latino\ncommunities.\n\n\u201cThis is really a very simple bill. It doesn\u2019t do much. It creates a public\nhearing opportunity at the local level to deal with issues that\nare...absolutely vital to the survival of our constituents,\u201d Cortese said\nduring a Senate Health Committee hearing on his measure.\n\nSupported by the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF), which works to\nensure that people have access to the care they need, when they need it, at a\nprice they can afford.
