By supporting JavaScript, we enable developers to write cron\njobs using a language they are already familiar with, and leverage the full\npower of the JavaScript ecosystem.\n\nWe also believe that JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for a\nalmost any task, from simple scripts to complex applications.\n\nWhat is a cron job and how does it work?\n\n    \n\nA cron job is a scheduled task that runs automatically at specified intervals.\nIt is commonly used to automate repetitive tasks like backups, updates, and\ndata processing. Cron jobs are configured using the cron syntax, which defines\nthe schedule and frequency of execution.\n\nWhat languages does support?\n\n    \n\nsupports only JavaScript. You can write your cron jobs in JavaScript and run\nthem on our platform, using any dependencies you need. We are working on\nadding support for Docker images in the future.\n\nWhat types of scheduling patterns does your platform support?\n\n    \n\nOur platform supports advanced job scheduling features beyond the standard\ncron syntax. Users can configure complex repeat patterns, specify execution in\ndifferent time zones, and exclude weekends or other specified days from the\nschedule.\n\nHow can I monitor the real-time status of my cronjobs?\n\n    \n\nReal-time monitoring is available on our visual dashboard, where you can view\nthe status of each cron job, including start and end times, and track any\nerrors or issues that occurred during execution.\n\nWhat log management capabilities does your service offer?\n\n    \n\nOur service provides comprehensive logging for each cron job. This includes\nautomatic logging of standard output and errors, advanced search\nfunctionality, log rotation, and the ability to download logs for offline\nanalysis.\n\nCan I see a visual representation of my cronjobs and their performance?\n\n    \n\nYes, our visual dashboard includes tables and graphs that display the status,\nruntime, and failure rates of your cronjobs, helping you to quickly assess\ntheir performance and efficiency.\n\nWhat analytics does your platform provide to optimize cronjob performance?\n\n    \n\nOur analytics feature offers insights and visualizations on execution times,\nresource usage, and failure rates. These metrics are invaluable for optimizing\ncronjob configurations and improving overall efficiency.\n\nHow does your platform handle notifications?\n\n    \n\nWe provide robust notifications through email, SMS, or platform integrations\nlike Slack and Microsoft Teams. You can set up notifications for job failures,\nsuccessful completions, or any changes in the job schedule.\n\nDoes your platform integrate with code repositories?\n\n    \n\nYes, our platform integrates with popular code repositories like GitHub,\nGitLab, and Bitbucket. This allows you to import scripts directly, with\nautomatic updates and synchronization when changes are made in the repository.\n\nHow does job version control work on your platform?\n\n    \n\nOur job version control system keeps track of different versions of your\nscripts. You can easily switch between versions or revert to an older version\nif necessary, ensuring flexibility and control over your job executions.\n\nWhat support does your platform provide for job dependencies?\n\n    \n\nOur platform supports job dependencies, allowing you to configure jobs to run\nin a specific order or to execute a job only after another job has\nsuccessfully completed. This is crucial for workflows that require sequential\ntask completion.\n\nHow can I interact with your platform using APIs?\n\n    \n\nWe provide a comprehensive API that allows users to programmatically interact\nwith the platform. This includes capabilities to trigger jobs, check statuses,\nand manage job configurations, offering flexibility for automated systems and\ncustom integrations.\n\n## Get notified when we're launching.\n\nJoin our waitlist to be the first to access our powerful platform and opt in\nto receive monthly updates.
