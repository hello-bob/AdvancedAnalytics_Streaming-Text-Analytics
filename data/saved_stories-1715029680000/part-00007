Now his company is suing the Securities and\nExchange Commission, and he says the future of the internet is at stake.\n\nPhotograph: Getty Images\n\nJoe Lubin is in a fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Not only\nis the financial regulator waging war against Ethereum, he claims, but making\na grab for jurisdiction over the future of the Internet. So Lubin has decided\nto punch back.\n\nIn 2015, Lubin was part of the team that created Ethereum, the computer\nnetwork home to the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency, known as ETH. Later\nthat year, Lubin founded Consensys, with the loose ambition to support the\ndevelopment and adoption of Ethereum and built software products on top of the\nnetwork. In April, Consensys received an unwelcome missive\u2014known as a Wells\nNotice\u2014from the SEC, informing the company that it was about to be sued. The\nregulator\u2019s grievance, Consensys was told, had to do with one of the software\nproducts in its stable: MetaMask, a crypto wallet that lets users store crypto\ncoins and interact with Ethereum-based apps.\n\nConsensys claims that the SEC notice, which has not been made public, states\nthat MetaMask has made the company into an unregistered securities broker.\nSpecifically, the SEC takes issue with two MetaMask features: one that allows\nusers to trade between different tokens and another that lets them lock up\ntheir tokens in exchange for a regular reward, in a process called staking.\n\nOn April 25, Consensys filed a lawsuit of its own against the SEC. The\ncomplaint accuses the regulator of an \u201cunlawful seizure of authority over\nETH,\u201d which \u201cbears none of the attributes of a security\u201d\u2014the specific type of\nfinancial instrument over which the SEC has dominion. The SEC having its way\n\u201cwould spell disaster for the Ethereum network,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nIn its Wells Notice, the SEC stopped short of calling ETH itself a security,\nsays Consensys, focusing instead on the MetaMask features. But according to\nConsensys, the agency has long been quietly conducting an investigation into\nEthereum, in the view that ETH should be reclassified as such.\n\nThat\u2019s not fair, claims Consensys, because an SEC director has previously\ndescribed ETH as a commodity, not a security, and the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission, a separate US financial regulator, has made the same\ncontention. \u201cConsensys built its business against the backdrop of this\nregulatory consensus,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nIn bringing the lawsuit, Consensys hopes to drag itself and Ethereum out from\nunderneath the SEC, by clarifying the limits of its jurisdiction, and embolden\nthe rest of the crypto industry to retaliate against what it describes as\n\u201caggressive and unlawful SEC overreach.\u201d An SEC spokesperson declined to\ncomment on the specific allegations made by Consensys, saying only that\n\u201cnoncompliance with the securities laws deprives investors of critical\nprotections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper\ndisclosures, segregation of customer assets, safeguards against conflicts of\ninterest, oversight by a self-regulatory organization, and routine inspection\nby the SEC. It\u2019s investors who get hurt and the American financial markets\nthat may suffer.\u201d\n\nThe following Q&A has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 17 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

Software developers wouldn\u2019t be able to develop Ethereum further or\nbuild applications on top of the protocol.\n\nIf the US has its way, it might use its long arm of the law to reach into\ndifferent countries around the world and create pressure to reduce access to\ndecentralized protocols and financial disintermediation.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to feel like we are being pushed out by an irrational or\nimprudent regulator. We need to stand our ground.\n\nWhat are you trying to achieve in bringing the lawsuit against the SEC?\n\nThe SEC\u2019s style is uncharacteristic of a public regulator. Many over the last\nfew years have complained that the SEC has been regulating through enforcement\nactions instead of open dialogue and clear rulemaking.\n\nOur action relates to MetaMask. But it stands alone, too. The SEC has been\ngaslighting the industry for quite a while, essentially declaring internally\nthat ETH is a security and enforcing that secret notion. It would continue to\ndo that, I believe, unless we brought an independent action that stands alone\non its own merits and gets at the heart of the matter: the SEC wants to\nreclassify ETH.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to land a technological paradigm shift into a society that feels\nlike everything is operating just fine. In past decades, internet technology\ncaused confusion and required lots of dialogue and open-mindedness. In the US,\nsafe harbors were created to enable web technology to flourish, which had a\nprofoundly transformative effect.\n\nThis time around, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s going to work out fine. But we\u2019re in\nthat really painful stage where there is resistance.\n\nSo, are you hoping the lawsuit will help to establish a safe zone, of sorts,\nfor Ethereum?\n\nA great outcome of this would be that we get clarity that ETH is a commodity\nand the SEC is forced, some time in 2025, to approve ETH spot exchange-traded\nfunds (ETFs). [ETH spot ETFs are a new breed of financial product awaiting\napproval in the US that would let people invest in ETH through a regular\nbrokerage, as if it were a stock, thereby avoiding the friction and perils\nassociated with storing cryptocurrency themselves.]\n\nJust as bitcoin spot ETFs opened giant gateways from massive pools of capital\ninto the Bitcoin ecosystem, the same thing will happen for Ethereum. More\nmoney means more attention. Decentralized finance [DeFi] will mature further.\nPeople will gain more access to DeFi.\n\nThat\u2019s the big change we are looking to see in the near term: the floodgates\nopening.\n\nThese kinds of cases can roll on for years. Will that uncertainty hamstring\nConsensys in the interim?\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 17 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

It\u2019s not likely to change until there are\ndecisions from the courts or Congress.\n\nIt sounds like the SEC was particularly interested in The Merge when it\nsubpoenaed Consensys last year. Can we assume the SEC is investigating whether\nETH looks more like a security post-Merge?\n\nIt\u2019s a plausible theory that the SEC is going to hang their hat on the idea\nthat ETH is a different kind of instrument post-Merge. But that\u2019s simply not\ntrue.\n\nThe network is more decentralized and more secure. It has a better mechanism\nfor achieving consensus that allows people to stake ETH as a guarantee they\nwill devote resources and labor to helping the protocol. Any compensation they\nget should be seen as income. There is no investment contract.\n\nConsensys\u2019 lawsuit alleges that the SEC is making an unlawful land grab in its\npursuit of jurisdiction over Ethereum. But to what end?\n\nConspiracy theory is my domain. My sense is that the US government likes the\nway things are, as do big banks. They have worked for decades to position\nthemselves with their hands on levers of power.\n\nThe US operates via intermediaries\u2014often financial intermediaries\u2014around the\nworld. Our technology is about disintermediation. It\u2019s about replacing old\nsystems with better systems that give more people and communities direct\nfinancial and political agency.\n\nThey don\u2019t want a world where people have direct access to financial\ninnovation. It\u2019s less about an SEC land grab and more about trying to kill or\nslow this new technology.\n\nThe question for Consensys was: Do we continue to operate in this gaslit limbo\nfor many years, or force clarity?\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * He emptied a crypto exchange onto a thumb drive\u2014then disappeared\n\n  * The real-time deepfake romance scams have arrived\n\n  * Boomergasms are booming\n\n  * Heading outdoors?
