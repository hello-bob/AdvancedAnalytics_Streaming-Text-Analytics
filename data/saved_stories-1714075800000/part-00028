Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# This company just bioengineered a plant-bacteria combo to clean air better\nthan an air purifier\n\nNews\n\nBy Lance Ulanoff\n\npublished 23 hours ago\n\nThe secret is bacteria\n\nNeoplant CTO Patrick Torbey, PhD and CEO Lionel Mora with the new Neo PX plant\nproduct (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)\n\nSustainability Week 2024\n\nThis article is part of a series of sustainability-themed articles we're\nrunning to observe Earth Day 2024 and promote more sustainable practices.\nCheck out all of our Sustainability Week 2024 content.\n\nPlants and trees take carbon monoxide from the atmosphere. That\u2019s common\nknowledge, but given the amount of pollutants we produce, both outdoors and in\nour homes, plant life can only do so much to clean our air. However, the\nbioengineering firm Neoplants has a new idea \u2013 and it may change the way you\nfeel about houseplants and their air-cleaning capabilities.\n\nThis week, the French company launched its first product: Neo Px. It\u2019s not\ntechnology in the traditional sense. In fact, almost all of it is organic or\nreclaimed. Inside a home, you might be challenged to even spot the product,\nwhich is the result of four years of bioengineering research and directed\nevolution. And where hardware and software engineers work in ones and zeros,\nNeoplant\u2019s scientists worked with four letters, specifically the letters\ndenoting four of the components of DNA \u2013 Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine\n(G), and Thymine (T) \u2013 to re-engineer toxin-eating bacteria and create a new\nkind of eco-forward house plant.\n\nThis plant is more powerful than it looks (Image credit: Future / Lance\nUlanoff)\n\nSitting last week with the company\u2019s co-founders, CEO Lionel Mora and CTO\nPatrick Torbey, PhD, who has a doctorate in genomic engineering, amid roughly\n30 house plants, they directed my attention to one single, vibrant, marble\nqueen pothos resting in a beige planter. This was no typical plant. The\nplanter, or self-watering \u201cshell,\u201d as they called it is made of bioplastics\nfrom recycled agricultural waste, and features a vented shell and basket\ninterior that holds the plant with \u201csupercharged air purification capability.\u201d\n\nIt can, they explained, pull from the air 30 times more volatile organic\ncompounds (VOCs) than a typical plant; or, more specifically, do on its own\nthe work of the 30 other plants stuffed into the hotel room.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\n> @techradar\n>\n> \u266c So Much Happiness - Lux-Inspira\n\nThe secret is not so much the plant as it is a symbiotic relationship between\nNeoplants' bioengineered bacterium and the leafy pothos. Every month, the\nplant gets a dose of Power Drops, a powered solution that you mix with water\nand then pour into the plant\u2019s soil. This delivers the powerful bacteria\n(normal plants also have bacteria on them and in their soil, just as your\nbiome has healthy bacteria on your skin and in your gut), which then live\namong the roots and pull in toxins through the leaves and soil (thanks to the\nvents in the plant basket that pull in air and move it over the roots), which\nthey convert to nutrients for the plant.\n\nThe NeoPx system. (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)\n\nWhile the bacteria occurs in nature, this is not the same bacteria you\u2019d find\nin nature. Four years ago, Neoplants' researchers began traveling to polluted\nregions to look for bacteria that appeared to thrive in those conditions. The\ncompany then pressure-tested the bacteria to see which ones worked best with\nhigher levels of VOCs. As it did this, it also identified the bacteria that\nwere able to adapt to handle ever-increasing levels of pollutants. It was\nthrough this process of directed evolution that it engineered its custom, VOC-\nloving strain, also known as pseudomonas putida. The pairing with the pothos\nis also specific since, the co-founders told me, the company can\u2019t guarantee\nthe bacteria will be as effective with a different plant.\n\nNow, the company is ready to start selling its first product, a Neo Px package\nthat for $139 includes the plant, shell, six packets of the Power Drops\nmixture, and a glass beaker and stirrer (just like the lab) to mix it. Those\nwho pay for a six-month supply of the bacteria upfront can get the package for\n$119. Quarterly Power Drops supplies cost $39.\n\n## Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\n\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion,\nanalysis and more from the TechRadar team.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nOne plant covers the air quality for a typical-sized bedroom. If you want more\ncoverage, you'll need more plants and Power Drops.\n\nThe aerated basket helps dirty air move over the plants bacteria-covered root\nsystem. This is also a self-watering plant \u2013 water is poured into the side and\na pair of strings suck up the water as needed (Image credit: Future / Lance\nUlanoff)\n\nThat\u2019s not cheap, and it\u2019s not clear how people who normally forget to water\ntheir regular plants will remember to feed their Neo Px plant the VOC-cleaning\nbacterium each month. It\u2019s not hard to do, but people will forget, and others\nmay balk at the upkeep price for what appears to be just a pretty plant.\n\nPlus, Neoplants can\u2019t come to your home and prove the VOC cleaning\ncapabilities. Most consumer-grade air-quality test systems, they told me,\ncannot measure the tiny molecule-sized particulate levels of VOCs (consumer\nair purifiers that rely on filters may also fail at this task) and there's no\ntest kit included with the product because it\u2019s not possible to measure\nwithout expensive equipment.\n\nStill, the company can show you the receipts for all its testing and results.\nIts staff worked with a public university in France to test this system\nindependently, and built a 160sq ft test facility with what they called\n\"amplifiers\" to test the effectiveness of their plants and bacteria. Even now,\nthe company continues testing its products with third parties to prove its\neffectiveness.\n\nPerhaps the costs will be balanced out by the peace of mind that comes with\npotentially lower VOC levels in the home.\n\nNeoPx comes with six Power Drop packets (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)\n\nAccording to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), VOC levels in the\nhome are two to five times higher indoors than outdoors \u2013 and if you\u2019re doing\nsomething like stripping paint, the numbers skyrocket.\n\nVOCs are invisible but, the EPA notes, their effects are not, and they range\nfrom causing nausea and skin irritation to cancer in humans and animals.\n\nNeoplants' long-term vision goes far beyond VOC-hoovering house plants \u2013 the\ncompany is looking at developing products that could impact air quality\noutside the home, and maybe even someday help tackle climate change.\n\nIn the meantime, though, they\u2019re just thinking about the Neo Px launch \u2013 and\nif they can satisfy some early adopters' desire for planter colors other than\nbeige.\n\n### You might also like\n\n  * My new year's resolution is to have cleaner air\n  * Levoit 600S air purifier review\n  * Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09: a powerful all-in-one ...\n\nLance Ulanoff\n\nEditor At Large\n\nA 38-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist, Lance has covered\ntechnology since PCs were the size of suitcases and \u201con line\u201d meant \u201cwaiting.\u201d\nHe\u2019s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief, and, before\nthat, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of Content for\nZiff Davis, Inc.
