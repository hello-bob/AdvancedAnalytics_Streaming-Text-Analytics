Pascual\n\nApr 30, 2024 - 17:32 GMT+2\n\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, issued a warning\nin January at the World Economic Forum in Davos: the artificial intelligence\n(AI) industry is about to cause an energy crisis. The new generation of\ngenerative AI will consume much more energy than expected, he told the world\u2019s\nleaders and entrepreneurs, to the point of straining global energy grids.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to get there without a breakthrough,\u201d he said curtly.\n\nThe breakthrough he was alluding to is the so-called advanced nuclear energy,\na term that includes small reactors and nuclear fusion, both still in the\nexperimental phase. Several companies are focusing on this alternative, which\nwould provide them with energy autonomy and greater cost control. The Biden\nAdministration does not frown on it, either. In March, Energy Secretary\nJennifer Granholm met with representatives of several technology companies,\nincluding Amazon, Google and Microsoft, to explore imaginative ways to cover\ntheir energy needs. One of the topics discussed was the possibility of using\nsmall nuclear reactors in data centers, the extensive warehouses full of\nprocessors running day and night.\n\nAccording to the latest estimates, 8% of the world\u2019s energy is already being\nused for AI; this energy powers the processors on which the models are trained\nand the systems are hosted. That figure, as Altman recently predicted, will\nsoon fall short, as new users are added and new versions of ChatGPT, Gemini\nand Copilot emerge, which will require more and more computing power. \u201cI\u2019m\nglad he said that in Davos. \u201cI\u2019m glad he said it. I\u2019ve seen consistent\ndownplaying and denial about the AI industry\u2019s environmental costs since I\nstarted publishing about them in 2018,\u201d wrote Kate Crawford, one of the\nleading researchers on the AI footprint, in Nature.\n\nBig tech has already taken the first steps towards the nuclear age, a\ndeclining energy source in the West (where plant closures outpace openings)\nwith some major exceptions: the United States, France, the United Kingdom and\nseveral Eastern European countries. Companies, for their part, see nuclear\npower as a way to ensure a stable and lasting supply of energy in a context in\nwhich the existing supply is not enough. Senior Google executives told The\nWall Street Journal that they are considering signing a power purchase\nagreement (PPA) with developers of small modular reactors (SMRs). \u201cI do think\nnuclear, especially advanced nuclear, is making a lot of progress,\u201d said Maud\nTexier, Google\u2019s global director of clean energy and decarbonization\ndevelopment, in statements to The Wall Street Journal. Texier compared the\ncost of nuclear projects to where wind and solar were 15 years ago. \u201cCost\ndecline is going to be a function of deployment,\u201d she said. Company sources\ndid not confirm to EL PA\u00cdS whether the nuclear route is an option for the\nfuture, although they did not deny it either. Google recently signed an\nagreement with Microsoft and Nucor to accelerate advanced clean energy\ntechnologies, including \u201cadvanced nuclear.\u201d\n\nIn October 2023, Microsoft closed PPAs with the American company Helion Energy\nto have the latter supply it with energy obtained from nuclear fusion starting\nin 2028. This technique is still more theoretical than practical and, unlike\nfission, does not produce radioactive waste. Asked by this newspaper about its\nstrategy in the nuclear field, Microsoft alluded to a policy brief from\nDecember titled Accelerating a carbon-free future, which makes it clear that\nadvanced nuclear and fusion energy, as well as traditional reactors, are one\nof the pillars on which Microsoft\u2019s green policy will pivot, although there is\nno talk of deadlines or dates.\n\nImage of the interior of the US Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a\nfacility where nuclear fusion has been achieved.HANDOUT (AFP)\n\nAWS, Amazon\u2019s cloud computing division, has recently purchased a large data\ncenter in the United States located next to the country\u2019s sixth largest\nnuclear power plant, which supplies it with 100% of its energy at a fixed\nprice. \u201cTo complement our wind and solar projects, which depend on weather\nconditions to generate energy, we are also exploring innovations and\ntechnologies and investing in other sources of clean, carbon-free energy. The\nagreement with Talen Energy [the company that owns the aforementioned US\nnuclear power plant] for carbon-free energy is a project that goes in that\ndirection,\u201d company sources told EL PA\u00cdS.\n\n### Silicon Valley's nuclear flirtation\n\nThe idea that nuclear energy is AI\u2019s salvation is catching on among the\nSilicon Valley jet set. Sam Altman is one of its great supporters. He is so\nconvinced about the good prospects of the proposal from Helion Energy, a\npioneer of nuclear fusion, that he has invested $375 million in the company.\nAltman also chairs a startup, Oklo, that aims to design and manufacture\nnuclear fission reactors like those used today, but much smaller (the so-\ncalled SMRs, short for small modular reactors).\n\nBill Gates is another technology tycoons with interests in SMRs. His company\nTerraPower is working on a sodium nuclear reactor, an experimental variant\nthat, if successful, promises to be 25 times cheaper than nuclear fission.\n\nMeta\u2019s chief generative AI engineer, Sergey Edunov, said a few months ago that\nonly two large nuclear reactors would be needed to cover the entire global\nenergy demand projected for 2024 in terms of AI, including powering already\noperational models and training new ones.\n\nDoes the nuclear route have a future? \u201cThere are no advances on the horizon\nthat would allow for the immediate deployment of SMRs, which are currently in\nthe initial prototyping phase in numerous countries. This option would only be\nviable if we are talking about a period of decades,\u201d says engineer Heidy\nKhlaaf, a specialist in evaluation, specification and verification of complex\ncomputer applications in safety-critical systems. Some countries, such as the\nUnited Kingdom, France, Canada and the United States, have plans to develop\nthis type of facilities, but not before 20 years.\n\nKhlaaf is especially concerned that Microsoft has put generative AI to work on\nstreamlining the bureaucracy to achieve nuclear licenses, a process that can\ntake years and cost millions of dollars. \u201cThis is not a box-ticking exercise,\nbut a process of self-assurance. Considering these regulatory processes as\nmere cumbersome paperwork says a lot about your understanding, or lack\nthereof, of nuclear safety,\u201d he says.\n\nIs it realistic to trust the future of AI to nuclear fusion? Helion Energy\u2019s\nmost optimistic estimates say that in 2029 it will be able to produce enough\nenergy to supply 40,000 average homes in the United States. It is estimated\nthat ChatGPT already consumes the equivalent of 33,000 homes today.\n\n### Why so much energy consumption?\n\nThe emergence of AI has shaken the global energy scene. Most of the\nconsumption associated with generative AI models occurs before they are used,\nduring the training phase. This is a key process in the development of deep\nlearning models that consists of showing the algorithm millions of examples\nthat help it establish patterns with which to predict situations. In the case\nof large language models, such as ChatGPT, the system is expected to conclude\nthat the series of words \u201cthe color of the sea is\u201d has a high probability of\nbeing followed by the word \u201cblue.\u201d\n\nMost data centers use advanced processors called GPUs to train AI models. GPUs\nrequire a lot of energy to operate, about five times more than CPUs\n(conventional processors). Training large language models requires tens of\nthousands of GPUs, which need to operate day and night for weeks or months.\n\n\u201cLarge language models have a very large architecture. A machine learning\nalgorithm that helps you choose who to hire might need 50 variables: where the\ncandidate works, what salary they have now, previous experience and so on. The\nfirst version of GhatGPT has more than 175 billion parameters,\u201d explains Ana\nValdivia, a lecturer in Artificial Intelligence, Government & Policy at the\nOxford Internet Institute.\n\nOnce the model has been trained, it is necessary to host and exploit the data\non which it works. This is also done in data centers, which have to operate\nday and night.\n\nWhat is the total consumption of AI? How much energy is dedicated to training\nand feeding the most commonly used models? Companies don\u2019t publish that\ninformation, so all we have are estimates. For example, Google\u2019s Gemini Ultra\nmodel, one of the most advanced today, required 50 billion petaFLOPs to train\nit, according to a recent report from Stanford University. To achieve that\nkind of computing power with commercial computers (although supercomputers are\nused in these tasks) would require about 10,000,000,000,000,000 (10 to the\npower of 16) computers. The cost associated with this training was $191\nmillion, largely attributable to the energy it consumed.\n\nA single AI model can consume tens of thousands of kilowatt-hours. Generative\nAI models, such as ChatGPT, can have 100 times greater consumption, according\nto estimates by the technology consulting firm IDC.\n\nApart from powering the systems themselves, energy also goes to the cooling\nsystems of the processors. The most common techniques include electric\nventilation and the use of water to cool the environment and the machines.\nThis latter system is beginning to cause problems in places with water\nscarcity, although the most modern techniques involve the use of closed\ncircuits that minimize losses of water resources.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Oppenheimer: Why was the father of the atomic bomb accused of working with\nthe Soviets?\n\nAlonso Mart\u00ednez\n\n### The Doomsday Clock places humanity 90 seconds away from the apocalypse\n\nIker Seisdedos | Washington\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * ChatGPT\n  * OpenAI\n  * Sam Altman\n  * Nature\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nGeVestor\n\nDieser Mann wei\u00df bescheid: Megatrend Smart-FarmingGeVestor|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nEnpal\n\nSo kosten W\u00e4rmepumpen in 2024 fast nichtsEnpal|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nCrossout\n\nCrossout 2.0: SuperchargedCrossout|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nAnd Also...\n\n\u2018Who does she think she is?\u2019: Why the public has turned against Jennifer\nLopezEl Pa\u00eds\n\nAS\n\nDonald Trump could land himself behind bars and it\u2019s not for the reason you\nthinkAS\n\nAS\n\nViral Video: Alec Baldwin punches camera out of woman\u2019s handAS\n\n_\n\n### newsletter\n\nSign up to EL PA\u00cdS in English Edition bulletin\n\nAp\u00fantate\n\n### Most viewed\n\n  1.
