Credit: Ourspace\n\nHELSINKI \u2014 China rolled out the rocket to launch its Chang\u2019e-6 mission early\nSaturday, with the aim of collecting the first lunar far side samples.\n\nThe eighth Long March 5 rocket was vertically transferred to the pad at\nWenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan island April 27.\n\nThe Chang\u2019e-6 mission aims to land on the far side of the moon\u2014a region never\ndirectly visible from Earth\u2014collect up to 2,000 grams of lunar material, and\nreturn it to Earth. Such a mission has never before been attempted.\n\nA relay satellite, named Queqiao-2, was launched in March. It is now in a\nspecialized lunar orbit to facilitate communications between the Chang\u2019e-6 on\nthe lunar far side and ground stations on Earth.\n\nChinese authorities have yet to disclose a launch time for Chang\u2019e-6. However,\nnavigation warnings indicate launch is expected early Friday, May 3.\n\nA map of the lunar far side, indicating the Chang\u2019e-6 landing zone within\nApollo crater. Credit: CNSA\n\nChang\u2019e-6 is targeting the southern portion of Apollo crater, located at\n150\u2013158 degrees west, 41\u201345 degrees south on the lunar far side. Apollo lies\nwithin the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, a gigantic, ancient impact basin,\nwhich is thought to hold tantalizing clues as to a number of moon mysteries.\n\nThe mission builds\u2014technically, engineering-wise and scientifically\u2014upon\nChina\u2019s Chang\u2019e-4 lander and rover mission to the lunar far side, supported by\nthe first Queqiao satellite, and the 2020 Chang\u2019e-5 nearside sample return.\n\n\u201cChang\u2019e-6 aims to achieve breakthroughs in the design and control technology\nof the Moon\u2019s retrograde orbit, intelligent sampling, take-off and ascent\ntechnologies, and automatic sample-return on the far side of the moon,\u201d Ge\nPing, deputy director of the Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center\n(LESEC), under the China National Space Administration (CNSA), told CCTV,\nApril 27.\n\n\u201cAt present, the Long March 5 rocket and Chang\u2019e-6 probe are in good\ncondition. All preparations for the launch are progressing in an orderly\nmanner, following normal working procedures.\u201d\n\nThe Long March 5 is a 5-meter-diameter, 57-meter-tall rocket powered by liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen. It also uses four kerosene-liquid oxygen side\nboosters. The rocket is China\u2019s largest, most powerful operational launch\nvehicle. It has launched major missions including Chang\u2019e-5 and the Tianwen-1\nMars mission. Unlike its Long March 5B variant, the core stage will not reach\norbital velocity and not make an uncontrolled reentry.\n\n## Chang\u2019e-6 spacecraft\n\nThe Chang\u2019e-6 mission will use a stack of four spacecraft totaling around\n8,200 kilograms to achieve its goals.\n\nA service module will deliver the propulsion needed to enter lunar orbit. The\nlander will set down on the far side of the moon and collect samples. These\nwill be launched into lunar orbit by an ascent vehicle, which will rendezvous\nand dock with the service module. The service module will then head back\ntowards Earth. It will then release a reentry capsule tasked with delivering\nthe samples safely through a high-speed reentry through Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nChang\u2019e-6 has the added complexity of requiring a communications relay. It is\nalso expected to last 53 days from launch till landing, according to China\u2019s\nDeep Space Exploration Laboratory (DSEL). Chang\u2019e-5 was a 23-day mission.\n\nIf successful, the samples collected from insights into the moon\u2019s history and\nthe solar system. They could also help explain why there is a difference in\ncomposition of nearside versus far side lunar rock.\n\nThe mission will also include international scientific payloads from France,\nSweden, Italy, and a Pakistani cubesat. The collaborations reflect Chinese\nefforts to boost its international cooperation in space exploration.\n\nFrance is providing the Detection of Outgassing RadoN (DORN) instrument which\nwill detect radon outgassing from the lunar crust. Sweden, with ESA support,\nwill contribute the \u201cNegative Ions at the Lunar Surface\u201d (NILS) payload. An\nItalian passive laser retro-reflector will also be aboard. The 7-kg ICUBE-Q\ncubesat is a collaboration between Pakistan\u2019s national space agency, SUPARCO,\nand China\u2019s Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\n\nChang\u2019e-6 is part of China\u2019s broader goals, which include a crewed lunar\nmission by 2030. China aims to establish a permanent lunar base through the\nInternational Lunar Research Station (ILRS) program in the 2030s. A number of\ncountries and organizations have signed up to the project.\n\n### Related\n\n#### China rolls out rocket for Queqiao-2 lunar satellite launch\n\nChina is set to launch its Queqiao-2 communications relay satellite to support\nupcoming moon missions late March 19.\n\n#### China\u2019s Queqiao-2 relay satellite ready to support lunar far side sample\nmission\n\nThe Queqiao-2 satellite has completed function and performance tests in lunar\norbit, clearing China to launch its upcoming lunar far side sample return\nmission.\n\n#### China to launch Queqiao-2 moon relay satellite in early 2024\n\nChina is preparing to place a new communications satellite in lunar orbit to\nfacilitate ambitious upcoming moon landing missions.\n\nTagged: Asia, Chang'e 6, China, Long March 5, Moon\n\n## Andrew Jones\n\nAndrew Jones covers China's space industry for SpaceNews.

Let Universal API help you on the fly!\n\nThis is a non-serious library that can implement any functions on the fly\nusing LLMs. Generated functions are cached so you don't pay for things that\nare already implemented.\n\n## Usage\n\n    \n    \n    api = UniversalAPI() print(api.sort([3, 2, 1])) # returns [1, 2, 3] print(api.sort([4, 3, 2, 1])) # returns [1, 2, 3, 4] using cached implementation print(api.sort([1, 2, 3], reverse=True)) # returns [3, 2, 1] print(api.add(1, 2)) # returns 3 print(api.reverse('hello')) # returns 'olleh' api.fizzbuzz(15) # prints the fizzbuzz sequence up to 15 api.print_picachu() # prints an ASCII art of Picachu\n\n## Warning\n\nThis library will execute unverified code in your local machine. It's NOT safe\nto run in production (or really, any serious environment).\n\n## Notes\n\nBy default this library uses OpenAI GPT API. You can modify environment\nvariables like OPENAI_BASE_URL to use other LLM endpoints (e.g. Anyscale\nEndpoint), which allows you to run on other models like the LLaMa series.

Source: Getty.\n\nApril 29, 2024, 7 AM ET\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up\nfor it here.\n\nIn all the years I\u2019ve spent covering American consumerism, I\u2019ve heard one type\nof question from readers far more than any other: This can\u2019t go on forever,\nright?\n\nMaybe they\u2019d learned what happens to the huge volume of online purchases that\nget returned, or saw one too many questionably sourced mascaras and sunscreens\nhawked on TikTok Shop, or realized that the newly minted e-commerce behemoth\nTemu is spending many millions of dollars to urge you, quite explicitly, to\nshop like a billionaire. Whatever the impetus, the people asking this question\ntend to regard the consumer landscape with a mix of exhaustion and\nincredulity. The ever-expanding American closet is already swollen with cheap\nclothes, and our junk drawers and spare rooms and storage units already\noverfloweth with everything else. Americans have so much excess stuff that\nmuch of it can\u2019t even effectively be given away. Can we\u2014the people who have\nbought so much already\u2014really keep buying more, and at a hastening clip?\n\nAs pickled as I am in information and theories about consumption, I\u2019ve never\nreally known how to answer this. I can\u2019t blame anyone for being tired\u2014of the\nadvertising and affiliate links that have eaten search results, of constant\nprompts to purchase random things, of clothes made of plastic that fall apart\nafter a few washes. Consumer choice is the animating logic of so much of\nAmerican life, and buying things is how we are taught to assert our agency or\nexpress our political views or embrace our identities. Amazon has been on a\ndecades-long push toward a logical extreme of American consumption capacity.\nThe company\u2019s newest crop of even cheaper, China-linked competitors\u2014Temu,\nShein, and TikTok Shop, most prominently\u2014seem intent on pushing further.\n\nRead: Temu is speedrunning American familiarity\n\nThe endgame to all of this, one might reasonably expect, has to be drawing\nnearer, if only because the United States is already so full-to-bursting with\nunwanted junk that entire industries and media genres have cropped up to help\npeople pare down their possessions. Surely, one might reasonably expect,\nsomething\u2019s got to give. There must be some sort of ceiling, some point of\nexhaustion\u2014if not emotional, then financial. This can\u2019t go on forever ...\nright?\n\nBy the numbers, Americans still seem plenty enthusiastic about high volume and\nlow prices. As the ultra-cheap internet retailers have sprung up, shoppers\nhave rushed by the tens of millions to patronize them. The biggest ones are\nalready pulling in billions of dollars of sales from the U.S. each year. And\neven though these retailers primarily draw in shoppers through super-low\nprices, they\u2019re very popular with people who already have plenty. According to\na recent report from Earnest Analytics, a credit-card-data firm, almost half\nof Temu\u2019s American sales come from people making more than $130,000 a year,\nand the retailer\u2019s popularity is growing the quickest with that same group of\nhigh earners. Wealthier people have more buying power in the first place, but\nthat\u2019s exactly the point: If even they haven\u2019t yet gotten their fix of cheap\nstuff, we might be nowhere close to the extremes we\u2019re ultimately capable of.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n  * ### When Gut Bacteria Change Brain Function\n\nDavid Kohn\n\n  * ### Find More Ways to Be an Outsider\n\nArthur C. Brooks\n\n  * ### A Forgotten Black Founding Father\n\nDanielle Allen\n\n\u201cIt may seem like the air is getting thin, but we have not reached \u2018peak\nstuff,\u2019\u201d David Garfield, the global head of industries for the consulting firm\nAlixPartners, told me in an email. According to Garfield, the underlying\nphenomena all point to continued growth, especially for inexpensive products:\nDemand is strong; impulsive purchases have never been easier; and the rise of\ninfluencers has made sales pitches even more omnipresent and sometimes more\ndifficult to discern from genuine recommendations. On the supply side, a\ngrowing number of third parties that Garfield calls \u201cinfrastructure\nplayers\u201d\u2014transport and logistics companies, easy-setup e-commerce platforms,\ncontract manufacturers\u2014have entered the market in order to move larger volumes\nof goods into consumers\u2019 hands more and more efficiently.\n\nGarfield also pointed to one of the less discussed ways that pandemic changes\nhave continued to affect how Americans spend their money: Before 2020, he\nsaid, consumers were in a slow, steady, long-term pattern of moving their\nspending incrementally away from goods and toward services\u2014things such as\nhotel stays and Uber rides. Pandemic shutdowns reversed that trend virtually\novernight, and four years later, a greater proportion of consumer spending is\nstill going to goods than it was in 2019. Population-level spending habits\nmove with all the agility and grace of a container ship; without a pandemic-\nlevel force to send them swiftly back where they came from, people just seem\nto be used to buying a little bit more stuff than they used to, especially\nonline.\n\nMuch of that stuff, when bought from American retailers, is now significantly\nmore expensive than it was in the recent past. Since 2019, prices for many\ntypes of consumer purchases in the U.S. have shot up. On average, goods cost\nnearly 20 percent more than they did before the pandemic. This, according to\nthe e-commerce analyst and Marketplace Pulse founder Juozas Kaziuk\u0117nas, is\namong the reasons that ultra-cheap retailers that ship to the U.S. from\noverseas have found such enthusiastic audiences. \u201cDuring uncertain economic\ntimes,\u201d he told me, \u201cprice tends to bubble up to become the most important\nvariable\u201d in how even greater numbers of people make purchase decisions.\n\nRead: It\u2019s too easy to buy stuff you don\u2019t want\n\nConfounding all of this is the reality that price and quality are not as\nclosely tied to each other as they once were. Kaziuk\u0117nas challenged a common\nassumption that the novelty of stores like Temu and Shein will have to wear\noff eventually: Not everything they sell is as off-putting or low quality in\nperson as you might think. Much of it, according to Kaziuk\u0117nas, is identical\nto what American brands and retailers sell\u2014it is, after all, coming from\nexisting manufacturers\u2014but at a much lower price. Temu and Shein were designed\nto drive overhead down to a minimum: They\u2019ve bet that lots of people are\nwilling to trade instant shipping and robust customer service for lower\nprices, and they\u2019ve largely been right. American retailers\u2019 emphasis on speed\nand variety requires more overhead because they\u2019ve built systems with more\nsteps between manufacturers and buyers. \u201cAmazon and eBay would happily\nreplicate Temu\u2019s ship-from-China model if they hadn\u2019t spent decades optimizing\nfor a different kind of experience,\u201d Kaziuk\u0117nas said.\n\nWhen you look at the data, lots of people who say they hate this phenomenon of\ncheap, high-volume consumption tend to be enthusiastic participants in it.\nKaziuk\u0117nas pointed to a recent report published by The New Consumer and the\nventure-capital firm Coefficient Capital that found that Shein shoppers are\nconsiderably more likely to express concern about the environment and\nsustainability than shoppers overall. \u201cThere is a disconnect between what we\ntell ourselves, what we tell others, and how we behave,\u201d Kaziuk\u0117nas said. Dan\nFrommer, the founder of The New Consumer, echoed those sentiments: \u201cThe allure\nof cheap stuff is universal, almost, to American culture,\u201d he told me. Some\npeople may get burned by junky products and turn away from these types of\nretailers, which may raise prices on some of their products as they dial back\ndiscounting that was implemented in order to lure an initial customer base,\nFrommer said. But he thinks they\u2019ll stick around in some significant capacity\nfor the foreseeable future, even if their recent meteoric growth cools.\n\nIf Shein, TikTok Shop, and Temu are popular even among the economically\ncomfortable and environmentally conscious, the question of what it would take\nto turn a meaningful number of Americans away from these kinds of retailers\ngets significantly more difficult to tease out. Frommer mentioned that the\nsame concerns over foreign ownership that currently threaten to bring down\nTikTok could possibly be applied to many ultra-cheap internet retailers, if\nlawmakers were so inclined. Kaziuk\u0117nas said that he didn\u2019t think consumers\nwere likely to make this choice themselves anytime soon, but that regulatory\nmeasures designed to make foreign retailers\u2019 existing business models less\nviable could harm their ability to compete against American retailers on\nprice. One such measure\u2014closing the de minimis loophole, which, in effect,\nallows foreign retailers to import goods into the U.S. one purchase at a time\nwithout paying taxes or duties\u2014is currently being considered by Congress.\n\nKen Pucker, a professor at Tufts University and the former chief operating\nofficer of Timberland, agrees that regulation is likely the most efficient way\nto reform particularly wasteful consumption and production practices, but he\nsees the looming possibility of a second path. One of the major things that\nenables American buying habits, he told me, is the separation of consumption\nfrom production. Goods are produced far away, and when we tire of them, the\ntrash they create is also swiftly moved out of our field of vision. Rarely do\nAmericans\u2014and especially the well-off Americans who drive this sort of\nconsumption\u2014experience the downsides of plastics production or discarded cheap\ngoods, such as groundwater contamination. \u201cWe no longer see the effect of the\nconsumption that we still enjoy,\u201d he told me. We just experience the upsides\nof convenience and abundance.\n\nEventually, this separation will be more difficult to uphold. As the physical\neffects of climate change become more difficult to outrun even for the\nrelatively affluent, Pucker said, the joys of consumption and realities of\nproduction are bound to recouple. You can see it beginning to happen already:\nA recent report found that PFAS \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d which are used widely in\nthe manufacture of stain- and water-resistant products and linked to a host of\nmedical issues, are present in high concentrations in sea spray the world\nover.\n\nMaybe, one day, buying cheap stuff as a form of entertainment will run afoul\nof new behavioral norms that a changed physical reality creates. People might\nbegin to feel ashamed, or at least more self-conscious, about buying things\nthey don\u2019t even really want as a salve for stress or boredom. But if we have\nto wait for wastefulness to become uncool, then we probably have our answer as\nto whether this will all slow down anytime soon.\n\nAmanda Mull is a former staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": true}

Sources: Shutterstock; Getty.\n\nApril 29, 2024, 2:25 PM ET\n\nEven by the standards of Congress, the past few weeks have been a lesson in\nhypocrisy. Last Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed legislation that will\nrequire TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app or face a ban in\nthe United States\u2014all over concerns that the Communist Party of China uses the\napp for surveillance. Yet just a few days earlier, Biden had renewed a law\nsynonymous with American surveillance: Section 702.\n\nYou may never have heard of Section 702, but the sweeping, George W. Bush\u2013era\nmandate gives intelligence agencies the authority to track online\ncommunication, such as text messages, emails, and Facebook posts. Legally,\nAmericans aren\u2019t supposed to be surveilled through this law. But from 2020 to\n2021, the FBI misused Section 702 data more than 278,000 times, including to\nsurveil Americans linked to the January 6 riot and Black Lives Matter\nprotests. (The FBI claims it has since reformed its policies.)\n\nThe contradiction between TikTok and Section 702 is maddening, but it points\nto lawmakers\u2019 continued failure to wrestle with the most basic questions of\nhow to protect the American public in the algorithmic age. It\u2019s quite fair to\nworry, as Congress does, that TikTok\u2019s mass collection of personal data can\npose a threat to our data. Yet Meta, X, Google, Amazon, and nearly every other\npopular platform also suck up our personal data. And while the fear around\nforeign meddling that has animated the TikTok ban has largely rested on\nhypotheticals, there is plenty of evidence demonstrating that Facebook, at\nleast, has effectively operated as a kind of \u201chostile foreign power,\u201d as The\nAtlantic\u2019s Adrienne LaFrance put it, with \u201cits single-minded focus on its own\nexpansion; its immunity to any sense of civic obligation; its record of\nfacilitating the undermining of elections; its antipathy toward the free\npress; its rulers\u2019 callousness and hubris; and its indifference to the\nendurance of American democracy.\u201d\n\nRead: The largest autocracy on Earth\n\nCongress has largely twiddled its thumbs as social-media companies have\nengaged in this kind of chicanery\u2014until TikTok. ByteDance is hardly a\ncandidate for sainthood, but who would want to beatify Elon Musk and Mark\nZuckerberg? Abroad, America\u2019s surveillance draws much of the same political\ncondemnation Congress is now levying at China. The privacy advocate Max\nSchrems repeatedly sued Facebook to stop the company from sharing Europeans\u2019\ndata with the U.S., where the information could be searched by intelligence\nagencies. He won multiple times. Last year, European Union regulators fined\nMeta $1.3 billion for transferring Facebook user data to servers in the United\nStates.\n\nCongress\u2019s tech dysfunction extends well beyond this privacy double standard.\nThe growing backlash to platforms such as Facebook and Instagram is not aimed\nat any of the substantial issues around privacy and surveillance, such as the\nubiquitous tracking of our online activity and the widespread use of facial\nrecognition. Instead, they\u2019re defined by an amorphous moral panic.\n\nTake the Kids Online Safety Act, an alarmingly popular bill in Congress that\nwould radically remake internet governance in the United States. Under KOSA,\ncompanies would have a duty to help defend minors from a broad constellation\nof harms, including mental-health impacts, substance use, and types of sexual\ncontent. The bill might actually require companies to gather even more data\nabout everything we see and say, every person with whom we have contact, every\ntime we use our devices. That\u2019s because you can\u2019t systematically defend\nagainst Congress\u2019s laundry list of digital threats without massive\nsurveillance of everything we say and every person we meet on these platforms.\nFor companies such as Signal, the encrypted-messaging app that political\ndissidents rely on around the world, this could mean being forced to operate\nmore like Facebook, WhatsApp, and the other platforms they\u2019ve always sought to\nprovide an alternative to. Or, more likely, it would mean that companies that\nprioritize privacy simply couldn\u2019t do business in the U.S. at all.\n\nPerhaps the biggest protection Americans have against measures such as KOSA is\nhow badly they\u2019re designed. They all rest on proving users\u2019 age, but the truth\nis that there\u2019s simply no way to know whether someone scrolling on their phone\nis a teen or a retiree. States such as Louisiana and Utah have experimented\nwith invasive and discriminatory technologies such as facial recognition and\nfacial-age estimation, despite evidence that the technology is far more error-\nprone when it comes to nonwhite faces, especially Black women\u2019s faces.\n\nBut these misguided bills haven\u2019t completely derailed lawmakers pushing real\nreforms to U.S. mass surveillance. Within days of the House passing the TikTok\nban and Section 702 renewal, it also passed the Fourth Amendment Is Not for\nSale Act, which closes the loophole that lets police pay companies for our\ndata without getting a warrant. Yet the bill now finds itself in limbo in the\nSenate.\n\nRegulating technology doesn\u2019t have to be this hard. Even when the products are\ncomplex, solutions can be shockingly simple, banning harmful business and\npolicing practices as they emerge. But Congress remains unwilling or unable to\ntake on the types of mass surveillance that social-media firms use to make\nbillions, or that intelligence agencies use to grow their ever-expanding pool\nof data. For now, America\u2019s real surveillance threats are coming from inside\nthe house.\n\nAlbert Fox Cahn is the founder and executive director of the Surveillance\nTechnology Oversight Project (S.T.O.P.), and a technology and human-rights\nfellow at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Carr Center.\n\n", "frontpage": false}

If you are\nmore of a visual learner, we encourage you to start by watching Abhi's talk at\nData Council 2023 called Designing and Building Metric Trees. From there,\nyou'll be ready to get into the thick of it.\n\n### Every organization is fundamentally a system of inputs and outputs.\n\nThey exist to convert capital\u2014physical, human, and intellectual\u2014into some kind\nof value, most commonly cash. This transformation process is central to how\norganizations operate and succeed. It is the fingerprint of a business.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that most successful businesses embrace this perspective\nand cultivate a common understanding of the system from the leadership down to\nthe individual levels. These businesses succeed because every member in the\norganization shares an understanding of their contributions towards achieving\na larger, overarching goal, often referred to as a \"North Star.\" This\ncollective understanding is what defines a growth model within a company.\n\nA growth model is a conceptual blueprint to help businesses understand, reason\nabout and communicate the mechanisms and strategies for driving growth. It is\nessentially a causal model that allows members to anticipate results based on\ncertain actions and, conversely, deduce actions from the results obtained. The\nmodel reduces uncertainty from strategic planning and decision-making and\nmakes operational adjustments easier to perform and track.\n\nThere are many ways to express a growth model. Most are visual, with abstract\nrepresentations of inflows and outflows. Others are concrete mathematical\nmodels that hide their complexity in spreadsheet formulas. While visual\ndiagrams are helpful in high-level communication, and spreadsheet models offer\nthe perception of finite precision, their intangibility is limiting for most\nstakeholders. This makes integrating them into day-to-day operations is hard,\nif not impossible.\n\nThe purpose of this guide is to help you translate the abstract elements of\nyour growth model into a concrete, measurable, and interactive format. Put\nsimply, we want to help you reify your growth model in the form of a metric\ntree. You'll learn how a metric tree can serve as a practical bridge,\nconnecting your overarching growth strategy to daily tasks such as causal\nanalysis, forecasting, planning, and business reviews.\n\n## Introducing Metric Trees\n\nMetric trees are surprisingly powerful despite their apparent simplicity. If\nyou\u2019ve ever tried to connect the conceptual \u201cphysics\u201d of a business to a\nconcrete action, you know it's easy to get lost on the ladder of abstraction.\n\nMetric trees bridge this gap thanks to a few useful characteristics, which are\nsummarized in their name.\n\nMetrics are abstract representations of business events, either actual or\nhypothetical. As such, they exist in the context in which the events take\nplace. Each metric embodies a \u201ccube\u201d of dimensions including time as well as\nthose related to the entities involved in an event. This means they are great\nfor presenting the \u201cfacts\u201d about a business without getting bogged down in the\nminutia of the underlying data.\n\nOn the flip side, metrics are limited by their abstraction. They only\nrepresent facts to the extent that people can understand and agree upon their\ndefinitions. If there is ambiguity or disagreement about a metric\u2019s semantics,\nits utility is compromised. This is particularly true when definitions differ\nacross teams or business units.\n\n> In essence, metrics are only as useful as the clarity of their definitions\n> and consensus about their importance.\n\nIn essence, metrics are only as useful as the clarity of their definitions and\nconsensus about their importance. This is where trees come in.\n\nA tree is the structural backbone that binds every metric to its business\nsignificance. Metric trees are constructed \u201cbackward,\u201d starting with the\nultimate output (the North Star) down to the most distant input. Each layer of\nmetrics is derived from decomposing those above it. This means there is one,\nand only one, definition for each metric, and their significance is inherited\nfrom the generations above. To put it plainly, every metric derives legitimacy\nfrom its lineage back to the North Star.\n\nAs the metrics on the tree diverge, the scope of their significance\nnarrows\u2014functions, then teams, then processes, and individuals\u2014but their\nconnection to the greater system is never lost. At the terminus of every\nbranch is the interface between analysis and action. From that point, the tree\nprovides a causal chain all the way back to each action\u2019s impact on the North\nStar.\n\n## So, what is a metric tree?\n\n> A metric tree is an analytical model that takes metrics and their weighted\n> relationships to represent the flow of inputs into a business and how they\n> are transformed into outputs.\n\nA metric tree is an analytical model that takes metrics and their weighted\nrelationships to represent the flow of inputs (physical capital, human\ncapital, intellectual capital, etc.) into a business and how they are\ntransformed into outputs (including financial, customer, and strategic value\noutputs).\n\nPut simply, a metric tree is the logical representation of a business\u2019s growth\nmodel.\n\n### What does a metric tree look like?\n\nMetric trees use diagrams to summarize how inputs contribute to outputs (and\nideally, how inputs lead to the North Star Metric).\n\nAt the top, you find outputs, and it all starts with $$$\u2019s \u2013 with revenue.\nThese outputs decompose into inputs. Inputs consist of components that are\nmathematical identities (e.g. Leads and Win Rate) and influences (Lead score).\n\nAny input that is also an influence metric has a contingent relationship, both\nwith components below and with outputs above. These relationships have\nproperties, for example, \u201cStrength\u201d or \u201cConfidence\u201d.\n\nFinally, inputs have dimensions, for example, Market Segment or Country.\n\nMetric trees can also be nested, with layers of analysis as outputs become\ninputs that feed deeper into a larger, more complex profit model.\n\n## Applications and Use Cases\n\nUsing a metric tree to describe a business as a function enables us to take\nadvantage of the inherent precision and predictability of mathematical\nanalysis to help optimize business decision-making \u2013 providing grounding for\ninformed decisions.\n\nMetric trees also mitigate the problem of information overload. Whether it\u2019s\nintra-departmental or at the leadership level, it\u2019s common that data\ninterpretation becomes somewhat haphazard and disconnected from the bottom\nline, creating a void between inputs and measuring success.\n\nIn contrast, metric trees provide a framework that allows leaders to decompose\ncomplex business functions into smaller sections that are more comprehensive.\n\nThis conceptual structure becomes a central reference point to understand and\nevaluate the relationships within a business. That said, metric trees do not\ndumb down the analysis: with them, it is as easy to describe the entire\nbusiness as a single unit or function.\n\nA balance of simplicity and comprehensiveness makes it an excellent tool for\ndecision-making at a holistic level. A few simple use cases include:\n\n\u00b7 Root cause analysis: A metric tree can help guide the analytical process to\nensure that companies can understand what really impacts any given output \u2013\nfor example, are win rates the real cause for low revenue, or is it the ASP?\n\n\u00b7 Employee and stakeholder onboarding: Metric trees represent the fingerprint\nof an organization and are a powerful way to explain to newcomers how a\ncompany\u2019s growth model works.\n\n\u00b7 Mission statement for data teams: Metric trees serve as a navigational tool\nthat helps data teams establish the required metrics while providing a path to\nfinding a company\u2019s growth levers \u2013 and how to pull these levers.\n\n\u00b7 Dashboarding: a fleshed-out metric tree can help companies build dashboards,\ngrouping metrics into related areas (e.g., revenue vs. leads, customers, win\nrate, ASP, etc).\n\n\u00b7 Faster business reviews and forecasting: With all necessary metrics,\ninfluences and levers available at a glance, companies can go through the\nbusiness review process more accurately and faster.\n\n## Steps to constructing a metric tree\n\nMetric trees are, at first glance, a rather simple concept. It\u2019s also true\nthat metric trees are easy to use. So yes, metric trees appear simple because\nit\u2019s necessary to have a tool that stakeholders can easily interpret for\naction. However, metric trees reflect underlying business processes and\nrelationships that are not simple.\n\nJust like modeling any business process, the devil is in the details. Taming\nthese details requires a regimented, step-by-step process, and the decisions\nyou make along this process dictate the utility of the metric tree \u2013 and its\nimpact.\n\nTo capture, visualize, and understand the key metrics that drive the success\nof a company or unit we suggest that you follow three essential steps:\n\n\u00b7 Defining the North Star metric: The North Star metric is the primary measure\nof success for the company or unit. This metric should align with the long-\nterm value creation for the company. This metric provides direction and focus\nfor the entire organization.\n\n\u00b7 Decomposing components: The next step involves breaking down the North Star\nmetric into its component parts, identifying the input metrics that directly\ncontribute to the calculation of the North Star Metric and other key output\nmetrics.\n\n\u00b7 Identifying influences: The final step involves identifying influence\nmetrics, the metrics that have correlative, causal, or qualitative\nrelationship with output metrics \u2013 in order to understand how changes in\ncertain metrics can influence the performance of other metrics.\n\nThe goal of constructing a metric tree is to provide a clear, actionable\nframework that guides decision-making and growth strategies by highlighting\nthe relationships between various metrics and identifying levers for\ninfluencing key outcomes.\n\n## How (and where) to design a metric tree\n\nYou can design a metric tree with any diagramming tool you find easy to use.\nIn short, tools like Miro, Figma, or even MS Paint can be used for creating\nmetric trees. The key is focusing on the outcome, not the design tool. Metric\ntrees help visualize, communicate, and align a business's value creation and\nflow, enabling quicker issue resolution, accurate forecasting, and integrated\nplanning.\n\nThe ideal metric tree setup for your organization is one that effectively\nsupports understanding and managing value flow.\n\nUltimately, the effectiveness of metric trees extends beyond visualization to\nbeing integrated into data and models. Technically, these \"trees\" are more\naccurately described as graphs.\n\nPAGE NAVIGATION\n\nIntroducing Metric TreesSo, what is a metric tree?Applications and Use\nCasesSteps to constructing a metric treeHow (and where) to design a metric\ntree\n\n#### Subscribe for updates\n\nAccess the latest articles, tools, and templates as they are published.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\n#### Related Articles\n\n#### Designing Metric Trees\n\nRead Now\n\nRead Now\n\n#### Root Cause Analysis with Metric Trees\n\nRead Now\n\nRead Now\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nLevers Visibility\n\nLevers Insights\n\nLevers Review\n\nLevers Planning\n\nResources\n\nIntro to Metric Trees\n\nRoot Cause Analysis Tutorial\n\nCompany\n\nServices\n\nAbout us\n\nContact\n\nContact Us\n\nLinkedin\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Levers Labs 2023\n\nPrivacy policyTerms and conditions\n\nProducts\n\nCOMPANY\n\nRESOURCES\n\nSOCIALS\n\nPrivacy policyTerms and conditions\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Levers Labs 2023\n\n", "frontpage": false}

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product,\ndriving growth, and accelerating your career.\n\nP.S. Check out my PM recruiting service (helping you hire Sr. PMs and VPs),\nLennybot (an AI chatbot trained on my newsletter posts, podcast interviews,\nand more), and my swag store (great gifts for your favorite PM, or yourself!).\n\nEveryone gets excited about launching new features, but in my experience, most\nof a company\u2019s growth comes from the less glamorous stuff: incremental and\nconsistent optimization of the core product. Of course, you need to add new\nfeatures and business lines over time, but there\u2019s a lot of hate for micro-\noptimization product work, and I\u2019m here to tell you that this work is\nimportant\u2014maybe the most important.\n\nEvery major tech company, including Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Airbnb,\nLinkedIn, Uber, TikTok, and\u2014as we\u2019ve seen in recent newsletter\nissues\u2014Duolingo, has long prioritized optimizing every square inch of their\nproduct. But surprisingly, I\u2019ve never seen a great framework for how to think\nabout this work. Until now.\n\nBelow, guest author Ken Rudin shares his home-grown ARIA framework. Ken\u2019s\nbackground is bonkers: He was the first SVP of Products and Engineering at\nSalesforce, led the Growth and Analytics team at Zynga, was one of the\nearliest senior execs on the legendary growth team at Facebook, and went on to\nlead growth at Google (including leading growth for Google search, ads, cloud,\nand even their behavioral science work). Most recently, at ThoughtSpot (an AI-\nenabled analytics vendor) he helped transition their growth motion from a\ntraditional sales-led B2B SaaS model to product-led growth. For more from Ken,\nmake sure to follow him on LinkedIn.\n\nAsk most product teams how they plan to drive more growth, and you\u2019ll\nfrequently hear the same answer: we need more features. More features will\nmake the product more useful, which will lead to more engagement and\nretention, which will lead to more revenue. Or so the thinking goes.\n\nBut in my experience, you can drive significantly more growth by focusing on\ngetting users to engage more with your existing key features and user flows. I\nrealized just how effective it can be to focus on improving the engagement of\nexisting key features when I joined Google in 2015 to lead their growth team.\nAt that time, the average Google Search user in the U.S. did only 12 searches\nper month (which shocked me\u2014I probably do 12 searches before getting out of\nbed every morning! \ud83e\udd13). We wanted to encourage users to search more, because\nmore searches = more opportunities to show ads = more revenue.\n\nOur analysis showed that searches whose results changed frequently (e.g.\nsports scores, weather, or movie times) were the stickiest searches\u2014users who\ndid those searches would repeat them often. But only about 15% of users were\naware of these types of searches. So rather than building new features, we\nfocused on building ways to raise awareness and engagement with the searches\nwe already had. We used several approaches (discussed in the sections below),\nwhich together nearly doubled the number of users who did these types of\nsearches\u2014and translated into millions of dollars of incremental ad revenue. \ud83d\udcb0\n\nOf course, you need new features to address changing user needs and compete in\nthe market, but most product teams significantly over-index on building new\nfeatures. Thus, my goal for this post is to provide a framework for (1)\nidentifying key features to double down on and (2) increasing engagement with\nthose features, which will drive overall product growth.\n\n###\n\nWhy increasing engagement with existing key features is more impactful than\nlaunching new features\n\nThe most important features for a product are usually the ones that were built\nfirst. Once you get past a certain level of functionality, a lot of the new\nfunctionality on the roadmap often targets just a subset of users (e.g. power\nusers) or supports use cases that are adjacent to the core use cases. So it\u2019s\na safer bet that you\u2019ll drive more business impact by increasing engagement\nwith a feature that has already been launched than one that\u2019s still on the\nroadmap because it wasn\u2019t critical enough to be prioritized.\n\nAnother reason to focus on existing features is that you probably have not\nsqueezed the most utility for users, and therefore engagement, out of them\nyet. When you first release a feature, you\u2019ll usually find that about 80% of\nthe feature\u2019s design works well but the other 20% doesn\u2019t. Some users may get\nstuck on a step that they find confusing or takes significant effort, and\ndon\u2019t complete the flow, which means they actually get 0% of the feature\u2019s\nvalue. For others, it means they use the feature less than they otherwise\nwould, and therefore get less value. By focusing on improving that last 20%,\nyou unlock the full 100% of the value for users.\n\nI\u2019ve applied the approach of focusing on increasing engagement with existing\nkey features many, many times\u2014with several Google products (including Search,\nYouTube, Google Cloud, and Google Ads), at ThoughtSpot (an analytics vendor I\nworked at, whose product allows you to analyze data using natural language and\nAI), and with several other venture-backed companies that I have the honor to\nadvise. I can confidently say that product teams frequently, or even usually,\ndrive more growth by optimizing engagement with existing key features than by\nlaunching new ones. And in an economic environment where engineering budgets\nand projects are being cut, getting more impact from work that\u2019s already been\ndone is even more critical.\n\nIf increasing engagement with existing key features frequently has more impact\nthan adding new features, the next question is: How do we increase engagement\nin a structured, repeatable way?\n\n###\n\nThe ARIA framework\n\nProduct teams have lots of frameworks leading up to launching new features,\nincluding identifying user needs, defining solutions, and prioritizing them on\na roadmap. But what about a framework for increasing the adoption of features\nafter they\u2019ve launched? It\u2019s one thing to know that you should focus on\noptimizing existing features but another to know which features to focus on,\nand what to do to make them more successful.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve looked for a framework for increasing engagement with existing\nfeatures, I\u2019ve always come up empty-handed. That\u2019s what led me to create the\nARIA framework.\n\nARIA has four key principles: Analyze, Reduce, Introduce, and Assist:\n\nThis isn\u2019t a one-and-done process, however. The intent is not to choose a\nfeature, go through the four principles once, and then move on to the next\nfeature. Instead, it\u2019s meant to be an ongoing process\u2014sort of like having an\nimplicit Repeat principle as the last step of the framework (though changing\nthe name to ARIAR just doesn\u2019t sound as good. \ud83d\ude01)\n\nARIA is certainly not a complete list of everything you can do to increase\nfeature adoption, and it would be a waste of time to create such a list\nanyway, because people are always innovating new ways to make features more\nengaging. Instead, use the framework as a cheat sheet to help guide you.\n\n###\n\nPrinciple #1: Analyze\n\nFirst, you need to figure out which features to focus on. That means you need\nto analyze your data to identify which of your features are most correlated\nwith growth, and then analyze the engagement levels of those features to\nhighlight which features aren\u2019t getting the user love they deserve.\n\n####\n\n1.1 Identify key features correlated with growth\n\nAs product people, our features are our creations. We\u2019re proud of all of them,\nand we\u2019d like to see them all thrive. (OK, I admit that I have a few that I\u2019d\nlike to forget about. \ud83d\ude2c) But given that you always have limited resources, you\nneed to identify your \u201ckey features\u201d\u2014that is, those features that have the\nhighest correlation with acquisition, monetization, retention, or expansion.\nIncreasing adoption of those features will have the biggest impact on growing\nyour business. (You might be thinking, \u201cBut correlation doesn\u2019t imply\ncausation!\u201d That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s still the best way to identify features with\nthe highest likelihood of driving growth.)\n\nA correlation analysis will tell you how strongly the use of a feature is\nrelated to the movement of your various growth metrics. There are many\npopular, easy-to-use tools (including some free ones) for quickly doing a\ncorrelation analysis, or you can even do it pretty easily in a spreadsheet.\nFor a great primer on how to do correlation analysis, see this post in Lenny\u2019s\nNewsletter by Olga Berezovsky: \u201cHow to do linear regression and correlation\nanalysis.\u201d\n\nExamples of key features:\n\n####\n\n1.2 Calculate usage metrics for key features\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified your set of key features, the next step is to gather\ndata about their existing level of user adoption and engagement. For example,\nwhat percentage of YouTube users have subscribed to a channel, or what\npercentage of Loom users use the Auto Message Composer?\n\nWhen analyzing usage, it\u2019s helpful to look at the different stages of feature\nadoption:\n\nIf using the feature requires multiple steps (which is true for most\nfeatures), then you also want to measure completion rates. For example, of the\nGmail users who start the process of adding another email account (like a\nMicrosoft Outlook account) to their current Gmail account, what percentage\ncomplete that process?\n\nOne final important metric to measure is success rate. This doesn\u2019t apply to\nevery feature, but many features have a concept of a successful outcome for\nthe user. For instance, what percentage of resumes submitted for a job opening\non Indeed receive a call back from the employer? Or what percentage of\napartment searches on Apartments.com return at least one result that meets the\nuser\u2019s search criteria?\n\nWhen I was an advisor to Roblox in their early days, many of our growth wins\ncame from focusing on success rates. For example, our analysis showed that\nmaking frequent changes to your avatar was strongly correlated with user\nretention, particularly for new users. But we saw that about 20% of visits to\nthe Avatar Shop were \u201cunsuccessful\u201d\u2014users would leave the shop without\nchanging their avatar. By adding the ability to sort clothing and accessories\nto show newest or best-selling items first, and adding simple search\ncapabilities, we were able to increase the success rate of these Avatar Shop\nvisits significantly, increasing the frequency of avatar changes, and\nultimately increasing new-user retention by a couple percent. \ud83c\udfaf\n\nFinal tip: When analyzing these metrics, segment your users by how long\nthey\u2019ve been using your product (such as 0-30 days, 31-90 days, and 91+ days).\nThis helps you see which features are adopted early in a user\u2019s journey and\nwhich take more time.\n\n####\n\n1.3 Focus on features that drive growth and have low usage metrics\n\nThe final step in Analysis is simple: identify key features (i.e. features\ncorrelated with growth) that have low adoption, completion, or success rates.\nIf something is already successfully used by a large percentage of users, then\nthere\u2019s not much room for improvement. Once you\u2019ve identified which features\nto focus on, you then need to increase their engagement. Below, I cover the\nthree most consistently effective ways that I\u2019ve found for doing this.\n\n###\n\nPrinciple #2: Reduce\n\nThe first consistently effective way to increase engagement with a feature is\nby reducing the friction associated with using it. This includes reducing the\nnumber of steps, reducing the effort to complete each step, and reducing how\nmuch we need to learn before we can really use it (i.e. reducing the\n\u201ccognitive load\u201d).\n\n####\n\n2.1 Reduce steps in the process\n\nMost features have multiple steps. Every time you ask a user to click, tap, or\ntype, even if it all happens in one screen, that\u2019s a step. And when you start\ncounting all these steps, you\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re asking your users to do a\nlot more than you realize. You need to look at whether some of the steps can\nbe removed.\n\nExamples of reducing steps in the process:\n\n####\n\n2.2 Reduce effort per step\n\nOnce you\u2019ve minimized the steps needed to use a feature, look at the remaining\nsteps and see if you can reduce the effort required for each step, i.e. make\neach step simpler. Product teams know they need to do this, but in my\nexperience they rely on a limited number of approaches, such as optimizing the\nUI flow, mimicking how similar flows are built in other popular apps so the\nflow feels more familiar to users, and clarifying the verbiage in the app. But\nthere are many other approaches. Below are three additional methods that I\u2019ve\nfound to be very effective and should be used much more often than they\ncurrently are.\n\n##### a. Have users edit rather than create from scratch\n\nYou know how it\u2019s usually easier to start with content that\u2019s close to what\nyou want and edit it than it is to create new content from scratch? That\u2019s\ntrue for your users as well, which means that where possible, providing users\nwith a good starting point for any kind of content creation can reduce\nfriction and increase engagement. This \u201cedit vs. create\u201d idea applies to not\njust traditional text or image-based content but to anything the user needs to\ncreate or define.\n\nExamples of editing vs. creating from scratch:\n\n##### b. Use smart defaults\n\nAnother way to reduce effort is to intelligently prefill default values.\n\nExamples of using smart defaults:\n\nLenny\u2019s post highlighting smart defaults is here.\n\n##### c. Enable users to click or tap rather than type\n\nAsking the user to enter information by typing is an overlooked but very real\nsource of friction. You need to know exactly what to type (for example, if you\nwant to share a Figma file with someone, you need to know the correct email\naddress to type), and you have to deal with typos. Also, this friction is\nmagnified if the typing needs to be done on a small mobile screen. Instead,\nexplore where you can have users select something from a list with a\nclick/tap.\n\nExamples of clicking or tapping vs. typing:\n\n####\n\n2.3 Reduce cognitive load\n\nWe can\u2019t have a discussion about removing friction in your product without at\nleast mentioning reducing cognitive friction, also known as cognitive\nload\u2014that is, reducing the mental effort required to understand and use a\nfeature. To find out which of your features users struggle with, you need to\ngrab a few new users and watch them try those features for the first time.\nThese sessions are often painful to watch, but you\u2019ll learn a ton.\n\nYou\u2019ll uncover which concepts in your product are unfamiliar to your users.\nFor example, I love Notion as an all-purpose note-taking and productivity\ntool, but I know several people who tried to switch from Evernote to Notion\nand had trouble getting their head around Notion\u2019s central concepts of\n\u201cblocks\u201d and \u201cdatabases.\u201d A big part of Notion\u2019s success (and that of other\ncompanies like Figma and Airtable) is due to their heavy investment in\nbuilding templates that introduce users to core concepts by showing them in\naction, making them less conceptual and more tangible. (I discuss templates\nmore in the Assist section below.) Notion created over 150 templates for\ndifferent use cases, and users can also create and publicly share their\nown\u2014see screenshot below. If it\u2019s absolutely necessary to introduce your users\nto unfamiliar concepts, be prepared to spend a fair bit of time and resources\nfinding ways to help people easily understand them.\n\n###\n\nPrinciple #3: Introduce\n\nReducing the friction associated with features is critical, but it only solves\npart of the problem. It doesn\u2019t matter much that you\u2019ve been able to reduce\nthe number of steps required, the effort per step, or the cognitive load if no\none knows about the feature.\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll talk about how to increase users\u2019 awareness of a\nfeature and motivate them to use it. A key point here is that I\u2019m not just\ntalking about introducing newly launched features. I\u2019m referring to all your\nkey features. Many of your existing users don\u2019t know about all of them, and\nfor your new users, every feature is new to them.\n\n####\n\n3.1 Increase feature awareness, in context\n\nThe first step to introducing a feature is to simply increase users\u2019 awareness\nof the feature. We\u2019ve all seen the common UI elements used for this: pop-up\nmodals, tooltips, banners, pulsing hotspots, walk-throughs, checklists, etc.\nBut the key question we should ask isn\u2019t how we should raise awareness but\nwhen.\n\nProduct teams often rely on the new-user onboarding flow to introduce key\nfeatures, but there\u2019s a limit to how much functionality you can show a new\nuser before you overwhelm them. Or they rely on What\u2019s New pop-ups, but their\neffectiveness is questionable. (I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who reflexively\ncloses these pop-ups without reading them. Particularly when they take over my\nentire screen, blocking me from my games! \ud83c\udfae )\n\nFortunately, there\u2019s a better way. The right time to introduce a feature is to\nintroduce it in context, which means at a point when the user is most likely\nto want to use it. Compared with a user who is simply told about a feature, a\nuser who is told about a feature when they need it is much more likely to use\nthat feature and remember it.\n\nExamples of increasing feature awareness in context:\n\n## This post is for paid subscribers\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
