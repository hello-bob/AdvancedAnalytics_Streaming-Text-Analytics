Here, we report that G-quadruplex DNA (G4-DNA) accumulates\nin neurons, in an experience-dependent manner, and that this is required for\nthe transient silencing and activation of genes that are critically involved\nin learning and memory in male C57/BL6 mice. In addition, site-specific\nresolution of G4-DNA by dCas9-mediated deposition of the helicase DHX36\nimpairs fear extinction memory. Dynamic DNA structure states therefore\nrepresent a key molecular mechanism underlying memory consolidation.\n\nOne-Sentence Summary: G4-DNA is a molecular switch that enables the temporal\nregulation of the gene expression underlying the formation of fear extinction\nmemory.\n\n  * DNA\n  * gene expression\n  * memory\n\nSfN exclusive license.\n\nView Full Text\n\n### Member Log In\n\n### Log in using your username and password\n\n### Purchase access\n\nYou may purchase access to this article.
