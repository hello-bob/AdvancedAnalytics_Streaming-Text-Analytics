Earlier this\nweek, the European Commission said that iPadOS is also a gatekeeper platform\nunder the Digital Markets Act.\n\nEU developers will be able to distribute iPad apps outside of the App Store\nusing alternative app marketplaces or websites, and all of the same terms will\napply. The Core Technology Fee will be charged for apps that are distributed\noutside of the App Store and have more than one million first annual installs,\nthough there are exceptions for small developers, which Apple also announced\ntoday.\n\nWith iPadOS being added to the mix, Apple has also confirmed that users who\ninstall the same app on both iOS and iPadOS in a 12-month period will only\ngenerate one first annual install for that app rather than two, which should\nhelp developers keep below the CTF threshold.\n\nAs with the changes to iOS, the upcoming changes to iPadOS only apply to\ndevelopers who distribute apps in the European Union and iPad users in the EU.\nFor the rest of the world, there are no changes and apps will continue to be\navailable only from the App Store.\n\nTags: App Store, European Union\n\n[ 24 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nTimFL1\n\n1 hour ago at 08:05 am\n\nThis is further evidence that Apple knows what they\u2018re doing, giving in this\nfast cause they know they\u2018re just buying time stalling DMA rollouts across\nplatforms etc. to get their old business model going \"just a little further\".\n\nMost of the other artificial roadblockers they have going will fall like\ndomino blocks (little to no resistance from Applw) with the EU starting their\nnitpicking period.\n\nScore: 6 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nvtrautia\n\n1 hour ago at 08:27 am\n\nMassive thank you to EU. iPad users should able to download apps where ever\nthey see fit.
