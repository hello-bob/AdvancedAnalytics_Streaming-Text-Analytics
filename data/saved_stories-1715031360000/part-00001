The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house).

This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes.

For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 / 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

The\nglyphset includes a mirrored version of each non-symmetric glyph, but the\nmapping is rather arbitrary, so we are going to need a map.\n\nHere are the pairs:\n\nBy Ev Hs Kp Nm Ri Ve Za \u017b\u017a Az Cx Fu Ir Lo Ol Sh Wd \u0179\u017c vE Dw Gt Jq Mn Pk Qj Tg\nUf Xc \u1e8a\u1e05 Yb \u017d\u017e bY cX () [] {}\n\n### Animal mirror Link to heading\n\nST\u00bbK*abd\n\n    \n    \n    const mirrorPairs = {\"B\": \"y\", \"y\": \"B\", \"E\": \"v\", \"v\": \"E\", \"H\": \"s\", \"s\": \"H\", \"K\": \"p\", \"p\": \"K\", \"N\": \"m\", \"m\": \"N\", \"R\": \"i\", \"i\": \"R\", \"V\": \"e\", \"e\": \"V\", \"Z\": \"a\", \"a\": \"Z\", \"\u017b\": \"\u017a\", \"\u017a\": \"\u017b\", \"A\": \"z\", \"z\": \"A\", \"C\": \"x\", \"x\": \"C\", \"F\": \"u\", \"u\": \"F\", \"I\": \"r\", \"r\": \"I\", \"L\": \"o\", \"o\": \"L\", \"O\": \"l\", \"l\": \"O\", \"S\": \"h\", \"h\": \"S\", \"W\": \"d\", \"d\": \"W\", \"\u0179\": \"\u017c\", \"\u017c\": \"\u0179\", \"v\": \"E\", \"E\": \"v\", \"D\": \"w\", \"w\": \"D\", \"G\": \"t\", \"t\": \"G\", \"J\": \"q\", \"q\": \"J\", \"M\": \"n\", \"n\": \"M\", \"P\": \"k\", \"k\": \"P\", \"Q\": \"j\", \"j\": \"Q\", \"T\": \"g\", \"g\": \"T\", \"U\": \"f\", \"f\": \"U\", \"X\": \"c\", \"c\": \"X\", \"\u1e8a\": \"\u1e05\", \"\u1e05\": \"\u1e8a\", \"Y\": \"b\", \"b\": \"Y\", \"\u017d\": \"\u017e\", \"\u017e\": \"\u017d\", \"b\": \"Y\", \"Y\": \"b\", \"c\": \"X\", \"X\": \"c\", \"(\": \")\", \")\": \"(\", \"[\": \"]\", \"]\": \"[\", \"{\": \"}\", \"}\": \"{\"}; function mirrorAnimal(original){ var mirror = ''; for (i = original.length-1; i >= 0; i--){ newChar = mirrorPairs[original.charAt(i)]; if (newChar){ mirror += newChar; } else { mirror += original.charAt(i) } } return mirror; }\n\n## Random animal generation Link to heading\n\nWhile it\u2019s fun to build complicated animals this way, you\u2019ll notice something:\nit\u2019s pretty hard to make them come out right by simply typing something. Most\nof the time you need quite careful planning. In addition there\u2019s almost no\nmeaningful (English) word that corresponds to a well-defined creature. Very\noften the characters don\u2019t match, creating a sequence of \u201cchopped\u201d creatures.\n\nFor example, \u201cHello\u201d becomes:\n\nHello\n\nThis is a problem if we want to make a parametric or random creature\ngenerator, because most of the random strings won\u2019t look good.\n\n### Naive random generator Link to heading\n\nCharacters to generate:\n\nMW\u1e05O],]vi\u201d\n\n    \n    \n    const validChars = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX\u1e8aYZ\u0179\u017d\u017bab\u1e05cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\u017a\u017e\u017c,*(){}[]\u2010\u201c\u201d\u00ab\u00bb$\"; // \u2018\u2019\u2039\u203a\u20ac excluded because they're mostly vertical function randomFrom(list){ return list[Math.floor(Math.random() * list.length)]; } function generateNaive(value){ var newAnimal = ''; for (var i = 0; i < value; i++) { newAnimal += randomFrom(validChars); } return newAnimal; }\n\nCan we do better than this?\n\n## Generating \u201cgood\u201d animals Link to heading\n\nThere are many ways to define \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cwell-formed\u201d creatures. One of the\nfirst rules we can introduce is that we don\u2019t want chopped body parts to float\nalone.\n\nTranslating it into a rule we can implement: a character that is \u201copen\u201d on the\nright must be followed by a character that is open on the left, and a\ncharacter that is not open on the right must be followed by another character\nthat is not open on the left.\n\nFor example, A may be followed by B to make AB, but A cannot be followed by C\nto make AC.\n\nIn the same way, Z may be followed by A to make ZA, but Z cannot be followed\nby \u017c to make Z\u017c.\n\nThis way we will get rid of all those \u201cchopped\u201d monsters that make up most of\nthe randomly generated string.\n\nTo summarize, the rules we have to implement are:\n\n  * Any character that is open on the right must be followed by another character that is open on the left.\n  * Any character that is closed on the right must be followed by another character that is closed on the left.\n  * The first character must not be open on the left.\n  * The last character must not be open on the right.\n\n### Non-chopped animals generator Link to heading\n\nCharacters to generate:\n\nIN{EvxaY\u1e05J]\n\n    \n    \n    const charsOpenOnTheRightOnly = \"yvspmiea\u017aACFILOSW\u0179({[\"; const charsOpenOnTheLeftOnly = \"BEHKNRVZ\u017bzxurolhd\u017c)]}\"; const charsOpenOnBothSides = \"DGJMPQTUX\u1e8aY\u017dbcwtqnkjgfc\u1e05b\u017eYX\u00ab\u00bb\"; const charsOpenOnNoSides = \",*-\u201c\u201d\"; const charsOpenOnTheRight = charsOpenOnTheRightOnly + charsOpenOnBothSides; const charsOpenOnTheLeft = charsOpenOnTheLeftOnly + charsOpenOnBothSides; const validInitialChars = charsOpenOnTheRightOnly + charsOpenOnNoSides; function generateNoChop(value){ var newAnimal = '' + randomFrom(validInitialChars); for (var i = 0; i < value-1; i++) { if (charsOpenOnTheRight.indexOf(newAnimal[i]) > -1){ newAnimal += randomFrom(charsOpenOnTheLeft); } else if (charsOpenOnTheLeftOnly.indexOf(newAnimal[i]) > -1){ newAnimal += randomFrom(charsOpenOnTheRightOnly); } else if (charsOpenOnNoSides.indexOf(newAnimal[i]) > -1){ newAnimal += randomFrom(validInitialChars); } } // Final character if (charsOpenOnTheRight.indexOf(newAnimal[i]) > -1){ newAnimal += randomFrom(charsOpenOnTheLeftOnly); } else { newAnimal += randomFrom(charsOpenOnNoSides); } return newAnimal; }\n\nThe resulting animals are already quite better!\n\nThere are still a few things we may want to fix. For example, some animals end\nup being just a pair of heads (such as sN); others instead have their bodies\noriented in the wrong direction (like IgV).\n\nLet\u2019s try to get rid of those too.\n\nThe trick here is to separate the characters into two groups: elements that\nare \u201cfacing left\u201d, elements that are \u201cfacing right\u201d, and symmetric ones. At\nthis point, it\u2019s convenient to call them \u201cheads\u201d, \u201cbodies\u201d and \u201ctails\u201d to make\nthe code more understandable, like the following:\n\n  * Right heads: BEHKNRVZ\u017b\n\n  * Left heads: yvspmiea\u017a\n\n  * Right tails: ACFILOSW\u0179v\n\n  * Left tails: zxurolhd\u017cE\n\n  * Right bodies: DGJMPQTU\u1e8a\u017d\n\n  * Left bodies: wtqnkjgf\u1e05\u017e\n\n  * Entering hole: )]}\n\n  * Exiting hole: ([{\n\n  * Bounce & symmetric bodies: \u00ab\u00bb$bcXY\n\n  * Singletons: ,*-\n\nLet\u2019s put this all together!\n\n### Oriented animals generator Link to heading\n\nCharacters to generate:\n\nW\u017d\u017dU\u00bbZirC}\n\n    \n    \n    const rightAnimalHeads = \"BEHKNRVZ\u017b\"; const leftAnimalHeads = \"yvspmiea\u017a\"; const rightAnimalTails = \"ACFILOSW\u0179v\"; const leftAnimalTails = \"zxurolhd\u017cE\"; const rightAnimalBodies = \"DGJMPQTU\u1e8a\u017d\"; const leftAnimalBodies = \"wtqnkjgf\u1e05\u017e\"; const singletons = \",*\u2010\"; const exitingHole = \"([{\"; const enteringHole = \")]}\"; const bounce = \"\u00ab\u00bb$bcXY\"; const validStarts = leftAnimalHeads + rightAnimalTails + exitingHole; const validSuccessors = { [exitingHole + bounce]: rightAnimalHeads + rightAnimalBodies + leftAnimalBodies + leftAnimalTails + enteringHole + bounce, [enteringHole]: rightAnimalTails + leftAnimalHeads + exitingHole + singletons, [rightAnimalHeads + leftAnimalTails + singletons]: rightAnimalTails + leftAnimalHeads + exitingHole + singletons, [leftAnimalHeads]: leftAnimalBodies + leftAnimalBodies + leftAnimalBodies + leftAnimalTails + enteringHole + bounce, [rightAnimalTails]: rightAnimalBodies + rightAnimalBodies + rightAnimalBodies + rightAnimalHeads + enteringHole + bounce, [rightAnimalBodies]: rightAnimalBodies + rightAnimalBodies + rightAnimalBodies + rightAnimalHeads + enteringHole + bounce, [leftAnimalBodies]: leftAnimalBodies + leftAnimalBodies + leftAnimalBodies + leftAnimalTails + enteringHole + bounce, }; const validEnds = { [exitingHole + bounce]: leftAnimalTails + rightAnimalHeads + enteringHole, [rightAnimalHeads + leftAnimalTails + enteringHole]: singletons, [leftAnimalHeads]: leftAnimalTails + enteringHole, [rightAnimalTails]: rightAnimalHeads + enteringHole, [rightAnimalBodies]: rightAnimalHeads, [leftAnimalBodies]: leftAnimalTails, }; function generateOriented(value){ var newAnimal = '' + randomFrom(validStarts); for (var i = 0; i < value-1; i++) { last_char = newAnimal[i-1]; for (const [predecessor, successor] of Object.entries(validSuccessors)) { if (predecessor.indexOf(last_char) > -1){ newAnimal += randomFrom(successor); break; } } } last_char = newAnimal[i-1]; for (const [predecessor, successor] of Object.entries(validEnds)) { if (predecessor.indexOf(last_char) > -1){ newAnimal += randomFrom(successor); break; } } return newAnimal; }\n\n## A regular grammar Link to heading\n\nLet\u2019s move up a level now.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve defined up to this point is a set of rules that, given a string,\ndetermine what characters are allowed next. This is called a formal grammar in\nComputer Science.\n\nA grammar is defined primarily by:\n\n  * an alphabet of symbols (our Teranoptia font).\n  * a set of starting characters: all the characters that can be used at the start of the string (such as a or *).\n  * a set of terminating character: all the characters that can be used to terminate the string (such as d or -).\n  * a set of production rules: the rules needed to generate valid strings in that grammar.\n\nIn our case, we\u2019re looking for a grammar that defines \u201cwell formed\u201d animals.\nFor example, our production rules might look like this:\n\n  * S (the start of the string) \u2192 a (a)\n  * a (a) \u2192 ad (ad)\n  * a (a) \u2192 ab (ab)\n  * b (b) \u2192 bb (bb)\n  * b (b) \u2192 bd (bd)\n  * d (d) \u2192 E (the end of the string)\n  * , (,) \u2192 E (the end of the string)\n\nand so on. Each combination would have its own rule.\n\nThere are three main types of grammars according to Chomsky\u2019s hierarchy:\n\n  * Regular grammars: in all rules, the left-hand side is only a single nonterminal symbol and right-hand side may be the empty string, or a single terminal symbol, or a single terminal symbol followed by a nonterminal symbol, but nothing else.\n  * Context-free grammars: in all rules, the left-hand side of each production rule consists of only a single nonterminal symbol, while the right-hand side may contain any number of terminal and non-terminal symbols.\n  * Context-sensitive grammars: rules can contain many terminal and non-terminal characters on both sides.\n\nIn our case, all the production rules look very much like the examples we\ndefined above: one character on the left-hand side, at most two on the right-\nhand side. This means we\u2019re dealing with a regular grammar. And this is good\nnews, because it means that this language can be encoded into a regular\nexpression.\n\n## Building the regex Link to heading\n\nRegular expressions are a very powerful tool, one that needs to be used with\ncare. They\u2019re best used for string validation: given an arbitrary string, they\nare going to check whether it respects the grammar, i.e. whether the string it\ncould have been generated by applying the rules above.\n\nHaving a regex for our Teranoptia animals will allow us to search for valid\nanimals in long lists of stroings, for example an English dictionary. Such a\nsearch would have been prohibitively expensive without a regular expression:\nusing one, while still quite costly, is orders of magnitude more efficient.\n\nIn order to build this complex regex, let\u2019s start with a very limited example:\na regex that matches left-facing snakes.\n\n    \n    \n    ^(a(b|c|X|Y)*d)+$\n\nThis regex is fairly straightforward: the string must start with a (a), can\ncontain any number of b (b), c (c), X (X) and Y (Y), and must end with d (d).\nWhile we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s add a + to the end, meaning that this pattern can\nrepeat multiple times: the string will simply contain many snakes.\n\n### Left-facing snakes regex Link to heading\n\nValid!\n\nWhat would it take to extend it to snakes that face either side? Luckily,\nsnake bodies are symmetrical, so we can take advantage of that and write:\n\n    \n    \n    ^((a|W)(b|c|X|Y)*(d|Z))+$\n\n### Naive snakes Link to heading\n\nValid!\n\nThat looks super-promising until we realize that there\u2019s a problem: this\n\u201csnake\u201d aZ also matches the regex. To generate well-formed animals we need to\nkeep heads and tails separate. In the regex, it would look like:\n\n    \n    \n    ^( (a)(b|c|X|Y)*(d) | (W)(b|c|X|Y)*(Z) )+$\n\n### Correct snakes Link to heading\n\nValid!\n\nOnce here, building the rest of the regex is simply matter of adding the\ncorrect characters to each group. We\u2019re gonna trade some extra characters for\nan easier structure by duplicating the symmetric characters when needed.\n\n    \n    \n    ^( // Left-facing animals ( y|v|s|p|m|i|e|a|\u017a|(|[|{ // Left heads & exiting holes )( w|t|q|n|k|j|g|f|\u1e05|\u017e|X|Y|b|c|$|\u00ab|\u00bb // Left & symmetric bodies )*( z|x|u|r|o|l|h|d|\u017c|E|)|]|} // Left tails & entering holes ) | // Right facing animals ( A|C|F|I|L|O|S|W|\u0179|v|(|[|{ // right tails & exiting holes )( D|G|J|M|P|Q|T|U|\u1e8a|\u017d|b|c|X|Y|$|\u00ab|\u00bb // right & symmetric bodies )*( B|E|H|K|N|R|V|Z|\u017b|)|]|} // right heads & entering holes ) | // Singletons (,|-|*) )+$\n\n### Well-formed animals regex Link to heading\n\nValid!\n\nIf you play with the above regex, you\u2019ll notice a slight discrepancy with what\nour well-formed animal generator creates. The generator can create \u201cdouble-\nheaded\u201d monsters where a symmetric body part is inserted, like a\u00abZ. However,\nthe regex does not allow it. Extending it to account for these scenarios would\nmake it even more unreadable, so this is left as an exercise for the reader.\n\n## Searching for \u201cmonstrous\u201d words Link to heading\n\nLet\u2019s put the regex to use! There must be some English words that match the\nregex, right?\n\nGoogle helpfully compiled a text file with the most frequent 10.000 English\nwords by frequency. Let\u2019s load it up and match every line with our brand-new\nregex. Unfortunately Teranoptia is case-sensitive and uses quite a few odd\nletters and special characters, so it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019re going to find many\ninteresting creatures. Still worth an attempt.\n\n### Monster search Link to heading\n\nGo ahead and put your own vocabulary file to see if your language contains\nmore animals!\n\n## Conclusion Link to heading\n\nIn this post I\u2019ve just put together a few exercises for fun, but these tools\ncan be great for teaching purposes: the output is very easy to validate\nvisually, and the grammar involved, while not trivial, is not as complex as\nnatural language or as dry as numerical sequences. If you need something to\nkeep your students engaged, this might be a simple trick to help them\nvisualize the concepts better.\n\nOn my side, I think I\u2019m going to use these neat little monsters as weird\nfleurons :)\n\nsu\n\nDownload Teranoptia at this link: https://www.tunera.xyz/fonts/teranoptia/\n\nShare on:\n\n\u00a9 2023 - 2024 Sara Zan \u00b7 Powered by Hugo & Coder.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
