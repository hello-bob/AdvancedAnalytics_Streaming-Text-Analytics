In 1923, or 1823, the fashion was\nfor intricate and richly ornamented architecture, furniture, clothes,\ndishware, or whatever else. In 2023, fashionable objects are plain and\nminimalist, if not outright utilitarian. Steve Jobs believed that every object\nshould look as much like a featureless white sphere as possible, and the rest\nof us follow in his footsteps.\n\nMost people have noticed this trend, of course. To illustrate, here are two\nstreetlights in San Francisco. The first, right outside my office, is from\n1916:\n\nThe second is a much more recent streetlight not far from my house:\n\nGranted, even in 1916 most streetlights didn\u2019t go quite that hard. Still, it\ndemonstrates the difference\u2014the contemporary streetlight isn\u2019t just plain,\nit\u2019s ugly, without even the attention to aesthetics found in deliberate\nminimalism. This isn\u2019t just a transition from old-fashioned styles to newer\nstyles; here there is no attempt at style at all. You won\u2019t find anything like\nthat in 1916 streetlights.\n\nWhen I ask people why this is, they usually tell me it\u2019s because people can no\nlonger afford ornamentation as a result of improved technology. This seems\nbackwards\u2014everywhere else, improved technology makes nice things cheap and\nplentiful. Why would this be the opposite for ornamentation? I\u2019m often told\nit\u2019s because of the Baumol effect\u2014that when technology improves productivity\nin some fields, the cost rises in other fields where productivity remains\nrelatively lower, such as live music performances. Because ornamentation must\nbe handmade, improved technology does not improve productivity in this sector,\nand so prices rise and rise until it is unaffordable.\n\nThis is hot nonsense. Technology obviously improves the productivity of making\nand installing ornamentation. There is no law of nature which requires\neverything beautiful must be made by a seventy-year-old master craftsman\npeering through spectacles as he works with hammer and chisel. Men have used\nmass-production technology to make better and cheaper ornamentation since the\nfirst day of the Industrial Revolution\u2014literally. James Watt, whose improved\nsteam engine marks the Industrial Revolution\u2019s beginning in 1776, was good\nfriends with Josiah Wedgwood,1 an entrepreneur who used improved production\ntechniques and advanced tooling to mass-manufacture decorative vases and\ntableware, including machine-made copies of ancient Greek and Roman works.\nWedgwood sold to both middle-class consumers and the Queen of England.\n\nFor almost two centuries, improved technology steadily made ornamented objects\nand buildings accessible to more and more people. By the late 1800s,\n\u201cElaborate ornamentation [in American homes] was quite common, and its cost\nhad been greatly reduced as manufacturers learned to replace skilled craftsmen\nwith modern machines. \u201cInstead of stone carvers who chiseled the cornices,\nthere was a machine that stamped out cheap tin imitations. Instead of wood-\ncarvers, a hydraulic press squeezed wood into intricate carved shapes.\u201d\u201d2 In\njust the last few years, 3D-printed busts have become widely and cheaply\navailable through online storefronts.\n\nThese advances in mass manufacturing were also responsible for the 1916\nstreetlight. Over three hundred were installed\u2014you can just see two others in\nthe background of my photo above. It looks like the pieces were cast from\nmolds and assembled onsite:\n\nProgress has continued, and with modern tooling and containerized freight, we\nnow have the technology to make similar streetlights with even better methods\nand larger economies of scale. A single factory could turn them out by the\nthousands and ship them across the world. Today we can carve out molds with\nCNC machine tools rather than having a sculptor make them manually like we did\nin 1916, and for production at that scale we probably would, unless it\u2019s\nsomeday supplanted by 3D printed molds or another new technology that\u2019s even\nbetter and cheaper. The engineers who design flat-packed furniture for\nunskilled assembly in your living room could certainly design a beautiful\nstreetlight for semiskilled laborers to easily and cheaply assemble on streets\nfrom Chicago to Nanjing.\n\nLet\u2019s take a simpler example, with no need for analyzing manufacturing\nprocesses and supply chains. This cabinet is in the lobby of my office\nbuilding, the Mechanics Institute, built in 1910:\n\nWhy is simple decoration like this so rare in more recent work? There\u2019s\nnothing prohibitively expensive about applying a stencil and a bit of gold\npaint. There\u2019s clearly some barrier to installing things like this today, but\nit\u2019s not the cost of labor.\n\nIf we move from architecture to tableware, this is even more obvious. Stamping\nplates or mugs with intricate designs is so cheap it adds practically nothing\nto the final cost, and this has been true for decades at least. I paid two\ndollars per piece for these:\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? If it\u2019s not a matter of well-designed things becoming\nprohibitively expensive, why do we see less of this stuff?\n\nI have some stories that can shed light on this. When my former roommate\nDaniel was admiring the plates above, he mentioned that the idea of buying\ndecorated plates and bowls had never occurred to him. In other words, the\nreason our previous tableware had been featureless white was not because, like\nthe economically rational agent who theorists love so much, he had considered\nall available options and deliberately decided that the aesthetics-price\npackage of plain white plates was superior. Rather, he bought it on autopilot,\nas we all do for most of our purchases.\n\nAnother story. As you can probably guess, I like ornate and ornamented\nfurniture. I can\u2019t find the things I like from popular furniture makers at any\nprice, but this actually isn\u2019t a problem, because it\u2019s fast and easy to find\ngorgeous antiques browsing Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace or equivalents,\nand these are much cheaper than new unornamented furniture.3 When I go to pick\nit up, literally more than half the time the seller tells me without prompting\nhow glad she is that someone is taking this, she was about to throw it out\nbecause nobody wants it, which would be a big shame because it belonged to her\nrecently-deceased mother or something. The rest of the time, the sellers are\nhobbyists who attend estate sales for love of the art, and resell the good\npieces at little or no profit.\n\nAnother story. Not too long after I moved in, Daniel picked up a bit of an eye\nfor older ornamented furniture. One day he passed a nice cabinet left on the\nsidewalk for anyone to claim. Daniel went to get his car to bring the cabinet\nhome. When he returned, the owner was smashing the unwanted cabinet apart so\nit would be easier to trash, having given up on giving it away. (Fortunately\nhe had only dismantled a couple of drawers before Daniel stopped him, and I\nwas able to patch it back together so you\u2019d never know anything happened.)\n\nAll of this paints a clear picture. Why is there so much less decoration\ntoday? \u201cIt\u2019s too expensive\u201d doesn\u2019t hold water. The decorated objects are out\nthere, if you look for ten minutes. They\u2019re often the same price as decent-\nquality plain objects. If they\u2019re durable and there\u2019s a secondary market, then\nthey\u2019re cheaper or sometimes outright free. Nevertheless people do not consume\nwhat\u2019s available. Often they\u2019re thrown out and destroyed for lack of interest.\n\nPeople just don\u2019t want this stuff. Why not? I have my guesses, but I\u2019ll leave\nthe speculation for the footnotes.4 What\u2019s clear is that, for whatever reason,\nmost people choose plain objects over intricate ones at the same price point.\nIn some cases, such as tableware, ornate products are available cheaply and in\nquantity, but are ignored by most consumers. In other cases, such as\nstreetlights, making ornate products cheaply could be done only at large scale\nwith a serious capital investment, and this is not done because manufacturers\nrightly believe there is no demand for the potential products.\n\nIf this demand existed, we\u2019d also be able to see it in the real estate market.\nAs I mentioned, my office is in a gorgeous building from 1910. Here\u2019s another\nphoto I took in the lobby:\n\nAccording to the demand hypothesis, most people would love to be in a building\nlike this and seek it out, and these offices would go for at least a modest\npremium. In fact, offices in this building rent for below the San Francisco\nmarket average.\n\nSo what\u2019s a man to do if he wants beautiful things? Put your money where your\nmouth is. There\u2019s no sense in following lots of aesthetic social media\naccounts and talking a good game about returning to the days of good taste if\nevery object in your house is a beige rectangle. A lot of people would rather\nhold off until someone else starts a grand movement and makes a new style\npopular, but artistic trends don\u2019t start when people sit and wait, they start\nwhen people act. You can live in a beautiful building. You can have beautiful\nfurniture. You can frame a giant print of your favorite Romantic-period\npainting in your living room. There\u2019s lots of stuff like this out there for\nthe taking.\n\nThere are also a few things you might want that aren\u2019t being made because of a\nlack of public demand. But \u201cpublic demand\u201d isn\u2019t the weather. You are the\npublic. Demand it. But don\u2019t demand it on social media. Demand it the way a\nbusinessman demands it. Pay cash to the local artists and the Etsy craftsmen\nand the antique dealers. If your taste is good, then producers of beautiful\nthings will flourish a bit more, and the next person who comes looking will\nfind that much more of it. If you come, they will build it.\n\nSubscribe to Ben Landau-Taylor\n\nFollow Ben Landau-Taylor on Twitter: @benlandautaylor\n\n1\n\nWedgwood was also an ardent abolitionist who turned his factories to producing\nthousands of medallions with the \u201cAm I not a man and a brother?\u201d symbol,\noriginating the anti-slavery movement\u2019s most influential and enduring image.\n\n2\n\nRobert Gordon, The Rise And Fall Of American Growth, p. 107. He, in turn,\nquotes Edward Clifford Clark, The American Family Home, 1800-1960, p. 82.\n\n3\n\nThe exception is upholstered furniture, which doesn\u2019t survive for a century\nunless it\u2019s almost completely replaced, Ship of Theseus style. The result is\nthat even the tiny public demand for ornate seating can exhaust the equally\ntiny supply of adequately-maintained antiques, and bid up the price to vaguely\nreasonable levels on par with new, plain furniture.\n\n4\n\nTo say that the fashion has changed is unhelpful. If it became fashionable to\nuse ornate and beautiful things, then most people would change what they buy.\nThis is just a tautology.\n\nThere are two interesting questions here. The first is why the fashion changed\nin this way. Some of my friends say that it\u2019s a consequence of increasing\nwealth; when ornament was expensive, it was a reliable signal of wealth, and\nso it was a good way to show off. Today people often countersignal wealth and\nsophistication by avoiding the now-affordable ornamentation, similar to how\nrich people used to be fatter than average, but today are thinner than\naverage. Others say that the World Wars broke people\u2019s faith in the culture\nand values which the older styles express, and so people turned away into\nmodernist styles which rejected the older ways and express very different\nideas\u2014you can arguably see similar transitions in fashion, music, and fine\nart. Neither of these feels completely satisfying to me but I think the latter\nis closer to the mark.\n\nThe other interesting question is why most people say that the ornamented\nstyle is more beautiful and more pleasant, but surround themselves with plain\nor minimalist objects instead. Partly, it\u2019s because people usually buy one of\nthe \u201cdefault\u201d options that\u2019s presented to them in store shelves or online\nsearch results rather than hunting for something specific, and the defaults\nwill be whatever is in fashion; you make a lot of purchases in a year, and no\none has the attention to think deeply about all of them. Mostly, though, it\u2019s\nbecause most people prioritize looking normal or fashionable above their own\nsense of beauty.\n\n### Subscribe to Ben Landau-Taylor\n\nLaunched 8 months ago\n\nInvestigating power, society, and industry.\n\n53 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n7 Restacks\n\n53\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why We Can't Have Nice Things\n\nwww.benlandautaylor.com\n\n15\n\nShare\n\n15 Comments\n\nKristen LuisoOn The MapDec 27, 2023Liked by Ben Landau-TaylorA wise woman once\ntold me (my mom!) always look for it at an antique store first: You\u2019ll find\nsomething more unique and beautiful.

You chose a\nparticularly disgusting streetlight as your example, but if you go to many\nnewly developing cities you can see streetlights that may not be as charming\nas some antiquated ornamented lights, but they are also not blatantly\noffensive like the one in your example. That streetlight must've been\npurchased either by a city planner that despises other people or purchased\nduring the 2000s (a dark time when the world was being flooded with disgusting\ndesigns at a pace unprecendented in human history, e.g. look at the best-\nselling cars from that era, then compare it to the previous decade or the\ndecade after. What the hell happened?).You can't even blame functionalism for\nthat disgusting streetlight, since as you said, it ignores \"the attention to\naesthetics found in deliberate minimalism.\" A streetlight designed by Apple\nproduct designers probably would not be such a bad thing (as long as it didn't\nforce me to sign in using my Apple ID).If you're making a stronger point that\na well-designed modern streetlight is inferior to a well-designed ornamented\nstreetlight, I'm not sure if I entirely agree with that. But I do agree that\neven the most well-designed modern products have an inescapable sameness to\nthem that diminishes the aesthetic personality of the thing, especially for\npublic architecture and design.The more fundamental aesthetic problem seems to\nme to be why there are no longer any distinct cultural features reflected in\nthe general design of our personal and public spaces, which you touch on in\nthe footnotes. The usual explanation other than the ones you offered is that\nthe sameness is the result of globalization. An architecture firm employing a\nmultinational team educated in multiple countries using standard textbooks and\ncourse material probably has 1) many of the same ideas as everybody else, and\n2) they have to make a large degree of compromise even if they all have\nculturally distinct design ideas.There are some famous counterexamples like\nthe Xi'an International Football Centre (https://i.imgur.com/ukroPXA.png), but\nthis is an expensive custom design that only works in a place already present\nwith a highly developed aesthetic history. What happens in places with no\ncultural distinctness or aesthetic history? Trying to imagine a distinctive\nTexas football stadium is basically impossible. What even is Texas\narchitecture? The closest thing is maybe old cowboy towns with semi-temporary\nwooden buildings. A football stadium in the style of a saloon would feel like\na theme park at best and an oversized hipster shack at worst. A stadium in the\nneoclassical style like the Alamo would be even more comical. It would look\nlike a giant McMansion with vestigial McMansion pillars. Would slapping on\nmore ornamentation really fix the fundamental aesthetic problem? I don't think\nso.That gets to the broader political problem. A country like the US is an\nassimilationist culture that also proselytizes under the liberal universalist\ndogma that all men are created equal. It's contradictory for a country such as\nthe US to pursue distinctive cultural features while at same time trying to\nsubsume the world under its cultural hegemony. The reason why people in cities\nall over the world watch the same movies and listen to the same music and wear\nsame clothes and read the same news and even care about the same hot-button\nissues as Americans is that the US culture and media industry has been able to\nmass produce totally non-distinct, one-size-fits-all, globalized cultural\nproducts easily consumable by masses of people of all different backgrounds.\nIn other words, if American culture were more distinct, it would be less\nattractive to non-Americans, and the US culture industry would not be able to\nexercise as much subjective control over the world. As long as American ideas\nand its mode of cultural production predominates in the world, that feeling of\nsameness, of Apple-ness, is also bound to remain.Expand full commentLike\n(4)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n13 more comments...\n\nThe DDoS Attack Of Academic Bullshit\n\nNot long ago, during a discussion with a Zoomer colleague about how to find\nresearch material, I realized that he had never experienced internet search...\n\nApr 10 \u2022\n\nBen Landau-Taylor\n\n57\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The DDoS Attack Of Academic Bullshit\n\nwww.benlandautaylor.com\n\n14\n\nMy Mom's Rules For Cults\n\nI wasn\u2019t the first person in my family to run off to San Francisco to join a\nmovement of fringe countercultural weirdos that later somehow found itself...\n\nFeb 7 \u2022\n\nBen Landau-Taylor\n\n26\n\nShare this post\n\n#### My Mom's Rules For Cults\n\nwww.benlandautaylor.com\n\n2\n\nProbability Is Not A Substitute For Reasoning\n\nSeveral Rationalists objected to my recent \u201cAgainst AGI Timelines\u201d post, in\nwhich I argued that \u201cthe arguments advanced for particular timelines [to...\n\nMar 6 \u2022\n\nBen Landau-Taylor\n\n20\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Probability Is Not A Substitute For Reasoning\n\nwww.benlandautaylor.com\n\n8\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Ben Landau-Taylor\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
