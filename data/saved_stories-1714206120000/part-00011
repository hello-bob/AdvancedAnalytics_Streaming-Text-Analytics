Now that the Candidates\ntournament is over, I thought that it might be interesting to look at this\ntournament. I certainly wasn\u2019t disappointed.\n\nThe first thing I took a look at was the scores of the players with White and\nBlack.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see that Pragganandhaa scored very well with Black and\nthat Firouzja did horribly with Black.\n\nChess Engine Lab is a reader-supported publication.

This shows how well he played. It\u2019s also impressive that\nNepomniachtchi was clearly worse in 6 games, but hasn\u2019t lost any of them.\n\nEdit: I also created a plot showing the better positions and won games.\n\nThis plot shows that Caruana didn\u2019t use his chances as effectively as others.\nAgain, it\u2019s amazing how well Nepo utilised all his chances.\n\nI also decided to look at the number of moves where each player was better or\nworse. I split it into much worse (<-1), slightly worse (from -1 to -0.5),\nequal (from -0.5 to 0.5), slightly better (from 0.5 to 1) and much better\n(>+1).\n\nAgain, it\u2019s amazing that Gukesh was hardly ever worse in the whole tournament.\n\n##\n\nSharpness\n\nI also generated a plot for the average sharpness change of each player per\nmove. I\u2019ve written about these plots here.\n\nThis plot is a bit surprising to me. I thought that Pragg\u2019s sharpness change\nwould be much higher, but maybe I\u2019m too much influenced by his opening\nchoices.\n\nAlso Vidit\u2019s and Firouzja\u2019s sharpness changes seem quite extreme. This might\nbe influenced by the quality of their play, which I\u2019ve mentioned in my post on\nthe average sharpness change.\n\n##\n\nAccuracy Distribution\n\nFinally, I\u2019ve generated a plot for the accuracy distribution of each player.\nPreviously, I\u2019ve written about the centipawn loss distribution. These plots\nare similar, but they show the accuracy for each move, not the centipawn loss.\nI\u2019ve also changed the y-axis to be logarithmic.\n\nAgain, these plots show just how well Gukesh played.\n\n##\n\nFuture Stats & Graphs\n\nI\u2019ll do more such graphs for future tournaments (and maybe also for players\nover a year or their whole career), so I\u2019d be very happy to hear which other\nstats and graphs you\u2019d like to see included.\n\nI haven\u2019t done any stats regarding openings, because I didn\u2019t have time for\nthat. But I\u2019ll include them in the future. I want to look at the number of\nnovelties of each player and also some basic stats, like the most common\nopenings and their win-rates. This will be even more relevant when looking at\nmany games by one player, not just one tournament.\n\nI also thought about including move times and maybe a look at the correlation\nbetween the accuracy and time taken per move. But again, this is something for\nthe future.\n\nIf you have other ideas for new stats and graphs or suggestions how I can\nimprove the current graphs (either the stats themselves or the look of the\ngraphs) please let me know.\n\nLeave a comment\n\n3 Likes\n\n3\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Candidates in 13 Graphs\n\nchessenginelab.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nEvaluating Sharpness using LC0's WDL\n\nCan engines tell how sharp a position is?\n\nApr 4 \u2022\n\nJulian\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Evaluating Sharpness using LC0's WDL\n\nchessenginelab.substack.com\n\n5\n\nCalculating the Sharpness of Different Players\n\nHow well does the sharpness score agree with the human intuition about\nsharpness?\n\nApr 19 \u2022\n\nJulian\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Calculating the Sharpness of Different Players\n\nchessenginelab.substack.com\n\n3\n\nCentipawn Loss Distribution\n\nLooking at how mistakes are distributed in chess games\n\nApr 13 \u2022\n\nJulian\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Centipawn Loss Distribution\n\nchessenginelab.substack.com\n\n3\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 ChessEngineLab\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
