Well\u2019s Famous Feud About Writing, the Purpose of Art,\nand the Usefulness of Literature\n\n### By Maria Popova\n\n\u201cWhat art does is to coax us away from the mechanical and towards the\nmiraculous,\u201d Jeanette Winterson wrote in 2006. A century earlier, two of\nliterature\u2019s most revered titans clashed on this question of what art does,\nand the debris became the soil in which nearly every contemporary debate about\nthe purpose of creative work grows.\n\nHenry James (April 13, 1843\u2013February 28, 1916) and H.G. Wells (September 21,\n1866\u2013August 13, 1946) were a generation apart, but had much in common \u2014 both\nchampioned freedom of speech, had strong political views, and wrote incisive\nsocial commentary; both were nominated for the Nobel Prize several times but\nnever won. And yet, despite their commonalities, the two writers collided on\nthe subject at the center of their work \u2014 the nature of purpose of art,\nincluding literature. Their contrasting views capture a divide that continues\nto bedevil creative culture today.\n\nThe feud began in friendship: When Wells first emerged onto the literary\nscene, James was intrigued by the young writer\u2019s talent and eventually\ndeclared his admiration directly: \u201cYou are, for me ... the most interesting\n\u2018literary man\u2019 of your generation \u2014 in fact, the only interesting one.\u201d But\nJames soon came to lament a paradox in Wells\u2019s writing, which he articulated\nto a friend as \u201cso much talent with so little art, so much life with (so to\nspeak) so little living.\u201d For James, who had once described the \u201cdivine\npreoccupation\u201d of art as an \u201cintimate restlessness of projection and\nperception,\u201d aliveness was always the true measure of art \u2014 something Joseph\nConrad would later capture in his beautiful tribute to him. Wells, trained as\na biologist and best-known for his science fiction masterworks, considered\nhimself above all a journalist \u2014 he measured writing by its usefulness in the\nservice of truth.\n\nThis irreconcilable contrast of sensibilities came to a head the year before\nJames\u2019s death, when he was 72 and Wells 49.\n\nIn 1915, exactly twenty years after Wells made a name for himself and\npopularized the concept of time travel with The Time Machine, he published a\nsatirical novel titled Boon, parodying James\u2019s writing and depicting a\nparagraph of his as a hippopotamus trying to pick up a pea in a corner \u2014 a\ncaricature crowned with the accusation that James \u201cnever discovered that a\nnovel isn\u2019t a picture ... that life isn\u2019t a studio.\u201d\n\nIllustrations from the original edition of Wells\u2019s Boon\n\nJames was bemused and perhaps somewhat betrayed, given his early support of\nWells\u2019s work, but he responded with surprising graciousness given the\nblindsiding ferocity of the attack. (One of the consolations of old age surely\nmust be a certain capacity for pause between stimulus and response, a\nwillingness to reflect before reacting and to rise above the irascible\nimmediacy of the situation in order to take a bird\u2019s-eye view.)\n\nIn a considered and dignified defense, found in Henry James: A Life in Letters\n(public library), James argues that the artist is ultimately beholden only to\nhis own measure of fullness \u2014 \u201cfullness of life and the projection of it,\nwhich seems to you [Wells] an emptiness of both.\u201d\n\nBut Wells, rather than honoring James\u2019s sympathetic search for, if not common\nground then, at least, mutual understanding, dug his heels in stubbornly:\n\n> To you literature like painting is an end, to me literature like\n> architecture is a means, it has a use. Your view was, I felt, altogether too\n> prominent in the world of criticism and I assailed it in lines of harsh\n> antagonism. And writing that stuff about you was the first escape I had from\n> the obsession of this war. Boon is just a waste-paper basket. Some of it was\n> written before I left my home at Sandgate (1911), and it was while I was\n> turning over some old papers that I came upon it, found it expressive, and\n> went on with it last December. I had rather be called a journalist than an\n> artist, that is the essence of it, and there was no other antagonist\n> possible than yourself. But since it was printed I have regretted a hundred\n> times that I did not express our profound and incurable contrast with a\n> better grace.\n\nThis time, James was moved to outrage. He responded by, first, pointing at the\nseeming ingratitude of the ordeal by reminding Wells of his steadfast support:\n\n> My dear Wells,\n>\n> I am bound to tell you that I don\u2019t think your letter makes out any sort of\n> case for the bad manners of Boon, as far as your indulgence in them at the\n> expense of your poor old H. J. is concerned \u2014 I say \u201cyour\u201d simply because he\n> has been yours, in the most liberal, continual, sacrificial, the most\n> admiring and abounding critical way, ever since he began to know your\n> writings: as to which you have had copious testimony.\n\nHe then takes on Wells\u2019s condemnation of his \u201cview of life and literature,\u201d\nstill in a compliment sandwich of dissent:\n\n> Your comparison of the book to a waste-basket strikes me as the reverse of\n> felicitous, for what one throws into that receptacle is exactly what one\n> doesn\u2019t commit to publicity and make the affirmation of one\u2019s estimate of\n> one\u2019s contemporaries by. I should liken it much rather to the preservative\n> portfolio or drawer in which what is withheld from the basket is savingly\n> laid away.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> I have no view of life and literature, I maintain, other than that our form\n> of the latter in especial is admirable exactly by its range and variety, its\n> plasticity and liberality, its fairly living on the sincere and shifting\n> experience of the individual practitioner. That is why I have always so\n> admired your so free and strong application of it, the particular rich\n> receptacle of intelligences and impressions emptied out with an energy of\n> its own, that your genius constitutes... For myself I live, live intensely\n> and am fed by life, and my value, whatever it be, is in my own kind of\n> expression of that.\n\nAfter a few asides about his general beliefs and their particular differences,\nJames delivers his greatest contestation:\n\n> I absolutely dissent from the claim that there are any differences whatever\n> in the amenability to art of forms of literature aesthetically determined,\n> and hold your distinction between a form that is (like) painting and a form\n> that is (like) architecture for wholly null and void. There is no sense in\n> which architecture is aesthetically \u201cfor use\u201d that doesn\u2019t leave any other\n> art whatever exactly as much so; and so far from that of literature being\n> irrelevant to the literary report upon life, and to its being made as\n> interesting as possible, I regard it as relevant in a degree that leaves\n> everything else behind. It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes\n> importance, for our consideration and application of these things, and I\n> know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process. If I\n> were Boon I should say that any pretence of such a substitute is helpless\n> and hopeless humbug; but I wouldn\u2019t be Boon for the world, and am only yours\n> faithfully,\n>\n> Henry James\n\nHenry James: A Life in Letters remains one of the most psychologically\ninsightful collections of correspondence ever made public. (That his brother\nwas the pioneering psychologist William James seems both beside the point and\na point.) Complement this particular excerpt with William Faulkner on the\npurpose of art and Jeanette Winterson on how art creates a sanctified space\nfor the human spirit.\n\n# donating = loving\n\nEvery month, I spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars keeping The\nMarginalian going.
