It isn't that git is so\ncomplicated that you need a large document to take care of your particular\nproblem, it is more that the set of things that you might have done is so\nlarge that different techniques are needed depending on exactly what you have\ndone and what you want to have happen.\n\nIf you have problems after clicking through this document, please copy-paste\nthe \"Path\" you took (what links you clicked on, automatically presented to you\nif javascript is available) when asking for further help, since doing so will\nexplain very precisely what you were trying to do, and that you at least tried\nto help yourself.\n\nStrongly consider taking a backup of your current working directory and .git\nto avoid any possibility of losing data as a result of the use or misuse of\nthese instructions. We promise to laugh at you if you fail to take a backup\nand regret it later.\n\nAnswer the questions posed by clicking the link for that section. A section\nwith no links is a terminal node and you should have solved your problem by\ncompleting the suggestions posed by that node (if not, then report the chain\nof answers you made on #git or some other git resource and explain further why\nthe proposed answer doesn't help). This is not a document to read linearly.\n\n## Are you trying to find that which is lost or fix a change that was made?\n\n6th June 2015 at 5:54am\n\nQuestions\n\nDue to previous activities (thrashing about), you may have lost some work\nwhich you would like to find and restore. Alternately, you may have made some\nchanges which you would like to fix. Fixing includes updating, rewording, and\ndeleting or discarding.\n\n  * Fix a change\n  * Find what is lost\n\nFork me on GitHub\n\n", "frontpage": false}
