After nearly a decade of Acquired episodes, we are finally ready to\ntackle the most valuable company ever created. The company that put a computer\non every desk and in every home. The company that invented the software\nbusiness model. The company that so thoroughly and completely dominated every\nconceivable competitor that the United States government intervened and\nkneecapped it... yet it\u2019s STILL the most valuable company in the world today.\n\nThis episode tells the story of Microsoft in its heyday, the PC Era. We cover\nits rise from a teenage dream to the most powerful business and technology\nforce in history \u2014 the 20-year period from 1975 to 1995 that took Bill and\nPaul from the Lakeside high school computer room to launching Windows 95\nalongside Jay Leno and the Rolling Stones. From BASIC to DOS, Windows, Office,\nIntel, IBM, Xerox PARC, Apple, Steve Jobs, Steve Ballmer... it\u2019s all here, and\nit\u2019s all amazing. Tune in and enjoy...

After five years and over 100 episodes, we decided to\nformalize the answer to Acquired\u2019s most frequently asked question: \u201cwhat are\nthe best acquisitions of all time?\u201d Here it is: The Acquired Top Ten. You can\nlisten to the full episode (above, which includes honorable mentions), or read\nour quick blog post below.\n\nNote: we ranked the list by our estimate of absolute dollar return to the\nacquirer. We could have used ROI multiple or annualized return, but we decided\nthe ultimate yardstick of success should be the absolute dollar amount added\nto the parent company\u2019s enterprise value. Afterall, you can\u2019t eat IRR! For\nmore on our methodology, please see the notes at the end of this post. And for\nall our trademark Acquired editorial and discussion tune in to the full\nepisode above!\n\n# 10\\. Marvel\n\nPurchase Price: $4.2 billion, 2009\n\nEstimated Current Contribution to Market Cap: $20.5 billion\n\nAbsolute Dollar Return: $16.3 billion\n\nBack in 2009, Marvel Studios was recently formed, most of its movie rights\nwere leased out, and the prevailing wisdom was that Marvel was just some old\ncomic book IP company that only nerds cared about. Since then, Marvel\nCinematic Universe films have grossed $22.5b in total box office receipts\n(including the single biggest movie of all-time), for an average of $2.2b\nannually. Disney earns about two dollars in parks and merchandise revenue for\nevery one dollar earned from films (discussed on our Disney, Plus episode).\nTherefore we estimate Marvel generates about $6.75b in annual revenue for\nDisney, or nearly 10% of all the company\u2019s revenue. Not bad for a set of nerdy\ncomic book franchises...\n\nMarvel\n\nSeason 1, Episode 26\n\nLP Show\n\n1/5/2016\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n# 9\\. Google Maps (Where2, Keyhole, ZipDash)\n\nTotal Purchase Price: $70 million (estimated), 2004\n\nEstimated Current Contribution to Market Cap: $16.9 billion\n\nAbsolute Dollar Return: $16.8 billion\n\nMorgan Stanley estimated that Google Maps generated $2.95b in revenue in 2019.\nAlthough that\u2019s small compared to Google\u2019s overall revenue of $160b+, it still\naccounts for over $16b in market cap by our calculations. Ironically the\nmajority of Maps\u2019 usage (and presumably revenue) comes from mobile, which grew\nout of by far the smallest of the 3 acquisitions, ZipDash. Tiny yet mighty!\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nSeason 5, Episode 3\n\nLP Show\n\n8/28/2019\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n# 8\\. ESPN\n\nTotal Purchase Price: $188 million (by ABC), 1984\n\nEstimated Current Contribution to Market Cap: $31.2 billion\n\nAbsolute Dollar Return: $31.0 billion\n\nABC\u2019s 1984 acquisition of ESPN is heavyweight champion and still undisputed\nG.O.A.T. of media acquisitions.With an estimated $10.3B in 2018 revenue,\nESPN\u2019s value has compounded annually within ABC/Disney at >15% for an\nastounding THIRTY-FIVE YEARS. Single-handedly responsible for one of the\ngreatest business model innovations in history with the advent of cable\ncarriage fees, ESPN proves Albert Einstein\u2019s famous statement that \u201cCompound\ninterest is the eighth wonder of the world.\u201d\n\nESPN\n\nSeason 4, Episode 1\n\nLP Show\n\n1/28/2019\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n# 7\\. PayPal\n\nTotal Purchase Price: $1.5 billion, 2002\n\nValue Realized at Spinoff: $47.1 billion\n\nAbsolute Dollar Return: $45.6 billion\n\nWho would have thought facilitating payments for Beanie Baby trades could be\nso lucrative? The only acquisition on our list whose value we can precisely\nmeasure, eBay spun off PayPal into a stand-alone public company in July 2015.\nIts value at the time? A cool 31x what eBay paid in 2002.\n\nPayPal\n\nSeason 1, Episode 11\n\nLP Show\n\n5/8/2016\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n# 6\\. Booking.com\n\nTotal Purchase Price: $135 million, 2005\n\nEstimated Current Contribution to Market Cap: $49.9 billion\n\nAbsolute Dollar Return: $49.8 billion\n\nRemember the Priceline Negotiator? Boy did he get himself a screaming deal on\nthis one. This purchase might have ranked even higher if Booking Holdings\u2019\nstock (Priceline even renamed the whole company after this acquisition!)\nweren\u2019t down ~20% due to COVID-19 fears when we did the analysis. We also took\na conservative approach, using only the (massive) $10.8b in annual revenue\nfrom the company\u2019s \u201cAgency Revenues\u201d segment as Booking.com\u2019s contribution \u2014\nthere is likely more revenue in other segments that\u2019s also attributable to\nBooking.com, though we can\u2019t be sure how much.\n\nBooking.com (with Jetsetter & Room 77 CEO Drew Patterson)\n\nSeason 1, Episode 41\n\nLP Show\n\n6/25/2017\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n# 5\\. NeXT\n\nTotal Purchase Price: $429 million, 1997\n\nEstimated Current Contribution to Market Cap: $63.0 billion\n\nAbsolute Dollar Return: $62.6 billion\n\nHow do you put a value on Steve Jobs? Turns out we didn\u2019t have to! NeXTSTEP,\nNeXT\u2019s operating system, underpins all of Apple\u2019s modern operating systems\ntoday: MacOS, iOS, WatchOS, and beyond. Literally every dollar of Apple\u2019s\n$260b in annual revenue comes from NeXT roots, and from Steve wiping the\nproduct slate clean upon his return. With the acquisition being necessary but\nnot sufficient to create Apple\u2019s $1.4 trillion market cap today, we\nconservatively attributed 5% of Apple to this purchase.\n\nNeXT\n\nSeason 1, Episode 23\n\nLP Show\n\n10/23/2016\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n# 4\\. Android\n\nTotal Purchase Price: $50 million, 2005\n\nEstimated Current Contribution to Market Cap: $72 billion\n\nAbsolute Dollar Return: $72 billion\n\nSpeaking of operating system acquisitions, NeXT was great, but on a pure value\nbasis Android beats it. We took Google Play Store revenues (where Google\u2019s 30%\ncut is worth about $7.7b) and added the dollar amount we estimate Google saves\nin Traffic Acquisition Costs by owning default search on Android ($4.8b), to\nreach an estimated annual revenue contribution to Google of $12.5b from the\ndiminutive robot OS. Android also takes the award for largest ROI multiple:\n>1400x. Yep, you can\u2019t eat IRR, but that\u2019s a figure VCs only dream of.\n\nAndroid\n\nSeason 1, Episode 20\n\nLP Show\n\n9/16/2016\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n# 3\\. YouTube\n\nTotal Purchase Price: $1.65 billion, 2006\n\nEstimated Current Contribution to Market Cap: $86.2 billion\n\nAbsolute Dollar Return: $84.5 billion\n\nWe admit it, we screwed up on our first episode covering YouTube: there\u2019s no\nway this deal was a \u201cC\u201d. With Google recently reporting YouTube revenues for\nthe first time ($15b \u2014 almost 10% of Google\u2019s revenue!), it\u2019s clear this\nacquisition was a juggernaut. It\u2019s past-time for an Acquired revisit.\n\nThat said, while YouTube as the world\u2019s second-highest-traffic search engine\n(second-only to their parent company!) grosses $15b, much of that revenue\n(over 50%?) gets paid out to creators, and YouTube\u2019s hosting and bandwidth\ncosts are significant. But we\u2019ll leave the debate over the division\u2019s\nprofitability to the podcast.\n\nYouTube\n\nSeason 1, Episode 7\n\nLP Show\n\n2/3/2016\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n# 2\\. DoubleClick\n\nTotal Purchase Price: $3.1 billion, 2007\n\nEstimated Current Contribution to Market Cap: $126.4 billion\n\nAbsolute Dollar Return: $123.3 billion\n\nA dark horse rides into second place! The only acquisition on this list not-\nyet covered on Acquired (to be remedied very soon), this deal was far, far\nmore important than most people realize. Effectively extending Google\u2019s\nadvertising reach from just its own properties to the entire internet,\nDoubleClick and its associated products generated over $20b in revenue within\nGoogle last year. Given what we now know about the nature of competition in\ninternet advertising services, it\u2019s unlikely governments and antitrust\nauthorities would allow another deal like this again, much like #1 on our\nlist...\n\n# 1\\. Instagram\n\nPurchase Price: $1 billion, 2012\n\nEstimated Current Contribution to Market Cap: $153 billion\n\nAbsolute Dollar Return: $152 billion\n\nSource: SportsNation\n\nWhen it comes to G.O.A.T. status, if ESPN is M&A\u2019s Lebron, Insta is its MJ. No\noffense to ESPN/Lebron, but we\u2019ll probably never see another acquisition\nthat\u2019s so unquestionably dominant across every dimension of the M&A game as\nFacebook\u2019s 2012 purchase of Instagram. Reported by Bloomberg to be doing $20B\nof revenue annually now within Facebook (up from ~$0 just eight years ago),\nInstagram takes the Acquired crown by a mile. And unlike YouTube, Facebook\nkeeps nearly all of that $20b for itself! At risk of stretching the MJ analogy\ntoo far, given the circumstances at the time of the deal \u2014 Facebook\u2019s\n\u201cmissing\u201d of mobile and existential questions surrounding its ill-fated IPO \u2014\nbuying Instagram was Facebook\u2019s equivalent of Jordan\u2019s Game 6. Whether this\ndeal was ultimately good or bad for the world at-large is another question,\nbut there\u2019s no doubt Instagram goes down in history as the greatest\nacquisition of all-time.\n\nInstagram\n\nSeason 1, Episode 2\n\nLP Show\n\n10/31/2015\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\nThe Acquired Top Ten data, in full.\n\nMethodology and Notes:\n\n  * In order to count for our list, acquisitions must be at least a majority stake in the target company (otherwise it\u2019s just an investment). Naspers\u2019 investment in Tencent and Softbank/Yahoo\u2019s investment in Alibaba are disqualified for this reason.\n  * We considered all historical acquisitions \u2014 not just technology companies \u2014 but may have overlooked some in areas that we know less well. If you have any examples you think we missed ping us on Slack or email at: acquiredfm@gmail.com\n  * We used revenue multiples to estimate the current value of the acquired company, multiplying its current estimated revenue by the market cap-to-revenue multiple of the parent company\u2019s stock. We recognize this analysis is flawed (cashflow/profit multiples are better, at least for mature companies), but given the opacity of most companies\u2019 business unit reporting, this was the only way to apply a consistent and straightforward approach to each deal.\n  * All underlying assumptions are based on public financial disclosures unless stated otherwise. If we made an assumption not disclosed by the parent company, we linked to the source of the reported assumption.\n  * This ranking represents a point in time in history, March 2, 2020. It is obviously subject to change going forward from both future and past acquisition performance, as well as fluctuating stock prices.\n  * We have five honorable mentions that didn\u2019t make our Top Ten list. Tune into the full episode to hear them!\n\nSponsor:\n\n  * Thanks to Silicon Valley Bank for being our banner sponsor for Acquired Season 6.
