By partnering with commercial entities, NASA not only advances its\ntechnology commercialization goals but also supports the U.S. space industry\u2019s\nglobal leadership. Credit: Northrop Grumman\n\nNASA\u2019s innovative propulsion technology propels small spacecraft exploration\nand extends satellite lifetimes, supporting U.S. leadership in space\ntechnology.\n\nNASA has developed an advanced propulsion technology to facilitate future\nplanetary exploration missions using small spacecraft. Not only will this\ntechnology enable new types of planetary science missions, one of NASA\u2019s\ncommercial partners is already preparing to use it for another purpose\u2014to\nextend the lifetimes of spacecraft that are already in orbit. Identifying the\nopportunity for industry to use this new technology not only advances NASA\u2019s\ngoal of technology commercialization, it could potentially create a path for\nNASA to acquire this important technology from industry for use in future\nplanetary missions.\n\n#### The New Technology\n\nPlanetary science missions using small spacecraft will be required to perform\nchallenging propulsive maneuvers\u2014such as achieving planetary escape\nvelocities, orbit capture, and more\u2014that require a velocity change (delta-v)\ncapability well in excess of typical commercial needs and the current state-\nof-the-art. Therefore, the #1 enabling technology for these small spacecraft\nmissions is an electric propulsion system that can execute these high-delta-v\nmaneuvers. The propulsion system must operate using low power (sub-kilowatt)\nand have high-propellant throughput (i.e., the capability to use a high total\nmass of propellant over its lifetime) to enable the impulse required to\nexecute these maneuvers.\n\nAfter many years of research and development, researchers at NASA Glenn\nResearch Center (GRC) have created a small spacecraft electric propulsion\nsystem to meet these needs\u2014the NASA-H71M sub-kilowatt Hall-effect thruster. In\naddition, the successful commercialization of this new thruster will soon\nprovide at least one such solution to enable the next generation of small\nspacecraft science missions requiring up to an amazing 8 km/s of delta-v. This\ntechnical feat was accomplished by the miniaturization of many advanced high-\npower solar electric propulsion technologies developed over the last decade\nfor applications such as the Power and Propulsion Element of Gateway,\nhumanity\u2019s first space station around the Moon.\n\nLeft: NASA-H71M Hall-effect thruster on the Glenn Research Center Vacuum\nFacility 8 thrust stand.

This capability is\nespecially remarkable because commercial launch opportunities to LEO and GTO\nhave become routine, and the excess launch capacity of such missions is often\nsold at low cost to deploy secondary spacecraft. The ability to conduct\nmissions that originate from these near-Earth orbits can greatly increase the\ncadence and lower the cost of lunar and Mars science missions.\n\nThis propulsion capability will also increase the reach of secondary\nspacecraft, which have been historically limited to scientific targets that\nalign with the primary mission\u2019s launch trajectory. This new technology will\nenable secondary missions to substantially deviate from the primary mission\u2019s\ntrajectory, which will facilitate exploration of a wider range of scientific\ntargets.\n\nIn addition, these secondary spacecraft science missions would typically have\nonly a short period of time to collect data during a high-speed flyby of a\ndistant body. This greater propulsive capability will allow deceleration and\norbital insertion at planetoids for long-term scientific study.\n\nFurthermore, small spacecraft outfitted with such significant propulsive\ncapability will be better equipped to manage late-stage changes to the primary\nmission\u2019s launch trajectory. Such changes are frequently a top risk for small\nspacecraft science missions with limited onboard propulsive capability that\ndepend on the initial launch trajectory to reach their science target.\n\n#### Commercial Applications\n\nThe megaconstellations of small spacecraft now forming in low-Earth orbits\nhave made low-power Hall-effect thrusters the most abundant electric\npropulsion system used in space today. These systems use propellant very\nefficiently, which allows for orbit insertion, de-orbiting, and many years of\ncollision avoidance and re-phasing. However, the cost-conscious design of\nthese commercial electric propulsion systems has inevitably limited their\nlifetime capability to typically less than a few thousand hours of operation\nand these systems can only process about 10% or less of a small spacecraft\u2019s\ninitial mass in propellant.\n\nBy contrast, planetary science missions benefiting from the NASA-H71M electric\npropulsion system technology could operate for 15,000 hours and process over\n30% of the small spacecraft\u2019s initial mass in propellant. This game-changing\ncapability is well beyond the needs of most commercial LEO missions and comes\nat a cost premium that makes commercialization for such applications unlikely.\nTherefore, NASA sought and continues to seek partnerships with companies\ndeveloping innovative commercial small spacecraft mission concepts with\nunusually large propellant throughput requirements.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NGHT-1X engineering model Hall-effect thruster operating in\nGlenn Research Center Vacuum Facility 8.

Credit: Northrop Grumman\n\nOne partner that will soon use the licensed NASA electric propulsion\ntechnology in a commercial small spacecraft application is SpaceLogistics, a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman. The Mission Extension Pod (MEP)\nsatellite servicing vehicle is equipped with a pair of Northrop Grumman\nNGHT-1X Hall-effect thrusters, whose design is based on the NASA-H71M. The\nsmall spacecraft\u2019s large propulsive capability will allow it to reach\ngeosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) where it will be mounted on a far larger\nsatellite. Once installed, the MEP will serve as a \u201cpropulsion jet pack\u201d to\nextend the life of its host spacecraft for at least six years.\n\nNorthrop Grumman is currently conducting a long duration wear test (LDWT) of\nthe NGHT-1X in GRC\u2019s Vacuum Facility 11 to demonstrate its full lifetime\noperational capability. The LDWT is funded by Northrop Grumman through a fully\nreimbursable Space Act Agreement. The first MEP spacecraft are expected to\nlaunch in 2025, where they will extend the life of three GEO communication\nsatellites.\n\nCollaborating with U.S. industry to find small spacecraft applications with\npropulsive requirements similar to future NASA planetary science missions not\nonly supports U.S. industry in remaining a global leader in commercial space\nsystems but creates new commercial opportunities for NASA to acquire these\nimportant technologies as planetary missions require them.\n\nNASA continues to mature the H71M electric propulsion technologies to expand\nthe range of data and documentation available to U.S. industry for the purpose\nof developing similarly advanced and highly capable low-power electric\npropulsion devices.\n\nSHARE TWEET REDDIT EMAIL SHARE\n\n#### More on SciTechDaily\n\nSpace\n\n### Earth and Mars Were Formed From Collisions of Large Bodies Made of Inner\nSolar System Material\n\nScience\n\n### Ancient DNA Extracted From Human Bones Rewrites Early Japanese History \u2013\nModern Day Populations Have Tripartite Genetic Origin\n\nSpace\n\n### NASA Updates International Space Station Transition Plan \u2013 What\u2019s Coming\nNext\n\nSpace\n\n### NASA Artemis I \u2013 Flight Day 25: Orion Spacecraft in Home Stretch of\nJourney\n\nSpace\n\n### 20 Years of Science Discoveries From NASA\u2019s Wind Spacecraft\n\nSpace\n\n### Astronomers Find Surprisingly Mature Galaxies in the Very Early Universe\n\nSpace\n\n### Cosmic Building Blocks of Life Discovered \u2013 Scientists Perform First\nChemical-Free Analysis of Extraterrestrial Amino Acids in Winchcombe Meteorite\n\nBiology\n\n### Scientists Uncover a Gut-Brain Connection for Social Development\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nI consent to the use of Google Analytics and related cookies across the\nTrendMD network (widget, website, blog).

Then will build\nsomething the size of an Aircraft Carrier in Space and a space Station in the\nmoons orbit. The Sides can hold water which will prevent radiation. Use say a\nNumber of small Nuclear Reactors, then use those to power say 1000 ION\nthrusters. We should have been launching new versions of Voyager in all\ndirections for the last 20 years and launching Communication Relays to exist\non the edge of our space.
