Wonderful accounted for over 13% of the\nstate\u2019s paraquat use, applying almost 57,000 pounds to its fields, according\nto the analysis published Thursday by the Environmental Working Group (EWG),\nwhich drew from data obtained from the California Department of Pesticide\nRegulation and county agriculture commissioners.\n\nThe company\u2019s website states that \u201cenvironmental sustainability is at the\ncenter of our work\u201d and that the company, \u201cin all its operations, must be a\ndeeply responsible steward of the environment, and lead by example to create a\nsustainable future.\u201d Wonderful has invested $400 million in sustainable\nagriculture, according to its website.\n\nThe Wonderful Company did not respond to request for comment.\n\nJust 10 farms and companies in the top agricultural state sprayed 40% of all\nparaquat used in California in 2021, the analysis found. The biggest paraquat\nuser in the state was the JG Boswell Co., a major producer of cotton, tomatoes\nfor paste, and seed crops, which also accounted for over 13% of California\u2019s\nparaquat use that year.\n\n\u201cFolks have known about paraquat for a while... but I think it\u2019s clear the\npublic doesn\u2019t fully appreciate where these pesticides are being applied and\nhow close it is to their communities,\u201d said Geoff Horsfield, a policy director\nat the Environmental Working Group who works on pesticides and other\nagricultural issues.\n\nMany countries initially banned paraquat because it is incredibly lethal when\ningested even in tiny amounts, said Horsfield, noting that the herbicide was\nwidely used as a method of suicide in South Korea and other countries. But the\nprimary way people are exposed to paraquat is by inhaling it, he said. Both\nfarmworkers and community members whose homes border farm fields are at risk\nfrom paraquat exposure.\n\n\u201cIf you live near an almond grove, a vineyard or a cotton field, we know that\nespecially now, given drought and weather changes, pesticide drift can be a\nreal threat,\u201d said Horsfield.\n\nLatinos living in low-income California communities are disproportionately\nexposed to the toxic weedkiller, according to another recent EWG analysis.\n\nThe analysis of California\u2019s top paraquat sprayers comes on the heels of a\nbill recently introduced in the California State Assembly that, if passed,\nwould ban paraquat in that state beginning in 2026. While over 60 countries\nhave banned paraquat, it was reapproved by the US Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) in 2021. A recent draft report suggests the agency continues to\nconclude that the controversial herbicide is safe despite dozens of peer-\nreviewed studies linking it to Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nIn October 2022, The New Lede, in collaboration with The Guardian, revealed\ninternal documents from the agricultural company Syngenta that exposed years\nof corporate efforts to cover up evidence that paraquat can cause Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease, as well as evidence of efforts to influence the EPA and published\nscientific literature.\n\nThere are plenty of alternatives to paraquat, noted Horsfield. While the\nweedkiller is used on some California vineyards, for example, it is banned in\nFrance and Italy \u2013 both famous for their wines.\n\n\u201cWe know these products can be successfully grown in California without the\nuse of [paraquat],\u201d said Horsfield.\n\n(Featured image by Robert Anasch on Unsplash.)\n\nHealthy or high risk?
