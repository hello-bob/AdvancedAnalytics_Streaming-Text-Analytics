It angered many of\nhis colleagues, led NPR leaders to announce monthly internal reviews of the\nnetwork's coverage, and gave fresh ammunition to conservative and partisan\nRepublican critics of NPR, including former President Donald Trump.\n\nConservative activist Christopher Rufo is among those now targeting NPR's new\nchief executive, Katherine Maher, for messages she posted to social media\nyears before joining the network. Among others, those posts include a 2020\ntweet that called Trump racist and another that appeared to minimize rioting\nduring social justice protests that year. Maher took the job at NPR last month\n\u2013 her first at a news organization.\n\nIn a statement Monday about the messages she had posted, Maher praised the\nintegrity of NPR's journalists and underscored the independence of their\nreporting.\n\n\"In America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen,\" she\nsaid. \"What matters is NPR's work and my commitment as its CEO: public\nservice, editorial independence, and the mission to serve all of the American\npublic. NPR is independent, beholden to no party, and without commercial\ninterests.\"\n\nThe network noted that \"the CEO is not involved in editorial decisions.\"\n\nIn an interview with me later on Monday, Berliner said the social media posts\ndemonstrated Maher was all but incapable of being the person best poised to\ndirect the organization.\n\n\"We're looking for a leader right now who's going to be unifying and bring\nmore people into the tent and have a broader perspective on, sort of, what\nAmerica is all about,\" Berliner said. \"And this seems to be the opposite of\nthat.\"\n\nEnlarge this image\n\nConservative critics of NPR are now targeting its new chief executive,\nKatherine Maher, for messages she posted to social media years before joining\nthe public radio network last month. Stephen Voss/Stephen Voss hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nStephen Voss/Stephen Voss\n\nConservative critics of NPR are now targeting its new chief executive,\nKatherine Maher, for messages she posted to social media years before joining\nthe public radio network last month.\n\nStephen Voss/Stephen Voss\n\nHe said that he tried repeatedly to make his concerns over NPR's coverage\nknown to news leaders and to Maher's predecessor as chief executive before\npublishing his essay.\n\nBerliner has singled out coverage of several issues dominating the 2020s for\ncriticism, including trans rights, the Israel-Hamas war and COVID. Berliner\nsays he sees the same problems at other news organizations, but argues NPR, as\na mission-driven institution, has a greater obligation to fairness.\n\n\"I love NPR and feel it's a national trust,\" Berliner says. \"We have great\njournalists here. If they shed their opinions and did the great journalism\nthey're capable of, this would be a much more interesting and fulfilling\norganization for our listeners.\"\n\n### A \"final warning\"\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the interview were singular.\n\nBerliner provided me with a copy of the formal rebuke to review. NPR did not\nconfirm or comment upon his suspension for this article.\n\nIn presenting Berliner's suspension Thursday afternoon, the organization told\nthe editor he had failed to secure its approval for outside work for other\nnews outlets, as is required of NPR journalists. It called the letter a \"final\nwarning,\" saying Berliner would be fired if he violated NPR's policy again.\nBerliner is a dues-paying member of NPR's newsroom union but says he is not\nappealing the punishment.\n\nThe Free Press is a site that has become a haven for journalists who believe\nthat mainstream media outlets have become too liberal. In addition to his\nessay, Berliner appeared in an episode of its podcast Honestly with Bari\nWeiss.\n\nIn the rebuke, NPR did not cite Berliner's appearance on Chris Cuomo's\nNewsNation program last Tuesday night, for which NPR gave him the green light.\n(NPR's chief communications officer told Berliner to focus on his own\nexperience and not share proprietary information.) The NPR letter also did not\ncite his remarks to the New York Times, which ran its article mid-afternoon\nThursday, shortly before the reprimand was sent. Berliner says he did not seek\napproval before talking with the Times.\n\n### Media\n\n### NPR defends its journalism after senior editor says it has lost the\npublic's trust\n\nBerliner says he did not get permission from NPR to speak with me for this\nstory but that he was not worried about the consequences: \"Talking to an NPR\njournalist and being fired for that would be extraordinary, I think.\"\n\nBerliner is a member of NPR's business desk, as am I, and he has helped to\nedit many of my stories. He had no involvement in the preparation of this\narticle and did not see it before it was posted publicly.\n\nIn rebuking Berliner, NPR said he had also publicly released proprietary\ninformation about audience demographics, which it considers confidential. He\nsaid those figures \"were essentially marketing material. If they had been\nreally good, they probably would have distributed them and sent them out to\nthe world.\"\n\n### Feelings of anger and betrayal inside the newsroom\n\nHis essay and subsequent public remarks stirred deep anger and dismay within\nNPR. Colleagues contend Berliner cherry-picked examples to fit his arguments\nand challenge the accuracy of his accounts. They also note he did not seek\ncomment from the journalists involved in the work he cited.\n\nMorning Edition host Michel Martin told me some colleagues at the network\nshare Berliner's concerns that coverage is frequently presented through an\nideological or idealistic prism that can alienate listeners.\n\n\"The way to address that is through training and mentorship,\" says Martin,\nherself a veteran of nearly two decades at the network who has also reported\nfor The Wall Street Journal and ABC News. \"It's not by blowing the place up,\nby trashing your colleagues, in full view of people who don't really care\nabout it anyway.\"\n\nSeveral NPR journalists told me they are no longer willing to work with\nBerliner as they no longer have confidence that he will keep private their\ninternal musings about stories as they work through coverage.\n\n\"Newsrooms run on trust,\" NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben\ntweeted last week, without mentioning Berliner by name. \"If you violate\neveryone's trust by going to another outlet and sh---ing on your colleagues\n(while doing a bad job journalistically, for that matter), I don't know how\nyou do your job now.\"\n\nBerliner rejected that critique, saying nothing in his essay or subsequent\nremarks betrayed private observations or arguments about coverage.\n\nOther newsrooms are also grappling with questions over news judgment and\nconfidentiality. On Monday, New York Times Executive Editor Joseph Kahn\nannounced to his staff that the newspaper's inquiry into who leaked internal\ndissent over a planned episode of its podcast The Daily to another news outlet\nproved inconclusive. The episode was to focus on a December report on the use\nof sexual assault as part of the Hamas attack on Israel in October. Audio\nstaffers aired doubts over how well the reporting stood up to scrutiny.\n\n\"We work together with trust and collegiality everyday on everything we\nproduce, and I have every expectation that this incident will prove to be a\nsingular exception to an important rule,\" Kahn wrote to Times staffers.\n\nAt NPR, some of Berliner's colleagues have weighed in online against his claim\nthat the network has focused on diversifying its workforce without a\nconcomitant commitment to diversity of viewpoint. Recently retired chief\nexecutive John Lansing has referred to this pursuit of diversity within NPR's\nworkforce as its \"North Star,\" a moral imperative and chief business strategy.\n\nIn his essay, Berliner tagged the strategy as a failure, citing the drop in\nNPR's broadcast audiences and its struggle to attract more Black and Latino\nlisteners in particular.\n\n\"During most of my tenure here, an open-minded, curious culture prevailed. We\nwere nerdy, but not knee-jerk, activist, or scolding,\" Berliner writes. \"In\nrecent years, however, that has changed.\"\n\nBerliner writes, \"For NPR, which purports to consider all things, it's\ndevastating both for its journalism and its business model.\"\n\nNPR Investigative reporter Chiara Eisner wrote in a comment for this story:\n\"Minorities do not all think the same and do not report the same. Good\nreporters and editors should know that by now. It's embarrassing to me as a\nreporter at NPR that a senior editor here missed that point in 2024.\"\n\nSome colleagues drafted a letter to Maher and NPR's chief news executive,\nEdith Chapin, seeking greater clarity on NPR's standards for its coverage and\nthe behavior of its journalists - clearly pointed at Berliner.\n\n### A plan for \"healthy discussion\"\n\nOn Friday, CEO Maher stood up for the network's mission and the journalism,\ntaking issue with Berliner's critique, though never mentioning him by name.\nAmong her chief issues: she said Berliner's essay offered \"a criticism of our\npeople on the basis of who we are.\"\n\nBerliner took great exception to that, saying she had denigrated him. He said\nthat he supported diversifying NPR's workforce to look more like the U.S.\npopulation at large. She did not address that in a subsequent private exchange\nhe shared with me for this story. (An NPR spokesperson declined further\ncomment.)\n\nLate Monday afternoon, Chapin announced to the newsroom that Executive Editor\nEva Rodriguez would lead monthly meetings to review coverage.\n\n\"Among the questions we'll ask of ourselves each month: Did we capture the\ndiversity of this country - racial, ethnic, religious, economic, political\ngeographic, etc \u2013 in all of its complexity and in a way that helped listeners\nand readers recognize themselves and their communities?\" Chapin wrote in the\nmemo. \"Did we offer coverage that helped them understand \u2013 even if just a bit\nbetter \u2014 those neighbors with whom they share little in common?\"\n\nBerliner said he welcomed the announcement but would withhold judgment until\nthose meetings played out.\n\nIn a text for this story, Chapin said such sessions had been discussed since\nLansing unified the news and programming divisions under her acting leadership\nlast year.\n\n\"Now seemed [the] time to deliver if we were going to do it,\" Chapin said.\n\"Healthy discussion is something we need more of.\"\n\nDisclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Media Correspondent\nDavid Folkenflik and edited by Deputy Business Editor Emily Kopp and Managing\nEditor Gerry Holmes.
