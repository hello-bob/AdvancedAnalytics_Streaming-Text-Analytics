I couldn't pinpoint why, but I always had this\nperception that mainstream, \"pretty\" blog content was somehow subpar. You\nmight think, \"Well, making the font look nice doesn't make the content worse,\ndoes it?\"\n\nThen, I stumbled upon a concept on Wikipedia that shed light on this issue:\nLectio difficilior potior. This Latin phrase, meaning \"the more difficult\nreading is the stronger,\" is one of the principles in textual criticism. It\nsuggests that when manuscripts differ, the more unusual or challenging reading\nis likely closer to the original. The idea is that scribes would often\nsimplify or modify strange or controversial phrases into something more\nfamiliar and less contentious. According to Wikipedia, someone said: \"And\nwhenever the Fathers report that there is a variant reading, that one always\nappears to me to be more esteemed (by them is the one) which at first glance\nseems the more absurd-since it is reasonable that a reader who is either not\nvery learned or not very attentive was offended by the specter of absurdity\nand changed the text.\"\n\nThis principle isn't just limited to ancient texts. The internet today is a\nperfect example(I took this example from here):\n\n  1. John McPhee, a creative nonfiction pioneer, writes a series of essays.\n\n  2. An entrepreneur turns these essays into a high-priced course.\n\n  3. A student summarizes this course.\n\n  4. Twitter users create threads based on the student's summary.\n\n  5. Eventually, someone gets invited to a podcast to summarize these Twitter threads.\n\nThink about it \u2013 The original insight reveals that even mere transcription can\ndilute a text's original, controversial elements. If the text is repackaged,\nhow much further from the original message does it stray?\n\nIn information theory, the measure of the amount of information in something\nis often its degree of surprise. Connecting the dots, the amount of original\ninformation it contains decreases as text gets passed on and modified. Over\ntime, even the best ideas can become diluted or eroded.\n\nThe Takeaway: Even if an idea is widely circulated, there's value in seeking\nout its original source.\n\nIt is over.
