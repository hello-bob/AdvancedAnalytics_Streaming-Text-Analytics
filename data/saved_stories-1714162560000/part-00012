Verisign engineer Matt\nThomas wrote a lengthy APNIC blog post outlining the problem and defining its\nscope.\n\n## How DNS resolution normally works\n\nEnlarge / These servers are the final authority which must be consulted to\nresolve .com, .net, and so forth\u2014and to tell you that 'frglxrtmpuf' isn't a\nreal TLD.\n\nJim Salter\n\nDNS, or the Domain Name System, is how computers translate relatively\nmemorable domain names like arstechnica.com into far less memorable IP\naddresses, like 3.128.236.93. Without DNS, the Internet couldn't exist in a\nhuman-usable form\u2014which means unnecessary load on its top-level infrastructure\nis a real problem.\n\nLoading a single modern webpage can require a dizzying number of DNS lookups.\nWhen we analyzed ESPN's front page, we counted 93 separate domain names\u2014from\na.espncdn.com to z.motads.com\u2014which needed to be performed in order to fully\nload the page!\n\nIn order to keep the load manageable for a lookup system that must service the\nentire world, DNS is designed as a many-stage hierarchy. At the top of this\npyramid are the root servers\u2014each top-level domain, such as .com, has its own\nfamily of servers that are the ultimate authority for every domain beneath it.\nOne step above those are the actual root servers, a.root-servers.net through\nm.root-servers.net.\n\n## How often does this happen?\n\nA very small percentage of the world's DNS queries actually reaches the root\nservers, due to the DNS infrastructure's multilevel caching hierarchy. Most\npeople will get their DNS resolver information directly from their ISP. When\ntheir device needs to know how to reach arstechnica.com, the query first goes\nto that local ISP-managed DNS server. If the local DNS server doesn't know the\nanswer, it will forward the query to its own \"forwarders,\" if any are defined.\n\nIf neither the ISP's local DNS server nor any \"forwarders\" defined in its\nconfiguration have the answer cached, the query eventually bubbles up directly\nto the authoritative servers for the domain above the one you're trying to\nresolve\u2014for arstechnica.com, that would mean querying the authoritative\nservers for com itself, at gtld-servers.net.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gtld-servers system queried responds with a list of authoritative\nnameservers for the arstechnica.com domain, along with at least one \"glue\"\nrecord containing the IP address for one such nameserver. Now, the answers\npercolate back down the chain\u2014each forwarder passes those answers down to the\nserver that queried it until the answer finally reaches both the local ISP\nserver and the user's computer\u2014and all of them along the line cache that\nanswer to avoid bothering any \"upstream\" systems unnecessarily.\n\nFor the vast majority of such queries, the NS records for arstechnica.com will\nalready be cached at one of those forwarding servers, so the root servers\nneedn't be bothered. So far, though, we're talking about a more familiar sort\nof URL\u2014one that resolves to a normal website. Chrome's queries hit a level\nabove that, at the actual root-servers.net clusters themselves.\n\n## Chromium and the NXDomain hijack test\n\nEnlarge / Chromium's \"is this DNS server f'ng with me?\" probes represent about\nhalf of all the traffic reaching Verisign's DNS root-server cluster.\n\nMatthew Thomas\n\nThe Chromium browser\u2014parent project to Google Chrome, the new Microsoft Edge,\nand countless other lesser-known browsers\u2014wants to offer users the simplicity\nof a single-box search, sometimes known as an \"Omnibox.\" In other words, you\ntype both real URLs and search engine queries into the same text box in the\ntop of your browser. Taking ease-of-use one step further, it doesn't force you\nto actually type the http:// or https:// part of the URL, either.\n\nAs convenient as it might be, this approach requires the browser to understand\nwhat should be treated as a URL and what should be treated as a search query.\nFor the most part, this is fairly obvious\u2014anything with spaces in it won't be\na URL, for example. But it gets tricky when you consider intranets\u2014private\nnetworks, which may use equally private TLDs that resolve to actual websites.\n\nIf a user on a company intranet types in \"marketing\" and that company's\nintranet has an internal website by the same name, Chromium displays an\ninfobar asking the user whether they intended to search for \"marketing\" or\nbrowse to https://marketing. So far, so good\u2014but many ISPs and shared Wi-Fi\nproviders hijack every mistyped URL, redirecting the user to an ad-laden\nlanding page of some sort.\n\n## Generate randomly\n\nChromium's authors didn't want to have to see \"did you mean\" infobars on every\nsingle-word search in those common environments, so they implemented a test:\non startup or change of network, Chromium issues DNS lookups for three\nrandomly generated seven-to-15-character top-level \"domains.\" If any two of\nthose requests come back with the same IP address, Chromium assumes the local\nnetwork is hijacking the NXDOMAIN errors it should be receiving\u2014so it just\ntreats all single-word entries as search attempts until further notice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, on networks that aren't hijacking DNS query results, those\nthree lookups tend to propagate all the way up to the root nameservers: the\nlocal server doesn't know how to resolve qwajuixk, so it bounces that query up\nto its forwarder, which returns the favor, until eventually a.root-servers.net\nor one of its siblings has to say \"Sorry, that's not a domain.\"\n\nSince there are about 1.67*10^21 possible seven-to-15-character fake domain\nnames, for the most part every one of these probes issued on an honest network\nbothers a root server eventually. This adds up to a whopping half the total\nload on the root DNS servers, if we go by the statistics from Verisign's\nportion of the root-servers.net clusters.\n\n## History repeats itself\n\nThis isn't the first time a well-meaning project has swamped or nearly swamped\na public resource with unnecessary traffic\u2014we were immediately reminded of the\nlong, sad story of D-Link and Poul-Henning Kamp's NTP (Network Time Protocol)\nserver, from the mid-2000s.\n\nIn 2005, Poul-Henning Kamp\u2014a FreeBSD developer, who also ran Denmark's only\nStratum 1 Network Time Protocol server\u2014got an enormous unexpected bandwidth\nbill. To make a long story short, D-Link developers hardcoded Stratum 1 NTP\nserver addresses, including Kamp's, into firmware for the company's line of\nswitches, routers, and access points. This immediately increased the bandwidth\nusage of Kamp's server ninefold, causing the Danish Internet Exchange to\nchange his bill from \"Free\" to \"That'll be $9,000 per year, please.\"\n\nThe problem wasn't that there were too many D-Link routers\u2014it was that they\nwere \"jumping the chain of command.\" Much like DNS, NTP is intended to operate\nin a hierarchical fashion\u2014Stratum 0 servers feed Stratum 1 servers, which feed\nStratum 2 servers, and on down the line. A simple home router, switch, or\naccess point like the ones D-Link had hardcoded these NTP servers into should\nbe querying a Stratum 2 or Stratum 3 server.\n\nThe Chromium project, presumably with the best intentions in mind, has\ntranslated the NTP problem into a DNS problem by loading down the Internet's\nroot servers with queries they should never have to process.\n\n## Resolution hopefully in sight\n\nThere's an open bug in the Chromium project requesting that the Intranet\nRedirect Detector be disabled by default to resolve this issue. To be fair to\nthe Chromium project, the bug was actually opened before Verisign's Matt\nThomas drew a giant red circle around the issue in his APNIC blog post. The\nbug was opened in June but languished until Thomas' post; since Thomas' post,\nit has received daily attention.\n\nHopefully, the issue will soon be resolved\u2014and the world's root DNS servers\nwill no longer need to answer about 60 billion bogus queries every day.\n\nListing image by Matthew Thomas\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n230\n\nJim Salter Jim is an author, podcaster, mercenary sysadmin, coder, and father\nof three\u2014not necessarily in that order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### SITREP: F-16 replacement search a signal of F-35 fail?\n\nFootage courtesy of Dvids, Boeing, and The United States Navy.\n\n  * ##### SITREP: F-16 replacement search a signal of F-35 fail?\n\n  * ##### Sitrep: Boeing 707\n\n  * ##### Steve Burke of GamersNexus Reacts To Their Top 1000 Comments On YouTube\n\n  * ##### Scott Manley Reacts To His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### LGR's Clint Basinger Reacts To His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The F-35's next tech upgrade\n\n  * ##### Fighter Pilot Breaks Down Every Button in an F-15 Cockpit\n\n  * ##### Linus \"Tech Tips\" Sebastian Reacts to His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### Customizing Mini 4WD Racers For High Speeds On A Small Scale\n\n  * ##### MegaBots: Born to Smash Anything in Their Path\n\n  * ##### First Look: Xbox Adaptive Controller\n\n  * ##### Quantum Computing Expert Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\n\n  * ##### Kids versus 80s tech: Game Boy, Vectrex and a stereo system\n\n  * ##### Expert Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty - Blockchain\n\n  * ##### Best wearable tech of 2017\n\n  * ##### The Moov HR Sweat - heart rate monitor in a headband | Ars Technica\n\nMore videos\n\n\u2190 Previous story Next story \u2192\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Today on Ars\n\nCNMN Collection WIRED Media Group \u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
