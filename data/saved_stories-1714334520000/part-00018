What\ncan customers do to try to minimize risk and save money?\n\nMicrosoft\n\nIn a perfect world, Microsoft would take security seriously again. It would be\ntransparent about breaches. Its execs would stop gloating about increasing\nsecurity service revenue at a time when Microsoft can\u2019t secure its own\nemployees, let alone customers, against incidents that are happening with\nincreasing frequency. And Microsoft would include must-have security\ncapabilities as part of existing subscriptions instead of selling them as add-\nons.\n\nSelling security as a premium offering helped Microsoft build security into a\nself-proclaimed $20 billion USD per year business (as of January 2023). Making\nMicrosoft 365 E5 a prerequisite to obtain core security tools is one part of\nMicrosoft\u2019s security growth strategy. Another is to make certain security\ntools available only as add-ons on top of its Microsoft 365 E5 subscription.\n\n\u201cCustomers need the tools to keep their organizations secure without having to\npay more and more every year for Microsoft\u2019s latest top-shelf security\nservices \u2014 which keep moving to higher and higher shelves,\u201d according to\nDirections on Microsoft analyst Wes Miller.\n\n### The easiest but priciest option: Go all Microsoft 365 E5\n\nUntil Microsoft concedes, if it ever does, and makes more core security\ncomponents part of the base Microsoft 365 subscriptions, what should customers\ndo?\n\nSome organizations are choosing to license all of their knowledge workers with\nMicrosoft 365 E5, which costs $57 USD per user per month, because E5 includes\nall the capabilities of E3 and adds most (but not all) of Microsoft\u2019s top-\nshelf security and compliance service. There is risk in only partially\nlicensing an organization for E5, since security and compliance tools are\ntypically enabled across the entire Microsoft 365 tenancy and rarely perform\nlicense enforcement at a per-user level.\n\nOther customers try to get around going all E5 by cobbling together a bunch of\na la carte security and compliance pieces and adding them to less expensive\nMicrosoft 365 E3 or Office 365 E3 subscriptions.\n\nThis approach may have made financial sense for some orgs but doesn\u2019t add up\nnow. For several years, Microsoft offered two add-ons, Microsoft 365 E5\nSecurity and Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance ($12 USD each), as a way for\norganizations to bring E3 users into license compliance without paying the\nfull price of E5. But due to price increases implemented in 2022 for almost\nall Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites, it is now more expensive to license\nusers for the security and compliance capabilities via the two legacy add-ons\ninstead of just licensing Microsoft 365 E5, which has not changed price in\nsome time.\n\n### Microsoft takes a baby step\n\nIt\u2019s not completely out of the question that Microsoft could make core\nsecurity features part of more of its subscriptions. It did make a couple of\nconcessions on that front after a couple of much-publicized attacks last year.\n\nOAuth, a protocol for authorizing applications, was a key component used by\nMidnight Blizzard to attack Microsoft in 2023. While OAuth-based applications\nhave become more common and are now increasingly being exploited to breach\norganizations, Microsoft has offered limited tools to help with oversight, and\nhas been requiring Microsoft 365 E5 to use any of them.\n\nAfter the Storm-0558 email hack which hit Microsoft and some of its key\ngovernment customers last year, Microsoft\u2019s faced complaints about some of its\nsecurity-upselling practices. Logging information that would have allowed\ndetection of the incident was only available to those Microsoft 365 customers\nwho purchased the premium E5 plan. Those running E3 were unable to see the\nrequired logging information.\n\nMicrosoft officials pledged to make logging more broadly available, and in\nOct., 2023, increased audit logging for Purview Audit (Standard) to 180 days\nfrom the original 90 days. For customers generally licensed with Microsoft 365\nE3 (or less), this means that once logs are optimally configured, customers\nhave 180 days to analyze the logged events for malicious actors before those\nevents are lost entirely. But if customers want a longer period of logging,\nthey still need to add Purview Audit (Premium) for one year of retention, and\nthe 10-year Audit Log Retention add-on for up to 10 years of retention.\n\nWill Microsoft bend further and make security core to more of its cloud\nsubscriptions to help lessen the impact of attacks, not to mention bad\npublicity?
