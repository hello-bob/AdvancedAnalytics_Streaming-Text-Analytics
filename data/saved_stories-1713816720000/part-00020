Megaslides are extreme versions of these underwater events. The\nsixth-largest recorded megaslide occurred in the Surveyor Fan in the Gulf of\nAlaska around 1.2 million years ago. It was at least 16,124 square kilometers\nin area, and the preserved volume today is 9,080 cubic kilometers. At the\ntime, before some portions of the slide were subducted or accreted, the volume\nwas at least 16,280 cubic kilometers.\n\nA new study by Gulick et al. examines this significant slide. Using images\nfrom seismic reflection surveys and ground truth data from drilling efforts in\nthe Gulf of Alaska, researchers uncovered the existence of the slide, as well\nas the seafloor topography from before and after it occurred. Between 0.6 and\n1.2 million years ago, the glacial-interglacial cycle began growing longer, a\nchange known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT). The researchers suggest\nthat sediment buildup and flux at the start of the MPT due to great ice\nextents caused slope instability, meaning when a large earthquake struck the\nregion, it likely triggered the megaslide. They also noted an absence of\nmegaslides of the same magnitude after this event.\n\nAlthough seismic activity continues in the region, the slides that do occur\nare smaller for several reasons. One is a change in the balance between\nsediment flux (which can cause slope instability) and seismic strengthening,\nin which shaking causes sediment to compact, ultimately improving slope\nstability. In addition, ice streams crossing the continental shelf spread\nsediment deposits over large areas on the continental slope, leading to less\ncohesive slides. The continued buildup of sediment along the Alaska margin\nalso reduced the critical wedge taper, which lowers the likelihood the slope\nwill fail.
