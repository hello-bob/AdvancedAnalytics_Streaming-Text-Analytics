Despite various selective thermal emitters have been demonstrated, it\nis still challenging to achieve these conditions simultaneously because of the\nextreme difficulty in controlling thermal emission of photonic structures in\nmultidimension. Here we demonstrated hybrid polar dielectric metasurface\nthermal emitters with machine learning inverse design, enabling a high\nemissivity of ~0.92 within the atmospheric transparency window 8\u201313 \u03bcm, a\nlarge spectral selectivity of ~1.8 and a wide emission angle up to 80 degrees,\nsimultaneously. This selective and omnidirectional thermal emitter has led to\na new record of temperature reduction as large as ~15.4 \u00b0C under strong solar\nirradiation of ~800 W/m^2, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art\nresults. The designed structures also show great potential in tackling the\nurban heat island effect, with modelling results suggesting a large energy\nsaving and deployment area reduction. This research will make significant\nimpact on passive radiative cooling, thermal energy photonics and tackling\nglobal climate change.\n\nKeywords:\n\n    * radiative cooling /\n    * dielectric metasurfaces /\n    * machine learning /\n    * thermal emitters\n\nFullText(HTML)\n\n  * ### Introduction\n\nThe accelerated global warming and environmental threats on human life have\nmotivated enormous research and development on zero-carbon cooling\ntechnologies to replace or complement the conventional compressed air-based\ncooling technologies. Daytime passive radiative cooling is a recently\ndemonstrated disruptive technology that could potentially transform the global\nenergy landscape because of its zero-energy consumption and zero-carbon\nemission^1-7. The success of this technology replies on the spectral control\nover both the solar and thermal wavelengths by advanced photonic structures\nand micro/nano-fabrication technologies that enable simultaneous reflection of\nstrong solar irradiation and radiation of heat to the ultracold outer space^5,\n6, 8-36.\n\nIdeal selective thermal emitters with a unity emissivity in the atmospheric\ntransparency window 8\u201313 \u03bcm and zero emissivity outside the window are highly\ndemanded as they suppress the absorption from downward atmosphere thermal\nemission outside the transparency window, allowing much lower equilibrium\ntemperature^2, 37. Although it has been previously demonstrated by a few\nsimple and well-established photonic structures, including multilayer\ndielectric thin films^1, 14-17, silica sphere/polymer metamaterials^11-13,\nplasmonic metasurfaces/nanoparticles^19-21, 38, which utilize photonic\nresonances to enhance their infrared emission, the emission profiles of these\nstructures are still highly dispersive with either low emissivity or\nmismatched with the transparency window. To achieve ideal selective thermal\nemissions, complex photonic structures with multiple geometry degrees of\nfreedom and multiple photonic resonances and resonance couplings are highly\nrequired to mitigate the intrinsically highly dispersive emission nature of\nsingle photonic material.\n\nOn the other hand, the angular profile of the emissivity determines both the\nlowest steady temperature and the cooling power. In practical scenarios,\nmaintaining the radiative coolers below the ambient temperature while\nmaximizing the net cooling power is of critical importance because the\nradiative coolers exchange significant heat with surrounding environment\nthrough the non-radiative heat conductive and convection processes, such as\nthe heat conduction by physically contacting with the experimental apparatus\nor the targeted cooling objects^4. To achieve this, one needs to balance these\nexternal heating loads by widening the thermal emission angle in addition to\nthe spectrally selective bandwidth, i.e., achieve selective and\nomnidirectional thermal emitters. However, very few studies have paid\nattention to this nontrivial emission angle issue, let alone achieving highly\nselective and omnidirectional thermal emission, simultaneously.\n\nTo tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose hybrid metasurface thermal\nemitters consisting of polar dielectric materials for highly selective,\nstrongly emissive, and omnidirectional thermal emission. Hybrid metasurfaces\nare engineered planar photonic structures with complex building blocks\nfeaturing multiple physical degrees of freedom and photonic resonances^39-42,\nholding great promise in controlling the thermal emission dispersion. By\ndesigning and optimizing the geometry-dependent multiple Mie resonances by\nmachine learning inverse design, we demonstrated thermal emitters with an\nemissivity of ~0.92 across the atmospheric transparency window, ultra-high\nspectral selectivity of ~1.8 and emission angle up to 80 degrees\nsimultaneously, leading to a new record of equilibrium temperature reduction\nas large as ~15.4 \u00b0C in rooftop test, significantly surpassing the state-of-\nthe-art radiative coolers under non-vacuum conditions. The demonstrated\nradiative cooler also holds great promise for the urban heat island effect\nmitigation with modeling results suggesting a more than 50% deployment area\nreduction compared with the current radiative coolers.\n\n### Results and Discussion\n\n#### Design of hybrid polar dielectric metasurface thermal emitters\n\nThe hybrid dielectric metasurface structure is shown in Fig. 1(a), where the\nunit of the metasurface consists of alternating SiO_2 and Si_3N_4 micro-disks,\nforming a hybrid dielectric Mie resonator, which is mainly responsible for\nenhancing the thermal emission. The bottom layer of the structure is an\noptically thick Ag back reflector, which can reflect the incoming solar\nirradiation and enhance the light-mater interactions at the thermal\nwavelengths. The constituted material of the metasurface unit can also be\nother polar dielectric materials such as Al_2O_3, TiO_2, HfO_2 with phonon\npolariton resonances within the transparency window. In such a structure,\nmultiple Mie resonances can be excited to control the thermal emission\ndispersion in the infrared wavelength. Figure 1(b) illustrates the normalized\nscattering cross-section of an optimized SiO_2/Si_3N_4/SiO_2 3-layer geometry,\nalong with the electric field distributions at the resonance wavelengths.\nNotably, Mie resonances of different orders at the wavelengths of 9, 10.2 and\n12.9 \u03bcm are observed, in addition to the phonon polariton resonances at the\nwavelengths of 9.3 \u03bcm and 11.5 \u03bcm. Some of the resonances within the structure\nmight interfere with each other forming a hybridized electric field\ndistribution because of the geometrical contact between SiO_2 and Si_3N_4\nlayers.\n\nFigure 1.

(e) Emissivity, selectivity, and emission\nangle of this work, in comparison with state-of-the-art results.\n\nDownLoad: Full-Size Img PowerPoint\n\nTo optimize this complex hybrid metasurfaces with multiple degrees of freedom,\nwe employed artificial neuron network inverse design method (Fig. 1(c)), which\nallows effectively and time-efficiently inverse designing photonic structures\nwith targeted optical responses^43-47. Firstly, the neuron network is trained\nto forwardly predict the thermal emission spectra from a given set of\nstructure parameters by the sample data obtained from the finite difference\ntime domain calculations. Then the weights of the neuron network are fixed,\nand the back propagation method is used to optimize the input structure\nparameters to find the geometry that can mostly produce the ideal selective\nthermal emission. The training error graphed in Fig. S1(a) and cross-\nvalidation responses for various layer configurations in Table S1 confirm that\nthe neuron network is well established and trained. Furthermore, the tested\nforward structure-spectra prediction and inverse spectra-structure design\nshown in Fig. S1(b, c) demonstrated the accuracy of the network in\napproximating the simulation and optimizing the structure. Metasurface thermal\nemitters with different layer numbers (2, 3 & 4) are optimized, demonstrating\nhighly emissive and selective thermal emissions in all cases (Fig. S2).\nInterestingly, even a 2-layer configuration can achieve excellent selective\nthermal emission, greatly easing the practical fabrication complexity. The\noptimized selective thermal emission spectra for a 3-layer structure are shown\nin Fig. 1(d), suggesting an average thermal emissivity of ~0.92 across the\natmospheric transparency window 8\u201313 \u03bcm and a spectral selectivity of ~1.8\n(see Supplementary information for the definition). More exhilaratingly, the\nhigh emissivity and selectivity was found to remain unchanged within an\nemission angle up to 80 degrees. This is so far the first thermal emitter with\nsimultaneously high emissivity, high selectivity, and large emission angle to\nthe best of our knowledge (Fig. 1(e)).\n\n#### The fabricated thermal emitter and infrared emissivity\n\nTo experimentally demonstrate the high performance selective thermal emission,\nthe optimized 2-layer hybrid metasurfaces are fabricated on top of a 4 inches\nsilicon wafer with the bottom side coated with an optically thick Ag mirror,\nwith Fig. 2(a) showing a photography of the fabricated sample (see Methods for\ndetails of the fabrication procedures). Figure 2(b) shows the top-view and\ntilted scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of an array of the hybrid\nSiO_2/Si_3N_4 dielectric resonators, demonstrating a uniform 2D array and\nclear 2-layer structures. The measured diameter and periodicity of the\nstructures are 4.22 \u03bcm and 9.15 \u03bcm, respectively. While the thickness of the\nSiO_2 and Si_3N_4 are 6.2 \u03bcm and 1.4 \u03bcm. The energy-dispersive X-ray\nspectroscopy elemental mappings of Si, O and N in Fig. 2(c) confirms the\nconstitute material of the structure. Particularly, the element of N and O are\nobserved on the top and bottom layer of the structures, respectively,\nindicating the top Si_3N_4 and bottom SiO_2 materials. We measured the\nemissivity spectra of the structure via Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)\nspectroscopy with an unpolarized incident light beam, with the results shown\nin Fig. 2(d). Clearly, the structure exhibits high-emissivity and high-\nselectivity emission profile, agreeing very well with the theoretically\noptimized results in Fig. S2(a). The difference between the experimental and\ntheoretical results are due to the imperfect fabrication and the minor\ndielectric constant difference. The measured average emissivity can achieve\n~0.92 in the transparency window and ~0.6 among the entire range 3\u201316 \u03bcm, with\na spectral selectivity of ~1.53. The relative smooth emission profiles in the\ntransparency window are attributed to the multipolar Mie resonances and the\nmaterial intrinsic absorption properties. To further reveal this, we performed\na multipolar decomposition of the 2-layer dielectric Mie resonator. Two\nfeature peaks at 8.9 \u03bcm and 10.5 \u03bcm appear in the spectrum, corresponding to\nthe electric and magnetic dipole resonances, respectively. The electric and\nmagnetic field profiles further confirm the magnetic and electric dipole\nresonances. The resonance enhances the electric field at the wavelengths where\nthe material absorption is relatively weak and accordingly increase the total\nabsorption/emission. For example, the electric field at the wavelength of 10.5\n\u03bcm mainly concentrates at the bottom SiO_2 layer, enhancing the\nabsorption/emission of SiO_2 at this wavelength.\n\nFigure 2.

Generally, angular selective thermal emitter with an\nemission angle restricted in the zenith direction is believed to allow much\nlower equilibrium temperature because it avoids the oblique thermal radiation\nfrom the atmosphere. Indeed, the calculated net cooling power (Fig. 3(a)) of\nthe radiative cooler under zero solar absorption and zero non-radiative heat\nexchange, indicating an optimum emission angle in the zenith direction for\nlower steady temperature (see Supplementary information on the detailed\ncalculations). However, the real-world scenarios and applications involves\nunavoidable non-radiative heat exchange, i.e., heat conduction and convection,\nrequiring larger cooling power to balance these external heating loads and\nmight pose different angular constraints. Therefore, the emissivity profile\nneeds to be reconsidered and reanalyzed in real-world applications. A\ntheoretical calculation of the cooling power as a function of the temperature\nconsidering the non-radiative heat exchange (h=2 W/m^2/K) was performed with\nthe results shown in Fig. 3(b). It is demonstrated that wide-angle selective\nthermal emitter enables larger cooling power and lower equilibrium temperature\nas well under realistic conditions even with a small heat exchange coefficient\nof 2 W/m^2/K (approximately the lowest value for non-vacuum apparatus). The\nsteady temperature was also calculated with various emission angles under\ndifferent non-radiative heat exchange coefficients (Fig. 3(c)), confirming the\nsuperiority of selective and omnidirectional thermal emitters in achieving\nlower steady temperature in practical scenarios.\n\nFigure 3.

(d\u2013f) The\nangle-resolved emissivity (unpolarized, s polarized, and p polarized) of the\nmetasurface thermal emitter.\n\nDownLoad: Full-Size Img PowerPoint\n\nOur selective thermal emitters show surprisingly high-performance\nomnidirectional emission properties, with the unpolarized emissivity under\ndifferent angles shown in Fig. 3(d). The selectivity can even preserve at an\nangle up to 80 degrees without obvious emission reduction across the\ntransparency window, except a minor reduction within 40\u201360 degrees. This can\nbe attributed to the relatively weak absorption/emission of s polarized light\nat the wavelengths of 11\u201313 \u03bcm (Fig. 3(e)) because of the reduced electric\nfield distribution. Nevertheless, this does not influence the average thermal\nemission too much because of the highly emissive and selective spectral\nprofile of the p polarized thermal emission (Fig. 3(f)).\n\n#### Cooling performance of the radiative cooler\n\nTo experimentally test the radiative cooling performance of the selective and\nomnidirectional thermal emitters, a continuous outdoor measurement of the\ntemperature was performed on clear days in Shanghai, China. The schematic\ndiagram of the outdoor apparatus is shown in Fig. 4(a), where the sample is\nplaced inside a foam with low thermal conductivity to minimize the non-\nradiative heat exchange. Al foil was used to wrap the foam such that the solar\nirradiation and surrounding thermal emission is reflected to avoid heating up\nthe foam. On top of the setup, an IR transparent low-density polyethylene (PE)\nfilm was used to seal the sample preventing wind effect during the measurement\nand the thermal couple that tests the ambient temperature is located inside\nthe enclosed box of the apparatus. To increase the solar reflection, a home-\nmade nanoporous PE film was integrated on top of the sample. Figure 4(b)\npresents a real photo of the apparatus, where the pyranometer, the\nthermocouple, wind and humidity monitors are included. The solar reflection\nspectra of the nanoporous PE film and its infrared transmission are shown in\nFig. S3, respectively. The integrated device shows high solar reflection\nacross the entire solar wavelength range 0.3\u20132.5 \u03bcm, with an average solar\nreflectivity of ~95%. We performed the test on both winter and summer days. On\nthe winter day, an average temperature reduction of 10 \u00b0C was realized, with a\nmaximum temperature reduction of 14.7 \u00b0C when the sample was exposed to a\nsolar irradiation of 600\u2013650 W/m^2 at noon time (Fig. S4). On the summer day,\na higher average temperature reduction of 12.7 \u00b0C with maximum reduction of\n15.4 \u00b0C was demonstrated even the sample was exposed to much stronger solar\nirradiation of 800\u2013850 W/m^2 (Fig. 4(c\u2013e)). The demonstrated experimental\nresults are obviously superior to state-of-the-art results (Table S2).\nConsidering the potential improvement room of the solar reflection, the\ntemperature reduction can be further expected. To further elucidate the\ncooling performance of the fabricated thermal emitter, we calculated the\ncooling power as a function of the temperature reduction using the\nexperimental measured solar and emission spectra. The solar intensity and wind\nspeed are 804 W/m^2 and 0.77 m/s, respectively, corresponding to the data at\nthe maximum cooling performance of 15.4 \u00b0C. The heat exchange coefficient\nbetween the thermal emitter and the surrounding environment was calculated by\nthe equation h=2.5+2v, where v is the measured wind speed^48. It is revealed\nthe experimental maximum temperature reduction is close to the theoretical\nmaximum value 16.5 \u00b0C, demonstrating excellent performance of our metasurface\nradiative coolers.\n\nFigure 4.

(c, d) The\nsolar irradiation and environment (wind speed and relative humidity) during\nthe rooftop test. (e) Steady-state temperature of the metasurface radiative\ncooler and the ambient temperature. (f) The net cooling power of the radiative\ncooler using the experimental spectra data (solar absorbance: q=5.4%; heat\nexchange coefficient: h=4.04 W/m^2/K).\n\nDownLoad: Full-Size Img PowerPoint\n\n#### Urban heat island effect mitigation\n\nThe demonstrated selective and omnidirectional thermal emitters allow both\nlower steady temperature and larger cooling power, which is of critical\nimportance for many practical cooling applications with nontrivial external\nheating load, such as the urban heat island effect. The urbanized areas\nusually experience higher temperatures up to 6 \u00b0C than outlying areas because\nof the net heat gain in the city areas^49. Therefore, deploying radiative\ncoolers in city areas can offset this net heat gain thereby preventing or even\neliminating the urban heat island effect (Fig. 5(a)). The potential energy\nsavings and deployment areas can be calculated. Figure S5 shows the cooling\npower of our radiative cooler when exposed to an ambient temperature of 307 K\n(average summer temperature of Shanghai, China^50) under various angle\nrestriction using the simulated emission spectra. The required area for\neliminating the net heat gain by using our wide-angle radiative cooler can be\ncalculated (Fig. 5(b)). As can be seen, the deployment area by using our\nradiative cooler is significantly lower than that by current reported\nradiative coolers with an emission angle of ~60 degree. The area required to\neliminate the urban heat island effect in typical summertime for 4 big cities\nin China: Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Tianjin was further calculated using\nthe reported net heat gain data (Fig. 5(c\u2013f))^51. The results demonstrate that\nour wide-angle radiative cooler significantly reduce the deployment area by\n35%. Furthermore, when reducing the temperature to a comfortable body\ntemperature of 24 \u00b0C, the deployment area can be reduced by more than 50%.\nWith the development of scalable manufacturing technologies of metasurfaces\nand improved designs, it is believed the selective and omnidirectional thermal\nemitters will bring broad and significant impact on relieving the urban heat\nisland effect and other global warming issues.\n\nFigure 5.

This enables simultaneously lower steady\ntemperature and larger cooling power, significantly favoring the practical\napplications of radiative coolers, where non-radiative heat exchange is\nnontrivial. The experimental cooling performance breaks through the current\nstate-of-the-art temperature reduction under similar conditions, with a\nrecord-high temperature reduction of ~15.4 \u00b0C. This research will open up new\npathway and possibility to access the limitation of radiative cooling\ntechnology by using complex photonic structure assisted with machine learning\ninverse design.\n\n### Methods\n\nThermal emitter fabrication. A Si wafer was firstly cleaned by acetone,\nisopropanol, and deionized water. Then, plasmon enhanced chemical vapor\ndeposition system was used to deposit the SiO_2 and Si_3N_4 on top of the Si\nwafer. A pre-designed hard mask layer was fabricated by sputtering nickel on\ntop of the dielectric layer followed by the standard photolithography and ion\nbeam etching. Then dry etching was employed to etch the SiO_2 and Si_3N_4\nlayer. After this, the nickel mask layer was removed by chemical reactions. At\nlast, an optically thick silver layer was sputtered at the back side of the Si\nwafer with an adhesion layer of Ti.\n\nSolar reflector fabrication. The porous PE films were fabricated via phase-\ninversion-based method. In brief, PE powder, paraffin oil, butylated\nhydroxyto-luene and other additives were stirred at 150 \u00b0C for 3 h to produce\na homogenous solution. The heated solution was pushed through a sheet die to\nmake a gel-like film and stretched uniaxially. The as-formed gel was extracted\nwith cyclohexane several times and dried to obtain the porous PE films.\n\nStructure characterization. The scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Gemini SEM\n300) was used to observe morphologies of the metasurfaces and the distribution\nof elements in the hybrid elastomer was examined by energy dispersive\nspectroscope (EDS) conducted on SEM. The optical reflectance of thermal\nemitter in the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared (0.3\u20132.5 \u03bcm) wavelength\nranges were separately measured using an ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared\n(UV-Vis-NIR) spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U-4100, Japan) equipped with a\ndeuterium lamp for UV region, tungsten-halogen lamp for Vis, NIR range and a\npolytetrafluoroethylene integrating sphere. The thermal emission spectra in\nthe mid-infrared wavelength ranges (3\u201316 \u03bcm) were characterized in an FTIR\nspectrometer (INVENIOR, Bruker) equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate\ncrystal detector RT-DTGS, a gold integrating sphereA562 Integrating Sphere,\nBruker and KBr beam splitter.\n\nRooftop test. The radiative cooling performance of the sample was tested in\nJanuary 12^th and July 6^th 2022 in Shanghai (East Coast of China, 31\u00b018'22\"\nN, 121\u00b030'17\" E) under a clear sky. A thermal box was designed with insulation\nfoam covered by a layer of reflective foil, while transparent PE was used to\nseal the upper part to minimize conduction and convective heat exchange. A\nrelative humidity (RH) data logger (GSP-8, Elitech Corp, China) with an\naccuracy of \u00b10.1% RH was placed near the thermal box to measure the relative\nair humidity. A thermocouple (SA1-T-72) temperature detector was mounted on\nthe back of the sample to measure the real-time temperature, and another\nthermocouple was placed in internal air of the same thermal box (without the\nsample) to measure the ambient temperature. The solar irradiation incidence on\nthe samples was measured by solar radiometer with an accuracy of \u00b10.3%\n(MS-410, EKO). Two thermocouples, the solar radiometer, were connected to the\ndata recorder (OM-CP-OCTPRO, OMEGA) to record the data. The wind speed around\nour thermal boxes was measured using a digital anemometer with an accuracy of\n\u00b12.5% (AS856, Smart Sensor Corp, China). Wind speed and temperature were\nautomatically tracked every 30 seconds, solar illumination was recorded every\n10 minutes, and humidity was recorded every 10 seconds.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n  * This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant No. 62175154), the Shanghai Pujiang Program (20PJ1411900), the Shanghai Science and Technology Program (21ZR1445500), the Shanghai Yangfan Program (22YF1430200) and the Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning.\n\n### Author contributions\n\n  * Y.
