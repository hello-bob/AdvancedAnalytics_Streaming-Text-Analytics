Nope, say\nexperts.\n\nThe Gunung Padang megalithic site in West Java, Indonesia.

Close\nscrutiny by other experts, however, is calling that research into question.\n\nIn the paper published in Archaeological Prospection, Indonesian geologist\nDanny Hilman Natawidjaja and his fellow researchers assert that the megalithic\nsite of Gunung Padang, which consists of five terraces, was built as a pyramid\nas much as 27,000 years ago. Current estimates, in contrast, date the site to\n5,000 B.C.E., at the earliest. The authors arrived at their findings by\nconducting ground penetration radar surveys and radiocarbon dating, among\nother studies.\n\nDating the site that far back completely upends what is understood about the\nPaleolithic era, during which hunter-gatherers lived in basic huts and wielded\ncrude stone tools. It would also make the Gunung Padang far older than\nTurkey\u2019s G\u00f6bekli Tepe, a Neolithic site dotted with carved stones, some 11,000\nyears old.\n\nThe study concluded that the builders of the Gunung Padang pyramid \u201cmust have\npossessed remarkable masonry capabilities, which do not align with the\ntraditional hunter-gatherer cultures. The burial of these structures around\n9,000 years ago adds further intrigue for reasons not fully understood.\u201d\n\nNot so, say other archaeologists, who are decrying the study\u2019s findings. \u201cI\u2019m\nsurprised [the paper] was published as is,\u201d Flint Dibble, an archaeologist at\nthe U.K.\u2019s Cardiff University told Nature, which first reported on the\ncontroversy.\n\nAerial view of the Gunung Padang in the West Java Province of Indonesia.\nPhoto: DigitalGlobe via Getty Images.\n\nChief among Dibble\u2019s critiques are Natawidjaja\u2019s claims that the four stone\nlayers undergirding the Gunung Padang\u2019s terraces contained stonework that was\n\u201cmeticulously sculpted,\u201d indicating a human hand. According to the study, the\nlayers were constructed at different stages, with each subsequent one\nfeaturing \u201cregularly cut columnar rocks... arranged like bricks in a\nbuilding.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dibble questioned the paper\u2019s implication that the structure was\nbuilt using \u201csophisticated construction techniques.\u201d Speaking to Nature, he\nsaid the layers at the site could well have been the result of the natural\nmovement of rocks or weathering.\n\n\u201cMaterial rolling down a hill,\u201d he said, \u201cis going to on average orient\nitself.\u201d\n\nAnother archaeologist, Bill Farley of the Southern Connecticut State\nUniversity, also pointed out to the publication that there exists no evidence\nthat Gunung Padang was settled by an advanced civilization during the last Ice\nAge. The site\u2019s soil samples could be dated back 27,000 years, but they don\u2019t\ncontain traces of human activity, such as bone fragments.\n\nThat the paper has been proofread by Graham Hancock has not helped its\ncredibility. The British writer has long peddled unsubstantiated,\npseudoscientific theories regarding ancient civilizations, lately with his\ncontroversial 2022 Netflix docuseries, Ancient Apocalypse, in which the Gunung\nPadang features in the first episode.\n\nArchaeological Prospection has launched an investigation into the study,\naccording to Nature, though Natawidjaja himself (who has long maintained these\nclaims) welcomed the additional eyes and research on the site.\n\n\u201cWe know very little about our human history,\u201d he said.\n\nMore Trending Stories:\n\nArt Critic Jerry Saltz Gets Into an Online Skirmish With A.I.
