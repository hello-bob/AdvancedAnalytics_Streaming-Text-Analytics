While some popular opinions involve\nblaming whatever the current administration is for increases in gas prices,\nthe issue is far more complicated than any singular person or even any\nsingular government. In fact, the Energy Information Administration identifies\nfour major factors that directly correlate to the cost of gas (and none of\nthem are the president). These factors are crude oil prices (which are set by\noil-producing countries), refining costs (which are increasingly impacted by\nnatural disasters and climate change), distribution and marketing costs (which\ndepend on the individual retailer you purchase gas from), and taxes (federal,\nstate, and local taxes and fees).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor starters, you've probably heard terms like crude oil and petroleum come up\nin the gas conversation. For anyone who might not know, the gasoline we\ncurrently commercially purchase for our cars (or any other vehicle) is\nessentially a blend of crude oil and other petroleum liquids. Petroleum\nrefineries break down crude oil into various components in order to then\nreconfigure and blend them into fuel products. This refinery process is\nextremely important, with this factor comprising 14% of your per-gallon price\nat the pump. Refinery costs are impacted by demand (with summer usually the\nhighest-demand season) as well as by climate change. Since most United States\nrefineries are located along the Gulf Coast, this generally means hurricanes,\na natural disaster that can destabilize the stock market, and by extension,\nthe economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## OPEC\n\nWilliam_potter/Getty Images\n\nWhile there are four different factors that ultimately influence gasoline\nprices, the price of crude oil is far and away the biggest contributing\nfactor. In fact, according to the EIA, crude oil prices make up 54% of what\nyou end up paying per gallon at the pump. The biggest deciding body in these\ncrude oil prices is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or\nOPEC as it's more commonly referred to. OPEC is an organization composed of 13\ncountries (however, the organization is led by Saudi Arabia) that control\nroughly 60% of the world's traded petroleum supply. As a cartel, OPEC not only\ncontrols the supply of most of the world's oil but is also directly\nresponsible for regulating and, increasingly, manipulating oil prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's important to realize that even though the U.S. is the world's largest oil\nproducer, the country ultimately imports more crude oil than it exports,\nleaving prices vulnerable to the global market (which is largely controlled by\nOPEC). This means that price manipulations from OPEC heavily impact gas prices\nacross the country, and even prices depending on the day of the week (the\ncheapest day to buy gas is Monday, by the way), with the U.S. having very\nlittle power to influence those prices.\n\nIf you're wondering why the U.S. can't simply bypass OPEC for oil, it is worth\nnoting that the next highest oil-producing countries outside of the U.S. and\nOPEC are Russia and China. As international relations with both of those\ncountries continue to grow more challenging, any ability to rely on them for a\nstable oil supply is increasingly unlikely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Your individual costs\n\nLena_karpi/Shutterstock\n\nTwo of the four major factors contributing to gas prices can and do vary quite\nsignificantly at the individual level. For starters, the tax rate on gasoline\nin your specific state, county, and/or city can have a lot to do with how much\nyou might pay at the pump (the EIA estimates taxes make up 16% of what you\nultimately pay). The federal government taxes 18.4 cents on every gallon of\ngasoline while, as of July 2022, state taxes on gasoline average around 32\ncents per gallon. It's also worth mentioning that the sales tax in your local\narea can also impact your gas prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other factor depends on just what gas station you go to. You might not be\naware of this, but each individual gas station can have drastically different\nownership models. Some gas stations might be owned and operated directly by\nrefiners while others could be independent or franchise businesses that resale\npurchased gasoline directly to the public. This is important because the\ndistribution, marketing, and general retail costs associated with getting the\ngasoline to you ends up being 16% of your gasoline price. Refinery-owned\nstations might receive their product via pipeline as opposed to individually\nowned stations needing to rely on tanker trucks. Plus, smaller independent\nstations are more likely to have higher overhead costs for things like wages,\nrent, insurance, and fees. This is why two gas stations on the same street can\nhave wildly different prices, and why it can pay to know some tricks for\nsaving money on gas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Recommended\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## We Care About Your Privacy\n\nWe and our 823 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
