In exchange for connecting you to a\nfew streaming services you use, a TV will collect data, show ads, and serve as\nanother vector for bad actors. In a few reported cases, though, a modern\nconnected TV has been blamed for attacks not on privacy, eyeballs, or\npasswords but on an entirely different computer.\n\nThe TV in question is a Hisense TV, and the computer is a Windows PC,\nspecifically one belonging to Priscilla Snow, a musician and audio designer in\nMontr\u00e9al, Quebec. Her post about her Hisense experience reads like a mystery.\nOf course, because you already know the crime and the culprit, it's more like\na Columbo episode. Either way, it's thrilling in a very specific\nI-can't-believe-that-fixed-it kind of thrill.\n\n## Disappearing Settings, keyboards, remote desktops, and eventually taskbars\n\nSnow's Windows PC had \"a few hiccups over the past couple of years,\" Snow\nwrote on April 19. She couldn't open display settings, for one. A MIDI\nkeyboard interface stopped working. Task manager would start to hang until\nforce-closed. Video capture cards had trouble connecting. As Snow notes, any\nveteran of a Windows computer that has had lots of stuff installed on it can\nmentally write off most of these things, or at least stash them away until the\nnext reinstall.\n\nThen, while trying to figure out why a remote desktop session wasn't working,\nthe task bars on Snow's PC disappeared. The PC refused to launch any settings\npanels. After updating drivers and restarting the PC, the taskbars returned,\nbut only for six days. Snow hunted for solutions, and after using \"the exact\nright string in my search,\" she found a Reddit thread that led to a Microsoft\nsupport question, all describing the same kinds of seemingly spectral problems\nher computer was having over time, with no clear cause.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUser Narayan B wrote in Microsoft's forum that the issue is the Hisense TV\ngenerating \"random UUIDs for UPNP network discovery every few minutes.\"\nWindows, seemingly not knowing why any device would routinely do this, sees\nand adds those alternate Hisense devices to its Device Association Framework,\nor DAF. This service being stuffed full of attention-grabbing devices can hang\nup Task Manager, Bluetooth, the Settings apps, File Explorer, and more.\n\nThe fix is deleting hundreds of keys from the registry. Narayan B wrote that\nnoticed his Hisense TV flooding Windows' device discovery systems before but\n\"didn't think Windows would go for a toss due to this.\" Snow did the same, and\neverything\u2014Task Manager, MIDI keyboard, remote desktop, even a CRT monitor she\nhad assumed was broken\u2014started working again.\n\n## UUID, UPNP, DAF, and hundreds of Registry keys\n\nAlong with deleting hundreds of keys with maniacal keyboard pounding, Snow\nnotes in chats attached to her post that she disabled \"Set up network\nconnected devices automatically\" on her \"Private networks\" settings in\nWindows. And, of course, she recommend not buying the same Hisense 50Q8G she\nbought, or at least not having it on the same network.\n\nThe mystery is solved, but the culprit remains very much at large. Or\nculprits\u2014plural\u2014depending on how you think a Windows PC should react to a\nshapeshifting TV.\n\nArs reached out to Hisense to ask for comment and will update the post if we\nhear back.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n58\n\nKevin Purdy Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering a\nvariety of technology topics and reviewing products.
