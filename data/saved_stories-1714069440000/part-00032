They recognized two contemporary states of affairs that our nation\nis engulfed in, but their comments received insufficient attention. In this\nanalysis, I demonstrate that when considered in conjunction with other\ncontemporary global trends, the problems underlined by these personalities are\nactually far more serious matters that merit our careful examination. This\narticle is all about explicating that.\n\nNote: I am not fans of any of their former political accomplishments, nor do I\nsupport their present political endeavors. Our interest in reflecting on their\nviews only arose when we crossed on some matters that, given our position of\nexpertise and experience, I believe, are interesting to comment on.\n\nStarter\n\nIn the interview with Simeneh (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV0F2cqd5RA,\nlisten to 00:00 \u2013 00:10), Ato Getachew presents a version of himself as a\nvictim of the new \u201cculture of likes\u201d by alleging that most of his statements\nfrom the two-years conflict (betWEen the TPLF and the federal government) Ire\ndistorted and that the majority of his speeches Ire amplified on social media\nat an astronomical rate. By emphasizing his personal experience, he bitterly\nreveals that social media is controlled by vice ontology supported by people\u2019s\ngullibility. Furthermore, he underlined the role emotion plays in the spread\nof socially and ethically extreme voices, particularly at times of political\nupheavals. According to him, political contents with thin fictional and\nsensationalized material are more likely to garner attention and, as a result,\nare more likely to show \u2018superlative bias\u2019 to use what Merlyna Lim\u2019s\nexpressions (2018). He also talked on how emotion, and fake news play a part\nin normalizing the abnormal, undermining institutional and societal trust, and\nkindling more animosity and incitement of violence in the political economy of\nsocial crises in general and total war in particular.\n\nIn a very similar vein, remarking on the historical curvatures that the now\nEthiopian generation is living under and how to produce one that can fix and\nheal Ethiopia\u2019s all-round problems, Prof Birhanu Nega, in an opening statement\non \u12a0\u12f2\u1235 \u12c8\u130d (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMnBhDUoP-Q, listen to his speech\nfrom 00:00 \u2013 00:18 and 00:52 \u2013 60:00), an elite level dialogue on \u2018\u12e8\u1218\u12f0\u1218\u122d \u1275\u12cd\u120d\u12f5\n\u1218\u1245\u1228\u133d\u2019, inspired after Dr Abiy Ahmed\u2019s recent book title, highlights very\ninteresting trend in the contemporary Ethiopia. After citing the three obvious\nsources of knowledge\u2014the family and the local community, the church, and the\nschool\u2014he had every right to forget about the media, Prof Birhanu continues to\nmake observations about the metacognitive underpinnings of Ethiopian culture,\nand he transitions to a transcendental thought when he says, \u201ctruths and fakes\nare muddled today, and Ethiopians are at a paradigmatic crossroads\u201d. He\ndescribes Ethiopians as extremely sensitive individuals who frequently form\nflash mobs that are driven by emotions. He claims that this would ultimately\nresult in a discrepancy in how we view both nature and other human beings.\nDistilling his annoyance into a single assertion, as he repeatedly claimed,\nEthiopia is in a historical timeline with impatient generations that are\nunable to trust one another.\n\nWhat More Questions Might One Inquire?\n\nIt could be challenging to describe or comment on the general behavior of the\ncurrent Ethiopian generation. To be capable of doing that or to have the\nauthority, one must be as bold or as ignorant as is conceivable. However,\nputting their utterances in one check box, it brings out important questions\nsuch as how can Ethiopia stand out these challenges and form its new political\nmass? What moral foundations and virtues should be activated to move forward\nwith its present and new generations? Will the ideological and philosophical\nprospects braced in Dr Abiy\u2019s \u2018Medemer\u2019 book series bring momentum to people\u2019s\nown enforcement? Or are we looking for a new generation composed of obedient\nsubjects, or are we seeking one that can move forward with the investable\ntechnological changes in this era of attention economy? Like I said, it would\nbe hardly possible to discern about the entire generation, but I suppose that\nmany of us are equally perplexed by those questions, and we would love to know\nthe answers to them. Both Ato Getachew Reda and Prof Birhanu Nega are too\nclose to recognize the already felt impacts of the late capitalist culture and\nthe subsequent global retrogressions, such as democratic recessions, network\ncrises, information disorder, and to add more, the rise of \u2018fascist-lit\u2019\npopulist leaders and political masses worldwide. Anyway, in this piece, I will\nprovide a conceptual framework for what they highlighted as key problems our\nnation is currently confronting. Doing so, I remain optimistic in terms of\nsparking an urge for proposals for possible resolutions to fix back those\nsocietal retrogressions, however, a part of me is still skeptical as genuine\ntransformation comes from pride and a sense of patriotism.\n\nLooking at the Issues Through a Microscopic Lens\n\nI am framing Ethiopia within the context of late capitalism culture not solely\ndue to Ethiopia\u2019s political economy, but rather due to its susceptibility to\nthe impact of a mixture of other factors including network crises enhanced by\ntechnological advancements such as the internet and smartphones, which are\nlargely controlled by major international tech companies. Also known as\n\u2018algorithmic capitalism,\u2019 \u2018digital capitalism,\u2019 \u2018information capitalism,\u2019 and\n\u2018surveillance capitalism,\u2019 the fundamental characteristics of late capitalist\nculture are its \u201cabsurdities, contradictions, crises, injustices, inequality,\nand exploitation created by modern business development\u201d (Matthew, 2019). In\nthe context of the late capitalist culture, we do not need to deal with the\n\u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfalsity\u201d of what politicians say or think, except simply\nsubscribing to the multimodality of truth and knowledge productions that has\neventually caused an urge to produce and disseminate more political\ninformation and its subsequent overabundance \u2013 be factual or nonfactual \u2013\nsadly, welcome to the age of information disorder (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017).\n\nAs we transverse through this historical timeline, the following two facts\nstand out.\n\na) The world is already readily open-ended honed by a sense of immediacy and\ntechnical turning points\n\nFrom a scientific perspective, the concept of \u2018open-endedness\u2019 is related to\nthe idea of complexity and emergent phenomena, where complex systems can\nexhibit surprising or unpredictable behavior that cannot be fully predicted or\ncontrolled. The idea of the world as open-ended provides a framework for\nembracing uncertainty and unpredictability, and recognizing the potential for\ngrowth, change, and transformation in the face of an ever-evolving world.\nMatter-of-factly, the concept also suggests that there is no predetermined or\nfixed outcome to events or situations. Instead, the world is seen as open and\nuncertain, with multiple possibilities and potential outcomes. This concept is\noften associated with the philosophy of existentialism, but the focus here is\nthe heavy-burdened individual lurking around in an uncertain and unpredictable\nworld.\n\nOne of the key drivers of the world of openness is technology, particularly\nsmartphones and the internet, which has made it easier than ever for people to\nconnect and share information across geographic and cultural boundaries. Now,\nthe format of communication has become \u201cautonomous,\u201d \u201cmany to many,\u201d and a\n\u201cmultimodal\u201d flow of messages, thanks to the digital revolution, disruptive\ntechnologies, and media convergence (Castells, 2012, p.67). These revolutions\nin communication technologies have created the possibilities of removing or\nreducing the distance between individuals, ideas, or cultures that, in the\ncontext of digital technologies and the internet, have enabled new forms of\nimmediate, real-time communication and interaction. More specifically, on\nsocial media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, an immeasurable amount of\ninformation can easily be accessed at the speed of light to wider and even\nmore varied audiences (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017).\n\nEven though communication technologies tend to disperse ideas and culture,\nreal time events such as armed conflict or pressing political issues create a\nsense of \u2018immedition\u2019 that recollects individuals and their attentions around\na certain expressed emotion. Immediacy can be a powerful tool for building or\nstrengthening connections and creating a sense of community, as it allows\npeople to feel as though they are part of something larger than themselves.\nAdditionally, immediacy can help to create a sense of urgency and importance\naround certain issues, such as armed conflicts and civil wars, which can make\nit easier to mobilize people around a particular cause or event. However,\nthere are also potential downsides to immediacy. For example, it can create a\nsense of pressure to constantly be \u201cplugged in\u201d or connected, and an\ninvestment of our affective self, which can be exhausting and overwhelming.\nAdditionally, the drive for immediacy can sometimes come at the expense of\nmore thoughtful and reflective engagement with the world around us, risking us\nto develop a myopic vision.\n\nPlease, take note that concerns over the accuracy and dependability of\ninformation are raised by the notions of immediacy and open-endedness of the\nworld, as well as the possibility that the logic of digital media exacerbates\nprejudices, misconceptions, racism, or vigilantism. Today, mobile reporters,\ncitizen journalists, political pundits, influencers, political satirists,\nconspiracy theorists, digital armies and others have already imbricated\nthemselves into the industry of \u201csending breaking news updates, teasers for\nfeature stories, and commentary on the events of the day\u201d (Crawford, 2011,\np.116). Many people think that openness is a key force for progress and change\nin the modern world since the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\nImmediacy, however, often comes at the expense of a more deliberate and\nreflective engagement with the world around us. When one considers the\nintensities of ethnic tensions, political polarizations, as well as the\nresulting outbreaks of violence and armed conflicts in our country, it takes\nno effort to recognize the associated dangers.\n\nb) One truth but binary knowledge modalities\n\nAlthough modalising is inherent to humans, it also implies diverse ways of\nacquiring knowledge and understanding of the world. From our own experience,\nthere are several types of knowledge modalities, such as science, culture,\nreligion, and experience. Modality represents the innate inquisitiveness to\nexplore, articulate, and comprehend the world around us, as manifested through\nour everyday activities of decoding, conjecturing, speculating, or\nrationalizing our experiences and actions. To modalize means to exercise the\nmodal power to make a moral judgment.\n\nIt is to be remembered that social media platforms, as modal tools, enrich\ncommunication by adding layers of meaning and expression. They provide various\nfeatures like \u2018likes,\u2019 \u2018sharing,\u2019 \u2018commenting\u2019 \u2018imogies,\u2019 \u2018adding,\u2019 \u2018blocking\u2019\n... etc. which enhance our ability to express our modal knowledge and\njudgements. These features also allow our immediate reactions and judgments,\nreflecting a user\u2019s attitude or stance towards a certain content and persons.\n\nThis has significantly changed the fundamental nature of truth from what was\nformerly seen to be clear-cut and straightforward to what is now thought to be\nconvoluted and perplexing, as per Julian Baggini\u2019s (2017) analysis of the\nevolution of truth. Furthermore, the ability to tell the truth has been\ntransferred from established authorities like the media, schools, and religion\nto individuals and agents who are frequently referred to as citizen\njournalists, conspiracy theorists, activists, social influencers, and citizen\njournals. Therefore, \u2018truth\u2019 is at elevated risk of being concealed,\ndistorted, abused, or twisted. Such a sense of unpredictability also\nencourages people to rely on their intuition or gut feelings to guide them\nnavigate through voluminous information and data, which otherwise will be\noverwhelming to process and analyze it all. In the context of academia, the\nexistence of multimodality of facts and knowledge is commonly discussed in\nrelation to the notion of \u2018postmodernism,\u2019 whereas in politics, it is often\ndiscussed along with a periodizing concept called \u2018post-truth politics\u2019.\n\nDeep Dive into the Topic: Trendy Global Concerns\n\nIf we could look at the entirety of the world through our window\u2019s framework,\nit would not take us too long to realize that we are witnessing the most\ntroubled world with amorphous political polarizations accompanied by\ngeopolitical shifts, the rise of dictatorships, transnational conflicts,\nmassacres, and grave human rights violations. These trends are shaping the\ninternational political landscape and are influencing national policies and\nrelations, also shaping the local contexts and development.\n\nThe concepts that I will discuss in this section is driven by the need to\nhighlight a more informed and balanced approach to navigate the crux of\ntechnology and politics, particularly in a highly \u2018risked\u2019 societies like\nEthiopians who are highly socially divided and are suffering from a strenuous\ninter-ethnic relations and a recurring violence. It is always my standpoint\nthat we do not live on an isolated island, untouched by the stifling air of\nglobal political and technological undercurrents. However, one cannot be\nmistaken to announce that \u201cwe live globally but suffer locally\u201d.\n\na) Techlash checked by network crises\n\nWhile digital technologies and virtual interactions can provide many benefits,\nsuch as increasing access to information and boosting our modal powers, it\nalso comes with anti-social traces. These include the frustrating order of\nlife powered by \u2018data-centric\u2019 or algorithmically powered ways of being\n(feeling, interacting, and being in every aspect of our lives). This is\nprimarily serving as a business model for techno-commercial regimes\n(transnational communication and digital corporations) competing for economic\nexploitation of users\u2019 personal information and emotional states (Ricaurte,\n2019). Reports show that internet companies are prioritizing money over the\nwelfare of their consumers and that they have not done enough or ignored the\npossibilities to tackle these issues such as hate speech and misinformation.\n\nBring here the African experience in terms of appropriating the gift of social\nmedia for their political gains, in most cases, turning themselves into being\nghost dictators. Take the case of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s (CA) Facebook testing\nin the 2015 Nigerian and 2017 Kenyan elections, many other cases of social\nmedia manipulations- in Uganda and Ethiopia where tactics involving fake news,\nhate speech and propaganda have become a commonplace. Surveillance and\ncensorship, social media manipulations, heavy-handed antisocial media laws,\nand targeted prosecution are also blooming.\n\nb) The emergence of a \u2018spectral society\u2019 escorted by temporal disjuncture\n\nThe term \u201cspectral society\u201d can be used to describe a society that is\ncharacterized by a sense of fragmentation and disconnection, where people feel\nisolated from each other and from the world around them. This can be due to a\nvariety of factors, including the impact of technology on social interactions,\nincreased individualism, lack of social cohesion, or political subordination\nand conflict. A spectral society may see themselves as disconnected from\nlarger social structures and institutions and may be swamped by a sense of\nalienation or dislocation.\n\nToday we live in a media regime where the private and the public sphere, the\npolitical and apolitical subjects, the sacred and the profane, taboos and\nhabitual actions are deluged. More agonizingly, social media has blurred the\nboundaries between the past and the present, the leaders and the commoners,\nand has altered numerous other vital aspects of people\u2019s life, like loving,\nhating, forgetting, remembering, forgiving, revenging etc. The last idea is\nparticularly important because of the conflict and post-conflict conditions\nthat our nation is currently going through. For example, it has become\nallegedly difficult to distinguish between old and new contents on social\nmedia, particularly in the current context of ethnic conflict, polarizations,\nand expanding political marketplaces. This can lead to a distorted sense of\ntime, as users are exposed to a constant stream of information without the\nnecessary context to understand how it fits into the broader historical\nnarrative. Additionally, social media has made it easier for individuals and\ngroups to revise or reinterpret historical events, often in ways that reflect\ntheir own ideological or political standpoints.\n\nExperts in hauntology, post-trauma studies, and spectral anthropology will\nundoubtedly fully understand what I am presenting here. It would be laborious\nto go over each of these fields individually, but in the most anthropological\nsense, hauntology simply deals with \u201d societies in which a history of violence\nhaunts the present in significant ways. The distant past has become extremely\nclose to us, to our saloons, workplaces, and virtually to wherever our phones\nmight be, and because of digital media. As the first socially mediated\nconflict was experienced by all of us (Ethiopians), whether it was at home, at\nthe battlefield, in the media, or in any other settings, the past and the\nreminiscent of the war continues to haunt our lives now and perhaps even into\nthe future. Both the spirit of the battle and the soul of the dead bodies\n(digital leftovers) we have met on social media over the past two years will\nremain present in our memories.\n\nHow they Interplay in Ethiopia\n\nI have no doubt that you have repeatedly asked yourself what message I wanted\nto convey in our writing up to this point. I understand that I have not given\nyou a complete answer to your question, but I believe that I may have shared\nsome important theoretical knowledge with you as a starting point for our\nanswer. If so, I humbly invite you to pay close attention to the next\nthoughts. If you wish to know what I mean by affect, I prescribe you to go and\nread its concise meanings on Tibebu\u2019s previous piece (shared link here:\nhttps://borkena.com/2023/12/22/how-ethiopias-pm-d-abiy-ahmed-used-affective-\nenergies-to-achieve-his-political-aspirations-as-a-charming-dictator/).\n\nRemembering the Tigray War as a Textbook Example\n\nThe Tigray war illustrates the global openness and modalities of war, showing\nthe new logic of armed war followed by information wars on Facebook and\nTwitter campaigns, and street demonstrations orchestrated by pro-government\nand pro-Tigrayan activists\u2019 groups.\n\nFirst, the Tigray war can be taken as a case of \u2018total war\u2019 in an open-ended\nworld. Total war has been defined as \u201ca war that is unrestricted in terms of\nthe weapons deployed, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives\npursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\u201d(Oxford\nReference). In this war, virtually, people from military to civilians, men to\nwomen, elders to children, spiritual fathers to their disciples Ire all\nmobilized; weapons from drones to jets, tanks to tucks, snipers to rifles,\ncannons to grenades, mutilations to rapes have been leveraged; places from\nchurches to schools, trenches to market places, war front to living saloons\nIre all targeted; crimes from total siege to hunger, sexual violence to war\nrape, extrajudicial killings of civilians to using civilians as human shields,\nand from widespread looting to destruction of civilian infrastructure Ire all\nperpetuated.\n\nSecond, the war has been followed by a fierce information battle between pro-\ngovernment and pro-Tigray activists. Both sides have been employing various\ntactics to shape public opinion and influence global understandings of the\nconflict. These included spreading their narratives through social media, news\noutlets, and online platforms using different tactics often amplifying their\nown perspectives while discrediting the opposing side. Additionally, street\ndemonstrations surrounding the Tigray war have been characterized by two\nprominent movements: \u2018#Nomore\u2019 and \u2018#KnowMore.\u2019 The #Nomore movement is Pro\nGovernment activist group who aim to shed light on the underlying causes and\nhistorical context of the conflict, urging prominent Western media and\ngovernments to refrain from their intervention, \u201cin terms of backing TPLF\u201d\nand/or \u201cundergoing their proxy war,\u201d during the war. On the other hand, the\n#KnowMore, a pro-Tigrayans counter movement, aimed to shed light on the\nunderlying causes and historical context of the conflict, urging people to\nseek a deeper understanding of the complexities involved.\n\nFurthermore, the war has spilled over into the realm of Twitter, where\nbattling campaigns such as \u2018#StopTigrayGenocide\u2019 and \u2018#CallThemTerrorists\u2019\nhave thrived. These hashtags highlight the divergent perspectives on the\nconflict. #StopTigrayGenocide campaign organized by Pro-Tigrayans draws\nattention to alleged human rights abuses and calls for international\nintervention, while #CallThemTerrorists organized by pro-government activists\nframe the actions of TPLF involved in the conflict as acts of terrorism,\nlooking to garner support for a stronger response against them. It is\nimportant to recognize that the Tigray war encompasses many perspectives and\nnarratives.\n\nConsidering all these phenomena, the war embodies affective polarization\nbetween two binary poles, i.e., Pro Government and pro-Tigrayans, signifying a\nsituation where lack of understanding, empathy, and cooperation among these\ngroups bloomed. The simple fact that binary poles exist denotes that there is\nhighly likely binary modalization surrounding a specific event\u2014i.e.,\neverything and anything related to the Tigray War. The formation of such\ngroupings is driven by a compulsive force in a spectral society, where\nindividuals feel disconnected or alienated from the broader culture or\nidentity frameworks but seek out communities or groups that share similar\nbeliefs or ideologies. In social media terms, I am referring to the formation\nof echo-chambers, where individuals are exposed primarily to information and\nviewpoints that confirm their pre-existing beliefs. As a result, they may\nbecome less open to alternative perspectives and more prone to developing\nbiased views. This means that when people become skeptical of the reliability\nof their older sources of information, they turn to their immediate networks\nfor information and support, which can reinforce existing biases and create an\n\u201cus versus them\u201d mentality. In such situations, it becomes challenging to\nestablish a shared understanding of truth across diverse groups.\n\nThe Tigray war portrays a scenario when a spectral society is combined with\ntechlash where people feel disconnected or alienated from their old-seated\nculture or identity fabrics. It is important to note that these dynamics are\ncomplex and multifaceted, and the impact can vary depending on the specific\ncontext and factors at play. In our case, I am taking the deep-rooted\nethnopolitics that culminated in the breaking of war between the TPLF sprinter\ngroup and the federal government. In the context of ethnic conflict, the\naffective atmosphere of a society can be influenced, creating a condition of\naffective polarizations. Social networks formed within a polarized network\nplay a crucial role in shaping member\u2019s attitudes, beliefs, and interactions,\nbut it can also lead to a lack of understanding, empathy, and cooperation\namong different ethnic groups, creating a hostile and tense environment. I can\nthus understand Getachew Reda\u2019s remark in line with this situation. For the\nobvious reasons that emotionally and politically loaded contents, particularly\nthose that glorifies the ingroups and belittles or incriminates the \u2018other,\u2019\nare more likely to garner attention and more likes.\n\nThe combination of spectral society and network crises does not end there just\ncreating \u201cus versus them\u201d dichotomy. The combination will even be cruel when\nit exacerbates a feeling of anxiety, fear, and a sense of not belonging. The\ndeterioration of social fabrics (community bonds, trust, and cooperation) also\nsignifies the breakdown of the infrastructures of truth (schools, community,\nreligions, and the media). The implications of this destruction lead to\nincreased distrust among the people. This is what happened during the Tigray\nwar when the social fabrics Are undermined by propaganda, displacement, and\nviolence, when religious fathers blessed their disciples to join the conflict,\nwhen schools become both the military stations and targets of the war, and\nwhen the media is only used to spread of fear and confusion. All these factors\ncombined create a condition, what Prof Birhanu Nega referred to as a\n\u2018paradigmatic bend\u2019 in the social life of Ethiopians. Of course, war has\nsignificantly changed the way people interact, trust, and view the world\naround them, temporarily or forever.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis article\u2019s main goal was to clarify the critical issues that Ethiopians\nare currently facing as highlighted by Ato Getachew Reda and Birhanu Nega\n(Prof). As I guided you through other contemporary global trends that are\nobstructing the development of a peaceful political mass, I should that the\nissues demand careful considerations and urgency to address them. Important\nquestions like \u201chow can Ethiopia stand out these challenges and form its new\npolitical mass\u201d have not been answered despite the discussions. Given the\ndynamics of ongoing ethnopolitics, where conspiracy and arbitrary killings are\nrife, one must be as ignorant as possible to bid for a solution that crushes\nthose problems. However, note that tackling these issues will require us to\nfollow a comprehensive strategy, such as fostering inclusive dialogue,\nadvancing digital literacy, creating robust social networks to support\ncompassion, and understanding, and may be tweaking the constitution.\n\nEditor\u2019s note : Views in the article do not necessarily reflect the views of\nborkena.com\n\n__\n\nTo Publish an Article On borkena , please send submission to info@borkena.com\nfor consideration.\n\nJoin our Telegram Channel : t.me/borkena\n\nLike borkena on Facebook\n\nAdd your business to Borkena Business Listing/Business Directory Jobs\n\nJoin the conversation.
