While the foundation board was\nnever intended to lead the community 22, we cannot deny that it is perceived\nto be in that role by many, and we therefore take full accountability. We\nacknowledge there\u2019s been a series of recent crises in our community, which are\nrelated to issues with communication, leadership, moderation, representation,\nand decision making power. The purpose of this document is to take drastic\nsteps: to announce a transition of power as a first step toward addressing\nthose issues.\n\nThe foundation board and many members of the community have spent the past 10\ndays in close contact with each other, deliberating to understand the root\ncauses and working together to define what to do about the situation. So, to\nyou, it may have appeared that nothing was happening in the meantime. We wish\nwe\u2019d reached out publicly sooner, but we did not manage to, for the same\nreasons described in this statement.\n\n## Eelco steps down from the board\n\nEelco is the principal author of Nix and undoubtedly a central figure in the\necosystem that grew around it. We confirm that Eelco showed no intention to be\nperceived as or act like the BDFL of the Nix ecosystem, or the Nix code base.\nTo commit to that in a timely manner, he has decided to formally step down\nfrom the board. This decision was made amicably and in mutual agreement with\nthe board that this is the right thing to do. Our collaboration was always\ncharacterised by our deep respect for Eelco\u2019s work and our awareness of his\nlasting impact on our lives.\n\nWe will ensure an orderly transition of responsibilities, which needs to\nhappen in a thoughtful manner. We will coordinate the process on the\nfoundation board\u2019s issue tracker 23.\n\n## Community-based governance\n\nWe fully understand that at this scale, a healthy open source project is one\nwhere it is clear and transparent how decisions are made and how to\nparticipate in making them.\n\nThis isn\u2019t how it works today. Right now, part of our role is to be arbiter in\ncase of conflicts 9, which we assume, among many other reasons, creates the\nperception and effectively puts us in a position of ultimate decision-making\npower on community issues. We don\u2019t want that to be the case, we\u2019re not set up\nfor it at the moment. We want to fix that and exercise our power, by\nexplicitly giving it to you, the community.\n\nWe will appoint a constitutional assembly 37 within the next 14 days. Its task\nwill be to set up a new governance structure, run by the community, that is\ncapable of serving the community\u2019s needs. Once established, we will delegate\nour power to institutions 21 within that new structure. This entire process\nwill take place in a public space, such that it\u2019s traceable for anyone\nconcerned. We are committed to listening to everyone who may help with solving\nthe problems the community is facing.\n\nWe envision that the new governance structure, which is to be created by the\nconstitutional assembly, will be fully empowered to handle various issues\nincluding but not limited to:\n\n  * Conflicts of interest policy\n  * Sponsorship policy\n  * Moderation\n  * Protecting minorities\n\nWe will post more details on Discourse as we go.\n\n## How you can help\n\nTo discuss actionable, constructive suggestions on shaping the future of our\ncommunity, please refer to the NixOS Foundation Discourse category 17.\n\nWe are also seeking input from people who have experience with open source\ncommunity building, governance, or non-profits.\n\nSigned,\n\n  * @edolstra\n  * @ron\n  * @zimbatm\n  * @thufschmitt\n\nFurthermore, we want to thank the community members who have helped putting\nthis together:\n\n  * @infinisil (Silvan Mosberger)\n  * @fricklerhandwerk (Valentin Gagarin)\n  * @raitobezarius (Ryan Lahfa)\n  * @Within (Xe Iaso)\n  * @nbp (Nicolas B.

I know Eelco has always wanted Nix to be\ncommunity-governed, and am excited to see where this goes.\n\njakehamilton\n\n2h\n\nThis is an excellent response, thank you for the countless hours and\nconversations this likely took. As well, for Eelco to step down is a large\nchange for him and I would like to thank him directly for placing his trust in\nthe Nix community that have rallied around his invention.\n\nOne concern I have for the coming process is how dealing with bad-faith actors\nwill be managed. The specific events listed here are delicate and if they go\nthe same way as prior Code of Conduct establishment attempts went then the\ncommunity may not get to the point it needs to in order to remain healthy.\n\nEricson2314\n\n1h\n\n> One concern I have for the coming process is how dealing with bad-faith\n> actors will be managed.\n\nI don\u2019t think it possible to know that in advance for something that is as\nfoundational as a constitutional assembly.\n\nThe truth is that one can be really sure how the next phase will turn out \u2014\ngetting community governance right will require great patience and optimism,\nwhich is rather a shift from the \u201cenough is enough\u201d mentality that was just as\nnecessary to bring our long-boiling community disagreements to a head and\nforce these conversations.\n\nI can only hope that everyone can have a better, more relaxed next few days,\nand when we convene, we finally get this stuff right :).\n\nAshleyYakeley\n\n1h\n\nWill Eelco continue to lead the Nix team 19?\n\nEricson2314\n\n1h\n\n@AshleyYakeley The Nix team, not the board, will provide a statement answering\nsuch questions soon.\n\nIt is my personal view as a Nix Team member that:\n\n  * @edolstra should remain on the Nix team. There is nothing in my view he has done as a Nix team member to warrant his removal from the Nix team. The above documented pointed out that he is not is not interested in the administrativa that is the board\u2019s job, but that he is interested in the engineering work that is co-maintaining the Nix code base. I would be sad and consider it unfair if he left the Nix team.\n\n  * The website saying he is the \u201cteam lead\u201d is effectively a mistake \u2014 the team operates in an egalitarian manner with no one member above the others. I am fine if Eelco remains the \u201cceremonial\u201d team leader. I am equally fine if the team officially does not have a leader.\n\n  * In some contexts Eelco may have been treated as the BFDL, against his wishes. In the Nix Team meetings, we have not made that mistake. We treated him as \u201cjust\u201d another team member, and he never expressed any dissatisfaction with this agreement.\n\nVulNix\n\njakehamilton\n\n1h\n\n> One concern I have for the coming process is how dealing with bad-faith\n> actors will be managed\n\nOne concern I have is if any solutions to this issue will be used to shut down\ndisagreement with the new power structure that gets put in place. The concept\nof bad-faith engagement, while valid, ultimately depends on assessing the\ninternal mental state of the other person, what their intentions are, and\ndisagreements make assuming pure hostility much more likely.\n\nInfinisil\n\nAshleyYakeley\n\n1h\n\nSince the new governance structure will be on top of the teams, they\u2019ll\nactually be able to make arbitrary team changes, including removing members\nfrom it!\n\nRegarding the \u201cNix team\u201d title, I just opened a PR to fix the website: Fix\nEelco's Nix team title by infinisil \u00b7 Pull Request #1410 \u00b7 NixOS/nixos-\nhomepage \u00b7 GitHub 19\n\nsamrose\n\n1h\n\nVulNix:\n\n> One concern I have is if any solutions to this issue will be used to shut\n> down disagreement with the new power structure that gets put in place.

But demonstrating that you are trying to be\nresponsible for defusing and avoiding conflict, and trying to offer\nconstructive dialogue is more feasible to qualify.\n\nroberthGreat contributor\n\nAshleyYakeley\n\n1h\n\nI did not consider Eelco to have a formally different position within the Nix\nteam, and I believe the \u201cTeam lead\u201d label might have been added to conform\nwith the other team pages, and too little thought was put into that.\n\nI\u2019d like him to stay on the team, perhaps relevant here is my post about my\nperspective 7 as a Nix team member last week.\n\nEDIT: And of course I\u2019ll respect what the community wants through the new\ngovernance structure.\n\nEricson2314\n\n1h\n\nInfinisil:\n\n> Since the new governance structure will be on top of the teams, they\u2019ll\n> actually be able to make arbitrary team changes, including removing members\n> from it!\n\nYes, that is true. The Nix team could vote to keep Eelco in all roles, and the\nnew governance structure could vote to overrule the team on this.\n\nAs I stated above, I strongly hope this does not happen, but I do feel\ncompelled to go on the record agreeing that is technically possible. Were the\nnew governance structure to not have the capability of booting other teams\u2019\nmembers, it would not be strong body we intend it to be.\n\njakehamilton\n\n1h\n\nMy advice for the Nix ecosystem would be to look to Kubernetes for examples in\nhow to manage a project and its community. The operational structures\nrequired, the groups responsible for particular domains, and inter-group\ncollaborations are all well defined and organized. Many, if not all, of these\nconcepts map directly to Nix and can be adopted.\n\nIvanMalison\n\n1h\n\nedolstra:\n\n> We will appoint a constitutional assembly within the next 14 days.\n\nIs the \u201cwe\u201d here is the current board? What will be the criteria used for\nselecting representatives?\n\nWill the current moderation team be moderating the proceedings?\n\nEricson2314\n\n1h\n\nIvanMalison:\n\n> Is the \u201cwe\u201d here is the current board? What will be the criteria used for\n> selecting representatives?\n>\n> Will the current moderation team be moderating the proceedings?\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer to the questions, nor would I expect anyone else to\nknow them. The next 14 days exist to figure whatever needs to be figured out\nto get this process started.\n\nInfinisil\n\n43m\n\nJust a brief note here for context: The foundation board was in a meeting with\ncommunity members for about 9 straight hours until 2:30 at night (for\nEuropeans) to get to this point. I\u2019d like to applaud such dedication by all\ninvolved towards making this important step in the community!\n\nAnd with that, I\u2019m gonna try to get some sleep!\n\ndedguy21\n\n42m\n\n>   * Protecting minorities\n>\n\nI am curious about what we are protecting them from, maybe I missed a verbal\nassault thread?\n\nBut I hope we do not think it is considered protecting minorities by not being\nable to push back on a person who happens to be a minority when it comes to\nmatters of policy that affect the distro, code, and community that we may not\nagree with.\n\nI don\u2019t want anyone being personally attacked for who they are as a person,\nbut matters of opinion should be able to be debated and pushed back on\nregardless of who a person is, minority or not.\n\nWe need to tread carefully here.\n\nsamrose\n\n40m\n\nI do hope that @edolstra will remain part of the nix team.\n\nwinter\n\n40m\n\ndedguy21:\n\n> But I hope we do not think it is considered protecting minorities by not\n> being able to push back on a person who happens to be a minority when it\n> comes to matters of policy that affect the distro, code, and community that\n> we may not agree with.\n\nNo, of course not.
