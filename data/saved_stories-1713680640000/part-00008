Marko Djurica/Reuters\n\nSix charts illustrate the extraordinary level of support the United States has\nprovided Ukraine in its war against Russian invaders.\n\nArticle by Jonathan Masters and Will Merrow\n\nLast updated February 23, 2024 9:00 am (EST)\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman carries an artillery shell. Marko Djurica/Reuters\n\nArticle\n\n    Current political and economic issues succinctly explained.\n\nEvery year, the United States sends billions of dollars in aid\u2014and much more\nthan any other country\u2014to beneficiaries around the world in pursuit of its\nsecurity, economic, and humanitarian interests.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has become far and away the\ntop recipient of U.S. foreign aid. This marks the first time that a European\ncountry has held the top spot since the Harry S. Truman administration\ndirected vast sums into rebuilding the continent through the Marshall Plan\nafter World War II.\n\nMore on:\n\nUkraine\n\nForeign Aid\n\nUnited States\n\nMilitary Operations\n\nThe Joe Biden administration and the U.S. Congress have directed about $75\nbillion in assistance to Ukraine, which includes humanitarian, financial, and\nmilitary support, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a\nGerman research institute. (This figure does not include all war-related U.S.\nspending, such as aid to allies.) The historic sums are helping a broad set of\nUkrainian people and institutions, including refugees, law enforcement, and\nindependent radio broadcasters, though most of the aid has been military-\nrelated. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), are also\nproviding large aid packages to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the flow of U.S. aid to Ukraine looked uncertain in early 2024 as new\nfunding legislation remained stalled in Congress. Meanwhile, EU leaders have\nagreed to provide Ukraine another 50 billion euros in multiyear financial\nsupport after overcoming opposition from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor\nOrb\u00e1n.\n\nJust How Much Aid Has the U.S. Sent to Ukraine?\n\nBilateral aid committed to Ukraine between January 24, 2022, and January 15,\n2024\n\nTotal: $74.3 billion\n\nHumanitarian\n\n$1.6 billion (2%)\n\nEmergency food assistance, health care, refugee support, and other\nhumanitarian aid\n\nFinancial\n\n$26.4 billion (35%)\n\nBudgetary aid through the Economic Support Fund, loans, and other financial\nsupport\n\nSecurity assistance\n\n$18.3 billion (25%)\n\nTraining, equipment, weapons, logistics support, and other assistance provided\nthrough the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative\n\nTotal military\n\n$46.3 billion (62%)\n\nWeapons and equipment\n\n$23.5 billion (32%)\n\nWeapons and equipment from Defense Department stocks, provided through\npresidential drawdowns\n\nGrants and loans for weapons\n\nand equipment\n\n$4.5 billion (6%)\n\nGrants and loans provided through the Foreign Military Financing program\n\nNotes: Aid has primarily been provided through appropriations bills.

The data source revised the\n\nhumanitarian amount down to $1.6B from the $2.7B\n\namount included in an earlier data release.\n\nSource: Antezza et al., Ukraine Support Tracker, Kiel Institute for the World\nEconomy.\n\nMuch of the aid has gone toward providing weapons systems, training, and\nintelligence that Ukrainian commanders need to defend against Russia, which\nhas one of the world\u2019s most powerful militaries. Many Western analysts say the\nmilitary aid provided by the United States and other allies has played a\npivotal role in Ukraine\u2019s defense and counteroffensive against Russia. U.S.\nand allied leaders consider Russia\u2019s invasion a brutal and illegal war of\naggression on NATO\u2019s frontier that, if successful, would subjugate millions of\nUkrainians; encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s revanchist aims; and\ninvite similar aggression from other rival powers, especially China.\n\nGet the Facts\n\nHow Much Aid Has the U.S. Sent Israel?\n\nNATO allies are particularly wary of being pulled directly into the\nhostilities, which could dramatically raise the risk of a nuclear war.\nHowever, as the fighting has progressed, many donor governments have shed\ntheir reluctance to give Ukraine more sophisticated assets, such as battle\ntanks and modern fighter aircraft. In the summer of 2023, the United States\nagreed to allow its European allies to provide Ukraine with U.S.-made F-16s.\nThe first transfer of these advanced fighters was expected in mid-2024, around\nthe time the first set of Ukrainian pilots were scheduled to complete their\ntraining on the aircraft.\n\nTwo years into the war, the Biden administration had provided or agreed to\nprovide Ukraine with a long list of defense capabilities, including Abrams\nbattle tanks, anti-aircraft missiles, coastal defense ships, and advanced\nsurveillance and radar systems. In July 2023, the Biden administration sparked\nsome controversy in agreeing to supply Ukraine with cluster munitions, which\nare banned by most countries because of the risk their undetonated components\ncan pose to civilians many years after their use.\n\nMore on:\n\nUkraine\n\nForeign Aid\n\nUnited States\n\nMilitary Operations\n\nHow Ukraine Is Tapping the U.S. Arsenal\n\nU.S. security

comes into\nview.\n\nHowever, the magnitude of U.S. aid to Ukraine might seem less remarkable in\ncomparison to what the Pentagon is budgeted each year, or what the Treasury\nwas authorized (via the Troubled Asset Relief Fund) to bail out Wall Street\nbanks, auto companies, and other sectors of the economy during the U.S.\nfinancial crisis.\n\nWhen compared with the critical support to Ukraine from other countries, the\nsize of U.S. aid stands out.\n\nHowever, many European governments are making larger financial contributions\nto Ukraine relative to the size of their economies.\n\nMegan
