And move they did: within six months of the introduction\nof Penguins to the market in 1935, the paperback company was boasting that\nthree million copies had been sold. Unconventionally available in variety,\nchain stores, and newsagents as well as the more traditional bookshops,\nPenguins weren\u2019t just another variation on cheap books.\n\nHistorian Richard Hornsey writes that Penguin publisher Allen Lane had an\navowedly \u201cleftist vision of social-democratic progress.\u201d Lane aimed for a\ndemocratizing public sphere with an \u201cengaged public readership,\u201d though one\nperhaps not as left-left as the contemporary Left Book Club (1936\u20131948). What\nLane used to reach these ends was pure capitalism: \u201cthe techniques of mass\nproduction, distribution, and retail.\u201d\n\nAnd an adorable black-and-white flightless bird.\n\n\u201cChoosing a brand character, and specifically a penguin, allowed [Lane] to\nappropriate the utopian dynamic of mass consumption and mold it to fit his own\nprogressive cultural project,\u201d writes Hornsey.\n\n> Penguin\u2019s mascot became one of mid-century Britain\u2019s most notable harbingers\n> of social democracy. ... [T]he cartoon bird provided a vital mechanism\n> through which individual browsers learned to align themselves with its\n> lucratively imagined public sphere.\n\nThe penguin, a simple, bold-lined cartoon illustration of a King penguin,\nappeared on all the books (on both front and back covers and the spine), in\nall the advertisements, and in all in-store promotional material. Sellers,\noriginally required to take a minimum of ten copies of each release of ten\ntitles, displayed their 100 books in dedicated Penguin displays, just like\ncanned goods at the supermarket.\n\nPenguin\u2019s penguin remains one of the most recognizable brands in the world\ntoday. But...why a penguin?\n\nInspired by the existing Albatross Books, Lane\u2019s nascent company wanted an\nanimal for their mascot. Many years after the fact, designer Edward Young\nexplained (as quoted by Hornsey) that after a couple hours of fruitless\nbrainstorming, \u201cwe were in despair. Then suddenly the secretary\u2019s voice piped\nup from behind the partition (her name, it should be recorded for posterity,\nwas Joan Coles). She said, \u2018What about Penguins?\u2019\u201d\n\nOff went Young to the London Zoo, where the \u201cfiercely modernist\u201d Penguin Pond\nexhibit had opened the year before to general acclaim. (Penguin Pond architect\nBerthold Lubetkin would subsequently be asked by Lane to design the forecourt\nof Penguin\u2019s new distribution center, but declined the offer.)\n\nA penguin is, of course, a penguin, not a person.\n\nAs Hornsey shows, there was already a strong tradition of \u201cmedia star\u201d\nbranding mascots. These included Johnnie Walker (scotch); the Quaker (oats);\nthe Kodak Girl (cameras); Rowntree\u2019s Cocoa Nibs, a boy and girl in long\ncolored scarfs and their dog, Cute, who flogged cocoa; Fry\u2019s Girl (more\nchocolate); Pears Soap\u2019s tramp-in-need-of-a-bath, Dirty Dick; Cardinal Wolsey\n(a historic figured appropriated to brand knitwear); and many others. The term\n\u201cbranding personality\u201d wouldn\u2019t be coined until the 1950s, but the idea was\nalready going strong in the 1920s. Hornsey notes a similarity with movie\nstars: people identified with the brand-mascots of their favorite products.\nSome even wrote these fictional characters letters. During the fancy dress\ncraze of the 1920s, the costumes of these ad figures were very popular,\nwinning their wearers awards at competitive balls.\n\n#### Weekly Newsletter\n\nA penguin is, of course, a penguin, not a person. But these upright, waddling\nbirds are comically people-like. The live specimens at the London Zoo\u2019s\nPenguin Pond \u201cprovoked a range of anthropomorphic media analogies, including\nsoldiers on parade, \u2018Dominicans in feathers,\u2019 and \u2018self-conscious chorus\ngirls.\u2019\u201d Edward Young captured that humorous similarity. His design was\nextraordinarily powerful, quickly iconic, and highly effective as a brand.\nPeople bought Penguins\u2014which originally had no cover art\u2014precisely because\nthey were Penguins. For years, Penguin\u2019s meta-advertising also showed the\naffable penguin reading Penguins, \u201cannouncing to prospective purchases that\nthey and the bird were of the same species.\u201d\n\nYoung, as it turned out, was not overly fond of how penguins smelled, but Lane\n\u201cnever passed up a photo opportunity with them.\u201d\n\nSupport JSTOR Daily!
