The incident raised alarm about the impact of\nnew GMO plants.\n\n## Shots\n\nHealth News From NPR\n\n  * Your Health\n  * Treatments & Tests\n  * Health Inc.\n  * Policy-ish\n  * Public Health\n\n  * Twitter\n\n### Your Health\n\n# A mix-up over bioengineered tomato seeds sparked fears about spread of GMO\ncrops\n\nApril 28, 20247:00 AM ET\n\nFrom\n\nBy\n\nSasa Woodruff\n\nSasa Woodruff\n\nSasa Woodruff\n\nThe Purple Galaxy Tomato splashed across the cover of this season's Baker\nCreek Heirloom Seeds catalog: a closeup of a blackish-purple tomato speckled\nwith tiny pink dots. Next to it, sits a sliced open fruit, revealing deep\nfuchsia seeds and flesh.\n\n\"This beauty is believed to be the first \u2014 and the purplest \u2014 non-GMO purple\ntomato in the universe!\" read the catalog copy.\n\nOnly problem? The seeds actually may have been a GMO variety, the recently\nreleased Purple Tomato, created using genes from a snapdragon flower by\nNorfolk Healthy Produce.\n\nThe mix-up has caused consternation for the heirloom seed company that prides\nitself on offering rare and organic varieties and takes a firm stance against\nGMO crops. And it's triggered debate about biodiversity and what can happen\nwith GMO seeds when they begin to spread.\n\nWhen news of a non-GMO purple-fleshed tomato variety first started circulating\non social media last fall, some scientists and tomato enthusiasts weren't so\nsure.\n\n### Shots - Health News\n\n### Gardeners can now grow a genetically modified purple tomato made with\nsnapdragon DNA\n\n\"I had discussions with colleagues about it, and all of us just looked at it\nand said, well, that's the GMO tomato,\" says David Francis, a professor of\nhorticulture and crop science at the Ohio State University who specializes in\ntomato breeding and genetics.\n\nTraditional plant breeders to date have not been able to create a purple-\nfleshed tomato with cross pollination. Purple skin, yes? Purple flesh, not so\nmuch.\n\nBut using recombinant DNA technology, scientists in the United Kingdom had\ndeveloped a purple-fleshed tomato high in antioxidants. It was recently\napproved for sale and consumption in the United States.\n\nA caprese salad prepared with Norfolk's Purple Tomato. The tomato was created\nusing genes from a snapdragon. Norfolk Plant Sciences hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nNorfolk Plant Sciences\n\nA caprese salad prepared with Norfolk's Purple Tomato. The tomato was created\nusing genes from a snapdragon.\n\nNorfolk Plant Sciences\n\nAfter Nathan Pumplin, CEO of Norfolk Healthy Produce, saw Instagram videos of\nthe heirloom seed company's Purple Galaxy tomato, he contacted Baker Creek.\nAnd here's where the story gets murky.\n\nJohn Brazaitis, general manager of Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds says their seeds\nwere developed by a hobby breeder in France where growing GMOs is banned.\nBrazaitis says they tested for NPTII, a common marker for GMOs, but didn't\nspecifically test for the snapdragon genes.\n\nAfter some correspondence and disagreement about the testing, Baker Creek\npulled the seeds from its collection and destroyed its stock.\n\nThe seed company refused to say whether or not the seeds were GMO and wrote in\na statement: \"After repeated testing, we are unable to conclusively establish\nthat the Purple Galaxy does not contain any genes that have been genetically\nmodified.\"\n\nPumplin wouldn't say definitively either, but their website says this: \"We are\ntold that laboratory testing determined that it is, in fact, bioengineered\n(GMO). This result supports the fact that the only reported way to produce a\npurple-fleshed tomato rich in anthocyanin antioxidants is with Norfolk's\npatented technology.\"\n\nBut the next mystery is one that's harder to answer: How could seeds get from\na closed lab in the United Kingdom to a hobby gardener in France?\n\n\"I don't think it's a runaway train. You could easily argue that Baker Creek\nhas it in their catalog because somebody misappropriated it and didn't do\ntheir due diligence,\" Ohio State's Francis says, \"Whether that was just\nincompetence or a mistake, who knows?\"\n\nFrancis says this isn't a case of the modified tomato genes escaping into the\nwild from a UK lab and traveling by wind across the English Channel to France\nbecause tomatoes don't spread like dandelions, purslane or ivy.\n\n\"For the same reason that regular tomatoes don't become weeds,\" he says, \"They\njust don't have the characteristics that allow them to compete well in a\ncrowded environment.\"\n\nFrancis says humans were most certainly involved. The GMO Purple Tomato was in\ndevelopment for 20 years, which means access to plant materials was long and\nsustained.\n\n\"Maybe it's a collaborator in France had some and their technician took it,\nand then their technician gave it to a friend who knows, right?\" he says,\n\"Somebody took it and said, hey, I'm going to play with this.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time a genetically engineered plant ended up with\nunwitting producers or consumers. In 1987, a German lab created an orange\npetunia by inserting a maize gene. It was never released to the public, but\nalmost 30 years later, it was found in Finland, again almost certainly from\nsomeone illicitly breeding them. The culprit plants were all over Europe and\nthe United States, not growing in the wild, but in gardens, parks and train\nstations.\n\nMost of Europe has a GMO ban, so government agencies asked growers to destroy\nthe orange varieties. When the USDA asked for a recall in 2017, there were\nnine varieties growers had to destroy with names like Trilogy Mango, Petunia\nSalmon Ray or Sweetunia Orange Flash. The USDA approved the orange petunia for\nsale in 2021.\n\nEven if the GMO purple tomato seeds were not spreading in the wild, Baker\nCreek's Brazaitis is concerned that GM seeds could show up in surprising\nplaces and growers won't know if they have GM seeds or not.\n\n\"It's going to happen again and again as we see more GM crops come to market\nfor consumers,\" says Brazaitis.\n\nBaker Creek's Brazaitis says the whole experience of pulling the seed from\ntheir collection was very painful and worries about the long-term\nimplications.\n\n\"We were absolutely over the moon about finding this really unique variety,\"\nBrazaitis says, \"The comedown from that has been really hard. We never thought\nwe'd be facing a GMO issue with tomatoes.\"\n\nPumplin says that USDA evaluated their tomato (as it does for all approved GM\ncrops) to make sure it was unlikely to start spreading like a weed. \"There is\nnothing in the purple tomato that would make it overtake other tomato\npopulations,\" says Pumplin.\n\nTomatoes have about 35,000 genes and Pumplin points out the Purple Tomato has\nonly two extra from a snapdragon. Tomatoes are self pollinating, which means\npollination is contained within the flower and the risk of gene spread is very\nlow.\n\nStill, Brazaitis worries that GM varieties of plants could take over. \"If we\nlose the biodiversity in our plant world, these varieties no longer exist and\nyou're entirely dependent on things like GMOs to provide food,\" he says.\n\nHe says maintaining heirloom varieties is important because they're constantly\nadapting to new environments. USDA organic certified products don't allow GM\nvarieties.\n\nFrancis argues that biodiversity is thriving in the tomato world.\n\n\"Some of the research that my group has done on tomatoes shows pretty\nconclusively that contemporary tomatoes, what we're using today, are more\ngenetically diverse than the heirloom tomatoes of old,\" Francis says.\n\nOne of the main reasons is wild tomato genes have been pulled in and crossed\nfor disease resistance and nutritional content is actually widening the gene\npool of our food.\n\n##### Correction April 28, 2024\n\nIn an earlier version of this story the name of Norfolk Healthy Produce CEO\nNathan Pumplin was misspelled as Pumpkin.\n\n  * purple tomato\n  * GMOs\n  * gardening\n  * organic food\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### On Aging\n\n#### Got brothers or sisters?
