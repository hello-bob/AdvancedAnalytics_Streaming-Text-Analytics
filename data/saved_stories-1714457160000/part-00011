Brown\u2014AFP/Getty Images\n\nDrew Baglino is cashing out. The former senior vice president in charge of\npowertrain engineering at Tesla liquidated virtually his entire stake in the\ncompany\u2014worth $181 million\u2014days after leaving the company last week.\n\nIn a regulatory disclosure, Tesla said Baglino has exercised the bulk of his\nvested stock options that converted into 1.14 million shares. He promptly\ndumped them onto the market on Wednesday, the day after Tesla filed its 10-Q\nstatement, which was the earliest possible opportunity for a corporate\ninsider.\n\nThe options were at risk of expiring 90 days after his departure, but Baglino\ncould have elected to retain a portion of his shares.\n\nOnce a leading contender to replace Elon Musk on the Tesla throne, Baglino\nhelped build the company\u2019s lucrative business in commercial energy storage led\nby its industrial scale Megapack battery, now quite possibly its highest\nmargin manufactured product.\n\nBut the solar roof business he runs dwindled to little more than a rounding\nerror, and Tesla this quarter stopped publishing deployment figures, its only\nreported metric. Worse, the 4680 cell, once the foundational pillar that would\nensure Tesla\u2019s cost competitiveness over its rivals, has run into repeated\nmanufacturing problems and is now effectively no longer core to its equity\nstory.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think its super important, at least in the near term,\u201d Musk told\ninvestors on Tuesday, arguing Battery Day\u2019s main unveil from 2020 was in\nreality little more than a hedge against the soaring cost of sourcing cells\nfrom battery suppliers.\n\n\u201cWe did the cell program in order to address the crazy increase in cost per\nkilowatt-hour from our suppliers due to gigantic orders placed by every\ncarmaker on earth,\u201d Musk continued. Now that cell producers are stuck with\nexcess capacity after incumbents like Ford have pulled back from the EV\nmarket, prices are a lot more favorable for Tesla.\n\n## Baron places faith in new strategy shift for low-cost EV\n\nBaglino\u2019s stock sale coincided with optimism from veteran Tesla investor Ron\nBaron on CNBC on Thursday. The head of Baron Capital, whose largest position\nis in Tesla, called the bottom for the stock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to go up huge. Now is the bottom,\u201d he said, arguing the new\nstrategy shift for its low-cost car would plug a yawning 1.2-million-unit hole\nacross a production network capable of building 3 million cars annually\u2014all\nwithout the need for additional capex spending.\n\nBut his frustration with the stock, up only 1% since this time last year and\ndown overall since the start of 2021, was audible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so exciting to be up 1% in a year when the market is so strong,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI do look around all the time and see everyone getting rich\u2014and I\u2019m not\npoor, but I haven\u2019t made a lot of progress over the last three years, so\ntherefore I think it\u2019s like a rubber band\u2014I\u2019m going to catch up again.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the\nfuture of business.
