But dig deeper and you will find that\nthe picture painted in the article is deliberately misleading.\n\nTurns out that the above article is based on a study titled \u201cPrevalence of\nChildren Aged 6 to 23 Months Who Did Not Consume Animal Milk, Formula, or\nSolid or Semisolid Food During the Last 24 Hours Across Low- and Middle-Income\nCountries\u201d published in JAMA Network Open in February 2024.\n\nThis study clearly defines \u2018Zero food\u2019 children as infants who have not eaten\nanything apart from breastmilk in the 24 hours prior to the survey.\n\nThe study found that in India, about 81 per cent of the children were reported\nto have some complementary food apart from breastmilk in the 24 hours prior to\nthe survey, whereas the rest did not.\n\nThis does not mean that the \u201czero food\u201d infants were without any food (they\nwere consuming breast milk) or that they were not getting any complementary\nfood at all! In fact, it is likely these infants also occasionally consumed\ncomplementary food but had not consumed it in the previous 24-hour cycle.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) recommends that complementary feeding\nincluding solid, semi-solid and soft foods be introduced at six months of age\nwhile continuing to breastfeed.\n\nThe guidelines by WHO also state that children who are still breastfed after\none year of age should meet a substantial portion of their energy needs beyond\nthe breast milk in their diet.\n\nWe have no quarrels about this. In fact, this is very much in line with our\ntradition of \u2018Annaprashana\u2019 (known by different names across India) where an\ninfant is fed grain, usually rice, for the first time. The ceremony usually\nhappens between the age six and nine months.\n\nWe are not debating here whether complementary feeding is necessary or not.\nThe purpose of our article is to demonstrate how adventurous wording by\nattention-seeking academics is further sensationally reported by media. This\nis deliberately misleading.\n\nIn this case, for instance, the researchers coined the term \u2018Zero-food\u2019\nchildren while excluding the feeding of breastmilk, despite the fact that even\nWHO notes that it does fulfil significant portion of food requirements of\nchildren. To be fair, the authors do clarify this in the paper, however the\nterm itself is misleading and obviously meant to grab eyeballs.\n\nNext, media reporting stretches the term to categorise this as a case of\nstarvation. For instance, notice the clever addition of word \u2018whatsoever\u2019 in\nthe first line of the above mentioned The Telegraph article, disregarding the\nclarification from the study that zero-food definition excludes breastmilk.\n\nNote that this particular case of misrepresentation is a repeat offence. It\ncame up first when a similar study of estimating \u201czero-food\u201d children in India\nwas published in March 2013 in the Lancet journal.\n\nAt that time, a commentary was written in response by a group of professors\nfrom International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), the agency which\nconducts National Family Health Survey that provided the basis of the paper.\n\nThey pointed that the concept of zero-food as defined in the Lancet study was\nmisleading as it excluded the breastmilk out of the definition of food. This\ncreates unwarranted alarm among readers and policy makers as it is capturing\nonly lack of complementary feeding, not an absolute lack of food.\n\nAnother key insight from the commentary was that about two-thirds of the\ninfants who did not receive complementary feeding were within the age group of\nsix months to one year. This age group is young enough that it can rely mostly\non breast milk with only occasional complementary feeding.\n\nThe point of this article is that one has to be careful while reading such\nsensational reports. Moreover, as we saw above, this is not a one-off case but\nhas become a common enough phenomenon where academic showmanship combined with\n\u2018click bait\u2019 media reporting has created misleading impressions. It is not\npossible to counter every such instance but we felt it was important that the\nissue be brought to general attention.\n\nSave & read from anywhere!\n\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the Swarajya app.\n\nSign In\n\nSanjeev Sanyal and Aakanksha Arora are Member and Joint Director respectively\nof Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.
