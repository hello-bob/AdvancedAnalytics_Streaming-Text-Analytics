It follows the M3 by just a few\nmonths.\n\nApple\n\n#### reader comments\n\n47\n\nIn a major shake-up of its chip roadmap, Apple has announced a new M4\nprocessor for today\u2019s iPad Pro refresh, barely six months after releasing the\nfirst MacBook Pros with the M3 and not even two months after updating the\nMacBook Air with the M3.\n\nApple says the M4 includes \"up to\" four high-performance CPU cores, six high-\nefficiency cores, and a 10-core GPU. Apple's high-level performance estimates\nsay that the M4 has 50 percent faster CPU performance and four times as much\ngraphics performance. Like the GPU in the M3, the M4 also supports hardware-\naccelerated ray-tracing to enable more advanced lighting effects in games and\nother apps. Due partly to its \"second-generation\" 3 nm manufacturing process,\nApple says the M4 can match the performance of the M2 while using just half\nthe power.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nNew iPad Pros are the thinnest Apple device ever, feature dual-OLED screens\n\nAs with so much else in the tech industry right now, the M4 also has an AI\nfocus; Apple says it's beefing up the 16-core Neural Engine (Apple\u2019s\nequivalent of the Neural Processing Unit that companies like Qualcomm, Intel,\nAMD, and Microsoft have been pushing lately). Apple says the M4 runs up to 38\ntrillion operations per second (TOPS), considerably ahead of Intel's Meteor\nLake platform, though a bit short of the 45 TOPS that Qualcomm is promising\nwith the Snapdragon X Elite and Plus series. The M3's Neural Engine is only\ncapable of 18 TOPS, so that's a major step up for Apple's hardware.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple\u2019s chips since 2017 have included some version of the Neural Engine,\nthough to date, those have mostly been used to enhance and categorize photos,\nperform optical character recognition, enable offline dictation, and do other\noddities. But it may be that Apple needs something faster for the kinds of on-\ndevice large language model-backed generative AI that it\u2019s expected to\nintroduce in iOS and iPadOS 18 at WWDC next month.\n\nThe wait between the M1 and M2 and the wait between the M2 and M3 were each\nabout a year and a half. With as few technical details as Apple has announced,\nit\u2019s tough to know what to make of the faster turnaround between the M3 and\nM4. It could be that the M3 was behind schedule and the M4 was on time or\nahead; it could also be that the M4 is a relatively modest architectural\nupdate to the M3. We'll need to test the hardware ourselves to determine\nexactly how the M3 and M4 stack up to each other.\n\nThe fast introduction of the M4 makes it a little clearer why Apple might\nchoose not to update devices like the Mac mini with an M3 chip. Either the M3\nprocessor generation will be uncommonly short, or Apple plans to sell a mix of\nM3 and M4 devices this year.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n47\n\nAndrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with\na focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of\noperating systems like Windows and macOS.
