ABC News: Clint Jasper\n\nAs an Australian first, the Haystacks solar farm offers a share in the power\nof the sun to those otherwise excluded from the solar boom.\n\n## Solar inequality\n\nIn a country infamous for its political \u2018climate wars\u2019, rooftop solar is a\nnational success story \u2013 a bipartisan winner.\n\nAustralia has the world\u2019s highest rates of rooftop solar per capita, with\naround one in every three homes generating their own power, driving a\nmonumental transition in Australia\u2019s electricity grid.\n\nSolar players benefit from cheaper electricity bills and the knowledge they\nare helping to reduce Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBut not everyone can enjoy these benefits.\n\nWith a third of Australians renting, home ownership is one of the biggest\nbarriers for people to participate in solar.\n\nMost landlords haven\u2019t invested in solar panels because they don\u2019t get the\nbenefit of lower power bills. Another reason is landlords remain unconvinced\nthat tenants would want to pay more for a property with solar.\n\nAs a result, 90 per cent of renters don\u2019t have access to solar, a Macquarie\nUniversity study shows.\n\nHaystacks director Kristy Walters says the project is attractive to those keen\nto be part of the solar juggernaut, who for various reasons can\u2019t host their\nown solar panels.\n\nHaystacks director Kristy Walters believes in tackling climate challenges on a\ncommunity level. ABC News: Jo Lauder\n\n\u201cOne of the key one is renters, or people living in apartments ... but also\npeople that have a shady roof, or it might be heritage listed, or it has shale\nor something that isn\u2019t suitable for installing rooftop solar on it,\u201d she\nsays.\n\n## Harvesting the sun\u2019s energy\n\nMore than 170 people have now become \u2018solar gardeners\u2019, having purchased a\n\u2018plot\u2019 on the privately owned farm in Grong Grong. The solar farm started\nproducing energy this month.\n\nEach \u2018plot\u2019 cost $4,200, which buys approximately three kilowatts of solar\npanels in the array.\n\nHaystacks says the solar gardeners, who mostly live in cities hours away, will\nget at least $455 off their power bills for the next decade, with $505 a year\nfor the first five years locked in.\n\nThis amount isn\u2019t dependent on how the solar farm performs, and Haystacks\npredicts the returns will actually be higher with any future corporate power\nagreement.\n\nThe returns are credited directly to their electricity bills.\n\nAs well as buying their solar plot, each of them is also a member of the\ncooperative that oversees the project.\n\n\u201cWe specifically chose a co-op, because we really liked the democratic values\nthat are baked into that model, where everyone who becomes a member has a vote\nin any major decision,\u201d Walters said.\n\nHaystacks might be a small fish in the pond of renewables developments, but\nhas its own benefits.\n\nLike large-scale projects, it\u2019s situated in an ideal location for sunshine,\nand uses the same single-axis tracking panels that rotate to follow the sun\u2019s\njourney across the sky each day.\n\nWhereas major solar farms require expensive transmission infrastructure\nupgrades to take the power from the panels to people\u2019s homes, Haystacks can\nplug into the existing grid with only minor adjustments.\n\nThe panels at the farm plug into the existing grid. ABC News: Clint Jasper\n\n\u201cIt connects to the poles and wires and the distribution line that we see in\nall of our streets, so it\u2019s a lot more accessible,\u201d Walters said.\n\nThe energy equivalent to a shared garden, Haystack lets its owners \u2018grow\u2019\npower away from the place they live.\n\n\u201cIf you live in a tiny apartment and you want to grow some tomatoes but you\ndon\u2019t have anywhere to grow them, you would rent a plot in the community\ngarden, \u201d Walters says.\n\n> \u201cIf you want to generate solar energy, but you don\u2019t have a rooftop to do\n> that on, you purchase a plot and you get solar energy from that.\u201d\n\n## Furrows in solar schemes\n\nCommunity solar gardens are no perfect replacement for rooftop solar and lack\nsome of the financial benefits.\n\nHouseholds with rooftop solar avoid some of the network fees by using the\nelectricity before it goes into the grid, according to Dr Bjorn Sturmberg, an\nenergy research fellow at the Australian National University.\n\n\u201cYour electricity bill has network charges on it, and those are calculated on\na per unit basis. So the more electricity you use, the more you pay towards\nthe upkeep of the poles and wires in your area,\u201d he explained.\n\nRooftop solar also reduces demand when there is pressure on the grid, such as\nduring heatwaves, whereas solar garden owners continue to draw electricity\nfrom the grid.\n\nSolar users not only save on electricity costs but also on additional network\ncosts. ABC News: Jess Davis\n\nMost people living in apartment blocks are excluded from the benefits of solar\nenergy. ABC Radio Perth: Emma Wynne\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be clear that initiatives like the solar gardens are not as\nfinancially rewarding as rooftop solar, and that they\u2019re never going to be,\u201d\nDr Sturmberg said.\n\nWhile some experts see community renewable projects as an empowering way for\ncommunities to share in the financial windfalls from the energy transition,\nothers say they merely highlight the frustrating gaps in policy and the lack\nof mandated energy efficiency standards for rentals.\n\n\u201cCommunity energy is a pretty broad term to describe how different collections\nof citizens acting to try and generally to try and speed up the energy\ntransition, and often many cases, also to try and make that transition a bit\nfairer,\u201d Dr Sturmberg said.\n\nBut the energy system is favoured toward large-scale projects, according to Dr\nSturmberg.\n\n\u201cThe energy system is kind of becoming bifurcated into really large\ngenerators, such as huge wind farms and solar farms that produce hundreds of\nmegawatts of power ... and then rooftop solar,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to kind of be in that middle ground between those two. In\nthe case of this community solar garden, it\u2019s fantastic to see it actually\ncome to fruition.\u201d\n\nBut, in the absence of either carrots or sticks to coerce landlords into\nproviding efficient homes with rooftop solar, some renters are forging ahead\nwith community schemes to invest in renewable energy.\n\n## Sowing seeds for a cleaner future\n\nJustine Lloyd had rented the same Randwick apartment for 17 years, a dark\nbrick art deco block of six, typical of Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs.\n\nA lifelong renter, she knew it was unlikely her landlord would agree to put\nsolar on their apartment block roof.\n\nBeing a solar energy producer had always been out of reach for renter Justine\nLloyd ... until now. ABC News: Chris Taylor\n\n\u201cThe landlord doesn\u2019t want to do any repairs, let alone improvements, so we\nknew straight away when we moved in that we couldn\u2019t have solar,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Lloyd jumped at the opportunity to become a \u201csolar gardener\u201d and invest in\nthe co-op model, where as a member she would have a say in decisions regarding\nthe project.\n\n\u201cI feel principles behind the solar garden are really great, because you\u2019re\nactually sharing the infrastructure. No one person has to set it up and be\nresponsible for it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe benefits of being a \u2018solar gardener\u2019 really hit home when Ms Lloyd\nrecently got her notice that she had to move from the place she called home\nfor almost two decades.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to pick up my solar panels and take them with me every time I\nmove,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs a renter, my housing is probably short-term. You just never know where\nyou\u2019re going to be living next year.\u201d\n\nJustine recognises this isn\u2019t the same as having solar on your roof, but she\nsees it as an opportunity to invest in renewable energy.\n\n\u201cThe power\u2019s going in the grid and doesn\u2019t necessarily come exactly to my\nhouse but it is by taking away the need for building more coal fired power\nstations or more fossil fuel investment,\u201d she said.\n\n> \u201cI get to be part of that climate and energy solution.\u201d\n\nIt was the same driver for fellow \u2018solar gardener\u2019 Haryana Dhillon, who rents\na city terrace house with a skylight and attic window, making the roof space\ntoo small for solar.\n\nHaryana feels good knowing the power she uses is being generated by a\nrenewable source.\n\n\u201cSo climate change was a really big factor, wanting to do whatever we could to\nminimise the impact of climate change,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cIt was the potential that this was actually something that was feasible and\ncould be a demonstration for other people around the country.\n\n\u201cAnd the more that other people and the government and politicians see that, I\nthink, the more likely they are to take it more seriously.\u201d\n\nBjorn Sturmberg from ANU and other energy experts believe there\u2019s an ultimate\nfix to these issues.\n\nBjorn Sturmberg says there is only one way to solve energy inequality -\naccelerate the green transition. ABC News: Jess Davis\n\n> \u201cThe best thing we can do is to accelerate the transition of the whole\n> national electricity grid to be more renewables, [that\u2019s] therefore cleaner\n> and cheaper.\n\n\u201cOnce that\u2019s the case, there\u2019ll be less of an imbalance between those who rent\nthan those who own properties and have solar.\u201d\n\nHe also thinks governments should focus on the demand side of electricity:\nthat is, how it\u2019s used in Australian homes.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely inescapable, and of utmost importance that we also help\nrental properties, apartments and social housing have more efficient and\nelectrified homes,\u201d he said.\n\n## A new crop\n\nFarmer Gemma Purcell is the perfect embodiment of the power of community\nenergy to bring people together.\n\nHer resentment at the lack of climate action drove her to plant the first\nseeds for the solar farm about eight years ago, after meeting experts at a\ncommunity renewables event.\n\n\u201cI was becoming eternally grumpy and frustrated with the inertia at government\nlevel in terms of climate action, emissions reduction, and the energy\ntransition,\u201d she explained, surrounded by the red dirt and gleaming metal of\nthe panels.\n\nHaving the solar farm in the mix also helped her future-proofing her\noperations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an income stream as well, which just hedges your risks through times of\ndrought or difficulty. Goodness knows it just gets tougher and tougher,\u201d she\ncommented.\n\n> \u201cTaking action is a bit of a survival tactic in a way.\u201d\n\nShe said she hadn\u2019t faced any opposition to the project from the local\ncommunity, which had minimal impact on its surroundings.\n\n\u201cPeople are happy to see some medium-scale infrastructure. We have big wheat\nsilos in the landscape, things that are of a scale of this,\u201d she said.\n\nPaving the way with the first community model for renewable energy wasn\u2019t\neasy, she admitted, but she hoped others would soon follow her example.\n\n\u201cMost farmers are in favour of renewable energy, they\u2019re across it, they\nunderstand it, and farmers are very high tech operators,\u201d she said.\n\nGemma Purcell hopes the Haystacks farm can serve as a template for future\ndevelopments like it. ABC News: Clint Jasper\n\nThe arrays on the farm can produce 1.5 megawatts of electricity. ABC News:\nClint Jasper\n\nSolar farmers are guaranteed an annual return of at least $505. ABC News:\nClint Jasper\n\nThe farm is jointly owned by the members of the co-op. ABC News: Clint Jasper\n\nThe solar farm has also helped Gemma Purcell future-proof her business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting because it is a proof of concept, it\u2019s replicable.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the what part of the community energy side of it is that the\nentire process is templated, which means now that the next one should be much\nsimpler.\u201d\n\nThe federal government committed $100 million in funding for solar banks, a\nshared solar system to help households that can\u2019t install their own.\n\nHaystacks director Kristy Walters is hopeful this funding will see more\nprojects like the farm near Grong Grong blossom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really popular in the United States and in Europe, and countries like\nGermany. But this is the first time it\u2019s come to Australia,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite its imperfections, it seems like community energy and projects like\nthis are here to stay, with all the plots at the solar farm sold out, and the\ndesire to participate in the energy transition still motivating many\nAustralians.\n\n## Credit\n\nReporter: Jo Lauder\n\nVideo and images: Clint Jasper, Jess Davis\n\nProducer: Fran Rimrod\n\nEditors: Tim Leslie and Edwina Farley\n\nOdyssey format by ABC News Story Lab\n\n1 / 13\n\nCommunity spirit is alive and well in Grong Grong, a small town on the Newell\nHighway east of Narrandera.
