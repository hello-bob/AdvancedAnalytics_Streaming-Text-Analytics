It plays an essential role in controlling body\ntemperature by cooling the skin through evaporation. But it can also carry\nsalts and other molecules out of the body in the process. In medieval Europe,\npeople would lick babies; if the skin was salty, they knew that serious\nillness was likely. (We now know that salty skin can be an indicator for\ncystic fibrosis.)\n\nScientists continue to study how the materials in sweat can reveal details\nabout an individual\u2019s health, but often they must rely on gathering samples\nfrom subjects during strenuous exercise in order to get samples that are\nsufficiently large for analysis.\n\nNow researchers in China have developed a wearable sensor system that can\ncollect and process small amounts of sweat while providing continuous\ndetection. They have named the design a \u201cskin-interfaced intelligent graphene\nnanoelectronic\u201d patch, or SIGN for short. The researchers, who described their\nwork in a paper published in Advanced Functional Materials, did not respond to\nIEEE Spectrum\u2019s interview requests.\n\nThe SIGN sensor patch relies on three separate components to accomplish its\ntask. First, the sweat must be transported from the skin into microfluidic\nchambers. Next, a special membrane removes impurities from the fluid. Finally,\nthis liquid is delivered to a bioreceptor that can be tuned to detect\ndifferent metabolites.\n\nThe transport system relies on a combination of hydrophilic (water-attracting)\nand hydrophobic (water-repelling) materials. This system can move aqueous\nsolutions along microchannels, even against gravity. This makes it possible to\ntransport small samples with precision, regardless of the device\u2019s\norientation.\n\nThe fluid is transported to a Janus membrane, where impurities are blocked.\nThis means that the sample that reaches the sensor is more likely to produce\naccurate results.\n\nFinally, the purified sweat arrives at a flexible biosensor. This graphene\nsensor is activated by enzymes designed to detect the desired biomarker. The\nresult is a transistor that can accurately measure the amount of the biomarker\nin the sample.\n\nAt its center, the system has a membrane that removes impurities from sweat\nand a biosensor that detects biomarkers.Harbin Institute of\nTechnology/Shenyang Aerospace University\n\nOne interesting feature of the SIGN patch is that it can provide continuous\nmeasurements. The researchers tested the device through multiple cycles of\nsamples with known concentrations of a target biomarker, and it was about as\naccurate after five cycles as it was after just one. This result suggests that\nit could be worn over an extended period without having to be replaced.\n\nContinuous measurements can provide useful longitudinal data. However, Tess\nSkyrme, a senior technology analyst at the research firm IDTechEx, points out\nthat continuous devices can have very different sampling rates. \u201cOverall, the\nright balance of efficient, comfortable, and granular data collection is\nnecessary to disrupt the market,\u201d she says, noting that devices also need to\noptimize \u201cbattery life, calibration, and data accuracy.\u201d\n\nThe researchers have focused on lactate\u2014a metabolite that can be used to\nassess a person\u2019s levels of exercise and fatigue\u2014as the initial biomarker to\nbe detected. This function is of particular interest to athletes, but it can\nalso be used to monitor the health status of workers in jobs that require\nstrenuous physical activity, especially in hazardous or extreme working\nconditions.\n\nNot all experts are convinced that biomarkers in sweat can provide accurate\nhealth data. Jason Heikenfeld, director of the Novel Device Lab at the\nUniversity of Cincinnati, has pivoted his research on wearable biosensing from\nsweat to the interstitial fluid between blood vessels and cells. \u201cSweat\nglucose and lactate are way inferior to measures that can be made in\ninterstitial fluid with devices like glucose monitors,\u201d he tells Spectrum.\n\nThe researchers also developed a package to house the sensor. It\u2019s designed to\nminimize power consumption, using a low-power microcontroller, and it includes\na Bluetooth communications chip to transmit data wirelessly from the SIGN\npatch. The initial design provides for 2 hours of continuous use without\ncharging, or up to 20 hours in standby mode.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Temporary Tattoo Keeps Tabs On Alcohol Intake \u203a\n  * Why Alphabet\u2019s Glucose Sensor Failed \u203a\n  * Why Sweat Will Power Your Next Wearable \u203a\n\nhealth monitoringmicrochannelssweatwearable sensor\n\nAlfred Poor\n\nThe Conversation (0)\n\nSort by\n\nArtificial IntelligenceNews\n\n## Llama 3 Establishes Meta as the Leader in \u201cOpen\u201d AI\n\n12 minutes ago\n\n4 min read\n\nTelecommunicationsMagazineInterview\n\n## Why One Man Spent 12 Years Fighting Robocalls\n\n22 hours ago\n\n3 min read\n\nTransportationArtificial IntelligenceNews\n\n## Startups Say India Is Ideal for Testing Self-Driving Cars\n\n24 Apr 2024\n\n6 min read\n\n## Related Stories\n\nBiomedicalNews\n\n## Wearable Sticker Reads Even the Smallest Finger Motions\n\nSemiconductorsFeature\n\n## Why Sweat Will Power Your Next Wearable\n\nRoboticsNews\n\n## Soft Robot Fingers Sweat to Cool Themselves\n\n", "frontpage": false}
