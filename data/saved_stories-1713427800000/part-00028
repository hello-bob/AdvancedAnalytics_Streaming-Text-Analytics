From Castle Wulfenbach in Girl\nGenius to the British aircraft carriers in Sky Captain and the World of\nTomorrow to the helicarriers of S.H.I.E.L.D., here is a look at these\nbehemoths of the sky.\n\nFlying aircraft carriers have a basis in reality. A few World War I-era\nBritish airships carried biplanes that could defend the mothership from\nattack. The United States Navy experimented with a similar \u201cparasite aircraft\u201d\nprogram in the 1930s.\n\nTupolev TB-3 artworkTupolev TB-3 in flight carrying five smaller planesTupolev\nTB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighter planes (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nSo did the Soviet Union. The Zveno project put small fighter planes on the\nwings of Tupolev TB-1 and TB-3 bombers. This configuration was used in Romania\nin the early days of World War II.\n\nPopular Science (October 1923)\n\nRear Admiral William W. Moffett of the United States Navy had written for\nPopular Science in 1923 that airships carrying airplanes, like \u201clifeboats on\nocean-going vessels,\u201d weren\u2019t far away.\n\nHe pointed out that airplanes had already been carried, launched and picked up\nby airships.\n\n> The future airship, developed for naval use, will carry a sting that will\n> make it one of the most formidable contenders for supremacy of the air, sea\n> and earth that has ever been conceived.\n\nMoffett predicted that airships would carry a dozen planes to protect it\nagainst attack, \u201cand in addition will mount a battery of guns that will\ncommand the respect of any enemy marauder.\u201d\n\n\u201cSky Leviathan of Tomorrow\u201d cutaway, from Popular Science (October 1923)\n\nHe didn\u2019t see much difficulty for planes taking off:\n\n> The launching of them is merely a matter of pushing the planes off into\n> space, where they can recover themselves with the ease of a bird thrown into\n> the air.\n\nThe United States Navy in fact built two such airships, Akron and Macon,\nlaunched in 1931 and 1933, respectively. They were the largest helium-filled\nairships ever built. (The hydrogen-filled Graf Zeppelin II and Hindenburg were\n5 meters taller and slightly more voluminous.) Both the American airships were\nlost in bad weather.\n\nCutaway of the USS Macon\n\nModern Mechanix (October 1934)\n\nAnother proposal, as reported in Modern Mechanix in October 1934, was to use a\nlanding strip that could double as solar panel:\n\n> The ordinary cigar-shaped dirigible would in effect have a slice taken from\n> the upper half of her gas bag. This would provide a large deck on which\n> could be mounted solar photo cells, an airplane runway and a hangar. Planes\n> could land on the dirigible, floating over the sea, to refuel for transocean\n> passenger service.\n\nGoodyear advertised a \u201cflying carrier for warplanes\u201d in the May 1942 edition\nof Popular Mechanics that it said could cruise at a speed of 50 nautical miles\nper hour, \u201cmore than twice the speed of surface aircraft carriers.\u201d\n\n> Immune, of course, to submarine attack, the airship would be expected to\n> operate beyond the range of lang-based enemy planes and at altitudes above\n> the effective gun range of surface vessels.\n\nCutaway of a \u201cflying carrier for warplanes\u201d from Popular Mechanics (May 1942)\n\nA year later, Popular Science reported on a design by Horace Chapman Young and\nEric Langlands that could double as passenger ship and flying aircraft\ncarrier.\n\n> The Airwing, as the craft is called, is built as a flying wing with space\n> within its single-wing body for helium, fuel, crew and payload and tunnels\n> in which propellers or blowers operate.\n\nThe idea was that the plane would pull and push itself forward \u2014 \u201cpulling\nthrough suction caused by a semivacuum created in front, and driven by exhaust\npressure at the rear.\u201d The helium would give it additional lifting power.\n\nCutaway from Popular Science (February 1943)\n\nA more serious study was carried out by Lockheed in the 1950s. Its CL-1201 was\nmeant to be a giant nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a whole string of\njets under its wing. It would have been the largest plane ever built \u2014 but it\nnever was.\n\nArtist\u2019s impression of a Lockheed CL-1201Cutaway of a Boeing 747 converted\ninto an aircraft carrier\n\nIn the early 1970s, the United States Air Force studied the possibility of\nconverting a Boeing 747 into a flying aircraft carrier. The problem was\ndeveloping fighter jets small enough to fit inside.\n\nSuch practicalities don\u2019t bother us \u2018punks. Let\u2019s move on to the fictional\nexamples!\n\nThe best-known is S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s helicarrier from the Marvel comic books and\nmovies. It has gone through various iterations, from literally a flying ship\nto the rotor-blade version of the most recent cinematic adaptations.\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier (Comic Unknown)Art by Gabriele Dell\u2019Otto from Secret\nWar, Volume 1Helicarrier in Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (1998)Helicarrier\nin Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)\n\nCloudbase in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons\n\nSpectrum, the international security agency in Captain Scarlet and the\nMysterons (1967-68), has a similar skyborne headquarters called Cloudbase.\n\nSo does the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce (UNIT) in Doctor Who. Its\nflying aircraft carrier is called the Valiant.\n\nPeter McKinstry\u2019s concept art for the Valiant looks remarkably similar to\nKevin Conran\u2019s for Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004). I\u2019m not sure\nif that was deliberate.\n\nThe carriers of Sky Captain ended up looking differently and they do not\nbelong to any international organization. Rather, because the United Kingdom\nwas still the world\u2019s premier sea power in the real-world 1930s, in the film\nthey are part of the British fleet.\n\nConcept art by Peter McKinstryValiant in \u201cThe Poison Sky\u201dConcept art by Kevin\nConranScene in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\n\nThe French-Canadian animation series Skyland (2005-07) features two flying\naircraft carriers, the Saint Nazaire and the Calisto. Both carry ten fighter\naircraft called Mosquitos. Their enemies, the dictatorial Sphere, operate a\nvertical mothership called The Monolith, which carries both smaller fighters\nand troops.\n\nThe Saint Nazaire in SkylandThe Monolith in Skyland\n\nSteampunk fans will be familiar with Girl Genius, Phil and Kaja Foglio\u2019s long-\nrunning webcomic. The series has not a flying aircraft carrier per se but a\nflying fortress, called Castle Wulfenbach, that can hold entire airships in\nits vast hangar bays. It is the headquarters of Baron Klaus Wulfenbach, the\ntyrant of Europe.\n\nIn Iron Sky (2012, our review here), the Nazis fly similarly oversized\nzeppelins, except these can go into space and carry a squadron of flying\ndiscs.\n\nA smaller version can be found in the 2008 game Turning Point: Fall of\nLiberty, where a German Flugzeugtr\u00e4ger carries a complement of fighter jets\nand smaller patrol zeppelins.\n\nIn the world of The Magnificent Kotobuki (2019), airships ferry goods between\ndistant parts of the world. Each carries a squadron of fighter planes in its\nbelly to defend against sky pirates.\n\nCastle Wulfenbach in Girl GeniusZeppelin in Iron SkyZeppelin in Turning Point:\nFall of LibertyAirship in The Magnificent Kotobuki\n\nThe Ace Combat series is extremely fond of flying aircraft carriers. The games\nstart off with the fairly conventional-looking UI-4053 Sphyrna in Ace Combat\n3: Electrosphere (1999), an airship with a hangar deck. It ups the ante in Ace\nCombat 6: Fires of Liberation (2007) with the Aigaion, a kilometer-wide flying\nwing with an even bigger hangar deck. The next game, Ace Combat 7: Skies\nUnknown (2019), has a propeller aircraft not unlike the flying wing in Captain\nAmerica: The First Avenger (2011) that can carry eighty attack drones.\n\nSaints Row: The Third (2011) features the Daedalus, a mobile aircraft carrier\nsimilar to some interpretations of the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier.\n\nUI-4053 Sphyrna in Ace Combat 3: ElectrosphereAigaion in Ace Combat 6: Fires\nof LiberationArsenal Bird in Ace Combat 7: Skies UnknownDaedalus in Saints\nRow: The Third\n\nArtists have given their on take on the trope.
