Random number generators (RNGs) based on quantum tunneling produce\ncompletely unpredictable sequences of zeroes and ones. But when a great event\nsynchronizes the feelings of millions of people, our network of RNGs becomes\nsubtly structured. We calculate one in a trillion odds that the effect is due\nto chance. The evidence suggests an emerging noosphere or the unifying field\nof consciousness described by sages in all cultures.\n\nThe Global Consciousness Project is an international, multidisciplinary\ncollaboration of scientists and engineers. We collect data continuously from a\nglobal network of physical random number generators located in up to 70 host\nsites around the world at any given time. The data are transmitted to a\ncentral archive which now contains more than 15 years of random data in\nparallel sequences of synchronized 200-bit trials generated every second.\n\nOur purpose is to examine subtle correlations that may reflect the presence\nand activity of consciousness in the world. We hypothesize that there will be\nstructure in what should be random data, associated with major global events\nthat engage our minds and hearts.\n\nSubtle but real effects of consciousness are important scientifically, but\ntheir real power is more immediate. They encourage us to make essential,\nhealthy changes in the great systems that dominate our world. Large scale\ngroup consciousness has effects in the physical world. Knowing this, we can\nintentionally work toward a brighter, more conscious future.\n\nExplore the website using the main Menu, which is a compact sitemap.
