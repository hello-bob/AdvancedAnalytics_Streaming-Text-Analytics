I finish games like\nSkyrim with a backpack full of unspent resources, reserved for a crisis that\nnever actually arrives. What\u2019s the point, then, of all these items?\n\nJust like I save items in games, in real life I too am reluctant to ask for\nfavors or promote my own projects. (Sometimes I even save all my favourite\ntreats and I never eat the last one). I treated these social and professional\nresources as if they were single-use \u201cmagical items\u201d, not to be wasted but\nreserved for some important-yet-undefined future magnum opus event.\n\nRecently I played Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 and I decided to try something new: I would\nactually gasp use my items as needed, as they were intended, without undue\nreservation. Not only was it actually fun to use my fireball scrolls and blow\nstuff up, but I also discovered new layers and hidden quests. For instance,\nusing a \u2018Speak with the Dead\u2019 scroll on a certain suspicious corpse unveiled a\nquestline I would have otherwise missed.\n\nWith the same mindset, I\u2019ve been trying to adjust in my personal and\nprofessional life.\n\nTo my surprise, these actions didn\u2019t exhaust my social or professional\ncapital; instead, they allowed me to derive benefits and opened new avenues,\nmuch like in the game. A friend forwarded my resume within their network, and\nmy posts connected me with others who shared my interests.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s far more important in life that you use the resources available\nto you, because you\u2019re on a clock. You need to optimize for your gains\nwherever you can take them, before you or your resources expire.\n\nAnd remember, people in your life actually want to help you. They also stand\nto benefit, and any sort of social capital isn\u2019t necessarily \u201csingle-use\u201d,\nmore like \u201con a cooldown\u201d, able to be requested again after a suitable delay\nor returning a favor.\n\nResources, whether in games or in life, are meant to be utilized. Hoarding\nthem out of fear of depletion prevents us from discovering new opportunities\nand connections. That\u2019s a scarcity mindset that we don\u2019t need to employ. Life\nthrives not on conservation but on strategic and bold usage of what we do\nhave.\n\nWe should not view our capabilities and opportunities as limited-use potions\nto be saved for the perfect moment. Instead, we should see them as tools\n(sometimes with a cooldown) and aptly use them to unblock ourselves and move\nahead whenever possible, in the very short time that we have on Earth.\n\nDiscuss on Hacker News\n\n\u2190 Back to home\n\n", "frontpage": true}
