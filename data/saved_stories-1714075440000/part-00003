Haskell is a safe, purely\nfunctional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime. This is a\nweekly summary of what\u2019s going on in its community.\n\n## Featured\n\n  * Bluefin, a new effect system by Tom Ellis\n\n> I\u2019ve mentioned my new effect system, Bluefin, a few times on this forum.\n> It\u2019s now ready for me to announce it more formally\n\n  * Getting your Haskell executable statically linked with Nix by Tom Sydney Kerckhove\n\n> I have been making my products statically linked over the past few days.\n> This post presents why and how to statically link your Haskell executables\n> and collects a mapping from obscure error to unexpected fixes.\n\n  * Getting your Haskell executable statically linked without Nix by Julian Ospald\n\n> Following the excellent post from Tom Sydney Kerckhove \u201cGetting your Haskell\n> executable statically linked with Nix\u201d, I want to present an alternative\n> approach.\n\n  * Improvements to the ghc-debug terminal interface by Matthew Pickering, Zubin Duggal, Hannes Siebenhandl\n\n> ghc-debug is a debugging tool for performing precise heap analysis of\n> Haskell programs (check out our previous post introducing it). While working\n> on Eras Profiling, we took the opportunity to make some much needed\n> improvements and quality of life fixes to both the ghc-debug library and the\n> ghc-debug-brick terminal user interface.\n\n  * Using Dhall To Animate Fractal by Tristan de Cacqueray\n\n> This post presents the new animation-fractal configuration schema I used to\n> produce the following 19th Century Piano Fractal playlist. In three parts, I\n> describe how Animation Fractal (AF) demos are defined, the new Dhall\n> schemas, and its Haskell embedding.\n\n  * What makes a good compiler warning? by Oleg Grenrus\n\n> Recently I came up with a criteria for a good warning to have in a compiler.\n\n## Jobs\n\nTrying to hire a Haskell developer? You should advertise with us!\n\n## In brief\n\n  * Markdown To HTML Compiler by Adam McDaniel\n\n> I wrote a Markdown to HTML compiler to pick up some Haskell \u2013 it was a\n> really fun project!\n\n  * Update to Hackage revisions in Nix by Magnus Therning\n\n> A few days after I published Hackage revisions in Nix I got a comment from\n> Wolfgang W that the next release of Nix will have a callHackageDirect with\n> support for specifying revisions.\n\n## Show & tell\n\n  * DevOps Weekly Log, 2024-04-17 by Bryan Richter\n\n> The big update is that the Stackage handover is complete. This means that\n> Stackage.org is now maintained by the Haskell Foundation! If you have issues\n> or suggestions for the website, direct them to the stackage-server\n> repository and I\u2019ll get back to you.\n\n## Call for participation\n\n  * Call for Talks: Haskell Implementors\u2019 Workshop 2024 by Matthew Pickering\n\n> The 16th Haskell Implementors\u2019 Workshop is to be held alongside ICFP 2024\n> this year in Milan. It is a forum for people involved in the design and\n> development of Haskell implementations, tools, libraries, and supporting\n> infrastructure to share their work and to discuss future directions and\n> collaborations with others. Talks and/or demos are proposed by submitting an\n> abstract, and selected by a small program committee. There will be no\n> published proceedings. The workshop will be informal and interactive, with\n> open spaces in the timetable and room for ad-hoc discussion, demos, and\n> lightning talks.\n\n  * lsp: Do try and avoid redundant config updates\n\n  * mendel: Support GHC 9.8\n\nThe content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational license.
