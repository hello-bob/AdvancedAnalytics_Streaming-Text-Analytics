A nice person will tell you what\nfeels good - and often what you think you want to hear at that time - even if\nit doesn\u2019t help you move past that situation.\n\nA kind person supports you as you adapt, grow, and evolve. They remind you\nthat evolving as a human being isn\u2019t something to be ashamed of. That\neverything evolves, and that\u2019s life\u2019s greatest accomplishment and reward. A\nnice person likes the version of you they know and wants you to keep that\nversion, even at the risk of losing your place in the future. They are trying\nto shield you from the pain that comes from evolving - the experience of\nfailing, learning, and improving into something new.\n\nA kind person helps you remember the beauty of thinking and acting with a\nlong-term view in mind. Happiness is collective flourishing for them. A nice\nperson thinks the long-term will take care of itself, and you should exploit\nthings now - even if anyone but you get hurt. Happiness, for them, is zero-sum\nand immediate.\n\nAnd when you experience pain, a kind person helps you see the progress that\ncan come from the pain. They are gentle but truthful with their feedback. They\nnudge you to go to the pain instead of running from it. They support you as\nyou note what the pain is like, how it makes you feel, and over time, what you\nwill do about it. A nice person doesn\u2019t want to \u2018kill the vibe\u2019 and wants you\nto be comfortable. To them, nothing screams discomfort like pain. They may\ntell you not to think about the pain, and it will \u2018disappear\u2019.\n\nA kind person sits with you as you navigate a tough situation. If they know\nyou can build the skills to handle it, they don\u2019t try to \u2018save\u2019 you by\nremoving the situation. Instead, they support you as you find the strength and\nresources that the situation requires. A nice person can\u2019t stand you going\nthrough something that tough, so they jump in to save you. What the nice\nperson forgets is that they are robbing you of the strength you need to deal\nwith setbacks, the will to adapt and be resilient, and the reminder of the\ngreat things you can accomplish regardless of the situation.\n\nA kind person reminds you about your internal locus of control. They remind\nyou of your role in the outcome you are experiencing, and if you are wise,\nyou\u2019ll take absolute responsibility and hold yourself accountable. From the\nplace of accountability, you can see clearly what you need to do. A nice\nperson gives you reasons why what you are experiencing isn\u2019t really your\nfault, and how you can blame it on the government, the economy, and anything\nelse but you. They understand your excuses. They know you are a good person,\nand life isn\u2019t just fair to you.\n\nAnd when you take on a new daunting project, the kind person tells you to find\nall the possible ways for it to be done, choose the best of it, and be\nflexible to change course during the journey. They tell you how daunting it\nwill be and remind you of the courage and strength you carry. The nice person\nwill also remind you of how daunting it will be, but tell you to set the bar\nlow - at least for now - so it\u2019s \u2018easier\u2019 to achieve. You know they mean well.\n\nWhen you ask for feedback, the kind person will be warm and constructive in\ntheir feedback. But they will hold nothing back. They understand that the\nprocess of asking for feedback means you trust them enough for them to tell\nyou the truth as they see it, even if it may bruise your ego. The nice person\ndoesn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings, they also will give you warm feedback. But\njust the good one. They don\u2019t see it as their responsibility to tell you the\n\u2018bad\u2019 part. They imagine you\u2019ll eventually hear it - maybe from the market,\nfrom those you serve, or from life.\n\nIf you have to choose between being nice and kind, the latter is a better\noption. The ultimate responsibility we all have is to be kind.\n\n### Subscribe to More! by Damola\n\nBy Damola Morenikeji\n\nDamola's musings, and learnings, published every day-ish.\n\nShare\n\nThe /ai 'manifesto'\n\nTo retain the trust others have in you and your work, tell us how you made use\nof AI in your craft.
