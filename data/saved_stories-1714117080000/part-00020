That\u2019s a TCP header diagram in Lego(TM)\u201d, or perhaps, \u201cHoly\n&^%@! That idiot made a TCP header diagram in Lego(TM)!\u201d, then you\u2019re exactly\nright! This is another one of those wild, wacky ideas that we dreamed up in\nthe middle of one of my SANS classes (note to the SANS staff: shorter breaks\nmight be a good idea). I bet my students never thought I\u2019d actually do it.\n\nOf course, you know I couldn\u2019t stop with just doing the TCP header:\n\nIP Header in Lego(TM)\n\nNow why am I wasting all that space on the building plate in each case? Why so\nyou can put them together of course:\n\nTCP/IP in Lego(TM)\n\nThe use of color here really highlights certain portions of the packet header.\nFor example, the source and destination addresses and ports really jump out.\nBut there are some other, more subtle color patterns that I worked in here.\nFor example, if you look closely you\u2019ll see that I matched the color of the\nACK bit with the blue in the ACK number field. Similarly the colors of the SYN\nbit and the sequence number match, as do the URG bit and urgent pointer field.\n\nActually I wish I had a couple of more colors available. Yes, Lego(TM) comes\nin dozens of colors these days, but they only make 2\u00d78 blocks (aka one\n\u201cLego(TM) Byte\u201d) in six colors: White, Black, Red, Yellow, Blue, and Beige.\n\nLego(TM) Byte, Nibble, and Bit\n\nSo while I tried to use Beige exclusively for size fields, Red for reserved\nbits, Yellow for checksums, and so on, I ultimately ended up having to use\nthese colors for other fields as well\u2013 for example, the yellow sequence number\nfields in the TCP header. Maybe I should have just bought a bunch of \u201cnibbles\u201d\n(2\u00d74 blocks) in other colors and not been so choosy about using full \u201cLego(TM)\nBytes\u201d.\n\n## Serious Fun\n\nCute idea, but is there any practical value? After a lengthy conversation with\nmy inner child (who is generally more mature than my outer persona), I\nrealized that there was a fun learning game we could make out of all this. So\nI labelled all the blocks. Yes, that\u2019s right. I. Labelled. Every. Single.\nBlock. I even did the individual bits:\n\nTCP Header \u201cBits\u201d in Lego(TM). Labelled.\n\nSo the game becomes learning where all the fields are in the various packet\nheaders so that you can re-create the packet diagrams from piles that look\nlike this:\n\nLego(TM) blocks waiting to become TCP header diagram\n\nNow we can teach students how to decode packet headers by letting them play\nwith Legos(TM). And that means we can all write off our Lego(TM) collections\nas a business expense! How cool is that?\n\n## Admit It. You Can\u2019t Wait To Do It Too!\n\nProject Tools\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a hankering to try this out for yourself, it doesn\u2019t take a\nwhole lot. I way overbought on the Lego front: six green base-plates, and 20\n2\u00d78 \u201cLego(TM) Bytes\u201d, 8 \u201cNibbles\u201d (2\u00d74 blocks), and 16 \u201cBits\u201d in each color.\nTotal cost for the Lego(TM) was around US$100 delivered.\n\nLabelling was accomplished with my P-Touch(TM) labeller. 3/8\u2032\u2032 ribbon is\nprecisely the right height to be placed on the side of a Lego(TM) block. It\nalso helps to have a razor blade type tool to help separate the P-Touch(TM)\nlabels from their backing and apply them to the blocks.\n\nAnd of course I have to give a shout-out to the late, great Richard Stevens\nand his biblical tome TCP/IP Illustrated: Vol 1. If you don\u2019t already own this\nbook, buy it. Seriously.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nFinally, to all of you who think I need a life, all I have to say is:\n\nLabelled TTL \u201cLego(TM) Byte\u201d\n\nBaby, I\u2019m living the dream!\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nLessons from the Metasploit DDoSFebruary 17, 2009In \"Information Security\"\n\nXFS (Part 3) \u2013 Short Form DirectoriesMay 25, 2018In \"Forensics\"\n\nXFS (Part 4) \u2013 Block DirectoriesMay 31, 2018In \"Forensics\"\n\nPosted in HumorTagged header diagrams, Lego, TCP/IP\n\n## Published by Hal Pomeranz\n\nIndependent Computer Forensics and Information Security consultant.
