But most of these\nare extracted to be processed and turned into finished products elsewhere,\nsometimes with dire environmental consequences.\n\nProducts such as cobalt, copper and gold are used in increasing quantities in\nrenewable energy production and low-carbon technology such as electric\nvehicles. But if the processing is nearly all done overseas, few of the\neconomic and social benefits will come to Africans themselves, said Mathai.\n\n\u201cHow do we activate value chains in food and agriculture that build wealth for\nsmall farmers?\u201d she asked. \u201cNot commercial agriculture [that just means\ngetting] bigger, bigger, bigger. But how do we get really good at building\nthese sorts of economies for small farmers that are fairer, more equitable,\nthat are about wellbeing?\u201d\n\nA cocoa pod grows on a farm in Ghana. Cocoa beans could be processed into\ncocoa butter in Africa, instead of being exported in their raw form.\nPhotograph: Francis Kokoroko/Reuters\n\nThe answer, she believes, lies in processing more of Africa\u2019s raw materials\nclose to where they are produced. For instance, cocoa beans could be processed\ninto cocoa butter in the African nations where they are grown, instead of\nbeing exported in their raw form, even if turning the butter into chocolate\nstill happens elsewhere.\n\n\u201cBy moving up the value chain, we will be able to generate much more income,\u201d\nshe said.\n\nThis will also make the processes more efficient. \u201cTransporting raw materials\nacross the world is a lot more carbon intensive than transporting a more\nprocessed product. And what it does is create an economy that is much greater\nthan depending on the charity of others,\u201d she said.\n\nAfrican leaders call for equity over minerals used for clean energy\n\nRead more\n\nEconomists and government officials are gathering in Washington DC this week\nfor the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary\nFund, where the future of climate finance and the debt burden of poor\ncountries are likely to be among the hottest topics of debate.\n\nMathai said rich countries should target the climate finance they have\npromised to the poorer world on projects that helped African countries make\nmore use of their resources. \u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity in green\nindustrialisation,\u201d she said.\n\nAfrica has vast potential for generating renewable energy, from the wind and\nsun. This should encourage investors to site their industries there, near\nthese abundant low-carbon power sources, she added. This could be used, for\ninstance, to create genuinely green hydrogen, which is likely to be vital for\nsome heavy industries.\n\n\u201cInstead of thinking, export that energy, why not use manufacture in Namibia?\u201d\nshe asked. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be real opportunities to expand\nmanufacturing. It\u2019s not about charity, it\u2019s about partnership.\u201d\n\nIf these investments are not made in clean energy and manufacturing, Africans\nwill turn instead to fossil fuels, where investors are eager to expand, she\nwarned. \u201cWe will have ourselves to blame if they go the more traditional route\n[of fossil fuels], where finance is more available, because we\u2019re seeing\nfossil fuel proliferation.\u201d\n\nAs the climate heats, swathes of Africa are likely to suffer increasingly from\ndrought, heatwaves and floods. However, some of the continent\u2019s croplands are\nlikely to become even more vital.\n\nHelping people prepare for the impacts of the climate crisis will be essential\nand in Mathai\u2019s view that can best be done by making Africans more prosperous.\n\n\u201cWe have to build resilience that is deep, that is anchored in wealth\ncreation,\u201d she said.\n\nShe gave the example of Nairobi, in Kenya, where many impoverished people\nrecently experienced flooding. \u201cEntire communities were washed away. That\u2019s\nbecause they live on the edge [because of poverty]. If you\u2019re on the edge of\nthe edge, it doesn\u2019t matter how much adaptation you do. We have to build\neconomic muscle.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Africa\n  * Greenhouse gas emissions\n  * Mining (Environment)\n  * Mining (Business)\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Green economy\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
