No part\nof this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing\nfrom the publisher.\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to give candid feedback to a friend or subordinate. Giving it\nto your boss is one of the most difficult things to do\u2014and can get you booted\nif you botch it.\n\nWhy it matters. Very few of us make it through life without running into a\nmoronic, mushy, or mediocre manager. But there are ways to raise concerns\ndirectly, safely, and effectively.\n\nI botched my first stab at it, quite spectacularly. I was at Roll Call, in the\nmid-1990s, when a fellow journalist, Ed Henry, was put in charge of the\nnewsroom. A few of us thought he was wrong for the job, so I impulsively went\nto the bosses, winged it with no forethought, made it way too personal,\npitched myself as an alternative, and . . . lost. Ed\u2019s boss listened politely\n. . . and then sided with Ed. He remained editor.\n\nI did everything the Jim of today would counsel young Jim not to do. Now,\nthirty years later, having watched others do this well and poorly, I see a\nclear blueprint:\n\nSharpen your thinking. What exactly is the boss doing that\u2019s making it harder\nfor you or others to thrive?\n\nDo a gut check. Discuss your issue with a friend, family member, or\nmentor\u2014ideally someone not involved at your company. Lay out your concerns\nwithout hyperbole, then lay out dispassionately the defense your manager might\nmake.\n\nWrite it down. I am a big believer that you can be more precise and measured\nif you put your concerns in writing. Be respectful. Be direct. Say you\nappreciate the chance to share your unvarnished thoughts.\n\nExplain, don\u2019t accuse. You put someone instantly on the defensive if you\nhammer them or question their character. Be very specific, clinical, and\nunemotional in how you frame your concerns.\n\nOffer solutions. No one wants to hear someone simply bitch about problems or\ngrievances. Offer specific solutions or alternative approaches.\n\nLock arms. Make it plain that you want to be part of the solution. People who\nfeel isolated, backed into corners, or judged typically retaliate or hide.\n\nTry Big Think+ for your business\n\nEngaging content on the skills that matter, taught by world-class experts.\n\nRequest a Demo\n\nFollow up. Ask for a follow-up conversation, in person, after they have\ndigested your note, to discuss the next steps. How they respond will give you\na very strong indication of whether the situation is fixable.\n\nGive \u2019em a chance. Change is hard. Watch to see if a correction is made. If\nnot, politely but directly remind them of your note and chat.\n\nTRUTH BOMB. Just because someone gets power does not mean they deserve it. A\nlot of bad or talentless people rise to management by bootlicking or tenure.\n\nConfront reality. Most middle managers, in my experience, are hard to change.\nIf someone does not listen to you respectfully or refuses to change, be ready\nto live with the status quo . . . or quit.\n\nThe bottom line. Great bosses are like firm\u2014but unconditionally\nloving\u2014parents. Embrace them. Bad ones are like duplicitous ex-boyfriends or\n-girlfriends who suck the life out of you. Try to fix it. But if nothing\nchanges, run if you can.\n\nTags\n\nbooksCareer Developmentcommunicationleadershipmanagementproblem solving\n\nTopics\n\nThe Culture\n\nIn this article\n\nbooksCareer Developmentcommunicationleadershipmanagementproblem solving\n\n### Unlock potential in your business\n\nLearn how Big Think+ can empower your people.\n\nRequest a Demo\n\nRelated\n\nBusiness\n\nHow to slay \u201cvampire problems\u201d for better decision-making\n\nAt work we're often asked to be decisive \u2014 but how can we make an informed\nchoice without complete information?\n\nLeadership\n\nSlack\u2019s CEO Stewart Butterfield: These questions could save teams billions of\nhours each year\n\n\"The digital HQ - the digital infrastructure that supports productivity and\ncollaboration - actually became more important than the physical HQ.\"\n\nBusiness\n\nThe science of motivation: 5 simple fixes for team engagement\n\nToo many companies fail to recognize that \u201cthe deepest principle in human\nnature is the craving to be appreciated\u201d \u2014 but the solution is easy.\n\nBusiness\n\nDo you try to avoid your boss?
