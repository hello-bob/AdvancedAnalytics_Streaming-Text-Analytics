Chelsea Jia Feng/Insider\n\nAki Ito\n\n2023-09-26T10:02:01Z\n\nFacebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link\n\nRead in app\n\nHOMEPAGE\n\nNewsletters\n\nLog in\n\nSubscribe\n\nLast month, the data startup Cribl posted a job opening for a people-\noperations analyst. There was nothing particularly eye-popping about the role.\nIt offered a salary of $55,000 to $70,000, required two to four years of\nrelevant experience, and included standard benefits like health insurance,\ndental, and a 401(k). But the position came with an incredibly coveted \u2014 and\nincreasingly rare \u2014 perk in today's job market: It was 100% remote.\n\nWithin the first week, 573 people applied. A week later, another 634\napplications poured in. By the end of the process, more than 1,700 candidates\nhad lined up for the job. The hiring manager at Cribl eventually interviewed\nthree applicants before extending an offer to a lucky winner in Ohio. How\nlucky? The chance of getting picked was 0.06% \u2014 60 times worse than the odds\nof getting into Harvard, about twice as unlikely as catching a foul ball at a\nbaseball game, and on par with having a birthday on February 29.\n\nWelcome to the impossible odds of today's job market for remote work. With\nunemployment near a five-decade low, there are plenty of available positions\nfor those who are still willing to brave the morning commute. But it's a whole\ndifferent situation for job seekers who want to work from home full time. Ask\nany of them and they'll tell you: It's brutal out there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn LinkedIn, only 9% of job postings last month were fully remote, down from a\npeak of 21% in March 2022. Yet the handful of remote listings attracted nearly\nhalf of all applications on the site. On ZipRecruiter, the typical remote\nopening now gets three times as many applicants as in-office roles. That's\nmore than twice as frenzied as the rush for remote jobs at the beginning of\nlast year.\n\n\"We're just seeing so much competition for remote roles,\" says Ashlee\nAnderson, a career coach who specializes in helping people land work-from-home\njobs. \"So many people want them. Everybody got a taste of it during the\npandemic, and now that it's being taken away they really want to hold onto\nit.\"\n\nWhy has it gotten so hard to land a remote job? Three factors are driving the\ncrunch. First, many large companies have ordered their remote employees to\nreturn to their cubicles, prompting scores of office-averse professionals to\nlook for roles that will allow them to keep working from home. Second, those\nsame companies are now listing almost every new job opening as in-person or\nhybrid, sparking a sharp drop in the number of remote roles. And third,\nthere's been a dramatic slowdown in tech, the industry that supercharged the\nboom in remote work. The result: Too many WFH wannabes vying for too few\nremote spots.\n\nWhen jobs become scarce, things get ugly. People are so desperate to work from\nhome that some have taken pay cuts as steep as 20% to land a remote role.\nOthers have accepted offers that mark a significant step down in their\ncareers. Applicants are racing to enroll in certification programs, hoping to\nstand out from the remote-hungry pack. But given how prolonged and\ndemoralizing the search can be, many have been forced to give up on the\nprospect of remote work, resigning themselves once more to the imperatives of\noffice life.\n\nAngel Medina hasn't given up yet, even though it's been four months since he\ngot laid off from his work-from-home job as a customer-service supervisor at\nVerizon. So far, he's applied for nearly 40 remote openings on Indeed \u2014 some\nof which had more than 1,000 applicants, and one that had more than 4,000.\nHe's never seen anything like it. \"It's not the same as two to three years\nago, when you used to get to pick and choose your job,\" Medina says. \"There's\nso many competitors ahead of you. There's so many people applying for the same\njob.\"\n\n> \"At the software maker Mural, the average job opening is getting 620\n> applicants \u2013 up by more than 200% from last year.\"\n\nThe few remaining employers that continue to offer remote jobs have been\noverwhelmed by the surge of interest. The software maker Atlassian has seen a\n93% jump in applications for the average job opening from last year. At Cribl\nit's increased by 150%. And at Mural, another software maker, it's up by more\nthan 200% \u2014 averaging about 620 applicants per remote job. At Remote, an HR\nplatform that helps companies hire and pay remote workers around the world,\ntwo recent openings \u2014 for a data analyst and a back-end engineer \u2014 each\nattracted more than 4,000 candidates.\n\n\"We just get so many applications,\" says Barbara Matthews, the company's chief\npeople officer. \"Sometimes we have to close them after four or five days.\"\n\nWhile the tsunami of applications can be a challenge for small startups, it's\nalso creating a huge opportunity for them. As corporate giants like Google and\nAmazon order everyone to return to the office, employers like Remote and Mural\ncan take their pick of the RTO refugees when they post a job opening. \"It\nmeans less competition for us, and greater access to talent,\" says Lisa\nNielsen, the senior vice president of people at Cribl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so few openings, candidates for remote jobs are being forced to hustle\nlike never before. They're setting up alerts on job sites so they can be among\nthe first to submit their applications. They're joining subreddits, Slack\nchannels, and Discord servers to trade tips and leads. They're directly\nmessaging recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn. And to stand out from\nthe crowd, they're getting creative. At Cribl, applicants have submitted poems\nabout goats and recorded videos of themselves with goats \u2014 a play on the fact\nthat the company's internal mascot is a goat.\n\nOne thing applicants should not do? Use ChatGPT. \"I've seen a lot of folks use\nAI to generate the intros on the top of their CVs,\" Matthews says. \"If you're\nsifting through CVs for two hours, you do notice a lot of these consistencies,\nwhich is not a good thing.\"\n\nThe mad scramble for remote work isn't likely to subside anytime soon.\nAnderson, the career coach who specializes in remote jobs, actually expects\nthe competition to intensify in the coming months, as big companies step up\ntheir RTO campaign. This month, Meta began enforcing its three-days-a-week\noffice mandate, warning that repeat offenders would be fired. And Comcast is\nnow requiring employees to come in four days a week, up from three.\n\n\"As more and more companies ask their workers to come back into the office,\"\nAnderson says, \"2024 is when we're really going to see even more competition\nfor these remote roles.\" The dream of remote work, it appears, will soon be\nmore remote than ever.\n\nAki Ito is a senior correspondent at Insider.\n\n#### About Discourse Stories\n\nThrough our Discourse journalism, Business Insider seeks to explore and\nilluminate the day\u2019s most fascinating issues and ideas.
