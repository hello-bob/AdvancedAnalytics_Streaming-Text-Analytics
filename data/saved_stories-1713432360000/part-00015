It\u2019s powered by batteries and electric actuators, no more messy\nhydraulics. It exceeds human performance in terms of both strength and\nflexibility. And for the first time, Boston Dynamics is calling this humanoid\nrobot a product. We\u2019ll take a look at everything that Boston Dynamics is\nannouncing today, and have even more detail in this Q&A with Boston Dynamics\nCEO Robert Playter.\n\nBoston Dynamics\u2019 new electric humanoid has been simultaneously one of the\nworst and best kept secrets in robotics over the last year or so. What I mean\nis that it seemed obvious, or even inevitable, that Boston Dynamics would take\nthe expertise in humanoids that it developed with Atlas and combine that with\nits experience productizing a fully electric system like Spot. But just\nbecause something seems inevitable doesn\u2019t mean it actually is inevitable, and\nBoston Dynamics has done an admirable job of carrying on as normal while\nbuilding a fully electric humanoid from scratch. And here it is:\n\nIt\u2019s all new, it\u2019s all electric, and some of those movements make me slightly\nuncomfortable (we\u2019ll get into that in a bit). The blog post accompanying the\nvideo is sparse on technical detail, but let\u2019s go through the most interesting\nparts:\n\n> A decade ago, we were one of the only companies putting real R&D effort into\n> humanoid robots. Now the landscape in the robotics industry is very\n> different.\n\nIn 2010, we took a look at all the humanoid robots then in existence. You\ncould, I suppose, argue that Honda was putting real R&D effort into ASIMO back\nthen, but yeah, pretty much all those other humanoid robots came from research\nrather than industry. Now, it feels like we\u2019re up to our eyeballs in\ncommercial humanoids, but over the past couple of years, as startups have\nappeared out of nowhere with brand new humanoid robots, Boston Dynamics (to\nmost outward appearances) was just keepin\u2019 on with that R&D. Today\u2019s\nannouncement certainly changes that.\n\n> We are confident in our plan to not just create an impressive R&D project,\n> but to deliver a valuable solution. This journey will start with Hyundai\u2014in\n> addition to investing in us, the Hyundai team is building the next\n> generation of automotive manufacturing capabilities, and it will serve as a\n> perfect testing ground for new Atlas applications.\n\nBoston Dynamics\n\nThis is a significant advantage for Boston Dynamics\u2014through Hyundai, they can\nessentially be their own first customer for humanoid robots, offering an\nimmediate use case in a very friendly transitional environment. Tesla has a\nsimilar advantage with Optimus, but Boston Dynamics also has experience\nsourcing and selling and supporting Spot, which are those business-y things\nthat seem like they\u2019re not the hard part until they turn out to actually be\nthe hard part.\n\n> In the months and years ahead, we\u2019re excited to show what the world\u2019s most\n> dynamic humanoid robot can really do\u2014in the lab, in the factory, and in our\n> lives.\n\nWorld\u2019s most dynamic humanoid, you say? Awesome! Prove it! On video! With\nouttakes!\n\n> The electric version of Atlas will be stronger, with a broader range of\n> motion than any of our previous generations. For example, our last\n> generation hydraulic Atlas (HD Atlas) could already lift and maneuver a wide\n> variety of heavy, irregular objects; we are continuing to build on those\n> existing capabilities and are exploring several new gripper variations to\n> meet a diverse set of expected manipulation needs in customer environments.\n\nNow we\u2019re getting to the good bits. It\u2019s especially notable here that the\nelectric version of Atlas will be \u201cstronger\u201d than the previous hydraulic\nversion, because for a long time hydraulics were really the only way to get\nthe kind of explosively powerful repetitive dynamic motions that enabled Atlas\nto do jumps and flips. And the switch away from hydraulics enables that extra\nrange of motion now that there aren\u2019t hoses and stuff to deal with.\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty clear that the new Atlas is built to continue the kind of\nwork that hydraulic Atlas has been doing, manipulating big and heavy car\nparts. This is in sharp contrast to most other humanoid robots that we\u2019ve\nseen, which have primarily focused on moving small objects or bins around in\nwarehouse environments.\n\n> We are not just delivering industry-leading hardware. Some of our most\n> exciting progress over the past couple of years has been in software. In\n> addition to our decades of expertise in simulation and model predictive\n> control, we have equipped our robots with new AI and machine learning tools,\n> like reinforcement learning and computer vision to ensure they can operate\n> and adapt efficiently to complex real-world situations.\n\nThis is all par for the course now, but it\u2019s also not particularly meaningful\nwithout more information. \u201cWe will give our robots new capabilities through\nmachine learning and AI\u201d is what every humanoid robotics company (and most\nother robotics companies) are saying, but I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re there yet,\nbecause there\u2019s an \u201cokay but how?\u201d that needs to happen first. I\u2019m not saying\nthat it won\u2019t happen, just pointing out that until it does happen, it hasn\u2019t\nhappened.\n\n> The humanoid form factor is a useful design for robots working in a world\n> designed for people. However, that form factor doesn\u2019t limit our vision of\n> how a bipedal robot can move, what tools it needs to succeed, and how it can\n> help people accomplish more.\n\nAgility Robotics has a similar philosophy with Digit, which has a mostly\nhumanoid form factor to operate in human environments but also uses a non-\nhuman leg design because Agility believes that it works better. Atlas is a bit\nmore human-like with its overall design, but there are some striking\ndifferences, including both range of motion and the head, both of which we\u2019ll\nbe talking more about.\n\n> We designed the electric version of Atlas to be stronger, more dexterous,\n> and more agile. Atlas may resemble a human form factor, but we are equipping\n> the robot to move in the most efficient way possible to complete a task,\n> rather than being constrained by a human range of motion. Atlas will move in\n> ways that exceed human capabilities.\n\nThe introductory video with the new Atlas really punches you in the face with\nthis: Atlas is not constrained by human range of motion and will leverage its\nextra degrees of freedom to operate faster and more efficiently, even if you\npersonally might find some of those motions a little bit unsettling.\n\nBoston Dynamics\n\n> Combining decades of practical experience with first principles thinking, we\n> are confident in our ability to deliver a robot uniquely capable of tackling\n> dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks in real applications.\n\nAs Marco Hutter pointed out, most commercial robots (humanoids included) are\nreally only targeting tasks that are dull, because dull usually means\nrepetitive, and robots are very good at repetitive. Dirty is a little more\ncomplicated, and dangerous is a lot more complicated than that. I appreciate\nthat Boston Dynamics is targeting those other categories of tasks from the\noutset.\n\n> Commercialization takes great engineering, but it also takes patience,\n> imagination, and collaboration. Boston Dynamics has proven that we can\n> deliver the full package with both industry-leading robotics and a complete\n> ecosystem of software, services, and support to make robotics useful in the\n> real world.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to building a successful robotics company than building a\nsuccessful robot. Arguably, building a successful robot is not even the\nhardest part, long term. Having over 1500 Spot robots deployed with customers\ngives them a well-established product infrastructure baseline to expand from\nwith the new Atlas.\n\nTaking a step back, let\u2019s consider the position that Boston Dynamics is in\nwhen it comes to the humanoid space right now.\n\nThe new Atlas appears to be a reasonably mature platform with explicit\ncommercial potential, but it\u2019s not yet clear if this particular version of\nAtlas is truly commercially viable, in terms of being manufacturable and\nsupportable at scale\u2014it\u2019s Atlas 001, after all. There\u2019s likely a huge amount\nof work that still needs to be done, but it\u2019s a process that the company has\nalready gone through with Spot. My guess is that Boston Dynamics has some\ncatching up to do with respect to other humanoid companies that are already\nentering pilot projects.\n\nIn terms of capabilities, even though the new Atlas hardware is new, it\u2019s not\nlike Boston Dynamics is starting from scratch, since they\u2019re already\ntransferring skills from hydraulic Atlas onto the new platform. But, we\nhaven\u2019t seen the new Atlas doing any practical tasks yet, so it\u2019s hard to tell\nhow far along that is, and it would be premature to assume that hydraulic\nAtlas doing all kinds of amazing things in YouTube videos implies that\nelectric Atlas can do similar things safely and reliably in a product context.\nThere\u2019s a gap there, possibly an enormous gap, and we\u2019ll need to see more from\nthe new Atlas to understand where it\u2019s at.\n\nAnd obviously, there\u2019s a lot of competition in humanoids right now, although\nI\u2019d like to think that the potential for practical humanoid robots to be\nuseful in society is significant enough that there will be room for lots of\ndifferent approaches. Boston Dynamics was very early to humanoids in general,\nbut they\u2019re somewhat late to this recent (and rather abrupt) humanoid\ncommercialization push. This may not be a problem, especially if Atlas is\ntargeting applications where its strength and flexibility sets it apart from\nother robots in the space, and if their depth of experience deploying\ncommercial robotic platforms helps them to scale quickly.\n\nBoston Dynamics\n\nAn electric Atlas may indeed have been inevitable, and it\u2019s incredibly\nexciting to (finally!) see Boston Dynamics take this next step towards a\ncommercial humanoid, which would deliver on more than a decade of ambition\nstretching back through the DARPA Robotics Challenge to PETMAN. We\u2019ve been\npromised more manipulation footage soon, and Boston Dynamics expects that\nAtlas will be in the technology demonstration phase in Hyundai factories as\nearly as next year.\n\nWe have a lot more questions, but we have a lot more answers, too: you\u2019ll find\na Q&A with Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter right here.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Q&A: Boston Dynamics on Atlas\u2019s Parkour Skills \u203a\n  * Boston Dynamics Retires Its Legendary Humanoid Robot \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Atlas | Boston Dynamics \u203a\n\nboston dynamicshumanoid robotsatlasrobotics\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nEvan Ackerman\n\nis a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum.

The robots had to demonstrate mobility, sensing, and\nmanipulation\u2014which, with painful slowness, they did.\n\nThese robots were clearly research projects, but DARPA has a history of\ncatalyzing technology with a long-term view. The DARPA Grand and Urban\nChallenges for autonomous vehicles, in 2005 and 2007, formed the foundation\nfor today\u2019s autonomous taxis.
