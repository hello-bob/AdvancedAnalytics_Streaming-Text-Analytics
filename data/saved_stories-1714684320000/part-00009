The US hasn\u2019t had a national climate policy, unlike in Europe, and yet\nwe are likely to get rid of coal much faster than in Europe.\u201d\n\nThe demolition of a trio of concrete stacks at the Navajo Generating station\nnear Page, Arizona, on 18 December 2020. Photograph: George Hardeen/AP\n\nCoal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels in terms of its planet-heating\nemissions, still accounting for more than half of the carbon pollution coming\nfrom the US power sector even as it has been eclipsed in the past decade by\ngas and, for the first time last year, by renewables such as solar and wind\nenergy.\n\nIn 2023, coal plants accounted for 16% of the US\u2019 electricity, down from more\nthan half during a peak in 1990. Feaster said that daily data shows that\nstretches of 2024 so far have seen coal dip below a 15% share. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing\nto see how quickly solar and batteries are being built and how low coal\u2019s\nmarket share is getting,\u201d he added.\n\nScientists have warned that the world must urgently ditch coal, followed by\nother fossil fuels, to help avoid worsening impacts from the climate crisis\nand on Tuesday the G7 group of advanced economies, which includes the US,\nagreed to end the \u201cunabated\u201d use of coal by 2035.\n\nThe new EPA rules allow coal plants to use technologies to achieve such\nabatement, primarily carbon capture and storage (or CCS), which traps planet-\nheating emissions at source and buries them to avoid pollution billowing into\nthe atmosphere. However, despite years of support and subsidies from the US\ngovernment, CCS remains costly and is unproven as a way to slash emissions.\n\nTrump holds up a \u2018Trump Digs Coal\u2019 sign as he arrives to speak during a Make\nAmerica great again rally in Huntington, West Virginia in August 2017.\nPhotograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nExperts say that most coal plant operators, faced with a mostly aging fleet of\nfacilities, some of them 70 years old, will likely just shut down rather than\nspend $1bn or more a plant for CCS technology. Some mining will remain as coal\nis still used for the making of steel, as well as for export overseas.\n\nBut in the power sector, the US is already forecast to retire half of its\ncoal-fired generation by 2026, compared to 2011, and the new regulations,\nwhich also contain requirements to crack down on mercury pollution, wastewater\ndischarge and coal ash disposal, means \u201cwe will see some coal retirements\u201d\nbeyond this, acknowledged Michael Regan, administrator of the EPA.\n\n\u201cThis is a major step that really raises questions about the future of the\ncoal industry in the US,\u201d said Barry Rabe, an environmental policy expert at\nthe University of Michigan. \u201cIf you\u2019re a utility are you really going to\npursue a technology that has been talked about for a long time but is still\nlargely untested and is quite expensive?\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you\nwhat\u2019s happening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Daniel Brenner/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nMorrisey, who successfully convinced the supreme court to limit the EPA\u2019s\nability to force power companies to switch to renewables under the Clean Air\nAct in 2022, said that another court challenge is on its way and that \u201cwe\nexpect that we will once again prevail in court against this out-of-control\nagency.\u201d\n\nG7 agree to end use of unabated coal power plants by 2035\n\nRead more\n\nCoal\u2019s supporters warn the US is barreling towards an electricity \u201creliability\ncrisis\u201d, something the EPA denies, as soaring electricity use, in part due to\nthe electrification of things like cars as well as data processing for\ncryptocurrency mining and artificial intelligence, places a strain upon the\ngrid.\n\nHowever, the diminishment of the coal industry, along with the upcoming\nretirement of some its most vocal ongressional allies, means that coal appears\nrather friendless in the US. Even Trump, who promised but failed to deliver a\ncoal renaissance while in the White House, has largely ignored coal in his\n2024 campaign, instead lavishing his support upon the US\u2019 booming oil and gas\nsector.\n\n\u201cWe hear much less from the former president about coal now, it\u2019s more about\n\u2018drill, baby drill\u2019\u201d, said Rabe. \u201cTrump will probably win the big coal\nproducing states anyway, while Pennsylvania is one of the largest gas states\nand will be essential to any path to the presidency. I think we are going to\nbe hearing a lot more about oil and gas, rather than coal.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US news\n  * Coal\n  * Biden administration\n  * Fossil fuels\n  * Pollution\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
