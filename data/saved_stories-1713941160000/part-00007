(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File)\n\n2 of 2 |\n\nThis April 21, 2024, image provided by Jessica Damiano shows a garden rake in\nuse to clear leaves on Long Island, New York. (Jessica Damiano via AP)\n\nBy JESSICA DAMIANO\n\nUpdated 2:23 PM UTC, April 23, 2024\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n\nLink copied\n\n  * Email\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * X\n\n  * Reddit\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Flipboard\n\n  * Print\n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to help my mother clear leaves the old-fashioned way\n\u2014 with a rake.\n\nThese days, I don\u2019t see many rakes in my neighborhood. It seems everyone has a\nleaf blower or a landscaper who uses one, often at ungodly hours, which\ndisrupts humans as well as wildlife.\n\nThe near-constant cacophony has led many communities around the country to\nrestrict or completely ban gas blowers, which typically are louder than\nelectric or battery-operated models, and pollute more, too. Some\nmunicipalities offer residents rebates or trade-in programs to replace the gas\nequipment with electric.\n\n## HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL WOES\n\nThe noise isn\u2019t merely a nuisance. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, prolonged exposure to noise louder than 70 decibels\nmay damage your hearing. Gas-powered leaf blowers can register as high as 100\ndecibels at the source (the levels decrease with distance).\n\nMost electric models range from 59 to 70 decibels. For context, a motorcycle\nengine registers at about 95 decibels; normal conversation is around 50. And\nit\u2019s worth noting that each 10 decibel increase is not merely 10 points louder\nbut 10 times louder, so 80 decibels is a tenfold increase over 70.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRom-com author Emily Henry knows the secret to having a healthy relationship\nwith love\n\nPhish fans are famously dedicated. What happens when they enter the Sphere?\n\nGet better sleep with these 5 tips from experts\n\nGas-powered leaf blowers also expel fumes and pollutants like carbon monoxide.\nBoth gas and electric blowers stir up particulate matter, dust, mold, pollen,\nand pathogen-containing bird and animal feces into the air that we (and\ninsects and wildlife) breathe. Folks with respiratory issues or allergies may\nbe especially sensitive.\n\nBoth types also blow away mulch, contribute to soil erosion and disrupt\ndelicate ecosystems. The soil depletion makes plants more vulnerable to\ndisease and infestations, which could lead to higher pesticide usage.\n\nThe machines\u2019 forceful blasts \u2013 which travel up to 200 mph, can displace,\ninjure and kill pollinators and other insects. Birds, too, can become startled\ninto changing their feeding, nesting and mating habits.\n\n## SO, WHAT TO DO?\n\nShare this information with your friends and neighbors. If you hire a\nlandscaper, express your concerns and ask them to use electric equipment. If\nenough people do that, the demand will hopefully effect change.\n\nIf you have the time and inclination, rake. On hard surfaces, use a broom.\nThose are sustainable alternatives that also provide good exercise and some\npeaceful time alone with your thoughts.\n\nClear the lawn, but consider leaving leaves where they fall in beds and\nborders.\n\nLeaf sweepers, which operate like push mowers, capture and collect leaves,\ntwigs and other garden debris in an attached bag. This offers an additional\nadvantage over blowers, which simply move debris out of the way or into a pile\nthat needs to be gathered before reuse or disposal. Electric models are also\navailable.\n\nIf you must use a blower, opt for an electric or cordless rechargeable model\nas a cleaner, quieter compromise. The initial price tag might be higher, but\nyou\u2019ll quickly recoup the cost with savings on gas and oil.\n\nAnd if a gas-powered model is truly your only option, do yourself, your\nneighbors, and the birds and bees a favor by running it sparingly and only at\nhalf-throttle.\n\n\u2014-\n\nJessica Damiano writes regular gardening columns for the AP and publishes the\naward-winning Weekly Dirt Newsletter.
