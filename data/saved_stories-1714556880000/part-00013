at some of America\u2019s largest companies have said that consumers feel the pinch of higher prices.\n  * Their remarks come as sticky inflation poses a challenge for Main Street, Wall Street and the Federal Reserve.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s employee giving change to a customer.\n\nJeffrey Greenberg | UIG | Getty Images\n\nSome of America\u2019s best-known corporations are saying their consumers are being\npinched by inflation as prices continue rising.\n\nInflation has dominated corporate America\u2019s discourse over the past three\nyears following the pandemic-induced easing of monetary policy and trillions\nof dollars in Covid relief. Though the pace of price growth has cooled since\nthe Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in early 2022, consumers are\nstill feeling the squeeze \u2014 and often tightening purse strings \u2014 as costs\ncontinue climbing.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that broad-based consumer pressures persist around the world,\u201d\nMcDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the fast-food chain\u2019s earnings call\nearly Tuesday. \u201cConsumers continue to be even more discriminating with every\ndollar that they spend as they faced elevated prices in their day-to-day\nspending.\u201d\n\nSticky inflation has created a dark cloud over how everyday Americans perceive\nthe health of the economy. Consumer confidence in April hit its lowest level\nsince mid-2022 as high prices remained top of mind, according to data released\nTuesday by the Conference Board.\n\nWorker pay has continued rising, as evidenced by first-quarter employment cost\nstatistics released Tuesday. But so, too, have the prices paid by the typical\nconsumer, biting into the extra income from those higher wages.\n\nTo be sure, the rate of inflation has fallen significantly. The consumer price\nindex \u2014 a broad basket of goods and services \u2014 rose at an annual rate of 3.5%\nin March compared with the same month a year ago.\n\nThat\u2019s far below the 40-year high of 9.1% seen in mid-2022 but remains above\nthe 2% goal set by the Fed, whose officials have pointed to stubborn inflation\nas the reason for keeping interest rates higher.\n\nAnd that tenacious 3.5% annual growth is souring economic sentiment: Even\nafter a period of runaway inflation, prices don\u2019t actually fall. That\u2019s a\nproblem for McDonald\u2019s and a host of other firms serving customers who are\nfeeling sticker shock.\n\n## \u2018Under pressure\u2019\n\nAt McDonald\u2019s, that was evidenced by same-store sales growth coming in\nslightly below Wall Street expectations. Kempczinski said that the Chicago-\nbased company must be \u201claser-focused\u201d on affordability to bring in diners as\nprices push away low-income consumers.\n\nExecutives at 3M, the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it Notes that also\nreported Tuesday, told analysts it\u2019s seeing \u201ccontinued softness in consumer\ndiscretionary spend.\u201d While 3M earnings and revenue topped expectations in the\nfirst quarter, management said it anticipates consumer spending this year to\nbe \u201cmuted.\u201d\n\nNewell Brands CEO Chris Peterson on April 26 joined the chorus of executives\npointing to inflation as the main force bedeviling their businesses. Though\nthe owner of Coleman and Rubbermaid products exceeded analyst forecasts for\nthe first three months of the year, the company issued soft guidance for\ncurrent-quarter earnings and said revenue is likely to decline.\n\n\u201cThe categories we compete in remain under pressure with consumers continuing\nto carefully manage their discretionary spend as the cumulative impact of\ninflation on food, energy and housing cost has outpaced wage growth,\u201d Peterson\nsaid.\n\nBut not all consumer-facing companies are feeling the heat.\n\nColgate-Palmolive CEO Noel Wallace said on April 26 that volume growth has\nlargely returned as \u201cinflation became more benign and as pricing started to\nstabilize.\u201d\n\nAt Coca-Cola, management has seen a greater emphasis on value, saying the\npurchasing power of lower-income consumers has taken a hit. Still, executives\nsaid on the soft drink maker\u2019s earnings call Tuesday morning that the American\nconsumer, across income strata, \u201cremains in good shape.\u201d\n\n\u2014 CNBC\u2019s Robert Hum and Amelia Lucas contributed to this report.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Tuesday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Tesla, Apple, Live Nation, Boeing, Coinbase, Amazon & more\n  * Dividend stocks are poised to outperform, says Bank of America.
