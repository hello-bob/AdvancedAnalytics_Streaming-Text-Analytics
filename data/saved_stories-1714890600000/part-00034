Here\u2019s\nwhy. Warning: Spoilers for the book and film 'The Name of the Rose'.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRemember Jean-Jacques Annaud\u2019s film The Name of the Rose, based on Umberto\nEco\u2019s historical mystery novel of the same name?\n\nIn it, a Franciscan friar William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) heads to an\nabbey northern Italy to investigate a mysterious death \u2013 which turns into a\nseries of untimely demises \u2013 linked to Aristotle\u2019s \"Second Book of Poetics\",\nwhich describes how comedy can be used to teach.\n\nBelieving jocularity to be instruments of the Devil, some devious bastard (we\nwon\u2019t spoil that part here) poisons the pages to stop the spread of dangerous\nideas, and those reading the book would ingest the poison as they licked their\nfingers to turn the pages.\n\nWell, imagine that scenario. Just less nefarious, taking place in France\nand... different.\n\nIndeed, not one but four books have been removed from France\u2019s national\nlibrary (which contains a collection of more than 16 million books), over\nconcerns that their covers may be laced with poison. Arsenic, to be precise.\n\nUniversity of Delaware researchers have singled out the 19th century volumes,\nwhich all have green covers. Arsenic was commonly used to for its colour\npigmentation and the arsenic-containing green pigments - called Paris green,\nor Scheele\u2019s green (after a German-born chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele) - were\nfrequently utilized for books.\n\nIn case you were fearing that you might be in danger, the four books, printed\nin Victorian-era Britain, include the two volumes of Edward Hayes' \"The\nBallads of Ireland\" from 1855, an 1856 bilingual anthology of Romanian poetry\nby Henry Stanley, and a 1862-1863 book of the Royal Horticultural Society.\n\n\"We have put these works in quarantine and an external laboratory will analyse\nthem to evaluate how much arsenic is present in each volume,\" said a\nspokesperson from the National Library of France.\n\nThe list of potentially hazardous titles was put together by the Poison Book\nProject, run by researchers from the University of Delaware in collaboration\nwith Delaware's Winterthur Museum. The PBP team has tested hundreds of book\ncovers for heavy metals since 2019, and has drawn up a list of titles that are\npotentially dangerous.\n\nThe Poison Book Project says books laced with the toxin should be stored with\ncaution and could present a health risk to those handling them.\n\nThe World Health Organization warns long-term exposure to inorganic arsenic,\nmainly through drinking water and food, can lead to skin lesions and skin\ncancer, but it makes no mention of contact with objects containing it.\n\nThe National Library of France said it would also examine other green covered\nbooks beyond the PBP list. The PBP website states that arsenic can also be\nfound in green leather and paper covers, and that more than half of the\nclothbound 19th-century books analyzed contain lead in the book cloth.\n\n\u201cAnalysis of a range of bookcloth colors has identified iron, copper, and\nzinc, which, while technically heavy metals by density, are generally\nconsidered not to be toxic,\u201d reads the website. \u201cAnalysis has also identified\nthe following highly toxic heavy metals: arsenic, chromium, lead, and\nmercury.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened, as books have also been removed\nin Germany earlier this year, as a precaution over possible arsenic\ncontamination.\n\nBooks from the University of Bonn were identified as contaminated with\narsenic, with more and more universities taking green-colored books stemming\nfrom the 19th century off their shelves.\n\nNo news on whether they also had The Name of the Rose as a distant echo.\n\nShare this articleComments\n\n## You might also like\n\nNow playing Next\n\nCulture news\n\n### The best things to do and see (or watch) in Europe this week\n\nNow playing Next\n\nCulture news\n\n### Drake and Adele back on TikTok as Universal backs licensing deal\n\nNow playing Next\n\nCulture news\n\n### Dua Lipa\u2019s \u2018Radical Optimism': Euronews Culture's verdict\n\nquarantine Literature France poison Books\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Top stories\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## The best things to do and see (or watch) in Europe this week\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## European court supports Italy's claim to bronze statue from LA museum\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Everything you need to know about this year's Met Gala\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Film of the Week: 'Pendant ce temps sur Terre' ('Meanwhile on Earth')\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Dua Lipa\u2019s \u2018Radical Optimism': Euronews Culture's verdict\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Most read\n\n### The Best Film of All Time revealed by Rotten Tomatoes\n\n### Who will win Eurovision 2024?

He\ntook the journey on the Titanic with his 18-year-old newlywed wife Madeleine\nAstor and the socialite Molly Brown.\n\nAs his wife and Brown were ferried onto lifeboats, Astor was told he had to\nwait until all women and children were safe before joining. He stepped aside\nand smoked a cigarette as they were taken to safety.\n\n  * Pocket watch and violin case of ill-fated Titanic players to go on auction\n  * Infamous 'Titanic' floating door sells for staggering \u20ac663,000 at Hollywood movie auction\n\nWallace Hartley's violin case Credit: Henry Aldridge & Son\n\nAlongside Astor's watch, other notable items up for auction included the\nvalise that held the violin famously played by the band leader, Wallace\nHartley, as the ship sank, and a pocketbook detailing the Titanic\u2019s voyages.\n\nThe valise sold for \u00a3360,000 (\u20ac421,000), and the violin itself was auctioned\nfor \u00a31.1 million (\u20ac1.28m) by the same auction house in 2013. Until Astor\u2019s\npocket watch was sold, the violin held the record as the highest-selling item\nfrom the Titanic.\n\n\u201cWallace Hartley's violin is the most iconic piece of Titanic memorabilia ever\nsold at auction,\u201d said auctioneer Andrew Aldridge. \u201cHowever, it would not have\nsurvived if it were not for this valise case made of English coach hide. The\nlong straps would have been used by Wallace to strap the bag to himself as the\nTitanic was sinking.
