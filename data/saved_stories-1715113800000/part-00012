That puts us just inside the Van Allen\nradiation belt. It's an awesome opportunity for us to get some data, but\nreally it's about pushing beyond our comfort zone.\"\n\nThe Polaris Dawn mission does not have a launch date, but SpaceX officials\nconfirmed that it is now the next crewed mission the company will fly. There\nare likely several scheduling issues at play, but it's possible the mission\ncould launch within the next six to eight weeks.\n\n## Flying high\n\nAfter liftoff from Florida, Isaacman said Dragon will complete seven orbits\nwith a maximum altitude of about 1,400 km, which is about twice as high as any\ncrewed mission has flown since 1972. After that the vehicle will descend to a\nmore circular orbit of about 700 km and prepare for a spacewalk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides Isaacman, who flew to space for the first time in September 2021 as\nthe commander of the all-civilian Inspiration 4, the crew of this mission\nincludes a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel and experienced pilot named\nScott Poteet, and two SpaceX engineers, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon. This will\nbe the first time that any employee of SpaceX has ever flown into space.\n\nAfter settling into the lower orbit, the crew will prepare for a spacewalk.\nThey will don spacesuits, and the atmosphere inside the Dragon spacecraft will\nbe vented into space. Then Isaacman and Gillis will exit the spacecraft, with\ntheir suits connected to Dragon's air and other consumables by an umbilical.\n\nEnlarge / Polaris Dawn astronaut and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis shows off\nthe new spacesuit.\n\nSpaceX\n\nAlthough government astronauts have conducted hundreds of spacewalks over the\nlast 60 years, no private citizen has ever undertaken one.\n\n\"This is important because we are going to get to the Moon and Mars one day,\nand we're going to have to get out of our vehicles, and out of the safety of\nthe habitat to explore and build and repair things,\" Isaacman said. SpaceX has\nalready said it is working on a second generation of the suit for operations\non the Moon and Mars.\n\nThe company spent about two years designing the first generation of this\nextravehicular activity spacesuit, an upgrade from its current flight suit. It\nhas been extensively tested in vacuum chambers and other facilities at\nlocations such as NASA's Johnson Space Center. Isaacman shared more details\nabout the suits in a subsequent conversation with former Canadian astronaut\nChris Hadfield.\n\nSpaceX has also modified Dragon for the spacewalk. Stu Keech, the vice\npresident of Dragon at SpaceX, said a structure named \"Skywalker\" has been\nattached to the spacecraft near the hatch as a mobility aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Is this guy legit?\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss Isaacman as a space fanboy living out his\nspaceflight dreams after he got rich. (According to Forbes, the founder of\nShift4 Payments is worth an estimated $1.5 billion.) Absolutely, he loves to\nfly. He owns and regularly pilots a MiG-29\u2014one of only a few of these Soviet\nfighter aircraft operating in the United States. Spaceflight is the ultimate\nboundary for people who love to fly.\n\nBut Isaacman appears to be in this for more than thrills. On his first two\nspaceflights, Isaacman sought out crewmates from diverse backgrounds and made\ncharitable donations a major component of each mission. I have had a number of\nconversations with Isaacman over the last five years, and he has consistently\nemphasized the goal of opening spaceflight to more people. For example, if\nhumans are ever to have a truly sustained presence in space, spacewalks must\nbe commonplace. Hence, non-NASA astronauts need to start making them. His\nfunding of Polaris Dawn helped SpaceX focus on developing suits for such a\npurpose down the line.\n\nDuring the social media event on Saturday, I asked Isaacman about the risks\nentailed by this mission. By flying higher than a conventional spaceflight,\nventing the cabin, and performing a spacewalk, he and the crew were taking on\na new set of risks.\n\n\"We've gotten really comfortable going from point A to B to an extraordinary\nfloating international laboratory, but I think humankind's ambitions are\nbeyond that,\" Isaacman said of the International Space Station. \"We're going\nto encounter different things. The risk is different when you vent the vehicle\ndown to vacuum, and you're in a spacesuit. But I think these are all positive\nsteps in the direction of goodness towards, you know, humankind's interest to\nexplore our Solar System and beyond.\"\n\nIsaacman has clearly bought in to the idea of space settlement. He's\npersonally taking risks to help achieve that vision, investing a significant\nchunk of money and time for training. It is a brave and bold and important\nthing to be doing.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n35\n\nEric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering\neverything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy, and author of\nthe book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
