It\u2019s the third largest retailer in the\nworld, treats its employees better than most, always has the best price, and\ntrades at almost 40x earnings (Google is floating around 30x earnings).\nThey\u2019ve discovered a unique business model that guarantees customers the best\nprices, and lets them prioritize their employees over almost anything else.\n\nOn the other hand I\u2019ve never felt more depressed than the couple of times I\u2019ve\ntried on clothes from Costco. It's emblematic of a lifeless approach to living\nwhere the highest priority is efficiency and quantity, screw how it makes you\nfeel.\n\nTheir warehouses suck the life out of the lots they occupy with their drab,\nlifeless, windowless walls and unending parking lots.\n\nIt\u2019s factory line living where economies of scale invade your personal life\nand you sit at the end of a conveyor belt filling up your car.\n\nYou buy stuff in quantities you don\u2019t need (even outside of the package size,\nyou never know when an item will suddenly vanish forever\u2014I\u2019m sitting on 3\nmassive containers of their raw Wisconsin honey because of this fear), and you\nend up using way more of the stuff you buy because the supply feels endless\n(before we got a Costco membership I calculated that a package of tissues from\nCostco should last us an entire year but they end up being consumed in a\nfraction of that time because we just use more tissues now).\n\nAnd yet, I love it. Shopping at Costco makes you feel richer. Growing up you\nalways had the rich friend with a fridge full of fun drinks. Buying drinks\nalways felt like something I shouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t do. But at Costco I trust\nthat the price is so good that I find myself filling up my car with Topo Chico\nmineral water and GT Dave kombucha. It's not only great prices, but items that\nyou trust will be good (compare this to the experience of shopping on Amazon\nin 2023 where you always feel like there's a 50% chance you're about to get\nscammed).\n\nBusinesses can only really broadcast one message at a time. An identity is a\nhard thing to have, and even harder to stick to. Because an identity always\ncomes with obviously frustrating shortcomings. But there\u2019s also power in an\nidentity. It gives you permission to proudly accept all those shortcomings,\nbecause they\u2019re what drive your advantages. Costco sucks, but it also\nabsolutely rocks.\n\n### Member discussion\n\nBenedict's Blog \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
