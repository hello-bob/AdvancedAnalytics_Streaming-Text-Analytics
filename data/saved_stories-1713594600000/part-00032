These\nhypothetical particles, known as tachyons, aren't likely to be real \u2014 but\nthey're not some hokey bit of sci-fi, either. The potential for their\nexistence is something physicists have been giving serious thought for\ndecades, raising fundamental questions about the nature of causality.\n\nAs detailed in a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed study, the researchers posit that\ntachyons are what make up dark matter, an unobservable \u2014 and despite being\nwidely considered to exist by scientists, technically hypothetical \u2014 substance\nthat is thought to account for around 85 percent of all matter in the\nuniverse.\n\nBecause we can only see dark matter's substantial gravitational influence, we\ndon't know what it actually is, leaving the door open to all kinds of\npossibilities that are worth considering.\n\n## Growing Problem\n\nAs it turns out, a tachyon-filled cosmos does a good job of explaining the\nuniverse's ongoing expansion, according to the researchers.\n\nIn the standard cosmological model, the existence of so-called dark energy is\nused to explain the expansion of the universe. Also unobservable, dark energy\nis thought to dwarf even dark matter, accounting for up to 70 percent of the\nentire universe.\n\nWithout it, the sheer gravity of all the mass in the universe would eventually\nslow down its expansion. Instead, scientists have observed the rate of\nexpansion is actually accelerating \u2014 driven by, it's hypothesized, dark\nenergy.\n\nBut if tachyons are real and pervade the universe as dark matter, they could\nalso potentially explain this acceleration. The researchers found that, in\nsuch a scenario, tachyonic dark matter would initially decelerate the\nuniverse's expansion, before reversing and causing it to accelerate like we\nsee now. They call this an \"inflected\" expansion.\n\n## Imperfect Match\n\nSo far, their evidence to support this comes from observations of Type Ia\nsupernovae, a type of supernova \u2014 in which a dying star collapses and explodes\n\u2014 caused in certain types of binary star systems.\n\nThese distinct supernovae serve as standard candles, cosmic objects with a\nknown luminosity that allow astronomers to use as a reference point to\ncalculate distances in space. It was by using Type Ia supernovae as standard\ncandles, in fact, that scientists first confirmed that the expansion of the\nuniverse was accelerating.\n\nWhen the researchers compared their tachyonic model to sample data from the\nType Ia supernovae, they found that the two are \"comfortably consistent with\none another.\"\n\nOf course, this is a very limited application of the model. It raises\nintriguing possibilities for followup research, sure, but it's a far cry from\nproving that tachyons actually exist. Nonetheless, it illustrates just how\nmuch we have left to learn about the fundamental phenomena that govern the\ncosmos.\n\nMore on cosmology: New Paper Claims Dark Matter Doesn't Exist at All\n\nShare This Article\n\nIn the Dark\n\nNew Paper Claims Dark Matter Doesn't Exist at All\n\nMar 18, 2:12 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nBangs and Bounces\n\nScientists Say Stuff Might Have Been Happening Before the Big Bang\n\n11.5.22, 12:43 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nDark Secrets\n\nScientists Just Detected the Oldest Dark Matter Ever Observed\n\n8.3.22, 9:30 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nWalled Up\n\nScientists Say Space Is Filled With Invisible Walls\n\nUpdated 5.23.22, 8:59 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
