Between one and two hours later, Hofmann experienced slow and gradual\nchanges in his perception. He asked his laboratory assistant to escort him\nhome. As was customary in Basel, they made the journey by bicycle. On the way,\nHofmann's condition rapidly deteriorated as he struggled with feelings of\nanxiety, alternating in his beliefs that the next-door neighbor was a\nmalevolent witch, that he was going insane, and that the LSD had poisoned him.\nWhen the house doctor arrived, however, he could detect no physical\nabnormalities, save for a pair of widely dilated pupils. Hofmann was\nreassured, and soon his terror began to give way to a sense of good fortune\nand enjoyment, as he later wrote:\n\n> ... Little by little I could begin to enjoy the unprecedented colors and\n> plays of shapes that persisted behind my closed eyes. Kaleidoscopic,\n> fantastic images surged in on me, alternating, variegated, opening and then\n> closing themselves in circles and spirals, exploding in colored fountains,\n> rearranging and hybridizing themselves in constant flux ...\n\nThe events of this first LSD trip, now known as \"Bicycle Day\", after the\nbicycle ride home, proved to Hofmann that he had indeed made a significant\ndiscovery: a psychoactive substance with extraordinary potency, capable of\ncausing significant shifts of consciousness in incredibly low doses. (The term\ntrip was first coined by US Army scientists during the 1950s when they were\nexperimenting with LSD.)^[9] Hofmann foresaw the drug as a powerful\npsychiatric tool; because of its intense and introspective nature, he could\nnot imagine anyone using it recreationally.^[10] Bicycle Day is increasingly\nobserved in psychedelic communities as a day to celebrate the discovery of\nLSD.^[11]^[12]^[13]\n\nThe celebration of Bicycle Day originated in DeKalb, Illinois, in 1985, when\nThomas B. Roberts, then a professor at Northern Illinois University, invented\nthe name \"Bicycle Day\"^[a] when he founded the first celebration at his\nhome.^[14] Several years later, he sent an announcement made by one of his\nstudents to friends and Internet lists, thus propagating the idea and the\ncelebration. His original intent was to commemorate Hofmann's original,\naccidental exposure on April 16, but that date fell midweek and was not a good\ntime for the party, so he chose the 19th to honor Hofmann's first intentional\nexposure.^[14]^[15]^[16]\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Dr. Hofmann asked Roberts why he had called it Bicycle Day instead of LSD Day: \"I told him that the bicycle was a more concrete image than a chemical structure, and in America there is a famous poem that marks the start of our revolution in 1775 that makes a parallel with his ride...\"^[14]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Coffey, Rebecca. \"Bicycle Day And the 1962 Harvard Experiment That Showed Psilocybin Can Create Lasting, Positive Spiritual Change\".
