Concretized by uber engineer Susan J. Fowler\u2019s blog post a\nyear ago, we have seen increasing awareness of the fact that unfortunately,\nwomen in tech experience rough treatment across the board.\n\nThe #metoo movement over the last year has drawn attention to and added\nanother layer of complexity, particularly for fields that have already been\ndifficult for women, but it has also spawned backlash. For example, there was\nan emboldened response by self-righteous men in tech, encapsulated in a New\nYork Times article, entitled \u201cPush for Gender Equality in Tech? Some Men Say\nIt\u2019s Gone Too Far,\u201d and in Google employee James Damore, whose memo proposed\nthat women are genetically inferior at engineering, and propelled him into\nfame.\n\nMost of us like to think that we understand why it\u2019s important to have a\nhealthy, diverse workplace. Certainly, the nature of technical work such as\ncoding and artificial intelligence demonstrates that the equitable involvement\nof women and other individuals from diverse backgrounds contribute value. But\nwhen it comes to initiating change in the workplace, it can be tough to know\nwhere to start.\n\nHere, I provide some concrete suggestions for folks who want to help \u2013 from\nthe C suite, to the developer who sits next to you, to the institutional\nsupport staff. Admiring the problem and appointing a \u201cdiversity committee\u201d\naren\u2019t good enough. The day-to-day experience of these workplaces is\nparamount, and there is an amalgamation of many factors that we can control.\n\n## CEO Level\n\nAs the CEO, you may not be focused on the day-to-day as much, but hiring and\nretention are crucial to a successful company. Industries like tech that\nexperience a dearth of women and minorities are particularly likely to benefit\nfrom improvements in:\n\n1) Provision of family leave for maternity, paternity and other family issues.\n\nThe United States is far behind other countries on this point. Even the US\nfederal government doesn\u2019t provide any maternity or paternity leave,\ndesignated as such. After giving birth, employees are permitted to use 6 weeks\nof sick leave (8 weeks if you have a C-Section) in lieu of maternity leave and\nafter that, must use their annual leave-- in other words, vacation. Vacation\nand sick leave are also only accrued over time; so if employees are fairly new\nto the government, they wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to earn the leave.\nPaternity leave is just as crucial as maternity leave, since in about half of\nAmerican families led by a married couple, both parents work.\n\n2) Pregnancy parking and other accessibility issues\n\nThis is one that Sheryl Sandberg mentioned in her book, Lean In. It wasn\u2019t\nuntil she became an executive that she realized that there was no maternity\nparking. Part of her point was recognizing that there had been plenty of\njunior employees--and support staff in the cafeteria for example-- who had not\nbeen in a position to raise the issue. In addition to nursing mothers\u2019 rooms,\nthere is a variety of other accessibility needs to which men might have the\nluxury of being blind.\n\n3) Don\u2019t schedule retreats that conflict with working mothers or caregivers.\n\nNot just for children but also informal care to spouses, parents, parents-in-\nlaw, friends and neighbors, women make up an estimated 66% of caregivers. The\naverage caregiver is a 49 year old woman who works outside the home and\nprovides 20 hours per week of unpaid care to her mother. Corporate retreats or\noutside activities, from happy hour to kickball leagues or golf games, can put\na disproportionate strain on caregivers who need those hours for their \u201csecond\nshift.\u201d Even those termed voluntary are often times that determine who gets\ncozy with the boss and who gets promoted, or sold to the client.\n\n4) Don\u2019t create culture in which off-color jokes are acceptable.\n\nSure, there are some jerks in the workplace, anywhere you go. But turning a\nblind eye to rude behavior, even in small instances, is an isolating signal to\nwomen and minorities. Those jokes are often at the expense of those who aren\u2019t\nin a position to speak up, so even if we\u2019re laughing along, don\u2019t assume we\nfind it funny \u2013 it may be a survival mechanism. Even if \u201cShe\u2019s cool with it,\u201d\nas a CEO, it\u2019s your responsibility to set the tone. Oh, and you\u2019ll have the\nadded benefit of not participating in a \u201chostile work environment\u201d that might\neven be illegal.\n\n## Coworker level\n\nOk, so you\u2019re not the CEO. But as a colleague, there are ways that you can\nhave a strong impact on the experience of women in the workplace.\n\n5) Shine theory\n\nAnn Friedman articulated shine theory in an article in 2013. She suggests that\nwomen (and, I would extend it to men) should befriend powerful women, because\nthe shine from their success will rub off and propel those around them. It is\na contrast from \u201cqueen bee syndrome\u201d, where a woman (or a man) assumes that\nonce you have one powerful woman, that\u2019s \u201cenough\u201d and where the \u201cqueen bee\u201d\n(powerful woman) herself assumes that there is only room for one. In shine\ntheory, we assume that powerful and empowered women beget more of the same,\nand that it is good for the organization as a whole.\n\n6) Amplification\n\nA tool that was popularized by the Obama White House, amplification starts\nfrom the reality that women often raise an idea that gets ignored, until a man\nreiterates it--and gets the credit. In fact, research shows that women are\ninterrupted more, by both women and men. Amplification suggests that women\n(and, I would extend it to men) make a point to repeat it when a woman makes a\nkey point \u2013 and credit it back to her. Subtle inequalities like interruption\nand credit-stealing are hard to point to, but easy to identify in patterns\nonce we are attuned; and subtle tools to combat it may have significant\nripples \u2013 and reverberations, as coworkers return the favor.\n\n7) Don\u2019t schedule happy hours for after hours because this is hardest on moms.\n\nWhen a man leaves the office early to take care of the kids, he\u2019s a good dad.\nWhen a woman leaves for the same reason, she isn\u2019t prioritizing work. The\ndouble standard is particularly hazardous because women do tend to do more of\nthe household work, including but not exclusive to child raising. We know that\nwomen still do a \u201csecond shift\u201d at home and we pay for it, not only\nmetaphorically but literally: the disproportionate work at home corresponds to\na gender pay gap surfacing during child-bearing and child-rearing years.\n\nHappy hours can be tough for a mom who has daycare restrictions, while dads\nare more likely to have flexibility because moms are still more commonly the\nprimary caregiver. Consider scheduling group social activities for breakfast,\nlunch, or day-time coffee.\n\n8) Create a culture of whistleblowing and anti-harassment as the norm. Be\naware of off-color jokes.\n\nMaybe white men don\u2019t consider it their \u201cjob\u201d to care about women and\nminorities\u2019 comfort, but they\u2019re short-sighted. A man may be best positioned\nto raise issues (even anonymously), because women and minorities fear\nreprisal. Men are also in the best position to correct an off-color joke or to\nescalate an issue if it rises to a level of discomfort. They\u2019re less\nvulnerable institutionally and they may be perceived to be more neutral. This\nincludes correcting the conversation when women or the target of the joke\naren\u2019t present-- resist the \u201cin-group\u201d jokes.\n\n## Institutional level (HR, Operations, and Chief of Staff)\n\nDon\u2019t stop at diversity committees, diversity retreats, and diversity\nmentoring. This isn\u2019t a problem for women and minorities to solve. It\u2019s a\ncore, foundational issue that requires institutional buy-in.\n\n9) Be aware of coded language selecting for male traits in your hiring\nlanguage.\n\nRecruiters and human resources folks may not realize that they are using terms\nof art that select for white men. There are helpful tools online, including\nthis one, where you can post your job advertisement to help understand the\ngender coded under and over tones. Maybe algorithms can even help overcome\nbiases in the hiring process.\n\n10) Be honest rather than aspirational about hiring requirements\n\nIt\u2019s important that hiring managers are aware of how imposter syndrome factors\nin. Imposter syndrome, which disproportionately affects women, means that\nwomen may feel that they don\u2019t belong or don\u2019t have enough credentials, even\nif they do. In the hiring environment, this plays out because it turns out\nthat a woman is much less likely to apply for a job where she does not have\nthe exact qualifications, whereas a man will reason, \u201cI\u2019ll learn them.\u201d (Or\neven may delusionally believe that he already possesses them\u2014the Dunning-\nKruger effect is the cognitive bias where a person mistakenly believes his\ncognitive ability to be greater than it is.)\n\nSo, if you\u2019re asking for 10 years of experience but really you\u2019re open to 6\nyears plus education in the area, consider being explicit about your\nexpectations and your flexibilities on credentialing.\n\n11) Standardize metrics where possible, to avoid promoting mediocre men\n\nAs Harvard Business Review has reported, the problem with women rising in\nfields might be the fact that higher ranks are clogged with mediocre men. To\navoid allowing mediocre men to be promoted, be aware of the confidence gap and\nminimize the effect of politics or self-promotion upon promotion decisions and\nattempt to standardize promotion potential and metrics for success.\n\n12) Publicize where to take escalations\n\nSometimes, an employee has an issue that cannot go to an immediate supervisor,\nfor a variety of potential reasons (most commonly: it involves the\nsupervisor). Create an avenue for employees to raise legitimate concerns, and\nto ensure that the company documents and enforces the legal protections around\nsome issues, like harassment-- legal protections like non-retaliation. Put\nposters in the bathrooms and other public places so employees don\u2019t have to go\nhunting for the information, and preserve confidentiality or be transparent\nabout your reporting obligations to the company.\n\nConsider implementing a feedback tool like an app where employees can report\nharassment or assault without choosing to escalate it, so that the institution\ncan correlate data and find patterns and pain points. The technology exists,\nbut it stands to be adopted at the institutional level\n\n13) Anonymous feedback cuts both ways. Be conscious of ways it can undermine\nrelationships.\n\nSure, some legally-sophisticated employees know that the HR department exists\nto preserve the institution. But it\u2019s a moral hazard to pretend that the\norganization is creating a feedback channel when the executors of it intend to\nprotect the corporation at the expense of a specific person (or many, over\ntime). Amazon has come under fire for a tool that allows employees to\nanonymously undercut fellow employees, and the anonymization clearly plays a\nrole in the brutality.\n\nAlso, be aware of the double edged sword HR may be creating with \u201canonymous\u201d\nfeedback. I have a friend who attended a mandatory \u201cdiversity\u201d day at a tech\ncompany and then was punished for expressing her experiences. I know that the\ninstitution needs to protect itself, but don\u2019t ask for feedback if you don\u2019t\nhave an avenue to re-integrate information. It\u2019s disingenuous, and a company\u2019s\nreputation is enduring and far-reaching. Don\u2019t force employees to dig their\nown graves.\n\n14) Get specific about your diversity hiring goals, and measure success.\n\nThere\u2019s a common saying: the best way to hire women in tech, is to hire women\nin tech. Make specific goals for the organization, and measure against them.\nIn addition to being the right thing to do, hiring and retaining a diverse\nworkforce is a financially smart investment: diverse companies outperform and\nare more profitable. In industries like tech where thought itself is a\ncommodity, diversity of thought-- the fact that women and minorities have\ndifferent life experiences and therefore think (and code) differently,\nmatters.\n\nWe owe it to ourselves to get in the trenches on this one.
