United States \u2014\n\n# TikTok and its Chinese owner sue US government over \u201cforeign adversary\u201d law\n\n## Law curtails \"massive amounts of protected speech,\" TikTok and ByteDance\nallege.\n\nJon Brodkin - 5/7/2024, 7:08 PM\n\nEnlarge\n\nGetty Images | Chesnot\n\n#### reader comments\n\n116\n\nTikTok and its owner ByteDance today sued the federal government to block the\n\"Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications\" law that would prohibit TikTok in\nthe US if the company isn't sold to a non-Chinese firm. The complaint in the\nUS Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit alleges that the law\nis unconstitutional and asks for a court order prohibiting enforcement.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance say the law \"would allow the government to decide that a\ncompany may no longer own and publish the innovative and unique speech\nplatform it created. If Congress can do this, it can circumvent the First\nAmendment by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any\nindividual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down.\"\n\nThe law will \"silenc[e] the 170 million Americans who use the platform to\ncommunicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere,\" TikTok and ByteDance\nalleged.\n\n\"By banning all online platforms and software applications offered by 'TikTok'\nand all ByteDance subsidiaries, Congress has made a law curtailing massive\namounts of protected speech,\" the lawsuit said. \"Unlike broadcast television\nand radio stations, which require government licenses to operate because they\nuse the public airwaves, the government cannot, consistent with the First\nAmendment, dictate the ownership of newspapers, websites, online platforms,\nand other privately created speech forums.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## ByteDance ordered to sell within 270 days\n\nThe \"Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\"\nwas approved by Congress and signed into law by President Biden on April 24.\nThe law requires TikTok to be blocked in the US unless ByteDance sells the\nsocial network division to an entity that isn't \"controlled by a foreign\nadversary.\"\n\nThe law gives ByteDance 270 days to sell TikTok to another entity, but Biden\ncan extend the deadline by up to 90 days if a sale is in progress. If there's\nno sale, app stores in the US would have to drop TikTok, and Internet hosting\nfirms would be prohibited from providing services that enable distribution of\nTikTok in the US.\n\nThe same divestiture-or-sale requirement could apply to other applications\nsubsequently designated as being controlled by foreign adversaries, but only\nTikTok and ByteDance are named in the bill. Law professors who spoke to Ars\nlast month correctly predicted that TikTok and ByteDance would raise\nobjections under the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause,\nand the prohibition on bills of attainder.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance claim the law violates \"the Fifth Amendment's Due Process\nClause because it singles Petitioners out for adverse treatment without any\nreason for doing so\" and \"effects an unlawful taking of private property\nwithout just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment's Takings\nClause.\" TikTok and ByteDance also say the US law \"is an unconstitutional bill\nof attainder\" because it singles out the plaintiffs \"for legislative\npunishment.\"\n\nThe US would try to justify the law on national security grounds. US lawmakers\nhave alleged that the Chinese Communist Party can weaponize TikTok to\nmanipulate public opinion and access user data.\n\nThe TikTok lawsuit names Attorney General Merrick Garland as the defendant. We\ncontacted the Department of Justice today and will update this article if it\nprovides a comment on the lawsuit.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n116\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
