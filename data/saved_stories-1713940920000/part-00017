Threads is a direct rival of X, formerly Twitter,\nwhich has struggled to maintain its user base since Elon Musk acquired the\nplatform about 18 months ago.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nNow, Threads has more daily users in the US than X, a trend that's been\nongoing since December, when Threads became Apple's most downloaded app.\n\n\"Threads DAUs in the US passed X in December 2023 and it has not looked back,\"\nThomas Grant, Apptopia's VP of research, said. It's currently the third most\ndownloaded free app on the Apple App Store, while X is in 41st place. In the\nGoogle Play Store, Threads is in 12th place among free apps, while X is in\n44th place.\n\nSo far in April, Threads has averaged an estimated 28 million daily active\nusers, so people who have opened the app at least once in a 24-hour period.\nThat's a roughly 55% increase in DAUs from December when Threads averaged an\nestimated 18 million users each day.\n\nDAUs in the US have been choppier on X, and fewer than Threads overall during\nthe same time period. In April so far, X has averaged 22 million DAUs, a usage\nrate that's 21% lower than Threads. DAUs on X have been relatively flat for\nthe last three months but are up since December when the platform saw 17\nmillion DAUs. That was the first month Threads beat X on DAUs in the US.\n\nRelated stories\n\nUsers of X remain down overall compared to before Musk took over the platform.\nAccording to Sensor Tower estimates, daily users of the X app worldwide are\ndown 19% compared to October 2022, the month that Musk took over Twitter. X\nDAUs worldwide for the first quarter of 2024 are down 14% year-over-year.\n\nStill, Threads has work to do to unseat X as the most popular microblogging\napp and hit Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's goal of getting to 1 billion users on\nthe platform. And promotional work with Taylor Swift may not be the way to go\nabout it.\n\nLast week, when Swift used Threads for the first time to promote her latest\nalbum, receiving several bespoke features to do so, Threads gained \"no\nnoticeable lift\" in users, according to Sensor Tower. An estimate of daily\nusers from Apptopia for the week also shows no gain in Threads users.\n\nX's monthly active users in the US handily beat Threads. According to Apptopia\nestimates, Threads US MAUs have been around 100 million for the last three\nmonths, although Zuckerberg in February said total MAUs were closer to 130\nmillion. Either way, X MAUs are just over 140 million in the US alone,\nalthough users have fluctuated over the last year between 135 million MAUs and\nthe current 140 million.\n\nNevertheless, Zuckerberg seems bullish on Threads and has spoken highly of it\nin every quarterly earnings call since its launch, saying in February it's \"on\ntrack to be a major success.\"\n\n\"I'm optimistic we can keep the pace of improvements and growth going, and\nshow that a friendly discussion-oriented app can be as widely used as the most\npopular social apps,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nMeta reports first quarter results on Wednesday.\n\nAre you a Meta or X employee, someone with a tip or insight to share?
