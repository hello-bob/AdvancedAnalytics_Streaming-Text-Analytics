Traditionally, profilers have relied solely on statistical\n> methods, which lead to high false positives and false negatives. For\n> example, they may incorrectly flag missing values where such absences are\n> expected and normal based on the data's semantic context. To address these,\n> we introduce Cocoon, a data profiling system that integrates LLMs to imbue\n> statistical profiling with semantics. Cocoon enhances traditional profiling\n> methods by adding a three-step process: Semantic Context, Semantic Profile,\n> and Semantic Review. Our user studies show that Cocoon is highly effective\n> at accurately discerning whether anomalies are genuine errors requiring\n> correction or acceptable variations based on the semantics for real-world\n> datasets.\n\nSubjects:| Databases (cs.DB)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.12552 [cs.DB]  \n(or arXiv:2404.12552v1 [cs.DB] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.12552arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Zezhou Huang [view email] [v1] Fri, 19 Apr 2024 00:13:25 UTC (306 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Cocoon: Semantic Table Profiling Using Large\nLanguage Models, by Zezhou Huang and 1 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.DB\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
