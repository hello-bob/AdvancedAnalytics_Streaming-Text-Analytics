It was likely just him and Tony at this\npoint. So, with the fury of all desperate men backed into a corner, he stormed\ninto Tony's room, and splintered his draftsman's board into pieces, dooming\nhis future studies.\n\nOne of these guys. Sometimes colloquially called a \u201cT-board\u201d.\n\nI don't know exactly what Tony did between 17 and 20, when he boarded a plane\nto the United States and hence we arrive at his second remarkable trait,\nbravery. Presumably he worked full time on the farm, and watched his more\ncompetent hurling buddies fly the coop. How did he cope with the anger? With\nthe seething fury he must have felt every time he saw that aged face? I don't\nknow. Maybe - probably - he drank, a little, or a lot. Maybe they fought.\nThat's what I did, when Tony put me myself through a similar situation. But\nthat's not a story for this letter.\n\nThree people boarded that plane in 1979 to attend Tony's oldest brother's\nwedding. Two people were on the return flight. Tony arrived at Logan\nInternational Airport with his parents and his luggage, stepped outside, ate a\nhot dog for the first time, and decided he wasn't going back. This man is more\nAmerican than any American I have ever met. If you ever cross him on the\nstreet, ignore everything he says about politics. Corner him and ask him what\nthe greatest country on Earth is. He will point to the ground at your feet.\n\nYou do not know true fear until you have tried emigrating like this. I\nunderwent a pale imitation of it when I stepped off my flight from the US to\nFinland in 2021, shortly after the COVID-19 borders reopened. Where I had a\nfresh degree in engineering, a fiancee, in-laws eager to help, and the\neventual expectation of a valid EU passport, my father had one and only one\nthing going for him: His siblings, who had by and large settled down in\nBoston. Some of them had green cards. Most did not. I know the process for\ngetting a green card was nowhere close to the bureaucratic hell it is today,\nbut I still have no idea how he ended up getting his own.\n\nWhat I do know is this single act of courage, this decision to null-and-void\nthe ancient contract between father and son and strike out on his own, knowing\nfull well the abandonment may well destroy any relationship he had to his own\nparents, set me and my siblings up for options and abundance unparalleled in\nthe modern world. A Promethean defiance. May we all have such cojones.\n\nBravery and work ethic served this man in his twenties much more directly than\nthey did his teens. He took odd jobs, whatever he could. He saved money. He\nstayed with brothers and sisters. At one point he took out a $1000 loan, about\n$3800 in today's money, just to prove to the banks he could pay it off. This\nset him up for his first mortgage much later in the future. The first mortgage\nset him up for the second, the second, the third.\n\nHe took night classes. He piled his entire Gaelic football team into an\nelectrical van and drunk-drove 4 hours from Boston down to New York City for a\ngame with his best friends. (N.B., this Substack is not titled \"People You\nShould Be Exactly Like.\") He became an electrician. It turns out you can do a\nlot in your twenties when you're used to 80 hour work weeks. His twenties\nbecame his thirties.\n\nHe tried dating an American girl. She broke up with him after their third date\nto the same bar where he and all his construction buddies hung out because he\nnever had time for her. He swore off American girls and dated an Irish girl.\nLater that girl became my mother. He married her, age 35.\n\nHe hurt his back.\n\nIt is 1999. I am five years old. It is the third night in a row I have been\nkept up by bleeding, eczematic skin. I am listening to mom and dad shouting at\neach other over their mortgage and construction bills at the kitchen table. He\nhasn't been able to work for a while.\n\nI think about mom telling me if I don't apply the Vaseline, which only makes\nmy skin itchier, I will keep bleeding and get infected and die. I think that\ndoesn't sound so bad.\n\nThere is only so much a man can take, both physically and mentally, before he\nstarts to falter. That's true of my father, and that's true of me. Something\napproximating a herniated spinal disc flattened him, and for the rest of my\nlife I would see him spend at least an hour every evening lying flat on his\nback using a special device that progressively stretched his back out at the\nknees to fix himself up good enough to get to sleep. The sports stopped. The\nwork stopped. And patient as he tried to be with me, a difficult child in the\nbest of times, it was obvious the pressure was getting to him.\n\nHence we arrive at Tony's third remarkable trait: Self moderation. It turns\nout an occasional booze cruise after a football match in your twenties doesn't\nmean you'll turn into an alcoholic. Despite everything he was going through, I\nnever once saw my father drunk in our own house, to say nothing of the other\npainkillers he could have found on the streets of Boston.\n\nPerhaps I should underline this point further. Our lives are in some sense\ndefined much more by what we choose not to do, rather than what we do. I chose\nnot to apply for Y Combinator this weekend, because I have a language to learn\nin my spare time, darn it. I don't even want a 1% chance of being thrown off\nthat course before I reach a level of fluency I'm happy with. It would be\ncheating my future self, who thought we had a good thing going with this whole\nFinland thing.\n\nNow we can imagine what kinds of alcoholic tendencies quasilegal Irish\nconstruction workers in the 1980s had (third date to the same bar, man,\nreally?). So there must have came a time where he chose between cheating his\nfuture self and lightening up on the sauce. Maybe it was gradual, maybe it was\nall at once. Maybe it wasn't even conscious. But the fact remains that this\nman knew the rest of the bottle. And even in his hours of greatest weakness,\nhe kept saying No. No, no, no, no, no.\n\nEven when he was out of work, Tony still had some rays of hope to reach for,\ndim and refracted though they may be. I started elementary school - and I\nturned good at it! No matter which country you hail from, an immigrant\nparent's greatest dream is to have a kid who takes what the new country offers\nfor all it's worth, especially one whose own education was splintered before\nhis eyes. I first dreamed of being a scientist, and quickly switched to just\nknowing I would be some flavor of engineer as soon as I learned what they\nactually did. I had more than my fair share of problems, but at least he could\ntell himself \"This one will be fine once he leaves the coop, I just have to\nmake it there.\"\n\nWith consistent treatment, many meetings with specialists, and aggressive self\nmoderation, the disc turned from impossibly painful to very painful to only\nmoderately painful to stand up with. Our old sportsman ere long quickly picked\nup golf as a hobby, finding its long walks and controlled swings to be a much\nbetter compliment now - I'm told the golf course helped him meet a few of his\nwealthier clients as well. The old houses I got dragged to on Saturdays to\nwatch him rip copper wiring out of became newer, and larger, and further out,\nto areas like Canton and Weston. Even I started to get interested in what he\nwas up to, although I pretended to deny it every time.\n\nTony returned to work probably in the early 2000s. Whereas before he disbanded\na burgeoning construction crew of his own because he couldn't stand the\npaperwork taking him out of the field, now he started to take on apprentices\nmore frequently, sharing his decades of knob-and-tube wiring knowledge with\nthem. I like to imagine that the people who worked with and under my father\nall found the experience valuable, including, much later, my own younger\nbrother, when he was getting his own electrician's license.\n\nSomething unexpected happened after the turn of the century: The Boston\nhousing market revved into overdrive, and those three houses Tony bought in\nthe bad part of town filled with the Greeks and the homosexuals ended up\nturning him into a rather wealthy man. You wouldn't guess this by looking at\nhim, of course. He doesn't wear expensive clothes, and he has the opposite of\nexpensive tastes in anything except maybe golf clubs and his wife's car.\n\nHence we arrive to Tony's fourth remarkable trait, and the one I wish to close\non: His steadfast devotion to my mother. (Disclaimer: It is possible, though\nIMO unlikely, that they have since separated since last I saw them. If so, I\nam speaking purely of the time I knew them.)\n\nI saw a few divorces around me growing up, one of them acrimonious. I heard\nthe vitriol of those early frantic conversations about money, and was\nconvinced for a long time growing up that my parents were two steps away from\ngetting a divorce themselves, and that it would be ugly. I was happily and\nutterly mistaken to think this. All it took was quasi-illegally emigrating to\nmarry the woman of my dreams myself to get to the point where that looks\nobviously foolish.\n\nI can't recall once hearing my father even jokingly insult my mother, or take\nher name in vain, or call her any kind of slur. When as a teenager I would\nharp on about what I perceived to be her worst faults, he patiently backed me\nup and reminded me of her good sides. To my jumbled-up mind, I thought this\nhad to be a joke. How can this man not see these things? Why didn't he choose\nsomeone less like this, at least!?\n\nMany years later, when their and our relationship hit twin rock bottoms, she\ntook off her ring and handed it to him. (They worked it out later.) He asked\nme, being the only person around at the time, to join him at a bar, where he\ndrunk two shots and talked about it. I had a beer. Then a third. I listened to\nhim whimper. My chest felt resident to an icy, pitiless fog. I kept mum, let\nhim talk, exercised remarkable trait #3 as best I could. All the while, little\ncunt I was, I kept thinking \"You deserve this.\"\n\nNo, he didn't. And I may never get the chance to apologize now, for that\nnight. I get it now.\n\nI don't know exactly what Tony did between 17 and 20, when he boarded a plane\nto the United States and hence we arrive at his second remarkable trait,\nbravery. Presumably he worked full time on the farm, and watched his more\ncompetent hurling buddies fly the coop. How did he cope with the anger?
