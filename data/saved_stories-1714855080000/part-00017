Many phenomena that happen on Earth\u2014such\nas rain, hurricanes, and auroras\u2014also occur on other planets in our Solar\nSystem if the conditions are right. Now we have evidence from outside our\nSolar System that one particularly strange exoplanet might even be displaying\nsomething close to a rainbow.\n\nAppearing in the sky as a halo of colors, a phenomenon called a \"glory\" occurs\nwhen light hits clouds made up of a homogeneous substance in the form of\nspherical droplets. It might be the explanation for a mystery regarding\nobservations of exoplanet WASP-76B. This planet, a scorching gas giant that\nexperiences molten iron rain, has also been observed to have more light on its\neastern terminator (a line used to separate the day side from the night side)\nthan its western terminator. Why was there more light on one side of the\nplanet?\n\nAfter observing it with the CHEOPS space telescope, then combining that with\nprevious observations from Hubble, Spitzer, and TESS, a team of researchers\nfrom ESA and the University of Bern in Switzerland now think that the most\nlikely reason for the extra light is a glory.\n\n## Seeing the light\n\nOver three years, CHEOPS made 23 observations of WASP-76B in both visible and\ninfrared light. These included phase curves, transits, and secondary eclipses.\nPhase curves are continuous observations that track a planet\u2019s complete\nrevolution and show changes in its phase or the part of its illuminated side\nthat is facing the telescope. The telescope may see more or less of that side\nas the planet orbits its star. Phase curves can determine the change in the\ntotal brightness of the planet and star as the planet orbits.\n\nSecondary eclipses happen when a planet passes behind its host star and is\neclipsed by it. The light seen during such an eclipse can later be compared\nwith the total light both before and after the occultation to give us a sense\nof the light that\u2019s reflected off the planet. Hot Jupiters like WASP-76B are\ncommonly observed through secondary eclipses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhase-curve observations can continue while the planet is eclipsing its star.\nWhile it was observing the phase curve of WASP-76B, CHEOPS saw a pre-eclipse\nexcess of light on its night side. This had also been seen in TESS phase-curve\nand secondary-eclipse observations that had been made earlier.\n\n## End of the rainbow?\n\nAn advantage of WASP-76b is that it is an ultra-hot Jupiter, so at least its\nday side does not have the clouds and hazes that often obscure the atmospheres\nof cooler hot Jupiters. This makes atmospheric emissions much easier to\ndetect. That we had already observed an asymmetry in iron content between the\nday-side and night-side terminators, discovered in a previous study, made the\nplanet especially intriguing. There was not much gaseous iron in the upper\natmosphere of the day-side limb compared to that of the night-side limb. This\nis probably because it rains iron on the day side of WASP-76b, which then\ncondenses into clouds of iron on the night side.\n\nObservations from Hubble suggested that thermal inversion\u2014when the air near\nthe surface of a planet begins cooling\u2014was occurring on the night side.\nCooling on that side would cause iron that had previously condensed into\nclouds, rained down onto the day side, and then evaporated from the intense\nheat to condense again. Drops of liquid iron can then form clouds.\n\nThese clouds are critical since light from the host star, reflecting off these\ndrops in those clouds, can create the effect of a glory.\n\n\"Explaining the observation with the glory effect would require spherical\ndroplets of highly reflective, spherically shaped aerosols and clouds on the\nplanet\u2019s eastern hemisphere,\" the researchers said in a paper recently\npublished in Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\nGlories have been seen off Earth before. They are also known to form in the\nclouds of Venus. Just like WASP-76b, more pre-eclipse light was observed on\nVenus, so while a glory is all but definite for the exoplanet, future\nobservations with a more powerful telescope could help determine how similar\nthe phenomenon on WASP-76 is to that on Venus. If they match, this will be the\nfirst glory ever observed on an exoplanet.\n\nIf future research figures out a definite way to tell whether this is really a\nglory, these phenomena could tell us more about the atmospheric makeup of\nexoplanets, depending on the kinds of elements or molecules light is\nreflecting off of. They might even give away the presence of water, which\ncould mean habitability. While the hypothesized glory on WASP-76b has not been\ndefinitively demonstrated, it is anything but a rainbow in the dark.\n\nAstronomy & Astrophysics, 2024.
