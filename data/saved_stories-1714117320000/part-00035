The proposal boils down to a 'Know Your Customer' regime\nfor companies operating cloud services, with the goal of countering the\nactivities of \"foreign malicious actors.\" Yet, despite an overseas focus,\nAmericans won't be able to avoid the proposal's requirements, which covers\nCDNs, virtual private servers, proxies, and domain name resolution services,\namong others.\n\nIt\u2019s long been the case that access to certain services, whether on or\noffline, will only be granted when customers prove their identity.\n\nOften linked to financial products but in many cases basic money/goods\ntransactions carried out online, handing over a name, address, date of birth\nand similar details, can increase confidence that a deal will more likely than\nnot go according to plan. In some cases, especially when buying restricted\nproducts, proving identity can be a condition of sale.\n\nYet, for many years, companies operating in the online space have been happy\nto do business with customers without knowing very much about them at all.\n\nIn some cases, where companies understand that a lack of friction is valuable\nto the customer, an email address has long been considered sufficient. If the\ncredit or pre-payment card eventually used to pay for a product has enough\ncredit and isn\u2019t stolen, there seems very little to be concerned about. For\nmany governments, however, any level of anonymity has the capacity to cause\nconcern, and if that means unmasking everyone to identify a few bad actors, so\nbe it.\n\n## Improving Detection and Prevention of Foreign Malicious Cyber Activity\n\nPerceived and actual threats from shadowy overseas actors are something few\ncountries can avoid. Whether in the West or the East, reports of relatively\nlow-key meddling through to seriously malicious hacks, even attacks on key\ninfrastructure, are becoming a fact of modern life.\n\nAfter being under discussion for years, late January the U.S. Department of\nCommerce published a notice of proposed rulemaking hoping to reduce threats to\nthe United States. If adopted, the proposal will establish a new set of\nrequirements for Infrastructure as a Service providers (IaaS), often known as\ncloud infrastructure providers, to deny access to foreign adversaries.\n\nThe premise is relatively simple. By having a more rigorous sign-up procedure\nfor platforms such as Amazon\u2019s AWS, for example, the risk of malicious actors\nusing U.S. cloud services to attack U.S. critical infrastructure, or undermine\nnational security in other ways, can be reduced. The Bureau of Industry and\nSecurity noted the following in its announcement late January.\n\n> The proposed rule introduces potential regulations that require U.S. cloud\n> infrastructure providers and their foreign resellers to implement and\n> maintain Customer Identification Programs (CIPs), which would include the\n> collection of \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d (KYC) information. Similar KYC\n> requirements already exist in other industries and seek to assist service\n> providers in identifying and addressing potential risks posed by providing\n> services to certain customers. Such risks include fraud, theft, facilitation\n> of terrorism, and other activities contrary to U.S. national security\n> interests.\n\nWhile supposedly aimed at external threats, only positive identification of\nall customers can eliminate the possibility that an \u2018innocent\u2019 domestic user\nisn\u2019t actually a foreign threat actor. Or, according to the proposal, anyone\n(or all people) from a specified jurisdiction at the government\u2019s discretion.\nUpon notification by IaaS providers, that could include foreign persons\ntraining large artificial intelligence models \u201cwith potential capabilities\nthat could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity.\u201d\n\n## Scope of IaaS and Customer Identification Programs\n\nUnder the proposed rule, Customer Identification Programs (CIPs) operated by\nIaaS providers must collect information from both existing and prospective\ncustomers, i.e. those at the application stage of opening an account. The bare\nminimum includes the following data: a customer\u2019s name, address, the means and\nsource of payment for each customer\u2019s account, email addresses and telephone\nnumbers, and IP addresses used for access or administration of the account.\n\nWhat qualifies as an IaaS is surprisingly broad:\n\n> Any product or service offered to a consumer, including complimentary or\n> \u201ctrial\u201d offerings, that provides processing, storage, networks, or other\n> fundamental computing resources, and with which the consumer is able to\n> deploy and run software that is not predefined, including operating systems\n> and applications.\n>\n> The consumer typically does not manage or control most of the underlying\n> hardware but has control over the operating systems, storage, and any\n> deployed applications. The term is inclusive of \u201cmanaged\u201d products or\n> services, in which the provider is responsible for some aspects of system\n> configuration or maintenance, and \u201cunmanaged\u201d products or services, in which\n> the provider is only responsible for ensuring that the product is available\n> to the consumer.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop there. The term IaaS includes all \u2018virtualized\u2019 products\nand services where the computing resources of a physical machine are shared,\nsuch as Virtual Private Servers (VPS). It even covers \u2018baremetal\u2019 servers\nallocated to a single person. The definition also extends to any service where\nthe consumer does not manage or control the underlying hardware but contracts\nwith a third party for access.\n\n\u201cThis definition would capture services such as content delivery networks,\nproxy services, and domain name resolution services,\u201d the proposal reads.\n\nThe proposed rule, National Emergency with Respect to Significant Malicious\nCyber-Enabled Activities, will stop accepting comments from interested parties\non April 30, 2024.\n\nGiven the implications for regular citizens, many of whom are already hanging\non to what remains of their privacy, the prospect of handing over highly\nsensitive information just to obtain a product trial is a real concern. The\npotential for leaks grows with each disclosure, as does the possibility of\npersonal information ending up for sale on the dark web.\n\nWhich is where the threat actors will obtain other people\u2019s credentials to\nmasquerade as regular users when subjected to a Know Your Customer process.\nFor IaaS services themselves, the largest will have few problems implementing\ncustomer identification programs and may even consider them useful. On one\nhand, they can help to stop threat actors and on the other, take the\nopportunity to build a database containing the personal details of every\nsingle customer.\n\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * Anonymity\n  * know your customer\n  * privacy\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\nTechnology\n\n### Russia Prepares RuStore VPN Ban After Declaring RuStore Installation\nMandatory\n\n  * October 4, 2023, 07:53 by Andy Maxwell\n\nLawsuits\n\n### Disclosure of Pirates\u2019 Identities \u201cCompatible With EU Privacy Laws\u201d\n\n  * September 29, 2023, 08:00 by Andy Maxwell\n\nTechnology\n\n### Putin Outlaws Anonymity: Identity Verification For Online Services, VPN\nBypass Advice a Crime\n\n  * August 1, 2023, 09:52 by Andy Maxwell\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nGoogle Drive Flags Text Files With \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d As Copyright Infringements\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nGoogle Drive Flags Text Files With \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d As Copyright Infringements\n\nPolice Drop Criminal Investigation into Pirate Bay Co-Founder\n\nThe Interview Is A Pirate Hit With 200k Downloads (Updated)\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14967\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": true}
