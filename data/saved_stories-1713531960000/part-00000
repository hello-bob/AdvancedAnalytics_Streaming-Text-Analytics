Despite\nprogress towards characterizing the mechanisms of cardiac regeneration in fish\nand amphibians, the large evolutionary gulf between mammals and regenerating\nvertebrates complicates deciphering which cellular and molecular features\ntruly enable regeneration. To better define these features, we compared\ncardiac injury responses in zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that share\nsimilar heart anatomy and common teleost ancestry but differ in regenerative\ncapability. We used single-cell transcriptional profiling to create a time-\nresolved comparative cell atlas of injury responses in all major cardiac cell\ntypes across both species. With this approach, we identified several key\nfeatures that distinguish cardiac injury response in the non-regenerating\nmedaka heart. By comparing immune responses to injury, we found altered cell\nrecruitment and a distinct pro-inflammatory gene program in medaka leukocytes,\nand an absence of the injury-induced interferon response seen in zebrafish. In\naddition, we found a lack of pro-regenerative signals, including nrg1 and\nretinoic acid, from medaka endothelial and epicardial cells. Finally, we\nidentified alterations in the myocardial structure in medaka, where they lack\nprimordial layer cardiomyocytes and fail to employ a cardioprotective gene\nprogram shared by regenerating vertebrates. Our findings reveal notable\nvariation in injury response across nearly all major cardiac cell types in\nzebrafish and medaka, demonstrating how evolutionary divergence influences the\nhidden cellular features underpinning regenerative potential in these\nseemingly similar vertebrates.\n\nKeywords:\n\nHeart, Regeneration, Interferon, Myocardium, Evolution, Immunity\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nMyocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, contributes\nsignificantly to human morbidity and mortality (Roth et al., 2020). During an\nMI, a blockage in a coronary artery cuts off blood flow to the heart muscle\ncausing cell death and the eventual formation of a non-contractile scar. In\nadult mammals, including humans, this scar is permanent and impairs cardiac\nfunction (Lam and Sadek, 2018). In contrast, many types of fish and amphibians\npossess the remarkable ability to clear cardiac scar tissue and regrow damaged\nmuscle as adults (Cutie and Huang, 2021; Vivien et al., 2016). These\nobservations have sparked intensive studies of regenerating species in hopes\nof discovering evolutionarily conserved mechanisms to enable regeneration in\nhumans (Godwin, 2014). Such comparative studies are confounded, however, by\nthe large evolutionary divergence between mammals and regenerating\nvertebrates. This distant evolutionary relationship results in often unclear\ngene orthology to mammals and manifests in the distinct simplified heart\nanatomy of fish and amphibians. Thus, despite many advances, the precise\nmolecular, cellular, and genetic factors that enable some animals to\nregenerate as adults remain incompletely defined.\n\nZebrafish have emerged as a powerful model for studying adult heart\nregeneration (Gonz\u00e1lez-Rosa et al., 2017; Poss et al., 2002). Experimentally\ninduced ventricular cryoinjury is frequently used in zebrafish to mimic\ninfarction events seen in humans (Gonz\u00e1lez-Rosa et al., 2011). Following\ninjury with a liquid nitrogen-cooled probe, a lesion of necrotic tissue forms,\ntriggering an acute inflammatory response that recruits various immune cell\ntypes to the wound (Bevan et al., 2020). The activities of these immune cells\nplay a crucial role in the subsequent remodeling and regeneration processes in\nzebrafish. Macrophages and regulatory T cells, in particular, are\nindispensable for successful regeneration (Hui et al., 2017; Sanz-Morej\u00f3n et\nal., 2019). Additionally, fibroblast cells derived from both the endocardium\nand epicardium become activated and deposit the collagenous matrix that makes\nup the scar and stabilizes the injured ventricle (Hu et al., 2022; S\u00e1nchez-\nIranzo et al., 2018b). In zebrafish, activated fibroblasts also provide\ncritical signals that foster a regenerative niche by promoting\nneovascularization of the wound area and dedifferentiation and proliferation\nof existing cardiomyocytes in the wound border zone. This signaling is\nmediated in part by molecules such as nrg1, secreted from epicardial-derived\ncells (Gemberling et al., 2015), and retinoic acid, chiefly produced by the\nendocardial compartment (Kikuchi et al., 2011). The synergistic effects of\nthese signals promote the regrowth of coronary vessels and replacement of scar\ntissue with healthy myocardium. Although these cellular behaviors are well-\nestablished in zebrafish, it remains unclear whether non-regenerating species\nmight share some or all of these characteristics. Therefore, comparative\nstudies are still needed to determine which behaviors of immune cells and\ncomponents of the signaling environment are truly unique to the regenerating\nheart.\n\nRecent surveys of cardiac regeneration capabilities among different teleost\nfish species have yielded surprisingly contrasting results, demonstrating that\nzebrafish cardiac injury responses are not representative of all teleosts.\nWhile ventricular regeneration is found in some fish species (Grivas et al.,\n2014; Wang et al., 2020), several others, including the grass carp (Long et\nal., 2022), Mexican cavefish (Stockdale et al., 2018), and Japanese medaka\n(Ito et al., 2014), exhibit permanent scarring similar to adult mammals. The\ncellular and molecular behaviors that distinguish these non-regenerating\nspecies from zebrafish, however, have only begun to be characterized at the\ncellular level. Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, have recently emerged as a\nnon-regenerating counterpart to the zebrafish model system (Ito et al., 2014).\nBulk RNA sequencing analyses uncovered critical differences in the immune\npathways activated in the post-injury ventricle in medaka. Notably,\nstimulation of an immune response through the injection of double-stranded\nRNA, ostensibly through activation of interferon signaling, promotes\nrevascularization and cardiomyocyte proliferation in medaka in a macrophage-\ndependent manner (Lai et al., 2017). These findings implicate the immune\nsystem as a critical source of phenotypic diversity in cardiac injury\nresponses. The existence of non-regenerating teleosts offers a unique\nopportunity to compare and contrast the differing regeneration phenotypes\nacross relatively short evolutionary distances to determine which cellular\nfeatures are unique to regenerating species. Given that heart regeneration was\nlikely an ancestral trait of teleosts (Cutie and Huang, 2021; Kikuchi et al.,\n2011), understanding the evolutionary path that led to the loss of this\nability in some species may offer parallel insights into why mammals lose the\nability to regenerate as adults.\n\nIn this study, we used comparative single-cell transcriptomics to create\ndetailed time-course maps of the cardiac injury response in zebrafish and the\nnon-regenerating Japanese medaka. These fish share similar body and heart\nanatomy and shared a common teleost ancestor \u223c140 million years ago (Naruse et\nal., 2004). Our approach revealed key differences in both pre- and post-injury\nhearts that may be responsible for the contrasting regeneration outcomes. We\nfound differences in immune cell recruitment and behavior, epicardial and\nendothelial cell signaling, and alterations in the structure and makeup of the\nmyocardium. Overall, our findings shed new light on the factors that\ncoordinate heart regeneration and generate new hypotheses for the mechanisms\nthat underlie the loss of this ability in certain species.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Time-resolved atlas of cardiac injury response in zebrafish and medaka\nventricles\n\nThere have been few direct cross-species comparative studies of cardiac injury\nthus far (Lai et al., 2017; Stockdale et al., 2018). Single-cell RNA\nsequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful approach that enables simultaneous\ncomparison of cellular composition and gene expression across all major cell\ntypes in the heart. Therefore, we sought to create a comparative cell atlas of\ncardiac injury response in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (O. latipes)\nventricles. We used cardiac cryoinjury to induce comparable injury in the\nventricles of both zebrafish and medaka (see Materials and Methods). We\ncollected and analyzed uninjured hearts, as well as hearts at 3 and 14 days\npost-injury (d.p.i.), from both species with several biological replicates at\neach time point (Fig. 1A). Dissected ventricles were dissociated into a\nsingle-cell suspension and prepared for scRNA-seq. Consistent with prior\nstudies (Gonz\u00e1lez-Rosa et al., 2011), cryoinjury-induced lesions in the\nmyocardium and formation of a fibrous clot by 3 d.p.i., with deposition of a\ncollagen-rich scar evident by 14 d.p.i. (Fig. 1B).\n\nFig. 1.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nA single-cell atlas of cardiac injury response in zebrafish and medaka.

To improve downstream\ndata integration, gene names were standardized to unify names where one-to-one\northology was supported (Fig. S1A). The resulting cells were log normalized\nand integrated using Seurat v4 (Stuart et al., 2019). Cell integration anchors\nwere calculated using canonical correlation analysis, a technique that\nbenchmarks well for joint-embedding of shared cell types while maintaining\nspecies-specific cell types (Song et al., 2023). After integration,\ndimensionality reduction and clustering yielded 22 cell clusters (Fig. 1C).\nAnalysis of marker gene expression revealed five main cell types including\ncardiomyocytes (marked by myl7 and actc1a expression), endothelial cells\n(fli1a/kdrl; Habeck et al., 2002; Lawson and Weinstein, 2002), epicardial\ncells (tcf21/tbx20; Peralta et al., 2014), vascular mural cells (pdgfrb/rgs5a;\nShih et al., 2021), and leukocytes (coro1a/ptprc; Rougeot et al., 2019) (Fig.\n1D). Cross-species data integration was effective as both zebrafish and medaka\ncells were represented in each major cluster (Fig. S1B,C).\n\nTo facilitate dissemination of the data to the research community, we created\na freely available web-based application for exploration of the single-cell\ndataset (Ouyang et al., 2021). This tool allows users to examine and compare\ngene expression and cell type compositions across both species at all time\npoints. Access and instructions for usage can be found at\nhttps://github.com/clay-carey/medaka_zebrafish_regeneration.\n\n### Zebrafish mount an endogenous interferon response to injury\n\nWe first compared injury-induced immune responses to determine how medaka\nmight respond differently than zebrafish to immunostimulatory signals released\nafter cryoinjury. Interferon signaling can modulate gene expression in various\ncell types and may promote regeneration in tissues such as the intestine and\nskeletal muscle (Cheng et al., 2008; Leibowitz et al., 2021). Previous studies\nhave shown that injection of poly(I:C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA\nspecies and a potent activator of interferon signaling via TLR interaction,\ncan enhance revascularization and cardiomyocyte proliferation in injured\nmedaka hearts (Lai et al., 2017; Mar\u00edn-Juez et al., 2019). To explore whether\nendogenous interferon signaling may be activated in zebrafish after\ncryoinjury, we examined the expression of 12 genes previously identified as\nzebrafish interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) across different tissue types in\nour dataset (Levraud et al., 2019). We observed a surge in ISG expression at 3\nd.p.i. in the zebrafish endothelial, epicardial, and leukocyte compartments,\nbut not in the myocardium. In contrast, we did not detect ISG upregulation at\n3 d.p.i. or 14 d.p.i. in medaka (Fig. 2A). Using RNA in situ hybridization of\ninjured zebrafish hearts, we observed expression of isg15, a highly conserved\nISG across vertebrates, in the wound area co-mingled with kdrl^+ endothelial\ncells at 3 d.p.i., but not in 14 d.p.i hearts. Consistent with the single-cell\ndata, we detected little isg15 expression in injured or uninjured medaka\nhearts (Fig. 2B). Examination of isg15 expression by cell cluster revealed\nupregulation in most zebrafish endothelial, epicardial, and mural cell\nclusters at 3 d.p.i., consistent with a systemic interferon response to injury\nin zebrafish (Fig. S2A).\n\nFig. 2.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nMedaka lack an endogenous injury-induced interferon response.

(C) Gene\nexpression feature plot for ifnphi1 across all zebrafish cardiac cell types,\ncolor scale=expression level. (D) Quantification of proportion of zebrafish\nendothelial cells expressing ifnphi1 at each time point.\n\nTo investigate the source of post-injury interferon signals in zebrafish, we\nexamined the expression of each interferon isoform annotated in the zebrafish\ngenome. Our analysis revealed that only the ifnphi1 isoform was expressed in a\nsignificant number of zebrafish cells, and it was primarily restricted to\nendothelial cells (Fig. 2C; Fig. S2B). After cell quantification, we found\nthat there was an approximately threefold increase in the number of ifnphi1^+\nendothelial cells following injury, which returned to baseline levels by 14\nd.p.i. (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that endothelial cells are a major\nsource of interferon signaling after injury in zebrafish, possibly in response\nto damage-associated molecules, which may include immunostimulatory nucleic\nacids released from necrotic cells (Jounai et al., 2013). The medaka genome\nlacks annotation of interferon genes, making it difficult to assess whether\ninterferons are produced in response to injury. We identified five medaka\ngenes with putative homology to zebrafish interferon genes based on Ensembl\northology assessments (Fig. S2C). Only one of these genes were expressed in\nany medaka cell in our dataset, a putative ortholog of ifng, which was\nexpressed in some medaka leukocytes, but did not increase in expression after\ninjury (Fig. S2D,E). Therefore, while production of interferon signals cannot\nbe fully ruled out, medaka display a conspicuous lack of ISG response after\ninjury compared to zebrafish.\n\n### Medaka display altered injury-responsive macrophage cell populations\n\nImmune cells play a critical role in facilitating immediate injury responses\nand in modulating tissue regeneration and may represent a key point of\nphenotypic variation across species (Aurora and Olson, 2014; Godwin et al.,\n2017). In prior studies, analysis of bulk transcription patterns highlighted\nthe differential expression of immune-related genes in zebrafish and medaka\nhearts following injury (Lai et al., 2017). We further investigated the immune\nresponse in these species by examining immune cell populations through the\nsubsetting and re-clustering of all cell clusters identified as leukocytes\n(Fig. 3A). By using marker gene expression, we identified five distinct cell\nclusters, corresponding to macrophages (cxcr3.2/lgmn), proliferating\nmacrophages (mki67/pcna), T lymphocytes (lck/zap70), B lymphocytes\n(cd79a/pax5), and granulocytes (mpx/lyz) (Fig. 3B).\n\nFig. 3.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nMedaka display altered tissue-resident and injury-responsive immune cell\npopulations.

To further investigate how\nmedaka macrophages respond to injury, we quantified macrophage dynamics in the\nintact and injured areas of the zebrafish and medaka ventricle with RNA in\nsitu hybridization and imaging of cells expressing macrophage marker mpeg1.1.\nBy imaging healthy and injured ventricles, we found that macrophages are\nhighly enriched in the wound area in zebrafish compared to medaka, localizing\nnear cells expressing isg15 (Fig. 3C). Quantification of mpeg1.1^+ cells in\nzebrafish demonstrated that macrophage density in the wound is approximately\n5-fold higher than in uninjured myocardium at 3 and 14 d.p.i., but macrophage\ndensity in the unaffected tissue remains constant (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the\nwound area in medaka ventricles had a similar density of mpeg1.1^+ cells to\nthe intact uninjured ventricle, but the macrophages appeared to be depleted\nfrom intact tissue after injury in medaka (Fig. 3E). These results show that\nmedaka have few signs of post-injury macrophage recruitment or proliferation,\nwhile zebrafish macrophage populations are highly expanded in the wound area.\n\nWe next compared gene expression in zebrafish and medaka macrophages to\ndetermine whether they may have different behaviors in response to injury.\nStrikingly, medaka macrophages highly upregulated tnfa expression at 3 d.p.i.\ncompared to zebrafish, a marker of inflammatory M1-like macrophages (Fig. 3F).\nConversely, zebrafish macrophages express higher levels of cd9b after injury,\na marker of anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages (Brosseau et al., 2018)\n(Fig. 3G). Cell quantification from single-cell data showed a slight increase\nin tnfa^+ macrophages in 3 and 14 d.p.i. zebrafish, but uninjured medaka\nventricles display a substantially higher population, further increasing after\ninjury (Fig. 3H). Our findings show that although medaka have lower macrophage\nrecruitment, they exhibit a more pro-inflammatory response to injury,\nhighlighting a crucial difference in the immune response to injury between the\ntwo species.\n\n### Zebrafish and medaka share a partially overlapping fibrotic response to\ninjury\n\nFormation of a fibrotic scar following cardiac injury is an evolutionarily\nconserved trait among vertebrates (Vivien et al., 2016). In zebrafish, the\nscar is chiefly deposited by activated fibroblasts derived from pre-existing\nepicardial and endothelial cells, but it remains unclear how this process\nmight differ in species that exhibit permanent scarring (Gonz\u00e1lez-Rosa et al.,\n2012; Hu et al., 2022). We investigated whether medaka might differ in their\nfibrotic response to injury compared to zebrafish. To identify individual cell\ntypes contributing to fibrosis, we first conducted a re-clustering of all\ncells expressing the endothelial markers kdrl and fli1a, along with\nperivascular cells expressing mural cell markers rgs5a and pdgfrb. This\nprocess led to the identification of 11 cell clusters, categorized using\nmarker gene expression as endocardial endothelium cells (eECs), fibroblast-\nlike endothelial cells (fECs), coronary endothelium cells (cECs), and\nlymphatic endothelium cells (lECs) (Fig. S4A,B). Cells in the fEC cluster\nexpressed high levels of collagen isoforms col1a2 and col5a1, as well as\npostna and twist1b, markers of a transition to a mesenchymal activated\nfibroblast state but maintained expression of endothelial cell markers\nfli1a/kdrl but not epicardial markers tcf21/tbx18 (Fig. S3A,C).\n\nTo investigate the contributions of epicardial-derived cells to the fibrotic\nresponse, we re-clustered all cells expressing epicardial-specific markers\ntcf21 and tbx18, resulting in cell clusters consisting of three epicardial\ncell types: canonical epicardial cells (cEPs), fibroblast-like epicardial\ncells (fEPs), and a zebrafish-specific cluster of epicardial cells (zEPs)\n(Fig. 4C). The fEP cells are characterized by the expression of epithelial to\nmesenchymal transition marker twist1b, along with fibrotic-response genes\nperiostin-b (postnb) and collagen isoforms such as col12a1b. In contrast, the\nzEP cells express cell-adhesion proteins, including cldnc and jam2b, distinct\nfrom other epicardial cell types. Cells in the cEP instead maintain\ntcf21/tbx18 expression without expressing these functional markers (Fig. 4D;\nFig. S3B).\n\nFig. 4.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nZebrafish and medaka share a partially overlapping fibrotic response to\ninjury.

We first calculated the proportion of\nendothelial cells in the fEC clusters in each sample. Both zebrafish and\nmedaka display a 2-3-fold increase in fEC cell proportion at 3 d.p.i., and a\nreturn to baseline levels by 14 d.p.i. (Fig. 4E). We next investigated the\nfactors that define the individual fEC clusters. Among these cells, clusters\nfEC2 and fEC3 were most strongly marked by expression of cell cycle\nprogression markers (Fig. S3A). Furthermore, cell cycle scoring using Seurat\nv4 indicated that cells in clusters fEC2 and fEC3 are nearly uniformly in S or\nG2M phase, respectively (Fig. S3D). These proliferating fibroblast-like cells\nalso increased in proportion after injury in both species and returned to\nnormal levels by 14 d.p.i. (Fig. 4F). Among epicardial cells, we observed a\nsimilar increase in the proportion of collagen-producing fEP cells in both\nspecies (Fig. 4G). Thus, both zebrafish and medaka employ a strategy of\nfibroblast activation from both endothelial and epicardial compartments after\ninjury, with a shared proliferative response in endothelium-derived cells that\ncontribute to collagen production and scar formation.\n\nWe know relatively little about the makeup and dynamics of cardiac scar tissue\nbetween regenerating and non-regenerating species. To investigate whether\nzebrafish might have a unique scar composition, we compared expression of all\ndetectable collagen isoforms in all epicardial and endothelial cell types in\nboth species. It has been observed previously that zebrafish epicardial-\nderived fibroblasts upregulate collagen XII isoforms after injury, and that\nthese populations promote regeneration (Hu et al., 2022; Marro et al., 2016).\nWe observe a strong upregulation in expression and proportion of epicardial\ncells expressing collagens col12a1a and col12a1b in zebrafish, but a\nsubstantially more muted upregulation in medaka (Fig. S3E). In addition, while\nmost collagens we examined were upregulated in both species after injury,\nzebrafish epicardial and endothelial cells upregulated collagen V and VI\nisoforms not seen in medaka (Fig. S3E). Matrix metalloproteinases (mmps)\ndegrade collagen matrices and have been proposed to play important roles\nduring regeneration and scar clearance (Gamba et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018).\nWe compared expression levels of all expressed mmp genes and found shared\nupregulation of several mmps in endothelial cells of both species, but also\nspecies-specific upregulation of mmp15/16 in zebrafish and mmp19 in medaka\n(Fig. S3F). Thus, while aspects of the fibrotic response program are shared\nbetween species, zebrafish fibroblasts upregulate a subset of collagens and\nmatrix remodeling factors distinct from medaka. It remains to be determined\nwhat role, if any, these collagen and mmp isoforms play during regeneration.\n\n### Medaka epicardial and endothelial cells fail to produce many pro-\nregenerative signals\n\nEndothelial and epicardial cells are a major source of signals that promote\nrevascularization and cardiomyocyte proliferation after cardiac injury in\nzebrafish (Fernandez et al., 2018; Masters and Riley, 2014). To determine\nwhich of these signals are unique to the regenerating heart, we examined\nexpression patterns for four well-characterized pro-regenerative signals:\nneuregulin-1 (nrg1), retinoic acid synthesizing enzyme aldh1a2, ciliary\nneurotrophic factor (cntf), and the chemokine cxcl12a. Examination of their\nexpression patterns revealed that each of the four genes were most\npredominantly expressed in epicardial and endothelial cells (Fig. 5A).\n\nFig. 5.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nMedaka epicardial and endothelial cells fail to produce many pro-regenerative\nsignals.

After cardiac injury, nrg1 has been shown to be upregulated in\nepicardial-derived cells of the zebrafish heart and is sufficient to promote\ncardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac hypertrophy, indicating a critical\nrole in regeneration (Gemberling et al., 2015). We examined nrg1 expression\npatterns and found that it is mostly restricted to epicardial cells and a\nsmall number of endothelial cells (Fig. S4A). We quantified the number of\nnrg1+ epicardial cells and found a \u223c2-fold increase at 3 d.p.i. in zebrafish,\nreturning to base levels by 14 d.p.i. In contrast to zebrafish, we detected\nfew nrg1+ medaka epicardial cells in any condition (Fig. 5B). The lack of nrg1\nexpression from the medaka epicardium may partially explain a lack of\ncardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration.\n\nSignaling by retinoic acid (RA), synthesized in zebrafish by the enzyme\naldh1a2, is critical for development and regeneration across many types of\norgans and tissues (Ghyselinck and Duester, 2019). In zebrafish, injury-\ninduced RA synthesis in the epicardium and endocardium is indispensable for\ncardiac regeneration (Kikuchi et al., 2011). We observed aldh1a2 expression in\nboth epicardial and endothelial cells (Fig. 5A; Fig. S4B). Among endothelial\ncells, aldh1a2 was strongly induced among the zebrafish fibroblast-like fEC at\n3 d.p.i., and to a lesser extent in medaka fEC. Zebrafish eEC cells also\nupregulated aldh1a2 after injury, but this response was not observed in medaka\n(Fig. 5C), consistent with prior reports that failed to detect endocardial RA\nsynthesis response in medaka (Ito et al., 2014). Signaling by cntf has a well-\nestablished role in neural regeneration and has recently been shown to enhance\nventricular regeneration when exogenously supplied to zebrafish (Bise et al.,\n2019; Sahenk et al., 1994). We find evidence for endogenous cntf expression\npredominantly in endothelial cells (Fig. S4C). Similar to aldh1a2 expression\npatterns, we observe a strong induction of cntf in fEC cells in both zebrafish\nand medaka, but expression of cntf among eEC cells was only observed in\nzebrafish (Fig. 5D). Together, these results suggest that the endocardium of\nmedaka, the most abundant cell type in the heart, fails to mount a systemic\npro-regenerative response to injury as seen in zebrafish.\n\nThe zebrafish ventricle rapidly revascularizes after injury, but medaka have\nlimited re-growth of blood vessels after injury (Ito et al., 2014). This\nprocess is critical for regeneration, and evidence suggests that nascent blood\nvessels provide a scaffold for regrowing cardiomyocytes during regeneration\n(Mar\u00edn-Juez et al., 2019). We investigated whether there was evidence of\nrevascularization through analysis of apelin and cxcr4a expression, which are\nboth upregulated in growing coronary vessels (Mar\u00edn-Juez et al., 2019).\nConsistent with our understanding of previous literature, both apln and cxcr4a\nwere elevated in zebrafish cEC cells after injury but remained low at all time\npoints in medaka (Fig. 5E). Cxcl12a peptide acts as a ligand for cxcr4a,\npromoting angiogenesis and regeneration (Liekens et al., 2010). We observed\nthat expression of cxcl12a was mostly restricted to the epicardial compartment\n(Fig. 5A; Fig. S4D). Following injury, cxcl12a was highly upregulated in fEP\nand cEP cells in zebrafish by 3 d.p.i., but only apparent by 14 d.p.i. In\nmedaka (Fig. 5F). These results indicate that the zebrafish epicardium rapidly\nreleases pro-angiogenic signals that promote rapid revascularization unique to\nthis regenerating species.\n\nWhen examining epicardial cells, we identified a small number of zebrafish-\nspecific cells in the zEP cluster. In contrast to the fEP, the zEP cluster is\nonly composed of zebrafish cells and does not change in abundance after injury\n(Fig. S4E). These cells express epicardial marker tcf21 and appear to have a\nunique injury-response profile. At 3 d.p.i., we observe an increased level of\nexpression of pro-angiogenic signaling in zEP, including factors angpt1,\nvegfd, and cxcl8a, each known to play a role in promoting angiogenesis (El-\nSammak et al., 2022; Morisada et al., 2006; Song et al., 2007) (Fig. 5G).\nThus, while more evidence is needed to determine whether the zEP cells are\ntruly unique to zebrafish, they represent a potential hub of pro-angiogenic\nsignaling that may promote revascularization after injury in zebrafish.\n\n### Medaka lack primordial myocardium and have few cortical layer\ncardiomyocytes as adults\n\nAlthough medaka and zebrafish hearts are similar in overall morphology, they\nmay not share similar populations of cardiomyocytes. It has been proposed that\nsome cardiomyocyte populations might have outsized contributions to the pool\nof regenerating cells (Gonz\u00e1lez-Rosa et al., 2017). The zebrafish myocardium\ncontains three main types of cardiomyocytes with distinct spatial\narrangements: the inner mass of trabecular cardiomyocytes (tCMs), the outer\nlayer of cortical cardiomyocytes (cCMs), and a single-cell-thick layer of\nprimordial cardiomyocytes that sits underneath the cortical layer (Gupta and\nPoss, 2012). When comparing heart morphology, we noticed a distinctly thin\nouter cardiomyocyte layer in the medaka ventricle compared to the zebrafish\nventricle, including in older fish (Fig. 6A). The cortical myocardium has been\nproposed to play an important role in regeneration (Kikuchi et al., 2010), yet\nsome types of fish do not have this layer (Santer, 1985). We further compared\nthe composition of the myocardium by reclustering cells expressing\ncardiomyocyte markers myl7 and actc1a, identifying four cell clusters (Fig.\n6B). We identified one cluster of cCMs, which express canonical CM markers but\nlack expression of transcription factor tbx5a (S\u00e1nchez-Iranzo et al., 2018a).\nThe remaining cell clusters expressed transcription factors tbx5a, as well as\ngata6 and mef2d, and are assigned as tCMs (Fig. 6C). Comparing the cellular\ncompositions of each cardiomyocyte type revealed a skewing toward trabecular\ncardiomyocytes in medaka, and fewer cells clustering with cortical CMs,\nconsistent with our imaging observations (Fig. 6D).\n\nFig. 6.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nMedaka lack primordial myocardium and have few cortical layer cardiomyocytes.\n(A) RNA in situ hybridization of myl7 labeling myocardium in zebrafish and\nmedaka ventricles of the indicated age.

Scale bars: 200 \u03bcM.\n\nPrimordial cardiomyocytes are of interest as a pro-regenerative cell\npopulation due to their expression of genes typically associated with\nembryonic cardiomyocytes (Pfefferli and Ja\u017awi\u0144ska, 2017; Tsedeke et al.,\n2021). These cardiomyocytes make distinct cell junctions and act as a\ntransitional layer between the cortical and trabecular layer, but do not act\nas a direct cellular source of regenerating cardiomyocytes (Lafontant et al.,\n2013). Initially, we did not observe a cell cluster expressing markers for the\nprimordial myocardium (acta2/hey2/actn1) in the integrated single-cell object\n(Fig. 6B). However, species-specific clustering of uninjured cardiomyocytes\nrevealed a small cluster of zebrafish cells expressing primordial CM makers,\nincluding acta2, hspa12b, clcn2a, and smoc1 (Fig. 6E,F). In contrast,\nclustering of uninjured medaka CMs failed to identify any group of cells\nexpressing analogous cell markers (Fig. 6G,H). We examined the spatial\npatterns of top primordial CM markers acta2 and hey2 expression in the\nzebrafish ventricle and found co-localization in a thin sub-cortical cell\nlayer of cardiomyocytes expressing both genes (Fig. 6I). We searched for a\nsimilar arrangement of CMs in medaka ventricles by probing for acta2\nexpression (hey2 is not annotated in the medaka genome). Imaging revealed no\nevidence of either acta2+ cardiomyocytes or an analogous primordial layer in\nmedaka (Fig. 6J). Together, our transcriptomic and imaging data suggest that\nadult medaka lack primordial cardiomyocytes and have a diminished or absent\ncortical myocardium, factors that may influence the ability to regenerate.\n\n### Zebrafish cardiomyocytes share a cardioprotective gene signature with\nneonatal mouse\n\nNeonatal mammals are capable of heart regeneration but retain permanent scars\nif injured as adults. To investigate whether the neonatal mammal heart might\nshare similarities with zebrafish, we compared injury responses in our dataset\nto a recently published single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset that assessed\ncardiomyocyte responses to injury in regenerating postnatal day 4 (p4) mice\nand non-regenerating postnatal day 11 (p11) mice (Cui et al., 2020). We used\ndifferential gene expression testing to identify all upregulated genes at 3\nd.p.i. in cardiomyocyte cells in the p4 and p11 mice as well as in zebrafish\nand medaka cardiomyocytes. Using orthology assignments from Ensembl, we\ndetermined which upregulated genes with one-to-one orthology were shared or\nunique in each species. Indeed, zebrafish cardiomyocytes shared three times as\nmany injury-upregulated genes with P4 mouse (33 genes) compared to the non-\nregenerating P11 mouse (11 genes) (Fig. 7A). In contrast, Medaka\ncardiomyocytes shared more genes in common with the p11 mouse (12 genes) (Fig.\n7B). Remarkably, a large proportion of the shared injury-response genes\nbetween zebrafish and p4 mouse cardiomyocytes have well-described\ncardioprotective roles, promoting cardiomyocyte survival and guarding against\nmetabolic stress (Table S1). Examination of gene expression of these\ncardioprotective genes revealed a conspicuous lack of induction in both medaka\nand p11 cardiomyocytes (Fig. 7C). These results indicate that regenerating\nvertebrates deploy an evolutionarily conserved cardioprotective program\nimmediately after myocardial injury.\n\nFig. 7.\n\nView largeDownload slide\n\nZebrafish cardiomyocytes share a cardioprotective gene signature with neonatal\nmouse.

Our analysis revealed\nseveral previously undescribed differences between the two species, including\nvariations in immune cell populations, endothelial and epicardial cell\nsignaling, and the composition of the myocardium itself. In addition, our\nresults corroborated and expanded upon previous observations in medaka,\nincluding altered macrophage recruitment and dampened retinoic acid signaling\n(Ito et al., 2014; Lai et al., 2017). These findings highlight the power of\ncomparative scRNAseq to identify species-specific differences in biological\nprocesses and have generated hypotheses for future investigations into the\nmechanisms of cardiac regeneration in these species.\n\nOur comparative analysis of immune cell populations and gene expression in\nresponse to injury revealed major differences between zebrafish and medaka.\nPrevious comparisons showed that the hearts of these two species express a\ndifferent repertoire of immune genes after injury (Lai et al., 2017).\nRemarkably, injection of poly(I:C), a potent activator of interferon\nsignaling, can promote cardiac revascularization and regeneration in medaka.\nInterferon signaling seems to have pleiotropic effects depending on the tissue\ntype, where it is deleterious in some cases but promotes regeneration in\nothers (Cheng et al., 2008; Leibowitz et al., 2021). Our findings indicate a\nmajor difference between zebrafish and medaka in response to injury is the\npresence of endogenous interferon signaling specific to zebrafish. Interferon\nsignals may play a role in modulating immune cell behaviors, perhaps\nexplaining why zebrafish appear to recruit macrophages to the ventricle injury\nsite while medaka do not. Additionally, while pro-regenerative genes such as\naldh1a2 or nrg1 are not canonical ISGs, it remains to be determined whether\nindirect effects of interferon might promote their expression. Indeed, we find\nthat the endocardium and epicardium, which are the main source of pro-\nregenerative signaling, exhibit the most robust ISG expression. Our study\nutilized timepoints at 3 and 14 d.p.i., representing an early and well-\ndeveloped injury response. Although ISG expression was robust at 3 d.p.i. in\nzebrafish, it is possible that medaka may also mount an interferon response on\nan accelerated or delayed timescale we did not capture. Further experimental\ncharacterizations of the role of endogenous interferon signaling during heart\nregeneration represents a compelling direction for future inquiry.\n\nOur examination of endothelial and epicardial cell populations uncovered\nseveral injury-response behaviors that are shared between zebrafish and\nmedaka. Overall, both species shared a similar pattern of fibroblast\nactivation from both the endothelial and epicardial compartments. Our\ncomparison of the set of collagen and matrix remodeling factors made by each\nspecies showed a mostly overlapping pattern of induction after injury. This\nincluded collagen XII isoforms in epicardial-derived fibroblasts, which were\nupregulated in both species after injury, but to a higher degree in zebrafish.\nThese collagen XII-producing fibroblasts are of special interest as they are\nrequired for proper regeneration in zebrafish (Hu et al., 2022). We also found\nevidence of some species-specific matrix-remodeling proteins and collagen\nisoforms, warranting further investigation into whether the makeup of the scar\nitself may promote regeneration in zebrafish.\n\nWhile we observed similar strategies of fibroblast activation from the\nendothelial and epicardial compartments in both species, medaka failed to\nproduce critical signals required for regeneration from these cells. In\nparticular, medaka fibroblasts expressing epicardial markers had a conspicuous\nlack of nrg1 expression, which itself is sufficient to activate regenerative\nprograms in the heart (Chen et al., 2016; Gemberling et al., 2015).\nInterestingly, we observed a post-injury upregulation of some pro-regenerative\nsignals in medaka endothelial-like fibroblasts, including aldh1a2 and cntf.\nThese same signals were highly upregulated in zebrafish endocardial clusters,\nbut notably absent from medaka endocardium. In zebrafish, the endocardium\nundergoes systemic morphological changes in response to injury, coincident\nwith strong upregulation of aldh1a2 and other signaling factors even in cells\ndistal from the wound area (Kikuchi et al., 2011). Further experiments are\nneeded to define the specific stimuli that trigger this systemic response and\nto determine why medaka endocardial cells appear to be less responsive to\ninjury.\n\nFinally, we investigated the cellular makeup of the myocardium in zebrafish\nand medaka. Our results reveal marked differences in the cardiomyocyte\npopulations of these two species, which are discernible even in non-injured\nsamples. Specifically, we found that medaka have a highly diminished or absent\ncortical myocardium, as evidenced by our single-cell sequencing and imaging\nanalyses. This observation is notable, given that previous studies have\nindicated that the cortical myocardium is activated after injury in zebrafish\nand may serve as a source of pro-regenerative cardiomyocytes (Kikuchi et al.,\n2010). Additionally, we were unable to identify primordial layer\ncardiomyocytes in medaka using either single-cell gene expression analysis or\nby imaging of key markers. As the primordial layer acts as a transitional\nlayer between cortical and trabecular myocardium with specialized cell\njunctions (Lafontant et al., 2013), it may be interesting to test whether the\nprimordial layer is absent in all teleosts lacking cortical myocardium. In\nzebrafish, we observed that the primordial myocardium expresses acta2 in\nconjunction with hey2, an embryonic cardiomyocyte marker, indicating a\ndistinct transcriptional state (Ihara et al., 2018). These findings are\nespecially interesting in light of recent studies demonstrating that acta2+\nembryonic-like cardiomyocytes are present in neonatal mammalian hearts but are\nlost as the animal ages, coincident with the decline of regenerative capacity\n(Cui et al., 2020, 2021). Thus, the presence of smooth muscle actin-expressing\ncardiomyocytes in uninjured hearts is notably correlated with regenerative\ncapability. However, the mechanisms by which these specialized primordial\ncardiomyocytes might contribute to regeneration is unclear. Indeed, lineage\ntracing of primordial cardiomyocytes has demonstrated that these cells are not\nprimary contributors to peri-injury zone regenerated myocardium, and the layer\nitself is deficient or delayed in re-forming around the injury area (Pfefferli\nand Ja\u017awi\u0144ska, 2017). Further investigation is warranted, however, to explore\nany cell non-autonomous roles for primordial layer cardiomyocytes in heart\nregeneration.\n\nMedaka and zebrafish have been used extensively as laboratory model\nvertebrates and have similar care requirements and body plans. While it was\nknown that medaka are incapable of heart regeneration, it could have been\nassumed that medaka as fellow teleost fish would only have minor differences\nin cardiac structure. Our study found a surprising number of distinguishing\ncharacteristics of the medaka heart compared to zebrafish. These differences\nincluded not only changes in cellular behaviors but also substantial changes\nin the structure of the myocardium itself. Given the number of notable\ndifferences we observed between zebrafish and medaka, a wider phylogenetic\nsurvey of cardiac injury responses will be particularly useful to identify\nfeatures that correlate with heart regeneration or non-regeneration across the\nteleost phylogeny. These observations highlight how biodiversity within\nshorter evolutionary distances can enable comparative studies that reveal\nfundamental insights about the gain or loss of complex traits.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Fish husbandry\n\nWild-type T\u00fcbingen zebrafish and CAB medaka, aged 6-18 months unless otherwise\nstated, were used for all experiments. All zebrafish and medaka work was\nperformed at University of Utah's CBRZ zebrafish facility. This study was\nconducted under the approval of the Office of Institutional Animal Care and\nUse Committee (IACUC no. 20-07013) of the University of Utah's animal care and\nuse program.\n\n### Cardiac cryoinjury\n\nCryoinjuries were performed on the ventricle apex of both medaka and zebrafish\nas described previously (Gonz\u00e1lez-Rosa et al., 2011). Briefly, 0.02% and 0.04%\nTricaine (MS-222) was used to anesthetize zebrafish and medaka, respectively.\nFish were mounted on a moist sponge. The ventricle apex was exposed by making\na small thoracic incision using forceps and dissecting scissors. A cryoprobe\nwas constructed as described previously using a 0.5 mm diameter copper wire\n(Gonz\u00e1lez-Rosa and Mercader, 2012). After submersion in liquid nitrogen for at\nleast 2 min, the probe was placed in contact with the ventricle apex for\nexactly 23 s. After injury, fish were placed back into freshwater tanks to\nrecover, then transferred back into the fish facility for monitoring.\n\n### Histology\n\nHearts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, then sucrose treated and\nembedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature (O.C.T.) embedding medium. 6 \u03bcm\nsections of the heart were cut using a Leica Cryostat. Bouin's solution was\nused to fix heart tissue before staining with PT/PM (phosphotungstic\nacid/phosphomolybdic acid) and AFOG (Methyl Blue, Orange G, and Acid Fuchsin)\nstain. After staining, heart tissue was washed with 0.5% acetic acid, 100%\nethanol, and xylenes. Fibrinogen and collagen deposition from heart sections\nwith representative injuries for both medaka and zebrafish were chosen to\ndemonstrate comparative injury phenotypes at 3 and 14 d.p.i. Measurements were\nmade using Fiji, ImageJ, software.\n\n### Single-cell isolation and library preparation\n\nTo prepare cells for scRNA-seq, adult fish were euthanized by immersion in\nice-cold water. After dissection and removal of hearts, the remaining atrium\nand bulbus arteriosus tissue were cut away with scissors to isolate the\nventricle. Ventricles were placed in PBS solution and gently squeezed with\nforceps to remove residual blood prior to digestion. Whole ventricles were\nplaced in 200 \u03bcl dissociation solution containing 1 mg/ml liberase DH\n(Millipore Sigma, cat# 5401089001) in 1X HBSS. Ventricles were digested at\n37\u00b0C for 30 min on a benchtop shaker at 250RPM with additional pipetting every\n5 min to break apart the tissue. After complete digestion, the reaction was\nquenched with ice-cold PBS/50% fetal bovine serum and passed through a 40 \u03bcM\nstrainer. The cells were then centrifuged at 250 RCF for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and\nresuspended in ice-cold PBS with 0.04% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then\nassessed for viability and dissociation quality using Acridine Orange and\nPropidium Iodide staining with a Nexcelom Cellometer automated cell imager.\nEach sample viability was assessed to be >85%. Cells were loaded onto a 10X\nGenomics Chromium controller and processed according to the manufacturer's\nspecifications. cDNA libraries were prepared for sequencing on the Illumina\nNovaseq platform at a depth of approximately 400 M reads/sample.\n\n### Gene ortholog assignment\n\nFor cross species comparisons, gene orthology was established using the\nEnsembl database (Harrison et al., 2024). Unless otherwise stated, genes\ncompared across species sharing the same name were established as one-to-one\northologs using the Ensembl comparative genomics resources (Herrero et al.,\n2016). Genes with cardioprotective functions were identified from literature\nsearches (Chen et al., 2022; Brundel et al., 2008; Denzel et al., 2010; Lizano\net al., 2017; Morikawa et al., 2015; Nader 2019; Poch et al., 2022; Ponnalagu\net al., 2022, Spelat et al., 2022).\n\n### Data integration and clustering\n\nSingle-cell RNA seq reads were processed with Cellranger from 10X Genomics\nwith the default settings, using GRCz11 v4.3.2 reference (Lawson et al., 2020)\nfor zebrafish read alignments and ASM223467v1 for Medaka. Gene expression\nmatrices were imported and processed in Seurat v4 for subsequent analysis. A\npreliminary filtering step was used to remove cells with less than 200 unique\nRNA features or cells with more than 40% mitochondrial RNA. To cluster cells\nacross species and correct for batch effects, we used the data integration\nfunction in Seurat v4, which uses gene anchors with shared names to apply\ncorrection vectors to correct for batch and species effects and can allow for\ncross-species integration (Stuart et al., 2019). To maximize the number of\nusable anchors we renamed 596 medaka genes that were confidently assigned as\none-to-one orthologs as determined by Ensembl orthology assessment. An initial\nround of clustering was performed on log normalized gene expression, and\nerythroid cells (hbba1/hbaa1 positive) and platelets (thbs1b/itga2b positive)\nwere filtered out. An additional filtering criterion was then applied to\nremove non-myocyte cells with greater than 15% mitochondrial RNA. The filtered\ncells were then re-clustered and annotated by marker gene expression.\n\n### RNAscope in situ hybridization\n\nPrior to performing RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA, USA),\nfish hearts were fixed overnight in 4% PFA in 1x PBS, sucrose treated,\nembedded in OCT, and cryosectioned into 12 \u03bcm coronal sections. RNAscope^\u00ae\nMultiplex Fluorescent Detection Kit v2 protocol was completed according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol for standard fixed-frozen tissue samples. See key\nresources table for probe details.\n\n### Imaging\n\nBrightfield images of AFOG stains were acquired with the Zeiss Axio Scan Z1\ninstrument. Fluorescence images were captured on a Zeiss 880 Airy Scan\nconfocal microscope. Tiling and stitching were completed by ZEN Black\nsoftware. Images displayed are maximum intensity projections. Adjustments of\ncontrast and brightness were made using ImageJ. At each step of image\ncollection, similar settings for both species were used. When images were used\nfor quantification, all images were collected using the same laser settings\n(gain, laser power, ext.).\n\n### Imaging quantification\n\nImages of RNAscope sections that marked cardiomyocytes (myl7), macrophages\n(mpeg1.1), and nuclei (DAPI) were prepared and processed with ImageJ. To\ndistinguish between the intact ventricle and wound area, ImageJ thresholding\nof the myl7 channel was completed to make two regions of interest (ROI) \u2013 a\nregion that marked just the intact ventricle and a region that marked the\nintact ventricle and the wounded area. These ImageJ ROIs were used to\ncalculate the areas of each region. Then the ROIs were applied to the mpeg1.1\nand DAPI channels to mask either the wound area or the intact ventricle.\nMasked images were uploaded to CellProfiler software (version 4.2.1) using a\nmodified CellProfiler \u2018Speckle Counting\u2019 pipeline (Stirling et al., 2021).\nNucleated cells were identified using the DAPI channel and the\nIdentifyPrimaryObjects CellProfiler module. mpeg1.1 speckles were identified\nusing the mpeg1.1 channel and the IdentifyPrimaryObjects CellProfiler module.\nObjects were related using the RelateObjects CellProfiler module. Cells were\nidentified as macrophages when a mpeg1.1 speckle fell within a mask created by\nthe DAPI channel.\n\n### Key resources table\n\nView Large\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe acknowledge Cell Imaging Core at the University of Utah for the use of\nequipment (Zeiss 880 Airy Scan, Axio Scan.Z1, and Leica Cryostat) and thank\nXiang Wang for assisting our imaging work.
