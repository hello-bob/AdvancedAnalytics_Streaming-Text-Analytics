Eventually\nI will update the elements below to reflect that, but in the meantime this\npage represents the project as it was from 1999 to 2008.\n\n### Concept & History\n\nAt some point in 1999 it struck me that there was an interesting art project\nto be done about the stray shopping carts I was seeing around my city. I knew\nfrom the beginning that if I were to just take pictures of carts in the urban\nenvironment, the work would read as fairly conventional social documentary\nphotography, (a genre I am not terribly fond of). I thought that to get beyond\nthose conventions I would need to approach the stray shopping cart phenomenon\nfrom a different angle. I decided to try to define the different states in\nwhich a stray cart could be. This led to a rudimentary system of\nclassification that described what I then saw as the basic thirteen types. My\napproach was to observe the stray cart in the way that a naturalist might\nobserve an animal. I never posed or repositioned or interfered with stray\ncarts. I thought of the human actors as unseen natural forces (people almost\nnever appear directly in any of the project photographs). I wrote the text\nfrom the point of view of someone who took the taxonomic investigation of\nstray shopping carts extremely seriously. That character (the fictional Julian\nMontague) became more important as the project proceeded, and the conceptual\nspace of the work became strictly defined.\n\nAs the project moved forward and I was given opportunities to show it, I was\ncontinually refining the system based on new observations. Over the active\nyears of the project I documented and categorized thousands of stray shopping\ncarts in the United States and abroad. The system evolved to include thirty-\nthree types that can be used singly or in combination to describe and thereby\n\u201cidentify\u201d any found cart.\n\nAlthough it was not clear to me in the early stages, I soon realized that the\nproject was exploration of the ways in which language and scientific systems\nof classification shape our perception of both the natural and man made\nworlds. By establishing an authoritative voice that names the unnamed and\narticulates (in absurd detail) the workings of a mundane phenomenon, the\nproject can manipulate the viewer\u2019s perception of stray shopping carts by\ndeveloping a sensitivity to them.\n\n### Exhibitions/Installation/Publication\n\nThe project has been exhibited in a number of different ways. The first\npresentation of the System as a set of prints in a gallery space was in 2002.\nAt the time this consisted of non-archival inkjet prints pinned to the gallery\nwalls with t-pins. Each Type in the System was a separate print with further\nexamples of each Type taking the form of smaller prints connected by lines of\nassociation. Other sections included Selected Specimens and Site Studies.\nWhile this was not the best way to make a lasting body of work, the method was\nwithin my means at the time and it was flexible enough that it could fill\ndifferent types of gallery spaces.\n\nIn late 2004 I began enlarging specimen images to 25\"x31\" and having them\nprinted as light jet prints (The prints are face mounted to Plexiglas and\nbacked with sintra.). Each image has the Type designation icons and a note\nabout its situation in the lower left hand corner of the piece. I reconfigured\nall of the System information to fit on one 35\"x40\" chart (see System Chart).\n\nMy September 2006 solo show at Black and White gallery was the first time I\nmade use of vinyl lettering and graphic tape to connect the language of the\nproject to the individual pieces. I repeated this approach on a smaller scale\nat the Margulies collection in December 2006, and at several other venues\nsince then.\n\nThe only foray into outdoor sculpture with this project took place at Socrates\nSculpture Park in the Spring of 2008. It was also a departure from my normal\npractice in that I was staging stray cart situations instead of documenting\nthem in the real world. More here.\n\nElements of the the Stray Shopping Cart Project have appeared in print in a\nnumber of different ways. I make a distinction between pieces that are in the\nconceptual \"voice\" of the project and those that are about the project,\nexhibition catalogs, etc. My book, The Stray Shopping Carts of Eastern North\nAmerica: A Guide to Field Identification, represents the most complete\nconceptual manifestation of the project. It also has the distinction of\nwinning the Diagram/Booksellers Prize for the oddest Title of the Year 2006.\n\n# Understanding the System\n\nIn order to encourage a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the\nphenomenon, I have worked for the past six years to develop a system of\nidentification for stray shopping carts. Unlike a Linaean taxonomy, which is\nbased on the shared physical characteristics of living things, this system\nworks by defining the various states and situations in which stray shopping\ncarts can be found. The categories of classification were arrived at by\nobserving shopping carts in different situations and considering the\nconditions and human motives that have placed carts in specific situations and\nthe potential for a cart to transition from one situation to another.\n\nThe resulting Stray Shopping Cart Identification System consists of two\nclasses and thirty-three subtypes that can be used singly or in combination to\ndescribe and thereby \u201cidentify\u201d any found cart. One of the unfortunate\ndifficulties in implementing a situational taxonomy of this kind is that one\nis often required to speculate about where a cart is coming from and where it\nis going next. While this uncertainty can at times be vexing, it must be\nremembered that this system is the first attempt to categorize and analyze the\ntransient nature of the shopping cart. The refinement of this system is an\nongoing process.\n\n## Notes on Identification\n\nBecause the Stray Shopping Cart Identification System considers the situation\na stray cart is in and the potential to transition to new situations, it is\noften not possible to assign Type designations with complete certainty. Some\nTypes, B/2 DAMAGED for example, describe the physical condition the stray cart\nis in; consequently it is relatively easy to assign the B/2 Type designation.\nTypes that describe a cart\u2019s situation in a larger context (A/9 REMOTE FALSE,\nB/1 OPEN TRUE, and many others) cannot be assigned with certainty without\nactively tracking the cart for days or weeks. With long-term tracking often\nbeing out of the question, the observer should take into account the context\nin which he/she finds the cart and construct a likely hypothesis.\n\nOne must keep in mind that a number of Types have significant overlap in their\ndefinitions. For example, a B/3 FRAGMENT is by definition also a B/2 DAMAGED.\nSimilarly, B/10 PLOW CRUSH and B/11 TRAIN DAMAGED are also B/2 DAMAGED. The\noverlap is useful in situations where the specific cause of the damage cannot\nbe determined. In such cases, the B/2 Type alone should be assigned. At some\nlevel, it would be correct to think of B/3, B/10, B/11, and B/20 as subtypes\nof B/2. However, given that this System is based on the situation in which a\ncart is found, these Types must be separate. When assigning Type designations,\nit is not necessary to assign redundant Types. For example, one does not need\nto assign B/2 DAMAGED as well as B/10 PLOW CRUSH.\n\nAnother aspect of the identification process is that a cart may hold multiple\nType designations. For example, a B/14 Archaic cart can simultaneously be a\nB/10 PLOW CRUSH. Some Type designations, once acquired by a specimen, are\nretained (indicated by the R\u2013Arrow icon) throughout all subsequent\ntransitions, while others are lost when a transition occurs. For example, if a\nB/3 FRAGMENT is thrown in the trash, it will acquire the B/19 IN/AS REFUSE\ndesignation, but it will still retain the B/3 designation. When a B/4 ON/AS\nPERSONAL PROPERTY is removed from personal property, the designation is not\nretained. A general rule is that physically damaged or modified carts retain\nthe Types that affected them, while those Types based purely on the\nsituational context in which they are found are lost when a transition to a\nnew situation occurs. One Type outside of this dichotomy is B/14 Archaic,\nwhich is always retained since it is defined by the irreversible event of its\nSOURCE of origin closing.\n\nCLASS A Types can be subject to some CLASS B Types. A common example is that\nwhen an A/1 CLOSE FALSE is vandalized at the edge of the SOURCE lot, it\nacquires the secondary Type of B/12 SIMPLE VANDALISM. Such situations are\nindicated by a green icon with a brown border. A CLASS B cart can acquire a\nCLASS A Type only when a B/1 OPEN TRUE is left at a bus stop, where it becomes\nA/3 BUS STOP DISCARD.\n\n# CLASS A: FALSE STRAYS\n\n1\\. A shopping cart that while on the SOURCE lot is diverted from its primary\nfunction, damaged, or otherwise rendered useless.\n\n2\\. A shopping cart that appears to be a stray cart but that is ultimately\nreturned to service in the SOURCE from which it originated.\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\nView fullsize\n\n# CLASS B: TRUE STRAYS\n\n1\\.
