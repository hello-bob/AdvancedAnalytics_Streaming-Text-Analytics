The company also plans to deepen integration between the Run:ai\nplatform and the NVIDIA DGX Cloud. That\u2019s a service through which NVIDIA\nmanages cloud infrastructure on behalf of enterprise IT organizations that\nbuild and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) applications on top of the\nNVIDIA GPUs and data processing units (DPUs).\n\nThe Run:ai platform is already integrated with NVIDIA DGX in addition to\nproviding support for the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and NVIDIA Base Command\nplatforms as well as NGC containers, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software.\n\nRun:ai enables IT teams to take advantage of container orchestration, so they\ncan schedule AI workloads across multiple GPUs by adding a single code to a\nKubernetes platform. IT teams can then prioritize workloads to maximize GPU\nutilization.\n\nPaul Nashawaty, a practice lead of The Futurum Group, said the acquisition of\nRun:ai represents a strategic effort to address the complexity of AI. At a\ntime when expensive GPUs are also challenging to find, there is a clear need\nto get more out of existing resources. By acquiring Run:ai, NVIDIA is\naddressing an issue that has proven to be especially vexing for data science\nteams building AI applications.\n\nKubernetes in recent years has emerged as the de facto default platform for\ntraining AI models because of its ability to dynamically scale IT\ninfrastructure resources. NVIDIA is now moving to make it simpler to invoke\nthose capabilities via the Run:ai platform. That\u2019s critical: Many data science\nteams still find it challenging to master Kubernetes\u2019s inherent complexities,\nwhich limits the number of people who can train AI models. Organizations\nrunning AI workloads on Kubernetes have typically extended the platform\nthemselves to accommodate a set of workloads that Kubernetes was never\ndesigned to run.\n\nIn the long term, Kubernetes also serves to make it simpler to invoke multiple\ntypes of processors as additional advances are made. That may reduce the\ncurrent dependency data science teams have on GPUs in an era where AI\nworkloads will need to be deployed in the cloud, at the network edge and in\non-premises IT environments, noted Nashawaty.\n\nUltimately, there will be templates based on a standard set of application\nprogramming interfaces (API) at the core Kubernetes platform. As more\norganizations look to operationalize AI technologies, it\u2019s only a matter of\ntime before data scientists are added to the DevOps teams, to contribute their\nexpertise to creating enterprise-class applications. The issue, as always, is\nto make sure the inevitable friction created any time different cultures clash\nis kept to an absolute minimum to ensure applications continue to be built and\ndeployed as quickly as possible.\n\nPhoto credit: Claudiu Constantin on Unsplash\n\nTags: gpukubernetesNvidiaperformancerun:aiworkload management\n\n5 hours ago\n\nMike Vizard\n\nMike Vizard is a seasoned IT journalist with over 25 years of experience.
