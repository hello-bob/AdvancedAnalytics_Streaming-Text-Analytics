Otherwise, we are not\na good one. One of the first ones that caught my eyes was the KISS principle -\nkeep it simple, stupid - and I tried to follow it religiously.\n\nThe benefits can be at some point obvious, making things simple, make them\neasy to understand in the perspective of evolution and also clear to anyone\nthat are seeing the implementation for the first time. Moreover, building\nsolutions in a simple way it\u2019s faster to reach an objective and to understand\nwhat could be the struggles from the scalability perspective.\n\nBut, in my opinion, the issue comes with the \u201cstupid\u201d part of the principle.\nThe reasoning behind my opinion takes in consideration two, let's call it:\npain points.\n\nOne is because when we try to create the solutions with that in mind the\nsimplicity will be lost while we try to make it stupid because too much\nsimplicity will fork into two distinct paths. The one where we are too much\nverbose because we write everything like if the computer needs to understand\nas a plain English what we want to build. On the other hand, we can end up\nimplementing complexity because simplicity can be misleading to abstraction (a\ntopic for a future article).\n\nInnovation is the second negative point about being stupid when following this\nkind of principle. To keep things stupid, we need to be pretty linear and\navoid creating solutions that are out of the box. As a creativity job, that\nseems pretty confusing* and against the idea of why I believe that we end up\nbeing what we are as a worker in the society. Stupidity is one of the\nopposites of being creative (let\u2019s not make confusion with over engineering -\nanother good topic for a future article), and that is what makes me feel\nconfused about KISS.\n\nSo, keep things simple, for the reasons that I mentioned and much more that\ncan be listed. Think about the others, but don\u2019t go for the stupid way. Try to\nbreak walls and make something different and out of the box every time that\nyou have the opportunity.\n\nthis post is real, no AI used to created it.\n\n\u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
