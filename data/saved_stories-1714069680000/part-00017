These charges arise from the defendants\u2019 development,\nmarketing, and operation of a cryptocurrency mixer that executed over $2\nbillion in unlawful transactions and facilitated more than $100 million in\nmoney laundering transactions from illegal dark web markets, such as Silk Road\nand Hydra Market; a web-server intrusion; a spearphishing scheme; and schemes\nto defraud multiple decentralized finance protocols. RODRIGUEZ was arrested\nthis morning and is expected to be presented today or tomorrow before a U.S.\nMagistrate Judge in the Western District of Pennsylvania. HILL was arrested\nthis morning in Portugal based on the U.S. criminal charges. The United States\nwill seek HILL\u2019s extradition to stand trial in the United States. The case is\nassigned to U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman.\n\nIn coordination with law enforcement authorities in Iceland, Samourai\u2019s web\nservers and domain (https://samourai.io/) were seized. Additionally, a seizure\nwarrant for Samourai\u2019s mobile application was served on the Google Play Store.\nAs a result, the application will no longer be available to be downloaded from\nthe Google Play Store in the United States.\n\n> U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: \u201cAs alleged, Keonne Rodriguez and\n> William Lonergan Hill are responsible for developing, marketing, and\n> operating Samourai, a cryptocurrency mixing service that executed over $2\n> billion in unlawful transactions and served as a haven for criminals to\n> engage in large-scale money laundering. Rodriguez and Hill allegedly\n> knowingly facilitated the laundering of over $100 million of criminal\n> proceeds from the Silk Road, Hydra Market, and a host of other computer\n> hacking and fraud campaigns. Together with our law enforcement partners, we\n> will continue to relentlessly pursue and dismantle criminal organizations\n> that use cryptocurrency to hide illicit conduct.\u201d\n\nIRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso said: \u201c$2 billion in\ntransactions with an unlicensed money transmitter means $2 billion flowed\nwithout any oversight, from whomever to wherever. Because of the company\u2019s\ndisregard for regulation, it\u2019s alleged that Samourai Wallet laundered more\nthan $100 million in criminal proceeds. Special Agents with IRS:CI New York\nand IRS:CI LA\u2019s Cyber units worked with our federal and international law\nenforcement partners to not only arrest the founders and CEO, but to also\nseize their domain. Samourai Wallet is now closed for business.\u201d\n\nFBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said: \u201cThreat actors utilize\ntechnology to evade law enforcement detection and create environments\nconducive to criminal activity. For almost 10 years, Keonne Rodriguez and\nWilliam Hill allegedly operated a mobile cryptocurrency mixing platform which\nprovided other criminals a virtual haven for the clandestine exchange of\nillicit funds, the facilitation of more than $2 billion in illegal\ntransactions, and $100 million in dark web money laundering. The FBI is\ncommitted to exposing covert financial schemes and ensuring no one can hide\nbehind a screen to perpetuate financial wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations in the Indictment unsealed today in Manhattan\nfederal Court:[1]\n\nBackground on Samourai\n\nFrom about 2015 through February 2024, RODRIGUEZ and HILL developed, marketed,\nand operated a cryptocurrency mixing service known as Samourai, an unlicensed\nmoney transmitting business from which they earned millions of dollars in\nfees. Samourai unlawfully combined multiple unique features to execute\nanonymous financial transactions valued at over $2 billion for its customers.\nWhile offering Samourai as a \u201cprivacy\u201d service, the defendants knew that it\nwas a haven for criminals to engage in large-scale money laundering and\nsanctions evasion. Indeed, as the defendants intended and well knew, a\nsubstantial portion of the funds that Samourai processed were criminal\nproceeds passed through Samourai for purposes of concealment. During the\nrelevant period, Samourai laundered over $100 million of crime proceeds\noriginating from, among other criminal sources, illegal darkweb markets, such\nas Silk Road and Hydra Market; various wire fraud and computer fraud schemes,\nincluding a web-server intrusion, a spearphishing scheme, and schemes to\ndefraud multiple decentralized finance protocols; and other illegal\nactivities.\n\nRODRIGUEZ and HILL began developing Samourai in or about 2015. Samourai is a\nmobile application that users can download onto their cellphones, and the\napplication has been downloaded over 100,000 times. After users download\nSamourai, they can store their private keys for any BTC addresses they control\ninside of the Samourai program. These private keys are not shared with\nSamourai employees, but Samourai operates a centralized server that, among\nother things, supervises and facilitates transactions between Samourai users\nand creates new BTC addresses used during the transactions. Samourai is used\nby customers all over the world, including customers located in the United\nStates and in the Southern District of New York.\n\nRODRIGUEZ and HILL designed Samourai to offer at least two features intended\nto assist individuals engaged in criminal conduct to conceal the source of the\nproceeds of their criminal activities. First, Samourai offers a cryptocurrency\nmixing service known as \u201cWhirlpool,\u201d which coordinates batches of\ncryptocurrency exchanges between groups of Samourai users to prevent tracing\nof criminal proceeds by law enforcement on the Blockchain. Second, Samourai\noffers a service called \u201cRicochet,\u201d which allows a Samourai user to build in\nadditional and unnecessary intermediate transactions (known as \u201chops\u201d) when\nsending cryptocurrency from one address to another address. This feature\nsimilarly may prevent law enforcement and/or cryptocurrency exchanges from\nrecognizing that a particular batch of cryptocurrency originates from criminal\nactivity. Since the start of the Whirlpool service in or about 2019, and of\nthe Ricochet service in or about 2017, over 80,000 BTC (worth over $2 billion\napplying the BTC-USD conversion rates at the time of each transaction) has\npassed through these two services operated by Samourai. Samourai collects a\nfee for both services, estimated to be about $3.4 million for Whirlpool\ntransactions and $1.1 million for Ricochet transactions over the same time\nperiod.\n\nRODRIGUEZ and HILL\u2019s Knowledge and Intent for Criminal Proceeds to be\nLaundered by Samourai\n\nRODRIGUEZ and HILL operated Twitter accounts that encouraged and openly\ninvited users to launder criminal proceeds through Samourai. For example, in\nor around June 2022, Samourai\u2019s Twitter account \u2014 operated by RODRIGUEZ \u2014\nposted the following message regarding Russian oligarchs seeking to circumvent\nsanctions:\n\nSimilarly, in a private message on or about August 27, 2020, HILL \u2014 using a\nTwitter account with the username \u201cSamourai Dev\u201d \u2014 discussed the use of\nSamourai by criminals operating in online black markets such as Silk Road in\nprivate messages with another Twitter user (the \u201cTwitter User\u201d) (emphasis\nadded):\n\nTwitter User: Silk Road is why I first found Bitcoin and the desire to keep\nengaging in those types of markets is one reason that I want to\ndefend/strengthen those use cases . . .\n\nSamourai Dev: No, not at all. We probably have different views on some basic\ntenets of bitcoin, you and I \u2013 so to each his own so to speak. At Samourai we\nare entirely focused on the censorship resistance and black/grey circular\neconomy. This implies no foreseeable mass adoption, although black/grey\nmarkets have already started to expand during covid and will continue to do so\npost-covid. . . .\n\nAdditionally, in response to Europol highlighting Samourai as a \u201ctop threat\u201d\nto the ability of law enforcement to trace the proceeds of criminal activity,\nHILL posted a message in or around March 2021 suggesting that Samourai would\nnot change its practices in response to allegations that Samourai was being\nused for money laundering:\n\nSimilarly, RODRIGUEZ and HILL possessed and transmitted to potential investors\nmarketing materials that discussed how Samourai\u2019s customer base was intended\nto include criminals seeking privacy or the subversion of safeguards and\nreporting requirements by financial institutions. For example, in Samourai\u2019s\nmarketing materials, RODRIGUEZ and HILL similarly acknowledge that the\nindividuals most likely to use a service like Samourai include individuals\nengaged in criminal activities, including \u201cRestricted Markets.\u201d\n\nIn the below excerpt from Samourai\u2019s marketing materials, RODRIGUEZ and HILL\nacknowledge that its revenues will be derived from \u201cDark/Grey Market\nparticipants\u201d seeking to \u201cswap their bitcoins with multiple parties\u201d to avoid\ndetection:\n\nIn Samourai\u2019s marketing materials, RODRIGUEZ and HILL promoted Samourai\u2019s\nWallet and its \u201cMixing Service\u201d as a \u201cPremium Privacy Service\u201d for\ntransactions involving the proceeds of goods and services that include, among\nother things, \u201cIllicit Activity.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nRODRIGUEZ, 35, of Harmony, Pennsylvania, and HILL, 65, a U.S. national who was\narrested in Portugal, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit\nmoney laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and\none count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business,\nwhich carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\n\nThe maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided\nhere for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will\nbe determined by the judge.\n\nMr. Williams praised the investigative work of IRS-CI and the FBI. He also\nacknowledged the assistance of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of\nInternational Affairs. Mr. Williams also thanked Europol, the Portugal\nJudiciary Police, the Icelandic Police, the FBI Field Office in Pittsburgh,\nthe FBI\u2019s International Operations Division, and the IRS-CI Los Angeles Field\nOffice for their assistance in the investigation of this case.\n\nThis case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit\nand Illicit Finance and Money Laundering Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew\nK. Chan and David R. Felton are in charge of the prosecution.\n\nThe charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations and the\ndefendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\n[1] As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the\nIndictment and the description of the Indictment set forth herein constitute\nonly allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.\n\nContact\n\nNicholas Biase, Lauren Scarff, Shelby Wratchford (212) 637-2600\n\nUpdated April 24, 2024\n\nAttachment\n\nU.S. v.
