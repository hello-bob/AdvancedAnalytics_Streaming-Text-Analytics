Particle physicists seek the more\nfundamental truth underpinning the physical rules we\u2019re familiar with. They\u2019ve\nlong used high-energy particle colliders to test their ideas. By smashing\nparticles together at unfathomable energies, these scientists can discover the\nbuilding blocks of the building blocks \u2014 the high-energy phenomena that happen\nat short distance scales. Those phenomena also tell us about the earliest\nmoments of the universe when it was tiny, dense and incredibly hot.\n\nBut Dunsky learned at the talk that future gravitational wave observatories\nlike the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could be used to\nprobe high-energy physics. LISA would be capable of detecting hypothetical\nobjects called cosmic strings, vast strands of concentrated energy that might\nhave arisen during the universe\u2019s birth. \u201cI got hooked on trying to understand\ngravitational wave signals from the early universe,\u201d said Dunsky, who is now a\ncosmologist and particle physicist at New York University, \u201cand how they could\ntell us about very, very high-energy physics potentially far beyond what we\ncan currently detect with a collider.\u201d\n\nHis turn toward gravitational waves as a way forward for particle physics\nexemplifies a widening interest in the future LISA experiment and, perhaps, a\nbroader shift. Twelve years have passed since the last major discovery at a\nparticle collider. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) in 2012 completed the Standard Model of particle physics, the\nreigning theory of the known elementary particles and forces. And while\ntheorists have since thought up a zoo of possible theories extending the\nStandard Model, it\u2019s not clear that we can build colliders capable of testing\nthese ideas.\n\n\u201cPeople are talking about building colliders in the next 50 years that are 10\ntimes more powerful than the LHC in terms of energy,\u201d said Raman Sundrum, a\ntheoretical particle physicist at the University of Maryland. However, testing\ngrand unified theories, which trace the three forces of the Standard Model to\na single underlying force operating at shorter distances, \u201cwould seem to take\na collider which has 10 billion times the energy of the LHC,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat we can\u2019t produce in a collider, we might be able to observe in nature.\nSpecifically, answers might lie in the gravitational echoes of processes that\nunfolded in the first moments of creation, when the universe was so energetic\nthat physics beyond the Standard Model would have reigned.\n\nDavid Dunsky, a particle physicist and cosmologist at New York University,\nstudies fingerprints of early-universe phase transitions that might be\nobservable by LISA.\n\nEvie Dunsky\n\nThat\u2019s the hope of particle physicists like Dunsky and Sundrum, who are now\nlooking to LISA to test their theories. The mission concept was first\ndeveloped in the early 1980s and formally proposed to the European Space\nAgency (ESA) the following decade. The project was pursued in collaboration\nwith NASA for a time, but the Americans bowed out in 2011 due to budget\nconcerns, forcing Europe to go it alone. This January, however, LISA finally\ngot the go-ahead from ESA, which is now finding industry partners in order to\nbegin construction. The announcement comes after the resounding success in\n2015 and 2016 of a pilot mission, LISA Pathfinder, which tested the future\nobservatory\u2019s key technologies.\n\nLISA is now scheduled to fly in the 2030s. For four years, its array of three\nsatellites will tumble through space in an equilateral triangle some million\nmiles across, bouncing lasers off the golden cubes kept in perfect free fall\nwithin each craft to feel for ripples in space-time.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, we might actually get something directly from that very\nearly epoch\u201d of the universe, said Isabel Garcia Garcia, a particle physicist\nand cosmologist at the University of Washington. If LISA really can pick up\nprimordial gravitational waves, she added, it will be our first glimpse of the\ncosmos\u2019s first moments. \u201cFrom the point of view of particle physics, that is\nobviously incredibly exciting.\u201d\n\n## Lucky LISA\n\nIf indeed LISA manages to detect primordial gravitational waves sometime next\ndecade, it will be due to a stroke of extraordinary cosmic luck.\n\nNo telescope will ever reveal the first moments of creation. Telescopes see\ninto the universe\u2019s past by detecting light that\u2019s traveled from far away. But\nthe first 380,000 years after the Big Bang are hidden behind a sort of cosmic\ncurtain. Back then, the universe was filled with ionized plasma that scattered\nphotons, making it opaque to light.\n\nUnlike light, gravitational waves could ripple freely through the early\nuniverse. Existing ground-based observatories such as LIGO and Virgo probably\naren\u2019t sensitive to these primordial waves. But LISA might be able to hear\nwhat happened onstage before the cosmic curtain rose.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like hearing something in the fog,\u201d Sundrum said.\n\nLike ground-based gravitational wave observatories, LISA will detect ripples\nin space-time by using lasers to precisely measure the distance along its\n\u201carms\u201d \u2014 in this case, the lines in empty space between the three spacecraft\nin its triangular constellation. When a gravitational wave passes by, it\nstretches and contracts space-time. This creates a slight difference in LISA\u2019s\narm lengths, which the instrument can detect by tracking the misalignment of\nthe peaks and troughs of its laser beams. Removed from Earth\u2019s noisy\nenvironment, LISA will be far more sensitive than existing interferometers\nlike LIGO, which has been used to detect black hole and neutron star\ncollisions. It will also be far larger; each of its arms will be nearly 400\ntimes longer than the radius of the Earth.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine; sources: ESA; Nicolas Douillet/ARTEMIS; NASA\n\n## Introduction\n\nEven so, the changes in distance LISA will feel for are extremely small \u2014\nabout 50 times smaller than an atom. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a crazy concept, if you think\nabout it,\u201d said Nora L\u00fctzgendorf, an astrophysicist at ESA and a LISA project\nscientist.\n\nLISA\u2019s size and sensitivity will allow it to observe gravitational waves that\nare much longer than those observable by ground-based interferometers. LIGO\ncan sense gravitational waves with wavelengths between about 30 and 30,000\nkilometers, but LISA can pick up waves ranging in length from a few hundred\nthousand kilometers to a few billion. This will let LISA listen in on\nastrophysical events that ground-based observatories can\u2019t \u201chear,\u201d such as the\nmergers of supermassive black holes (as opposed to star-sized black holes).\nAnd LISA\u2019s wavelength band also happens to be exactly the size that physicists\nexpect from gravitational waves generated in the first moments after the Big\nBang.\n\nHigh-energy physics in the early universe created gravitational ripples, and\nas the universe expanded and space stretched, these waves got blown up to\nenormous dimensions. LISA just happens to be perfectly poised to catch waves\ncreated in the first 10^\u221217 to 10^\u221210 seconds after the Big Bang \u2014 practically\nat the beginning of time. The short end of that range, 10^\u221217 seconds, is a\nperiod so brief that it would fit about as many times into a second as seconds\nfit into the age of the universe.\n\n\u201cThere is this serendipity,\u201d said Chiara Caprini, a theoretical cosmologist at\nthe University of Geneva and CERN. There\u2019s a match between \u201cthe frequency band\nof detection of LISA and this particular epoch in the evolution of the\nuniverse which marks the frontier of our knowledge of particle physics.\u201d\n\n## Beyond the Standard Model\n\nUp to that frontier, the Standard Model does an excellent job of explaining\nhow its flock of 17 elementary particles interact with three forces: the\nelectromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force.\nBut despite its enormous successes, no one thinks that these particles and\nforces are the be-all and end-all of existence.\n\nRaman Sundrum of the University of Maryland discusses how gravitational wave\nsignals could illuminate high-energy particle physics and cosmic inflation.\n\nDeepak Sathyan\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe theory has its flaws. For instance, the mass of the Higgs boson \u2014 the\ncomponent of the Standard Model that determines the masses of other particles\n\u2014 is frustratingly \u201cunnatural.\u201d It appears arbitrary, and puzzlingly small\ncompared to the far greater energy scales of the universe. Moreover, the\nStandard Model offers no explanation for dark matter, nor for the mysterious\ndark energy that drives the accelerating expansion of space. Another problem\nis that antimatter and matter behave exactly the same under the three forces\nof the Standard Model \u2014 which obviously isn\u2019t the full story, since matter\ndominates the universe. And then there\u2019s gravity. The Standard Model\ncompletely ignores the fourth fundamental force, which must be described using\nits own bespoke theory, general relativity.\n\n\u201cSo a lot of theorists like me have been trying to squeeze the Standard Model\na little bit and try to make extensions of it,\u201d said Pierre Auclair, a\ntheoretical cosmologist at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. But\nwithout experimental evidence with which to test them, these extended theories\nremain, well, theoretical.\n\nAuclair is a theorist. \u201cBut still, I\u2019m trying to be linked with experiments as\nmuch as I can,\u201d he said. That\u2019s one reason he was drawn to LISA. \u201cThese\nextensions usually lead to different extreme events in the early universe,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nGarcia Garcia likewise said that LISA\u2019s promise of observational evidence for\nhigh-energy physics led her to rethink her career \u2014 gravitational waves could\n\u201cprobe the early universe in a way no other experiment can,\u201d she said. A few\nyears ago, she started studying gravitational waves and how physics beyond the\nStandard Model would leave fingerprints detectable by LISA.\n\nIsabel Garcia Garcia of the University of Washington has recently been\nfiguring out the possible gravitational wave signatures of bubble walls.\n\nAndrea Kane/Institute For Advanced Study\n\nLast year, Garcia Garcia and her colleagues published work on the\ngravitational wave signature of bubble walls \u2014 energetic barriers between\npockets of space that got trapped in different states as the universe cooled.\nThis cooling happened as the universe expanded. Just as water boils and turns\ninto steam, the universe went through phase transitions. In the Standard\nModel, the phase transition during which a single, \u201celectroweak\u201d force split\ninto separate electromagnetic and weak forces was relatively smooth. But many\nextensions of the theory predict violent events that left the cosmic soup\nfrothy and disturbed, said Dunsky, who also studies topological defects like\nbubble walls.\n\nQuantum fields that permeate our universe have minimum-energy states, or\nground states. And as the universe cooled down, new, lower-energy ground\nstates developed, but a given field didn\u2019t always immediately land in its new\nground state. Some got trapped in local energy minima \u2014 false ground states\nthat only appear stable. Sometimes, though, one little piece of the universe\nwould quantum-tunnel into the true state, nucleating a rapidly expanding\nbubble of true vacuum with a lower energy than the universe outside.\n\n\u201cThese bubbles are very energetic; they\u2019re moving very close to the speed of\nlight due to this pressure difference between their interior and exterior,\u201d\nDunsky said. \u201cSo when they collide, you get this violent collision between\nthese two very relativistic objects, somewhat similar to how black holes emit\nstrong gravitational waves right before colliding.\u201d\n\n## Strings and Walls\n\nMore speculatively, phase transitions in the early universe could also have\ncreated structures called cosmic strings and domain walls \u2014 enormous strands\nand sheets, respectively, of dense energy.\n\nThese structures arise when a quantum field\u2019s ground state changes in such a\nway that there is more than one new ground state, each equally valid. This can\nresult in high-energy defects along the borders between pockets of the\nuniverse that happened to fall into different, but equally favorable, ground\nstates.\n\nThe cosmologist Chiara Caprini of the University of Geneva and CERN studies\nthe forms of gravitational waves that might have been produced by primordial\nphase transitions.\n\nTristan Paviot\n\nThe process is a bit like the way certain rocks develop natural magnetism as\nthey cool, said Dunsky, who has studied the observable fingerprints of the\nprocess. At high temperatures, atoms are randomly oriented. But at cool\ntemperatures, it becomes energetically favorable for them to magnetically\nalign \u2014 the ground state changes. Without some external magnetic field to\norient the atoms, they\u2019re free to line themselves up any which way. All\n\u201cchoices\u201d are equally valid, and different domains of the mineral will, by\nchance, make different choices. The magnetic field generated by all the atoms\nbends dramatically at the borders between domains.\n\nSimilarly, the quantum fields in different regions of the universe \u201cmust\nchange rapidly at the boundary\u201d of these domains, he said, resulting in large\nenergy densities at these boundaries that \u201csignify the presence of a domain\nwall or cosmic string.\u201d\n\nThese cosmic strings and domain walls, if they exist, would have stretched out\nto span practically the entire universe as space expanded. These objects\nproduce gravitational waves as kinks propagate along them and as loops\noscillate and form cusps. But the energy scales of these waves were mostly set\nas the objects formed in the first moments of the universe. And LISA could\ndetect them, if they exist.\n\n## Echoes of Creation\n\nThe gravitational waves reaching us from the very early universe will not\narrive in neatly packaged chirps, like the signals of black hole collisions.\nBecause they happened so early in time, such signals have since been stretched\nout across all of space. They\u2019ll echo from every direction, from every point\nin space, all at once \u2014 a background gravitational hum.\n\n\u201cYou turn on your detector, and it\u2019s always there,\u201d Garcia Garcia said.\n\nPatterns in this background would probably \u201cjust look like noise to the\naverage person,\u201d Sundrum said. \u201cBut secretly, there\u2019s a hidden code.\u201d\n\nOne important clue will be the background signal\u2019s spectrum \u2014 its strength at\ndifferent frequencies. If we think of a gravitational wave signal as sound,\nits spectrum would be a plot of pitch versus volume. Truly random white noise\nwould have a flat spectrum, Auclair said. But gravitational waves unleashed\nduring phase transitions or cast from cosmic strings or domain walls would be\nloudest at specific frequencies. Auclair has worked on calculating the\nspectral signatures of cosmic strings, which throw out gravitational waves at\ncharacteristic wavelengths when their kinks and loops evolve. And Caprini\nstudies how violent phase transitions would leave their own mark on the\ngravitational wave background.\n\nAnother approach, which Sundrum and his colleagues outlined in 2018 and\nrecently elaborated, would be to try to map the overall intensity of the\nbackground across the sky. This would make it possible to look for\nanisotropies, or patches that are just a tiny bit louder or quieter than\naverage.\n\n\u201cThe problem,\u201d Caprini said, \u201cis that this kind of signal has practically the\nsame characteristics of the instrument noise. So the entire question is how to\nbe able to distinguish it once we detect something.\u201d\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### An Enormous Gravity \u2018Hum\u2019 Moves Through the Universe\n\n  2. ### Some Physicists See Signs of Cosmic Strings From the Big Bang\n\n  3. ### Physicists Hunt for the Big Bang\u2019s Triangles\n\nLISA is more like a microphone than a telescope. Instead of peering in a\nparticular direction, it will listen to the whole sky at once. It will hear\nprimordial gravitational waves if they are present. But it will also hear the\nchirps and howls of merging black holes, neutron stars and the many pairs of\nwhite dwarf stars within our galaxy. In order for LISA to detect a background\nof primordial gravitational waves, all other signals will need to be carefully\nidentified and removed. Filtering out the true signal from the early universe\nwill be like picking out the sound of a spring breeze at a construction site.\n\nBut Sundrum chooses to be hopeful. \u201cWe\u2019re not crazy to be doing the research,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard for experimentalists. It\u2019ll be hard for the public to\npay for the various things that need to get done. And it\u2019ll be hard for\ntheorists to calculate their way past all of the uncertainties and errors and\nbackgrounds and so on.\u201d\n\nBut still, Sundrum added, \u201cit appears to be possible. With a little luck.\u201d\n\nBy Elise Cutts\n\nContributing Writer\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nBig Bangcosmologyfundamental physicsgravitational wavesinflationparticle\nphysicstheoretical physicsAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Physics\n\ngeometry\n\n### Geometers Engineer New Tools to Wrangle Spacecraft Orbits\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n2\n\nRead Later\n\nThe Joy of Why\n\n### Can Information Escape a Black Hole?\n\nBy Janna Levin\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n4\n\nRead Later\n\nastronomy\n\n### How the Ancient Art of Eclipse Prediction Became an Exact Science\n\nBy Joshua Sokol\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n2\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
