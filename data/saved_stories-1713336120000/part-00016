But even the scientists leading the study say letting go of fossil\nfuels is a much-preferred response to climate change\n\nChristian Thorsberg\n\nDaily Correspondent\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nResearchers from the University of Washington conducted an initial experiment\nof cloud brightening technology in Alameda, California, on San Francisco Bay.\nFrank Chen via Getty Images\n\nEarlier this month, scientists from the University of Washington gathered in\nsemi-clandestine fashion on the deck of a decommissioned aircraft carrier in\nSan Francisco Bay.\n\nLeading an experiment that was intentionally kept under the radar to minimize\npublic backlash, the team started up a high-powered spraying machine and shot\nmicroscopic salt aerosol particles hundreds of feet into the morning air.\n\nThe trial, meant to test how well these aerosols could travel outside of the\nlab, is a basis for a much grander future experiment: using the particles to\nartificially brighten clouds. The innovation could help clouds reflect more\nlight and keep Earth\u2019s surface a little bit cooler.\n\n\u201cIf you increase the number of cloud droplets by increasing the number of sea\nsalt particles, it\u2019s like increasing the number of mirrors to reflect sunlight\nback to space,\u201d Rob Wood, the lead scientist of the university\u2019s Marine Cloud\nBrightening Program, tells the San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s Anthony Edwards.\n\nThe program\u2019s simulations estimate that brightening 15 percent of the planet\u2019s\nmarine clouds with this method would cool the Earth by about one degree\nFahrenheit. But in the real world, uncertainties remain. Getting the correct\nsize and concentration of the particles, for example, is key. Too large or too\nmany, and they\u2019ll contribute to increased precipitation. Too small, on the\nother hand, and the particles won\u2019t have any noticeable reflective effect.\n\nChanges to the size and number of droplets in clouds can change how much\nsunlight those clouds reflect back into space. University of Washington\n\nThe test last week took place in Alameda, California, on the USS Hornet, which\noperates as a Smithsonian Affiliate museum. It was the first cloud brightening\nexperiment ever conducted in North America, and just the second in the world.\nFour years ago, researchers near Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef carried out a\nsimilar study in hopes that cloud brightening could protect the region\u2019s\ncorals from bleaching in over-warm waters.\n\nBoth experiments fall under the umbrella of geoengineering, a discipline that\ndescribes the variety of technological approaches scientists are exploring to\nhelp slow or reverse climate change. But the current project\u2014and the field,\nmore broadly\u2014has drawn skepticism for the unknown risks and consequences of\ntampering with the weather.\n\n\u201cYou could well be changing climatic patterns, not just over the sea, but over\nland as well,\u201d David Santillo, a senior scientist at Greenpeace International\nwho was not involved with the project, tells the New York Times. \u201cThis is a\nscary vision of the future that we should try and avoid at all costs.\u201d\n\nScientists don\u2019t completely understand some of the possible consequences of\nlaunching large amounts of salt aerosols into the atmosphere. For instance,\nthe practice could change ocean circulation patterns or drive unexpected\nweather\u2014which could, in turn, impact fisheries or farms, writes E&E News\u2019\nCorbin Hiar.\n\nMarine Cloud Brightening Project\n\nWatch on\n\nThough the Biden administration has funded research on marine cloud\nbrightening, per the New York Times, the White House noted to the publication\nthat it did not take part in this particular study: \u201cThe U.S. government is\nnot involved in the Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) experiment taking place\nin Alameda, CA, or anywhere else.\u201d\n\nOver the next several months, the team will analyze the results of this study,\nexamining whether the particles maintained the proper size as they entered the\natmosphere. Locally, it remains to be seen when and how future experiments\nwill be carried out.\n\n\u201cSince this experiment was kept under wraps until the test started, we are\neager to see how public engagement is being planned and who will be involved,\u201d\nShuchi Talati, the executive director of the Alliance for Just Deliberation on\nSolar Geoengineering who did not participate in the experiment, tells E&E\nNews.\n\nMeanwhile, human-fueled changes to climate and weather patterns continue to\nbreak monthly and yearly heat records, affecting communities across the globe.\nAmid these trends, even the scientists leading the experiment agree that\ncurbing fossil fuel emissions\u2014rather than sending additional particles into\nthe atmosphere\u2014is the best course of action.\n\n\u201cI hope, and I think all my colleagues hope, that we never use these things,\nthat we never have to,\u201d Sarah Doherty, an atmospheric scientist at the\nUniversity of Washington and the manager of its Marine Cloud Brightening\nProgram, tells the New York Times.\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nChristian Thorsberg | READ MORE\n\nChristian Thorsberg is an environmental writer and photographer from Chicago.\nHis work, which often centers on freshwater issues, climate change and\nsubsistence, has appeared in Circle of Blue, Sierra magazine, Discover\nmagazine and Alaska Sporting Journal.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1.
