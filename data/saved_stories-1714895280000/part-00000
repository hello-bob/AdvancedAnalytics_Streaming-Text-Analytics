But first\nit needs to climb a mountain halfway around the globe\n\nBy Rahul Rao\n\nA worker shines a flashlight into the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's camera.\n\nJ. Ramseyer Orrell/SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory/NOIRLab (CC BY 4.0)\n\nBy late next year, if all goes to plan, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will\nhave started its 10-year survey of the solar system, Milky Way and galaxies\nbeyond. Its giant eye on the southern skies is a 3.2-gigapixel camera with the\nsize and weight of a small car. By mass and pixel resolution, it is the\nlargest digital camera on Earth. It will scan the cosmos from atop a mountain\ncalled Cerro Pach\u00f3n in northern Chile.\n\nThere is just one hitch: the delicate, nearly three-metric-ton machine is\ncurrently some 10,000 kilometers away in the hills above San Francisco Bay,\nwhere its builders have put it through final tests. In the coming weeks the\nprecisely engineered camera will begin a tense intercontinental voyage in\nwhich it will be flown by cargo plane, hauled by truck and painstakingly\nescorted up twisty mountain roads.\n\nThe daunting logistics fall to members of an obscure but consequential\nengineering subfield dedicated to keeping multimillion-dollar astronomy\nhardware intact in transit. This is \u201ca very obvious and visible moment when\nthings can go wrong,\u201d says engineer Margaux Lopez of the Rubin Observatory and\nthe SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, who is in charge of the effort.\n\nThe Rubin camera\u2019s journey begins in a clean room in Silicon Valley, where\nSLAC will outfit the camera with a steel-and-wire-rope exoskeleton. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nframe sitting on springs on another frame, essentially,\u201d says SLAC and Rubin\nengineer Martin Nordby. This shield will keep the camera tucked within the\nconfines of a standard shipping container and protect its delicate innards\nfrom vibrations. Then, over two days in May, SLAC personnel will drive the\ncamera\u2019s container and 49 crates of equipment to San Francisco International\nAirport, where everything will be packed aboard a chartered Boeing 747 cargo\nplane for the 16-hour flight to the Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez International\nAirport in Santiago, Chile.\n\nThe Rubin team is relatively lucky: parts of other telescopes in development,\nalso bound for observatories under Chile\u2019s exceptionally clear skies, must\nspend weeks traveling at sea. When the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope\nsends its five-story-tall support structure\u2014too large to fit into a freight\naircraft\u2014from Germany to Chile, it will have to do so via break-bulk cargo\nship by way of Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nThe Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)\u2019s giant mirrors are taking the ocean route\nfrom Europe to Chile, too. \u201cHistorically..., we shipped mostly everything by\nplane, but with the new type of sizes we\u2019re talking about with the ELT, planes\neither are not big enough or the costs are ridiculously high,\u201d says Herv\u00e9\nKurlandczyk, an engineer for the European Southern Observatory, who works on\nELT and isn\u2019t involved with the Rubin project.\n\nPhysical damage is always a threat, no matter the route or mode of transport.\nAstronomy, by design, requires some of the most delicate components in the\nworld. Anything from bumps in the road to turbulence in the air can rattle\nsensitive electronics or jostle painstakingly placed parts out of alignment.\nMirrors, including Rubin\u2019s pieces that arrived in Chile in 2019, may require\nrefrigeration and humidity controls or risk damage to their coating.\n\n## Curated by Our Editors\n\n  * ### Collapsing Sheets of Spacetime Could Explain Dark Matter and Why the Universe \u2018Hums\u2019\n\nAnil Ananthaswamy\n\n  * ### After Months of Gibberish, Voyager 1 Is Communicating Well Again\n\nMeghan Bartels\n\n  * ### How Jeff Koons\u2019s Lunar Artwork Could Outlast All of Humanity\n\nDavid W.

Its Hiding Places Are Running Out\n\nPhilip Plait\n\nTransit brings other possible headaches that are familiar to anyone\nexperienced in international shipping. Bad weather and other snafus can\nredirect or stall transports. Several years ago miscommunication caused the\ncontainer ship carrying part of the Simons Observatory to sit at anchor for\ntwo weeks off Chile, leaving observatory staff scratching their head in port.\nEven observatories need to clear customs, especially when exiting the U.S.;\nastronomical instruments made in the U.S. may, for example, run into\ngovernment export controls designed to keep advanced optical technology within\nthe country\u2019s borders.\n\nAll these worries mean engineers try \u201cto control, as much as possible, every\nsingle step of the whole chain,\u201d Kurlandczyk says. Although Santiago is on the\nother side of the equator from San Francisco, SLAC will continue to oversee\nthe camera\u2019s transit within Chile. Once the 747 lands, its cargo will be\nloaded into a caravan of nine vehicles\u2014each similar to the curtain-side trucks\nused to transport beverages and outfitted with air-ride suspensions for\nadditional protection from vibrations. The caravan\u2019s six-hour road trip to the\nbase of Cerro Pach\u00f3n will be a prelude to the most arduous part of the voyage:\ngetting the camera from the base of the mountain to the observatory atop one\nof its peaks.\n\nRubin Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/H. Stockebrand (CC BY 4.0)\n\nThis last leg will be a 35-kilometer journey up a winding snake of dirt roads\nand switchbacks. It will be narrow and perilous, and the observatory at the\ntop won\u2019t be able to receive more than one truck at a time, so the process\nwill take three days, with three trucks per day. And the truck carrying the\ncamera itself, escorted in front and behind by observatory vehicles, will be\nable to travel no faster than 10 kilometers per hour. Lopez says the camera\u2019s\nascent will take five hours to make a trip that takes most other cargo about\n90 minutes.\n\nLopez and her colleagues can take some comfort in the fact that they\u2019ve\nalready practiced almost every step of the trip using dummies with the same\nmass as the telescope parts. They\u2019ve loaded these weights into trucks driven\nup and down the freeways of the San Francisco Peninsula and along Chilean\nroads; they\u2019ve even rehearsed the flight from California to Chile.\n\n\u201cEvery time we handle something, it\u2019s essentially the first time it\u2019s ever\nbeen done,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of effort to figure out ways to\npractice these delicate procedures with something that is not as fragile\nbefore we do it with, you know, $25-million optics.\u201d\n\nMore than five years of preparation have gone into the camera\u2019s six-day\njourney. \u201cThis has to work. It has to be successful. We cannot break anything\nalong the way or lose anything or\u2014pick your favorite failure mode,\u201d Lopez\nsays. \u201cBut we have a really solid logistics plan, and we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nRahul Rao is a London-based freelance science writer covering physics, space,\ntechnology and their intersections with one another and everything else.
