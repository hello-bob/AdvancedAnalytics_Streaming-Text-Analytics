Which still seems less newsworthy\nthan that anyone is buying at all: even at roughly $26 per share, investors\nare prizing Mr Trump\u2019s social-media platform, Truth Social, at a heroic value\nrelative to its performance or apparent potential.\n\nOne must write \u201croughly\u201d $26 per share because even the Wall Street Journal\nhas struggled to ascertain just how many shares are outstanding. Other\npossible red flags for investors include the company\u2019s independent auditor\nreported on March 25th that its \u201coperating losses raise substantial doubt\nabout its ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. After forecasting sales of\n$144m for 2023, Truth Social delivered just $4.1m, and a loss of $58.2m.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Try The Economist for free\n\n### Explore all our independent journalism with a one-month free trial.
