On February 12, criminals used compromised credentials to\nremotely access a Change Healthcare Citrix portal, an application used to\nenable remote access to desktops. The portal did not have multi-factor\nauthentication. Once the threat actor gained access, they moved laterally\nwithin the systems in more sophisticated ways and exfiltrated data. Ransomware\nwas deployed nine days later.\u201d\n\nHudson Rock researchers investigated the hack and identified an employee of\nChange Healthcare that was infected by an Infostealer on February 7th, this\nemployee only had a single credential associated with Change Healthcare \u2014 a\nCitrix account:\n\nScreenshot from Cavalier, Hudson Rock\u2019s platform\n\nThe login data which is used to access\nhttps://remoteapps(.)changehealthcare(.)com/vpn/index.html can be confirmed to\nbe the company\u2019s Citrix server, which no longer works, thanks to an old\narchive from an employee manual that was indexed on Scribd:\n\nIndexed Scribd document showing the URL is associated with the Change\nHealthcare\u2019s Citrix server\n\nWhile it is not certain that these are the specific credentials used for the\nattack, in terms of timeline it matches perfectly.\n\nHaving investigated the infected computer, Hudson Rock researchers discovered\nthe employee was infected by downloading a file from file sharing website\nMega.nz, typically threat actors attempt to get victims to download password\nprotected RARs/ZIPs and execute them to get infected:\n\nScreenshot from the download history of the infected employee\n\nCredentials obtained from info-stealer infections, which have become the\nprimary initial attack vector in recent years, provide threat actors with easy\nentry points into companies, facilitating data breaches and ransomware\nattacks.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to underscore that Hudson Rock had the data of this employee\u2019s\ncompromised data a day after the infection, highlighting a missed opportunity\nto preemptively safeguard against this incident.\n\nInfo-stealer infections as a cybercrime trend surged by an incredible 6000%\nsince 2018, positioning them as the primary initial attack vector used by\nthreat actors to infiltrate organizations and execute cyberattacks, including\nransomware, data breaches, account overtakes, and corporate espionage.\n\nTo learn more about how Hudson Rock protects companies from imminent\nintrusions caused by info-stealer infections of employees, partners, and\nusers, as well as how we enrich existing cybersecurity solutions with our\ncybercrime intelligence API, please schedule a call with us, here:\nhttps://www.hudsonrock.com/schedule-demo\n\nHudson Rock provides access to various free cybercrime intelligence tools that\nyou can find here: www.hudsonrock.com/free-tools\n\nPrevPrevious\n\n## Don\u2019t Stop Here\n\n## More To Explore\n\n### Distribution of Infostealer Made With Electron\n\nAhnLab SEcurity intelligence Center (ASEC) has discovered an Infostealer\nstrain made with Electron.
