I published this edition\nwhen this newsletter had a few hundred subscribers; now there are roughly\n25,000 of you. Since I love this bit of forgotten history that connects\ndistant past with technological present, I\u2019ve decided to resurrect it for your\nenjoyment. I\u2019ll be back with a new edition early next week\u2014one of the wildest\nstories you\u2019ve probably never heard.\n\n###\n\nI: They just don\u2019t name \u2018em like they used to\n\nThis is the tale of an ancient and long forgotten Viking king, the scattered\nbones of his grandson, a curious calamity during the English civil war, and\nthe origin story for the name and logo of a modern technology that you\u2019re\nlikely to use today.\n\nAround 958, Harald Gormsson became the Viking king of Denmark. As his name\nsuggests, he was the son of King Gorm the Old (they just don\u2019t name kings as\nwell as they used to, do they? Charles III? C\u2019mon.). There aren\u2019t many sources\nfrom the period, but we do know that he was an accomplished builder of public\nworks and engaged in various foreign adventures with varying success. (Just\nimagine Harald\u2019s humiliation upon being forced to surrender not once, but\ntwice, to the Swedish prince Styrbj\u00f6rn the Strong).\n\nKing Harald is partly known to history for bringing Christianity to his\nkingdom. Initially skeptical of this newfangled God, one chronicle alleges\nthat Harald was convinced to convert by a cleric named Poppa. Harald put Poppa\nto the test, daring him to prove his divine righteousness. Poppa is said to\nhave placed a great weight of iron into a fire, then took it out, walked\naround holding it, and miraculously he was not burned.\n\nBut for our story, there are two aspects of Harald\u2019s reign that matter most.\n\nAt some point, Harald suffered a devastating loss, but this time it was not a\nloss on the battlefield, but in his mouth. One tooth is said to have died,\nturning a blueish-grey color. In a time in which photographs didn\u2019t exist and\nyou couldn\u2019t just look someone up on Google images to see what they looked\nlike, distinctive features were used to describe prominent individuals.\n\nHarald \u201cBluetooth\u201d was his new name\u2014and that\u2019s how he would be known to\nhistory.\n\nThen, in 970, the king of Norway, Harald Greycloak\u2014I told you the names were\ngood\u2014was assassinated. That meant that for a brief period, the kingdoms of\nDenmark and Norway were united (though as this map shows, it wasn\u2019t quite the\nvast expanse of land that those countries comprise today).\n\nMap of Harald Bluetooth\u2019s lands, courtesy of Wikimedia. His lands are in red,\nwhile allied vassal territory is in yellow.\n\nNonetheless, Harald Bluetooth had connected two empires\u2014empires that, until\nhis reign, were deemed incompatible, unable to work together.\n\n###\n\nII: The rise of modern bluetooth\n\nNow, our story fast-forwards more than 1,000 years.\n\nIn the late 1990s, four major technology companies were working together to\nsolve a common problem: lots of people were using computers and lots of people\nwere using mobile phones, but they were incompatible, unable to work together,\ntwo separate kingdoms of technology. It was time to fix that, by inventing a\nway to unify them.\n\nIn 1997, Sven Mattisson of the Ericsson firm flew to Canada to meet with his\ncounterpart at Intel\u2014an American named Jim Kardach. They gave a presentation\nabout their new technology, and it was met with a limp reception. Maybe it\nwould work, but it didn\u2019t seem to generate much excitement. The two men were\nundeterred, however, convinced that they mostly had a branding problem.\n\nFor some reason, nobody was enthusiastic about their product, which was\nvariously called \u201cBiz-RF, MC-Link or Low Power RF.\u201d\n\nDejected after the meeting, the two men decided to go out for drinks. Kardach,\na history enthusiast, took the opportunity to ask Mattisson about the Vikings.\nIt dominated the remainder of the conversation, and at one point, Mattisson\nmentioned a long-forgotten Viking king with a dead tooth, a skilled\ncommunicator who was known for linking two kingdoms together. They had their\ncodename: Bluetooth.\n\nWhen it came time to decide on a logo, they decided to be true to the\ntechnology\u2019s historical roots. They took the Viking rune for \u201cH\u201d for Harald,\nand the rune for \u201cB\u201d for Bluetooth, slapped them on top of each other, and the\nlogo we still use today was born.\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t end there.\n\n###\n\nIII: Sweyn Forkbeard and Winchester\u2019s Mortuary Chests\n\nHarald was killed when his son, Sweyn Forkbeard, rose up against him. And here\nis where we get what was, perhaps, the most unusually named king of England,\nbecause Sweyn soon invaded England and, on Christmas Day, 1013, England\nproclaimed a new monarch: King Forkbeard.\n\nSweyn Forkbeard was king of England for five weeks, then died.\n\nBut Sweyn\u2019s son\u2014Harald Bluetooth\u2019s grandson\u2014provides us with the final twist\nin this Viking-turned-Anglo-Saxon saga. His name was Cnut, and he was\nproclaimed king of England in 1016.\n\nCnut is often known to children as a fool who tried to show that he was more\npowerful than God, by placing his throne next to the sea and commanding the\ntide to bow to his wishes, keeping him dry. Inevitably, the tide did not obey.\nBut this oft-repeated story is an inversion of the real tale from contemporary\nchronicles.\n\nIn truth, Cnut was trying to show that even he, an earthly king, was nothing\ncompared to the will of the divine. His story, which is widely known as a\nparable of arrogance, is the opposite of the real story, which is one of a\nking showing humility in contrast to the forces of nature.\n\nWhen Cnut died in 1035, he was buried at Winchester. His bones were put in a\nmortuary chest, a box to be displayed next to the altar of the Old Minster,\nthe Anglo-Saxon cathedral. His bones were moved to the new Norman\ncathedral\u2014the one still standing today\u2014which was built by William the\nConqueror in 1079. Cnut\u2019s remains were placed in the new church shortly after\nthe building was consecrated in 1093.1\n\nToday, visitors to Winchester Cathedral from Denmark will sometimes eagerly\nask tour guides: \u201cWhere is the grave of King Cnut?\u201d But the answer they must\ngive, due to a bizarre twist from English history, is not so straightforward.\n\nIn the early 1500s, the Winchester bishop, Richard Foxe, decided to replace\nthe mortuary chests that housed the bones of many of the Viking, Anglo-Saxon,\nand early Norman kings who had been laid to rest in the Cathedral. The array\nof remains in various caskets and boxes and sarcophagi were cluttering the\narea around the altar. To tidy it up, he produced spectacularly decorated\nmortuary chests that have colloquially become known as \u201cFoxe\u2019s Boxes.\u201d Each of\nthem was lovingly labeled with the name of the monarch or monarchs who were\ninside.\n\n(Photo: One of the mortuary chests in Winchester Cathedral, known as Foxe\u2019s\nBoxes. This is the one that originally contained Cnut, written here as\n\u201cCanute\u201d).\n\nBut then, in December of 1642, during the English civil war, Winchester\nCathedral was attacked by Oliver Cromwell\u2019s rebel army. His troops smashed\nwindows, shot statues, and generally ransacked the place.2 Someone in the\nregiment saw the mortuary chests and probably wrongly assumed that they were\nfull of gold, or possibly jewels. Instead, as he flung the lids open, he was\nmet with the sight of a lot of musty old bones, including the bones of King\nCnut.\n\nRather than doing the respectful, normal thing\u2014closing the lid and continuing\nto ransack elsewhere\u2014the soldier had a brainwave: he could throw the bones at\nstained glass windows to destroy them. And that\u2019s what he and others appear to\nhave done. They threw the bones of some of the most important early kings of\nEngland at windows, hoping to maximize their destruction.\n\nWhen the troops left, the townspeople found smashed glass and scattered bones\nthroughout the Cathedral. Unfortunately, nobody had anticipated that this\nmight happen, so the various bones weren\u2019t exactly labelled (there was no\nPost-It note indicating that this was, indeed, Cnut\u2019s femur and not William\nII\u2019s or King Aethelwulf\u2019s). As a result, the only thing that could be done was\nto just jumble up all the bones and stuff them back in Foxe\u2019s Boxes, so that\u2019s\nwhat they did.\n\nSubsequent radiocarbon dating in the last decade has confirmed that the right\npeople are in the boxes, but there isn\u2019t sufficient precision to say that this\nskull belongs to Aethelwulf, only that they\u2019re from roughly the right time\nperiod.3\n\nSo, when tour guides are asked to take visitors to the remains of King Cnut,\nall they can really do is point to the six boxes above the presbytery of the\nCathedral and say: \u201cCnut is probably in four or five of those boxes.\u201d Nobody\nknows which bit of him is in which chest.\n\nBut the next time you click that strange looking logo and use Bluetooth to\nlisten to your music or connect your mobile phone to your car, think about how\nyou, like King Harald, are\u2014in some small way\u2014connecting two kingdoms, a little\nglimpse of a forgotten saga from Viking and Anglo-Saxon history.\n\nThank you for reading The Garden of Forking Paths.

Those initially came from a nearby hunting forest, which\nwas chopped down for the building. With that forest gone, the king needed to\nestablish a new forest to replace the old one. That replacement is what we now\ncall The New Forest National Park.\n\n2\n\nOne bit of the cathedral was undamaged: the Chantry Chapel of William of\nWykeham\u2014a 14th Century bishop who founded New College, Oxford (where I\ncompleted my DPhil). In the invading army that attacked the cathedral during\nthe English Civil War in 1642, there was a soldier named Nathaniel Fiennes,\nwho knew that William of Wykeham was his ancestor. He stood guard, preventing\ndamage to his ancestor\u2019s tomb. Both William of Wykeham and Nathaniel Fiennes\nare direct ancestors of Ranulph Fiennes (the explorer) and Ralph Fiennes (the\nactor). The full surname of Ralph Fiennes is Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, and\nthe second part comes from William of Wykeham\u2019s lieneage.\n\n3\n\nYou may have heard of Alfred the Great. His bones are not in these chests. His\nremains were later moved to a place called Hyde Abbey, which is a mile or so\naway from the cathedral. The abbey was destroyed and the remains were lost.\nAlfred\u2019s bones are missing.\n\n### Subscribe to The Garden of Forking Paths\n\nBy Brian Klaas \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nWandering around an infinitely complex, ever changing world.\n\n22 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n4 Restacks\n\n22\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Bluetooth Viking and the Scattered Bones of King Cnut\n\nwww.forkingpaths.co\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nThe Myth of the Secret Genius\n\nFrom Elon Musk to Elizabeth Holmes and Donald Trump, many very rich people are\neffective at convincing us of a myth: they're secretly a genius, and...\n\nNov 30, 2022 \u2022\n\nBrian Klaas\n\n507\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Myth of the Secret Genius\n\nwww.forkingpaths.co\n\n6\n\nThe Case for Amplifying Trump's Insanity\n\nThe \"Banality of Crazy\" has warped American politics, as few voters recognize\njust how deranged, delusional, and dangerous Donald Trump is...because the...\n\nOct 1, 2023 \u2022\n\nBrian Klaas\n\n416\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Case for Amplifying Trump's Insanity\n\nwww.forkingpaths.co\n\n49\n\nMy \"Life in the UK\" Test and a Great British Travel Guide\n\nI passed my \"Life in the UK\" test and will soon (hopefully) become a dual\ncitizen of the US and UK.
