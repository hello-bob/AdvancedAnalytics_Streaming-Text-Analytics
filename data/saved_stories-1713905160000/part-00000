Follow along as I take apart one of these cable modems\nand try to get it to work again, nearly forty years after the original NABU\nNetwork service shut down. We'll delve briefly into how cable TV tuners work,\nincluding frequency mixers, tunable oscillators and phase-locked loops (PLLs),\nautomatic gain control, quadrature demodulators, and offset quadrature phase\nshift keyed (O-QPSK) demodulation using discrete logic chips. Equipment used\ninclude an oscilloscope, RF signal generator, RF spectrum analyzer, digital\nlogic analyzer, voltmeter, and continuity tester.
