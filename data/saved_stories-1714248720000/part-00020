With its ability to build realistic and imaginative scenes from\ntext instructions, the model has taken the tech world by storm.\n\nCompared with Sora, Vidu is able to understand and generate Chinese elements\nsuch as the panda and dragon.\n\nThe company also added that the core architecture of the large model was\ninitiated in September 2022, which was earlier than Sora's adoption of its\narchitecture.\n\nPhoto\n\n2024 ZGC Forum opens in Beijing\n\nFantastic robots and Chinese exhibitors shine at Hannover Messe 2024\n\nZhongguancun Forum to be held in Beijing from April 25 to 29\n\nAerospace exhibition to open in Wuhan\n\nCanton Fair puts focus on household commodities\n\nTourists gravitate to color floral seas throughout China\n\nMost Viewed in 24 Hours\n\n    * China's first Sora-level text-to-video large model Vidu unveiled\n    * 2024 ZGC Forum opens in Beijing\n    * Top 10 most valuable Chinese automobile brands\n    * Zuoyebang raises curtain on educational tech products\n    * Pikachu towers over Shanghai shopping mall\n\nState Council News\n\nChina unveils regulations to facilitate operation of int'l cruises\n\nChinese premier chairs State Council executive meeting\n\nTop 10\n\nTop 10 intl travel destinations for Chinese rich\n\nBusiness focus\n\nChinese restaurants taking 'takeout' to new extremes in global expansion push\n\nThe fit and proper way to turn over a new leaf\n\nChina Data\n\nA look at China's economic data in Q1 of 2024\n\nSOEs\n\nSOE profits, share value prioritized\n\nPillar rock in midstream\n\nSpecial\n\nYouth Forum\n\nBoao Forum 2024\n\nTop\n\nBACK TO THE TOP\n\nEnglish\n\n\u4e2d\u6587\n\n  * HOME\n  * CHINA\n  * WORLD\n  * BUSINESS\n  * LIFESTYLE\n  * CULTURE\n  * TRAVEL\n  * WATCHTHIS\n  * SPORTS\n  * OPINION\n  * REGIONAL\n  * FORUM\n  * NEWSPAPER\n\n    * China Daily PDF\n    * China Daily E-paper\n  * MOBILE\n\nCopyright 1995 - 2024 .
