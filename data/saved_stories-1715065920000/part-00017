PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nStablecoins\n\nMORE than 90 per cent of stablecoin transaction volumes are not coming from\ngenuine users, according to a new metric co-developed by Visa, suggesting such\ncrypto tokens may be far away from becoming a commonly used means of payment.\n\nThe dashboard from Visa and Allium Labs is designed to strip out transactions\ninitiated by bots and large-scale traders to isolate those made by real\npeople. Out of about US$2.2 trillion in total transactions in April, just\nUS$149 billion originated from \u201corganic payments activity\u201d, according to Visa.\n\nVisa\u2019s finding challenges stablecoin proponents\u2019 argument that the tokens,\npegged to an asset such as the US dollar, are poised to revolutionise the\nUS$150 trillion payments industry. PayPal and Stripe are among the fintech\ngiants making inroads into stablecoins, with Stripe co-founder John Collison\nin April citing \u201ctechnical improvements\u201d for being bullish on the tokens.\n\n\u201cIt says that stablecoins are still in a very nascent moment in their\nevolution as a payment instrument,\u201d Pranav Sood, executive general manager for\nEmea at payments platform Airwallex, said of the data. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that\nthey don\u2019t have long-term potential, because I think they do. But the short-\nterm and the mid-term focus needs to be on making sure that existing rails\nwork much better.\u201d\n\nTracking the \u201creal\u201d value of crypto activity using blockchain data has always\nbeen a challenge. Data provider Glassnode has estimated that the record US$3\ntrillion of total market circulation assigned to digital tokens at the peak of\nthe 2021 bull market was actually closer to US$875 billion.\n\nWith stablecoins, transactions can often be double-counted depending on the\nplatform users are transferring funds to. For example, converting US$100 of\nCircle Internet Financial\u2019s USDC to PayPal\u2019s PYUSD on the decentralised\nexchange Uniswap would result in US$200 of total stablecoin volume being\nrecorded on-chain, said Cuy Sheffield, Visa\u2019s head of crypto.\n\n##### SEE ALSO\n\nStablecoin Tether steps up monitoring in bid to combat illicit finance\n\n##### GET BT IN YOUR INBOX DAILY\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered\nstraight to your inbox.\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nVisa itself, which handled more than US$12 trillion worth of transactions last\nyear, is among companies that could stand to lose out should stablecoins\nbecome a generally accepted means of payment.\n\nThe total value of all stablecoins in circulation could reach US$2.8 trillion\nby 2028, analysts at Bernstein predicted last year. That would be an almost\n18-fold increase from their combined circulation now. Because transactions\nusing such tokens are instantaneous and almost without cost, many in the\ncrypto industry argue that they are perfectly suited for disrupting the\npayments sector.\n\nPayPal launched its PYUSD stablecoin last year, seeking a solution for instant\nand lower-cost transfers within its wider payment infrastructure. Stripe said\non Apr 25 that it\u2019s allowing merchants using its platform to accept\nstablecoins for online transactions.\n\nEven so, Airwallex has seen tepid demand from its customers for stablecoin-\nbased payments solutions as many still do not regard the technology as user-\nfriendly enough, according to Sood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really significant barrier to overcome,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to\nremember that in the US, people are still using checks to pay for somewhere\nbetween 40 per cent and 60 per cent of business payments, which gives you a\nsense of where the market really is in terms of technological adoption.\u201d\nBLOOMBERG\n\nAlready a subscriber?
