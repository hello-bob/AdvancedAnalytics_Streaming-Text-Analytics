This is partly due to the spread of cheap and extremely potent\nsynthetic cannabinoids that can cause serious neurological and cardiovascular\ncomplications\u2014and deaths\u2014every year. While an opioid overdose can be reversed\nby naloxone, there is no analogous treatment for cannabis toxicity. Without an\nantidote, doctors rely on sedatives, with their own risks, or \u2018waiting it out\u2019\nto treat these patients. We have shown that the canonical synthetic \u2018designer\u2019\ncannabinoids are highly potent CB1 receptor agonists and, as a result,\ncompetitive antagonists may struggle to rapidly reverse an overdose due to\nsynthetic cannabinoids. Negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) have the\npotential to attenuate the effects of synthetic cannabinoids without having to\ndirectly compete for binding. We tested a group of CB1 NAMs for their ability\nto reverse the effects of the canonical synthetic designer cannabinoid JWH018\nin vitro in a neuronal model of endogenous cannabinoid signaling and also in\nvivo. We tested ABD1085, RTICBM189, and PSNCBAM1 in autaptic hippocampal\nneurons that endogenously express a retrograde CB1-dependent circuit that\ninhibits neurotransmission. We found that all of these compounds\nblocked/reversed JWH018, though some proved more potent than others. We then\ntested whether these compounds could block the effects of JWH018 in vivo,\nusing a test of nociception in mice. We found that only two of these\ncompounds\u2014RTICBM189 and PSNCBAM1\u2014blocked JWH018 when applied in advance. The\nin vitro potency of a compound did not predict its in vivo potency. PSNCBAM1\nproved to be the more potent of the compounds and also reversed the effects of\nJWH018 when applied afterward, a condition that more closely mimics an\noverdose situation. Lastly, we found that PSNCBAM1 did not elicit withdrawal\nafter chronic JWH018 treatment. In summary, CB1 NAMs can, in principle,\nreverse the effects of the canonical synthetic designer cannabinoid JWH018\nboth in vitro and in vivo, without inducing withdrawal. These findings suggest\na novel pharmacological approach to at last provide a tool to counter\ncannabinoid toxicity.\n\nKeywords:\n\ncannabinoid toxicity; antidote; synthetic cannabinoid; overdose; JWH018\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nWhile the opioid crisis has understandably occupied news headlines, emergency\nrooms have been seeing a ramp-up in visits due to another cause: cannabinoid\noverdose. This is partly due to the spread of cheap and extremely potent\nsynthetic cannabinoids (SCs) that have resulted in many thousands of ER\nvisits, serious neurological and cardiovascular complications, and roughly a\ndozen deaths per year [1]. For opioid overdose, there is naloxone, but no such\ntool is available for medical personnel confronting many thousands of cases of\ncannabinoid-related emergency department visits each year (reviewed in [2]).\n\nThough not as widespread as cannabis, the more powerful designer SCs represent\na more serious threat to individual health. Their availability and use have\nexpanded rapidly, peaking in 2015, but they have persisted despite predictions\nthat demand would wither with the legalization of cannabis. One attraction of\nthese compounds is that they are likely to be missed by employer drug screens\nthat may be enforced even in states that have legalized cannabis. For many\nyears, SCs were synthesized based on the scaffold of JWH018, a potent analogue\nof THC, the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (reviewed in [3]). We\ncharacterized the neuropharmacology of JWH018 and several related compounds\nshortly after their appearance and showed that these compounds are higher-\nefficacy CB1 receptor agonists than THC [4,5]. Because SCs are more potent and\nefficacious than THC, their users often present to emergency rooms with\ntachycardia, vomiting, heart and kidney damage, seizures, and even deaths\n[1,6,7,8,9,10,11]. Synthetic cannabinoids initially benefitted from a legally\nambiguous status; because they are chemically distinct from the psychoactive\ncannabinoid THC, they were not explicitly scheduled. For several years, these\ncompounds were freely available, marketed as \u2018legal weed\u2019, and experienced an\nexplosive growth in use. In response to the scheduling of first-generation\nSCs, drug developers rapidly developed third- and fourth-generation SCs that\nare structurally distinct and, thus, technically escape scheduling [3]. Though\nevidence suggests that these compounds have been selected for their activity\nat CB1 receptors, this may be changing [3].\n\nWhy is there no treatment for cannabis/cannabinoid overdose? There are no FDA-\napproved antagonists\u2014no naloxone-equivalent\u2014for CB1 receptors. One CB1\nantagonist (rimonabant/Accomplia) was briefly approved in Europe for weight\nloss, but was withdrawn because long-term daily use was linked to dysphoric\nside effects (reviewed in [12]). Several pharmaceutical companies had active\ndrug development programs with similar goals, but these were shut down when\nrimonabant was withdrawn. The drug industry has been reluctant to pursue\nfurther work with CB1 antagonists, even though a single acute treatment in an\nemergency setting represents a very different, and temporally constrained,\ntherapeutic intervention. Clinical trials are under way for a signaling\npathway-selective antagonist for cannabis use disorder [13], but this drug is\nintended for medium-term oral use rather than acute treatment in an emergency\nsetting.\n\nThe promise of negative allosteric modulators: Because the newer synthetic\ncannabinoids are highly potent and efficacious agonists, there is a risk that\na conventional competitive antagonist will be unable to rapidly reverse their\neffects due to their slow unbinding from CB1 receptors. This has proven to be\nan issue for the competitive mu opioid receptor antagonist naloxone in\nantagonizing synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and, especially, carfentanyl\n[14]. Competitive antagonists also bring the risk of inducing withdrawal,\nwhich may limit their acceptance. As depicted schematically in Figure 1,\nallosteric modulators act at a separate site and, thus, do not directly\ncompete with a high-affinity orthosteric ligand. Allosteric modulators include\nseveral important classes of drugs, including benzodiazepines and barbiturates\n(at GABA_A), and can act via several mechanisms, including changing the\nkinetics of orthosteric ligand binding [15]. Therefore, our hypothesis was\nthat CB1 NAMs may be a preferred strategy to reverse cannabinoid toxicity,\nparticularly in the face of an overdose, due to high-affinity synthetic\ncannabinoids. Here, we tested a group of promising CB1 NAMs both in vitro and\nin vivo for their ability to reverse the effects of JWH018.\n\nFigure 1. Negative allosteric modulators of CB1 receptors and their potential\nto reverse acute synthetic designer cannabinoid-mediated toxicity. (A)\nCompetitive antagonists compete directly at the orthosteric site. (B) Powerful\nsynthetic \u201cspice-class\u201d cannabinoids may bind tightly to the orthosteric site\nand strongly activate the receptor. This tight binding may prevent a\ncompetitive antagonist from reversing the effect (indicated by red cross). (C)\nA negative allosteric modulator targets a secondary \u2018allosteric\u2019 site,\nreducing the activity of the receptor (red crosses) without directly competing\nat the orthosteric site.\n\nWe selected JWH-018 as the reference compound, since it was the original SC\ndescribed in early preparations such as Spice and K2 and the structural well-\nspring for many subsequent SCs (Figure 2). The first research on SC \u2018herbal\nblends\u2019 in the club scene appeared in 2009 [16]. Producers of SCs busied\nthemselves with selecting or designing other compounds, in large part in an\neffort to stay a step ahead of regulators and thereby continue the public sale\nof this class of compounds. However, there is a common structure to most of\nthe synthetic cannabinoids that have been appropriated for SCs: a core\nheteroaromatic structure such as an indole ring (as in JWH018), a \u2018head\u2019 group\nconsisting of a secondary structure (a naphthyl in JWH018) joining the core\nthrough a \u2018bridge\u2019 (carbonyl/methanone in JWH018), and a aliphatic/aromatic\n\u2018tail\u2019 at the N1 position of the core structure (a pentyl in JWH018).\n\nFigure 2. Structure of JWH-018 progenitor synthetic designer cannabinoid.\n\n## 2\\. Results\n\n#### 2.1. The Choice of CB1 NAMs and Synthetic Cannabinoid\n\nAs stated in the introduction, our objective was to test whether CB1 NAMs are\nable to reverse the effects of the potent high-affinity synthetic cannabinoid\nJWH018 in vitro or in vivo. To our knowledge, this has not previously been\ninvestigated. We have previously tested most of the first- and second-\ngeneration CB1 NAMs [17,18] and several CB1 antagonists in our neuronal model\nsystem and were, therefore, well-positioned to test these vs. synthetic\nagonists. In a previous test of a panel of CB1 NAMs [19], PSNCBAM1 was the\nclear standout and is included in this study. We also have evidence that the\nsecond-generation NAM ABD1085 ([20] an indole sulfonamide variant of ORG27569\nwith good oral potency) is effective in vivo [21] and included it for testing\nhere. We additionally tested an arylurea-based NAM RTICBM189 [22]. We did not\ntest pregnenolone or PEPCAN12 because we had found them to be either inactive\nor only slightly active in our model [17]. As noted in the introduction, these\ncompounds were tested against the canonical synthetic designer cannabinoid\nJWH018.\n\n#### 2.2. CB1 Negative Allosteric Modulators Can Reverse JWH018 Effects on\nCannabinoid Signaling in Autaptic Neurons\n\nJWH018 decreases EPSC size in autaptic neurons. Antagonizing CB1 receptor\nactivation would be expected to prevent this reduction in EPSC size and has\nbeen demonstrated in this model using negative allosteric modulators [17]. We\ntreated neurons with JWH018 at 40 nM, a concentration that yielded a strong,\nbut submaximal, inhibition of EPSCs in this model and measured the inhibition\nof EPSCs. We then added increasing concentrations of PSNCBAM1 to neurons\ntreated with JWH018 to test whether the putative NAM could reverse the effects\nof JWH018. This is a requirement for a therapeutically useful compound in an\nemergency setting. We found that while PSNCBAM1 fully blocked DSE at 1 \u03bcM\n[19], it was unable to reverse the effects of JWH018 even at 2 \u03bcM, but was\neffective at 10 \u03bcM (Figure 3, relative EPSC charge after JWH018 \u00b1 SEM: 0.56 \u00b1\n0.07; after PSNCBAM1 (10 \u03bcM): 0.85 \u00b1 0.05; n = 6; *, p < 0.05 one-way ANOVA\nwith Dunnett\u2019s posthoc test vs. JWH018). Thus, higher concentrations of\nPSNCBAM1 are needed to reverse the same extent of EPSC inhibition by JWH018,\nhighlighting the possible probe dependence of PSNCBAM1, favoring the\nantagonism of 2-AG signaling.\n\nFigure 3. A high concentration of PSNCBAM1 reverses JWH018 inhibition of\nneurotransmission. (A) Sample time showing inhibitory effect of JWH018 (40 nM)\nand partial reversal by PSNCBAM1. (B) Summary bar graph shows a partial\nreversal of JWH018 (40 nM) effect on EPSCs (circles) by PSNCBAM1 at 10 \u03bcM\n(triangles), but not 2 \u03bcM (squares). ns, not significant; *, p < 0.05, by one-\nway ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s post hoc vs. JWH018.\n\nWe also tested ABD1085 [20], a candidate NAM that we have found effective in\naltering ocular pressure [21]. We had not previously tested this compound in\nthe autaptic model and, thus, first tested the extent to which this compound\nmight prevent DSE. We initially tested whether the compound had direct effects\non neurotransmission by monitoring excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs)\nbefore and after treatment with the compound. We found that a five-minute\ntreatment with 1 \u03bcM ABD1085 did not alter EPSCs (Figure 4A; relative EPSC\ncharge \u00b1 SEM: 0.99 \u00b1 0.01, n = 5). We then elicited baseline DSE, followed by\n5 min of treatment with ABD1085 followed by a second DSE in the presence of\nthe drug, finding that 1 \u03bcM ABD1085 was able to diminish DSE in these neurons\n(Figure 4B,C). This concentration of ABD1085 was also able to reverse the\neffect of JWH018 (Figure 4D,E; relative EPSC charge after JWH018 \u00b1 SEM: 0.46 \u00b1\n0.02; after ABD1085 (1 \u03bcM): 0.97 \u00b1 0.03; n = 5; *, p < 0.01 paired t-test vs.\nJWH018).\n\nFigure 4.

RTICBM189 has been shown to attenuate the\nreinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior in a CB1-dependent manner [22]. We\ntested RTICBM189 for direct effects on neurotransmission and for its ability\nto reverse DSE in the autaptic model, finding that while RTICBM189 does not\nalter EPSCs on its own (Figure 5A, relative EPSC charge \u00b1 SEM: 1.05 \u00b1 0.08, n\n= 5), it does reverse DSE at 1 \u03bcM (Figure 5B,C). RTICBM189 is also able to\nreverse the effect of JWH018 at this concentration (Figure 5D,E, relative EPSC\ncharge after JWH018 (40 nM) \u00b1 SEM: 0.44 \u00b1 0.05; after JWH018 + RTICBM189 (1\n\u03bcM): 0.99 \u00b1 0.06, n = 5, p = 0.006 by paired t-test).\n\nFigure 5. RTICBM189 inhibits DSE and reverses JWH018 effects on\nneurotransmission in autaptic neurons. (A) Negative allosteric modulator\nRTICBM189 has no effect on EPSCs at 1 \u03bcM.

(D) Sample time course\nshows a full reversal of JWH018 (40 nM) effect on EPSCs by RTICBM189 (1 \u03bcM).\n(E) Summary graph shows EPSC inhibition by JWH018 (circles) and reversal by\nRTICBM189 (1 \u03bcM, squares). ns, not significant; **, 0 < 0.01 one-way ANOVA\nwith Dunnett\u2019s post hoc test (B), by paired t-test (D).\n\nFrom these experiments, we conclude that it is possible for a CB1 NAM to\nreverse the effects of JWH018 in a neuronal model of CB1 signaling.\n\n#### 2.3. CB1 NAMs Block Antinociception by JWH018 in a Mouse Model of\nNociception\n\nWhile it is encouraging that these compounds reverse JWH018 in vitro,\nultimately, the key question is whether a CB1 NAM works in vivo. We tested\nwhether the candidate NAMs reversed CB1-mediated JWH018 antinociception, since\nantinociception is among the best-studied cannabinoid effects. JWH018\nantinociception can also be readily blocked or reversed, offering a real-time\nin vivo assay on the degree and time course of reversal of agonist effects. We\nused the tail flick assay, as it has previously been shown to be CB1-mediated\n[23,24]. We first obtained a dose\u2013response curve for JWH018-induced\nantinociception by testing a range of concentrations (0.03\u20133 mg/kg). This\nallowed us to determine a dose (0.5 mg/kg) that results in a clear, submaximal\neffect (Figure 6A) that we then used in subsequent experiments. Candidate NAMs\nwere first tested for their ability to block the effect of JWH018 when pre-\ninjected (IP) 30 min before JWH018. Interestingly, while all compounds had\nproven effective in vitro, only two of the three blocked the effect of JWH018\nin vivo. ABD1085 had been one of the more potent compounds tested in vitro,\nbut did not affect antinociception produced by JWH018 (Figure 6B). RTICBM189\nblocked the effect of JWH018 at 10 mg/kg (Figure 6C). PSNCBAM1 proved to be\nthe most potent compound, reducing the effects of JWH018 even at 4 mg/kg,\nthough not at 1 mg/kg (Figure 6D). Proceeding with PSNCBAM1, we tested whether\nthe co-application of 10 mg/kg with JWH018 might also block the effects of the\ncannabinoid, finding that it did (Figure 6E). Lastly, we tested whether\nPSNCBAM1 could reverse established JWH018 antinociception, applying it 45 min\nafter JWH018, finding that it rapidly reversed JWH018 antinociception, with\nclear effects as early as 15 min post-injection (Figure 6F).\n\nFigure 6. CB1 NAMs vs. JWH018 effects on nociception. (A) Dose response for\nJWH018 in tail flick assay. (B) Time course shows that pretreatment with\nRTICBM189 at 10 mg/kg blocks the effect of JWH018 (0.5 mg/kg). (C) ABD1085 is\nineffective at 10 mg/kg. (D) Pretreatment with PSNCBAM1 blocks effect of\nJWH018 at 4 and 10 mg/kg. (E) PSNCBAM1 (10 mg/kg) is still effective when co-\ntreated with JWH018 (0.5 mg/kg). (F) PSNCBAM1 (10 mg/kg) rapidly reverses the\neffect of JWH018 when applied 45 min after JWH018. *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01,\n***, p < 0.005, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test.\n\n#### 2.4. PSNCBAM1 Does Not Induce Withdrawal\n\nOne limitation of conventional orthosteric antagonists is their precipitation\nof withdrawal in dependent individuals. This is particularly problematic in\nthe case of opioids, where the sudden reversal of receptor activation induces\npowerfully aversive effects that can lead to aggressive, even violent,\nresponses in victims who were at death\u2019s door moments before. Negative\nallosteric modulators offer the promise of avoiding withdrawal because they\nmodulate the activation of the receptor. We, therefore, tested whether\nPSNCBAM1 would induce withdrawal after 7 days of daily treatment with JWH018\n(0.5 mg/kg, IP). PSNCBAM1 was administered (10 mg/kg, IP) 45 min after the\nfinal JWH018 treatment. Animals were monitored before and after PSNCBAM1\ntreatment for behaviors associated with cannabinoid withdrawal (e.g., head\nshakes and paw tremors). We found that PSNCBAM1 (10 mg/kg, IP) did not induce\nwithdrawal, but the CB1 antagonist SR141716 (4 mg/kg, IP) applied afterward in\na subset of animals did (Figure 7, withdrawal behaviors after treatment with\nJWH018 only (\u00b1SEM): 0.62 \u00b1 0.26, n = 8; PSNCBAM1: 1.62 \u00b1 0.86; n = 8;\nSR141716: 11.0 \u00b1 3.6, n = 4; p < 0.005 for SR141716 vs. JWH018 via one-way\nANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s post hoc test).\n\nFigure 7. PSNCBAM1 does not induce withdrawal in JWH018-treated mice. Mice\ntreated for 7 days with daily JWH018 injections (0.5 mg/kg) did not see\nwithdrawal symptoms 45 min after treatment with PSNCBAM1 (10 mg/kg). A subset\nof mice subsequently treated with the competitive antagonist SR141716 showed\nan increase in withdrawal symptoms. ***, p < 0.005, one-way ANOVA with\nDunnett\u2019s post hoc test vs. JWH018.\n\n## 3\\. Discussion\n\nWith tens of thousands of ER visits a year linked to cannabinoid overdose,\nthere is a clear need for an antidote available to first responders [25]. An\nantidote against opioid overdose has served admirably in this role for more\nthan 50 years, yet nothing is available for cannabinoid overdose. In\nprinciple, a competitive CB1 antagonist could serve this role; however, it may\nnot be efficacious in an overdose of a high-affinity synthetic cannabinoid. An\nintriguing, novel approach to antagonizing CB1 signaling in an overdose\nsetting would be to use a CB1 negative allosteric modulator. As a non-\ncompetitive agent, such a compound might prove to be versatile and effective\nagainst compounds regardless of their affinity at the orthosteric site. The\ncurrent project was initiated to explore whether CB1 NAMs could effectively\nreverse the effects of an SC in vitro using a neuronal model of endogenous\ncannabinoid signaling and, if so, to learn whether such a compound might be\neffective in vivo. Our chief findings are that all CB1 NAMs tested were able\nto block and reverse the effects of JWH018 in autaptic neurons, though the\npotency varied considerably. Of the three compounds that were effective in\nvitro, only two were able to prevent the effect of JWH018 when given in\nadvance. Only one of these\u2014PSNCBAM1\u2014was effective at less than 10 mg/kg.\nImportantly, PSNCBAM1 was also able to reverse the effects of JWH018 when\ngiven after JWH018, mimicking an emergency situation. Importantly, PSNCBAM1\ndid not induce withdrawal in mice chronically treated with JWH018. Taken\ntogether, our findings suggest that a CB1 NAM can, in principle, serve as an\nantidote to cannabinoid overdose/toxicity in an emergency setting.\n\nThe successful use of an antidote in an emergency setting comes with some\nspecific requirements. First, the compound must be effective even against a\nhigh-affinity compound. Our tests against the canonical SC JWH018 suggest that\na CB1 NAM can work against a high-affinity agonist in vivo. Second, the\nantidote must be fast-acting, preferably in minutes. Here, we saw evidence for\nan effect within 15 min after IP injection, and it is possible that the\ncompound acts more rapidly. Most CB1 NAMs described so far have lipophilic\nstructures and, thus, are expected to readily penetrate the blood\u2013brain\nbarrier. However, this may be affected by the route of administration, and\nthis is the third major requirement: the method of administration must be\nsuited to an emergency setting. SCs have been associated with psychotic\nepisodes, meaning that treatment may not be voluntary. In emergency situations\noutside of a hospital, intranasal and intramuscular (IM) modes of treatment\nare the most likely methods of administration, but for an uncooperative\npatient, IM injection may be the only suitable approach. Lipophilic compounds\napplied intramuscularly may have longer loitering times, since they readily\nabsorb into local membranes. The presence of adipose tissue may also serve as\na local sink for injected compounds. The question of how rapidly a compound\nsuch as PSNCBAM1 works will require pharmacokinetic studies in human subjects.\n\nOne interesting aspect of our findings was that the potency of drugs in the\nautaptic model was not a predictor of the effectiveness of a compound in vivo.\nIndeed, the least potent compound in terms of reversing the effects of JWH018\nin autaptic neurons proved most potent in vivo. It is possible that CB1\nantinociceptive effects are less dependent on the signaling pathways that\nunderlie the inhibition of calcium channels in neurons that form the basis of\nDSE [26]; however, the difference may have resulted from the pharmacokinetic\nproperties of these different CB1 NAMs, such as their ability to pass across\nthe blood\u2013brain barrier. While ABD1085, an indole derivative containing a\nsulfonamide group, was shown to be brain-penetrant in in vitro permeability\nand in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, it has a T_max of 4 h when orally dosed,\ni.e., it does not reach maximum concentration until 4 h after administration\n[20]. In contrast, RTICBM189, an arylurea-based CB1 NAM, has a T_max of 0.4 h\nwhen IP administered [22]. This may explain why RTICBM189 was active against\nJWH018 with 30 min pre-administration, while ABD1085 had no effect. To the\nbest of our knowledge, PSNCBAM1 has not been tested for its in vivo\npharmacokinetic properties. The fact the PSNCBAM1 was active against JWH018\nduring 30 min pre-treatment, co-administration, and 45 min after JWH018\ninjection in the tail flick assay suggests that it may have more rapid brain\npenetration, although this will need to be experimentally confirmed.\n\nThis also raises another important consideration: what is a CB1 antidote\nreversing? For an opioid antagonist, the picture is clear, since deaths\nassociated with opioid overdose follow severe respiratory depression. A\nsuccessful opioid antidote should, therefore, at a minimum, reverse\nrespiratory depression. But in the case of CB1 overdose, the situation is less\nclear. First, the great majority of hospital visits are due to cannabis\ntoxicity rather than overdose from synthetic cannabinoids. The symptom\nprofiles for these are different, though it is likely that both are largely\ndue to CB1 activation. According to a recent study of children admitted to\nemergency rooms, the most common symptoms were slowed breathing and reduced\nheart rates [25].\n\nIndividuals experiencing cannabinoid overdose frequently experience agitation,\nanxiety, and vertigo, but may report a wide range of symptoms. The effects may\nalso vary depending on the route of entry (i.e., inhaled vs. ingested),\nadulterants that may be present, and also may depend on individual\nsensitivity. There is evidence that populations with cardiovascular conditions\nmay be vulnerable to the effects of cannabinoids (e.g., [27]). The\ncardiovascular effects likely tie into some of the symptoms being seen with\nsynthetic cannabinoid overdoses, such as tachycardia. While we have convincing\nanimal data demonstrating the in vivo effect of PSNCBAM1, the current study is\nlimited to only its anti-nociceptive effect, and it is possible that the same\ncompound is less effective for other physiological consequences of cannabinoid\ntoxicity. Thus, future studies should determine the efficacy of PSNCBAM1 to\nreverse other preclinical signs of JWH018-mediated CB1 activation such as\nhypothermia, catatonia, etc.\n\nA second challenge in developing an antidote to synthetic cannabinoids has to\ndo with the nature of these synthetic cannabinoids. For cannabis toxicity, the\nchief concern is THC, mainly acting at CB1 receptors in the CNS. Over the last\ndozen years, it was safe to assume that CB1 was the chief target of synthetic\ncannabinoids, but there are signs that this may be changing. Because\ngovernment regulations tended to be reactive, targeting specific compounds\nonce they appeared on the drug scene, producers focused on \u2018tweaking\u2019 the\noriginal compound to develop new drugs that would evade restrictions while\npreserving the desired CB1 agonist profile. More than 200 synthetic\ncannabinoids have appeared over the last 15 years. However, the Chinese\ngovernment\u2014and there is evidence that the bulk of these compounds are produced\nin China\u2014has enacted legislation targeting the scaffold itself, with the\nconsequence of a shift to different scaffolds (reviewed in [3]), a strategy\nknown as scaffold-hopping. There is a risk that these will have a much\ndifferent pharmacological profile (i.e., they may engage other CNS receptors\nin addition to CB1), though it seems likely that the compounds will still have\nstrong CB1 agonist properties. While previous compounds reliably served as\nstrong, relatively selective CB1 agonists and, thus, motivated the development\nof a CB1 antidote, the current study only examined JWH018, and this may not\nhold for future classes of SCs.\n\nOur finding that, in contrast to the competitive CB1 antagonist SR141716A,\nPSNCBAM1 did not induce withdrawal may have broad implications for the\ntherapeutic application of CB1 NAMs. Given the sheer numbers of opioid-related\noverdoses and fifty years of experience with naloxone, there is considerable\nexperience with opioid withdrawal in an emergency setting. Opioid withdrawal\nis deeply aversive and there are countless reports of aggression and even\nviolence against first responders during precipitated opioid withdrawal. For\ncannabinoid toxicity, to our knowledge, this has not been investigated in\nhumans, since no CB1 antagonist has been available for this purpose. There is\nevidence for a spontaneous cannabis withdrawal syndrome with symptoms such as\nanxiety and irritability [28]. However, precipitated withdrawal in preclinical\nmodels of cannabinoid dependence is accompanied by strong signs, reminiscent\nof opioid withdrawal in similar models. Thus, if a compound serves as an\nantidote to cannabinoid toxicity without inducing withdrawal symptoms, this\nwould presumably be advantageous over one that does. On a related point, it is\npossible that a CB1 NAM would not cause the dysphoric effects that led to the\nwithdrawal of rimonabant (SR141716A) (reviewed in [12]). Those effects were\npresumably due to the action of rimonabant as an inverse agonist at CB1 and,\nthus, are unlikely to be mimicked by a CB1 NAM. In any event, a single use in\nan emergency setting may allow for some more flexibility in terms of the side\neffect profile.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of emergency room visits related to cannabinoid\ntoxicity each year, the need for an antidote is compelling, but the rimonabant\nexperience has long chastened pharmaceutical companies from working in this\nspace. To fill this void, we have tested a panel of CB1 negative allosteric\nmodulators for their ability to reverse the effects of a canonical designer\nsynthetic cannabinoid, JWH018. We found that all CB1 NAMs were able to reverse\nthe effects in vitro, and that two of the compounds acted similarly in vivo.\nOne of these, PSNCBAM1, was additionally tested and found to reverse JWH018\neffects and was found to act without inducing withdrawal in a mouse model. Our\nfindings serve as proof-of-concept that a CB1 NAM could serve as an antidote\nfor cannabinoid toxicity, though additional studies will be required to\nfurther assess the suitability of this strategy.\n\n## 4\\. Materials and Methods\n\n#### 4.1. Animals\n\nAdult male wild-type mice with a C57BL/6J background were purchased from The\nJackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and used in behavioral studies.\nFemales were not included for this testing because it represents the first\nstep and a proof-of-concept study of whether CB1 NAMs can, in principle,\nimpact JWH018 responses in vitro and in vivo. Future studies to develop\ncompounds as antidotes for cannabinoid toxicity will test both males and\nfemales. For neuronal culture, mouse pups (age postnatal day 0\u20132,\nindeterminate sex) were used. Seventy-two mice were used for this study. All\nmice were ~12\u201320 weeks old when used in this study. All mice were maintained\non a 12 h reverse light/dark cycle (lights off from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) in a\ntemperature- and humidity-controlled facility and allowed ad libitum access to\nfood and water throughout the experimental period. All experiments were\napproved by the Indiana University Bloomington Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n#### 4.2. Hippocampal Culture Preparation\n\nMouse hippocampal neurons isolated from the CA1\u2013CA3 region were cultured on\nmicroislands as described previously [29,30]. Neurons were obtained from\nanimals (age postnatal day 0\u20132) and plated onto a feeder layer of hippocampal\nastrocytes that had been laid down previously [31]. Cultures were grown in\nhigh-glucose (20 mM) DMEM containing 10% horse serum, without mitotic\ninhibitors, and used for recordings after 8 days in culture and for no more\nthan 3 h after removal from the culture medium.\n\n#### 4.3. Electrophysiology\n\nWhen a single neuron is grown on a small island of permissive substrate, it\nforms synapses or \u2018autapses\u2019 onto itself. All experiments were performed on\nisolated autaptic neurons. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from autaptic\nneurons were carried out at room temperature using an Axopatch 200 A amplifier\n(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The extracellular solution contained\n(in mM) 119 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl_2, 1.5 MgCl_2, 30 glucose, and 20 HEPES. The\ncontinuous flow of solution through the bath chamber (~2 mL/min) ensured rapid\ndrug application and clearance. The drugs were typically prepared as stocks,\nand then diluted into extracellular solution at their final concentration and\nused on the same day.\n\nRecording pipettes of 1.8\u20133 M\u03a9 were filled with (in mM) 121.5 KGluconate, 17.5\nKCl, 9 NaCl, 1 MgCl_2, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 MgATP, and 0.5 LiGTP. Access\nresistance and holding current were monitored and only cells with both stable\naccess resistance and holding current were included for data analysis. The\nconventional stimulus protocol was as follows: the membrane potential was held\nat \u221270 mV and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked every 20 s\nby triggering an unclamped action current with a 1.0 ms depolarizing step. The\nresultant evoked waveform consisted of a brief stimulus artifact and a large\ndownward spike representing inward sodium currents, followed by the slower\nEPSC. The size of the recorded EPSCs was calculated by integrating the evoked\ncurrent to yield a charge value (in pC). Calculating the charge value in this\nmanner yields an indirect measure of the amount of neurotransmitter released\nwhile minimizing the effects of cable distortion on currents generated far\nfrom the site of the recording electrode (the soma). Data were acquired at a\nsampling rate of 5 kHz.\n\nDSE stimuli: After establishing a 10\u201320 s 0.5 Hz baseline, DSE was evoked by\ndepolarizing to 0 mV for 3 or 10 s, followed by the resumption of a 0.5 Hz\nstimulus protocol for 20\u201380 s, allowing EPSCs to recover to baseline values.\nTo allow comparison, baseline values (prior to the DSE stimulus) were\nnormalized to one. DSE inhibition values are presented as fractions of 1,\ni.e., a 50% inhibition from the baseline response is 0.50 \u00b1 standard error of\nthe mean.\n\n#### 4.4. Tail Flick Assay\n\nTo assess the latency of an evasive response to a nocifensive stimulus that is\nsensitive to cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation [23], we used the tail flick\nassay. Mice were gently handled by the experimenter several days before the\ntesting. Prior to the experiment, mice were introduced to the environment for\n30 min for adaptation. At the outset of the experiment, three separate\nbaseline values were recorded (with a 10 min interval between each). A cut-off\nof 15 s was applied to avoid tissue damage. If a mouse did not exhibit a\nnocifensive response by the cut-off time, the test was terminated, a latency\nof 15 s was recorded, and the mouse was defined as analgesic.\n\nTo determine a dose response for JWH018 in this model, na\u00efve mice were exposed\nto an acute dose of JWH018 (0.03\u20133 mg/kg; i.p.) and subsequently tested for\nlatencies every 15 min over 75 min post-injection. Based on the dose response,\nwe chose 0.5 mg/kg JWH018 for subsequent experiments.\n\nCandidate CB1 NAMs were tested for their ability to mitigate JWH018-induced\nantinociception. Compounds were initially tested at 10 mg/kg (i.p.)\nadministered 30 min before JWH018. Following this preliminary assessment,\nPSNCBAM1 was selected for further testing. This involved the co-application of\nPSNCBAM1 and JWH018 and the monitoring of nociceptive responses as above.\nAdditionally, in a separate experiment, PSNCBAM1 was administered 45 min after\nJWH018 to determine whether it would antagonize antinociception with JWH018.\n\n#### 4.5. Withdrawal Behavior\n\nMice were injected daily with JWH018 (0.5 mg/kg, IP) for one week. Forty-five\nminutes after the seventh injection, mice were treated with PSCNBAM1 (10\nmg/kg, IP). Mice were monitored for 15 min after the last JWH018 treatment\nstarting 15 min after the injection and again 15 min after PSNCBAM1\ninjections. Head shakes and paw tremors were counted. A subset of mice\nadditionally received an injection with SR141716 (4 mg/kg, IP) 45 min after\ntheir PSNCBAM1 injections and were monitored as above for evidence of\nwithdrawal behaviors.\n\n#### 4.6. Drugs\n\nJWH018 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). ABD1085 was\nprovided by Dr. Iain Greig. RTICBM189 was provided by Dr. Yanan Zhang.\nPSNCBAM1 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). For\nelectrophysiology experiments, drugs were prepared as a stock at a high\nconcentration (typically 10 mM) in DMSO or ethanol, then diluted shortly\nbefore a given experiment. Solvent concentrations did not exceed 0.1%. For in\nvivo experiments, drugs were prepared for intraperitoneal injection in an\nethanol/kolliphor/saline mixture (1:1:18). In the case of JWH018, which was\nreceived from the manufacturer in methanol, the methanol was evaporated away\nshortly before the experiment and resuspended in ethanol, then added to the\nkolliphor/saline mixture as above.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, A.S.; formal analysis, A.S., P.A., K.Y. and N.M.;\ninvestigation, A.F., P.A., K.Y., N.M. and A.S.; resources, K.M., Y.Z., I.G.,\nR.R., W.D. and T.N.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.S.; writing\u2014review\nand editing, A.S, Y.Z., I.G., R.R., K.M. and T.N.; project administration,\nA.S.
