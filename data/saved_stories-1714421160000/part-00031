What we\u2019re gearing up for is a\ndecidedly solar one\u2014our star is nearing the peak of its magnetic activity\ncycle, which means more sunspots, more storms and, potentially, more danger to\nEarth.\n\nThe sun\u2019s magnetic field is generated in its interior, where conditions are so\nhot that electrons are stripped from their host atoms, forming an ionized gas.\nA basic law of physics states that moving electric charges generate a magnetic\nfield, and it\u2019s this ionized-gas-induced magnetism that so profoundly affects\nthe sun\u2019s behavior.\n\nUnlike Earth, which has a fairly strong and well-organized magnetic field\nsimilar to that of a single gigantic bar magnet, the sun is dominated by\ncountless locally generated fields. Each one shapes its own parcel of the\nsolar interior. The actual dynamics of this magnetism are fiercely complex,\nbut to simplify, you can think of our star\u2019s overall magnetic field strength\nas waxing and waning over a period of about 11 years\u2014what we call the solar\nmagnetic cycle.\n\nHot material inside the sun rises to the surface and, once cooled, sinks again\nin a process called thermal convection, in a very similar way to water in a\nboiling teakettle. It\u2019s like a conveyor belt for stellar energy and is part of\nthe process by which much of the hellish heat from the solar interior makes\nits way out of the sun and into space to bring life-sustaining warmth to our\nplanet. The sun\u2019s face is festooned with millions of these ever-changing\nconvection cells; each is accompanied by its own internal magnetic field.\n\nNear the sun\u2019s surface, the magnetic field lines emanating from a given\ntowering convection cell can get tangled up with those from others. These\ntangles can act as a barrier that prevents cooler material from sinking back\ndown. Instead it just sits there on the surface, radiating away its energy.\nCooler material is darker, so we see these areas as spots on the sun, which we\ncleverly call sunspots. Their numbers increase dramatically during a solar\nmaximum.\n\nWe say these regions are cooler, but they\u2019re still fiendishly hot by earthly\nstandards. In isolation they\u2019d be about as bright as the full moon; they just\nlook dark by comparison against the sun\u2019s surface. Most spots are a few\nthousand kilometers across, but some grow huge, larger than Earth. The biggest\ncan be immense, several times wider than our planet and visible to the\nproperly protected unaided eye. (The eclipse glasses you may still have\nsitting around would suffice.)\n\nWhen these localized magnetic fields breach the sun\u2019s surface, they can raise\nhuge loops of magnetic force, drawing material up with them to create\nincredibly tall glowing spires called prominences. Some can be tens of\nthousands of kilometers high, and all are tinted red by the glow of hot\nhydrogen. Several were visible during April\u2019s eclipse, stretching out in the\nsky past the moon\u2019s star-occulting shadow.\n\n## Curated by Our Editors\n\n  * ### The Sun's Magnetic Poles Are Vanishing\n\nMeghan Bartels\n\n  * ### Mystery of Ancient Space Superstorms Deepens\n\nKatherine Kornei\n\n  * ### Should You Really Worry about Solar Flares?\n\nEd Browne\n\n  * ### Solar 'Superflares' Rocked Earth Less Than 10,000 Years Ago--and Could Strike Again\n\nJonathan O'Callaghan\n\n  * ### How to See the Lunar Far Side Right Here on Earth\n\nPhil Plait\n\nDespite their, well, prominence, these fountains are relatively benign\nphenomena. The magnetic fields that shape them, however, can spark very real\ndangers.\n\nThe tangled field lines emanating from sunspots store vast amounts of energy\nand can interact, snap and reconnect to release that energy. Sometimes it\u2019s a\nrelatively minor event, but other times the energy release triggers more lines\nto snap and reconnect, releasing more energy, leading to a runaway cascade of\ntriggering events. Think of it like a bag of mousetraps: one snaps shut and\njostles the bag, making others snap over and again, rapidly discharging their\nstored energy in a single explosive event.\n\nNow imagine each one of these mousetraps is the equivalent of, oh, say a few\nhundred million thermonuclear bombs, and you will start to get the idea of how\nthe sweatiest sci-fi apocalypse doesn\u2019t even come close to the power of a\nsolar flare.\n\nBig flares fire out high-energy x-ray and gamma radiation that can damage\nsatellites orbiting Earth; when those photons strike the metal casing of a\nspacecraft, they blast away clouds of electrons like shrapnel, and these fast-\nmoving particles generate strong pulses of hardware-frying electromagnetic\nenergy. Such flares are one of the major reasons why spacecraft engineers\nharden onboard computers against radiation to prevent them from shorting out.\n\nCoronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are also ridiculously powerful solar\nphenomena. If solar flares are like tornadoes\u2014local but intense\u2014CMEs are like\nfar larger hurricanes. They don\u2019t emit much visible light, but they blast\nupwards of a billion tons of hydrogen into space, sometimes at speeds of\nseveral thousand kilometers per second.\n\nIf one is aimed at Earth, it can interact with our planet\u2019s geomagnetic field,\ncausing all sorts of havoc. A CME strike can funnel huge numbers of electrons\ndown toward our north and south poles, creating spectacular auroras. But the\nother effects are not so appealing: the sudden fluctuations in the magnetic\nfield can induce incredibly strong currents of electricity inside Earth. These\ncan overpower our electric grids and create widespread blackouts. A fierce CME\nin 1989 caused a blackout in Quebec that lasted for days.\n\nTogether we call flares and CMEs solar storms, and scientists take them very\nseriously. The first solar storm ever detected, called the Carrington Event,\noccurred in 1859 and was incredibly powerful; if something that big were to\nhit our much more wired-up Earth today, it would cause widespread blackouts\nand chaos as transformers blew up and satellites got zapped. In 2012 a monster\nstorm at least as powerful as the one in 1859 erupted from the sun. Happily it\nwas not aimed at Earth; it missed us by tens of millions of kilometers. Had it\nhit us, though, well, it would\u2019ve been very, very bad.\n\nA growing body of evidence also hints that much more rarely the sun blows out\na truly apocalyptic storm. Data from ancient tree rings and ice cores suggest\nthat in C.E. 774 a solar storm hit our planet that was so powerful that it\nsignificantly altered our atmospheric chemistry. Similar data from even deeper\nback in time are best explained by another epochal solar storm occurring in\n7176 B.C.E.; this may have been the most powerful eruption from the sun to\nstrike Earth in the past 10,000 years.\n\nIt\u2019s very unlikely that such a blockbuster will slam into us this cycle, but\nwe are seeing increased activity from the sun. At least two sunspots in recent\nweeks got big enough to see by eye, and there have been some decently powerful\nflares as well. This isn\u2019t to say you need to fret over every flare that\noccurs, but over the long run, these storms are a threat we need to deal with.\n\nWhile we are not as prepared for such a global event as I think we should\nbe\u2014reinforcing the electricity grid and making it more decentralized would be\na good start\u2014the good news is that astronomers are studying the sun with\nfierce devotion to better understand and predict its outbursts. Several space-\nbased observatories, such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, Solar\nDynamics Observatory and Parker Solar Probe, observe our star 24 hours a day,\nand the newly opened Daniel K. Inouye Solar Observatory sees the sun in\nunprecedented detail, giving us insight into its structure and magnetic\nactivity.\n\nThe sun provides light, warmth and life for us on Earth, but it\u2019s also a\nstar\u2014a massive ball of thermonuclear and electromagnetic fury\u2014and it would do\nus all well to never forget that.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nPhil Plait is a professional astronomer and science communicator in Virginia.\nHe writes the Bad Astronomy Newsletter.
