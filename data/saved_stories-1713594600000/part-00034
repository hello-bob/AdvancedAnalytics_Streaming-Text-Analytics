Just a few\nmonths later, the asking price plummeted to $600,000.\n\nAccording to Fortune, which cited a report from The Boston Globe, the dramatic\nprice decrease was related to an overheating planet \u2014 in a matter of a few\nweeks, the shoreline surrounding the property lost 70 feet from erosion due to\nrising seas.\n\nStill, this didn't stop New York resident Brendan Maddigan, who frequently\nvisits Nantucket, from laying down an all-cash offer on the property after the\nprice drop.\n\n\"The home is amazing. The location is amazing,\" he said, per Fortune. \"And the\nprice mitigates the risk to a good degree. I'd like to think that it'll be\nthere for a while, but I was definitely aware of the risk of any particular\nstorm causing a problem in the future.\"\n\n### Why are rising seas concerning?\n\n\"As sea levels continue to rise, we're also seeing land areas sink, both due\nto the increased temperatures from human caused climate change,\" Kathleen\nBiggins, founder and president of nonpartisan climate change education\norganization C-Change Conversations, told Fortune.\n\nGood news, green hacks, and the latest cool clean tech \u2014 straight to your\ninbox every week!\n\n#### Watch now: These futuristic gas stations could completely change what\nit's like to own an EV\n\nThese futuristic gas stations could completely change what it's like to own an\nEV\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 14 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nCopied\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n01:14\n\n01:14\n\nShe added that this will make certain areas uninsurable or extremely costly to\ninsure.\n\nThis is concerning, as nearly 40% of Americans live in coastal areas. Besides\nsea level rise and erosion, coastal communities face other climate-driven\nweather threats such as high-tide flooding and hurricanes, according to the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Globally, 37% of people live\nwithin about 62 miles of a coast.\n\n### What's being done about rising seas?\n\nSome coastal residents are doing what they can to save their properties from\nrising sea levels. For instance, a group of homeowners in Salisbury,\nMassachusetts, paid more than half a million dollars to construct a giant sand\ndune to protect their beachfront properties from dangerous tides and prevent\ncoastal erosion. The 15,000-ton structure, which was completed in February,\nwashed away just days later.\n\nA few companies are also trying to get ahead of rising seas by offering\nsolutions such as floating homes and office buildings.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and actionable info that makes it easy\nto help yourself while helping the planet.\n\n  * share\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Link Copied!\n\n## Cool Picks\n\n#### This startup helps you save money on your utility bills by switching to\nsolar power \u2014 no rooftop panels necessary\n\n#### Here's how to lower your energy bills in a single click \u2014 without getting\nscammed by electricity companies\n\n#### Here's a simple way to turn your old sneakers into actual cash: 'I can\ntell you firsthand \u2014 it works'\n\n#### This new law is like a free '$8,000 bank account' for remodeling your\nhome \u2014 here's how to take advantage of it\n\n  * ABOUT\n  * PRIVACY\n  * TERMS\n  * CONTACT\n\n#### Follow Us\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n\n\u00a9 2024 THE COOL DOWN COMPANY.
