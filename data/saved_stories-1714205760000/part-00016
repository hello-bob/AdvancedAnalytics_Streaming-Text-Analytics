According to a global survey carried out by the\nInstitute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma\nde Barcelona (ICTA-UAB), the phenomenon has gained momentum globally in recent\nyears, with more than 470 Bike Bus routes worldwide, transporting 32,000\nchildren to school every week.\n\nA Bike Bus is a group of children who\u2014accompanied by their family members\u2014ride\ntheir bikes to school along a route with predetermined stops and schedules.\nThe practice, which began in 1998 in Brecht, Belgium, became popular in 2021\nwhen an initiative from Barcelona went viral on the internet. The report,\nprepared by researchers from the BCN City Lab group at ICTA-UAB, analyzes\nexisting Bike Bus initiatives through interviews with promoters of 93 Bike Bus\nroutes in eight countries, collecting their characteristics, diversity,\nmotivations, impacts and sustainability over time.\n\nThe results show that 94% of participants see Bike Bus as a form of activism,\nhighlighting its role in promoting systemic changes in transport and demanding\na more bike-friendly city for children. Safety is the main concern, with 92%\nof respondents feeling unsafe to cycle to school without the protection of the\ngroup. The lack of adequate infrastructure and heavy traffic in their cities\nare some of the reasons.\n\nThe survey shows that 67% of the participants are young children, with an\naverage age of 8 years. Although the routes are sometimes overcrowded, the\ngroups consist of about 17 people (on average 10 children and 7 adults). On\naverage, the routes are organized once a week and cover a distance of 1 to 2\nkilometers on the road, which takes 20 minutes.\n\nRegarding gender distribution, girls comprise 47% of the children's\nparticipants. The insecurity expressed by the interviewees regarding their\nusual routes to school explains why 37% of Bike Bus participants are parents\naccompanying their children. They feel that the cycle paths, where they exist,\nare too narrow, require advanced skill to navigate, and intersections are\nunsafe because car drivers do not expect bikes, especially smaller children's\nbikes. Similarly, more than half of respondents felt that bicycle parking was\nan obstacle to participating in this initiative.\n\n\"What began as a means to shelter children from traffic has evolved into a\ncelebration of cycling and a way of demanding more child-friendly cities. They\nhave proved to be an effective way of increasing the visibility of cyclists on\nthe streets and fostering a sense of community,\" explains Jordi Honey-Ros\u00e9s,\nresearcher at ICTA-UAB and head of the study.\n\nAlthough the survey results show a significant increase in the use of Bike\nBus, they also highlight future challenges in terms of its long-term\nviability. Currently, most efforts are driven and funded by individual\nleaders, raising questions about their institutional sustainability in the\nlong term. The study therefore highlights the need for greater government and\nfinancial support to formally integrate Bike Bus into school transport\nsystems. However, researchers warn of the delicate balance between\ninstitutional support and the active participation of parents and cycling\nactivist groups.\n\n\"The Bike Bus is more than a means of transport; it is a statement of\nprinciple about the importance of sustainable mobility and the safety of our\nchildren, and we hope that this study will serve as a call to action for\ncommunities and governments worldwide to support and expand this\ntransformative initiative,\" concludes Honey-Ros\u00e9s.\n\nMore information: A Global Survey of Bike Bus Initiatives, (2024)\n\nProvided by Autonomous University of Barcelona\n\nCitation: Bike Bus gains supporters as a way to promote sustainable and safe\nmobility (2024, April 18) retrieved 26 April 2024 from\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-04-bike-bus-gains-sustainable-safe.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
