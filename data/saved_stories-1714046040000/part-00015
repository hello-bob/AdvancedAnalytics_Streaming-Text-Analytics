Still,\n> it does seem notable that, when signing the bill, Biden didn\u2019t even mention\n> the TikTok ban in his remarks.\n\nThis is a couple of years after Meta, clearly threatened by the app\u2019s enormous\ngrowth, started employing a PR firm to kick off an anti-TikTok campaign.\n\nThere are a few worries at play:\n\n  * TikTok will irresponsibly collect enormous amounts of data about hundreds of millions of Americans, something no other social network would ever do\n  * There\u2019s a possibility that TikTok will be used to spread propaganda, unlike every other social network\n  * TikTok is Chinese, not American\n\nThe third is most pertinent. These are clearly things \u2014 gathering data,\nspreading propaganda \u2014 that only American companies should do to Americans (or\nto the rest of the world).\n\nIronically, banning a service from the open internet nationwide is exactly the\nkind of thing that China has done again and again through its Great Firewall.\nRather than protect American users through the kinds of far-reaching privacy\nlegislation that we need, government chose to address TikTok alone on the\nbasis of what amounts to xenophobic protectionism.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of xenophobia we saw at a Senate hearing on child safety earlier\nin the year:\n\n> \u201cYou often say that you live in Singapore,\u201d Cotton said before demanding to\n> know where Chew\u2019s passport was from (Singapore, obviously) and whether he\u2019d\n> applied for citizenship in China or the US (no, said Chew). \u201cHave you ever\n> been a member of the Chinese Communist Party?\u201d he then asked abruptly, as if\n> hoping to catch Chew by surprise. Chew\u2019s response wasn\u2019t shocked so much as\n> fed up. \u201cSenator! I\u2019m Singaporean!\u201d he reiterated. \u201cNo.\u201d (Singapore is not\n> part of China.)\n\nThe Verge further made this point:\n\n> It\u2019s not even necessary to make the case that China might have undue\n> influence over TikTok. Apple, for instance, has weathered years of critiques\n> about its relationship to the Chinese government; no reasonable person has\n> ever suggested this hinges on Tim Cook being a secret communist. Instead,\n> it\u2019s a line of questioning that seems simply designed to play on Chew\u2019s\n> foreignness \u2014 even when it\u2019s got nothing to do with the topic at hand.\n\nIt\u2019s not that TikTok is particularly harmful compared to other similar apps:\nit\u2019s that we\u2019re deathly afraid of China.\n\nI find it unsettling that a global platform - the internet, that is - which\nseeks to connect everyone in the world is being undermined for Americans in\nthis way. Should this precedent spiral, it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that\nmore foreign services that threaten American incumbents will be banned or\nforced to divest. The result would be a National Internet, culturally and\neconomically cut off from the rest of the world: something so dystopian that\nI\u2019ve written it into science fiction stories.\n\nBeyond nationalism, the propaganda argument may ironically cover for the fact\nthat viewers are likely to encounter a wider range of international\nviewpoints:\n\n> Anti-China hysteria may be completely grounded in xenophobia, but some\n> legislators clearly also don\u2019t care for the content of TikTok. Raja\n> Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat supportive of the anti-TikTok\n> legislation, recently raised concerns over TikTok\u2019s content recommendations.\n> TikTok has been criticized for presenting its users with \u201cpro-Palestinian\u201d\n> content. It has been a major source of videos of the unfolding atrocities in\n> Gaza, and a ban of TikTok could, as the Independent\u2019s Io Dodds reports,\n> \u201cclobber the pro-Palestine movement,\u201d supporters of which have used the\n> platform effectively for communication.\n\nCurrent Affairs concludes:\n\n> The disconnect between the American people\u2019s interests and the priorities of\n> national politicians has never been more stark. We need to resist their\n> attempt to get us to be afraid of Chinese people, and to control platforms\n> where viewpoints unfavorable to U.S. imperialism are given a public airing.\n\nThis in itself feels un-American: a violation of the democratic rights\nenshrined in the First Amendment and the principle of free speech. We have the\nright to learn about those viewpoints, and to receive media created elsewhere\nin the world. Just as on the web itself, which allows us to learn about the\nworld from a variety of perspectives, we\u2019re richer for it.\n\nI imagine there will be a battery of lawsuits from the international investors\nwho actually own TikTok on the back of this legislation. It\u2019ll be interesting\nto see what happens, and what the response from other nations will be.\n\nPersonally, I just think it\u2019s stupid.\n\nabout 2 hours ago \u00b7 Posts \u00b7 Share this post\n\nShare this post on social media.\n\nI\u2019m writing about the intersection of the internet, media, and society.
