It created BREIT, a\nprivate fund that buys commercial real estate like warehouses and apartment\nbuildings, and marketed it to everyday investors as an \"all-weather strategy\nto build long-term wealth across market cycles.\"\n\nAnd it was magic: By offering an annual dividend of about 4% in a world where\ninterest rates were close to zero, BREIT quickly became a giant. At its peak\nin 2021, the fund was attracting as much as $3 billion a month in new\ninvestments. Today, BREIT boasts assets of $114 billion \u2014 about 8% of\nBlackstone's entire fee-earning assets \u2014 and has generated over $5 billion in\nmanagement and performance fees.\n\nBut over the past two years, some investors have grown suspicious that BREIT\nisn't the rock-solid investment Blackstone claims it is. Since its inception,\nthe fund says it has delivered an annualized net return of 10.5% \u2014 almost\ndouble an index of publicly traded REITs. Even as commercial real estate has\nbeen battered in the wake of the pandemic, BREIT has somehow managed to defy\ngravity, outperforming comparable funds by seemingly fantastic margins. In the\nfall of 2022, after the Fed's interest-rate increases began to shake the\ncommercial real-estate market, investors began asking for their money back \u2014\nmore than $15 billion to date. Faced with a run on the fund, Blackstone cited\na provision that allowed it to take its time refunding antsy investors \u2014 a\ndecision that only served to further alarm the market. Shares in Blackstone\ntumbled by nearly 20%. Last year, BREIT failed to generate enough cash to\ncover its annual dividend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent months, the fund has appeared to recover from the debacle. BREIT\nannounced it was able to fulfill 100% of the repurchase requests it received\nin February, which had slowed to just under $1 billion. Amid the promise of a\nrebound, Blackstone's stock has regained almost 50% from its lows. \"I believe\nwe'll look back at 2023 as the cyclical bottom for our firm,\" Steve\nSchwarzman, Blackstone's CEO, told analysts at an earnings call in January.\n\nInvestors in Blackstone's real-estate fund asked for their money back in\ndroves \u2014 more than $15 billion to date. Jeenah Moon/Reuters\n\nBut the rosy picture that Blackstone paints may not tell the whole story. In\nrecent months I've spoken with veteran analysts, accountants, and investors\nwho have come to believe that BREIT is essentially a house of cards. That's\nbecause the returns the fund claims it has delivered depend almost entirely on\nBREIT's own estimates, which skeptics believe are wildly inflated. What's\nmore, when BREIT faced a flood of redemption requests from investors, it only\nfulfilled all those requests after raising cash from new investors \u2014 including\none that received a sweetheart deal from Blackstone to invest in BREIT. \"It is\nthe absolute definition of a Ponzi scheme,\" said Nate Koppikar, who runs a\nhedge fund called Orso Partners that has shorted Blackstone's stock because of\nconcerns over BREIT. Unless the real-estate market comes roaring back,\nanalysts warn, BREIT could end up shrinking to a fraction of its current size,\nleaving the fund's investors holding the bag.\n\n\"Surveying some of the ways that Blackstone has misled investors over the past\nfive months, we are more convinced than ever that BREIT is a bad investment\ncreated for the benefit of Blackstone,\" Craig McCann, a financial analyst who\nserved as an economist at the Securities Exchange Commission, wrote last year.\n\"Investors should not accept anything Blackstone and BREIT state as truthful.\"\n\nIt's impossible to know exactly how valuable BREIT is. Because the fund is not\npublicly traded, the market doesn't set its price per share \u2014 Blackstone does.\nYou buy shares in BREIT based on your faith in Blackstone's investing\nbrilliance and in the firm's account of its own performance. Investing in a\nprivate real-estate trust like BREIT is, ultimately, an exercise in trust.\n\nBREIT's returns are based on a measure called net asset value, or NAV. That's\nsupposed to be the value of all the assets the fund owns, minus its debt.\nBlackstone told Business Insider that it has an \"incredibly rigorous valuation\nprocess\" \u2014 one it says has led it to adjust its NAV more aggressively than\nother REITS. But BREIT doesn't let investors or regulators see some of the\ncrucial assumptions that go into calculating its NAV. As BREIT's financial\ndocuments state, Blackstone \"is ultimately and solely responsible for the\ndetermination of our NAV.\" The methods used to calculate it are \"not\nprescribed by rules of the SEC or any other regulatory agency,\" and the NAV\n\"is not audited by our independent registered public accounting firm.\"\n\nChilton Capital Management, which invests in publicly traded REITs, analyzed\nthe way Blackstone adjusts the value of BREIT to reflect changes in the\nunderlying real estate it owns. Rather than being \"marked to market\" every day\n\u2014 or every millisecond, like public REITS \u2014 Blackstone adjusts its NAV on a\nmonthly basis. In today's volatile real-estate market, that means its stated\nvalue can lag way behind reality. \"It inherently is a flawed process when\nprices are changing quickly,\" Chilton observes. \"We refer to this imperfect\nappraisal process as 'mark to magic.'\" In 2022, after the crash in commercial\nreal estate, publicly traded REITs that own assets similar to BREIT's \u2014\nmultifamily housing and industrial buildings \u2014 have been selling at sharp\ndiscounts. But BREIT, by \"marking to magic,\" has continued to claim far higher\nreturns. Using a collection of market-based metrics, Chilton concluded last\nApril that BREIT was overstating the value of its NAV by more than 55%.\n\nMcCann, who is now a principal at SLCG Economics Consulting, reached a similar\nconclusion. He calculated that the cumulative returns of other funds in the\nsectors in which BREIT is concentrated plunged by over 30% in 2022. Yet BREIT\nclaimed that its value increased during the same period. In the dry language\nof market analysts, McCann called the fund's claims about its NAV\n\"unreliable.\"\n\nBlackstone considers such comparisons unfair. It insists that BREIT shouldn't\nbe compared to publicly traded funds, which it argues are more volatile than\nprivate offerings. In a statement to BI, the firm insists that BREIT is able\nto outperform other funds for a simple reason: because it owns better assets\nthan they do. BREIT's portfolio, Blackstone says, is \"concentrated in the best\nperforming sectors (data centers, logistics and student housing) and\ngeographies (virtually no urban exposure).\" Only 3% of BREIT's holdings are in\noffice buildings, which have been ground zero for commercial real estate pain.\nThe company points to its performance during the global financial crisis of\n2008 as evidence of its ability to outperform its competitors during \"periods\nof dislocation\" and notes that it has sold $20 billion of real estate since\nthe beginning of 2022, when interest rates began to rise, generating a profit\nof $4 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Not all real estate is created equal,\" BREIT boasted in a recent letter to\nstockholders, \"and where you invest matters.\"\n\nOne of four commercial centers Blackstone owns near Lisbon. The company argues\nthat BREIT's valuation remains high because the assets in its portfolio are\nsuperior to those in other funds. Horacio Villalobos/Getty Images\n\nBut Blackstone's principal claim \u2014 that sounder investments have led to higher\nreturns \u2014 is difficult to square with the ongoing decline of commercial real\nestate. It's hard to fathom how BREIT could have bought so many properties at\nthe height of the market and yet somehow been selective enough to have dodged\nall the post-pandemic downturns suffered by other funds. According to BREIT's\nown numbers, data centers and student housing make up only a small part of its\nportfolio. And many of the data centers Blackstone says have already created\nso much value for the fund aren't even up and running yet \u2014 they're still in\ndevelopment.\n\nPublicly traded REITs, meanwhile, aren't the only ones marking down their\nassets. Bluerock Total Income + Real Estate, which has over $300 billion\ninvested in a host of institutional real estate funds, has marked its NAV back\nto pre-pandemic levels \u2014 down more than 20% from its peak. Other major\ninvestors, unlike Blackstone, apparently don't see their real estate holdings\nas immune from the chaos buffeting the rest of the market.\n\nBlackstone also argues in its marketing material that BREIT is better\npositioned than other real-estate funds because its balance sheet is\n\"substantially hedged,\" meaning it has fixed-rate debt and derivatives in\nplace that protect against rising interest rates. That's true \u2014 for the\nmoment. But BREIT's future cash flows are, in fact, very sensitive to interest\nrates. At the end of last year, BREIT had $62 billion of debt secured by its\nproperties, and it paid an effective interest rate of 4.3% that it locked in\nbefore rates spiked. But $47 billion of that debt will come due over the next\nfour years \u2014 and if rates stay elevated, BREIT could face over $1 billion in\nadded interest costs. That, BREIT has warned investors, \"could reduce our cash\nflows and our ability to make distributions to you.\" Investing in BREIT is\nessentially a bet that interest rates are going to fall \u2014 because if they\ndon't, it could be ruinous.\n\nYou might argue that it ultimately doesn't matter if BREIT is overvaluing its\nNAV. As long as investors keep getting their hefty annual dividends, who\ncares? That's basically the same argument that Donald Trump made in defending\nhimself against charges of systematically overstating his assets \u2014 that\neverybody made money, so no one was defrauded. But miscalculating the value of\na vehicle like BREIT inflates the fees investors pay for participating in the\nfund while simultaneously depriving them of the opportunity to accurately\nassess the risk they're taking. In addition, Blackstone is incentivized to\novervalue its NAV, because that's the number it uses to calculate the\nmanagement and performance fees that investors pay. \"It's a text-book example\nof conflict of interests,\" Robert Chang, the head of securities litigation at\nFideres, a consulting firm that specializes in investigating corporate\nwrongdoing, wrote in a piece about BREIT. Fideres calculates that since early\n2022, the fund's NAV per share has remained relatively stable \u2014 while public\nREITs have lost more than 30% of their value. If BREIT's assets are indeed\novervalued, Fideres estimates, investors may have overpaid management and\nperformance fees to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\n\nThe alarm bells over BREIT go beyond whether Blackstone is overstating the\nfund's value. BREIT has said that through June of last year, 100% of its\ndividends were funded by cash flows from operations \u2014 the money produced by\nits real-estate assets. But that claim is more than a little misleading. In\nthe measure of cash that BREIT highlights, it doesn't subtract the\nexpenditures required to maintain its properties, which is standard for the\nindustry. In its own fine print, in fact, BREIT does provide several other\nmeasures that are more analogous to how most REITS define cash flow; by those\nmeasures, the fund has never been able to cover its dividend from its cash\nflow.\n\n> \"No one I spoke with believes that Blackstone set out to build a house of\n> cards. Rather, they say, BREIT was a victim of its own success. \"\n\nIn its response to BI, Blackstone argues that because its management fees are\nnot paid in cash, they are \"properly excluded\" from some of its measures. But\nnot being able to pay the dividend you've promised can be seen as a Ponzi-ish\nwarning, because it means the money has to come from selling off assets,\nborrowing money, or attracting new investors \u2014 a reality that BREIT\nacknowledges on the third page of its financial documents (and one that the\nSEC has noted as a risk factor for all private REITS). And if you subtract\nBlackstone's fees, BREIT has covered less than 50% of its dividend\ndistribution since its inception. Indeed, one of the primary reasons BREIT has\nbeen able to pay its dividends is because roughly half of all shareholders\nhave elected to receive their dividends not in cash, but in more shares of\nBREIT. In other words, the game depends on the continued belief of investors \u2014\non their willingness to accept shares of BREIT in lieu of cash.\n\nGetting paid in shares, of course, is not the same as getting paid in cash.\nThe more shares BREIT issues to pay the dividend \u2014 and its fees to Blackstone\n\u2014 the less each share is worth. \"On the surface, it all looks so safe,\" McCann\ntells BI. \"You're getting 4% or so a year, and you think it looks like a bond,\nand you think the underlying investments are doing well. Only when you dig in\ndo you figure out that even if you're taking cash, the money is a return of\ncapital, not a return on capital.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2022, when investors started asking for their money back in droves, BREIT\nfaced a big problem. If its assets weren't marked correctly, it couldn't sell\nthem off to pay investors without fessing up. Then the fund got what looked\nlike a vote of confidence. In January 2023, BREIT announced that the\nUniversity of California had decided to invest $4 billion in the fund, giving\nit a much-needed infusion of cash. Schwarzman called the investment a\n\"validation\" of BREIT's strategy.\n\nBut it wasn't. To entice the university to invest, Blackstone had offered it a\nspecial deal. BREIT agreed to award the university an additional $1 billion in\nstock in the event that the fund's rate of return fell below 11.25%. The deal\nwas so sweet that UC's Board of Regents quickly agreed to invest another $500\nmillion on the same terms.\n\n\"Contrary to Blackstone's spin,\" wrote McCann, \"the University of California\ninvestment strongly supports the view that BREIT is a terrible investment.\"\n\nStudents at the University of California protested the school system's\ninvestment in BREIT, which came after Blackstone offered a special guarantee\non the deal. Michael Blackshire/Getty Images\n\nScoring the new investment helped BREIT pay off all those who wanted to exit\nthe fund, albeit slowly. And for the moment, the stampede appears to have\nsubsided.\n\nBlackstone says that BREIT has \"access to ample liquidity across multiple\nsources,\" including \"$119.1 billion of high-quality real estate that can be\nsold at market prices if we choose to do so.\" But if investors stage another\nrush for the doors, BREIT could face a serious reckoning, especially given its\nhigh level of debt. If it has overvalued its properties, as some experts\nsuggest, then it will have to sell its assets at a price below where they are\nmarked. And the more shareholders it has to redeem, the faster its equity will\nbecome worthless. Those who get their money out early will be OK. Those who\nare last in line, not so much.\n\n\"If BREIT has to sell properties to meet redemptions, and they have to dip\ndeeper into their portfolio to sell less desirable properties, they'll have to\nmark their NAV to reflect the actual sales prices,\" says Phil Bak, the founder\nand CEO of Armada Investors, a quantitative asset manager that specializes in\nREITs. \"That could scare the people who have been clinging to fund performance\nas a reason not to redeem, which in turn causes a death spiral.\"\n\nNo one I spoke with believes that Blackstone set out to build a house of\ncards. Rather, they say, BREIT was a victim of its own success. Money poured\nin at the height of the market, meaning that BREIT invested at a moment when\ncommercial real estate was priced to perfection. Real estate, by its nature,\nis always somewhat illiquid \u2014 you can't sell your share of an apartment\nbuilding on the stock market. And in a bad market, it's very illiquid,\nespecially if what you own is marked at a price where no one will buy it. But\nwhile Blackstone says it designed BREIT so investors could get their money\nout, it seems not to have foreseen that scores of individual investors \u2014\nunlike the big institutions that have typically been its clients, who are\nforced to commit their funds for long periods of time \u2014 might get spooked\nenough to ask for their money back all at the same time. Titans of Wall Street\noften believe that their brilliance should insulate them from skepticism.\nTheir supreme confidence in their own wisdom is perhaps their most marketable\nasset.\n\nIt's completely possible, of course, that BREIT will survive, no matter how\nflawed its model might be. If the real-estate market reignites, that will\nboost the value of the assets in funds like BREIT. And if enough new investors\nare willing to place bets on BREIT \u2014 if trust in Blackstone's \"magic\" remains\nhigh \u2014 then everyone will keep making money, if only on paper, even if BREIT\nis overvaluing its assets. Blackstone's success has already created at least\nthree billionaires, chief among them its CEO, Steve Schwarzman, who is worth\nalmost $40 billion. The ability to enrich yourself seems to be a key part of\nwhat inspires others to follow your investment advice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCEO Stephen Schwarzman insists the worst is behind Blackstone, even as\nanalysts remain worried about BREIT's prospects in a volatile market. Shannon\nStapleton/Reuters\n\nBut there are plenty of warning signs that things could get worse. It's\nunlikely that the market will pick up fast enough to offset BREIT's woes.\n\"Commercial real estate is a slow burn,\" Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of\nAmerica, recently observed. In its financial statements, Blackstone says it\ncontinues to count on \"high single-digit growth\" in its two biggest sectors,\nrental housing and industrial properties. But BREIT's overall growth was just\n6% last year, and it has been decelerating quarter over quarter. If the market\ncontinues to fall, it will be harder for BREIT to claim it's the shining\nexception.\n\nTo make matters worse, the way BREIT is structured could prove to be a ticking\ntime bomb. Like other private vehicles, BREIT pays hefty commissions to\nfinancial advisors who steer their clients to the fund. All told, Blackstone\nhas paid Wall Street banks and brokers more than $700 million in brokerage\nfees. But for brokers who put their clients in BREIT early on, those\ncommissions could soon hit a mandated cap of 8.75% \u2014 meaning they'll no longer\nbe incentivized to sell the fund. If they start advising their clients to exit\nBREIT, it could spur an even bigger rush for the doors.\n\nThe future of BREIT could also send shock waves through Blackstone's bottom\nline. In 2022 alone, SLCG calculated, fees from BREIT generated 13.3% of\nBlackstone's total management fees and 12.6% of its performance revenue. If\nBREIT and its sister fund, BPP, are forced to slash their NAVs by 50%, the\nensuing reduction in fees would wipe out over 15% of Blackstone's fee-related\nearnings \u2014 earnings that Wall Street, in contrast, is expecting will grow by\n15%. According to Blackstone's financial statements, it's already anticipating\nit will have to pay the University of California $564 million in BREIT stock \u2014\nan expense it doesn't count in the numbers it highlights to Wall Street. If\nBREIT craters, it will also be difficult for Blackstone to live up to Wall\nStreet's expectations for its long-term earnings growth, which depend in part\non its successful expansion into the retail market.\n\nThere are bigger issues at stake than Blackstone's bottom line. It's worth\nremembering, as Chilton notes, that private funds like BREIT were among \"the\nbiggest losers\" during the global financial crisis of 2008. But that lesson\nseems lost on today's investors, who have once again flocked to private real-\nestate funds in a time of extreme market volatility. In the two years after\nthe pandemic hit, private funds like BREIT raised $67 billion \u2014 far more than\nthey drummed up in the two years leading up to the Great Recession. \"While the\ntombstones may have different names on them,\" Chilton observes, \"the reasons\nfor the demise of private equity real estate players are going to rhyme, and\npossibly mirror those from the global financial crisis.\"\n\nThat's why the story of BREIT involves more than profits and losses. It's only\nrecently that private-equity firms like Blackstone have started offering\nproducts to ordinary investors. \"BREIT was a test case for the whole\nindustry,\" says Koppikar, of Orso Partners. Perhaps, given the questions\nswirling around BREIT, it's time to rethink whether the world's wealthiest\nfunds should be trusted to take billions of dollars in fees from ordinary\ninvestors without more oversight. As it stands, it's impossible to know what\nBREIT's assets are actually worth \u2014 and therein lies the problem. In the\nabsence of a market price, independent accounting and tighter government\nregulation are needed to ensure that investors have the accurate, verifiable\nnumbers they need to make informed decisions. With private funds like BREIT,\ntoo much maneuvering takes place in the dark. And if history is any lesson,\nthe dark is a very bad place to be doing business.\n\nBethany McLean is a special correspondent at Business Insider.\n\n#### About Discourse Stories\n\nThrough our Discourse journalism, Business Insider seeks to explore and\nilluminate the day\u2019s most fascinating issues and ideas.
