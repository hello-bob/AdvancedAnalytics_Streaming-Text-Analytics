The submodule named go contains the Go source code. By default, the\nsubmodule's remote URL is the official GitHub mirror of Go, golang/go. The\ncanonical Git repository for Go source code is located at\nhttps://go.googlesource.com/go.\n\nThis project is not involved in producing the official binary distributions of\nGo.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the Go source files are distributed under the BSD-\nstyle license found in the LICENSE file.\n\nIf you are using this fork and have a Microsoft corporate account, consider\nclicking here to instantly join the Microsoft Go Toolset Announcements email\ndistribution list \ud83d\udce7 and receive notifications about Microsoft releases of Go\nand breaking changes. We also maintain an internal doc page.\n\n## Why does this fork exist?\n\nThis repository produces a modified version of Go that can be used to build\nFIPS 140-2 compliant applications. Our goal is to share this implementation\nwith others in the Go community who have the same requirement, and to merge\nthis capability into upstream Go as soon as possible. See eng/doc/fips for\nmore information about this feature and the history of FIPS 140-2 compliance\nin Go.\n\nThe binaries produced by this repository are also intended for general use\nwithin Microsoft instead of the official binary distribution of Go.\n\nWe call this repository a fork even though it isn't a traditional Git fork.\nIts branches do not share Git ancestry with the Go repository. However, the\nrepository serves the same purpose as a Git fork: maintaining a modified\nversion of the Go source code over time.\n\n## Support\n\nThis project follows the upstream Go Release Policy. This means we support\neach major release (1.X) until there are two newer major releases. A new Go\nmajor version is released every six months, so each Go major version is\nsupported for about one year.\n\nWhen upstream Go releases a new minor version (1.X.Y), we release a\ncorresponding microsoft/go version that may also include fork-specific\nchanges. This normally happens once a month. At any time, we may release a new\nrevision (1.X.Y-Z) to fix an issue without waiting for the next upstream minor\nrelease. Revision releases are uncommon.\n\nEach microsoft/go release is announced in the internal Microsoft Go Toolset\nAnnouncements email distribution list \ud83d\udce7.\n\n## Download and install\n\nThis repository's infrastructure currently supports these OS/Arch\ncombinations:\n\n  * linux_amd64\n  * linux_armv6l\n  * linux_arm64\n  * windows_amd64\n\nSee eng/README.md for more details about the infrastructure.\n\n### Binary distribution\n\n  * microsoft/go-images distributes the binaries of this Go fork by producing Docker images that are published to the Microsoft Container Registry. This is the recommended way to use the Microsoft build of Go.\n\n  * Binary archives: visit the microsoft/main branch eng/doc/Downloads.md file to download binaries and source tarballs built by supported release branches.\n\n  * GitHub Releases: the microsoft/go GitHub releases have source code archive attachments and an assets.json file that can be used to locate the binaries for that release.\n\nDon't see an option that works for you? Let us know! File a GitHub issue, or\ncomment on an existing issue in this tag:\n\n### Build from source\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n  * PowerShell 6+\n  * Go install from source prerequisites\n\n    * Exception: this repository's build script automatically downloads a bootstrap version of Go.\n\nAfter cloning the repository, use the following build command. You can pass\nthe -help flag to show more options:\n\n    \n    \n    pwsh eng/run.ps1 build -refresh\n\nThe resulting Go binary can then be found at go/bin/go.\n\n> If you download a source archive from a GitHub release, use the official Go\n> install from source instructions. These source archives only include the go\n> directory, not the microsoft/go build infrastructure.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
