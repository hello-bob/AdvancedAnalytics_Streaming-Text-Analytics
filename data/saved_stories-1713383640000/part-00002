According to the outlets, up to 2.3\nmillion of these \u00e9migr\u00e9s might never return home.\n\n\u201cIt has become clear that assimilation would be extremely fast if we do not\nchange our policy towards Ukrainians abroad,\u201d Kuleba said. The minister added\nthat he does not believe \u201cmost Ukrainians who left will return.\u201d He also\nmaintained that the authorities should work with those living abroad for them\nto \u201cremain Ukrainian.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Most Germans believe Ukrainian refugees have failed to integrate \u2013\npoll\n\nThe senior diplomat provided few details about the \u201ccomprehensive policy\u201d his\nministry was supposedly developing to achieve this goal. The list of measures\nmentioned by Kuleba involved \u201cmultiple citizenship\u201d and closer cooperation\nwith organized Ukrainian communities abroad, as well as digital consular\nservices.\n\nThe minister stated that his agency had already done some groundwork in\nresponse to a personal request from President Vladimir Zelensky, and was\nplanning to present proposals to him in the near future. \u201cThe president has\nset the goal,\u201d Kuleba said, noting that it will require coordination among\nvarious government structures due to its complex nature.\n\nA survey conducted by Germany\u2019s office for migration and refugees (BAMF) in\ncooperation with research and polling centers last July showed that 44% of\nUkrainians who went to Germany as refugees want to stay there \u2013 up from 39% in\na poll conducted the previous year.\n\nREAD MORE: Attitude to Ukrainians shifting dramatically in Poland \u2013 survey\n\nAnother poll from this February shows that Germans believe Ukrainians have\nfailed to integrate in the two years that have passed since the start of the\nconflict. Half of the respondents also said Ukrainian refugees receive \u2018too\nmuch support\u2019.\n\nAttitudes toward Ukrainians in Poland, another country that took in a large\nnumber of refugees, have also dramatically shifted, local media reported in\nFebruary. A significant number of Poles are now opposed to Ukrainians\ncontinuing to receive social and welfare benefits, the newspaper\nRzeczpospolita said, citing a January poll.\n\nThe media outlet also reported earlier that the influx of Ukrainians fleeing\nthe conflict led to an increase in crime in Poland.\n\nYou can share this story on social media:\n\nFollow RT on\n\nEuropean Union \u2013 EUGermanyPolandUkraine\n\nMixi.Media News\n\n## Top stories\n\n  * Second suspect detained over attempt to assassinate Ukrainian defector \u2013 FSB\n\nThe man allegedly delivered the components for the explosive device used in\nthe botched hit, Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service has said\n\nLatest\n\nTop Stories\n\n  * NATO member explains why it will block Ukraine from joining\n\n  * IMF sharply raises Russia\u2019s economic growth forecast\n\n  * West exploring all options on frozen Russian assets \u2013 US official\n\n  * Iran\u2019s strike on Israel was much more successful than it seems.
