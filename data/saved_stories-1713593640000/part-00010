In October 2022, a four-man team drew a 1,024km\nvelociraptor, while the current official benchmark was set a few months ago by\na father and daughter duo who drew a giant heart and raised more than \u00a325,000\nfor charity.\n\nThe heart measured 2,162km, meaning Koudlansky de Lustrac and Br\u00e9mond didn\u2019t\nleave much room for error, upping the benchmark by a mere 34km. It might have\nbeen even tighter, were it not for a couple of mini-detours in search of\nshelter and food, which threatened to throw off the circularity of the rings.\n\nAs for how they tackled the design, they set off west from the centre of the\nmiddle ring, before completing the bottom left ring clockwise and top left\nring anti-clockwise. They then ticked off the bottom half of the centre ring\nbefore moving anti-clockwise round the right-hand rings and returning to\ntackle the final top-right quarter of the centre ring as they returned to\nParis.\n\nFor that last leg, the pair even had company from former French pro Yoann\nOffredo, as well as numerous others joining them for the celebratory finale to\nthe Eiffel Tower. That moment came after a tough time out on the road, with\nplenty of rain and some vicious headwinds reported, along with headaches\nfinding shelter and, with one of the pair a vegan, decent food to eat.\n\n\"I think I ate fries ten times in ten days,\" Koudlansky de Lustrac told\nStrava. \u201cI started going crazy.\u201d\n\nBoth riders are no strangers to ultra-endurance feats of athleticism; in fact,\nthey met at the 2021 Race Across France. Koudlansky de Lustrac is also\nexperienced in off-beat challenges, holding the world record for the fastest\nmarathon run backwards.\n\n  * Read more: Largest GPS drawing by bike sets new individual Guinness World Record\n\nThere is also a serious side to their endeavours, with environmental concerns\nnever far from the surface. Koudlansky de Lustrac is planning to link every\nFrench ski resort \u2014 more than 300 \u2014 by bike this summer to \u201dtry and see what\nwe can do to save our mountains and ski stations in the future because of the\ncurrent climate\u201d.\n\nThe ride was also linked to the \u2018Le Sport a du C\u0153ur\u2019 organisation, which aims\nto use sport as a force for societal good. That, of course, ties back in to\nthe art the pair produced in light of this summer's Games.\n\n\"Take the Olympics as an excuse to do more sports and to get moving, even if\nit\u2019s to draw just a five-kilometre letter or something.\"\n\nFor more of the latest news and updates, visit our general news page.\n\n###### Strava\n\nStrava is an online app that allows users to track their activities and share\nthem with others.
