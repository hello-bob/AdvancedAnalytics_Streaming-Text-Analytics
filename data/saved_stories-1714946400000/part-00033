Click the image above to see a larger view, or click\nhere to buy your poster.\n\n### The Mandelmap poster includes:\n\n  * Several familiar locations labeled with their colloquial names, together with accompanying illustrations. Find the Seahorse Valley, and see visually why it's named that way.\n\n  * Hundreds of bulbs labeled by hand according to period numbers. Count to infinity by even numbers, count to infinity by odd numbers, or even find the Fibonacci sequence! It's all there in the period numbering.\n\n  * Hundreds of external angles labeled according to how far around the set you are in a counter-clockwise direction. This maps the border of the Mandelbrot set to a circle.\n\n  * Equipotential lines that show how fast points outside the Mandelbrot Set escape to infinity under iteration of the equation.\n\n  * Several high quality zoomed-in renderings, with detailed information describing how to find similar locations.\n\n  * Julia Medallions, the hidden treasures. Julia Sets are closely related fractals that use the same exact formula but in a slightly different way. Tiny Julia sets are contained within the border of the Mandelbrot set, and this poster shows you how to find them!\n\n  * A clear and practical description for how to use the formula that defines the Mandelbrot set.\n\n  * Sample orbit paths, making star shapes and spirals as the equation is iterated\n\n  * ... and much, much more!\n\n## Find out more\n\nLearn about the poster, the Mandelbrot set, and the designer who put it all\ntogether.\n\nLearn More \u2192\n\n## Buy Yours today\n\nGet yourself a copy of the Mandelmap and start exploring!\n\nBuy Poster \u2192\n\nHome\n\nAbout\n\nContact\n\ntavis@mandelmap.com\n\n", "frontpage": false}
