The assurances also state: \u201cA sentence\nof death will neither be sought nor imposed on Assange.\u201d\n\nIf Assange is denied permission to appeal, he faces being extradited to the US\nwithin days as he will have exhausted all of his legal avenues in the UK\ncourts. His only hope would then be if the European court of human rights\nintervened.\n\nStella Assange, his wife, tweeted: \u201cThe United States has issued a non-\nassurance in relation to the first amendment, and a standard assurance in\nrelation to the death penalty.\n\nBiden says he is \u2018considering\u2019 Australian call to drop Julian Assange charges\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cIt makes no undertaking to withdraw the prosecution\u2019s previous assertion that\nJulian has no first amendment rights because he is not a US citizen. Instead,\nthe US has limited itself to blatant weasel words claiming that Julian can\n\u2018seek to raise\u2019 the first amendment if extradited.\n\n\u201cThe diplomatic note does nothing to relieve our family\u2019s extreme distress\nabout his future \u2013 his grim expectation of spending the rest of his life in\nisolation in US prison for publishing award-winning journalism. The Biden\nadministration must drop this dangerous prosecution before it is too late.\u201d\n\nThe sides will argue over the worth of the assurances at a further high court\nhearing scheduled for 20 May. However, Assange\u2019s lawyers have previously\ndescribed US assurances given in other cases as \u201cnot worth the paper they\u2019re\nwritten on\u201d, echoing similar criticism from human rights group Amnesty\nInternational.\n\nOnly last week, when Joe Biden said he was considering a request from\nAustralia to drop charges against the WikiLeaks founder, Stella Assange said\nit was a \u201cgood sign\u201d.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the US Department of Justice.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Julian Assange\n  * WikiLeaks\n  * Extradition\n  * US justice system\n  * UK criminal justice\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
