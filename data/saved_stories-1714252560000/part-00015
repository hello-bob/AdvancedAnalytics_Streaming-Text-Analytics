Look at the evidence\n\nSteven J. Vaughan-Nichols\n\nSat 27 Apr 2024 // 11:30 UTC\n\nOpinion One of the knee-jerk arguments made by companies abandoning their open\nsource roots is that they can't make money because the bad hyper-cloud\ncompanies \"steal\" their open source services. True, at one time, the hyper-\nclouds took more than they gave. That's often no longer the case.\n\n## The battle between open source and 'sort of' open source is as old as\nsoftware\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), for example, is now one of PostgreSQL's biggest\nsupporters and a major Rust backer. Others always have been. For example,\nwithout Google, Kubernetes doesn't exist.\n\nWhile I was at Open Source Summit North America in Seattle, I was reminded of\nthis when, in a keynote, Sirish Chandrasekaran, GM of Amazon Relational\nDatabase Service (Amazon RDS), said: \"For the PostgreSQL core server, AWS\nemploys one core team member, six committers, and seven major contributors.\"\n\nI'm a cynic, so I responded, \"Really?\" Further, Chandrasekaran stated that for\nPostgreSQL 16, AWS programmers were the number one code reviewers and the\nnumber two feature contributors. OK, this needed to be checked.\n\nAs it so happens, I didn't need to dig too deeply. EnterpriseDB (EDB), the\ncompany that backs PostgreSQL, had already done much of the work for me. Marc\nLinster, EDB's Chief Technology Officer, analyzed who did what with PostgreSQL\n16 in great detail.\n\nAnd, there it is, in colorful circle graph detail: AWS is right behind EDB for\ncontributions to version 16 with 11.9 percent to EDB's 22.6 percent. Digging\ndeeper into the individual contributors, Robert Haas, EDB VP and Chief\nDatabase Scientist, provides us with a detailed list of the top PostgreSQL\ncontributors and patches.\n\nPut it all together, and what do you get? AWS is a major PostgreSQL\ncontributor. Why? Seriously? Why do you think? PostgreSQL is vital to AWS's\ncustomers, so keeping PostgreSQL alive, well, and growing is important to AWS.\n\nBeing a nosy guy - it comes with my job - I asked AWS director of Open Source\nStrategy David Nalley about AWS's open source plans. But before I jump into\nthat, does his name sound familiar to you? If you're deep into open source, it\nshould. He's also the president of a little group called The Apache\nFoundation.\n\nHe agreed with me about why AWS invests in open source, but added AWS isn't\nmerely contributing code; it is actively involved in the \"chop wood, carry\nwater\" tasks essential for maintaining project health, such as code review.\nThis isn't glamorous work, but it's a crucial part of software development.\n\nAWS hasn't always done this. Nalley sees this as part of AWS paying its open\nsource dues. \"AWS had to earn its spot in terms of building up its open source\nreputation.\"\n\nIt's not just PostgreSQL. Nalley also said, \"We have a number of other places\nwhere we're making material contributions. We're the third-leading contributor\nbehind MariaDB.\"\n\nAWS is also doing a lot of good work in Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter is a web-\nbased, open source interactive computing platform spun out of Python. Nalley\nsaid: \"We have an entire team of people that are focused on nothing but\nJupyter.\" One group is also working on slimming down Jupyter so it can work on\ncheaper laptops.\n\n  * Are you ready to back up your AI chatbot's promises? You'd better be\n  * Mozilla CEO quits, pushes pivot to data privacy champion... but what about Firefox?\n  * Bricking it: Do you actually own anything digital?\n  * Do we really need another non-open source available license?\n  * Soon the most popular 'real' desktop will be the Linux desktop\n\nHe continued that AWS isn't just developing the software; it's also reviewing\npatches submitted by other people. As someone who's worked in open source for\nmany years and from a holistic standpoint, having someone to make sure that\nthings are being reviewed for correctness is really, really compelling. \"We're\ndoing a lot of work in automated reasoning in formal verification.\"\n\nWhat's really got Nalley excited, though, is the work AWS is doing with Rust.\n\"We have an entire team of people whose only job, day in and day out, is\nimproving the Rust programming language. We think that memory safety\ncapabilities and performance improvements enable both our customers and us to\ndo things more securely and allow us both to do things faster. The performance\nimprovements just by adopting Rust for specific workloads that are in that\nsweet spot are incredibly compelling.\"\n\nIn particular, Nalley mentioned that the Rustls TLS library uses AWS Libcrypto\nfor Rust (aws-lc-rs) for cryptography by default, with the option to enable\nFederal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) support.\n\nThinking of security and Rust, Nalley added that he was a little frustrated at\nthe first Rust version of that master Linux administrator command sudo\n\"because it had a huge dependency tree initially, and I think that number was\nnorth of 50, (actually, it was a mind-boggling 135 dependencies), which means\nthe attack surface is 50 times larger. So AWS funded the workforce to fix the\ndependencies. They've done a lot of great work, and now it's down to three\ndependencies.\"\n\nThis, in turn, means sudo-rs is now available for such mainstream Linux\ndistros as Debian and Fedora,\n\nSo, the next time someone tells you that a hyper-cloud company is just an open\nsource leech, do yourself a favor and check into it. You may just find, as I\ndid, that the top cloud companies and open source are - in some cases -\nactually best buddies. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Open Source\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Open Source\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Audacity\n  * AWS\n  * Azure\n  * Cloud native\n  * Content delivery network\n  * Digital Ocean\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * EC2\n  * Edge Computing\n  * FinOps\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * G Suite\n  * Hybrid Cloud\n  * IaaS\n  * iCloud\n  * Jenkins\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Multicloud\n  * MySQL\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Paas\n  * Private Cloud\n  * Public Cloud\n  * Serverless\n  * Systems Approach\n  * Virtualization\n  * vSphere\n  * Wikipedia\n\n#### More about\n\n1 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Open Source\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Open Source\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Audacity\n  * AWS\n  * Azure\n  * Cloud native\n  * Content delivery network\n  * Digital Ocean\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * EC2\n  * Edge Computing\n  * FinOps\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * G Suite\n  * Hybrid Cloud\n  * IaaS\n  * iCloud\n  * Jenkins\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Multicloud\n  * MySQL\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Paas\n  * Private Cloud\n  * Public Cloud\n  * Serverless\n  * Systems Approach\n  * Virtualization\n  * vSphere\n  * Wikipedia\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Linux Foundation is leading fight against fauxpen source\n\nOpinion Shifts its transmission from vendor neutral into open source gear\n\nApplications15 days | 37\n\n#### Open sourcerers say suspected xz-style attacks continue to target\nmaintainers\n\nSocial engineering patterns spotted across range of popular projects\n\nSecurity11 days | 29\n\n#### Valkey publishes release candidate and attracts new backer\n\nOpen source Redis alternative gathers momentum\n\nDatabases9 days | 5\n\n#### Easing the cloud migration journey\n\nHuawei\u2019s Net5.5G converged IP network can improve cloud performance,\nreliability and security, says the company\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Microsoft dusts off ancient MS-DOS 4.0 code for release on GitHub\n\nNobody's favorite operating system is now available for inspection\n\nOffbeat20 hrs | 42\n\n#### Big Cloud is still making bank \u2013 Is this AI adoption, price rises, or\nwhat?\n\nKettle Shareholders are loving it.
