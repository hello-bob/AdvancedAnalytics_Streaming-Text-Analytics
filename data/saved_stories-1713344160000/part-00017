And since a few more important bug\nfixes were merged in the meantime, I decided to do a final batch of cherry-\npicks and thus a third release candidate to validate them.\n\nThese builds should be exactly what the stable release would be, so please\ngive them a try with your current projects (and maybe give 4.2.2 RC 3 a spin\nduring this weekend\u2019s Ludum Dare 55 ;)). I won\u2019t wait too long this time to\nrelease the stable builds, so I need any potential regression to be reported\nin the coming days.\n\nMaintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend\nto always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to\npreserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.\n\nJump to the Downloads section, and give the new releases a spin right now, or\ncontinue reading to learn more about improvements. You can also try the Web\neditor (4.1.4 RC 3, 4.2.2 RC 3) or the Android editor for this release. If you\nare interested in the latter, please request to join our testing group to get\naccess to pre-release builds.\n\nThe illustration picture for this article comes from Sunken Shadows, a retro\nFPS roguelike set under the sea, developed in Godot 4.2 by Sunrise Glitch\nGames. You can wishlist the game on Steam, play the latest demo on itch.io,\nand join the developers\u2019 community on Discord for more development news.\n\n## Highlights of 4.1.4 RC 3\n\n20 contributors submitted around 32 improvements for this release.
