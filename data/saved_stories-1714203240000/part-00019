That demo was magical and since then I have given\nVR demos to hundreds of people using many different headsets. Eight years into\nmy VR evangelism, I continue with Apple Vision Pro and here is my script for\nthe perfect demo...\n\n## Preparation\n\nThe usual demo I give is always one-on-one with the person and it takes about\n30 minutes. This way I can give the person 100% of my attention and we can\ncover everything important without rushing through the experience. The ideal\nplace is a well-lit room with a couch, and the person is sitting on my left\nside. I always go into the demo with full battery and headset freshly rebooted\nby reattaching the cable. When the headset is ready I make sure that my iPhone\nand headset are connected to the same network and that the Internet works.\nAfter this, I initiate the Guest Mode with view mirroring to iPhone (sound\nstays on headset) and all allowed apps and data. Then I put down the headset\nand clean lenses, front panel and bottom cameras with the polishing cloth.\n\n## Fitting\n\nThe last thing I mention before the headset leaves my hands is that the Light\nSeal (21W) is magnetically attached and the person should not hold the headset\nby it. I turn the knob of a Solo Knit Band all the way to loosen it as much as\npossible and give the headset to the person. People usually slide down the\nback of the strap way too much, so I always tell them that having it slightly\nhigher is better. With a slight tap on the knob I let them know where they can\ntighten the fit to their liking. Now, people usually acknowledge how heavy the\nheadset is. I tell them they are right, and that the right-sized Light Seal\nplays crucial role for comfort. I also mention that for longer sessions I use\nDual Loop Band that alleviates front-heavy pressure.\n\n## Calibration\n\nEye and hand calibration process is straight-forward, but some people may\nstruggle with it, so I always narrate what they are seeing and explain what is\nhappening and what should they do. There are two important things that they\nneed to understand. First, where the Digital Crown is, and second, how to do\ngood pinch gesture. Second is much harder. At the end of the calibration\nprocess, it is good to sum up with note that \u201eYou just look at a button and\npinch your fingers together to click it. You can rest your hands in your lap.\u201c\nThere is an annoying Safety Dialog where they can immediately try it out.\n\n## Photos\n\nApp grid is automatically presented, but it is a good thing to teach the\nperson that you can get (rid of) the app grid by pressing the crown. The first\napp that I tell them to open is Photos. Within Photos, they learn basic\ngestures like scrolling, pinch to zoom, resizing a window, dragging a window,\nclosing a window, etc. I always make sure that they see all my photos in a\nzoomed out grid and scroll through it, showing thousands of little pictures\nflying by. Then I encourage them to stand up, take the battery and put it in\npocket, and walk around the window and examine it from a close up. Even taking\nthe window and walking with it. After this, when they are seated, I tell them\nto see Spatial Videos \u2013 I have a few where I pet my dog. They are mostly\nstatic, the depth effect is just right, and everybody loves dogs, so they are\ngreat choice. Then I send them to see many different Panoramas where they can\nexperience immersion and won\u2019t see their surrounding. Which is a good segue to\nthe next part \u2013 Environments.\n\n## Environments\n\nI explain Environments as visual noise canceling combined with a background.\nMany people want to see all options and just to look around, but some are not\nthat taken away, so often times, I tell the person to open Safari and browse\ntheir favorite sites in multiple floating windows while sitting on top of\nHaleakal\u0101, or near lake in Mount Hood. Throw in some Beautiful Things to spice\nup the experience. I always show them the Breakthrough function. We continue\nin the demo with environment turned off and all windows closed.\n\n## Dinosaurs\n\nEncounter Dinosaurs is a beautiful example of interactive media \u2014 not a movie,\nnot a game \u2014 something in between. The animals react to the person, and every\nperson reacts differently to every moment. Some physically feel the butterfly\non their hand, some would pet the small dino and call it a day, some freeze\nwhen large dino head-locks onto them, some are terrified of petting the large\none, and the situations go on and on. For many people, this is the peak of the\ndemo and I totally understand. It is also my favorite moment when giving the\ndemo \u2013 seeing people being genuinely curious showing their inner child and\nseeing their wonder always makes me happy. As the portal closes, the demo\nreaches its grand finale.\n\n## Immersive\n\nDue to copyright protection, you can\u2019t mirror the view onto iPhone and watch\ncopyrighted material, so I always end the demo in the TV app. I navigate the\nperson to play the Experience Immersive trailer and then turn off the\nmirroring. What follows is a lot of wows, gasps and smiles. When the video\nends, the scripted demo is over, they put down the headset and we chat a\nlittle bit about what they think.\n\n## Encore\n\nIf there is time and interest, for example with regular VR users or extremely\ncurious people, we continue with the demo. Without putting it down because\nthen they would have to do calibration again. And of course, only after we\nsomehow reenable the mirroring to my phone. I intentionally won\u2019t mention any\nother apps and experiences as the exploration and enjoyment heavily depends on\nthe person and their interests.\n\nI hope this script helps you to give a great demo. If you have any questions\nor suggestions, feel free to reach out to me \u2013 @milanlajtos.\n\nHaving a great day?\n\nBuy Me A Donut \ud83c\udf69\n\n", "frontpage": false}
