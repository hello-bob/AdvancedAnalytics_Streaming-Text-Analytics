The recording also purported to capture the principal\ndisparaging Jewish individuals and two teachers who \u201cshould never have been\nhired\u201d.\n\nThe audio clip quickly spread on social media and had \u201cprofound\nrepercussions\u201d, the court documents stated, with the principal being placed on\nleave.\n\nThe recording also triggered a wave of hate-filled messages on social media\nand an inundation of phone calls to the high school\u2019s front office, police\nsaid.

Authorities said Thursday that he is being held in a\nlocal jail on $5,000 bond.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Maryland\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
