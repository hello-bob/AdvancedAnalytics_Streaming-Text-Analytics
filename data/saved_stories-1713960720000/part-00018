Journal of Geophysical Research, CC BY-SA\n\nThis ice flow is slowed down by the Ross Ice Shelf, a floating mass of ice\nnearly the size of Spain, which holds back the land-based ice. Compared to\nother ice shelves in West Antarctica, the Ross Ice Shelf has little melting at\nits base because the ocean below it is very cold.\n\nAlthough this region has been stable during the past few decades, recent\nresearch suggest this was not always the case. Radiocarbon dating of sediments\nfrom beneath the ice sheet tells us that it retreated hundreds of kilometres\nsome 7,000 years ago, and then advanced again to its present position within\nthe last 2,000 years.\n\nFiguring out why this happened can help us better predict how the ice sheet\nwill change in the future. In our new research, we test two main hypotheses.\n\nRead more: What an ocean hidden under Antarctic ice reveals about our planet's\nfuture climate\n\n## Testing scenarios\n\nScientists have considered two possible explanations for this past ice sheet\nretreat and advance. The first is related to Earth\u2019s crust below the ice\nsheet.\n\nAs an ice sheet shrinks, the change in ice mass causes the Earth\u2019s crust to\nslowly uplift in response. At the same time, and counterintuitively, the sea\nlevel drops near the ice because of a weakening of the gravitational\nattraction between the ice sheet and the ocean water.\n\nAs the ice sheet thinned and retreated since the last ice age, crustal uplift\nand the fall in sea level in the region may have re-grounded floating ice,\ncausing ice sheet advance.\n\nEarth\u2019s crust uplifts and sea level drops near the ice sheet as it loses mass.\nAGU, CC BY-SA\n\nThe other hypothesis is that the ice sheet behaviour may be due to changes in\nthe ocean. When the surface of the ocean freezes, forming sea ice, it expels\nsalt into the water layers below. This cold briny water is heavier and mixes\ndeep into the ocean, including under the Ross Ice Shelf. This blocks warm\nocean currents from melting the ice.\n\nTop: Cold dense shelf water blocks warm circumpolar deep water from melting\nthe ice. Bottom: Warm circumpolar deep water flows under the ice shelf,\ncausing ice melting and retreat. AGU, CC BY-SA\n\nSeafloor sediments and ice cores tell us that this deep mixing was weaker in\nthe past when the ice sheet was retreating. This means that warm ocean\ncurrents may have flowed underneath the ice shelf and melted the ice. Mixing\nincreased when the ice sheet was advancing.\n\nWe test these two ideas with computer model simulations of ice sheet flow and\nEarth\u2019s crustal and sea surface responses to changes in the ice sheet with\nvarying ocean temperature.\n\nBecause the rate of crustal uplift depends on the viscosity (stickiness) of\nthe underlying mantle, we ran simulations within ranges estimated for West\nAntarctica. A stickier mantle means slower crustal uplift as the ice sheet\nthins.\n\nThe simulations that best matched geological records had a stickier mantle and\na warmer ocean as the ice sheet retreated. In these simulations, the ice sheet\nretreats more quickly as the ocean warms.\n\nWhen the ocean cools, the simulated ice sheet readvances to its present-day\nposition. This means that changes in ocean temperature best explain the past\nice sheet behaviour, but the rate of crustal uplift also affects how sensitive\nthe ice sheet is to the ocean.\n\nChanges in ocean temperature best explain the retreat of West Antarctica\u2019s ice\nsheet in the past.

This could lead to the same cold-to-warm\nocean switch that caused extensive ice sheet retreat thousands of years ago.\n\nFor West Antarctica\u2019s Siple Coast, it is better if we prevent this ocean\nwarming from occurring in the first place, which is still possible if we\nchoose a low-emissions future.\n\n  * New Zealand stories\n  * West Antarctic ice sheet\n  * Ross Ice Shelf\n  * Glacial retreat\n  * Warming ocean\n  * Antarctic sea ice\n  * Science + Environment\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Project Offier - Diversity & Inclusion\n\n  * ##### Senior Lecturer - Earth System Science\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
