Consider the simplified problems where you need to break the string\ninto segments of (say) 72 characters. It is a relevant problem if your string\nis a base64 string.\n\nThe problem could be a bit complicated because you might need consider the\nsyntax. So the speed of breaking into a new line every 72 characters\nirrespective of the content provides an upper bound on the performance of\nbreaking content into lines.\n\nThe most obvious algorithm could be to copy the content, line by line:\n\n    \n    \n    void break_lines(char *out, const char *in, size_t length, size_t line_length) { size_t j = 0; size_t i = 0; for (; i + line_length <= length; i += line_length) { memcpy(out + j, in + i, line_length); out[j+line_length] = '\\n'; j += line_length + 1; } if (i < length) { memcpy(out + j, in + i, length - i); } }\n\nCopying data in blocks in usually quite fast unless you are unlucky and you\ntrigger aliasing. However, allocating a whole new buffer could be wasteful,\nespecially if you only need to extend the current buffer by a few bytes.\n\nA better option could thus be to do the work in-place. The difficulty is that\nif you load the data from the current array, and then write it a bit further\naway, you might be overwriting the data you need to load next. A solution is\nto proceed in reverse: start from the end... move what would be the last line\noff by a few bytes, then move the second last line and so forth. Your code\nmight look like the following C function:\n\n    \n    \n    void break_lines_inplace(char *in, size_t length, size_t line_length) { size_t left = length % line_length; size_t i = length - left; size_t j = length + length / line_length - left; memmove(in + j, in + i, left); while (i >= line_length) { i -= line_length; j -= line_length + 1; memmove(in + j, in + i, line_length); in[j+line_length] = '\\n'; } }\n\nI wrote a benchmark. I report the results only for a 64KB input. Importantly,\nmy numbers do not include memory allocation which is separate. Your results\nwill vary, but here are my own results:\n\nmethod| Intel Ice Lake, GCC 12| Apple M2, LLVM 14  \n---|---|---  \nmemcpy| 43 GB/s| 70 GB/s  \ncopy| 24 GB/s| 40 GB/s  \nin-place| 25 GB/s| 38 GB/s  \n  \nIn my case, it does not matter whether we do the computation in-place or not.\nThe in-place approach generates more instructions but we are not limited by\nthe number of instructions.\n\nRoughly speaking, I achieve a bit more than half the speed as that of a memory\ncopy. We might be limited by the number of loads and stores. There might be a\nclever way to close the gap.\n\nDaniel Lemire, \"How quickly can you break a long string into lines?,\" in\nDaniel Lemire's blog, April 19, 2024.\n\n## Published by\n\n### Daniel Lemire\n\nA computer science professor at the University of Quebec (TELUQ).
