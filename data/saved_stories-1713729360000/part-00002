Your sleep\nposition can either help or hinder that process, depending on how effectively\nit supports the natural curvature of your spine. It\u2019s also common for people\nto wake up with brand new aches and pains in the morning, sometimes due to\nsleep position.\n\nWe spend a third of our lives asleep or resting, so it\u2019s important to choose a\nsleep position that assists your body with physical recovery. A proper sleep\nposition can relieve stress on your spine, while an unhealthy position can\nincrease pain or stiffness in the back, arms, or shoulders, all while\ncontributing to lower-quality sleep.\n\n## What Is the Best Sleeping Position?\n\nThe best sleep position is one that promotes healthy spinal alignment Trusted\nSource National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center\nfor Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access\nto biomedical and genomic information. View Source from your hips all the way\nto your head. What that looks like for you depends on your personal health\nsituation and what you find comfortable.\n\nHaving said that, there are some positions that are considered healthier than\nothers. Specifically, sleeping on the side or back is considered more\nbeneficial than sleeping on the stomach. In either of these sleep positions,\nit\u2019s easier to keep your spine supported and balanced, which relieves pressure\non the spine and enables your muscles to relax and recover.\n\nDifferent sleep positions provide different benefits that may be helpful for\nyou if you\u2019re dealing with back pain or a health condition. In these cases, it\nmay be worth trying a new sleep position to enable more restful sleep. In one\nstudy, a group of adults with back pain were trained to sleep on their back or\ntheir side. They experienced significant pain relief in just four weeks.\n\nAdjusting to a new sleep position takes time. However, if sleeping on your\nstomach feels good to you, don\u2019t feel forced to change it. You can minimize\nyour risk of pain and improve spinal alignment with the right mattress and\npillow.\n\n## Sleeping on Your Side\n\nMore than 60% of people sleep on their side, with men spending more time on\ntheir sides Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information\nThe National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health\nby providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source each\nnight than women. As children, we split our nights by sleeping in all\npositions equally, but by adulthood, a clear preference for side sleeping\nemerges. The flexibility of our spine decreases as we age, which may make the\nside sleeping position more comfortable for older adults.\n\nSleeping on your side offers several benefits. It promotes healthy spinal\nalignment and is the sleep position least likely to result in back pain,\nespecially when supported with pillows. Side sleeping also may reduce\nheartburn Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The\nNational Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by\nproviding access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source and\nsnoring Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The\nNational Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by\nproviding access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source , making\nit particularly beneficial for:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * People with acid reflux\n  * People with back pain\n  * People who snore or have sleep apnea\n  * Older people\n\n### Best Sleeping Position for Pregnancy\n\nExperts recommend that those who are pregnant sleep on their side with the\nknees bent Trusted Source Medline Plus MedlinePlus is an online health\ninformation resource for patients and their families and friends. View Source\n. The side sleeping position relieves the pressure of a growing belly,\nenabling the heart to pump and blood to flow easily throughout the body. In\nparticular, the left side is recommended because it prevents pressure on the\nliver and facilitates healthy blood flow to the fetus, uterus, kidneys, and\nheart.\n\nIf you feel discomfort sleeping on your left side during pregnancy, you can\nswitch to the right side now and then to relieve pressure on the left hip. You\ncan also relieve tension by placing pillows under the belly, between the legs,\nand at the small of the back.\n\n### Best Sleeping Position for Back Pain\n\nThe best sleeping position for is on your side with a pillow or blanket\nbetween the knees. Side sleeping can also relieve symptoms for those with neck\nor back pain.\n\nChoose a pillow with a loft, or thickness, that matches the distance between\nyour neck and your shoulder. With a thicker pillow, your neck will stay\naligned with your spine as you sleep on your side, preventing pain and\nsoreness while maintaining proper alignment.\n\n### Are There Any Drawbacks To Sleeping on Your Side?\n\nThe side sleeping position is not recommended for people with shoulder pain or\npeople worried about wrinkles.\n\nSide sleeping can lead to soreness or tightness in your shoulders Trusted\nSource National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center\nfor Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access\nto biomedical and genomic information. View Source , so it\u2019s good to shift\npositions occasionally and use the most appropriate pillow and mattress.\nEnsure your mattress has enough \u201cgive\u201d to allow your hips and shoulders to\nsink in deeper than your middle spine.\n\nSide sleeping can also contribute to facial wrinkles Trusted Source National\nLibrary of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and\ngenomic information. View Source , since your face is pressed against the\npillow, stretching and compressing the skin.\n\n### Is One Side Better Than the Other?\n\nIf you\u2019re already a side sleeper and want to go for that gold star, opt to\nsleep on your left instead of your right side. Sleeping on the right may\nincrease pressure on your internal organs, which is why experts recommend the\nleft for pregnant women and sleepers with acid reflux or gastroesophageal\nreflux disease (GERD). Sleeping on the right can also intensify symptoms of\nheartburn.\n\nSleeping in a way that\u2019s less symmetrical can increase your risk of pain\nsymptoms upon waking up, so use pillows to achieve a side sleeping position\nthat aligns your spine from hips to your head. Put pillows on either side of\nyour body to keep yourself in place, and place a small pillow between the\nknees to even out the hips.\n\n## Sleeping on Your Back\n\nLying on the back is the second most popular sleep position, with plenty of\nbenefits to rival the side sleeping position. When you\u2019re flat on your back,\nit\u2019s easy to keep your spine in alignment and to evenly distribute your body\nweight, preventing any potential aches in the neck or back. Sleeping on the\nback can also relieve the congestion of a stuffy nose or allergies, so long as\nyou prop yourself up into an upright position.\n\nYour skin also benefits from the back sleeping position. Since you\u2019re facing\nupward, there is no pillow or mattress pressing against your face and\ncontributing to wrinkles. Back sleeping may be particularly beneficial for:\n\n  * People with lumbar spinal pain\n  * People worried about wrinkles\n  * People with neck pain\n  * People with nasal congestion\n\n### Best Sleeping Position for Neck Pain\n\nLying on the back is the best sleep position for neck pain, as it prevents the\nmisalignment Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information\nThe National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health\nby providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source that\ncan occur in the side or stomach positions. To prevent neck pain, use a pillow\nthat supports the neck while letting your head sink deeper. Memory foam\npillows or pillows with a divot for the head are good options. Alternately,\nyou can roll a towel underneath your neck and use a flatter pillow for your\nhead.\n\nWhen sleeping on your back, aim to keep your arms in similar positions. For\nexample, having them both lie by your sides is preferable to having one rested\non your forehead, as that causes unevenness in the spine that can contribute\nto shoulder or neck pain.\n\n### Best Sleeping Position for Stuffy Nose\n\nIf you\u2019re coping with allergies or a stuffy nose, use pillows to prop up your\nupper back so you\u2019re in more of an upright position, without collapsing the\nspine. This positioning can enable your airways to stay open and may help\ndrain your nose. Avoid lying flat on your back, as that may increase nasal\ncongestion Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information\nThe National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health\nby providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source .\n\n### Are There Any Drawbacks To Sleeping on Your Back?\n\nThe back sleeping position is not recommended for:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * People who snore or have sleep apnea\n  * People with some types of back pain\n  * People with GERD or acid reflux\n  * Heavier adults\n  * Older adults\n\nBack sleeping is the worst sleeping position for people with snoring and sleep\napnea because it leaves you susceptible to airway collapse. More than half of\npeople have position-dependent sleep apnea, meaning that the severity of their\nsymptoms increases when they lie on their back. Especially as we grow older or\nheavier, it becomes harder to breathe while lying on our backs, due to the\npressure of gravity on the body.\n\nAlso, while some people feel relief from the back sleeping position, others\nfind it increases their back pain. Depending on the firmness of your mattress,\na small gap can form between your lower back and the mattress surface, which\ncan lead to uncomfortable tension in the lower back. You can resolve this by\nplacing a thin pillow in that area, or placing a pillow under your knees\ninstead. Either way, you\u2019ll relieve pressure while supporting the natural\ncurvature of your spine. You can also switch between back and side sleeping\nthroughout the night.\n\nThe back sleeping position is not recommended for pregnant women because a\ngrowing baby can add pressure on the heart and make it difficult for blood to\nflow easily. Theoretical postulation may suggest Trusted Source National\nLibrary of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and\ngenomic information. View Source that sleeping on the back during the third\ntrimester can increase the risk of stillbirth, though conclusive evidence is\nlacking.\n\n## Sleeping on Your Stomach\n\nThe stomach is the least popular sleep position. Research suggests we spend\nless than 10% of our night sleeping in this position. Stomach sleeping does\nhave some benefits, however. Namely, the stomach sleeping position can help\nrelieve snoring, by opening up your airway. However, your ribs do have to work\nagainst gravity in order to breathe in this position, which may force you to\nuse more energy and thereby make your sleep less restful.\n\n### What\u2019s Wrong With Stomach Sleeping?\n\nThe stomach sleeping position comes with several drawbacks and is not\nrecommended for most people. In particular, the following people should avoid\nsleeping on their stomachs:\n\n  * Pregnant women\n  * People with neck or back pain\n  * People worried about wrinkles\n\nThe stomach position provides the least back support of all sleeping positions\nand increases pressure on the spine, sometimes causing pain upon waking up. In\norder to sleep on your stomach, you must sleep with your head facing one side,\ninvariably twisting your neck and head out of alignment with the rest of your\nspine. If your mattress isn\u2019t firm enough, your stomach and hips will sink\ninto the mattress, uncomfortably stretching your spine out of alignment. This\nkind of asymmetrical sleep posture can negatively impact your spine over time.\nAlso, sleeping on the stomach can contribute to facial wrinkles, since your\nface is pressed against the pillow or the surface of the mattress.\n\n### How to Sleep Better on Your Stomach\n\nWithout the right pillow and mattress, it\u2019s easy for the stomach sleeping\nposition to cause aches and pains. However, it is possible to sleep well in\nthis position. If you enjoy sleeping on your stomach, try doing so with a very\nthin pillow, or no pillow at all. This way, you can avoid tilting your neck\nback and up, creating further spinal misalignment and discomfort. Place a thin\npillow under your hips to further even out the spine and relieve pressure. A\nfirm mattress can also prevent some of the spinal alignment issues that come\nfrom sleeping on your stomach.\n\nThe best sleep position for you is whichever sleep position enables you to\nenjoy a restful night of uninterrupted sleep and wake up in the morning\nfeeling refreshed, without any aches and pains. If that describes your current\nsleep position, don\u2019t feel forced to change it. If you think a new position\nmight make sleep more comfortable for you, though, go ahead and try another\nposition. Be patient and use the strategies named to help yourself adjust to\nthe new position.\n\nYour sleep position plays a pivotal role in the quality of your sleep.\nChanging it up is just one of many strategies you can try for better sleep.\n\nRelated News\n\n  * Sleep Deprivation Can Take a Big Toll on Your Heart and Brain\n  * Can New Weight Loss Drugs Improve Sleep?\n  * Pandemic Effects on Sleep, Immunity, Mood, Cognition, and Quality of Life\n  * Study: Physical Activity Alters Sleep Architecture and Emotional Wellbeing\n\n### About Our Editorial Team\n\nWritten By\n\n### Eric Suni, Staff Writer\n\nEric Suni has over a decade of experience as a science writer and was\npreviously an information specialist for the National Cancer Institute.\n\nMedically Reviewed by\n\n### Dr. Abhinav Singh, Sleep Medicine Physician MD\n\nDr. Singh is the Medical Director of the Indiana Sleep Center.
