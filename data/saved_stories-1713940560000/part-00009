Litt\n\nMeet The Authors\n\nPublished by The Lawfare Institute in Cooperation With\n\nSubscribe to Lawfare\n\nThe Department of Commerce recently issued proposed regulations intended to\n\u201caddress the national emergency with respect to significant malicious cyber-\nenabled activities.\u201d Propounded pursuant to Executive Orders 13984 and 14110,\nthe proposed regulations impose wide-ranging \u201cknow your customer\u201d requirements\non providers of Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) to identify and gather\ninformation about foreign customers. One aspect of the proposed regulation\nraises a legal concern that it does not address.\n\nThe proposed regulation defines IAAS as \u201ca product or service offered to a\nconsumer ... that provides processing, storage, networks, or other fundamental\ncomputing resources, and with which the consumer is able to deploy and run\nsoftware that is not predefined, including operating systems and\napplications.\u201d The proposed regulation requires IAAS providers to identify\nwhich of its customers are foreign, and collect, verify, and retain\nidentifying information from those customers.\n\nAs directed by Section 4.2(c)(i) of Executive Order 14110, the regulation also\nimposes reporting requirements on IAAS providers when they become aware of\n\u201c[a] transaction by, for, or on behalf of a foreign person which results or\ncould result in the training of a large AI [artificial intelligence] model\nwith potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled\nactivity.\u201d The provider is required to report to the Commerce Department\ninformation including the identity and address of the foreign person, the\nmeans of payment, telephone and email contact information, and information\nabout the AI training run. This information must be reported within 15 days\nafter the provider learns of the transaction.\n\nOn its face, this requirement appears to conflict with federal statutory law,\nnamely the Stored Communications Act (SCA). Congress enacted the SCA in 1986\nto establish privacy protections for customer and user information held by\nproviders of electronic communications services (ECS) and remote computing\nservice (RCS), and to encourage development of new and innovative forms of\ncomputer technology. Among the protections provided by the SCA, the law\nprohibits ECS and RCS providers from disclosing to the government information\npertaining to their customers without lawful process (such as a subpoena,\ncourt order, or search warrant), the consent of the customer, or in certain\nother narrowly defined circumstances\u2014such as to prevent imminent loss of life\nor serious physical injury, a provision added by Congress after the Sept. 11\nattacks.\n\nThe conflict arises because the SCA defines RCS as \u201cthe provision to the\npublic of computer storage or processing services by means of an electronic\ncommunications system.\u201d The definition of IAAS in the proposed regulation\n(providing \u201cprocessing [or] storage\u201d) very closely matches the definition of\nRCS in the SCA (providing \u201ccomputer storage or processing services\u201d). Thus,\nIAAS providers appear to be prohibited by statute from providing to the\ngovernment the very information about foreign customers modeling AI that the\nproposed regulation requires them to provide.\n\nNeither regulations nor an executive order, of course, can supersede a\nstatute. The regulations and Executive Order 14110 are based on authorities\ngranted to the president under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act\n(IEEPA). Under ordinary principles of statutory construction, however, the\ngeneral provisions of this 1970s-era law do not override the specific and\nsubsequent provisions of the SCA. Congress could have\u2014but did not\u2014provide an\nexception in the SCA for a presidentially declared emergency.\n\nThe Commerce Department may have an explanation for how the proposed\nrequirement can be harmonized with the apparently contrary statutory\nprovision, but nothing in the proposed regulation or its accompanying\nexplanatory material even acknowledges this issue, much less resolves it. In\nany event, the apparent conflict between the proposed reporting requirement\nand the prohibitions of the SCA must be addressed.\n\nTopics:\n\nCongress Cybersecurity & Tech\n\nBack to Top\n\n### Richard Salgado\n\nRead More\n\nRichard Salgado was Google\u2019s Director of Law Enforcement and Information\nSecurity for 13 years, and a federal prosecutor before that.
