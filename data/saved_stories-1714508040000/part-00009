Moments Ago\n\nMacKenzie Sigalos@KENZIESIGALOS\n\nRyan Browne@Ryan_Browne_\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * In a Seattle court on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Jones will deliver a sentence to Binance founder and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao.\n  * In November, Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down from his role as CEO of the crypto exchange.\n  * For months, Judge Jones has been weighing the appropriate punishment for Zhao.\n\nZhao Changpeng, founder and chief executive officer of Binance, attends a\nconference at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France June 16,\n2022.\n\nBenoit Tessier | Reuters\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of crypto exchange Binance, heads\nto a Seattle courtroom on Tuesday to learn whether the crimes he admitted to\ncommitting will land him in prison for an extended sentence.\n\nIn November, Zhao pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering at Binance. As\npart of his plea deal with the Department of Justice, Zhao agreed to step down\nas CEO. For months, U.S. District Judge Richard Jones has been weighing the\nappropriate punishment for Zhao, also known as CZ.\n\nOnce a titan of the crypto sector, Zhao grew Binance into the world's largest\ncentralized crypto exchange globally. The company held assets of more than $65\nbillion by the time he stepped down. Unlike rival exchange FTX, which\ncollapsed into bankruptcy when founder Sam Bankman-Fried was criminally\ncharged, Binance has continued to operate.\n\nAssets on the Binance platform totaled more than $122 billion, according to\nblockchain data firm Nansen, a roughly 88% jump that follows a sharp increase\nin crypto prices in recent months.\n\nProsecutors say Zhao violated U.S. law on an \"unprecedented scale,\" according\nto their sentencing memorandum to the court, and that he showed a \"deliberate\ndisregard\" for Binance's legal responsibilities, operating the exchange on a\n\"Wild West\" model.\n\nZhao is accused of willfully failing to implement an effective anti-money\nlaundering (AML) program as required by the Bank Secrecy Act, and of allowing\nBinance to process transactions involving proceeds of unlawful activity,\nincluding between Americans and individuals in sanctioned jurisdictions.\n\nBinance processed a whopping $18.1 trillion worth of trading volume in 2023,\naccording to data from CCData, a crypto market data firm.\n\nAround 80% \u2014 or $14.4 trillion \u2014 of that came from derivatives products like\nfutures contracts, while the remaining $3.7 trillion came from spot trading.\nDerivatives trading is a key part of Binance's business.\n\nBut Binance has seen its market share drop in the last few months.\n\nThe company's total dominance of crypto trading currently stands at 41.6%,\naccording to CCData \u2014 that's down 1.42 percentage points since CZ stepped down\nas CEO in November 2023.\n\nZhao has agreed to pay a $50 million fine in addition to the $4.3 billion in\nfines and forfeiture that Binance was ordered to pay for violating the U.S.\nBank Secrecy Act and sanctions on Iran. The action was a joint effort by the\nJustice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury\nDepartment, while the SEC, which brought its own suit against the exchange,\nwas notably absent.\n\nThe government is asking for a sentence of three years, double the high end of\nthe guidelines range to \"reflect the gravity of his crimes,\" the prosecutors'\nmemo says.\n\nZhao's lawyers have asked for five months' probation. They say Zhao has\naccepted responsibility for dodging AML requirements, and that he has a\nhistory of philanthropy and community service. Additionally, he's already\nspent more than five months in the U.S., away from family, since pleading\nguilty.\n\nMore than 160 of Zhao's supporters, including family members, Binance\ncustomers, and Emirati royalty, have written notes to the court to appeal for\nmercy.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:5702:57\n\nNew Binance CEO: Building a robust compliance program after an immature past\n\nSquawk on the Street\n\n## Prison time likely\n\nMost experts who spoke to CNBC about the upcoming sentencing predict Zhao will\nspend some time behind bars.\n\n\"This is a high-profile case and the judge will feel pressure not to be soft\nduring sentencing,\" Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told CNBC. He\nexpects a sentence of a year or two.\n\nBraden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the CFTC, said federal\nsentencing guidelines provide a framework but allow judges some discretion.\n\n\"For CZ, a first-time nonviolent offender, the sentencing guidelines call for\nan advisory range of 10 to 16 months,\" said Perry, currently a partner at law\nfirm Kennyhertz Perry.\n\nWorking in Zhao's favor, Perry said, is that the defendant never went to\ntrial, saving judicial and prosecutorial resources, and that he accepted\nresponsibility and settled with multiple agencies, all concessions that might\ninfluence the judge's decision.\n\n\"I believe the judge will acknowledge the vast scale of potential suspicious\ntransactions and the prior lax AML program but recognize the efforts and\nremediation taken,\" Perry said. \"Taking into account all the factors, I\npredict a guideline sentence with a term of incarceration. This will deter yet\naccount for the guilty plea and all other factors used in the sentencing\ndecision.\"\n\nYesha Yadav, law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University, is\nlooking for the judge to impose a sentence \"in the low single digits \u2013 perhaps\nthree years.\" However, that could include minimal time in prison and the rest\non probation.\n\nYadav suggested that Zhao will benefit from Binance's contrast to FTX, which\nwas \"revealed to have been a criminal enterprise.\"\n\n\"While Binance has been convicted of extremely serious charges, it still\nremains an operational, albeit weakened, business that continues to attract\ncustomers and is looking to revive its fortunes by focusing on compliance\nunder a monitorship regime,\" Yadav said.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Paul Tuchmann also expects some prison time due to\nthe failure to implement AML requirements, as well as the volume of funds that\nflowed through Binance without being subject to such controls.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:5702:57\n\nSEC crackdown concerns hit crypto investor enthusiasm\n\nWorldwide Exchange\n\n\"While he is a first-time offender, those factors I just mentioned are likely\nto outweigh the lack of criminal history,\" Tuchmann said. \"The need for\ngeneral deterrence in the crypto industry, and the financial sector generally,\nis so great, that I assume that DOJ will take the position, and a judge will\nlikely agree, that a message needs to be sent through this sentence that the\nconsequences for violating these rules can't just be seen as a cost of doing\nbusiness.\"\n\nLos Angeles corporate law attorney Tre Lovell said a shorter sentence, in the\nrange of five to seven months, is likely, along with extended probation.\n\nLovell added that, unlike Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of fraud and\nsentenced to 25 years in prison, Zhao hasn't been charged with fraud or other\ncrimes deserving of a longer sentence.\n\n\"In addition, his letter to the judge does reflect remorse, discusses his\nmaking of poor decisions, and indicates that the Binance platform has\ninstituted strict anti-money laundering controls at his direction,\" Lovell\nsaid.\n\nDavid Weinstein, a former federal and state prosecutor who now practices as a\ncorporate compliance and white collar defense attorney at Jones Walker, said\nprison sentences represent an important deterrent.\n\n\"I think the sentence will end up just under a year,\" he said.\n\nWATCH: Bankman-Fried sentencing\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:1102:11\n\nSam Bankman-Fried faces up to 50 years in prison at sentencing hearing\n\nWorldwide Exchange\n\n## More In Crypto World\n\nwatch now\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO10:22\n\nBitcoin and ether drop as investors question the U.S. economy's strength: CNBC\nCrypto World\n\nJordan Smith\n\nwatch now\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO10:44\n\nBitcoin and ether dip to end the week, and crypto firm Consensys sues the SEC:\nCNBC Crypto World\n\nTanaya Macheel\n\nwatch now\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO10:36\n\nBitcoin outperforms Nasdaq after U.S. economy grew less than projected in Q1:\nCNBC Crypto World\n\nTalia Kaplan\n\nRead More\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
