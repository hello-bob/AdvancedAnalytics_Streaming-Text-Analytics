Please refresh the page.\n\n## How it Works\n\nThis station is backed by a true random number generator provided by\nArbitrand. Once per second, we use the random number generator to generate\nrandom bits from quantum noise, and then turn 8 bytes of entropy into a digit\nbetween 0 and 9. In keeping with the history of numbers stations, we use these\ndigits and a text-to-speech synthesizer to generate the stream of random\nnumbers. Digits are transmitted timestamped, and everyone listening is hearing\nthe same stream.\n\nDespite the possibility, there are no coded messages in the stream, just\nrandom digits. We generate digits ten seconds ahead of time, to account for\nsome variability between our clocks. In a sense, this stream is a form of\npublic randomness.\n\n## History of Numbers Stations\n\nNumbers stations are a cold-war era technology that was used to hide coded\nmessages. A shortwave radio station would broadcast random numbers on a set\nschedule, sometimes 24/7, with a fixed time interval between each number.\n\nWithin this stream of random numbers, it is possible to hide coded messages.\nWith a stream of random numbers, a known transmission time, and a one-time pad\nencryption mechanism, numbers stations offer a low-bandwidth communication\nmedium that both hides the time of transmissions and offers unbreakable\nencryption on their content. Due to the use of one-time pads, messages are\nindistinguishable from random data.\n\nEach station had a different protocol for encoding when messages and\nbroadcasts were occurring. Some stations would broadcast only their random\npatterns, and other stations would mostly broadcast repeated sequences of\nnumbers before switching to random messages. Some stations also had repeated\ncodes that would indicate something about the content of the data stream,\nwhich could mean the start of a message.\n\nSome of the earliest text-to-speech technology was used for numbers stations,\nand others would have operators that came on the air in shifts, reading off a\nlist of numbers into a microphone for hours and hours.\n\nSeveral numbers stations are still active today, although not nearly as many\nas in the cold war. As recently as 2010, the US has charged spies with the use\nof numbers stations to receive coded messages. Shortwave radio is still the\nmost common transmission medium, due to its intercontinental range, but some\nof them use digital encodings now.\n\n### Encrypted Messages in Numbers Stations\n\nCoded messages could be sent using unbreakable encryption based on one-time\npads. One-time pad encryption uses a key of the same length as the plaintext,\neffectively providing perfect security. Since the one-time pad is random, the\nmessage being transmitted contains no information content about the plaintext,\nand even brute force attacks are useless.\n\nThe main drawback of this method is that you depend on generating and\nexchanging one-time pads securely. The perfect security of one-time pads\ndepends on generating a large amount of random data without using cryptography\nto do it, which requires a true random number generator, and exchanging a one-\ntime pad often means physically handing off a book or a flash drive.\n\n### More on Numbers Stations\n\nWikipedia on Numbers Stations\n\nNumbers Stations Research Center\n\nA Good Press Article on Numbers Stations\n\nQuestions or comments?\n\nContact us\n\n", "frontpage": false}
