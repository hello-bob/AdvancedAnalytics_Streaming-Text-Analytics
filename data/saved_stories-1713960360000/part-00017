Can a new\nnationwide lighting standard make a difference?\n\nTop: A view of the Milky Way from NSF\u2019s NOIRLab Cerro Tololo Inter-American\nObservatory, located at the edge of Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert.

Slovinsk\u00fd\n\nBy Alexa Robles-Gil\n\n04.22.2024\n\nRepublish Print\n\nGrowing up in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert, Paulina Villalobos thought the Milky\nWay\u2019s presence in the pristine starry skies was a given. Her father, an\namateur astronomer, would wake her when a comet crossed the night sky. But\nVillalobos later moved to Santiago, the capital, to study architecture. There,\nthe stars disappeared amid a haze of city lights. Just like people who come\nfrom the coast miss the ocean, she said, \u201cI missed the sky.\u201d\n\n#### Related\n\nIn China, Heavenly Views Amid Earthly Tensions\n\nThe extraordinary darkness that sheaths the Atacama, which stretches for\nhundreds of miles in Chile\u2019s north, has made it a haven for astronomers\nsearching for planets and stars shimmering in the night sky. With its high\naltitude and clear skies, the region is repeatedly chosen as a site for\nobservatories. According to some estimates, by 2030, Chile will be home to\naround 70 percent of the world\u2019s astronomical infrastructure.\n\nYet even here, skyglow from hundreds of miles away can overwhelm the faint\nlight emanating from astronomical objects.\n\nNow, a new regulation aims to darken the night skies.\n\nIn October, the Chilean government announced a new National Lighting Standard\nthat will become effective later this year. The updated standards expand\nrestrictions on light luminosity, color, and the hours they can be turned on\nto protect three major concerns: astronomy, biodiversity, and human health.\n\n> According to some estimates, by 2030, Chile will be home to around 70\n> percent of the world\u2019s astronomical infrastructure.\n\nFor astronomers, the stakes can feel high. While the Atacama offers a window\nto answer fundamental questions about the origin of life, that window is at\nrisk of closing in the next 50 years due to increasing light pollution, said\nChilean astronomer Guillermo Blanc. Worldwide, the sky is estimated to get\nbrighter by 10 percent on average each year.\n\nThe new rule on light pollution in Chile was informed, in part, by a technical\nadvisory committee, which included astronomers and other scientists \u2014\nVillalobos, who is now an architect and lighting designer, among them. The new\nregulation, she said, offers \u201cthe possibility of recovering the sky.\u201d\n\nSince the 1960s, the Atacama Desert has been an important hub for\ninternational astronomy. Today, the region, which boasts more than 300 clear\nnights per year, hosts some of the world\u2019s most significant observatories,\nincluding the internationally funded Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray and the European Southern Observatory, the latter of which is currently\ndeveloping the Extremely Large Telescope, set to open in 2028.\n\nNOIRLab, a United States government-funded program, also operates two\nfacilities in the Atacama. The National Science Foundation has invested more\nthan $500 million to build a third facility, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory,\nwhich is expected to see first light later in 2025. Yet it too is threatened\nby light pollution, said Blanc, who works at the Las Campanas Observatory.\n\nThe Vera C. Rubin Observatory aims to conduct a 10-year survey of the Southern\nHemisphere sky to understand dark matter and energy, take an inventory of the\nsolar system, and map the Milky Way. But in recent years, mining operations\nand urban development in the area have increased ambient brightness.\n\nThe lights of the town of Andacollo, Chile, seen from NOIRLab\u2019s Cerro Tololo\nInter-American Observatory in Chile, are reduced during a \u201cBlackout for Our\nSkies\u201d event in 2022.

Stockebrand\n\nThese telescopes are being built to operate for 50 or even 100 years, but \u201cthe\noutlook today is very worrisome in 20, 30, 40 years,\u201d Blanc said.\n\nThose problems are global; worldwide, two-thirds of major professional\nobservatories are affected by levels of light pollution that exceed the\nexpected natural levels, according to a 2023 review. While many observations\nnow take place from telescopes orbiting Earth, ground-based telescopes are\nstill essential to interpret observations from those space-based telescopes.\nAnd if the sky\u2019s natural brightness increases, it\u2019s harder to observe faint\nobjects, such as distant galaxies forming on the far edge of the universe or\ngas orbiting around black holes.\n\nSome observations will require more time \u2014 and greater investment: \u201cIf you\nhave to spend two nights instead of one night to observe a faint thing because\nthe sky is now artificially brighter, that costs money,\u201d said James Lowenthal,\na professor of astronomy at Smith College who also leads the Light Pollution\nsubcommittee for the American Astronomical Society. \u201cWe\u2019re talking literally\nbillions of dollars at stake \u2014 at least tens of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe outlook today is very worrisome in 20, 30, 40 years.\u201d\n\nOthers might become impossible without better technology: \u201cWe are directly\ncutting the possibility of seeing certain phenomena,\u201d said Rodolfo Angeloni,\nan assistant scientist at NOIRLab\u2019s Gemini Observatory Southern Operations\nCenter who studies stellar astrophysics and the effects of light pollution on\nthe Chilean sky. \u201cIf a sky reaches a certain threshold of brightness, the\ntelescopes installed in the area are simply no longer able to do frontier\nresearch.\u201d\n\nHe cited the Mount Wilson Observatory in California, where the Milky Way\ngalaxy was first measured, as an example. The extraordinary growth of Los\nAngeles brought significant levels of light pollution. Today, observatories in\nCalifornia have to work with a brightness in the sky that was previously\nnonexistent.\n\nChile, however, has other plans.\n\nChile\u2019s new regulation on light pollution builds upon a previous rule that\nonly protected certain key astronomical sites. The new regulation, in\ncontrast, will apply nationwide. Its aim is not to blackout La Serena or\nSantiago, some of Chile\u2019s major cities, but to use specific lighting to reduce\nnegative effects.\n\nIn 2019, when the Ministry of the Environment began revising the regulation,\nChile took a step towards addressing the problem by incorporating light as a\nlegal pollutant. Over 83 percent of the world\u2019s population lives under light-\nsaturated skies, but light is not normally seen \u2014 and legislated \u2014 as\npollution. Many advocates say that it should be.\n\nThe sky \u201cis as polluted as, for example, a river that is full of garbage. It\u2019s\nas polluted as living next to a factory,\u201d said Felipe Loaiza Arias, who works\nfor Chile\u2019s Ministry of the Environment and helped craft the legislation.\n\nThe distant glow from several cities is seen from NOIRLab\u2019s Cerro Tololo\nInter-American Observatory in Chile. The country\u2019s new regulation on outdoor\nlighting dictates the direction, brightness, and color spectrum of lights in\nan effort to protect biodiversity and human health, in addition to astronomy.\nVisual: CTIO/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/D. Munizaga\n\nThe 2023 regulation also recognized that astronomy is not all that\u2019s at risk.\nTwo other focuses were incorporated: biodiversity and human health. Reduced\nartificial light could aid migrating seabirds, like Markham\u2019s storm-petrel\nthat nests in the Atacama Desert; thousands die each year because of city\nlights, putting them at risk of extinction. And light pollution also\ninterferes with the circadian rhythm of humans and other species.\n\nThe restrictions apply to all outdoor lighting, from the small-scale, such as\nstreetlights, to the large, like mining facilities. Lamps cannot be directed\ntowards the upper hemisphere, and the law regulates their luminosity and color\nspectrum. Lighting can emit no more than 7 percent of blue light, and in\nSpecial Protection Areas, which include astronomical sites and protected areas\nfor biodiversity, it\u2019s limited to just 1 percent.\n\nBut there is a major constraint that Blanc and Angeloni agreed on: oversight.\nDoes Chile have the resources to oversee correct lighting all over the\ncountry? Loaiza Arias recognized it as a challenge. These types of regulations\nare massive and ambitious in terms of the sources of light they regulate,\nLoaiza Arias explained. And because the regulation has limited application\nwhen it comes to lights that are already installed, the measures, he said, are\nmore so preventive.\n\n#### Support Undark Magazine\n\nUndark is a non-profit, editorially independent magazine covering the\ncomplicated and often fractious intersection of science and society.

Although the\nregulation is positive, she said, it only oversees individual lights and\noverlooks the collective light pollution from a facility. If people were aware\nof light pollution, she says, the issue might be easier to tackle.\n\nOften, urban dwellers are not aware of how over-illuminated their cities are.\nThe use of lighting that is brighter than needed, or turned on at unessential\ntimes, has caused a widespread global fog of light. According to one 2016\nstudy, an estimated one-third of the world population cannot see the Milky\nWay, including 60 percent of Europeans and nearly 80 percent of North\nAmericans.\n\nAlthough Chile\u2019s new lighting standard is one of the first of its kind in\nSouth America, and perhaps even the world, Loaiza Arias believes it is not\nimmediately replicable: Chile recognizes how important astronomy is, both for\nscience and the country\u2019s economy, he said, but another country might have\ndifferent priorities.\n\n\u201cChile is showing us the way to how to do this in a sort of holistic fashion,\u201d\nsaid Richard Green, an astronomer at the University of Arizona, who has\nstudied dark skies for over 30 years and used to travel to the Atacama as part\nof his work at the U.S. National Observatory.\n\nLowenthal, the Smith College astronomer, wonders how other countries could\nreplicate the regulation. Lowenthal believes that the night sky should also be\nprotected, like air and water that are federally regulated under the Clean Air\nAct and Clean Water Act, respectively. For him, the question is: What will it\ntake for the night sky to be recognized as an essential part of the\nenvironment?\n\n> \u201cChile is showing us the way to how to do this in a sort of holistic\n> fashion.\u201d\n\nBeyond the consequences for astronomy, the night sky is a heritage and a\nconnection to our human past, Lowenthal added: From Chile to the American\nSouthwest, to Indonesia and Hawai\u2019i, people have deeply understood the sky.\nAddressing light pollution, he said, is about maintaining that connection.\n\nVillalobos eventually returned to the Atacama and Chile after years abroad\nstudying light. She now sits on the International Committee of DarkSky\nInternational, a nonprofit that aims to protect and conserve the night sky.\nThe Atacama Desert, to her, is more than just home to some of the world\u2019s\nbiggest observatories; here, people can experience the awe of the night sky\nonce more.\n\nIn the Atacama, Villalobos said, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing between you and the\nuniverse.\u201d\n\nNote: Numerous interviews for this story were conducted originally in Spanish,\nand subsequently translated to English.\n\nAlexa Robles-Gil is a Mexican science journalist based in New York City.
