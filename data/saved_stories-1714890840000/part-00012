Electric car driver turned away from hospital car park\n\n1 day ago\n\nTom Singleton,Technology reporter\n\nPaul Freeman-Powell\n\nSigns in the car park confirmed the ban\n\nA father who was taking his child to Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool says he\nwas turned away from the car park because he was driving an electric vehicle\n(EV).\n\nPaul Freeman-Powell said he was told to park next to nearby grass because his\ncar \"could explode.\"\n\nThe hospital says it has temporarily banned access to the car park while it\nimproves its sprinkler system.\n\nBut industry figures have challenged the decision, pointing to research that\nindicates petrol cars are considerably more likely to catch fire than EVs.\n\nMr Freeman-Powell told the BBC he attempted to tell the security guard he\nspoke to that the hospital's policy did not make any sense.\n\nBut he said in the end he complied because he did not want his seven-year-old\nson to miss an appointment he had waited nearly five years for.\n\nIn a statement issued to the BBC, Alder Hey hospital said following advice\nfrom Merseyside Fire and Rescue it had \"temporarily restricted the parking of\nelectric vehicles in one of our smaller car parks while we upgrade its fire\nsprinkler system.\"\n\n\"Electric vehicles are still able to park in our main Hospital car park\", it\ncontinued, pointing out it also had 14 spaces with EV charging points.\n\nMerseyside Fire and Rescue has been contacted for comment.\n\n## 'Misinfomation'\n\nMr Freeman-Powell shared a picture of a sign at the entrance to the car park\nwhich reads \u201cno electric vehicles\u201d on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nFair Charge, a campaign group for electric vehicles, described it as\n\u201cmisinformation erroneously shaping public policy\u201d.\n\nIts founder, the motoring journalist Quentin Wilson, said \"for the NHS to\nrestrict electric cars from coming into car parks dramatically conflicts with\nthe clean air and health benefits from zero tailpipe emissions.\"\n\nPaul Freeman-Powell\n\nThe car park EVs are barred from\n\nColin Walker, head of transport at the research group the Energy and Climate\nIntelligence Unit, agreed that the evidence did not support the hospital's\nposition.\n\n\u201cData from EV FireSafe, which is backed by the Australian Government,\nindicates that petrol cars are over 80 times more likely to set on fire than\nEVs,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nHe also highlighted a report released last year from the Swedish Civil\nContingencies Agency which found that in 2022 there was an average of 3.8\nfires per 100,000 electric and hybrid cars, and 68 fires per 100,000 cars of\nall fuel types, with these figures including arson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that drivers understand the relative risks\", Mr Walker said,\n\nHe also pointed out that a recent car fire which closed Luton Airport was\nstarted by a vehicle running on diesel fuel, not electric as some initial\nreports claimed.\n\nElectric car sales have slowed this year, comprising just 15% of new cars\nregistered in the UK in March 2024, according to figures released by the\nSociety of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\n\nThe US EV maker Tesla reported a drop in revenue for the first time since\n2021, and has been laying off staff, with co-founder Elon Musk saying the firm\nhad to be \u201cabsolutely hardcore\u201d about cutting costs.\n\n## How to charge an electric car with no driveway\n\n## Why are electric car fires so hard to deal with?\n\nBatteries\n\nElectric cars\n\nCar industry\n\nRelated\n\n## How giant batteries
