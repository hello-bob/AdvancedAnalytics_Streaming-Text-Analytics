Studies of\nhuman populations have shown the breadth of what can spread throughout a\nsocial network: obesity, smoking cessation, happiness, drug use and divorce.\n\u2018Betweenness centrality\u2019 is a key property of social networks that indicates\nan individual\u2019s importance in facilitating communication and cohesion within\nthe network. Heritability of betweenness centrality has been suggested in\nseveral species, however the genetic regulation of this property remains\nenigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the gene CG14109, referred to as degrees\nof kevin bacon (dokb), influences betweenness centrality in Drosophila\nmelanogaster. We identify strain-specific alleles of dokb with distinct amino\nacid sequences and when the dokb allele is exchanged between strains, flies\nexhibit the betweenness centrality pattern dictated by the donor allele. By\ninserting a GAL4 reporter into the dokb locus, we confirm that dokb is\nexpressed in the central nervous system. These findings define a novel genetic\nentry point to study social network structure and thereby establish gene-to-\nsocial structure relationships. While dokb sequence homology is exclusive to\nDiptera, we anticipate that dokb-associated molecular pathways could unveil\nconvergent neural mechanisms of social behaviour that apply in diverse animal\nspecies.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Machine learning reveals the control mechanics of an insect wing hinge\n\nArticle 17 April 2024\n\n### Cortical gene expression architecture links healthy neurodevelopment to\nthe imaging, transcriptomics and genetics of autism and schizophrenia\n\nArticle Open access 22 April 2024\n\n### A high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial atlas of cell types in the\nwhole mouse brain\n\nArticle Open access 13 December 2023\n\n## Introduction\n\nAlthough the mention of social networks often brings to mind digital social\nmedia platforms like Facebook and other online communities, the use of social\nnetworks to analytically study group behaviour originated in the field of\nsociology in the 1930s^1. Since its inception, social networks have been\nstudied in various animals, from fruit flies^2 to elephants^3,4. Despite how\ncommon it is for animals to form social groups and interact within them,\ngenetic contributions to the structure of group behaviour are still poorly\nunderstood. Here, we use the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to\nidentify a gene responsible for regulating a social network property,\nbetweenness centrality.\n\nBetweenness centrality, like other measures of centrality, quantifies the\nimportance of individuals in facilitating interactions within a social network\nand is defined as the number of shortest paths that traverse a\nnode/individual^5. In some animals, such as dolphins and rock hyraxes, high\nmeasures of centrality correlate to better health outcomes^6,7. An individual\nwith high betweenness centrality is thought to be important for cohesion and\ncommunication relay throughout a group and can be loosely thought of as a\n\u201cgatekeeper\u201d for the network (Fig. 1). Depending on what is spreading\nthroughout a social network, having high betweenness centrality may underlie\nbeneficial or detrimental outcomes. For example, having high betweenness\ncentrality in a scientific research network increases potential\ncollaborators^8, but in a disease network, it may increase the chance of HIV\ninfection^9. Studies have shown that betweenness centrality is likely\nheritable in several species, including marmots^10, macaques^11, fruit\nflies^12 and humans^13.\n\nFig. 1: Social network structure and betweenness centrality.\n\nCircles represent nodes (individuals), and the arrowed connections indicate\ninteractions between nodes. Numbers indicate the degree (total number of\ninteractions) for each node. Anything flowing through the network from the\nyellow nodes on the left to the yellow nodes on the right (or vice versa) must\ntraverse through the blue node. Thus, the blue node has a higher betweenness\ncentrality than the yellow nodes, as the blue node acts as a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019\nbetween the left side and right side of this network.\n\nFull size image\n\nBetweenness centrality is one structural feature of a social network, although\nthere are many others^14. The betweenness centrality of a group guides and\nconstrains how the group may function. For example, the betweenness centrality\nof a group can influence the spread of a disease, the spread of information or\nthe distribution of food. Similar to mating, courtship and aggression,\nbetweenness centrality only manifests in a social setting. Here, we use\nDrosophila melanogaster social networks (Supplementary Fig. 1) to identify and\nmanipulate a single gene that regulates betweenness centrality (BC).\n\n## Results\n\n### Mapping a locus responsible for regulating BC in Drosophila\n\nTo identify a gene that regulates betweenness centrality, we began by using an\nadapted recombinant mapping technique^15 and exploited the observation that\nbetweenness centrality is higher in our Canton-S (CS) strain compared to our\nOregon-R (OR) strain of Drosophila melanogaster^16 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The\nstrain-specific phenotype and mapping method were robust and allowed us to map\na betweenness centrality locus within a 474 kb region on the 3L chromosome\n(Fig. 2a, b; Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). We identified two genes within this\nlocus that are differentially expressed in the central nervous systems of CS\nand OR flies: Nplp2 and CG14109 (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nFig. 2: Mapping the gene that regulates betweenness centrality.\n\na Left: Visual representation of recombination events on the 3rd chromosome\ngenerated through recombination of CS and OR strains of Drosophila as\ndetermined by SNP genotyping. OR regions are displayed in grey, CS regions are\ndisplayed in orange, unsequenced regions are displayed as a thin black line.\nNucleotide position (bp) of chromosome 3 is on the x-axis.

Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\n\nFull size image\n\n### Testing candidate genes, Nplp2 and CG14109, for the regulation of BC\n\nNext, we asked whether either of these genes influence betweenness centrality.\nTo address this question, we knocked down the expression of Nplp2 and CG14109\nusing the GAL4-UAS system and eliminated the expression of CG14109 by creating\na null mutant using CRISPR/Cas9. Both Nplp2 and CG14109 RNAi lines and the\nCG14109 null mutant had a strong knockdown efficacy (see below). We show that\nknocking down Nplp2 expression did not affect betweenness centrality, but\nknocking down or knocking out expression of CG14109 resulted in networks with\nlower betweenness centrality compared to wild-type controls (see below).\n\nNext, we asked whether CG14109 is responsible for the strain-based difference\nin betweenness centrality. This gene differs by seven nucleotides between our\nCS and OR strains, one of which results in a predicted amino acid difference\n(129_Ala\u2192Glu; Fig. 2c, d; Supplementary Fig. 5). However, there are no\nnucleotide differences in the upstream region of the gene. We used CRISPR/Cas9\nto insert the CS CG14109 allele into an OR fly and vice versa (Fig. 2c, d).\nNetworks formed by these flies show that betweenness centrality correlates to\nthe CG14109 donor allele and not the genetic background (Fig. 2e): just as CS\nwild-type flies form networks with higher betweenness centrality than OR wild-\ntype flies (Fig. 2e; Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 3), flies with a\nCS CG14109 allele (CG14109^+1) in an otherwise OR background form networks\nwith higher betweenness centrality than flies with an OR CG14109 allele\n(CG14109^+2) in a CS background. These data show that the CG14109 allele\nrescues the robust strain-based difference observed between our CS and OR\nstrains. Other social behaviours correspond most closely to the genetic\nbackground of these lines and not the CG14109 donor allele (Fig. 3a, c, e),\nalthough some social behaviour measures did not correspond to either the\nCG14109 allele or the genetic background (Fig. 3b, d). We conclude that\nCG14109 regulates betweenness centrality, a metric of group behaviour.

To do this, we manipulated dokb expression using mutant\nand transgenic lines and subsequently measured the betweenness centrality of\ntheir networks. Knocking out and knocking down dokb expression reduced\nbetweenness centrality (Fig. 4a\u2013c; Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Additionally, we\nfound that when the dokb^+1 allele was inserted into an OR background, dokb\nwas expressed at the same levels as in CS flies, and when the dokb^+2 allele\nwas inserted into a CS background, it was expressed at the same levels as in\nOR flies (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Fig. 6c). The fact that the upstream region\nof dokb is identical in both strains suggests that differential dokb\nexpression is a result from regulatory elements within the gene itself.\nMoreover, we show that dokb expression did not decrease in Nplp2 knockdown\nflies, and the behavioural phenotype did not differ from controls (Fig. 4e;\nSupplementary Fig. 6d). Taken together, these data demonstrate that dokb RNA\nexpression correlates with betweenness centrality and supports our conclusion\nthat dokb regulates the betweenness centrality phenotype in fly social\nnetworks.\n\nFig. 4: dokb RNA expression and betweenness centrality across genetic lines.\n\nEach dot (no outline) represents the average BC from a network formed by a\ndistinct group of 12 flies.

In a CS background, dokb nulls (dokb^n1) showed\nan increase in alkanes, methyl alkanes and total hydrocarbon amounts, but\nthere was no effect of deleting dokb on total alkene production (Supplementary\nFig. 7a\u2013d). In an OR background, dokb null flies (dokb^n2) had reduced\nalkenes, alkanes and total hydrocarbon amounts and increased methyl alkanes\n(Supplementary Fig. 7a\u2013d). dokb nulls of either strain showed no effect on cVA\nproduction, a compound previously shown to cause aggregation and dispersal in\nDrosophila^20,21,22,23,24 (Supplementary Fig. 7e). To investigate whether dokb\ncan influence the production of hydrocarbons directly, we next asked whether\ndokb is expressed in the oenocytes, the cells that synthesize cuticular\nhydrocarbons in Drosophila and other insects, using qPCR and a dokb GFP\nreporter. The oenocytes expressed extremely low levels of dokb with most of\nour replicates failing to detect any dokb at all (Supplementary Table 2). No\nGFP was detected in the oenocytes (Fig. 5d); however, GFP was detected in\nadult somatic muscle tissue including, but not limited to, the dorsal lateral\nmuscles (Fig. 5a, b), the alary muscles (Fig. 5c, d) and larval body wall\nmuscles (Fig. 5e). Taken together, our data show that deleting dokb results in\nchanges to hydrocarbon profiles but dokb is not reliably detected in the\noenocytes, suggesting it does not directly affect hydrocarbon production.\nThese results are consistent with previous findings, that group composition\ncan affect hydrocarbon profiles and gene expression independent of\ngenotype^18,25. Thus, we favour the hypothesis that changes in hydrocarbon\nprofiles in dokb null mutants are a consequence of their social experience;\ni.e. differences in their social network structure.\n\nFig. 5: Expression of dokb using dokb^n2-GAL4 line and a GFP reporter in adult\nand larval muscle tissue.\n\ndokb^n2-GAL4 expression patterns reported by a UAS-GFP reporter (green).

In the 3rd instar\nlarval CNS, GFP was detected in the mushroom body calyces, the ventral nerve\ncord, the eye/antennal disc and leg discs (Supplementary Fig. 9). In the adult\nmale CNS, GFP was detected in the gamma lobes and calyces of the mushroom\nbodies, as well as the suboesophageal ganglion and ventral nerve cord (Fig.\n6). The Drosophila mushroom bodies have been shown to play a critical role in\nolfactory learning and memory^26,27,28,29 and are connected to several primary\nsensory centres, including the olfactory antennal lobe, visual optic lobe and\nthe gustatory suboesophageal zone^30. The gamma lobes of the mushroom bodies\nhave been shown to play a role in social attraction and in forming short-term\nmemories in Drosophila^31,32,33,34,35 (Fig. 6a\u2013c, f, g). In the ventral nerve\ncord, GFP is expressed in the ventral and intermediate regions of the\nprothoracic, mesothoracic and metathoracic neuromeres^36, which are regions\ninnervated by neurons associated with the legs^37 and regions serving to link\nlegs and wing control^38, respectively. GFP expression is also evident in the\naccessory mesothoracic neuropil, which is associated with sensory afferents\nfrom the wing and notum^36,39 (Fig. 6a\u2013c). Taken together, we demonstrate that\ndokb expression begins in the larval stage and occurs in tissue-specific\nregions within the larval and adult central brain and ventral nerve cord. In\nadults, dokb expression patterns coincide with tissues related to olfactory\nlearning, locomotion and motor control. Given that dokb regulates a complex\ngroup-level behaviour, it is noteworthy that this gene\u2019s expression pattern\nsuggests a potential circuit that includes neurons associated with sensory\nprocessing, sensory-motor integration and motor output.\n\nFig. 6: Expression of dokb using dokb^n2-GAL4 line and a GFP reporter in the\nadult CNS.\n\ndokb^n2-GAL4 expression patterns reported by UAS-mCD8.GFP (green).\nImmunostained with anti-nc82 antibody (magenta).

We asked whether these two alleles are an artefact of\ncaptivity or, alternatively, may represent naturally occurring variants. The\nidentification of such allelic variation in the wild could indicate an\nadaptive advantage. To investigate whether these allelic differences are found\nin nature, we examined the dokb sequence of various wild-caught D.\nmelanogaster strains from PopFly^40 (Supplementary Fig. 10a). We analysed the\nfrequency of cytosine and adenine at dokb\u2019s 1049^th nucleotide, which accounts\nfor the alanine to glutamic acid change in our CS and OR laboratory strains,\nrespectively. We found that adenine occurs at this position in 6.5% of the\nsamples analysed from 30 strains taken from five continents around the world\n(Supplementary Table 3). In addition, we found that the distribution of\nadenine across the different strain samples is unevenly distributed [X^2(28, N\n= 49) = 369.16, p < 0.001], with a higher frequency of adenine occurring in\nvarious strains collected from lower elevations (Supplementary Fig. 10b).\nBased on these observations, we conclude that these dokb alleles exist in the\nwild and show that the laboratory strains used in our experiments retain this\nnatural variation.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBy taking a social network approach to study groups of flies, we and others\nhave characterized differences in group structure across strains within the\nmelanogaster species^2. There are many examples of strain-based distinctions\nin Drosophila, encompassing diversity in mating strategies^41, pheromonal\nprofiles^42,43,44, biological clocks^45, taste reception^46, and learning\nabilities^47,48. Our paper shows that a single gene, dokb, is sufficient to\nregulate a specific behavioural feature of social networks, betweenness\ncentrality. Allelic differences of dokb within laboratory strains modulate\nbetweenness centrality. In addition, we found identical alleles in wild\npopulations, with the dokb^+2 allele occurring at a relatively low frequency.\nOther low-frequency alleles have been reported to confer an adaptive advantage\nin certain populations. For example, the sickle haemoglobin (HbS) allele, a\nstructural variant of normal haemoglobin, occur with varying frequencies in\ndifferent populations, with higher HbS frequencies in regions with higher\ninstances of malaria^49. Similarly, we speculate that these two dokb alleles\nconfer an adaptive value of social structure within the species and that,\ngiven the unequal distribution of the two alleles across elevation, the\npopulation benefits from having higher frequencies of the dokb^+2 allele at\nlower elevations, although further investigation is required to determine what\nthat advantage may be. Identifying this genetic variant is invaluable for\ninvestigating the evolutionary processes underlying group behaviour.\n\nAlthough group-level social behaviour is a general feature of animal life, the\nmolecular evolution of social networks and collective behaviours have not been\nwell characterized. Surprisingly, we found no DNA or protein sequence homology\nof dokb outside of the Diptera order, nor did we find any conserved domains\nwithin the predicted CS and OR DOKB protein sequences. Nevertheless, in\ninstances of convergent evolution, conservation often manifests at the pathway\nlevel rather than through identical gene sequences. For example, caste\nphenotypes in eusocial insects, including bees, ants, and wasps, have been\nassociated with conserved metabolic pathways, such as the glycolysis pathway,\nrather than specific genes^50. We anticipate that the molecular pathways\nand/or functional cell circuitry with which dokb is involved will be conserved\nin other animals. Numerous studies suggest genetic contributions to the\nstructure of social networks^10,11,12, including for betweenness centrality in\nhumans^13, indicating the potential for a conserved pathway. The functional\nroles and biological pathways associated with dokb and its encoded protein can\nnow be directly addressed.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Fly Rearing\n\nAll fly strains were reared on a medium containing agar, glucose, sucrose,\nyeast, cornmeal, wheat germ, soya flour, molasses, propionic acid and Tegosept\nin a 12:12 h light/dark cycle at 25 \u00b0C. For network experiments, newly-eclosed\nadult males were collected using CO_2 anaesthesia and were kept in same-sex\ngroups of 12\u201316 flies in food vials and aged for 3 days. Experiments were run\nbetween 9 and 10.5 h after the lights were on.\n\n### Fly Lines\n\nCanton-S (CS) and Oregon-R (OR) wild-type flies were obtained from J. C. Hall\n(Emeritus at Brandeis University, Waltham, MA). Introgression and recombinant\nlines were generated through a series of crosses from these wild-type lines.\nRecombinant lines had OR as their X and 2nd chromosome and an OR recombined\nwith CS as their 3rd chromosome.\n\n+;+;dokb^n2-GAL4, dokb^n1, CS(dokb^+2), dokb^n2 and OR(dokb^+1) were generated\nusing CRISPR/Cas9 in collaboration with WellGenetics Inc. Lines were verified\nwith DNA sequencing.\n\ndokb null lines (dokb^n1, dokb^n2 and dokb^n2-GAL4) were generated such that\nthe 980 bp coding sequence (+16 nt from ATG to \u221285 nt from stop codon of dokb)\nwas deleted and replaced with a Stop-RFP cassette with 3-frames of stop codons\nand a 3XP3-RFP, except for the dokb^n2-GAL4 line which was replaced by a\nT2A-GAL4::VP16 cassette and 3XP3-RFP.\n\nFor the CS(dokb^+2) and OR(dokb^+1) swap lines, the entire gene region of\ndokb, from the promoter to the 3\u2019UTR (1960bp) in one strain, was deleted and\nreplaced by the gene region from the other strain with an inverted PBacDsRed\nmarker inserted into the 2nd intron of dokb. The marker was excised before\nlines were used in behavioural experiments.\n\nThe CG14109 deficiency null was generated by selecting progeny from crossing\nvirgin +;+;dokb^n2-GAL4 females to deficiency males (w[1118]; Df(3L)ED4502,\nP{w[+mW.Scer\\FRT.hs3] = 3\u2019.RS5 + 3.3\u2019}ED4502/TM6C, cu[1] Sb[1]; Bloomington\nStock Center Line #8097).\n\nThe Nplp2 RNAi knockdown flies were generated by selecting progeny from\ncrossing Nplp2-GAL4 line (w[1118] (I); P{w[+mC] = Nplp2-GAL4}vie72a (II);\nKorean Drosophila Resource Center Line #10023) to the UAS-Nplp2 RNAi line\n(y[1] v[1]; P{y[+t7.7] v[+t1.8] = TRiP.HMJ21484}attP40; Bloomington Stock\nCenter Line #54041).\n\n### Genetic mapping\n\nTo map the locus containing the gene responsible for regulating BC in flies,\nwe based our method on Chen et al.^15 but adapted their method to suit our\nassay and fly strain requirements. We began by assessing the BC of our\nintrogression lines and determined that there was a gene(s) on the 3rd\nchromosome responsible for regulating BC (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Next, we\nsequenced the genomes of our CS and OR lab strains: ~3 \u03bcg of gDNA was\ncollected from male and female CS and OR whole flies using Zymo Research ZR\nTissue and Insect DNA Miniprep Kit (#D6016) and supplied to The Centre for\nApplied Genomics (TCAG; Toronto, ON, Canada) for high-throughput sequencing\n(Illumina HiSeq 2500).\n\nWe subsequently generated a high-resolution SNP map [Clinical Genomics Centre\n(Toronto, ON, Canada)] by identifying polymorphisms between the two strains at\na resolution of approximately 60 equally spaced SNPs on each chromosome 3 arm.\n\nWe generated recombinant lines through a series of genetic crosses that\nresulted in flies that had an OR X and 2nd chromosome and a recombined CS/OR\n3rd chromosome. Instead of phenotyping our recombinant lines first [as was\ndone in Chen et al.^15], we genotyped our recombinants to determine which\nregions of the chromosome were OR and which were CS. The gDNA samples of\nrecombinant lines were supplied to the Clinical Genomics Centre (Toronto, ON,\nCanada) for genotyping.\n\nThen, we strategically chose lines to phenotype based on their recombination\nevents. If the BC phenotype of a given recombinant line was statistically the\nsame as the CS control, we concluded that the CS region of that 3rd chromosome\nhoused the gene(s) responsible for regulating BC and, alternatively, if the BC\nphenotype of a given recombinant line was statistically the same as the OR\ncontrol, we concluded that the OR region of that 3rd chromosome housed the\ngene(s) responsible for regulating BC. Using this method, we narrowed the\nlocus to a ~1.2 MB region (Fig. 2a).\n\nWe further narrowed and mapped the locus using SNPs within this 1.2 MB region\nand in-house PCR to genotype more recombinant lines. Ultimately, using this\nmethod, we narrowed the locus to 474 kb (Fig. 2b).\n\n### Anti-dokb antibodies\n\nAntibodies were raised in New Zealand rabbits against the synthesized peptide\nVRQSTEEEEVQSHV, which corresponds to amino acid positions 61-74 in the CG14109\nprotein. The resulting antibody preparation was termed anti-CG14109_AA_61-74.\nAll peptide synthesis and antibody production were performed by GenScript\n(Piscataway, NJ, USA) using the PolyExpress polyclonal antibody express\nservice.\n\n### Protein extraction and Western Blot\n\nProteins from 15 male and 15 female fly heads per genotype were homogenized in\nlysis buffer, incubated on ice for 1 h, and centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min.\nThe supernatant was mixed with 2\u00d7 Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad, #1610737)\nand placed in a heating block (110 \u00b0C) for 15 min. Samples were loaded into a\n4\u201320% Mini-PROTEAN\u00ae TGXTM Precast Protein Gel (Bio-Rad, #4561094). Proteins\nwere transferred to a PVDF membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System\n(Bio-Rad). Blocking was performed using a 5% milk solution at 4 \u00b0C overnight.\nThe membrane was incubated in a 5% milk solution + anti-CG14109_AA_61-74\nantibody (1:1000) for 2 h at RT with gentle agitation. The membrane was washed\nthree times using 1X PBS for 5 min. then incubated with a 5% milk solution +\nsecondary antibody for 1 h at RT with gentle agitation. The membrane was\nwashed three times using 1X PBS for 5 min and was subsequently exposed to\nClarity Western ECL Substrates (Bio-Rad, #1705061) and imaged using a ChemiDoc\nImaging Station (Bio-Rad).\n\n### Social networks\n\nTwelve male flies were gently aspirated into a circular plexiglass arena (60\nmm diameter, 3 mm depth) and covered with a glass lid. The arena was placed\nunder a FireflyMV camera (Point Gray) with an infra-red backlight in a 25 \u00b0C\nenvironmental chamber at 60% humidity. Flies were allowed to acclimate in the\narena for 10 min. undisturbed. The subsequent 30 min. were recorded using\nfview^51. The 30 min video was processed using Ctrax (v 0.5.13)^52 to\ndetermine the position and orientation of each fly. Each video was manually\ninspected, and tracking errors were corrected for each video using\nfixerrors^52. Approximately 20 videos were used per genotype.\n\nThe social interaction criteria for all gene mapping experiments\n(introgression and recombinant experiments) were the same as the criteria used\nin Schneider et al.^16, and are described as follows:\n\n  1. (a)\n\nthe angle subtended by the long axis of the interactor fly and the line\nsegment connecting the interactor fly\u2019s center of area to that of the\ninteractee fly is less than or equal to 90\u00b0\n\n  2. (b)\n\nthe length of that line segment is less than or equal to two body lengths of\nthe interactor fly\n\n  3. (c)\n\nthese two conditions are maintained for at least 1.5 s\n\nIn 2014, a new method was proposed by Schneider and Levine to objectively and\ncomputationally determine the interaction criteria for a given genotype. Using\nsuch methods allows researchers to assess social networks while controlling\nfor the different ways that a genotype may interact. After the software\u2019s\ncreation, we used this method to determine the interaction criteria for all\nsubsequent experiments for all other genotypes (excludes recombinant and\nintrogression experiments; see Supplementary Table 4)^53.\n\nDirected social networks were generated by calculating iterative networks\nusing a moving-window boxcar filter at 25% network density (33 unique\ninteractions), as detailed in Schneider et al.^16,54. An interaction was\nconsidered unique if the interactor had not previously interacted with the\nother fly. The first network iteration represents the first 33 unique\ninteractions, the second network iteration ignores the first unique\ninteraction and adds a subsequent unique interaction...the ith network\niteration ignores the first i\u22121 interactions. For n network iteration, the\nbetweenness centrality (BC_n) was determined by averaging the BC of all twelve\nflies. Betweenness centrality for each node (fly) was determined using the\nBrain Connectivity Toolbox MATLAB (Mathworks, v2014a) scripts^55, and was\ncalculated using Eq. (1):\n\n$${{\\rm {BC}}}\\left(v\\right)=\\mathop{\\sum}\\limits_{s,t:s\\ne v\\ne\nt}\\frac{{\\lambda }_{{st}}\\left(v\\right)}{{\\lambda }_{{st}}}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the BC for node v [BC(v)] is the sum of the total number of shortest\npaths between nodes s and t that pass through v [(\\\\({\\lambda\n}_{{st}}\\left(v\\right)\\\\)] divided by the number of shortest paths from nodes\ns to t [\\\\({\\lambda }_{{st}}\\\\)]. Each network iteration\u2019s average BC was\nstandardized for degree distribution. For each iteration, 10,000 random\nnetworks with the same in- and out-degree distribution were generated and each\nrandom network\u2019s BC was calculated. A z score was determined using Eq. (2):\n\n$$\\frac{B{C}_{observed}-mean(B{C}_{random})}{std(B{C}_{random})}$$\n\n(2)\n\nThe BC z scores for all iterations from a single 30 min. network was averaged\nto generate a mean BC for a single experiment, represented as a single dot in\na dot plot graph showing betweenness centrality. In other words, each network\n(or n = 1) indicates the mean z score BC from an independent group of 12 flies\nthat were discarded after the 30-min network experiment was acquired. For each\nexperimental group, we acquired videos from ~20 independent groups of flies (n\n= ~20 for each treatment).\n\nFor networks involving the CS{dokb^+2} and OR{dokb^+1} flies and their\ncontrols, movement (mm/s) and interaction rate (# interactions/min.) were\ncalculated, along with three additional network properties: assortativity,\nclustering coefficient and global efficiency. All network properties were\ncalculated and standardized as described above and in Schneider et al.^16.\n\n### qPCR\n\nTo determine whether dokb expression correlates to BC, RNA was extracted from\nwhole male flies using RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using\niScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) and RT-PCR was performed using a CFX384\nReal-Time System (Bio-Rad) and iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad).\nEach experiment was performed three times (biological replicates) and\ncontained three technical replicates/samples. The reference gene used to\nnormalize each sample was RpL32.\n\nTo detect whether dokb was expressed in pheromone-synthesizing cells,\noenocytes were dissected from 40 w[1118]; nSyb-GAL4/+; +/+ flies (aged to 10\ndays) and pooled into a single biological sample. RNA extraction, cDNA\nsynthesis and qPCR methods were as described above.\n\nPrimer sequences for detecting levels of dokb are as follows: 5\u2019\nGCGAGCGCCTAGCTGC and 5\u2019 ATTCTCTTCTTGGGCACTCTCTACGG. Primer sequences for\ndetecting levels of Nplp2 are as follows: 5\u2019 ATGGCCAAGCTCGCAATTTG and 5\u2019\nGTTGAAATCACCCTGGGCCT.\n\n### RNAseq\n\nCNS dissections and extractions were performed three times to produce three\nbiological replicates. The protocol was as follows: CS and OR male flies\nhoused in 12:12 h light/dark cycle at 25 \u00b0C in groups of 12 male\nindividuals/vial. Three CNS dissections were performed over four time points\nfor each genotype (total: 12 CNS/genotype). The CNS samples for each genotype\nwere pooled. RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Microkit. RNA sequencing\nwas performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 by VANderbilt Technologies for Advanced\nGenomics (VANTAGE, Nashville, TN). RNA samples were prepared using Illumina\nTruSeq Stranded mRNA-seq kit and sequenced at paired-end 50 bp with a target\nof ~25 M reads/sample. The raw RNAseq data have been deposited in the NCBI\u2019s\nSRA database under accession code PRJNA1082663.\n\n### Cuticular hydrocarbon extraction\n\nFlies were sedated on ice and a single fly was added to a microvial containing\n50 \u03bcl of hexane containing 10 ng/\u03bcl of octadecane (C18) and 10 ng/\u03bcl of\nhexacosane (nC26) as injection standards. Tubes were gently vortexed for 2\nmin. Flies were removed and samples were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C prior to analysis.\nExtracts that were obtained from 40 to 50 individuals per genotype and\nexamined by gas chromatography.\n\n### Immunohistochemistry\n\nFor detecting dokb-GAL4 expression across larval development in a central\nbrain lobe, appropriately aged larval CNS samples were fixed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde for 20 min. at RT. The 1\u00b0 antibody, rabbit anti-GFP (Cell\nSignaling Technology, #2956), was applied at 1:1000 and the counterstaining\nantibody, mouse anti-DN-cad (Cell Signaling Technology, #14215), was applied\nat a 1:5 concentration. Alex Fluor 488 Donkey Anti-Rb IgG (H + L) (Invitrogen,\n#A32790) and Alex Fluor 555 Donkey Anti-Rb IgG (H + L) (Invitrogen, # A31572)\nwere applied at a 1:500 concentration.\n\nFor detecting dokb-GAL4 expression in the larval and adult CNS, samples were\nfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. at RT. Samples were labelled with\nrabbit anti-GFP.Alexa 488 conjugate (1:400; Invitrogen, # A21311) and\ncounterstained with primary mouse anti-Brp (nc82) (1:40; DSHB) and secondary\ndonkey anti-mouse Alexa 647 (1:400; Invitrogen, #A31571). Wandering 3rd instar\nmale larvae were used. Adult male flies were aged 3-4 days old.\n\nAll images were obtained from a Zeiss LSM880 microscope.\n\n### Imaging of muscular tissue\n\nFor imaging the adult thorax and abdomen, a UAS-nuclear GFP reporter was used\n(UAS-StingerII^56. The reporter line was crossed to the dokb^n2-GAL4 line.\nMale progeny were collected, and their abdomens were filleted for imaging. For\nlarval images, a UAS-mCD8.GFP reporter was used, and 3rd instar larvae were\nfilleted to expose the abdominal wall muscles. In the adult and larval muscle,\nexpressed GFP was directly imaged. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Stereo\nDiscovery V.12 microscope.\n\n### Sequence homology searches\n\nThe DNA and protein sequences of dokb were retrieved from www.flybase.com\nusing CG14109 as the query. BlastN and BlastP searches were performed at NCBI\nusing default setting. Conserved domain searches for the CS and OR DOKB\nputative protein were performed at\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi using default search\nsettings.\n\n### Natural variant data and analyses\n\n966 sequences of Drosophila melanogaster from 30 localities were downloaded\nfrom PopFly^40. 215 sequences were removed due to nucleotide ambiguity of\ndokb\u2019s 1049^th nucleotide position. The frequency of each nucleotide at this\nposition was manually tallied.\n\nThe world map depicting the various locations from which each strain was\ncollected and created in MATLAB (MathWorks, v2023b). The longitude and\nlatitude data for each location used to create the map and the elevation of\neach locality was downloaded from PopFly^40.\n\nThe chi-square test was performed manually in Microsoft Excel.\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nANOVA and T-tests were performed using MATLAB (MathWorks, v2014a). For all\nnetwork experiments, outliers \u226575th quartile + (1.5 \u00d7 IQR) or \u2264 25th\nquartile\u2212(1.5 \u00d7 IQR) were removed before statistical testing. All network\nexperiments were statistically analysed with \u0251 = 0.05, except for the dokb\nswap experiment (Fig. 2c, d), where multiple measurements were assessed using\nthe same data set (Bonferroni correction such that \u0251 = 0.008) and the\nhydrocarbon experiment (Supplementary Fig. 7, Bonferroni correction such that\n\u0251 = 0.01.)\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nSource data is available as a source data file.
