This year, we've\ndropped the word \"sensor\" from the title, and going forward, it will be known\nas the Perception Industry Map. This is to more accurately reflect the fact\nthat the pace of new hardware/sensor entrants has slowed, while software has\naccelerated and is now the fastest growing source of new perception map\ncompanies. That\u2019s not to say that there haven\u2019t been major shifts in other\nsectors of the map, however. There\u2019s been quite a lot of flux between 2023 and\n2024, which we\u2019ll explain in detail below.\n\nWhile some companies have exited sectors (for instance Waymo ceasing to sell\nits Laserbear Honeycomb LiDAR to third parties, and Huawei generally ceding\nChinese sensor markets to Hesai and RoboSense), very few companies have gone\nunder. This is particularly surprising given the general decrease in capital\navailability in a post-zero-interest-rate (aka \u201cZIRP\u201d) world. Perhaps many of\nthese companies raised war chests before markets tightened, or perhaps the\nuplift in deployments for robots and AVs generally has buoyed revenues.\nBecause of the private nature of most of these companies, it\u2019s hard to know\nwhere they stand in terms of cash position and revenue. All we can say is that\nit\u2019s 2024, and they\u2019re still here.\n\nFor the 2024 edition of the market map, we\u2019ve decided to make new distinctions\nin sectors that have proliferated the most over the past few years. Thus, 3D\nsensing is now broken up into 3D sensing and industrial 3D sensing. Cameras\nhave been split into embeddable and industrial cameras. And what was once\nstrictly event cameras is now \u201cemerging technology\u201d. The latter reflects quite\na bit of hardware and software innovation representing technologies moving\nfrom the lab and entering real world use. Will all of these companies be here\nnext year?

In all seriousness, however, the 3D sensing\nmarket has seen low levels of truly new product introduction over the past\ncouple of years, with a stable set of options from market participants like\nIntel RealSense, Luxonis, Stereolabs, and Orbbec. That is changing in 2024.\nNot only will Tangram Vision HiFi be shipping, but Stereolabs has launched\ntheir new Zed X, Orbbec has launched a slew of new Gemini models, Luxonis will\nbe shipping their RVC4-equipped depth sensors, and Intel RealSense has doubled\ndown on biometric use cases for their 2024 sensor updates. Thankfully, the\nmarket for depth sensors is also growing by leaps and bounds, meaning that all\nof these new entrants should benefit from scaled deployments and new users in\n2024 and beyond.\n\n### 3D Sensing - Industrial\n\nWhile these sensors were grouped with other 3D sensors last year, we felt it\nappropriate to segment them into their own category this year. This is because\nthese sensors compete primarily for a different set of customers and markets.\nYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find a Photoneo or Ensenso depth sensor on a mobile\nrobot, but they are pervasive in industrial use cases like traditional\nindustrial automation. Because of this, they are typically orders of magnitude\nmore expensive than the 3D sensors in our other 3D sensing category. This\ncategory has remained relatively stable, with few new market entrants or\nproduct introductions since it emerged in the late 2010s.\n\n### Ultrasonic\n\nGiven their ubiquity in automotive applications, the ultrasonic sector is\ndominated by large OEM suppliers like Continental, Texas Instruments, and\nBosch. However, there is still innovation at the early-stage level, and this\nyear\u2019s map sees the addition of Sonair. Sonair\u2019s upcoming sensor uses a MEMS\ntransducer that transmits a high-frequency ultrasonic signal which is then\ndecoded on reflection by a set of proprietary algorithms. According to their\nwebsite, they\u2019ll be shipping their first prototype units this year. We\u2019re\nexcited to see (or is it hear?) them in action!\n\n### LiDAR - Scanning\n\nNo other perception sensor category has seen more boom and bust than LiDAR. In\nthe Scanning category, we see that Huawei has exited the commercial market\n(along with their solid state lines), and most robotics companies are now\nstandardizing on Hesai or Ouster for 3D LiDAR, and SICK or Hokuyo for 2D\nLiDAR. This year\u2019s map adds two lower cost dev-oriented options - SlamTec (a\nlong time participant) and Unitree (new, and no doubt a result of their\nexpanding success in deploying their humanoid and animal form-factor robots).\n\n### LiDAR - Solid State\n\nAdditions to this year\u2019s map include Seyond (formerly Innovusion), and PreAct.\nBoth have been around for quite some time, and both are now starting to\ncommercialize their offerings. In particular, PreAct is notable for delivering\na flash LiDAR sensor for under $400. For those companies that once relied on\nthe Intel RealSense L515, the PreAct Mojave represents an interesting\nreplacement with a similar performance profile.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t see in LiDAR markets yet is any sort of massive, scaled\nadoption. Market leaders like Ouster/Veloydne and Luminar still have yet to\nfind high-growth customers with deployments in the hundreds of thousands and\nbeyond. Even passenger vehicle deployments such as Valeo\u2019s Scala LiDAR in\nMercedes Benz\u2019 DRIVE PILOT system, the Hesai AT128 in the new Lotus Eletre,\nand Luminar\u2019s delayed, yet upcoming debut in the Volvo EX90 aren\u2019t expected to\ndrive massive scale\n\n### Thermal\n\nWhile the participants in thermal sensing have remained stable since last\nyear\u2019s market map, we can confidently say from our own interactions with robot\nand autonomous vehicle companies that thermal sensing is one of the most\nintriguing modalities for the next generation of autonomy. In particular, the\nability to merge thermal sensing with standard RGB or mono cameras adds a\nperception backstop in low- to no-light conditions, and occluded conditions\nlike dense fog. We anticipate that this trend will continue, giving the\nfavorable price per unit for these sensors versus competing modalities like\nLiDAR and radar.\n\n### Radar\n\nFour or so years ago, mmWave and 4D radar were all the rage. Now, it seems\nthat investors have cooled on funding new radar startups, as scaled demand has\nyet to materialize. In the meantime, large OEMs like Continental and Bosch\nhave been building increasing market share with automotive companies to power\nL1/L2/L3 ADAS systems. Of note: after having sworn off radar to focus strictly\non camera-based ADAS, Tesla has chosen to reintroduce radar into the Model X\nand Model S. This is a high-resolution radar of their own design, but it has\nnot yet been activated. If so, it seems likely that it will be for discrete\ncapabilities such as forward collision avoidance.\n\n### Cameras - Embeddable\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted over the past few years, quite a few robotics companies are\nchoosing to \u201croll their own\u201d depth systems. When they do, they usually select\nan option from one of these manufacturers. For our own HiFi sensor, we\u2019ve\nchosen a set of optics from ams OSRAM. For those robotics and AV companies\nthat operate primarily in outdoor spaces, another rising trend is the\ndeployment of high dynamic range (or \u201cHDR\u201d) cameras that can operate more\neffectively on varied lighting conditions, from very dark to very bright.\n\n### Cameras - Industrial\n\nJust like with industrial 3D sensors, the industrial camera (aka \u201cmachine\nvision\u201d) sector has remained highly stable over the past decade. Due to their\nhigh cost and integration features focused more on industrial automation,\nthese industrial cameras are rarely found on mobile robots or autonomous\nvehicles, but can be found as accessories to pick-and-place robots and other\nfixed position factory robots.\n\n### Software\n\nWe\u2019re going to need to do something about this category. If there\u2019s one\ntakeaway from this year\u2019s map, it\u2019s that this sector is exploding with\nactivity, both from new entrants, as well as participants that have reached\nlevels of maturity that merit inclusion. In next year\u2019s market map, we\u2019ll\nlikely split these out into subcategories, such as: sensor fusion, SLAM, AI/ML\ntraining, and general purpose perception platforms. In this year\u2019s map, we see\nexpansion in the sensor fusion and AI/ML categories.\n\nWe believe that as robotics and autonomy companies mature and move towards\ndeploying at scale, much of the perception tooling they implemented during\ndevelopment will become a limiting factor \u2014 and this includes homegrown tools.\nAs a result, perception software companies (ourselves included) are now seeing\na decay of \u201cnot invented here\u201d approaches at robotics and AV companies, and a\nmuch greater willingness to use third party software to solve complex\nperception tasks.\n\n### IMU\n\nIn the world of autonomy, IMUs can be coarsely segmented into expensive,\nhigher accuracy all-in-one designs, and lower-cost, lower-accuracy chipset\nIMUs. Of note in the former category is the continued evolution of Movella,\nthe growing IMU conglomerate that was once mCube, Xsens and Kinduct. As a\nmerged entity, they now possess the scale and product scope to compete against\nheavyweight incumbents such as Honeywell and Lord Microstrain.\n\n### Emerging Technology\n\nFrom the market map\u2019s inception until last year, this category was dedicated\nto neuromorphic and event cameras. Unfortunately, this excluded a host of\nfascinating technologies that have been gaining interest from robotics and\nautonomy engineers. Hence, the new moniker of \u201cEmerging Technology\u201d, and the\ninclusion of interesting new players like Vayu Robotics (polarized long-range\ndepth sensing), Opteran (insect-inspired high-speed depth imaging), and\nDreamVu (mirror-based 360\u00b0 robot vision).\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen with neuromorphic cameras, it can take quite some time for these\nemerging technologies to gain acceptance for deployment in production. There\nis often a catch 22 where these new technologies arrive with high prices due\nto a lack of a scaled supply chain. Yet to achieve the adoption for a scaled\nsupply chain, prices must come down.\n\nAnd a quick note on neuromorphic cameras: one of the market leaders,\nInivation, has been acquired by neuromorpic software provider SynSense to\ncreate a joint software and hardware company driving further market adoption\nfor event cameras.\n\nAnd there we have it: our 2024 Perception Market Map. From an initial 75\ncompanies in 2021, it has now grown to include 105 companies, an increase of\n40%. Many sectors (like LiDAR and thermal cameras) have stabilized, but some\nsectors (like software and emerging technologies) have seen quite a bit of new\ncompany creation and growth. Overall, however, the picture is one of continued\nexpansion as the key markets served by perception (robotics, autonomous\nvehicles, and industrial automation) themselves continue to expand.\n\nDid we miss your company?
