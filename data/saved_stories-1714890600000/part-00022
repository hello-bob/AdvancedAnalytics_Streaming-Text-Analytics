Sadly, the weaponisation of lockdown as a pointscoring issue and\nemotional trigger has led to a conflation of lockdown with all other public\nhealth measures, most of which do not impinge on freedoms. Denial is a major\ntheme during the pandemic. Denial of airborne transmission, denial of science,\ndenial of Omicron being serious and denial about what it really means to \u201clive\nwith Covid-19\u201d.\n\nThe denial of the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was started by experts\non the World Health Organization infection control committee and allowed all\ncountries to take the easy way out. If handwashing is all you need, onus can\nbe shifted to \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d; if ventilation needs to be fixed,\nthat shifts responsibility to governments and private organisations. Australia\nonly acknowledged airborne transmission after the Delta epidemic in mid-2021,\nalmost a year after the WHO acknowledged it. Globally, 18 months was spent on\nhygiene theatre and actively discouraging mask use. As a result there is low\nawareness among the general public of the importance of ventilation and masks\nin reducing their personal risk.\n\nWe had effective campaigns on handwashing, but no campaigns of similar effect\nhave been used to empower people to control their own risk with simple\nmeasures such as opening a window. People living in apartments are largely\nunaware of the structural factors that make them high risk for transmission,\nor of the simple measures to reduce risk. The failure to focus on airborne\ntransmission has hampered the ability to control the spread and has endangered\nhealth workers. Correcting it is critical to the long-term sustainability of\nhealth, business and the economy. How can restaurants recover without a safe\nindoor air plan that may prevent a lockdown cycle that disrupts and ruins\ntheir business?\n\nDenial of Omicron being serious suits an exhausted community who just wish\nlife could go back to 2019. Omicron may be half as deadly as Delta, but Delta\nwas twice as deadly as the 2020 virus. Importantly, the WHO assesses the risk\nof Omicron as high and reiterates that adequate data on severity in\nunvaccinated people is not yet available. Even if hospitalisation, admissions\nto intensive care and death rates are half that of Delta, daily case numbers\nare 20-30 times higher \u2013 and projected to get to 200 times higher. A tsunami\nof cases will result in large hospitalisation numbers. It is already\noverwhelming health systems, which common colds and seasonal flu don\u2019t. Nor do\nthey result in ambulance wait times of hours for life-threatening conditions.\nIn addition, a tsunami of absenteeism in the workplace will worsen current\nshortages, supply chain disruptions and even critical infrastructure such as\npower. The ACTU has called for an urgent raft of measures to address the\nworkforce crisis.\n\nAs for denial of the risk in children, the majority of vaccine-preventable\ndiseases that we vaccinate children against are mild in most children. Only a\nsmall percentage suffer serious complications. Polio and measles are examples\nwhere well over 90 per cent of children who become infected do not have severe\ncomplications, but in a small percentage there are serious and potentially\nfatal complications. SARS-CoV-2 is similar. Other than long Covid and\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome, we are only now learning about other\nlonger-term complications of infection. For instance, there is more than\ndouble the risk of developing diabetes in children following Covid-19. A study\nfrom the United States showed the virus persisting in the brain, heart, lungs,\nkidneys and almost every other organ after the initial infection. A rare brain\ninflammation has been described in adults and children. Another study found a\nsignificant drop in cognitive function and IQ in survivors. The virus directly\nkills heart muscle. It is too early to know if Covid-19 will result in early\nonset dementia or heart failure in a decade\u2019s time, but the evidence warrants\na precautionary approach. We know some infections have very long-term\ncomplications \u2013 measles, for example, can cause a rare and fatal encephalitis\nabout 10 years after the initial infection. We should do everything possible\nto prevent mass infection of children and adults.\n\nDenial of the science of epidemiology is widespread, even among \u201cexperts\u201d. We\nare told repeatedly that SARS-CoV-2 will become \u201cendemic\u201d. But it will never\nbe endemic because it is an epidemic disease and always will be. The key\ndifference is spread. As an epidemic disease, SARS-CoV-2 will always find the\nunvaccinated, undervaccinated or people with waning immunity and spread\nrapidly in those groups. Typically, true epidemic infections are spread from\nperson to person, the worst being airborne transmission, and display a waxing\nand waning pattern such as we have already seen with multiple waves of SARS-\nCoV-2. Cases rise rapidly over days or weeks, as we have seen with Alpha,\nDelta and Omicron. No truly endemic disease \u2013 malaria, for example \u2013 does\nthis.\n\nThis is the reason governments prepare for pandemics. The propensity for\nepidemics to grow rapidly can stress the health system in a very short time.\nRespiratory epidemic infections follow this pattern unless eliminated by\nvaccination or mitigated by non-pharmaceutical measures. Natural infection has\nnever eliminated itself in recorded history. Not smallpox, which displayed the\nsame pattern over thousands of years, and not measles, which is still epidemic\nin many countries.\n\nThere is hope for better vaccines, schedules and spacing of doses, but we must\nbe agile and pivot with the evidence and have an ambitious strategy. The\ncurrent strategy is focused on vaccines only, with no attention on safe indoor\nair or other mitigating factors.\n\nEradication occurs when a disease no longer exists in the world \u2013 the only\nexample of this in humans is smallpox. Elimination is a technical term and\nmeans prevention of sustained community transmission. Countries that met WHO\nmeasles elimination criteria, including Australia, still see outbreaks of\nmeasles imported through travel, but when elimination is achieved, these do\nnot become uncontrollable.\n\nUnlike for measles, however, current vaccines do not provide lasting\nprotection. Masks and other public health measures are also needed to prevent\nthe recurrent disruption of epidemic waves. There is hope for better vaccines,\nschedules and spacing of doses, but we must be agile and pivot with the\nevidence and have an ambitious strategy. The current strategy is focused on\nvaccines only, with no attention on safe indoor air or other mitigating\nfactors. Instead, we have seen abandonment of test and trace because of\nfailure to plan ahead for the expected explosion of cases. Testing and tracing\nare pillars of epidemic control, and the WHO has called on countries to\nstrengthen both to deal with Omicron. Australia has done the opposite.\n\nWithout adequate case finding (which relies on testing at scale) and contact\ntracing, we are on a runaway train coming off the rails. Testing allows us to\nfind infected people and isolate them so they do not infect others. Now,\nduring the Omicron wave, testing is a massive failure. Both the federal and\nNew South Wales governments made a conscious decision to \u201clet it rip\u201d, but\nfailed to plan for adequate TTIQ (test, trace, isolate, quarantine) capacity.\nInstead, when it was clear testing capacity was exceeded, they restricted\ntesting to a small fraction of people. Very few people are now eligible for a\npolymerase chain reaction test (PCR), and rapid antigen tests (RATs) are in\nshort supply. While it has improved the optics by hiding the true scale of\ncases, this has allowed unfettered transmission.\n\nContact tracing is routinely used for many serious infections such as\ntuberculosis, meningococcal disease, measles or hepatitis A. It is conducted\nbecause close contacts are at highest risk of becoming infected next, and if\nthey are not identified and quarantined they will go on to infect others and\ncause exponential epidemic growth. Contacts need to be traced within 24-48\nhours to stop them infecting others. A range of digital contact-tracing\nmethods such as apps, QR codes and tracking digital footprints through other\nmeans can be used when case numbers are high. Yet NSW has removed and flip-\nflopped on QR codes.\n\nDenial of the reality of \u201cliving with Covid-19\u201d has seen us rush headlong into\nletting it rip in a largely unboosted population, with kids aged five to 11\nunvaccinated, without any planning for increased testing, tracing or even\nprocurement of promising new drugs to face the numbers that will come. The\nbooster program has not been expedited, with on Friday less than 17 per cent\nof the population aged 18 and over having had a third dose, and two doses\nbarely protective against symptomatic infection with Omicron. So Omicron has\ncaused business and hospitality to suffer mass cancellations. Mass absenteeism\nhas crippled supply chains, affecting food, diesel, postal services and almost\nevery other industry. The first serious impacts will be in regional and remote\nAustralia. We saw it in July, when vaccine supplies slated for remote towns\nwere diverted to Sydney, leaving Wilcannia, in the far west of NSW, a sitting\nduck for the epidemic to come.\n\nMany do not understand \u201cpublic health\u201d and equate it with provision of acute\nhealth care in public hospitals or confuse it with primary care. Public health\nis the organised response by society to protect and promote health, and to\nprevent illness, injury and disability. It is a core responsibility of\ngovernment.\n\nPublic health comprises three components. The first is \u201chealth protection\u201d,\nsuch as the banning of smoking in public places, seatbelt legislation or\nemergency powers that allow pandemic control measures such as lockdowns.\n\u201cHealth promotion\u201d refers to the process by which people are enabled to\nimprove or control their health, through the promotion of mask use, for\ninstance. The third component \u2013 \u201cdisease prevention and early detection\u201d \u2013\nincludes testing, surveillance, screening and prevention programs. Vaccination\nprograms are an example of disease prevention.\n\nDuring the pandemic we have seen resources committed to surge capacity for\nclinical medicine, but there has been a lack of understanding of the need for\npublic health surge capacity, including TTIQ. The price was paid in the\nVictorian second wave in 2020. Now, with the abandonment of contact tracing\nand restrictions on testing during the Omicron wave, we are seeing what\nhappens when this capacity is ignored by government.\n\nAnother outcome of these failures are the unscientific theories being pushed\nin many countries \u2013 such as the argument for \u201cherd immunity by natural\ninfection\u201d, which has become a household narrative during the pandemic despite\nfour pandemic waves providing little protection to date. The same people who\npeddled herd immunity by natural infection had no ambition to achieve herd\nimmunity by vaccination. Instead they tell us \u201cwe have to live with Covid-19\u201d\nand fall back on negative, defeatist messaging.\n\nThe least ambitious goal of vaccination is to prevent us from dying, and that\nis the low bar set in Australia. This has reduced policy outcomes to a false\nbinary of dead or alive. There is no concern in this for First Nations people,\nthe disabled, people with chronic medical conditions, people in remote\nAustralia or even children, who are being sent back to school at the peak of\nthe pandemic while primary-schoolers are largely unvaccinated. The hundreds of\naged-care outbreaks pass without comment in what essentially has become\nsurvival of the fittest and richest.\n\nThe vaccine game is dynamic and ever-changing. Some countries have used\nambitious, determined, organised strategies for vaccination and adapted\nquickly as the evidence has changed. We know the mRNA vaccines can greatly\nreduce transmission, but current vaccines were developed against the original\nWuhan strain and, even after two doses, efficacy wanes. Omicron-matched\nboosters are in the wind, a seed of hope and a reason to be ambitious, but\nthat will require agile vaccination policy.\n\nThere is a massive vaccine and drug development effort, so it is almost\ncertain we will have better vaccine options, including ones that are variant-\nproof. But what the past month has shown us is we cannot live with unmitigated\nCovid-19. Vaccinations will not be enough. We need a ventilation and vaccine-\nplus strategy to avoid the disruptive epidemic cycle, to protect health and\nthe economy, and to regain a semblance of the life we all want.\n\nThis article was first published in the print edition of The Saturday Paper on\nJanuary 15, 2022 as \"A pandemic of denial\".\n\nFor almost a decade, The Saturday Paper has published Australia\u2019s leading\nwriters and thinkers.
