Now,\nscientists have created a precise clock that, when put through its paces\naboard a naval ship, wavered by only 300-trillionths of a second per day.\n\nSuch a precise but portable clock could be used to improve research that\nrequires precise timing in the field, including mapping Earth\u2019s gravitational\nfield and using multiple telescopes to image black holes.\n\nThe clock, which was detailed in a paper in Nature on 24 April^1, could also\nprovide a \u201cvital fallback solution\u201d if signals from global navigation systems\nare spoofed or jammed in conflict zones, says Tetsuya Ido, director of the\nSpace-Time Standards Laboratory at the Radio Research Institute in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d says Elizabeth Donley, who heads the time and frequency\ndivision at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder,\nColorado. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to get our hands on it.\u201d\n\n## Atomic tick-tock\n\nThe \u2018tick\u2019 of the world\u2019s best clocks is pegged to the frequency of the\nradiation that atoms absorb and emit as they oscillate between energy states.\nClocks based on atoms of caesium and other elements that emit radiation at a\nmicrowave frequency have been used for decades. Some are portable and are sold\ncommercially.\n\nHow climate change is affecting global timekeeping\n\nScientists have also developed clocks that use other elements, such as\nstrontium, that emit at higher frequencies \u2014 visible light \u2014 to slice time\neven more finely. But these \u2018optical\u2019 clocks are usually the size of dining\ntables and operate well only under laboratory-controlled conditions.\n\nVector Atomic, an engineering firm based in Pleasanton, California, has\ncreated an optical clock that weighs only 26 kilograms and, including all its\nhousing, takes up about the size of three shoe boxes. Although the firm\u2019s\nclock is inferior to the best lab-based optical timekeepers, its precision is\n1,000 times better than that of the similar sized clocks that ships currently\nuse, says company co-founder Jamil Abo-Shaeer, a co-author of the study.\n\nThe team tested its system by placing three of the clocks aboard the Royal New\nZealand Navy ship HMNZS Aotearoa during a three-week trip around the Hawaiian\nIslands. Despite the ship\u2019s vibrations and rolling, the clocks performed\nalmost as well as they had in the laboratory. They were notably stable,\nkeeping time to within 300-trillionths of a second over a day.\n\nDonley says this stability is similar to that of a hydrogen maser clock \u2014 a\nreliable kind of microwave atomic clock that is the workhorse for\ninternational timekeeping. But the clock is much more robust and around one\ntenth of the volume.\n\n## Fly me to the Moon\n\nThe clock\u2019s robustness comes in part from its use of iodine molecules, which\ncan be made to oscillate using compact and durable lasers of the type commonly\nused in labs. The molecules are also less sensitive than some atoms to\ntemperature fluctuations, magnetic fields and pressure, says physicist Martin\nBoyd, a co-founder of Vector Atomic and co-author of the paper.\n\nIf the team can shrink the clock further, future models could fly aboard\nglobal navigation satellites, improving positioning resolution from metres to\ncentimetres, adds Abo-Shaeer. They could even be the clocks that end up\ndefining lunar time, he says.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01166-6\n\nRead the related News & Views: \u2018Robust optical clocks promise stable timing in\na portable package\u2019\n\n## References\n\n  1.
