He said: \"It's thoroughly contemporary and more expressive\nthan any of our existing models.\"\n\nThe former Bentley design boss said efforts have been made to provide the new\nconcept with human-like qualities through light animations, including a\nwelcome function for the headlights that mimic the blinking of eyes.\n\n\"We wanted to give the ID Code a warm human-like touch. It should provide\nvisual attachment the moment you see it. It is not robotic and cold,\" he told\nAutocar.\n\nThe light animations are conceived to be altered every three months to freshen\nthe look of the car via over-the-air software updates on a subscription basis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Latest Reviews\n\n##### GWM Ora 03\n\n6\n\nGWM Ora 03\n\n##### Porsche Macan Electric\n\n8\n\nPorsche Macan Electric\n\n##### Used Vauxhall Corsa 2014-2019 review\n\n8\n\nUsed Vauxhall Corsa 2014-2019 review\n\n##### Audi S3\n\n7\n\nAudi S3\n\n##### Audi A3 Sportback\n\n8\n\nAudi A3 Sportback\n\nView all car reviews\n\nBack to top\n\nThe clean, low front end features an undercut design without a traditional\ngrille, which progresses into a long bonnet, raked windscreen and a curved\nroofline, giving the new Volkswagen concept more traditional proportions than\nexisting, cab-forward ID models. This is further accentuated by a high\nwaistline and a relatively shallow glasshouse.\n\nOther distinguishing elements include prominent front wheel arches and rear\nhaunches above large wheelhouses all round. An extended wheelbase also helps\nto shorten the overhangs, while wide tracks provide a muscular stance and\nshould boost stability on the move.\n\nAs part of Volkswagen's efforts to match its Chinese rivals on digital\nfunctionality, an avatar appears on the driver's side window when you approach\nwith the key, providing information on the traffic and weather conditions, as\npart of what Volkswagen calls its Smart Window Concept.\n\nThe ID Code has a heavily angled back window and horizontal brake lights that\nmirror the headlights, all hosted in a shooting brake-style tailgate and\ndecorated with an illuminated logo.\n\nThere is heavy tapering to the corners, backing up Mindt's claims that the new\nconcept has been developed as much for style as outright space.\n\nAlong with its progressive exterior styling, the 4800mm-long concept also\npreviews a new driver-centric interior design, based around AI-supported\ninfotainment functions and advanced level-four autonomous driving capability -\nthe latter function signalled by lidar units that light up the exterior of the\ncar when it\u2019s driving itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to top\n\nCreated to support a diverse range of electric lifestyle-oriented models, the\nID UX electric car sub-brand is intended to appeal to a younger audience than\nVolkswagen's existing range of ID models.\n\n\"The ID Code gives the first glimpse of the future of Volkswagen in China,\"\nsaid Sch\u00e4fer. \"It is part of a sharpened brand experience aimed at tapping\ninto new customer groups in China.\"\n\nThe ideas, technology and processes behind the new concept have been developed\nto bring future Volkswagen models into closer competition with those from both\nestablished Chinese car makers and newer electric car start-ups such as Nio,\nXpeng, Aito and Li Auto.\n\nAlthough the new design language has been conceived for models to be sold in\nChina, insiders at Volkswagen's design headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, say\ndiscussions are already under way as to how it may influence future models\nplanned for sale in Europe.\n\n\"We've shown how we will progress the look of electric models for Europe with\nthe ID 2 and ID 2 GTI. They're more traditional in terms of styling,\" said\nMindt. \"However, we are not ruling out a car like the ID Code being introduced\nto other markets in the future. For now, though, it is only planned for\nChina.\"\n\nThe first model in the ID UX line-up is the ID Unyx - a rebadged version of\nthe Cupra Tavascan produced at a joint-venture factory operated in partnership\nwith JAC in the Chinese city of Hefei.\n\nAn extension of the existing ID line-up conceived exclusively for the Chinese\nmarket, it forms an integral part of Volkswagen's 'In China, for China'\nstrategy.\n\nAt the unveiling of the ID Code, Volkswagen revealed the ID line-up will grow\nto a total of 16 models by 2030, including five models from the ID UX range.\n\nDespite the heavy focus on its electric car offerings, however, the German car\nmaker says it remains committed to combustion vehicles, with plans to expand\nits line-up in China with 12 new petrol models and six new plug-in-hybrids -\nthe latter all offering an electric range of more than 62 miles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to top\n\nIn addition to models based on its existing MQB (ICE) and MEB (EV) platforms,\nit plans to launch new models on the EE electric car platform being developed\nin partnership with Xpeng as well as a new electric car platform that goes\nunder the name China Main Platform (CMP) from 2026.\n\nVolkswagen has also teamed with Horizon Robotics and Thundersoft in China for\nthe development of autonomous driving, infotainment and connectivity features.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * Car news\n  * New cars\n  * Motor shows\n  * Beijing motor show\n  * Volkswagen\n\n##\n\nused Volkswagen cars for salePowered By\n\nVolkswagen Passat 2.0 TDI BlueMotion Tech Sport DSG Euro 5 (s/s) 4dr\n\n2011\n\n\u00a33,995\n\n126,000miles\n\nDiesel\n\nAutomatic\n\n4\n\nVolkswagen Polo 1.4 Match Edition DSG Euro 5 5dr\n\n2013\n\n\u00a39,497\n\n26,295miles\n\nPetrol\n\nAutomatic\n\n5\n\nVolkswagen Passat 2.0 TDI R-Line DSG Euro 6 (s/s) 5dr\n\n2017\n\n\u00a313,750\n\n85,000miles\n\nDiesel\n\nAutomatic\n\n5\n\nVolkswagen Polo 1.2 R-Line Style Euro 5 3dr\n\n2013\n\n\u00a35,995\n\n70,350miles\n\nPetrol\n\nManual\n\n3\n\nVolkswagen Polo 1.0 TSI SE DSG Euro 6 (s/s) 5dr\n\n2018\n\n\u00a313,995\n\n18,000miles\n\nPetrol\n\nAutomatic\n\n5\n\nVolkswagen T-Roc 1.6 TDI Design Euro 6 (s/s) 5dr\n\n2019\n\n\u00a311,495\n\n109,000miles\n\nDiesel\n\nManual\n\n5\n\nVolkswagen Polo 1.0 TSI SE DSG Euro 6 (s/s) 5dr\n\n2019\n\n\u00a313,450\n\n30,435miles\n\nPetrol\n\nAutomatic\n\n5\n\nVolkswagen Passat 1.5 TSI EVO S Euro 6 (s/s) 4dr\n\n2019\n\n\u00a312,498\n\n51,404miles\n\nPetrol\n\nManual\n\n4\n\nVolkswagen Tiguan 1.4 TSI 13kWh Elegance DSG Euro 6 (s/s) 5dr\n\n2023\n\n\u00a334,998\n\n5,679miles\n\nPetrol Plug-in Hybrid\n\nAutomatic\n\n5\n\nNext\n\nPrev\n\nView all 27408 cars\n\nPowered By\n\n#### Newsletter\n\nGet all the best car news, reviews and opinions direct to your inbox three\ntimes a week.

It would be nice if it really does influence some of the\nlarger ID models when they get replaced, though they can leave the blinking\nheadlights and animated windows for the Chinese audience, thank you very much.\n\n  * Log in or register to post comments\n\n#### Latest Reviews\n\n##### GWM Ora 03\n\n6\n\nGWM Ora 03\n\n##### Porsche Macan Electric\n\n8\n\nPorsche Macan Electric\n\n##### Used Vauxhall Corsa 2014-2019 review\n\n8\n\nUsed Vauxhall Corsa 2014-2019 review\n\n##### Audi S3\n\n7\n\nAudi S3\n\n##### Audi A3 Sportback\n\n8\n\nAudi A3 Sportback\n\nView all car reviews\n\n#### More from Autocar\n\n#### Top 10s\n\n  * The 10 best SUVs\n  * The 10 best electric cars\n  * The 10 best family SUVs\n  * The 10 best hatchbacks\n  * The 10 best superminis\n\n#### Latest car reviews\n\n  * Nissan Qashqai\n  * Porsche Panamera\n  * Volkswagen Polo\n  * Audi Q3\n  * Porsche Cayenne\n\n#### Top manufacturers\n\n  * Porsche\n  * Volkswagen\n  * Nissan\n  * Jeep\n  * Dacia\n\nSign up to our newsletter\n\nSubscribe to Autocar magazine\n\n#### Quick search\n\n  * Best cars\n  * Latest news\n  * Latest videos\n  * Used cars for sale\n  * Latest car reviews\n\n#### We recommend\n\n  * Geneva motor show\n  * What Car?\n  * New Car Deals\n  * Classic & Sports Car\n  * Autocar Archive\n  * Move Electric\n\n#### Legal bits\n\n  * Terms and conditions\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Complaints\n  * Cookie Settings\n\n#### About Autocar\n\n  * Why you can trust Autocar\n  * How Autocar tests cars\n  * Get in touch\n  * RSS feed\n  * Sitemap\n\nAutocar is part of Haymarket Automotive, a division of Haymarket Media Group \u00a9\nHaymarket Media Group 2022\n\nFollow Autocar on our social channels\n\n## Cookie and Privacy Notice\n\nWe and 3rd parties store and/or access information on your device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies, and process personal data so we can provide you with\nthe best possible experience, personalise ads and content based on your\ninterests, provide social media features and to analyse website usage.
