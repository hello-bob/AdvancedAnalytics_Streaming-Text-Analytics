So when the\nracialized claims started over how calling the default branch in Git\nrepositories \"master\" was PrObLEmAtIC, I thought, fine, what skin is it off\nanyone's or my back to change? If this is really important, can make a real\ndifference, great. Let's do it.\n\nHow naive.\n\nThis was a classic exploit of good faith, and I fell for it.\n\nChanging master to main changed less than nothing. Because nothing was or is\never enough in this arena. As soon as this word battle was won, it was just on\nto the next and the next (and the next).\n\nBut the upside of being hit by an exploit like this is that you eventually end\nup with a patch that closes the hole. And rest assured, this hole in our\ncollective good faith is now closed. People are not going to be this gullible\ntwice. I am not going to be this gullible twice.\n\nNext time the firewall will be ready.\n\nAbout David Heinemeier Hansson\n\nMade Basecamp and HEY for the underdogs as co-owner and CTO of 37signals.\nCreated Ruby on Rails.
