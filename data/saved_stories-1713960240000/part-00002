Unfortunately, this is a myth that\nis not true in almost all situations.You should only close an app in the\nquick-launch (App Switcher) screen if it is \"misbehaving\" - not working right,\nor if it is using energy (as per Settings/Battery) and you don't need it at\nthe present time. There are several reasons you should not close apps. The\nhighlights are:\n\n  * First and foremost, they are not \u201crunning\u201d in background. They are suspended.\n  * It doesn't do any good - there is nothing to be gained.\n  * It does not help battery life. To get an idea of how little would be saved by closing apps you can use Settings/Battery, as described here: How much battery energy does each app use? What this doesn't show is that it actually worsens battery life, because it takes more energy to load an app than to restart it from the \"multitasking\" screen.\n  * It does not make your phone faster (it actually makes it slower, because it takes longer to initialize an app from storage than to restart it from a suspended state).\n  * It does not \"clean up\" RAM memory (iOS is the expert about managing RAM; neither you nor any \u201ccleanup\u201d app can possibly \"outthink\" it and do a better job)\n\nThis last one is the easiest to explain; Older iPhones have 1 GB RAM; a few\nhave 2 GB. The latest have 3 GB. That's it. If you have, say, 100 apps listed\nif you double-press the HOME button (or equivalent on phones that don't have\none: How to force an app to close on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch - Apple\nSupport) only the most recent 3 or 4 are in RAM at all; the rest of RAM holds\niOS and its data. The remaining apps on the list are back on the storage\nmedium, with only an entry in a table of open apps so they can be reloaded\nfaster. And, as the first bullet says, NONE of them are \"running\"; they are\nall suspended, not using power, not using any other resources.\n\nThere has been a lot written about this subject; if you don't want to take my\nword for it, see these links from other experts.\n\n  * How about an expert from Apple: Apple\u2019s software SVP says quitting multitasking apps not necessary, won\u2019t offer improved battery life\n  * Still not convinced? See:Daring Fireball: Public Service Announcement: You Should Not Force Quit Apps on iOS\n  * Finally:No, Closing Background Apps on Your iPhone or iPad Won\u2019t Make It Faster\n\nUpvote if this User Tip is helpful\n\nDownvote if this User Tip isn\u2019t helpful\n\n## Comments\n\nUser profile for user: askbarnabas\n\naskbarnabas\n\nUser level: Level 10\n\n(103,539 points)\n\nSep 4, 2018 5:25 PM\n\nI think you covered every base.\n\nSep 4, 2018 5:25 PM\n\nUser profile for user: SnickZ.\n\nSnickZ.\n\nUser level: Community Specialist\n\nMay 9, 2022 11:43 AM\n\nHey, Lawrence Finch, great UserTip!
