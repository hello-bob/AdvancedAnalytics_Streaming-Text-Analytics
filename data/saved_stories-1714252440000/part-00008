This is partly an occupational hazard, as someone who\nreads and reviews books professionally; they often come to me unbidden, mailed\nby publicists and publishers. But I\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s also a personal vice.\nPlucking a book from a little free library or buying one (or two) at my\nneighbourhood bookstore is a reliable pick-me-up, and like everyone else\nenduring the present, I am in perpetual need of a little treat to get through\nthe week. Books have always occupied a special status among my possessions, an\nexemption from the guilt of consumption that strikes when I purchase a\nlipstick but never a paperback. Buying books feels wholesome, even virtuous. I\nlike to tell myself that I\u2019m doing my part to keep the publishing industry\nalive, as if my steady acquisitions are chest compressions for an ailing\npatient.\n\nUsually, I read these new books, but not always. My interest is usurped by\nlibrary books, with their urgent loan periods, or forthcoming releases I\u2019m\nreviewing for work, or a TV series that I\u2019m binging instead of reading\nanything at all. Have you seen Deadloch? It\u2019s fantastic. By the season finale,\nthe book I meant to read has been supplanted on my nightstand by another\nrecent addition. The pile beside my bed never shrinks; at the bottom of the\nstack are books I\u2019ve been planning to crack open for months. My shelves remain\nfull of lingering aspirations.\n\nI doubt I\u2019m the only person with this problem. BookNet Canada, a nonprofit\nthat collects data and produces research on the publishing industry, found\nthat almost a third of surveyed Canadians read daily for leisure in 2022. Last\nyear, we collectively bought nearly 49 million books. And we prefer books that\ntake up space: physical volumes remain much more popular among readers of all\nages, compared to ebooks or audiobooks. Still, the majority of readers are\nfinishing fewer than one book each month\u2014the rest, I assume, are accumulating\nin a shameful stack beside the bed.\n\n  * Indigo May Have Lost the Plot\n  * The Case for Never Reading the Book Jacket\n  * How Do You Even Sell a Book Anymore?\n\nFor some, unread books aren\u2019t an issue as long as they fulfill their implicit\nsecondary function: as decorative objects and social signifiers. The pandemic\nonly made this more conspicuous, as many of us have been compelled by Zoom,\nGoogle Meet, and the like to stage our private spaces for public viewing. In\nApril 2020, a Twitter account called Bookcase Credibility began documenting\nand scrutinizing the ubiquitous bookshelves on display behind public figures\nas they gave media interviews or sat for photographers. As journalist Amanda\nHess observed, \u201cthe bookcase offers both a visually pleasing surface and a\ngesture at intellectual depth.\u201d\n\nAdmitting that one thinks of books as mere decor never fails to elicit\ndisdain, like when the actress Ashley Tisdale confessed in 2022 that she asked\nher husband to buy 400 books to stage their home for an Architectural Digest\nphotoshoot. But Hess points out that many people use books this way all the\ntime. After all, she says, \u201cthe expert could choose to speak in front of his\nart prints or his television or his blank white walls, but he chooses to be\nframed by his books.\u201d Books have talismanic power beyond the professional\nrealm. In 2023, a Bustle editorial went viral for suggesting that \u201cthe\nthirstiest thing a man can do is read\u201d and quoted a woman who went home with a\nguy because she spied him reading Michelle Zauner\u2019s memoir, Crying in H Mart,\nat the bar. Just displaying a book is enough to unlock its erotic potential.\nDirector John Waters once said, \u201cIf you go home with someone and they don\u2019t\nhave books, don\u2019t fuck them.\u201d Whether or not that person actually read them is\na different story.\n\nEveryone knows that our consumption habits are problematic and environmentally\ndestructive: Canadians send more than a billion pounds of clothing, shoes,\ntoys, and household items to the dump each year. But we have a hard time\nseeing books as mass-produced consumer items that ought to be consumed more\nthoughtfully, even though that\u2019s what they are. A book is different from a\npair of shoes or a scented candle\u2014but is it that different? The kinds of\nexcess we permit\u2014even exalt\u2014for books is unheard of for other categories of\npossessions. Even speaking of books as a consumer good feels vulgar, but I\nwonder if this sanctimonious attitude deprives them of their true value.\n\nI try to use anything I buy as much as possible, and it\u2019s always satisfying to\nreach the end of a tube of lip balm, scrape the last bit of peanut butter out\nof a jar, or burn a candle down to a crater of wax. Why shouldn\u2019t we aspire to\nwear our books out too? A Valentine\u2019s Day feature by the New York Times, which\nsurveyed New Yorkers about their romantic gestures, included one participant\nwho triggered an outpouring of online opprobrium by describing a fairly\nmundane practice among backpackers: ripping pages out of a book in order to\nread it in tandem with a partner. But isn\u2019t that a better fate for a book than\nbeing relegated to a shelf as Zoom decor? And if we\u2019re never going to read\nthem, shouldn\u2019t we let them go?\n\nThis is easier said than done. A single volume is easy enough to offload:\nslide it across the table while you\u2019re out for dinner with a friend, or stick\nit in one of the many little free libraries that have sprung up across Canada.\n(As of March 2024, there were 3,875 little free libraries registered across\nthe country, an increase of 29 percent in the past two years alone.) But if\nyou have a lot of books, you\u2019ll quickly discover that almost nobody wants\nthem, especially if they\u2019re old. The public libraries in Toronto and Halifax\nwill accept some books that are less than five years old, but they appear to\nbe outliers; many public library systems won\u2019t take donations at all. Used\nbookstores, understandably, only want books that they think someone else will\nbuy. My neighbourhood thrift store owner recently lamented that people are\nalways trying to dump carloads of dusty volumes on him; he\u2019s had to implement\na \u201cno books\u201d policy to keep things from getting out of hand. The way he\ndescribed the problem made me think of feral rabbits: one or two is no big\ndeal, but invariably they multiply.\n\nThe crudest solution is to take them to a big thrift store, the kind that\naccepts anything you can stuff in a trash bag or cardboard box: Value Village,\nthe Salvation Army, Goodwill. But then you\u2019re just outsourcing the physical\nand psychological labour of throwing them away yourself, as thrift stores\nswiftly cycle through an endless stream of donations by discarding unsold\nitems. In 2022, there was a public outcry after a Quebec high school filled a\ndumpster with unsold books that had been donated to a book fair fundraiser;\nsome locals even clambered inside to rescue Danielle Steel paperbacks and old\nalmanacs. (The school principal, nonplussed by the response, told the CBC that\nsuch recycling happens after each annual book fair.)\n\nAs growing numbers of school libraries across Canada are called upon to\nrestrict access to certain books, often ones with content about sexuality or\ngender identity, it\u2019s understandable that many of us feel protective. Stories\nare important, and worth defending, particularly in a moment when many of them\nseem threatened by intolerance. Still, it\u2019s a stretch to extend that\ncollective fight for literary freedom and expression to my personal reluctance\nto throw out a water-stained paperback edition of Douglas Coupland\u2019s\nGirlfriend in a Coma, which I didn\u2019t even like very much when I read it twenty\nyears ago. But I\u2019m nostalgic for my teenage self, who found it in a used\nbookshop and admittedly dropped it in the bath once; she\u2019s still in there,\ntucked between the warped pages. The truth is that books do have a kind of\nanimating power to summon long-held memories, emotions, and ambitions. My\nbooks are an archive of who I\u2019ve been, who I might be, who I still hope to\nbecome: maybe a person who has read all of Roberto Bola\u00f1o\u2019s hulking posthumous\nnovel 2666, which I\u2019ve been intending to finish for well over a decade now.\n\nAs a category of objects, books never expire or go out of fashion, and so I\nhave the rest of my life to make it through that stack beside my bed. But I\u2019m\ntrying to let more of them go, read or unread, while they still have value\u2014at\nleast for a single person to deploy as seductive props. Other books might be\ndestined for the recycling bin, if I can finally work up the nerve. At the end\nof the day, a book is just paper and ink and glue. Its soul is something else\nentirely, less tangible but more enduring than an object on a shelf.\n\nMichelle Cyca\n\nMichelle Cyca is a contributing writer for The Walrus.\n\nWe are Canada\u2019s reader-supported conversation.\n\nDid you know that The Walrus is a registered charity?
