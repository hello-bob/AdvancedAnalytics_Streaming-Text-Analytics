Everything I've written sits on this site.\n\nI control that data^[3], it sits on infrastructure I manage, it's in a format\nI understand and I get the responsibility (or fun \u2014 let's go with that) of\npresenting it. I get agency and that agency is accompanied by the burden of\nmaintenance, presentation and action. Convenience in exchange for control.\n\nI'm happy with this bargain and, while this might be ambitious, I'd like to\nmove more data into spaces I control. I also want to be very careful with how\nI approach this. Perhaps my TV and movie watching habits will be next but the\nmetadata that comes with owning and presenting that seems even more daunting\nthan music.^[4]\n\nDoing this isn't as approachable as it should be \u2014 making it approachable is\nsomething we should all be working towards.\n\nThe flip side of this is minimizing data that you share \u2014 an ever more\ndaunting prospect in the face of a technology industry that's repositioned\nitself as an inescapable data vacuum that's yielded a haunting internet-scale\nsucking sound and experience.\n\nData brokers shouldn't exist. Full stop.\n\nSocial graphs and posts are held hostage on increasingly irrelevant platforms.\n\nDid you want more ads? Here, have more ads. Take a chatbot too and then, maybe\n\u2014 if we're lucky \u2014 ads in the chatbot.\n\nThe baseline approach to the internet at this point should be that the\ncompanies that populate it are user hostile and they'll demand of you both\nyour time and attention. You should block whatever ads you can, you should\ndelete accounts you don't anymore, use websites when the app is functionally\nthe same or similar^[5] and you should be hesitant to sign up for new services\nunless you need to. Block crawlers where you can but expect bad faith from\ncompanies claiming a right to anything they can access.\n\nPut your guard up, cede less and work towards a better web.\n\nTake a look at the GitHub repository for this project. (And give it a star if\nyou feel like it.)\n\n  1. I send data to ListenBrainz and Last.fm but Last.fm's ownership, age and general state of maintenance or lack thereof makes me nervous. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  2. I'm not going to trust GoodReads \u2014 I'll reference it. The data itself is simple enough to stored. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  3. Ok \u2014 I don't own the hardware, but I'm going to avoid that rabbit hole for the sake of getting my thoughts out here. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  4. Or perhaps I'm simply more familiar with music metadata. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  5. Nothing like a website repackaged with more telemetry and push notifications. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\nDiscuss on Mastodon\n\n## Popular posts\n\n  * Minimalism as self-preservation\n  * We've stopped making things anyone wants\n  * Go ahead and block AI web crawlers\n  * A retrospective on a year without streaming music\n  * Data ownership and agency\n\n## Recent links\n\n  * The invisible seafaring industry that keeps the internet afloat\n  * Does everything need to be an ad?\n  * How I translate your words\n  * Cross-Posting with EchoFeed\n  * What you see\n\n", "frontpage": false}
