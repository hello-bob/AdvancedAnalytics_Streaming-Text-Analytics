Rigid. Clumsy.\n\nHenry and Jane Evans are used to awkward houseguests. For more than a decade,\nthe couple, who live in Los Altos Hills, California, have hosted a slew of\nrobots in their home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2002, at age 40, Henry had a massive stroke, which left him with\nquadriplegia and an inability to speak. Since then, he\u2019s learned how to\ncommunicate by moving his eyes over a letter board, but he is highly reliant\non caregivers and his wife, Jane.\n\nHenry got a glimmer of a different kind of life when he saw Charlie Kemp on\nCNN in 2010. Kemp, a robotics professor at Georgia Tech, was on TV talking\nabout PR2, a robot developed by the company Willow Garage. PR2 was a massive\ntwo-armed machine on wheels that looked like a crude metal butler. Kemp was\ndemonstrating how the robot worked, and talking about his research on how\nhealth-care robots could help people. He showed how the PR2 robot could hand\nsome medicine to the television host.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, Henry turns to me and says, \u2018Why can\u2019t that robot be an\nextension of my body?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d Jane says.\n\nThere was a solid reason why not. While engineers have made great progress in\ngetting robots to work in tightly controlled environments like labs and\nfactories, the home has proved difficult to design for. Out in the real, messy\nworld, furniture and floor plans differ wildly; children and pets can jump in\na robot\u2019s way; and clothes that need folding come in different shapes, colors,\nand sizes. Managing such unpredictable settings and varied conditions has been\nbeyond the capabilities of even the most advanced robot prototypes.\n\n## Related Story\n\nAI literacy might be ChatGPT\u2019s biggest lesson for schools\n\nPlus: The complex math of counterfactuals could help Spotify pick your next\nfavorite song.\n\nThat seems to finally be changing, in large part thanks to artificial\nintelligence. For decades, roboticists have more or less focused on\ncontrolling robots\u2019 \u201cbodies\u201d\u2014their arms, legs, levers, wheels, and the\nlike\u2014via purpose-driven software. But a new generation of scientists and\ninventors believes that the previously missing ingredient of AI can give\nrobots the ability to learn new skills and adapt to new environments faster\nthan ever before. This new approach, just maybe, can finally bring robots out\nof the factory and into our homes.\n\nProgress won\u2019t happen overnight, though, as the Evanses know far too well from\ntheir many years of using various robot prototypes.\n\nPR2 was the first robot they brought in, and it opened entirely new skills for\nHenry. It would hold a beard shaver and Henry would move his face against it,\nallowing him to shave and scratch an itch by himself for the first time in a\ndecade. But at 450 pounds (200 kilograms) or so and $400,000, the robot was\ndifficult to have around. \u201cIt could easily take out a wall in your house,\u201d\nJane says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a big fan.\u201d\n\nMore recently, the Evanses have been testing out a smaller robot called\nStretch, which Kemp developed through his startup Hello Robot. The first\niteration launched during the pandemic with a much more reasonable price tag\nof around $18,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStretch weighs about 50 pounds. It has a small mobile base, a stick with a\ncamera dangling off it, and an adjustable arm featuring a gripper with suction\ncups at the ends. It can be controlled with a console controller. Henry\ncontrols Stretch using a laptop, with a tool that that tracks his head\nmovements to move a cursor around. He is able to move his thumb and index\nfinger enough to click a computer mouse. Last summer, Stretch was with the\ncouple for more than a month, and Henry says it gave him a whole new level of\nautonomy. \u201cIt was practical, and I could see using it every day,\u201d he says.\n\nHenry Evans used the Stretch robot to brush his hair, eat, and even play with\nhis granddaughter.\n\nPETER ADAMS\n\nUsing his laptop, he could get the robot to brush his hair and have it hold\nfruit kebabs for him to snack on. It also opened up Henry\u2019s relationship with\nhis granddaughter Teddie. Before, they barely interacted. \u201cShe didn\u2019t hug him\nat all goodbye. Nothing like that,\u201d Jane says. But \u201cPapa Wheelie\u201d and Teddie\nused Stretch to play, engaging in relay races, bowling, and magnetic fishing.\n\nStretch doesn\u2019t have much in the way of smarts: it comes with some\npreinstalled software, such as the web interface that Henry uses to control\nit, and other capabilities such as AI-enabled navigation. The main benefit of\nStretch is that people can plug in their own AI models and use them to do\nexperiments. But it offers a glimpse of what a world with useful home robots\ncould look like. Robots that can do many of the things humans do in the\nhome\u2014tasks such as folding laundry, cooking meals, and cleaning\u2014have been a\ndream of robotics research since the inception of the field in the 1950s. For\na long time, it\u2019s been just that: \u201cRobotics is full of dreamers,\u201d says Kemp.\n\nBut the field is at an inflection point, says Ken Goldberg, a robotics\nprofessor at the University of California, Berkeley. Previous efforts to build\na useful home robot, he says, have emphatically failed to meet the\nexpectations set by popular culture\u2014think the robotic maid from The Jetsons.\nNow things are very different. Thanks to cheap hardware like Stretch, along\nwith efforts to collect and share data and advances in generative AI, robots\nare getting more competent and helpful faster than ever before. \u201cWe\u2019re at a\npoint where we\u2019re very close to getting capability that is really going to be\nuseful,\u201d Goldberg says.\n\nFolding laundry, cooking shrimp, wiping surfaces, unloading shopping\nbaskets\u2014today\u2019s AI-powered robots are learning to do tasks that for their\npredecessors would have been extremely difficult.\n\n### Missing pieces\n\nThere\u2019s a well-known observation among roboticists: What is hard for humans is\neasy for machines, and what is easy for humans is hard for machines. Called\nMoravec\u2019s paradox, it was first articulated in the 1980s by Hans Moravec,\nthena roboticist at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. A\nrobot can play chess or hold an object still for hours on end with no problem.\nTying a shoelace, catching a ball, or having a conversation is another matter.\n\nThere are three reasons for this, says Goldberg. First, robots lack precise\ncontrol and coordination. Second, their understanding of the surrounding world\nis limited because they are reliant on cameras and sensors to perceive it.\nThird, they lack an innate sense of practical physics.\n\n\u201cPick up a hammer, and it will probably fall out of your gripper, unless you\ngrab it near the heavy part. But you don\u2019t know that if you just look at it,\nunless you know how hammers work,\u201d Goldberg says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn top of these basic considerations, there are many other technical things\nthat need to be just right, from motors to cameras to Wi-Fi connections, and\nhardware can be prohibitively expensive.\n\nMechanically, we\u2019ve been able to do fairly complex things for a while. In a\nvideo from 1957, two large robotic arms are dexterous enough to pinch a\ncigarette, place it in the mouth of a woman at a typewriter, and reapply her\nlipstick. But the intelligence and the spatial awareness of that robot came\nfrom the person who was operating it.\n\nIn a video from 1957, a man operates two large robotic arms and uses the\nmachine to apply a woman\u2019s lipstick. Robots have come a long way since.\n\n\u201cLIGHTER SIDE OF THE NEWS --ATOMIC ROBOT A HANDY GUY\u201d (1957) VIA YOUTUBE\n\n\u201cThe missing piece is: How do we get software to do [these things]\nautomatically?\u201d says Deepak Pathak, an assistant professor of computer science\nat Carnegie Mellon.\n\nResearchers training robots have traditionally approached this problem by\nplanning everything the robot does in excruciating detail. Robotics giant\nBoston Dynamics used this approach when it developed its boogying and\nparkouring humanoid robot Atlas. Cameras and computer vision are used to\nidentify objects and scenes. Researchers then use that data to make models\nthat can be used to predict with extreme precision what will happen if a robot\nmoves a certain way. Using these models, roboticists plan the motions of their\nmachines by writing a very specific list of actions for them to take. The\nengineers then test these motions in the laboratory many times and tweak them\nto perfection.\n\nThis approach has its limits. Robots trained like this are strictly\nchoreographed to work in one specific setting. Take them out of the laboratory\nand into an unfamiliar location, and they are likely to topple over.\n\nCompared with other fields, such as computer vision, robotics has been in the\ndark ages, Pathak says. But that might not be the case for much longer,\nbecause the field is seeing a big shake-up. Thanks to the AI boom, he says,\nthe focus is now shifting from feats of physical dexterity to building\n\u201cgeneral-purpose robot brains\u201d in the form of neural networks. Much as the\nhuman brain is adaptable and can control different aspects of the human body,\nthese networks can be adapted to work in different robots and different\nscenarios. Early signs of this work show promising results.\n\n### Robots, meet AI\n\nFor a long time, robotics research was an unforgiving field, plagued by slow\nprogress. At the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon, where Pathak works, he\nsays, \u201cthere used to be a saying that if you touch a robot, you add one year\nto your PhD.\u201d Now, he says, students get exposure to many robots and see\nresults in a matter of weeks.\n\nWhat separates this new crop of robots is their software. Instead of the\ntraditional painstaking planning and training, roboticists have started using\ndeep learning and neural networks to create systems that learn from their\nenvironment on the go and adjust their behavior accordingly. At the same time,\nnew, cheaper hardware, such as off-the-shelf components and robots like\nStretch, is making this sort of experimentation more accessible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two popular ways researchers are using AI to train\nrobots. Pathak has been using reinforcement learning, an AI technique that\nallows systems to improve through trial and error, to get robots to adapt\ntheir movements in new environments. This is a technique that Boston Dynamics\nhas also started using in its robot \u201cdogs\u201d called Spot.\n\n\u201cEXTREME PARKOUR WITH LEGGED ROBOTS,\u201d XUXIN CHENG, ET AL.\n\n\u201cEXTREME PARKOUR WITH LEGGED ROBOTS,\u201d XUXIN CHENG, ET AL.\n\n\u201cEXTREME PARKOUR WITH LEGGED ROBOTS,\u201d XUXIN CHENG, ET AL.\n\n\u201cEXTREME PARKOUR WITH LEGGED ROBOTS,\u201d XUXIN CHENG, ET AL.\n\nDeepak Pathak\u2019s team at Carnegie Mellon has used an AI technique called\nreinforcement learning to create a robotic dog that can do extreme parkour\nwith minimal pre-programming.\n\nIn 2022, Pathak\u2019s team used this method to create four-legged robot \u201cdogs\u201d\ncapable of scrambling up steps and navigating tricky terrain. The robots were\nfirst trained to move around in a general way in a simulator. Then they were\nset loose in the real world, with a single built-in camera and computer vision\nsoftware to guide them. Other similar robots rely on tightly prescribed\ninternal maps of the world and cannot navigate beyond them.\n\nPathak says the team\u2019s approach was inspired by human navigation. Humans\nreceive information about the surrounding world from their eyes, and this\nhelps them instinctively place one foot in front of the other to get around in\nan appropriate way. Humans don\u2019t typically look down at the ground under their\nfeet when they walk, but a few steps ahead, at a spot where they want to go.\nPathak\u2019s team trained its robots to take a similar approach to walking: each\none used the camera to look ahead. The robot was then able to memorize what\nwas in front of it for long enough to guide its leg placement. The robots\nlearned about the world in real time, without internal maps, and adjusted\ntheir behavior accordingly. At the time, experts told MIT Technology Review\nthe technique was a \u201cbreakthrough in robot learning and autonomy\u201d and could\nallow researchers to build legged robots capable of being deployed in the\nwild.\n\nPathak\u2019s robot dogs have since leveled up. The team\u2019s latest algorithm allows\na quadruped robot to do extreme parkour. The robot was again trained to move\naround in a general way in a simulation. But using reinforcement learning, it\nwas then able to teach itself new skills on the go, such as how to jump long\ndistances, walk on its front legs, and clamber up tall boxes twice its height.\nThese behaviors were not something the researchers programmed. Instead, the\nrobot learned through trial and error and visual input from its front camera.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it was possible three years ago,\u201d Pathak says.\n\n## Related Story\n\nThese robots know when to ask for help\n\nLarge language models combined with confidence scores help them recognize\nuncertainty. That could be key to making robots safe and trustworthy.\n\nIn the other popular technique, called imitation learning, models learn to\nperform tasks by, for example, imitating the actions of a human teleoperating\na robot or using a VR headset to collect data on a robot. It\u2019s a technique\nthat has gone in and out of fashion over decades but has recently become more\npopular with robots that do manipulation tasks, says Russ Tedrake, vice\npresident of robotics research at the Toyota Research Institute and an MIT\nprofessor.\n\nBy pairing this technique with generative AI, researchers at the Toyota\nResearch Institute, Columbia University, and MIT have been able to quickly\nteach robots to do many new tasks. They believe they have found a way to\nextend the technology propelling generative AI from the realm of text, images,\nand videos into the domain of robot movements.\n\nThe idea is to start with a human, who manually controls the robot to\ndemonstrate behaviors such as whisking eggs or picking up plates. Using a\ntechnique called diffusion policy, the robot is then able to use the data fed\ninto it to learn skills. The researchers have taught robots more than 200\nskills, such as peeling vegetables and pouring liquids, and say they are\nworking toward teaching 1,000 skills by the end of the year.\n\nMany others have taken advantage of generative AI as well. Covariant, a\nrobotics startup that spun off from OpenAI\u2019s now-shuttered robotics research\nunit, has built a multimodal model called RFM-1. It can accept prompts in the\nform of text, image, video, robot instructions, or measurements. Generative AI\nallows the robot to both understand instructions and generate images or videos\nrelating to those tasks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Toyota Research Institute team hopes this will one day lead to \u201clarge\nbehavior models,\u201d which are analogous to large language models, says Tedrake.\n\u201cA lot of people think behavior cloning is going to get us to a ChatGPT moment\nfor robotics,\u201d he says.\n\nIn a similar demonstration, earlier this year a team at Stanford managed to\nuse a relatively cheap off-the-shelf robot costing $32,000 to do complex\nmanipulation tasks such as cooking shrimp and cleaning stains. It learned\nthose new skills quickly with AI.\n\nCalled Mobile ALOHA (a loose acronym for \u201ca low-cost open-source hardware\nteleoperation system\u201d), the robot learned to cook shrimp with the help of just\n20 human demonstrations and data from other tasks, such as tearing off a paper\ntowel or piece of tape. The Stanford researchers found that AI can help robots\nacquire transferable skills: training on one task can improve its performance\nfor others.\n\nTOYOTA RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nTOYOTA RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nTOYOTA RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nTOYOTA RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nWhile the current generation of generative AI works with images and language,\nresearchers at the Toyota Research Institute, Columbia University, and MIT\nbelieve the approach can extend to the domain of robot motion.\n\nThis is all laying the groundwork for robots that can be useful in homes.\nHuman needs change over time, and teaching robots to reliably do a wide range\nof tasks is important, as it will help them adapt to us. That is also crucial\nto commercialization\u2014first-generation home robots will come with a hefty price\ntag, and the robots need to have enough useful skills for regular consumers to\nwant to invest in them.\n\nFor a long time, a lot of the robotics community was very skeptical of these\nkinds of approaches, says Chelsea Finn, an assistant professor of computer\nscience and electrical engineering at Stanford University and an advisor for\nthe Mobile ALOHA project. Finn says that nearly a decade ago, learning-based\napproaches were rare at robotics conferences and disparaged in the robotics\ncommunity. \u201cThe [natural-language-processing] boom has been convincing more of\nthe community that this approach is really, really powerful,\u201d she says.\n\nThere is one catch, however. In order to imitate new behaviors, the AI models\nneed plenty of data.\n\n### More is more\n\nUnlike chatbots, which can be trained by using billions of data points\nhoovered from the internet, robots need data specifically created for robots.\nThey need physical demonstrations of how washing machines and fridges are\nopened, dishes picked up, or laundry folded, says Lerrel Pinto, an assistant\nprofessor of computer science at New York University. Right now that data is\nvery scarce, and it takes a long time for humans to collect.\n\n\u201cON BRINGING ROBOTS HOME,\u201d NUR MUHAMMAD (MAHI) SHAFIULLAH, ET AL.\n\nSome researchers are trying to use existing videos of humans doing things to\ntrain robots, hoping the machines will be able to copy the actions without the\nneed for physical demonstrations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPinto\u2019s lab has also developed a neat, cheap data collection approach that\nconnects robotic movements to desired actions. Researchers took a reacher-\ngrabber stick, similar to ones used to pick up trash, and attached an iPhone\nto it. Human volunteers can use this system to film themselves doing household\nchores, mimicking the robot\u2019s view of the end of its robotic arm. Using this\nstand-in for Stretch\u2019s robotic arm and an open-source system called DOBB-E,\nPinto\u2019s team was able to get a Stretch robot to learn tasks such as pouring\nfrom a cup and opening shower curtains with just 20 minutes of iPhone data.\n\nBut for more complex tasks, robots would need even more data and more\ndemonstrations.\n\nThe requisite scale would be hard to reach with DOBB-E, says Pinto, because\nyou\u2019d basically need to persuade every human on Earth to buy the reacher-\ngrabber system, collect data, and upload it to the internet.\n\n## Related Story\n\nChatGPT is going to change education, not destroy it\n\nThe narrative around cheating students doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Meet the\nteachers who think generative AI could actually make learning better.\n\nA new initiative kick-started by Google DeepMind, called the Open X-Embodiment\nCollaboration, aims to change that. Last year, the company partnered with 34\nresearch labs and about 150 researchers to collect data from 22 different\nrobots, including Hello Robot\u2019s Stretch. The resulting data set, which was\npublished in October 2023, consists of robots demonstrating 527 skills, such\nas picking, pushing, and moving.\n\nSergey Levine, a computer scientist at UC Berkeley who participated in the\nproject, says the goal was to create a \u201crobot internet\u201d by collecting data\nfrom labs around the world. This would give researchers access to bigger, more\nscalable, and more diverse data sets. The deep-learning revolution that led to\nthe generative AI of today started in 2012 with the rise of ImageNet, a vast\nonline data set of images. The Open X-Embodiment Collaboration is an attempt\nby the robotics community to do something similar for robot data.\n\nEarly signs show that more data is leading to smarter robots. The researchers\nbuilt two versions of a model for robots, called RT-X, that could be either\nrun locally on individual labs\u2019 computers or accessed via the web. The larger,\nweb-accessible model was pretrained with internet data to develop a \u201cvisual\ncommon sense,\u201d or a baseline understanding of the world, from the large\nlanguage and image models.\n\nWhen the researchers ran the RT-X model on many different robots, they\ndiscovered that the robots were able to learn skills 50% more successfully\nthan in the systems each individual lab was developing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody saw that coming,\u201d says Vincent Vanhoucke, Google\nDeepMind\u2019s head of robotics. \u201cSuddenly there is a path to basically leveraging\nall these other sources of data to bring about very intelligent behaviors in\nrobotics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany roboticists think that large vision-language models, which are able to\nanalyze image and language data, might offer robots important hints as to how\nthe surrounding world works, Vanhoucke says. They offer semantic clues about\nthe world and could help robots with reasoning, deducing things, and learning\nby interpreting images. To test this, researchers took a robot that had been\ntrained on the larger model and asked it to point to a picture of Taylor\nSwift. The researchers had not shown the robot pictures of Swift, but it was\nstill able to identify the pop star because it had a web-scale understanding\nof who she was even without photos of her in its data set, says Vanhoucke.\n\nRT-2, a recent model for robotic control, was trained on online text and\nimages as well as interactions with the real world.\n\nKELSEY MCCLELLAN\n\nVanhoucke says Google DeepMind is increasingly using techniques similar to\nthose it would use for machine translation to translate from English to\nrobotics. Last summer, Google introduced a vision-language-action model called\nRT-2. This model gets its general understanding of the world from online text\nand images it has been trained on, as well as its own interactions in the real\nworld. It translates that data into robotic actions. Each robot has a slightly\ndifferent way of translating English into action, he adds.\n\n\u201cWe increasingly feel like a robot is essentially a chatbot that speaks\nrobotese,\u201d Vanhoucke says.\n\n### Baby steps\n\nDespite the fast pace of development, robots still face many challenges before\nthey can be released into the real world. They are still way too clumsy for\nregular consumers to justify spending tens of thousands of dollars on them.\nRobots also still lack the sort of common sense that would allow them to\nmultitask. And they need to move from just picking things up and placing them\nsomewhere to putting things together, says Goldberg\u2014for example, putting a\ndeck of cards or a board game back in its box and then into the games\ncupboard.\n\nBut to judge from the early results of integrating AI into robots, roboticists\nare not wasting their time, says Pinto.\n\n\u201cI feel fairly confident that we will see some semblance of a general-purpose\nhome robot. Now, will it be accessible to the general public? I don\u2019t think\nso,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in terms of raw intelligence, we are already seeing signs\nright now.\u201d\n\nBuilding the next generation of robots might not just assist humans in their\neveryday chores or help people like Henry Evans live a more independent life.\nFor researchers like Pinto, there is an even bigger goal in sight.\n\nHome robotics offers one of the best benchmarks for human-level machine\nintelligence, he says. The fact that a human can operate intelligently in the\nhome environment, he adds, means we know this is a level of intelligence that\ncan be reached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something which we can potentially solve. We just don\u2019t know how to\nsolve it,\u201d he says.\n\nThanks to Stretch, Henry Evans was able to hold his own playing cards for the\nfirst time in two decades.\n\nVY NGUYEN\n\nFor Henry and Jane Evans, a big win would be to get a robot that simply works\nreliably. The Stretch robot that the Evanses experimented with is still too\nbuggy to use without researchers present to troubleshoot, and their home\ndoesn\u2019t always have the dependable Wi-Fi connectivity Henry needs in order to\ncommunicate with Stretch using a laptop.\n\nEven so, Henry says, one of the greatest benefits of his experiment with\nrobots has been independence: \u201cAll I do is lay in bed, and now I can do things\nfor myself that involve manipulating my physical environment.\u201d\n\nThanks to Stretch, for the first time in two decades, Henry was able to hold\nhis own playing cards during a match.\n\n\u201cI kicked everyone\u2019s butt several times,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s not talk too big here,\u201d Jane says, and laughs.\n\n### by Melissa Heikkil\u00e4\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\nMagazine\n\nThe Build issue\n\nThis story was part of our May/June 2024 issue.\n\nExplore the issue\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
