The primary contribution\nis the introduction of 26 guiding principles aimed at optimizing interactions\nwith LLMs of various scales, such as LLaMA-1/2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.\n\n## Overview\n\nOur work aims to simplify the underlying concepts of formulating questions for\ndifferent scales of large language models. By examining their abilities and\nenhancing user comprehension, we focus on optimizing the design of\ninstructions and prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on models like\nLLaMA-1/2 and GPT-3.5/4 have verified the effectiveness of the proposed\nprinciples.\n\n## Data Release\n\nOur dataset, comprising 13k data points, supports the study of LLM prompting\nprinciples. The data is curated to facilitate understanding and application of\nthe 26 principles. Our project includes two types of datasets, catering to\ndifferent needs and research focuses:\n\n  1. General Dataset (general_dataset.json): This comprehensive dataset combines all the examples from each of the 26 principles into a single file, offering a holistic view of our research and its diverse applications.\n\n     * File: general_dataset.json\n     * Structure:\n\n       * Each entry contains an Instruction field describing the task.\n       * The {model_name}_conversations field provides the model-generated response to the instruction.\n\nExample:\n\n    \n        { \"id\": \"identity_0\", \"model\": \"gpt4\", \"conversations\": [ { \"from\": \"human\", \"value\": \"Explain the process of photosynthesis.\" }, { \"from\": \"gpt\", \"value\": \"Photosynthesis is a biochemical process...\" } ] },\n\n  2. Individual Principle Datasets: We offer separate datasets for boosting and correctness for each of the 26 principles for a more focused study. These files allow researchers to explore and analyze data of specific principles in isolation.\n\n## Principled Instruction Finetuning\n\nOur benchmark is compatible with Stanford Alpaca or FastChat. We will further\nprovide the finetuned models.\n\n## Third-party Apps\n\n  1. Prompt Enhancer and its GitHub is a web service and tool designed to enable users to select specific principles to enhance the prompts. Special thanks to Lim Hyo Jeong for the excellent contribution!\n\n  2. Magic Prompts is an easy tool to generate high-quality prompts. Special thanks to Lyzr for the excellent contribution!\n\n  3. Prompt-builder and its GitHub is a small Python tool and application that allows users to generate natural language prompts adhering to specific rules and guidelines defined in our paper. Special thanks to lypsoty112 for the excellent contribution!\n\n## Citation\n\n    \n    \n    @article{bsharat2023principled, title={Principled Instructions Are All You Need for Questioning LLaMA-1/2, GPT-3.5/4}, author={Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat, Aidar Myrzakhan, Zhiqiang Shen}, journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.16171}, year={2023}, }\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions and suggestions to improve our principles and expand\nthe dataset.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nStanford Alpaca\n\n## About\n\nA principled instruction benchmark on formulating effective queries and\nprompts for large language models (LLMs).
