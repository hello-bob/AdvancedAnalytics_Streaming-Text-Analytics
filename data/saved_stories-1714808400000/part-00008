But this is under growing threat.\n\nIn recent years, China has used a variety of \u201cgrey zone\u201d tactics to pressure\nTaiwan to accept the Communist Party\u2019s attempts at unification. This has\nincluded an onslaught of cyberattacks, which not only pose a significant\nthreat to Taiwan\u2019s national security but also seek to undermine its democratic\nprocesses.\n\nThese attacks range from phishing attempts to sophisticated malware\nintrusions. Website defacement attacks and Distributed Denial of Service\n(DDoS) attacks are often seen during significant events, such as the August\n2022 visit of Nancy Pelosi, then-speaker of the US House of Representatives.\nGovernment agencies, educational institutions, convenience stores and train\nstations are among the targets.\n\nSo, how is Taiwan defending itself from these attacks? And can it continue to\ndo so as China\u2019s tactics become more sophisticated?\n\n## Millions of cyberattacks a day\n\nDespite Taiwan\u2019s technological prowess and robust cybersecurity measures, it\ncontinues to be a major target for malicious actors seeking to sow chaos in\nthe country.\n\nAccording to senior government officials, Taiwan receives some five million\ncyberattacks a day. And Frontinet, a US-based cybersecurity firm, has found\nTaiwan experienced just over half of the billions of malware attacks detected\nin the Asia-Pacific region in the first half of 2023.\n\nThe intensity of cyberattacks reached new heights during Taiwan\u2019s January 2024\nelections \u2013 a critical juncture in its democratic journey. The Ministry of\nDigital Affairs reported on the widespread use of social engineering tactics\nto compel people to click on links or download files, which then allowed\nperpetrators to steal sensitive information.\n\nOne particularly alarming incident involved a \u201cthreat actor\u201d named Earth\nLusca, which targets organisations of interest to the Chinese government.\n\nFrom December to January, this actor emailed a malicious zip file entitled\n\u201cChina\u2019s grey-zone warfare against Taiwan\u201d to selected targets, including\ngovernment and educational institutions and news media in Taiwan. The file was\ndesigned to install malicious software to infiltrate computer systems. It also\nincluded documents written by experts in Taiwan\u2013China relations, believed to\nhave been stolen from the authors or agencies that own them.\n\nThe timing of these attacks, peaking just 24 hours before the elections,\nunderscored their strategic intent to undermine Taiwan\u2019s electoral integrity.\n\n## Disinformation and deepfakes\n\nThese efforts to destabilise Taiwan are not confined to conventional hacking\ntechniques. Disinformation campaigns are also causing political, economic and\nsocial harm to the country.\n\nIn the lead-up to the elections, for instance, a deluge of false narratives\nand fabricated content circulated on social media. These targeted the ruling\nDemocratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates for Taiwanese sovereignty.\n\nAmong the most egregious examples was the dissemination of a 300-page e-book\nentitled \u201cThe Secret History of Tsai Ing-wen\u201d (\u8521\u82f1\u6587\u79d8\u53f2), laden with baseless\nallegations about the Taiwanese president aimed at eroding the public\u2019s trust\nin her and her party. It claimed, for example, that Tsai\u2019s mother was a\nprostitute. It also portrayed Tsai as a vile, morally corrupt dictator who is\nsexually promiscuous and hungry for power. Taiwanese security officials said\nthe book bore the hallmark of the Chinese Ministry of State Security.\n\nUsing AI tools such as Capcut, developed by the Chinese technology giant\nByteDance, the book\u2019s developers also produced and disseminated fake news\nvideos for social media. Featuring AI-generated voices and fake news anchors,\nthese videos were produced with alarming efficiency and promptly replaced if\nthey were taken down by platforms.\n\nFurthermore, rumours circulated on social media about DPP presidential\ncandidate Lai Ching-te having illegitimate sons, and other candidates having\nextramarital affairs. The videos used deepfake technologies to make the claims\nappear more real to deceive the public.\n\nAlthough these campaigns were not entirely successful \u2013 Lai won the presidency\n\u2013 they are still a cause for concern.\n\nOrchestrated disinformation campaigns are becoming more sophisticated and\nwidespread, especially with the support of generative AI and deepfake\nsoftware. And their potential to influence public opinion or fuel political\npolarisation could gradually weaken Taiwan\u2019s democracy and create instability.\n\nAnd these tactics can also be replicated elsewhere. Other countries worried\nabout the impact of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns on their\nelections and democratic institutions should be paying attention.\n\n## How Taiwan is responding\n\nIn response to these multifaceted threats, Tsai, the outgoing president, has\nstressed that cybersecurity is synonymous with national security.\n\nHowever, the country\u2019s existing cybersecurity regulations primarily target\ncybercrime. Because of the blurry line between cybercrime and cyber warfare,\nTaiwan needs to adopt a more holistic approach. This should encompass\npreventive measures, rapid response strategies and enhanced public-private and\ninternational collaborations.\n\nFor example, Taiwan is now developing its own satellite internet service \u2013 an\nalternative to Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink \u2013 to reduce the potential harm from\nsevered underwater internet cables.\n\nWorking with the American Institute In Taiwan, the government is also\npromoting a US Department of Defence cybersecurity framework for local\nbusinesses to make them more resilient to attacks. And in January, Taiwan\u2019s\nMinistry of Justice Investigation Bureau established a new research centre\naimed at combating the threat of online disinformation.\n\nNon-governmental organisations such as the Doublethink Lab, Cofacts and the\nTaiwan Factcheck Centre are also playing a significant role through real-time\nmonitoring of foreign influence and disinformation campaigns and fact-checking\nservices.\n\nHowever, with advances in technology, cyberattacks and disinformation will\nevolve. This is why other components are essential to build a comprehensive\ncyberdefence strategy. This includes increased investment in cybersecurity\ninfrastructure, fostering digital literacy and promoting responsible online\nbehaviour.\n\nOnly through collective vigilance and concerted efforts can Taiwan safeguard\nits democratic values in the face of relentless cyber threats.\n\n  * China\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Taiwan\n  * Cyberattacks\n  * World news\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Assistant Editor - 1 year cadetship\n\n  * ##### Program Development Officer - Business Processes\n\n  * ##### Executive Dean, Faculty of Health\n\n  * ##### Lecturer/Senior Lecturer, Earth System Science (School of Science)\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": true}
