A\ndevelopment like the demise of serfdom in late 14th and early 15th century\nEngland did not hinge on the actions or ideas of a single peasant or lord. The\nIndustrial Revolution would have taken place even if we removed a James Watt\nor Richard Arkwright from history. The underlying premise of institutional\nanalysis is that there are deeper, structural factors that tend to matter more\nthan any one individual.\n\nThanks for reading How the World Became Rich!

Among\nacademics, the Great Man Theory of History died a long time ago. Even invoking\nit risks cliche.\n\nBut there do seem to be individuals who have a huge impact on history.\nAlexander the Great is an obvious example. Had his father Philip lived, he\nwould have invaded the Persian Empire. But all the evidence suggests, that he\nwould have been satisfied with \u201cliberating\u201d the Greek cities of Anatolia.\nAfter several battlefield successes, he would likely have accepted a large\npayment from the Persian emperor to withdraw and enjoy his hegemony over the\nGreek states. Alexander\u2019s unique personality traits do seem responsible for\nthe extension of a Hellenistic empire all of the way to India.\n\n###\n\nMartin Luther: A Man Who Changed History\n\nAnother individual who had a similarly decisive impact was Martin Luther. I\nrecently enjoyed listening to The Rest is History\u2019s series of podcasts on\nLuther. Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook are in little doubt that Luther\u2019s\nimpact was decisive and that Luther was among the most important individuals\nin history. Episode 1 is subtitled: \u201cThe man who changed history\u201c. Top 5 is\ntheir assessment: \u201cBigger than Marx\u201d.\n\nMartin Luther. Quintessential great man of history?\n\nLuther scholars tend to be more cautious. They refrain from strong\ncounterfactual claims (such as \u201cno Luther, no Reformation\u201d). And, of course,\nthe question of whether any individual is truly decisive in that sense is\nprobably impossible to answer. But we do have the tools and evidence to\nevaluate the evidence for Luther\u2019s impact in more detail.\n\nWe argue in our chapter that individuals can have a role in institutional\nanalysis.1 Or at least, we propose one way of thinking about their influence\nanalytically. We propose that individuals influence institutional change in\ntwo distinct ways: (1) by exogenously shifting some parameters in society i.e.\ntechnology or preferences; (2) by solving coordination problems. Luther is\nnotable because he clearly did both things.\n\nLet\u2019s briefly talk about (1), though the majority of this post will be\noccupied with (2). Luther was professor of theology at the University of\nWittenberg. As historians like Peter Marshall emphasize, this was not a\nprestigious university; nor was Luther prior to 1517 a famous or well-\npublished theologian. But Luther was in a sense the \u201cright man\u201d at the right\ntime (or perhaps wrong man, at the wrong time depending on your theological\npoint of view). He entered the intellectual fray at the same time as a\ntremendous controversy about the sale of indulgences was breaking out. And his\nwritings certainly caused people to reevaluate their religious beliefs.\n\nJohan Tetzel had been commissioned to sell indulgences by Albrecht, Archbishop\nof Maniz and Magdeburg. As Marshall describes it:\n\n> \u201cAlbrecht\u2019s court theologians drew up an Instructio Summaria (Summary\n> Instruction) with guidelines to preachers on how to present it most\n> effectively. This confirmed that the new issue superseded and invalidated\n> all previous grants of indulgence for the next eight years\u2014a source of\n> understandable annoyance to people who had bought earlier ones in literal\n> good faith. Generally, the Instructio took a maximalist line on the\n> indulgence\u2019s power and efficacy. Most notoriously, it suggested that people\n> buying the indulgence on behalf of the dead had no need to make confession\n> or exhibit contrition, as its effectiveness depended on \u2018the love in which\n> the deceased died, and the contributions of the living\u2019.\u201d (Marshall, 2017, p\n> 29)\n\nThis according to Marshall was at the very least questionable, and Tetzel may\nhave gone further using the slogan: \u2018as soon as the coin in the coffer rings,\nat once the soul to heaven springs.\u2019\n\nIt was in this perhaps only in this already charged and febrile atmosphere\nthat Luther\u2019s writings could have had the impact that they did. Historians\nemphasize that in 1517 Luther\u2019s positions were mostly orthodox. He wished to\nlimit not abolish indulgences and accepted the concept of purgatory. But his\nopposition to the practices of indulgence and the printing of his 95-theses\nmade him a celebrity.\n\nLuther\u2019s writings then can modeled as shifting preferences. But in my view is\nthis doesn\u2019t fully capture the role of an individual like Martin Luther in the\nseismic series of events we call the Reformation.\n\nTo understand the impact of Luther we also have to think about his role in\ncoordinating opposition to the religious establishment. Luther was an\nimportant theologian, but he wasn\u2019t just a theologian. He was an intellectual\nentrepreneur and a politically savvy operator.\n\n###\n\nLuther\u2019s Network and its Role in Coordinating the Reformation\n\nFortunately to understand (2), we can rely on published research by Sascha\nBecker, Yuan Hsiao, Steven Pfaff, and Jared Rubin (co-author of How the World\nBecame Rich). In a paper published in the American Sociological Review in\n2020, Becker, Hsiao, Pfaff and Rubin (BHPR) studied the role Luther played in\ndiffusing his ideas through his personal network.\n\nWhile the role of printing in spreading the Reformation is well known, BHPR\nargue that Luther\u2019s personal network, specifically his letters and personal\nvisits also played a critical role. They describe him as a \u201cspecial kind of\nopinion leader, a \u201chyper-influential\u201d person who could sway many people\nthrough persuasion and example\u201d (Becker et al. 2020, p. 860). They formulate\nthis hypothesis in Figure 1 below.\n\nThe authors find that cities Luther had personally influenced between\n1517-1522 in the form of letters, visits or students were more likely to\nbecome Protestant by 1530. Similarly, the more personal influence Luther had\non a city between 1517-1522, the more likely that it adopted Protestantism.\nThis is clear simply looking at the bivariate relationships below.\n\nOf course, in the paper the authors verify that this pattern holds up when\nusing regression analysis and controlling for a host of other factors that\nalso influenced adoption of the Reformation. If you don\u2019t know the paper, I\nsuggest checking it out.\n\nBack to the role of individuals in economic history. The above analysis offers\na way to think about decisive individuals in history.\n\nWas Churchill decisive in 1940? Many historians say, yes. Was Luther decisive\nin 1517-1522? Also yes, in the following sense. While the dry tinder was\nalready there and while there were many radicals dissatisfied with aspects of\nthe medieval Church, it is hard to envision any of them lighting the\nconflagration that Luther did.\n\nOther radical theologians might have gained either a scholarly audience or a\npopular one. Part of Luther\u2019s distinctive contribution was his ability to\ninfluence both elites and the broader, literate, public across Germany-\nspeaking Europe.2\n\n###\n\nCoordination Games versus Prisoner\u2019s Dilemmas\n\nWhat this analysis suggests is that individuals can be decisive for\nunderstanding institutional change if they coordinate other individuals.\n\nIn cases where there is only one possible long-run equilibrium, this role is\nirrelevant. For example, let us grant that serfdom was in terminal decline in\nEngland by around 1400. The increased value of labor meant that ending serfdom\nwas the only feasible equilibria. In this case, the role of any one individual\nwould be limited: serfdom would end either way.\n\nBut if there are multiple feasible equilibria, certain individuals can have an\noutsized impact. They can enable societies to coordinate on specific\noutcomes/institutional arrangements.\n\nAnother way of saying this, is that if the situation a society faces resembles\na Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, then the role of any one individual is limited. But if\nthe situation is, instead, a coordination game (like Battle of the Sexes),\nthen certain individuals can really matter.\n\n1\n\nAnd thanks to the anonymous referee who pushed us on this point!)\n\n2\n\nCritical to Luther\u2019s success was his impact on Frederick the Wise, Elector of\nSaxony. Frederick was Pope Leo X\u2019s proposed \"anti-Habsburg\u201d candidate for Holy\nRoman Emperor. And he was famous as a collector of relics. But when Luther was\ncharged with heresy, Frederick protected him. Perhaps he was the decisive\nindividual?\n\n### Subscribe to How the World Became Rich\n\nBy Mark Koyama \u00b7 Launched 2 months ago\n\nEconomic History\n\n20 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n7 Restacks\n\n20\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Do Individuals Matter in Institutional Economic History?\n\nwww.markkoyama.com\n\n3\n\nShare\n\n3 Comments\n\nAdam GurriThe End of SafetyApr 30Liked by Mark KoyamaExcellent stuff Mark.\nI\u2019ve written about this myself\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2265111Expand full\ncommentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies by Mark Koyama and others\n\n2 more comments...\n\nThe Political Economy of Dune\n\nMy most downloaded academic paper on SSRN is a yet to be published book\nchapter on the political economy of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune.
