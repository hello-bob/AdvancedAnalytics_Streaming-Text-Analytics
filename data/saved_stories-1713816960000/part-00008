Gertsman\u2019s remarkable wildlife\nphoto, The Frigatebird and the Diamond Ring, was years in the making and the\nculmination of research, hard work, practice, scouting, and a pinch of luck.\nAfter all, while you can control a lot, you can\u2019t control the weather.\n\nGertsman captured his photo on April 8th, when the great total solar eclipse\ncarved a path across North America, northeast from Mexico to Maine and the\nCanadian Maritime provinces. From a hired boat off the coast of Sinaloa,\nMexico, Gertsman enjoyed four and a half minutes of totality in nearly ideal\nconditions and returned home to British Columbia, Canada, later that week with\nhis dream photo.\n\n\u2018The Frigatebird and the Diamond Ring\u2019 by Liron Gertsman\n\n## An Eclipse Photo Years in the Making\n\n\u201cThis is an image I\u2019ve wanted to get for a long, long time,\u201d Gertsman tells\nPetaPixel over the phone the day after he got back home. \u201c[A bird in flight in\nfront of the eclipse] has been a dream shot in my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it came time to pull it off, I was looking at the upcoming solar\neclipse. Obviously, it has to be a total solar eclipse rather than a partial\nor annular eclipse. The Moon needs to be completely covering the Sun,\u201d\nGertsman explains.\n\n\u201cSo that narrows it down, because there are only total solar eclipses every\none to three years or so. And then it turned out that next one was coming up\nin April 2024.\u201d\n\nPicking the April 8th, 2024, eclipse from the list, Gertsman identified some\nparticularly appealing characteristics.\n\nPiedras Blancas off the coast of Sinaloa, Mexico. Gertsman captured this shot\nduring one of his scouting trips a few days before the total solar eclipse.\n\n\u201cI was looking for places that have historically good weather,\u201d the\nphotographer says. \u201cThis is also where my background as a biologist and bird\nenthusiast comes into play, because I spend a lot of time learning about and\nobserving birds. I know that coastal regions tend to have higher chances to\nencountering things like bird flocks, often lots of seabirds gathering at\nnesting locations or roosting on an island.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt became clear to me that coastal Mexico would be the best place to try to\npull this off. And then I narrowed it down using internet resources, citizen\nscience databases, things like eBird, Google Earth, Google Street View, blog\nposts, travel websites, etc.\u201d\n\nGertsman found his ideal location and began booking travel and lodging about a\nyear in advance. \u201cFor the eclipse, it was very busy in town, which was\namazing. It was a great atmosphere.\u201d\n\n## Scouting, Practice, and Preparation Were Essential for Success\n\nWhile the area Gertsman selected worked out, he did his due diligence. He\nscouted additional locations within a few hours in any direction, ensuring\nthat if the weather at his first-choice location turned sour, there would be a\nchance to get a shot elsewhere.\n\nAlthough Gertsman could scout locations, check his angles, and dial in camera\nsettings ahead of time, there was one thing he couldn\u2019t plan for, at least not\nwith certainty. What would the birds do during the eclipse?\n\nPiedras Blancas during a practice run\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating area of research that not a lot is known about,\u201d the\nphotographer explains. \u201cBut I figured if we had a place where there were birds\nboth in the day and during the nighttime, the odds would increase a lot\nbecause chances are the birds might act like it\u2019s nighttime during the\neclipse. You need a spot that doesn\u2019t only occur in a day but also at night.\u201d\n\nThe Mazatl\u00e1n Islands off the coast of Sinaloa, an ecological preserve, is a\nhot spot for birds. Gertsman had scouted a few close-knit islands, his plan A.\n\n\u201cThey were such a prime choice because we had been observing it in the evening\nas it was getting dark, and so many birds would be flying into roost on them\nat night.\u201d\n\nSome seabirds flying in the sky at one of Gertsman\u2019s backup locations.\n\n### The Perfect Bird\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just any bird that Gertsman wanted for his silhouette eclipse bird\nin flight photo. His dream shot was of a frigatebird, a large seabird with a\nremarkable forked tail.\n\n\u201cSuper long wings and a fork tail,\u201d Gertsman says of the frigatebird. \u201cWe knew\nthey roosted on the specific island.\u201d\n\nDespite the scouting and planning, just minutes before totality, there weren\u2019t\nmany birds, maybe 40 or 50. It could have been enough, but it would require\nmore luck in terms of bird positioning than Gertsman had hoped for.\n\n\u201cThen all of a sudden, there were like 250 birds in the air. In a matter of\nminutes. I don\u2019t even know where they came from,\u201d Gertsman recalls. \u201cWhat\u2019s\ninteresting is that earlier in the week, when scouting at sunset, the birds\nwould circle a bit and then come to land on the island. However, during\ntotality, they didn\u2019t land on the island. They just stayed circling in the\nair, which was actually perfect because that was the shot I wanted \u2014 them\ncircling in the air.\u201d\n\n## Shooting From a Boat Enabled More Possibilities but Comes With Challenges\n\nBy the way, a wrinkle in this is that Gertsman was photographing from a\nchartered boat.\n\n\u201cThe thing I love about a boat is that it\u2019s a real non-traditional way to\nshoot an eclipse,\u201d Gertsman says. \u201cBut the reason it\u2019s perfect for this sort\nof thing is because it\u2019s a lot easier to move into the right position quickly.\nIf the birds are somewhere else, you can just drive over there in a moment.\nBut we ended up getting into the perfect position a few minutes before\ntotality.\u201d\n\nThe boat was captained by Arturo and Tony from Aqua Sports Marina Mazatl\u00e1n,\nand Gertsman can\u2019t say enough good things about them. \u201cThey were absolutely\nfantastic. They were as important of a puzzle piece to putting this all\ntogether as anything else, and they were phenomenal.\u201d\n\nHe also adds that he had the crew remove the tent, usually over the boat\u2019s\nhelm, so that the captains and crew could enjoy the eclipse for themselves. It\nwas paramount to Gertsman that everyone who helped him get the shot could see\nthe spectacular event for themselves. The preparation and positioning were so\ngood that Gertsman said they didn\u2019t need to adjust position during totality.\n\n\u2018Seabirds and the Eclipse\u2019 by Liron Gertsman\n\nGertsman is no stranger to shooting from a boat, which helped during the\neclipse. He\u2019s used to working on a moving platform and dealing with\npositioning.\n\n\u201cStably hand holding a camera from a boat is a skill that takes time to\nlearn,\u201d Gertsman says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of practice because I\u2019ve been\nphotographing from boats from a very young age.\u201d\n\n## Gertsman\u2019s Canon EOS R5 Was Stellar\n\nAs for Gertsman\u2019s gear of choice for the eclipse, he shot with two cameras.\nOne, his personal Canon EOS R5, and the other a second rented R5 body.\nSomething Gertsman and nearly every pro agree on when it comes to equipment is\nthat you must be familiar with your gear. While Gertsman floated the idea of\nrenting something different, he decided that his best chance of success would\ncome from shooting with a camera he knew intimately.\n\nGertsman during one of the practice runs, armed with his trusty RF 100-500mm telephoto lens. | Photo by Jack Bailey\n\nHe wanted two bodies to have different lenses without changing optics during\ntotality. While four and a half minutes sounds like a lot, it isn\u2019t. It goes\nby in the blink of an eye, and you cannot afford to waste time with swapping\nlenses.\n\nAs for his lenses, Gertsman shoots almost exclusively with an RF 100-500mm\ntelephoto zoom lens, so he had that as his primary lens. The second R5 was\nequipped with the Canon RF 24-105mm f/4 standard zoom.\n\nBecause the lenses have such different focal lengths and depths of field,\nGertsman\u2019s focusing methods differed for each camera. For the wide-angle\nshooting, he decided to focus near infinity since the flying birds would be\nquite far from the camera.\n\nGertsman shooting during the eclipse | Photo by Jack Bailey\n\nFor the RF 100-500mm, he locked focus on the birds themselves for each burst.\n\n\u201cI was using servo (continuous) autofocus with animal detection on the RF\n100-500mm,\u201d Gertsman explains. \u201cI was using one-shot AF on the 24-105mm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI practiced it a lot beforehand,\u201d Gertsman says of his selections.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just practice in the days and weeks before the eclipse in Mexico; he\nalso practiced during last fall\u2019s annual eclipse.\n\nA couple of gulls during last fall\u2019s annular eclipse\n\nWhile Gertsman admits that it\u2019s not a perfect substitute for a total solar\neclipse, the annular eclipse proved helpful for getting a sense of how things\nwould go when photographing birds in flight in those conditions.\n\n## Practice Makes Perfect\n\nOf all his scouting, thinking, planning, and practicing, Gertsman says it was\nessential.\n\n\u201cNone of it would have been possible without all the preparation. I don\u2019t\nthink we were over-prepared at all. We were as prepared as we needed to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI became more confident in our chance of success after the practice run two\ndays before,\u201d Gertsman says. During the dry run, he saw birds in the perfect\nspot as the Sun began to set. \u201cOnce I saw that, I was like, \u2018If this is what\nit\u2019s like during the eclipse, we\u2019re going to get this shot.\u2019 So, I was\nreasonably confident.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the main thing that was giving me nerves were the clouds,\u201d Gertsman\nadmits. The morning of the total solar eclipse, it was looking iffy. But,\nGertsman stuck to his plan, trusted his gut, and it all worked out.\n\n\u2018Frigatebird and the Partial Eclipse\u2019 by Liron Gertsman\n\nAs he says, \u201cI always say in wildlife photography, luck is absolutely a\nfactor. But you make your own luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even remember how I was feeling,\u201d Gertsman says of totality. \u201cI think\nI was mostly just feeling excited and in awe.\u201d\n\nGertsman right after totality ended. You can see a look of relief on his face, but the photographer says he doesn\u2019t remember how he was feeling at the time. | Photo by Jack Bailey\n\nWhen photographers are as experienced as Gertsman and have put in the effort\nto be confident and prepared, you can rely on autopilot to carry you through\nthe nerves.\n\nI\u2019m glad that Gertsman was treated to the weather conditions he needed to get\nhis dream photo. He deserved it.\n\n### More From Liron Gertsman\n\nTo see more of Liron Gertsman\u2019s work, visit his website.
