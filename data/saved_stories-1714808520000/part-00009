It\u2019s\nthe first time in decades that a non-U.S. studio film has won the category.\nDespite its deep influence on the history of visual effects in cinema, this\nyear was the first time in the Godzilla franchise\u2019s seven-decade history that\nit was nominated for an Oscar.\n\n### Related Stories\n\nTV\n\n### Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jonathan Majors Appear on Ballot to Pick BET Award\nNominees (Exclusive)\n\nLifestyle\n\n### Demi Moore Set as Chopard's Godmother for Cannes\n\nGodzilla Minus One was written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, who also\nheaded up the film\u2019s VFX team, which included Kiyoko Shibuya, Masaki Takahashi\nand Tatsuji Nojima. The team is now Japan\u2019s first-ever winner of the best\nvisual effects Oscar. In another rarity, a director winning the category has\nonly occurred once before \u2014 Stanley Kubrick\u2019s win in 1969 for 2001: A Space\nOdyssey.\n\nYamazaki and his collaborators triumphed over the VFX teams from Guardians of\nthe Galaxy 3, Napoleon, Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One and The\nCreator.\n\nAccepting his Oscar, Yamazaki said he was inspired to become a filmmaker by\nthe \u201cshock\u201d of seeing Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a\nkid in Japan some 40 years ago.\n\n\u201cSo far from Hollywood, even the possibility of standing on this stage seemed\nout of reach,\u201d Yamazaki said, fighting back emotion. \u201cThe moment we were\nnominated, we felt like Rocky Balboa welcomed into the ring as equals by our\nbiggest rivals, which was already a miracle. But, here we stand!\u201d\n\nGodzilla Minus One has been a critical and commercial sensation, earning $56.4\nmillion in the U.S. and Canada to become the highest-grossing Japanese film of\nall time. Only two international live-action movies \u2014 fellow Oscar winners\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Life Is Beautiful \u2014 earned more in North\nAmerica.\n\nLater, backstage at the Oscars ceremony, Yamazaki spoke of the impact he hopes\nhis film\u2019s success will have back home in Japan.\n\n\u201cI think Godzilla has opened up so many doors for us through this project. I\ndon\u2019t know where those doors are going to lead, but I don\u2019t want to turn down\nany opportunity,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cI do believe that perhaps the\nsuccess of Godzilla Minus One will open up new opportunity for a lot of\nJapanese filmmakers. I think that\u2019s important because Japan is such a small\ncountry that we need international box office and revenue to sustain the\nindustry. This should be the start of something bigger, I hope, for the\nindustry as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe 37th film in the Godzilla franchise tells the story of Godzilla\u2019s first\nemergence in a ravaged postwar Japan. Backed by Toho studios, the film stars\nRyunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada, Munetaka Aoki, Hidetaka\nYoshioka, Sakura Ando and Kuranosuke Sasaki.\n\nThe VFX team brought some Kaiju color to the Oscars red carpet Sunday night,\nentering the theater in shoes adorned with Godzilla sculptures gripping the\nheels, and holding figurines of the iconic monster. Yamazaki and his Godzilla\nfigurine also wore matching bow ties.\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe Sign Up\n\n## More from The Hollywood Reporter\n\n  * Inside Out Film Festival\n\n### \u2018My Old Ass\u2019 to Open Toronto\u2019s Inside Out Film Festival\n\n  * Heat Vision\n\n### \u2018The Maze Runner\u2019 Reboot in the Works with \u2018Transcendence\u2019 Scribe Jack\nPaglen in Talks to Write (Exclusive)\n\n  * international\n\n### Matthias Glasner\u2019s \u2018Dying\u2019 Wins German Film Awards\n\n  * The Princess Diaries\n\n### Chris Pine Says Getting \u2018Princess Diaries 2\u2019 Role Was \u201cAbsolutely Earth-\nShattering\u201d\n\n  * The Idea of You\n\n### \u2018The Idea of You\u2019 Team on Creating a Pop Star in Nicholas Galitzine: \u201cHe\nJust Made the Songs Come Alive\u201d\n\n  * Yellowstone\n\n### Cannes Film Festival: Kevin Costner Will Guest on THR\u2019s \u2018Awards Chatter\u2019\nPodcast Live From the Palais\n\n### Shopping With THR\n\n### The 40 Best Mother\u2019s Day Gifts to Shop On Amazon\n\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston, Erin Lassner\n\n### Sofia Coppola\u2019s Lip Balm Collection With Augustinus Bader Is the Beauty\nCollab of the Moment\n\nBy Erin Lassner\n\n### Everything to Know About Robinhood\u2019s Retirement IRA\n\nBy Stephanie Tsai\n\n### Billie Eilish\u2019s Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour Kicks Off in October \u2014 Where to\nBuy Tickets Before They Sell Out\n\nBy Danielle Directo-Meston\n\n## THR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy\nPolicy.
