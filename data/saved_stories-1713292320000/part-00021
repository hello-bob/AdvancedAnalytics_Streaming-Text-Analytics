This\nrelease evolves the widely adopted OpenXR open API standard for high-\nperformance, cross-platform access to VR, AR, and mixed reality (MR) \u2014\ncollectively known as XR\u2014platforms and devices. OpenXR 1.1 consolidates widely\nused API extensions into the core specification to reduce fragmentation and\nadds new functionality to streamline the development of more powerful and\nefficient XR applications.\n\nIn particular, OpenXR 1.1 consolidates multiple vendor extensions for key\nfunctionality to reduce differences in application code across multiple\nplatforms, while still remaining flexible and extensible to foster innovation\nin a rapidly growing and evolving market. The OpenXR Working Group will focus\non managing a pipeline of extensions to develop and seek feedback on new\nfunctionality, while proactively integrating proven technology into the core\nspecification to provide developers with robust cross-platform XR\ncapabilities.\n\nToday, most major XR platforms have transitioned to using OpenXR to expose\ncurrent and future device capabilities. Vendors with conformant OpenXR\nimplementations include Acer, ByteDance, Canon, HTC, Magic Leap, Meta,\nMicrosoft, Sony, XREAL, Qualcomm, Valve, Varjo, and Collabora\u2019s Monado open\nsource runtime. OpenXR is also supported by all the major game and rendering\nengines, including Autodesk VRED, Blender, Godot, NVIDIA\u2019s Omniverse,\nStereoKit, Unreal Engine, and Unity.\n\nThe OpenXR 1.1 specification can be found on the Khronos website and on GitHub\nOpenXR Registry.\n\n## Extensions Promoted to the OpenXR 1.1 Core Specification\n\nOpenXR integrates the following functionality, previously available through\nextensions, into the core specification.\n\nLocal Floor (promoted from XR_EXT_local_floor) provides a new Reference Space\nwith a gravity-aligned world-locked origin for standing-scale content that can\nbe recentered to the current user position at the press of a button without a\ncalibration procedure. It also has an estimated floor height built-in. More\ndetails about Local Floor functionality and its value to developers are\navailable in this blog post.\n\nStereo with Foveated Rendering (promoted from XR_VARJO_quad_views) provides a\nPrimary View Configuration to realize eye-tracked foveated rendering or fixed\nfoveated rendering for XR headsets across multiple graphics rendering APIs.\nIts use is especially beneficial for efficiently rendering high-pixel-count\ndisplays, which put a heavy load on the GPU. The original vendor extension has\nbeen adopted natively in Unity, Unreal, and recently by NVIDIA Omniverse.\n\nGrip Surface (promoted from XR_EXT_palm_pose) provides a Standard Pose\nIdentifier that reliably anchors visual content relative to the user's\nphysical hand, whether the hand position is tracked directly or inferred from\na physical controller\u2019s position and orientation.\n\nXrUuid (promoted from XR_EXT_uuid) provides a Common Data Type to hold a\nUniversally Unique Identifier that follows the IETF RFC 4122.\n\nxrLocateSpaces (and its corresponding extension equivalent\nXR_KHR_locate_spaces) provides a Locating Spaces function to improve\nperformance and simplify application code by enabling an application to locate\nan array of spaces in a single function call populating an \u201carray of\nstructures\u201d (AoS), instead of being limited to locating a single space per\nfunction call.\n\n## Feature Enhancements\n\nIn addition to consolidating extensions, OpenXR 1.1 also provides developers\nwith a set of new features and clarifications, including:\n\n### Interaction Profile Improvements\n\nStreamline action system programming. Developers can now take advantage of\nthese new standards:\n\n  * Interaction Profile Paths: 13 new interaction profiles have been added to the OpenXR 1.1 core specification, most promoted from vendor extensions\n  * Standard Identifiers: includes thumb_resting_surfaces, stylus, trigger_curl, and trigger_slide\n  * Standard Component: adds proximity\n  * Output Paths: haptic_trigger and haptic_thumb\n\n### Fundamentals\n\nImprovements in OpenXR 1.1 provide developers with an extended set of\nuniversal tools for building enhanced XR experiences:\n\n  * XrDuration: Clarify behavior for a negative duration\n  * Event Polling: Clarify runtime and application behavior for polling\n  * Two-Call Idiom: Precise explanation for \u201cbuffer size\u201d\n  * New Structures: Added color without alpha channel (XrColor3f), rectangular prism (XrExtent3Df), oriented sphere (XrSpheref), oriented box (XrBoxf), and frustum (XrFrustum)\n\n### New Error Codes\n\nNew error code XR_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT PERMISSIONS and\nXR_ERROR_DEPENDENCY_NOT_ENABLED help with application debugging (see xr.xml).\n\n### Specification Refinement\n\nOpenXR 1.1 provides clearer explanations of specification intent, while\nremoving ambiguity, and strengthening the preciseness of normative language.\nAffected chapters include:\n\n  * Spaces: OpenXR 1.1 adds links to Reference Spaces to easily identify them in the text. It also strengthens normative language for both runtimes and app developers\n  * Rendering: the XR_COMPOSITION_LAYER_CORRECT_CHROMATIC_ABERRATION_BIT is deprecated since it is not used in any shipping runtimes\n  * Input: mentions of \u201cDefault Bindings\u201d are removed and timing requirements for reading input action state are clarified\n  * Appendix: Updated list of contributors\n  * Versions: A new chapter to show promoted extensions between versions\n\n\"OpenXR 1.1 marks a significant milestone in the development of this open\nstandard that has become widely adopted throughout the XR industry. OpenXR 1.0\nprovided baseline capabilities and the foundation for experimentation with new\nfunctionality through extensions. Now the Working Group is pivoting to manage\nregular core specification updates that balance the need for flexibility to\nship new functionality with consolidation of proven technology to reduce\nfragmentation and enable true cross-platform application portability. By\nsimplifying development while fostering innovation, we aim to empower\ndevelopers to concentrate on creating groundbreaking immersive, cross-platform\nexperiences. OpenXR 1.1 embodies the collective dedication of the Working\nGroup and the extended XR community to refine and advance the OpenXR standard\nwhile being responsive to the dynamic requirements of a rapidly evolving\necosystem,\" said Alfredo Muniz, Chair of the OpenXR Working Group.\n\n## Conformance Test Suite Enhancements\n\nThe OpenXR Conformance Test Suite (CTS), freely available on GitHub, includes\nupdates and enhancements for the functionality that has been integrated into\nthe OpenXR 1.1 core specification, enabling consistent implementation across\nall conformant platforms. A development version is published and an approved\nrelease for conformance submissions will be available in Q2.\n\n## OpenXR Roadmap and Call for Community Feedback\n\nThe OpenXR Working Group welcomes and encourages feedback from the XR\ndeveloper community on their experience with using OpenXR. Such feedback is\nessential input to prioritizing future developments on the OpenXR roadmap so\nthat the evolving real-world requirements of developers are met. For example,\nthe Working Group is currently exploring multiple functionality domains such\nas extending hand tracking to include full body tracking, and enhanced\nhandling of spatial entities to provide standardized methods to interact with\nthe user\u2019s environment in advanced spatial computing applications.\n\nPlease provide OpenXR feedback via the OpenXR Discord channel, OpenXR Forums,\nor the GitHub Issue Tracker.\n\n## Industry Support for OpenXR 1.1\n\n\u201cCollabora is thrilled about the release of OpenXR 1.1, a significant\nmilestone that underscores the importance of free standards in the XR\nindustry.
