But there is little\nconsensus about what the phrase \u2018lived experience\u2019 means, where it came from,\nand whether it has any value. Although long used by academics, it has become\nubiquitous, leaping out of the ivory tower and showing up in activism,\ngovernment, consulting, as well as popular culture. The Lived Experience\nLeaders Movement explains that those who have lived experiences have\n\u2018[d]irect, first-hand experience, past or present, of a social issue(s) and/or\ninjustice(s)\u2019. A recent brief from the US Department of Health and Human\nServices suggests that those who have lived experience have \u2018valuable and\nunique expertise\u2019 that should be consulted in policy work, since engaging\nthose with \u2018knowledge based on [their] perspective, personal identities, and\nhistory\u2019 can \u2018help break down power dynamics\u2019 and advance equity. A search of\nTwitter reveals a constant stream of use, from assertions like \u2018Your research\ndoesn\u2019t override my lived experience,\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not allowed\nto question someone\u2019s lived experience.\u2019\n\nA recurring theme is a connection between lived experience and identity. A\nrecent nominee for the US Secretary of Labor, Julie Su, is lauded as someone\nwho will \u2018bring her lived experience as a daughter of immigrants, a woman of\ncolor, and an Asian American to the role\u2019. The Human Rights Campaign asserts\nthat \u2018[l]aws and legislation must reflect the lived experiences of LGBTQ\npeople\u2019. An editorial in Nature Mental Health notes that incorporation of\n\u2018people with lived experience\u2019 has \u2018taken on the status of a movement\u2019 in the\nfield.\n\nCarried a step further, the notion of lived experience is bound up with what\nis often called identity politics, as when one claims to be speaking from the\nstandpoint of an identity group \u2013 \u2018in my lived experience as a...\u2019 or, simply,\n\u2018speaking as a...\u2019 Here, lived experience is often invoked to establish\nauthority and prompt deference from others since, purportedly, only members of\na shared identity know what it\u2019s like to have certain kinds of experience or\nto be a member of that group. Outsiders sense that they shouldn\u2019t criticise\nwhat is said because, grounded in lived experience, \u2018people\u2019s spoken truths\nare, in and of themselves, truths.\u2019 Criticism of lived experience might be\ntaken to invalidate or dehumanise others or make them feel unsafe.\n\nSo, what is lived experience? Where did it come from? And what does it have to\ndo with identity politics?\n\n\u2018Lived experience\u2019 is a translation of one of the two German words for\nexperience: Erlebnis. The other German word for experience, Erfahrung, is the\nolder of the two. It has as its root fahren, \u2018to journey\u2019. When one calls\nsomeone \u2018experienced\u2019, it is this kind of experience that is being appealed\nto. Erfahrung is experience that is cumulative \u2013 as one who has long journeyed\na path knows the road \u2013 and is associated with practice, skill and know-how.\nErfahrung can sometimes be translated as \u2018learning\u2019, and suggests experience\nthat might be gathered in the form of practical wisdom and passed on as\ntradition.\n\nErlebnis, by contrast, has Leben or \u2018life\u2019 as its root. Rather than experience\nthat accumulates over time or is held in the form of tradition, Erlebnis\nconnotes experience that is living and immediate. It is the province of the\npre-reflective and innocent, as opposed to the refined and distilled. Erlebnis\nimplies experience that is new, fresh and sometimes disruptive \u2013 what doesn\u2019t\neasily fit into the public, cultural patterns associated with Erfahrung.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th^ centuries, German philosophers developed and\nexploited the contrast between these two kinds of experience. This led\nphilosophers and translators in other languages \u2013 most notably, for our\npurposes, English and French \u2013 to add the qualifiers \u2018lived\u2019 or \u2018v\u00e9cue\u2019 to\nsignify when they were invoking Erlebnis as opposed to Erfahrung. So, while\nthe multifaceted English word \u2018experience\u2019 can be used to translate both\nErlebnis and Erfahrung, when someone wants to refer to the distinctive form of\nexperience picked out by Erlebnis, they often use \u2018lived experience\u2019 to do so.\n\nThe external world became the realm of \u2018facts\u2019, while meaning, value and\nfeeling were increasingly thought of as subjective\n\nAccording to Richard E Palmer in his book Hermeneutics (1969), Erlebnis first\nappeared in the plural form Erlebnisse in the work of Johann Wolfgang von\nGoethe, while Hans-Georg Gadamer suggests in Truth and Method (1960) that the\nfirst singular use can be found in one of G W F Hegel\u2019s letters. But the word\nreally didn\u2019t come into common usage until the 1870s. It was then that the\nGerman philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey brought Erlebnis into the mainstream, when\nhe used it in his 1870 biography of Friedrich Schleiermacher and in an 1877\nessay on Goethe, a version of which was later included in his highly regarded\nwork Das Erlebnis und die Dichtung (\u2018Poetry and Lived Experience\u2019; 1906).\n\nWhile himself a staunch empiricist, Dilthey was part of a Romantic movement\nreacting to earlier empiricists, positivists and Kantians, whom he believed\nrelied on an unduly narrow conception of experience. Since these philosophers\nwere primarily concerned to provide an epistemological foundation for the\nbudding natural sciences, they focused on the cognitive aspects of experience\n\u2013 that is, how experience can be used as the basis for scientific knowledge of\nthe kind produced by natural philosophers such as Isaac Newton.\n\nAt the risk of oversimplification, these thinkers focused primarily on\nsensation \u2013 the \u2018objective\u2019 world encountered by the senses and, in\nparticular, those aspects of sensory experience that could, through\nabstraction, be quantified, measured and shared. Other features of experience,\nsuch as meaning, significance, value, purpose, feeling and the like, were\nignored and relegated to the \u2018subjective\u2019 realm of \u2018inner experience\u2019. This\nepistemology created a split between subject and object, mind and world, fact\nand value. The external or objective world became the realm of \u2018facts\u2019, while\nmeaning, significance, value, purpose and feeling were increasingly thought of\nas subjective.\n\nWhile a Romantic, Dilthey was also insistent upon being more empirical than\nearlier empiricists. He saw his task as getting back behind the\nsubject/object, mind/world, fact/value split to embodied, full-blooded, living\nexperience. In a line from his work Introduction to the Human Sciences (1883),\nDilthey writes: \u2018No real blood flows in the veins of the knowing subject\nconstructed by Locke, Hume, and Kant, but rather the diluted extract of reason\nas a mere activity of thought.\u2019 Dilthey believed we have to return to\nconscious lived experience, not because the content of lived experience is\nindubitable but because we have no alternative. The only way we can know\nanything is through conscious experience.\n\nDilthey maintained that the subject/object split led us to the false belief\nthat the world of the natural sciences was the true or fundamental reality. By\ncontrast, Dilthey argued, since our original access to the world is through\nconscious experience, so-called objective reality is only the husk that\nremains by exsanguinating lived experience. This means that the world of the\nnatural sciences is not fundamental, but necessarily derivative. Dilthey\ndesigned the concept of Erlebnis (lived experience) to reflect the fact that,\nin our original experience, we know the world as a meaningful, coherent whole\n\u2013 a composite of inner and outer, subjective and objective, facts and values.\nOne can analyse the original whole of lived experience into subjective and\nobjective elements, but this analysis is only possible because subject and\nobject are originally bound up together in the fundamental reality of lived\nexperience.\n\nContemporary usage of lived experience still bears the mark of Dilthey\u2019s\noriginal formulations (a point I\u2019ve developed in more detail in other\nwritings). For Dilthey, lived experience should first be taken to signify the\nview from the inside, the \u2018what it\u2019s like\u2019 to be a human being. There is a\nstark difference between learning about the physics of colour and being\nawestruck by the prismatic beauty of a sunset; one thing to know about the\nbiochemistry involved in love and another to experience the extraordinary,\nineffable thrill of actually falling in love.\n\nBecause it is the \u2018view from the inside\u2019, lived experience belongs to the\nindividual and is emphatically personal as opposed to scientific experience,\nwhich Martin Jay, in his superb book Songs of Experience (2005), says belongs\nto the \u2018imagined collective subject, at once impersonal and immortal\u2019. As\nsuch, lived experience picks out the first-person perspective of everyday\nexperience as opposed to the third-person detached and dispassionate\nexperience of the sciences. \u2018Lived experience\u2019 is used to indicate pre-\nreflective experience as we ordinarily enjoy it \u2013 experience that is lived\nthrough, not looked at.\n\nLived experience is an embodied, not a purely cerebral, affair. As such, it\ninvolves thought, feelings and activity. When Dilthey talks about lived\nexperience, one should think about the back-and-forth relationship of an\norganism with its environment in an interactive, embodied way. We interact\nwith our environment because we have concerns and purposes. This means that,\nin lived experience, we respond affectively and volitionally to a world that\nshows up as immediately meaningful and significant. Meaning and value are not\nprojections of a free-floating mind, but we find them present as we interact\nwith our environment. If I am building a fence, the hammer and nails will show\nup as valuable tools to accomplish this goal, while the rocky ground will show\nup as an obstacle that elicits a feeling of frustration, and causes me to look\nfor a sturdier shovel. Lived experience should be thought of as encompassing\nthe subject and the object in an intelligible, coherent whole that involves\nunderstanding, feeling and action.\n\nA person who has read Romeo and Juliet will construe his experiences of love\ndifferently than someone who has not\n\nThe fact that the world shows up to us in relationship to our concerns and\npurposes highlights the fact that lived experience is fundamentally\ninterpretive, and interpretive at multiple levels. In addition to our purposes\nshaping our experiences, so does our personal history. Lived experience is\ninextricably temporal \u2013 the past resonates in the present and points us to the\nfuture. For example, my past experiences of joy in going to church, for\nexample, will enter into and shape my present experience of church itself, as\nwell as my desires going forward. Someone who has had negative experiences of\nchurch in the past will find their present experiences shaped in a different\nway. This is part of why we sometimes say that two people who have experienced\nthe same thing nevertheless have very different experiences.\n\nThe culture into which we are born also shapes our experiences. Dilthey was so\nconvinced of the indissolubility of the subjective and objective in lived\nexperience that he thought that \u2018objective spirit\u2019 \u2013 culture, essentially \u2013\nnot only frames but actively shapes our experiences as we live them. A young\nperson who has read Romeo and Juliet and been affected by it will construe his\nexperiences of love differently than someone who has not. Dilthey went so far\nas to claim that the musical genius is so immersed in music that she\nexperiences the world itself musically. This is all part and parcel of\nDilthey\u2019s hermeneutic conviction that might be expressed by saying that what\nwe bring to the world shapes what we find there.\n\nIn addition to the plurality that William James called \u2018stream of\nconsciousness\u2019, Dilthey also talked about a singular unit of meaning called\n\u2018lived experience\u2019. Much like \u2018a love affair\u2019 or \u2018the death of a loved one\u2019 is\nnot one event but a plurality that shares a common meaning, so often too is \u2018a\nlived experience\u2019. In memory, we gather various experiences with a shared\nmeaning and create a unity out of multiplicity. The whole that results can\nitself be called a \u2018lived experience\u2019. This usage is indicated in sayings such\nas \u2018my lived experience of mental illness\u2019 or \u2018my lived experience of sexism\u2019.\nHere, the speaker isn\u2019t usually referring to one single experience but a\nplurality that shares a single significance.\n\nImportantly, lived experience doesn\u2019t reach its final form until its meaning\nis teased out, codified and expressed \u2013 a process that involves conscious\ninterpretation. Rudolf Makkreel notes that, while for Dilthey lived experience\nhas a preliminary intelligibility, its full meaning requires this intermediary\nof reflection and expression. Ultimately, Dilthey thought that we must\ninterpret our own life experiences in the same way that we interpret others.\n\nThis dual meaning of lived experience \u2013 that it\u2019s both the unmediated material\nand the yield from conscious reflection \u2013 is reflected in contemporary usage\nwhen people say that lived experience isn\u2019t only direct experience but also\nknowledge that is gleaned from such experiences. It is also likely behind the\nambivalence that many feel about whether or not lived experience can be\ncommunicated and shared. So it\u2019s crucial to note that, in Dilthey\u2019s\nformulation, lived experience that has been codified can be communicated,\nespecially in the form of literature, poetry and autobiography. Though Dilthey\nbelieved it\u2019s not possible to communicate one\u2019s exact inner states \u2013\nunderstanding is always partial, and the life of the individual is ineffable \u2013\nhe nevertheless thought that our common humanity made it possible to come to\nunderstand \u2018what it\u2019s like\u2019 to be someone else.\n\nIn the 1940s and \u201950s, existentialists adopted the language of lived\nexperience. Sonia Kruks notes in Retrieving Experience (2001) that this\ncoincided with a turn towards identity politics, creating a link between the\ntwo that continues to the present. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote about the lived\nexperience of being a Jew (though he was not Jewish) in Anti-Semite and Jew\n(1946), Simone de Beauvoir wrote about the lived experience of being a woman\n(even titling the second volume of her magnum opus, The Second Sex (1949),\n\u2018L\u2019exp\u00e9rience v\u00e9cue\u2019 \u2013 a French rendering of Erlebnis), and Frantz Fanon, in\nBlack Skin, White Masks (1952), wrote about \u2018the lived experience of the black\nman\u2019. A central theme of this period is a call for a return to lived\nexperience combined with a recognition of the distorting effect of the\ndominant culture, of ideology, of \u2018naturalised\u2019 categories such as race and\ngender, which warp one\u2019s experience of oneself and tempt one to live\ninauthentically.\n\nProbably no contemporary philosopher has done more to help us understand\nidentity politics than Charles Taylor, especially in his book The Ethics of\nAuthenticity (1991) and his essay \u2018The Politics of Recognition\u2019 (1995). Taylor\ninvites us to see identity politics as a response to the persistent human need\nfor recognition \u2013 for one\u2019s most authentic self to be seen and valued. Whereas\nin premodernity, recognition would be assured by fulfilling one\u2019s preset\nsocial role, now recognition is no longer guaranteed. Accordingly, Taylor\nsays, the unique expression of one\u2019s authentic self \u2013 what we would now call\nan \u2018identity\u2019 \u2013 must be explicitly acknowledged. Taylor argues that the demand\nfor recognition is tied to the romantic notion that there is a true or\nauthentic self that has been obscured by society. In this romantic framing,\n\u2018[o]ur moral salvation comes from recovering authentic moral contact with\nourselves.\u2019\n\nIf others don\u2019t and can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like \u2013 then the only alternative is\nto defer to those who have privileged knowledge\n\nAnd so, today, many feel it is their duty to undergo a process of self-\nexploration to find their authentic self, especially when that self belongs to\nan identity which is viewed as historically marginalised and oppressed. The\ngoal is no longer simply self-realisation \u2013 to become who one is \u2013 but to\ndemand recognition on behalf of that identity group, thus fostering political\nchange by undermining the structures which have inhibited the authentic way of\nliving of marginalised people.\n\nLived experience plays a central role in this process in several ways. First,\nit has become a marker of authenticity. A commonplace among today\u2019s\nintelligentsia is that historical categories don\u2019t match the lived experience\nof marginalised people. Miranda Fricker has designated this phenomenon\n\u2018hermeneutical injustice\u2019. Hermeneutical injustice occurs when a marginalised\nperson is unable to understand their own social reality or experiences because\nthe resources for understanding experience are created by those who are\ndominantly situated in culture. This echoes Fanon\u2019s argument that many\nphilosophical categories present in culture \u2013 even the master/slave dialectic\nin Hegel \u2013 were not created with Black experience in mind. Talk of lived\nexperience thus becomes a way of signalling authenticity because one\u2019s\nexperiences aren\u2019t reflected in the dominant culture.\n\nSecond, invoking lived experience has become a way of achieving epistemic and\npolitical authority, usually by claiming that people with marginalised\nidentities have privileged access to knowledge that others are ill-equipped to\nunderstand or critique. \u2018You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like\u2019 is a popular refrain.\nIf others don\u2019t and indeed can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like \u2013 then the only\nalternative is to defer to those who have privileged knowledge. When the\nauthority of lived experience is felt, then language like \u2018Speaking as a...\u2019\nbecomes a way of signalling privileged knowledge which others should defer to.\nThe truths of lived experience are now offered, in the words of Raymond\nWilliams, \u2018not only as truths, but as the most authentic kind of truths\u2019. By\nthe same token, members of culturally dominant groups can use the same\nlanguage to express humility and deference towards others \u2013 \u2018Speaking as a\nwhite man...\u2019, \u2018I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like,\u2019 and so on.\n\nThird, lived experience becomes a way of boundary policing. Appeals like\n\u2018Speaking as a...\u2019 can prompt reflexive deference only if we engage in what\nGayatri Chakravorty Spivak called \u2018strategic essentialism\u2019 \u2013 that is, only if\nwe behave as if groups are monolithic and homogeneous (which they aren\u2019t).\nKwame Anthony Appiah points out that, if Black people seek recognition as\nBlack people (which is entirely reasonable, given how that identity was\nconstructed for the purpose of denigration and oppression), this goes hand in\nhand with creating boundaries \u2013 what it means to be \u2018authentically\u2019 Black. In\nthis context, talk of lived experience can be used to police what counts as\nauthentic Blackness, creating a kind of social prison. As he puts it in his\nessay \u2018Identity, Authenticity, Survival\u2019 (1995), \u2018[b]etween the politics of\nrecognition and the politics of compulsion, there is no bright line.\u2019 In other\nwords, if the authority of lived experience is to have weight, only the\nexperience of some people can be allowed to count. If one transgresses against\ncertain boundaries, then one\u2019s status as an \u2018authentic\u2019 member of the group \u2013\nand the importance of one\u2019s experiences \u2013 can be questioned.\n\nIt is perhaps not surprising that those who routinely deploy lived experience\nfor political purposes haven\u2019t been particularly critical about its use. Yet\nit was concerns of the kind that Appiah expressed that led Joan W Scott to\nargue in \u2018The Evidence of Experience\u2019 (1991) that reliance on lived experience\nhas unexpected and heavy costs (an argument echoed in many ways by Wendy\nBrown). If, in seeking to empower, say, Black women, we encourage them to\nshare their experiences as Black women (\u2018In my lived experience as a Black\nwoman...\u2019), this surreptitiously reinforces or \u2018reifies\u2019 (freezes and treats\nas real, timeless and natural) historically constructed categories like\n\u2018Black\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019. Rather than liberating marginalised people, using this\nlanguage risks making us complicit in the persistence of categories that\nshould be deconstructed.\n\nAppeals to lived experience as a purely subjective experience that is\nunanswerable or not subject to critique are questionable at best. While some\nuse \u2018lived experience\u2019 as if it indicates something indubitable and certain,\nbringing it close to purely subjective notions like qualia, this doesn\u2019t\nsquare with the obvious fact that we can misunderstand our own experiences.\nSomehow we\u2019ve forgotten the lesson that earlier thinkers knew: ideology can\ndistort and oppression corrupt even our own self-understanding. As Appiah\npointed out in The Guardian in November 2020, experience \u2018is never unmediated\nand self-interpreting\u2019. This means that lived experience doesn\u2019t warrant\nreflexive deference, even though lived experience has become so closely tied\nto identity and dignity that others\u2019 refusal to defer or their willingness to\nask questions or critique may feel like erasure.\n\nWe need more than lived experience to work for positive social change\n\nIt\u2019s worth calling attention to the fact that, since lived experience is\nfundamentally interpretive, it is a questionable foundation for authenticity.\nFollowing the recognition that people from marginalised communities have\nexperiences that aren\u2019t reflected in the language and concepts of the dominant\nculture, there has been a push for the creation of new conceptual categories\nto fill the void \u2013 to name an authentic reality previously obscured by society\n(such as new gender or sexual identities, so-called microaggressions, etc).\nHowever, there has been insufficient attention to the fact that new language\nand concepts may not just reflect experiences but create them. Dilthey argued\nthat our own individual experiences are more than just subjective feelings but\nembody objective cultural structures, language, concepts, and the like. That\nis, objective meanings and structures permeate our lives, not just at the\nlevel of reflective interpretation, but at the level of lived experience\nitself. Think of how, among others, concepts such as Black/white, man/woman,\nChristian/Muslim/Hindu, Autistic/bipolar/OCD/neurotypical,\nprivileged/underprivileged shape our experiences of ourselves and others.\n\nIf this is right, then it\u2019s possible that lived experience and language are in\na relationship much like the one that Taylor argues exists between nationalism\nand states \u2013 nationalism creates states but then states also produce\nnationalism. So, lived experience gives rise to new concepts but then new\nconcepts give rise to new lived experiences. In at least some cases, new\nlanguage may create as much as reflect the experiences that it refers to. If\nDilthey is right that culture enters into and shapes lived experience, then we\nmust be cautious about allowing lived experience to function as the touchstone\nof authenticity. Our concepts don\u2019t just reveal, but create \u2018who one truly\nis.\u2019\n\nIn her essay \u2018Essentialism and Experience\u2019 (1991), bell hooks writes that\n\u2018[i]dentity politics emerges out of the struggles of oppressed or exploited\ngroups to have a standpoint on which to critique dominant structures.\u2019 For\nmany today, the authority of lived experience is thought to provide precisely\nthat standpoint. The problem is that lived experience isn\u2019t a pure foundation\nthat escapes the intrusion of language, theory and culture, and therefore\ncan\u2019t be used as the basis of authority or authenticity to which others should\nreflexively defer. We need more than lived experience to work for positive\nsocial change.\n\nSo, where do we go from here? What is a proper role for lived experience in\nour society and our politics? We should start by acknowledging that lived\nexperience is, in fact, valuable. It should be obvious that people have\ndifferent experiences, and that we should all cultivate not only a readiness\nto listen to those who do but an openness to learning from them as well. In\npolicymaking, those who have direct experience of the effects of policies\nshould be consulted \u2013 and not only because they may have knowledge that\npolicymakers may lack, but because, as the \u2018nothing about us, without us\u2019\nmotto of the disability rights movement highlights, they are often the primary\nstakeholders. Lived experience can thus serve as a check on creeping\ntechnocratic bureaucracies which have an affinity for losing touch with\nreality.\n\nAt the same time, we could be more thoughtful about how we employ lived\nexperience. To start, we should recognise that lived experience \u2013 and research\nbased on it \u2013 doesn\u2019t trump other forms of enquiry but complements it. As C S\nLewis put it in his essay \u2018Meditation in a Toolshed\u2019 (1945), if we want to\nunderstand the world, we should, insofar as possible, view things from the\ninside and from the outside. The two perspectives should stand in creative\ntension.\n\nIncommunicable lived experience might serve as a licence for political\nauthority, but it can never serve as the basis of solidarity\n\nAlong the same lines, we should be judicious about the use of identity\ncategories and, insofar as possible, refrain from treating them like they are\nnatural and eternal, remaining mindful of the interrelationship between our\nconcepts and experience. While identity is not simply a matter of self-\ndescription, we should recognise that many people do not \u2018identify with\u2019 and\nare not motivated by the identities that others ascribe to them. Even when\nthey do so identify, we should be careful not to treat all members of a group\nas if they\u2019re the same or all have the same experiences and interpretations of\nthose experiences. We shouldn\u2019t include only those who have had the \u2018right\u2019\nkind of lived experience or learned the \u2018right\u2019 lessons from those\nexperiences. When we do that, we\u2019re not really utilising lived experience at\nall, but politics, and we are merely exploiting \u2018people with lived experience\u2019\nfor political reasons.\n\nFinally, we should let go of the notion that only members of one\u2019s own group\ncan understand \u2018what it\u2019s like\u2019 to have one\u2019s experiences. If we persist in\nsaying lived experience is private and can\u2019t be shared, we undermine the\nimpetus for trying to understand experiences other than those of one\u2019s own\ngroup. This fracturing along identity lines is disastrous for a liberal-\ndemocratic polity where durable social change is largely predicated upon\nsolidarity across difference. Incommunicable lived experience might serve as a\nlicence for political authority and a demand for deference, but it can never\nserve as the basis of solidarity. Instead, we should encourage people to have\nthe courage to try to understand experiences other than their own. Emily\nTilton and Briana Toole rightly argue that, if our openness to the experiences\nof others is to be personally and socially transformative, one\u2019s posture can\u2019t\nbe one of passive deference, but one of active and collaborative enquiry.\nLived experience \u2013 especially when it falls outside of the mainstream \u2013 can\nand should serve as a catalyst for enquiry and dialogue. And the mark of a\ngenuine conversation is you never know where you\u2019ll end up.\n\nKnowledgeHistory of ideasPolitical philosophy\n\n18 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nMetaphysics\n\nThe enchanted vision\n\nLove is much more than a mere emotion or moral ideal.
