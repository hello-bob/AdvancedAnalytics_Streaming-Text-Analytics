The current decade is where efficiency takes an\nAI-fueled leap forward, and things get exponentially messier. Software once\nmerely digitized and augmented human work and services, but in automation 2.0,\nbots become brains.\n\nAI companies are leading a transition from Software-as-a-Service to Service-\nas-Software, turning the table on the very essence of SaaS. In the software\nbusiness, a company may sell access to its platform or tool, but customers are\nstill responsible for using that tool to achieve the desired outcome. In the\nservices business, responsibility for achieving the desired outcome sits with\nthe company selling the service. Instead of QuickBooks, you offer tax\nservices\u2014in this case, conducted by an AI accountant. The upside of this\nchange is huge\u2014a $4.6 trillion opportunity, since the global services market\ndwarfs the software market in size.\n\nFoundation Capital has been investing in the intelligent automation space for\nmore than a decade (backing old-school successful startups like cloud\nmanagement platform CliQr, document manager SpringCM, and others). Our\nconfidence in newer companies like Eightfold, Tonkean, Turing, and Ikigai\ncomes after years studying the evolution of such ventures. We\u2019ve already\ntraced the history of intelligent process automation, focusing on three\nspecific waves of innovation. Here we\u2019ll explore the implications of the\nparadigm shift to Service-as-Software\u2014or more aptly, Software-as-Autonomous-\nService\u2014detailing the scale of the opportunity for AI-focused founders.\n\n## AI eats software, now salaries + services\n\nEnterprise leaders have spent decades using software to fuel their companies\u2019\ngrowth. And software has become the backbone of the modern technical economy.\nTen years ago there were only 15 SaaS or software unicorns. Today there are\n416. The total public market cap of enterprise software companies exceeds $1\ntrillion. Recent growth has been spurred by shifting on-premise software to\nthe cloud, and by the fact that software gobbled up the hardware part of IT\nspending.\n\nIn the coming decade, we believe software will continue to boost productivity\nand also will take a bite out of the services market.\n\nHow will it work? Let\u2019s take the sales function as an example.\n\nThe basic value prop of software like Salesforce: a human sales rep enters\ndata, and Salesforce helps create and organize their workflow. Voila!\nProductivity boosted.\n\nIntroducing AI, especially agentic AI, sends productivity soaring. LLM-powered\nAI agents can read and interpret structured and unstructured content, generate\noutput, set priorities, and direct tasks, much like a skilled human performing\na service. Because agents are capable of complex decision-making and autonomy,\nsoftware doesn\u2019t stop at organizing a workflow. It fundamentally alters how a\njob is executed.\n\nAutomating work is not a new trend. But the scale changes when AI can do work\nthat was once handled by whole categories of highly skilled workers. Think of\nit this way: Salesforce, one of the most successful software companies of all\ntime, generates only $35 billion in revenue annually and will grow\nincrementally. Global companies spend $1.1 trillion on sales and marketing\nsalaries each year. The size of the opportunity for AI disruption is many\nmultiples larger than Salesforce could ever be.\n\nSources: Turing, Statistica\n\n## The $4.6-trillion-dollar question\n\nSo how much work will AI + automation and the Service-as-Software model do\naway with? We believe this is a $4.6 trillion-dollar question. Just a few\nmarket overview figures give a sense for what\u2019s at stake within the next five\nyears. We look at the areas to be automated in two buckets:\n\n  1. Salaries of jobs globally ($2.3 trillion in sales & marketing, software engineering, security, and HR; see chart above), plus\n  2. The amount spent on outsourced services and salaries\u2014both IT services and business process services ($2.3 trillion, per Gartner)\n\nHere\u2019s how we break down the approximately $4.6 trillion.\n\n### Business services, A to Z\n\nIn enterprise companies, services get chopped up into IT services and business\nprocess services. (The history of these markets are fascinating globalization\ntales. American companies learned long ago that they gained significant cost\nsavings by outsourcing IT services teams in India, and India currently exports\nsome $240 billion each year in IT services.) Gartner estimates current\nworldwide spending on IT services at $1.5 trillion in 2024, which will reach\n$2.3 trillion by 2028. They estimate the size of the business process services\nmarket will reach $303 billion by 2027.\n\nWhat\u2019s important here is that as more companies roll out AI customer service\nagents, AI troubleshooters, and AI assistants of every stripe, the potential\nfor AI to automate both full-time positions and services is enormous.\n\nIn DevOps circles, companies have long wanted to integrate logs, incident\nmanagement, and infrastructure management. In the service-as-software world,\ninstead of selling tools for infrastructure management or monitoring, the\nfocus shifts to the management and monitoring itself. DevOps Company X sells\non-call AI agents built to solve software incidents autonomously. They reduce\nMTTR, meaning time to repair. The company also sells AI technical support\nengineers, reducing unnecessary ticket escalations by troubleshooting tricky\ntechnical issues and intelligently triaging themselves.\n\nNot only does this outcome-oriented approach align the cost of the unit of\nsoftware with the associated business value (by removing the opacity that\nexists without easily attributable results), but it also unlocks a much more\nscalable business model. Vendors won\u2019t have a financial incentive to limit\nusage of their product and can grow in lockstep with their customers. AI\ncompanies generally encourage more usage of their product, since more use\nhelps them gather better data.\n\n> An outcome-oriented approach aligns the cost of the unit of software with\n> the associated business value (by removing the opacity that exists without\n> easily attributable results).\n\nBusiness process services (think data entry or audio transcription) is an area\nthat\u2019s long been ripe for disruption, since it involves many repetitive, rule-\nbased tasks. Again, what makes AI so powerful here is its ability to grasp\ncontext, interpret user intent, apply reasoning, and adapt to new tasks. In\nthe software-as-autonomous-service realm, jobs like making recruiting calls\n(ConverzAI), answering potential buyers\u2019 commonly-asked questions (Docket), or\nentering data and reading faxes (Tennr) are entirely handled by AI. Gartner\nsays AI- and generative AI-enabled technologies are projected to inject $28\nbillion into the business process services market in the next four years.\n\nIn the market map below, we\u2019ve outlined what the Service-as-Software shift\nlooks like for several in-house and outsourced functions, along with roles to\nbe automated and key companies leading this wave.\n\n### Sales & Marketing\n\nIn our sales example, a skilled sales rep is used to writing outbound emails,\nscheduling demos, following up, and meeting clients for dinner. AI can now do\neverything but eat dinner.\n\n> A sales rep is used to writing outbound emails, scheduling demos, following\n> up, and meeting clients for dinner. AI can now do everything but eat dinner.\n\nOur portfolio company Wizia anticipated this change by building an \u201c\u2019AI SDR,\u201d\nwhich takes on the full workflow of email outbound\u2014sourcing contacts,\nvalidating info, researching target accounts, writing highly personalized\nsequences, etc.\n\nThe shift in business model for sales companies might look like this: Rather\nthan charging customers per seat based on the number of sales-development\nrepresentatives (SDRs) and account executives (AEs) on a platform, software\nvendors instead charge based on the number of qualified opportunities or\nsigned customers their software delivers.\n\n### Software Engineering\n\nThere are more than 30 million software engineers and data scientists\nglobally, representing nearly $1 trillion in salaries. AI is transforming how\nthose developers build and maintain software and data systems.\n\nThat starts with people\u2019s workflows\u2014whether that\u2019s AI orchestrating a code\nreview, automating front-end design, or fully authoring documentation. Take\nCursor, for example. It\u2019s essentially autocomplete for coding, letting coders\ndigest third-party code libraries and auto-debug their own.\n\n### Cybersecurity\n\nIn cybersecurity, AI can perform tasks that are both too complex and too time-\nconsuming for human analysts, in an industry that\u2019s chronically understaffed.\nSecurity analysts are often drowning in alerts, raising the risk of large-\nscale breaches. AI lets companies use automation to more efficiently detect\nand respond to attacks. And they can review and mitigate vulnerabilities as\nthey create new systems. Our portfolio company AirMDR, started by the founder\nof Sumo Logic, is doing exactly this\u2014building a virtual analyst to provide\nsecurity at a fraction of the cost to small and medium businesses.\n\n## A SaaS evolution, not extinction\n\nThe arrival of AI-powered solutions and their push into services doesn\u2019t\nalways spell the end for the SaaS model. In many markets, we\u2019re seeing a\ndynamic in which multiple business models coexist and thrive.\n\n> The arrival of AI-powered solutions and their push into services does not\n> always spell the end for the SaaS model.\n\nSome customer segments may choose functions to outsource, while others will\nkeep those functions in-house. At many companies, there\u2019s a human-in-the-loop\nvs human-out-of-the-loop debate shaping up around each part of a task or line\nof business. Humans still design the workflows. Even in the most rote\noperations, like invoice processing, they perform spot checks and look in on\nproblem cases. In the end, in any vertical, an AI-powered company may\nchallenge or displace a SaaS incumbent, or it may offer a complementary\nbusiness that can work alongside it.\n\nOne thing is certain: service-as-software represents a once-in-a-lifetime\nshift, with AI at the leading edge. This development points to a future where\nservices are not just delivered as software but are constantly learning and\nevolving alongside us. Foundation Capital backs entrepreneurs from the\nearliest stages, so if you\u2019re working at this convergence of automation,\nservices, and AI, we\u2019d love to hear from you.
