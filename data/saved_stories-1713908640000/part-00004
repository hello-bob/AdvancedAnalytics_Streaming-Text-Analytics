Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Spotify\n\nWhen Spotify announced its largest-ever round of layoffs in December, CEO\nDaniel Ek hailed a new age of efficiency at the streaming giant. But four\nmonths on, it seems he and his executives weren\u2019t prepared for how tough\nfilling in for 1,500 axed workers would be.\n\nThe music streamer enjoyed record quarterly profits of \u20ac168 million ($179\nmillion) in the first three months of 2024, enjoying double-digit revenue\ngrowth to \u20ac3.6 billion ($3.8 billion) in the process.\n\nHowever, the company failed to hit its guidance on profitability and monthly\nactive user growth.\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem to put off investors, who sent shares in the group soaring more\nthan 8% in New York after markets opened Tuesday morning.\n\n## Layoffs hit Spotify\u2019s guidance\n\nStill, as he addressed those investors following the latest earnings release,\nEk didn\u2019t shy away from the obstacles that stopped the streamer from hitting\nsome of its targets this year.\n\nIn addition to surprisingly successful 2023 growth to compare against and the\nimpacts of falling marketing spend, Ek blamed operational difficulties linked\nto staffing for the group missing its earnings target to start the year.\n\nIn December, Spotify culled 1,500 jobs, equivalent to 17% of employees, as\npart of an aggressive efficiency drive as the group strived for profitability.\n\nStaff costs for those employees carried a long tail, as most workers received\nfive-month severance packages when they were let go in December.\n\nAt the same time, the footprint left behind by those employees was bigger than\nEk and his executives anticipated.\n\n\u201cAnother significant challenge was the impact of December workforce\nreduction,\u201d Ek said on an investors call following Spotify\u2019s Q1 earnings\nrelease.\n\n\u201cAlthough there\u2019s no question that it was the right strategic decision, it did\ndisrupt our day-to-day operations more than we anticipated.\n\n\u201cIt took us some time to find our footing, but more than four months into this\ntransition, I think we\u2019re back on track and I expect to continue improving on\nour execution throughout the year getting us to an even better place than\nwe\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nEk didn\u2019t elaborate on what aspects of operations were most affected by the\nlayoffs.\n\n## Layoffs right decision?\n\nBack in December as the platform he founded faced persistent losses and a\nfalling share price, Spotify CEO Ek used a well-trodden path by tech giants to\nsteer the ship around: mass layoffs.\n\n\u201cWe still have too many people dedicated to supporting work and even doing\nwork around the work, rather than contributing to opportunities with real\nimpact,\u201d Ek said in a memo as he announced he would be cutting his workforce\nby 17%.\n\nInvestors initially reacted well to the news, though skeptical voices asked\nwhether the move merely put a sticking plaster over harder-to-solve issues at\nthe group, particularly its low margins thanks to the costs of bumper record\ndeals.\n\nHowever, it appears to have worked so far. In the four months since the layoff\nannouncements, shares in the group have jumped more than 60%.\n\nSpotify has also recently proved it is able to raise prices in some of its key\nmarkets without seeing a flight of listeners to rival services like Apple\nMusic.\n\nIn the long run, Spotify and Ek also remain convinced the tough round of\nlayoffs has set Spotify up for long-term profitability.\n\nThe apparent collective surprise at how that can affect operations in the\nshort run, though, marks a dash of hubris for the newly bullish streaming\ngroup.\n\n## Latest in Tech\n\n  * 3 hours ago\n  * Tech - Spotify\n\n## Spotify CEO Daniel Ek surprised by how much laying off 1,500 employees\nnegatively affected the streaming giant\u2019s operations\n\nBYRyan Hogg\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n  * 6 hours ago\n  * Tech - TikTok\n\n## EU warns it\u2019ll suspend TikTok\u2019s new Lite app for its \u2018toxic and addictive\u2019\nwatch-for-rewards feature that allegedly endangers kids\n\nBYPrarthana Prakash\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n  * 7 hours ago\n  * Tech - return to office\n\n## Stripe CEO says he used to be a \u2018misanthropic introvert\u2019 and would still\nprefer to be a \u2018cave dweller\u2019 than work in the office\n\nBYRyan Hogg\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Tech - Volkswagen (VW)\n\n## After being overtaken by BYD, Volkswagen meets with doubtful investors to\npersuade them of turnaround plan\n\nBYSonja Wind, Isolde MacDonogh, and others\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n  * 3 days ago\n  * Tech - sports\n\n## AI is shaking up how sports like rugby, soccer and cricket are played\u2014and\ncould mint big money for sports clubs\n\nBYPrarthana Prakash\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\n  * 4 days ago\n  * Tech - A.I.\n\n## WHO\u2019s new AI-powered chatbot SARAH is available 24/7 and in eight languages\n\u2013 but it\u2019s blundering some answers\n\nBYJessica Nix and Bloomberg\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Finance\n\n## The outlook for home prices has changed drastically in just the past month\nas Fed rate cuts look more and more distant\n\nBYJason Ma\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n  * 6 hours ago\n  * Politics\n\n## Baltimore accuses the owner and operator of Dali ship that collapsed bridge\nof providing \u2018incompetent\u2019 crew and \u2018clearly unseaworthy\u2019 vessel\n\nBYEleanor Pringle\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n  * 4 days ago\n  * Health\n\n## Your reusable water bottle may be a breeding ground for strep and fecal\nbacteria.
