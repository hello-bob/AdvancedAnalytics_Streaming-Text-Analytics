Dealbook Summit 2023 at\nJazz at Lincoln Center on November 29, 2023 in New York City.\n\nSlaven Vlasic | Getty Images\n\nTesla shares fell for a seventh straight day, reaching their lowest since\nJanuary 2023, as further price cuts over the weekend added to mounting\nconcerns heading into the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings report Tuesday.\n\nThe stock dropped 3.4% on Monday to close at $142.05, bringing its decline for\nthe year to 43%, second worst among members of the S&P 500.\n\nTesla cut prices in the U.S., China and throughout Europe, with reductions of\nas much as $2,000 on the company\u2019s most popular electric vehicles, the Model Y\nSUV and entry-level Model 3 sedan. Tesla also lowered the price of its premium\ndriver assistance system by one-third. The system is marketed as the Full\nSelf-Driving, or FSD, option, though it requires a human driver at the wheel,\nready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nThe FSD option, which previously cost $12,000 up front or $199 per month on a\nsubscription basis for most customers in the U.S., is now listed on Tesla\u2019s\nwebsite at $8,000 upfront and $99 for a monthly subscription. The price cut\nfollows a monthlong free trial that Tesla pushed out to customers throughout\nNorth America starting in late March.\n\nThe latest reductions add to investors\u2019 growing fears following weak first-\nquarter deliveries, layoffs and a Cybertruck recall.\n\nLast week, Tesla issued a voluntary recall on 3,878 Cybertruck vehicles to\nrepair a serious \u201ctrapped pedal\u201d defect seen in a viral TikTok video from a\nCybertruck owner.\n\nAccording to a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,\na pad on top of the Cybertruck\u2019s accelerator pedal could come loose and get\ntrapped in the interior trim causing \u201cunintended acceleration.\u201d\n\nPrior to the recall notice and price cuts, Tesla had initiated a steep and\nmessy restructuring, informing employees early last week that it would be\ncutting more than 10% of its global workforce. The layoffs are ongoing, with\nsome employees receiving notifications their jobs were eliminated in the last\ncouple days, according to two current employees, who spoke with CNBC on\ncondition that their names be withheld from publication.\n\nTesla plans to discuss first-quarter earnings on a call Tuesday afternoon\nafter releasing results. Analysts are expecting a 5.1% drop in revenue,\naccording to LSEG, which would be the first year-over-year decline since the\nsecond quarter of 2020, when the Covid pandemic disrupted operations.\n\n\u201cSince late 2023, sentiment on Tesla (TSLA) has deteriorated,\u201d John Murphy, an\nanalyst at Bank of America, wrote in a note on Monday. Murphy said he expects\ninvestors will \u201cfocus heavily on commentary related to growth initiatives,\u201d\nspecifically the Model 2 \u201cnext-gen platform,\u201d and the robotaxi.\n\nReuters reported that, at Musk\u2019s direction, Tesla is \u201cscrapping\u201d plans to\nlaunch a very affordable Model 2 electric car in the near term and will\ninstead focus on development of a robotaxi.\n\nJoseph Spak, an analyst at UBS, wrote in a Monday report that investors should\n\u201cexpect some fireworks\u201d on the call, adding that automotive gross margins for\nTesla, not including environmental credits, and free cash flow will be key\nmetrics.\n\n\u201cA negative free cashflow quarter appears possible,\u201d Spak wrote. That cash\nbecomes more important to the Tesla story because \u201cthe current environment\ndoesn\u2019t allow funding of both\u201d the robotaxi and a more affordable new EV.\n\nTraders betting against Tesla are reaping rewards from the stock slide.\n\nShort interest in the EV maker stood at around 111 million shares, or 4% of\nfloat, representing $16.3 billion in notional value as of the first half of\nthe day on Monday, according to S3 Partners. Tesla short sellers are up an\nestimated $9.4 billion this year, making it the most profitable short in the\nU.S. market, way ahead of Apple at $3 billion.\n\n\u2014 CNBC\u2019s Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\n\nWATCH: Tesla stock hits 52-week low ahead of earnings\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:4502:45\n\nTesla stock hits new 52-week low ahead of earnings\n\nSquawk on the Street\n\nTV\n\nMad MoneyWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Last Call 07:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
