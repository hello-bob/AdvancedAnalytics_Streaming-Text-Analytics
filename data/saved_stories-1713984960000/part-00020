These events, symptoms of larger changes worldwide, beg the\nquestion: How has the planet evolved throughout our lifetimes? Or more\nspecifically, how does our current world compare to the world when we were\nborn? Human existence may be short in the grand scheme of things, but our\nimpact has accelerated the pace of global warming. Looking ahead, it's\nimportant to consider how our decisions today shape the future\u2014not only for\nourselves but also for future generations.\n\nBelow, each stripe represents the annual temperature change relative to pre-\nindustrial levels, defined as the long-term average between 1850-1900.\nHistorical temperature anomalies calculated by the World Meteorological\nOrganization (WMO) are depicted until 2023, while projections based on the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) five Shared Socioeconomic\nPathways are represented from 2023 onwards.\n\n1Your birth year:\n\n2Famous person:\n\n3Scenario:\n\n-0.4\u00b0C 4.8\u00b0C\n\n1 Select your birth year\n\nThe background color represents the temperature anomaly of your birth year.\nYears range from 1924 to 2023.\n\n2 Select one of the following people for comparison\n\n1926\n\nDavid Attenborough\n\n1941\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n1963\n\nMichael Jordan\n\n1982\n\nAli Wong\n\n1997\n\nNaomi Osaka\n\n2003\n\nGreta Thunberg\n\n2022\n\n8 billionth baby\n\n2040\n\nFuture baby\n\nThe background color of the tiles represents the temperature anomaly of each\nindividual's birth year.\n\n3 Select a projected climate scenario\n\nShared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are five climate change scenarios that\nproject different societal, demographic, and economic changes up to the year\n2100.

We used historical data from the World\nMeteorological Organization (WMO), calculating the mean of six datasets:\nHadCRUT5, NOAA, GlobalTemp, GISTEMP, ERA5 1, and JRA55. We also referenced the\nWMO\u2019s \"State of the Global Climate 2023\" report. The data for the projected\ntemperature anomalies based on the five SSP scenarios after 2023 are from the\nIPCC Sixth Assessment report. Ideally, the historical and projected data would\ncome from the same source, but IPCC\u2019s historical data is not as up-to-date as\nWMO\u2019s data. Because of this, we\u2019ve chosen to combine two sources. However, if\nmore updated projected temperatures after 2024 for the SSP scenarios are\navailable, we'd be happy to use this data. The original climate stripes\nconcept was developed by Ed Hawkins; our adaptation is one of many.\n\nCredit: Data / Development / Interaction design / Narrative: Julia Janicki\nDesign / Illustrtion: Daisy Chung Text edit: Joyce Chou Additional help: Jacki\nWhisenant\n\n", "frontpage": false}
