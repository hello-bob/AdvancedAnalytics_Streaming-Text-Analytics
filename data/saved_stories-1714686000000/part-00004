The doctored video clip featured real footage of Khan promoting\nhis reality talk show Satyamev Jayate, but his voice was cloned to criticize\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \u201cHere every citizen is a millionaire.\nEveryone should have at least 15 lakh \u2014 what do you say? You don\u2019t have this\namount, so where did your 15 lakh rupees go?\u201d Khan says in the clip. The\ndeepfake video ends with him endorsing the Congress party, and asking viewers\nto \u201cbeware of tricksters,\u201d alluding to the BJP. The video is particularly\nsignificant because of the religious subtext: a Muslim actor calling out\nunfulfilled promises from Modi\u2019s Hindu-nationalist BJP. The \u201c15 lakh\u201d in the\nspeech is a reference to Modi\u2019s comments during a 2014 political rally, in\nwhich he railed against tax avoidance. Specifically, Modi said that if the\nuntaxed money was ever returned to India, it would be worth 1,500,000 rupees\n($18,000) for every Indian. Opposition groups have framed the comments as an\nunfulfilled promise by Modi to deposit the money in the bank accounts of every\nIndian \u2014 although the BJP denies any such promise was made. The fact-checking\norganization Boom has debunked the video, identifying the source footage and\nlabeling it as manipulated. Khan has filed a police complaint against the\nunknown creator.

Al Jazeera reported that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party\nhad used Karunanidhi\u2019s image in AI videos \u2014 they showed the late politician,\nwho was DMK president and chief minister of Tamil Nadu state, praising his\nson, MK Stalin, who is the state\u2019s current chief minister. In one video in\nJanuary, the AI politician made an appearance at a book launch; in another, he\naddressed a youth event associated with his former party. The videos feature\nKarunanidhi facing the viewer while wearing dark sunglasses, though his mouth\nmovements do not quite align with the words spoken.\n\n##### Related\n\n    * How AI is resurrecting dead Indian politicians as elections loom (aljazeera.com)\n    * Sun News' video on YouTube (youtube.com)\n    * A second video posted to X (twitter.com)\n\n  * India 6 Jan 2024\n\n### BJP leader recast as popular \u201csofa kid\u201d meme\n\nElection | 19 April - 1 June 2024\n\nIndiaVideoInstagram\n\nIn January, a video circulated on Instagram poking fun at southern BJP leader\nK Annamalai, suggesting he was growing desperate in his efforts to bring\nvoters in Tamil Nadu over to the BJP. The video grafts Annamalai\u2019s likeness\nonto videos of \u201cSofa Boy\u201d, a young boy whose aggressive sales tactics on\nInstagram have become a popular meme in India. For viewers familiar with the\nmeme, the implication is that the ruling BJP party, which is unpopular in\nTamil Nadu, is hard-selling its policies in order to get elected. By April,\nthe video had garnered nearly 3 million views on Instagram.\n\n##### Related\n\n    * The altered \"Sofa Boy\" video on Instagram (instagram.com)\n\n  * Taiwan 5 Jan 2024\n\n### Videos proclaim Taiwanese president\u2019s \u201csecret history\u201d\n\nElection | 13 Jan 2024\n\nTaiwanYouTubeInstagramXWeiboFacebookVideo\n\nA week before Taiwanese voters headed to the polls, dozens of similar videos\nwith explosive headlines about President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s \u201csecret history\u201d began\nflooding YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Weibo, and X. The videos featured news\nanchors who appeared to be AI-generated, including one that looked like Santa\nClaus. They drew on content from a 300-page Chinese-language dossier posted\nonline the previous month, called \u201cThe Secret History of Tsai Ing-wen,\u201d which\nmade false claims about Tsai. On January 11, Taipei Times quoted an anonymous\nTaiwanese national security official who said the video\u2019s claims were false\nand bore the hallmarks of a Beijing-backed campaign. Microsoft Threat\nIntelligence later attributed the videos to Storm-1376, a known Beijing-linked\nactor sometimes referred to as Spamouflage, and determined they were made\nusing Chinese tech giant ByteDance\u2019s AI video-editing software CapCut. YouTube\nand other platforms later removed the videos.\n\n##### Related\n\n    * Same targets, new playbooks: East Asia threat actors employ unique methods (microsoft.com)\n    * China is posting fake videos of president: sources (taipeitimes.com)\n\n  * Pakistan\n\n### A chatbot for electoral symbols\n\nElection | 8 Feb 2024\n\nPakistanChatbotFacebook\n\nJust over three weeks before Pakistan\u2019s general elections, the Supreme Court\nruled that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, founded by former Prime\nMinister Imran Khan, could not use its traditional cricket bat symbol. Such\nsymbols appear on ballot papers and are important in helping voters understand\nwhich candidate is linked to which party. As a result of the ruling, PTI-\nbacked candidates all needed to create new, individual symbols, causing\nconfusion among voters. Initially, PTI supporters and workers crowdsourced\nlists of these symbols, but given that there were 808 candidates backed by\nPTI, these efforts were scattered. Within 10 days, however, the PTI set up an\nAI chatbot, powered by Facebook\u2019s automated responses feature, which allowed\npeople to message Imran Khan on Facebook with their constituency number and\ninstantly get details of their party-backed \u201cindependent\u201d candidate alongside\ntheir election symbol. This quickly became popular among the party\u2019s\nsupporters.\n\n  * Indonesia\n\n### Party chair scolds Indonesian presidential candidate in faked audio\n\nElection | 14 Feb 2024\n\nIndonesiaAudioTikTok\n\nIn January, a political commentary account on TikTok (@ricards999) posted an\naudio clip of a seemingly manipulated conversation between Indonesian\npresidential candidate Ganjar Pranowo and the leader of his party, PDl-P\nchairwoman Megawati Sukarnoputri. In the faked audio clip, Megawati can be\nheard scolding Ganjar for his poor performance in several polls. The fact-\nchecking group Mafindo labeled the audio as fake and most likely generated\nusing ElevenLabs\u2019 publicly available synthesis tools. ElevenLabs\u2019 own\ndetector, which checks for artifacts left by the company\u2019s tools, said there\nwas a 91% certainty the recording was made in this way.\n\n##### Related\n\n    * Debunked: Recording of Ganjar and Megawati's conversation (cekhoax.id)\n\n### No results found\n\nTry another set of filters to see more posts\n\nEnjoyed this story?
