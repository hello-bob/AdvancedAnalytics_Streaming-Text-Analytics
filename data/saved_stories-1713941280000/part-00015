Our talk selection\nwork has now concluded, with the possible exception of accepting proposals\nfrom the Reserve list.\n\nSo what\u2019s next? First I want to thank all of you Postgres people who submitted\nsuch amazing talk proposals into the CFP for POSETTE, now in its 3rd year. I\nwas so impressed by the submissions and wish we could have accepted more of\nthem.\n\nAnd I also want to thank Alicja Kucharczyk, Daniel Gustafsson, and Melanie\nPlageman from POSETTE\u2019s Talk Selection Team for contributing their time and\nexpertise to collaborate with me to select the talks for this year\u2019s virtual\nPOSETTE event. It\u2019s not easy to carefully read through and review 184 talk\nproposals\u2014in just 8 days\u2014to come up with the program for an event like\n#PosetteConf.\n\nThat\u2019s right, 184 talk proposals\u2014from 120 unique speakers. (The CFP had a\nmaximum of 4 submissions per speaker.) With just 38 talks to accept this year,\nthat means POSETTE 2024 has a ~20% talk acceptance rate. Bottom line, we had\nsome difficult decisions to make.\n\n## So many great talk proposals we had to lengthen the POSETTE schedule to\nmake space\n\nThe original POSETTE plan for 2024 was to have 4 livestreams with 9 talks\neach. The math looked like this:\n\n  * Each livestream would have:\n\n    * 1 invited keynote\u2014not selected through the CFP talk selection process, but rather an invited keynote speaker\n    * 8 unique talks selected via the CFP process\n  * Hence, 36 talks total:\n\n    * 32 talks selected via the CFP process + 4 unique keynotes\n\nHowever, the best laid plans of mice and men and all that, we had to throw\nthat math out the window. There were too many good talk proposals.\n\nLuckily the talk production team led by Teresa Giacomini was able to rejigger\ntheir recording schedules to make room for 6 more talks.\n\nSo the final POSETTE 2024 schedule will have:\n\n  * 42 talks total: 38 talks selected via the CFP process + 4 unique keynotes\n\nAnd yes, we\u2019ve already started discussions to figure out how we could support\nmore talks in the schedule next year, for POSETTE 2025.\n\n## Here is POSETTE\u2019s \u201cCFP hockey stick\u201d as evidence that many are deadline\ndriven\n\nBelow is a chart of the CFP submissions by Day, so those of you who are\ndeadline driven (I\u2019m guilty as charged too) will see you\u2019re not alone. In\nfact, more than 50% of the talk proposals were submitted in the last week of\nthe CFP.\n\nSide-note: When a talk proposal was submitted had zero bearing on the talk\nselection process. We didn\u2019t start reviewing and voting until after the CFP\nwas closed and all proposals were in the system.\n\nFigure 1: This chart shows the number of talk proposals submitted (by day)\ninto the CFP for POSETTE: An Event for Postgres 2024, with a big hockey stick\nof talk proposals submitted in the last 2 days. The 184 talk proposals were\nsubmitted by 120 unique speakers.\n\n## Transparency into talk selection for Postgres conferences\n\nTransparency into the process used for talk selection can be helpful for\nPostgres conference speakers which is why I\u2019m writing this post. And in\nparticular, it helps to remind yourself that many of the Postgres conference\nCFPs are competitive. So if your talk proposal was one of the submissions that\nwas declined (or placed on the reserve list) for this year\u2019s POSETTE, please\nremember:\n\n  * even the best speakers get rejected sometimes\n  * even great talk proposals get rejected sometimes\n  * don\u2019t give up: please continue to submit your talk proposals\u2014and if you want to be accepted in the future, do the work to get feedback, and make sure the submissions are on point for whatever each event is looking for\n\nSpeaking of which, there are probably some Postgres CFPs that are open right\nnow! One big one that comes to mind is PGConf NYC 2024, happening in midtown\nManhattan from Sep 30^th to Oct 2^nd 2024. The PGConf NYC 2024 CFP will be\nopen until Jun 5^th 2024.\n\n## About the 2-phase POSETTE talk selection process\n\nOur talk selection team used a 2-phase process for doing talk selection.\n\n### During Phase 1\n\n  1. I sent the talk selection team guidance for talk selection, which was basically just a refresher about the CFP: what the goal of the event is, what types of talks and speakers we were looking for, reminders that new speakers are welcome, clarifying that it\u2019s OK to accept a talk from a speaker who had spoken at a previous Citus Con... since after all, a good speaker is a good speaker.\n\n  2. We each (separately, individually) reviewed all 184 talk proposals, along with any other information and links the Speakers provided about the proposal in the Additional Notes sections and the Speaker Experience section.\n\n  3. We used the \u201cComparison evaluation method\u201d in Sessionize to rank 3 sessions at a time. This technique is based on the Elo rating system used in the world of chess. What\u2019s good about it is that at any given point, you\u2019re only looking at 3 proposals. You don\u2019t have to remember how you voted on similar talk proposals 5 hours beforehand. Rather, at any point, you\u2019re just ranking 3 talk proposals against each other.\n\n  4. After completing our Comparison Evaluation, we had a rough draft Phase 1 ranking to start applying holistic considerations to.\n\n### What\u2019s a holistic consideration?\n\nHolistic considerations are when we look at the \u201cwhole\u201d of the schedule, and\nthe desire to have a balanced and diverse set of topics, teaching styles, and\nspeakers.\n\nFor example, we knew we wanted speakers from around the globe and didn\u2019t want\nto accidentally end up with speakers from just one corner of the world.\n\nAnd we knew we didn\u2019t want 50% of the talks to be about AI in Postgres. But\nclearly AI is a hot topic, which is why there will be a handful of super-\ninteresting talks about the role of AI in the Postgres ecosystem.\n\nAnd we knew we wanted at least a few Postgres talks that were Django-focused\nor Rails-focused.\n\nWe also knew there is an expectation that Postgres experts who work at\nMicrosoft will share their expertise at this event, particularly as it relates\nto the Azure managed services for PostgreSQL.\n\nHowever, we also wanted to make space for Postgres users and open source\ncommunity members outside of Microsoft too. After all, Postgres is a global\ncommunity that spans countries, companies, and timezones! The final schedule\nis not yet published, but I predict that over 65% (or even 70%) of the\nsessions will have speakers from outside of Microsoft.\n\n### During Phase 2 of POSETTE talk selection\n\n  1. First I needed to know how many slots we had to fill, so I reached out to the POSETTE organizing team to find out whether we could accept more than the original plan for 32 talks! So glad they said yes and we were able to accept 38 talks.\n\n  2. I categorized the talk proposals in a spreadsheet so we could filter and view all of the Phase 1 rankings in a few different ways, to look at the holistic considerations. Then I made a few adjustments to balance the set of accepted talks\u2014and delivered the Talk Selection Team a proposed draft of Phase 2 rankings, with all 184 of the talk proposals in the various states of Accept / Reserve / Decline DUP^1 / Decline.\n\n  3. Phase 2 voting involved a long ~3.5 hour meeting to decide on specific changes we each wanted to make to the final roster of accepted talks/speakers. To make a change to the Phase 2 rankings, we had to make a case for the change. As a team, we would discuss the proposed change, ask questions, advocate, and then vote. I abstained from voting during this part unless I was needed as a tie-breaker (but I did not abstain from discussion.) We did this over and over, about 12 times, until landing on the final schedule.\n\n## Thanks for all your CFP submissions!\n\nThank you again to everyone who submitted proposals into the CFP for POSETTE.\n\nAnd big welcome to those of you whose talks are accepted to POSETTE. And to\nthose of you whose talk proposals are on the Reserve list, we\u2019ll reach out to\nyou right away if a spot opens up in POSETTE for your proposal.\n\n## When will the POSETTE Schedule be announced?\n\nAs for the schedule, it gets announced on May 1^st 2024. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll be\nable to see all the talks in each of the 4 livestreams for this year\u2019s\nPOSETTE: An Event for Postgres, happening virtually on Jun 11-13.\n\nWe hope you will be as excited about these speakers and these Postgres talks\nas we are.\n\nIn the meantime if you want to proactively mark your calendar for the\nlivestreams which are most convenient for your schedule, here you go:\n\n  * Add Livestream 1 to your calendar: Tue Jun 11, 2024 | 8:00am-1:30pm PDT (UTC-7)\n  * Add Livestream 2 to your calendar: Wed Jun 12, 2024 | 8:00am-1:30pm CEST (UTC+2)\n  * Add Livestream 3 to your calendar: Wed Jun 12, 2024 | 8:00am-1:30pm PDT (UTC-7)\n  * Add Livestream 4 to your calendar: Thu Jun 13, 2024 | 8:00am-1:30pm CEST (UTC+2)\n\nYou can also subscribe to POSETTE news if you want email notifications as\nthings happen, such as when the schedule is announced or when the videos are\npublished, or when next year\u2019s event is announced and the CFP opens for 2025.\n\nAnd of course you can always follow @PosetteConf on Threads or on X/Twitter,\nor on Mastodon by following @posetteconf@mastodon.social. The event hashtag is\n#PosetteConf.\n\n### Shout-out to transparency from other Postgres program committees\n\nSeveral other PostgreSQL events this year have also shared info about their\nCFP submissions and talk selection processes. A few recent examples:\n\n  * PGConf.dev 2024: I loved this blog post by Paul Ramsey about Building the PGConf.dev Programme about how the PGConf.dev talk selection was done, to pick 33 talks out of over 180 submissions.\n\n  * pgDay Paris 2024 Program committee feedback: This PDF from the pgDay Paris 2024 program committee also sheds light into the talk selection process used to pick 12 talks out of 116 CFP submissions. A daunting task I\u2019m sure.\n\n  * PGConf.EU 2023: During the \u201cSo long and thanks for all the fish\u201d session at the very end of PGConf.EU 2023 in Prague, Dave Page and Magnus Hagander put a slide up on the big screen that showed the number of CFP submissions by day over the course of the CFP, from CFP open to CFP close\u2014not just for the 2023 event, but for every PGConf.EU since 2009^2. As you might imagine, the number of talk proposals has grown over the years commensurate with the size of PGConf.EU: The 2023 conference had over 360 submissions. With just 51 talks accepted, that's a ~14% acceptance rate for PGConf.EU 2023.\n\nFootnotes\n\n  1. Decline DUP is a state for a session proposed by a speaker who has another talk accepted already. As soon as that speaker\u2019s talk is accepted, all the rest of their talk proposals move into the \u201cDecline DUP\u201d state, since we try not to accept more than 1 talk from any given speaker. \u21a9\n\n  2. I have a photo of the PGConfEU slide about the CFP that Dave & Magnus put on screen, but don\u2019t want to publish it without permission of the PGConf.EU team, since it\u2019s their decision to publish it for the whole world and not just the ~500+ people who were in the room! \u21a9\n\n  * Citus Con\n  * community\n  * conference talks\n  * open source\n  * PosetteConf\n  * Postgres\n\n### Enjoy what you\u2019re reading?\n\nIf you want to read more posts from our Citus database and Postgres teams,\nsign up for our monthly newsletter and get the latest content delivered\nstraight to your inbox.\n\n###### SHARE THIS POST\n\nShare on X Share on LinkedIn Copy link\n\nWritten by Claire Giordano\n\nHead of open source community efforts for Postgres at Microsoft.
