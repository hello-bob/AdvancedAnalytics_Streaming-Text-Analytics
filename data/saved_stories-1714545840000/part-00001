The recently proposed 3DGS\nhas demonstrated exceptional rendering quality and speed, but it typically\nrequires a large amount of Gaussian primitives to model complex 3D scenes in\nhigh fidelity. When users need to holistically view such scenes, the 3DGS\nmodel falls short in rendering excessive Gaussians in real time. To solve this\nissue, we propose a novel representation named Level of Gaussians (LoG) for\nefficiently rendering 3D scenes, inspired by the classical idea of levels of\ndetail (LOD) in rendering: fine details are essential for close views but\nbecome redundant for distant views. We implement LoG as a tree structure\nstoring Gaussians and devise a progressive training strategy to reconstruct it\nfrom images in an end-to-end manner, which also provides effective\nregularization and helps overcome the local minima. In the rendering phase,\nthe optimal level of Gaussians is adaptively selected based on the viewer's\ndistance and angle. Experiments show that our approach enables real-time and\nhigh-quality rendering of areas spanning millions of square meters,\nrepresenting a significant advancement in rendering large-scale scenes.\n\n### Method\n\n(a) Our method models a 3D scene with levels of Gaussian primitives and stores\nthem in a tree structure. For instance, the large green primitive within the\nblue frame at Level 0 is further represented by four smaller primitives within\nthe blue frame at Level 1. (b) Each node in this tree can be represented in\ngreater detail by its several child nodes, thereby offering varying degrees of\ndetail in representing the scene. (c) During rendering, we traverse this tree\nto select the appropriate primitives that precisely represent the scene under\nthe viewpoint. Specifically, we expand the tree until either the nodes have no\nchild nodes or the diameter of each node is less than 1 pixel in image space.\nThis strategy avoids the need to use thousands of primitives to render a\ndistant building, which typically occupies only a few pixels in an image,\nthereby significantly accelerating the rendering process.\n\n### Citation\n\n    \n    \n    @inproceedings{LoG, title={Real-Time View Synthesis for Large Scenes with Millions of Square Meters}, author={Shuai, Qing and Guo, Haoyu and Xu, Zhen and Lin, Haotong and Peng, Sida and Bao, Hujun and Zhou, Xiaowei}, year={2024} }\n\nThanks to Lior Yariv for the website template.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
