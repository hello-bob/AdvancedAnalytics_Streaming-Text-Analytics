But, growth brings its own set of challenges, especially when it\ncomes to managing the influx of contributions, maintaining project health, and\ncommunicating with core members of your team. Finding the right approach to\nmanage this growth can be as important as the development of the project.\n\n## The Complexity of Open Source Growth\n\n> \u201cThe problem facing maintainers today is not how to get more contributors by\n> how to manage a high volume of frequent, low-touch interactions. These\n> developers aren\u2019t building communities; they\u2019re directing air traffic.\u201d\n> Nadia Eghbal from Working in Public: the making and maintenance of open\n> source software, p. 13\n\nOpen source teams are often working not in one repository, but in multiple or\nsometimes even organizations with different issues, contributors, and teams.\nKeeping track of GitHub notifications is hard enough on its own, but add to\nthat building relationships with contributors, reviewing pull requests,\nupdating documentation, and more, sometimes you lose sight of the ultimate\ngoals of the project and forget to think about health and sustainability. On\ntop of that, if you\u2019re working on projects either in tandem or as part of your\njob, there\u2019s often an element of needing to justify what you\u2019re working on.\nThe challenge of balancing code-centric and community-centric needs can be\noverwhelming.\n\nSo how do you cut through the noise and make sure that you have a good sense\nof direction and the value that your project is creating?\n\n## Understanding Your Open Source Project with Workspaces\n\nUnderstanding the direction and value of your project can be challenging. To\nnavigate these challenges effectively, it\u2019s helpful to:\n\n  * Understand your project at a high level\n  * Collaborate and create transparency with your team\n  * Streamline contributor engagement\n  * Measure and share success\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how we do this at OpenSauced with our new Workspaces\nfeature.\n\n### High Level Overview of your Open Source Project\n\nBeing able to look at all your repositories and understand them at a high\nlevel, makes it easier for you to share this information, collaborate with\nothers, and understand where your projects stand in terms of health. This is\nour team page for our most frequented repositories:\n\nWhen we look at our OpenSauced repositories together, we all have a clear\nunderstanding of where our projects are succeeding and where they\u2019re\nstagnating. In the image above, you can see that over the last 30 days, we\u2019ve\nhad a high activity level, with close to 20 contributors in the app repo,\nwhich is reflective of the new feature we\u2019ve launched called Workspaces.\n\nOn the other hand, we can see that three of our repositories have had low\nactivity levels, with the AI repo actually showing that there\u2019s no activity.\nThis repository was primarily contributed to and maintained by our interns\nlast summer, and hasn\u2019t been prioritized among all the other work we\u2019ve done.\n\n### Collaborating with Your Open Source Team\n\nUnderstanding the activity for all of our projects has allowed us to make\ndecisions as a team, set goals for our projects, and understand what brings\nthe most value to those using our product.\n\nWith our OpenSauced Workspace, all of the team has been added with the ability\nto add, edit, and delete the repositories we\u2019re tracking. This gives the whole\nteam a sense of what\u2019s going on. For example, if John creates a new repository\nfor something he\u2019s working on, he can add it to this Workspace so we all can\nsee the activity of his project. More ways we can gauge how we\u2019re doing as a\nteam include:\n\n  * Velocity of PRs and Issues. We have a high rate of merged pull requests in the last month, and have been closing more issues than have been opened.\n  * Star-to-fork ratio. We know that people are contributing and starring the project at a healthy rate, indicating a growing contributor community.\n\nYour workspace doesn\u2019t have to be the repositories in your organization,\nthough. Sometimes it\u2019s important to track other open source projects you\ndepend on, projects that are similar to yours, or projects that your\ncontributors are also involved in. Think of your workspace as a point of\ncommunication for your team. Providing them with the information they need to\nknow, equips everyone for success.\n\n### Streamline Contributor Engagement\n\nHaving a high level understanding of your project is a good step in\nunderstanding your project\u2019s value, but really understanding what\u2019s happening\nbeneath the surface is the next step in being able to assess project health,\ngrowth, and the contributor community.\n\nBut what does that mean? I can\u2019t look at my GitHub repository and know if it\u2019s\na healthy project. I can see there are contributors, but I don\u2019t know what\ntypes of contributions they\u2019re making, if they\u2019re repeat or one-time. It\nstarts to become a really complex process that takes more time away from doing\nwhat you usually want to do as a maintainer or contributor: create PRs and\nwork on the codebase of the project.\n\nIn Episode One of The Business of Open-Source: A Conversation with Heather\nMeeker, Heather Meeker says, \u201cIf you look at how many contributors there are\nto a project, how many downloads there are of the project, how engaged the\ncommunity is. You have amazing intelligence about product market fit.\u201d\n\nAs the number of contributors grows, it\u2019s important to differentiate between\nhigh-impact contributions and those that require less immediate attention.\nOrganizing your repositories, and understanding how contributors are\ncontributing, allows for better management of tasks and more efficient triage\nprocesses.\n\nGitHub tells you the number of contributors you\u2019ve had as a total, but that\u2019s\nnot a good way to evaluate the health of your project. Understanding your\ncontributors over the recent history of the project is more valuable. For\nexample, it might show that you\u2019ve had 3,000 contributors, but if you haven\u2019t\nhad any in the last 30 days, then there\u2019s probably a major issue with the\nhealth and sustainability of the project.\n\nA better indication would be seeing sustained and consistent contributions\nover the last thirty days. Your graph will likely depend on the size of the\nproject. For example, this is our Repository Insight into our contributors\nactivity, which reflects a Medium Activity Level for our repositories.\n\nThis is Godot\u2019s Repository Insight into their contributors activity where they\nhave high level of activity:\n\nPart of dealing with the pain points that comes from growing your project is\nelevating key contributors to teams to help sort through the challenges of\nmaintaining an open source project. But it can be hard to keep tabs on who\nyour volunteers are, whether they\u2019re still active, and finding time to\nadequately recognize their efforts and impact on the project.\n\nBeing able to categorize the types of contributors you have and see them at a\nglance, allows you to make informed decisions about the future of the project.\nIf you find that the members of your triage team aren\u2019t active anymore and\nthat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been feeling extra pressure, then it\u2019s time to recruit new\ntriage members or reach out to the inactive members.\n\nOr if you see that one of your teammates has been doing exceptionally\nproductive work lately, you\u2019re better able to acknowledge and recognize that\nteammate's contributions.\n\nNot everyone on your team will need to know all the information about\ncontributors, but giving them access creates opportunities for communication,\ntransparency, and collaboration.\n\n### Measure and share success\n\nThere are many different reasons you might need to measure the success of your\nproject. Without insight into your project's activity level, health, and\ncontributor community, it can be a challenge to show the value of your\nprojects. At OpenSauced, we find it helpful to have real-time analytics on our\nprojects so we can highlight our key achievements, recognize the impact of our\ncontributors, and communicate the hard work that\u2019s been put into our projects.\nIt\u2019s also helpful to see how your contributors are talking about your project.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe path of open source projects has unique challenges, especially as projects\nscale. Effectively managing the growth of an open source project goes beyond\ncode contribution; it involves a holistic approach to community building,\nproject health monitoring, and clear communication. Adopting strategies for\ncomprehensive understanding and collaboration is key to sustaining project\ngrowth and ensuring success. The ultimate goal is to create a thriving\nenvironment where both the project and its community can flourish.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Workspaces, check out our YouTube walkthrough:\n\nRecent Posts\n\n#github\n\n#opensource\n\nGrowth Hacking Killed GitHub Stars\n\nbdougie\n\n5 mins read\n\nGitHub Star inflation raises concerns in open-source projects.
