Here\u2019s what it reveals about you.\n\nWhile experts disagree on how common self-talk really is, they wholeheartedly\nagree that it\u2019s a valuable tool for self-discovery.\n\nDo you talk to yourself? Psychologists say it might be more of a mirror into\nyour interior life than it seems by revealing repressed emotions. Inner\nmonologues, as they're called, can also be helpful tools for overcoming\ndepression and improving your social interactions.\n\nPhotograph by Manuela Louren\u00e7o\n\nByKaren Peterson\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nWhile writing this, I caught myself talking to... myself. Between clicks on\nthe keyboard, I realized I was having an internal conversation about an\nencounter I'd had the night before. Why, out of the blue, would I interrupt\nthe work I was doing to chat with myself about something that seemed so\ninconsequential?\n\nIf you ask that question of experts in self-talk\u2014colloquially, \"talking to\nourselves\" or more formally the \"inner monologue\"\u2014one clinical response might\nbe that I wasn't avoiding the task at hand. Instead, and much more\nintriguingly, I was possibly experiencing a close encounter with the real \"me\"\nthrough a deeply personal internal dialogue.\n\nRussell Hurlburt, psychologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, would\nsay that the words I used in my inner conversation might've represented a\n\u201cpristine inner experience\" which would take me, in that instant, to the\n\"footlights of [my own] consciousness.\" I was setting the stage for self-\ndiscovery, if this had been a professional appointment.\n\n(What is ASMR\u2014and why do only some people feel it?)\n\n\"I think people are totally interesting. And I think people find themselves\ntotally interesting,\" says Hurlburt, who describes himself as \"a researcher of\ninner experience.\"\n\n\"\u2018A penny for your thoughts?\u2019 is probably the most interesting question in the\nworld,\" he says.\n\nFor behavioralists, inner conversations can reveal repressed emotions, good or\nself-deprecating, that were stirred by a phone call or triggered by an event\nor encounter. Like the self-admonishing, \"Oh, I sounded so stupid!\" Or the\nself-affirming, \"I always feel valued when she and I work together.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that self-talk generates \u201cout loud\u201d talk on social media\nplatforms, where people have been having their own conversations about inner\nmonologues, wondering what exactly they are and if everyone has one.\n\nWe asked the experts about this curious natural phenomenon and why you may or\nmay not participate in this most intimate of conversations. While our experts\ndisagree on the frequency of self-talk, they wholeheartedly agree that the\ninner dialogue is a valuable tool for self-discovery.\n\n## Who talks to themselves?\n\nThere is nothing new about talking to ourselves. Hamlet did it seven times, as\nsoliloquies, in a play written four centuries ago. Talking to ourselves is\njoke-worthy, but socially taboo if we're caught talking out loud.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1970s that psychologists began to seriously embrace self-\ntalk as a field of study, inspired by the work of psychiatrist Aaron Beck, the\nfather of CBT.\n\nDecades later, in 2009, psychologist Thomas Brinthaupt published one of the\nhandful of analytical tools in use today for measuring self-talk in patients.\nCalled the Self-Talk Scale (STS), it is a 22-item questionnaire aimed at\nidentifying the frequency of self-talk and reflecting four categories of inner\nchatter: social assessment, self-criticism, self-reinforcement, and self-\nmanagement.\n\nSTS has been used by \"tens of thousands\" of people in studies worldwide, says\nBrinthaupt, now a self-described \"personality psychologist\" at Middle\nTennessee State University who works with CBT researchers on finding the\ndeeper meaning to one's mental health as revealed by their inner voice. His\nquestionnaire offers a means for gaining data and underwriting the credibility\nof research on a topic as ephemeral as thought.\n\n(9 simple ways to boost your mental health, according to science.)\n\nHe has found that in general, children talk to themselves as part of the\nlearning process. Introverts are more likely to be self-talkers. \"Only\nchildren\" (those without siblings) talk to themselves more often and into\nadulthood. Children with \"invisible\" friends also are more likely to self-\ntalk.\n\nAnd people who are suddenly alone or lonely are more apt to self-talk.\nAlthough yet to be studied, Brinthaupt surmises that people began talking to\nthemselves more\u2014and more often out loud\u2014during the isolation of the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nPeople with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) talk to themselves in ways\nthat mirror the condition\u2014over and over, repeatedly. The deaf or hard of\nhearing who use American Sign Language have been reported using their hands to\nself-talk, says Brinthaupt.\n\nIt's also been determined, but not yet studied further, that people who suffer\nbrain damage or a stroke and have difficulty speaking \"report that they have\nlost the sense of self-talk.\"\n\n## So does everyone really have an inner monologue?\n\nBut experts are divided over whether the experience is limited to people in\nthese categories\u2014or universal.\n\nBrinthaupt argues that self-talk is a ubiquitous activity available to us all.\n\"We talk to ourselves in response to specific events and stimuli in the social\nenvironment or imagined events,\" he says, adding that some people \"don't know\nthey have the ability.\"\n\nHurlburt takes the opposing view. In 2020, blogger Ryan Langdon wrote a piece\nin reply to a tweet by Hurlburt on his research. Langdon titled it \"Today I\nLearned That Not Everyone Has an Internal Monologue and It Has Ruined My Day.\"\nIt generated more than a million responses within a month, says Hurlburt, who\nlater met and interviewed Langdon.\n\n(Does AI creep you out? You're experiencing the \"uncanny valley.\")\n\n\"People believe that they talk to themselves,\" says Hurlburt, and \"some people\ndo sometimes talk to themselves. But of all the samples that I've collected\nover 50 years of sampling, maybe something like a quarter of them involve\nwords or talking.\"\n\nRather than words, some people \"see\" themselves. One of Hurlburt's most\nmemorable patients, whom he calls Fran, didn't self-talk. She used inner-\nimagery to visualize what turned out to be an emotionally devastating\ndialogue\u2014caught in time. Now recovered, she was replaying an inner moving\npicture of her own suicide, step-by-detailed-step.\n\n## The benefits\u2014and downsides\u2014of self-talk\n\nBrinthaupt's categories of inner chatter reflect primary inner concerns. For\nexample, \"social assessment\" self-talk (\"I really shouldn't have interrupted\nlike I did\") might seem self-critical but it can also help improve social\ninteractions. Public speakers often self-talk for \"self-reinforcement\" and\n\"self-management\" before hitting the mic.\n\nAn inner monologue can also be a tool: Psychologists who practice popular\ncognitive behavior therapy (CBT) use self-talk as a treatment to reverse\nnegative thinking that arises from conditions like depression. To CBT\npractitioners, depression is reinforced with self-talk that is critical and\nnegative\u2014but can be weakened when we give ourselves positive and supportive\nmessages.\n\nHurlburt is not so much interested in self-talk as a behavioral tool but as a\ndirect link to the inner self, a journey of discovery that he's been on since\n1971. Using a sampling method and a wearable beeper that he designed and\npatented, Hurlburt instructs his clients to jot down what they were thinking\nthe moment beeper goes off, hopefully to capture a pure thought.\n\nTo Hurlbert, standard surveys and questionnaires are subjective and pollute\nwhat should be an unadulterated personal response.\n\n\"If you really want to know about what's going on within you,\" he says, \"you\nhave to have a method that allows access to your inner experience without\ndisturbing it.\"\n\nBut if you don\u2019t think you have an inner monologue, Hurlbert says, there\u2019s no\nreason for concern. \"They are not part of being human,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people\ndon't process life in words and sentences.\"\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * MENTAL HEALTH\n  * PSYCHOLOGY\n  * SOCIAL MEDIA\n\n## You May Also Like\n\nSCIENCE\n\n### Women are being diagnosed with ADHD at unprecedented rates.
