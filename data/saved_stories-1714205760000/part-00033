AI also has the\npotential to disrupt information landscapes and the communities that research\nlibraries support and serve. The increasing availability of AI models sparks\nmany possibilities and raises several ethical, professional, and legal\nconsiderations.\n\nArticulating a set of research libraries guiding principles for AI is useful\nto influence policy and advocate for the responsible development and\ndeployment of AI technologies, promote ethical and transparent practices, and\nbuild trust among stakeholders, within research libraries as well as across\nthe research environment. These principles will serve as a foundational\nframework for the ethical and transparent use of AI and reflect the values we\nhold in research libraries. ARL will rely on these principles in our policy\nadvocacy and engagement.\n\nDeveloped through the ARL Scholars and Scholarship Committee and the ARL\nAdvocacy and Public Policy Committee, these principles have been created and\nrefined after multiple committee meetings, a member-wide open office-hours\nsession, and an open comment period. During the open comment period alone, we\nreceived over 60 comments that have been taken into consideration in the\ndevelopment of these principles.\n\n## Principles\n\n  1. Libraries democratize access to artificial intelligence tools and technology to foster digital literacy among all people. Libraries embrace the opportunity to educate library users and information professionals about AI, equipping them with the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in a society increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence. This principle underscores the library\u2019s commitment to inclusivity, knowledge dissemination, and the empowerment of individuals.\n  2. Libraries commit to understanding where distortions and biases are present in AI models and applications. Recognizing the inherent susceptibility of all AI to distortion, we leverage our expertise to raise user awareness regarding distortions present in AI systems and their outputs. We strive to enhance transparency and understanding, fostering a library and research environment that empowers users with the knowledge to navigate and critically assess AI-driven information and services.\n  3. Libraries champion transparency and information integrity. Libraries will advocate for openness and transparency in algorithms, training data, and methodologies used to create AI technologies that we license.\n  4. Libraries believe \u201cno human, no AI.\u201d This principle underscores the importance of human involvement in critical decision-making junctures, enhancing accountability, ethical considerations, and the overall reliability of AI-driven processes within the research environment.\n  5. Libraries prioritize the security and privacy of users in the use of AI tools, technology, and training data. Libraries will continue to advocate for laws and regulations that protect the personal information of library users and employees.\n  6. Libraries assert that copyright law in the US and Canada is flexible and robust enough to respond to many copyright issues that arise from the intersection of technology and artificial intelligence. Libraries have a stake in preserving library rights for nonprofit research and education uses. More on copyright law in the US and Canada may be found in the \u201cLibrary Copyright Alliance Principles for Copyright and Artificial Intelligence\u201d and \u201cCARL\u2019s Response to the Consultation on Copyright in the Age of Generative AI.\u201d\n  7. Libraries negotiate to preserve the scholarly use of digital information. As champions of fair use and fair dealing, intellectual freedom, and freedom of information, libraries assert that licenses should not restrict the scholarly use of digital information.\n\n## Resources\n\n  * \u201cICOLC Statement on AI in Licensing,\u201d International Coalition of Library Consortia (ICOLC), March 22, 2024.\n  * Transparency is actively pursued through the application of insights from Explainable AI (XAI), embodying the core premise of the \u201cright to an explanation.\u201d See \u201cExplainable Artificial Intelligence,\u201d Michael Ridley, Research Library Issues, no. 299 (2019): 28\u201346.\n  * \u201cLibrary Copyright Alliance Principles for Copyright and Artificial Intelligence,\u201d Library Copyright Alliance, July 10, 2023.\n  * \u201cCARL Response to the Consultation on Copyright in the Age of Generative AI,\u201d Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL), December 15, 2023.\n\nDownload a PDF of the \u201cResearch Libraries Guiding Principles for Artificial\nIntelligence.\u201d\n\n## About the Association of Research Libraries\n\nThe Association of Research Libraries (ARL) is a nonprofit organization of\nresearch libraries in Canada and the US whose vision is to create a trusted,\nequitable, and inclusive research and learning ecosystem and prepare library\nleaders to advance this work in strategic partnership with member libraries\nand other organizations worldwide. ARL\u2019s mission is to empower and advocate\nfor research libraries and archives to shape, influence, and implement\ninstitutional, national, and international policy. ARL develops the next\ngeneration of leaders and enables strategic cooperation among partner\ninstitutions to benefit scholarship and society. ARL is on the web at ARL.org.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), Principles, Technology\n\n### Inside News\n\n  * ARL News\n  * Community Updates\n  * Day in Review\n  * Press Coverage\n  * Public Policy Briefing\n  * Statements\n\n#### Affiliates\n\n#### Association of Research Libraries\n\n21 Dupont Circle NW #800 Washington, DC 20036 202 296 2296 | webmgr@arl.org\n\n\u00a9 Association of Research Libraries\n\n", "frontpage": false}
