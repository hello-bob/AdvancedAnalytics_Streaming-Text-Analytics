As Graphing\nCalculator was developed free for Apple, and was the killer app that\ndemonstrated how much faster PowerPCs were than Motorola 68K processors, you\nmight wonder why we now have Grapher instead.\n\nGraphing Calculator was originally developed by Ron Avitzur and Greg Robbins,\nwho were at the time former contractors whose work for Apple had been\nterminated when their project was cancelled. Despite being unpaid and living\nfrugally, the pair developed their app largely in secret, at the time when\nApple was getting the first prototype PowerPC Macs working. It turned out to\nbe the first stunning demonstration of Apple\u2019s new hardware, and was released\nas part of System 7.5 on 12 September 1994. Ron Avitzur has given a riveting\naccount of their work in a talk, and on his website.\n\nYou can download the latest version of this 30 year-old app free from the App\nStore. This now uses SwiftUI, requires Sonoma, and runs native on both Intel\nand Apple silicon Macs.\n\nWhen Apple released Mac OS X, it shipped without Graphing Calculator,\npresumably because of that app\u2019s origins on the Mac rather than in NeXTSTEP.\nInstead of adopting Graphing Calculator, in 2004 Apple bought Curvus Pro X\nfrom Arizona Software and turned that into Grapher, which was released as part\nof Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger in 2005, under the name Grapher, which continues as a\nbundled app in Sonoma 19 years later.\n\nPurists who used Graphing Calculator insist that Grapher isn\u2019t a patch on the\noriginal. You only have to watch Graphing Calculator\u2019s Full Demo for a few\nminutes, download Today\u2019s Equations, or browse its User\u2019s Gallery to see the\ndifferences. While Grapher is thoroughly competent, it\u2019s lacklustre beside the\noriginal Graphing Calculator. Whatever made Apple turn its back on all that,\nand buy in an app that pales by comparison?\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Pinterest\n  * Email\n  * Print\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nSolutions to Saturday Mac riddles 240January 29, 2024In \"General\"\n\nThe simple lifeJuly 27, 2015In \"Macs\"\n\nWhat has been updated in Sierra 10.12.6?July 21, 2017In \"Macs\"\n\nPosted in Macs, Technology and tagged Apple, Classic Mac, Grapher, Graphing\nCalculator, Mac OS X, PowerPC.

By now I\ncompare you to a very careful and intelligent Physician who identifies and\ndiagnoses rare but important Syndromes, unfortunately without being listened\nto by the Patient. Who? But \u201cThe Apple Patient,\u201d of course!...\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\n  2. 2\n\nOliver Busch on May 4, 2024 at 9:42 am\n\nReply\n\n(x2+y2-1)3-x2y3=0\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
