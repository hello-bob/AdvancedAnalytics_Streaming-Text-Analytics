A circular economy seems to be the\nideal solution for the valorization of mineral waste, resulting from various\nindustrial branches, by reintroducing them in the process of obtaining\nalternative building materials, more friendly to the environment. Geopolymers\ncan be considered as a promising option compared to Portland cement.\nInformation about the influence of the composition of the precursors, the\ninfluence of the activation system on the mechanical properties or the setting\ntime could lead to the anticipation of new formulations of geopolymers or to\nthe improvement of some of their properties. Reinforcement components,\ndifferent polymers and expansion agents can positively or negatively influence\nthe properties of geopolymers in the short or long term.\n\nKeywords:\n\nfly ash; geopolymer composites; cement; fibers; circular economy; SEM\nmorphology\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nThe exhaustion of natural resources, the degradation of the environment, the\nlarge emissions of CO_2 into the atmosphere, and the rising deterioration of\nthe environment have fueled the need for urgent solutions to reduce the\nnegative effects of pollution in order to slow global warming [1]. In this\nview, the concept of circular economy appeared [2,3], which can provide an\noption for reusing large amounts of waste, encouraging their reuse in the\nmanufacturing circuit, through innovative methods, to obtain new building\nmaterials. Coal represents an important resource for obtaining electricity.\nHowever, the coal-burning process produces significant amounts of waste, such\nas slag and fly ash [2,3]. Improper storage of these wastes can lead to air,\nsoil, or water contamination, leading to a negative impact on the environment.\nIn addition to this waste, there are other examples like glass [4] and bauxite\nwaste [5]. Figure 1 shows the main stages of the circular economy.\n\nFigure 1. The stages of the circular economy.\n\nThe geopolymers introduced by Davidovits [6] are materials based on\naluminosilicate precursors with low calcium content and alkaline activation.\nDavidovits [6] relies on the fact that after the geopolymerization process, a\nzeolitic material will be obtained, with properties such as hardness,\nlongevity, and thermal stability similar to those of natural rocks. These\nmaterials showed good resistance to chemical corrosion, superior mechanical\nproperties, and good durability [7]. On the other hand, the above-described\nmaterials are more correctly called alkali-activated materials because they\nare a combination of cement hydrates and geopolymeric components. The\nconversion of aluminosilicate precursors can be improved by increasing their\nreactivity to geopolymerization depending on the type and ratio of the\nalkaline activators used [8,9].\n\nZhuang et al. [10] admitted that an important factor that can influence the\ngeopolymer\u2019s properties is the active substance Si/Al molar ratio. The\nalkaline solution could be another important factor that could influence the\nproperties of the geopolymer. The surface charge density (inversely\nproportional to the radius of the cation) influences the degree of\npolymerization of the geopolymer; the lower the charge density, the higher the\ndegree of polymerization. A higher temperature [10] also strengthens the\ngeopolymer because the dissolution of the ash takes place at a lower\ntemperature, and increases the setting time of the geopolymer.\n\nRecent research in the field of geopolymers aims to improve mechanical\nproperties, especially crack resistance, by introducing reinforcement\ncomponents such as fibers. Vegetable fibers are cheap, are found in abundance,\nshow low density, have high specific resistance and no toxicity, and are can\nbe used successfully in building materials [3].\n\nAll countries face major problems in the management of large amounts of\nmineral waste (fly ash, metakaolin, etc.). This could be solved by\nreintroducing them into a circuit to obtain alternative building materials.\nData on the properties of geopolymers in the literature vary based on the\norigin of the precursors and the methods/parameters used to obtain them. The\nliterature data generally only refer to geopolymers based on one or two wastes\nthat sometimes lead to the improvement of some properties of the material.\nHowever, it is necessary to find new solutions to increase the longevity of\nthe material, by adding some reinforcement components or some additives.\n\nThis review provides information about the influences of some compounds\n(precursors, alkaline activator components, reinforcement components) and\ntheir concentrations on the material properties, in order to explain the\ngeopolymerization process.\n\n## 2\\. Geopolymers and Their Most Common Precursors\n\nGeopolymers are based on aluminosilicate sources with high reactivity and\nalkaline activators. The alkaline activator is usually a combination of\nsilicate and sodium hydroxide mixed in a wet state [1]. Liquid hardeners are\nusually added to obtain a geopolymeric gel that helps strengthen the\ngeopolymer. Fly ash [11,12,13], furnace slag [14] (richer in Si), metakaolin\n[15] (richer in Al) [16], and glass waste are examples of the precursors that\nform the basis of geopolymers. Geopolymers are like zeolites, but, unlike\nzeolites, which show a crystalline structure, they have an amorphous\nstructure. If the crystalline network of zeolites is formed at more than 100\n\u00b0C and at a pressure of approximately 200 kPa, the crystallinity stage is not\nreached for the geopolymers at these parameters [17]. The choice of precursors\nis made according to their availability, type of application, and cost.\nAmorphous precursors are desired, with a reactive glassy content and a a low\nwater requirement, which can easily release aluminum [18]. It was found that\nthe smaller the particles of the precursors, the faster the reaction takes\nplace and the time required for heating is considerably reduced. Also, the\nmaterial\u2019s workability and compression resistance are improved. Water sorption\ncan be considerably controlled by particle size distribution, and the\nformation of the aluminosilicate gel is influenced by the amorphous filling of\nAl_2O_3 and SiO_2, which can lead to the development of a denser network,\nresistant to chloride attack. A study on the influence of the particle size of\nclass F fly ash on the compressive strength reports that the highest values\nwere obtained for the samples with the smallest particles and with the highest\nactivator/fly ash ratio [19].\n\n#### 2.1. Fly Ash\n\nAccording to ASTM C 618 [20], fly ash is classified into type C (rich in Ca)\nand type F (low in Ca). Class F ash results from the burning of bituminous\ncoal and anthracite, with less than 10 wt.% Ca, quartz, aluminosilicate glass\nmagnetite, and mullite, which provide a pozzolanic nature and very weak\ncementing properties, indicated for concrete. Class C of fly ash results from\nthe burning of sub-bituminous coals and lignite, with a higher content of Ca\n(up to 15 wt.%), reactive alumina and silica, showing a capacity for self-\ncementation in addition to the pozzolanic properties. Type C ash has hydraulic\nproperties and swells in the presence of water. F-type ash is recommended in\nthe synthesis of geopolymers. Therefore, the fly ash is chosen according to\nthe suitability of the obtained material [21].\n\nCoal from power plants burns very quickly, and the residue is rich in silica,\naluminum, and iron. After melting and rapid cooling, the material solidifies\nin a spherical form, which is called fly ash (Figure 1). Some researchers\n[12,13] showed that the fly ash powder (Figure 2a) has some spherical shaped\nparticles (Figure 3a,b). Some of these particles can be black (Figure 3a\nyellow arrow or white in Figure 3a red arrow) and were found to be mullite\n(3Al_2O_3\u00b7SiO_2) and hematite (Fe_2O_3) [12,13], and the vitreous phase was\nfound together with the crystalline phase [12,13]. Fly ash is used as a\nprecursor or as a binder, especially to obtain geopolymeric cement [12,13].\n\nFigure 2. The photographs of: (a) class-F fly ash powder, (b) kaolinite and\n(c) metakaolin.\n\nFigure 3. Fly ash powder (a) optical microscopy; (b) SEM of fly ash powder\n[12,13].\n\nThe chemical composition of fly ash differs depending on the method of\nproduction or combustion temperatures (800\u20131800 \u00b0C) [11]. Studies show that to\nensure the appropriate alkalinity, the Si/Al ratio must be between 2 and 3.5,\nthe percentage of Fe_2O_3 must be below 10 wt.%, and active Si should be above\n40 wt.%. The particle size below 45 \u03bcm could also lead to obtaining a\ngeopolymer with improved properties. The concentration of Ca must not be\nhigher than 5 wt.% because it can affect the reactivity of Si and Al [6,11].\nFor geopolymeric binders, studies regarding fly ash [22], an activation\nprocess with alkalis that leads to depolymerization of the precursors,\nfollowed by the repolymerization of disintegrated monomers that form\naluminosilicate networks with the role of improving the properties of\ngeopolymeric composites, is needed. These activators can be obtained from both\nchemical reagents and high-pH waste [23]. For other types of fly ash, sulfate\nmay be a better activator [24]. Fern\u00e1ndez-Jim\u00e9nez and Palomo [25] think that\nsilicon has the most important role in the production of the initial gel based\non zeolitic nuclei, leading to a dissolution that releases the first monomers,\nresulting in a gel rich in silica. Gel formation is faster when the silicate\ncontains more dimers.\n\nThe more aluminum in the aluminosilicate source (at least 20 wt.%), the higher\nthe reactivity [21]. If there is less aluminum, once it is released, it is\nquickly consumed, and the source is no longer reactive. The silicon-rich gel\nbecomes more stable with the penetration of dissolved Al into its structure.\nSodium can stabilize the gel by balancing the aluminum monomers or be used for\nmixtures with low Si/Al ratios. Sodium plays the role of a load balancer, able\nto enter the pores of the mixtures and bind to oxygen and water molecules\n[21,25].\n\n#### 2.2. Metakaolin\n\nKaolin is a rock that contains minerals such as kaolinite, quartz impurities,\nand mica. Kaolinite is formed by a layer of silicon tetrahedra and another\nlayer of alumina octahedra linked by hydroxyl groups. After the heating\ntreatment, kaolinite (Figure 2b) transforms into metakaolin (Figure 2c), which\nhas an amorphous structure, representing a source of very reactive\naluminosilicates [21]. Metakaolin is one of the first precursors used in\ngeopolymer research. It was originally used as a filler in the paper and\nplastic industry. Recently, various types of metakaolin have been obtained for\ndifferent applications. In addition to SiO_2 and Al_2O_3, metakaolin also\ncontains a small percentage of metal oxides. In their study, Davidovits et al.\n[26] investigated several types of metakaolin from an exothermic point of\nview, recording for each type, the minimum time in which the thermal maximum\nis reached in an alkaline solution. Solouki [11] reports a mixture of\nactivated alkaline foam, with 70 wt.% tungsten waste and only 10 wt.%\nmetakaolin as precursors. With the addition of Al powder, a higher resistance\nwas reported compared to samples based on fly ash and metakaolin. In another\nstudy [27], soluble silicon reacted with part of the residues from a vanadium\nmine, while the unreacted part played the role of an aggregate.\n\n#### 2.3. Blast Furnace Slag\n\nThe blast furnace slag obtained from the iron manufacturing process has a rich\ncontent of aluminum, magnesium, and calcium silicates. Air-cooled slag is not\nsuitable to produce geopolymers. The blast furnace slag appears to be a\nprecursor for obtaining geopolymers in many studies [28,29]. The structure of\nthe slag based on aluminosilicates can be affected by the degree of\npolymerization or depolymerization of the network based on silica tetrahedron\nunits, but also by the addition of certain cations or the physical state of\nthe slag (crystalline, glassy, or liquid) [30]. Blast furnace slag has a rich\ncalcium content. This can be considered the precursor of alkaline activated\ncements due to the hydraulic modulus expressed by the CaO/(SiO_2 + Al_2O_3)\nratio greater than 1. This modulus has a direct influence on the alkaline\nactivation of the slag. However, it was found that if the CaO/SiO_2 ratio is\nover 1.50, the alkaline activation is reduced. Also, the addition of magnesium\ncan increase the alkaline activation reaction. Unlike the geopolymer gel from\ngeopolymers, in the case of blast furnace slag, calcium and silicate hydrates\ncan form as secondary products. Due to the compounds with Ca, an increased\nstrength of the cement can be obtained at an early age. However, this\nresistance differs depending on the composition of the slag, the method of\nhardening or the activator used. It has been reported that an increase in the\nconcentration of Na_2O in the activator solution leads to the development of\ntobermorite and hydrotalcite crystals and the compressive strength increases\nto 39.92 MPa, for a concentration of 15% Na_2O [31]. In their study, Pern\u00e1 and\nHanzl\u00ed\u010dek [32] report that the use of blast furnace slag as a precursor, in\naddition to clay, can lead to an increase in the setting time of geopolymers.\nThe mixing method also has an important impact on the setting time. Another\nconclusion of the study was that, by increasing the slag content, the setting\ntime can be substantially reduced. One study [33] reported that cement with\nbasic slag led to a higher compressive strength than cement with acid slag.\nAccording to the standard ENV 197\u20131:1992 [34], the ratio between the mass of\nCaO and MgO and the mass of SiO_2 must be greater than 1.0 because otherwise,\nthe slag would be hydraulically inactive [35]. In another study, Escalante-\nGarcia et al. [36] found that slag with a higher glass fraction was more\nreactive than slag with a lower glass fraction. Liu et al. [33] reported that\nan increase in the glass mass content does not lead to an increase in the\ncompressive strength. Depending on the size of the particles, some researchers\n[37] said that particles <5 \u03bcm ensure adequate hydration and a particle size >\n20 \u03bcm provides a less reactive slag.\n\n#### 2.4. Glass Waste\n\nGlass waste is a rich source of silica (71\u201375%) and adding it to concrete\nimproves its microstructure. The optimal size of the glass particles,\napproximately 38\u201375 \u03bcm, increases the pozzolanic activity and the development\nof hydration products. The durability of concrete is influenced by the pore\nnetwork. The concrete based on waste glass is denser, due to the filling\neffect given by the glass particles that disturb the connectivity of the pores\nand the penetration of water and chlorides is less than for Portland cement.\nThe sulfates attack, especially the Mg sulfate, can degrade the hydration\nproducts, causing their decalcification and leaching. The durability of\nconcrete increases by adding glass powder with a high pozzolanic content\nbecause the calcium hydrate transforms into calcium-silicate hydrate.\nGeopolymerization is influenced by the Si/Al ratio, which is considered\noptimal between 3.3\u20134.5. To ensure a high solubility of glass waste in\nconcrete, an alkaline solution at a pH of over 10.7 is used. If silica excess\nin the geopolymer system, an adequate source of alumina is needed to form\nzeolitic products. Following geopolymerization, strong Si-O-Si, Si-O-Al and\nAl-O-Al bonds result [4]. A study investigated geopolymers based on glass\nwaste obtained by crushing soda-lime glass bottles and class C fly ash mixed\nin different proportions. Sodium hydroxide solutions with different molarities\n(0\u201310 M) were used for activation. The pastes were cured at room temperature.\nIt was found that the glass waste acted as an inert material at the beginning\ndue to the slow reaction speed. After 14 days, as the glass particles reacted\nwith the fly ash, the mechanical strength of the concrete increased. The\ncompressive strength of concrete with 1:3 glass/fly ash precursors, activated\nwith a 5M NaOH solution, was 34.5 MPa [38].\n\n#### 2.5. Silica Fume\n\nSilica fume cannot be activated when used alone as a binder because it needs a\nsource of Ca. For example, ordinary Portland cement (OPC) can be used as a\nsource of calcium in the alkaline activation of silica fume. In order to\nimprove the physical and mechanical properties of mortar cement, Caldas and\ncollaborators [39] carried out a study in which they added silica fume to OPC\nas a pozzolanic additive. The addition of NaOH and KOH had the role of\nensuring a combined mechanism of alkaline activation in the silica fume. The\nrheology of alkali-activated cements differs from OPC rheology due to the loss\nof workability in alkali-activated mortars and concretes. The partial\nreplacement of cement with silica fume tried to verify its activation\npotential. The authors replaced OPC with silica fume (10 and 20%) in several\nways: without activation, activated by NaOH and activated by KOH. The results\nshowed that NaOH accelerates the setting process of the paste without\naffecting its workability. It was found that due to the alkaline environment\nof the cement, the dissolution of KOH, which is also strongly alkaline, is\ndelayed, affecting the workability of the material. The compressive and\ndiametral compressive strengths are higher in samples with silica fume\nactivated alkaline with NaOH and KOH compared to the non-activated material\ndue to the fact that tobermorites and zeolites form by alkaline activation.\nThe addition of 20% NaOH to the silica fume increased the kinetics of\nreactions. The mechanical strengths of the materials activated with KOH were\nhigher than those activated with NaOH due to the stronger chemical bonds\nformed [39].\n\n#### 2.6. Ceramic Waste Powders\n\nDue to the silico-aluminous crystalline content, ceramic waste can improve the\nmechanical properties and lastingness of concrete. Many reports in the\nliterature refer to the use of ceramic waste for the partial replacement of\nOPC, analyzing the mechanical properties and durability of cements in which\nceramics are introduced as a binder or fine or coarse aggregate or both.\nCeramic waste is known to have pozzolanic properties. Substitution of fine\nnatural aggregates in geopolymers with ceramic waste powders results in lower\nwater absorption. For these wastes, the activation depends on the percentage\nof Na_2O, on the SiO_2/Na_2O ratio, but also in the hardening techniques. It\nhas been shown that the use of optimal proportions of sodium hydroxide/sodium\nsilicate mixture and the addition of Ca(OH)_2 is very important for the\nkinetics of geopolymerization, impacting the mechanical properties and\nmicrostructure of geopolymeric mortars. An addition of 4.5% wt Ca(OH)_2 can\nlead to good workability and compressive strengths of 21 and 27.5 MPa after 3\nand 7 days at 65 \u00b0C. Also, with increasing waste content of ceramic powder\nalso increased the temperature resistance of mortars activated with alkalis\n[40].\n\n## 3\\. Alkaline Activators\n\nThe most common alkaline activators used to obtain geopolymers are sodium or\npotassium hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) [41] or a mixture of them, sodium or\npotassium silicates [42,43], carbonates [44], etc. The solubility of the\nalumina or silica precursors, as well as the structure and properties of the\nresulting polymers, is influenced by the type of the alkaline activators and\ntheir concentration [45,46]. Kale and Chaudhary [47] believed that the size of\nthe cation in the activation solution leads to the formation of a stronger\nnetwork after polycondensation, being more favored by potassium than by\nsodium. There are studies that report the influence of the molarity of the\nalkaline solution on the compressive strength and the setting time of\ngeopolymers. A higher pH value of the alkaline activation solution favors the\nsolubility of the precursors. Geopolymerization is favored by the reactivity\nof the alkaline solution [48,49,50]. The low-heat Portland cement has a lower\nshrinkage than medium-heat Portland cement and ordinary Portland cement, due\nto the degree of hydration owned to alkali sulfates. Cracking of cement-based\nmaterials increases as the alkaline sulfate content increases. The contraction\nof cement-based materials is greater in the presence of K_2SO_4 compared to\nthe presence of Na_2SO_4, being influenced by the hydration process. The\nstructure and size of the pores, but their distribution, influence the loss of\nwater inside the pores, creating a negative pressure that leads to cracking of\nthe material [51]. Another study [52], regarding fly ash, noted that the\nmixture of NaOH and Na silicate solution as an alkaline activator led to a\nhigher compressive strength than the use of NaOH alone. To improve resistance,\na molar ratio (SiO_2:Na_2O) between 1.5 and 2.0 is recommended. An increase in\nthe ratio leads to a decrease in resistance. Purbasari et al. [53] reported\nthat the use of a solution of KOH and water glass as an activator, with\nadditional temperature (60 \u00b0C), leads to obtaining a geopolymer with a higher\ncompressive strength. These researchers also observed a difference between the\nstructures of the geopolymers obtained by alkaline activation with a NaOH or\nKOH solution compared to the geopolymers obtained after activation with a\nwater-glass mixture with either of the two. If in the first case, the\ngeopolymers are more porous, the adding of water glass led to a more dense and\nhomogeneous structure. Giacobello et al. [54] state, that to obtain a\ngeopolymer with certain characteristics, the alkaline activator must be\nselected according to the nature of the precursors. The silicates used as\nactivators will increase the Si/Al ratio in the precursors, while using\nhydroxides, as activators, a change to the M_2O/Al_2O_3 and M_2O/H_2O ratios,\nbalancing the negativity of the Al tetrahedra and ensuring a pH that favors\nthe dissolution of the precursors before synthesis will occur. The combination\nof the two types of alkaline activators is considered a good choice because an\nexcess of silicate can inhibit water evaporation, leading to a decrease in\ncompressive strength, and redundancy of hydroxide also leads to a decrease in\nthe geopolymer\u2019s resistance. The structure of the geopolymer can also vary\ndepending on the nature of the used activators. The use of sodium hydroxide,\nfor example, leads to a porous network in the fly ash precursors with Si/Al\nand Na/Al ratios of 1.5 and 0.48, respectively, in the hydration products. The\nuse of the mixture of NaOH and Na_2SiO_3 as an alkaline activator leads to a\nmicroporous network between the fly ash particles with Si/Al molar ratios of\n2.8 and Na/Al of 0.46. Depending on the nature and ratio of the alkaline\nactivators, they can influence the hydration and microstructure of the\ngeopolymeric material, leading to better or worse performances.\n\n## 4\\. Fibers Used as Reinforcement of Geopolymers\n\nMaterials obtained from natural resources have been used in buildings since\nthe ancient Egyptians who used straw and horsehair for mud bricks. With the\nfocus on reducing environmental pollution to ensure a healthier living\nclimate, new materials reinforced with natural fibers or polymers arose. In\nthe beginning, synthetic fibers were used to reinforce geopolymer composites,\nsuch as carbon, steel, glass, basalt [55], organic fibers (polyvinyl alcohol\nfibers (PVA), polyethylene fibers (PE), polypropylene fibers (PP)), and\nvarious carbon or glass fibers [56].\n\nNatural fibers can be divided into three categories: vegetable fibers, animal\nfibers and mineral fibers. Animal fibers are used less due to the collection\nmethod, which is difficult. Asbestos, as a mineral fiber, being considered\ncarcinogenic, is not indicated for obtaining ecological materials. Therefore,\nthe most used natural fibers are vegetable ones. In turn, plant fibers can be\nwoody or non-woody. Wood fibers can come from softwood or hardwood. Non-wood\nfibers are classified according to the part of the plant they belong to: the\nstem (jute and hemp), fruits (coconut, cotton), leaves (sisal, banana and\npineapple), straw (corn, wheat and rice), and grass (bamboo and elephant\ngrass) [57]. Vegetable fibers have two components: cellulose, a linear\npolymer, made of glucose units, whose concentration depends on the age of the\nplants, and a structure from a biochemical material called lignin. Cellulose\nis the main component that influences the mechanical properties of fibers. The\ndegree of cellulose polymerization is different from one plant species to\nanother, and the mechanical properties can also be influenced by the type of\nfiber, its diameter or length, the extraction method, the harvesting time, the\norientation of the fiber, the method used to obtain the geopolymer composite,\nthe porosity, etc.\n\nThe main advantages of vegetable fibers compared to synthetic fibers, in\naddition to the fact that they contribute significantly to the improvement of\ntensile and bending resistance, are that the former are found in abundance in\nnature, are not dangerous, and are biodegradable, light, and cheap. The\ntensile strength is also influenced by the maturity of the plants, being lower\nfor long fibers than short fibers, most likely due to defects that can appear\nalong the fibers [58]. However, the durability and reinforcement of\ngeopolymers with natural fibers can be damaged due to the degradation of the\nfibers in the geopolymer matrix. This deterioration can occur both due to\nexternal factors and due to internal factors. The alkaline environment of the\ngeopolymers, the fiber\u2013matrix interface, but also the increase in volume of\nthe fibers can influence their deterioration over time. Attacks on natural\nreinforcing fibers can be physical, biological, mechanical, chemical, or\ncombinations thereof. The degradation of plant fibers is greatly influenced by\ntheir composition. The main components being cellulose, hemicellulose and\nlignin. For example, the arrangement of cellulose microfibrils gives cellulose\nfibers a good resistance to chemical and biological attacks. On the other\nhand, the hydrophilic nature of hemicellulose under the action of acids and\nweak bases can be hydrolyzed and easily degraded at temperatures or following\nbiological attacks [59]. Lignin being hydrophobic is very resistant to most\nattacks. Practically, the strongly polarized hydroxyl (OH) groups are\nresponsible for the hygroscopic nature of the fibers which leads to their\nseparation in the interface area leading to poor adhesion to the geopolymer\nmatrix. In this sense, solutions are being searched to avoid the degradation\nof the fibers by carrying out specific treatments, both in terms of geopolymer\nmatrix and fibers [58,59]. One of the tartaring methods, to reduce the water\nabsorption of cellulose fibers, is hornification. This is a technique for\nmodifying the polymer structure of the fiber, through repeated drying and\nrewetting. The chemical treatment would be another solution. The silanization\nof the fibers could create much stronger bonds between the fibers and the\ngeopolymer matrix in the interface area, significantly increasing their\nadhesion. Another treatment could be the heat treatment of the fibers to\nreduce the OH groups and decrease their hydrophilicity. The carbonation of the\ncement matrix can also avoid fiber degradation, being a technique capable of\nreducing the alkalinity of the capillary water, allowing the reaction between\nCO_2 and alkaline hydroxides, with the formation of carbonates (calcite),\nreducing the OH ions in the composite. Adding furnace slag, fly ash, silica\nfume or metakaolin as pozzolanic agents can be another technique to increase\nthe durability of natural fiber reinforcement. Upon hydration, amorphous Si\nreacts with Ca(OH)_2, resulting in a stable hydrated salt of calcium silicate.\nMatrix pore sealants and fiber impregnation with water-repellent agents is\nalso another technique. All these additional techniques can lead to obtaining\nthe anticipated results by introducing natural fibers for reinforcement in\ngeopolymers [58,59].\n\n## 5\\. The Mechanism Used to Obtain Geopolymer Cement\n\nThis section may be divided in subheadings. It should provide a concise and\nprecise description of the experimental results, their interpretation, as well\nas the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.\n\nPacheco-Torgal et al. [60] proposed a mechanism for obtaining geopolymeric\ncement based on fly ash. They mentioned that the dissolution of Si and Al\ntakes place through the action of the OH group when the alkaline solution is\nadded to the fly ash, leading to the appearance of the gel following\ncondensation of the higher molecules. The ash particles are attacked first at\nthe surface, penetrating through the defects created on the surface and then\nfrom the inside to the surface, until they are almost completely consumed\n[16]. Following the alkaline activation, the Si-O-Si bonds in the\naluminosilicate materials are broken, and new phases are obtained in the\nsolution. Water played the role of a carrier for the activation agent. The\npenetration of aluminum atoms in the Si-O-Si structure leads to the formation\nof an aluminosilicate gel in the form of Mn(-(Si-O)z\u2013Al\u2013O)n. wH_2O, where M =\natoms of K, Na or Ca, n = degree of polycondensation, z = 1, 2, 3 or more\n[18]. The second phases of calcium silicate hydrate and calcium aluminate\nhydrate can appear depending on the reaction conditions and the composition of\nthe raw materials (if calcium is present in the composition) and water can\nresult from polycondensation. The alkaline activation process is influenced by\nthe concentration of solid matter [18]. Therefore, the strengthening stages of\nthe geopolymeric material can be summarized as: the dissolution of Si and Al\natoms, the condensation of the precursor ions into monomers and finally the\nformation of the polymer structure following polycondensation [16]. Silicon-\noxoaluminate polymers are called polysylates. In the polymeric network formed\nby sialates, positive ions (Na^+, K^+, Ca^2+, etc.) play the role of balancing\nthe negative charge of Al. Si^4+ and Al^3+ chains and rings can be formed and\ncross-linked together by sialated Si-O-Al. Polysialates can range from\namorphous to semicrystalline silico-aluminate structures [61]. Davidovits et\nal. [62] proposed a mechanism starting from class F fly ash (CaO less than 8\nwt.%) and using, instead of silicate (K silicate) and hydroxide, an alkali\nmetal silicate together with a slag furnace (Ca/Si \u2265 1). The slag participates\nas basic Ca silicate in the geopolymeric reaction, and the fly ash particles\nreact only on the surface. Active silica and alumina, on the surfaces of the\nparticles, are obtained after dissolving the ash with an alkali metal\nhydroxide. Then, there is a polymerization of the active surface groups and\nthe soluble elements, resulting in a gel that will harden, forming the\ngeopolymer [63].\n\nWhen mixing fly ash with the solution of NaOH and Na_3SiO_4, spherical\nparticles form that cannot be dissolved, and a layer of gel rich in silica\nmatrix will be formed and cured in time (Figure 4a yellow square, turquoise\narrow and Figure 5). These spherical particles from fly ash will contribute to\nthe reinforcement of the geopolymer matrix and will increase the mechanical\nproperties. In Figure 4a, the turquoise arrow shows that some spherical\nparticles of glass are deboned at the fractured surfaces. During mixing the\ngeopolymer paste, air was included, which will remain inside the cured\ngeopolymer (Figure 4a blue arrow). In Figure 4b\u2013d the cured geopolymer matrix\naround the wood fibers and on the surface of the microfibrils of the wood can\nbe seen. This adhesion between geopolymer-wood fibers is important for\nmechanical properties, which decrease with increasing quantity of wood fibers\n[13]. Figure 4f\u2013h shows the distribution of wood fibers in the geopolymer\nmatrix, for the wood fiber reinforced geopolymer composites. The adhesion\nbetween the spherical particles and the fly ash silica gel through a network\ncan be seen in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 4.

The Addition of Fibers, Expansion Agent or Polymers in the Building\nMaterials\n\nGeopolymers with various fibers or polymers could be alternative binders in\nbuilding materials for improving the properties of masonry. The ratio for\nprecursors and concentration of alkaline activators has an influence on the\nmechanical resistances, the dry unit weight, and thermal conductivity. Also,\nthe ratios between the added precursors has an influence on the surface\nstructure of the samples. To improve thermal and mechanical properties of\nlight mortars, Tiyasangthong et al. [64] have carried out some tests on\ncellular mortars with geopolymers based on fly ash reinforced with polyvinyl\nalcohol (PVA) specimens. The mortars also contained an air foaming agent and\nan alkaline activator based on silicate and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The\ninfluence of PVA and foam from the composition of the materials as well as the\nhardening time on the properties of the mortars was investigated. The smallest\nunit weight (10.10 kN/m^3) was obtained for mortars with 20 wt.% PVA and 2\nwt.% foam. As a result of its high viscosity, a too high concentration of PVA\ncan slow down the geopolymerization reaction, resulting in voids in the\nmaterial. Therefore, the resistances to compression and flexural strength of\nthe mortars investigated in this study, at all curing times, increased\ndirectly proportional to PVA concentrations of up to 5%, after which they\ndecreased. The thermal conductivity of the mortars investigated in the same\nstudy, at 7 and 28 days, decreased with increasing concentrations of PVA and\nfoam. The authors believe that due to the larger pores that occur at a higher\ncontent in foam, thermal transport is hindered by the formation of larger PVA\nfilms [64]. The addition of MgO in the concrete composition can act as an\nexpansion agent, because it forms Mg(OH)_2 crystals in the presence of water\nwhose growth can reduce the risk of cracking. Wang et al. investigated the\ninfluence of MgO percent and its reactivity on air voids, pore structure and\nconcrete permeability. They found that an increase in MgO content and its\nreactivity reduces the strength of concrete at all hydration ages. Also, the\naddition of MgO did not have a significant influence on the air voids. With\nthe addition of reactive MgO, the pore structure is compacter at an early age,\ndecreasing the fraction of large capillary pores. With the addition of weakly\nreactive MgO, the pore structure is compacter at a later age. Therefore, the\naddition of reactive MgO is beneficial for the impermeability of concrete,\nbecause it reacts quickly with water, causing a large expansion. The fractal\ndimension of the surface or pore volume is related to the permeability of the\nconcrete. The addition of weakly reactive MgO in concrete can lead to an\nincreased strength over time, while reactive MgO cannot [65]. According to\nanother study, the addition of fly ash and PVA fibers increases the\ncompressive strength and tensile capacity of late-age concrete because it\nrefines and optimizes the pore structure. The addition of MgO and shrinkage-\nreducing additives, on the other hand, reduce compressive and tensile strength\nat various ages, being less effective in pore refinement [66].\n\nInvestigations on other cellular mortars were also carried out by Yoosuk et\nal. [67], the mortars were composed of geopolymers based on fly ash with a\nhigh calcium content, polypropylene fibers (0\u20133 wt.%), NaOH (2\u20138 M) and foam\n(0\u20132 wt.%). The increase in fiber and foam load and the decrease in the\nconcentration of NaOH led to a decrease in the weight of materials. The lowest\nvalue (541 kg/m^3) was recorded for the sample with the highest fiber and foam\nload but with 2% NaOH. The highest value of the compressive strength (20.94\nMPa) was recorded for the mortar with 0.5 wt.% fibers and 8M NaOH without\nfoam. The maximum flexural strength (3.85 MPa; density of 1279 kg/m^3) was\nrecorded for the sample with 2.5 wt.% fibers, 8M NaOH, without foam. For the\nsamples with 2M NaOH (a more desirable concentration from an environmental but\nalso an economic point of view), the maximum values of the compressive and\nbending strengths were 12 MPa and 2.07 MPa, respectively, corresponding to the\nrequirements of the standard [67]. Tabyang et al. [68] investigated the\nmaximum dry unit weight, and mechanical properties, and performed a\nmicrostructural analysis for lateryl soil samples reinforced with coconut\nfiber and mixed with a fly ash-based geopolymer. As an activation solution,\nthey used a mixture of sodium silicate (Na_2SiO_3) and NaOH. The authors\nbelieve that the optimal precursor/sample mixture is given by the following\nratios: 1/1 lateryl soil/geopolymer with fly ash, 80/20 Na_2SiO_3/NaOH (using\n5 M NaOH) and a content of 0.5 wt.% coconut fiber. It was shown that coconut\nfiber promoted the geopolymerization reaction by the fact that the matrix of\nthe sample with coconut fiber was compacter than that of the sample without\ncoconut fiber. However, a larger addition of coconut fiber led to an increase\nin the porosity of the material. Along with the increase in the ratio lateryl\nsoil/geopolymer with fly ash and the concentration of NaOH, the maximum dry\nunit weight of the samples also increased. It was also found that the alkaline\nactivator content of the geopolymer with ash is constant when the NaOH\nconcentration is higher. After 7 days, the unconfined compressive and flexural\nstrengths increased with the addition of 5 wt.% coconut fiber [68].\n\n## 7\\. The Influence of Different Precursors on Geopolymer Properties\n\nThe reintroduction of geopolymers in the manufacturing process of new building\nmaterials represents a real challenge for the future, both for environmental\nprotection and for the huge stocks of waste from demolitions or the remains\nleft after their use. Saving the energy consumed to obtain geopolymers, but\nalso the reduction in gas emissions, represents their notable advantages that\ncould lead to the replacement of some common binders such as cement or lime\n[69]. Wattimena and collaborators [70] studied the replacement of cement as a\nbinder in conventional concrete, with fly ash as a source of aluminosilicates.\nThey investigated several types of fly ash, obtained in different ways, to\nobserve their influence on the properties of the obtained geopolymers. It was\nconcluded that different sources of ash can influence the synthesis of\ngeopolymeric concretes. The authors conclude that the chemical composition and\nthe physical properties of the fly ash influence the behavior of the paste and\nthe reinforced geopolymer. Also, for a low Ca content (class F ash), fewer\nproblems appear compared to those for ash with a higher Ca content, where the\nreaction time is faster and intermittent. However, geopolymers with higher Ca\ncontent can provide compressive strengths over time, due to the hydration\nreaction in addition to the polymerization reaction. Because the properties of\nfly ash cannot be controlled, the authors say that the fly ash must be further\ntested before being used as a source of aluminosilicates in geopolymer. Jiang\net al. [71] followed the effect of temperature (up to 1200 \u00b0C) on the thermo-\nmechanical properties of geopolymers obtained from class C and class F fly\nash. They noted that geopolymer pastes with class F fly ash presented higher\nmechanical properties and thermal performance at temperatures below 500 \u00b0C,\nwhile others, from class C fly ash, recorded higher mechanical properties and\nsuperior thermal performance at higher temperatures (>800 \u00b0C).\n\nKirgiz [72] carried out a study in which he proposed to overcome some effects\nsuch as rapid gelation and reduced initial strength of fly ash substituted\ncement of class F by the addition of nanographite particles and of\nsuperplasticizer. The pastes were composed of lime with nanographite and water\nand the variation in the Ca(OH)_2 content was monitored. In addition to sand,\nthe investigated mortars had these cements in their composition. In some\ncompositions, only water was added; in others, a superplasticizer was added.\nThe author emphasized the role of nanographite as a consumer of the Ca(OH)_2\ncontent. Improvement in the mechanical resistances was achieved with the help\nof nanographite, reducing the amount of pure Portland cement. The\nsuperplasticizer reduced the rapid gelation process.\n\nIn their study, Wang et al. [73] obtained geopolymers from alkaline-activated\nmetakaolin with a mixture of hydroxide and Na silicate. The Na/Al ratio\ngradually increased in the samples from 0.43 to 0.93 and the mechanical\nproperties increased until Na/Al = 0.73 ratio. Once the Na/Al molar ratio was\nfixed, the Si/Al ratio also changed, from 1.7 to 1.95. They found that the\nhighest mechanical strength value (21.3 MPa) was recorded for a Si/Al ratio of\n1.90 and the strength of the geopolymer is mainly based on the formation of\nthe NASH gel. The moderate increase in alkalinity led to a faster dissolution\nof metakaolin, positively influencing geopolymerization. However, a higher\nincrease can inhibit the polyreaction through high crystallization. Another\nfinding was related to the water content, which was similar for all samples up\nto 20 days after hardening and finally reached 15%. The optimal mixing ratio\ndiffers from material to material, depending on the source of aluminosilicate\nused and other external factors [73].\n\nFly ash geopolymers can improve soil resistance; due to their high dry weight\nand low plasticity index, the lateritic soil can be used in paving materials\n[1]. Tesanasin et al. [1] carried out a study with the aim of improving the\nproperties of the marginal lateritic soil, with the help of a one-part fly ash\ngeopolymer with high calcium content. This method uses the alkaline activator\nin solid form to ease the production process and avoid some shortcomings, such\nas low workability or corrosion. The precursors are mixed, and water is added\nonly at the end. As an alkaline activator, they used NaOH flake form, adding\ndifferent concentrations of solid activator to the composition of the samples.\nThey found that to improve unconfined compressive strength, indirect tensile\nstrength and microstructure, the optimal activator content is 20 wt.% or less.\nAfter 7 days, the unconfined compressive strength was 1930 kPa under soaked\nconditions and 2800 kPa under unsoaked conditions, while the indirect tensile\nstrength was 270 kPa and 400 kPa. The values of both resistances were lower in\nthe case of soaked samples because of the repulsive forces between the clay\nparticles. After 28 days, the values of both mechanical resistances increased,\nwhich means that the reaction between the precursors continued during this\ntime interval. Furthermore, the Ca content influences both the setting time\nand the mechanical properties. From the microstructural analysis of the sample\nsurfaces, was observed that when a higher content of alkaline activator is\nadded, beyond the optimum, the appearance of microcracks can lead to a\nweakening of the microstructure [1].\n\nSuksiripattanapong et al. [74] carried out a study on the possibility of\nimproving soft Bangkok clay (watery soil with low shear resistance and\ncompressibility), through prefabricated vertical drainage, grouting or deep\nmixing of the soil. They investigated the use of geopolymers with a PVA and\nfly ash with high Ca content to improve the resistance of this type of soil.\nAs an alkaline activator, they used a liquid mixture of sodium silicate\nNa_2SiO_3 and NaOH. The authors [74] investigated the influence of the content\nof PVA, fly ash, water, and alkaline activator, but also of the ratio between\nthe two components of the activator, the added concentration of PVA and the\ncuring time on the microstructure of the sample surfaces and on the unconfined\ncompressive strength. It was found that after 28 days, the unconfined\ncompressive strength of 1026 kPa was obtained for a ratio between the two\ncomponents of the alkaline activator equal to 1, an ash content of 40 wt.% and\nan activator/fly ash ratio equal to 0.6. An improvement in resistance was\nobserved by 40\u201342% (both after 7 and after 28 days), due to the formation of\nstrong bonds between the soil particles, by adding a content of 15 wt.% PVA,\nwith a concentration of 4 wt.%, thus meeting the requirements of resistance.\nFrom the microstructural analysis, was observed that a lower content of PVA (5\nwt.%) seeps into the pores of the geopolymer with fly ash, while a higher\ncontent (25 wt.%) surrounds the ash particles, delaying the geopolymerization.\nTherefore, the PVA films found in geopolymerization products were observed\nwith an optimal content of 15 wt.%. Another finding of the study was that the\nunconfined compressive strength of the fly ash geopolymer increases over the\n28 days for a Na_2SiO_3/NaOH activation mixture ratio < 2, by consuming the\nsilica and alumina content of the fly ash leading to the formation of\ngeopolymerization products over time. In the case of a Na_2SiO_3/NaOH ratio >\n2, the increase in resistance over time is slower, due to the slower\ngeopolymerization process, due to the lower NaOH content. After 7 and 28 days,\nrespectively, the unconfined compressive strength of the samples increased to\nan activator/ash ratio of 0.6 as the ratio of the activator components\nNa_2SiO_3/NaOH decreased and the water content decreased. Above this value,\nthe resistance increases as the ratio of the activation components increases.\nThe NaOH content in the activator is important; if it is high, even for a\nlower Na_2SiO_3/NaOH ratio, it leads to the appearance of large pores in the\nsamples where the fluid can drain, slowing down the geopolymerization process\n[74].\n\nSlag-based geopolymers have been included in building materials since 1957\n[75]. Ground granulated blast furnace slag contains oxides of calcium,\nsilicon, aluminum, and magnesium [76]. Zhuguo and Sha [77] analyzed the\ncarbonation depths of some geopolymeric concretes, using fly ash and ground\nfurnace slag as an aluminosilicate substrate, conducting the carbonation test\nafter different periods of time. The study concludes that at room temperature,\nthe resistance to carbonation of geopolymeric concrete based on a mixture of\nash and slag is lower than that of ordinary concrete with Portland cement. The\nincrease in resistance to carbonation is very much on the blast furnace slag.\nThe resistance in carbonation results in the increase in the slag content from\nthe active filler mixture and the NaOH concentration of an active activator,\nwith a decrease in the ratio between the activator and the active filler but\nalso from the ratio between the water content and the active filler.\nFurthermore, an increase in hardening temperature and fineness of the slag\ncontributes to ensuring greater resistance to the carbonation of geopolymeric\nconcrete. Aziz et al. 2020 [76] performed a series of compressive strength\ntests on some geopolymers based on granulated and ground blast furnace slag\nusing different ratios of solid/liquid and alkaline activators and came to the\nconclusion that at a solid/liquid ratio equal to 3 and an alkaline activator\nratio of 2.5, after 28 days of curing, a compressive strength of 168.7 MPa was\nobtained. Furthermore, the formation of tobermorite and CaCO_3 (confirmed by\nXRD), due to higher concentrations of Ca in areas with silica and alumina,\ncontributed to the increase in compression resistance.\n\n## 8\\. Conclusions\n\nBased on the literature, the most used precursors for geopolymer are fly ash,\nmetakaolin, glass waste, and blast furnace slag. The compressive strength of\ngeopolymer increased when the particle size of class F fly was the smallest\nand the activator/fly ash ratio was the highest. F-type ash is recommended in\nthe synthesis of geopolymers. The more aluminum in the aluminosilicate source\n(at least 20 wt.%), the higher the reactivity. The mixing method of\ngeopolymers also has an important impact on the setting time. The most used\nactivators are NaOH, KOH and Na_2SiO_3. The mechanical properties can also be\ninfluenced by the type of fiber, diameter, length, extraction method,\nharvesting time, orientation of the fiber, the method used to obtain the\ngeopolymer composite, and porosity. Geopolymers with various fibers or\npolymers could be alternative binders in building materials for improving the\nproperties of masonry. The addition of MgO to the concrete composition can act\nas an expansion agent and shrinkage-reducing additive; on the other hand, it\nreduces compressive and tensile strength at various ages, and is less\neffective in pore refinement. There are multiple possibilities of using\ngeopolymers to support a circular economy, by transforming some waste into new\nmaterials with the potential of reusing them in various industries. Most of\nthe limitations of the literature studies are related to the durability,\nshort-term and long-term mechanical properties of the geopolymers, as there is\nstill no well-established code of practice regarding the composition and\noptimal ratio of components in geopolymers or of the use of geopolymers,\ntaking into account the setting reactions involved.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, D.P.
