Just put the device you want to charge on\nthe wireless charger without worrying about plugging in a cable. Yet as it\nturns out, the disadvantages of wireless charging may be more severe than you\nthink, at least according to tests by iFixIt\u2019s [Shahram Mokhtari] and\ncolleagues. In the article the basics of wireless charging are covered, as\nwell as why wireless charging wastes a lot more power even when not charging,\nand why it may damage your device\u2019s battery faster than wired charging.\n\nThe inefficiency comes mostly from the extra steps needed to create the\nalternating current (AC) with wireless coupling between the coils, and the\nconversion back to DC. Yet it is compounded by the issue of misaligned coils,\nwhich further introduce inefficiencies. Though various protocols seek to fix\nthis (Qi2 and Apple\u2019s MagSafe) using alignment magnets, these manage to lose\n59% of the power drawn from the mains due to these inefficiencies. Wireless\nchargers also are forced to stay active, polling for a new device to charge,\nwhich keeps a MagSafe charger sucking up 0.2 W in standby.\n\nIf the losses from wired charging for a year come down to leaving a 10 W LED\nlamp on for eight hours total, wireless charging with MagSafe or Qi2 has you\nleaving that lamp on for 24 days straight. Since your phone is not a lamp,\nthis means that much of this wasted power is dissipated as heat, both on the\ntransmitting and receiving end. With the wireless receiving coil being placed\npractically on top of the battery in smartphones, this means that you are\nbumping the battery temperature up by about 8\u00b0C in the best scenario (fully\naligned MagSafe/Qi2) over wired charging, and a sustained 40+\u00b0C in the case of\na misaligned Qi charger, or the worst of all: the Tesla Charging Platform with\nits many overlapping coils.\n\nThus if plugging in a cable to connect a device is that much of a hassle, be\nsure to at the very least get a wireless charging solution that doesn\u2019t\nsimultaneously bump up your power bill and shorten the lifespan of the\ndevice\u2019s battery.\n\nPosted in Phone HacksTagged wireless charging\n\n## 40 thoughts on \u201cHow Wireless Charging Works And Why It\u2019s Terrible\u201d\n\n  1.

I\u2019ve migrated to using a 3d printed base on my old wireless\ncharger to properly center/locate my phone. Sadly, many chargers are tiny\nmedallions that you need to balance your phone on, so this 3d printed base\nalso served to better secure the phone as well. If you want to move away from\nwireless charging, I found a \u2018decent\u2019 alternative is to use magsafe usb\nchargers. Not the real thing of course, the cheap knock-offs for usb-micro and\nusb-C work decently well. If you are careful about the product you find/buy,\nthen you can use the same cord for apple/micro/USB-C items as long as you have\nthe appropriate \u2018nub\u2019 in the device to accept the cord.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    2. andrewjhull says:\n\nApril 22, 2024 at 9:14 am\n\nI have a box full of old phone chargers for various obsolete connectors.

Plop it into a cradle, and\nit charges. This was standard on the bottom of cordless phones, walkie-\ntalkies, and other devices for decades. Like so many obvious solutions, this\nhas been \u201cforgotten\u201d by current vendors.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    5. fonz says:\n\nApril 22, 2024 at 1:29 pm\n\nyeh, if charging wireless saves just one phone from the scrap heap with a\nbroken connector you can probably afford quite a bit of loss before it is a\nnet loss environmentally\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  3.

These phones got charged in a cradle that you just\ndropped the phone into/onto. The old equivalent of POGO pins made contact and\nprovided power. Of course there was no standard for the power connection but\nthat doesn\u2019t mean that there couldn\u2019t be. If really needed (is it?).\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1.

I can either replace it at significant cost,\nplug in a wire a dozen times a day or put it on the inefficiency puck, but\nhave a phone charged and ready to go whenever I need it.\n\nThe latter is the most convenient, and possibly the most environmentally\nresponsible as well.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  6.

It can be\nconvenient, and I\u2019m willing to accept the power loss being that in the grand\u2019s\ngame of things it\u2019s a very small amount. The issue I have with wireless\ncharging a phone, is that my current phone, and the manufacturer\u2019s supplied\ncharging base have no alignment mechanism whatsoever. Which means it\u2019s not\nreally much more convenient than plugging in, and tends to be even more\ninefficient than it needs to be. The other big issue I have is people are now\npushing for wireless charging for things like cars. And there it is a horrible\nidea. Even if you manage the efficiency that cell phones get, that is an\nincredible amount of wasted power when you were talking the scale of a\nvehicle, but there\u2019s no way you\u2019re even going to get to that efficiency\nconsidering that you have several inches of air gap to deal with, and likely\neven worse alignment than cell phones. So yes, I want to keep wireless\ncharging for cell phones, but no I don\u2019t want my car to charge that way!\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  11.
