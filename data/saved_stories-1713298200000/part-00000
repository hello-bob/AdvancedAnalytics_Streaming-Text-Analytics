One of the more common types of harmonographs uses\ntwo independent pendulums, one with a piece of paper above the pivot and the\nother with a pen on an arm. There are various other types also in existence,\nlike my working one. I have built two harmonographs, one a success - shown\nbelow and the second more or less a failure.| My first harmonograph is made\nfrom an old shelf laden with bricks hung from my door frame with string. I\nused 'twiddelys' or food ties to make the string into an upside down Y shape.\nThis enables the shelf to twist slightly which replaces the need to have a\nsecond pendulum, but produces slightly different harmonograms to the usual\nones. Paper is put on the shelf, and a pen hinged using coat hangers held\ntogether with tape from a chair. To work the harmonograph I swing the shelf\nand gently lower the pen onto the paper. It can produce reasonably sized\n(around about 10/20cm across) in my opinion, beautiful, harmonograms.  \n---  \nAnother view of the harmonograph and some examples of what it has produced:  \n---  \n  \n(click for a larger image)\n\nMy second harmonograph was an attempt at one with two pendulums. In the\nabsence of any good hinges, or a way to make such hinges I used string. This\nenabled the pendulums to twist, which meant that it didn't work properly.\n\nThe harmonograms it produced were mostly rubbish, small scribbles. However it\ndid manage to produce these few reasonable spirals, note that these are\nprobably larger than the originals which were roughly tuppence sized.  \n---  \n  \nOne day I may try to build some proper hinges and give it another shot.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
