Any connection between these\nevents is tantalizing but unclear. Here, we present single crystal\npaleointensity data from 2054 and 591 Ma pyroxenites and gabbros that define a\ndramatic intensity decline, from a strong Proterozoic field like that of\ntoday, to an Ediacaran value 30 times weaker. The latter is the weakest time-\naveraged value known to date and together with other robust paleointensity\nestimates indicate that Ediacaran ultra-low field strengths lasted for at\nleast 26 million years. This interval of ultra-weak magnetic fields overlaps\ntemporally with atmospheric and oceanic oxygenation inferred from numerous\ngeochemical proxies. This concurrence raises the question of whether enhanced\nH ion loss in a reduced magnetic field contributed to the oxygenation,\nultimately allowing diversification of macroscopic and mobile animals of the\nEdiacara Fauna.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### An episodic high-intensity lunar core dynamo\n\nArticle 13 January 2022\n\n### The palaeoinclination of the ancient lunar magnetic field from an Apollo\n17 basalt\n\nArticle 27 September 2021\n\n### Hadaean to Palaeoarchaean stagnant-lid tectonics revealed by zircon\nmagnetism\n\nArticle Open access 14 June 2023\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe discovery of an ultra-low time-averaged field intensity (UL-TAFI, 0.7 \u00d7\n10^22 A m^2) from 565 Ma anorthosites of the Sept \u00celes Mafic Intrusive Suite\n(Quebec, Canada) suggested that the geodynamo approached the weak field state\nwhere core kinetic energy exceeds magnetic energy^1,2. Connections between\nunusual Ediacaran-Cambrian magnetic fields and evolutionary events^3\nproposed^4 prior to report of the UL-TAFI have been challenged^5\n(Supplementary Discussion\u2014The time-averaged geomagnetic field). As emphasized\nby Sagan nearly 60 years earlier^6, the atmosphere and ocean can shield life\nfrom energetic solar particles. For atmospheric loss controlled by the\nmagnetosphere^7 to have played an important role, it must have acted over a\nrelatively long time interval, and/or involved processes amplifying escape,\novercoming bounds imposed by the slow upward diffusion of atmospheric\nconstituents^8.\n\nThe Sept \u00celes UL-TAFI record is supported by paleointensity investigations of\nEdiacaran lavas and dikes^9. Nevertheless the data have limitations. Thellier\nanalyses of samples dominated by single domain magnetic carriers are the gold\nstandard for paleointensity determination because only these data are solidly\nbased on thermoremanent magnetization theory^10. Moreover, because the\ngeomagnetic field exhibits short term secular variation, time-averaging is\nneeded to detect trends reflecting evolving core processes (Supplementary\nDiscussion\u2014The time-averaged geomagnetic field). The Sept \u00celes Thellier data\nare time-averaged (~75 kyr) by virtue of the slow cooling of the anorthosites\nstudied^1. But this key time-averaged aspect has not yet been replicated with\nThellier data from single domain dominated samples of other localities.\n\nBono et al.^1 used single crystal paleointensity (SCP)^11 analyses to isolate\nideal magnetic records. The feldspar and pyroxene crystals measured contained\nmagnetic needles exsolved along crystallographic planes^12. Scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) analyses and magnetic hysteresis data confirmed their SD\nnature. Herein, we examine both the accuracy and duration the UL-TAFI through\na comparison of SCP analyses of 2054 Ma (South Africa)^13 and 591 Ma\n(Brazil)^14 rocks that come from a layered mafic intrusion and post-\ncollisional magmatic suite, respectively, where prior paleomagnetic and\ngeochronological studies have demonstrated the preservation of primary\nmagnetizations (Supplementary Discussion\u2014Geologic context and prior work).\nPlagioclase from the rocks studied have single domain magnetic characteristics\nnearly identical to those of the Sept \u00celes samples studied by Bono et al.^1.\nMotivated by the results, we then examine anew the potential connections of\nthe geomagnetic field and Ediacaran to Cambrian evolution, and propose\nlinkages with the paleomagnetosphere^15,16 and oxygenation^17,18,19,20.\n\n## Results\n\nWe collected eight plagioclase-bearing pyroxenite hand samples in the 2054 \u00b1\n1.3 Ma^13 Rustenberg Layered Intrusion of the Bushveld Complex in northern\nSouth Africa (Supplementary Fig. 1a; \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Magnetic\nsusceptibility versus temperature curves (K-T; Supplementary Fig. 2a, b;\n\u201cMaterials and methods\u201d) indicate that Ti-poor titanomagnetite and pure\nmagnetite are the dominant magnetic carriers in bulk samples (Supplementary\nDiscussion\u2014Rock magnetism of whole rocks). Magnetic hysteresis loops\n(\u201cMaterials and methods\u201d) of small bulk-rock specimens (Supplementary Fig. 2c,\nd) have relatively low coercive force (\\\\(\\overline{{B}_{c}}\\\\) = 13.6 \u00b1 8.5\nmT), remanent coercivity (\\\\(\\overline{{B}_{cr}}\\\\) = 60.8 \u00b1 31.2 mT), and\nsquareness (\\\\(\\overline{{M}_{rs}/{M}_{s}}\\\\) = 0.16 \u00b1 0.09; Supplementary\nTable 1). These data suggest the presence of pseudosingle domain and\nmultidomain magnetic grains (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In contrast, selected\noptically clear plagioclase grains have wide, open hysteresis loops (Fig. 1a\nand Supplementary Fig. 2e, f) and high values (\\\\(\\overline{{B}_{c}}\\\\) = 69.1\n\u00b1 15.7 mT, \\\\(\\overline{{B}_{cr}}\\\\) = 107.5 \u00b1 19.7 mT,\n\\\\(\\overline{{M}_{rs}/{M}_{s}}\\\\) = 0.48 \u00b1 0.08) (Supplementary Table 1),\nindicating the presence of single domain grains (Supplementary Fig. 3a).\n\nFig. 1: Rock magnetic, SEM, and paleointensity analysis of plagioclase\ncrystals from Bushveld pyroxenites.\n\na Magnetic hysteresis loop with images of the measured plagioclase crystal\n(lower right, scale bar 1 mm). b First order reversal curve (FORC) diagram for\nplagioclase crystal. c, d Backscatter SEM images of elongated magnetic\ninclusions observed in the plagioclase crystals (inset) and their\ncorresponding EDS spectra in 20 keV.

Squares are\nvertical projection of the magnetization; circles are horizontal projection.\nTemperature ranges used in the paleointensity fit shown in color.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe extraordinary magnetic recording properties of the plagioclase crystals\nare further supported by first order reversal curve (FORC) analysis and SEM\nanalyses (\u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). FORC diagrams of all clean plagioclase\nspecimens are highly peaked on the B_u = 0 axis and the contours are elongated\nwith negligible vertical spread (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating\nthe presence of noninteracting single domain grains. SEM and energy-dispersive\nX-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data reveal that iron-titanium oxide needles are\nomnipresent (Fig. 1c, d). The width of the needles is <500 nm, and the length\nvaries widely, but is often several \u03bcm. The presence of Ti further implicates\na high temperature of formation^12, indicating that the needles can carry a\nprimary thermoremanent magnetization.\n\nWe investigated absolute paleointensity by SCP Thellier-Coe analyses utilizing\nCO_2 laser heating^21 with partial thermal remanent magnetization (pTRM)\nchecks and selection criteria following prior SCP studies^1,22 (Fig. 1e, f and\nSupplementary Fig. 5, \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Twenty-two of the 175 crystals\nmeasured met selection criteria (17 are category A samples, and 5 are category\nB samples; Supplementary Table 2). The main cause of rejection was failed pTRM\nchecks. The characteristic remanent magnetization used for paleointensity\ncalculation was isolated between 360 and 580 \u00b0C. A single crystal from one\nhand sample (BQ1-D.14) showed higher unblocking, to 620 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig.\n5g and Supplementary Table 2). Categories A and B samples with applied field\nof 30 \u03bcT yield a mean paleointensity of 67.4 \u00b1 3.7 \u03bcT (n = 13), and samples\nwith applied field of 60 \u03bcT (all category A) define a mean paleointensity of\n71.2 \u00b1 4.6 \u03bcT (n = 9). These mean values appear to be drawn from the same\npopulation (Supplementary Discussion\u2014Applied field bias and recording\nreplication, Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting no correlation with the\nstrength of the applied TRM^23. The average paleointensity from all category A\nand B samples is 69.0 \u00b1 4.3 \u03bcT (n = 22). We correct for cooling rate using a\nfactor of 1.5 (Supplementary Discussion\u2014Paleointensity corrections (cooling\nrate and anisotropy) which yields a paleointensity of 48.6 \u00b1 3.0 \u03bcT (n = 22);\nwe further apply anisotropy corrections (\u201cMaterials and methods\u201d;\nSupplementary Discussion\u2014Paleointensity corrections (cooling rate and\nanisotropy) leading to a paleointensity estimate of 49.1 \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcT\n(Supplementary Table 3). Using a paleolatitude^24 of 45\u00b0N (Supplementary\nDiscussion\u2014Geologic context and prior work) a paleomagnetic dipole moment of\n8.04 \u00b1 0.40 \u00d7 10^22 A m^2 is calculated.\n\nThe Passo da Fabiana Gabbros occur as intrusions in the Dom Feliciano Belt of\nsouthern Brazil^14. Here we focus on a sample previously studied for\ngeochronology^14 (\u201cMaterials and methods\u201d, Supplementary Fig. 1b, c) for\nsingle crystal paleointensity analysis. Sample GPF-01 is a coarse-grained\ngabbro; U-Pb SHRIMP age data on zircons from sample GPF-01 yield an age^14 of\n591.2 \u00b1 3.5 Ma. We also investigated another gabbro (sample GPF-110) from the\nsame unit but collected from an outcrop ~1 km away for replication. K-T curves\nfor GPF-01 whole rock samples show the dominant presence of magnetite, along\nwith a FeTi phase (Supplementary Fig. 7a). For GPF-110, these data indicate\nmagnetite, but also a change near 320 \u00b0C characteristic of pyrrhotite^10\n(Supplementary Fig. 7b). Magnetic hysteresis data for groundmass samples of\nboth GPF-01 and GPF-110 show narrow loops reflecting relatively low coercive\nforce, remanent coercivity and squareness (\\\\(\\overline{{B}_{c}}\\\\) = 8.2 \u00b1\n4.1 mT, \\\\(\\overline{{B}_{cr}}\\\\) = 23.1 \u00b1 7.4 mT,\n\\\\(\\overline{{M}_{rs}/{M}_{s}}\\\\) = 0.13 \u00b1 0.08; Supplementary Table 4 and\nSupplementary Fig. 7c, d), consistent with pseudosingle domain and multidomain\ncarriers, whereas curves for clean feldspars from these rocks define broad\nopen loops (\\\\(\\overline{{B}_{c}}\\\\) = 52.8 \u00b1 6.6 mT,\n\\\\(\\overline{{B}_{cr}}\\\\) = 92.3 \u00b1 3.8 mT, \\\\(\\overline{{M}_{rs}/{M}_{s}}\\\\) =\n0.43 \u00b1 0.06) indicating single domain carriers (Fig. 2a and Supplementary\nFigs. 3b and 7e, f). FORC diagrams for single crystals show a narrow central\nridge (B_u = 0) typical of single domain grains (Fig. 2b and Supplementary\nFig. 8). SEM and EDS analyses define the presence of needle-like magnetic\ninclusions, \u2264200 nm in width with variable lengths up to several \u03bcm, with\nvarying Fe and Ti content (Fig. 2c, d). No SEM/EDS evidence for pyrrhotite is\nfound in the feldspar samples we analyzed.\n\nFig. 2: Rock magnetic, SEM, and paleointensity analysis of plagioclase\ncrystals from the Passo da Fabiana Gabbros.\n\na Magnetic hysteresis loop with images of the measured plagioclase crystal\n(lower right, scale bar 1 mm). b First order reversal curve (FORC) diagram for\nplagioclase crystal. c, d Backscatter SEM images of elongated magnetic\ninclusions observed in the plagioclase crystals (inset) and their\ncorresponding EDS spectra in 20 keV. EDS spots analyzed are marked as red\ncircles in the inset images. e, f NRM lost versus TRM gained (circles) and\npTRM checks (triangles). All labeled points are \u00b0C. Gray circles are steps\nused in fit (applied field B_lab and paleointensity value B_anc shown in lower\nleft). Insets: crystal measured shown in top center with 1 mm scale bar.\nOrthogonal vector plot of field-off steps is shown in upper right. Squares are\nvertical projection of the magnetization; circles are horizontal projection.\nTemperature ranges used in the paleointensity fit are shown in color.\n\nFull size image\n\nInitial SCP Thellier-Coe experiments with laser heating^11,21 indicated\nremanent fields only a fraction as strong as those preserved by the Bushveld\nplagioclase crystals, leading us to use lower applied fields (30, 15 and 7.5\n\u03bcT). Measurement of 29 crystals yielded 21 acceptable results (17 Type A, 4\nType B) with ChRMs and paleointensities isolated between 366 and 548 \u00b0C (Fig.\n2e, f; Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 5). Most results are from\nGPF-01, but 3 crystals from GPF-110 give comparable values (Supplementary\nDiscussion\u2014Applied field bias and recording replication, Supplementary Fig.\n10). The combined paleointensities obtained are 3.43 \u00b1 0.73, 2.31 \u00b1 0.40 and\n2.72 \u00b1 0.60 \u03bcT for 30, 15 and 7.5 \u03bcT applied fields, respectively. While there\nis no clear progression in the data, the mean of the value determined using a\n30 \u03bcT field is higher than that obtained at lower fields, hinting at an\napplied field bias^23. The average paleointensity from all these categories A\nand B samples using all applied field is 2.73 \u00b1 0.69 \u03bcT (n = 21). We use a\nfactor of 1.5 as a cooling rate correction (Supplementary\nDiscussion\u2014Paleointensity corrections (cooling rate and anisotropy), yielding\nan average paleointensity of 1.82 \u00b1 0.46 \u03bcT (n = 21).\n\nAnisotropy measurements and subsequent corrections reveal more clearly that\npaleointensity values obtained at 30 \u03bcT are higher than those obtained using\nlower applied fields (Supplementary Table 6). Accordingly, we select\npaleointensity and anisotropy data only from those experiments using applied\nfields of 15 and 7.5 \u03bcT. Applying both the cooling rate correction and\nanisotropy corrections (Supplementary Table 6) yields a paleointensity of 1.49\n\u00b1 0.10 \u03bcT. Using a paleolatitude of 42.2\u00b0S based on a pole position from the\nSierra de las \u00c1nimas complex (Uruguay)^25 (Supplementary Discussion\u2014Geologic\ncontext and prior work) the paleomagnetic dipole moment is 0.25 \u00b1 0.02 \u00d7 10^22\nA m^2.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe plagioclase studied from the Bushveld pyroxenite and Passo da Fabiana\nGabbros have ideal single domain magnetic behavior yet yield vastly different\nfield strengths. The Bushveld value extends the Archean period of high time-\naveraged field intensity into the Paleoproterozoic (Fig. 3). In stark\ncontrast, the Passo da Fabiana value is 30 times weaker, and the lowest time-\naveraged field strength known to date (Fig. 3a, b). When combined with the\nSept \u00celes 565 Ma paleomagnetic dipole moment^1, the data suggests the UL-TAFI\n(defined as fields equal to or less than 10% of the present-day) spanned at\nleast 26 million years. If the UL-TAFI is the nadir of the proposed much\nlonger-term decline of field strength preceding the onset of inner core\nnucleation^1,22 (Supplementary Discussion\u2014Long-term paleointensity history and\nICN, Fig. 3), the duration of low (defined here as equal to or less than 20%\nof the present-day) to ultra-low fields could have been >200 m.y.\n\nFig. 3: Paleointensity, oxygen and animal evolution.\n\na Field strength constrained from select Thellier (thermal) SCP studies (blue\nsquares, hexagons) and bulk rock studies (gray squares) updated from Zhou et\nal.^22, with new time-averaged SCP results (red hexagons) reported here.

Also\nshown are selenium isotopic data (open symbols) and oxygenation interpretation\nfrom Pogge von Strandmann et al.^20 (shown here with a 25 my window mean and\n1\u03c3 error), summary animal radiation of bilaterian and non-bilaterians from\nZhuravlev and Wood^65), Wood et al.^3, Darroch et al.^66 and Muscente et\nal.^67, and Shuram excursion ages from Rooney et al.^42.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe new data confirming and extending the UL-TAFI strengthen a potential\nlinkage with the Ediacaran evolution of macroscopic animals. While\nphylogenomic data indicate that the animal kingdom and many phyla may have\ndiverged prior to the Ediacaran Period^26,27, paleontological data show that\nthe diversification of macroscopic animals, as archived in the Avalon and\nWhite Sea assemblages of the Ediacara Fauna, began at ~575 Ma and reached a\nclimax at ~565 Ma^28,29,30,31,32, in a striking temporal correlation with the\nUL-TAFI (Fig. 3b). Prior explanations for the appearance of the Ediacara Fauna\nand the Cambrian radiation have centered on genetic, ecological, or\nenvironmental driving factors^33. The temporal coincidence between the UL-TAFI\nand the rise of the Ediacara Fauna, however, invites a refocus on\nenvironmental factors, particularly atmospheric and oceanic oxygenation\nevents.\n\nOxygen has long been identified as a key \u201cenvironmental gatekeeper\u201d^34,\nallowing for evolutionary innovation and for meeting the energy demands of\nanimals^35. Although sponges and microscopic animals can survive at low levels\nof dissolved oxygen (as low as ~1.5 \u03bcM, equivalent to 0.5% present atmospheric\nlevel [PAL]^36,37), macroscopic, morphologically complex, and mobile animals\nrequire a greater amount of oxygen to support their metabolic demands^38. A\ncomplex animal ecosystem involving long food chains and predators requires\nstill greater amounts of oxygen, as indicated by the exclusion of such complex\necosystems from the modern oxygen minimum zone^39, which is characterized by\ndissolved O_2 levels of <20\u201330 \u03bcM or <10% PAL. In this regard, it is important\nto note that mobile animals and macroscopic animals up to decimeters in size\nhave been recorded in the ~565 Ma White Sea assemblage of the Ediacara\nbiota^40,41.\n\nMultiple lines of geochemical evidence point to a possible increase in\natmospheric and oceanic O_2 levels in the late Ediacaran Period, specifically\nin the period of ~575\u2013565 Ma characterized by negative \u03b4^13C values of the\nShuram excursion^42 (Fig. 3b). These include elevated \u03b4^88Mo and \u03b4^82/76Se\nvalues, as well as [Mo], [U], and [V] concentrations in organic-rich shales\ndeposited approximately at 565 \u00b1 5 Ma and thus coincident with the\ndiversification of macroscopic animals in the White Sea assemblage of the\nEdiacara biota^20,43. Importantly, \u03b4^238U data of carbonate rocks, as well as\n\u0394\\\\({}^{{\\prime} 17}\\\\)O-\u03b4^34S-\u03b4^18O of carbonate-associated sulfate, point to\nmultimillion years of oceanic oxygenation that temporally coincide with the\nShuram excursion and the Avalon-White Sea assemblages^44,45,46. We note that\nthere is much uncertainty and controversy with the regard of the magnitude of\nthis oxygenation event^47,48, partly because different geochemical proxies\nhave different sensitivities and hence sometimes give apparently conflicting\ninferences about oxygen levels. Such uncertainty is further complicated by the\ndynamic nature of oceanic redox history and spatial heterogeneity of oceanic\nredox conditions in the late Ediacaran Period^49,50,51. However, the\nconcurrence of these independent indicators of oxygenation, paleontological\nrecords documenting the rise of the Ediacara Fauna, and paleomagnetic data\ndefining the UL-TAFI merits further exploration for potential linkages.\n\nHydrogen (H) can escape to space by thermal and non-thermal mechanisms\nresulting in net oxygenation of the atmosphere^52. Changes in climate and/or\nmethane release recorded by Ediacaran isotopic records, including the Shuram\nexcursion^42,53 (Fig. 3b), could have led to conditions favoring H loss, but\nthese interpretations are debated^54 (Supplementary Discussion\u2014Oxygenation,\nEdiacaran climate and methane). Here we focus on the potential influence of\nthe UL-TAFI on H loss through changes in the paleomagnetosphere.\n\nUsing solar wind evolution models based on solar analogs^15, steady-state\nmagnetopause stand-off distances would have been <4.5 Earth radii (r_\u2295) at 565\nMa^1 and <4.2r_\u2295 at 591 Ma, compared to the present-day value of ~10.7r_\u2295.\nDuring extreme coronal mass ejection events, stand-off distances could have\nbeen as low as 1.6r_\u2295. These smaller standoff distances can lead to more\nhydrogen escape because they increase the polar cap area of open field\nlines^16 where non-thermal H^+ loss occurs today. The steady-state polar cap\narea of open field lines would have been 3.5 times greater at 591 Ma, and even\ngreater during coronal mass ejection events impacting Earth (Supplementary\nDiscussion\u2014Magnetopause standoff, hydrogen loss and hydrogen supply).\nMoreover, at the reduced stand-off distances implied by our data, the\nmagnetopause will approach, and even fall below Earth\u2019s plasmapause^16,55,\nbelow which plasma density, dominated by H^+, markedly increases\n(Supplementary Discussion\u2014Magnetopause standoff, hydrogen loss and hydrogen\nsupply). In this case, increased global loss of H^+ is expected. Greater\nglobal non-thermal H loss is also predicted for the much smaller magnetosphere\nresulting from the UL-TAFI because the solar wind has greater access to a\nhigher density of H atoms (Supplementary Discussion\u2014Magnetopause standoff,\nhydrogen loss and hydrogen supply).\n\nQuantifying H loss for Earth with an ultra-low field is challenging as it is\nobservationally inaccessible. The few available models predict greater H\nloss^56, but the predicted change vary depending on assumptions (~30% to 10\ntimes). The highest estimates could result in a few percent change of oxygen\n(PAL) that might represent a perturbation or crossing of a threshold, allowing\nEdiacaran animal diversification (Supplementary Discussion\u2014Magnetopause\nstandoff, hydrogen loss and hydrogen supply), but it should be noted that none\nof these nascent models consider all of the processes discussed above.\n\nAn effect that also warrants further consideration is that with decreased\nmagnetopause standoff, greater penetration of highly energetic protons is\nexpected over a larger solid angle, resulting in the formation of NO_x\ncompounds which can create ozone holes^57. With the greater UV flux\n(Supplementary Discussion\u2014Magnetopause standoff, hydrogen loss and hydrogen\nsupply), dissociation of water vapor^58 is expected, increasing the supply of\nH moving upward. Thus, the UL-TAFI could have led to both an increased supply\nof H available for loss, and an increased outflow.\n\nEnhanced H loss from the magnetosphere could have acted over tens or hundreds\nof millions of years when the geomagnetic field was at low to ultra-low\nstrengths (Fig. 3). The multiple pathways discussed above provide a framework\nfor future studies quantifying hydrogen loss, oxygenation of the atmosphere\nand the potential consequences on the evolution of complex animals highlighted\nby the synchroneity of these phenomena and the near collapse of the geodynamo.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nSamples were collected from the Rustenberg Layered Intrusion of the Bushveld\nComplex, South Africa, at 25\u00b0 33.812\u2019 S, 27\u00b0 32.480\u2019 E and from the Passo da\nFabiana Gabbros at 31\u00b0 38.391\u2019 S, 53\u00b0 22.172\u2019 W (GPF-01) and 31\u00b0 37.893\u2019 S,\n53\u00b0 21.815\u2019 W (GPF-110). The Rustenberg samples were collected as unoriented\nhand samples from a quarry exposure ensuring the study of fresh material,\nwhereas the Passo da Fabiana samples are unoriented splits of larger samples\nused in prior petrological, geochemical and geochronological studies^14\nensuring both the study of fresh material and an exact correspondence of age\nconstraints. Rock preparation, rock magnetic and paleointensity analyses were\ndone in the paleomagnetic laboratories at the University of Rochester, and\nsupplemented with select magnetic susceptibility measurements of Passo da\nFabiana samples at Michigan Tech. Unoriented single plagioclase crystals were\npicked by hand from rock crushes. Grains selected for magnetic hysteresis and\npaleointensity measurements are free of visible inclusions when viewed under\n\u00d710 magnification. We used a Geofyzika KLY-4C KappaBridge for the bulk-rock\nmagnetic susceptibility measurements in air at the University of Rochester and\na AGICO MFK1-FA (in air) at Michigan Tech. A Princeton Measurements\nCorporation Alternating Gradient Force Magnetometer was used for magnetic\nhysteresis measurements. First order reversal curves data^59 were processed by\nFORCinel and VARIFORC software^60,61. SEM observation and energy-dispersive\nX-ray spectroscopy analyses used a Zeiss Auriga Scanning Electron Microscope,\nin the Integrated Nanosystems Center at the University of Rochester.\n\nPlagioclase grains selected for paleointensity analyses have NRM moments\ngreater than 1 \u00d7 10^\u221210 A m^2. For the Thellier-Coe paleointensity\nexperiments, samples were mounted on quartz holders having moments \u22641 \u00d7 10^\u221212\nA m^2, and measured using a 2G Enterprises 755 3-component DC SQUID\nmagnetometer with high resolution sensing coils housed in a magnetically\nshielded room with ambient field <200 nT at the University of Rochester. The\nnon-magnetic purity of mounting material (sodium silicate) has been confirmed\nby SQUID microscope analyses^62. Samples were heated using Synrad v20 and v40\nCO_2 lasers calibrated using optical pyrometers^63.\n\nPaleointensity selection criteria are as follows: Category A samples, (1) the\nnatural remanent magnetization (NRM) versus TRM slope must include at least\nfour steps; (2) the R^2 of the NRM/TRM slope fit must be greater than 0.9; (3)\nthe field-off NRM values must trend to the origin of the orthogonal vector\nplots with a maximum angular dispersion \u226410\u00b0; and (4) at least three\ntemperature steps of pTRM checks must be included and the values must be\nwithin 15%. Category B samples meet Category A criteria with only one\ncriterion relaxed (Supplementary Tables 2 and 5).\n\nMeasurement of TRM anisotropy^64 follow the procedures described in Bono et\nal.^1. The sample was first heated to an intermediate unblocking temperature\nwithout an applied field. Next, the sample was heated to the same temperature\nstep in a 7.5, 15, 30 or 60 \u03bcT magnetic field along six orthogonal axes (+Z,\n\u2212Z, +X, \u2212X, +Y, and \u2212Y). The magnetization of the sample was measured after\neach field-on heating. A multidomain tail check was performed after the six\nfield-on steps to test for alteration.\n\n## Data availability\n\nMagnetic datasets generated during and/or analyzed in this study are available\nin the MagIC repository, http://earthref.org/MagIC/19610.
