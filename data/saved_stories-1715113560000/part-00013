interconnect with patch cables to make a variety of\ndifferent logic circuits. You can enter inputs using switches, and display the\noutputs on five coloured LEDs. It's ideal for experimenting with and learning\nabout logic:\n\nLogic Lab allows you to experiment with logic gates by interconnecting them\nwith patch cables.\n\nThis new version of the Logic Lab is identical in operation to the original,\nbut is implemented using discrete \"1G\" CMOS logic gates; the original\nimplemented the logic using an AVR microprocessor. It is intended for people\nwho were discouraged from building the original circuit because of the need to\nprogram an AVR microcontroller, and it also involves easier surface-mount\nsoldering.\n\nThe original Logic Lab article included nine logic problems. Since then I've\ndevised five more problems, a logic game, and a logic puzzle; these are all\nincluded below. The answers will be given in a later article.\n\n### Introduction\n\nWhen I designed the original Logic Lab I decided it would be more flexible to\nsimulate the logic functions using a microcontroller, because it would give\nyou the option of reconfiguring the selection of gates it provides. I also\nthought this approach would be cheaper than using 12 discrete gate packages.\nHowever, so far I haven't needed to take advantage of the potential\nconfigurability.\n\nAlso, some reviewers criticised the original design because it isn't using\nactual logic gates; it is just simulating their behaviour, which is\neducationally less useful; and to some extent I sympathise with this view.\n\nI therefore decided that it would be interesting to design an alternative\nversion of the Logic Lab based on 1G logic gates, which are individual gates\nin a small surface-mount 5-pin package, available for a few pence/cents each.\n\n### Description\n\nThe Logic Lab 1G has the following features, which are identical to the\noriginal:\n\n  * 12 logic gates: two AND, two NAND, two OR, two NOR, two XOR, and two inverters.\n  * Four switches, S1 to S4, with LEDs to show the status, that can provide logic inputs to the gates.\n  * Five coloured LEDs, L1 to L5, that can display the state of the output from a logic circuit. The top three are red, orange, and green, allowing simulation of traffic lights. The other two are blue and yellow.\n  * Two busses, J1 and J2, that can be used to link patch cables together.\n  * It is powered by two AAA batteries, with an on/off switch and power indicator LED.\n  * The inputs and outputs are connected to header pins, so you can interconnect them with a set of patch cables terminated in header sockets.\n\nThe Logic Lab 1G has the following improvements over the original:\n\n  * I've redesigned it so you can either use slide switches, as on the original, or miniature toggle switches with the same pin spacing.\n  * In the original Logic Lab, if you connected all five LEDs to a single output the blue LED would be hardly visible, because of its higher forward voltage. I've solved this problem in the current design by buffering each LED.\n\nThe front panel of the Logic Lab 1G.\n\n#### The logic gates\n\nHere's a simple explanation of the six different types of logic gate in the\nLogic Lab:\n\nThe output is '1' only if both inputs are '1'.| The output is '1' if either\ninput is '1'.| The output is '1' if either input is '1', but not both.  \n---|---|---  \nThe output is '0' only if both inputs are '1'.| The output is '0' if either\ninput is '1'.| The output is the inverse of the input.  \n  \n### Logic problems\n\nHere are 14 sample logic problems to illustrate applications of the Logic Lab.\nEach problem has an approximate percentage difficulty rating, and they are\narranged in increasing order of difficulty. Nine of these problems were given\nin the original article, and I've added five new problems.\n\n#### Universal 1-input logic gate (10%)\n\nDesign a universal 1-input gate which can act either as a non-inverting\nbuffer, or as a NOT gate (inverter), depending on the input S3:\n\n#### Traffic lights (15%)\n\nTraffic lights (in the UK) go through the following sequence:\n\nS1| S2| Lights  \n---|---|---  \n0| 0| Red  \n0| 1| Red and Orange  \n1| 0| Green  \n1| 1| Orange  \n  \nDesign a logic circuit that lights the red, orange, and green LEDs according\nto that sequence of switches.\n\n#### Exclusive-OR (25%)\n\nTwo of the gates in the logic lab are exclusive-OR, or XOR, gates; their\noutput is '1' if either of the inputs is '1', but not both.\n\nDesign an exclusive-OR gate without using the XOR gates, by using a\ncombination of the other gates in the Logic Lab.\n\n#### 2-bit comparator (25%)\n\nDesign a logic circuit that compares two 2-bit binary numbers: A on S1 and S2,\nand B on S3 and S4. If A and B are equal the green LED L3 should light up.\n\n#### Safety switch (35%)\n\nA school has a fire warning light that lights up in every classroom. To avoid\nit being accidentally switched on it has four switches, all of which need to\nbe turned on before the warning will light up.\n\nDesign a logic circuit that implements this: the red LED, representing the\nwarning, should only turn on if all switches are set to '1'.\n\n#### Palindrome checker (35%)\n\nDesign a circuit that lights the green LED if the four switches are set to a\nbinary number that's a palindrome, such as '1001', and the red LED if it's not\na palindrome, like '1011'.\n\n#### Hotel light switches (40%)\n\nIn a hotel four rooms are on the same corridor, and there's one light in the\nmiddle of the corridor. There's a switch outside each room that can be used to\ncontrol the light.\n\nDesign a circuit that allows each of the four switches S1 to S4 to turn the\nlight L5 on or off.\n\n#### Binary decoder (40%)\n\nDesign a circuit that lights up just one of the four LEDs L1 to L4 for each of\nthe different possible settings of switches S1 and S2:\n\nS1| S2| Lights  \n---|---|---  \n0| 0| Red  \n0| 1| Orange  \n1| 0| Green  \n1| 1| Blue  \n  \n#### Universal 2-input logic gate (50%)\n\nDesign a universal 2-input gate that can be configured to act as one of the\nfour possible gates AND, NAND, NOR, and OR with each of the possible settings\nof S3 and S4:\n\n#### Level meter (50%)\n\nA digital level meter works by lighting up a row of LEDs to show the sound\nlevel.\n\nDesign a logic circuit that lights a row of between 0 and 5 of the LEDs L1 to\nL5 depending on whether the binary number on the inputs S1 to S3 is from 000\n(binary 0) to 101 (binary 5) respectively:\n\nS1| S2| S3| Lights  \n---|---|---|---  \n0| 0| 0| . . . . .  \n0| 0| 1| * . . . .  \n0| 1| 0| * * . . .  \n0| 1| 1| * * * . .  \n1| 0| 0| * * * * .  \n1| 0| 1| * * * * *  \n  \n#### Majority vote (60%)\n\nWhen the secret spy club needs to vote on an issue, the three members each\nhave a button that they press to register their vote. If there is a majority\nvote, the issue is passed.\n\nUse three switches to represent the votes, and design a circuit that will\nlight the green LED if the majority vote '1', or the red LED if they don't.\n\n#### Combination switch (70%)\n\nYou have a drawer with an electronic lock, and it can only be opened if you\nset the correct passcode on four switches. Design a logic circuit that allows\nyou to choose any of the 16 possible passcodes, such as '1011', by changing\nthe position of four patch leads. The circuit should then only light up the\ngreen LED if you set the correct passcode on the switches.\n\n#### Binary adder (75%)\n\nDesign a circuit that will add together two 2-digit binary numbers, and put\nthe answer in binary on the three LEDs L3 to L5.\n\nThe first number should be on S1 (high bit) and S2 (low bit), and the second\nnumber should be on S3 (high bit) and S4 (low bit). The answer should be on L3\n(high bit), L4 (middle bit), and L5 (low bit).\n\n#### 2-bit magnitude comparator (90%)\n\nDesign a logic circuit that compares two 2-bit binary numbers: A on S1 and S2,\nand B on S3 and S4. If the number A is greater than B the red LED L1 should\nlight up, if A is equal to B the orange LED L2 should light up, and if A is\nless than B the green LED L3 should light up.\n\nThis is the hardest of the Logic Lab problems, and it's made harder by the\nconstraints of the gates available in Logic Lab, but it is possible!\n\n### Logic game\n\nAs an example of another application, here\u2019s a logic game you can play on the\nLogic Lab.\n\nOne player wires up four gates of their choice in the following configuration:\n\nThey then cover the wiring with a cloth, and the other player has to work out\nwhat the the four gates were, and what the whole function is equivalent to.\n\nTo make it harder you can leave out the intermediate lights L1, L2, and L3.\n\nAs an example, what is the function of this combination of gates?\n\n### A logic puzzle\n\nFinally, here's a logic puzzle based on Logic Lab.\n\nStart with all four switches at \u20180\u2019. Then find the shortest sequence of switch\nsettings that gets the yellow LED to light up.\n\nOnce you've solved it, can you figure out how the circuit works?\n\n### The circuit\n\nHere's the full circuit of Logic Lab 1G:\n\nThe circuit of the Logic Lab 1G logic gates, which use 12 74HC1G-series logic\ngate packages.\n\nThe circuit of the Logic Lab 1G input switches, output LEDs, power supply,\nbusses, and decoupling circuits.\n\nClick to open a larger version of either circuit in a new window.\n\nThe circuit uses two of each of the six logic gate types: AND, NAND, OR, NOR,\nXOR, and inverter. It also uses five inverters to buffer the output LEDs. The\nPCB is designed so you can use NAND or NOR gates in place of the inverters if\nthis makes ordering the parts easier.\n\n#### Understanding the logic gate families\n\nThe single-gate families from different manufacturers are confusingly named,\nmaking it easy to accidentally order the wrong part.\n\nFirst of all, there are several ranges of logic which differ by voltage range\nand speed. I recommend the LVC range, which is rated for 1.65 to 5.5V, or the\nHC range, which is rated for 2.0V to 6.0V.\n\nA second source of confusion is that the single-gate devices are available in\nseveral different packages. The Logic Lab PCB is designed for five-pin\npackages with a 0.95mm pin spacing, and manufacturers have chosen to call this\npackage by different names ^[1]; they are variously referred to as SOT753,\nSC-74A, SC59, SOT23, SOT235, SOT25, MO178, and TSOP5, but they are all\nsuitable.\n\nNote that some parts have an extra 'T' in the name; these have TTL voltage\nlevels, and are not suitable. Also, the smaller packages with 0.65mm pin\nspacing have very similar names, such as TSSOP5, SOT323, SOT353, SC70, SC88A,\nand SC705, but these will not fit on this board.\n\n#### Header pins\n\nI used 0.1\" pitch header pins for the inputs and outputs, and patch leads\nterminated in header sockets. The advantage of this is that you can buy the\nheader pins in long strips, and then cut them down to the lengths you need;\nthe header sockets are more difficult to divide up.\n\n#### LEDs\n\nThe five output LEDs are 5mm diffused through-hole LEDs in five different\ncolours, and these can be any colour as they are buffered to avoid problems\ndue to different forward voltages. The other LEDs and resistors are 0805 size\nSMD types.\n\n#### Switches\n\nThe inputs to the logic circuits are provided by four input switches, S1 to\nS4. These can either be slide switches as on the original Logic Lab ^[2], or\nthe new PCB will also support miniature PCB-mounting toggle switches.\n\nWhichever switches you choose, they should have a terminal spacing of 0.1\"\n(2.5mm) to fit the PCB. Note that standard toggle switches with 4.7mm terminal\nspacing are not suitable.\n\nHere are some suitable alternatives for the toggle switches:\n\n  * Multicomp MC2MS1T2B2M2RE ^[3].\n  * Multicomp Pro 2MS1T2B2M2RE ^[4].\n  * Dailywell 2MS1T2B2M2RES ^[5].\n\nBecause toggle switches operate in the opposite direction from slide switches,\nthe PCB provides a way of swapping the configuration to cater for either by\nfitting two 0\u03a9 resistors in one of two possible configurations:\n\nToggle switches| Slide switches  \n---|---  \n  \n#### Power\n\nThe circuit is powered by two 1.5V AAA batteries in series, mounted in\nthrough-hole battery clips on the back of the board; see the parts list.\nAlternatively you could use two PCB-mount AAA battery holders ^[6] which fit\nin the same mounting holes.\n\nFor the power switch you can again either use a toggle switch or a slide\nswitch; fit a 0\u03a9 resistor in the R55 position for a toggle switch, or in the\nR56 position for a slide switch.\n\n#### Short-circuit protection\n\nThe board includes 100\u03a9 current limiting resistors on every output, so if the\nuser inadvertently connects together two outputs at different logic levels,\nthe current will be 3/(100 + 100) or 15mA, which is within the 24mA per output\ndrive given on the logic gates data sheet.\n\n#### Unconnected inputs\n\nUnconnected inputs are treated as being at logic-level '0'. This is\nimplemented by a pull-down resistor on each input. The resistor can be between\n10k\u03a9 and 33k\u03a9.\n\n#### Patch leads\n\nTo use Logic Lab you'll need a set of at least 20 jumper wires terminated in\nheader sockets. I recommend 150mm or 200mm long cables; here are some\nsuggestions:\n\n  * The cheapest option is a ribbon cable that you can separate to create a set of jumper wires from Adafruit ^[7] or The Pi Hut in the UK ^[8].\n  * More convenient are separate jumper wires from The Pi Hut ^[9].\n  * The nicest but most expensive are silicone jumper wires from Adafruit ^[10] or The Pi Hut in the UK ^[11].\n\nHere's the full parts list (click to expand):\n\n#### \u25ba Parts list\n\nQty| Item| Value| Size| Typical parts  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n3| Ceramic capacitors| 0.1\u03bcF| 0805| Yageo CC0805KRX7R8BB104  \n16| Resistors| 100\u03a9| 0805| Yageo RC0805JR-07100RL  \n5| Resistors| 220\u03a9| 0805| Yageo RC0805JR-07220RL  \n1| Resistor| 470\u03a9| 0805| Yageo RC0805JR-07470RL  \n5| Resistors| 1k\u03a9| 0805| Yageo RC0805JR-071KL  \n22| Resistors| 33k\u03a9| 0805| Yageo RC0805JR-0733KL  \n5| LEDs| White| 0805| White 0805 Surface Mount LED  \n1| LED| Diffused red| 5mm through-hole| 5mm round diffused LEDs  \n1| LED| Diffused orange| 5mm through-hole| 5mm round diffused LEDs  \n1| LED| Diffused green| 5mm through-hole| 5mm round diffused LEDs  \n1| LED| Diffused blue| 5mm through-hole| 5mm round diffused LEDs  \n1| LED| Diffused yellow| 5mm through-hole| 5mm round diffused LEDs  \n5| Slide/Toggle switches| SPDT (non-shorting)| 0.1\" through-hole| See text  \n2| AND Gates| 74LVC1G08| SC-74A| Nexperia 74LVC1G08GV,125  \n2| NAND Gates| 74LVC1G00| SC-74A| Nexperia 74LVC1G00GV,125  \n2| OR Gates| 74LVC1G32| SC-74A| Nexperia 74LVC1G32GV,125  \n2| NOR Gates| 74LVC1G02| SC-74A| Nexperia 74LVC1G02GV,125  \n2| XOR Gates| 74LVC1G86| SC-74A| Nexperia 74LVC1G86GV,125  \n7| Inverters| 74LVC1G04| SC-74A| Nexperia 74LVC1G04GV,125  \n1| Schottky diode| B340A| SMA| B340A Schottky Rectifier  \n16| Header pin strips| 1X3| 0.1\" through-hole  \n22| Header pins| 1X1| 0.1\" through-hole  \n2| Header pin strips| 1X4| 0.1\" through-hole  \n4| Battery Clips| AAA| Through-hole| AAA PCB Snap-In Battery Clip  \n1| PCB| Double-sided| 139.7 x 91.4mm  \n1| Back cover| Acrylic| 139.7 x 91.4mm| 2mm thick  \n20| Patch cables| Socket to socket| 150mm or 200mm| Premium Jumper Wires  \n  \n### Construction\n\nI designed a PCB in Eagle and ordered boards from Elecrow ^[12]. The board is\n100 x 140mm, using a double-sided PCB. There are almost no tracks on the top\nof the board so you could probably redesign it to use a single-sided PCB. I\nalso created a design for a back panel and ordered this in 2mm thick\ntransparent acrylic ^[13]. I give links at the end of the article so you can\norder your own boards.\n\nFor the SMD components I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun set to 300\u00b0C.\n\nWhen fitting the header pins I did them a column at a time, and found it\nhelpful to push them into something like a 1x36 header socket ^[14], to keep\nthem correctly aligned and vertical.\n\nFor the gate outputs cut the header pins into rows of three pins with a sharp\nblade. A trick I found for the gate inputs was to cut a row of five pins and\npull out the middle three pins with a pair of pliers. This gives a stronger\nresult than using individual pins, and is easier to solder in position.\n\n#### Battery holders\n\nYou can either use individual battery clips, or PCB-mount AAA battery holders\n^[15].\n\nThe back of the Logic Lab 1G, showing the components and batteries.\n\nThe back is protected by a transparent acrylic back panel, mounted using M3\n15mm nylon pillars ^[16] and M3 6mm nylon screws ^[17].\n\n### Resources\n\nGet the Eagle files or Gerber files for the PCB on GitHub here:\nhttps://github.com/technoblogy/logic-lab-1g.\n\n  1. ^ AN10161 PicoGate Logic footprints on NXP.com.\n  2. ^ SPDT Slide Switch\n  3. ^ Switch, PCB SPDT Vertical - MC2MS1T2B2M2RE on CPC Farnell.\n  4. ^ MULTICOMP PRO 2MS1T2B2M2RE on Farnell.\n  5. ^ Dailywell 2MS1T2B2M2RES on Mouser.\n  6. ^ AAA x 1 Battery Holder PCB Mount on Switch Electronics.\n  7. ^ Premium Female/Female Jumper Wires on Adafruit.\n  8. ^ Premium Female/Female Jumper Wires on The Pi Hut.\n  9. ^ Jumper Wires 10pk (Female/Female) on The Pi Hut.\n  10. ^ Premium Silicone Covered Female-Female Jumper Wires on Adafruit.\n  11. ^ Premium Silicone Covered Female-Female Jumper Wires on The Pi Hut.\n  12. ^ PCB Fab on Elecrow.\n  13. ^ Acrylic Laser Cutting on Elecrow.\n  14. ^ 36-pin 0.1\" Female header on The Pi Hut.\n  15. ^ AAA x 1 Battery Holder PCB Mount on Switch Electronics.\n  16. ^ 15mm nylon pillars on Switch Electronics.\n  17. ^ M3 x 6mm nylon screws on Switch Electronics.\n\nPrevious: Secret Maze 2\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014-2023 David Johnson-Davies\n\n", "frontpage": false}
