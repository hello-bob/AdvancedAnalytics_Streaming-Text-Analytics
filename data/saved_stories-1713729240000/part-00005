Scientists studying\ncritically endangered lemurs in Madagascar confronted this difficult reality\nwhen they witnessed attacks on lemurs by another vulnerable species, a\ncarnivore called a fosa.\n\nA diademed sifaka (Photo: Onja Ramilijaona)\n\nThis dynamic can be particularly complex when the predation occurs in an\nisolated or poor-quality habitat, according to research from Washington\nUniversity in St. Louis and the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar.\n\nIn the new paper published in Ecology & Evolution, researchers describe how\nthey were observing small groups of critically endangered diademed sifaka\nlemurs (Propithecus diadema) at Betampona Strict Nature Reserve when the\npredator struck.\n\n\u201cWe were conducting our daily behavioral observations when we came across a\nvery unusual sight \u2014 a predation attempt by a fosa, which is the biggest\npredator in Madagascar,\u201d said WashU\u2019s Giovanna Bonadonna, a postdoctoral\nresearch associate in biological anthropology in Arts & Sciences and the\nstudy\u2019s co-first author.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw was very rare,\u201d Bondadonna said. \u201cThere are other small\ncarnivores in Madagascar, but they are not big enough to be able to prey upon\nan adult diademed sifaka because they are among the biggest lemurs. There are\nnot so many predators that could actually get them.\u201d\n\nGiovanna Bonadonna and Onja Ramilijaona in Madagascar.

They are great climbers and are sometimes compared to\nsmall cougars, though they are actually part of the weasel family.\n\nThe fosa is categorized as vulnerable by the International Union for\nConservation of Nature and Natural Resources, and is at risk of extinction, as\nare almost all of its lemur prey. Fosas also eat other small animals such as\nbirds and rodents.\n\nBut they\u2019re rarely caught in the act. Fosas are stealthy hunters. Researchers\nhave mostly determined what fosas eat by examining bones and other evidence\nleft behind in scat.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that a female diademed sifaka that we were following after the\nfirst attack didn\u2019t run away very far,\u201d said Onja Ramilijaona, a PhD candidate\nat the University of Antananarivo and the other co-first author of the paper.\n\u201cInstead she stayed still and remained vigilant, looking at the fosa.\u201d\n\nRamilijaona also documented the later discovery of the remains of another\ndiademed sifaka, presumed to have been killed by a fosa because of the\ncondition of the remains and because of the way that branches had been broken\nin the area. Signs indicated a struggle in the trees.\n\nThe researchers also described other instances over a period of 19 months of\nobservation when fosas appeared to stalk lemurs but were unsuccessful in\nbringing one down as food.\n\n1 of 3\n\nThe fosa is an elusive predator that is very good at climbing.

While the land itself is\nprotected, this forest\u2019s relatively small size and isolation mean that it can\nbe difficult for plants and animals to continue to breed and survive at\nBetampona.\n\n\u201cAlthough Betampona is one of the best protected reserves in Madagascar, its\nisolation from other viable forests with lemur populations has created a\npredicament in which the critically endangered lemurs cannot engage in typical\ndispersal patterns, leading to genetic and demographic isolation,\u201d said Lisa\nKelley, executive director of the Saint Louis Zoo Wildcare Institute. \u201cThe\nneed to study these populations for a possible genetic management study became\nclear several years back, once there were indications that there were few\ninfant births and even fewer infant survivals.\u201d\n\nThe impact of predation \u2014 combined with low reproductive rates and potentially\nhigh inbreeding of the lemur population of Betampona \u2014 could affect the\nsurvival of this species at this site. (Photo: Onja Ramilijaona)\n\nThe Saint Louis Zoo and the Missouri Botanical Garden have conducted work at\nBetampona since the 1980s with the Madagascar Flora and Fauna Group, an\ninternational nonprofit, non-governmental organization that enables\ninstitutions to collaborate for the united purpose of conserving Madagascar\u2019s\nbiodiversity. Washington University, the Saint Louis Zoo and the Missouri\nBotanical Garden are also partners in the Living Earth Collaborative. This\nparticular effort is part of a larger project in Madagascar made possible with\nfunding from the Living Earth Collaborative and the Eric P. and Evelyn E.\nNewman Charitable Foundation.\n\n\u201cThese most recent observations of fosa attacks are especially troubling, as\nthe observation of predation attacks, especially by the elusive fosa, are very\nrare,\u201d Kelley said.\n\n\u201cIt leads to questions of why the fosa are so bold to predate on lemurs in\nfront of humans, and whether the fosa leave Betampona to hunt elsewhere and\nthen return, or whether they are targeting the lemurs within the reserve,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cIt is an incredible scenario in which you have a vulnerable species\npotentially over-predating on several critically endangered species.\u201d\n\nSenior authors on the study include Krista Milich and Emily Wroblewski, both\nassistant professors in the Department of Anthropology in Arts & Sciences at\nWashington University.\n\n\u201cThis population of diademed sifakas is already in bad shape,\u201d Bonadonna said.\n\u201cThere is a huge predation pressure that was underestimated until we did this\nbehavioral study. We were able to highlight inbreeding and other factors that\nmay be behind the fact that this population cannot thrive at Betampona.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the fosa is the bad guy,\u201d Bonadonna said. \u201cIt\u2019s also in need of\nconservation. This study really highlights how complicated it can be. Human\nactivities lead to changes in dynamics within ecosystems, having cascading\neffects beyond even what people realize. Despite the effort to conserve one\nspecies, it\u2019s really the ecosystem and the balance of that ecosystem that is\nat stake once the habitat is compromised.\u201d\n\nSHARE Media Contact Talia Ogliore\n\n###### Topics\n\nAnthropology & Archaeology\n\nClimate & Environment\n\nHumanities & Society\n\n###### Schools\n\nArts & Sciences\n\nRead more stories from Arts & Sciences\n\nVisit Arts & Sciences\n\nLeave a Comment\n\n    \n\nComments and respectful dialogue are encouraged, but content will be\nmoderated.
