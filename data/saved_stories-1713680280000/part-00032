I hope this all-out disclosure\nwill help you in your adventures.\n\nStarting the fourth year of CrowdSec, I feel it\u2019s time to explain our business\nmodel in detail for several reasons. First and foremost, to avoid unnecessary\nfear among the community members and, second, to reassure our clients and\ninvestors that a free product and a commercial offering can peacefully\ncoexist.\n\nAligning the interests of our community, our investors, and our clients was\npossible, yet it required quite some work and sweat.\n\nOne concern is that a free product is structurally eating its paid version and\nwill become too limited to avoid this cannibalism. Another comes from the\nclassical \u201cif it\u2019s free, you\u2019re the product.\u201d Finally, both worlds, the\nbusiness one and the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) one, wonder if that\ncore component will be maintained over time, nesting deeply in their system.\nThe FOSS community thinks \u201ctoo good to stay free; they will have to monetize\nonce they reach a certain size,\u201d and the business thinks, \u201cFOSS is great, but\npeople need to eat, the project will eventually run out of funds, and\ndeprecate, it\u2019s a production risk\u201d.\n\nThis is a delicate balance to strike, whatever model you\u2019re embracing \u2014 FOSS,\nOpenCore, or Commercial and Open Source Software (COSS). We have seen many\ncompanies having trouble on those fronts lately and being forced to change\ntheir stance, with severe consequences for their ecosystems.\n\nIn enterprise-grade software, there are ten wrong reasons to embrace FOSS\nlicensing and very few fundamentally good ones, leading many projects to\npivot. The industry is riddled with FOSS companies forced to move from\ndatabase systems to OS or cloud stacks. Another issue is the companies trying\nto have a premium model based on features, relying on an open core. If your\nfeature is good, it should be in the product, and if not, your community is\nentitled to develop it by themselves, sometimes competing with your own.\n\nOpen source is the digital twin of fair trade. You offer something openly,\ntransparently, and without second thoughts, but you also clearly express what\nyou expect in return. In the case of CrowdSec, we choose to edit, maintain,\nand give away a great piece of software, and in return, we get signals. We\nalso hold the rights to create premium offerings and functionalities, which\nmake sense only if you use the software on an enterprise level and want extra\nbells and whistles.\n\nBut it\u2019s not our first FOSS dance with Thibault (our CTO), and we chose our\nmodel with precautions, leading to months of careful evaluation of options\nbefore launching our company. For the record, I publish some FOSS content, but\nI\u2019m not a FOSS monk, preaching that everything should be FOSS and that no\nother model should exist. I\u2019m a pragmatic entrepreneur, and so is our crew,\nwhich, as we\u2019ll see, is the best insurance that we\u2019ll maintain the engine free\novertime and the business afloat.\n\n## Why choose a FOSS license?\n\nTo tip the balance of cybercrime, we needed to create the largest-ever CTI\nnetwork. To do so, we wanted to reduce friction to adoption to its minimum.\nMoney being the mother of all frictions, the tool needed to be free. Thibault\nand his team also worked a lot on ease of use, documentation, one-line\ninstalls, distribution, good default settings, and visualization since they\nalso can be sources of friction.\n\nWe also wanted users to be able to adapt it to their context and knew for a\nfact that we couldn\u2019t cover all possible combinations of logs, hardware,\nsoftware, and everything in between by ourselves, so open source was a logical\npath.\n\nFree, open, well, FOSS it is then.\n\nThen came the license debate. Well, out of 300, what could be an issue here,\nreally? MIT, GPL, Apache, BSD2 or 3 clauses, etc. Heck, we wanted it as open\nas it gets. For some very subtle reasons, MIT won over BSD3 clauses.\n\nThis MIT license is the first fail-safe mechanism to protect the community. If\nwe ever go toward a very aggressive monetization of the Security Engine,\nanyone can fork it.\n\nSome objected in the past that our Consensus algorithm, the one filtering the\ntens of millions of signals we receive daily to sort out poisoning and false\npositives, isn\u2019t public. It\u2019s entirely true, but not for the reason one would\nthink. There is no secret sauce here; instead, this part of CrowdSec is as\nmuch code as it is infrastructure. The two are vastly intertwined and heavily\nrely on AWS microservices. Open sourcing wouldn\u2019t help anyone running it at\nhome, and without the overview effect of the network, it would be useless\nanyway.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s a swift iterating code, meaning documenting it and making it open\nsource grade for publication would be very heavy for us at that stage. We will\nlikely open-source it eventually, but it\u2019s not yet time. You can still join us\nand our discussions to make this Consensus better. It\u2019s not a black box,\neither. The team welcomes every good soul willing to help.\n\nIf the software is ever forked, well, it\u2019ll be upon the new team to create its\nown curation system, but we\u2019re pretty transparent as to how we do it\nourselves. And without this curation algorithm, CrowdSec is still the best\nIPDS you\u2019ll find.\n\nWith those ingredients, we knew we could create a snowball and get the Network\nEffect to detect dangerous IP addresses at scale. Now ... about this money\nthing...\n\n## The Security Engine is a means to an end, not an end in itself\n\nHow is this network going to feed those clever people behind the scenes? To\nachieve our goal, we needed funds, business angels & VCs, hence a solid\nmonetization plan to put in front of roughly 20M\u20ac investment.\n\nThe Network Effect provides valuable CTI & blocklist data. The hundreds of\nthousands of servers parsing their logs and sharing the aggressions they faced\nare pumping a whooping 20 million signals per day. This is the gold stash of\nCrowdSec: the data.\n\nBy monetizing our data, we get a sound stream of revenue, and businesses gain\naccess to the freshest-ever real-time map of public IP addresses used by\ncybercriminals. Now, this is the second fail-safe to protect both companies\nand the community.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine we go south and change the license, close the source code, and\nask for a lot of money per agent running, tying it to cloud dependency, etc. A\nreal nightmare. Well, next thing you know, the network will be shrinking\nquickly, people will leave, our signal stream will start to dry out, and our\nrevenue stream along with it.\n\nSo, if we start monetizing the FOSS security engine, we\u2019d lose our current\nincome source, as simple as it is. Letting go of the prey for the shadow\ndoesn\u2019t make much sense, and I\u2019m not sure our VC would agree with this\nstrategy.\n\n## The delicate art of drawing the line between paid & free\n\nEven though we had a solid view of how we wanted to architecture our income\nstream, this doesn\u2019t mean we struck a home run on the first try.\n\nThe IDPS stays free, and if you handle a few instances of CrowdSec, you do not\nneed extra features. But if you\u2019re a business, you\u2019d want 1-year data\nretention, auto-enrolment, targeted attack detection, 5-minute updates, multi\nseats, alert context, multiple premium blocklists, etc.\n\nWe thought there would be a natural conversion between free & paid users. The\nclassical cases tell you that 2.5% is a decent rate. If we develop a great\ntop-notch enterprise offering and make it super helpful and user-friendly, we\nshould automatically get 2.5% of users upgrading to premium plans... right? We\nhave around 70K active users, 45K of whom have a CrowdSec Console account, and\nwe can reach out to them. This would net us above 1000 paid customers (to\ndate), with an average cart of 1000\u20ac monthly. We\u2019re golden!\n\nFine, let\u2019s make this and test the water...\n\nWell, the results were... not so great. What we forgot in the first place is\nthat most users, no matter if they are business grade or tinkerers, chose us\nbecause we are free. It\u2019s part of the deal. There is no issue with this, but\nthe famous 2.5% isn\u2019t applying here. In more detail, there is no tinkerer or\nSMB market ready to pay. What they get for free is enough for them, and no\nbudget is yet allocated to an upgrade here. This is good in a sense; we are\nhelpful, and it\u2019s part of the fail-safe mechanisms we talked about earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a tremendous market for large and XL enterprises.\nBudget is less of an issue here, and by fishing in our Console users, we found\npearls working in top 1000 businesses worldwide, and they are receptive to our\npremium offerings. The only \u2018issue\u201d is that instead of a low touch approach\n(put your credit card details by yourself, you\u2019re all set), we had to pivot\ntoward a sales, high touch model to satisfy those accounts.\n\n## Capturing intention vs. catching attention\n\nBut there is still a catch. Big corps? Timing is entirely different.\n\nTheir SecOps teams are swamped, you don\u2019t get anywhere close to their\ninfrastructure engineers, their backlogs are crowded, and no matter what you\nbring, take a ticket and queue. So yes, they buy, but the sales cycle is\naround 18 months rather than 6. Also, it\u2019s much more complicated to sell a\nproduct like CrowdSec, a versatile, low footprint, behavior-based, and crowd-\npowered protection system, than a CTI. Blue Ocean looks cool: \u201cI have no\ncompetition, and I\u2019ll set the standard\u201d. But in reality, it is difficult to\nreach potential customers with a product that does not fit one specific\ncategory.\n\nSo, if you start plowing the market and educating every client about what you\ndo, most of them will not get it. Blue Ocean strategy is more challenging to\npull, trust me.\n\nThe better road here is to let the user discover, adopt, extend their use, and\nenjoy, and then they will be back to you when they are ready. Takes time? Yes.\nFrustrating? Yes. But it\u2019s also mechanical, and L/XL corps have started to use\nthe product, integrate it, and deploy it at a vast scale. There is just no way\nwe can accelerate their decision cycles, but there is no way for us to capture\ntheir intention at the exact right moment either. So, the better road here is\nto scoop them when they\u2019re ripe.\n\n## CTI, TTI, and blocklists: the real cash engine\n\nOn the other hand, we have data \u2014 precious, unique, easy to consume, and API-\ndriven.\n\nOur data is not \u201cyet another OSINT low-quality feed\u201d packaged with markup or a\ncopy of \u201cyet another outdated C2 server list\u201d. Those insights from the network\nare unique, at scale, false-positive proof, coming from the largest CTI\nnetwork on earth, growing 0.4% daily. The CrowdSec data covers more protocols,\noffers more diversity (from 3000+ Autonomous Systems in 180 countries), is\nharvested from genuine intrusion attempts (not honeypot traffic), and is as\nfresh as possible.\n\nWe sort out this data in two buckets: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and\nTactical Threat Intelligence (TTI).\n\nCTI is all about knowing what happened in the past and how to contextualize\nsomething happening in a log pit or a SIEM, and is a massive help for\nforensics. That data isn\u2019t curated enough to be injected into an edge\nfiltering component, but they are an enormous help to make sense out of\nevents.\n\nAt CrowdSec, the CTI database holds around 50 million IP addresses from the\nlast six months. 90 million in total, 10 million for the previous 30 days.\nThey come with 20+ fields that any system like OpenCTI, MISP, or others can\nparse, integrate, and make sense of.\n\nTTI is all about blocking IP addresses that are, beyond reasonable doubt,\nmalicious. This level of certainty could only be reached because many very\ndiversified and well-trusted network members saw those IP addresses, and they\ndon\u2019t belong to any of our or your allowed lists. These blocklists of\nmalicious IPs can be directly injected into your firewall, load balancers,\nreverse proxy, web servers, etc. They are actionable.\n\n### TL;DR\n\nThis is what CrowdSec is monetizing:\n\nThe attack signals received and curated by the Network Effect.\n\nNot the software. Not your data.\n\nIt\u2019s not a zero-sum game. We take from the bad guys their IP addresses and\ntechniques and turn them into an income stream to allow the more significant\nnumber to defend themselves for free, the businesses to become more resilient,\nand the company to thrive and pay the brains behind it. The value here is\ncreated on the backs of the bad guys, not the good ones.\n\nThis makes us no saint since we are also a business and see our interest in\nthis, but we believe this is the fairest and most resilient business model we\ncould adopt.\n\n## The delicate art of drawing the line between paid & free\n\nNow, since the network generates the value, it\u2019s only fair to share not only\nthe FOSS Engine but also some of the signals back to those helping us make the\ninternet a safer place.\n\nBut if we give the entire blocklist for free, we will just be abused by other\nCTI companies, MSPs, or MSSPs, and we\u2019ll lose part of our income.\n\nTo draw a fair limit, we decided to update all members daily and send them\nback only IP lists that their Security Engines contribute to identifying. Long\nstory short, if your machine runs a VOIP anti-scan scenario, you\u2019ll get all\nIPs that are scanning VOIP infrastructure in return because you partake in the\neffort. Still, for example, you won\u2019t get free data on IPs brute-forcing\nTerminal Server Endpoints (TSE). By the way, it\u2019s fair to assume that if you\ndon\u2019t filter, say, terminal server brute force, you probably don\u2019t run TSE, so\nyou probably don\u2019t care about the IP hammering it.\n\nCrowdSec CTI has three colors: Silver, Gold, and Platinum.\n\nThe Silver-grade data is free for the ones partaking in the detection effort.\nWe give it back to any Security Engine detecting a specific type of attack. If\nyour security engine participates in VOIP attack detection, it will be fed\nback to the blocklist of public IPs attacking VOIP infrastructure for free.\n\nGold-grade data is what you get when you have a premium subscription to the\nCrowdSec Console. This data is integrated into your subscription fee and\navailable to boost the remediation capacities of your Security Engines. You\ncan also buy Gold data apart from any Security Engine, as a TTI list.\n\nPlatinum-grade data get all of our CTI or TTI data, with all details regarding\ntheir behaviors, MITR classification, active times, and targeted countries\n(20+ fields), delivered by the minute. They also receive extra curated,\nNetwork Effect-related blocklists, some of which are enriched by our AI models\n\u2014 for example, our Residential proxy / VPN list. In platinum, you can also get\nthe entire CTI data lake or even get a specific blocklist tailored to your\nneeds.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis was a long one, but I felt it was a necessary disclosure that showcases\nhow we carefully took time to align our interests with the ones of the\ncommunity, our investors, and our clients. This is not a \u201chow to monetize open\nsource\u201d writeup since every FOSS project is different. Still, I hope sharing\nthis transparently will help everyone find their path and answer most\nquestions about our business model choices, philosophy, ethics, and\nresilience.\n\nWritten by\n\nPhilippe Humeau\n\nNo items found.\n\n## You may also like\n\nInside CrowdSec\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\n10\n\nmin. read\n\n### Network Effect x AI: Transforming CTI into Tactical Threat Intelligence\n\nRead article\n\nInside CrowdSec\n\nSeptember 6, 2023\n\n10\n\nmin. read\n\n### The Curious Case of Netgear RCE and How Vulnerabilities Persist in the\nWild\n\nRead article\n\nInside CrowdSec\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\n3\n\nmin. read\n\n### New IP External Blocklists\n\nRead article\n\nSubscribe to the newsletter\n\nProduct\n\nCrowdSec BlocklistsCrowdSec Security EngineCrowdSec Threat IntelligencePricing\n\nSolutions\n\nCloud SecurityE-commerceMSSPService ProviderSOC TeamsFor HoobyistsFor SMBsFor\nEnterprises\n\nCommunity\n\nGetting startedVideo tutorialsDocumentationAPI DocumentationAmbassadorsHow to\ncontribute\n\nCompany\n\nBlogOur storyProduct RoadmapOpen-source softwareCareersPressList of\npartnersWhy become a partner\n\nGeneral Information\n\nContactFAQRemove an IP from the blocklistLegal noticePrivacy policyCookies Our\nCookie Policy\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 CrowdSec All Rights Reserved\n\nWebsite by Bolk\n\nConsent Management Platform: Personalize Your Options\n\nOur platform empowers you to tailor and manage your privacy settings, ensuring\ncompliance with regulations.
