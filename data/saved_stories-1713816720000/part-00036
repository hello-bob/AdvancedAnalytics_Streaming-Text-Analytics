The research also reveals genetic ties with our closest\nextinct relatives \u2014 the Neanderthals and Denisovans \u2014 and how these genes may\naffect present-day disease risk.\n\nIn one of the largest non-European analyses of its kind, scientists sequenced\nthe DNA of more than 3,200 Japanese people across seven regions of the\ncountry, extending from the snowy mountains of Hokkaido in the north to the\nsubtropical southern shores of Okinawa.\n\nThe researchers collated these genetic data, along with relevant clinical\ninformation, into a large new database called the Japanese Encyclopedia of\nWhole-Genome/Exome Sequencing Library (JEWEL).\n\nThe team discovered that modern Japanese people mostly descended from three\nancestral groups: Neolithic Jomon hunter-gatherers; a group believed to have\nbeen the ancient predecessors of the Han Chinese; and an unidentified group\nwith ties to Northeast Asia. This finding further challenges a contested,\nthree-decades-long hypothesis that Japanese people originated from the Jomon\npeople and, later, rice-farming Yayoi migrants from continental Asia.\n\nRelated: India's evolutionary past tied to huge migration 50,000 years ago and\nto now-extinct human relatives\n\nThe new analysis also revealed 42 pieces of DNA that Japanese people inherited\nfrom Neanderthals and two from Denisovans that could be linked to complex\ntraits, meaning those that are encoded by multiple genes. This inheritance was\nlikely the result of earlier interbreeding events between these ancient groups\nand early Homo sapiens, the authors wrote in the paper.\n\nDenisovan-derived DNA within a gene called NKX6-1 was associated with the\ndevelopment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and within the gene POLR3E, it was tied\nto height, the authors found. Eleven Neanderthal-derived DNA sequences were\nfound to be associated with seven diseases, including T2D, coronary artery\ndisease, prostate cancer and the inflammatory disorder rheumatoid arthritis.\nMost of these 44 chunks of ancient DNA are unique to East Asians, the authors\nsaid.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nUntil recently, large-scale genetic sequencing research has focused on\nanalyzing DNA from people of European descent, leaving a significant gap in\nour understanding of other human populations, including those in Asia.\nTherefore, the new findings may provide some long-coveted answers.\n\n\"This comprehensive genetic dataset enables us to delve into uncharted\nterritories concerning population and medical genetics of the Japanese\npopulation,\" the authors wrote in a paper describing their findings, published\nWednesday (April 17) in the journal Science Advances.\n\nThese discoveries could even supplement research that could lead to the\ndevelopment of personalized medicine, the authors wrote.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014Ancient bones reveal previously unknown Japanese ancestors\n\n\u2014Freckled woman with high alcohol tolerance lived in Japan 3,800 years ago\n\n\u2014Analysis of ancient teeth questions theory that Native Americans originated\nfrom Japan\n\nFor instance, the team identified gene mutations that could be clinically\nimportant within the Japanese population. One notable example is a mutation in\na gene called PTPRD that was found in six people in the cohort. Clinical\ninformation was available for three of these individuals, who experienced\nseveral of the same health conditions, including having heart attacks, kidney\nfailure and high blood pressure.\n\nJEWEL will serve as a \"reference for future genetic research within and beyond\nthe Japanese population,\" the study authors concluded.\n\nEmily Cooke\n\nStaff Writer\n\nEmily is a health news writer based in London, United Kingdom.
