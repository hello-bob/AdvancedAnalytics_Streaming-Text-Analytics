Lee\n\nA huge proportion of tech journalism is characterized by scandals,\nsensationalism, and shoddy research. Can we fix it?\n\nIn November, a few days after Sam Altman was fired \u2014 and then rehired \u2014 as CEO\nof OpenAI, Reuters reported on a letter that may have played a role in\nAltman\u2019s ouster. Several staffers reportedly wrote to the board of directors\nwarning about \u201ca powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said\ncould threaten humanity.\u201d\n\nThe discovery: an AI system called Q* that can solve grade-school math\nproblems.\n\nLan Truong\n\n\u201cResearchers consider math to be a frontier of generative AI development,\u201d the\nReuters journalists wrote. Large language models are \u201cgood at writing and\nlanguage translation,\u201d but \u201cconquering the ability to do math \u2014 where there is\nonly one right answer \u2014 implies AI would have greater reasoning capabilities\nresembling human intelligence.\u201d\n\nThis was a bit of a head-scratcher. Computers have been able to perform\narithmetic at superhuman levels for decades. The Q* project was reportedly\nfocused on word problems, which have historically been harder than arithmetic\nfor computers to solve. Still, it\u2019s not obvious that solving them would unlock\nhuman-level intelligence.\n\nThe Reuters article left readers with a vague impression that Q could be a\nhuge breakthrough in AI \u2014 one that might even \u201cthreaten humanity.\u201d But it\ndidn\u2019t provide readers with the context to understand what Q actually was \u2014 or\nto evaluate whether feverish speculation about it was justified.\n\nFor example, the Reuters article didn\u2019t mention research OpenAI published last\nMay describing a technique for solving math problems by breaking them down\ninto small steps. In a December article, I dug into this and other recent\nresearch to help to illuminate what OpenAI is likely working on: a framework\nthat would enable AI systems to search through a large space of possible\nsolutions to a problem.\n\nReuters is hardly the only news organization to publish superficial or\nconfusing articles about technology. Today\u2019s highly competitive media industry\ncreates bad incentives that discourage reporters from doing in-depth or\nnuanced journalism. Shallow or sensational stories about technology require\nless resources to produce and often attract more attention from readers.\n\nThere is great technology journalism being done today, but it tends to appear\nin specialist publications that cater to tech-savvy audiences. If we want a\nwell-informed public, we need to figure out how to raise the quality of\njournalism consumed by ordinary people \u2014 those who lack the expertise and\nfinancial means to identify and subscribe to specialist publications.\n\n## It\u2019s hard to cover technical subjects for normies\n\nThe first few paragraphs of a news story \u2014 known as the lead \u2014 are often the\nhardest to write. Indeed, I rewrote the first six paragraphs of this article\nat least a dozen times.\n\nA lead needs to accomplish two things: convince the reader the story is\ninteresting enough to continue reading, and provide the background necessary\nto understand the rest of the story.\n\nThese two goals are connected, since a reader who doesn\u2019t understand a story\nis unlikely to find it interesting. But they are also in tension because the\nlonger the explanation gets, the more likely the reader is to give up before\nreaching the \u201cnut graf\u201d that sums up what the article will be about.\n\nWhen I\u2019m writing the lead of a complex piece, I can almost hear a timer\nticking in the background, counting the seconds before the reader gets bored\nand closes the browser tab.\n\nThis is a much bigger challenge for some topics than others. I was at Vox\nduring the 2016 election and would sometimes help out on election nights.\nWriting leads about presidential politics wasn\u2019t difficult: Everyone knew who\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton were and why it mattered which of them became\nour next president.\n\nIn 2017, I moved from Vox to Ars Technica, where the leads of technology\nstories became much easier to write. Ars caters to software engineers and IT\nprofessionals, so I could assume a high level of knowledge about \u2014 and\ninterest in \u2014 technology topics. This meant I could spend fewer words\nproviding basic background information or convincing readers that a story was\ninteresting \u2014 and more words on the meat of the story.\n\n> Reporters have switched to treating Silicon Valley giants like other big\n> companies, which means mostly writing about them when they do something\n> wrong.\n\nBut a journalist who writes for a general news publication doesn\u2019t have that\nluxury. Many readers know very little about technology and need to be enticed\nto learn more. So journalists have developed some standard templates for\nmaking technology news interesting to ordinary readers.\n\nOne approach: Identify an emerging technology that has the potential to be the\n\u201cnext big thing.\u201d One of my first feature stories for Vox followed this\ntemplate: I argued that the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d was likely to dramatically\nimprove people\u2019s lives.\n\nIn hindsight, I overstated my case. Lots of people now own internet-connected\nlight bulbs, doorbells, and smart speakers, but I\u2019m not sure they have\nsignificantly improved our standard of living. And that\u2019s typical of the genre\n\u2014 many of the world-changing technologies trumpeted by the media turn out not\nto be so world-changing after all.\n\nReporters pitching these stories to their editors have an obvious incentive to\nexaggerate the importance of the technology or company they are writing about.\nAnd once they\u2019ve started work on a story, they have a strong incentive not to\nask too many skeptical questions. After all, if they learn that the technology\nisn\u2019t actually a big deal, they might have to kill the story and be left with\nnothing to show for their work.\n\nThese stories are particularly common in business magazines, whose readers are\ninterested in up-and-coming companies but not the details of how their\ntechnology works. And sometimes that lack of curiosity proves embarrassing.\n\nElizabeth Holmes was featured on the covers of Forbes, Fortune, and Inc.\nbefore The Wall Street Journal revealed that Theranos\u2019s technology didn\u2019t work\nin 2015. Sam Bankman-Fried appeared on the covers of Fortune and Forbes before\nthe 2022 implosion of FTX.\n\nOf course most companies that receive magazine cover treatment don\u2019t turn out\nto be massive frauds. But the tendency to take subjects at their word can lead\nto superficial and credulous coverage.\n\n## The scandal frame\n\nConversely, reporters love to catch big companies doing something illegal,\nunethical, or anticompetitive.\n\nReporters working on these stories have the opposite incentive of those\nwriting puff pieces about startup founders. It doesn\u2019t pay to give subjects\nthe benefit of the doubt because a story is more compelling if it\u2019s framed in\nsimplistic good-versus-evil terms.\n\nFor example, in 2014 The Verge published a scoop about Uber\u2019s \u201cplaybook for\nsabotaging Lyft\u201d: contractors hailing Lyft rides and then trying to recruit\nthe drivers to work for Uber. As I wrote at the time, it\u2019s not obvious Uber\ndid anything wrong here. After all, workers benefit when companies compete\nvigorously for their services. But that kind of nuance was nowhere to be found\nin the Verge story, which argued that Uber\u2019s \u201cruthless efforts\u201d revealed its\n\u201ccutthroat nature.\u201d\n\nThis starkly moralistic framing not only made the story more clickable, it\nalso saved the reporter the trouble of researching recruiting industry norms\nto see whether Uber had actually crossed any ethical lines.\n\nAnother example: In 2017 there was a wave of stories about an iPhone software\nupdate that slowed down the performance of older iPhones. Reporters dutifully\nincluded some context: a quote from Apple stating that this was necessary to\nprevent devices with aging batteries from shutting down unexpectedly. But most\nstories about the controversy still framed it as a scandal. And few, if any,\nreporters actually tried to figure out if Apple\u2019s solution had been a good\none.\n\nA more subtle example comes from 2022, when The New York Times reported that\n\u201cLinkedIn Ran Social Experiments on 20 Million Users Over Five Years.\u201d The\n\u201csocial experiment\u201d here was A/B testing \u2014 a technique technology companies\nroutinely use to test new features. LinkedIn experimented with different\nversions of its \u201cPeople You May Know\u201d feature to see whether people are more\nlikely to get new jobs from arms-length acquaintances than close friends.\nResults from their research were published in the journal Science.\n\nThe piece ominously suggested that conducting such experiments on users \u201ccould\naffect their job prospects.\u201d It only mentioned in passing, in a quote from one\nof the study\u2019s authors, that failing to conduct such experiments \u2014 and hence\nto learn whether a feature improves the user experience \u2014 could affect users\u2019\njob prospects too, before moving on to discuss other examples of A/B testing,\nsuch as Facebook\u2019s \u201cquiet\u201d manipulation news feeds.\n\nThe fourth paragraph of the Times piece acknowledges that A/B testing is a\n\u201clongstanding practice\u201d in the industry and that even The New York Times uses\nit. But the piece was still framed as a potential scandal rather than a\nworthwhile bit of social science. And I worry that such coverage could\ndiscourage press-shy companies from doing research like this in the future.\n\n## The growing antagonism between the media and Silicon Valley\n\nOver the last decade, Silicon Valley elites have grown increasingly frustrated\nwith media coverage of their industry. And they aren\u2019t wrong that coverage has\ngrown increasingly negative. But I think they\u2019re wrong to assume this reflects\na hostility toward Silicon Valley in particular.\n\nA more banal explanation is that companies like Google, Facebook, and Uber\naren\u2019t startups anymore. It no longer makes sense to publish positive profiles\nintroducing readers to these companies. So reporters have switched to treating\nSilicon Valley giants like other big companies, which means mostly writing\nabout them when they do something wrong.\n\nThink, for example, about the way oil and drug companies get covered by the\nmedia. Stories about oil companies typically involve accusations of\nenvironmental damage or harms to human rights. Stories about drug companies\nfrequently focus on addiction, misleading marketing, or price gouging.\n\nIn part, this happens because a big company doing something wrong is a more\ncolorful story than a big company just delivering good products at a\nreasonable price. It also happens because many journalists got into the\nprofession to \u201cspeak truth to power.\u201d As big technology companies have grown\nwealthier and more powerful over the last decade, journalists increasingly see\nthem as powerful institutions that deserve more scrutiny.\n\nI think that\u2019s entirely appropriate up to a point. Writing about misconduct by\nbig companies is an important function of an independent press. But I worry\nthat the pendulum might have swung so far in this direction that other\nworthwhile angles get neglected.\n\n## An example: self-driving technology\n\nOne of the stories I\u2019m most excited about right now is the slow but steady\nprogress of Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project. In December,\nWaymo reported that it had driven more than 7 million miles with no one behind\nthe wheel and that its vehicles were involved in injury-causing crashes 75%\nless often than humans driving the same roads.\n\nWaymo held a video call with reporters shortly before it released its report.\nAfterward, I compared notes with another reporter. We both agreed that the\nstory was unlikely to generate much attention.\n\n\u201cI was just talking to my editor about how I\u2019ll write something short that no\none will want to read,\u201d he told me in a direct message. \u201cIt does feel\nnewsworthy, but they did a terrible job providing a punchline.\u201c\n\nI find attitudes like this frustrating, but he wasn\u2019t wrong. My write-up of\nthe news did not attract much attention, and I bet his didn\u2019t either.\n\nWhat does drive attention is crashes. Any time there\u2019s a significant crash\ninvolving a self-driving vehicle, it gets wide coverage in the media \u2014 even if\nthe self-driving vehicle isn\u2019t at fault. And stories that report on broader\ncrash trends can be extremely one-sided.\n\nFor example, a Washington Post story last summer reported that the number of\nfatal crashes involving Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology had \u201csurged over the past\nfour years.\u201d Conspicuously missing from the story was any data about the\ndenominator: How many total miles did Tesla vehicles travel with Autopilot\nengaged?\n\nWithout that information it\u2019s impossible to tell whether Autopilot makes\nTesla\u2019s vehicles safer or less safe. But a more nuanced analysis wouldn\u2019t have\nfit the attention-grabbing headline the Post chose about the \u201cshocking toll of\nTesla\u2019s Autopilot.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, I think there are legitimate grounds for concern about the safety\nof Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology. Tesla does seem to be more cavalier about\nsafety than Waymo.\n\nBut I worry about the perverse incentives created by our intensely competitive\nmedia environment. I bet the Post\u2019s story about Tesla last summer got a lot\nmore attention than anyone\u2019s write-up of Waymo\u2019s positive safety data in\nDecember. And this could push the public toward unwarranted skepticism of a\ntechnology that has the potential to save thousands of lives.\n\n## The power of a knowledgeable audience\n\nThere are lots of other kinds of stories to be written about the technology\nworld \u2014 explaining how technology works, exploring its legal or policy\nimplications, examining how people are using technology, and so forth. These\nkinds of stories are not only more work to report, they are often harder to\nsell to readers.\n\nA related challenge is that technology talent is expensive. I have a master\u2019s\ndegree in computer science, and I like to think this background enables me to\nwrite more sophisticated technology stories. But few technology reporters have\nthis kind of training.\n\nA big reason for this is that computer scientists can make more money working\nas software engineers. But another factor is that most readers are not\ntechnology experts themselves and don\u2019t know or especially care if technology\nstories get the details right. So a publication that pays a premium to hire a\nreporter with deep expertise may not see a good return on that investment.\n\nThere are exceptions, and one of them is Ars Technica, the publication where I\nworked from 2017 to 2021. If I made even a slight error in an Ars story, our\ntech-savvy commenters would point it out within minutes of publication.\n\nAs a result, I felt pressure to stay at the top of my game. I made sure I\nunderstood a technology thoroughly before writing about it. Discerning readers\ncould tell our stories were a cut above technology stories published\nelsewhere, and so they kept coming back to the site.\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t everyone get their technology news from a site like Ars\nTechnica? Ars doesn\u2019t focus as much on making stories accessible by a broad\naudience. Writers spend fewer words explaining basic technology concepts and\nconvincing readers a topic is interesting. Ars stories sometimes get deep into\nthe technical weeds, which is catnip for our core audience but may bore casual\nreaders.\n\nIn theory, a publication could deliver the best of both worlds, with the rigor\nof a specialist publication and the accessibility of a generalist publication.\nBut it would be hard to make this pay off financially. Normie readers would be\nunlikely to notice or appreciate the publication\u2019s greater technical rigor.\nIndeed, more rigorous reporters might actually cost their publications money\nby nixing sensational stories that have the potential to bring in more\ntraffic.\n\n## Money matters\n\nThe awkward reality is that tech journalism is the way it is because that\u2019s\nmostly what consumers want. Nobody is explicitly asking for technology\ncoverage that lacks depth or nuance, of course. But journalism like this is\noften easier to produce and is often more clickable.\n\nMoreover, journalism in the 21st century is in a state of perpetual crisis.\nOur industry has endured wave after wave of layoffs and publication closures.\nAlready in 2024 we\u2019ve seen announcements that Pitchfork will cease to operate\nas an independent site, and both Sports Illustrated and the Los Angeles Times\nhave planned layoffs in the hundreds. Indeed, aside from a brief wave of\ninvestor enthusiasm between 2013 and 2015, the industry has been like this\nacross my entire 17-year career.\n\n> The awkward reality is that tech journalism is the way it is because that\u2019s\n> mostly what consumers want.\n\nSo I would love it if publications invested more in in-depth reporting about\ntechnology and other topics. But the reality is that most news organizations\nare struggling just to stay in business. With little margin for error,\npublishers are understandably reluctant to invest in nuanced technology\njournalism that is unlikely to generate a clear financial return.\n\nThis seems like a promising direction for philanthropists.\n\nThere is great technology journalism out there, but it\u2019s often expensive. My\nformer employer, Ars Technica, is a free, ad-supported publication, though\npaying subscribers get an ad-free experience and other perks.\n\nBut other high-quality publications are very expensive. The Information, an\nexcellent business publication focused on Silicon Valley, charges $399 for an\nannual subscription. There are newsletters like Casey Newton\u2019s Platformer and\nBen Thompson\u2019s Stratechery that cost $100 and $120 per year, respectively. If\nyou\u2019re interested in artificial intelligence, you might enjoy my own\nnewsletter, Understanding AI, which costs $75 annually.\n\nA subscription business model insulates these publications against the\nvagaries of the advertising market. But it also puts them out of reach for\ncasual news consumers. So the harder challenge is to improve the quality of\nthe technology journalism that the average reader consumes.\n\nThis is tough because, as we\u2019ve seen, these readers can\u2019t tell \u2014 or maybe\ndon\u2019t care \u2014 if the journalism they consume is any good. So normal market\nmechanisms aren\u2019t going to help.\n\nI also don\u2019t think it makes sense to try to build new mainstream news\norganizations from scratch because they would face the same perverse\nincentives as existing organizations.\n\nRather, the goal should be to encourage and assist existing news organizations\nto step up their game. Here are a few ideas.\n\nAwards. Every year, America\u2019s top news organizations devote significant\nresources to stories calibrated to win a Pulitzer Prize, with the most visible\nprizes awarded to the biggest scoops and the most ambitious investigative\nstories. There are surprisingly few awards for other types of journalistic\nexcellence. An organization that gave out awards every year to the reporters\nwho did the most rigorous yet accessible technology journalism could help\nraise the prestige of this kind of reporting and give the best technology\nreporters more clout within their own newsrooms.\n\nStory partnerships. One of the most important journalism nonprofits of the\ninternet era has been ProPublica, which hires reporters to do in-depth\ninvestigations and then partners with mainstream publications to publish their\nfindings. Partnering with existing large publications ensures that\nProPublica\u2019s findings reach a large audience. ProPublica focuses on ambitious\nmonthslong investigative projects, but I could imagine a similar model working\nfor other types of journalism, including stories explaining how technology\nworks and how it\u2019s likely to impact the world.\n\nI think it might be helpful for the reporters doing this kind of work to write\nfor two audiences, with a specialist newsletter that covers day-to-day\ndevelopments on her beat as well as occasional pieces that get syndicated to a\nmainstream audience. The goal of the newsletter wouldn\u2019t be to attract a broad\naudience, but rather an influential audience that could provide feedback,\nstory ideas, and potential sources.\n\nDirect support for reporters. Vox.com has a section called Future Perfect\nwhose journalists are supported by a number of charitable foundations. At\nfirst glance it seems odd for nonprofit foundations to pay the salaries of\nreporters in for-profit newsrooms, but the advantage of this approach is that\nthe reporters become fully integrated into their host newsroom while being\ninsulated from the commercial pressures their colleagues face.\n\nSupporting expert sources. The best sources are willing to talk about a fairly\nwide range of topics, are good communicators, and are highly responsive to\nemail. Sources like this are especially hard to find in computer science. The\nmost knowledgeable technologists often work for big companies that don\u2019t let\ntheir employees talk to reporters. Academics are able to talk to reporters,\nbut in my experience it\u2019s harder to find computer scientists willing and able\nto do so \u2014 perhaps because being quoted in the press is considered less\nprestigious in computer science than in other fields like law or economics.\n\nSo I\u2019d love to have a program that paid competitive salaries for articulate\ntechnical experts to spend a year or two at a university or think tank serving\nas a source for reporters working on technology stories. Alternatively, this\ncould be structured as an award program, with reporters nominating their most\nvaluable expert sources for cash prizes.\n\n## How Silicon Valley can help\n\nOne irony of the growing antagonism between Silicon Valley and the media is\nthat Silicon Valley created the economic environment that has driven the\ntransformation of media over the last 20 years.\n\nWhen journalists write clickbait headlines about technology companies, their\ngoal is often to improve their ranking on Google, Reddit, and other social\nmedia sites. Reporters who write shoddy stories about technology companies\noften do so because their editor didn\u2019t give them enough time to do in-depth\nreporting. And often that\u2019s because the publication is in a precarious\nfinancial position because Google and Facebook have soaked up a large share of\nadvertising revenue that previously went to media companies.\n\nNo one specific person or company is to blame for this. The invention of the\ninternet probably made it inevitable that the media industry would become more\ncompetitive and therefore less profitable. But design decisions by tech giants\nhave certainly made the problem worse over the last decade. And people in\nSilicon Valley could be doing more to help if they wanted to.\n\nIn the last section I offered some ideas for how philanthropists \u2014 in Silicon\nValley or elsewhere \u2014 could promote better technology journalism. I think\nsimilar ideas would likely work for other complex beats like law, science, or\nmedicine.\n\nBut the people in Silicon Valley who could do the most good are those at\nGoogle \u2014 especially the ones who run Google News. Google is still one of the\nlargest sources of traffic for news sites. The Google News algorithm doesn\u2019t\nencourage clickbait the way Facebook\u2019s News Feed did during the mid-2010s. But\nGoogle also doesn\u2019t seem to work very hard to identify and promote exceptional\njournalism in search results.\n\nIf Google started doing this \u2014 and being transparent about how they are doing\nit \u2014 it might create a financial incentive for news organizations to invest\nmore in quality.\n\nIf you have financial means, you can get high-quality journalism by\nsubscribing to expensive specialist publications. But democracy depends on the\ngeneral public being reasonably well-informed. The poor quality of mainstream\nnews sources is ultimately going to hurt everyone.\n\nTimothy B.
