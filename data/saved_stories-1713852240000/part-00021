This morning, I had a couple of hours before\ngoing to work so I decided to implement the \u201cMake flow visible\u201d example from\nBret Victor\u2019s \u2018Learnable Programming\u2019 paper (Feel free to change the code):\n\npremalink\n\nHere is how it\u2019s done:\n\n  1. Given a program, step through it once using debug.js to get the execution flow info\n  2. Plot the execution flow using d3\n  3. Whenever the user scrubs through the plot, rerun the steps up to the step index that the user has the pointer over.\n  4. Repeat from 1 when the editor code change\n\nThe entire thing is ~250 LOCs and is up on Github.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
