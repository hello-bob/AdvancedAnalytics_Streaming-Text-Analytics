Davide Angelini -\nstock.adobe.com\n\nGen Z is turning back the digital age clock.\n\nTiffany Zhong spent the last decade studying social media habits and used the\ninformation to create the Gen Z version of Myspace, called Nospace.\n\nOn top of going to school virtually during the pandemic, the Zoomer generation\nhas grown up in peak social media with algorithms dictating what they see and\nwho they interact with.\n\nNow, they\u2019re turning away from standard social media in search of more\nauthentic connections that can\u2019t be found on TikTok.\n\n\u201cGen Z simply are sick of the same old, same old when it comes to social\nmedia,\u201d Katya Varbanova, a brand marketing strategist, told Bustle.\n\nZhong, 27, is hoping that Nospace will give Gen Z a similar social media\nexperience to the one millennials had \u2014 for better or worse.\n\n## Explore More\n\n### I have a foot-long penis \u2014 it's so monstrous, I was barred from yoga\n\n### Popular snacks could be banned in certain states over cancer fears\n\n### My rare medical condition makes me permanently aroused \u2014 and it's ruined\nmy life\n\nLike MySpace and the early years of Facebook, Nospace users will have personal\nand customizable profile pages where they can share casual updates on what\nthey\u2019re up to.\n\n\u201cWhat I see right now is all social media is just media \u2014 it\u2019s not social\nanymore,\u201d Zhong told Bustle. \u201cEveryone is ogling at each other\u2019s lives and\npersonalities, but no one is engaging with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem we\u2019re solving: connection with others and self-\nexpression,\u201d she added.\n\n3\n\nNospace users will be able to share what they are \u201cwatching, eating, reading,\nlistening to IRL,\u201d Nospace\n\nNospace users will be able to share what they are \u201cwatching, eating, reading,\nlistening to IRL\u201d and \u201cstar\u201d their interests to allow them to find people with\nsimilar interests.\n\nAnd yes, the new app will list a user\u2019s closest friends, just like the MySpace\nTop 8.\n\n\u201cAll these other apps these days, it\u2019s just algorithmic. A lot of posts just\nget pushed down if you don\u2019t get engagement,\u201d Zhong explained.\n\n3\n\nZhong, 27, is hoping that Nospace will give Gen Z a similar social media\nexperience to the one millennials had. Nospace\n\nNospace has been likened to a giant global group chat by those who have tested\nthe app, especially with the separation of a \u201cfriends only\u201d curated by\nyourself of just your friends, and a chronological global feed, with every\nactive user in real-time.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re craving new experiences mainstream apps aren\u2019t able to produce,\u201d\nVarbanova said. \u201cAdd information overload to that, [and] the com-paranoia can\nlead to anxiety, [eating disorders], and mental health struggles. No wonder\nGen Z are craving places that make them feel better, not worse.\u201d\n\nRather than likes, Nospace will feature \u201cboosts\u201d \u2014 similar to a Facebook or\nInstagram like, but it won\u2019t push it up in the algorithm or rank content \u2014\nit\u2019s just for \u201cfun.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like a game. People love leveling up. You get unlimited boosts ...\nEveryone can feel special.\u201d\n\n3\n\nThere are currently over 380,000 people on the waitlist for Nospace. Nospace\n\nZhong\u2019s goal is that her app will help people find friends with similar\ninterests and encourage more self-expression.\n\n\u201cLoneliness is increasing because of a variety of reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t have as much to talk about with our IRL friends anymore because everyone\nwatches different content. It\u2019s not like we have the same Sunday shows, or the\nsame shows that drop the same episodes every week.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels lonely to be in a world where we\u2019re just watching our own content,\nor our own personalized feed of content and videos, instead of connecting with\nothers,\u201d she says. \u201cSocializing is so much more important than ever. It\ndoesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nThere are currently over 380,000 people on the waitlist for Nospace, which is\nset to launch summer 2024, according to the app website.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first \u201cold\u201d social media feature to be of interest to Gen Z.\n\nEarlier this year, Facebook brought back its \u201cpoke\u201d feature, and the younger\ngeneration loved it.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * gen z\n  * myspace\n  * social media\n  * 4/23/24\n\nRead Next Should handwriting be taught in school?
