For instance, the \"home office\" has extended our workplace so far into\nour living space that it could just as easily be called our \"office home.\"\nUnfortunately, this encroachment means that our work is always nearby, making\nit more difficult to switch off after a tough day and contributing to a state\nknown as \"burn-on.\" Researched primarily in Europe, burn-on is similar to\nburn-out in that it involves a state of exhaustion and depression, but with\nsome distinct differences. In this article, we'll explain this new \"burn-on\"\nphenomenon and what those affected can do about it.\n\n## What is burn-on?\n\nBurn-on is characterized by chronic exhaustion coupled with depression and is\nconsidered a preliminary stage of burn-out. With the latter, as the name\nsuggests, you feel depleted and defeated, but with burn-on, you experience a\nkind of hyperactivity combined with exhausting paralysis. Being more effective\nbecomes an obsession, subordinating everything else. The same technology that\nallows for new workplace methodologies, such as the home office or \"hybrid\nworking,\" has also made work always accessible. With work continuously in the\nbackground, we're more likely to think about our to-do lists, even after the\nworkday ends, than enjoy our personal lives. This trend is especially true of\nhigh-achievers, who find little satisfaction in what they've already\naccomplished and are constantly preparing for the next challenge.\n\n### What can be the symptoms or consequences of burn-on?\n\nWhat Burn-Out has in common with Burn-On is the feeling of despair,\nsenselessness, hopelessness, lack of perspective, and the loss of joy in\neveryday life.\n\nThose affected desperately chase the feeling that \"everything should be fine,\"\nincreasing their pressure to perform and driving them to work even harder. The\ncompulsion for organization, tidiness, and cleanliness can be very pronounced,\nwith anything outside their imposed structures being viewed as a \"distraction\"\nfrom their goal. They find themselves under extreme time pressure and often\nhave a packed schedule that allows very little for recreation or relaxation.\nPeople suffering from chronic stress are often unaware of it and don't\nrecognize the symptoms. Often their thoughts revolve around why they are no\nlonger as happy as they used to be and what they need to do to improve the\nsituation.\n\nBurn-on makes it difficult for people to experience the joy in their lives\neven as it compels them to chase that feeling.\n\nDue to the permanent state of tension, those affected with burn-on have\ndifficulty falling asleep or sleeping through the night. Lack of sleep\ndeprives them of sleep's essential, revitalizing effects and can have\nrepercussions like high blood pressure and increased risk of heart attack,\nstroke, and other issues. Burn-on sufferers who encounter health problems\noften wonder why it happened to them when they were eating healthily,\nexercising, and thought they were taking good care of themselves. They didn't\nrealize they were subordinating exercise and nutrition to their performance at\nwork. Other symptoms of exhaustion and depression can be rapid mood swings and\nsevere back, shoulder, and neck pain.\n\n## What can you do about burn-on?\n\nThe first step in combating burn-on and embracing health and relaxation may\nsound trivial, but it's essential: you must change your mindset. Of course,\nchanges in attitude don't happen overnight, and the longer you've been in a\nconstantly performance-driven state, the harder it will be. However, the more\nyou realize that something has to change, the sooner it will happen. It can\nalso help to talk to other people about your situation. Finally, visualizing\nthe kind of life balance you'd like to achieve can motivate you to make time\nfor the personally important, non-work-related aspects of your life.\n\n### Shake off the tension\n\nLearn to slow down your everyday life, not just to recharge your batteries so\nyou can plunge back into the same daily routine. Instead, find a better\nbalance between your body and mind and your work and relaxation. The focus\nshould be on you and your well-being. For example, take small exercise breaks\nduring work. Walk a few steps or stretch, which is also good for your muscles.\nYou can clear your head and refresh your energy levels. You can also exercise\nafter work to shake off stress.\n\nIncorporate short mindfulness exercises in your everyday life. Mindfulness\nsessions help you to focus on the here and now without chasing the past and\nfuture. This self-awareness can help you push aside any mental snares that\ncould otherwise cause you to fall back into old patterns.\n\n### All-round talent: trampoline training\n\nTrampoline exercise offers a great all-in-one way to fight burn-on. First, it\nactivates every muscle in your body, making even brief workouts extremely\neffective. Gentle bouncing on the pliable surface can release tension in your\nshoulder, neck, and back and help to relax your body. The pressure literally\nfalls off you.\n\nA more vigorous, holistic workout also provides cardiovascular conditioning,\nhelping you fight high blood pressure and reduce your heart attack and stroke\nrisk.\n\nMini-trampoline workouts are also convenient: burn-on sufferers can easily\nincorporate them into their otherwise very structured daily routine, either at\nwork, home, or both. Whether you need a full-body workout, relaxation\nexercises, or a quick way to revitalize your body and mind, a rebounder can\nprovide it. Ultimately, a mini-trampoline can be your little island of\nrelaxation, where you can take care of your body and state of mind by\nperforming the mindfulness exercises mentioned above. Let your trampoline time\nbe about your well-being, not your peak performance or maximizing your\nworkouts.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you find some burn-on symptoms apply to you, don't worry: we all go through\ndown times and periods of low motivation. However, if the symptoms and the bad\nmood persist for an extended period, you should consider consulting with a\ndoctor. Remember that you and your health are inestimably valuable and deserve\ncare.\n\nFounded in 2003, bellicon pioneered customized bungee cords for mini-\ntrampoline suspension, enhancing all fitness and therapeutic uses. bellicon\nnow offers a complete line of exceptional rebounders, accessories, and a\ncomprehensive online fitness program, \"bellicon+\".\n\n  *     * Our history\n    * Numbers & Facts\n    * Trainer\n\n  *     * Trampoline\n    * Training\n    * Parts\n    * Vouchers\n\n  *     * Consulting\n    * Shipping\n    * Returns\n    * Helpdesk\n\nCompany\n\n  * Our history\n  * Numbers & Facts\n  * Trainer\n\nEquipment\n\n  * Trampoline\n  * Training\n  * Parts\n  * Vouchers\n\nServices\n\n  * Consulting\n  * Shipping\n  * Returns\n  * Helpdesk\n\n  * Terms\n  * Right of withdrawal\n  * Privacy\n  * Cookie-Settings\n  * Imprint\n  * Contact\n\n", "frontpage": false}
