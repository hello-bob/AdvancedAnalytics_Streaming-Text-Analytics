But another type of games took place in such amphitheaters\nduring spring time\u2014ones full of colors, flowers, and sex.\n\nFloralia was a festival that occurred in late April till early May to\ncelebrate the end of winter and honor a fertility goddess\u2014who may or may not\nhave been a \u201cprostitute.\u201d Whatever can be said of the deity, the celebration\nitself most definitely included sex workers. Along with circus stunts, bunny\nhunts, mimes, jesters, dancing, and nudity, the ancient civilization\ncelebrated the season with much licentiousness.\n\nIn Roman mythology, Flora is a goddess of fertility and blossoming plants,\noften associated with youth and the coming of spring. Her origins are\nintertwined with the Greek nymph known as Chloris, who is taken by Zephyrus,\ngod of the west wind. Following their wedding, she becomes the flower goddess,\nFlora. To the Ancient Romans, Flora was considered one of the flamines\nminores, minor deities who were given a cult and assigned a flamen, or priest.\n\nAtlas Obscura Trips\n\nNEW \u2014 Italian Food & Wine: Eating Regionally\n\nView This Trip\n\nZephyrus, god of the west wind, was associated with spring, and one of his\nwives became Flora, the goddess of flowers. ketrin1407/flickr\n\nThat\u2019s the mythology, though at least one scholar endorsed a different notion.\nThe 3rd-century writer Lactantius claimed that Flora was not a deity at all,\nbut rather a regular Roman prostitute who had been elevated to the realm of\ndivine beings. But historian Jason R. Abdale says that Lactantius was the only\nperson to ever make this claim, and that as a \u201chardline Christian... saying\n[Flora] wasn\u2019t a goddess was likely an attempt to smear aspects of ancient\nRoman polytheism to persuade people to come over to the \u2018proper\u2019 way of doing\nthings.\u201d Abdale continues on to say, \u201cfrom the other reports that we have,\nFlora was some sort of divine being.\u201d\n\n> The ludi florales, meaning \u201cfloral games,\u201d were introduced.\n\nAfter a period of brutal weather damaged the majority of crops in 240 BC, the\ncountry was facing the threat of famine. In an attempt to avoid devastation,\nthe Roman Senate consulted the Sibylline books, a collection of oracular texts\nthat were deeply regarded in ancient Rome. From the oracle, they heeded the\ndirective to build a temple in honor of Flora and to present her with an\nabundance of floral and vegetative offerings.\n\nStatues of Flora such as this one in Hungary show the ancient devotion to the\ngoddess. Globetrotter19/CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nThe first Floralia festival therefore took place on April 28, 238 BC in the\nTemple of Flora, which had just been constructed on the Quirinal Hill, near\nthe Circus Maximus chariot-racing stadium. This premier event was likely a\nmuch more modest celebration than it would eventually become. Both men and\nwomen adorned themselves and their animals with flower sashes and crowns, and\nwomen shed their usual layered clothes in favor of bolder, more revealing\ndresses that were disavowed the rest of the year.\n\nFor several decades after its inception, the Floralia was celebrated only\nsporadically, at some point almost disappearing entirely for reasons\nundetermined. But in 173 BC, following another season of severely destructive\nweather across Italy, the festival was reinstated. This time it became more\nelaborate and organized, formally running from April 28 to May 3 each year.\n\nThe ludi florales, meaning \u201cfloral games,\u201d were introduced. These competitive\nand performative events were held to incentivize voters for future elections.\nThe first few days of the Floralia featured games that were primarily\ntheatrical, with an unabashed air of licentiousness. Among the mimes and\njesters prized citywide for their suggestive comic displays, Rome\u2019s female sex\nworkers also participated in the performances to great fanfare and\nencouragement.\n\nArtsits throughout the centuries have attempted to capture the feel of the\nsensual festivities. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo/Public Domain\n\n\u201cThe rarity of occasions like the Floralia, where the most marginalized of\nwomen participated in the public religious life of the city in a very visible\nway, would have charged the performances with added significance for the\nperformers and the audience both,\u201d writes Molly Pasco-Pranger, Chair and\nProfessor of Classics at The University of Mississippi. These spectacles\u2014that\ninvolved miming, dancing, comedy, nudity, and participation from the\naudience\u2014were indeed charged. In many ways, the Floralia ludi paralleled the\nmore modern art of burlesque.\n\nAfter days and nights of theatrical antics, the final day of the festival was\nreserved for circus games. Animals that represented spring and renewal, like\nrabbits, goats, and deer, were released into the Circus Maximus to be paraded\nthen hunted for sacrifice, while grains and legumes, which were symbols of\nfertility in the ancient world, were thrown out into a cheering audience.\n\nWith the passage of time, the official celebration of Floralia eventually\ndissolved. Many historians believe this most likely occurred during the 4th\ncentury, concurrent with the Constantinian shift and Christian disdain for the\nsalacious nature of the festivities.\n\nAlthough today Flora is a lesser-mentioned deity in Roman mythology and her\nfestival exists only in history, the colorful sentiment she represents\nreappears with each passing spring. Every April, it could be said Flora is\nthere, like the scent of freshly picked flowers on a warm breeze. Any\naccompanying level of promiscuity is up to the observers.\n\nNext in series\n\n### Behold the Weird Glory of H\u00e4xan, A Wild 1922 Film About Witchcraft\n\nThe ground-breaking documentary blended academic research with salacious\nscenes of torture and nudity.
