(See the documentation if you want the old bindings back.) \u2022\n> Command-line option --modernbindings (-/) makes ^Q quit, ^X cut, ^C copy, ^V\n> paste, ^Z undo, ^Y redo, ^O open a file, ^W write a file, ^R replace, ^G\n> find again, ^D find again backwards, ^A set the mark, ^T jump to a line, ^P\n> show the position, and ^E execute. \u2022 Above modern bindings are activated\n> also when the name of nano's executable (or a symlink to it) starts with the\n> letter \"e\". \u2022 To open a file at a certain line number, one can now use also\n> `nano filename:number`, besides `nano +number filename`. \u2022 and put the\n> cursor on the first and last row in the viewport, while retaining the\n> horizontal position. \u2022 When the three digits in an #RGB color code are all\n> the same, the code is mapped to the xterm grey scale, giving access to\n> fourteen levels of grey instead of just four. \u2022 For easier access, M-\" is\n> bound to placing/removing an anchor, and M-' to jumping to the next anchor.\n> \u2022 Whenever an error occurs, the keystroke buffer is cleared, thus stopping\n> the execution of a macro or a string bind. \u2022 The mousewheel scrolls the\n> viewport instead of moving the cursor\n\nDownloads and more details on the Nano 8.0 release via the mailing list\nannouncement.\n\n27 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nGit 2.45 Released With Initial SHA1/SHA256 Interoperability & Reftable Support\n\nRust-Based Coreutils 0.0.26 Increases Compatibility With GNU Coreutils\n\nServo Web Engine Now Passing Acid2 Layout Engine Test\n\nSovereign Tech Fund Makes New Investments Into GNOME & PHP, Bug Bounty For\nsystemd\n\nLlamafile 0.8 Releases With LLaMA3 & Grok Support, Faster F16 Performance\n\nNginx 1.26 Released With Experimental HTTP/3 Support\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
