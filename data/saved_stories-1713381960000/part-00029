Whether you\u2019ve already picked your side in the debate or are still\nundecided, we\u2019ve got a new feature in v2024.1 of JetBrains IDEs that might\njust pique your interest \u2013 full line code completion. It\u2019s AI-powered and runs\nlocally without sending any data over the internet.\n\nIn this blog post, we\u2019ll tell you more about what full line code completion\nis, how it works, what languages are supported, and how you can provide\nfeedback about it to us.\n\n## What is full line code completion in JetBrains IDEs?\n\nThis new type of code completion was added to JetBrains IDEs with the latest\n2024.1 update. As you can see below, it takes the form of gray-toned, single-\nline suggestions that complete lines based on the context of the current file:\n\nGIF\n\nThese suggestions are powered by specialized language models that we\u2019ve\ntrained specifically for different languages and frameworks. The models run\nlocally without sending any code over the internet.\n\nFull line code compl\u0435tion is currently available for Java, Kotlin, Python,\nJavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, PHP, Go, and Ruby within the corresponding\nJetBrains IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PyCharm Professional, WebStorm,\nPhpStorm, GoLand, and RubyMine. In the coming months, we plan to extend the\nfunctionality to C#, Rust, and C++, so it will also land in Rider, RustRover,\nand CLion.\n\nNote that full line code completion is included with your active JetBrains IDE\nsubscription at no additional cost \u2013 just make sure you\u2019re on v2024.1 or\nlater. If you don\u2019t yet have a subscription, you can also use this feature\nduring the 30-day free trial.\n\n## How does full line completion work?\n\nWith full line code completion, we had two main goals in mind. The first one\nis obvious \u2013 to help you save time and increase your coding speed. But beyond\nthat, we also wanted to provide a solution that addresses the constraints\ncertain organizations have when it comes to using AI solutions that are\nconnected to the cloud.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how full line code completion helps to realize these two\naims:\n\n  * It works locally and is available offline. This means you can take advantage of the feature even if you aren\u2019t connected to the internet.\n  * It doesn\u2019t send any data from your machine over the internet. The language models that power full line code completion run locally, which is great for two reasons. First, your code remains safe, as it never leaves your machine. Second, there are no additional cloud-related expenses \u2013 that\u2019s why this feature comes at no additional cost.\n  * It\u2019s integrated deeply into JetBrains IDEs. All suggestions will be appropriately formatted, with the IDE checking for balanced brackets and quotes. Additionally, we use the power of static analysis and our understanding of code to filter out incorrect suggestions. Each supported language has its own set of suggested code correctness checks. The most basic ones, like unresolved reference checks, are implemented for most languages to guarantee that the IDE doesn\u2019t suggest non-existent variables and methods. The auto-import feature is also supported.\n  * It\u2019s designed to keep your workflow as smooth as possible. We use smart filtering to avoid showing suggestions that tend to be canceled explicitly or deleted right after they were added.\n\nFor some additional technical details, see this section below.\n\n## Full line code completion vs. AI Assistant\n\nThere are two ways you can benefit from AI functionality in JetBrains IDEs \u2013\nfull line code completion and JetBrains AI Assistant. We appreciate that this\nmight be confusing, so let\u2019s take a closer look at what they have in common\nand how they differ.\n\nBoth full line code completion and JetBrains AI Assistant aim to help you work\nfaster. They both also go beyond the standard completion that has been\navailable in JetBrains IDEs for some time already. However, JetBrains AI\nAssistant offers a more comprehensive feature set, including context-aware\nsmart chat and the ability to generate tests or write documentation.\n\nSee the table below for a comparison of the two AI functionalities:\n\nPlease rest assured that we never train any of our AI features on customers\u2019\ncode. If your company has strict data privacy regulations, but you still want\nto speed up your workflows with AI, full line code completion may be a better\nchoice for you.\n\n## Under the hood\n\nThe backbone of full line code completion is a programming-language specific\nlanguage model, which is trained in house using a dataset of open-source code\nwith permissive licenses. The language model\u2019s input is the code before the\ncaret, though for some languages, we also add content from related files. The\noutput is the model\u2019s suggested continuation of the current line, which is\nshown in gray.\n\nThe language model\u2019s inference runs on your local machine. To ensure the most\nefficient generation, the model inference runs in a separate process and is\nheavily optimized for the target machine\u2019s architecture. For example, if\nyou\u2019re using x86-64 architecture, the model will run on the CPU, whereas if\nyou\u2019re using ARM64 architecture, the model will use the power of your\ncomputer\u2019s GPU.\n\nAfter the suggestion is generated, a number of post-processing steps are\napplied. First, we check whether this suggestion is syntactically and\nsemantically correct, and then we perform smart filtering, formatting,\nparenthesis balancing, and various other manipulations. Post-processing is\ncrucial for user experience, so we do our best to show only valuable\nsuggestions that don\u2019t disturb your workflow.\n\nLastly, you may also be wondering why we decided to go for single-line\nsuggestions. The length of the AI completion suggestions is a trade-off. While\nlonger suggestions do tend to reduce how many keystrokes you have to make,\nwhich is good, they also increase the number of reviews required on your end.\nTaking the above into account, we decided that completing a single line of\ncode would be a fair compromise.\n\nThis decision allowed us to reduce the size of the model without any\nsignificant decline in suggestion quality. In the 2024.1 version of JetBrains\nIDEs, we use a language model that has 100 million parameters, with a maximum\ncontext size of 1,536 tokens, which is roughly 170 lines of code.\n\n## How to tweak the feature\n\nYou can configure full line code completion in Settings | Editor | General | Code Completion \u2013 all the settings can be found there, under the Machine Learning-Assisted Completion section:\n\nIf you\u2019d like to turn off the feature, you can do so by unticking the Enable Full Line suggestions checkbox. Alternatively, you can disable the plugin powering this feature. To do so, go to Settings | Plugins, switch to the Installed tab, and look for full line code completion.\n\n## How to provide feedback\n\nFull line code completion is still in active development, so we encourage you\nto share your feedback with us. You can do so by leaving a comment under this\nblog post. You can also upvote existing issues here or create a new one by\nlogging in and clicking on the New Issue button in the top right-hand corner.\n\nThat\u2019s it for today. Please give full line code completion a try and let us\nknow what you think. We\u2019ll continue improving this functionality further, with\nsupport for C#, Rust, and C++ as well as better integration with AI\nAssistant\u2019s multi-line code completion being our top priorities for now.
