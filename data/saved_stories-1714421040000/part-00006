Significant\nchanges have been implemented to enhance the security and reliability of the\nplatform. This release, version 8.0.0-preview.6.24214.1, introduces several\nnoteworthy additions, like changes related to templates, components,\ndashboard, testing and more.\n\nThe breaking changes notable among these are related to the Service Discovery\nAPI and the removal of all obsolete APIs. Also, the team announces more\nbreaking changes before the API is in the stable release.\n\nSeveral adjustments have been made to improve the security of .NET Aspire.\nThese enhancements include securing communication between various components\nsuch as the orchestrator, IDE, and dashboard, by utilizing TLS and API keys\nfor authentication. As stated:\n\n> This prevents unauthorized users from accessing potentially sensitive\n> information exposed by the app host project and the dashboard when running\n> locally on your machine.\n\nA significant change in this release is the addition of authentication\nrequirements for accessing the dashboard. Given the sensitive nature of the\ndata displayed on the dashboard, such as configuration details and telemetry\ndata, authentication is now mandatory even in local development environments.\n\nFor users accessing .NET Aspire apps through Visual Studio or C# Dev Kit for\nVisual Studio Code, authentication occurs seamlessly without encountering a\nlogin page, thanks to updated Aspire tooling. However, users deploying .NET\nAspire apps via the command line will need to perform an initial login to the\ndashboard. The required token is provided in the console output for users to\ncopy and paste onto the login page, establishing a persistent authentication\ncookie.\n\n(A persistent auth cookie, Source: Microsoft Documentation)\n\nThe Preview 6 release introduces the following additions:\nAspire.Hosting.Qdrant which provides resource definition for configuring a\nQdrant vector database resource within a .NET Aspire AppHost. Meanwhile,\nanother one is the client called Aspire.Qdrant.Client, offering a library for\ninteracting with a Qdrant vector database.\n\nRegarding the AppHost updates, preview 6 brings various new APIs and features\nto it, including the capability for users to specify custom container runtime\narguments, pass project resources' arguments programmatically, customize\nenvironment variable names for connection strings, and ensure compatibility\nwith other container runtimes through fully qualified container images.\n\nIn an official announcement, the team stated the importance of testing in the\ndevelopment process; new testing APIs have been introduced to assist in\ntesting Aspire applications, following a pattern similar to the\nWebApplicationFactory in ASP.NET Core.\n\n    \n    \n    using System.Net; namespace AspireApp.Tests; public class WebTests { [Fact] public async Task GetWebResourceRootReturnsOkStatusCode() { // Arrange var appHost = await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.CreateAsync<Projects.AspireApp_AppHost>(); await using var app = await appHost.BuildAsync(); await app.StartAsync(); // Act var httpClient = app.CreateHttpClient(\"webfrontend\"); var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(\"/\"); // Assert Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode); } }\n\n(Source: Microsoft Documentation)\n\nFurthermore, updates have been made to the latest stable versions of the\nOpenTelemetry SDK and Instrumentation packages to simplify the OTLP exporter\nconfiguration using newer APIs. As reported, this feature automates the\nconfiguration of the OTLP exporter, directing metrics, traces, and logs to the\ndesignated OTLP endpoint specified within the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT\nenvironment variable.\n\nAlso, regarding OpenTelemetry the dependencies on pre-release versions have\nbeen removed, and replaced with the latest stable versions wherever possible.\nAdditionally, the dependency on OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.EventCounters\nhas been removed.\n\nAzure provisioning packages have been restructured into individual packages\nper service, allowing for selective installation based on user requirements.\nUsers utilizing Azure provisioning packages directly, as stated are advised to\nupdate their project files to reference the new packages.\n\nThe Azure Developer CLI now supports deploying projects, containers, or docker\nfiles with multiple endpoints, which will be mapped to the Azure Container\nApp's ingress.\n\nFinally, it has been reported that the .NET Aspire team is dedicated to\nissuing a new preview edition each month, to achieve a stable 8.0 release by\nthe second quarter of 2024. This month developers could explore both Preview 5\nand Preview 6.\n\nMicrosoft has stated that these scheduled releases are intended to offer\ndevelopers consistent updates, incorporating new features and enhancements\nduring the ongoing development phase.\n\n## About the Author\n\n#### Almir Vuk\n\n\ud83d\udc4b Follow me for more .NET content!
