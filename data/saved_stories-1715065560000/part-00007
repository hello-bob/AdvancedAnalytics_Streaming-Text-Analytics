But an analysis of Facebook\ndata suggests engagement with posts from news organisations is already at an\nall-time low, as memes fill the space.\n\nMeta has argued that news makes up just 3% of what people engage with on its\nservices.\n\n\u2018Anti-democratic\u2019: Labor minister warns Facebook against removal of Australian\nnews content\n\nRead more\n\nAn analysis by Guardian Australia has determined that this appears to be by\ndesign, with Meta turning off the tap for news in the past few years.\n\nA study carried out in 2021 by researchers from the University of Technology\nSydney and RMIT looked at the amount of engagement with Facebook posts by\nAustralian news organisations over time.\n\nIt showed a decline in engagement between 2015 and November 2020, as well as a\ndecline in traffic from Facebook to news websites.\n\nGuardian Australia has updated this analysis, which shows that engagement with\nposts from Australian media is now at an all-time low, with the exception of\nthe brief period in February 2021 when Facebook blocked news posts in\nAustralia.\n\nThis drop in engagement and traffic was due at least in part to changes Meta\nmade to its algorithms, which resulted in less news being shown in the home\nfeed of Facebook users. But the UTS and RMIT analysis also shows some\npublishers changed their approaches to social media in response, focusing on\ndifferent sources of traffic, such as Google search.\n\nJames Meese, one of the RMIT researchers in the 2021 study, says the updated\nresearch shows that news on Facebook has continued to underperform on the\nplatform since 2017.\n\n\u201cAnother way to say underperformance is just to say that news on Facebook is\ndead,\u201d he says.\n\n  * Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\n\nHe says Meta has long been public about not being interested in news but that\nposition also affects whether people consume news on the platform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably a feedback loop here where Facebook deprioritises news,\ntherefore people see less news there, therefore potentially seek out news\nless,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSocial media and the internet more generally is a competitive space, so if\nFacebook aren\u2019t surfacing news, then people who look for news are likely to go\nelsewhere and the practices are going to change accordingly.\u201d\n\n## News engagement completely tanked\n\nIn a separate analysis, Guardian Australia categorised the top posts relevant\nto Australia on Facebook by total interaction, comparing the period of the\nnews ban with the week preceding it, as well as the same period in 2015 before\nany algorithmic changes that deprioritised news in home feeds (see below for\nfull details).\n\nThis analysis suggests that when news is removed from the platform in\nAustralian feeds it is replaced by more of the same content that was otherwise\nin the top 100 \u2013 namely memes and posts from content creators.\n\nThere is also a live experiment \u2013 Canada \u2013 that suggests what Australia might\nexperience if Meta pulls the plug on news again. Meta has banned news content\nin Canada since August in response to its legislation to force Meta to pay for\nnews.\n\nAengus Bridgman of the Centre for Media, Technology and Democracy in Canada\nsays smaller local news outlets have suffered from a reduction in engagement,\nwhile the platforms themselves have experienced little change.\n\n\u201cThe short story is, Facebook and Instagram are fine,\u201d he says. \u201cThey haven\u2019t\nreally seen a noticeable decrease in traffic.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Five Great Reads\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and\nthoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international\ncolleagues.

All of that\nlink traffic has disappeared. And it\u2019s been disastrous for them.\u201d\n\nNews outlets can continue to post on Facebook under the ban but it is not\nvisible to Canadian users. Links to Canadian news sites cannot be posted.\nBridgman has found politically focused Canadian groups that previously posted\nlinks have shifted to posting screenshots of news stories.\n\n\u201cThe political discussion has just continued on the platform. The news cycle\nstill drives engagement. Politicians and influential political personalities\nstill draw on the news ... But there\u2019s just none of that linking,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen users stopped being able to post news links in Canadian political groups,\nthey turned to screenshots of news articles. Photograph: Aengus Bridgman\n\nSome Canadian-based outlets such as the rightwing site Rebel News have adapted\nby focusing on global news and picking up traffic from outside Canada, he\nsays.\n\nSmaller publishers in Australia have warned that they would similarly be most\naffected by a Facebook news ban if Meta was designated under the news media\nbargaining code \u2013 meaning the company would be forced to negotiate with\npublishers and pay for news content on its platforms, or face fines of 10% of\nits annual Australian revenue.\n\nSome news organisations, such as Sky News Australia, have already tailored\ntheir online news output to appeal to audiences in the US and the UK.\n\nThe assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, last month said he was awaiting advice\nfrom Treasury and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission about the\neffect of changes on news outlets and the social platforms while considering\nwhether to designate Meta under the code.\n\nMeta has maintained its position that news is not the reason people use its\nservices, and has said \u201cglobal tech companies cannot solve the longstanding\nissues facing the news industry\u201d.\n\n## Notes\n\nGuardian Australia used Crowdtangle to export the top 100 posts by total\ninteractions for pages with an Australian admin, and the top 100 posts for\npages \u201crelevant to Australia\u201d. These datasets were combined for each time\nperiod, duplicates removed, posts in languages other than English removed, and\nthe content type of each page was manually assessed into categories. The final\nchart uses the percentage of posts in each category.\n\nThe time periods used were 18 February 2021 to 26 February 2021 for the \u201cnews\nban dates\u201d, then the same dates in 2015, 2021 and 2024, as well as the week\npreceding the news ban in 2021.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Meta\n  * Social media\n  * Australian media\n  * analysis\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
