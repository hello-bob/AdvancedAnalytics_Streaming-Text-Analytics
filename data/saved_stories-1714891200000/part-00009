Although the text is in Chinese (11\npages of small print in three columns), it is replete with scores of\nillustrations (mostly drawings of seals and seal impressions), and has a\nlengthy bibliography consisting of dozens of publications, mostly in European\nlanguages and again mostly about seals and their impressions.\n\nAbstract\n\nFrom the Akkadian Empire to the Neo-Assyrian Empire, new ethnic groups\ncontinued to enter and gain control over Mesopotamia. Political changes\nbrought about shifts in the religious system, causing the decline of the\nbelief in Anzu, the lion-headed eagle in Sumerian civilization. The image of\nAnzu underwent a transformation from a flying gryphon to a gryphon with the\ncharacteristics of eagle wings and talons. Its religious connotation also\ndeveloped in a negative direction, becoming a monster that causes a great\nflood or steals the book of life, requiring gods or heroes to overcome,\ncontrol, shoot. or subdue it. In the context of this era of changing beliefs,\nancient sacred beasts are seen as pseudo-beliefs that need to be overcome.\n\n[Key words] Anzusia, ancient beliefs, eagle worship, lion worship, personal\ngod\n\n(GT translation with modifications)\n\nDuring the first millennia BC and AD, we find parallel beliefs and images all\nthe way across Eurasia. One of the most conspicuous is the p\u00edxi\u016b \u8c94\u8c85 (Old\nSinitic [Zhengzhang)] /*bi qhu/). Not only do these hybrid creatures have an\nalien appearance, their binomial name sounds non-Sinitic. P\u00edxi\u016b \u8c94\u8c85 are\nimportant as architectural ornaments and stone sculpture (often monumental)\nalready from the Han period (202 BC\u20139 AD; 25\u2013220 AD) for their supposed\napotropaic properties.\n\nSee also b\u00ecxi\u00e9 \u8f9f\u90aa (\"a chimaera-like figure common in Chinese and Persian art\")\nand its homophone b\u00ecxi\u00e9 \u907f\u90aa (\"ward off evil spirits\").\n\nOlga Gorodetskaya is said to be a controversial figure in the PRC. Judging\nfrom the article surveyed above, it is not too hard to guess why. Below, let\nus take a look at a review of a major book of hers that reveals more aspects\nof her archeohistorical stance that might prove problematic for nationalistic\ninvestigators.\n\nJi\u0101ng Gu\u01cenghu\u012b \u59dc\u5e7f\u8f89, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 w\u00e9nm\u00edng de yu\u00e1nt\u00f3u sh\u00ec b\u011bif\u0101ng h\u00e1ish\u00ec n\u00e1nf\u0101ng\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u6587\u660e\u7684\u6e90\u5934\u662f\u5317\u65b9\u8fd8\u662f\u5357\u65b9\" (\"Is the origin of Chinese civilization in the north or the\nsouth?\"), Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 d\u00fash\u016b b\u00e0o \u300a \u4e2d\u534e\u8bfb\u4e66\u62a5 \u300b(12/4/13), 10:\n\nThe content of the 500,000-word book, Xia, Shang and Zhou: From Myth to\nHistorical Fact, before me is not as romantic as the title. The whole book is\nalmost a collection of archaeological briefings in recent decades, but the\nsystem of the book, the views and conclusions, are extremely explosive and\nshocking. I cannot specifically predict how many scholars will oppose or\nsupport its main points after the book is published, but it will undoubtedly\ncause huge repercussions and shocks in the academic world. Did ancient Chinese\ncivilization first originate in the Jianghan-Huaihe River Basin and then\nspread from south to north; or did it first originate in the Yellow River\nBasin and then spread from north to south? The view of this book is that it is\nthe former, which is very different from the traditional view, but it is true.\nIt is reasonable and well-founded. Scholarship prior to the Qing Dynasty's\nresearch on China's ancient history before the Western Zhou Dynasty was\nbasically based on a few handed-down documents such as Sima Qian's Historical\nRecords of the Han Dynasty. Historical Records begins with \"Basic Annals of\nthe Five Emperors\". The five emperors are Huangdi (Yellow Emperor), Zhuanxu,\nEmperor Ku, Yao, and Shun; the second is \"Benji of Xia\", which first talks\nabout Dayu; the third is \"Benji of Yin\". The centers of political activities\nof Yao, Shun, Xia, and Shang are generally considered to be in today's Shanxi\nand Henan. Thanks to the discovery and research of oracle bone inscriptions\nover the past hundred years, the academic community has gained a reliable\nunderstanding of the history of the Yin/Shang Dynasty. However, as for the\nhistory of the Xia Dynasty, the academic community is still at a loss due to\nthe lack of written evidence of the corresponding era.\n\nWhen the Erlitou site in Yanshi, Henan was excavated in the middle of the last\ncentury, academic circles defined it as an urban site from the Xia Dynasty to\nthe early Shang Dynasty. Such an ancient history research background makes\nscholars take it for granted that the spread path of China's ancient\ncivilization was from the north to the south. Later discovered sites in the\nYangtze River basin similar to the Erlitou culture were interpreted by\nscholars as the spread of Xia and Shang culture to the south. This book quotes\n[archeology official] Qiao Yu's opinions and puts forward a different view:\nresearch on the population and land utilization around Erlitou shows that the\npopulation and settlement density there have always been very thin, and the\nland utilization is also very low. Erlitou belongs to a farming culture. With\nenough farmland and residential areas, the agricultural society lacked the\nmotivation to expand outwards; there were not many weapons at the Erlitou\nsite, and there were no ethnic groups that made a living by war. How did they\nexpand their influence outwards?\n\nAfter the discovery of ancient city sites such as Qujialing and Shijiahe in\nHubei, the prototype of an ancient united city-state in the Han River Basin\nhas emerged. In other words, the Jianghan Plain had formed a complete national\ncivilization before the Bronze Age. The so-called \"Erlitou Culture\" is\nactually the cultural aspect produced by the Hanshui Civilization in the\nBronze Age and affected the Zhengluo area, mainly originating from the south.\nArcheology has proven that civilization in ancient China did not spread from\nnorth to south, but from south to north.\n\nThe legendary holy kings and heroes such as Yao, Shun, and Yu are the result\nof the merger of myths from different traditional sources. Shun and Yu were\nnot originally heroes born in the north. For example, Shun was called \"Lord of\nthe Xiang\" in The Songs of Chu, and his two wives were called \"Lady Xiang\".\nThey were all regarded as the gods of the Xiang River, and the Xiang River was\nthe the southern part of the Qujialing cultural range. Thr Historical Records\nsays that the ancestor of Chu came from Zhuanxu, while the Bamboo Chronicles\nrecords the genealogy of the holy king and says: \"Zhuanxu gave birth to Bo\nGun.\" Gun is the father of Dayu. In this way, Dayu was originally the ancestor\nand hero of the Chu people. . Huainanzi \"Benjing\" says: \"At the time of Shun,\nGonggong raised the flood...Shun then asked Yu to dredge the three rivers and\nfive lakes, open up Yique, guide the Xianjian, level the land, and so that the\nwaters could flow into the Eastern Sea.\" \"Three rivers\" and \"Five Lakes\" are\nnot northern scenery. In contrast, in the north, the risk of floods in the Wei\nand Fen river basins was very low. The climate in the middle reaches of the\nYellow River is quite dry, and there was an obvious tendency toward aridity in\nthe north during the Xia era. Therefore, it is difficult for Weifen or\nZhengluo areas to create the myth of water control. The author believes that\nthe center of political activities of the Xia Dynasty should be in the south.\nSpecifically, it is most likely to be in the Xia River in Hubei (see Shui Jing\nZhu (Annotations on the Classic of Waters), now named Changxia River.\nAccording to Shui Jing Zhu, the lower reaches of the Han River were all known\nas \"Xia River\"), and it was located in the Jianghan Plain. Many ancient cities\nin Qujialing and Shijiahe stood near the Xia River. In ancient times, due to\nthe topography, there were frequent floods here. Water control was in great\nneed, and the ancestors of Qujialing indeed had already devised the\nengineering system for water control was. In this case, why don\u2019t we regard\nthe city sites such as Dengjiawan or Jingnan Temple as the Xia Kingdom where\nDayu controlled water?\n\nThe author also proposes that among the civilizations before the Yin-Shang\nDynasty, there existed a pre-Chu civilization. Its scale, tradition and degree\nof nationalization were probably the highest and most glorious among all\nancient civilization groups at that time. This means that the cultural\ntradition of Chu should be older than that of other countries, especially\nearlier than the tradition of Shang and Zhou rulers who came from the north to\nthe south. So, why is the history we see today not like this? And the original\nhistory is missing? The author believes that the history handed down to the\nworld is often written by the victors, which is bound to be mixed with the\nideas based on the victors. The ideology of viewpoints even obscures the truth\nof the original history. The era when these handed down documents were written\nbegan in the Zhou Dynasty, and they were recorded using the characters of the\nYin and Zhou civilizations, so they must represent the position of the\nnorthern ethnic group from which the nobles of the Yin and Zhou Dynasties\ncame. Judging from the development process of various cultures in China, the\nnorthern ethnic groups developed later and their history is relatively young.\nFrom the Yin and Zhou dynasties, they gradually promoted the vast city-states\ninto a unified political power and became the so-called \"winners\" of history.\nTherefore, they also have the right to express history and can write a history\nthat promotes their own power and \"virtue\" and pass it down to the world. They\nborrowed the ancient myths of the southern ethnic groups and regarded Shun and\nYu as the holy kings of their own ethnic group. But even so, in the orthodox\nhistory centered on the north, there are still clues that allow us to discover\nthat the ancient south was actually civilized earlier than the north. In other\nwords, although the mythology we generally recognize today seems to be a\nunified history at first glance, in fact, the original source of each mythical\nstory and sacred hero in it is probably the result of the intersection and\nmerging of the sacred histories of many different ethnic groups.\n\nThe above is the main line and theme of this book. Although these views are\nbold and shocking, they are not whimsical arguments, but are put forward by\nwhat I think is a serious and rigorous academic work. After this book is\npublished, it will inevitably be criticized or criticized, and it may even be\n\"beaten black and blue\", but I believe that this book will become an immortal\nhistorical masterpiece. In the past hundred years of Chinese historical\nresearch, our academic community has been lacking this kind of historical\nresearch works that combine dense data with big thinking methods. Its\nsignificance is not mainly whether the conclusions in the book are completely\nconsistent with historical reality, but that in the face of those cultural\nrelics without written records, we cannot only use the limited handed down\ndocuments as the frame of reference for interpreting them, but should rely on\nthe hard work of the historian to interpret them. The hard work of the author\nhas created a new frame of reference that is helpful for analyzing\npossibilities.\n\nWe should not only use the limited number of handed down documents as a frame\nof reference for interpreting [the archeologically recovered cultural relics],\nbut should rely on the hard work of historians to create a new frame of\nreference for them that is conducive to the analysis of possibilities.\n\n(GT translation with modifications)\n\n(citation courtesy of Petya Andreeva)\n\nBoth the dispersal of the winged lion across Eurasia and the radical\nreenvisioning of the development of Chinese history as having much more to do\nwith the south than traditional accounts would have it possess important\nimplications for future research on East Asian civilization and language. It\nwill take many years to reassess these new insights. Meanwhile, they have\nalready helped me understand better problems that have puzzled me for decades,\nsuch as why the first poet in Chinese history known by name (Qu Yuan [339-278\nBC]) came from the south, why the vast majority of archeologically recovered\nclassical period manuscripts have been recovered in the south (esp. Chu), why\nthe founder of the epochal Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), Liu Bang (256-195 BC),\nand his closest competitor, Xiang Yu (232-202 BC), in defeating the brief\n(221-207 BC) eponymous (for \"China\") far (over 1,000 km) northwestern, semi-\nbarbarian Qin dynasty \u02a3\u0259\u0272 \u79e6 (Old Sinitic Minimal [OSM] reconstructed\npronunciation) were both from the same southern state of Chu where the first\nSinitic / Hannic poet came from.\n\nPerhaps we should henceforth refer to \"China\" (< Qin) as \"Tshraq\" (OSM of\n\"Chu\").
