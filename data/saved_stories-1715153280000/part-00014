External CD/DVD drive - $10.48 How much I saved on Temu\n\nHere's what I got for my $100 budget.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nBy now, we all know we can get inexpensive merchandise from Temu. But what\nabout tech? Can we save money ordering some of the more generic tech devices\nfrom Temu? And what is the quality like?\n\nAlso: Is Temu legit? Everything to know before you place your first order\n\nTo find out, I gave myself a $100 budget. Temu provides free shipping once an\norder gets over $10, so I placed a single order, which came to a total of\n$99.77 and got free shipping. Here's a quick summary of everything I got for\nthat amount, a total of 18 individual items:\n\n  * Wireless mouse\n  * Turtle-shaped wired mouse\n  * USB 2.0 3-port mini hub\n  * TWS wireless earbuds\n  * Keyboard and mouse set\n  * HD webcam\n  * PCIe USB 3.0 card\n  * Screwdriver pen toolkit\n  * USB C SD card reader\n\n|\n\n  * USB tester\n  * Electronic writing tablet\n  * Rotating tablet stand\n  * HDMI capture interface\n  * Handheld electronic game\n  * 32GB thumb drive\n  * 32GB microSD card\n  * 5-port USB charging hub\n  * External CD/DVD drive\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \nTemu functions as a marketplace for individual vendors, much like Amazon\nMarketplace. As such, product availability and price fluctuate constantly on\nTemu. A product available one week could be gone by the next. One troubling\ndiscovery I made when putting together this article was that the overall\npricing from the day I placed my order to the day I completed writing the\narticle went up about 13%.\n\nAlso: I tried to return something to Temu. Here's what happened\n\nFor each item I describe below, I'm listing both the original price and the\nprice four weeks later. I'm also listing equivalent Amazon products, which are\nproducts that are as close as possible to the products Temu sells. Stay tuned\nto the end of the article where I will show you how much this hundred dollar\nhaul would have cost had it been purchased on Amazon.\n\nAnd now, let's dig in.\n\n## 1\\. Wireless mouse - $2.11\n\n### Spend so far - $2.11\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $2.11\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $2.47\n  * Amazon equivalent: $1.99 + $6.99 delivery\n\nPackage condition.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis Temu wireless mouse is a basic, bare-bones wireless mouse. It\ncommunicates to a computer using a USB 3 dongle. It's extremely light weight,\nand takes two AAA batteries. But it works and does its job.\n\nAmazon does offer a number of very inexpensive mice, including those available\nfor a penny. But they all include a shipping charge. The least expensive I\nfound, including the shipping charge, was this one for a total of $8.98 (even\nif you have Prime, as I do). Temu does charge for shipping, but if your order\nexceeds ten bucks, it's free.\n\n## 2\\. Turtle-shaped wired mouse - $3.39\n\n### Spend so far - $5.50\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $3.39\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $3.97\n  * Amazon equivalent: $12.99\n\nPackaging.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis turtle-shaped wired mouse is a mouse, shaped like a turtle. There's not\nmuch more to say, except did I mention it's a mouse shaped like a turtle? It\nplugs into your computer over USB 3, doesn't require batteries, and is very\ngreen. And it does work.\n\nAmazon offers a turtle-shaped wired mouse that clearly uses the same molds,\nfor $12.99. There are also a number of vendors offering the same green mouse\ncolor and exactly the same mold, but in a wireless version, ranging from in\nprice from $12.73 to $15.93.\n\n## 3\\. USB 2.0 3-port mini hub - $3.98\n\n### Spend so far - $9.48\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $3.98\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $3.98\n  * Amazon equivalent: $5.12\n\nHub packaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis USB hub/splitter is kind of a worthless purchase. The Temu site doesn't\nspecify that this is for USB 2.0 devices, but it is. That said, it works fine\nwith a mouse and does well as a charging connection if you only have one USB\nport.\n\nIt spins, and fits nicely on the side of the two laptops I tested it with.\nDurability is always a question, and I'm guessing if you spin the connector\ntoo many times, it'll stop working. Amazon has an equivalent device, but the\nAmazon listing says it's USB 2.0 right in the title.\n\nWhile it's not exactly misrepresentation, I consider the Temu listing\nmisleading, and call this purchase a disappointment, even for less than four\nbucks.\n\n## 4\\. TWS wireless earbuds - $2.98\n\n### Spend so far - $12.46\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $2.98\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $2.97\n  * Amazon equivalent: $7.99\n\nPackaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nFor three bucks, I mean, okay. These wireless earbuds work. They don't suck\n(mostly). Sound quality is surprisingly good, as long as you're not looking\nfor pounding bass. Bluetooth connectivity works, but only under about five\nfeet. Whenever I got about five feet away from my computer or phone, they\ndropped the connection. They charge using a micro USB connection, but do not\ninclude a cable.\n\nAmazon has a fairly large offering of super cheap earbuds, but they all have\nshipping between $6.99 and $10.99. I found a fairly nice set for $7.99 with\nfree Prime shipping. These are actually a step up from the Temu buds, with a\ncase that provides charging data.\n\nAlso: The best budget earbuds of 2024\n\nThe bottom line on the $3 Temu set is this: if you're using it with your\nphone, which you keep with you, they're really not bad. If you intend to be\nany distance at all from the Bluetooth connection, they'll drop or annoy you\nwith a constantly intermittent connection. But hey, for $3 and tolerably good\nsound quality, what's to complain about?\n\n## 5\\. Wireless keyboard and mouse set - $5.26\n\n### Spend so far - $17.72\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $5.26\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $8.35\n  * Amazon equivalent: $20.97\n\nKeyboard and mouse packaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nFor a little over five bucks, this wireless keyboard and mouse is a pretty\nnice set. I am a fan of thin, lightweight, chicklet keyboards, but some people\ndislike them intensely. This is a very lightweight keyboard that connects over\nbluetooth, as does the mouse. The mouse uses disposable batteries, while the\nkeyboard charges over USB.\n\nThe price variances are interesting here. Four weeks later, the keyboard went\nup measurably in price. It comes in three other colors: baby blue, black, and\nwhite. Each of them is more expensive than the rather (to me) ugly pink. But\nfor five bucks, pink is fine. The exact same product appears to be on Amazon,\nand there it's priced at over $20. I'm not sure this set is worth $20, but\nit's actually quite nice for what it cost. Bluetooth works, but it is very\nrange-limited, 3 or 4 feet at best.\n\n## 6\\. HD webcam - $6.56\n\n### Spend so far - $24.28\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $6.56\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $6.55\n  * Amazon equivalent: $5.99 + $6.99 delivery\n\nWebcam packaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis little webcam is a happy little purchase. To be clear, it's no Logitech,\nbut the image quality for a 1080p camera isn't bad, it's responsive, and it\nworked right out of the box. It has a folding grip for the top of a monitor,\nand, as a very nice little plus, you can rotate the camera itself on a ball\njoint to aim it just right.\n\nThe only thing really missing is a 1/4\"-20 mount on the bottom to mount it to\na tripod or other photo-related grip gear. To be fair, many webcams I've used\nover the years have also lacked that mount.\n\nAlso: The best webcams for streaming\n\nAmazon has what appears to be the exact same webcam for 57 cents less --\nexcept you also have to pay $6.99 shipping. The Amazon product is not Prime\neligible.\n\n## 7\\. PCIe USB 3.0 expansion card - $8.79\n\n### Spend so far - $33.07\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $8.79\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $8.79\n  * Amazon equivalent: $21.79\n\nUSB card packaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nIf you want to add more USB ports to your PC build, this card will certainly\nget you there. Unlike most of the other items in this article, I didn't\npersonally test this board. My PC is humming perfectly and I don't want to\nopen it up. But the reviews on Temu are quite positive, as long as you follow\nthis one guideline: \"Hook it up to a 15-pin SATA power cable for it to work.\"\n\nThere are a lot of similar USB expansion cards available on Amazon, and many\nof them are starting to mix USB 3.0 and USB C. But I did find one that looks\nvery similar to the unit on Temu, with some minor component differences.\nAmazon will ship the board for free, but at $21.79 as of the time of writing,\nit still clocks in at more than twice the price.\n\n## 8\\. Screwdriver pen toolkit - $1.69\n\n### Spend so far - $34.76\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $1.69\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $1.98\n  * Amazon equivalent: $7.99\n\nScrewdriver packaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis thing qualifies as a must-buy. It's a little tiny screwdriver set for\nunder two bucks. All the screw heads fit inside the body of the screwdriver.\nThe body of the screwdriver is fairly well-machined, as are the screw heads.\nMy only complaint is that the chuck (or bit holder) isn't terribly robust. It\ndoes hold the bits in use, but it is likely to break at some point.\n\nBut let me reiterate: this is under two dollars. For that price, you can buy\nfour of them, put one in your glove compartment, one in a kitchen junk drawer,\none in your toolkit, and one in your office desk. You'll always have a tiny\nscrewdriver around when you need one.\n\nAlso: The best electric screwdrivers\n\nThe Amazon equivalent, which looks to be the exact same item, is $7.99 with\nPrime shipping. I mentioned you can get four of these sets from Temu because\nthe Temu price is less than a quarter that of the Amazon price.\n\n## 9\\. USB C SD card reader - $1.35\n\n### Spend so far - $36.11\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $1.35\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $1.83\n  * Amazon equivalent: $12.99\n\nPackaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis little gadget sports an SD card slot, Micro SD card slot, and USB 3.0\nport, and connects to your computer over USB C. I tried this with all three\nmedia types and it worked. However, I'm fairly sure it's not using the full\nperformance capacity of the USB 3.0 or USB C interface. I used a USB 3.0 thumb\ndrive that's quite fast plugged directly into my Mac Studio, but when\ntransferring through this interface, it was fairly sluggish. On the other\nhand, what do you expect for $1.35?\n\nAmazon has an equivalent device in white. Temu also offers a white version,\nwhich turns out to be twenty cents or so less than the black version. It was\nmore expensive when I placed my order last month.\n\n## 10\\. USB tester - $4.98\n\n### Spend so far - $41.09\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $4.98\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $4.98\n  * Amazon equivalent: $6.59\n\nPackaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis little USB charging tester could not be easier to use. You plug it into a\nsource of power (I'm using my laptop here), and then plug in the device you\nwant to charge. The device reports voltage and current, as well as accumulated\ncurrent and total running time. This can help you determine if the USB power\nbrick or port is providing enough juice for the device you're trying to use.\nThere's also a reset button, which clears the cumulative data on the device.\n\nAmazon offers a seemingly identical device with a different color plastic\nshell. Amazon's price is only about a dollar and a half more than the Temu\nprice, and it's available for free shipping via Prime. This is another product\nthat does what it says it will do, no more and no less.\n\n## 11\\. Don't buy this tablet - $13.16\n\n### Spend so far - $54.25\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $13.16\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $15.48\n  * Amazon equivalent: $20.69\n\nThe packaging is the best part of this thing.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nI am personally offended this product even exists. It's the single most\nexpensive thing I bought in this Temu haul. It's like an Etch A Sketch gone\nhorribly, horribly wrong. It's a digital tablet with no output. You write on\nit, and you erase what you write. That is all. You write on it. You can't save\nwhat you write. You can't upload it to your computer or phone. You can't\ncreate more than one screen's worth of writing. You can't change the\nbrightness or contrast of the annoyingly dim screen.\n\nThe erase feature doesn't work all that well and leaves residue from all the\nother times you wrote on it. On top of all that, the battery is nearly\nimpossible to remove. The tablet is glued into its case, which is styled to\nlook like one of the original iPad cases. But it's not an iPad. It's an iSuck.\n\nAlso: The best tablets of 2024\n\nAmazon shockingly sells the same model, normally listed at an insane-for-this-\ngarbage $28.99, discounted on the day I looked to $20.69. If you want to know\nhow little the sellers themselves even care about it, take a look at the\nAmazon link. The clip art image they use of a computer in the scene (remember,\nthis doesn't work with a computer) says \"Mockup.\" I think it should say\n\"Mockery.\"\n\nOddly enough, this thing has a ton of positive reviews on both Temu and\nAmazon. It's still terrible. Don't buy it.\n\n## 12\\. Rotating tablet stand - $10.98\n\n### Spend so far - $65.23\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $10.98\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $13.49\n  * Amazon equivalent: $26.99\n\nPackaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nAs bad as that bizarre writing tablet was is as good as this tablet stand is.\nThis is every bit a top-tier quality tablet stand. It's made of strong metal\n(probably some aluminum alloy), is nice and firm when it opens, and has a nice\nrotating base. As long as you angle it a bit, it supports full-sized tablets\nlike the iPad Pro. And it folds down easily, so you can carry it with you. I\nlike it a lot.\n\nAmazon appears to sell the same model, for roughly twice the price (although\nthere's a 40% off coupon right now). This is where Temu shines. Sure, you can\nget the Amazon unit in one day with Prime, but if you're willing to wait a\nweek and a half or so, you can get away with paying half, or as I did, less\nthan half the price.\n\n## 13\\. HDMI to USB 2.0 video capture interface - $5.98\n\n### Spend so far - $71.21\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $5.98\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $5.98\n  * Amazon equivalent: $8.99\n\nPackaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis is an HDMI video capture interface, useful for bringing in content from a\nDSLR camera, a DVD player, or a gaming console. The device itself does not\ncome with any video software, but it works well enough with OBS. When I\nconnected my camera, I didn't see any apparent frame loss, but that's not\nsaying much when you're just bringing in room video or a talking head.\nEssentially, if you're not all that demanding, the USB 2.0 interface is good\nenough.\n\nWhat's not good enough is the matching Amazon offering. While the title of the\nproduct on Amazon says it's an \"HD 1080P USB Capture Card,\" the body copy says\nit \"captures 4K@60Hz video input at full speed, no lag, no delay.\" No. No, it\ndoesn't. There is no way you're capturing 4K video over USB 2.0 without\ndropping at least 75% of the frames.\n\nPoints to Temu for not claiming it's any more than it is, and a finger wag at\nAmazon for claiming it can do something that the physics of the universe make\nimpossible.\n\n## 14\\. Handheld electronic game - $2.94\n\n### Spend so far - $74.15\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $2.94\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $3.81\n  * Amazon equivalent: $15.80\n\nPackaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nTemu promotes this as a \"Handheld Switch Game.\" Now, quite obviously, this\nisn't a Switch console, but for under $3, nobody expects it to be. I can\ndefinitely see the reasoning though. Grandpa asks Junior what he wants as a\ngift, and Junior says \"A Nintendo Switch.\" Grandpa goes to Temu, types in\nSwitch, sees this thing and thinks, \"Hmm, three bucks. Let's get Junior this.\nAfter all, the little tyke never calls or writes anyway.\" SEO, FTW.\n\nAnd, you know what? It's worth every one of its 294 pennies. It comes with\n\"26\" games -- most of which are variations of each other. But somewhere in\nthere (game J) there's a credible Tetris clone that's fairly fun to play. This\nis a novelty that's not terribly novel, especially since all our smartphones\nare physically bigger, have gorgeous backlit color screens (this isn't\nbacklit), and you can download and play all the Candy Crush you want. But hey,\nit's a product.\n\nAs for the Amazon version of the product, at least it doesn't claim it's a\nSwitch. On the other hand, it promotes the product as suitable to wean kids\naway from their phones, and to \"exercise the elderly's reaction speed and\nmemory, delaying the aging speed of the brain.\" You can't make this stuff up.\n\n## 15\\. 32GB USB 3.0 and USB C thumb drive - $2.54\n\n### Spend so far - $76.69\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $2.54\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $3.98\n  * Amazon equivalent: $7.87\n\nPackaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nHere we have a basic 32GB thumb drive. What I quite like about it is that it\ncomes with both a USB 3.0 port and a USB C port, so it can be used on some of\nmy laptops that have only USB C ports, as well as my machines equipped with\nUSB 3.0. Beyond that, there's nothing to write home about. Transfer speed is\nadequate, but it's certainly not maxing out the bandwidth that USB C provides.\nBut it works, it passes basic storage tests, and what else can you ask for\nsomething that's under $3?\n\nThere are Amazon thumb drives that cost less than this one, but none of them\nare Prime-eligible. As such, while you may spend a buck on the drive, you're\nbeing asked to spend eight dollars on shipping. This drive seems functionally\nequivalent and echos all of the physical design notes, so it's my guess they\nare the same basic device.\n\n## 16\\. Kodak brand 32GB microSD card - $4.98\n\n### Spend so far - $81.67\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $4.98\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $6.29\n  * Amazon equivalent: $9.99\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis is a Kodak-branded microSD card. Kodak, once the towering sovereign of\nfilm photography, now licenses its name to many manufacturers. So exactly who\nmakes this card is something of a mystery. That said, it worked in my camera\nand in the drone to record video, so it's good enough.\n\nInterestingly, the Temu variant is a UHS-1 U3 card, which is spec'd to\ntransfer data at 30 MB/s. The more expensive Amazon variant is actually a\nUHS-1 U1, which is only spec'd for data transfer at 10 MB/s.\n\n## 17\\. 5-port USB charging hub - $7.62\n\n### Spend so far - $89.29\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $7.62\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $8.48\n  * Amazon equivalent: $10.75 (used)\n\nPackage\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis little 25W USB charging hub does a nice job of charging up multiple\ndevices. It's extremely lightweight, so you need to hold it with one hand when\nunplugging or plugging anything in. It's not a rapid charger, having taken\nalmost 3 hours to fully charge my iPad from completely out of juice. That\nsaid, I like the form factor, it comes with a power cord, and you can't beat\nthe price.\n\nAmazon does offer an identical unit but it's only available in a used model.\nAs you might imagine, Amazon does offer plenty of USB charging hubs, generally\nranging from ten dollars and up.\n\n## 18\\. External CD/DVD drive - $10.48\n\n### Spend so far - $99.77\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\n  * What I paid: $10.48\n  * Temu price 4 weeks later: $10.03\n  * Amazon equivalent: $19.99\n\nPackaging\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nAll that brings us to our last item in our giant Temu haul, an external CD/DVD\nplayer. As it turns out, this is also a burner, although since I didn't have\nany DVD-RW blanks, I didn't test that part of its functionality. As a DVD\nplayer, what can I say? It loaded commercial DVDs and played them back. What\nelse do you want for under eleven bucks? The Temu player came with both a USB\ncable to connect to a computer as well as a USB cable for power (although I\nfound no need for the second cable).\n\nAlso: How to play old DVDs on your modern Apple M-series Mac\n\nI have to say that the drive from Temu looks almost identical to the $19.99\nGotega drive I bought last year from Amazon. I've been very happy with that\ndrive. We've purchased a number of old science fiction TV series that aren't\navailable via streaming, and it's been fun to watch them using the DVD player.\nIt was something of a no-brainer to get the retro player at twenty bucks, but\nfor slightly over ten dollars, it's clearly an easy win.\n\n## How much I saved on Temu\n\nOverall, I was somewhat pleased with the general quality of the items Temu\nsent me. None of them could be considered top-tier items, but there were only\ntwo that I'd consider terrible: the USB 2.0 switch that wasn't marketed as USB\n2.0, and the bizarre writing tablet that didn't do anything right. Otherwise,\neverything worked fairly well.\n\nI mean, a wireless mouse for $2? A keyboard and mouse set for under $6?\nThere's not much to complain about there.\n\nAlso: Temu vs. Amazon: Which shopping site is best for your buying needs?\n\nI spent $99.77 for the entire haul. Had I placed that same order today, it\nwould have cost me $113.37. Temu's prices went up by 13%. Even so, that's\nnothing compared to the $239.46 that it would have cost to order the same\nitems on Amazon. Temu is quite literally less than half the price. And most of\nthe gear performs as advertised.\n\nWhat do you think? Will this change your mind about Temu? Have you ordered\nfrom Temu before? What do you think? Did you get what you expected? Were the\ndeals good? How was the quality? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.
