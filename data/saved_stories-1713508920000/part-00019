The ruling\ndoes not apply to all cases in which biometrics are used to unlock an\nelectronic device but is a significant decision in an unsettled area of the\nlaw.\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had to grapple with the question\nof \"whether the compelled use of Payne's thumb to unlock his phone was\ntestimonial,\" the ruling in United States v. Jeremy Travis Payne said. \"To\ndate, neither the Supreme Court nor any of our sister circuits have addressed\nwhether the compelled use of a biometric to unlock an electronic device is\ntestimonial.\"\n\nA three-judge panel at the 9th Circuit ruled unanimously against Payne,\naffirming a US District Court's denial of Payne's motion to suppress evidence.\nPayne was a California parolee who was arrested by California Highway Patrol\n(CHP) after a 2021 traffic stop and charged with possession with intent to\ndistribute fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, and cocaine.\n\nThere was a dispute in District Court over whether a CHP officer \"forcibly\nused Payne's thumb to unlock the phone.\" But for the purposes of Payne's\nappeal, the government \"accepted the defendant's version of the facts, i.e.,\n'that defendant's thumbprint was compelled.'\"\n\nPayne's Fifth Amendment claim \"rests entirely on whether the use of his thumb\nimplicitly related certain facts to officers such that he can avail himself of\nthe privilege against self-incrimination,\" the ruling said. Judges rejected\nhis claim, holding \"that the compelled use of Payne's thumb to unlock his\nphone (which he had already identified for the officers) required no cognitive\nexertion, placing it firmly in the same category as a blood draw or\nfingerprint taken at booking.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When Officer Coddington used Payne's thumb to unlock his phone\u2014which he could\nhave accomplished even if Payne had been unconscious\u2014he did not intrude on the\ncontents of Payne's mind,\" the court also said.\n\n## Suspect\u2019s mental process is key\n\nPayne conceded that \"the use of biometrics to open an electronic device is\nakin to providing a physical key to a safe\" but argued it is still a\ntestimonial act because it \"simultaneously confirm[s] ownership and\nauthentication of its contents,\" the court said. \"However, Payne was never\ncompelled to acknowledge the existence of any incriminating information. He\nmerely had to provide access to a source of potential information.\"\n\nThe appeals court cited two Supreme Court rulings in cases involving the US\ngovernment. In Doe v. United States in 1988, the government compelled a person\nto sign forms consenting to disclosure of bank records relating to accounts\nthat the government already knew about. The Supreme Court \"held that this was\nnot a testimonial production, reasoning that the signing of the forms related\nno information about existence, control, or authenticity of the records that\nthe bank could ultimately be forced to produce,\" the 9th Circuit said.\n\nIn United States v. Hubbell in 2000, a subpoena compelled a suspect to produce\n13,120 pages of documents and records and respond \"to a series of questions\nthat established that those were all of the documents in his custody or\ncontrol that were responsive to the commands in the subpoena.\" The Supreme\nCourt ruled against the government, as the 9th Circuit explained:\n\n> The Court held that this act of production was of a fundamentally different\n> kind than that at issue in Doe because it was \"unquestionably necessary for\n> respondent to make extensive use of 'the contents of his own mind' in\n> identifying the hundreds of documents responsive to the requests in the\n> subpoena.\" The \"assembly of those documents was like telling an inquisitor\n> the combination to a wall safe, not like being forced to surrender the key\n> to a strongbox.\" Thus, the dividing line between Doe and Hubbell centers on\n> the mental process involved in a compelled act, and an inquiry into whether\n> that act implicitly communicates the existence, control, or authenticity of\n> potential evidence.\n\n#### reader comments\n\n126\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
