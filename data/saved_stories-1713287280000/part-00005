As a\nbroadsheet published in June of that year records, a bloody, fiery ray\nbisected the sun, followed by a clash between cavalry \u2014 each side bearing\nguidons. War raged for hours, and then, as suddenly as they appeared, the\ncombatants trotted off into the clouds. Seven years later, this time in\nNuremberg, the Bavarian horizon was blotted out by an extraterrestrial\nskirmish between unidentified orbs. \u201cThe globes flew back and forth among\nthemselves and fought vehemently with each other for over an hour\u201d, wrote the\nbroadsheet\u2019s author. Some of these vehicles crashed down beyond the city\nlimits, while a terrifying, arrow-like object appeared in the air. \u201cWhatever\nsuch signs mean, God alone knows.\u201d\n\nThese were not isolated incidents. German broadsheets in the Holy Roman Empire\nconveyed all kinds of wondrous phenomena through woodcuts: \u201canomalies in the\nsun, moon, stars . . . stones and fire falling from the sky, rainbows,\nmiraculous births, rains of blood\u201d, tracks Daniela Wagner. Unexplainable\nevents happened so frequently that they were christened Wunderzeichen, wonder-\nsigns. Between 1550 and 1559 alone, there were more than four hundred\nbroadsheets and tracts published that recorded these prognostic events. The\nphenomena were also preserved in news pamphlets, astrological literature,\nsermons, scientific treatises, correspondence, personal diaries, and \u201cwonder\nbooks\u201d, broadsheets bound into a single volume.\n\nFor many readers in this period, encounters with these reports and images were\nsigns that the end was nigh. Although apocalypticism was not a novel concept,\nit gained newfound intensity during the Reformation. \u201cBy 1560\u201d, writes Robin\nBruce Barnes, \u201c[clerical] attention to the unusual had become nothing less\nthan an obsession\u201d. New Protestant translations of the Bible rendered the Book\nof Revelation in particularly dramatic terms, while Luther and his acolytes\nencouraged followers to look upward and augur the future. \u201cWe see the Sun to\nbe darkened and the Moon, the stars to fall, men to be distressed, all the\nwinds and waters to make a noise\u201d, he preached during a sermon about the\nSecond Coming. \u201cHow many other Signs also, and unusual impressions, have we\nseen in the Heavens, in the Sun, Moon, Stars, Rain-bows and strange\nApparitions, in these last four years?\u201d Far from folk superstition, the belief\nin Wunderzeichen as portents of the Last Judgment was shot through with\neschatology. Philip Melanchthon (1497\u20131560), who systematized Luther\u2019s\ntheology, saw these scenes painted across the sky as communications from God:\n\n> For if these signs are not meant to be considered, why are they written and\n> painted on the sky by divine providence? Since God has engraved these marks\n> in the sky in order to announce great upheavals for the states, it is\n> impiety to turn one\u2019s mind away from their observation. What are eclipses,\n> conjunctions, portents, meteors or comets if not oracles of God which\n> threaten great calamities and changes for the life of men?\n\nScroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.

Ingesting these crops produced delirium,\nhallucinations of fire and religious fervor. Drugs aside, the skies were alive\nwith astronomical wonder, which was ripe for interpretation in even the\nsoberest eyes. Northern lights streaked across the horizon like blood. Solar\nhalos, sun dogs, and light pillars were frequent and mysterious. A 1556 comet\nwas widely reported across Europe and Asia, spotted by awe-eyed observers from\nBritain to China. And each shooting star further unfolded a narrative of\nreligious reformation. One broadsheet published in Nuremberg during May of\nthat same year, for example, depicts Constantinople\u2019s Hagia Sophia as damaged\nby an earthquake. It did not surprise readers that this destruction occurred\nalongside the appearance of a comet: eliding Islam with Catholicism, the text\nsuggests that \u201cthe papacy\u2014polemically identified as the Roman Antichrist\u2014will\nalso get its desserts\u201d, writes Jennifer Spinks.\n\nJust as Victorian encounters with ghosts surged after the invention of\nphotography, media technologies also played a part in propagating these\nsixteenth-century visions. Most of the images below come from Einblattdruck, a\nform of broadsheet that consisted of a title, woodcut, and an account of\nwonder. These sheets could be created rapidly, disseminated widely, and\npurchased cheaply. News and current events were thus being printed with\ngreater speed and reach than ever before. As such, genres evolved and\nhybridized with haste. In the early 1520s, so-called \u201csiege prints\u201d \u2014 graphic\ntableaux of battles \u2014 became particularly popular. And astronomical almanacs\nwere some of the most widely consumed vernacular texts in the Holy Roman\nEmpire. Is it any surprise, then, that battles between stars started appearing\nin the skies, wedding these two genres, evidenced by woodcuts of astrological\nsiege? The art historian Aby Warburg \u2014 puzzled why, in the midst of the\nReformation, a seemingly new form of paganism flourished \u2014 concluded that\n\u201castral deities . . . enjoyed a peripatetic Renaissance, in words and\npictures, thanks to the new printing houses of Augsburg, Nuremberg, and\nLeipzig\u201d.\n\nThe observance of celestial phenomena tapered off in the seventeenth century \u2014\nas the doom foretold by the heavens finally came to Earth in the form of the\nThirty Years\u2019 War. Strangely enough, in the eighteenth century, very similar\nsigns appeared in the skies over Riga, which deeply influenced a certain\nprinter in Philadelphia\u2019s views of revolution.
