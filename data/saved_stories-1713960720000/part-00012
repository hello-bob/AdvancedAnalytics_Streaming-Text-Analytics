I want to share these\nresults with you today, hope you like them!\n\nThey don\u2019t have the sophisticated mask effect but I like the results,\nespecially when paired with a grainy background:\n\nAnimating filters can be a bit heavy on some machines so this is not perfect\nof course. But used in moderation on small texts can really contribute to nice\nvisuals!\n\nIf you play with the initial values, you can create some interesting looks:\n\nEnjoy and bring it to the next level!\n\nThanks for checking by.\n\nSome On-Scroll Text Highlight Animations\n\nTagged with: blur scroll typography\n\n### Manoela Ilic\n\nManoela is the main tinkerer at Codrops.
