The researchers determined that the rocks\nare about 3.7 billion years old and retain signatures of a magnetic field with\na strength of at least 15 microtesla. The ancient field is similar in\nmagnitude to the Earth\u2019s magnetic field today.\n\nThe open-access findings, appearing in the Journal of Geophysical Research,\nrepresent some of the earliest evidence of a magnetic field surrounding the\nEarth. The results potentially extend the age of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field by\nhundreds of millions of years, and may shed light on the planet\u2019s early\nconditions that helped life take hold.\n\n\u201cThe magnetic field is, in theory, one of the reasons we think Earth is really\nunique as a habitable planet,\u201d says Claire Nichols, a former MIT postdoc who\nis now an associate professor of the geology of planetary processes at Oxford\nUniversity. \u201cIt\u2019s thought our magnetic field protects us from harmful\nradiation from space, and also helps us to have oceans and atmospheres that\ncan be stable for long periods of time.\u201d\n\nPrevious studies have shown evidence for a magnetic field on Earth that is at\nleast 3.5 billion years old. The new study is extending the magnetic field\u2019s\nlifetime by another 200 million years.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important because that\u2019s the time when we think life was emerging,\u201d\nsays Benjamin Weiss, the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Planetary Sciences in\nMIT\u2019s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). \u201cIf the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field was around a few hundred million years earlier, it\ncould have played a critical role in making the planet habitable.\u201d\n\nNichols and Weiss are co-authors of the new study, which also includes Craig\nMartin and Athena Eyster at MIT, Adam Maloof at Princeton University, and\nadditional colleagues from institutions including Tufts University and the\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder.\n\nA slow churn\n\nToday, the Earth\u2019s magnetic field is powered by its molten iron core, which\nslowly churns up electric currents in a self-generating \u201cdynamo.\u201d The\nresulting magnetic field extends out and around the planet like a protective\nbubble. Scientists suspect that, early in its evolution, the Earth was able to\nfoster life, in part due to an early magnetic field that was strong enough to\nretain a life-sustaining atmosphere and simultaneously shield the planet from\ndamaging solar radiation.\n\nExactly how early and robust this magnetic shield was is up for debate, though\nthere has been evidence dating its existence to about 3.5 billion years ago.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to see if we could extend this record back beyond 3.5 billion years\nand nail down how strong that early field was,\u201d Nichols says.\n\nIn 2018, as a postdoc working in Weiss\u2019 lab at the time, Nichols and her team\nset off on an expedition to the Isua Supracrustal Belt, a 20-mile stretch of\nexposed rock formations surrounded by towering ice sheets in the southwest of\nGreenland. There, scientists have discovered the oldest preserved rocks on\nEarth, which have been extensively studied in hopes of answering a slew of\nscientific questions about Earth\u2019s ancient conditions.\n\nFor Nichols and Weiss, the objective was to find rocks that still held\nsignatures of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field when the rocks first formed. Rocks\nform through many millions of years, as grains of sediment and minerals\naccumulate and are progressively packed and buried under subsequent deposition\nover time. Any magnetic minerals such as iron-oxides that are in the deposits\nfollow the pull of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field as they form. This collective\norientation, and the imprint of the magnetic field, are preserved in the\nrocks.\n\nHowever, this preserved magnetic field can be scrambled and completely erased\nif the rocks subsequently undergo extreme thermal or aqueous events such as\nhydrothermal activity or plate tectonics that can pressurize and crush up\nthese deposits. Determining the age of a magnetic field in ancient rocks has\ntherefore been a highly contested area of study.\n\nTo get to rocks that were hopefully preserved and unaltered since their\noriginal deposition, the team sampled from rock formations in the Isua\nSupracrustal Belt, a remote location that was only accessible by helicopter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about 150 kilometers away from the capital city, and you get\nhelicoptered in, right up against the ice sheet,\u201d Nichols says. \u201cHere, you\nhave the world\u2019s oldest rocks essentially, surrounded by this dramatic\nexpression of the ice age. It\u2019s a really spectacular place.\u201d\n\nDynamic history\n\nThe team returned to MIT with whole rock samples of banded iron formations \u2014 a\nrock type that appears as stripes of iron-rich and silica-rich rock. The iron-\noxide minerals found in these rocks can act as tiny magnets that orient with\nany external magnetic field. Given their composition, the researchers suspect\nthe rocks were originally formed in primordial oceans prior to the rise in\natmospheric oxygen around 2.5 billion years ago.\n\n\u201cBack when there wasn\u2019t oxygen in the atmosphere, iron didn\u2019t oxidize so\neasily, so it was in solution in the oceans until it reached a critical\nconcentration, when it precipitated out,\u201d Nichols explains. \u201cSo, it\u2019s\nbasically a result of iron raining out of the oceans and depositing on the\nseafloor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very beautiful, weird rocks that don\u2019t look like anything that forms\non Earth today,\u201d Weiss adds.\n\nPrevious studies had used uranium-lead dating to determine the age of the iron\noxides in these rock samples. The ratio of uranium to lead (U-Pb) gives\nscientists an estimate of a rock\u2019s age. This analysis found that some of the\nmagnetized minerals were likely about 3.7 billion years old. The MIT team, in\ncollaboration with researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, showed\nin a paper published last year that the U-Pb age also dates the age of the\nmagnetic record in these minerals.\n\nThe researchers then set out to determine whether the ancient rocks preserved\nmagnetic field from that far back, and how strong that field might have been.\n\n\u201cThe samples we think are best and have that very old signature, we then\ndemagnetize in the lab, in steps. We apply a laboratory field that we know the\nstrength of, and we remagnetize the rocks in steps, so you can compare the\ngradient of the demagnetization to the gradient of the lab magnetization. That\ngradient tells you how strong the ancient field was,\u201d Nichols explains.\n\nThrough this careful process of remagnetization, the team concluded that the\nrocks likely harbored an ancient, 3.7-billion-year-old magnetic field, with a\nmagnitude of at least 15 microtesla. Today, Earth\u2019s magnetic field measures\naround 30 microtesla.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s half the strength, but the same order of magnitude,\u201d Nichols says. \u201cThe\nfact that it\u2019s similar in strength as today\u2019s field implies whatever is\ndriving Earth\u2019s magnetic field has not changed massively in power over\nbillions of years.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s experiments also showed that the rocks retained the ancient field,\ndespite having undergone two subsequent thermal events. Any extreme thermal\nevent, such as a tectonic shake-up of the subsurface or hydrothermal\neruptions, could potentially heat up and erase a rock\u2019s magnetic field. But\nthe team found that the iron in their samples likely oriented, then\ncrystallized, 3.7 billion years ago, in some initial, extreme thermal event.\nAround 2.8 billion years ago, and then again at 1.5 billion years ago, the\nrocks may have been reheated, but not to the extreme temperatures that would\nhave scrambled their magnetization.\n\nThe results also raise questions about how the ancient Earth could have\npowered such a robust magnetic field. While today\u2019s field is powered by\ncrystallization of the solid iron inner core, it\u2019s thought that the inner core\nhad not yet formed so early in the planet\u2019s evolution.\n\n\u201cIt seems like evidence for whatever was generating a magnetic field back then\nwas a different power source from what we have today,\u201d Weiss says. \u201cAnd we\ncare about Earth because there\u2019s life here, but it\u2019s also a touchstone for\nunderstanding other terrestrial planets. It suggests planets throughout the\ngalaxy probably have lots of ways of powering a magnetic field, which is\nimportant for the question of habitability elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThis research was supported, in part, by the Simons Foundation.\n\n###\n\nWritten by Jennifer Chu, MIT News\n\n#### Journal\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth\n\n#### DOI\n\n10.1029/2023JB027706\n\n#### Article Title\n\n\u201cPossible Eoarchean records of the geomagnetic field preserved in the Isua\nSupracrustal Belt, southern west Greenland\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news\nreleases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of\nany information through the EurekAlert system.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nAbby Abazorius Massachusetts Institute of Technology abbya@mit.edu Office:\n617-253-2709\n\n### More on this News Release\n\n### Geologists discover rocks with the oldest evidence yet of Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nJournal\n\n    Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth\nDOI\n\n    10.1029/2023JB027706\n\n#### Keywords\n\n#### Original Source\n\nhttps://news.mit.edu/2024/geologists-discover-rocks-oldest-evidence-earths-\nmagnetic-field-0424\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS)\n\n  * facebook.com/EurekAlert\n  * @EurekAlert\n  * youtube.com/EurekAlert\n\n  * Help / FAQ\n  * Services\n  * Eligibility Guidelines\n  * Contact EurekAlert!\n\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * DMCA\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Disclaimer\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
