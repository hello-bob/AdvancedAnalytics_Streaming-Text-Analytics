Here's what to\nexpect\n\n# The eSafety commissioner and X are due back in court today. Here's what to\nexpect\n\nBy political reporter Tom Crowley\n\nPosted 3h ago3 hours agoTue 23 Apr 2024 at 6:49pm\n\nElon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) is expected in court today to argue against\nthe federal eSafety commission.(ABC News Matt Roberts and Reuters Mike Blake)\n\nabc.net.au/news/esafety-commissioner-x-elon-musk-in-court-over-\ninjunction/103760572\n\nLink copied\n\nThe social media platform X is expected return to the federal court today to\nargue why it should not have to hide footage of the Wakeley stabbing.\n\nAs it stands, the platform is in defiance of orders from both the online\nsafety regulator and the Federal Court to do so.\n\nBut owner Elon Musk wants a fight, pitting him against a furious prime\nminister. For Mr Musk it is a question of free speech, for Mr Albanese a\nquestion of \"social decency\".\n\nAlso at issue is another question with far-reaching implications: how much\nauthority do national governments have to enforce their own laws in the\nborderless online spaces where so much civic discourse now happens?\n\nThe combatants are likely to fire off their opening salvos in court today,\nalthough the timing has not yet been confirmed. Here's what we expect.\n\n## How we got to this point\n\nThe dispute began last Tuesday when eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant\nordered X and Meta (owner of Facebook and Instagram) to remove footage of the\nstabbing of Assyrian preacher Mar Mari Emmanuel.\n\nShe has the legal authority to do so under the Online Safety Act, passed in\n2021, which empowers eSafety to demand the removal of so-called 'class 1\nmaterial'.\n\nThat includes depictions of violent crime, child sex offences, or other\n\"revolting or abhorrent phenomena [that] offend against the standards of\nmorality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults\".\n\neSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant ordered footage of the Wakeley stabbing\nto be taken down from Meta and X.(ABC News: Adam Kennedy)\n\nFailure to comply can carry a sentence of up to $782,500 for each instance.\nMeta complied and said it had deployed software to prevent any fresh posting\nof the material. But X said the order was \"overreach\", threatening legal\naction but promising to comply in the interim.\n\n### eSafety commissioner wins two-day injunction against X over violent\ncontent\n\nThe eSafety commissioner has been granted a two-day legal injunction to compel\nsocial media platform X to hide posts that include graphic footage relating to\nthe Wakeley stabbing.\n\nRead more\n\nAccording to eSafety, X didn't comply in the interim, because it only\n'geoblocked' the content rather than removing it. Geoblocking hides the\ncontent from Australian users only. But that can be circumvented by anyone\nusing a Virtual Private Network (VPN), an easily-accessible technology which\nobscures a user's geographical location.\n\neSafety argued that wasn't good enough and sought an injunction in federal\ncourt on Monday. Lawyers for X said they had not had enough time to consult\ntheir client and weren't ready to argue their case.\n\nThe judge settled on a two-day injunction. X would have 24 hours to hide the\nmaterial but could then return to court on Wednesday to argue against a\nlonger-term injunction.\n\nNow Wednesday has rolled around and X hasn't hidden the material, but a second\nhearing is still expected.\n\n## Who's the sheriff of this URL?\n\nThe central issue will be whether eSafety's powers under the Online Safety Act\nare limited to content that appears in Australia, or whether they can also\ncover content visible overseas.\n\nThe Online Safety Act is not explicit about this, and it does not discuss the\nissue of VPNs.\n\nUnder common law, courts typically presume a law does not apply\n'extraterritorially' (outside Australia) unless this is made explicit.\n\n### Albanese and Musk's power tussle\n\nThere has been no shortage of criticism from across the political aisle\nlevelled at tech billionaire Elon Musk for refusing to take down graphic\nfootage in a Sydney church. But this spat is about more than just free speech;\nit's about power.\n\nRead more\n\nBut lawyers for eSafety argued in the initial hearing on Monday that the only\nreasonable interpretation of the law was that it did cover overseas content,\nsince the law is about online safety for Australians and Australians can\neasily see content available anywhere in the world via a VPN.\n\nBut in a series of posts on X, Elon Musk has said he regards this as \"global\ncensorship\".\n\n\"Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL\ncountries... then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire\nInternet?\" he posted.\n\nSince acquiring Twitter (which he renamed X), Mr Musk has taken a much more\npermissive approach to hosting content other social media platforms would\ntypically disallow. Although his tenure began with a spree of bans on users\nwho mocked him, he has since restored many accounts which had been blocked for\nhate speech, to the dismay of advertisers.\n\nThis laissez-faire approach has inspired insults from Australian politicians\nacross the political spectrum \u2013 Opposition Leader Peter Dutton accused him of\nacting \"above the law\", Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called him a\n\"narcissistic cowboy\", and Senator Jacqui Lambie called him a \"knob\".\n\nWhereas Elon Musk's X has taken a permissive approach to content, Mark\nZuckerberg's Meta has come under fire for the opposite approach.(AP Photo/Manu\nFernandez, Stephan Savoia, File)\n\nBut concern over the global implications of domestic censorship laws is\nbroader than Elon Musk and X. Meta, which complied with eSafety's orders, has\nattracted criticism from civil liberties advocates for removing dissident\npolitical content at the request of authoritarian leaders, and it has also\nmoved to reduce the prominence of political content on its sites entirely.\n\nThat frames the Australian court battle as a global canary in the coalmine on\nthe intersection between national content laws and international tech giants.\n\n## What if X ignores the courts as well?\n\nMore immediately, it's not clear whether the federal court process will\nresolve the dispute over the Wakeley stabbing footage.\n\nX does not appear to have complied with the court order to hide the relevant\nmaterial ahead of today's hearing.\n\nBut even that is difficult to tell for certain, because eSafety's removal\nnotices listed specific URLs. Timothy Webb, a tech law specialist at law firm\nClayton Utz, said this would leave the regulator playing \"whack a mole\" even\nif it succeeded in court.\n\n\"[URLs] might enable X Corp to identify those posts if it wished to do so,\n[but] it doesn't stop the other posts,\" he said.\n\nPosts featuring footage of the attack remain visible to Australian users on X,\nincluding several posts from Senator Ralph Babet of Clive Palmer's United\nAustralia Party.\n\nMr Webb said it was also unclear whether a federal court injunction would be\nrecognised in the US if X did not voluntarily comply.\n\n\"Australia and the US don't have a treaty for the reciprocal recognition of\nforeign judgments. Typically, subject to certain requirements, US courts are\nwilling to entertain foreign judgments for monetary sums, but injunctions are\na whole different story,\" he said.\n\nThat may put the onus back on the government to contemplate more drastic\nmeasures against the company, such as a ban.\n\nCommunications Minister Michelle Rowland is likely to encounter further\nhurdles in her bid to crack down on a broader array of misinformation and\ndisinformation online.(ABC News: Adam Kennedy)\n\nWhatever its decision, it can expect to clash with X again in future if it\npursues more expansive online crackdown powers via a misinformation and\ndisinformation bill.\n\nAn earlier draft of that bill was widely panned, including by the Australian\nHuman Rights Commissioner who labelled it \"vague\" and overly restrictive of\nfree speech.\n\nThe government has promised to try again later this year.\n\nA spokesperson for Communications Minister Michelle Rowland confirmed that\ntimeline and said the bill was about \"ensuring that social media companies are\nheld to account for seriously harmful material on their platforms.\"\n\nIt is expected to go much further than the current laws, which are limited to\ngraphic depictions, and could cover a wide variety of malicious and misleading\npolitical content \u2013 a more ambitious undertaking likely to draw objections\nfrom a much broader set of voices than Mr Musk and his supporters.\n\nPosted 3h ago3 hours agoTue 23 Apr 2024 at 6:49pm\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\nMore on:\n\n  * Australia\n  * Courts and Trials\n  * Federal Government\n  * Government and Politics\n  * Information and Communication\n  * Internet\n  * Internet Culture\n  * Law, Crime and Justice\n  * Mobile Phones\n  * Social Media\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * ### Despite increased surveillance, Chinese men walked onto a northern Australian airstrip\n\n  * Analysis by Annabel Crabb\n\n### Australia's culture wars are back on the topic of breasts.
