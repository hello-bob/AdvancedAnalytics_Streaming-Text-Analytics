Any good for being the default?\n\nUpdated: April 17, 2024\n\nFunctionality, first and foremost. My motto. A tool that doesn't do what it's\nsupposed to do is a broken tool. A useless tool. Unfortunately, in the\nsoftware world, in the past decade or so, there's been a trend of offering\nhalf-broken tools as a way of life. Create a replacement for something \"old\",\nbut the replacement is only half as good. Then, it will be \"fixed\" (iterated)\nover some weird \"agile\" \"continuous development\" process over the next few\nyears. For example, in Windows, Settings is still not as good as Control\nPanel. Don't want, don't care.\n\nIn Linux, Wayland is supposed to replace X11. It's been fifteen years since\nWayland came to be, and I've tested it dozens of times in the past decade, to\nsee whether it can do what it ought to do - offer functional parity let alone\nsuperior functionality to the \"old\" tool. So far, every time, the answer has\nbeen a big no. But recently, I had a chance to test Wayland quite some as part\nof my Plasma 6 series, and I want to share my findings here. Let's see whether\nthis \"new\" display protocol can finally usurp the old stuff. Commence.\n\n## Test platforms, results\n\nI had at my disposal two laptops: one 2014 IdeaPad Y50-70, with Intel\nprocessor, integrated Intel graphics and a discrete Nvidia card, so ipso facto\nhybrid graphics; one 2020 IdeaPad 3, with AMD processor and integrated\ngraphics. Covers quite a bit of hardware so to speak, even though both\nmachines come from one vendor.\n\nFurthermore, I tested with Plasma 6 on top of KDE neon. Again, in part, the\nresults here reflect the behavior of the KDE ecosystem as much as Wayland.\nThen, over the past decade, I've done 10s of similar tests, including all\nsorts of platforms, graphics and distros, including the entire gamut of\ndesktop environments. The findings were often very similar, which gives me\nconfidence that what I have here is indicative of the broader ecosystem.\nFurthermore, it doesn't matter. The findings were very similar on both\nmachines. On top of that, KDE/Plasma is a cornerstone of Linux, and if things\ndon't work there, then the problems cannot be sidelined or ignored. With that\nin mind, let me share my results. In no particular order:\n\nUsage aspect| Wayland| X11  \n---|---|---  \nStability| Good| Good  \nSuspend & resume| Yes| Yes  \nDisplay scaling (incl. fractional)| Yes| Yes [1]  \nPerformance| Good| Better  \nResponsiveness| Good [2]| Better  \nProgram-specific issues| Some [3]| No  \nDisplay calibration| No| Yes  \nDisplay clarity| Good| Better  \nSession login time| Time (t)| Faster than time (t)  \nDesktop session save & restore| Partial| Full  \nPanel icon drag & drop| Quirky| Normal  \nNvidia driver compatibility| Good| Good  \n  \n  1. Mouse pointer wasn't scaled in the X11 session.\n  2. Wayland performance has improved considerably in the past year or so; mouse cursor lag is a bit higher in Wayland than in X11, especially on the older 2014 laptop (with Nvidia drivers).\n  3. Slow, jerky mouse pointer when using Plasma System Monitor.\n\nThose are my findings after roughly 6-7 hours of usage. Now, if I compare to\nmy 2021 report (linked early on in the article), and in general, the testing\nI've done in the last year or so, the results are pretty good. Wayland has\nimproved a great deal, and it's no longer alpha quality. More like beta. In\nisolation, the findings are solid. Good performance and stability, no issues\nrunning various programs, clean display scaling, no weird crashes, or anything\nalike.\n\nHowever ...\n\nBy and large, in almost every aspect, the results with X11 were a little bit\nbetter. In some areas, just a tiny bit, but still, ultimately, better. Perhaps\nwe're talking mere MB of usage or mere milliseconds of response, and maybe\nsome people don't care about display color calibration. But these are the\nbasics of desktop usage, and there's no reason why anyone should ever\ncompromise on them. Especially not if there's a perfectly viable alternative\nthat does the job slightly better. Even if it's only 5%, it's still more.\n\nAnd I haven't touched on some of the ultra-nerdy stuff like display forwarding\nand such. Those are things ordinary people won't do, and although important, I\ndon't want to make them the focus of this article, even though they give yet\nmore advantage to X11.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFifteen years, and Wayland still isn't as good as X11. At this point, it's a\nbit sad. Yes, Wayland is a lot better than it used to be, but that's like\nsaying one broken leg is better than two broken legs. But after fifteen years,\nseveral conclusions come to mind. One, perhaps X11 isn't so bad. Two, the\nsecurity doomsday about X11 and all that is just a bunch of hot air; we don't\nsee thousands of machines being pwned because of it, in fact nothing much is\nhappening, and there are millions of much easier and practical ways to locally\nexploit a Linux machine. Three, Wayland has a fundamental design flaw; indeed,\nits mission is to make its own development easier (quoted from the original\nwebsite), and that means it's not intended for the end user, and therefore, it\ncannot do what it needs to do. End users need functionality, how a product is\ndeveloped is totally beside the point.\n\nI have no ideological investment in either solution. I don't care. I want my\nprograms and games to run, and I want them to run well, and I don't want to be\npart of any beta experiments and compromises. And so, once again, three years\nsince I've done a similar review and article, Wayland doesn't offer everything\nI need. Nothing fancy or extravagant. It's the basics that are still faulty -\ndesktop responsiveness and performance. Better than they used to be, a lot in\nfact, to be fair, but still inferior to the crusty dinosaur called X11.\n\nThis means I will still keep using X11 on my systems (and most serious distros\ndo the same thing), because I want my systems to be stable and to run fast. I\ndon't want to be part of the half-broken trends of the tech industry just\nbecause it's the easy thing to do. Nope. We shouldn't compromise on quality,\nand if it's too hard to create something good and robust, tough luck. If so,\nsuch a thing shouldn't exist. In fact, 90% of all software shouldn't exist,\n90% of all distros don't meet the necessary quality threshold, and so on.\n\nAnd so, here we are. Once again, would I use Wayland if it gave me everything?\nSure, why not. Does it? No, it does not. Makes me sad, because it reflects\nupon a much bigger, worrying trend in the wider Linux ecosystem, of attrition,\nexhaustion, missed goals and opportunities, the lack of focus, and then some.\nWell, there you go. Feel free to interpret and re-interpret this article any\nwhich way you like. Peace.\n\nCheers.\n\n  * About\n  * Contact\n  * FAQ\n  * Terms\n\n  * Advertise\n  * Support\n  * Subscribe\n\n  * Home\n  * Top\n\nValid HTML CSS RSS\n\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0 @ Dedoimedo 2006-2024\n\n", "frontpage": true}
