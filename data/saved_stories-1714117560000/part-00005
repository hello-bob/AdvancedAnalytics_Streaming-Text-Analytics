Owusu and his community\nhave been growing cocoa beans for over 30 years. For many years, the cocoa\nharvest allowed him to take care of his children, who have all grown to\nadulthood. But now, at the age of 60, Owusu is worried about his own\nlivelihood.\n\n\u201cMy production levels have gone down because of climate change and diseases.\nAnd illegal mining activities are also contributing to this,\u201d Owusu told DW,\nadding that he barely makes enough to get by. Owusu used to produce about 10\nbags of cocoa per season, but now he struggles to fill even three. As a\nresult, he has far less cash in hand than he used to.\n\n### Ghana steps in to help farmers\n\nThe Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), which regulates the sector, recently\nannounced that it would significantly increase what it pays cocoa farmers per\ntonne. COCOBOD said in a statement that \u201cthe increase in the producer price of\ncocoa has become necessary to enhance the income of cocoa farmers\u201d.\n\nAlso Read | Africa\u2019s biggest oil and gas finds are doing little for economies at home\n\nFrom the previous rate of 20,928 Ghanaian cedis (\u20ac1,460/$1,557) per tonne, it\npledged an increase of nearly 60 per cent, meaning it would pay farmers 33,120\ncedis per tonne moving forward. That translates to 2,070 cedis per bag of\ncocoa with a gross weight of 64 kg. But farmers like Owusu have taken issue\nwith the government\u2019s new pricing policy.\n\n### Ghana farmers feel left out of decision-making\n\n\u201cPer the world price, we should be receiving more,\u201d he told DW, highlighting\nthat this month, the price of cocoa on the world market had reached $10,000\nper tonne. The price for cocoa is chiefly determined at commodity futures\nmarkets in New York and London, which are largely driven by supply and demand.\n\nHowever, the way cocoa beans are sold is based on different standards in each\ncountry, with cocoa trading systems across Africa often varying greatly in\ntheir structures. In Ivory Coast, for example, the leading producer on the\ncontinent, farmers can sell their beans to cooperatives to which they belong,\nor they can trade directly with private buying companies.\n\nBut in Ghana, the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of the precious bean, there\nis a long-established mechanism that limits farmers in a number of ways. They\ncannot trade with external buyers and thus lack control over their own\npricing. They can only sell their beans to the state agency COCOBOD, which\nthen trades that product on the global market.\n\nMoses Djan Asiedu, board secretary of the West African Cocoa Farmers\nOrganization, agrees with the concerns voiced by local farmers in Ghana.\n\u201cCOCOBOD is a pricemaker, and the price established [is] beyond [the control\nof] the farmers. And we think that the facility that is establishing the price\nis not a fair thing,\u201d he told DW.\n\n### Ghana\u2019s centralised cocoa policy aims to stabilise market\n\nMeanwhile, the spokesperson for COCOBOD, Fiifi Boafo, told DW that when cocoa\nprices on the global market increase, it does not immediately affect farmers\u2019\npockets. \u201cThe increment in price [changes] at the international market is\nsomething that we get excited about\u2014excited because this provides farmers with\nopportunities to improve revenue,\u201d he explained, adding that they deal in\n\u201cforward sales\u201d with farmers.\n\nBut Ghana\u2019s policy of forwarding cocoa sales prices means producers are\nreliant on the prices the government agrees to, without having an independent\nsay in the matter. COCOBOD said this policy is intended to allow for both the\ngovernment and cocoa-producing farmers to have some collective control over\nthe mechanisms of supply and demand in the commodities market, securing future\ncocoa supplies to address any risks in price volatility while also stabilising\nthe market.\n\nA worker transports a bag of sun-dried cocoa beans at a warehouse in the Eastern Region, Ghana.

That is why COCOBOD also agrees to [accept] whatever is\ngiven,\u201d he said.\n\nAsiedu said local farmers in Ghana deserve to get more than just a fraction of\nthe price their beans are sold for and blames government involvement in the\nproduction process for shortchanging producers. \u201cThe government only [looks\nat] the cost involved in handling the cocoa before they offer a price for the\nfarmers,\u201d he told DW.\n\nBoafo agreed that this policy of forward selling Ghana\u2019s cocoa may not present\nfarmers with opportunities to reap the full benefits of their output,\nespecially now that prices are up on the world market. However, he believes\nGhana\u2019s policy also has its benefits, and that it has protected farmers in the\npast by establishing reliable rates for their crops.\n\n### Are farmers facing an untameable market?\n\nAccording to Asiedu of the West African Cocoa Farmers Organization, Ghana\nmight be running out of time to save the cocoa sector. Many farmers are either\nabandoning their businesses or retiring without having anyone who could\ninherit their farm. \u201cMost farmers, about 70 per cent, are overaged. And they\nlack the strength to maintain their farms, especially if they do not get\nenough money [...] for their labor. So they abandon their farms,\u201d Asiedu\nexplained.\n\nTo halt this trend, both Ivory Coast and Ghana took an unusual step in 2019 to\nimprove farmers\u2019 living conditions. They declared that cocoa buyers would have\nto pay an additional premium of $400 per metric tonne of cocoa beans purchased\nto compensate for the changing and aging cocoa labour market\u2014the so-called\nliving income differential.\n\nHowever, a new study by the humanitarian organisation Oxfam, released at the\nWorld Cocoa Conference, shows that this approach has failed, partly on account\nof the rising commodity prices. But the policy also crashed in part because\ntraders also pay a negotiated premium for cocoa that is based on qualities\nlike taste, fat content, or bean size\u2014what is called the \u201ccountry\ndifferential\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt least if [the price on the global market] came in at a certain level where\nthe farmer would always be comfortable enough to still produce and the buyer\nwould also be able to afford [cocoa], we could sustain this,\u201d Boafo told DW.\n\u201cBut in this situation, where the market is not working in the interest of the\ncocoa farmer, it becomes difficult for the sustainability of the industry.\u201d\n\nOxfam\u2019s study reveals that cocoa buyers simply reduced the country\ndifferentials for Ivory Coast and Ghana after these countries had introduced\nthe $400 premium to support farmers.\n\n### No more chocolate?\n\nMeanwhile, there is already another major crisis brewing on the cocoa horizon\nin these two leading producer countries: production levels have gone down\ndrastically in recent years.\n\nIn the crop season between 2021 and 2022, Ghana produced about 750,000 metric\ntonnes of cocoa beans. But since then, cocoa production has dropped sharply.\nGhana\u2019s cocoa output for the season lasting between 2023 and 2024 is now\nexpected to be down by almost 40 per cent. Boafo said this shortage of beans\nwas the trigger for recent prices surpassing $10,000 per tonne on the world\nmarket.\n\nAlso Read | Call for renewed focus on desertification in Africa amid wars in Ukraine, Gaza\n\nAsiedu explained that in addition to not fetching fair prices for cocoa beans,\nthe sector also faces serious threats from climate change and other factors.\n\u201cWe now have unusual rainfall, unusual sunshine, and sometimes you cannot\npredict this. We also have quite a number of [other] issues, like diseases,\nwhich farmers would have to control,\u201d he told DW. \u201cAnd sometimes access to\nchemicals to combat [diseases] also becomes an issue.\u201d\n\nBoafo added that to protect the sector and fight global warming, smart farming\nmethods needed to be adopted. \u201cClimate change is a major concern,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is key that we are able to deal with the effects of climate change.\u201d\n\nBut whether the issue is climate change, commodity prices, pests, output\nrates, or incentives to continue the cocoa trade, it would appear that the\ncountries that produce the precious beans do not have much power to influence\nthe price outcome. That power, it seems, lies almost exclusively with the\nchocolate buyers and their middlemen.\n\nCOMMents\n\nFollow Us\n\nSHARE\n\n  * Copy link\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Telegram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Reddit\n\n## Related stories\n\n  * A second scramble for independence in Sahel\n\n  * How countries are finding ways to reverse environmental damage\n\n  * Could AI transform healthcare in Africa?\n\n  * Central Africa\u2019s forgotten war\n\n  * In Kenya, millions in debt to mobile app lenders\n\n  * Economic crisis looms in Egypt as both government and poor struggle\n\nRead the Latest Issue\n\nPropaganda \u2014 The Lede\n\n### Movie trailers: The unofficial manifestos of our time\n\nLawrence Liang\n\nPropaganda\n\n### Editor\u2019s Note: When cinema becomes a tool for propaganda\n\nVaishna Roy\n\n\\+ SEE all Stories\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * ### South Karnataka: April 26 to see tough fight for 14 seats\n\nVikhar Ahmed Sayeed\n\n  * ### \u2018There is anti-incumbency against the BJP\u2019: C.P.
