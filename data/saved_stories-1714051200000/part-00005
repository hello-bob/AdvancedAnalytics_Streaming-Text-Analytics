Percolating\nadaptive functionality from one level of competent subunits to a higher\nfunctional level of organization requires collective dynamics: multiple\ncomponents must work together to achieve specific outcomes. Here we overview a\nnumber of biological examples at different scales which highlight the ability\nof cellular material to make decisions that implement cooperation toward\nspecific homeodynamic endpoints, and implement collective intelligence by\nsolving problems at the cell, tissue, and whole-organism levels. We explore\nthe hypothesis that collective intelligence is not only the province of groups\nof animals, and that an important symmetry exists between the behavioral\nscience of swarms and the competencies of cells and other biological systems\nat different scales. We then briefly outline the implications of this\napproach, and the possible impact of tools from the field of diverse\nintelligence for regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Emergence of fractal geometries in the evolution of a metabolic enzyme\n\nArticle Open access 10 April 2024\n\n### Machine learning reveals the control mechanics of an insect wing hinge\n\nArticle 17 April 2024\n\n### Shell buckling for programmable metafluids\n\nArticle 03 April 2024\n\n## Introduction\n\nOne defining feature of complex life, making it distinct from our current\nengineered artifacts, is its multiscale nature: there is order in biology\nacross levels of organization, from molecules to cells, tissues, organs, whole\norganisms, and societies/swarms^1,2. Crucially, however, this goes well beyond\nstructural nesting: it is in fact a multiscale competency architecture^3,4\nbecause each level solves problems in its own relevant domains (Fig. 1). As\nevolution facilitated the increase of complexity, living things became\ncomposed of layers that cooperate and compete to solve problems in metabolic,\nphysiological, anatomical, and behavioral state spaces (reviewed in refs.\n^5,6). Biology\u2019s robustness, open-endedness, evolvability, and unique\ncomplexity likely depend on the fact that evolution works with an agential\nmaterial \u2013 a substrate with competencies, computational abilities, and\nhomeodynamic setpoints^5,7 that strongly influence the structure and function\nof multicellular forms. Adaptive behavior in new problem spaces^3,4 can arise\nbecause higher levels of organization can deform the energy landscape for the\nsubunits^8, while benefitting from their ability to navigate those landscapes\nautonomously and without micromanagement.\n\nFig. 1: Wholes and parts in biological systems: collective intelligence of\ncompetent parts is projected into novel problem spaces by higher-scale\nsystems.\n\na Living bodies implement a multiscale competency architecture in which each\nlevel of organization, from molecular networks to swarms of animals, navigates\nspecific problem spaces, such as metabolic, physiological, transcriptional,\nanatomical, and behavioral landscapes. As these diverse subsystems cooperate\nand compete with each other, their problem-solving dynamics constate adaptive\ncollective intelligence. b Indeed, one way to view evolution of complex forms\nis as a re-use of many of the same mechanisms and strategies across scales of\norganization^7,72 and problem spaces, which may even extend to high-level\nnavigation of linguistic space. c Concepts from connectionist machine\nlearning, such as artificial neural networks, now provide a rigorous,\nquantitative understanding of ways in which higher-level information is\nderived from lower-level subsystems\u2019 inputs in a collective system: for\nexample, input layers receive pixel-level information, but each subsequent\nlayer extracts progressively higher level features in the image^8. d The\npercolation of information across scales is a fundamental aspect of\nneuroscience: a rat which has learned to press a lever to get a reward is an\nemergent collective agent, consisting of large numbers of cells, none of which\nhad both experiences on the relevant timescale (interacting with the lever or\nreceiving the nutrients). The cognitive glue that enables emergent agents to\nsupport associative memories over their subunits is neural bioelectricity in\nthe case of conventional 3D world behavior, as well as in the traversal of\nmorphospace during development or regeneration^27. e Even subcellular\ncomponents are likely to participate in the scaling of emergent entities from\ncompetent parts, as networks as simple as small gene-regulatory circuits or\npathways can support several different kinds of learning, including Pavlovian\nconditioning, when the individual nodes participate in time-dependent stimulus\nand response patterns^225,226,227. f At the level of tissues and organs,\ncollective problem-solving is observed in phenomena such as regulative\nmetamorphosis, in which tadpoles with incorrect arrangements of craniofacial\norgans still become normal frogs, by novel movements of entire complex\nstructures that operate to reduce distance (error) from current configuration\nto the normal frog target morphology. This system represents an ideal example\nof William James\u2019 definition of intelligence as a capacity to achieve specific\nends by diverse means as necessary. g Other powerful but poorly-understood\nexamples of collective decision-making include the progressive transformation\nof a tail transplanted to the flank of an amphibian into a limb: the distal\ncells (in red)^228 slowly become toes, even though in their local environment\nnothing is wrong (tail tip cells located at the tip of the tail): it is a\ncollective decision that transforms them, flowing down from a perception of\nanatomical error that is only defined at the whole body-level.

Panels f and g are taken with permission\nfrom Ref. ^151. and^228 respectively.\n\nFull size image\n\nUnderstanding how the behavior of subunits percolates up toward adaptive\nprocesses at higher levels (Fig. 1a\u2013e), and how higher levels of organization\nconstrain and facilitate the behavior of their parts^9,10,11,12,13,14,15, is\ncritical not only to basic evolutionary biology but also to the control of\nsystem-level outcomes in biomedicine^16,17 and to the design of novel\nengineered systems^18,19,20,21,22,23,24. We have previously proposed that this\nresearch program can be advanced by exploiting collective intelligence as a\ncrucial symmetry across levels, which enables the tools of behavioral science\nto be brought to bear on novel unconventional substrates^16,17,25,26,\nespecially the capabilities of cell groups in transcriptional, physiological,\nand anatomical spaces (Fig. 1c, e). Specifically, we have argued that\nregulative morphogenesis is a kind of behavior of cellular collectives\ntraversing anatomical morphospace (Fig. 1f, g)^27,28,29,30,31,32, and others\nhave argued that immune systems^33,34, bacterial biofilms^35,36,37,38, and\nmany other unconventional substrates^39,40,41,42 can be effectively understood\nand rationally controlled by using techniques from behavioral and cognitive\nscience^43.\n\nHere, we explore a number of phenomena in biology which illustrate this\napproach, specifically focusing on two aspects that feature prominently in\nbehavioral science. One is intelligence, in William James\u2019^44 sense of a\ndegree of ability to reach the same goal by different means (i.e., problem-\nsolving in changing or novel circumstances). The other is collective decision-\nmaking, as studied in the rapidly advancing study of group behavior among\nswarms^45,46,47,48,49,50. This parallel has been explored\npreviously^51,52,53,54, and we extend those ideas here with specific\nreferences to more recent data revealed by advances in non-invasive imaging\nand functional cell modulation technology. We emphasize organizational\nprinciples that enable not just emergent complexity, but adaptive proto-\ncognitive systems (problem-solving with respect to adaptive goals and novel\ncircumstances) to appear^3,55. A central claim of the emerging field of\ndiverse intelligence is that cognitive capacities (Box. 1) exist on a\nspectrum: that tools, concepts, and approaches from behavioral sciences can be\nproductively applied to understand and control systems far beyond familiar\nanimals with central nervous systems (without the necessity to attribute\nadvanced, human-level metacognitive traits). We extend James\u2019 definition of\nintelligence to collectives by considering the perceptual field of an agent:\nthe area in space and time that the agent can survey to find alternative paths\nto a goal (Fig. 2a, b). As the size of a collective increases its perceptual\nfield increases, improving its ability to find variant paths. (Fig. 2c). It\nshould be noted that while we here focus on animal development, there are also\nfascinating data of this kind in plants^53,56,57,58,59,60,61.\n\nFig. 2: Collective Intelligence expands the perceptual field of a group of\ncells beyond the capacity of any individual, expanding their problem solving\nability.\n\nThe competency of subunits that flows upward to the collective decision-making\nis a kind of intelligence \u2013 the ability to navigate an environment in an\nadaptive way that enables specific homeostatic or homeodynamic goals to be met\ndespite novel perturbations or barriers. Non-living objects are capable of\nsimple goal directed behavior, as in the case of a bar magnet moving towards\nits counterpart (a). This movement can be blocked by an impediment in the\ndirect path of the magnet. Intelligent systems also exhibit goal directedness\nwith the addition of continually surveying their environment in both time and\nspace to find alternate paths to achieve their goal (b). Biological\nintelligent systems demonstrate increased ability to achieve their\n(collective) goals despite obstacles by integrating the individual\ncompetencies of their components (which can perform tasks in their own space\nwithout any inkling of the large-scale goals to which they contribute) (c).\nThis integration enables collectives to survey larger spatial areas and\ntransmit information about possible solutions from one individual to another\nand likewise expands the capacity of the individual to incorporate information\nfrom the past and anticipated future due to the greater computational capacity\nand broader spatio-temporal perceptual/actuation horizons.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe most familiar examples of collective/swarm intelligence are beehives, ant\nand termite colonies^62,63, and flocks of birds and fish^64,65,66. However, it\nis important to keep in mind that there is no sharp distinction between these\ncollective minds^46 and putative centralized ones like those possessed by\ncomplex animals and ourselves^67 \u2013 instead, the biosphere offers a spectrum of\narchitectures including familiar solid brains where the neurons do not move\nmuch relative to each other (except in exceptional cases such as\nmetamorphosis^68) and so-called \u201cliquid brains\u201d \u2013 constructs in which the\nsubunits can implement fluid interactions^63,69. Fundamentally, typical brains\nare a collective of neurons, and provide an experience and functional unity of\nmemories, goals, and preferences because of their interaction dynamics. Thus,\none way to view cognitive science is as the study of the collective\nIntelligence of neurons and other cell types. Understanding how collectives\nensure cooperation toward adaptive ends in diverse problem spaces is as much a\npart of understanding ourselves as of understanding ant colonies. Indeed it\nhas been hypothesized that the remarkable ability of neurons to unify toward a\ncentralized self \u2013 the emergent agent that is the subject of memories,\npreferences, and goals which are not assignable to any of the individual\ncomponents \u2013 is an evolutionary pivot of far earlier cell communication\nstrategies that first solved problems in navigating another domain that\nrequires information processing above the single cell level: anatomical\nmorphospace^70. By exploring possible scale-free dynamics in diverse systems,\nsuch as viewing the processes of morphogenesis as a kind of behavior of\ncellular swarms in anatomical space, we may enrich both behavioral\nneuroscience and developmental/regenerative biology by an influx of new ways\nof looking at the data^28,71,72.\n\nCrucially, despite the clear parallels to the neuroscience of cognition, we\nhere do not make any claims about first-person experience of unconventional\ncollectives^73,74,75,76, nor are we saying that the phenomena we describe are\nof the same degree as familiar human-level cognitive capacities. Instead, we\naim to take developmental biology and evolution seriously, and investigate the\nplesiomorphic, necessarily much more minimal, versions of decision-making and\nother proto-cognitive functions in multicellular contexts such as\nregeneration, development, and cancer. We view this as an important step to\nunify the recent progress in studies of single cell perception/action\nloops^77,78,79,80 with the work on active inference and perceptual control\ntheory currently being developed in neuroscience, robotics, and artificial\nlife^81,82,83,84,85,86,87. Specifically, it is essential to move beyond low-\nlevel models of information processing, memory, and anticipation in chemical\npathways^88,89,90 or in single cells^91,92,93,94, to understanding the higher-\nlevel perceptual landscape of multicellular collectives^95,96. This knowledge\nis essential to improve our ability to explain, control, and re-engineer\ncomplex morphological and functional outcomes that today are still outside of\nour reach^25,26. Here, we review interesting examples of the early, simple\nprecursors to the processes that could underlie complex cognitive\narchitectures, and we explore the hypothesis that the porting of tools across\ndisciplines (dissolving artificial barriers between fields) may facilitate\nfurther research.\n\n### Box 1 on proto-cognitive terminology applied to unconventional systems\n\nThe use of the word Intelligence and other cognitive terms applied outside of\nits familiar context of brainy animals immediately raises questions: might not\nthese terms be misused? Are not morphogenetic systems simply following the\nrules of chemistry \u2013 why anthropomorphize them? This is a crucial question.\nFirst, in the modern age, we must accept that all cognitive systems \u2013\nourselves included \u2013 exhibit chemistry, not magic, when one drills down to\nexamine the lower levels. Thus, there simply is no special human category\nwhich one can correctly anthropomorphize as somehow being beyond the laws of\nphysics at its base. We argue that this word is an anachronism and needs to be\nretired in favor of an empirically-grounded view, updated with the latest\nfindings in causal information theory^205,206,207,208,209,210,233, in which it\nis perfectly possible (in fact, unavoidable) for a system to both, be subject\nto chemistry, and also to possess additional levels of description and control\nwhose recognition affords novel benefits. We offer two points in clarifying\nour use of this terminology (developed in detail in^3).\n\nAn uncontroversial aspect of our view is that claims of intelligence (and\nother cognitive terms), like all others, must be based on rigorous experiment,\nsupported or ruled out by the degree of objective benefit that a given framing\naffords in terms of a) prediction and control, and b) future discovery (and\nnew research programs) it suggests. The latter is most significant, because\nalmost any paradigm can be rescued by enough epicycles; indeed, after one has\ndiscovered a new effect or reached a new capability, it is easy to drill down\nto the chemistry and \u2013 looking backwards \u2013 claim that there is no intelligence\nhere because it mechanically follows the laws of physics. The same is true for\nany act of a complex human brain-body system \u2013 if one insists on a view from\nthe level of particles, it will always be there. The key question is: does\nthat level of perspective provide the most interesting platform from which to\nmake the next discovery or develop the most effective control policy. The\nemphasis should be on novel capabilities, and new research programs\nfacilitated (or suppressed) by a given perspective. Thus, we propose that\nattempts to mine the rich toolbox of behavioral science to understand and\nexploit capabilities of morphogenetic systems will continue to pay off in many\n(but no doubt, not all) cases. We have fleshed out the prior gains facilitated\nby this view, and the promises for regenerative medicine, elsewhere^16,17.\n\nThe less conventional, and sometimes uncomfortable, aspect of our position is\nthat the empirical utility of framings needs to be applied fearlessly, and\nfollowed wherever it may lead: its empirical consequences must be taken\nseriously even when they contradict long-cherished a priori commitments to how\nnon-intelligent a given system must be. In other words, if a specific framing,\nwhich uses tools normally reserved for brains, results in fruitful new\nresearch programs on bacterial biofilms^35,36,38, plant\nroots^56,57,59,60,61,234,235, the training of gene-regulatory\nnetworks^225,226,236,237, or developmental/regenerative biology^117, then the\nscientific approach requires that we consider those systems to be bona fide\nsubjects of that corner of the natural world that is supposed to be described\nby the behavioral science of a spectrum of minds.\n\n### Metazoan somatic cells make collective decisions\n\n#### Development: transition to multicellularity\n\nA most fundamental example of collectivity is observed during embryogenesis\n(Fig. 3a). When we observe a blastoderm, we call it an embryo. What precisely\nare we counting when we say it is 1 embryo? One answer is that the system\nconsists of subunits all cooperating toward a specific path in morphospace:\nthe cells are committed to making a specific functional anatomy corresponding\nto 1 individual. In effect, we are noticing alignment \u2013 both physically, in\nthe sense of planar polarity of cell orientation in a collective^97,98,99, and\nfunctionally, as is seen in regulative development: if perturbed, the\nprocesses of anatomical homeostasis^28,100 will attempt to correct and\ncompensate, toward a specific outcome considered normal, across a range of\ncircumstances that includes, but is not limited to, standard\ndevelopment^101,102.\n\nFig. 3: Embryos as emergent, physiologically-defined collective entities.\n\na Embryonic blastoderms are considered \u201c1 embryo\u201d even though they are made of\nthousands of cells because the cells are aligned \u2013 both physically, in the\nsense of planar polarity, and behaviorally, in the sense that they will all\ncooperate toward one attractor state in anatomical morphospace. However, if\nthe blastoderm is temporarily scratched (a\u2019), each island will, because it\ndoesn\u2019t feel the presence of the others until the scratches heal, form its own\nembryo^103. This results in conjoined twins, triplets, etc. such as these two\nduck twins shown in b. Indeed (c), this fascinating process demonstrates that\n1) the number of embryos emerging from the excitable medium of an embryonic\nblastoderm is not genetically fixed but determined in real-time by\nphysiological processes, and 2) involves a fundamental process of collective\nautopoiesis in which each high-level individual (e.g., an embryo) needs to\ndetermine the borders between it and its outside world. d Such collective\ndecision-making, which regulates the behavior of the subunits, and its failure\nmodes, is starkly revealed as conjoined twins are known to often exhibit\nlaterality defects (such as heterotaxy) as cells located between two self-\norganizing embryo collectives may not always decide correctly whether they are\nthe left side of one twin or the right side of the other^229. e The same task\nis solved by individual organ primordia, for example when ectopic eyes are\ninduced by ion channel misexpression^150, forming several distinct eyes of\nnormal size instead of one giant eye. Panels a and c were made by Jeremy Guay\nof Peregrine Creative. Panels b and e produced by co-author M.L. (Tabin lab)\nand Sherry Aw (Levin lab). Panel d is used with permission from^229.\n\nFull size image\n\nIndeed, the question of how many individuals are present in an embryonic\nblastoderm is not fixed at 1 by the genetics, because temporary introduction\nof breaks in the blastoderm (leading to informational isolation of islands of\ncell masses) results in twins, triplets, etc^103. (Fig. 3b\u2013d), showing that\nthe blastoderm is a dynamical excitable medium in which multiple coherent\nembryos can self-organize. The same is true of organogenesis, such as when an\ninduced large eye-field fragments into a number of individual eyes instead of\none large eye (Fig. 3e). Thus, the physiological process that leads to the\nemergence of integrated collectives, which scientists and conspecifics\nrecognize as discrete individuals is fundamentally dependent on the geometry\nof interactions (and signaling barriers) present during the early\nestablishment of individuality and the setting of borders between Self and\noutside world (since every cell is some other cell\u2019s adjacent neighbor).\n\n#### Cell migration: the group does not go where each of the parts wants to go\n\nOne major question about the origin of higher-level individuals from active\ncomponents (cells, which are themselves not passive agents^9,21), is how the\nbehaviors of the higher levels depend on those of the lower-level components.\nThe most obvious scaling mode is linear: the collective does what its\nindividual cells are doing. But a more interesting aspect is that the\ncollective often displays new behaviors or preferences. One example of this in\nthe same space concerns cell migration. In an electric field, keratocytes\nmigrate to the cathode, but fragments of keratocytes migrate to the anode^104.\nRemarkably, individual fragments have the opposite direction of taxis to that\nof a collective of those fragments (an intact cell). The behaviors of a\ncollective can, even in relatively minimal systems, be a complex and hard-to-\npredict function of the tendencies of the components. This is a microcosm of\nthe larger issue of competition between wholes and their parts^6,105, and of\nthe more general feature of multiscale organization in which collective agents\nbend the energy landscape for their components to exploit their mechanisms\ntowards distinct ends.\n\n#### From normal melanocytes to a melanoma phenotype: a collective decision\n\nOne failure mode of collective behavior in vivo is cancer^106,107. When cells\nbecome isolated from the information structure of the tissue, they revert back\nto an ancient, unicellular transcriptional^108 and behavioral\nphenotype^109,110. Exciting work focusing on the biochemical nature of the\nmicroenvironment has shown the ability of non-cell-autonomous cues to\nnormalize cancer^111,112,113,114,115,116. However, more recent work has\nfocused on bioelectric cues that normally orchestrate multicellular anatomical\noutcomes^117, and the consequences of their disruption (Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 4: Collective decision-making of neoplastic transformation.\n\nTadpoles of the frog Xenopus laevis (dorsal view of the head) show small\nnumbers of round melanocytes (a) in normal development. However, when the\nsignals from instructor cells^118 are interrupted by changing their resting\npotential, the melanocytes convert to a melanoma-like form: they\nhyperproliferate, and migrate to fill many regions of the embryo in a\nphenotype that recapitulates melanoma metastasis (a\u2019). This process can be\nstimulated at different rates in a population by different reagents (b).\nInterestingly, while only some percentage of animals convert, the decision is\nmade in a coordinated fashion by every tissue in the animal: individuals are\neither entirely converted (every melanocyte undergoes the shape and behavioral\nchanges) or are entirely unaffected. This stochastic decision resembles a\nbiased coin toss, but all the tissues of a given animal are linked to the same\ncoin. A model of the pathway (c) was parametrized by a machine learning\nalgorithm which was able to reconstruct the state space (c\u2019) revealing the\nmechanism of this stochastic decision^119,120. This model was then used to\npredict a novel intervention that would break the concordance among cells \u2013\ndisrupt specifically the collective decision-making. For the first time,\npartially-pigmented animals were produced (d), showing how AI-discovered\npathways fitting biological data can help explain collective decisions made by\nlarge numbers of cells in vivo. Panels a-c\u2019 taken with permission from Ref.\n^119. Panel d taken with permission from Ref. ^120.\n\nFull size image\n\nIn the tadpole model, it was shown that normal melanocytes could be driven\ninto a melanoma-like converted phenotype: they over-proliferated, migrated\ninappropriately to regions normally devoid of melanocytes, invaded the blood\nvessels and brain, and changed shape into a highly arborized, invasive\nform^118. This could be achieved in the absence of classical carcinogens,\noncogenes, or DNA damage, by brief exposure to chemical (chloride ion channel\nactivator drug) or molecular-genetic (GlyCl mutant) targeting of the\nbioelectric state of a specific cell population: instructor cells which\nnormally keep the melanocytes in their healthy state via serotonergic\nsignaling^118. Indeed, targeting only a handful of instructor cells in a\nregion away from the source of melanocyte populations (as confirmed by lineage\nlabel) was sufficient to turn the whole tadpole into a hyperpigmented\nphenotype strongly resembling metastatic melanoma: all of the melanocytes\nconverted, even the ones not close to the GlyCl-activated cells.\n\nThe most remarkable thing was that this phenotype is an all-or-none\nphenomenon. Using different reagents could induce different incidences of\nhyperpigmentation (conversion) in a cohort of animals, but this was a\npopulation-level phenotype: for example, 70% of the animals could be\nconverted, but any given animal was either fully converted or fully normal\n(Fig. 4a, b). A computational model of the known signaling steps was designed\nand parametrized (Fig. 4c) to reproduce this all-or-none behavior and fit the\nexperimentally-observed incidence percentages across different\nperturbations^119. The model illustrated how cells navigate biochemical state\nspace (Fig. 4c\u2019) and face specific decision-points at regions of that\nlandscape. The benefit of such a model of collective decision-making is that\nit can be used to infer interventions. Specifically, the model was used to\npredict an intervention that would break the concordance of melanocytes within\nsingle animals. It suggested two drugs and a dominant negative construct \u2013 an\nexperiment that had never been done before - which were then experimentally\nconfirmed to produce the first partially-converted animals (Fig. 4d) seen in\nalmost a decade of experiments in this system^120.\n\n#### Left/right, head/tail: random, but collective anatomical decisions\n\nIn addition to the 3D and transcriptional/physiological spaces discussed\nabove, one of the most interesting aspects of collective intelligence is the\nnavigation of anatomical morphospace. Cell groups need to make specific\ndecisions about which organ will be built and what shape they must make. This\nis a fundamentally different problem than identifying gene regulatory networks\nand differentiation signals. For example (Fig. 5), planarian cells can rebuild\na complete worm from any kind of cut or fragment (Fig. 5a). Typical treatments\nof this problem focus on a fragment within a morphogen gradient, that offers\ndistinct concentrations of an instructive chemical signal that can confer\nhead/tail fate decisions locally to each wound (Fig. 5b). However, the more\ninteresting and fundamental issue is seen when considering just one cut: the\ncells on either side of the cut will create a head and tail respectively, but\nthey were adjacent neighbors before the cut and located at the same positional\ninformation value. In other words, it is actually impossible for an anatomical\ndecision like this to be made locally \u2013 the cells of the wound must coordinate\nwith the remaining fragment to get information about where they are located,\nwhich way they are facing, and what other structures exist^121,122, in order\nto make adaptive decisions about large-scale growth and form that enable\nregeneration of normal worms.\n\nFig. 5: Regeneration: collective behavior in anatomical morphospace.\n\na Planaria regenerate a complete worm from even small fragments, which\nrequires large numbers of cells to cooperate to complete a specific path\nthrough morphospace, eventually building a correct complex anatomy to very\ntight tolerances. b Morphogen models are often used to explain the axial\npolarity of a middle fragment (2 cuts), but if one focuses on a single cut\n(vertical line marked as P1), it is clear that adjacent cells will have\nradically different anatomical fates (head vs. tail) despite their identical\npositional information. The cells must communicate with the rest of the\nfragment to determine what other structures exist, which way the wound is\nfacing, etc. and then decide which path in morphospace the collective will\nfollow. c If half of the neoblasts of one species of planaria (with a round\nhead) are killed by radiation and replaced with transplanted neoblasts from\nanother species (with a flat head), what shape head would regenerate (and\nwould it ever reach the stop criterion and cease remodeling)? This thought\nexperiment reveals clearly why the science of collective intelligence is a\ncritical complement to molecular genetics: while much single cell-level\ninformation is available about the pathways controlling stem cell\ndifferentiation, the field has not a single model able to make a prediction\nfor this scenario, because we still lack the conceptual tools and data to\nunderstand how collectives of cells make unified decisions. d The tools of\ndynamical systems theory (top row) and connectionist neuroscience/AI (middle\nrow) are poised to help provide formalisms for understanding how networks of\ncells can store pattern information and recover it from partial inputs, such\nas occurs in planarian regeneration (bottom row). e In planaria, one of the\nmodalities that binds individual cells into morphogenetic collectives is\nbioelectricity^117,132: fragments possess a difference in resting potential\nthat determines the number and location of heads. Tracking these patterns\nusing voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes in functional experiments reveals\nsome aspects of the rules by which the collective makes decisions^230. In\nanimals treated with the proton pump inhibitor SCH28080 (SCH column), the\nbioelectric pattern lacks the depolarization that cells interpret as the make-\na-head signal and headless animals result (bottom left). Control fragments\nhave the depolarized (green) signal at one end (middle column) leading to\nnormal 1-headed animals (bottom center). Animals treated with the chloride\ndrug opener Ivermectin (IVM column) exhibit two regions of depolarization\nresulting in 2-headed animals (bottom right). Interestingly, the green voltage\nthat produces heads in control animals is seen in the middle of the IVM-\ntreated worms, and does not induce heads: only the very depolarized regions\n(red) become heads. This indicates that the collective is not measuring\nabsolute resting potential values, but (in keeping with the distributed nature\nof the circuit and the animal-wide signaling) is adopting anatomical organ-\nlevel fates driven by the relative difference of regions (i.e., the most-\ndepolarized region is where heads form). f In addition to 0-, 1-, and 2-head\nworms (which are stable lines that continue to regenerate as 2-headed^231),\nthere is another form called Cryptic Worms, also produced by bioelectrical\ndisruption^130. These worms show a stochastic phenotype, in which a worm (or\nindeed, independent pieces of a single worm) will form 2-head or 1-head worms\nat a 70\u201330 ratio; the transition diagram with probabilities is shown in panel\nf; WT = wild-type (1 head); 8OH = octanol which causes the cryptic phenotype;\nH2O \u2013 water (control condition or cutting). The percentages indicate the\nfrequency of each transition. Crucially, while the head/tail decision is\nstochastic, all of the cells agree on the same outcome (what is never seen is\na planarian in which some of the cells in a given region are making a head and\nothers a tail) \u2013 the whole region makes the random decision as a single whole.\nThe mechanism is not known but likely involves gap-junctional communication of\nthe voltage signals^231 and can be modeled as a kind of perceptual\nbistability^131. Panels a and d made by Jeremy Guay of Peregrine Creative and\nAlexis Pietak respectively. Panels c, e, f used with permission from Refs.\n^121,130,230 respectively.\n\nFull size image\n\nMore generally, numerous excellent papers have studied planarian neoblasts and\ntheir control networks, as well as the gradients of morphogens that pattern\nthe anterior-posterior, dorso-ventral, and medio-lateral\naxes^123,124,125,126,127. Despite these advances, there is very little\nunderstanding of how cells build specific head shapes or how they know when to\nstop mitosis and morphogenesis when the correct head shape has been achieved.\nSpecifically, for example, no existing model makes a prediction on what will\nhappen if 50% of the neoblasts of a given planarian are replaced with those of\na different species and the head is cut off (Fig. 5c). Whether the head will\nbe of the right shape for one of the two species (dominant), or an in-between\nhybrid form, or in fact continuously cycle between shapes (as each set of\nneoblasts works to remodel toward the shape they normally make with great\nfidelity), cannot yet be derived from the properties of single cell regulatory\npathways \u2013 it is a collective decision about navigating the space of possible\nhead shapes^128,129 (Fig. 5d).\n\nIndeed, modification of cell:cell communication during regeneration can cause\ngenetically-normal fragments to produce heads appropriate to other species of\nplanaria^128,129 \u2013 visiting attractors in morphospace normally reserved for\nother genetic lineages. More specifically, several perturbations targeting the\nbioelectric control circuit (Fig. 5e) have shown randomization of outcome:\nsuch Cryptic planaria are destabilized, and fragments (even from the same\nparent worm) will form 1-head and 2-head forms at a set frequency of ~1:2^130\n(Fig. 5f). This phenomenon highlights collective decision-making because this\nrandomization is at the level of the population: each individual animal has\nclear heads and tails, not tissue speckled with cells of different identity.\nIn other words, the randomization of bioelectric state^131,132 and the\ndownstream morphogen gradients is interpreted with respect to anterior-\nposterior organ identity by collectives, not by individual cells.\n\nThe left-right axis in vertebrates shows a similar phenomenon (Fig. 6).\nConsistent asymmetries across the midline first show up in the chick embryo\naround the primitive streak and Hensen\u2019s node^133. A number of treatments,\nincluding targeting of the bioelectric^134,135,136,137,138 or downstream\nbiochemical^139,140,141,142 pathways, result in randomization of molecular and\nanatomical consequences of symmetry breakage and\norientation^143,144,145,146,147,148. The animals display, in addition to the\nnormal L:R identity, double-right or double-left (isomerism), or reversed\n(situs inversus) patterns of lateral identity markers, followed by heterotaxy\nof the heart and viscera. Remarkably, while many of these treatments randomize\noutcomes, the randomization is once again above the level of the individual:\nany given embryo has a consistent identity on the L and R side, and all of the\ncells agree. In all of the many studies on perturbation of the LR pathway, we\nare aware of only one that actually breaks the concordance: disruption of the\nplanar polarity pathway by down-regulating VANGL signaling^149 leads to a\nspeckling on both sides of the midline, consistent with individual cells\nwithin a single lateral domain disagreeing on whether they should have L or R\nidentity (Fig. 6a\u2013d).\n\nFig. 6: Cellular collectives coordinate decisions from body axes to whole\norgans.\n\nThe expression of Sonic hedgehog in the Hensen\u2019s node of early chick embryos\nis a marker (purple color) of left-right asymmetry: in normal embryos, it is\nonly expressed on the left side (a, red arrowhead). By perturbing upstream\nevents, such as the voltage gradient that determines lateral identity^138, it\nis possible to induce a percentage of right-sided (b) or bilateral (c)\nexpression. However, in all these cases, all of the cells on one side of the\nnode agree on their identity, even if the identity is stochastically\ndetermined within a cohort of embryos. There is one known perturbation \u2013\ndisruption of planar polarity^149 \u2013 that breaks the concordance and results in\na speckled appearance (d) in which individual cells within a lateral\ncompartment disagree about which side they are on. e Ectopic eyes can be\nproduced in frog embryos, even far from the anterior neurectoderm such as on\nthe gut (red arrowhead), by microinjection of potassium channel mRNAs that\ninduce a specific state that is interpreted by cells as an eye induction\nsignal^150. The information content of this inducer is very low \u2013 as in the\nendogenous eye spot in the head^151, there is a simple voltage pattern that\ncannot encode all of the nuances of a complex vertebrate eye structure. This\nsimple spatial pattern is read out by the cellular collective to make an\norgan-level decision. Interestingly, if very few cells are injected (f), the\nblue cells are lineage-labeled to indicate the presence of the ectopic ion\nchannel), normal-sized lenses can be produced because the voltage-modified\ncells recruit their wild-type neighbors to participate in the organogenesis.\nHowever, this does not always work because the surrounding cells, in a cancer-\nsuppression mechanism, are meanwhile exerting influence to shut down the\nectopic eye induction, and sometimes no eye tissue appears at all. This is an\nexample of collective decisions competing to determine the path through\nmorphospace that will be taken and once a choice is made, all of the cells\nfall into line. Panels a, c, d, e, f taken with permission from Ref.\n^3,149,150,232 respectively.\n\nFull size image\n\n#### Eye or skin: competition in DNKir6 injected animals, and size control\n\nA number of collective decisions are mediated by bioelectric signaling, which\ncoordinates cells in the body as a likely precursor to its role in\ncoordinating neurons in the brain toward the emergence of a coherent, problem-\nsolving Self^27,70. One example of this at the organ level concerns the\ninduction of whole ectopic eyes in the frog embryo by misexpression of ion\nchannels^150 whose activity sets up a voltage gradient similar to that of the\neye spot which normally determines their location in the head^151. As with\nprevious examples, this is a signal to the collective, setting organ-level\nidentity, not micromanaging the differentiation of the many cells which need\nto be produced and placed with exquisite precision to make a normal vertebrate\neye. Interestingly, this signaling has another built-in competency:\nrecruitment. If very few cells are injected with the channel (attached), they\nwill often recruit their neighbors (Fig. 6e, f) to help them complete the\ntask. This is a kind of secondary instruction, where we instruct a group of\ncells to make an eye, and they recruit the others (which were never directly\nmanipulated), including all of the necessary downstream morphogenetic steps.\nThis recruitment of individuals to accomplish a high-level goal is seen in\nother collective systems like ant colonies^152,153, which often call in\nhelpers when a task is large. The ability to recruit participants to complete\ntasks may be a central competency of collective intelligence that works across\nscales, from cells to swarms of entire organisms^7.\n\n### The neural crest acts as an intelligently migrating collective\n\nThe neural crest is a cell population that arises between the neural plate and\nthe non-neural ectoderm before migrating throughout the body to produce a\nconstellation of cell types including head mesenchyme, peripheral nervous\nsystem and melanocytes^154. Neural crest cells (NCCs) must successfully\ntraverse the complex and rapidly changing embryonic body before identifying\ntheir target location and integrating with nearby tissue. The energy landscape\nthat they traverse is more complex than it initially appears, however. While\neach cell navigates a fairly simple dorsal-ventral cartesian space towards a\ngoal destination, the neural crest collective is navigating morphospace to\ncreate properly spaced, symmetrical facial structures. When the cell-level\nnavigation of cartesian space is put in opposition to the collective-level\nnavigation of morphospace, the collective supersedes the behavior of the\nindividual to achieve the organism-level morphogenetic target of forming a\nfunctional, symmetrical face as we describe in the examples below.\n\n#### Neural crest migration is intelligent\n\nGrafting and ablation experiments underscore the collective ability of the\nneural crest to accomplish its morphogenetic goals despite some novel\ncircumstances. Axolotls regulate the number of cells, compensating for too few\nor too many^155. Neural crest cells (and in some cases neural tube\ncells^156,157) regulatively adapt their migratory behavior to compensate for\nthe loss of NCCs in nearby or contralateral branchial arches^158,159. This re-\nrouted migration suggests that individual cells can leverage the perceptual\nfield of the neural crest cell collective to determine the movements that they\nshould take to contribute to proper system level morphogenesis (Fig. 7). In an\nespecially striking example of the NCCs\u2019 intelligent capability to achieve\ntheir ontogenic goals in challenging environments, mouse NCCs grafted into\nchicken embryos will successfully navigate the forming embryonic face and form\nteeth^160.\n\nFig. 7: Neural crest cell collectives intelligently alter the behavior of\ntheir component cells to achieve target morphology.\n\nRegulative compensatory migration in migrating neural crest cells demonstrates\ncollective intelligence by placing the goal of the individual and the goal of\nthe collective in opposition (a). During normal development neural crest cells\nintegrate signaling cues to migrate dorsal to ventral along the forming\nembryonic body. When an arch is ablated, cells will move anteriorly or\nposteriorly instead of dorsoventrally to fill this missing arch thus achieving\nthe correct target morphology of the collective behavior through movement\npatterns contrary to the individual cell\u2019s normal optimal path^158,159.\nApplying our perceptual field framework, the expanded collective perceptual\nfield contains a more attractive path to achieving the cell\u2019s goal than its\nindividual perceptual field does, and thus is undergoes compensatory rather\nthan normal migration. Inter-domain grafting experiments demonstrate the\nexpanded time-domain perceptual field of a collective intelligence (b). When\ngrafted from one Hox domain to another, individual rhombomere or neural crest\ncells will lose the memory of their original Hox gene inductive event and\nadopt the expression pattern of their neighbors^161,162. Similarly grafted\ncollectives, in contrast, maintain their previously induced state suggesting\nincreased memory due to their collective intelligence.\n\nFull size image\n\n#### Neural crest intelligence is collective\n\nIndividual cells transposed from one anterior-posterior axial domain to\nanother will change their gene expression to match their\nneighbors^159,161,162. In contrast, groups of cells transposed along the\nanterior-posterior axis maintain their original gene expression, thus\nresisting the inductive effects of the surrounding tissue^159,161,162. Within\nthe context of our perceptual field model, the increased positional memory and\nresistance to neighbor effects suggests that cell collectives have an expanded\nperceptual cone in the posterior time (history) dimension (Fig. 7). While\nindividual cells rapidly lose their memory of past inductive cues, collectives\nare better able to maintain a consistent identity in a noisy developmental\nenvironment^159,161,162. As with the re-routing post arch ablation example\nabove, this example suggests that the cell-level behavior is subordinate to\nthe collective-level behavior. When collective-level behaviors are put in\nopposition by grafting of collectives these is no clear hierarchy, and\noriginal fate is maintained.\n\n### Cells intelligently segment the vertebrate body axis via the segmentation\nclock\n\nAnother well-studied example of collective intelligence is the vertebrate\nsegmentation clock comprising coordinated oscillations of Notch pathway target\ngenes to establish segmental boundaries of the early vertebrate embryo^163.\nThe segmentation clock exhibits functional robustness to interventions,\nconsistent with James\u2019 definition of intelligence, because of the ability to\ntake different paths through morphospace to correctly partition tissue into\nuniform, correctly sized segments. Clever experiments radically altering the\ngeometry of the tissue test its intelligence by forcing it to explore a\nvariant morphospatial landscape.\n\n#### Segmentation is intelligent\n\nIn whole embryos, coordinated oscillations will re-emerge following chemically\ninduced disruption and resume producing properly spaced segments^164, though\nthe complexity of the developing organism make it challenging to determine if\nthis re-emergence is intrinsic to the segmenting tissue or imposed upon it by\nother tissues. Recent work with paraxial mesoderm explants^165 further\nemphasizes the remarkable intelligence of this system. In the context of\nJames\u2019 framework for intelligence, the goal states are 1) coordinated\noscillatory gene expression and 2) morphological segmentation, and the\nobstacle is the severe geometric transformation from 3D tube to 2D sheet. In\nthe 2D geometry, oscillatory gene expression waves manifest as outwardly\npropagating rings that successfully effect segmentation of the outer edge of\nthe explant. While these segments manifest as serially repeated spheres in the\n3D in vivo environment, 2D cultures form segments circumscribing the explant\u2019s\ncircumference (Fig. 8a). Segmentation can be re-capitulated from embryonic\nstem cells in culture by production of trunk-like organoids termed\ngastruloids^166,167, which arrive at a segmented target morphology despite a\nvery different ontogenic history than normal trunk cells.\n\nFig. 8: Collectives of vertebrate paraxial mesoderm demonstrate intelligence\nin their ability to achieve their goal of segmentation despite being removed\nfrom developing animals and placed in a 2-dimensional culture system^169.\n\nWhen the tissue is dissociated, cells quickly stop oscillating, though\ncoordinated oscillations re-emerge in cells that are dissociated and re-\naggregated, indicating that collectivity is essential to this intelligent\nbehavior^169 (a). Cells grafted between tissues in different phases of the\nsegmental oscillator will synchronize with their neighbors in the host tissue.\nWithin our perceptual field framework, this synchronization suggests that the\nsystem level memory (i.e., where they were in the oscillation) is conferred\nupon the grafted individual cells for whom the spatial and temporal cues are\nnow mismatched (b).\n\nFull size image\n\n#### Segmentation intelligence is collective\n\nThe ability of the segmentation clock to intelligently navigate its\nmorphospatial landscape has also been tested by forcing it into a state that\nit would never normally adopt by grafting out of phase cells into oscillating\ntissue. The segmentation clock functions to coordinate a collection of cells\nto organize into a large super-cellular structure. Consistent with this\nfunction, collectivity is necessary for the segmentation clock to function.\nWhen wild type cells are grafted into mutant non-cycling fish, they express\nthe normally oscillatory gene her1, but it does not cycle^168. Similarly, pre-\nsomitic mesoderm cells do not oscillate when cultured independently, but will\nresume oscillating when cultured collectively^169. This loss of oscillation\ncan be partially rescued by addition of external FGF, potentially mimicking\nthe effects of high cell density^169 and implicating collectivity in stem cell\nmaintenance. Most directly, cells hetero-grafted from tissue in one phase of\nthe clock into a group of cells in a different phase will synchronize to the\nphase of their lateral neighbors^170, (Fig. 8b). In the context of our\nperceptual field model, the grafted cells benefit from the expanded memory and\npredictive power of their neighbors to determine their correct position in the\nclock (Fig. 8b). These cells then adjust their intrinsic oscillatory dynamics\nto entrain to their neighbors, thus completing their task despite an internal\nconfiguration with novel hardware components which do not have an evolutionary\nhistory of living together in a single organism.\n\n### Intelligence in bacterial communities\n\nThough bacteria are unicellular, they often form into large biofilms that\nexhibit fascinating physiological and morphological collective\nproperties^171,172,173,174. Interestingly, much as bioelectric networks are\nused in metazoan systems to bind individual cells together to large-scale\nmorphogenetic projects, bacteria likewise exploit electrical signaling across\nspace and time to coordinate^175,176. Cells within the biofilm (and even\nbetween biofilms) exhibit bioelectrically-coordinated oscillatory growth\npatterns that favor the health of the collective at the expense of their own\nindividual fitness^177,178, and bioelectric signals coordinate metabolism\namong distant cells within the biofilm^38. These bioelectric signals help\nrecruit new bacteria to the biofilm, even across species^179, and can be\noptogenetically controlled to evoke long-lasting changes on bacterial behavior\n\u2013 a collective memory^35.\n\nExciting recent work has identified a mechanism similar to the vertebrate\nsegmentation clock in bacterial biofilms responding to nitrogen stress\nmediated by a negative feedback loop^180. The similarities between this system\nand the vertebrate segmentation clock point to further roles for this\nphenomenon in collective intelligence, and the manifestation of similar\nmolecular logic circuits in distant clades suggests that such collective\nintelligence is a much more widespread phenomenon than is currently\nappreciated. Furthermore, the parameter space is neither cartesian space nor\nmorphospace as in our previous examples, but physiological space. The\nbacterial cells intelligently adjust their individual physiologies to achieve\nan optimal collective physiology. The capacity of such simple organisms to\ncollectively navigate physiology space using paradigms recapitulated in\nmulticellular organisms highlights the deep cruciality of such navigation to\nthe emergence of complex tissue and points to the necessity of understanding\nhow such navigation occurs during animal development and pathology.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCell and developmental biology offer very rich fodder for the emerging field\nof diverse intelligence: discovering a vast spectrum of problem-solving\ncapacities in novel substrates and at unconventional spatiotemporal scales.\nBecause of life\u2019s multi-scale competency architecture, a fundamental aspect of\nintelligence is collective behavior: all intelligences appear to be made of\nparts, connected by mechanisms implementing policies that bind the competent\ncomponents into a cooperative (and competitive^6) computational medium that\nsolves problems in new spaces and at higher scales. The harnessing of\nindividual cell behaviors toward regulative morphogenesis (navigating\nanatomical morphospace), and system-level physiological robustness (traversing\nphysiological space) are especially interesting examples. Indeed, it could be\nargued that a unique signature of Life is a causal architecture in which the\nproblem-solving competency of the whole is greater than that of its parts).\nEvolution seems to be particularly good at finding ways to scale the cognitive\nlight cone of cells^3,4,5,181 to achieve spectacular capabilities for\ngracefully and adaptively handling complexity, novelty, and noise at large\nscale.\n\nA key aspect of collective intelligence of cell groups is binding subunits\u2019\nactivities to the same target morphology \u2013 a kind of discrete (e.g., head vs.\ntail) outcome whereas the components have states that range over many\ncontinuous quantities. In axial patterning (left-right, anterior-posterior),\ncollective decision-making enables large numbers of cells in a compartment to\nagree on an organ-scale anatomical fate despite stochastic influences\nupstream. And it is seen that a decision with respect to morphogenetic\noutcome, and harnessing cells to the same decision, are orthogonal functions\nwith distinct mechanisms that can be experimentally dissociated.\n\nImportantly, the definition of intelligence as the ability to reach the same\nendpoint despite internal or external changes emphasizes not only robustness\n(successful use of novel navigational policies to overcome perturbations) but\nalso its failure modes. Numerous ways of targeting of its sensory, memory,\ndecision-making, or other components can de-rail the performance of a\ncollective intelligence, resulting in birth defects and malformations. This is\nquite consistent with the proposed symmetry between the behavioral and\ndevelopmental domains, because computational neuroscience and cognitive\nscience are replete with interesting ways to think about how cognitive systems\nmake mistakes. The use of tools and concepts across fields has begun,\nincluding attempts to understand cancer as a dissociative identity disorder of\nthe morphological collective intelligence^109, the use of serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors and hallucinogens to perturb non-neural development^182,183, the\nmodeling of the unstable phenotypes in planarian regeneration as perceptual\nbistability^131, and the finding that some visual illusions that plague\nvertebrate nervous systems are recapitulated in collective intelligences such\nas ants^184,185. We expect that many concepts from the behavioral sciences\nthat explain failures of learning, recall, Bayesian updating of dynamic\nsignaling models, attention, arousal, and perception will find application in\nexplaining and controlling defects in navigation of anatomical space towards\nhealthy, optimal outcomes.\n\nAnother hallmark of collective intelligence is the ability of the higher-level\nagent to make decisions based on extended patterns of information. For\nexample, in the frog embryo brain, it is the spatial difference in voltage\nbetween regions that drives downstream gene expression, not the absolute value\nof any cells^186,187. In other words, cells have to read whole cell fields and\nrecognize specific patterns to determine what to do \u2013 the collectivity is seen\nin the input, as well as the output, of cell groups\u2019 behaviors.\n\nFuture work is essential to understand how higher-order entities (organisms,\norgans, tissues, etc.) distort the energy landscape for their subunits,\nbenefitting from their competencies to navigate spaces of which the subunits\nare unaware. This underlies the harnessing of cellular signaling and\ncomputational abilities to regulative development and regeneration, which\nimplement organ-level homeostatic loops that keep large-scale order against\ncellular defections (aging and cancer^106,188) and injury^189. Living matter\nis a kind of agential material with the ability to propagate information\nacross scales \u2013 a phenomenon which has many implications for evolution^9, and\nfor bioengineering^21.\n\nMany tools are becoming available which increase insight and cross-\nfertilization of approaches across disciplines. Examples include optogenetic\ninterrogation of single cell^78,190,191,192,193 and\nembryonic^194,195,196,197,198,199 dynamics, as well as the very elegant\nelectrotactic \u2018SCHEEPDOG\u2019 system which is able to precisely steer collectives\nof keratinocytes using patterned dynamic electric fields^200 that distinguish\nbetween collective and individual cell behaviors. In addition to technologies,\nimportant additions are conceptual tools, such as the active inference\nframework^201,202,203 and tools of causal information\ntheory^204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212, which will have many applications\nin the biological sciences.\n\nFuture work in this area will also continue to be enriched by advances in the\ncollective intelligence of animal behavior^46,213 as well as in the field of\nswarm robotics^214,215,216,217. Additional directions for investigation\ninclude: how conflict (competition) is used for coordination in\ncollectives^6,218, and how propagation of shared stress^181,219,220 and the\nsharing of cellular memories via gap junctions^4,109 establish higher-order\nindividuals.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of this emerging field is the way in which\ncollective intelligence serves as a focal point for exploring the symmetries\nbetween developmental biology and neuroscience^26. This ranges from the use of\ncognitive science formalisms to understand morphogenesis and its\ndisorders^55,131,221 to the questions of how many human Selves can be\nsustained by the excitable medium of a human brain^67 and the parallels to the\nmultiple bodies that can emerge from a single embryonic blastoderm^103.\n\nMany of the same mechanisms (e.g., electrophysiological networks) and control\npolicies are re-used by evolution to bind neurons to collective behavior and\nanimal navigation of 3D space and to bind pre-neural cells to move the body\nconfiguration in morphospace^5,70. Turing was prescient in studying both\nintelligence and the chemical basis of self-organization^222,223, as the\nproblem of self-organization in familiar neural-based intelligences may have\nmuch in common with the problem of self-organizing a non-neural collective\nintelligence of morphogenesis^224. If true, a number of fields can look\nforward to exciting advances. Cancer, a kind of dissociative identity disorder\nof the somatic collective intelligence^109, limitations in regenerative\nability, and many physiological disorders could all be advanced by techniques\nthat exploit not just the low-level mechanisms, but also the higher-level\ndecision-making of life^16,17. Neuroscience can benefit from a glimpse into\nthe evolutionary past of the brain\u2019s remarkable capabilities, while\ndevelopmental biology and bioengineering can borrow the practical and\nconceptual tools of neuroscience which is likely to be about much more basic\nprinciples than the function of classical neurons. Understanding how evolution\nworks in an agential, multiscale material (where it can take advantage of\ncross-level computation) will nicely complement the efforts of engineers to\nbuild and control swarms of robots and AI systems, but who as yet largely work\nwith passive matter where competency exists only at one scale.\n\nTaken together, collective intelligence is an extremely exciting and\ninterdisciplinary emerging field that spans from the most fundamental\nphilosophical problems of the parts-whole relationship to advancing\nfundamental and applied discovery in a number of important subfields.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
