Expectedly, answers mostly\nfavored question from the title. Pitifully, most of them being incorrect.\n\nWhen I stumbled upon this question, I decided to improve the most upvoted\nanswer, keeping in mind two cornerstone founding principles of Stack Overflow:\n\n  * \"We're working together to build a library of detailed, high-quality answers\"\n  * \"This site is all about getting answers. It's not a discussion forum. There's no chit-chat\"\n\nIn my understanding, adding a new answer to fix an issue in another post\nessentially creates a forum page. Addressing another answer will inevitably\nmake a chit-chat. But a person coming to the library is not interested in\nreading this argument! And even without that, long rows of answers\n(intertwined with numerous comments) strikingly resemble a forum page, forcing\na visitor to shuffle through several dozen opinions, making it very hard to\nfind a detailed, high-quality answer, promised on the tour page. Provided,\nthere is any.\n\nObviously, by no means it was my intention to interfere with the author's\nintent: I reasonably assumed that the intent was to provide a detailed, high\nquality answer, best to their knowledge. Sadly, there was issues in this\nanswer, so I decided to fix them, along with adding some clarifications. And\nso I did.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nThen, after some time passed, suddenly a moderator swooped upon this question\nand made the most illogical edits\n\n  * making question title to match the body, instantly invalidating most existing answers\n  * reverting my additions to the top answer, making it harmful and incomplete back\n\nAnd then I received a moderator message, stating that some of my edits were\nrolled back for being \"too extensive\".\n\nWhat could be possible logic behind invalidating existing answers? And why I\nwas denied to work together with other participants in order to provide a\ndetailed high quality answer? Is there even such a goal, to create that\nlibrary? Why each more or less popular question looks more like an old\ngraveyard, with crumbling monuments nobody cares for, forcing a visitor to\nshuffle through rubble? What happened to the principles this site has been\nfounded with?\n\n  * discussion\n  * edits\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nedited 1 hour ago\n\nStephen OstermillerMod\n\n24.8k11 gold badge2323 silver badges3131 bronze badges\n\nasked 1 hour ago\n\nYour Common SenseYour Common Sense\n\n157k99 gold badges5555 silver badges7474 bronze badges\n\n12\n\n  * 5\n\nAlthough I normally tend to be generous with interpreting the \"preserve author\nintent\" thing, I disagree with your answer edit. Adding an explanation to an\nanswer missing it is one thing but changing both the code and explanation\nentirely is another. You might as well post a new answer at this point.\n\n\u2013 Abdul Aziz Barkat\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * \"downright incorrect question\" -- shouldn't that have been closed then, rather than answered?\n\n\u2013 Dan Ma\u0161ek\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * @AbdulAzizBarkat then tell me, what is the goal of this site? Adding answers? Or providing one hundred twenty seven thousand people with a quality answer to their question, instead of some bullshit?\n\n\u2013 Your Common Sense\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * @DanMa\u0161ek it should have been. It wasn't. Now it's too late to discuss that.\n\n\u2013 Your Common Sense\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * 3\n\nIf you think an answer is wrong / not useful, etc. then downvote it.

Not only from people pushing in unwanted content but also people\nwho act like they own the place.\n\n\u2013 Gimby\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * 4\n\n\"suddenly a moderator swooped upon this question and made the most illogical\nedits * making question title to match the body, instantly invalidating most\nexisting answers\" Which edit are you referring to here? As far as I can tell,\nthe change of the title (and the body, in fact) was initially done by a user,\nthen reverted by you, then re-reverted by a moderator. At no point does a\nmoderator seem to have created an edit of the question on their own.\n\n\u2013 MisterMiyagi\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * @MisterMiyagi why even bother with such hairsplitting? Revert is an edit all the same.\n\n\u2013 Your Common Sense\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * 1\n\n@YourCommonSense Because it makes quite a difference whether mods did it in\nopposition to what users did, or to resolve a conflict between two opposing\npreferences of users. The primary driving force here seems to be still with\nusers, not moderators.\n\n\u2013 MisterMiyagi\n\n23 mins ago\n\n  * 1\n\nThat title edit on the title editing question - hilariously ironic and catty.\n\n\u2013 Daniel F\n\n22 mins ago\n\n  * 2\n\nTIP: you might get a better, more productive discussion if your question\nwasn't dripping with condescension.\n\n\u2013 President James K.

Clarifying the question by editing the title to better\nreflect the intent of the author doesn't invalidate the answers, they were\ninvalid to begin with.\n\nWhen the question title uses poor terminology it leads to poor outcomes:\n\n  * People find it in search when looking for something else\n  * It attracts misguided answers\n  * It may be used inappropriately as a duplicate target for other questions.\n\nThe edits that corrected the terminology in the title of this question are\nappropriate, reflect the original intent of the author, make the question\nclearer, and make the question easier to find by people with the same problem.\n\nYour edits to the top answer (and some answers on other questions) are\ninappropriate. They completely rewrite the answer and do not respect the\noriginal intent of the author. Here are some related meta threads:\n\n  * Is it OK to edit the question to change the author's intention? (Answer: no)\n  * Should a suggested edit which adds new content to an old answer with good upvotes be approved? (Answer: no)\n\nWhen you find that answers are not good enough you are welcome to provide your\nown answer, but please do not overwrite the answers of others.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered 1 hour ago\n\nStephen OstermillerModStephen Ostermiller\n\n24.8k11 gold badge2323 silver badges3131 bronze badges\n\n12\n\n  * It is very strange that people of here do not make a difference between freshly asked questions and old high traffic posts. Your primitive logic is only applicable to new|low traffic questions. The post in question is a part of library now. Google sends people with similar problem here. In order to follow the letter, you are denying them an answer, ruining the noble purpose of this site.\n\n\u2013 Your Common Sense\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * 5\n\n\"your primitive logic\". You are really not here to make friends, right? In any\ncase, barring historical locks, all posts are treated the same.\n\n\u2013 yivi\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * 2\n\nWhen the title of the question gets edited, Google adjusts the terms that it\nranks for accordingly. It usually takes at least two weeks, sometimes a couple\nmonths.\n\n\u2013 Stephen Ostermiller Mod\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * EXACTLY. So now people looking to remove that stupid entity from their data, will find answers that do a completely different thing and corrupt their data.\n\n\u2013 Your Common Sense\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * By the way, you didn't answer question which I asked: why, as a moderator, you are forcing people to create a forum-like discussion, when the tour page explicitly states there should be nothing like this.\n\n\u2013 Your Common Sense\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * 3\n\nI'm not sure I follow. Forums order posts by time posted, and allow for\ndiscussion with a back and forth between users. Every answer here is meant to\nbe independent and ordered by votes. Creating a new independent answer,\ngetting it voted up, and down-voting incorrect answers is how this non-forum\nwas designed to work.\n\n\u2013 Stephen Ostermiller Mod\n\n1 hour ago\n\n  * Forums order posts by user choice with one set as default. So this forum exactly does. And in order to find an answer which is not that ancient, you'd better to follow the other forums defaults, or you'll never find it, unless it was advertised in a hyping meta post. Anyway, it's not how it should be according to your sermons. It's about how it is. Any popular question strikingly resembles a forum page, where finding useful information is extremely difficult.\n\n\u2013 Your Common Sense\n\n49 mins ago\n\n  * 1\n\nI agree that a middling old answer with lots of upvotes is extremely hard to\nunseat from its top position. I've provided a very high-quality late answer to\nWhat is the difference between a URI, a URL, and a URN? that is ranked third\nby votes. I don't expect it every to reach the top. That is unfortunate. Stack\nOverflow hasn't figured out the solution to this problem. However, your\nproposed solution of overwriting the top answer has already been soundly\nrejected. Edits to existing posts should reflect the intent of the original\nauthor.\n\n\u2013 Stephen Ostermiller Mod\n\n39 mins ago\n\n  * Here we go again: I cannot think any other intent than providing a detailed, high quality answer. Can you?\n\n\u2013 Your Common Sense\n\n31 mins ago\n\n  * \"I don't expect it every to reach the top\" sounds like a competition. This entire site is centered about answer's score. Why not to edit that tour page then, making it \"To let people show off with their answers\". That would be honest description of the current attitude.\n\n\u2013 Your Common Sense\n\n26 mins ago\n\n  * 2\n\nI alone cannot be trusted to be the sole judge of how good my answer is. I am\nbiased. Overwriting another answer to inherit its votes is wrong. The only\nfair way is to have answers start with zero score and attract votes based on\ntheir merits.\n\n\u2013 Stephen Ostermiller Mod\n\n17 mins ago\n\n  * As far as intent goes, everything the user types in their answer shows intent. Providing a high quality answer is only part of the intent. When you replace an entire answer you are clearly changing the meaning of what they wrote. Changing the intended meaning of the answer through edits is forbidden.\n\n\u2013 Stephen Ostermiller Mod\n\n15 mins ago\n\nAdd a comment |\n\n## You must log in to answer this question.\n\n##\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
