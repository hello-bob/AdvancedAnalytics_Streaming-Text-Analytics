Why?\n\nElizabeth Hanna says she was fired by the American Diabetes Association after\nrefusing to approve recipes heaped with the additive made by a major donor\n\nNeil Barsky\n\nShare\n\nElizabeth Hanna had a simple job: help people with diabetes figure out what to\neat. Anyone with common sense knows this should probably not entail foods that\nmight increase people\u2019s risk of getting diabetes. But that\u2019s not necessarily\nthe thinking at the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the world\u2019s leading\ndiabetes research and patient advocacy group, which also receives millions of\ndollars from sponsors in the pharmaceutical, food and agricultural industries.\n\nAccording to a lawsuit Hanna recently filed against the ADA, the organization\n\u2013 which endorses recipes and food plans on its website and on the websites of\n\u201cpartner\u201d food brands \u2013 tried to get her to greenlight recipes that she\nbelieved flew in the face of the ADA\u2019s mission. These included recipes like a\n\u201ccucumber and onion salad\u201d made with a third of a cup of Splenda granulated\nartificial sweetener, \u201cautumnal sheet-pan veggies\u201d with a quarter cup of\nSplenda monk fruit sweetener and a \u201ccranberry almond spinach salad\u201d with a\nquarter cup of Splenda monkfruit sweetener.\n\nI helped advise the US government on the next likely pandemic. What I learned is alarming | Devi Sridhar\n\nRead more\n\nGuess which company gave more than $1m to the ADA in 2022? Splenda.\n\nHanna, a registered dietitian nutritionist and certified diabetes care and\neducation specialist with \u201c16 years of experience in the field of medical\nnutrition therapy\u201d, according to the lawsuit, says the ADA and in particular\nthe Nicole Johnson, the ADA\u2019s vice-president of operations for the science and\nhealthcare division \u2013 \u201ca former Miss America who has traded upon the dreams\nand aspirations of people with diabetes to reach fame and fortune\u201d \u2013 pressured\nher to endorse what she believed were unhealthy and unethical claims.\n\nHanna refused, according to the lawsuit, and complained internally; she was\nfired in October of last year, in what she believes was an act of retaliation\nand silencing. Her lawsuit also alleges that a higher-up, \u201capparently\nconscious that her prior statements would not support a poor performance\nfinding for Hanna ... fraudulently altered, modified and/or destroyed\u201d a\nperformance review. The ADA denies the allegations made in Hanna\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe Hanna lawsuit should be read against the backdrop of the global diabetes\nand obesity epidemics. The United States has some of the best medical research\ninstitutions in the world, and other countries look to us for guidance on how\nto best treat diseases such as diabetes. But as someone who was diagnosed with\ntype 2 diabetes three years ago, I can attest that the dietary and medicinal\nguidance one gets from doctors and the ADA can be worse than the condition.\nThe result is what the former head of the World Health Organization has called\n\u201ca slow-motion disaster\u201d, that led to the deaths of 2 million people in 2019.\n\nHanna filed her lawsuit against the ADA in New Jersey in November. Her lawsuit\npaints a picture of an organization more beholden to its corporate benefactors\nthan the 127 million Americans with diabetes or pre-diabetes \u2013 echoing the\nkinds of criticisms that you can read in online diabetes forums, where one\nperson charges the ADA with existing \u201cin service of physicians and sponsors,\nnot patients. They are in the business of selling pharmaceutical and\nnutritional products. It\u2019s in their best interest for people to remain sick.\u201d\n\nAnother complains: \u201cI truly believe that the entire medical establishment,\nincluding the ADA, wants to keep diabetics diabetic in order to continue to\nreap the [revenue] paid for prescriptions every year.\u201d\n\nThat might sound harsh. Yet, according to Hanna\u2019s lawsuit, the ADA went\nthrough \u201cno less than four individuals in the director of nutrition position\nsince 2019 and no less than three individuals in the associate director of\nnutrition position since 2020\u201d, with previous ADA nutritionists allegedly\nfired or driven out after refusing to comply with what they believed were\nunethical and unscientific demands. The lawsuit goes on to suggest that\ncompanies such as Splenda had a direct line to the ADA\u2019s highest authorities.\n\nAfter Hanna declined to approve recipes she considered inappropriate,\naccording to her lawsuit, an ADA colleague advised her that Splenda \u201cwould\nescalate the issue to the ADA\u2019s chief executive officer, Charles Henderson,\nbut instead it appears that Splenda raised the issue to Robert Gabbay MD (\u201cDr\nBob\u201d), chief scientific officer of the science and healthcare division\u201d. Hanna\nlater learned \u201cthat Splenda refused to make the suggested changes to bring\n[the recipes] into conformity with nutritional science and continued to demand\napproval\u201d.\n\nThe Splenda arrangement, the lawsuit argues, was simply \u201ca scheme to defraud\nthe American people by approving and endorsing recipes submitted by Splenda\n... when the ADA knew that those recipes were contrary to ... well-established\nand emerging scientific principles\u201d.\n\nIn 1976, researchers discovered trichlorogalactosucrose, a highly sweet-\ntasting chemical compound that they dubbed \u201csucralose\u201d. Splenda successfully\nmarketed sucralose as a sugar substitute; since 1991, Splenda has sold \u201cmore\nthan 100 billion yellow packets\u201d, the brand\u2019s website boasts, and become by\nfar the most popular artificial sweetener in the US. (Splenda also sells sugar\nsubstitutes derived from natural sources such as monk fruit and stevia.)\n\nSucralose is far more concentrated than sucrose, the compound in table sugar;\nthe human body cannot metabolize sucralose like sugar, so it passes through\nwithout the body absorbing its calories. Sucralose is mixed with fillers to\ncreate Splenda, which contains fewer calories than sugar and is allowed to be\nmarketed as a calorie-less sugar substitute, though it does contain some\ncalories.\n\nA large share of Splenda\u2019s consumers are people with diabetes; Splenda\nadvertises its sweeteners as a tool for wellness generally and diabetes\nmanagement specifically. In a press release this January celebrating Splenda\u2019s\n25th anniversary, Ted Gelov, the chair and CEO of the Heartland Food Products\nGroup, Splenda\u2019s parent company, said: \u201cThis anniversary is not just about our\nbrand; it\u2019s about the countless individuals who have trusted Splenda to be a\npart of their health and wellness journey.\u201d\n\nYet research has suggested that Splenda may wreak havoc on gut biome health\nand lead to increased glucose intolerance in a way similar to regular sugar.\nIn fact, just last summer, at the very same time Hanna was battling with her\nbosses, the ADA\u2019s own journal Diabetes Care published a study, drawn from 13\nyears of data from 105,588 participants, that concluded that there were\n\u201cpositive associations between artificial sweetener intakes and increased\n[type-2 diabetes] risk\u201d that \u201cstrengthen the evidence that these additives may\nnot be safe sugar alternatives\u201d.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said that non-sugar-sweeteners such as\nSplenda may contribute to \u201crisk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases\nand mortality in adults\u201d. According to the CDC, as Hanna\u2019s lawsuit cites, high\nblood-sugar levels can put a person with diabetes at risk of diabetic\nketoacidosis, or DKA, which can cause coma or death.\n\nHanna\u2019s lawsuit says that she told higher-ups at ADA that she was\nuncomfortable endorsing recipes \u201cthat promoted the use of non-nutritive\nsweeteners, like Splenda, sprinkled on whole foods like vegetables and beans\u201d;\nthat the ADA\u2019s own guidelines banned \u201capproval of recipes that used non-\nnutritive sweeteners on whole foods\u201d; and that she and her team had only\napproved Splenda-based recipes in the past in situations in which \u201cthe non-\nnutritive sweeteners were being used to cut down on sugar and calories\u201d.\n\nThere is \u201cno reason, other than taking Splenda\u2019s money, for the ADA to\nrecommend that people with diabetes add massive amounts of Splenda to cucumber\nsalad\u201d, Hanna\u2019s complaint argues. In response to questions about the Splenda\nlawsuit, the ADA said it cannot comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nThe Splenda affair is far from the first time the ADA was caught with its hand\nin the corporate cookie jar. In 2006, the New York Times published an\ninvestigation into the ADA\u2019s entanglement with pharmaceutical and food\ncompanies. In the article, the ADA\u2019s chief medical officer boasted that the\norganization had turned down millions of dollars in prospective fees from\nvarious food companies interested in forging partnerships. \u201cWe tightened\nthings up quite a bit,\u201d Richard Kahn, then the organization\u2019s chief scientific\nand medical officer, said.\n\nWell, not exactly. In fact, at the time, the ADA had just inked a $1.5m\nsponsorship deal with Cadbury Schweppes, the world\u2019s largest confectioner.\n\u201cMaybe the American Diabetes Association should rename itself the American\nJunk Food Association,\u201d said one consumer advocate.\n\nKahn next offered one of the most startling comments about nutrition and\ndiabetes one will ever read: \u201cThere is not a shred of evidence that sugar, per\nse, has anything to do with diabetes,\u201d he told the Times.\n\nLast year, the ADA signaled it still has not lost its appetite for\ncarbohydrate-rich foods. In March of 2023, it announced a partnership with the\nIdaho Potato Commission that made Idaho potatoes the first vegetable to be\nincluded in the ADA\u2019s Better Choices For Life program.\n\n\u201cWith a mission to prevent and cure diabetes and improve the lives of all\npeople affected by diabetes, the number one question the ADA receives is, what\ncan I eat?\u201d the Idaho Potato Commission press release read. \u201cMany wrongly\nbelieve they cannot eat potatoes.\u201d The release goes on to recommend that the\npotatoes should be prepared with the skins on, and should be baked or boiled,\nnot fried.\n\nSome clinicians say that it is terrible nutritional advice. \u201cPotatoes are a\nstarch and starches are simply chains of glucose, or sugars,\u201d Mariela Glandt,\na Harvard-trained endocrinologist who prescribes a low-carbohydrate diet to\nher patients in the Bronx, told me. \u201cSince diabetes is an intolerance to\nsugar, potatoes tend to make the diabetes worse. For people with diabetes, a\npotato is a potato.\u201d\n\nThe Idaho Potato Commission donated between $150,000 and $499,000 to the ADA.\nAccording to a recent annual report, the commission is the only one of the\nADA\u2019s top 35 donors that sells a vegetable.\n\nOne hopes that Elizabeth Hanna\u2019s lawsuit helps put an end to the ADA\u2019s\npractice of taking money from food companies that sell products that can harm\npeople with diabetes. Thanks to the work of journalistic mavericks such as\nGary Taubes and Nina Teicholz, there is already a vocal public that thinks the\nADA is making reckless food recommendations.\n\nIn a recent post on Taubes and Teicholz\u2019s Substack publication Unsettled\nScience, Teicholz poked fun at a recent ADA video featuring its current\ndirector of nutrition and wellness (Hanna\u2019s successor, in other words),\nrecommending that people with diabetes fill a full quarter of their plate with\ncarbohydrate-rich foods. The ADA video, which had nearly 2m views, elicited a\ntorrent of negative online reaction, Teicholz noted: \u201cQuite a few [of the\ncomments] wondered the obvious: why tell diabetics to eat starches\n(carbohydrates) when one could well define diabetes as simply a condition of\ncarbohydrate intolerance? One commenter suggested adding a Coke to complete\nthe meal.\u201d\n\nThe United States is a country where cereal companies market their sugary\nproducts to children, local news shows promote 7-Eleven\u2019s \u201cSlurpee Day\u201d,\nvegetables are scarce in many neighborhood stores and nearly 70% of American\nadults are considered overweight or obese. Diabetes, whether type 1 or type 2,\nis a serious and sometimes life-threatening condition that is directly tied to\nAmerica\u2019s dietary dysfunction. The ADA did not cause the problem. Elizabeth\nHanna\u2019s whistleblower lawsuit, however, suggests that the organization\u2019s\nnutritional advice is actually making it worse.\n\n  * Neil Barsky, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and investment manager, is the founder of The Marshall Project\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US news\n  * Death by diabetes: America's preventable epidemic\n  * Sugar (Business)\n  * Sugar (Society)\n  * Food\n  * Health\n  * Agriculture\n  * Pharmaceuticals industry\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
