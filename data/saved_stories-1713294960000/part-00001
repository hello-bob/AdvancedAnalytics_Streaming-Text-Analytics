Thin isolines are 250 km (160 mi) apart;\nthick lines 1,000 km (620 mi). Mollweide projection.\n\nA pole of inaccessibility with respect to a geographical criterion of\ninaccessibility marks a location that is the most challenging to reach\naccording to that criterion. Often it refers to the most distant point from\nthe coastline, implying a maximum degree of continentality or oceanity. In\nthese cases, a pole of inaccessibility can be defined as the center of the\nlargest circle that can be drawn within an area of interest without\nencountering a coast. Where a coast is imprecisely defined, the pole will be\nsimilarly imprecise.\n\n## Northern pole of inaccessibility[edit]\n\nNorthern pole of inaccessibility\n\nThe Northern pole of inaccessibility, sometimes known as the Arctic pole, is\nlocated on the Arctic Ocean pack ice at a distance farthest from any landmass.\nThe original position was wrongly believed to lie at 84\u00b03\u2032N 174\u00b051\u2032W. It is\nnot clear who first defined this point but it may have been Sir Hubert\nWilkins, who wished to traverse the Arctic Ocean by aircraft, in 1927. He was\nfinally successful in 1928. In 1968 Sir Wally Herbert came very close to\nreaching what was then considered to be the position by dogsled, but by his\nown account, \"Across the Roof of the World\", did not make it due to the flow\nof sea ice. In 1986, an expedition of Soviet polar scientists led by Dmitry\nShparo claimed to reach the original position by foot during a polar\nnight.^[citation needed]\n\nIn 2005, explorer Jim McNeill asked scientists from The National Snow and Ice\nData Center and Scott Polar Research Institute to re-establish the position\nusing modern GPS and satellite technology. This was published as a paper in\nthe Polar Record, Cambridge University Press in 2013.^[2] McNeill launched his\nown, unsuccessful, attempt to reach the new position in 2006, whilst measuring\nthe depth of sea-ice for NASA.^[3] In 2010 he and his Ice Warrior team were\nthwarted again by the poor condition of the sea ice.^[4]\n\nThe new position lies at 85\u00b048\u2032N 176\u00b09\u2032W, 1,008 km (626 mi) from the three\nclosest landmasses: It is 1,008 km from the nearest land, on Henrietta Island\nin the De Long Islands, at Arctic Cape on Severnaya Zemlya, and on Ellesmere\nIsland. It is over 200 km from the originally accepted position.^[5] Due to\nconstant motion of the pack ice, no permanent structure can exist at this\npole. As of February 2021, McNeill said that, as far as he could ascertain, no\none had reached the new position of the Northern Pole of Inaccessibility -\ncertainly not from the last landfall across the surface of the ocean and it\nremains an important scientific transect.\n\n## Southern pole of inaccessibility[edit]\n\nThe old Soviet Pole of Inaccessibility Station, revisited by Team N2i on 19\nJanuary 2007\n\nThe southern pole of inaccessibility is the point on the Antarctic continent\nmost distant from the Southern Ocean. A variety of coordinate locations have\nbeen given for this pole. The discrepancies are due to the question of whether\nthe \"coast\" is measured to the grounding line or to the edges of ice shelves,\nthe difficulty of determining the location of the \"solid\" coastline, the\nmovement of ice sheets and improvements in the accuracy of survey data over\nthe years, as well as possible topographical errors.\n\nThe pole of inaccessibility commonly refers to the site of the Soviet Union\nresearch station mentioned below, which was constructed at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n82\u00b06\u2032S 54\u00b058\u2032E / 82.100\u00b0S 54.967\u00b0E / -82.100; 54.967 (Pole of Inaccessibility\n(WMO))^[6] (though some sources give\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n83\u00b06\u2032S 54\u00b058\u2032E / 83.100\u00b0S 54.967\u00b0E / -83.100; 54.967 (South Pole of\nInaccessibility (IPHC))^[7]). This lies 1,301 km (808 mi) from the South Pole,\nat an elevation of 3,718 m (12,198 ft). Using different criteria, the Scott\nPolar Research Institute locates this pole at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n85\u00b050\u2032S 65\u00b047\u2032E / 85.833\u00b0S 65.783\u00b0E / -85.833; 65.783 (South Pole of\nInaccessibility (SPRI)).^[8]\n\nUsing recent datasets and cross-confirmation between the adaptive gridding and\nB9-Hillclimbing^[9] methods discussed below, Rees et al. (2021)^[10] identify\ntwo poles of inaccessibility for Antarctica: an \"outer\" pole defined by the\nedge of Antarctica's floating ice shelves and an \"inner\" pole defined by the\ngrounding lines of these sheets. They find the Outer pole to be at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n83\u00b054\u203214\u2032\u2032S 64\u00b053\u203224\u2032\u2032E / 83.904\u00b0S 64.890\u00b0E / -83.904; 64.890 (Antarctia's\nOuter Pole of Inaccessibility), 1,590.4 km (988.2 mi) from the ocean, and the\nInner pole to be at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n83\u00b036\u203236\u2032\u2032S 53\u00b043\u203212\u2032\u2032E / 83.610\u00b0S 53.720\u00b0E / -83.610; 53.720 (Antarctia's\nInner Pole of Inaccessibility), 1,179.4 km (732.8 mi) from the grounding\nlines.\n\nThe southern pole of inaccessibility is far more remote and difficult to reach\nthan the geographic South Pole. On 14 December 1958, the 3rd Soviet Antarctic\nExpedition for International Geophysical Year research work, led by Yevgeny\nTolstikov, established the temporary Pole of Inaccessibility Station (Polyus\nNedostupnosti) at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n82\u00b06\u2032S 54\u00b058\u2032E / 82.100\u00b0S 54.967\u00b0E / -82.100; 54.967 (Pole of Inaccessibility\nStation). A second Russian team returned there in 1967. Today, a building\nstill remains at this location, marked by a bust of Vladimir Lenin that faces\ntowards Moscow, and protected as a historical site.\n\nOn 11 December 2005, at 7:57 UTC, Ram\u00f3n Hernando de Larramendi, Juan Manuel\nViu, and Ignacio Oficialdegui, members of the Spanish Transantarctic\nExpedition, reached for the first time in history the southern pole of\ninaccessibility at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n82\u00b053\u203214\u2032\u2032S 55\u00b04\u203230\u2032\u2032E / 82.88722\u00b0S 55.07500\u00b0E / -82.88722; 55.07500 (British\nAntarctic Survey-accredited Pole of Inaccessibility), updated that year by the\nBritish Antarctic Survey. The team continued their journey towards the second\nsouthern pole of inaccessibility, the one that accounts for the ice shelves as\nwell as the continental land, and they were the first expedition to reach it,\non 14 December 2005, at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n83\u00b050\u203237\u2032\u2032S 65\u00b043\u203230\u2032\u2032E / 83.84361\u00b0S 65.72500\u00b0E / -83.84361; 65.72500 (British\nAntarctic Survey-accredited Pole of Inaccessibility). Both achievements took\nplace within an ambitious pioneer crossing of the eastern Antarctic Plateau\nthat started at Novolazarevskaya Station and ended at Progress Base after more\nthan 4,500 km (2,800 mi). This was the fastest polar journey ever achieved\nwithout mechanical aid, with an average rate of around 90 km (56 mi) per day\nand a maximum of 311 km (193 mi) per day, using kites as their power\nsource.^[11]^[12]^[13]^[14]\n\nOn 4 December 2006, Team N2i, consisting of Henry Cookson, Rupert Longsdon,\nRory Sweet and Paul Landry, embarked on an expedition to be the first to reach\nthe historic pole of inaccessibility location without direct mechanical\nassistance, using a combination of traditional man hauling and kite skiing.\nThe team reached the old abandoned station on 19 January 2007, rediscovering\nthe forgotten statue of Lenin left there by the Soviets some 48 years\npreviously.^[15] The team found that only the bust on top of the building\nremained visible; the rest was buried under the snow.^[16] The explorers were\npicked up from the spot by a plane from Vostok base, flown to Progress Base\nand taken back to Cape Town on the Akademik Fyodorov, a Russian polar research\nvessel.^[16]\n\nOn 27 December 2011, Sebastian Copeland and partner Eric McNair-Laundry also\nreached the\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n82\u00b06\u2032S 54\u00b058\u2032E / 82.100\u00b0S 54.967\u00b0E / -82.100; 54.967 (Pole of Inaccessibility\nStation) southern pole of inaccessibility. They were the first to do so\nwithout resupply or mechanical support, departing from Novolazarevskaya\nStation on their way to the South Pole to complete the first East/West\ncrossing of Antarctica through both poles, over 4,000 km (2,485 mi).^[17]\n\nAs mentioned above, due to improvements in technology and the position of the\ncontinental edge of Antarctica being debated, the exact position of the best\nestimate of the pole of inaccessibility may vary. However, for the convenience\nof sport expeditions, a fixed point is preferred, and the Soviet station has\nbeen used for this role. This has been recognized by Guinness World Records\nfor Team N2i's expedition in 2006\u20132007.^[18]\n\n## Oceanic pole of inaccessibility[edit]\n\nLocation of Point Nemo in relation to three closest coastline points\n\nThe oceanic pole of inaccessibility, also known as Point Nemo, is located at\nroughly\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n48\u00b052.6\u2032S 123\u00b023.6\u2032W / 48.8767\u00b0S 123.3933\u00b0W / -48.8767; -123.3933^[19] and is\nthe place in the ocean that is farthest from land. It represents the solution\nto the \"longest swim\" problem.^[20] The problem entails finding such a place\nin the world ocean where, if a person fell overboard while on a ship at sea,\nthey would be as far away from any land in any direction as possible. It lies\nin the South Pacific Ocean, and is equally distant from the three closest land\nvertices which are each roughly 2,688 km (1,670 mi) away. Those vertices are\nPandora Islet of the Ducie Island atoll (an island of the Pitcairn Islands) to\nthe north; Motu Nui (adjacent to Easter Island) to the northeast; and Maher\nIsland (near the larger Siple Island, off the coast of Marie Byrd Land,\nAntarctica) to the south.^[19] The exact coordinates of Point Nemo depend on\nwhat the exact coordinates of these three islands are, since the nature of the\n\"longest swim\" problem means that the ocean point is equally far from\neach.^[20]\n\nThe area is so remote that\u2014as with any location more than 400 kilometres (250\nmi) from an inhabited area\u2014sometimes the closest human beings are astronauts\naboard the International Space Station when it passes overhead.^[21]^[22]\n\nThe antipode of Point Nemo \u2013 the point on the surface of the Earth that is\ndiametrically opposite of it \u2013 is located at roughly\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n48\u00b052.6\u2032N 56\u00b036.4\u2032E / 48.8767\u00b0N 56.6067\u00b0E / 48.8767; 56.6067, in the Aktobe\nregion of western Kazahkstan, roughly 50 km (30 miles) SSE of the town of\nShubarkuduk.\n\nPoint Nemo is relatively lifeless; its location within the South Pacific Gyre\nblocks nutrients from reaching the area, and being so far from land it gets\nlittle nutrient run-off from coastal waters.^[21]\n\nTo the west the region of the South Pacific Ocean is also the site of the\ngeographic center of the water hemisphere, at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n47\u00b024\u203242\u2032\u2032S 177\u00b022\u203245\u2032\u2032E / 47.411667\u00b0S 177.379167\u00b0E / -47.411667; 177.379167\nnear New Zealand's Bounty Islands. The geographic center of the Pacific Ocean\nlies further north-west where the Line Islands begin, west from Starbuck\nIsland at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n4\u00b058\u2032S 158\u00b045\u2032W / 4.97\u00b0S 158.75\u00b0W / -4.97; -158.75.^[23]\n\n### History[edit]\n\nPoint Nemo was first identified by Croatian survey engineer Hrvoje Lukatela\n[fr] in 1992.^[22] In 2022, Lukatela recalculated the coordinates of Point\nNemo using OpenStreetMap data as well as Google Maps data in order to compare\nthose results with the coordinates he first calculated using Digital Chart of\nthe World data.^[20]\n\nThe point and the areas around it have attracted literary and cultural\nattention, and the point itself has become known as Point Nemo, a reference to\nJules Verne's Captain Nemo from the novel 20,000 Leagues Under the\nSea.^[21]^[19] The novel was a childhood favorite of Lukatela's, and such, he\nnamed it after Captain Nemo.^[19]^[24] The general area plays a major role in\nthe 1928 short story \"The Call of Cthulhu\" by H. P. Lovecraft, as holding the\nlocation of the fictional city of R'lyeh, although this story was written 66\nyears before the identification of Point Nemo.^[21]\n\nThe wider area is also known as a \"spacecraft cemetery\" because hundreds of\ndecommissioned satellites, space stations, and other spacecraft have been made\nto fall there upon re-entering the atmosphere, to lessen the risk of hitting\ninhabited locations^[25] or maritime traffic. The International Space Station\n(ISS) is planned to crash into Point Nemo in 2031.^[26]^[27]\n\n## Continental poles of inaccessibility[edit]\n\n### Eurasia[edit]\n\nProposed continental pole of inaccessibility at 46\u00b017\u2032N 86\u00b040\u2032E\n\nDistance to the sea in Asia, showing the two candidate locations for Eurasian\npole of inaccessibility.\n\nThe Eurasian pole of inaccessibility (EPIA) is located in northwestern China,\nnear the Kazakhstan border. It is also the furthest possible point on land\nfrom the ocean, given that Eurasia (or even merely Asia alone) is the largest\ncontinent on Earth.\n\nEarlier calculations suggested that it is 2,645 km (1,644 mi) from the nearest\ncoastline, located at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n46\u00b017\u2032N 86\u00b040\u2032E / 46.283\u00b0N 86.667\u00b0E / 46.283; 86.667 (Proposed Continental\nPole of Inaccessibility), approximately 320 km (200 mi) north of the city of\n\u00dcr\u00fcmqi, in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China, in the Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct\nDesert. The nearest settlements to this location are Hoxtolgay Town at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n46\u00b034\u2032N 85\u00b058\u2032E / 46.567\u00b0N 85.967\u00b0E / 46.567; 85.967 (Hoxtolgay), about 50 km\n(31 mi) to the northwest, Xazgat Township (Chinese: \u590f\u5b5c\u76d6\u4e61; pinyin: Xi\u00e0z\u012bg\u00e0i\nxi\u0101ng) at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n46\u00b020\u2032N 86\u00b022\u2032E / 46.333\u00b0N 86.367\u00b0E / 46.333; 86.367 (Xazgat), about 20 km (12\nmi) to the west, and Suluk at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n46\u00b015\u2032N 86\u00b050\u2032E / 46.250\u00b0N 86.833\u00b0E / 46.250; 86.833 (Suluk), about 10 km (6.2\nmi) to the east.^[citation needed]\n\nHowever, the previous pole location disregards the Gulf of Ob as part of the\noceans, and a 2007 study^[1] proposes two other locations as the ones farther\nfrom any ocean (within the uncertainty of coastline definition): EPIA1\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n44\u00b017\u2032N 82\u00b011\u2032E / 44.29\u00b0N 82.19\u00b0E / 44.29; 82.19 and EPIA2\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n45\u00b017\u2032N 88\u00b008\u2032E / 45.28\u00b0N 88.14\u00b0E / 45.28; 88.14, located respectively at\n2,510\u00b110 km (1,560\u00b16 mi) and 2,514\u00b17 km (1,562\u00b14 mi) from the oceans.^[1]\nThese points lie in a close triangle about the Dzungarian Gate, a significant\nhistorical gateway to migration between the East and West. EPIA2 is located\nnear a settlement called K\u0302as K\u0302\u00eer Su in a region named K\u0302\u00eez\u00eelk\u0302um (\u0642\u0649\u0632\u0649\u0644\u0642\u06c7\u0645)\nin the Karamgay Township [zh], Burultokay County.\n\nElsewhere in Xinjiang, the location\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n43\u00b040\u203252\u2032\u2032N 87\u00b019\u203252\u2032\u2032E / 43.68111\u00b0N 87.33111\u00b0E / 43.68111; 87.33111 in the\nsouthwestern suburbs of \u00dcr\u00fcmqi (\u00dcr\u00fcmqi County) was designated by local\ngeography experts as the \"center point of Asia\" in 1992, and a monument to\nthis effect was erected there in the 1990s. The site is a local tourist\nattraction.^[28]\n\nCoincidentally, the continental and oceanic poles of inaccessibility have a\nsimilar radius; the Eurasian poles EPIA1 and EPIA2 are about 178 km (111 mi)\ncloser to the ocean than the oceanic pole is to land.\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\nIn Africa, the pole of inaccessibility is at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n5\u00b039\u2032N 26\u00b010\u2032E / 5.65\u00b0N 26.17\u00b0E / 5.65; 26.17, 1,814 km (1,127 mi) from the\ncoast,^[1] near the town of Obo in the Central African Republic and close to\nthe country's tripoint with South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\n\n### North America[edit]\n\nThe North-West portion of the North American Pole of Inaccessibility.\n\nIn North America, the continental pole of inaccessibility is on the Pine Ridge\nReservation in southwest South Dakota about 11 km (7 mi) north of the town of\nAllen, 1,650 km (1,030 mi) from the nearest coastline at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n43\u00b022\u2032N 101\u00b058\u2032W / 43.36\u00b0N 101.97\u00b0W / 43.36; -101.97 (Pole of Inaccessibility\nNorth America).^[1] The pole was marked in 2021 with a marker that represents\nthe 7 Lakota Values and the four colors of the Lakota Medicine Wheel.^[29]\n\n### South America[edit]\n\nIn South America, the continental pole of inaccessibility is in Brazil at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n14\u00b003\u2032S 56\u00b051\u2032W / 14.05\u00b0S 56.85\u00b0W / -14.05; -56.85 (Continental Pole of\nInaccessibility in South America), near Aren\u00e1polis, Mato Grosso,^[1] 1,504 km\n(935 mi) from the nearest coastline. In 2017, the Turner Twins became the\nfirst adventurers to trek to the South American Pole of Inaccessibility.^[30]\nIn 2019, it turns out there is a second South American PIA to the north, its\nposition varying greatly between the two coastline datasets used.^[9]\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\nAustralian Pole of Inaccessibility\n\nIn Australia, the continental pole of inaccessibility is located at\n\nWikiMiniAtlas\n\n23\u00b010\u2032S 132\u00b016\u2032E / 23.17\u00b0S 132.27\u00b0E / -23.17; 132.27 (Continental Pole of\nInaccessibility of Australia)^[1] 920 km (570 mi) from the nearest coastline,\napproximately 161 km (100 miles) west-northwest of Alice Springs. The nearest\ntown is Papunya, Northern Territory, about 30 km (19 mi) to the southwest of\nboth locations.\n\n## Methods of calculation[edit]\n\nAs detailed below, several factors determine how a pole is calculated using\ncomputer modeling.\n\nPoles are calculated with respect to a particular coastline dataset. Currently\nused datasets are the GSHHG (Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-\nresolution Geography Database)^[31] as well as OpenStreetMap (OSM) planet\ndumps. The GSHHG claims 500-meter precision for 90% of identifiable coastal\nfeatures, while the volunteer-build OSM give no such guarantee but\nnevertheless \"have characteristics suggesting accuracy\".^[9]\n\nNext, a distance function must be determined for calculating distances between\ncoastlines and potential Poles. Some works tended to project data onto planes\nor perform spherical calculations; more recently, other works have used\ndifferent algorithms and high-performance computing with ellipsoidal\ncalculations.^[9]\n\nFinally, an optimization algorithm must be developed. Several works^[1]^[2]\nuse the 2007 adaptive grid method of Garcia-Castellanos and Lombardo. In this\nmethod, a rectangular grid of, e.g., 21\u00d721 points is created. Each point's\ndistance from the coastline is determined and the point farthest from the\ncoast identified. The grid is then recentered on this point and shrunk by some\nfactor. This process iterates until the grid becomes very small (e.g. at\n100-meter precision).^[2] Some authors claim this method could sink into a\nlocal minimum.^[10] A more recent method from 2019, B9-Hillclimbing by Barnes,\nuses a polyhedron in 3D space to find initial points evenly spaced by 100\nkilometers. These points are then grouped; the more \"unique\" points are\nsubject to numerical optimization (hill climbing, simulated annealing) for the\nfarthest distance, accelerated by a 3D Cartesian point cloud.^[9] Rees (2021)\nshows that the two methods agree with each other to meter level.^[10]\n\nTo date there has been no meta-study of the various works, and the algorithms\nand datasets they use. However, successive works have compared themselves with\nprevious calculations and claimed improvement. For example, the GC & L article\nfrom 2007 was able to find hundred-kilometer errors in the \"traditional\"\nEurasian PIA in Crane & Crane, 1987.^[1] Rees using the same method updated\nthe arctic PIA by over 200 kilometers.^[2] Barnes, which improved upon the\nmethod and the dataset used, was able to improve the GC & L South American PIA\nby 50 kilometers, showing that bad coastline data caused an error of 57\nkilometers in their reported PIA-to-coast distance.^[9]\n\n## List of poles of inaccessibility[edit]\n\nPoles of Inaccessibility, as determined by some authors, are listed in the\ntable below.
