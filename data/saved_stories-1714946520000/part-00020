What does this say about relying on\nGoogle as a source of technology for your projects?The first thing to say is\nthat there is no reliable single source for this news. Google has confirmed\nthat it has laid off members of its Python team and plans to move development\nelsewhere and it has done the same to the Dart and Flutter teams. Most of the\ninformation about the situation is coming from social media posts by members\nof the teams affected.The impact on Python, which is a huge open source\nsuccess, is likely to be insignificant for the community. For the individuals\ninvolved it is more serious and it is claimed that one of the people let go\nwas on the Python Steering Council and others were active in the wider Python\ncommunity, specifically PyType.At first sight this looks damaging to Google\nand its future use of Python, but it is unlikely the company cares that much\nabout where Python is going. It is used internally within the company to\ncreate some products and, of course, there is the small matter that Python is\nimportant in AI. However, none of Google's use of Python needs much in the way\nof innovation - what's already available fits the bill. Why bother to invest\nin the future when the present serves well enough?As to Dart and Flutter, your\nopinion depends on where you are coming from. Dart is Google's replacement for\nJavaScript and Flutter is a cross-platform UI that lets you create apps for\nAndroid, iOS, Linux, macOS and even Windows. You can also add Google's Fuchsia\noperating system to this list, but its future doesn't seem as bright as it\nonce did and it was hit with layoffs earlier this year. This is a more\nimportant reduction of support than in the Python case as a lot of programmers\nhave their product locked into Dart and Flutter without much hope of a future\nif Google drops support. Even though they are both open source the don't have\nthe momentum that Python has.Of course, the remaining team are putting on a\nbrave face and claming that the everything is still full steam ahead. A post\non Reddit from the Dart/Flutter product manager reads:\"We know ya'll care SO\nMUCH about the project and the team and the awesome ecosystem we've built\ntogether.You're nervous. I get it. We get it.You're betting on Flutter and\nDart.So am I. So is Google.\"But wait, here is the main issue - is Google\nbetting on Flutter and Dart? Over on Android it has Kotlin and Kotlin\nMultiplatform and anyway why does it need to encourage programmers to make\ntheir Android apps available on iOS?We all know that Google has a repuation\nfor shutting things down; the Google graveyard is a crowded place. Some\nprogrammers take the attitude that Google really is not to be relied on and\nthe only defence is to not use Google tech. However, this particular incident\nis a lesson in what is or is not trustworthy. The real question is not so much\n\"can I bet on Google technology X\" but \"is Google betting on technology X\".In\nthe case of Dart and Flutter it is difficult to see what commercial advantage\nGoogle gets from them. Indeed, at the time they were launched I asked myself\nthe question, \"why has Google done this?\".Google optimizes its profits, not\nits value to the community.\n\n#### More Information\n\nMore layoffs for the flutter teamMastodonGoogle layoffs: Sundar Pichai-led\ncompany fires entire Python team for \u2018cheaper labour\u2019\n\n#### Related Articles\n\nFlutter Takes OffLinkedIn Claims Flutter is Fastest Growing Skill For Software\nEngineersAll A Flutter - Google's Cross Platform App Framework Ready To\nGoGoogle's Dart Reborn As Cross Platform App LanguageThe Astonishing Rise Of\nDartGoogle Starts To Detail DartGoogle Spawns Yet Another Language - DartTo be\ninformed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly\nnewsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on Twitter, Facebook or\nLinkedin.| NVIDIA Releases Free Courses On AI 19/04/2024NVIDIA has jumped on\nthe AI bandwagon in a big way.
