I\u2019m not trying to be deliberately, annoyingly vague: something I\ncouldn\u2019t articulate kept me in her room.2Her vital signs looked normal and she\nwasn\u2019t in terrible distress. Yet I loitered despite the relentless\nadministrative pressure to see more patients, faster.\n\nGladys and I were chatting about her impending grandchild when, in less time\nthan it takes you to read this sentence, Gladys sat up, vomited a huge\nquantity of blood, her blood pressure bottomed out, and she lost\nconsciousness. I had to intubate, attempt a balloon tamponade, and initiate\nmassive transfusion protocol\u2014quickly. The ER team was able to stabilize\nher\u2014barely. Luckily, I was already in the room.\n\nTextbooks can\u2019t describe and standardized tests can\u2019t detect gestalt. Or, as\nGen Z would say, \u201cvibes.\u201d A lot of ER docs like \u201cspidey-sense\u201d\u2014the tingle that\nwhispers: \u201corder a CT scan to rule out a life-threatening diagnosis,\u201d though\nthe patient\u2019s symptoms don\u2019t exactly indicate it. Gestalt is built and honed\nby seeing thousands of patients. Do emergency medicine for 80 hours a week for\nthree to four years \u2014the length of an ER residency\u2014and a resident doctor will\nhave spent around 10,000 hours on direct patient care. It\u2019s during those\nencounters that doctors are (supposed to be) guided towards developing and\ndeepening the fundamental mental models that run in their cognitive background\nwhile evaluating each new patient.\n\nBut how does a doctor know if their models are accurate or adequate?\n\nAnswering that question really means asking if the education student doctors\nreceive is both adequately teaching the fundamentals as well as teaching\nresident physicians how to think about and evaluate their own thought\nprocesses. And Dan Luu\u2019s \u201cWhy don\u2019t schools teach debugging\u201d got me thinking\nabout the way science and medical education universally teaches the\nfundamentals: badly.\n\n> When I suggested to the professor^ that he spend half an hour reviewing\n> algebra for those students who never had the material covered cogently in\n> high school, I was told in no uncertain terms that it would be a waste of\n> time because some people just can't hack it in engineering. I was told that\n> I wouldn't be so naive once the semester was done, because some people just\n> can't hack it in engineering. I was told that helping students with remedial\n> material was doing them no favors; they wouldn't be able to handle advanced\n> courses anyway because some students just can't hack it in engineering. I\n> was told that Purdue has a loose admissions policy and that I should expect\n> a high failure rate, because some students just can't hack it in\n> engineering.\n\nThere seems to be a mass delusion in the sciences that someone\u2014not you, but\nsomeone\u2014must have, or at least should have already, taught a student the\nfundamentals by the time they get in front of you, so that you can focus on\nthe interesting, juicy, complex conversations, presumably with the \u201csmart\u201d\npeople who already get it, the smart people who can hack it. But most of the\npeople who get it had to get it somewhere3\u2014why shouldn\u2019t that somewhere be\nwith you?\n\nShare\n\nIn medicine, we often mistake the speed of initial understanding with a\nstudents\u2019 capacity for mastery. This expectation starts in pre-med courses.\nOrganic chemistry (\u201cO-chem\u201d) is the big pre-med \u201cweed out\u201d course because it\nboth requires high-volume memorization and is one of the first times students\nhave to learn a new way of thinking. In general chemistry, basic chemical\nequations are algebraic. The process of balancing two sides of an equation\nworks off a mathematical model most students see in high school. O-chem,\nhowever, demands that you think in the language O-chem provides, which is a\nlong list of various chemical reactions whose effects you memorize like\nvocabulary, and then you have to figure out how to use them to solve the\npuzzle of turning one chemical into another. You memorize the facts, then have\nto think in a new way to understand the fundamentals. You can\u2019t just\nregurgitate. O-chem problems, much like complex patients, have multiple\nsolutions. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard.\n\nLearning the language of chemistry to talk about chemistry resembles the way\ndoctors learn the language of the body so they can think about the body.\nThat\u2019s the only logical reason, apart from a de-facto IQ test, I can come up\nwith for having to take organic chemistry, because there\u2019s no practical\nutility for O-chem in day-to-day doctoring. I suspects it\u2019s also a test\u2014one of\nmany\u2014 to see if we\u2019re willing to torture ourselves and jump through hoops.\nExtra points to anyone who asks \u201cHow high?\u201d Masochism is heavily selected for\nin medical students, which is an essay topic for another time.\n\nMy O-Chem teacher was a lot like Luu\u2019s engineering prof, who assumed that\n\u201chacking it\u201d had more to do with inherent student capabilities rather than the\nquality of the teaching. On the first day of class, he announced that a\nquarter of the class would drop by the end of the month, and half of what\nremained would get a C or lower in a non-curved course. It seems like a sign\nof a lazy educator to announced he wouldn\u2019t be capable of adequately\nexplaining the material to students. Was half the room too stupid or lazy to\nunderstand? \u201cToo stupid to understand\u201d doesn\u2019t usually sign up to be 25% of a\n315 person O-Chem class at 7:30 a.m.\n\nI had a really hard time getting it. Although the professor had office hours\nthree times a week, showing up to them meant trading his ire for his help,\nwhich I (and many others) did. He said that, if I was having so much trouble\nunderstanding early on, I should leave, because some people won\u2019t get it.\nInstead, I found an outside tutor who helped me understand how to approach\nproblems, and change to a less linear way of thinking, and O-chem finally\nclicked. It was as if I was able to take all the words I\u2019d memorized and\nfinally speak the language, and think in that language, without having to\ntranslate. Was I slow on the uptake? Was my professor a bad teacher? Probably.\nNeither, however, precluded me from eventually getting it, suggesting both\nthat I had the necessary processing power, and someone could teach the\nmaterial.\n\nSpeed of understanding, however, only becomes more important as medical\neducation continues into residency.\n\nA doctor\u2019s foundational clinical mental models are built during residency, but\nthe apprenticeship model of residency has flaws. An attending physician (an\nattending is a physician who has completed residency ) may be a skilled\nclinician but a poor educator, or not have the time, patience, or inclination\nto educate residents. A resident may only have three years in which to gain\nthe practical, clinical knowledge they need to practice independently for the\nrest of their career. This puts a great deal of pressure on a student. But it\nshould also places the burden of that education on attending physicians, many\nof whom aren\u2019t given adequate tools and time to teach during their own\nworkdays.\n\nAn ER shift usually goes like this: One attending physician oversees an ER\n\u201cpod\\area\u201d and between 1-3 residents. Patients are assigned to that pod,\nresidents assign themselves to patients, and the attending is responsible for\nseeing and evaluating all the patients while supervising the residents. An ER\ndoctor sees, on average, 2-4 patients per hour, over a 8-12 hour shift, with\nmultiple patients being juggled at once (I\u2019ve cared for more than 20 active\npatients at a time). Patients who require intensive resuscitation or\nprocedures may need an hour or more of sustained attention, while the board\n(the list of patients assigned to a pod) backs up. Being an Emergency\nPhysician is about interruptions and fragmented time.\n\nEven if you haven\u2019t been in an ER lately, the news of worsening overcrowding,\nboarding times and uptick in patient visits is all over the news. It's worse\nthan you imagine. ER attendings are beholden to any number of administrative\nmetrics\u2014patient satisfaction, charting completion, door to doc times\u2014but\nespecially throughput speed. You have to \u201cmove the meat\u201d\u2014ER lingo for getting\npatients in and out of the department quickly\u2014to try and keep up with that\nendless stream of patients. Correcting a resident\u2019s incorrect treatment plan\nonly takes a moment, but stopping to interrogate the thought process that led\nthat resident to the wrong answer takes time during which another patient\narrives in anaphylactic shock, someone is bleeding onto the floor, another\nthree patients are vomiting and a gunshot wound is being wheeled into the\ntrauma bay. Those patients have to come first.\n\nTeaching during a shift interrupts a busy workflow and means that attendings\nhave to trade time completing their charts, for example, in order to teach,\nwhich then results in having to stay late or bring work home. Teaching or\nstaying late doesn\u2019t (usually) come with extra compensation, so the motivation\nneeds to be intrinsic.\n\nThere are attempts to standardize resident education and overcome the\nvariables that affect teaching on-shift, mostly with weekly \u201cconferences\u201d\nconsistent of educational lectures, the quality of which also varies\nextensively depending on the lecturer. Let\u2019s just say most wouldn\u2019t be invited\nonto a TEDx stage. It\u2019s not a bad way to learn the basics and facts: things\nlike the biochemical changes cause by a kidney with stage III kidney disease,\nhow to perform a simple interrupted suture, or how to calculate cardiac risk\nstratification scores.\n\nBut the fundamentals\u2014which I\u2019m defining as how you use and manipulate those\nbasic facts to solve real problems in real patients, like when to use that\nsimple interrupted suture or whether other factors would recommend a mattress\nsuture, how a patient\u2019s cardiac risk score interacts with other facts to\ninfluence a treatment plan, or what do when your kidney failure patient is\ncoding and you don\u2019t know their complete medication history\u2014are learned mostly\nin real-time, on shift. How to think about facts, how to use facts, is where\nthe art of medicine lies.\n\nEven simulation-lab patient encounters don\u2019t adequately recreate the\nchallenges of rapid decision making in a busy ER, and tend to focus on common\npatient presentations. But patient\u2019s rarely read the textbook and present\naccordingly. Basic facts are only tools. The facts don\u2019t teach you to think\nlike a doctor, any more than being able to identify a hammer makes someone a\nhandyman.\n\nThere are a lot of misaligned incentives in resident education: attendings are\njudged by metrics of speed and patient satisfaction, residents want to learn\nand be seen as \u201cgood\u201d so they can graduate and be recommended for a job, and\nhospitals want more patients to be seen, faster.\n\nBecause of the top to bottom relentless pressure to move the meat, a \u201cgood\u201d\nresident, a resident who can \u201chack it\u201d is a resident who is able to work\nquickly with minimal risk to patients. Who wouldn\u2019t want to work with a\nresident whose incentives are aligned with yours? I know I feel more\noptimistic about the day when I see that I\u2019m working with a resident who moves\nquickly and can help me do my job more smoothly.\n\nBut that means that someone\u2014 not me, but someone\u2014must have, or should have\nalready, taught the student the fundamentals by the time they get in front of\nme, so that I\u2019m not slowed down and can focus on the interesting, juicy,\ncomplex conversations with a resident who \u201cgets it.\u201d Residents are smart. They\nknow that\u2019s what\u2019s desirable: already knowing the things that they are really\nthere to learn.\n\nThe residents who master material in a way that allows them to work quickly,\nwhether or not they understand deeply, are prized and praised. Problem is that\ndeep understanding usually requires sacrificing speed (initially), and there\u2019s\nan inevitable bottleneck that happens when someone is laying the groundwork\nfor fluency in a new skill.\n\nHow can we tell when the resident is quick and right via luck or guessing\u2014and\nwhen they\u2019re quick and right because they understand? We can\u2019t, really, not\nuntil the right situation presents itself. And the truth is, doctors can get\naway with a lot of algorithmic thinking before a patient presents who is both\ncomplex in unexpected ways and in ways that might kill them if you get it\nwrong.\n\nThat\u2019s what separates the physicians from many other members of the medical\nteam: The training to get away from the algorithm and use a deep understanding\nto come up with novel solutions. That\u2019s also why algorithmic thinking can be\nso dangerous. So many patients never bother reading the flowcharts before they\narrive and only presenting with the allowed symptoms.\n\nSkill can be confused with speed of mastery and competence can be confused\nwith confidence, because we want it to be. What I keep coming back to is that\nso much of science and medical training comes down to perception of skill, as\nopposed to actual skill.\n\nFor example, when I was in residency, a friend was given feedback that she\nwasn\u2019t seeing enough patients on shifts. When she asked how many she saw\ncompared to other residents, she was told that they didn\u2019t have the numbers,\nbut they could see she was slow, and she needed to show she could keep up, or\nwouldn\u2019t be able to hack it. The electronic medical record had a search option\nwhere you could pull up the number of patient\u2019s you\u2019d seen in the last six\nmonths. So she looked. And then she looked up the numbers of all the other\nresidents. Out of thirteen residents, she was ranked #6. When my friend\nbrought this information back to the program director, she was told that it\ndidn\u2019t matter what the numbers showed, she gave the perception of being slow,\nand needed to fix it. Her program director wouldn\u2019t even look at the data.\n\nI remember presenting a patient to one of my attendings and saying that, given\nhis clinical picture and my list of possible diagnoses, I wasn\u2019t sure what the\nbest next test would be.\n\n\u201cI want you to be sure,\u201d my attending said.\n\n\u201cYes, I want to be sure as well, but I\u2019ve never seen this and so I\u2019m not\nsure.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to be more confident in your plans.\u201d\n\nI countered that I\u2019d be more confident in my plan if I could discuss the few\ndifferent plans I\u2019m considering and learn which was the most appropriate to\nthe patient and why, so that the next time I saw a similar patient, I had a\nbetter understanding of why I was doing what I\u2019m doing instead of just being\nperceived as knowing it. That\u2019s when I\u2019d be confident. Plus, I only had three\nyears to get that kind of feedback before I was the one providing that\nfeedback to others. There\u2019s never another time during their career when a doc\nhas the opportunity to run every single patient they see by a more experienced\nclinician.\n\nI\u2019m as skeptical of residents (and attendings) with too much confidence as\nnone: I don\u2019t want my residents to be too confident, to be too thoroughly\nconvinced of their own rightness and way. I want them to have the freedom to\nadmit when they don\u2019t know everything. Because they don\u2019t. I don\u2019t, either. In\nThe Name of the Rose, William of Baskerville is a monk but also a proto-\ndetective in the mold of Sherlock Holmes, and when he\u2019s trying to solve a\nseries of increasingly bizarre murders, he tells his sidekick, Adso, that \u201cwe\nmustn\u2019t dismiss any hypothesis, no matter how farfetched.\u201d And so it often is\nin medicine. Being okay with uncertainty will make both residents and\nattending\u2019s lives better, and more importantly, patient lives safer.\n\nThe problem of perception as the most important metric of skill is a problem\nwith most forms of physician evaluation. When going for your quarterly review,\nyour boss, who doesn\u2019t directly watch you interact with patients, uses nursing\nand peer perception of your skills, as well as certain metrics of speed and\npatient satisfaction scores, to determine the depth of your knowledge and\nability to care for patients.\n\nThere\u2019s no direct, objective observation of your interactions with patients,\nor discussion of how you break down complex problems, or philosophy to\napproaching new patients, or what you do when you\u2019re faced with an unfamiliar\nproblem, all of which give a much deeper understanding of who someone really\nis as a physician. When you need a new job, you\u2019re required to get letters of\nrecommendations from colleagues who have also never watched you interact with\npatients directly, and who don\u2019t have any idea what kind of a doctor you\nactually are, just what kind of a doctor you appear to be.\n\nThis is a systems problem. Most physicians who are hired to work in\nresidencies didn\u2019t get formal training on how to educate. They happen to work\nat a site that has residents, and so they have to teach. We base how we teach\non how we were taught. We praise for what we were praised for. I\u2019m not immune.\nI catch myself doing it, too. We teach our residents how to succeed in a\nsystem where a doctor\u2019s success and a patient\u2019s successful care don\u2019t always\nspring from the well of thought.\n\nIncentivizing deep learning and deep thought means reducing the time pressure\non both attendings and residents. If hospitals valued people over profits,\nthey\u2019d hire more attendings to both see patients and supervise, spreading both\nthe patient care and educational workload. The existing arguments that this is\ncost prohibitive is laughable. For example David Reich, CEO of Mt. Sinai\nHospital in NYC made $1,808,577 in 2023 (excluding bonuses, which can be\nimpressive). According to Glassdoor (and on par with my experience) the salary\nfor a full time ER physician in NYC is between $200-275k a year.\n\nThe center for Medicare and Medicaid is the primary source of graduate medical\neducation (residency) funding. Per the Graham Center interactive GME data tool\nMt. Sinai received around $175k a year per resident, and pays them a salary of\n$84,479\\year, leaving 90K to pay for their \u201ceducation.\u201d Remember that ER\npatients are being billed, and the physician pay comes from hospital profit.\nThere should be plenty of room to hire a few additional physicians, if\nadministrators stopped to remember that the residents being trained will one\nday be the attendings caring for them.\n\nUntil incentives align, and the hospitals reward and pay physicians for doing\nthe work of educating in addition to their clinical work; until teaching\nattendings have adequate training on how to educate; until hospitals are\nwilling to staff adequately so there\u2019s time to teach, the system will remain\nbroken.\n\nPart Two (coming soon): How can we teach our students (and ourselves) to think\nbetter within the system we have?\n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, consider the Go Fund Me that\u2019s funding my husband\nJake\u2019s ongoing cancer treatment.

But most\npeople aren\u2019t Paul Erdos who began doing mathematics at the age of three,\nalthough, like Erdos, many medical students and residents are fuled by\namphetamines. You can thank Freud for that. Incidentally, Erdos is responsible\nfor one of my favorite science quotes: \u201cA mathematician is a machine for\nturning coffee into theorems.\u201d\n\n### Subscribe to Everything Is An Emergency\n\nBy Bess Stillman \u00b7 Launched 8 months ago\n\nI'm Bess Stillman: ER doctor, writer, and wife to Jake Seliger, who is\ncurrently dying of SCC of the tongue.
