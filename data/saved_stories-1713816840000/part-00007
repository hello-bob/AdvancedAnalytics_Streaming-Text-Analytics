Shari Cantor began taking metformin during the\npandemic after she read that it may help protect against serious infections.\n\nShari and Michael Cantor both take metformin. They are both in their mid-60s\nand say they feel healthy and full of energy. Theresa Oberst/Michael Cantor\nhide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nTheresa Oberst/Michael Cantor\n\nShari and Michael Cantor both take metformin. They are both in their mid-60s\nand say they feel healthy and full of energy.\n\nTheresa Oberst/Michael Cantor\n\nThe Cantors are in their mid-60s and both say they feel healthy and have lots\nof energy. Both noticed improvements in their digestive systems \u2013 feeling more\n\"regular\" after they started on the drug,\n\nMetformin costs less than a dollar a day, and depending on insurance, many\npeople pay no out-of-pocket costs for the drug.\n\n\"I don't know if metformin increases lifespan in people, but the evidence that\nexists suggests that it very well might,\" says Steven Austad, a senior\nscientific advisor at the American Federation for Aging Research who studies\nthe biology of aging.\n\n### An old drug with surprising benefits\n\nMetformin was first used to treat diabetes in the 1950s in France. The drug is\na derivative of guanidine, a compound found in Goat's Rue, an herbal medicine\nlong used in Europe.\n\nThe FDA approved metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the U.S. in\nthe 1990s. Since then, researchers have documented several surprises,\nincluding a reduced risk of cancer. \"That was a bit of a shock,\" Austad says.\nA meta-analysis that included data from dozens of studies, found people who\ntook metformin had a lower risk of several types of cancers, including\ngastrointestinal, urologic and blood cancers.\n\nAustad also points to a British study that found a lower risk of dementia and\nmild cognitive decline among people with type 2 diabetes taking metformin. In\naddition, there's research pointing to improved cardiovascular outcomes in\npeople who take metformin including a reduced risk of cardiovascular death.\n\nAs promising as this sounds, Austad says most of the evidence is\nobservational, pointing only to an association between metformin and the\nreduced risk. The evidence stops short of proving cause and effect. Also, it's\nunknown if the benefits documented in people with diabetes will also reduce\nthe risk of age-related diseases in healthy, older adults.\n\n\"That's what we need to figure out,\" says Steve Kritchevsky, a professor of\ngerontology at Wake Forest School of Medicine, who is a lead investigator for\nthe Tame Trial.\n\nThe goal is to better understand the mechanisms and pathways by which\nmetformin works in the body. For instance, researchers are looking at how the\ndrug may help improve energy in the cells by stimulating autophagy, which is\nthe process of clearing out or recycling damaged bits inside cells.\n\n### Shots - Health News\n\n### You can order a test to find out your biological age. Is it worth it?\n\nResearchers also want to know more about how metformin can help reduce\ninflammation and oxidative stress, which may slow biological aging.\n\n\"When there's an excess of oxidative stress, it will damage the cell. And that\naccumulation of damage is essentially what aging is,\" Kritchevsky explains.\n\nWhen the forces that are damaging cells are running faster than the forces\nthat are repairing or replacing cells, that's aging, Kritchevsky says. And\nit's possible that drugs like metformin could slow this process down.\n\nBy targeting the biology of aging, the hope is to prevent or delay multiple\ndiseases, says Dr. Nir Barzilai of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who\nleads the effort to get the trial started.\n\n### The ultimate in preventative medicine\n\nBack in 2015, Austad and a bunch of aging researchers began pushing for a\nclinical trial.\n\n\"A bunch of us went to the FDA to ask them to approve a trial for metformin,'\nAustad recalls, and the agency was receptive. \"If you could help prevent\nmultiple problems at the same time, like we think metformin may do, then\nthat's almost the ultimate in preventative medicine,\" Austad says.\n\nThe aim is to enroll 3,000 people between the ages of 65 and 79 for a six-year\ntrial. But Dr. Barzilai says it's been slow going to get it funded. \"The main\nobstacle with funding this study is that metformin is a generic drug, so no\npharmaceutical company is standing to make money,\" he says.\n\nBarzilai has turned to philanthropists and foundations, and has some pledges.\nThe National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health,\nset aside about $5 million for the research, but that's not enough to pay for\nthe study which is estimated to cost between $45 and $70 million.\n\nThe frustration over the lack of funding is that if the trial points to\nprotective effects, millions of people could benefit. \"It's something that\neverybody will be able to afford,\" Barzilai says.\n\nCurrently the FDA doesn't recognize aging as a disease to treat, but the\nresearchers hope this would usher in a paradigm shift \u2014 from treating each\nage-related medical condition separately, to treating these conditions\ntogether, by targeting aging itself.\n\nFor now, metformin is only approved to treat type 2 diabetes in the U.S., but\ndoctors can prescribe it off-label for conditions other than its approved use.\n\nMichael and Shari Cantor's doctors were comfortable prescribing it to them,\ngiven the drug's long history of safety and the possible benefits in delaying\nage-related disease.\n\n\"I walk a lot, I hike, and at 65 I have a lot of energy,\" Michael Cantor says.\nI feel like the metformin helps,\" he says. He and Shari say they have not\nexperienced any negative side effects.\n\nResearch shows a small percentage of people who take metformin experience GI\ndistress that makes the drug intolerable. And, some people develop a b12\nvitamin deficiency. One study found people over the age of 65 who take\nmetformin may have a harder time building new muscle.\n\n### Shots - Health News\n\n### Millions of women are 'under-muscled.' These foods help build strength\n\n\"There's some evidence that people who exercise who are on metformin have less\ngain in muscle mass, says Dr. Eric Verdin, President of the Buck Institute for\nResearch on Aging. That could be a concern for people who are under-muscled.\n\nBut Verdin says it may be possible to repurpose metformin in other ways \"There\nare a number of companies that are exploring metformin in combination with\nother drugs,\" he says. He points to research underway to combine metformin\nwith a drug called galantamine for the treatment of sarcopenia, which is the\nmedical term for age-related muscle loss. Sarcopenia affects millions of older\npeople, especially women.\n\nThe science of testing drugs to target aging is rapidly advancing, and\nmetformin isn't the only medicine that may treat the underlying biology.\n\n\"Nobody thinks this is the be all and end all of drugs that target aging,\"\nAustad says. He says data from the clinical trial could stimulate investment\nby the big pharmaceutical companies in this area. \"They may come up with much\nbetter drugs,\" he says.\n\nMichael Cantor knows there's no guarantee with metformin. \"Maybe it doesn't do\nwhat we think it does in terms of longevity, but it's certainly not going to\ndo me any harm,\" he says.\n\nCantor's father had his first heart attack at 51. He says he wants to do all\nhe can to prevent disease and live a healthy life, and he thinks Metformin is\none tool that may help.\n\nFor now, Dr. Barzilai says the metformin clinical trial can get underway when\nthe money comes in.\n\n### Shots - Health News\n\n### 7 habits to live a healthier life, inspired by the world's longest-lived\ncommunities\n\nThis story was edited by Jane Greenhalgh\n\n  * metformin\n  * longevity\n  * Aging\n\n## Shots\n\nHealth News From NPR\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n  * \u00a9 2024 npr\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 162 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
