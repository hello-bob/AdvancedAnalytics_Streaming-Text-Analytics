Those changes have come not only in terms of sound,\nthough; lyrics have also evolved as time has passed.\n\nSo what has changed about the lyrics we can\u2019t get out of our heads? After\nanalyzing 12,000 English-language pop, rock, rap, R&B, and country songs\nreleased between 1970 and 2020, researcher Eva Zangerle of Innsbruck\nUniversity and her team have found that lyrics have been getting simpler and\nmore repetitive over time. This trend is especially evident in rap and rock,\nbut it applies to other genres as well. Another thing Zangerle\u2019s team\ndiscovered is that lyrics tend to be more personal and emotionally charged now\nthan they were over 50 years ago.\n\n## Know the words...\n\n\u201cJust as literature can be considered a portrayal of society, lyrics also\nprovide a reflection of a society\u2019s shifting norms, emotions, and values over\ntime,\u201d the researchers wrote in a study recently published in Scientific\nReports.\n\nThat's why Zangerle created a dataset to find out the different ways in which\nlyrics have changed. She and her colleagues used the virtual music\nencyclopedia Genius, which also provides release year and genre information.\nFrom the lyric dataset she created, the team pulled data having to do with the\nstructure, language, emotion, and complexity of songs. Five genres\u2014pop, rock,\nrap, R&B, and country\u2014were chosen because they are genres with the most lyrics\nthat were popular on streaming platform last.fm.\n\nThere were two types of analyses done on the music. The first looked for the\nlyrical trends that were most prevalent for each release year, while the\nsecond went deeper into online views of lyrics, characteristics of lyrics\n(such as emotion), and release year. The researchers obtained the play count\nfrom last.fm and the lyrics view count from Genius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow often people view the lyrics is unexpectedly important. Unlike play counts\nof songs, this stat shows how important lyrics are despite the popularity (or\nlack thereof) of the song or genre.\n\n## ...and the meaning\n\nWhat can lyrics tell us about different genres and eras? Results for the first\nanalysis showed that certain characteristics are most important across genres,\nincluding repeated lines, choruses, and emotional language. The genres in\nwhich emotion was most important were country and R&B.\n\nRepeated lines increased over the decades in all genres analyzed, and later\nlyrics contain more choruses than earlier ones. These increases are further\nproof that songs have become simpler and more repetitive since the \u201870s.\n\nLyrics were also more personal and angrier across all genres studied. Personal\nlyrics were identified by the number of personal pronouns, which especially\nincreased in rap and pop, while rock and R&B saw moderate increases and\ncountry stayed nearly the same. Anger and other negative emotions (as\nexpressed through words associated with these emotions) also increased across\ngenres. Rap had the highest increase here, especially in anger, while country\nshowed the lowest increase. Positive emotions decreased in pop and rock, while\nthey increased somewhat in rap.\n\nWhen looking at the results from the second analysis, Zangerle noticed that\nlyric views were higher for older rock songs than newer ones, and vice versa\nfor country, which had lower view counts for older songs and higher view\ncounts for new songs. This means that the popularity of country lyrics has\nincreased over time in comparison to rock. Listening count had no relationship\nto this, meaning interest in the sound of a song was not related to interest\nin its lyrics.\n\nThrough the decades, it seems that music has gotten simpler, more repetitive,\nand more emotional\u2014especially angrier\u2014and more personal. The study didn\u2019t look\ninto what events and societal changes might have influenced this trend, but\nthe researchers still had some sociological insights. They think pop is all\nabout record sales and what's hot from one moment to the next, while the\npreference for older rock songs shows that the main audience of rock is\nmiddle-class and against commercialism. Emotionally charged words could also\nconvey feelings toward shifts in society.\n\nThe researchers \u201cbelieve that the role of lyrics has been understudied and\nthat our results can be used to further study and monitor cultural artifacts\nand shifts in society,\u201d the study said.\n\nScientific Reports, 2024.
