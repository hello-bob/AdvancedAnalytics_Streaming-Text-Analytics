These sneaky practices are unethical\n> applications of established UX knowledge to make interface designs that harm\n> users instead of helping them.\n\n\u201cDark design patterns\u201d are ways of cheating users through a variety of\nmisleading user interfaces \u2014 or sometimes simply by making it unnecessarily\ndifficult to accomplish actions that the user wants but that the company wants\nto prevent, such as canceling a subscription. Simply evil!\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently filed suit\nagainst Amazon.com, alleging that it stepped over the line, intending to dupe\ncustomers into subscriptions they never sought and then preventing them from\nescaping the traps they had unwittingly entered. This case is not resolved, so\nwe don\u2019t know if Amazon\u2019s dark patterns are actually illegal. In my review of\nthe case, I deemed some of Amazon\u2019s dark design patterns to be sufficiently\negregious to be worth 4 of 5 skulls, whereas others only earned 2 of 5 skulls.\n\nEvil design has been with us since the beginning of the web. The Government of\nIndia is now talking steps to fight dark design. (Dall-E)\n\nOn November 30, 2023, the Government of India issued new regulations outlawing\nmany dark design patterns in India. (Warning: this link leads to an 11-page\nPDF file that includes the new regulations first in Hindi and then in\nEnglish.) I\u2019ll list and evaluate the dark patterns they mention in the new\nIndian regulations, even though this will be at the risk of giving certain\npeople bad ideas.\n\nHopefully, the fact that these dark design patterns are now illegal in the\nworld\u2019s largest country will serve as an impediment to more companies\nembracing these nasty ideas. In any case, I have always believed more in\nshining light on nefarious dark practices than in trying to keep them secret.\n\nIn total, the regulations list 13 dark design patterns, which I\u2019m discussing\nbelow. As you can see, they are of different degrees of obnoxiousness, but\nthey are all bad and should be avoided by ethical UX professionals. Now you\nhave my word for this as well as the word of the Indian Government.\n\n#\n\nFalse Urgency\n\nThis is defined as falsely stating or implying a sense of urgency or scarcity\nso as to mislead a user into making an immediate purchase or taking immediate\naction. Examples are showing the false popularity of a product or service to\nmanipulate user decision, or stating that quantities of a particular product\nor service are more limited than they actually are.\n\nThis dark design pattern is an abuse of the well-known scarcity principle from\nbehavioral economics, which says that limited availability of a product\nincreases its perceived value and consumer demand.\n\nSince false urgency involves actively lying to users, it\u2019s one of the worst\ndark patterns, and so I rate it:\n\nFalse Urgency creates an illusion of limited availability to rush buying\ndecisions. (Dall-E)\n\n#\n\nBasket Sneaking\n\nIn the US, the equivalent name would be \u201cCart Sneaking,\u201d since it\u2019s more\ncommon to refer to a shopping cart than a shopping basket when discussing\necommerce UX.\n\n\u201cBasket sneaking\u201d means adding additional items such as products, services,\npayments to charity or donations at the time of checkout from a platform,\nwithout the consent of the user, such that the total amount payable by the\nuser is more than the amount payable for the product or service chosen by the\nuser.\n\nThe regulations sensibly clarify that free samples, providing complimentary\nservices, or the addition of necessary fees disclosed at the time of purchase,\nshall not be considered as basket sneaking.\n\n(Of course, this begs the question of whether such fees are indeed disclosed\nwith sufficient usability and not hidden in a part of the page that we know\nfrom eyetracking attracts little attention.)\n\nAssuming that the extra items are still listed as line items in the shopping\ncart, this may not quite rise to the level of a 5-skull design sin. However,\nbecause basket sneaking is basically stealing from any users who don\u2019t\nscrutinize their checkout forms carefully, I still rate it:\n\nBasket Sneaking secretly adds items at checkout, thus inflating the cart\ntotal. (Dall-E)\n\n#\n\nConfirmshaming\n\nConfirmshaming (also sometimes called manipulinks) means using a phrase,\nvideo, audio or any other means to create a sense of fear, shame, ridicule,\nguilt in the mind of the user so as to nudge the user to act in a certain way\nthat results in the user purchasing a product or service from the platform or\ncontinuing a subscription of a service, primarily for the purpose of making\ncommercial gains by subverting consumer choice. The example given in the\nIndian regulations is a travel site that the phrase, \u201cI will stay unsecured,\u201d\nwhen a user does not add insurance to the purchase of an airline ticket.\n\nWhile unpleasant, I don\u2019t view confirmshaming as nearly as harmful as the\nother dark design patterns, since it doesn\u2019t actually trick users. It simply\ngoes overboard with another behavioral economics principle: that of framing\n(how the presentation of information influences decisions, with different\nwordings or contexts leading to varying perceptions and choices by\nindividuals). I only judge this dark pattern to rate:\n\nConfirmshaming nudges with ridicule or fear, using guilt as a sales tool.\n(Dall-E)\n\n#\n\nForced Action\n\nThis happens when a user is prevented from buying or subscribing to the\nproduct or service originally intended by the user without taking an action\nthat would require the user to buy additional goods, subscribe or sign up for\nan unrelated service, or share personal information.\n\nThis dark pattern can rate different numbers of skulls, depending on the\nspecific implementation. One example is when a vendor simply has forced\nbundles, where you can\u2019t buy product A without also buying product B. This is\ncommon when selling cable TV subscriptions and is often strongly disliked by\ncustomers who obviously don\u2019t like paying for channels they don\u2019t watch.\nHowever, if the bundling is clearly disclosed upfront, then I don\u2019t view this\nas a dark pattern in terms of user interface design. Overcharging is not dark;\nit\u2019s simply unpleasant, and customers can take it or leave it as they please,\ndepending on whether they judge the value of the one thing they want to be\nhigher or lower than the price of a bundle that includes some worthless items.\nUnder the assumption of clear up-front disclosure, this type of bundling (or\nforced purchase of more than the user really wants) rates:\n\nOn the other hand, several scenarios described in the Indian regulations are\nmuch more nefarious. For example, \u201cprohibiting a user from continuing with the\nuse of product or service for the consideration originally paid and contracted\nfor, unless they upgrade for a higher rate or fee.\u201d This is clearly bait-and-\nswitch.\n\nAnother nasty example is forcing a user to download an unintended or unrelated\nseparate app to access a service originally advertised on another app. For\nexample, a user downloads app, X, meant for listing houses for rent. Once the\nuser downloads X, they are forced to download another app, Y, for hiring a\npainter. Without downloading Y, the user is unable to access any services on\nX.\n\nSuch examples of forced action, where the add-on is not known before the user\nhas committed to the first step are truly bad and rate:\n\n#\n\nSubscription Trap\n\nThis dark pattern is the common case of making it substantially harder to\ncancel a subscription than it was to start the subscription in the first\nplace. Of course, the is no end to how difficult a company can make it to\nescape its clutches, but the most common cases of this dark design pattern\nrate:\n\nSubscription Traps entrap users with a difficult exit process or convoluted\nunsubscribe features. (Dall-E)\n\n#\n\nInterface Interference\n\nThis approach manipulates the user interface in ways that (a) highlights\ncertain specific information; and (b) obscures other relevant information\nrelative to the other information; to misdirect a user from taking an action\nas desired.\n\nObviously, any UX design has to make some things more prominent than others.\nThat\u2019s not dark in and of itself. As I have always said, if everything is\nhighlighted, nothing is highlighted.\n\nThe question is how unbalanced the information presentation is, especially in\nregards to downplaying options that users are likely to want, such as closing\nan advertising popup. In extreme cases, options or disclosures needed by the\nuser can be so hidden that this pattern can be worth up to 5 skulls. But in\nmost cases, you can still see the information you need, even when it\u2019s played\ndown more than it should be, for example by using a smaller typeface. These\nmore common cases rate:\n\n#\n\nBait and Switch\n\nThis is the practice of advertising a particular outcome based on the user\u2019s\naction but deceptively serving an alternate outcome.\n\nFor example, a website offers a quality product at a cheap price, but when the\nconsumer is about to pay or buy, the site states that the product is no longer\navailable and instead offers a similar-looking product that is more expensive.\n\nThis is sufficiently deceptive to be worth almost 5 skulls, but under the\nassumption that the user is informed that the new product is not the one he or\nshe originally wanted, I will rate this practice as:\n\n#\n\nDrip Pricing\n\nThis covers several different cases where the full price is not revealed\nupfront.\n\n  * Various extra fees are only revealed surreptitiously within the user experience, which used to be very common on travel sites.\n\n  * A product or service is advertised as free without appropriate disclosure of the fact that the continuation of use requires later payment.\n\n  * The final price is not disclosed until after the purchase, i.e., charging an amount higher than the amount disclosed at the time of checkout.\n\nThese three examples are at quite different levels of egregiousness. In order\nof the above listing, I rate them:\n\n#\n\nDisguised Advertisement\n\nThis is when advertisements are cloaked as other types of content, such as\nuser-generated content or news articles. Even worse examples include false\nadvertisements, which are designed to blend in with the rest of an interface\nin order to trick customers into clicking on them.\n\nDefinitely annoying, but ultimately not as harmful as the other dark design\npatterns discussed here, so I rate this practice as:\n\n#\n\nNagging\n\nThis term covers designs where a user is disrupted and annoyed by repeated and\npersistent interactions, in the form of requests, information, options, or\ninterruptions, to effectuate a transaction.\n\nAbsolutely annoying, but more shade of gray instead of a truly dark pattern,\nas long as it\u2019s clear what the annoying interruptions are asking for. The\nreason this design pattern does qualify as dark after all is that the\ndesigners hope that users will eventually click \u201cOK\u201d in the classic fly-\nswatting behavior to make the interruptions do away without actually reading\nwhat they\u2019re agreeing to. I rate this:\n\nNagging repeatedly disrupts the interaction with annoying sale prompts.\n(Dall-E)\n\n#\n\nTrick Question\n\nThis is a dark use of the UX writer\u2019s craft, to employ confusing or vague\nwording, double negatives, or other similar tricks, in order to misguide or\nmisdirect a user from taking the desired action or leading the consumer to\ntake a specific response or action.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I am a writer at heart, but I find it offensive to\ndeliberately write content that is misleading or difficult to understand. I\nrate this:\n\n#\n\nBilling Surprise\n\nThe Indian regulations cover the process of generating and collecting payments\nfrom consumers on a recurring basis in a software as a service (SaaS) business\nmodel by exploiting positive acquisition loops in recurring subscriptions to\nget money from users as surreptitiously as possible.\n\nThe key word that makes billing practices dark is \u201csurreptitiously.\u201d Examples\ninclude no notification to the user when a free trial is converted to paid and\nsilent recurring transactions whereby the user\u2019s account is debited without\nbeing notified.\n\nThese practices come very close to stealing from users and rate:\n\nBilling Surprises silently auto-renew subscriptions without notice. (Dall-E)\n\n#\n\nRogue Malware\n\nUsing ransomware or scareware to mislead or trick users into believing there\nis a virus on their computer, to convince them to pay for a fake malware\nremoval tool that actually installs malware on their computer.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call this a design pattern, I would call it an actual criminal act.\nBut given that it\u2019s on the list, it surely rates:\n\n#\n\nEven More Dark Patterns to Avoid\n\nSadly, even this list of 13 dark design patterns is not comprehensive. The\nability of rogue designers to think up ways of hurting users is endless. I am\nsure new dark patterns will be invented in future years.\n\nWe have 3 defenses against dark patterns:\n\n  * Ethical UX professionals can push back on requests to add dark patterns to their design, by explaining the long-term harm this customer abuse will do to any brand.\n\n  * We can shame those companies that deploy dark design patterns, explaining why these designs are known to be harmful.\n\n  * As the final recourse, regulations like the new Indian rules might result in fines or other consequences for companies that persist with particularly harmful design practices.\n\n#\n\nDark Design as Blues and Country Songs\n\nI made two songs with Udio about this article:\n\n  * Country music song in Iambic Tetrameter\n\n  * Jazz song in 12-bar Blues Meter\n\n  * Rockabilly song in Ballad Meter\n\nAll three songs were made with Udio. I added light AI animation with Leonardo\nto the first two music videos and used Runway to animate the third, more\nrealistic image for the Rockabilly video. We\u2019re clearly not talking Pixar-\nlevel animation yet, though Runway is much better than Leonardo. Let me know\nin the comments whether you prefer light animation or a simple still picture\nwhile the music plays.\n\nCountry song about dark design patterns: listen on YouTube.
