I was always pining for faster speeds: faster\nqueries, faster page navigations, faster file downloads, etc. Whatever I\nwanted to do with a computer, bandwidth seemed like the sole limiting factor\nto a great experience.\n\nSo that\u2019s why I still often mistakenly equate a faster connection with a\nfaster (and better) experience on the web. And I often need reminding that\u2019s\nnot necessarily true.\n\nThat\u2019s what Dan does well in his post. He points out how slow devices are\nbecoming as big of an impediment to a good experience on the web as slow\nconnections.\n\n> CPU performance for web apps hasn't scaled nearly as quickly as bandwidth\n> so, while more of the web is becoming accessible to people with low-end\n> connections, more of the web is becoming inaccessible to people with low-end\n> devices even if they have high-end connections.\n\nHere\u2019s that last line again:\n\n> more of the web is becoming inaccessible to people with low-end devices even\n> if they have high-end connections\n\nIt\u2019s kind of incredible how the world is being flooded with bandwidth (I mean,\nyou can get internet beamed to you anywhere on earth from a string of\nsatellites.)\n\nThe question is quickly shifting from how slow is your connection to how slow\nis your device?\n\n## Newer !== Better, and More Usable for the Minority is More Usable For the\nMajority\n\nTo borrow from Devine\u2019s warning about equating newer with better: if the new\nwebsite runs slower on old hardware, is the new website better than the old\nwebsite?\n\nHere\u2019s Dan talking about how old websites beat out new ones in performance:\n\n> Another pattern we can see is how the older sites are, in general, faster\n> than the newer ones, with sites that (visually) look like they haven't been\n> updated in a decade or two tending to be among the fastest.\n\nThis reminds me of an accessibility ethos which asserts that things that are\nmade usable for marginalized individuals are invariable the most usable for\neveryone \u2014 regardless of capability.\n\nSimilarly: websites that were made to be fast on older, slower connections\n(and devices) are invariably the fastest for everyone \u2014 regardless of device\nor connection speed.\n\n> When using slow devices or any device with low bandwidth and/or poor\n> connectivity, the best experiences, by far, are generally the ones that load\n> a lot of content at once into a static page.\n\nThis is undoubtedly true for high-end devices as well. When you use something\nin the way it was designed to be used, it\u2019s going to perform at its peak \u2014 and\nthe web was designed, from its inception, to load a lot of static content up\nfront.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating to see from Dan\u2019s research how the output of modern blogging\nplatforms (such as Medium or Substack) are not really competitive in terms of\npure speed and performance with the \u201cold\u201d blogging / bulletin board platforms.\n\n## Overriding Defaults is the Fastest Path to Jank\n\nTo paraphrase Johan, the fastest path to janky websites is overriding browser\ndefaults. Dan illustrates this perfectly in his piece, which I quote at\nlength:\n\n> Sites that use modern techniques like partially loading the page and then\n> dynamically loading the rest of it, such as Discourse, Reddit, and Substack,\n> tend to be less usable... Although, in principle, you could build such a\n> site in a simple way that works well with cheap devices but, in practice\n> sites that use dynamic loading tend to be complex enough that the sites are\n> extremely janky on low-end devices. It's generally difficult or impossible\n> to scroll a predictable distance, which means that users will sometimes\n> accidentally trigger more loading by scrolling too far, causing the page to\n> lock up. Many pages actually remove the parts of the page you scrolled past\n> as you scroll; all such pages are essentially unusable. Other basic web\n> features, like page search, also generally stop working. Pages with this\n> kind of dynamic loading can't rely on the simple and fast ctrl/command+F\n> search and have to build their own search.\n\nThe bar to overriding browser defaults should be way higher than it is.\n\n> A lot of the optimizations that modern websites do, such as partial loading\n> that causes more loading when you scroll down the page, and the concomitant\n> hijacking of search (because the browser's built in search is useless if the\n> page isn't fully loaded) causes the interaction model that works to stop\n> working and makes pages very painful to interact with.\n\nThe foundations of web browser design lay in static document exploration and\nnavigation. The bar to overriding the interaction UI/X for these kinds of\nexperiences should be way higher than it is.\n\nI find it ironic how, in our search for ticking Google\u2019s performance\ncheckboxes like \u201cfirst contentful paint\u201d and therefore providing better user\nexperiences, we completely break other fundamental aspects of the user\nexperiences like basic scrolling and in-document search.\n\n## A Parting Thought on a Core Tenent of the Web: Universal Accessibility\n\nI want to leave you with this quote from Dan\u2019s article. It begs us all to\nquestion whether the new stuff we\u2019re making now is as universally accessible\nas what we\u2019ve had (and taken for granted) up to this point.\n\n> The impact of having the fastest growing forum software in the world\n> [Discourse] created by an organization whose then-leader was willing to\n> state that he doesn't really care about users who aren't \"influential users\n> who spend money\", who don't have access to \"infinite CPU speed\", is that a\n> lot of forums are now inaccessible to people who don't have enough wealth to\n> buy a device with effectively infinite CPU.\n\nAre we leaving the internet better than we found it?\n\n> If [this attitude] were an anomaly, this wouldn't be too much of a problem,\n> but [it\u2019s] verbalizing the implicit assumptions a lot of programmers have,\n> which is why we see that so many modern websites are unusable if you buy the\n> income-adjusted equivalent of a new, current generation, iPhone in a low-\n> income country.\n\nI need to ponder on my own part in this more. Great food for thought.\n\n##### Reply\n\n  * Email\n  * Mastodon\n  * Twitter\n\n", "frontpage": false}
