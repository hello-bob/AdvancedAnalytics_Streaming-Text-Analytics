This is shown by a study\nconducted by researchers at Uppsala University and elsewhere. \u201cThe students\nimproved their ability to identify manipulative techniques in social media\nposts and to distinguish between reliable and misleading news,\u201d says Professor\nThomas Nygren.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step towards equipping young people with the tools they\nneed to navigate in a world full of disinformation. We all need to become\nbetter at identifying manipulative strategies \u2013 prebunking, as it is known \u2013\nsince it is virtually impossible to discern deep fakes, for example, and other\nAI-generated disinformation with the naked eye,\u201d says Thomas Nygren, Professor\nof Education at Uppsala University.\n\nAlong with three other researchers, he conducted a study involving 516 Swedish\nupper secondary school students in different programmes at four schools. The\nstudy, published in the Journal of Research on Technology in Education,\ninvestigated the effect of the game Bad News in a classroom setting \u2013 this is\nthe first time the game has been scientifically tested in a normal classroom.\nThe game has been created for research and teaching, and the participants\nassume the role of spreader of misleading news. The students in the study\neither played the game individually, in pairs or in whole class groups with a\nshared scorecard \u2013 all three methods had positive effects. This surprised the\nresearchers, who believed students would learn more by working at the computer\ntogether.\n\n\u201cThe students improved their ability to identify manipulative techniques in\nsocial media posts and to distinguish between reliable and misleading news,\u201d\nNygren comments.\n\nThe study also showed that students who already had a positive attitude\ntowards trustworthy news sources were better at distinguishing disinformation,\nand this attitude became significantly more positive after playing the game.\nMoreover, many students improved their assessments of credibility and were\nable to explain how they could identify manipulative techniques in a more\nsophisticated way.\n\nThe researchers noted that competitive elements in the game made for greater\ninterest and enhanced its benefit. They therefore conclude that the study\ncontributes insights for teachers into how serious games can be used in formal\ninstruction to promote media and information literacy.\n\n\u201cSome people believe that gamification can enhance learning in school.\nHowever, our results show that more gamification in the form of competitive\nelements does not necessarily mean that students learn more \u2013 though it can be\nperceived as more fun and interesting,\u201d Nygren says.\n\nParticipating researchers: Carl-Anton Werner Axelsson (M\u00e4lardalen and\nUppsala), Thomas Nygren (Uppsala), Jon Roozenbeek (Cambridge) and Sander van\nder Linden (Cambridge).\n\nThe study received funding from the Swedish Institute for Educational\nResearch.\n\nAxelsson, C.
