Some of these emperor colonies have been\nraising chicks high up on permanent ice shelves.\n\nEvery January, when the chicks are around five months old, they undergo a\nprocess known as fledging. During this process, the chicks lose their baby\nfeathers and leave their colony for the first time \u2014 jumping from an enormous\ncliff into the ocean to take their first swim.\n\n## A Heart-Stopping Jump Filmed For The First Time\n\nWhile these huge jumps have been witnessed by scientists before, Gregory\nfilmed this rare and heart-stopping behavior for the first time for\ntelevision.\n\nIn the extraordinary footage filmed for Secrets of the Penguins, a colony of\nchicks is seen making their way along the edge of the huge ice cliff, moving\ntogether toward the edge before stopping.\n\nEventually, one brave chick takes the first leap from the summit and smashes\ninto the icy ocean waters below.\n\nOnce this penguin swims off to fill its stomach with fish, prompting the\nothers to follow suit. From there, hundreds of chicks are seen jumping off the\ncliff into the ocean.\n\nAccording to scientists, this is the first-ever video footage of emperor\npenguin chicks leaping from such a high cliff. Scientists who monitor penguins\nfrom satellites in space say this phenomenon is extremely rare.\n\nIn a press release, the National Geographic revealed Gregory used a newly\nreleased camera drone, equipped with a telephoto lens, which allowed him to\ncapture the animals\u2019 behavior from the air like never before \u2014 without\ndisrupting or impacting the penguins.\n\n\u201cFilming the fledging of emperor penguins presented a unique set of challenges\nas the passage only takes place when the sea ice reaches its most unstable\ntime of the year,\u201d National Geographic says in a statement.\n\n\u201cBertie and his team took every measure to ensure the safety of the crew and\nwildlife by assembling a world-class safety team.\u201d\n\nImage credits: All photos by National Geographic/Bertie Gregory .\n\nCulture, News\n\nbabypenguin, dronefootage, emperorpenguins, nationalgeographic\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSatellite Images Discover a New Emperor Penguin Colony in Antarctica\n\nThe Cuteness of Antarctic Penguins\n\nEmperor Penguins Find Camera, Pose for Selfies\n\nRare Photos From Early Antarctic Expeditions Digitized for First Time\n\nDiscussion\n\nTrending Articles\n\nFilm Director: If Guns Require Licenses, Why Not Cameras?\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nMKBHD Calls Humane AI Pin the \u2018Worst Product\u2019 He\u2019s Ever Reviewed\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nThis \u2018Photo\u2019 Was Made From an 84-Year-Old Woman\u2019s Memory\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\nThe Trailer for the World\u2019s First Fully AI-Generated Film is Here\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nPhotographer Helps Grizzly Bear Narrowly Escape Oncoming Train\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nReading mode: Light Dark\n\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc.
