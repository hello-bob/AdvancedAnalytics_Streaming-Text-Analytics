In the former vein, [antirez] has ported a ZX Spectrum emulator\nto the Pi Pico.\n\nZX2040, as it is known, is a port of [Andre Weissflog\u2019s] existing ZX spectrum\nemulator. It\u2019s designed for use on the compact embedded Pi Pico platform,\nusing ST77xx TFT displays. To that end, it has a UI optimized for small, low\nresolution screens and minimal buttons. After all, very few Pi Picos come with\na full QWERTY keyboard attached.\n\nCertain hacks are necessary to make it all work; the chip is overclocked to\nget things humming fast enough. The emulator also runs upscaling or\ndownscaling in realtime as needed. This allows the emulator to run with a\nvariety of displays, almost none of which are a direct match for the ZX\nSpectrum\u2019s original resolution of 256\u00d7192 pixels.\n\nCode is on Github for the curious, including a great run down from [antirez]\non everything that makes it tick. If you want to play ZX Spectrum games on a\nkeychain, you\u2019d do well to start here. There are other projects to emulate it\non the Pico, too!
