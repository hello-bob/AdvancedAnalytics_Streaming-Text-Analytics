To the man, a dentist, it\nlooked just like a jawbone. He could even count the teeth\u2014one, two, three,\nfour, five, at least. They seemed much like the ones he stares at all day at\nwork.\n\nThe jawbone appeared at once very humanlike and very old, and the dentist took\nhis suspicions to Reddit. Could it be that his parents\u2019 floor tile contains a\nrare human fossil? Quite possibly. It\u2019s \u201cclearly hominin,\u201d John Hawks, a\npaleoanthropologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who also blogged\nabout the discovery, told me in an email. (Hominin refers to a group including\nmodern humans, archaic humans such as Neanderthals, and all of their\nancestors.) It is too soon to say exactly how old the jawbone is or exactly\nwhich hominin it belonged to, but signs point to something\u2014or someone\u2014far\nolder than modern humans. \u201cWe can see that it is thick and with large teeth,\u201d\nAm\u00e9lie Vialet, a paleoanthropologist at the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire\nNaturelle in Paris, wrote in an excited email to me about the jawbone. \u201cThat\u2019s\narchaic!\u201d\n\nAn international team of researchers, including Vialet, is now in contact with\nthe dentist to study the floor tile. (I\u2019m not naming him for privacy reasons.)\nThis thin slice of jawbone has a story to tell\u2014about a life lived long ago, in\na world very different from ours. It is in fragments of hominin bone like this\none that we begin to understand our past as humans.\n\nHow could a hominin bone have ended up in someone\u2019s tiled floor in the first\nplace? Travertine, the type of rock from which this tile was cut, is a popular\nbuilding material used perhaps most famously by ancient Romans to construct\nthe Colosseum. Today, a good deal of the world\u2019s travertine\u2014including the\nfloor tile with the jawbone, according to the dentist\u2014is quarried in Turkey,\nfrom a region where the stone famously forms natural thermal pools that\ncascade like jewels down the hillside. Travertine tends to be found near hot\nsprings; when mineral-rich water gurgles to the surface, it leaves a thin\nshell over everything that it touches. In time, the layers accrue into thick,\nopaque travertine rock. If in the middle of this process a leaf falls in or an\nanimal dies nearby, it too will become entombed in the rock. \u201cFossils are\nrelatively common in travertine,\u201d says Andrew Leier, a geologist at the\nUniversity of South Carolina.\n\nHominin fossils, specifically, are rare, but at least one has been found in\nTurkish travertine before. In 2002, a Turkish geologist named M. Cihat Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek\ndiscovered a slice of human-looking skull sitting on a shelf in a tile\nfactory. He brought the 35-millimeter-thick fragment to John Kappelman, an\nanthropologist at the University of Texas at Austin, and later also to Vialet\nin Paris. The skull turned out to belong to Homo erectus, an archaic human\nspecies that walked the Earth more than 1 million years ago, long before\nmodern humans. Vialet thinks the newly discovered jawbone could be just as\nold.\n\nVialet and her collaborators are now hoping to extract the tile, ideally\nintact, from the hallway where it\u2019s been cemented in place. (The dentist is\nsoliciting suggestions on Reddit for how to do so without also destroying his\nparents\u2019 floor.) Then, chemical signatures in the rock can be used to date the\nfossil. Vialet also hopes to generate a 3-D model of the jawbone with micro-CT\nscanning, tracing the curve of the mandible and the roots of the teeth to find\nanatomical clues about its origin.\n\nThe teeth could prove to be the real gold mine. Their hard enamel likely\ncontains carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen isotopes whose presence could hint at\nwhat the hominin once ate. Shooting high-energy X-rays at the teeth can also\nreveal how quickly they grew, which is useful because different hominins\ndeveloped at different rates, Kappelman told me in an email. The spongy\ninsides of teeth also tend to be good sources of ancient DNA. (Given the high\ntemperature of the hot springs where travertine deposits form, Kappelman\nthinks DNA probably wasn\u2019t well preserved, but extracting it is still worth a\ntry.) Bit by bit, researchers will begin to piece together a portrait of the\nhominin, who died by a hot spring so many eons ago only to be unearthed and\nthen cut into floor tile for someone\u2019s home.\n\nPaleotonologists and quarries, as Hawks wrote in his blog post, exist in an\n\u201cuneasy symbiosis.\u201d The industrial extraction process unearths far more rock\nthan scientists could ever hope to, but it leaves science at the whim of\ncommercial practice. Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek, the Turkish geologist who spotted the skull in\nthe early 2000s, says far fewer fossils are being found in travertine quarries\nthese days because the technology has changed. Twenty years ago, companies\nwere able to extract only the \u201cuppermost part of the travertine body, which is\nrich in fossils,\u201d he wrote in an email, but now they can dig deeper, into\nlayers devoid of fossils. Today, he says, discovering a fossil in the\ntravertine quarries is rare.\n\nIndustrial quarrying can also damage the fossils it does uncover. That Homo\nerectus skull, for example, was already chopped up by the time Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek saw it,\nand the rest has never been found. In 2007, back when the skull discovery was\nfirst announced, his collaborator Kappelman mused in a draft of a press\nrelease about where other pieces might have ended up. \u201cTurkish travertine is\nsold all around the world today,\u201d Kappelman said back then. \u201cSome lucky\nshopper at Home Depot might just be surprised to find a slice of Homo erectus\nentombed in her kitchen countertop.\u201d\n\nTo this day, Kappelman told me, he still goes straight to the travertine-tile\nsection whenever he shops at Home Depot. The rest of this jawbone has to be\nsomewhere.\n\nSarah Zhang is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
