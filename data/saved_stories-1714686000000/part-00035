Ask me anything!\n\nSearchBot is thinking ...\n\n\u00d7\n\nPowered by Search Engine Land (and love)\n\nOpenAI has been developing a web search product, partly powered by Microsoft\nBing, a source told The Information.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be too surprising, considering:\n\n  * OpenAI has a web crawler, GPTBot.\n  * ChatGPT Plus users can also use Browse with Bing to search the web.\n  * Microsoft Bing uses OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, customized for search.\n\nWhy we care. OpenAI has created a popular product in ChatGPT and I\u2019ve seen\nmuch anecdotal evidence that some people use it similarly to a search engine.\nIf OpenAI actually does release a Search product, it will be worth watching to\nsee it becomes a source of any significant organic traffic or value for brands\nand businesses.\n\nCould OpenAI challenge Google Search? I\u2019m all for more search alternatives.\nBut could OpenAI develop a search engine to truly rival Google? I\u2019m extremely\nskeptical at this time.\n\nLook no further than Microsoft \u2013 a $3 trillion company \u2013 which has failed to\nmake little progress versus Google for two decades, even after all the AI\nSearch investments and features it has rolled out over the past year. See: One\nyear later: Little change to Microsoft Bing\u2019s search market share\n\nGoogle is Search \u2013 it is a habit for people, as pointed out recently in\ntestimony by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during the still unresolved Google\nantitrust trial.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen so many search engines launch with hype about it being the latest\nand greatest \u201cGoogle killer\u201d (Blekko, Cuil, Neeva, et al.) \u2013 then ultimately\nfail. The reality? Google Search is always the real killer.\n\nIn terms of understanding how far ChatGPT has to go: Google got an estimated\n84.2 billion visits while ChatGPT got an estimated 1.6 billion in December.\n\nThe report.
