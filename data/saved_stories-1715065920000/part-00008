VMware Cloud on AWS - here today, here tomorrow\n\n# Broadcom B-Connected Blog\n\n  * Subscribe\n\n## Hock Tan\n\n### President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nMay 06, 2024\n\n2 Minute Read\n\nCEO Insights\n\n# VMware Cloud on AWS - here today, here tomorrow\n\nCloud and Data Center\n\nCustomers around the world have seamlessly migrated their enterprise\napplications to VMware Cloud on AWS to combine the scale and agility benefits\nof public cloud with the security, resiliency, and performance benefits of\nprivate cloud. VMware first launched this offering with AWS almost seven years\nago and it continues to serve customers\u2019 needs today.\n\nUnfortunately, there have been false reports that VMware Cloud on AWS may be\ngoing away, which is causing unnecessary concern for our loyal customers who\nhave used the service for years. We are acting quickly to correct this\nmisinformation because, as Winston Churchill correctly said, \u201cA lie gets\nhalfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.\u201d\nI\u2019m pleased to report the service is alive, available, and continues to\nsupport our customers' strategic business initiatives just as it always has.\n\nSo, here\u2019s what\u2019s really going on. VMware Cloud on AWS is no longer directly\nsold by AWS or its channel partners. It\u2019s that simple. What this means is that\ncustomers who previously purchased VMware Cloud on AWS from AWS will now work\nwith Broadcom or an authorized Broadcom reseller to renew their subscriptions\nand expand their environments. Customers who have active one- or three-year\nsubscriptions with monthly payments that were purchased from AWS will continue\nto be invoiced by AWS until the end of their term.\n\nVMware Cloud on AWS has transformed the industry by providing a reliable\nsolution to move enterprise VMware workloads onto the public cloud without the\nexpensive, time-consuming and unpredictable refactoring and migrations that\ncome with native public cloud services. It also transformed the industry by\nshowcasing VMware\u2019s enterprise-grade SDDC software. Today we deliver the same\nsoftware in public cloud and on-prem as VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), helping\norganizations modernize their infrastructure with the best possible TCO, with\nthe flexibility and portability to move and run their workloads wherever they\nchoose - in their on prem private cloud, in hyperscale clouds, or in VMware\nCloud Service Provider clouds.\n\nSo, again, VMware Cloud on AWS continues to serve customers just as it always\nhas.\n\n### Topics\n\nvcfVMCVMware CloudAWSBroadcom\n\n### Related Posts\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n#### A changing market landscape requires constant evolution: our mission for\nVMware customers\n\nHock Tan\n\nInnovation\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n#### VCF go-to-market strategy: your top questions addressed\n\nBroadcom\n\nInnovation\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n#### VMware by Broadcom: the first 100 days\n\nHock Tan\n\nInnovation\n\nRecommended\n\nBroadcom\u2019s Transformation Journey with Google...Hock Tan A Combined Broadcom\nand VMware: Clouds...Broadcom Blogs\n\nBy clicking accept, you understand that we use cookies to improve your\nexperience on our website.
