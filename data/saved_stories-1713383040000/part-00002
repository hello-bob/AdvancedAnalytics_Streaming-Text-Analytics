Blackfeather turned,\nsmiling as widely as his beak would allow.\n\n\u201cHello, Professor Shortfur. Didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be present.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t miss your talk, could I? Though actually, today, I had a personal\ninterest in the subject. Your theories about the monkey cities are\nfascinating. Although I hope you know it\u2019ll be an uphill climb to publish\nthem. With fossil evidence of rats and ravens in these cities since antiquity,\nwe\u2019re biased to think we built them ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find my evidence convincing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly seems like bipedal monkeys did most of the work. But linking the\nmonkeys\u2019 extinction to our species\u2019 rapid cognitive evolution ... that\u2019s a\nbrave claim, and one directly relevant to my own research.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed? How come the renowned geologist is suddenly investigating brain\nevolution?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Have you read my paper about how closely the monkeys\u2019\nindustrial era aligns with rising global temperatures? No? The correlation is\nnearly perfect. Do you think it\u2019s possible that the Warm Age caused \u2014\u201d\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n\u201cOn such short time scales? Sorry, but that makes no sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese monkeys make no sense,\u201d Shortfur replied irritably. \u201cMaybe they had a\ntemperature-dependent engineer phenotype? I honestly don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not the\nevolutionary biologist here. Just saying \u2014 the fit\u2019s too good to be a\ncoincidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, correlation is not causation. Maybe ... maybe it\u2019s the other way round\n\u2014 the monkeys somehow changed the climate.\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other for two full seconds, then both burst out laughing.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be serious for a minute,\u201d said Shortfur. \u201cThis was a normal species,\nlike us, for millions of years. Then, within decades of the Warm Age\nbeginning, they suddenly all went crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy crazy you mean the overpopulation? The monkey-made cities I was talking\nabout?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but also literally crazy. They drove a lot of animals to extinction \u2014\nate them, I presume \u2014 while at the same time, they were keeping wolves and\ndinosaurs as pets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf by dinosaurs you mean chickens, we know they harvested them for amino\nacids.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean actual dinosaurs. Some of the biggest, most ferocious species.\u201d\n\nBlackfeather gaped. \u201cI thought they predate monkeys.\u201d\n\n\u201cPredate as in eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cPredate as in pre-exist. By millions of years, if you trust Beakk\u2019s isotopic\nanalyses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t. Radiometric dating is unreliable around that period. I received some\nsamples from ancient islands in the Pacific, with isotope ratios that Beakk\nwould confidently date as being from the future. Anyway, the fact remains that\nmost dinosaur fossils were found near monkey city centres. Indoors, in huge\nhalls. My point is, monkeys were up to some seriously weird stuff during the\nWarm Age.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you propose this was somehow caused by the changes in the atmosphere?\nI\u2019ll have to think about this ...\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, it gets even more interesting. Do you know Dr Whiskers from South Sewer\nUniversity?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeard of her. An astrophysicist, isn\u2019t she? What\u2019s she got to do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard, her team\u2019s lunar probe brought back some suspected\norganic matter last year. They isolated something that might be DNA and sent\nit to my department for sequencing. I saw the results this morning. Guess what\nit was.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way. You\u2019re making this up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear I\u2019m not. The DNA was too ancient to pinpoint the species, but the\nconditions preserved it perfectly, and it\u2019s a primate alright. On the Moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense. They haven\u2019t got any wings.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamned if I know how they got there, but it\u2019s them. No other primate species\nwas ever smart enough to get all the way up there. And then within a couple\ncenturies they were gone, which, according to your superb talk, sparked our\nown cognitive evolution and current societies. What do you make of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think they all sailed off into the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I think. What do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want my honest opinion?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem confident in the DNA evidence, so I\u2019ll accept your claim that they\nlanded a monkey on the Moon. That\u2019s an incredible discovery in itself, truly\nexciting. But this act seems to me like their desperate attempt at a last-\nminute escape, and they\u2019re unlikely to have got much farther. It doesn\u2019t\noutweigh the evidence \u2014 ample evidence \u2014 that they simply ran out of resources\nand died out fighting over leftovers. Maybe the survivors were outcompeted by\nmore intelligent species like rats, ravens and parrots. Maybe they were\nweakened by the pollution or hunted down by their dinosaurs. The bottom line\nis, I find it hard to accept that they found a magic solution in the nick of\ntime, then disappeared without a trace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I find hard to accept?\u201d said Shortfur vigorously. \u201cThat a\nspecies intelligent enough to build the Berlin Sewer and catapult itself to\nouter space would meet its end like bacteria in a neglected dish. I believe \u2014\nI want to believe \u2014 that some of them made it out, against all odds. That\nthey\u2019re still alive on some strange planet. Watching us, perhaps.\u201d\n\nBlackfeather\u2019s eyes glinted as he placed a friendly wing on the old rat\u2019s\nshoulder. \u201cI want to believe it too, Professor. But I can do nothing but hope.\nWith your permission, I\u2019ll be returning my attention to Earth, where it\nbelongs.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00898-9\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * The real time-travel paradox was the friends we made along the way by Rodrigo Culagovski\n\n  * The warfighter by Timothy Quinn\n\n  * Plutopalooza by Gretchen Tessmer\n\n  * The Correctives by Preston Grassmann\n\n  * Eyes on history by Yelena Crane\n\n  * Backdoor by Gendel Gento\n\n  * Welcome aboard the Silva family historic spaceside attraction tour by Carol Scheina\n\n  * Turing test \u2014 all my broken hearts by Gareth Owens\n\n  * Missense, nosense and nonsense by David Mathew\n\n  * Tyrannomorphs by Graham Robert Scott\n\n  * The Alcubierre key by Jessica Brook\n\n  * MANNA by S R Algernon\n\n  * Animal Ark by Greg Foyster\n\n  * Welcome to your post-apocalyptic bunker rental! by Wendy Nikel\n\n  * Nostalgia by Sean MacKendrick\n\n  * A girl travels to the end of the Universe by Ruth Joffre\n\n  * Curiosity shop by Robert Dawson\n\n  * Time crystal by Andrew Spielberg\n\n  * Nomad by Richard A Lovett\n\n  * Endlings by Giancarla Espinosa Aritao\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Arts\n  * Culture\n\n## Latest on:\n\nDad always mows on summer Saturday mornings\n\nFutures 17 APR 24\n\nThree possible muses\n\nFutures 10 APR 24\n\nThe real time-travel paradox was the friends we made along the way\n\nFutures 27 MAR 24\n\nDad always mows on summer Saturday mornings\n\nFutures 17 APR 24\n\nThree possible muses\n\nFutures 10 APR 24\n\nThe real time-travel paradox was the friends we made along the way\n\nFutures 27 MAR 24\n\nDad always mows on summer Saturday mornings\n\nFutures 17 APR 24\n\nThree possible muses\n\nFutures 10 APR 24\n\nThe real time-travel paradox was the friends we made along the way\n\nFutures 27 MAR 24\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * #### Postdoc in Computational Genomics \u2013 Machine Learning for Multi-Omics Profiling of Cancer Evolution\n\nComputational Postdoc - Artificial Intelligence in Oncology and Regulatory\nGenomics and Cancer Evolution at the DKFZ - limited to 2 years\n\nHeidelberg, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (DE)\n\nGerman Cancer Research Center in the Helmholtz Association (DKFZ)\n\n  * #### Computational Postdoc\n\nThe German Cancer Research Center is the largest biomedical research\ninstitution in Germany.\n\nHeidelberg, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (DE)\n\nGerman Cancer Research Center in the Helmholtz Association (DKFZ)\n\n  * #### PhD / PostDoc Medical bioinformatics (m/f/d)\n\nThe Institute of Medical Bioinformatics and Systems Medicine / University of\nFreiburg is looking for a PhD/PostDoc Medical bioinformatics (m/w/d)\n\nFreiburg im Breisgau, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (DE)\n\nUniversity of Freiburg\n\n  * #### Postdoctoral Research Associate position at University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate position at University of Oklahoma Health\nSciences Center The Kamiya Mehla lab at the newly established Departmen...\n\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center\n\n  * #### Computational Postdoctoral Fellow with a Strong Background in Bioinformatics\n\nHouston, Texas (US)\n\nThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center\n\nDownload PDF\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * The real time-travel paradox was the friends we made along the way by Rodrigo Culagovski\n\n  * The warfighter by Timothy Quinn\n\n  * Plutopalooza by Gretchen Tessmer\n\n  * The Correctives by Preston Grassmann\n\n  * Eyes on history by Yelena Crane\n\n  * Backdoor by Gendel Gento\n\n  * Welcome aboard the Silva family historic spaceside attraction tour by Carol Scheina\n\n  * Turing test \u2014 all my broken hearts by Gareth Owens\n\n  * Missense, nosense and nonsense by David Mathew\n\n  * Tyrannomorphs by Graham Robert Scott\n\n  * The Alcubierre key by Jessica Brook\n\n  * MANNA by S R Algernon\n\n  * Animal Ark by Greg Foyster\n\n  * Welcome to your post-apocalyptic bunker rental! by Wendy Nikel\n\n  * Nostalgia by Sean MacKendrick\n\n  * A girl travels to the end of the Universe by Ruth Joffre\n\n  * Curiosity shop by Robert Dawson\n\n  * Time crystal by Andrew Spielberg\n\n  * Nomad by Richard A Lovett\n\n  * Endlings by Giancarla Espinosa Aritao\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Arts\n  * Culture\n\n## Sign up to Nature Briefing\n\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your\ninbox every weekday.\n\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter \u2014 what matters in science, free to\nyour inbox daily.\n\nGet the most important science stories of the day, free in your inbox.
