But how do things scale as an application grows? How do you ensure\nthat your codebase remains manageable, your performance metrics stay on point,\nand your team continues to work cohesively as the project evolves?\n\nIn this book, you'll uncover strategies that industry professionals use to\nbuild scalable, performant, and maintainable React applications, all without\nbecoming overwhelmed by complexity.\n\n  * Manage complex React applications by understanding how robust data fetching and state management libraries help streamline development.\n  * Understand how design systems and component libraries enhance consistency and usability.\n  * Recognize the importance of internationalization, personalization, and A/B testing in improving user engagement and conversion rates.\n  * Discover how testing and TypeScript enhance code reliability and maintainability.\n  * And a lot more!\n\nTogether, we've spent well over two decades building within or consulting for\n\n## What's inside?\n\nEvery topic below is a chapter of its own!\n\n##### Managing Software Complexity\n\n  * Explaining Complexity\n  * Root causes of complexity\n  * A philosophy of software design\n\n##### Modularity\n\n  * Modules in JavaScript\n  * Lazy-loading\n  * Code-splitting\n\n##### Performance\n\n  * Understanding how browsers work\n  * Reducing the cost of JavaScript\n  * Rendering patterns\n\n##### Design Systems\n\n  * Coding style guides\n  * Design tokens\n  * Component libraries\n\n##### Data Fetching\n\n  * Browser APIs and simple HTTP clients\n  * Advanced data-fetching libraries\n  * Tips for efficient data-fetching\n\n##### State Management\n\n  * Managing data between components\n  * Simple state management\n  * Dedicated state management libraries\n\n##### Internationalization\n\n  * Third-party localization libraries\n  * Format dates, times, and numbers\n  * Right-to-left (RTL) languages\n\n##### Organizing code\n\n  * Folder and file structure\n  * Naming conventions\n  * Barrel exports\n\n##### Personalization & A/B testing\n\n  * Personalization\n  * A/B Testing\n  * Feature flags\n\n##### Scalable web architecture\n\n  * Scalable applications\n  * Kubernetes & Docker\n  * Vercel & Netlify\n\n##### Testing\n\n  * Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests\n  * Snapshot testing\n  * How should we test our apps?\n\n##### Tooling\n\n  * Version control & CI\n  * Bundlers\n  * Logging & performance monitoring\n\n##### Technical migrations\n\n  * Different migration strategies\n  * Codemods\n  * The role of generative AI\n\n##### TypeScript\n\n  * React & TypeScript\n  * Autogenerating types from an API\n  * Migrating a React app to TypeScript\n\nSee the full table of contents\n\n## Some other things!\n\nDescriptive content, continous updates, and soundbites from industry\nprofessionals.\n\n### Descriptive, not prescriptive\n\nWhen explaining content, we follow a descriptive approach, not prescriptive.\nIn other words, we don\u2019t tell you what specific tools or libraries you have to\nuse to be successful. Rather, we focus on explaining a concept and employ\ncertain libraries or tools to illustrate that concept.\n\n### React-focused with universal concepts\n\nWhile the book is React-focused, it teaches universal concepts that transcend\nall web development frameworks. It's designed to enhance your understanding of\nbuilding web applications that are scalable, maintainable, and adaptable,\nregardless of the specific technology stack.\n\n### Continous, frequent updates\n\nPurchasing the e-book gives you access to all new content, edits, and\nimprovements forever. In fact, we're currently working on adding three new\nchapters soon \u2014 Routing, User-centric API design, and React in 2024. Check out\nthe Changelog to follow along on all the updates we'll make.\n\n### Soundbites from industry professionals\n\nIn the book, we share soundbites and thoughts from industry professionals.\nThese soundbites are shared from start-up owners and software engineers who\nwork at Doordash, Netflix, Spotify, and more.\n\n## Industry nuggets\n\nNuggets of wisdom from industry professionals\n\n### Jem Young\n\n### Maxi Ferreira\n\n### Emma Bostian\n\n### Zeno Rocha\n\n### Francine Navarro\n\n### Jeffrey Peng\n\n### And others!\n\n#### In my years at Netflix, I've learned a lot about testing. It's not just\nabout the code, it's about the culture as well.\n\nBesides the cultural aspect is the need to have a cohesive tool set. When I\nfirst joined [my team at Netflix], we had unit tests that were all over the\nplace. We had Jest, we had Mocha, I think we had some Enzyme tests too. Now,\nwe've kind of unified on a standard set of way of writing tests\n\nJem Young\n\nEngineering Manager @ Netflix & Co-host of Front End Happy Hour.\n\n## Who we are\n\nHeyo!
