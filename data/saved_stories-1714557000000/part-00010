Magic, rituals or religion - we perhaps may never know.\n\n\"What we do know is the Norton Disney dodecahedron was found on the top of a\nhill in a former large pit of some kind. It seems it was deliberately placed\nthere.\"\n\nThe mysterious objects date back as far as the 1st Century. Some experts\nbelieve they were possibly linked to Roman rituals or religion, but there are\nno references to them in any Roman texts.\n\nThe volunteers plan to return to the area where the dodecahedron was found in\nthe hope of unearthing more clues.\n\nThe Norton Disney dodecahedron, which featured in a recent episode of the BBC\nprogramme Digging for Britain, will be on display at Lincoln Museum as part of\nthe city's Festival of History from Saturday.\n\nRichard Croft/Geograph\n\nVisitors to the festival will also be able to learn more about Lincoln's Roman\npast\n\nAlongside the dodecahedron display, visitors can learn more about Lincoln's\nRoman past, and explore other finds unearthed across the city and county.\n\nAndrea Martin, exhibitions and interpretations manager at the museum, said\nhaving the dodecahedron on show was \"a real coup\" for local history fans and\nvisitors to the city.\n\nShe said the festival was also a chance for residents and visitors alike \"to\ndiscover more about Lincoln's story\".\n\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter),\nand Instagram.
