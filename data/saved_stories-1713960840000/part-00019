The best browser to use for background removal\nis Chrome. It has default caching capability, which means it doesn't have to\ndownload AI models again and again.\n\nHow can I remove backgrounds from multiple images?\n\nAfter you have chosen multiple images, a 'Start Removing Background' button\nwill appear. Simply click on it.\n\nIs signing up required to remove backgrounds from images?\n\nNo sign-up is required at all. Remove backgrounds from your images online\ninstantly.

Unlike other service providers that charge for this,\nCharmShotAI provides it for free.\n\nWhat are the Lite and Pro models used for?\n\nThe Pro AI Model provides superior background removal compared to the Lite\nModel. Moreover, the download size of the Pro model is twice that of the Lite\nModel.\n\nHow does this background removal tool respect my privacy?\n\nYour images stay on your machine; they don't go to any server for background\nremoval. The process occurs solely within your browser.\n\nWhy did I develop background removal in 2024?\n\nAll other background removal tools available require payment; they charge\ncredits for each image's background removal. There are no free services with a\nsimple UI for removing backgrounds. That's why I created this tool for you\nall, completely free of charge.\n\nHow to get help?\n\nFeel free to send me a DM on Twitter at @sealcodes.\n\nWhere is the application of image background removal?\n\nE-commerce: Background removal helps to enhance product images by removing\ndistracting backgrounds, making them more appealing to potential customers.\n\nMarketing: Background removal is used in marketing materials to highlight\nproducts or create visually striking advertisements.\n\nSocial Media: Background removal can be used to create engaging content for\nsocial media platforms, such as profile pictures or posts.\n\nPhotography: Photographers use background removal to edit images and create\nartistic effects or to isolate subjects for compositing.\n\nGraphic Design: Designers use background removal to create clean and\nprofessional-looking compositions for websites, advertisements, and print\nmaterials.\n\nCharmShotAI\n\nCharmShotAI Editor\n\nBlog\n\nPricing\n\nTestimonials\n\nPress Kit\n\nRoadmap\n\nChangelog\n\nAffiliate\n\nSupport\n\nManage/Forgot License\n\nContact Us\n\nHelp\n\nTutorial\n\nFAQs\n\nFeedback\n\nFree Tools\n\nBulk Image Background Removal\n\nLegal\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nRefund Policy\n\n\u00a9 2024 Charm Shot AI\n\n", "frontpage": false}
