Specifically, in the current theory-\nbuilding review we aim to: (a) more clearly define and describe the Death\nSpiral Effect; (b) model the downward spiral of societal decline as well as an\nupward spiral; (c) describe how and why individuals, groups and even society\nat large might be caught up in a Death Spiral; and (d) offer a positive way\nforward in terms of evidence-based solutions to escape the Death Spiral\nEffect. Management theory hints on the occurrence of this phenomenon and\noffers turn-around leadership as solution. On a societal level strengthening\nof democracy may be important. Prior research indicates that historically, two\nkey factors trigger this type of societal decline: rising inequalities\ncreating an upper layer of elites and a lower layer of masses; and dwindling\n(access to) resources. Historical key markers of societal decline are a steep\nincrease in inequalities, government overreach, over-integration\n(interdependencies in networks) and a rapidly decreasing trust in institutions\nand resulting collapse of legitimacy. Important issues that we aim to shed\nlight on are the behavioral underpinnings of decline, as well as the question\nif and how societal decline can be reversed. We explore the extension of these\ntheories from the company/organization level to the society level, and make\nuse of insights from both micro-, meso-, and macro-level theories (e.g.,\nComplex Adaptive Systems and collapsology, the study of the risks of collapse\nof industrial civilization) to explain this process of societal demise. Our\nreview furthermore draws on theories such as Social Safety Theory,\nConservation of Resources Theory, and management theories that describe the\ndecline and fall of groups, companies and societies, as well as offer ways to\nreverse this trend.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAnts rely on each other for survival and often hunt for prey together. They\nuse pheromones to locate each other and they follow the ones in front of them.\nThis usually works quite well, although sometimes the ants get locked in what\nis called an \u201cant mill\u201d or \u201cDeath Spiral.\u201d This can happen when a subset of\nants gets separated from the main foraging group and begin following each\nother. They start forming a continuously rotating circle, and the ants caught\nup in this Death Spiral often die from exhaustion. It has even been observed\nthat dead ants are being pushed out of the circle, while the ants maintain\ntheir rounds. This \u201cant mill\u201d or \u201ccircular milling paradox\u201d seems to be the\nevolutionary price that army ants pay for an otherwise successful strategy of\ncollective foraging (cf. Delsuc, 2003). The pathological, dysfunctional\nbehavior is the other side of the coin of otherwise functional behavior.\nRosabeth Moss Kanter, who spent years of studying declining organizations,\nconcluded that a process similar to a Death Spiral may be happening to failing\ncompanies (Kanter, 2003). After years of success, these companies have trouble\nmanaging processes when the tide turns and problems occur. Instead of looking\nfor solutions with an open mind, companies often get caught up in a Death\nSpiral, making decisions that seem rational, such as downsizing and\ncentralized decision making (cf. Charan et al., 2002; Lamberg et al., 2017).\nOften these decisions worsen the situation instead of making it better, and\nself-destructive habits include denial, complacency and cost-inefficiency\n(Sheth, 2007). Sheth (2007) argues that denial of the new reality and internal\nturf wars, i.e., territorial impulse, are two dangerous self-destructive\nhabits that can further send a company into decline. Companies are reluctant\nto admit they are in trouble and instead blame circumstances outside their\ncontrol (Lorange and Nelson, 1985; Charan et al., 2002). Management research\nhas also shown that long before the crisis within a company becomes apparent,\nthe signs are there, but often go unnoticed or are ignored (Lorange and\nNelson, 1985; Fitzgerald, 2005). Having to address these problems down the\nline, often leads to taking drastic steps and overreaction that may further\nfuel decline (Lorange and Nelson, 1985; Hafsi and Baba, 2022).\n\nUsing the metaphor of a corporate heart attack, Fitzgerald discerns a hidden,\nsubtle and overt phase of decline (Fitzgerald, 2005). In the hidden phase,\ndenial or willful blindness often prohibits management from taking (the right)\nactions. Against their better judgment, they hope if they ignore it, the\nmarket will not notice. In that phase, on average a third of a company\u2019s\ncompetitive value is lost. If a new market challenge presents itself, the\ncompany is often unable to face the challenge. In the subtle phase, the\ndecline becomes more obvious for those who are observant and know where and\nhow to look and how to interpret what they see. By the end of this phase,\noften a full two-thirds of the company\u2019s competitive value is lost.\nUnfortunately, many companies only start to admit and address the problem in\nthe overt phase. By that time, the problems are so big and ingrained, that\naddressing them has become extremely difficult. While many managers do watch\nthe company\u2019s financials, they often fail to address other metrics such as\nmarket-share trends, customer turnover and staff satisfaction. Often these\ndrivers are the earliest predictors of corporate performance. Important\nblockers of performance are distrust, bureaucracy and low performance\nexpectations, while drivers are decisiveness, accountability and\nacknowledgement of work. It is key to identify and quantify early warning\nsignals, e.g., an excess of staff, especially managers, a decrease in lower-\nlevel workers, tolerance of incompetence, and lack of clear goals (Lorange and\nNelson, 1985). Reversing organizational decline starts with the realization\nand recognition that the organization is in decline. These danger signals\nshould then be aligned with a concrete plan to change. A dialog between top-\ndown and bottom-up is needed (Lorange and Nelson, 1985). If the company is\nable to take those steps, follow-up monitoring is needed to make sure the\nchanges that are proposed and made are effective (Lorange and Nelson, 1985).\nWhile in the early phases underreaction may be the problem, in later phases,\nthe danger comes from overreaction (cf. Lai and Sudarsanam, 1997; Hafsi and\nBaba, 2022).\n\nWe believe that similar processes may happen at the societal level. Recent\nexamples of societal systemic shocks are 9/11, the 2008 global financial\ncrisis and the COVID-19 crisis (Centeno et al., 2022). On a societal level,\nresearchers studying policy success and failure have started to investigate\nthe role of policy under- and over-reactions (Maor, 2012, 2020). Policy\noverreactions are \u201cpolicies that impose objective and/or perceived social\ncosts without producing offsetting objective and/or perceived benefits.\u201d\n(Maor, 2012; p. 235). For instance, preemptive overreaction is a form of\npolicy that will often rely on persuasion by presenting \u201cfacts\u201d in a certain\nway, manufacturing a perceived threat, and using messages to swing the public\nmood (Maor, 2012). An example is the cull of all pigs in Egypt during the\nswine flu crisis in 2009, even though zero cases had been reported (Maor,\n2012). An important explanation is that in such cases groupthink may play a\nrole. Groupthink, the forced conformity to group values and ethics, has\nsymptoms such as collective rationalization, belief in inherent morality,\nstereotyped views of outgroups, pressure on dissenters, and self-appointed\nmind guards (Janis, 1972, 1982a,b; Janis et al., 1978). Preemptive\noverreaction shows that one is taking forceful and decisive action against a\nperceived threat, that may never materialize, and motives could be political\nand/or monetary gain (Maor, 2012).\n\nWhile the period before the COVID-19 crisis may have been characterized by\nrelative policy underreaction to complex social problems, also referred to as\n\u201cwicked problems,\u201d such as hunger and poverty (Head, 2018; Head B.W. 2022),\nthe current times may be characterized by overreaction to certain problems.\nThe COVID-19 crisis seemed to be characterized by groupthink and escalation of\ncommitment to one course of action, at the expense of other possible solutions\n(Joffe, 2021; Schippers and Rus, 2021). Initial low-quality decision-making\nwas followed by decisions that made things worse (Joffe, 2021; Schippers and\nRus, 2021). The sheer scale and severe disruption caused by these policies has\nincreased inequalities (Schippers, 2020; Schippers et al., 2022), an important\nmarker of societal decline (Motesharrei et al., 2014).\n\nA meta-theory explaining such disruptive events is Complex Adaptive Systems\nTheory, a theory that suggests that developments in systems of many\nconstituents are often non-linear and systems, such as societies, show\nunexpected and self-organizing behavior (Lansing, 2003; Holovatch et al.,\n2017). Moreover, \u201cmechanisms like tipping points, feedback loops, contagions,\ncascades, synchronous failures, and cycles that can be responsible for\nsystemic collapse are fundamental characteristics of any complex adaptive\nsystem, and can therefore serve as a useful common denominator from which to\nexamine collapses\u201d (Centeno et al., 2022; p. 71). In today\u2019s society, our\ncontinued survival increasingly depends on tightly coupled complex and fragile\nsystems (e.g., supply chains), over which no one has responsibility (Centeno\net al., 2022). The potential for contemporary collapse makes it more\ncompelling than ever to learn from past collapse for insight (Centeno et al.,\n2022) and to study global patterns of behavior. The normative basis for our\npaper relates to \u2018the greater good\u2019: What is deemed good for the thriving of\nhumanity is seen as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018functional\u2019 while what is seen as \u2018bad\u2019 or\n\u2018dysfunctional\u2019 is behavior or decisions that harm the thriving of humanity.\n\n## 2 Downward spiral\n\nIn the current narrative and theory-building review we coin the term Death\nSpiral Effect to describe this type of overreaction and the resulting\ncascading effects in policies affecting the general public. We review the\ncurrent literature and extend complex adaptive systems theory to construct our\ntheoretical model of collapse and reversal of societal decline. We view the\nDeath Spiral Effect as a specific form of complex (mal)adaptive behavior that\naccelerates decline and makes it hard to reverse decline. Making use of the\nant mill metaphor, we theorize that a Death Spiral Effect emerges where a\nsociety gets caught up in a dysfunctional behavioral mode. Making use of this\nmetaphor, we aim to aid theory building around this construct (Shepherd and\nSuddaby, 2016). We describe the elements of this vicious downward cycle, such\nas rising inequalities, dysfunctional behavior of both elite and masses, and\nrise of authoritarianism. We examine how the behavioral underpinnings of the\nresulting environment can lead to escalation through war, famine, and\npandemics. While there is a rich literature on early warning signs and markers\nof societal decline, the underlying mechanisms have received much less\nattention and explanations often miss the depth that the psychological,\nsociological and management theories may offer. We draw on theories such as\ncollapsology (the transdisciplinary study of industrial civilization risk of\ncollapse), Complex Adaptive Systems Theory, Social Safety Theory (that focuses\non friendly social bonds development and maintenance), Conservation of\nResources Theory (that focuses on obtaining and maintaining resources), and\ngeneral management theories that describe the decline of groups. We also use\nSocial Dominance Theory to explain how and why the resulting inequalities are\nhard to reverse (Pratto, 1999; Pratto et al., 2006). Our work is also related\nto X-risk studies, a field of study that looks at existential risks for\nhumanity (Torres, 2018; Moynihan, 2020): We recognize the importance of\ncascading risks, and hint at how catastrophic (X)-risks could potentially\ncombine to jeopardize human survival (Torres, 2018; Baum et al., 2019;\nMoynihan, 2020; Undheim and Zimmer, 2023). We use a \u2018Big Picture\u2019 approach to\nthese problems (Campbell et al., 2023). We then depict a possible upward\nspiral, dissecting what elements are needed to reverse the Death Spiral and\nbuild a society where people can thrive and prosper. In doing so, we\ncontribute to theory building around the psychological and sociological\ndrivers of societal decline (Swedberg, 2016). Our aim is to contribute to\nknowledge about societal decline and flourishing in order to enhance mankind\u2019s\nchances of flourishing.\n\n### 2.1 Crisis and crisis handling\n\nSeveral authors have noted that societal decline has similar phases to\norganizational decline in companies, including early warning signs (Tainter,\n1989; Downey et al., 2016; Scheffer, 2016; Jones, 2021; Demarest and Victor,\n2022). Compared to decline in organizations, however, the scale at which this\nhappens is bigger, the social consequences are more complex, and the decline\nmay often be a more long-term process. The average lifespan of a company in\nthe Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 index in 2020 was 21.4 years (Clark et al., 2021)\nwhile some historical empires have lasted many decades or centuries\n(Taagepera, 1979). Another difference between organizations and society is\nthat the outcome of decline can often not be buffered by society, such as\nwould be the case in company decline. Also the hard outcomes (which may\ninclude war, famine and widespread disease) can be extremely hard to reverse\n(Downey et al., 2016). These three, war, famine and pandemics, we call the\n\u201cTriangle of Death,\u201d an expression coined by former Green Beret and combat\ncorrespondent Michael Yon (Yon and Peterson, 2022). However, Demarest and\nVictor (2022), p. 788 note that: \u201cEven today the greatest challenge to\nknowledge coming from collapse studies\u2013relevant not just for policy-makers and\nmanagers, but for the citizens of the entire society\u2013is that no one really\ndeeply believes that total collapse is possible\u201d.\n\nThe process of societal decline is complex and may include social-ecological\ntraps, or a mismatch between the responses of people and the social and\necological conditions they face, e.g., depletion of natural resources\n(Boonstra and De Boer, 2013; Boonstra et al., 2016). For the current review,\nwe feel that the handling of the COVID-19 crisis may have been an example of\noverreaction making use of non-pharmaceutical interventions that accelerated\nexisting societal problems, such as inequalities (Schippers, 2020; Schippers\net al., 2022). Most countries opted for very similar solutions, with forced\nlockdowns and aggressive restrictions. Countries that chose a different course\nof action were highly criticized (Tegnell, 2021). Many countries eventually\nfaced excess mortality rates that were highly unequal across groups,\nexacerbating preexisting inequalities (Alsan et al., 2021; Schippers et al.,\n2022). Over-reaction was fueled by (unreliable) metrics (Schippers and Rus,\n2021; Ioannidis et al., 2022) and groupthink, resulting in irrational or\ndysfunctional decision making (Joffe, 2021; Hafsi and Baba, 2022).\nFurthermore, emotions during crises tend to run high, escalating the risk of\nharmful overreaction both by policy makers and the general public (Sunstein\nand Zeckhauser, 2010). Governments may suffer from an action bias, a tendency\nto take action whether it is needed or not, including excessive actions (Patt\nand Zeckhauser, 2000) despite information that the policies may do more harm\nthan good (for reviews see Joffe and Redman, 2021, Schippers and Rus, 2021;\nSchippers et al., 2022). Unnecessary crisis response as a form of policy\noverreaction may sometimes occur as a way to shape voters perceptions of a\ndecisive and active government (Maor, 2020). Excessive action and exercise of\ncontrol over societal structures, e.g., public health, may enhance\ncentralization of power and decision-making, and authoritarianism (Berberoglu,\n2020; Desmet, 2022; Schippers et al., 2022; Simandan et al., 2023). When\ngovernments make use of mass media to spread negative information, a self-\nreinforcing cycle of nocebo effects, \u201cmass hysteria\u201d and policy errors can\nensue (Bagus et al., 2021). This effect is exacerbated when the information\ncomes from authoritative sources, the media are politicized, social networks\nmake the information omnipresent (Bagus et al., 2021), and dissenting voices\nare silenced (Schippers et al., 2022; Shir-Raz et al., 2022). This may lead to\na vicious cycle of ineffective dealing with crises, low-quality decision-\nmaking and dysfunctional behavior, intensifying the current crises and leading\nto new ones, and eventually societal decline and even collapse.\n\nAccording to Holden (2005), p. 651, a complex adaptive system is \u201ca collection\nof individual agents with freedom to act in ways that are not always totally\npredictable and whose actions are interconnected. Examples include a colony of\ntermites, the financial market, and a surgical team\u201d. An important element is\nemergence, the idea that complex global patterns can emerge from local\ninteractions (Lansing, 2003). In the current paper, following authors such as\nBuckley (1998) and Lansing (2003), we view society as a complex adaptive\nsystem, with nested systems such as organizations and governments as part of\nthe larger system. We suggest that the adaptive system is entering an unstable\ntime, in the form of a series of crises. We extend Complex Systems Theory, by\nadding the Death Spiral as an element, where the system becomes so unstable,\nthat actors within the network start to hold on to repetitive maladaptive\n(decision-making) behavior (Schwarzer, 2022); making the same decision over\nand over again, leading to unwanted results such as war, famine and pandemics\n(Triangle of Death) and ultimately the demise of society. In doing so, we\nexplain the underlying mechanisms of societal decline and outline\npossibilities for reversal.\n\nBelow we will first define and describe the process of a Death Spiral, and the\nsimilarities and differences between a Death Spiral and other concepts such as\ngroup think and mass formation. We will do this in the context of the more\nmeta-theory of complex adaptive systems. Second, we will describe the elements\nof a societal downward (death) spiral, e.g., low-quality decision-making, rise\nof authoritarianism, and dysfunctional behavior of both the elite and masses\n(see Figures 1, 2). We will do so in the context of historical as well as\ncurrent examples. Third, we describe the possibilities for an upward spiral,\ne.g., presence of a high-quality turn-around leadership, restoration of trust,\nand development of turnaround strategy.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1. Death Spiral Effect: downward spiral of societies and/or groups in\ndecline.\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2. Death Spiral model of societies in decline.\n\n### 2.2 Death Spiral considerations\n\nWhen people and groups encounter difficulties or trauma (or sometimes for no\napparent reason), they can start to make decisions that do not ensure\nsurvival, but seem self-destructive at best (cf. Balcombe and De Leo, 2022).\nThey may make decisions to cope with the situations, but these can be\ncharacterized as mal-adaptive, non-adaptive, or semi-adaptive (Marien, 2009).\nAttempts to escape a downward spiral sometimes make it worse, by using\ncounterproductive coping mechanisms (e.g., Freyhofer et al., 2021). The\ndysfunctional behavior continues if the spiral is not broken, and decline may\nfollow from increasingly fragmented political institutions (cf. Kreml, 1994).\nIn terms of Complex Adaptive Systems Theory, the system is then entering an\nunstable time, in this case a crisis (Centeno et al., 2022). When the system\ngets a blow, for instance from financial decline, depletion of resources, or\nother turns of fortune (Motesharrei et al., 2014), groups or societies may\nfeel compelled to take action without considering carefully whether their\ndecision-making process is valid (cf. Schippers et al., 2014). The threat-\nrigidity effect predicts a restriction in information processing and\nconstriction of control under conditions of threat (Staw et al., 1981). The\nwhole system becomes unstable and dysfunctional behavior sets in (Mohrman and\nMohrman, 1983). The environment becomes generally stressful and threatening,\neliciting more and more self-protective and rigid behaviors, that further\nthreatens stability and group survival (Staw et al., 1981).\n\nFinally, individuals and groups may tend to go around their lives in \u201ccircles\u201d\nrepeating the same mistakes, seemingly trapped in one behavioral mode. In\norganizations, similar Death Spiral pathologies can set in when changes in the\nenvironment do not invoke adaptation, but secrecy, blame, avoidance as well as\npassivity and learned helplessness (Kanter, 2003). In the general management\nliterature, dysfunctional behavior is often described as a form of antisocial\nbehavior, intended to bring harm (e.g., Giacalone and Greenberg, 1997; Van\nFleet and Griffin, 2006). In the current paper, dysfunctional behavior is seen\nas counterproductive or ineffective behavior, that may have outlived its\nusefulness, and does not have the intended effect and may even have\n(unintended) harmful outcomes (Robinson, 2008). In companies, dysfunctional or\ncounterproductive work behavior undermines efficiency and can range from\nsocial loafing (putting less effort when working as part of a group than when\nworking alone), conflict and withdrawal to theft, fraud, bullying and even\nmurder (Robinson, 2008). The more \u201ccivilized\u201d forms of dysfunctional behavior,\nsuch as social loafing and withdrawal, are most prevalent (Robinson, 2008),\nand these can become much more common in organizations and societies that are\nin a downward spiral, and undermine individual autonomy. People feeling\npowerless in organizations exercising excess power are often triggered to\nperform counterproductive work behaviors (Lawrence and Robinson, 2007). During\nthe COVID-19 crisis, withdrawal effects became more widespread and the crisis\nsparked changes in attitudes toward work as well as changing work behaviors\ninside organizations (Newman et al., 2022). For many workers, stress levels\nincreased, and work performance declined (e.g., Vaziri et al., 2020; Kumar et\nal., 2021).\n\nAt the organizational level, decline often sparks dislike and distrust among\nmanagers, who then start to avoid one another, hide information and deflect\nblame (Kanter, 2003). People within the organization do not act in concert\nanymore and the dwindling success rate of their actions make them feel\nhelpless (Kanter, 2003). In such situations, managers often resort to\nmicromanagement: trying to control the actions of workers at a frustrating\nlevel of detail to steer them back to productivity. The pushback from workers\nwill be to misbehave as a form of organizational resistance (Lawrence and\nRobinson, 2007), self-reinforcing cycles of micromanagement and\ncounterproductive work behaviors (cf. Jensen and Raver, 2012; Cannon, 2022). A\ntoxic work or societal culture may emerge and persist for some time, with fear\nas an overriding principle (Cannon, 2022). In society at large, the dangers of\na \u201ctoxic discourse\u201d around pending disasters (Buell, 1998; Horfrichter, 2000)\nmay have paved the way for drastic measures taken to avoid such disasters\n(Schippers, 2020). However, some measures taken to prevent these hypothetical\nor expected future disasters have caused damage, leading to a steep increase\nin poverty and inequalities (Schippers et al., 2022). Besides many layoffs,\nmany people reflected on their working life and subsequently decided to quit\ntheir job. The resulting \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d seemed to be a world-wide\nphenomenon (Jiskrova, 2022; Sull et al., 2022; Del Rio Chanona et al., 2023).\nIn the United States, monthly resignation rates were higher than in the\nprevious 20 years (Statistics, 2021; Jiskrova, 2022). Note that many workers\nchanged jobs and did not withdraw from the work force altogether (\u201cGreat\nReshuffle\u201d; Sull et al., 2022). However, at the beginning of 2021, more than\n40% of workers were thinking of quitting, and a toxic work culture was\nmentioned as an important reason (Sull et al., 2022). At the same time decline\nin organizations was often triggered by the COVID-19 crisis and non-\npharmaceutical interventions implemented to reduce viral spread, such as\nclosing of restaurants and \u201cnon -essential\u201d shops (Brodeur et al., 2021). As\nearly as April 2020 in the United States, the number of active business owners\ndecreased by 22% within just 3 months (Fairlie, 2020; Brodeur et al., 2021).\nTaken together with other effects such as rising inequalities, increase in\nimmigration, changed labor market, damaged mental health and well-being, this\nis arguably a big shock to societal cohesion (Silveira et al., 2022),\nincreasing state fragility and decreasing state legitimacy (Seyoum, 2020).\n\nIn both society at large, as well as in many companies, toxic cultures can\nensue during crises (cf. Meidav, 2021). In such cultures, behavior that\nmanagement or governments would like to see is rewarded, while many\n(mal)practices go unchecked, leaving room for fraud and corruption (cf. Kerr,\n1975; Meidav, 2021; Breevaart et al., 2022). Indicative of such a toxic\nculture are: (lowered) level of helpfulness of people, (in)formality and\n(blind) enforcement of rules, underground avoidance of rules, feeling that\nthings could be better but also feeling unable to change them, moaning \u201caround\nthe water cooler,\u201d loss of morale, lack of initiative, top-down decision\nmaking, \u201cdouble speak,\u201d and lack of cohesion (Cannon, 2022). People are\ngenerally willing to do the right thing but find many roadblocks when they try\n(Myers, 2008). Moreover, historical research has shown that people fall back\non \u201coverlearned\u201d comfort behavior, and biases become entrained again. For\ninstance, a fallback on preference for ingroups ensures that during crises\ndiversity efforts in companies are reduced and inequalities rise (Meidav,\n2021). During organizational change, employee misconduct increases (Ethics and\nCompliance Initiative, 2020; Meidav, 2021) including even antisocial behavior\n(Belschak et al., 2018).\n\n### 2.3 Death Spiral Effect: definition and key characteristics\n\nBased on the above considerations, here we formally define the Death Spiral\nEffect as: A vicious cycle of self-reinforcing dysfunctional behavior,\ncharacterized by continuous flawed decision making, myopic single-minded focus\non one (set of) solution(s), resource loss, denial, distrust, micromanagement,\ndogmatic thinking and learned helplessness. The Death Spiral is often\ninitiated by an external or internal event (e.g., crisis) causing a trauma or\nemotional response. In the case of man-made crises, a positive feedback loop\nof perverse incentives may cause a stable society to spiral into disorder\n(Centeno et al., 2022). The Death Spiral Effect sets in when a cascade of\nevents is difficult to stop once set in motion (cf. Centeno et al., 2022). On\na societal level this spiral results in increasing gap between elite and\nmasses, rising authoritarianism and massive resource loss. For instance, it\nhas been noted that ancient civilizations on the brink of collapse used scarce\nresource for megalomaniac projects, such as huge temples, in a desperate\nattempt to legitimize declining institutions, but ultimately staying on the\ncourse toward disintegration (Demarest and Victor, 2022).\n\nA Death Spiral is characterized by: (1) initial denial of the problem; (2)\ncontinuously and repeated flawed decision-making, often trying to fix the\nproblem with the same ineffective solution over and over again; (3) increasing\nsecrecy and denial, blame and scorn, avoidance and turf-protection, passivity\nand helplessness; (4) worsening of the situation, and a continuous (series of)\ncrises following, further triggering a \u201csurvival mode\u201d and tunnel vision, and\n(5) the felt or observed inability to escape or snap out of the ineffective\ncycle of decision-making. Other characteristics that emerge when the Death\nSpiral becomes apparent are: (1) a negative and distrustful atmosphere; (2)\nmicromanagement: individuals, management or government trying to increase the\nnumber of (strict) rules and a focus on the adherence to those rules at the\nexpense of effective problem-solving; and (3) censorship of opinions and\nknowledge outside the official narrative. These elements may be present to\nvariable degrees concurrently and may reinforce each other. As the downward\ncycle continues, and resources loss escalates, the desperation principle may\nset in: a defensive mode in which people or groups aggressively and often\nirrationally try to hold on to the little resources that are left (Hobfoll et\nal., 2018), instead of thinking on how to snap out of the situation\naltogether.\n\nIn Figure 2, we discern four phases of societal development and demise: In\nphase I society is developing and growing. During this phase groups are\nworking together without large problems. Social intuitions are founded and\nstrengthened. In phase II, a functional society is relatively stable although,\nsocial inequalities are already increasing in this phase. In phase III, a\ndysfunctional society, the seeds of discontent sown during phase II have now\nmatured: social inequalities are becoming more extreme, resulting in an\nincreasing number of societal problems and an uptake in societal\ndysfunctionalities. Governments often react via centralization of power, and a\nrise in authoritarianism instead of involving the general public in solving\nsocietal problems. In phase IV, we see a declining or collapsing society. If\nthe problems of decline, that started in Phase II and III, are not addressed\nthen society will decline and may eventually collapse. Collapse is\ncharacterized by the Triangle of Death: war, famine and pandemics\n(Karabushenko et al., 2021; cf. Kuecker, 2007; Yon and Peterson, 2022; see\nalso Figure 1).\n\n### 2.4 Differences from other concepts\n\nWhile we define the Death Spiral Effect as a specific form of collapse within\nan adaptive complex system, the concept of a Death Spiral is an umbrella\nconcept that has some overlap with but also distinct features from some other\nconcepts, such as group think, mass formation, Abilene paradox, and group\npolarization. In Table 1 we list those concepts and give an overview of\nsimilarities and differences versus the Death Spiral Effect. All those\nconcepts deal with forms of dysfunctional decision-making. However, the main\ndifference is a combination of the repetitiveness of the dysfunctional\ndecision-making process, and the stubborn and prolonged effect of the\nsubsequent series of decision-making (See Table 1).\n\nTable 1\n\nTable 1. Death Spiral Effect compared to other related concepts.\n\nThe Death Spiral Effect differs from groupthink, group polarization and the\nAbilene paradox in that groupthink, group polarization and the Abilene paradox\nare often related to a more finite series of decisions around one topic or\noutcome (e.g., the invasion of the Pig Bay) and focuses more on group harmony\nand agreement (Janis, 1972, 1982a,b; Harvey, 1974). Thus, while groupthink,\ngroup polarization and the Abilene paradox may often be part of a Death\nSpiral, a Death Spiral is more long-lasting, pervading, and pathological\ndysfunctional behavior and affects many aspects of a person\u2019s life, a team, a\ncompany or even the whole society. At a certain moment, similar to groupthink,\nself-appointed mind guards appear, but the scale is much bigger. The Death\nSpiral Effect takes groupthink a step further, it can lead to the collapse of\na full society.\n\nMass formation has also been offered as an explanation for what is happening\nin society (Desmet, 2022; Schippers et al., 2022). This theory sees the people\nin society as a swarm, that will move in one direction, following a single\nnarrative. The mass formation concept does not have a going around in circles\u2019\nelement, that the Death Spiral has. The swarm-like element in this theory\nstates that people do attend to others\u2019 behavior and copy that behavior (Bak-\nColeman et al., 2021; Desmet, 2022). Swarm-dynamics are also studied within\ncomplex adaptive systems research (Huepe et al., 2011). While mass formation\ncan be part of the Death Spiral Effect, and irrational group behavior is an\nelement of this effect, the Death Spiral gives a broader explanation of what\nhappens if (groups of) people get stuck in this cycle.\n\nThe dysfunctional behavior shown in a Death Spiral also includes\nmicromanagement, a leadership style that stifles creativity and innovation\n(Allcorn, 2022) and has been pointed out to be a danger in terms of human\nfreedom and an open society (Esfeld, 2022; see Table 1). \u201cTit for tat\u201d is a\nconcept from game theory, that is somewhat similar to the Death Spiral Effect\nin that parties get stuck in a behavioral mode, reaching suboptimal results\nfor the involved parties, while it would be possible for the parties to change\ntheir behavior (and thereby get better results). The key difference is that\nthe scope of the Death Spiral Effect is much broader, with more far-reaching\nimplications and ripple effects.\n\n### 2.5 Societies in decline: Death Spirals throughout history\n\nScientists have offered a variety of explanations for the collapse of\ncivilizations through ancient and modern history (Tainter, 1989; Spengler,\n1991; Bunce et al., 2009; Scheffer, 2016). Oftentimes, a combination of\nfactors may play a role in societal decline (Jones, 2021). Nevertheless,\nrecurrent patterns operate (Jones, 2021). Oftentimes, markers of decline are\nclear, and the decline may have set in long before the collapse (Scheffer,\n2016). The study of societal collapse, collapsology, is traditionally studied\nby historians, anthropologists and political scientists. Also, experts in\ncliodynamics and complex systems have joined this field, although experts\nwithin management and psychology to date could potentially have much to offer\nin terms of behavioral explanations. Similar to the initial phase of decline\nin companies, societies tend to act too late, they resist change until smooth\nadjustments have become impossible (Scheffer, 2016). The \u201csunk cost effect,\u201d\nbased on escalation of commitment prevents people from leaving and abandoning\ntheir property, ways of living and beliefs, even when the need to do so\nbecomes apparent (Janssen et al., 2003; Scheffer, 2016). Also, oftentimes\nelites may have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo (cf. Pratto et\nal., 2006; Wilkinson and Pickett R. G., 2009).\n\nFrom a psychological point of view, trauma causing a shift in behavioral mode\nfrom functional to dysfunctional seems key to understanding the Death Spiral\nEffect. From a biological point of view, collapse can be viewed as inevitable\nafter a period of large population growth (Downey et al., 2016). As complex\nsystems, common factors may contribute to decline, and these may have ripple\nor cascading effects (Diamond, 2013). For a long time, the Malthusian\ncatastrophe (the idea that the population growth outgrows the (linear) food\nsupply, causing mass starvation and deaths) was perceived as a major threat\n(e.g., Diamond, 2013; Ramya et al., 2020). However, within a complex\nagricultural system, it seems possible to feed a growing world population.\nAlso there seems to be general agreement in the literature that food shortages\nin past times were not the sole cause of societal collapse, and maybe even\nmore a consequence of societies inability to deal with their problems\n(Diamond, 2013). Erosion of established systems and resulting lack of loyalty\nto established political institutions plus an increase in inequalities are all\nmarkers of decline (Turchin, 2007; Diamond, 2013; Van Bavel and Scheffer,\n2021). In the interconnected globalized \u2018system-of-systems\u2019, \u2018a failure in one\npart could lead to disaster across the whole structure\u2019 (Centeno et al., 2022;\np. 61). Some see signs that society may be at the brink of collapse (Page,\n2005), and that while the scale of disaster can be unprecedented, lessons from\nthe past in terms of complex systems are still relevant today (Centeno et al.,\n2022). Poor institutional choices result in an inability to solve collective\naction problems (Page, 2005). It has recently been noted that we live in a\ngreat third power shift in modern history, after the first, the rise of the\nWestern world since the 15th century, and the second, near the end of the 19th\ncentury, the rise of the United States (Peters et al., 2022). The current\npower shift is defined by a rise of China, India, Brazil and Russia. An\nimportant problem that the US are dealing with is not only the growth of\neconomic inequalities, which are huge, but also political division of society,\nmilitary overreach and financial crises (Peters et al., 2022). The power elite\nhave positions that enable them to make decisions that have far-reaching\nconsequences for ordinary men and women. They are also often in a position\nthat they can influence politicians an pressure groups (Mills, 2018). At the\nsame time, some authors refer to a netocracy, a global upper-class with a\npower-base derived from technological advantage and networking skills. The new\nunderclass, or masses, is called consumtariat, whose main activity is\nconsumption, regulated by those in power (Bard and S\u00f6derqvist, 2002).\nGenerally, what becomes apparent in the literature is that rising\ninequalities, which represent basically a growing divide between elite and\nmasses, are an important and potentially reversable marker of societal decline\n(Moghaddam, 2010; Diamond, 2019).\n\n### 2.6 Repeated low-quality decision-making\n\nIn a society in decline, the rate of decline and possible reversal are\ncodependent on the governmental responses (Toynbee, 1987; Hutton, 2014). In\nsome cases, there will be inaction, if a threat is not perceived as needing\nurgent action, but equally devastating can be overreaction to a threat (Maor,\n2012; Maor, 2020; Hafsi and Baba, 2022). An action bias, a bias favoring\naction over inaction, often occurs when incentives to take action are bigger\nthan incentives to refrain from action (Patt and Zeckhauser, 2000). After a\nwhile of ignoring warning signs, a tendency to react too strongly may take\nover, and this may also include suboptimal decision-making (Lorange and\nNelson, 1985). When a crisis is over, decision makers may often not carefully\nconsider all pros and cons. Taking these kinds of actions is more common than\ntaking preventative, anticipatory actions, such as health advice, action to\nprevent a health crisis, and actions to prevent an environmental crisis (Patt\nand Zeckhauser, 2000; Magness and Earle, 2021). In the COVID-19 and\naccompanying economic crisis for instance, there is evidence of such an action\nbias (Winsberg et al., 2020; Magness and Earle, 2021, p. 512; Schippers et\nal., 2022). People often assume that a big problem needs harsh and drastic\nsolutions, while less drastic, but precise solutions, as well as targeted,\nevidence-based interventions can work better than aggressive solutions (cf.\nBrown and Detterman, 1987; Wilson, 2011; Walton, 2014). Action bias, along\nwith escalation of commitment and sunk cost fallacy may have played a role in\nthe suboptimal decision-making processes surrounding the COVID-19 crisis\n(Schippers and Rus, 2021). Combined with the (in hindsight) overestimation\nmade by experts of the expected infection fatality and of the buffering\neffects of several aggressive measures (Chin et al., 2021; Ioannidis et al.,\n2022; Pezzullo et al., 2023) led to a disastrous chain of self-perpetuating\ndecision-making (Magness and Earle, 2021; Murphy, 2021). Instead of dialing\nback, the general political climate and response doubled down on the measures\nand on defending a narrative in their support, leading to a Death Spiral of\nlow-quality decision making and serious consequences.\n\n### 2.7 Key marker of societal decline: rising inequalities\n\nIn current society, there are some clear signs of societal decline. While\ndwindling resources are not always apparent in declining societies, a key\nmarker is hierarchical order and an elite with plenty of access to resources\nwhile the masses have increasing difficulties to survive (Diamond, 2013;\nRushkoff, 2022). Recently, a rather steep increase in inequalities has been\nobserved (for a review see Schippers et al., 2022). This increase is partly\ncaused by wage inequality, which the last 40 years has sharply increased in\ndeveloping countries (Acemo\u011flu and Restrepo, 2021). Wage inequality is for a\nlarge part caused by automation (Acemo\u011flu and Restrepo, 2021). While poverty\ndecreased since the 19th century (Sullivan and Hickel, 2023), there are now\nclear signs that this trend is being reversed. Economic inequality has been\nfound to have a range of effects such as reducing mental and physical health\n(Wilkinson and Pickett R., 2009; Pickett and Wilkinson, 2015), decreasing\ntrust, cooperation and social cohesion in society (Gustavsson and Jordahl,\n2008; Elgar and Aitken, 2010; Van de Werfhorst and Salverda, 2012),\nheightening violence and social unrest (D\u2019Hombres et al., 2012; Jetten et al.,\n2021) and increasing support for autocratic leadership (Jetten et al., 2021).\nRising inequalities may thus have more far-reaching consequences and\ndestabilizing effects than commonly believed, also via the effect on citizens\u2019\nsociopolitical behaviors and decreased social cohesion (Van Bavel, 2016;\nJetten et al., 2021). Since the global financial crisis of 2008, this trend\ntoward rising inequalities has become more visible (Jetten et al., 2021).\nHealth within a population gets progressively worse alongside a development of\ndecreased economic equality. Societies with relative equal levels of income\ncommonly also have low levels of stress and high levels of trust, and people\nin such societies are generally cooperative. In unequal societies distrust\nrises as the rich fear the poor, they worry to safeguard their wealth, while\nthe poor suffer from stress, status anxiety and bitterness (Wilkinson and\nPickett R., 2009; Wilkinson and Pickett R. G., 2009). Health and life\nexpectancy lowers for the poor, unemployed and low-level employees (Smith et\nal., 1990; Marmot and Shipley, 1996; Neckerman and Torche, 2007; Boehm et al.,\n2011). Importantly, economic inequality has also been described as a downward\nspiraling effect of social problems. These include teenage pregnancies, with\nbabies born to such mothers at greater risk of educational failure, juvenile\ncrime and becoming teenage parents themselves, with decreasing health, and\nincreasing imprisonment of those lowest on the social ladder (Wilkinson and\nPickett R., 2009). On a grander scale, societies fall apart and societal\ndysfunction rises when an ever increasing group of have-nots are unable to\nsustain themselves, let alone earn the money and produce the food to sustain\nthe rich, and the difference between the elite and masses have become too big\nto bridge (Wilkinson and Pickett R., 2009, Wilkinson and Pickett R. G., 2009).\n\nNote that while most social problems are bigger in unequal countries, suicide\nand smoking levels are often higher in contemporary relatively equal\nsocieties, as aggression and violence is turned inward, and often will be\ndirected at the self, as people tend to blame themselves when things are not\ngreat (Wilkinson and Pickett R., 2009). Inequality may be at the root of many\nproblems in societies and more equal societies do better on almost all fronts\n(Marmot and Shipley, 1996; Wilkinson and Pickett R., 2009; Boehm et al.,\n2011).\n\n### 2.8 Historical examples of rising inequalities and societal decline\n\nPrior to the 19th century, most unskilled laborers were able to provide for a\nfamily of four (Sullivan and Hickel, 2023). A review on wages and mortality\nsince the 16th century showed that in general extreme poverty was not\nwidespread, with the exception of severe social disruption and dislocation,\nsuch as war, famine and institutionalized dispossession. Interestingly, the\nrise of capitalism initially caused a dramatic decrease of human welfare, in\nterms of a decline in wages below subsistence level. In several regions, such\nas Northwest Europe, progress in terms of human welfare only began in the\n1880\u2019s, and in other regions as late as the mid-20th century. This period was\ncharacterized by anti-colonial and social political movements, and a\nredistribution of incomes as well public provisioning systems and the welfare\nstate (Sullivan and Hickel, 2023).\n\nGoing back even further, during the decline of the Roman Empire, a Death\nSpiral seems to have been apparent. Even when the end was near, instead of\ntrying to address the problems, there was unrealistic and excessive optimism\nabout the future, and adherence to the past (Grant, 1976). In the earlier\nperiods of the empire, the elites were willing to offer lives and treasure in\nthe service of the common interest, while in the period of decline, the elites\nbecame increasing selfish (Turchin, 2007). This went hand in hand with a\ndecline in dearly held values such as thinking for the common good and\nvirtues, enlarged bureaucracies and a rise in inequalities with steep increase\nin enrichment of the richest 1 percent in Rome, and an impoverishment of the\nmiddle classes (Goldsworthy, 2009).\n\n> \u201c(...) the richest 1 percent of the Romans during the early Republic was\n> only 10 to 20 times as wealthy as an average Roman citizen. (...) By around\n> A.D. 400, just before the collapse of the empire and when the degree of\n> wealth inequality reached its maximum value, an average Roman noble of\n> senatorial class had property valued in the neighborhood of 20,000 Roman\n> pounds of gold. There was no \u201cmiddle class\u201d comparable to the small\n> landholders of the third century B.C.; the huge majority of the population\n> was made up of landless peasants working land that belonged to nobles. These\n> peasants had hardly any property at all, but if we estimate it (very\n> generously) at one tenth of a pound of gold, the wealth differential would\n> be 200,000! Inequality grew both as a result of the rich getting richer\n> (late imperial senators were 100 times wealthier than their Republican\n> predecessors) and those of the middling wealth becoming poor, and indeed\n> destitute.\u201d (Turchin, 2007; pp. 160\u2013161).\n\nThis rise of inequalities seems an overarching theme in many collapsing empire\nanalyses (Turchin, 2007). The work of Turchin describes a series of nested\ncycles of periods of relative prosperity and plenty, leading to an increase of\npopulation, but also to growing inequalities and dysfunctionality. Inequality\naffects asabiyya,^1 or social cohesion, defined by Turchin as: \u201cthe capacity\nof a social group for concerted collective action\u201d (Turchin, 2007; p. 6).\nAsabiyya is generally high in times that empires are rising and low when\nempires are in decline (Turchin, 2007). Similar to the \u201cUniverse 25\u201d\nexperiment (described in par. 1.1.10), this in turn leads to a breakdown in\ncollaborative efforts and precedes a period of scarcity. In the next phase,\ndisease, hunger, violence and war then lead to a rapid decline and often\ncollapse of civilization (Turchin, 2007; see Figure 2).\n\n### 2.9 COVID-19 crisis and rising inequalities\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 crisis, some have stated that this is a great\nleveler and that \u201cwe are all in this together,\u201d however, this is clearly not\nthe case: vulnerable groups have been unevenly negatively impacted (Ali et\nal., 2020). Inequalities have risen steeply since 2020 (Schippers et al.,\n2022). While this trend was already visible before the pandemic started (for a\nreview see Neckerman and Torche, 2007), especially billionaire wealth\nincreased dramatically early during the crisis (Schippers et al., 2022;\nInequality, 2023). Between March 18, 2020, and October 15, 2021, billionaires\u2019\ntotal wealth increased over 70%, from 2.947 trillion to 5.019 trillion, and\nthe richest five saw an increase in 123 percent. Since then, gains have\ndecreased modestly, because of market losses (Collins, 2022). Corporate\nprofits also spiked as giant corporations used the excuse of crisis-related\nsupply chain bottlenecks to drive up the prices of gasoline, food, and other\nessentials (Inequality, 2023). While CEO pay increased, general worker pay\nlagged behind, increasing the CEO-worker pay gap in the United States\n(Inequality, 2023). To prove this in 2019 average CEO pay was $12,074,288 per\nannum compared to a median worker yearly pay at the 100 largest low wage\nemployers of $30,416 in the United States; in 2020 yearly average CEO pay was\n13,936,558 (a 15.42% increase) for workers it was 30,474 (a meager 0.19%\nincrease; Inequality, 2023).\n\nIn effect, global billionaires made 3.9 trillion dollars by the end of 2020,\nwhile global workers earnings fell by 3.7 trillion, as millions lost their\njobs around the world (International Labour Organization, 2020; Berkhout et\nal., 2021; p. 12). The lowest-income workers were hit the hardest. In total,\nit has been estimated that during the crisis, by 2021, 150 million people were\ndriven into extreme poverty (Howton, 2020). With widespread continuing demise,\neven the rich may start to lose. The crisis has worsened many other aspects of\ninequality, such as educational, racial, gender, and health inequalities\n(Byttebier, 2022; for a review see Schippers et al., 2022). Nevertheless, the\nelite may continue to centralize power and make decisions that are not in the\ninterest of most people (Desmet, 2022). As the \u201cmasses\u201d end up being in a\ndownward spiral of dwindling incomes, not being able to pay for essentials,\nsuch as food, gas, and medicine, they may experience significant financial\nbarriers and may avoid health care in order to save on costs (Weinick et al.,\n2005), leading to worsening health status for millions (Schippers et al.,\n2022). Socio-economic determinants of health are often the result of\npersistent structural and socio-economical inequalities, exacerbated by the\nCOVID-19 crisis (Ali et al., 2020; Schippers, 2020). The term syndemic\ndescribes \u201ca set of closely related and mutually reinforcing health problems\nthat significantly affect the overall health status of a population, against\nthe background of a perpetual pattern of deleterious socio-economic\nconditions\u201d (Bambra et al., 2020; Byttebier, 2022, p. 1036). Prior pandemic\ncrises such as the Spanish flu and other economic shocks led to an increase in\ninequalities and unequal health and wealth outcomes (Bambra et al., 2020).\nSudden economic shocks, such as the collapse of communism, are related to an\nincrease in morbidity, mental health decline, suicide, increased ill health\nand deaths from substance use (Bambra et al., 2020). These effects were\nexperienced unequally in poorer regions, and among low-skilled workers,\nexacerbating health inequalities (Bambra et al., 2020). Interestingly, after\nthe 2008 financial crisis, countries that chose not to cut back on health and\nsocial protection budgets, had better outcomes than countries that made\naustere cuts in those budgets (Stuckler and Basu, 2013; Bambra et al., 2020).\nIn current times, people lower on the social ladder bore the brunt of the\nnegative side effects of the measures, in health, lifestyle changes as well as\ndecrease in income (Schippers et al., 2022), even increasing their\nvulnerability to viral diseases (Enichen et al., 2022).\n\nThe dysfunctional situation in most countries worldwide strengthens the\nincentives for mass migration into Western countries that still offer better\nprospects, in theory at least. However, this challenge, if mishandled, may\nlead to importing poverty (Martin, 2009; Murray, 2017) creating an underclass,\nand further proclivity of an unequal society and possibly a Death Spiral\nEffect (cf. Gomberg-Mu\u00f1oz, 2012; Peters and Shin, 2022). Furthermore, there is\nsome evidence that poverty gives rise to higher crime rates (Dong et al.,\n2020). In the US, even minor crimes are severely punished, and imprisonment of\npoor people escalates inequalities (Wacquant, 2009; Wilkinson and Pickett,\n2009a).\n\n### 2.10 Dysfunctional behavior of both elites and masses\n\nPrior research has shown that extreme inequalities lead to dysfunctional\nsocieties, both in the animal kingdom as well as in human societies (Grusky\nand Ku, 2008). In the animal kingdom it has been shown to lead to \u201cbehavioral\nsink\u201d or extreme dysfunctional behavior (Anderson and Bushman, 2002). In the\nUniverse 25 behavioral experiment, mice lived in perfect conditions with\nenough living space, food and water, but when their numbers grew, inequalities\nrose and the behavior of all mice became dysfunctional and led to the\nextinction of the colony, long before the maximum number of mice was reached\n(Calhoun, 1973; Adams and Ramsden, 2011). It has been argued that in that\nparticular experiment, where resources were plenty, the controlling of\nresources by a small number of mice, as well as excessive (negative)\ninteraction led to the decline of the colony (Ramsden, 2011). Even after the\nnumbers fell to lower than when pathology set in, mice behavior stayed\ndysfunctional (Ramsden and Adams, 2009). The extent to which these studies\nhave validity for human society is certainly debatable. For obvious ethical\nreasons, it is for instance not possible to do a study in which a form of\nextreme hierarchy is tested, and subsequently lifted, but there is general\nagreement that countries with high inequalities have more social problems\n(Grusky and Ku, 2008; Van Bavel, 2016).\n\nHistorically, the elite that accelerates problematic societal developments and\noftentimes is at the start of the Death Spiral Effect, either because of their\ngreed and hunger for power, or just because power corrupts, is also getting\nanxious as societal decline progresses (Baker, 2022; Rushkoff, 2022). The\npressure to perpetuate economic growth comes with repercussions and an\ninevitable crumbling of financial markets, as for instance happened in 2008\n(Rushkoff, 2009). Rushkoff (2009) had hoped there would be a self-correcting\nmechanism when financial markets collapse, but this apparently was not the\ncase. As the elite notice that things are going wrong, often, instead of using\ntheir wealth to make things better, they use their buffer for protecting\nthemselves from the \u201cmasses\u201d and for \u201cescapism.\u201d They start looking for ways\nto escape the pending societal collapse that they helped creating (Rushkoff,\n2022). While the masses experience a loss of freedom and prosperity, and may\ndesperately try to hold on to whatever property and resources they still have\n(desperation principle; Hobfoll et al., 2018), the elite also realizes\ndisaster may strike and they may also get into a survival mode, and may even\nstart to fight each other (cf., Turchin, 2007).\n\nCurrently, the optimism of connectivity and the internet and the possibilities\nfor open source democracy seem to have faded (Rushkoff, 2003). Censorship has\nset in, along with a loss of scientific freedom (Da Silva, 2021; Kaufmann,\n2021; Shir-Raz et al., 2022). The scientific debate was stifled during the\nCOVID-19 crisis and dissenting views were censored (Shir-Raz et al., 2022).\nSuppression tactics resulted in damaging careers of dissenting doctors and\nscientists regardless of academic or medical status (Shir-Raz et al., 2022).\nThis has led to a loss of trust in science and institutions (Hamilton and\nSafford, 2021). Worse, when knowledgeable scientists with reasonable arguments\nand rigorous data are suppressed, this could offer ammunition to conspiracy\ntheorists to claim that orthodox science is non-tolerant and wrong. Especially\ncentralized censorship may increase certainty in radicalized views (Lane et\nal., 2021). Anyone questioning. science\u2019 and official governmental narratives\nmay be called a conspiracy theorist, as a way of discrediting and\ndelegitimizing critics (Giry and G\u00fcrp\u0131nar, 2020). It has been argued that\nconspiracy theories are also a sign of dissatisfaction with governance,\nsociety or policies, and some conspiracy theories may turn out to be true\n(Swami and Furnham, 2014).\n\nSurveillance capitalism, the collection and commodification of personal data\nby corporations, shifts the power of governments toward large companies (Big\nOther). These corporations have the power to observe and influence human\nthinking and decision-making for example via direct advertising. Direct\nadvertising has become far more aggressive (Schwartz and Woloshin, 2019),\nespecially for products of little benefit and high sales (DiStefano et al.,\n2023). Effective direct advertising can be guided by surveillance capitalism.\nThis can be a tool for business (knowing customers preferences) but also an\ninvasion of privacy (Zuboff, 2015, 2023, see also Yeung, 2018). Worryingly,\nstrategic actors such as large corporations and governments (i.e., the elite)\ncan unevenly influence the media (media bias), possibly leading to an\nincreasingly narrowing of the definition of \u201cfacts/true knowledge\u201d versus\n\u201cfake news/disinformation,\u201d e.g., stating that only governmental or other\nelite-endorsed narratives represent the. truth\u2019 (cf. Gehlbach and Sonin,\n2014). People and scientists that differ in their views from the official\nnarrative, can be censored, marginalized and expelled, even if they are\nprudent in their publications and wording within the debate (cf. Prasad and\nIoannidis, 2022). Some authors have even contended that this combination may\nbring us on a path toward totalitarianism (Desmet, 2022), and have called for\na way to rethink and uphold democracy and democratic principles (Della Porta,\n2021; Ioannidis and Schippers, 2022), as well as democratic control of\ntechnology (Gould, 1990).\n\nA more positive solution such as a form of direct democracy is often not\nconsidered and if it is, people often feel not capable of bringing this about\n(cf. Rushkoff, 2019). In general, under such conditions, distrust escalates as\nthe elite starts to fear the masses and the masses fear the elite and both\ntend to show dysfunctional behavior (cf. Widmann, 2022). When in phase 4\n(Figure 2) resources dwindle as a result of the continuously downward spiral,\nthe desperation principle may apply. The desperation principle has been\nformulated within the conservation of resources theory (COR; Hobfoll et al.,\n2018). In COR theory, people, organizations and societies strive to obtain and\nhold on to resources they value. Since resource loss is more salient than\nresource gain, people go to great length to prevent resource loss. However,\nindividual and groups must invest resources in order to prevent resource loss,\nrecover from losses and/or gain resources. When valuable resources are lost,\nresource gains become more important (Hobfoll et al., 2018). The desperation\nprinciple states that \u201cWhen people\u2019s resources are outstretched or exhausted,\nthey enter a defensive mode to preserve the self which is often defensive,\naggressive, and may become irrational\u201d (Hobfoll et al., 2018, p. 106).\nResource loss cycles indicate that tress and a cycle of faulty decision-making\nmay lead to less resources to offset resources loss and these loss spirals\n\u201cgain in momentum as well as magnitude.\u201d At the same time, \u201cresource gain\nspirals tend to be weak and develop slowly\u201d (Hobfoll et al., 2018, p. 106).\nThis indicates that once this spiral has set in, it is hard to reverse and the\nDeath Spiral Effect may set in.\n\n## 3 Reversing the downward spiral: upward spiral\n\n### 3.1 Breaking free: strategies to overcome societal dysfunctional behavior\n\nIn general, grand societal challenges such as rising inequalities, social\nunrest and societal decline affect large portions of the population, are\nhighly significant, but are potentially solvable (Eisenhardt et al., 2016).\nLately, management scholars have applied organizational knowledge to a\nsocietal context by formulating solutions for such societal challenges using\nmanagement theories (George et al., 2016), and models have been offered to\nintegrate literature on resilience with crisis management literature (Williams\net al., 2017). For instance scholars have offered solutions to alleviate\npoverty (e.g., Banerjee and Duflo, 2011; Mair et al., 2016) and psychological\ninjury in the context of large conflict and wars (De Rond and Lok, 2016). With\nrespect to decreasing inequalities, especially work by Mair et al. (2016)\ncould be of interest, as they propose scaffolding as a way to decrease\ninequalities and alleviate poverty. A downward spiral may be reversed by using\nan adaptive response. This may be important in order to reverse the trend, but\nalso in case of post-collapse recovery (cf. Bunce et al., 2009). Based on the\nliterature cited above, the following steps may be necessarhin\n\nMaking sure that people involved are also participating in the in decision-\nmaking process is key. As Perret et al. (2020): 1 state: \u201cThe fate of states,\ncompanies and organizations are shaped by their decisions. It is then\nsurprising that only a minority of individuals are involved in the decision-\nmaking process.\u201d This would suggest that a rigorous change in the way societal\ndecisions are made may be an important point to intervene (Lupia and\nMatsusaka, 2004; Demarest and Victor, 2022). In general, the upward spiral may\nstart with (1) open mindedness with regards to changes necessary to break the\ndownward spiral. These may include (2) reflection on the current and desired\nsituation, as well as (3) the development of a strategy for the restoration of\ntrust, rather than a focus on finding scapegoats (avoidance of a blame game\ncan be reached for instance via a truth and reconciliation commission), and\n(4) involvement of more society members. This may lead to (5) higher quality\ndecision-making and enhanced autonomy and positive ripple effects within\nsociety, and this may in turn lead to (6) decreased social inequalities and\n(7) a more free and open society where people can thrive and prosper. Bouncing\nback from adversity may then require both resilience and compassion, as\ndescribed below.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience\n\nThe concept of resilience, or how individuals, organizations and societies\nbounce back from adverse events, is informative (Van Der Vegt et al., 2015),\nand this is also mentioned as an important concept within complex adaptive\nsystems models (e.g., Centeno et al., 2022). Resilience on all levels seem to\nbe dependent on social integration, for instance on how supportive families\nand communities are, and this is especially apparent in times of crises\n(Banerjee and Duflo, 2011; Van Der Vegt et al., 2015). Having resilient\nnetworks is also important in this respect, and research on how to strengthen\nnetworks and communities may be key to societal resilience and rebuilding\nsociety after decline has set in (Van Der Vegt et al., 2015). Trust and\ncompassion, as well as effective communication and collaboration within\nnetworks may enable not only more effective response to crises and disasters\n(Shepherd and Williams, 2014), but also reduce suffering caused by societal\ndecline (Williams and Shepherd, 2017). After disasters, such as earthquakes,\nit has been found that family firms, especially those that involve more\nmembers, are best positioned to make use of posttraumatic entrepreneurial\nopportunities for recovery and growth (Salvato et al., 2020). Recent work in a\ncompany context has shown that companies can react to adverse events in\ndiverse ways to post-shock challenges (Shepherd and Williams, 2022). This\nresearch highlights the role of post-adversity growth during adversity and\ngives insight in the different paths to resilience. This research offers\ninsights in how to break a Death Spiral and move toward an upward spiral.\n\n### 3.3 Compassion\n\nAs a downward spiral is often accompanied with a loss of humanness, the\nreversal of the downward trend will need a restauration of humanness and\ncompassion. Compassion organizing was coined as a term to describe the\ncoordinated organizational response to human suffering inside and outside of\nthe organization (Dutton et al., 2006). Compassion is an innate response to\nhuman suffering, and involves recognition of suffering, empathetic concern and\nbehavior that is aimed at alleviating suffering (Dutton et al., 2006). The\nreversal of a downward trend of societal decline, may be more difficult than\nposttraumatic growth after (natural) disasters, by its sheer scale. While a\ndisaster may provoke compassionate organizing to alleviate mass suffering\n(Shepherd and Williams, 2014; Williams and Shepherd, 2017), what can be done\nfor the alleviation of suffering and crisis management in the context of\nsocietal decline may be less obvious (cf. Williams et al., 2017). Often,\nindividuals, teams and organizations working to alleviate suffering experience\nintense emotions that may spur strong involvement of volunteers and companies,\nand people often refer to this as a \u201ccalling\u201d (De Rond and Lok, 2016; Schabram\nand Maitlis, 2017; Langenbusch, 2020). However, that sensemaking and strong\nemotion can also lead to faulty decision-making (Cornelissen et al., 2014;\nHafsi and Baba, 2022). In the COVID-19 crisis, digital innovations were\nsuggested as a way to alleviate suffering (Majchrzak and Shepherd, 2021).\nHowever, we need rigorous studies on which compassion-based interventions may\nbe effective. It is important to help people to regain a sense of purpose in\nlife and increase posttraumatic growth of individuals and groups in society\n(De Jong et al., 2020; Dekker et al., 2020).\n\n### 3.4 Turnaround leadership and culture change\n\nPrior research has shown that leadership is key to follower behavior (Cao et\nal., 2022). Passive and destructive leadership styles, such as abusive,\nnarcissistic and authoritarian, were associated with higher levels of\ndysfunctional follower behavior, i.e., workplace aggression. Conversely,\nethical leadership, change-oriented as well as relational-oriented leadership\nwas negatively associated with workplace aggression. If leaders\u2019 behavior\nchanges, this also affects organizational culture and behavior of followers.\n\nA historical turnaround leader that managed to get a country out of a negative\nspiral was Nelson Mandela, in South Africa. Instead of installing tribunals,\nhe established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This helped to move\nbeyond blame and regain respect for one another. A problem with leaders that\nstep up in turbulent times, is that they are often not recognized and valued\nin the midst of the turmoil by the masses, and they may also be seen as\nenemies of the ruling elite. As they try to reverse the downward spiral, they\nmay face hardship, imprisonment, and sometimes even death. As a case in point,\nNelson Mandela spent over 27 years in prison.\n\nTurnaround leadership faces the difficult task to break the negative spiral\nand restore trust and bring back positive energy within the organization\n(Bibeault, 1981) or society (Gibson, 2006). This is all the more difficult,\nbecause such companies often suffer from collective denial, or unwillingness\nto admit that there is a problem at all. Sometimes the problems become so big,\nthat people act like the problem does not exist (cf. Meyer and Kunreuther,\n2017). On a company level, it has been observed that even though individually,\npeople know and may even admit that the company is in trouble, they collude in\ncollective denial, or pluralistic ignorance (Kanter, 2003). Strategies that\nsuccessful turnaround leaders in companies often employ are promoting dialog,\nengendering respect, sparking collaboration and inspiring initiative (Kanter,\n2003). The challenge is how far the tactics used by a turn-around leader\nwithin an organization can be applied on a societal level as well. Without a\nshared vision, recovery after collapse in the context of adaptive systems is\nunlikely (Bunce et al., 2009).\n\n### 3.5 Avoidance of blame game\n\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, many people started to suspect that conspiracies\nwere at play, probably due to both the scale of events, as well as the need\nfor explanations (Van Bavel et al., 2020; Douglas, 2021; Pummerer et al.,\n2021; Ivanova, 2022). While the belief in conspiracy theories has been related\nto reduced institutional trust, lower support for and adherence to imposed\nmeasures (Pummerer et al., 2021), it can also be seen as an ineffective form\nof coping with the situation (Schippers, 2020). While people may have a need\nfor finding out who or what is to blame for the situation, the dangers of co-\noccurring collective narcissism (i.e., exaggerated belief in the greatness of\nthe in-group, which is not recognized by others) and conspiracy theories, such\nas the endorsement of violence and undemocratic governance, have been pointed\nout (De Zavala et al., 2022). As the relevance and/or truthfulness of\nconspiracy theories are often hard to check, constructive ways forward are\noften blocked if these run rampant. When focusing on parties that are to blame\nfor the situation, while some people may feel that revenge can be helpful,\nblame mostly fulfills a felt need for retribution and only a subset of people\nseems to find revenge important and even pleasurable (Szymaniak et al., 2023).\nPunishment of perpetrators is not very effective to prevent or retribute\ntransgressions in terms of law enforcement (Metz, 2022). In the current\nsituation, this may be even more complicated, as a lot of damage may have been\ndone for the \u201cright\u201d reasons, i.e., in the name of public health (Schippers\nand Rus, 2021; Schippers et al., 2022). It may be hard to disentangle\nmotivations of individual decision makers and decisions were also made in a\ncontext of approval of such measures (cf. Ohlin, 2007). A more constructive\napproach therefore may be in reconciliation (Metz, 2022), reversing the most\naggressive and ineffective policies, and learning from mistakes in order to do\nbetter in the future (Schippers et al., 2022). However, if pressure for\nrevenge and retribution escalates, decision-makers who made grave mistakes\nwill likely double down on their mistakes in order to avoid punishment. As\nmany of these decision-makers continue to have power in (or on) public health\nand science, such defensive continued endorsement of false narratives can be\ndevastating for the credibility of both public health and science at large.\nMoreover, it is imperative that people can easily experience positive emotions\ninstead of enduring stressors (Johnson, 2022). Preventing long-term stress is\ncritical to quality of life and longevity (Johnson, 2022). Mutual empathy may\nneed to be promoted in generating a positive view for the future (Beck et al.,\n2018; Halamov\u00e1 et al., 2022).\n\n### 3.6 Civil and intelligent disobedience\n\nWhether in families, groups, organizations or society, if people perceive that\na toxic culture is ingrained or becomes apparent, the majority of people have\nproblems addressing this, out of fear of being excluded from the group, or\nbecause they do not know how to reverse the downward trend (Packer, 2009;\nRichardson, 2020). Richardson (2020) describes that with a change in society\ntoward a \u201cnew normal,\u201d people in power will demand obedience. Concentration of\npower and wealth at the top is often accompanied by forcefully compelling\nobedience to new customs, rules, and behavior. In the early stages people\noften either downplay the signs of danger and may succumb to coercion, out of\nfear for the consequences (Richardson, 2020). People who openly resist, or\ncriticize decisions, often face dire consequences. Effective ways of\n\u201cresisting\u201d listed by Richardson (2020) are a refusal to accept the new goals\nand tradition imposed, not buying into the belief that this new order is\ninevitable, and making a conscious choice to be rather \u201cleft behind\u201d than to\njoin in. This all the while maintaining civility and commitment to the common\ngood, and adhering to values that are important to a civil society\n(Richardson, 2020). Constructive deviance and speaking up (as opposed to\nsilence) are an important step in counteracting (organizational) wrongdoing\n(Starystach and H\u00f6ly, 2021). Also, civil and intelligent disobedience can be\nways to counteract courses of action chosen by leaders and policy makers that\nmay hurt society or companies as a whole may hurt society or companies as a\nwhole (Chaleff, 2015; Hughes and Burnes, 2023). Some even argue that\nconstructive deviance and intelligent disobedience should become socially\nexpected behavior (Ralston, 2010). This is in line with recommendations to\nprevent groupthink to make sure to appoint a \u201cdevil\u2019s advocate\u201d (Janis, 1982b;\nJanis, 1983; MacDougall and Baum, 1997; Akhmad et al., 2020). Interestingly,\ngroup members that strongly identify with the group are more prone to speak\nout on collective problems (Packer, 2009). Another action that individuals and\ngroups can take is high-quality listening, as an antidote to polarization,\nwhich has become a huge issue in society (Itzchakov et al., 2023; Santoro and\nMarkus, 2023). Recent research indicates that genuinely listening in order to\ntry to understand the others\u2019 perspective has been shown to aid\ndepolarization, and can be. a valuable tool for bridging attitudinal and\nideological divides\u2019 (Itzchakov et al., 2023; p. 1).\n\n### 3.7 Collective action\n\nBesides individuals in groups and societies speaking up and voicing concerns,\ncollective action may have additional benefits. While individual control over\nthe social system seems out of reach, collective action can bring about\npositive outcomes for the group as a whole (Klandermans, 1997). Key predictors\nof collective action are perceived injustice, efficacy (i.e., sense of\ncontrol) and identity (i.e., identification with a group; Van Zomeren et al.,\n2008; Van Zomeren, 2013). People are also more likely to engage in protests if\nthey perceive injustice for the group they identify with (Klandermans, 2002).\nInjustice and efficacy seem to be stronger predictors for collective action in\ncase of incidental rather than structural disadvantage, while group\nidentification was a strong predictor for collective action for both types of\ngroups (Kraemer, 2021). While structural disadvantages are more harmful, both\npsychologically and in terms of inequalities, they are less likely to evoke\naction-oriented emotional response and collective action (Major, 1994; Schmitt\nand Branscombe, 2002), and are thus harder to change (Sidanius and Pratto,\n2000; Jost and Major, 2001; Sidanius et al., 2004). Such differences and\nstructural injustices often become ingrained and disadvantaged groups may even\nstart to see their state as natural and immutable (Major, 1994). It is then\nseen as a property of a certain group (Kraemer, 2021) and the existing\ndifferences between groups are seen as legitimate (Jost and Major, 2001).\n\nSocial Dominance Theory seeks to explain how and why societal group-based\ninequalities exist and persist, even though people would wish for a more equal\nsociety (Pratto, 1999; Pratto et al., 2006). In most societies, some groups\nenjoy material and symbolic resources, such as political power, wealth, and\naccess to housing and food (Pratto et al., 2006). Both privileged as well as\nunderprivileged groups may come to see the status quo as legitimate, and this\nis often institutionalized. Profit-maximizing financial institutions, internal\nsecurity organizations and criminal justices systems may enhance hierarchy\n(Pratto et al., 2006). Conversely, human and civil rights movements and\ninstitutions, welfare organizations and religious organizations may reduce\nhierarchy. However, such organizations often lack funding and often do not\nreally challenge the status quo (Pratto et al., 2006). When collective action\nis taken against the status quo, it is often seen as illegitimate and are shut\ndown (Pratto et al., 2006), unfortunately repression of social movements is\nquite common (Loadenthal, 2016). Historically, non-violent collective actions\nhave been more successful then violent ones in (re)instating democracy\n(Chenoweth and Stephan, 2008; Chenoweth, 2021), and this type of actions have\nbecome much more common (Kraemer, 2021, see also Schippers et al., 2022).\nThus, breaking the downward spiral is not easy and is often jeopardized by the\nruling elite.\n\n### 3.8 Top priority: decreasing inequalities\n\nAs we have argued that a (large) increase in inequalities is an important\nmarker of societal decline, this problem seems to be of utmost importance to\naddress. In Figure 3, we depict how this can be done. In the United Nations\nSustainable Development Goals, SDG10 is reducing inequalities (United Nations,\n2022). However, the focus of the targets and indicators seems to be more on\nenhancing inclusion than on explicitly reducing inequalities (Fukuda-Parr,\n2019). This is an important omission, as it would be key to address the issue\nof extreme inequalities and the concentration of wealth at the top (Fukuda-\nParr, 2019). While it is clear from our review that rising inequalities and\nrising authoritarianism can contribute to significant societal decline and\nhigh levels of mortality via the Triangle of Death (disease, famine and war),\nit is not easy to determine where to start in order to reverse this trend.\nWhile this seems a large and complex problem, when thinking of possible\nsolutions, it is clear that effectiveness and ease of implementation matter\nthe most. Communities have a responsibility to investigate methods to act on\nthe social, educational, physical, and mental health crisis. Interventions\nshould be rigorously tested with randomized controlled trials for\neffectiveness and then audited for their implementation success. At the same\ntime, complete equality should not be something to strive for, as this could\nkill innovation and creativity, rather, an optimal level of income differences\nis key (Charles-Coll, 2010). Indeed, it seems there is an optimum level of\n(in)equality, showing an inverted \u201cU\u201d shaped relationship (Charles-Coll,\n2010). In situations where ordinary people are involved in shaping the\nresponse to crisis, a further widening of disparities seem to have been\nprevented (Van Bavel and Scheffer, 2021), and hence this seems a promising\navenue in going forward.\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3. Upward spiral breaking the Death Spiral: from societal decline to\nsocietal flourishing.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis and measures of unprecedented severity and duration are\nrelated to many negative side effects and increase inequalities worldwide\n(Marmot and Allen, 2020); hence stress, health, and trauma for vulnerable\npopulations must be addressed (Whitehead and Torossian, 2020). It may take a\nlong time to recover from the economic fall-out and rise in inequalities\n(Whitehead and Torossian, 2020). Governments should take individual and\nsocietal well-being as a spearhead for decision-making in the upcoming years\n(Frijters et al., 2020). Hopefully, with effective interventions, the tide can\nbe turned and a positive spiral can be induced (e.g., Schippers and Ziegler,\n2023). However, while many ideas and proposals may emerge, implementing them\nwithout rigorous trials may add further waste after we have already endorsed\ntoo many failed interventions.\n\n## 4 Final comments\n\nSocietal demise and collapse are part of the cyclical nature of civilizations,\nthat have historically seen a rise and fall over time. The Death Spiral Effect\nentails rising inequalities and rising authoritarianism, creating an elite\nthat controls access to resources more tightly, and making decisions that may\nset humanity on a path to famine, war and disease. If the trend of decline is\nnot reversed, the aftermath of a possible collapse will become evident, and\nsociety may be unable to achieve post-collapse recovery.\n\nIn short, our review, synthesizing research from several fields, indicates\nthat next to turnaround leadership and building resilient communities, using\ncompassion, avoiding a blame culture and strengthening of democracy may help.\nIdeally, governments, companies, all relevant stakeholders as well as\nindividuals should collaborate toward the goals of a healthier and happier\nfuture for all.\n\n## Author contributions\n\nMS played the primary role in the conception of the manuscript, writing,\nreviewing, and revising the manuscript.
