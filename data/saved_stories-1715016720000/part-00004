Multiple Pulsars can be networked together to provide adaptable\nand comprehensive coverage based on environment and mission requirements.\n\n## Pulsar-V\n\nPulsar-V is a vehicle variant for Pulsar that can be mounted and integrated\ninto a variety of vehicles leveraging a standard NATO mount.\n\n## Pulsar-A\n\nPulsar-A is an airborne payload variant of Pulsar that can be adapted to\nsupport a variety of manned and unmanned aircrafts.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n(1) Pulsar is not approved by the FCC for sale or operation in the United\nStates; (2) Pulsar may only be purchased by the U.S. federal government to\nsupport operations authorized under U.S. law; (3) Pulsar may be eligible for\npurchase by foreign national governments, subject to applicable domestic\nspectrum regulations and U.S. export law.\n\nAnduril\n\n### About Us\n\n  * Mission\n  * Careers\n  * Leadership\n  * Newsroom\n  * Blog\n  * Media\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Instagram\n\n### Capabilities\n\n  * Counter UAS\n  * Counter Intrusion\n  * Maritime Counter Intrusion\n\n### Products\n\n  * ALTIUS\n  * Anvil\n  * Command & Control\n  * Dive-LD\n  * Fury\n  * Ghost\n  * Iris\n\n  * Menace\n  * Mission Autonomy\n  * Pulsar\n  * Roadrunner\n  * Sentry\n  * Solid Rocket Motors\n  * WISP\n\n### Contact UsCopy email\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Anduril Industries\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Modern Anti-Slavery Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
