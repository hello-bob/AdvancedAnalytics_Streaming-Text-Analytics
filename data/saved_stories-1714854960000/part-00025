We\nsometimes forgo logic in certain domains of knowledge, for it is convenient.\nSo is the case in physics, where fringe ideas have become the norm and\nprovably impossible theories have become the acclaimed truth.\n\nOne such theory, which is parroted by the curious and the highly acclaimed\nphysicists alike, is that randomness is fundamental to quantum physics. This\nclaim is in direct contradiction to logic, as logic does not permit the\nexistence of randomness in a true sense, else all known laws of logic would be\nbroken. This has not stopped the idea from becoming a central tenet of modern\nphysics, despite it not being fundamental in any important aspect. To be\nfundamental would mean that without the assumption of true randomness the\nquantum world would not work, or at least be different. Suffice to say, true\nrandomness has no application, but only serves as a logical contradiction.\n\nRandomness, in it's ultimate form, means that if we knew all the laws and the\nstate of all things inside and outside the world, one would still not be able\nto determine the outcome of things. Nevertheless the world happens to know how\nto determines the outcome of things. It's a pending contradiction.\n\nYoung physicists point to Bell's inequality as evidence for 'true randomness'\nin quantum physics. For reasons unbeknownst to me, non-locality has been\nconflated and equated with randomness, despite those two being, in truth, not\nonly unrelated, but also preferably not to be shoved into one statement. Non-\nlocality is only a property of an abstract structure, while randomness is a\nconcept rooted in fallacy.\n\nIt is as though you see two neighbors arguing, and then wrongly assert that\nthe dog is the source of the noise, except a dog talking is more 'likely' than\ntrue randomness. That is because the latter is logically unsound, whilst the\nformer isn't necessarily. And, as is supposedly true in Bell's inequality, we\nhave succeeded in proving that which we already know to be false.\n\nBecause 'true randomness' is pushed by physicists to a degree not greatly\ndiffering from religious dogma, there have been theories that have been\nproposed in order to explain and understand its existence. Like the many-\nworlds interpretation, which presumes that all possible outcomes happen in\ndifferent world-lines and that we only end up taking one world-line out of\nmany at random. It's unclear how that is any different to saying that there\nare many possible outcomes, and you end up with one at random, or in short,\nhow it's any different to randomness. Further, it is unclear how true\nrandomness holds any importance in quantum physics: one could assume that all\nof it is deterministic, as it would logically be, and then admit that we don't\nhave the knowledge to predict it. It would make no difference, but perhaps it\ncould save us time on some of the fringe theories. Ironically, we attempt to\napply logic to something illogical.\n\nIt is somewhat frightening that these theories have spread and been entrenched\nso deeply in modern physics. Worse is that physicists have no problem coming\nto strong yet unsound conclusions, partly due to these glaring holes in logic.\nBut why is it that logic is used sometimes, and other times not? One can think\nup all the theories they want, but if it does not hold water logically, then\nit does not make sense. Full stop.\n\nWe are comfortable accepting things which cannot be true. Instead of trying to\nmake sense of the quantum world, we assume it does not make sense, or needn't\nmake sense, and then pride ourselves in it. We foster 'physical mysticism.'\nBut it is without doubt that for whichever physics we discover, and whichever\nobservations we make, that it is functionally impossible to prove them to be\n'beyond logic.' Will you prove the impossible? Not a chance. So is the case\nwhen we call something truly random.\n\nIn short, physicists should not make dubious claims that only serves to muddy\nthe water and promote a poorer understanding of physics. It would be of\ngreater benefit if we always attempted to make our models logically sound, as\nmodels should be. Perhaps it would stir up greater discussion on how to\nunderstand the world around us, not swallow it.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
