Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# How WASD became the standard PC control scheme\n\nFeatures\n\nBy Tyler Wilde\n\npublished 24 June 2016\n\nHad history gone differently, it might have been EDSF or even ASXC.\n\nImage via defunct gaming site Freakygaming.\n\nWASD feels inevitable today. Once mouselook became standard in 3D games, it\nmade little sense (at least for right-handed players) to hold your left arm\nacross your chest to reach the arrow keys. The WASD keys were more\ncomfortable, and offered easy access to Shift and Space. But even though WASD\nseems like the obvious choice now, far fewer players used it 20 years ago.\n\nOur favorite four letter word was never a foregone conclusion, and didn't\nbecome standard through some gaseous enlightening that spread to every PC\ngamer simultaneously. The new movement scheme took several years to catch on,\nand while we can\u2019t know whose fingers found their way to WASD first, we do\nhave a good idea of who popularized the style: the greatest Quake player in\nthe universe, Dennis \u201cThresh\u201d Fong.\n\nFong made history when he took home John Carmack's Ferrari 328 after winning\nthe first-ever nationwide Quake tournament in 1997. And when he won that\ntournament, defeating Tom \"Entropy\" Kimzey on Castle of the Damned, his right\nhand was on a mouse, and his left hand was perched over the four keys we now\nconsider synonymous with PC gaming. But even then, not everyone played that\nway.\n\n> His brother was playing with a keyboard and trackball, and he was winning.\n\nIn the early days of first-person shooters, Fong says the keymappings were all\nover the place, and even the great Thresh had only just started to play with a\nmouse at all. Imagine him just a few years before, sometime around 1993, as a\nteenager losing a match of Doom against his brother Lyle. Like many Doom\nplayers, Fong used only the keyboard. Without the need to look up or down, it\nwas a natural choice\u2014so much that using a mouse was even considered weird. His\nbrother, however, was playing with a keyboard and trackball, and he was\nwinning. It wasn\u2019t every game\u2014both were excellent players\u2014but Lyle won enough\nthat one summer Fong decided he had to learn to play with a mouse. After that,\nhe was unbeatable.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM pcgamer\n\n\u201cRight after I made that switch, my skill improved exponentially,\u201d says Fong.\n\u201cPretty much, from then on, I never lost.\u201d\n\nIt took some experimentation\u2014including a strange attempt to move with WADX\u2014but\nFong settled on WASD and has been using it since Doom. Did he invent the\nscheme? No, probably not. Others were also gravitating to the left side of the\nkeyboard for Doom at the same time. But without Fong's influence, the default\ncould have ended up different. It might have been EDSF, or stranger\nconfigurations like ZXC to strafe and move backwards, and the right mouse\nbutton to move forwards. Some early shooters bound movement to the arrow keys.\nIn 1994, System Shock used ASDX, while Descent used AZ for forward/reverse and\nQE for banking (if you didn't happen to have a joystick).\n\nFong tells us he even knew a player who used ZXCV to move.\n\n## Comic deals, prizes and latest news\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to take credit for the creation of [WASD],\u201d says\nFong. \u201cI stumbled across it. I\u2019m sure other people started using it as well\njust based on what was comfortable for them. I definitely think I helped\npopularize it with a certain set of gamers, particularly the ones that played\nfirst person shooters.\"\n\nQuake wasn't the first game to introduce mouselook (Marathon came before it),\nbut it was the most influential.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that he did. The very concept of a professional gamer was new at\nthe time, and Fong was well-known on the west coast as the best player around.\nAs Fong\u2019s celebrity grew, the one question everyone asked him was: \u201cWhat\u2019s\nyour config?\u201d His answer could be most readily found in Thresh\u2019s Quake Bible,\nwhich describes the WASD formation as an \u201cinverted T.\u201d And his guide carried\nweight. Even before his success as a Quake player, Fong was a Doom champion,\nand so people imitated him, just as the kids at the basketball court by my\nhouse spend far too much time trying to hit Steph Curry\u2019s 30-foot shots.\n\nThe evidence can be found on old bulletin board systems. In one thread from\n1997, a poster recommends using Q and E to strafe and A and D to turn. Another\nsuggests using the keypad for movement, and someone else says they use A,\nShift, Z, X. It wasn't the case that everyone simply gravitated to the\n'obvious' choice of WASD or ESDF, and in another thread, we see how Thresh's\nperformance in the Quake tournament spread his style. His play was so\nimpressive, the poster looking for his config speculates that it was\nimpossible for him to turn so fast with a mouse.\n\nAnother legend, Quake programmer John Carmack, took note. \u201cEven when I was\nhanging out with Carmack, wherever, at E3, random people would come up and he\nwould hear them asking me what my configuration was,\u201d says Fong. \u201cSo he ended\nup building a Thresh stock config into Quake 2.\u201d\n\nIt was a relief. Not only could Fong sit down at any computer with Quake 2 and\ninstantly load his configuration, every time he got the question, all he had\nto say was \u201ctype exec thresh.cfg.\u201d\n\nHalf-Life was one of the first games to bind WASD to movement by default.\n\nConvenient as it was, Fong doesn\u2019t think the inclusion of his config was the\nmain factor in the rise of WASD, and I\u2019d agree. By the time Quake 2 was out,\nWASD was starting to feel like common knowledge. I used it, and I don\u2019t\nremember hearing Thresh\u2019s name associated with it at the time, though it\u2019s\npossible his configuration entered my consciousness two or three people\nremoved.\n\nAnd yet games, strangely, took a while to catch up. Carmack may have bundled\nThresh\u2019s config with Quake 2, but when it released in 1997 the default\ncontrols were still arrow keys. A year later, though, that changed. If\nThresh's Quake tournament win was WASD's first watershed moment, the second\ncame in 1998 with the release of Half-Life. The Quake and Doom players at\nValve\u2014perhaps influenced directly or indirectly by Carmack, Thresh, and other\ntop Doom and Quake players\u2014included WASD in Half-Life\u2019s default keyboard and\nmouse config, which helped solidify it as the first-person shooter standard.\n\nValve engineer Yahn Bernier checked Half-Life's original config file for us\nand confirmed it included WASD. \"I remember finalizing this file (maybe with\nSteve Bond) during the lead up to shipping HL1 but don\u2019t recall specifics\nabout when WASD was settled on or really why. We probably carried it forward\nfrom Quake1...\" he wrote in an email.\n\nThe same year, and less than a month after Half-Life, Starsiege Tribes also\nmade WASD default. Quake 3 followed suit in 1999, and WASD's popularity grew\neven more. It was also the default binding in 2000's Daikatana, but Half-Life,\nTribes, and Quake 3 probably had a bit more to do with its popularity.\n\nIn a period of a year, Half-Life, Tribes, and Quake 3 set the standard we use\ntoday.\n\n> I always rebind to ESDF.\n>\n> Gabe Newell\n\nThere were still plenty of heretical control schemes in 1999\u2014like System Shock\n2's, which defaulted to WADX (and S for crouch). But WASD had momentum. If it\nwasn\u2019t already ubiquitous by 2004, World of Warcraft defaulting to WASD\ncodified it for millions of PC gamers. Now it\u2019s in RPGs and MOBAs and even\nstrategy games, controlling camera movement over maps.\n\nInterestingly, Valve boss Gabe Newell doesn\u2019t use WASD. \u201cI personally don't\nlike WASD as it takes your hand away from your typing home keys,\u201d he wrote in\nan email to PC Gamer. \u201cI always rebind to ESDF.\u201d Newell's not alone there. Do\na little Googling and you'll find plenty of people arguing that ESDF is the\nmore natural configuration.\n\nMore surprisingly, another Half-Life developer, level designer Dario Casali,\nalso rejects WASD. Instead, he prefers ASXC. \u201cIt feels natural to me, where\nWASD feels odd,\u201d wrote Casali. \u201cBut lots of people scoff at my config.\u201d\n\nWhat would PC gaming be like had EDSF or ASXC been Half-Life\u2019s default? No\noffense intended to Newell or Casali, but I shudder to think of it. ASXC just\nsounds bonkers to me. Newell's fairly commonplace ESDF is more palatable, but\nas Thresh echoes, it feels harder to hit Shift and Control while easier to\nmispress one of the surrounding keys. For me, Thresh, and millions of PC\ngamers, it\u2019s WASD for life.\n\nYou can read more about the history of Quake in our retrospective.\n\nWes Fenlon also contributed to this article.\n\nTyler Wilde\n\nExecutive Editor\n\nTyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like\nZork and Arkanoid on early PCs.
