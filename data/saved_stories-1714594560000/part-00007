WASP-43 b is a Jupiter-sized planet roughly 280 light-years away,\nin the constellation Sextans. The planet orbits its star at a distance of\nabout 1.3 million miles, completing one circuit in about 19.5 hours. Because\nit is so close to its star, WASP-43 b is probably tidally locked: Its rotation\nrate and orbital period are the same, such that one side faces the star at all\ntimes.\n\nCredits: NASA, ESA, CSA, Ralf Crawford (STScI)\n\n## Tidally Locked \u201cHot Jupiter\u201d\n\nWASP-43 b is a \u201chot Jupiter\u201d type of exoplanet: similar in size to Jupiter,\nmade primarily of hydrogen and helium, and much hotter than any of the giant\nplanets in our own solar system. Although its star is smaller and cooler than\nthe Sun, WASP-43 b orbits at a distance of just 1.3 million miles \u2013 less than\n1/25^th the distance between Mercury and the Sun.\n\nWith such a tight orbit, the planet is tidally locked, with one side\ncontinuously illuminated and the other in permanent darkness. Although the\nnightside never receives any direct radiation from the star, strong eastward\nwinds transport heat around from the dayside.\n\nSince its discovery in 2011, WASP-43 b has been observed with numerous\ntelescopes, including NASA\u2019s Hubble and now-retired Spitzer space telescopes.\n\n\u201cWith Hubble, we could clearly see that there is water vapor on the dayside.\nBoth Hubble and Spitzer suggested there might be clouds on the nightside,\u201d\nexplained Taylor Bell, researcher from the Bay Area Environmental Research\nInstitute and lead author of a study published today in Nature Astronomy. \u201cBut\nwe needed more precise measurements from Webb to really begin mapping the\ntemperature, cloud cover, winds, and more detailed atmospheric composition all\nthe way around the planet.\u201d\n\n## Mapping Temperature and Inferring Weather\n\nAlthough WASP-43 b is too small, dim, and close to its star for a telescope to\nsee directly, its short orbital period of just 19.5 hours makes it ideal for\nphase curve spectroscopy, a technique that involves measuring tiny changes in\nbrightness of the star-planet system as the planet orbits the star.\n\nSince the amount of mid-infrared light given off by an object depends largely\non how hot it is, the brightness data captured by Webb can then be used to\ncalculate the planet\u2019s temperature.\n\n## Image: Hot Gas-Giant Exoplanet WASP-43 b (MIRI Phase Curve)\n\nThis phase curve, captured by the MIRI low resolution spectrometer on NASA\u2019s\nJames Webb Space Telescope, shows the change in brightness of the WASP-43\nsystem over time as the planet orbits its star. The system appears brightest\nwhen the hot dayside of the planet is facing the telescope, just before and\nafter it passes behind the star. The system grows dimmer as the planet\ncontinues its orbits and the nightside rotates into view. It brightens again\nafter passing in front of the star as the dayside rotates back into view.\nWASP-43 b is a hot Jupiter roughly 280 light-years away, in the constellation\nSextans.\n\nCredits: Science: Taylor J. Bell (BAERI); Joanna Barstow (Open University);\nMichael Roman (University of Leicester) Graphic Design: NASA, ESA, CSA, Ralf\nCrawford (STScI)\n\nThe team used Webb\u2019s MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) to measure light from the\nWASP-43 system every 10 seconds for more than 24 hours. \u201cBy observing over an\nentire orbit, we were able to calculate the temperature of different sides of\nthe planet as they rotate into view,\u201d explained Bell. \u201cFrom that, we could\nconstruct a rough map of temperature across the planet.\u201d\n\nThe measurements show that the dayside has an average temperature of nearly\n2,300 degrees Fahrenheit (1,250 degrees Celsius) \u2013 hot enough to forge iron.\nMeanwhile, the nightside is significantly cooler at 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit\n(600 degrees Celsius). The data also helps locate the hottest spot on the\nplanet (the \u201chotspot\u201d), which is shifted slightly eastward from the point that\nreceives the most stellar radiation, where the star is highest in the planet\u2019s\nsky. This shift occurs because of supersonic winds, which move heated air\neastward.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can map temperature in this way is a real testament to\nWebb\u2019s sensitivity and stability,\u201d said Michael Roman, a co-author from the\nUniversity of Leicester in the U.K.\n\nTo interpret the map, the team used complex 3D atmospheric models like those\nused to understand weather and climate on Earth. The analysis shows that the\nnightside is probably covered in a thick, high layer of clouds that prevent\nsome of the infrared light from escaping to space. As a result, the nightside\n\u2013 while very hot \u2013 looks dimmer and cooler than it would if there were no\nclouds.\n\n## Image: Hot Gas-Giant Exoplanet WASP-43 b (Temperature Maps)\n\nThis set of maps shows the temperature of the visible side of the hot gas-\ngiant exoplanet WASP-43 b, as it orbits its star. The dayside of the planet is\nvisible just before and after it passes behind the star. The temperatures were\ncalculated based on more than 8,000 brightness measurements of 5- to 12-micron\nmid-infrared light detected from the star-planet system by MIRI (the Mid-\nInfrared Instrument) on NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope. In general, the\nhotter an object is, the more mid-infrared light it gives off.\n\nCredits: Science: Taylor J. Bell (BAERI); Joanna Barstow (Open University);\nMichael Roman (University of Leicester) Graphic Design: NASA, ESA, CSA, Ralf\nCrawford (STScI)\n\n## Animation: Hot Gas-Giant Exoplanet WASP-43 b (Temperature Maps)\n\nGlobal temperature map of the hot gas-giant exoplanet WASP-43 b. This map was\nmade based on the brightness of 5- to 12-micron mid-infrared light detected\nfrom the planet by MIRI (the Mid-Infrared Instrument) on NASA\u2019s James Webb\nSpace Telescope. In general, the hotter an object is, the more mid-infrared\nlight it gives off. Although the planet is far too close to the blinding light\nof its star to see on its own, it is possible to calculate its brightness by\nmeasuring the brightness of the star-planet system as a whole, and then\nsubtracting the amount of light coming from the star (measured when the planet\nis behind the star). Webb was able to measure each side of the planet by\nobserving over an entire 19.5-hour orbit. The planet is tidally locked, which\nmeans that its rotation rate is the same as its orbital period, so different\nsides rotate into view as the planet moves around the star. WASP-43 b has an\naverage temperature of about 2,280\u00b0F (1,250\u00b0C) on the dayside and 1,115\u00b0F\n(600\u00b0C) on the nightside. The temperature map also shows that the nightside is\nprobably covered in thick, high clouds. Clouds prevent some of the infrared\nenergy from escaping to space, making the nightside appear cooler than it\nwould if there were no clouds.\n\nThomas Muller, MPIA\n\n## Missing Methane and High Winds\n\nThe broad spectrum of mid-infrared light captured by Webb also made it\npossible to measure the amount of water vapor (H_2O) and methane (CH_4) around\nthe planet. \u201cWebb has given us an opportunity to figure out exactly which\nmolecules we\u2019re seeing and put some limits on the abundances,\u201d said Joanna\nBarstow, a co-author from the Open University in the U.K.\n\nThe spectra show clear signs of water vapor on the nightside as well as the\ndayside of the planet, providing additional information about how thick the\nclouds are and how high they extend in the atmosphere.\n\nSurprisingly, the data also shows a distinct lack of methane anywhere in the\natmosphere. Although the dayside is too hot for methane to exist (most of the\ncarbon should be in the form of carbon monoxide), methane should be stable and\ndetectable on the cooler nightside.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we don't see methane tells us that WASP-43b must have wind\nspeeds reaching something like 5,000 miles per hour,\u201d explained Barstow. \u201cIf\nwinds move gas around from the dayside to the nightside and back again fast\nenough, there isn\u2019t enough time for the expected chemical reactions to produce\ndetectable amounts of methane on the nightside.\u201d\n\nThe team thinks that because of this wind-driven mixing, the atmospheric\nchemistry is the same all the way around the planet, which wasn\u2019t apparent\nfrom past work with Hubble and Spitzer.\n\nThe MIRI observation of WASP-43 b was conducted as part of the Webb Early\nRelease Science programs, which are providing researchers with a vast set of\nrobust, open-access data for studying a wide array of cosmic phenomena.The\nJames Webb Space Telescope is the world's premier space science observatory.\nWebb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant\nworlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins\nof our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by\nNASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space\nAgency.\n\n## Downloads\n\nRight click the images in this article to open a larger version in a new\ntab/window.
