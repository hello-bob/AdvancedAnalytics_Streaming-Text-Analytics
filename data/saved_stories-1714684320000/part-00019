But he is still registered as a student so that he doesn\u2019t have to\nmove out of his student housing - a flat in the center of Leiden. \u201cI don\u2019t\ntake any lessons,\u201d he told RTL. \u201cJust before I completed my master\u2019s degree, I\nregistered for a second master\u2019s degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cOfficially, you have to leave this home as soon as you graduate. But finding\nanother home is virtually impossible for me,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI am registered for\nsocial housing, but the waiting period in Leiden is nine years. Because I\ncurrently work part-time, I do not earn enough for the normal rental market.\u201d\nHe is looking for a full-time job, and in the meantime continues to pay\ntuition so he can stay in his student housing. \u201cI pay around 2,300 euros per\nyear. This amount on top of my monthly rent is still cheaper than finding a\nrental property in the current market.\u201d\n\nPhoenix shares a student house in Rotterdam with 15 other students. \u201cI\npostponed my master\u2019s thesis for a year to do an internship and gain work\nexperience.\u201d An internship is not part of her studies. \u201cMany jobs require work\nexperience and I didn\u2019t want to gamble on completing my studies without\ngaining experience.\u201d Doing an internship after graduation was not an option.\n\u201cWith an internship allowance, you earn about 400 to 500 euros per month. I\ncannot afford a normal rental property with that.\u201d By delaying her thesis, she\ncould stay registered as a student and keep living in the student's house.\n\nStadswonen, the student housing association in Rotterdam, called it \u201cannoying\u201d\nthat young people are finding loopholes to stay in student housing after their\nstudies. \u201cThis situation pits students looking for housing against the group\nwho won\u2019t move out.\u201d\n\nHowever, the student housing associations understand where these young people\nare coming from. \u201cThe room shortage for students is high,\u201d a spokesperson for\nstudent housing association DUWO told the broadcaster. \u201cBut follow-up housing\nis at least as difficult to find. From the perspective of the problem, I can\nimagine that there is sometimes despair and that people do not know where to\ngo.\u201d\n\nAccording to Stadswonen, the government needs to build more student and social\nhousing. \u201cBut that takes a lot of time,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n## Follow us:\n\n## Latest stories\n\n  * Rotterdam set to ban most polluting vans from January 1\n\n  * Dutch court convicts sisters tied to Islamic State; 3.5 and 2.5 year prison terms\n\n  * PostNL could face \u20ac24 million fine in Belgium for allegations it sidestepped labor laws\n\n  * Graduates stuck staying in student housing because they can\u2019t find affordable home\n\n  * Unilever still earning millions in royalties from Russian subsidiary: report\n\n  * Facebook, Instagram still unable to effectively combat simple phishing scams\n\n## Top stories\n\n  * Unilever still earning millions in royalties from Russian subsidiary: report\n\n  * Experts against EU plan to fight child pornography with software on phone\n\n  * Wilders regularly shares post by racist X account, extending its reach\n\n  * Healthcare workers protest fatal stabbing in mental health clinic with 2-minute strike\n\n  * Dutch whooping cough cases top 7,000 to set new 10-year record\n\n  * Average hourly wage up 7% last year; Most strikes since 1972\n\n\u00a9 2012-2024, NL Times, All rights reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
