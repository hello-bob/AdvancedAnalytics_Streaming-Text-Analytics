here: the long-predicted consumer pullback.\n\nStarbucks announced a surprise drop in same-store sales for its latest\nquarter, sending its shares down 17% on Wednesday. Pizza Hut and KFC also\nreported shrinking same-store sales. And even stalwart McDonald\u2019s said it has\nadopted a \u201cstreet-fighting mentality\u201d to compete for value-minded diners.\n\nFor months, economists have been predicting that consumers would cut back on\ntheir spending in response to higher prices and interest rates. But it\u2019s taken\na while for fast-food chains to see their sales actually shrink, despite\nseveral quarters of warnings to investors that low-income consumers were\nweakening and other diners were trading down from pricier options.\n\nMany restaurant companies also offered other reasons for their weak results\nthis quarter. Starbucks said bad weather dragged its same-store sales lower.\nYum Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell, blamed\nJanuary\u2019s snowstorms and tough comparisons to a strong first quarter last year\nfor its brands\u2019 poor performance.\n\nBut those excuses don\u2019t fully explain the weak quarterly results. Instead, it\nlooks like the competition for a smaller pool of customers has grown fiercer\nas the diners still looking to buy a burger or cold brew become pickier with\ntheir cash.\n\nThe cost of eating out at quick-service restaurants has climbed faster than\nthat of eating at home. Prices for limited-service restaurants rose 5% in\nMarch compared with the year-ago period, while prices for groceries have been\nincreasing more slowly, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\u201cClearly everybody\u2019s fighting for fewer consumers or consumers that are\ncertainly visiting less frequently, and we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019ve got that\nstreet-fighting mentality to win, irregardless of the context around us,\u201d\nMcDonald\u2019s CFO Ian Borden said on the company\u2019s conference call on Tuesday.\n\nOutliers show that customers will still order their favorite foods, even if\nthey\u2019re more expensive than they were a year ago. Wingstop, Wall Street\u2019s\nfavorite restaurant chain, reported its U.S. same-store sales soared 21.6% in\nthe first quarter. Chipotle Mexican Grill, whose customer base is\npredominantly higher income, saw traffic rise 5.4% in its first quarter. And\nRestaurant Brands International\u2019s Popeyes reported same-store sales growth of\n5.7%.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with the consumer is, if they are feeling pressure, they have\na tendency to pull back on more high-frequency [quick-service restaurant]\noccasions,\u201d Wingstop CEO Michael Skipworth told CNBC.\n\nHe added that the average Wingstop customer visits just once a month, using\nthe chain\u2019s chicken sandwich and wings as an opportunity to treat themselves\nrather than a routine that can easily be cut due to budget concerns. Skipworth\nalso said that Wingstop\u2019s low-income consumers are actually returning more\nfrequently these days.\n\nEven so, many companies in the restaurant sector and beyond it have warned\nconsumer pressures could persist. McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski told\nanalysts the spending caution extends worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that in [the first quarter], industry traffic was flat to\ndeclining in the U.S., Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and the U.K.,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nTwo of the chains that struggled in the first quarter cited value as a factor.\nStarbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said occasional customers weren\u2019t buying the\nchain\u2019s coffee because they wanted more variety and value.\n\n\u201cIn this environment, many customers have been more exacting about where and\nhow they choose to spend their money, particularly with stimulus savings\nmostly spent,\u201d Narasimhan said on the company\u2019s Tuesday call.\n\nYum CEO David Gibbs noted that rivals\u2019 value deals for chicken menu items hurt\nKFC\u2019s U.S. sales. But he said the shift to value should benefit Taco Bell,\nwhich accounts for three-quarters of Yum\u2019s domestic operating profit.\n\n\u201cWe know from the industry data that value is more important and that others\nare struggling with value, and Taco Bell is a value leader. You\u2019re seeing some\nlow-income consumers fall off in the industry. We\u2019re not seeing that at Taco\nBell,\u201d he said on Wednesday.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how long it will take fast-food chains\u2019 sales to bounce back,\nalthough executives provided optimistic timelines and plans to get sales back\non track. For example, Yum said its first quarter will be the weakest of the\nyear.\n\nFor its part, McDonald\u2019s plans to create a nationwide value menu that will\nappeal to thrifty customers. But the burger giant could face pushback from its\nfranchisees, who have become more outspoken in recent years. While deals drive\nsales, they pressure operators\u2019 profits, particularly in markets where it is\nalready expensive to operate.\n\nStill, losing ground to the competition could motivate McDonald\u2019s franchisees.\nThis marks the second consecutive quarter that Burger King reported stronger\nU.S. same-store sales growth than McDonald\u2019s. The Restaurant Brands chain has\nbeen in turnaround mode over the last two years and spending heavily on\nadvertising.\n\nStarbucks is also betting on deals. The coffee chain is gearing up to release\nan upgrade of its app that allows all customers \u2014 not just loyalty members \u2013\nto order, pay and get discounts. Narasimhan also touted the success of its new\nlavender drink line that launched in March, although business was still\nsluggish in April.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Wednesday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, 3M, Pinterest, AMD, Meta and more\n  * Apple reports earnings Thursday.
