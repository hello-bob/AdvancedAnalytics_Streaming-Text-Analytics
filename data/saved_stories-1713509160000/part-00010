Sinai Medical Center\nhospital. ]\n\nGetty | Jeffrey Greenberg/\n\n#### reader comments\n\n34\n\nSince 2021, federal law has required hospitals to publicly post their prices,\nallowing Americans to easily anticipate costs and shop around for affordable\ncare\u2014as they would for any other marketed service or product. But hospitals\nhave mostly failed miserably at complying with the law.\n\nA 2023 KFF analysis on compliance found that the pricing information hospitals\nprovided is \"messy, inconsistent, and confusing, making it challenging, if not\nimpossible, for patients or researchers to use them for their intended\npurpose.\" A February 2024 report from the nonprofit organization Patient\nRights Advocate found that only 35 percent of 2,000 US hospitals surveyed were\nin full compliance with the 2021 rule.\n\nBut even if hospitals dramatically improved their price transparency, it\nlikely wouldn't help when patients need emergency trauma care. After an\nunexpected, major injury, people are sent to the closest hospital and aren't\nlikely to be shopping around for the best price from the back of an ambulance.\nIf they did, though, they might also need to be treated for shock.\n\nAccording to a study published Wednesday in JAMA Surgery, hospitals around the\ncountry charge wildly different prices for trauma care. Prices for the same\ncare can be up to 16-fold different between hospitals, and cash prices are\nsometimes significantly cheaper than the negotiated prices that insurance\ncompanies pay.\n\n\"The findings illustrate substantial, and often irrational, variations\" in\ntrauma pricing, according to the study authors\u2014a group of researchers at Johns\nHopkins and the University of California, San Francisco. They suggest that\n\"price variations cannot be explained by trauma severity alone.\"\n\nFor the study, they obtained data on \"trauma activation fees\" (TAFs) from\nhospitals across the US. TAFS were created in 2002 to be standardized billing\ncodes that would help recuperate readiness costs for trauma care. Those\noverhead costs are what hospitals pay to maintain readiness to provide\nemergency trauma care around the clock, including having operating rooms\nconstantly ready, as well as sufficient staffing, equipment, and supplies,\nlike blood products. TAFS are billed with four codes corresponding to trauma\nresponse levels (I through IV), which are based on standardized criterion of\ninjury severity. These fees are in addition to billing for a patient's actual\nmedical care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Wide variation\n\nThe researchers pulled TAF data from a platform that aggregates hospital-\ndisclosed pricing data called Torquise Health. From there, they obtained 3,093\nunique TAF observations across 761 unique hospitals in 49 states. They broke\nout TAF fees by different types of trauma response levels as well as types of\nprices: list prices, cash prices often paid by the uninsured, and negotiated\nprices paid to insurers.\n\nThe prices varied dramatically for each trauma level and pricing type. For\ninstance, for the most severe trauma response level (level I), the median TAF\nlist price was $6,607, while the median negotiated price was $3,431, and the\nmedian cash price was $2,663. For the list prices, the span between the 10^th\npercentile prices and the 90^th percentile prices went from a low of $1,650 up\nto 11 times more than that: $18,500. Looking across the percentiles for the\nnegotiated prices, costs ranged from $900 to 11,661, 13 times more. And the\ncash prices ranged from $660 to $8,190, 12 times more.\n\nThe largest spread was seen in the cash prices for trauma response level II\nTAFs. There, the median cash price was $2,630, but the span between the 10^th\nand 90^th percentiles was $768 to $12,140, which is 16 times more.\n\nIn all the data, cash prices were often lower than the negotiated prices. This\nis good for uninsured patients who may be offered cash prices, but it's not\ngreat for the insured. \"One could argue that insured patients who are already\npaying insurance premiums should not pay more than cash prices,\" the authors\nwrote.\n\nOverall, the pricing and lack of transparency is a problem that requires\nintervention, the authors conclude. \"The unexpected and pressing nature of\ntrauma means patients are sent to the closest appropriate hospital and unable\nto compare prices as they do with nonemergency and shoppable medical\nservices,\" the authors wrote. Moreover, the people who will suffer the most\nfrom these wide-swinging prices are the uninsured and most financially\nvulnerable patients, they add.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n34\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
