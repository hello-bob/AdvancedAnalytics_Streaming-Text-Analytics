The company\nalso announced its first dividend, of $0.20 per share, and said the payout\nwould become quarterly.\n\nGoogle fires 28 staff after protest against firm\u2019s contract with Israeli\ngovernment\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cOur results in the first quarter reflect strong performance from Search,\nYouTube and Cloud. We are well under way with our Gemini era and there\u2019s great\nmomentum across the company,\u201d Pichai said in a press release.\n\nRuth Porat, Alphabet CFO, said revenue from ads on Google Search as well as\nrevenue from Google Cloud fuelled overall positive growth. Revenue from\nYouTube and Google Cloud exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations, with Cloud\u2019s\noperating income quadrupling to $900m. Traffic acquisition costs \u2013 one of\nAlphabet\u2019s main expenses \u2013 rose as well, increasing by 10%. Like Google, Meta\nissued its first-ever dividend in February.\n\n\u201cAlphabet\u2019s better-than-expected quarter was buoyed by strong search and\nYouTube ad revenue, signaling that uncertainty about how to monetise\nconversational search and brand media\u2019s measurement challenges aren\u2019t yet\nimpacting Alphabet\u2019s bottom line,\u201d said Nikhil Lai, a senior analyst at\nForrester Research.\n\nInternal and external turmoil have rocked Google in recent weeks. The earnings\nreport comes amid protests by employees over Google Cloud\u2019s contract with the\nIsraeli government that led to 48 workers being fired. An antitrust decision\nover its business practices and role in the digital ad market also looms\nlarge. The company botched the rollout of its new Gemini AI tools in February,\nleading to a steep loss in stock value, which the tech giant seems to have\nshaken off.\n\nLong regarded as a workplace full of jobs that paid well and were difficult to\nlose, Google laid off 1,000 workers in January as it continues to shift its\nresources to generative artificial intelligence projects. Alphabet\u2019s stock has\ncontinued to rise during this period, however, and reached all-time highs this\nyear.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock price has continued to rise even as it awaits judgment in\na landmark antitrust trial that began last year, in which the Department of\nJustice accused Google of illegally monopolizing internet search and the\ndigital ad market. During a weeks-long trial, Google defended its business\npractices and argued that its search platform was simply a superior product to\nits competitors. The verdict is expected at some point this year and it is\nunclear what punitive measures Google may incur if it is found guilty.\n\nGoogle is facing a number of other legal challenges, including a $2.3bn\nlawsuit from European media companies over its digital advertising practices.\nThe European Commission levied a $2.7bn antitrust fine against Google that the\ncompany is appealing after a court upheld the penalty in January.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock dipped earlier this year due to investor fears over a\nhaphazard and hasty rollout of its Gemini AI tools, leading to a multibillion-\ndollar sell off and widespread criticism. Pichai was put on the defensive in\nFebruary after Gemini\u2019s image generator created ahistorical images that\nincluded people of color as German second world war soldiers, resulting in the\ncompany suspending public access to the tool.\n\nIn recent weeks, Google has also faced scrutiny and protests over its $1.2bn\ncontract with the Israeli government to provide cloud computing services.\nGoogle fired four dozen workers for protesting the program, with demonstrators\naccusing Google of being complicit in Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. Employees held a\nsit-in at Google\u2019s offices in Sunnyvale and New York offices in protest of the\nprogram, resulting in arrests and the terminations.\n\nPichai addressed the firings in an email last week, stating that Google was\nnot the place to \u201cfight over disruptive issues or debate politics\u201d. He also\nannounced that some of Google\u2019s divisions would go through a restructuring.\nGoogle announced additional cuts to its workforce around the same time, laying\noff an unspecified number of people.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Technology\n  * Google\n  * Alphabet\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * Quarterly results\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
