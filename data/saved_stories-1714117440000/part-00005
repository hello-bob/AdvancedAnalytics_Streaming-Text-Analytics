Yes. Exactly. Modern office workers are\noften starved for ambition, adventure, and even discomfort. This is why\nthere's an endless line of recruits willing to sign up to work for leaders\nlike Musk, despite his reputation for being an erratic hard ass. The ambition\nis worth it. Because real ambition is rare.\n\nIt's the lack of ambition that fuels the malaise of a bullshit job. Work so\naspirationally underwhelming that it's possible to coast and imagine how the\nworld wouldn't be an iota different if the work wasn't done. A perfect recipe\nfor existential dread and despair.\n\nBut while the stereotype of ambition is indeed someone like Elon Musk (or\nSteve Jobs, before that), I don't think you literally need to aim for Mars to\nstir the heart of sailors. Nor do I think you need to be as abrasive or\ndemanding, as the stereotype implies. That's the balance we've been trying to\nfind at 37signals since its inception: The vision of a calm company compatible\nwith ambition.\n\nIt's not always easy. If you talk for long enough about the fact that 40 hours\na week ought to be enough, that vacations should be free of homing beacons,\nand how it literally doesn't have to be crazy at work, people inside and out\nyour company might soon think that's indeed all there is. That the ultimate\ngoal of the company is to provide a cush and coasting existence. But that's\nnot why I get out of bed in the morning.\n\nThe aspiration of a calm company is to me exactly the opposite. To prove how\nmuch faster and further you can go if you embrace constraints, stay small, and\ntrust skilled professionals to get the job done. That is, the calm company is\na method for getting where we really want to go. It's not a destination in and\nof itself.\n\nIn fact, I'd rather work in place where it was crazy all the time, if we're\ntrying to get somewhere, than I'd work somewhere perfectly calm that's just\nspinning the wheels. But the point is that I don't think these objectives are\nin opposition. Being ambitious and calm is like being smooth and fast. Big,\nerratic, dramatic movements might feel like they're getting you somewhere, but\nthe stop watch usually reveals the opposite.\n\nBut what is ambition, exactly? To me, it's a leap of faith. A belief in the\npossibility of success without all the evidence to justify it a priori. A\ntrust that whatever challenges we'll face between here and there, we'll be\nable to figure them out. It's a confidence in the strength of human ingenuity.\nAnd a bet that it takes a goal just beyond the reach of the plausible to get\nthe best out of us all.\n\nThat ambition can be applied to all aspects of a project. The timeline, the\npeople, the problem, the tech. To tickle our sense of adventure, some of it\nhas to be daring and bold. Maybe it's not enough people, not enough time, new\ntech, novel problems. Whatever it is, there must be an x factor, an unknown.\nIf we can quantify it all before we even begin, the ambition disappears.\n\nAnd in that lack of certainly lies the discomfort, lies the leap. Betting on\nyour ability to figure it out means taking a risk. Maybe you won't figure it\nout! Maybe we really didn't have enough people! Maybe we'll fail. But it's\nexactly the possibility of failure that gives the effort its meaning and its\nvalue.\n\nIn the lore of Steve Jobs, you'll find plenty of anecdotes from people who\nreally didn't care for how he treated them or their colleagues at times, but\nwho still credit the projects they worked on for him at Apple as the most\nmeaningful ones of their career. I'm sure the same is true with Musk. These\nencapsulate the paradox that, psychologically speaking, I don't think most\npeople know what makes them fulfilled at work. (But it isn't the ping pong or\nthe free massage.)\n\nWithout a dash of the unpredictable, we all wither away. The chase for\nsecurity and surety only works as a thrill if you never truly get there. Our\ncompetency only grows when we stretch it slightly beyond its breaking point\nfrom time to time.\n\nSo keep calm, yes, but for all that is holy, carry on by being ambitious.\n\nAbout David Heinemeier Hansson\n\nMade Basecamp and HEY for the underdogs as co-owner and CTO of 37signals.\nCreated Ruby on Rails.
