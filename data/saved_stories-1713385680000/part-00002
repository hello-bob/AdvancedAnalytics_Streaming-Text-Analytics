Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Preparing for the DNA computation paradigm shift\n\nNews\n\nBy Hyunjun Park\n\npublished 9 hours ago\n\nParadigm shift in computing architecture\n\nImage Credit: Shutterstock (Image credit: Everything Possible / Shutterstock)\n\nIn \u201cThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\u201d physicist and philosopher Thomas\nKuhn introduced the concept of a paradigm shift, which he used to describe a\nfundamental change in the basic framework of thinking in natural sciences.\nThroughout history, however, such paradigm shifts have occurred not just in\nnatural sciences but across the entire spectrum of human endeavor, providing\nsolutions to problems that appeared to be insurmountable under the old\nparadigm.\n\nThe field of data storage and computation is a case in point. As the demand\nfor creation, retention, and data computation only ever increased with time,\nthe current computing paradigm requires enterprises to build data continuously\ncenters the size of football fields and nuclear power plants to power them.\nHere, the lack of resources and capabilities to build these things quickly\nenough indefinitely is not as important as the fact that the current computing\nparadigm is not compatible with a scalable solution.\n\nDNA-based data storage and computation represents a break from the old\nframework and shows a scalable, sustainable path forward. TechRadar reported\non one company, Biomemory, that recently announced an offering for consumers\nto have messages stored in DNA and shipped to them on a credit card-sized\ncard. The DNA Data Storage Alliance recently announced specifications on\nrecommended approaches to store data in DNA.\n\nHyunjun Park\n\nCEO and co-founder, CATALOG.\n\n## The growing cost of AI\n\nAI delivers innovation at a rate and pace the world has never experienced but\ncomes at a substantial cost. AI generates volumes of data, and machine\nlearning models are expensive to train and maintain.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\nLast summer, it was reported that it costs more than $700 million daily to\nkeep OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT up and running. Recently, TechRadar reported that Sam\nAltman is seeking up to a whopping $7 trillion to build a facility to boost\nthe industry\u2019s ability to produce microprocessors to process AI workloads.\n\nThese exorbitant costs point to a limitation of the current computation\nparadigm.\n\nWhile the advent of the microprocessor and its exponential development over\nthe decades is largely responsible for the world as we know it today, the\nbasic von Neumann architecture surrounding the microprocessor hasn\u2019t changed\nmuch since World War II. And it is this architecture, this computing paradigm,\nthat is increasingly becoming incompatible with the ever-increasing demand for\ndata storage and computation.\n\n## Are you a pro?

Scientists have mimicked that and used synthetic DNA to store and\ncompute digital data in laboratory settings.\n\nCompared to existing microprocessor technologies, which process workloads\nserially, a significant benefit of DNA Computation platforms is the ability to\nuse enzymes or DNA probes to compute in a massively parallel fashion.\n\nImagine mixing a container of blue liquid with a container of red liquid. The\nresult of this computation \u2013a new color\u2014appears not by serially mixing each\ncolor molecule one at a time but by mixing all of them together in parallel.\nJust as in this thought experiment, computation is performed in a massively\nparallel manner directly on the data, without having to travel to memory or\nprocessor to be processed.\n\n## Potential DNA computation application areas\n\nDNA-based computation has the potential to allow the generation of insights\nfrom data sets that are not currently possible with existing computers. Early\napplication areas include search, signal processing, and machine learning.\n\nOne practical example is satellite imagery of the entire surface of the Earth.\nWe\u2019ll soon have decades\u2019 worth of images taken every second of every day.\nGiven the amount of data, a simple search using conventional technology could\nbecome prohibitively expensive, but with DNA, it could be as simple as a COVID\ntest.\n\nOther expected areas of early application are artificial intelligence, machine\nlearning, data analytics, and secure computing. In addition, initial use cases\nare expected to include fraud detection in financial services, image\nprocessing for defect discovery in manufacturing, and digital signal\nprocessing in the energy sector.\n\nBorrowing heavily from natural processes and cutting-edge synthetic biology\ntools, in addition to parallelization, automated and scalable DNA-based\ncomputation platforms are divorced from the limitations of traditional\nelectronic systems. They leverage low energy, low physical footprint, and\nsecure computing.\n\nWe've listed the best business cloud storage.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel\nwhere we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry\ntoday.
