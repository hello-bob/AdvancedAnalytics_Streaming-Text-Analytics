Lewis\n\nThe first time I remember really enjoying writing something (and finishing it)\nwas for my high school English class. Our teacher, Mr. Page, was a British\ncool music connoisseur who happened to also teach AP English. One of our\nassignments was simply to choose a song we liked and write an essay analyzing\nit. I picked a song and started listening to it on repeat, unlocking a small\nnew insight each time. I got a 97 or 98 on the paper, but I hadn\u2019t been\nworried because I liked what I wrote.\n\nI\u2019ve had a few careers since then, and somehow, I\u2019ve found myself writing in\nsome capacity in each of them. When I dabbled in acting, I wanted to write\nscripts and lyrics for original scores. In medicine, it was academic papers\nand irreverent op-eds. Now in this tech-ish world, I find myself writing this\nblog.\n\nI didn\u2019t see the pattern until recently, but once I did, examples kept\nappearing. So I\u2019ve started calling this archetype the writer-builder \u2014 someone\nwho both writes and builds in a given domain (or perhaps whichever domain\nthey\u2019re in for now). The writer-builder hyphenate is perhaps a sub-archetype\nof the aspiring renaissance man.1\n\nWriting increases your rate of revelation. This is true irrespective of the\nsubject because writing is a process of reflection, assertion, and iteration.\nWriting clarifies your own ideas. Writing begets new ideas too. Writing lets\nyou explore ideas in depth even if you won\u2019t have time to act on them all.\nWriting shows people how you think and lets them decide if they agree, if they\nrespect you, and if maybe you\u2019re the kind of person they\u2019d want to ask out for\ncoffee or spend years working with.\n\nYou don\u2019t write something in one shot and hit publish. And you don\u2019t build one\nversion of something and call it done. Doing either well calls for copious\namounts of reflection and revision too. So while not everyone has the interest\nor aptitude to embody the writer-builder archetype, those who do have a\ndistinctive advantage \u2014 they can unlock a virtuous cycle of revelation that\nlevels up both.2\n\nTo receive new posts and support my words, consider becoming a subscriber.\n\nYou can\u2019t talk about writer-builders and tech and not mention Paul Graham. He\nmight be known for having been a founder, then starting Y Combinator, and more\nrecently as a writer, but his affinity for the latter precedes the rest.3 And\nI find this to be true for many writer-builders \u2014 that they dabbled as writers\nlong before they became known in any builder domain.\n\nPaul Graham\u2019s writing is notable in a few ways. First, it\u2019s stylistically\nsimple \u2014 a word he monopolizes to describe good writing. Second, his writing\nincreasingly covers universal themes, e.g. how to do good work. And third, it\nhas arguably transcended mainstream tech to reach other creative circles\n(perhaps in the way that Rick Rubin\u2019s messages have transcended music, albeit\nmore niche).\n\nThere are a half-dozen more writer-founders that could be deemed popular. Marc\nAndreessen. Naval Ravikant. Patrick Collison. The more impressive the company\nthey\u2019ve built, the more it feeds back into the substance and the aura around\ntheir writing.4 The notable writer-founder (or ex-founder) is rare because\nit\u2019s hard enough to be known for one thing, let alone be notable for two.5\n\nWe\u2019re going to see more crossovers between different kinds of writing and\nbuilding.\n\n\u2018Writing\u2019 has historically been gatekept and unstable, but there are more ways\nto share and succeed independently now. These crossovers and oscillations\nbetween mostly-writing and mostly-building also reflect an increasing openness\nto career fluidity and the waning of the stability and status of staying in\none \u201clane.\u201d\n\nThis fluidity also embodies the extended wave of creatorization \u2014 of\neverything and everyone. With writing specifically, I suspect Substack\u2019s\nmainstream emergence and the normalization of para-professional blogs are\ncontributing factors.6 And almost irrespective of your goal, the concept of\nputting work out into the public is normal, if not universally encouraged now.\nBuilding any kind of audience is building distribution \u2014 and you always want\ndistribution.78\n\nYet another reason we\u2019re seeing (and will see) more writer-builders is that\nwriting is still a niche and underappreciated yet powerful medium.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen people rushing to build audiences on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok,\nYouTube, etc., and this won\u2019t stop. But people are slowly realizing that all\nthe successful creators in these mediums want to funnel their audiences to\nmore private and owned spaces (and often to collect their e-mail addresses and\nphone numbers in service of this). A good chunk of these successful creators\nare starting to write and curate in text-form (and try their hand at building\nproducts too).9\n\nNot only that, but each medium requires a unique style of effort and creator-\nfit. There are enough people who don\u2019t want to be in front of a camera or get\ninto video production and editing yet have thoughts and ideas to share. And\nthe more you see notable writer-builders like Paul Graham, the more you think\nit\u2019s possible for there to be more of them.\n\nThe aspiration to be a prolific writer-builder, in any domain, is on the rise.\n\nSo which comes first \u2014 the writer or builder?\n\nYou can never escape the chicken-or-egg question. But it\u2019s not so much a\nquestion of which one has to come first, but which is best when first.\nBuilding first and then writing is like lighting a match from a lit candle.\nWriting before you\u2019ve built much can be like trying to start a fire by rubbing\ntwo sticks together. Building doesn\u2019t have to come first, but it\u2019s easier if\nit does.10\n\nWrite about what you build. Build what you write about. But the quality bar is\nhigh. Each needs to stand on its own. Because in this increasingly noisy\nworld, only the best will break through.\n\nP.S. Which writer-builders do you admire? Which emerging writer-builders\nshould be on everyone\u2019s radar? If this resonates, leave a \u2661 at the altar of\nthe Substack algorithm gods.\n\nShare\n\n1\n\nThe artistic archetype I respect the most \u2014 also a kind of renaissance man \u2014\nis the prolific writer-director. Christopher Nolan, Sofia Coppola, Quentin\nTarantino, Hayao Miyazaki, Richard Linklater. A writer-director is a kind of\nwriter-builder, and the most prolific writer-directors are the visionary\nfounders of the cinematic world.\n\n2\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean every builder should rush to write and every writer should\nrush to build. You need affinity, aptitude, and energy for it. And does\nwriting have to be the medium of reflection? No, but writing is special as\nit\u2019s rooted in simplicity, clarity, and a core message.\n\n3\n\n\u201cWhen I finished grad school in computer science I went to art school to study\npainting. A lot of people seemed surprised that someone interested in\ncomputers would also be interested in painting ... What hackers and painters\nhave in common is that they're both makers. Along with composers, architects,\nand writers, what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things.\nThey're not doing research per se, though if in the course of trying to make\ngood things they discover some new technique, so much the better.\u201d (link to\nessay, Hackers & Painters)\n\n4\n\nEven when the companies aren\u2019t as massive (yet), founders building and writing\nin public creates a flywheel. Ryan Hoover blogged a lot before building\nProductHunt and swears by its benefits. Sahil Lavingia\u2019s viral essays captured\nlessons from building Gumroad.\n\n5\n\nThere are a host of writer-builders adjacent to writer-founders too. Writer-\noperators are functional specialists who often open source playbooks. Some\nbecome analysts of careers, companies, and people in niche categories of tech.\nFor the writer-investor (perhaps less of a traditional builder), the job is\nbeing active in the right conversations, so it helps to publish thoughts into\nthe public domain.\n\n6\n\nThere are near-daily business newsletter writers \u2014 After School covers gen Z\ntrends, FeedMe covers culture from a business lens. Some people start out\nbuilding and move into writing. Ava, who writes the popular largely-personal\nSubstack Bookbear, is a tech builder turned mostly-writer. Others start out\nstrictly writing and move into building.\n\n7\n\nThe other thing is that writers don\u2019t like talking about distribution. Whether\nyou\u2019re a writer or builder or both, how do people find your work? There are no\nshortcuts here. No matter which one you start with, you have to organically\nbuild your own distribution. It\u2019s just that the thing you do second gets to\ntake advantage of the first.\n\n8\n\nWe\u2019re seeing the opposite too: writer James Clear just entered the builder\nworld, releasing Atoms, a paid mobile app, an extension of his Atomic Habits\nbrand.\n\n9\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that writers won\u2019t crossover into the other mediums, because\nmany of them will. The relative strengths of video, especially video\npodcasting and vlogging, are a big draw.\n\n10\n\nThe caveat: \u201cbuilding\u201d can of course have a range of meanings, from uniquely\nsubstantive life experience to great products and companies.\n\n### Subscribe to Working Theorys\n\nBy Anu \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nsense-making, twice a week\n\n18 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 Restacks\n\n18\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Writer-Builders\n\nwww.workingtheorys.com\n\n10\n\nShare\n\n10 Comments\n\nJohn Brennick2 hrs agoLiked by AnuWow, LOVE the concept of writer-builder!\nThank you.Expand full commentLike (4)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Anu\n\nThe Management ConsultantConsulting Intel2 hrs agoLiked by AnuThe real\nquestion is: what song was it that you analyzed for Mr Page? \ud83d\ude03Expand full\ncommentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n3 replies by Anu and others\n\n8 more comments...\n\nWhat I Learned at Clubhouse \ud83d\udcd3\n\nTheory #6\n\nJul 19, 2022 \u2022\n\nAnu\n\n62\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What I Learned at Clubhouse \ud83d\udcd3\n\nwww.workingtheorys.com\n\n1\n\nCompanionship Content is King\n\nTheory #29 | Why short-form video has a ceiling & how companionship content escapes it.\n\nJan 31 \u2022\n\nAnu\n\n56\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Companionship Content is King\n\nwww.workingtheorys.com\n\n9\n\nLove the Mission or Love the Game\n\nTheory #30 | Are you a Type I or Type II entrepreneur?\n\nFeb 12 \u2022\n\nAnu\n\n50\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Love the Mission or Love the Game\n\nwww.workingtheorys.com\n\n7\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Anu Atluru\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
