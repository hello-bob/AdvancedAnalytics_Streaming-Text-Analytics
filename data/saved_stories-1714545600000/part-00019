Investigators are\nwarning of a rise in brazen schemes to drain bank accounts that involve\nsending couriers in person to collect cash or gold from victims.\n\n\"It can be a devastating impact to older Americans who lack the ability to go\nout and make money,\" said Deputy Assistant Director James Barnacle of the\nFBI's Criminal Investigative Division. \"People lose all their money. Some\npeople become destitute.\"\n\nThe FBI received more than 100,000 complaints by victims of scams over the age\nof 60 last year, with nearly 6,000 people losing more than $100,000. It\nfollows a sharp rise in reported losses by older Americans in the two years\nafter the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, when people were stuck at home and easier\nfor scammers to reach over the phone.\n\nBarnacle said investigators are seeing organized, transnational criminal\nenterprises targeting older Americans through a variety of schemes, like\nromance scams and investment frauds.\n\nThe most commonly reported fraud among older adults last year was tech support\nscams, in which criminals pose over the phone as technical or customer service\nrepresentatives. In one such scam authorities say is rising in popularity,\ncriminals impersonate technology, banking and government officials to convince\nvictims that foreign hackers have infiltrated their bank accounts and instruct\nthem that to protect their money they should move it to a new account \u2014 one\nsecretly controlled by the scammers.\n\nFederal investigators saw an uptick between May and December of scammers using\nlive couriers to take money from victims duped into believing their accounts\nhad been compromised, according to the FBI. In those cases, scammers tell\nvictims that their bank accounts have been hacked and that they need to\nliquidate their assets into cash or buy gold or other precious metals to\nprotect their funds. Then the fraudsters arrange for a courier to pick it up\nin person.\n\n\"A lot of the the fraud schemes are asking victims to send money via a wire\ntransfer, or a cryptocurrency transfer. When the victim is reluctant to do\nthat, they're given an alternative,\" Barnacle said. \"And so the bad guy will\nuse courier services.\"\n\nEarlier this month, an 81-year-old Ohio man fatally shot an Uber driver he\nthought was trying to rob him after receiving scam phone calls, according to\nauthorities.\n\nThe man had been receiving calls from someone pretending to be an officer from\nthe local court who demanded money. The Uber driver had been told to retrieve\na package from the man's home, a request authorities say was possibly made by\nthe same scam caller or an accomplice.\n\nThe staggering losses to older Americans are likely an undercount. Only about\nhalf of the more than 880,000 complaints reported to the FBI's Internet Crime\nCompliance Center last year included information on the age of the victim.\n\n## More US Stories\n\n  * #### Biden administration takes step to make marijuana use a less serious crime\n\n  * #### Democrats say they will save Speaker Mike Johnson's job if Republicans try to oust him\n\n  * #### Judge holds Trump in contempt of court for violating gag order\n\n  * #### FBI: Scammers stole more than $3.4 billion from older Americans last year\n\n  * #### Survey: US consumer confidence at lowest level since 2022\n\n  * #### All About America\n\n## The Day in Photos\n\n  * #### April 30, 2024\n\nBack to top\n\n  * Follow Us\n\n  * United States\n\n    * US News\n    * Immigration\n    * All About America\n    * Silicon Valley & Technology\n\n  * World\n\n    * Africa\n    * The Americas\n    * East Asia Pacific\n    * Europe\n    * Middle East\n    * South & Central Asia\n\n  * Sections\n\n    * VOA Programs\n    * Special projects\n    * Day in Photos\n    * Press Freedom\n    * Refugees\n    * VOA News on Iran\n    * VOA News on China\n    * Arts & Culture\n    * Economy & Business\n    * Health\n    * Extremism Watch\n    * Student Union\n    * VOA Connect\n    * 52 Documentary\n    * Videos\n\n  * More From VOA\n\n    * VOAAfrica.com Programs\n    * VOA Learning English\n    * Polygraph.info\n    * Editorials\n    * Satellite schedule\n\n  * About this site\n\n    * Terms of Use & Privacy Notice\n    * About VOA\n    * Get VOA+\n    * VOA Around the World\n    * Contact VOA\n    * Media Relations\n    * Usage Requests\n    * VOA Pronunciation Guide\n\nXS\n\nSM\n\nMD\n\nLG\n\n", "frontpage": true}
