Then it all came crashing down.\n\nAmid Tulsa's booming Airbnb market, Dani Widell claimed to have more listings\nthan anyone. Dominic Bugatto for BI\n\nDan Latu\n\n2024-04-21T09:31:01Z\n\nFacebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link\n\nRead in app\n\nHOMEPAGE\n\nNewsletters\n\nLog in\n\nSubscribe\n\nOn a mild Tuesday evening in early 2022, some 150 people packed into the VFW\nhall in Tulsa to hear the Queen of Airbnb make her pitch.\n\nPost-pandemic, with interest rates low and travel once again booming, Airbnb\nlistings had been popping up all over the city. For average investors, the\nback-of-the-napkin math was irresistible. In Tulsa, you could buy a suburban-\nstyle home for less than $75,000 and rent it out for $117 a night. If you\nbooked three-quarters of each month \u2014 as hosts were averaging at the time \u2014\nyou could bring in as much as $30,000 a year.\n\nTulsa had the feel of a rental gold rush. And Dani Widell was the city's self-\nstyled Queen of Airbnb.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA small-time real-estate investor turned Airbnb property manager, Widell\nclaimed to be nearing a total of 100 listings, more than anyone else in Tulsa.\nTax returns would later show that Widell Renovations was generating over $1\nmillion in annual bookings. She was a fixture on Facebook, where she doled out\nadvice in short-term-rental groups and offered her services to turn homes into\ncash machines. She promised to give properties the look of a boutique hotel,\nhandle the guests, and ensure there were fresh sheets and plentiful supplies\nof toilet paper. Investors could set it and forget it.\n\nNow, after she made her pitch at the VFW hall, attendees clamored around\nWidell, eager to have her manage their Airbnb rentals. \"At the time, the\nfeeling was, if you weren't already in short-term rentals, it was too late,\"\nrecalled Kathy Portley, the president of the Tulsa Real Estate Investors\nAssociation, which sponsored the event.\n\nFor Widell, though, it was already too late. Within a year, her Airbnb empire\nhad come crashing down. Hosts weren't receiving their rent. Employees weren't\nbeing paid. Creditors came knocking. Her marriage had imploded. The sudden\ncollapse \u2014 and the web of accusations that accompanied it \u2014 offer a cautionary\ntale of what comes from putting too much faith in a volatile market, an\nuntested guru, and the promise of easy money. The reign of the Airbnb Queen of\nTulsa was over \u2014 and her subjects were left to pick up the pieces.\n\nAirbnb was one of the great turnaround stories of the pandemic.\n\nIn the early months of 2020, as the world shut down, the company lost nearly\n80% of its business, laid off 1,900 employees, and watched its valuation slip\nfrom $31 billion to $18 billion. Experts mused that the pandemic might have\npermanently turned travelers off from the idea of home-sharing.\n\nInstead, as lockdowns lifted and remote work became the new normal, Americans\ndisplayed an unprecedented itch to travel \u2014 assuming it could be done at a\nsafe distance. Many found the space and security they were after in Airbnb.\nWhen the company went public at the end of 2020, it was the biggest IPO of the\nyear. On the first day of trading, Airbnb's stock price doubled. As bookings\nsoared, first-time real-estate investors rushed to get in on the action,\ntransforming residential homes into short-term rentals. Before long, 260,000\nnew Airbnb and Vrbo listings had been added nationwide, according to the\nanalytics firm AirDNA.\n\nTulsa, a city of 400,000 long known as the \"oil capital of the world,\" looked\nto be a fertile ground for Airbnb. The city, with its Art Deco downtown and\nspacious Craftsman bungalows, was already a destination for homebuyers in\nsearch of affordability, a lively arts scene, and easy access to outdoor\nactivities. What's more, Tulsa was actively courting remote workers, offering\n$10,000 to anyone willing to relocate to the city. Savvy investors were making\nhealthy profits buying up homes and flipping them to the sudden influx of out-\nof-staters.\n\n\"I was not sleeping at that time,\" Emily Burke, an Airbnb manager in Tulsa,\nsaid. \"I was up at two, three in the morning,\" taking phone calls and looking\nover properties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWidell placed herself at the center of the boom. A former accountant who\ngraduated from Oklahoma State University, she exuded polish and confidence. In\n2017, she graced the cover of Tulsa People magazine, showing off the Brady\nHeights home she shared with her husband, Will Widell, a federal public\ndefender. They'd bought it after flipping another house up the street, and\nWidell had spent hundreds of hours \"salvaging every bit of the original\ncraftsmanship\" while infusing it with \"21st-century functionality.\"\n\nNow, as the Airbnb market accelerated, a rift opened between the couple: Will,\nwho considers himself thrifty and risk-averse, wanted to cash out and retire,\nwhile Widell was consumed by the new opportunity to grow their business. \"The\nmore difficult the thing was, the more possibility it could fail, that's where\nshe seemed to thrive,\" Will said. \"She wasn't going to be happy if she was\ndoing a project that was not risky.\" (Widell declined to be interviewed for\nthis story.)\n\nWidell started channeling her house-flipping expertise into managing short-\nterm rentals. For a fee of a few thousand dollars, she would stage an Airbnb\nunit in tasteful shades of beige, hang some abstract art, and install remote\nlocks. For a 25% cut, she would handle everything from booking reservations to\nfielding late-night calls from guests who'd been locked out. \"To someone just\ngetting into Airbnb,\" Logan Haskett, one of Widell's early clients, said,\n\"this would be a dream.\"\n\nDominic Bugatto for BI\n\nThe \"Queen of Airbnb\" label, which started off as Widell's Airbnb account\nname, helped create an aura of omnipotence. \"Maybe she is the Airbnb queen,\"\nBurke remembered thinking. \"It just seemed like she just must be killing it.\"\n\nBy all appearances, Widell certainly seemed to be thriving. She took business\nlunches at Mahogany Prime Steakhouse, a leading Tulsa destination. She was a\nmember of the Summit Club \u2014 \"Downtown Tulsa's Only Private Social Club\" \u2014\nperched atop the Bank of America Center, with its panoramic views of the\nArkansas River. She hobnobbed with the local elite and claimed to have more\nAirbnb listings than anyone else in the city. She cut her hair short and, to\nher husband's annoyance, swapped out her conservative style for big sunglasses\nand more \"flamboyant\" fashions.\n\nWidell, who hadn't had much growing up, also projected an image of\nbenevolence. She made a point of hiring people with criminal records to work\nin her warehouse, and she talked about buying a church that had just come on\nthe market and turning it into a women's shelter. She was making a mark, one\nof Widell's early employees, Knikki Nash, recalled Widell saying.\n\nBut then investors started asking questions. And soon enough, Widell would be\nturning on the very people she'd promised a second chance.\n\nIn May 2022, three months after Widell made her pitch at the VFW, the Airbnb\nmarket in Tulsa was at its height. That month, some 50,000 golf fans descended\non Tulsa for the PGA Championship, which the city was hosting. Airbnb rentals\nwere fetching as much as $1,000 a night. That May, according to tax returns,\nWidell Renovations took in $166,000 from Airbnb \u2014 its best month of the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn't just Tulsa. Across the country, the Airbnb market was saturated.\nDemand was still surging, but as more and more people listed their homes with\nthe company, the average occupancy rate plunged to 55%. Burke, who was\nmanaging 25 properties, sensed the market might be overheating. She decided to\nhold off on taking any new listings. \"Tulsa jumped from like 600 to 1,500\nlistings in a very short time period,\" she said. \"I just wanted to see how\nthings kind of would shake out.\"\n\nWidell, in contrast, showed no signs of slowing down \u2014 even as the money from\nAirbnb rentals dried up.\n\nInvestors began to complain that Widell was passing along lower earnings than\nthey had expected. When pressed, Widell would blame the drop in revenue on\nunexpected cleaning costs or say that a guest had suddenly switched to a\ndifferent rental.\n\nBut some investors grew suspicious. Mallory Massey, a local real-estate\ninvestor, had handed nine of her properties over to Widell in fall 2021 to\nlist as Airbnbs. The largest, a five-bedroom home, was advertised at $249 per\nnight. Then, Massey began to notice that reservations were mysteriously\ndisappearing from her Airbnb hosting calendar. She started looking at the logs\nof messages between Widell and prospective renters \u2014 and was startled by what\nshe found. Widell was offering \"upgrades\" to other properties, effectively\nsteering renters away from Massey's units to other Airbnbs she managed,\naccording to a lawsuit Massey filed in 2022. Massey has filed to put a lien on\n11 of Widell's properties to recoup her losses in case they are sold.\n\n> \"\"I don't trust the words that come out of her mouth,\" one investor's wife\n> warned. \"She tries to hype things up too much.\"\"\n\nAnother investor, David Brunson, started working with Widell in July 2022. He\nrecalled being impressed by her enthusiasm and her experience. His wife,\nhowever, was more skeptical. \"I don't trust the words that come out of her\nmouth,\" she told him. \"She tries to hype things up too much.\"\n\nBut the promise of an easy source of passive income was too good to pass up.\nBrunson started by listing one of his properties, a two-bedroom home, with\nWidell. Then one night, he noticed that a three-week booking, totaling $2,200,\nhad disappeared from his hosting calendar. After he and Widell argued over who\nwas to blame for the cancellation, he withdrew his listing with her.\n\nOther investors were also complaining that Widell was shortchanging them.\nRenee Brummett, who worked with Widell in the early days as head of\nhousekeeping, had risen to serve as her right hand. In 2022, she started\ngetting alarmed calls from investors. \"We've had an Airbnb for two months, and\nDani hasn't paid us anything,\" Brummett recalled them saying. \"She's keeping\nour money. Or she says we owe her money.\"\n\nAccording to those familiar with the business, Widell seemed to be shifting\nher focus away from Airbnb rentals to the house-staging business. She spent\nlavishly on furniture, filling her warehouse with expensive pieces. \"The\nspending became excessive,\" Brummett said. \"That was just the beginning of the\nend for her.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in December 2022, staff confronted Widell. They, like the Airbnb hosts\nshe managed, weren't getting paid. Unsatisfied with Widell's response, some\nquit on the spot. The following day, two employees doorstepped Widell at one\nof her properties. During the encounter, which was captured by security\ncameras, she offered a very different spin on why she had hired so many\nemployees with criminal records.\n\n\"I can use the legal system to my advantage,\" Widell crowed. \"Do you know how\nmany people work here that don't want to go back to prison or jail? Fuck all\nof them.\"\n\nAs her reign unraveled, the Queen of Airbnb took measures to shore up her\nfloundering business. Widell reached out to Nash, the former employee who had\ngone to work for a rival Airbnb manager, and offered her an all-encompassing\nrole as operations manager. After checking Widell's Instagram account, Nash\nagreed.\n\n\"Everything looked all right, because Dani was just throwing money around,\"\nNash said. \"If you looked at Dani online, she's traveling and she's buying\nthings and she's paying for advertisements. Everything looks on the up and up.\nIt looked like she was trying to make this church thing happen with the\nwomen's shelter. It looked like she was trying to get everybody paid.\"\n\nBut when Nash showed up at the warehouse, she was taken aback. Employees were\nlounging around and smoking marijuana. The master spreadsheet for staging jobs\nhadn't been updated in weeks, and it was missing names and contact details for\nclients. Widell's behavior, meanwhile, struck Nash as increasingly erratic.\nShe seemed preoccupied with renewing her vows with her husband, Will, rather\nthan tending to the business. Nash couldn't understand where all the money\nfrom short-term rentals had gone, at a time when many Airbnb managers were\nstill reporting strong profits. \"I don't see how you're not making good money\noff Airbnb,\" she told Widell.\n\nIt didn't take long to get an answer. On February 3, Widell's husband filed\nfor divorce.\n\nOver the past six months, Will claimed in his filing, Widell had taken out\n$500,000 in loans and had racked up $350,000 in credit-card debt, much of it\nwithout his knowledge. A few days later, as Nash was staging a three-bedroom\nranch home on a quiet street in Tulsa, she got an urgent call from the\nwarehouse: Will was there, carting away documents. Widell had left Tulsa in a\nbrand new Land Rover. As she'd tell Nash, she was \"driving off into the\nsunset.\"\n\n\"There is no more business,\" Will told Nash when she got him on the phone.\n\"She has squandered every penny.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe marriage had been souring since the previous fall. Widell seemed to be\nworking constantly. \"She would tell me, 'I don't need to sleep anymore. I just\nfeel so much energy all the time. I just want to work,'\" Will recalled. In\nJanuary, Will cosigned a $100,000 loan against their property on the condition\nthat Widell start coming home in time for dinner and agree to see a mental-\nhealth professional.\n\nEventually, multiple people would claim that Widell had taken out credit cards\nin their names and run up bills, some as much as $6,000. Brummet says her boss\neven took out a card in the name of Brummet's daughter, who had died a year\nearlier.\n\nWidell \"had gotten herself into a lot of trouble,\" Brummett said. \"By\nDecember, a lot of owners were very unhappy. By January, there were threats of\nlawsuits. And by February, she had fled the state.\"\n\nAs Widell drove off \"into the sunset,\" as she told a former employee, those\nwho believed in her wound up paying a steep price. Dominic Bugatto for BI\n\nIn the days after Widell left Tulsa, Nash got an urgent message from an Airbnb\ntenant who had stepped into the February chill to accept a DoorDash order \u2014\nonly to find herself unable to reenter the house. The unit's remote locks, it\nturned out, had been changed for nonpayment. Widell, it appeared, had taken\nthe money and run.\n\nThe spectacular downfall of Tulsa's go-to savant for short-term rentals didn't\ndampen the city's passion for Airbnb. Widell's investors found new property\nmanagers. Her employees found other work, in some cases with Widell's old\nrivals. Today, her \"Tulsa Airbnb Group\" on Facebook remains active, with some\n1,000 members.\n\nBut what happened with Widell sounded an alarm. \"I don't think it gives the\nindustry a good name,\" Burke said. \"I remember speaking with a contact at the\ncity who said, 'You know, it's unfortunate, because sometimes there's just,\nlike, one or two people that are ruining it for everyone else.'\"\n\nAirbnb's cycle of boom and bust has also scared off some \"naive, first-time\noperators,\" Meagan McCollum, a professor of real-estate finance at the\nUniversity of Tulsa, said. \"You hear stories about people who had a tough time\nwith it, instead of just hearing the success stories when the market was hot.\nAs those stories permeate, that definitely gives people pause.\"\n\nExperts who watch the national market for short-term rentals now believe that\nthe COVID-era boom was a once-in-a-lifetime event. \"We don't expect that\nshort-term rentals will ever see occupancies that high again, barring another\npandemic,\" said Bram Gallagher, an economist at AirDNA, which tracks the\nperformance and pricing of 10 million vacation rentals. Nationally, revenues\nper listing dropped by 6.6% last year, and the market is settling into a more\nstable equilibrium \u2014 one that won't be as lucrative as the market that emerged\nduring a historic anomaly. But that won't stop people from trying to turn\ntheir property into a side hustle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's so interesting, the whole pandemic, you know, what it revealed about\nhuman nature,\" Gallagher said. \"I guess it's human nature to sort of\ncapitalize on that.\"\n\nAs for Widell, she has failed to appear in court multiple times \u2014 or even\nexplain what happened. In February and again in March, she showed up at the\nbuilding where her husband and Brummett lived, and, according to Brummett,\nharassed them with a gun. Both have obtained restraining orders against her.\n\nThose who believed in Widell, meanwhile, wound up paying a steep price for\ntheir faith in her. Nash, who said Widell owes her $8,200 in back pay,\nnarrowly avoided being evicted from her home. \"I felt sad about it,\" Nash\nsaid. \"I made it through a hard time, so I guess I'll have to figure it out\nsome other way.\"\n\nNash has picked up some work managing Airbnbs for other companies, but it\nwasn't enough to pay the bills. She was evicted by her landlord for falling\nbehind on rent and moved out of her apartment with her 16-year-old son and her\n7-year-old grandson. The only living arrangement they could find was in\nmidtown \u2014 a 16-minute drive from where the kids went to school.\n\nIt was a two-bedroom Airbnb.\n\nDan Latu is a reporter on Business Insider's Real Estate team.\n\nAxel Springer, Insider Inc.'s parent company, is an investor in Airbnb.\n\nNEW LOOK\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech,\nand business \u2014 delivered daily.
