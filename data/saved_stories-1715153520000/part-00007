Using four-wheel-drive vehicles and at times\njetskis, rescuers made their way through waist-deep water, searching for those\nwho had been left stranded by the rising waters.\n\nVideo posted online by Lula appeared to show a helicopter dropping a soldier\non the roof of a house, and the soldier using a brick to pound a hole in the\nroof and rescue a baby wrapped in a blanket.\n\nFlooding in the centre of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state after people\nwere evacuated on 5 May.

More than a million people lacked access to drinking water,\naccording to Brazil\u2019s civil defence agency.\n\nMap\n\nOn Thursday a dam at a hydroelectric plant between the cities of Bento\nGon\u00e7alves and Cotipor\u00e3 partly collapsed, while entire cities in the Taquari\nRiver valley, such as Lajeado and Estrela, were completely overtaken by water.\nHelicopters flew continually over the cities as stranded families with\nchildren awaited rescue on the rooftops.\n\nPeople being rescued in Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul state on 5 May. Photograph:\nAmanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\nOne woman said she had never seen anything like it. \u201cIt felt like a horror\nmovie,\u201d Isolete Neumann told the Associated Press earlier this week. \u201cPeople\nwere making barricades in front of hospitals with sand and gravel.\u201d\n\nLast week Lula described the floods as being among the largest Brazil had ever\nseen. \u201cNever before in the history of Brazil had there been such a quantity of\nrain in one single location,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nAerial footage shows scale of flooding in Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul \u2013 video\n\nThe flooding across the state has surpassed that seen during a deluge in 1941,\naccording to the Brazilian Geological Service. In some cities, water levels\nwere at their highest since record-keeping began almost 150 years ago, the\nagency added.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul\u2019s capital, the Gua\u00edba River broke its\nbanks, flooding streets. Aerial images showed residential areas in Porto\nAlegre that were underwater as far as the eye could see, with the tops of some\nhouses barely visible.\n\nCanoas, Rio Grande do Sul state on 5 May. Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\nAcross the city, people stood on rooftops, hoping to be rescued, while others\nin canoes or small boats navigated streets that have turned into rivers. Porto\nAlegre\u2019s international airport on Friday suspended all flights for an\nindefinite period.\n\nRains were expected to continue in the northern and north-eastern regions of\nthe state, but the volume of precipitation has been declining, and should\nremain below the levels seen in recent days, according to the state\nmeteorology authority. Earlier in the week in some areas as much as 150mm\n(6in) of rainfell within 24 hours.\n\n\u201cRiver water levels should stay high for some days,\u201d the state governor,\nEduardo Leite, said on Saturday on social media, adding that it was difficult\nto determine exactly how long the situation would continue.\n\nEarlier in the week Leite had described the floods as a \u201ccritical moment\u201d for\nthe state. \u201cThe current event will be the worst climate disaster that our\nstate ever faced,\u201d he wrote on social media on Wednesday.\n\nThe state of Rio Grande do Sul sits at a geographical meeting point between\ntropical and polar atmospheres, giving rise to a weather pattern that includes\nperiods of intense rain and drought. Local scientists say the pattern has been\nintensifying as a result of the human-made climate crisis.\n\nIn September, Rio Grande do Sul was hit by an extratropical cyclone, leading\nto flooding that killed more than 50 people. The cyclone came after more than\ntwo years of persistent drought, during which the region had only scarce\nshowers.\n\nWith contribution from Reuters, Agence France-Presse and Associated Press\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Brazil\n  * Flooding\n  * Americas\n  * Extreme weather\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
