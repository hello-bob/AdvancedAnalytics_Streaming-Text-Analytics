When I say a film is an \u2018Original\u2019 movie,\nI am purely referring to the provenance of the script. There is an adjacent\ntopic about how unoriginal movies can be despite being \u2018Original Screenplays\u2019\n(I\u2019m lookin\u2019 at you, Rebel Moon), but today, we\u2019re focusing on whether the\nfilmmakers had to license a preexisting piece of work in order to get their\nfilm to market.\n\n## Where do movies come from?\n\nThis may surprise some, but since 2000, just over half of all movies released\nhave been original screenplays.\n\nThe most common source for adapted screenplays was real-life events,\naccounting for almost a fifth of movies made between 2000 and 2023.\n(Typically, in these cases, the filmmakers will have paid for the rights to a\nnonfiction book or two that covered those events, but we will classify that as\n\u2018based on real-life events\u2019 in this analysis.)\n\nOther sources include fictional books/articles (8.9%), previous movies\n(11.8%), stage productions (including plays, musicals, and dance performances)\n(1.5%), and TV/Web shows (0.9%). In the chart below, \u2018Other\u2019 includes myths,\nlegends, poems, songs, games, toys, and more.\n\n## How has this changed over the years?\n\nForty years ago, about the same proportion of movies being made were original\nscreenplays as they are today. That\u2019s quite surprising \u2013 both because I assume\nthat many people expected it to be lower in recent years, but also because\nlittle stays the same in the film industry over such a long period of time.\n\nBut when we look at a time series by year, we can see that it hadn\u2019t\nplateaued. During the late 1990s and 2000s, original screenplays declined\nmarkedly and only rose again in the 2010s.\n\nThe story of movies based on real-life events could not be more different.\nHere, we see a steady rise over the same period, from one in twenty movies in\nthe 1980s to almost one in four in the 2020s.\n\n## Why does this feel... off?\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering why, instinctively this feels different to\nwhat you were expecting or feel you\u2019ve noticed at the cinemas.\n\nThat\u2019s because we\u2019ve been looking purely at the number of movies made. But not\nall movies are created equal. The bigger a movie is, the more likely it is to\ngrab your attention and be an adaptation.\n\nAs the chart below shows, original movies take a disproportionality smaller\npercentage of the box office than they do of the production figures. While\n55.9% of movies made during 2000-23 were original screenplays, together they\nonly account for 42.3% of the box office takings.\n\nSo let\u2019s go through the same charts we saw previously, but add on the box\noffice share and see if this makes more instinctive sense.\n\nWhile the number of movies based on original screenplays has been increasing\nsince the late 2000s, their box office share has continued to fall. In 1984,\n73% of the box office were original screenplays, whereas forty years later in\n2023, that figure was just 30.6%. And that\u2019s despite their production share\nbeing similar (i.e. 60.4% vs 55.9%).\n\nThe story behind movies based on real-life events also shifts when we take\ninto account the box office. While there has been a big boom in such movies\nbeing made, they haven\u2019t made the same level of impact on the financial side\nof the industry.\n\nWe\u2019ll end by looking at the production and performance of movies based on\nwritten material. This is the inverse of what we\u2019ve just seen with \u2018real-life\nmovies\u2019 in that their production has decreased but their box office market\nshare has grown.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe core of today\u2019s data came from Opus Data / The-Numbers, with additional\ndata from IMDb, OMDb, Wikipedia, and my own datasets. The hard work of\ndetermining the origin of each movie was done by the talented folks at Opus\nData. It covers 58,900 feature films, released in the US between 1974 and\n2023, inclusive. Box office here refers to the Domestic Box Office, i.e. the\nUS and Canada.\n\n## Epilogue\n\nThere is a deeper conversation to be had around the idea of originality.\nAvatar (2009) is officially an \u2018Original Screenplay\u2019, but I think most viewers\nwould concede it doesn\u2019t contain much we\u2019ve not seen many, many times before.\nOn the other end, The Dark Knight (2008) is a sequel to a reboot of a movie of\na comic, but its script doesn\u2019t suffer from this convoluted route to the\nscreen.\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\n## Comments\n\n2 comments\n\n  1. Marguerite A. Kosciewicz\n\nApril 15, 2024 at 12:13 pm\n\nI am so annoyed with all these \u201cinclusive\u201d films in dramas. It is disturbing\nto see minority actors work in movies that should be historically correct and\nnot politically correct.\n\nThere is something for everyone, let\u2019s stop pushing the agendas that basically\nare immoral to change history.\n\nLet\u2019s get back to real comedies that made us laugh, like Blazing Saddles,\nThree Amigos, Vacation, Ocean\u2019s Eight, Grown Ups, Death Becomes Her, It\u2019s a\nMad, Mad, Mad World, Knives Up.\n\nIf I see one more Dooms Day or Horror Film, or pushing pronouns or trans\nmessages to children, I\u2019ll vomit.\n\nReply\n\n  2. Roman BRuni\n\nApril 15, 2024 at 7:07 pm\n\nDear Stephen Another fascinating research makes an out of the box obliquous\nview of moviemaking so very enlightening about creative versus financial and\nabout our trend perception. I missed the overseas aspect of this research: in\nthis present one only US movies were included?
