A few points that\nhave come up:\n\n1: What happened with the FDA testing?\n\nIn the original FAQ, I wrote:\n\n> Professor Hillman started a company \u201cOragenics\u201d and applied for FDA\n> approval. The FDA demanded a study of 100 subjects, all of whom had to be\n> \u201cage 18-30, with removable dentures, living alone and far from school\n> zones\u201d. Hillman wasn\u2019t sure there even were 100 young people with dentures,\n> but the FDA wouldn\u2019t budge from requiring this impossible trial. Hillman\n> gave up and switched to other projects.\n\nI got this information from (company CEO) Aaron, who says he got it from\n(original inventor) Jeffrey Hillman.\n\nCommenters (and Kevin Drum) searched publicly-available archives and found a\nslightly different story, with three trials:\n\n  1. A Phase 1 trial, scheduled April 2005, on 26 people, age <55, with dentures. The company couldn\u2019t find enough people who met enrollment criteria, so they renegotiated with the FDA and switched to (2).\n\n  2. A second attempt at Phase 1 trial, scheduled October 2007, on 10 people, age 18-30, no dentures necessary, done in a hospital setting. This trial succeeded, escalating the process to (3)\n\n  3. A Phase 1b trial, scheduled January 2011. Nobody can find any details on this one, but Oragenics says it never took place because of \u201cthe very restrictive study enrollment criteria required by the FDA\u201d.\n\nSome people have tried to argue that someone must be lying, because I wrote\nabout a 100 person trial age 18-30 with dentures, and this doesn\u2019t match\neither of the two trials we know about.\n\nI think two more likely explanations are:\n\n  * This is Trial 3, the one we know nothing about\n\n  * Or someone in the Dr. Hillman \u2192 Aaron \u2192 me chain mixed up details of the three trials into a mishmash with some characteristics of each.\n\n2: What happened in the rat trials?\n\nSeveral people including Natalia Coelho found an old rat study that Dr.\nHillman had done.\n\nThe rats with the new strain (BCS3-L1) got only 1/3 the normal rats\u2019 \u201ccaries\nscore\u201d. But they didn\u2019t get a score of zero. So maybe claims like \u201cBCS3\nrepresents a complete cure for cavities\u201d are overblown.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t rats with the new strain get zero dental caries? Bacteria other\nthan S. mutans can also cause cavities, so maybe it\u2019s one of those.\n\nRat trials are famous for results that don\u2019t replicate in human trials, so\ntake these with a grain of salt.\n\n3: What did the latest colonization studies show?\n\nAaron was able to retest six people who got free samples in December. Four of\nthose people still have the bacterium. The other two don\u2019t.\n\nOf the two failures, one had an active cavity at the time the strain was\napplied (which interferes with the oral microbiome), and the other had his\nwisdom teeth removed (which involves rinsing the mouth with strong\nantiseptics).\n\nAaron hopes this shows the strain will stick around in most normal situations\n(though the failure in the presence of active cavities is disappointing).\n\n4: Any new concerns about side effects?\n\nIn my original post, I mentioned the possibility that this would set off\nBreathalyzers. Lantern was able to test this, and proved that it wasn\u2019t a\nproblem.\n\nYesterday, Lao Mein suggested on Less Wrong that it might raise oral cancer\nrisk - their post focused on people with ALDH deficiency (most common in\nAsians) but the calculations are too vague to be sure exactly which groups\nshould and shouldn\u2019t worry. This is less than 24 hours old, the company hasn\u2019t\nreplied yet, and is still developing. I\u2019ll try to update people if anyone gets\nmore clarity on this.\n\nSomeone on the post mentioned that they\u2019ve gotten worse hangovers since using\nthe product, maybe because the constant trickle of alcohol changed the way gut\nflora metabolize it.\n\n5: Any other meaningful results since the samples?\n\nCremieux says his breath smells better.\n\nSome people have objected to this claim on the grounds that it takes ~12\nmonths before the bacterium has colonized your mouth. One of the figures in my\nearlier post suggested that the bacterium might start strong, retreat for a\nwhile, and then take 12 months to fully colonize, so that might potentially\nexplain his findings. But also, is it biologically plausible that this\nprevents bad breath? My impression was that bad breath came from other\nbacterial byproducts besides lactic acid. It might be possible in theory that\nthe same metabolic changes that switch lactic acid to alcohol disrupt these\nother byproducts, but it seems kind of unlikely.\n\nAn alternate explanation is that, in order to apply this product at all, you\nneed to do a dentist-style teeth cleaning that kills your previous mouth\nbacteria. Maybe that improves the bad breath regardless of whether you add the\nLumina afterwards?\n\nSome other people have said their mouth feels fresher or something, but\nrealistically all of this is overwhelmingly likely to be placebo.\n\n6: Do I \u201cendorse\u201d Lumina?\n\nRichard Hanania has a post about how he trusts Lumina because I\u2019ve endorsed\nthem. It\u2019s extremely kind and I appreciate his respect.\n\nBut also, the most I said in the original post was that I was still debating\nwhether or not to get the treatment.\n\nMy real opinion, as precisely as I can express it, is:\n\n  * Advance of approximately the same magnitude as fluoride: 5%\n\n  * Good on balance, comparable to other beneficial dental treatments: 35%\n\n  * Doesn\u2019t work in its current form, but could easily be modified into something that does: 10%\n\n  * Doesn\u2019t work at all and never will: 50%\n\n  * Causes minor side effects for some people, same scale as Tylenol: 30%\n\n  * Causes medium side effects, same scale as tricyclics: 5%\n\n  * Causes disastrous side effects, same scale as thalidomide: <1%\n\nLots of people are going to round this off to \u201cSo you\u2019re saying it hasn\u2019t yet\nbeen proven to work? Doesn\u2019t that mean it\u2019s Not Real Science which means it\u2019s\na scam which means anyone who likes it is exactly as bad as LK-99 believers or\nivermectin proponents?\u201d\n\nI will never get tired of posting this picture:\n\nIf there\u2019s really an intervention with a 5% chance of being as good as\nfluoride, languishing in a file drawer somewhere, that\u2019s a big deal!\n\nObviously the best course is to study it carefully and not do anything until\nyou know more. The FDA has already closed off that route. Aaron\u2019s taking the\nonly option left - getting it out there where it can be mass tested by users.\nSoon we\u2019ll have good data on colonization rates, retention rates, and\n(hopefully) mouth lactic acid levels. After a while, we\u2019ll have at least some\nanecdotal evidence on cavities. If we\u2019re really lucky, that will provoke a\nsecond round of interest from pharma companies, dentists, and scientists.\n\nJust because testing things like this is +EV value for society, doesn\u2019t mean\nit\u2019s +EV value for every individual involved. The testing process has to pull\ntogether inventors, investors, manufacturers, and customers, using some mix of\ngreed, delusion, altruism, technophilia, and goodwill. I think it\u2019s fair to\ntry to minimize the greed and delusion by reminding people that medical\ninterventions which make biological sense and work in rats have a bad human\ntrack record. But having done that, I don\u2019t think you also have to try to\ncrush the goodwill and technophilia.\n\nIf you\u2019re a poor person, spending your last $250 on this because you\ndesperately want to cure your cavity problem, and you would be devastated if\nit didn\u2019t work or if had any side effects - then you shouldn\u2019t buy Lumina.\n\nBut if you have extra money, and you think biomedical innovation is cool, you\nwant to be able to tell people you have genetically-modified bacteria in your\nmouth, and you want to contribute to the project of taking this out of the\nfile drawer of discarded good ideas and back into the arena, and maybe get\nfewer cavities as a bonus - then yeah, I think it\u2019s a prosocial thing to do,\nand probably won\u2019t go too wrong - although this is not medical advice and\nreally we have no way of knowing how wrong it will go.\n\n(I would hold off if you\u2019re Asian, or otherwise likely to have ALDH\ndeficiency, until someone addresses the recent post.)\n\nI would prefer not to be quoted as \u201cendorsing\u201d Lumina in any way more\nsimplistic than this, lest people who think endorsement = \u201cit definitely\nworks\u201d over-update on my supposed opinion.\n\n### Subscribe to Astral Codex Ten\n\nBy Scott Alexander\n\nP(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\n\n26 Likes\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Updates on Lumina Probiotic\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n21\n\nShare\n\nShare this discussion\n\n#### Updates on Lumina Probiotic\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n21 Comments\n\n  * New First\n  * Chronological\n\nAmie DeveroTwo (or More) Opposing Ideas1 hr agoOf course, there is another\noption: raise funds to perform a private double-blind study.

A\nsusbtantial proportion of these will also do net harm, but this has not been\nproven either and will thus not be put forward by the proponents of this\nmonths flavour of lifestyle garbage. Such is the nature of confidence\nintervals, and to soften your standards for recommending medical intervention\nbased on this faulty reasoning is a form of soft thinking. Pandemic reasoning\nmade this error time and again and I guess it is only logical that it now\ninfects other areas of science.

At the very least it would probably lead to boom\nand bust cycles for the S. mutans in the mouth, giving other bacteria\ncompetitive advantages in that scenario, regardless of the small amount of\nantibiotic being released. This could also enhance genetic drift as the S.\nmutans population dwindles as the result of the phage.The problem with having\na dominant type of bacteria in your mouth is that it becomes an easy and\nplentiful target for phages.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \npaul balibips & bobs43 mins agoWhat did the Company do with the test animals\nwhen done with them?Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nMichaeL Roe41 mins agoA lot of the opinion on LK=99 was, try to replicate the\nexperiment nd then we'll know.
