Meta\u2019s Workplace began\nas an employees-only version of Facebook. Slack was a modern IRC platform for\ndevelopers of the video game Glitch. All three went on to be highly successful\nproducts when transitioned from internal-only to public product.\n\nI have been lucky to work on several efforts to transform core internal tools\nto commercial products\u2014including Workplace at Facebook and P2 at\nAutomattic\u2014and I became a firm believer that innovation used to solve your own\nproblems can offer compelling solutions to other companies\u2019 problems, too.\n\nAt the same time, I have also witnessed five product building anti-patterns\nfor crossing the internal-to-external \u201cchasm\u201d. Managing around these traps is\ncritical to bringing an internal tool to market, or if you can\u2019t, determining\nquickly that your efforts are better spent elsewhere.\n\n####\n\nAnti-pattern 1: Assume your customers look like you\n\nThe core hypothesis in transforming internal tools to public products is that\nother companies face the same problems that your tool solves. However, this\ncan lead to a false assumption: that your ideal customer should look like your\ncompany, or to put a finer point on it, to misunderstand what you share in\ncommon.\n\nWhen Facebook at Work was first introduced, we assumed tech startups would be\nour ideal customers: not only was their mode of working most similar to\nFacebook\u2019s, but we felt we understood them best as we often partnered closely\non other products.\n\nBut the real breakthrough opportunity came from customers like Walmart and\nStarbucks who wanted to use the product (re-branded as Workplace) to connect\ntheir \u201cfrontline\u201d employees. We assumed it would be used by desk-based tech\nfolk with great Wi-Fi, but Workplace found market fit with companies where\nmobile workers used the product in a very different way.\n\nYou still need to validate your ideal customer and it may not be you.\n\n####\n\nAnti-pattern 2: Rely on [your] culture\n\nAt Automattic we had the saying \u201cP2 or it didn\u2019t happen\u201d which was the\nexpectation that a representation of your work\u2014whether code, designs,\nmeetings, research etc.\u2014would be posted to our WordPress-based collaboration\nplatform so that everyone in the company could see it. This practice was a\npowerful cultural norm that has enabled Automattic to thrive as a fully-\ndistributed, global company for more than 15 years.\n\nYet when we talked to potential customers of P2, many of them struggled with\nthe idea of implementing a similar practice, even when the pandemic drove them\nto transform to a remote workplace like Automattic.\n\nIn short, if your tool is an extension of your internal company culture, don\u2019t\nrely on the practices of that culture to exist or be adopted by your\ncustomers.\n\n####\n\nAnti-pattern 3: Not prioritizing between internal and external users\n\nIt\u2019s common for the same team that\u2019s working on transforming a tool into a\nproduct to also end up responsible for its internal use.\n\nGiven the internal needs for the tool are clear and support the existing\nbusiness, in the early days they can outweigh the yet-to-be-known value of\nsolving problems for external customers. It\u2019s also easy to think that\nimproving something for an internal user will translate to external customers\nas well. It often won\u2019t.\n\nThe end result is a form of the Innovator\u2019s Dilemma, where a disruptive\ninnovation is smothered by a company\u2019s traditional business, but in this case\nit\u2019s the company\u2019s internal needs that can smother a tool\u2019s external market\npotential.\n\nSuccessful companies manage this trade-off intentionally, creating a decision-\nmaking framework for how improvements will be prioritized. Even better, they\nalso build their tools as platforms to support both internal and external\nclients, much as Amazon did with their API Mandate. This practice made\npossible AWS, Fulfillment by Amazon, Alexa and other successful Amazon\nservices.\n\n####\n\nAnti-pattern 4: Focus on advanced capabilities vs. beginner problems\n\nBy nature, your company is already highly experienced using your internal\ntool. You may have developed advanced features that leverage the tool\u2019s\ncapabilities. But you have to be careful not to let your intimate familiarity\nwith your internal tool blind you to the challenges that newcomers face.\n\nFor example, a typical mistake is to prioritize development of an onboarding\nexperience that demonstrates the advanced features of your product, \u201ctool-\ntipping through the learning curve\u201d. Instead you should be focused on\ndiscovering the core problems that beginner users want addressed, and evolve\nyour product to capably satisfy those.\n\nNo ones going to stick around for your advanced capabilities if the beginner\nproblems are not compelling and clearly addressed.\n\n####\n\nAnti-pattern 5: Overlook go-to-market alignment challenges\n\nIf your main business is a consumer offering, or if your go-to-market motion\nis primarily product-led and small-team focused, then you\u2019re probably under\nequipped to tackle an enterprise or mid-market GTM motion.\n\nLikewise, if you\u2019re primarily enterprise sales-driven, but your internal\nproduct aligns better with teams than whole organizations, then you may need\nto adopt a product-led growth strategy, which you may not have the staff and\nsystems to support.\n\nEven if you\u2019re used to selling to enterprise customers, your new product may\nrequire sign off from a whole different cohort of stakeholders: in my\nexperience, marketing platforms, CRMs and internal collaboration systems all\nhave different owners.\n\nThis all could require developing systems or capabilities you didn\u2019t have\npreviously. For example, with Workplace, Facebook quickly realized the need to\nbuild entirely new customer success teams that were experienced with\nenterprise software, focused on the support and training of internal champions\nfor Workplace to gain a foothold in a prospective company. We also needed to\nupdate the product to meet customers\u2019 security and admin requirements.\n\nUltimately, building new go-to-market capabilities can be time consuming and\nexpensive. So you should first validate the level of alignment between your\nproduct, people and processes with what\u2019s required of the new opportunity.\n\nNot to mention validating whether or not all that effort would be worth it.\n\n####\n\nValue is not what you already built\n\nWith internal products, you start with something that is already built, which\nalready creates value for you.\n\nIf you want to launch an external product though, you need to focus extra hard\non how it will be used by external customers. You need to internalize the\nproblems they will use your product for, and how they will learn about it and\nadopt it.\n\nSet aside the value your internal tool creates from your company\u2019s use, and\ninstead envision it as a set of capabilities to solve problems for potential\ncustomers.\n\nUse that as your north star.\n\nYou may find you can unlock incredible value for them and for you.\n\n> The value is in what gets used, not in what gets built. \u2013 Kris Gale\n\nThanks for reading Probable Wisdom!
