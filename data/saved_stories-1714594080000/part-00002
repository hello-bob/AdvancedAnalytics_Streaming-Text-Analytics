I have nothing to say but\nwonderfully professional and helpful. I have never bought a cat from a breeder\nbefore so I did my research. I talked to many breeders and had settled on 2. I\nchose this breeder for several reasons. He had a kitten I was looking for, the\nprice was comparable to other breeders and he was also in a location easier\nfor me to get too. The transaction for the kitten was cut and dry and very\neasy.\n\nErica L.@ericalana\n\nRead More\n\nI got my blue Bi-color Ragdoll from Gary in 2017 and I couldn\u2019t be happier!\nBefore picking up my Sadie I emailed and called Jerry Tomilson with many\nquestions and he was very patient and always answered in a timely manner. read\nmore\n\nJeni R.Jeniraida\n\nRead More\n\nI was fortunate to find this website about a year and a half ago. I researched\nthis breeder and compared what he offered to other breeders located closer to\nmy home. I was impressed with his three-year genetic health guarantee; as\nsomeone new to purchasing an animal from a breeder I had lots of questions and\nconcerns, which he patiently answered and addressed. I found this breeder to\nbe very kind and helpful to a \u201cnewbie\u201d\n\nSandie Miller\n\nRead More\n\nMy husband and I purchased a Ragdoll kitten from this breeder in September of\n2011 and we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled! BRAVO is a healthy, wonderfully\nfriendly Seal Mitten Ragdoll kitten who kisses us \u201cgood morning\u201d, plays\nenergetically during the day, and then sleeps the night through next to our\nheads, often purring contentedly. He is amazingly social and possesses a\ncuriosity that brightens our day. Over our 59 years of living, we\u2019ve owned\nmany wonderful pets from sheepdogs and iguanas to cats and cockatoos, but\nwe\u2019ve never experienced anything like a Ragdoll kitten. We absolutely loved\nworking with Jerry Tomilson.\n\nBecki Zschiedrich\n\nRead More\n\nI purchased the most beautiful Lilac Ragdoll from Gary Strobel in May 2011. I\nhad been talking to Gary for over six months before the purchase because I was\nso nervous about the kitten flying to New Orleans. He assured me that the\nkitten would be fine. Well, he is fine and 100% purrfect. I named him Zephyr.\nHe is the BEST present I have ever bought myself.\n\nEllen Gould\n\nRead More\n\nWe have now had two cats from Gary. The breeder is fabulous. Our first cat,\nOscar lived 14 wonderful years. We were shattered when he passed away. Our new\nkitty, Ivan, is a terrorist! He chases our two dogs, jumps around playfully\nand gives us so many smiles I cannot count them all. Ivan came to us totally\nsocialized, and joined our dogs without a hitch. He travels with us all over\nin our RV and loves the ride.\n\nAngela Burns\n\nRead More\n\nWe purchased our Ragdoll, Dallas in December of 2019 and had the most\nwonderful experience. We found Jerry because of a close family friend had\npurchased their Ragdoll, Jackson a few years prior. Upon deciding we wanted a\nRagdoll, we contacted Jerry and went to \u201cmeet\u201d our new family member the day\nafter Thanksgiving! We fell in love, but were going on vacation in early\nDecember & Jerry said he\u2019d hold Dallas for us until we returned. Upon\nreturning we picked Dallas up the next day and took him home.\n\nCindy Lombard@cindyliombard\n\nRead More\n\nThe breeder is a fantastic cattery. We adopted a Ragdoll from Jerry last year.\nWe live in Idaho and Jerry shipped this little tiny kitten to us. Charley\narrived on time at our airport. We promptly took him to our veterinarian who\ngave him a complete physical and found him very healthy. It is also good to\nknow that Charley\u2019s health has been guaranteed for 3 years. Charley is a\nwonderful, spirited, healthy and inquisitive boy.\n\nChantel Lamberto Ceryak\n\nRead More\n\nWe bought three WONDERFUL kittens from Jeery (one male and one female and\nanother male for my parents a year later.) They were all huge additions to our\nlife and our family and I feel so fortunate to have had them in our lives.\nHenry and Harold were the two males and they were the sweetest most personable\ncats I have ever met.\n\nJohnnny Stewart\n\nRead More\n\nWe bought one Ragdoll kitten. We loved it so much we went back and bought\nanother. Jerry was very professional and knowledgeable. His cattery is very\nclean. I have asked him questions over the phone about cats and he has been\nvery helpful\n\nJohn Doe\n\nRead More\n\nI bought a cat from this breeder in June of 2011.
