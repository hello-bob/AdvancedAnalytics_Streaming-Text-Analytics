The food, I opined to my wife, was premium mediocre.\nShe instantly got what I meant, though she didn\u2019t quite agree that Veggie\nGrill qualified. In the weeks that followed, premium mediocre turned into a\nterm of art for us, and we gleefully went around labeling various things with\nthe term, sometimes disagreeing, but mostly agreeing. And it wasn\u2019t just us.\nWhen I tried the term on my Facebook wall, and on Twitter, again everybody\ninstantly got the idea, and into the spirit of the labeling game.\n\nAs a connoisseur and occasional purveyor of fine premium-mediocre memes, I was\nintrigued. It\u2019s rare for an ambiguous neologism like this to generate such\nstrong consensus about what it denotes without careful priming and curation by\na skilled shitlord. Sure, there were arguments at the margins, and\nsophisticated (well, premium mediocre) discussions about distinctions between\npremium mediocrity and related concepts such as middle-class fancy,\naristocratic shabby, and that old classic, petit bourgeois, but overall,\npeople got it. Without elaborate explanations.\n\nBut since the sine qua non of premium mediocrity is superfluous premium\nfeatures (like unnecessary over-intellectualized blog posts that use phrases\nlike sine qua non), let me offer an elaborate explanation anyway. It\u2019s a good\nway to celebrate August, which I officially declare the premium mediocre\nmonth, when all the premium mediocre people go on premium mediocre vacations\nfeaturing premium mediocre mai tais at premium mediocre resorts paid for in\npart by various premium-mediocre reward programs.\n\nIt is not hard to learn to pattern-match premium mediocre. In my sample of\nseveral dozen people I roped into the game, only one had serious trouble\ngetting the idea. Most of the examples below, and all the really good ones,\ncame from others.\n\nPremium mediocre is the finest bottle of wine at Olive Garden. Premium\nmediocre is cupcakes and froyo. Premium mediocre is \u201ctruffle\u201d oil on anything\n(no actual truffles are harmed in the making of \u201ctruffle\u201d oil), and extra-leg-\nroom seats in Economy. Premium mediocre is cruise ships, artisan pizza, Game\nof Thrones, and The Bellagio.\n\nPremium mediocre is food that Instagrams better than it tastes.\n\nPremium mediocre is Starbucks\u2019 Italian names for drink sizes, and its original\npumpkin spice lattes featuring a staggering absence of pumpkin in the\npreparation. Actually all the coffee at Starbucks is premium mediocre. I like\nit anyway.\n\nPremium mediocre is Cost Plus World Market, one of my favorite stores,\npurveyor of fine imported potato chips in weird flavors and interesting cheap\ncandy from convenience stores around the world.\n\nThe best banana, any piece of dragon fruit, fancy lettuce, David Brooks\u2019 idea\nof a gourmet sandwich.\n\nPremium mediocre, premium mediocre, premium mediocre, premium mediocre.\nMediocre with just an irrelevant touch of premium, not enough to ruin the\ndelicious essential mediocrity.\n\nYes, ribbonfarm is totally premium mediocre. We are a cut above the new media\nmediocrityfests that are Vox and Buzzfeed, and we eschew low-class memeing and\nlisticles. But face it: actually enlightened elite blog readers read Tyler\nCowen and Slatestarcodex.\n\nPremium mediocre is international. My buddy Visakan Veerasamy (a name Indian-\norigin people will recognize as a fantastic premium mediocre name, suitable\nfor a Tamil movie star, unlike mine which is merely mediocre, and suitable for\na side character) reports that Singaporeans can enjoy the fine premium\nmediocre experience of the McDonald\u2019s Signature Collection.\n\nAnything branded as \u201csignature\u201d is premium mediocre of course.\n\nMuch of the manufactured cool of K-Pop (though not the subtly subversive\nGangnam Style, whose sly commentary on Korean life takes some digging for non-\nKoreans to grok) is premium mediocre. Carlos Bueno argues that Johnny Walker\nBlack is premium mediocre in the Caribbean. In Bollywood, the movies of Karan\nJohar are premium mediocre portrayals of premium mediocre modern urban Indian\nlife.\n\nThe entire idea of the country that is France is kinda premium mediocre (K-Pop\nis a big hit there, not coincidentally). The fact that Americans equate\n\u201cFrench\u201d with \u201cclassy\u201d is proof of its premium mediocrity (Switzerland is the\nactually elite European country).\n\nAt its broad, fuzzy edges, premium mediocre is an expansive concept; a global,\ncosmopolitan and nationalist cultural Big Tent: it is arguably both suburban\nand neourban, Red and Blue, containing Boomers and X\u2019ers. It includes\nbluetooth headsets favored by Red State farmers and the tiki torches \u2014\ndesigned for premium mediocre backyard barbecues \u2014 favored by your friendly\nneighborhood Nazis. It includes everything Trump-branded. It covers\nMcMansions, insecure suburbia-dwelling Dodge Stratus owners and Bed, Bath, and\nBeyond shoppers. It includes gentrifying neighborhoods and ghost-town malls.\nIt includes Netflix and chill. It includes Blue Apron meals.\n\nAt some level, civilization itself is at a transitional premium mediocre state\nsomewhere between industrial modernity in a shitty end-of-life phase, and\ndigital post-scarcity in a shitty early-beta phase. Premium mediocrity is a\nstand-in for the classy kind of post-scarcity digital utopia some of us like\nto pretend is already here, only unevenly distributed. The kind where\neverybody gets a mansion, is a millionaire, and drives a Tesla.\n\nBut the demographic at the very heart of the phenomenon, the sine qua non of\npremium mediocrity, is the young, gentrifier class of Blue Bicoastal\nMillennials. The rent-over-own, everything-as-a-service class of precarious\nyoung professionals auditioning for a shot at the neourban American dream,\nsans condo ownership somewhere at a reasonable distance from both the nearest\nmeth lab and minority ghetto.\n\nIt is a class for which I have profound affection, and one whose eventual\nsuccess I am sincerely rooting for. In a generally devastated global human\ncondition, the Blue Bicoastal Millennials of the US represent The Little\nDemographic That Could.\n\nPremium mediocrity is the story of Maya Millennial, laughing alone with her\nsalad. She\u2019s just not a millionaire...yet. She just doesn\u2019t have a\nmansion...yet. She just doesn\u2019t drive a Tesla...yet.\n\nThe essence of premium mediocrity is being optimistically prepared for success\nby at least being in the right place at the right time, at least for a little\nwhile, even if you have no idea how to make anything happen during your window\nof opportunity. Even if you know nothing else, you know to move to San\nFrancisco or New York and hoping something good happens there, rather than\nsitting around in some dying small town where you know nothing will ever\nhappen and being curious about anything beyond the town is a cultural\ntransgression. This is a strategy open to all.\n\nAs a result, as another buddy Rob Salkowitz put it in our Facebook discussion,\npremium mediocrity is creating an aura of exclusivity without actually\nexcluding anyone.\n\nOn the production side, \u201cdemocratization\u201d of anything previously considered\nactually premium, through disintermediation of pompous but knowledgeable\nexperts, in the name of \u201cconsumer choice,\u201d generally creates a premium\nmediocre economic sector, with a decent selection available at Costco.\n\n## Reach Up, Don\u2019t Crash\n\nPremium mediocrity is a pattern of consumption that publicly signals upward\nmobile aspirations, with consciously insincere pretensions to refined taste,\nwhile navigating the realities of inexorable downward mobility with sincere\nanxiety. There are more important things to think about than actually learning\nto appreciate wine and cheese, such as making rent. But at least pretending to\nappreciate wine and cheese is necessary to not fall through the cracks in the\nAPI.\n\nAs practiced by its core class of Bernie voters, premium mediocrity is\nultimately a rational adaptive response to the challenge of scoring a middle-\nclass life lottery ticket in the new economy. It is an economic and cultural\nrearguard action by young people launched into life from the old middle class,\nbut not quite equipped to stay there, and trying to engineer a face-saving\nsoft landing...somewhere.\n\nNot all who participate in the culture of premium mediocrity share in the\nprecarity that defines its core, trend-setting, thingness-defining sub-class,\nbut precarity is the source of the grammar and visual aesthetic \u2014 and it is\nprimarily visual \u2014 of premium mediocrity.\n\nHow big is the premium mediocre class? My scientific #TrueNews twitter poll\nreveals that at least in my neck of the online woods, 58% identify as premium\nmediocre gentry (N=127).\n\nAt a more macro-sociological level, as my opening graphic illustrates, premium\nmediocre is a kind of modern proto middle class, born of a vanishing old\nmiddle class, and attempting to fake it while waiting for a replacement to\nappear under their feet while they tread water. It is a class sandwiched\nbetween the crypotobourgeoisie above and the API below.\n\nWhy this particular class sandwich? It has to do with mobility options.\n\nAbout the only path to wealth-building available to the average premium\nmediocre young person in the developed world today, absent any special\ntechnical skills or entrepreneurial bent, is cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe traditional wealth-building strategy in the US, home ownership, has turned\ninto a mix of a mug\u2019s game and unassailable NIMBY rentierism.\n\nThe public markets are no longer reliable wealth builders, while the private\nmarkets exclude almost everybody who isn\u2019t already wealthy.\n\nAnd the tech-startup options lottery and media-celebrity games are not open to\nthose who can\u2019t program at world-eating levels or shitpost at election-winning\nlevels.\n\nThat leaves the cryptocurrency lottery as the only documented way up open to\nall, regardless of skills. Like many other denizens of the premium mediocre\nclass, I too am aspiring cryptobourgeoisie, awaiting The Flippening.\n\nTo be fair, the actual cryptobourgeoisie, comprising bitcoin and ether\ncryptomillionaires, is a tiny class; a representative narrative placeholder\nrather than a social reality. The name is synecdoche; the cryptobourgeoisie\nincludes anyone who\u2019s made it through any kind of mostly-dumb-luck Internet\nget-rich-quick scheme anytime in the last couple of decades.\n\nFor the most part, even as the too-big-to-fail 1% class and the tech-nouveau-\nriche consolidate a new nobility, there is no real equivalent to a haute\nbourgeoisie class today. The cryptobourgeoisie is a sign that one might emerge\nthough.\n\nThis thought led me to my most premium mediocre tweet of the year so far:\n\nAnd below? There lies the terrifying structural boundary of our times \u2014 the\nAPI. Today, you\u2019re either above the API or below the API (the phrase \u201cbelow\nthe API\u201d appears to have been coined by Peter Reinhardt in 2015). You either\ntell robots what to do, or are told by robots what to do. To crash through the\nAPI, and into what I previously termed the Jeffersonian middle class, is to go\nfrom being predator to prey in the locust economy.\n\nTo live a premium mediocre life is to live this pattern of potential social\nmobility. Many of my friends \u2014 the fraction who inhabit the tech scene but\naren\u2019t actual #entitledtechies pulling down #DeepLearning money \u2014 are from\nthis class. The more fortunate ones occasionally break into the\ncryptobourgeoisie for days to weeks at a time, depending on the current value\nof bitcoin and ether.\n\nThe less fortunate ones have to occasionally patch over lean months with a\nstint of Uber or Lyft driving on the DL, under the API.\n\nPeople like me, old enough and lucky enough to have earned some freebie\ninstitutional capital, socked away some 401k dollars, and earned something of\na professional career rep before the shit hit the fan around 2008, are\nsomewhere in between.\n\nLike Molly Millennial, I\u2019m not a millionaire...yet. But I also haven\u2019t had to\ndrive a Lyft...yet. As a Gen X\u2019er with lots of free college under my belt, the\nmomentum of my decade in the paycheck economy has created a certain amount of\nstability in my life that people a decade younger than me usually lack.\n\nThis is the tense, fragile, calm of a social order pretending furiously that\nit is not unraveling, even as a new breed of zero-sum political opportunist is\ngaining power by pointing out its necessary hypocrisies.\n\nThat\u2019s what the Trumpenproletariat don\u2019t get. The apparent hypocrisy of the\nbicoastal \u201celites\u201d (really, the premium mediocre) isn\u2019t weakness or low moral\nfiber. It is a necessary fiction that\u2019s critical to the bootstrapping logic of\nthe new economy.\n\nThe question is, why? Who is served by the pretense? To what end is it\nmaintained? Is it a useful hypocrisy that leads to better things, or a toxic\none? How can you too, be premium mediocre? Where should you get your premium\nmediocre lunch?\n\nBefore we can address these questions, we have to understand what premium\nmediocrity is not.\n\n## What Premium Mediocre is Not\n\nHere\u2019s the thing that distinguishes premium mediocrity from related concepts\nlike middle-class fancy, nouveau riche, arriviste, and petit bourgeoisie.\nThough it is a social response to similar forces (a high-inequality gilded age\nmarking an economy in radical transition from one kind of middle-class wealth-\nbuilding to another), there are two elements that, I think, distinguish\npremium mediocrity from its transitional-middle-class cousins through the\nages.\n\nFirst, the consumers of premium mediocre things are generally strongly and\nacutely self-aware about what they are doing. In the age of Yelp reviews,\nmemes, and Twitter trends, you have to be living under a rock to harbor strong\nillusions about how what you consume is perceived by your more tasteful peers.\nIt is not a false consciousness in the traditional fish-in-water sense.\n\nSo premium mediocrity is not clueless, tasteless consumption of mediocrity\nunder the mistaken impression that it is actual luxury consumption. Maya\nMillennial is aware that what she is consuming is mediocre at its core, and\nonly \u201cpremium\u201d in some peripheral (and importantly, cheap, such as French-for-\nno-reason branding) ways. But she consumes it anyway. She is aware that her\nconsumption is tasteless, yet she pretends it is tasteful anyway. To quote\nscholar of taste Gabe Duquette, she consumes pablum knowing it\u2019s pablum.\n\n> ### Sidebar: The Avocado Toast Paradox\n>\n> There is an exception to the idea that premium mediocre things are always\n> mediocre at the core, which I call the avocado toast paradox. Avocado toast\n> is Actually Good,TM to use another term of art coined by Gabe Duquette,\n> despite being legitimately premium mediocre too. This is not really a\n> paradox. It just seems like one. Here\u2019s why.\n>\n> Though the typical premium mediocre product is an inferior good in the guise\n> of a Veblen good, there are some things that manage to be premium mediocre\n> by virtue of being higher-quality, but lower-utility substitutes for higher-\n> utility experiences. Avocado toast is a good example. You can get a heartier\n> but more mediocre (and less photogenic) breakfast item for the same price.\n> Cupcakes follow the same logic. So does kale. All these foods might taste\n> Actually Good,TM but might leave you hungry.\n>\n> This exception exists because premium mediocrity is by and large sanguine\n> rather than melancholic about itself. It does not wallow in brooding despair\n> about its own precarity. It is not joyless. It likes to occasionally\n> actually treat itself, instead of only pretending to, without disturbing the\n> fiction it presents.\n>\n> At its worst though, the avocado toast exception can lead to really weird\n> trade-off patterns. I know of at least one pretty young woman who forgoes\n> food for expensive Actually GoodTM purses, an extreme instance of what is\n> known as trading up. She is neither anorexic, nor particularly narcissistic.\n> She has an entire clever repertoire of canny lifehacker tricks to score free\n> food. Young women seem to be grandmasters at the 8D chess that is the game\n> of premium mediocrity.\n>\n> Another example that came up for discussion on my Facebook wall was really\n> good grilled-cheese sandwiches. Are they premium mediocre or not? Depends.\n> If they are consumed instead of two cheaper, but more mediocre meals, they\n> are premium mediocre. If they are a substitute for an average grilled cheese\n> sandwich, a rare gouda-over-velveeta treat, then they are a kind of middle-\n> class fancy.\n>\n> Premium mediocrity then, is a function of context and intentions, rather\n> than absolute taste.\n\nSecond the distinguishing feature is that premium mediocrity only signals an\nappearance of striving upwards. Everybody in the premium mediocre world\nrecognizes that it is not a reliable indicator of actual upward striving, such\nas number of code commits on github, or non-bot retweets achieved by on a\ntweet.\n\nIn other words, premium mediocrity is dressing for the lifestyle you\u2019re\nsupposed to want, in order to hold on to the lifestyle you can actually afford\n\u2014 for now \u2014 while trying to engineer a stroke of luck.\n\n## New Economy Social Hitchhikers\n\nIn a world where actual mobility is both difficult and strongly dependent on\nluck, but there is a widely performed (but not widely believed) false\nnarrative of pure meritocracy, it pays to signal apparent control over your\ndestiny, while actually playing by the speculation rules of a casino economy.\n\nPremium mediocrity is the idea of the towel in Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide. A show put\non to serve as an attractor of a certain kind of social serendipity, such as\nbeing picked for one of the scarce non-technical, non-skilled jobs in the tech\neconomy because you\u2019ve been tweeting and exercising right, in the right kind\nof hoodie or yoga pants. As Douglas Adams observed:\n\n> More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason,\n> if a strag (strag: nonhitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel\n> with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a\n> toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of\n> string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the\n> strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other\n> items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have \u201clost.\u201d What the strag\n> will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the\n> Galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through and\n> still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.\n\nI\u2019ll call this towel-based personal branding, TBPB. The strags in this picture\nare those who\u2019ve actually made it in the new economy and have new wealth\navailable for trickle-down operations.\n\nFor the average premium mediocre type, it pays to appear to be striving, but\nnot to actually strive (until you have engineered an actual opening at least).\nTo dress up near-pure gambling as near-pure Horatio-Alger-heroism. That\u2019s\ntowel-based personal branding.\n\nThe presence of two features \u2014 being aware of one\u2019s own mediocrity, and faking\nstriving \u2014 help distinguish premium mediocrity from several related concepts.\nMiddle-class fancy, for example, is simply a sort of low-end luxury (\u201cfancy\u201d\nby the way, is an official grade designation for peanuts by the USDA) favored\nby the tasteless but non-precarious suburban middle class.\n\nPremium mediocrity is also not the same as what another buddy, Chris Anderson\n(no not the one you\u2019re thinking of, this one), in my original Facebook thread,\ndubbed \u201cmediocre premium, aka aristocratic shabby\u201d, which is simply diminished\nwealth adjusting to a lower standard of living, but not existentially\ndistressed by financial worries. That would be things like trading a Benz for\na Lexus or downsizing to a smaller house by selling a bigger one.\n\nPremium mediocrity combines elements of the brave face-saving resigned\ndownward mobility of a Tennessee Williams heroine, and the sunny optimism of\nDickens\u2019 Micawber, but is more complex than either.\n\nUnlike Blanche duBois in A Streetcar Named Desire, the premium mediocre\nactively conjure up the kindness of strangers with towel-based personal\nbranding rather than relying on unfocused forces of cosmic serendipity. They\nmake their own luck; they clickbait the kindness of the new elite into their\nlives by laughing over their salads.\n\nAnd unlike Micawber, who lives a manic-depressive cyclic life between actual\noptimistic striving and debtors-prison despair, the premium mediocre merely\ncollect Foursquare mayorships (is that still a thing?) rather than actually\nstriving to become Mayor like Micawber.\n\nShockingly, the strategy works more often than you might think. I\u2019m constantly\nwondering, how did THAT guy/gal land THAT gig? What do I have to LARP to get\nthat?\n\nBecause after all, we live in a more complex age than even the most prescient\npremium mediocre French intellectuals foresaw. One in which an emerging, not-\nquite-there-yet middle class must put on a show of substance for two other\nclasses that need to believe it already kinda exists: Boomer parents and\nuniverse-denting Big Man entrepreneurs.\n\n## The Parents Are Alright\n\nHere\u2019s the thing \u2014 and this confused me for a long time \u2014 premium mediocrity\nis not a consumption aesthetic, but a financial hack powering a deliberately\ncrafted illusion that is being strategically crafted for a purpose.\n\nViewed as a voluntarily chosen consumption aesthetic, premium mediocrity does\nnot make sense. Why would anyone knowingly pay too much for obviously inferior\nproducts and experiences? Why would anyone pay a premium merely to present a\nfacade of upward striving? Why would anyone participate in maintaining a false\nconsciousness knowing it is false? Why would anyone choose the Blue Pill if it\ndidn\u2019t come with a comforting amnesia?\n\nWhy would you give up consumption value for signaling value if none of your\nin-group peers, among whom you are striving for status, is actually fooled by\nthe signaling?\n\nWho is the illusion for?\n\nPart of the answer, in one word, is parents.\n\nPremium mediocrity is in part a theater put on by Maya Millennial in part to\nspare the feelings of parents. Inter-generational love, not inter-generational\nwar.\n\nThe premium mediocre harbor few illusions about their economic condition. The\nfalse consciousness at the heart of it is manufactured for the benefit of a\nparental generation that is convinced it has set the kids up for success.\n\nIn the blame-the-millennials generational war, we sometimes forget that\nmillennials are the children of boomers, and that by and large, broken\nfamilies aside, there is genuine affection going both ways. It is important\nfor parents to believe that their hard work through the late eighties and\nnineties was not for nothing. That they succeeded as parents. That they set\nthe kids up for a life better than their own.\n\nThat despite everything, their kids are alright; it\u2019s only others\u2019 kids who\nare all about participation trophies, narcissism, and entitlement.\n\nIt is stupid to doubt this. Parents everywhere generally want their kids to do\nbetter than they did, and enjoy advantages they did not. To this end, they\nwill eagerly buy into even the flimsiest theater of success put up by the\nkids, and avoid asking too many pointed questions that might ruin the\nillusion.\n\nNo normal parent actively wishes a lower standard of living on a child coming\nof age. It\u2019s just that the economy sometimes does not play ball with the best-\nlaid plans of parents and teachers.\n\nEqually, it is stupid to think that average millennials actively want to hurt\ntheir parents. The minor skirmishing around entitlement, participation\ntrophies, snowflakiness, and performative narcissism is a sideshow featuring\nother parent-child relationships, not yours. By and large, most young people I\nknow simply want to spare their parents the pain of facing the fact that\ndespite their best efforts at parenting, they are struggling.\n\nSo the false consciousness \u2014 the maya at the heart of premium mediocrity \u2014 is\none manufactured for the benefit of parents who desperately want to believe\nthat they succeeded as parents and that their kids are thriving. And it is\nmanufactured by kids who, almost as desperately, want to spare their parents\nthe pain of knowing that they aren\u2019t thriving.\n\nThat\u2019s one half of the story, the backward-looking half, the passing-the-torch\nhalf. It is the part that forces a laugh at unfunny Dad jokes when Dad needs\nvalidation, and helps him feel useful assembling Ikea furniture. It\u2019s the part\nthat assures Mom that everything is okay and that the job is fun and that\nthey\u2019re going places and that they will land an art-history job with stock\noptions and that the stock options will pay off enough for a downpayment on a\nhouse anytime now.\n\nThis is the half of the story that\u2019s young people telling their parents they\nare Perfectly Normal Beasts, not disoriented and punch-drunk creatures from an\nentirely different economic planet who visit home through a time-space rift on\nThanksgiving.\n\nIt\u2019s why it\u2019s worth paying that premium dollar to reassure the parents that\nthe kids are alright. Because that\u2019s the only way the kids can know that the\nparents are alright, and will live out their lives relatively untroubled by\nfutile concerns they can do nothing to address.\n\nBecause the harsh reality is that the kids are largely on their own. They are\nbeyond the ability of parents to help.\n\nMy parents still think I\u2019m the reliably and steadily occupied suit-and-tie\nMcKinsey-type consultant rather than an opportunistic skirmisher on the edge\nof that world. They think I am a dead-trees type writer rather than a traffic\ngambler. They aren\u2019t entirely sure what a blog is. They think it\u2019s my hobby.\nWhen I tell them I made a bit of money investing, they think stocks, not\nblockchains. I\u2019m not even going to try explaining bitcoin to them. They don\u2019t\nneed the aggravation.\n\nThat\u2019s the half of the act that is only dropped when parents and other\nsignificant elders are either estranged or have passed on, and you don\u2019t have\nto pretend anymore.\n\nBut there\u2019s another half to the story, the part that\u2019s forward-looking and in\na weird way, constructive.\n\n## Reverse Reality Distortion\n\nWhat do you do when you find yourself coming of age in a radically unequal\nsociety, where the rent is too damn high, success is a serendipitous function\nof mysterious Internet trends your parents assume you\u2019ve magically mastered in\nthe cradle, and the only skill of unquestionable value \u2014 programming computers\nwell \u2014 is relatively hard to acquire and ideally suited only to a minority\nneurotype?\n\nAnd just to make things interesting, you are also saddled with debt from a\nwhite elephant college education your parents sincerely thought would be your\nticket to a good life and you were too young and clueless to avoid. And to\nmake it even more interesting, the entire economic engine of the Brave New\nEconomy requires you to avow belief in the reality of meritocracy and pretend\nluck plays little to no role.\n\nTo proclaim loudly that you think it\u2019s mostly luck is, ironically enough, the\nbest way to make sure you are excluded from the lottery.\n\nSo you fake it till you make it. Unless you don\u2019t.\n\nIf the rear-facing part of the theater of premium mediocre lifestyles is\ndesigned to reassure parents that everything is keep-calm-and-carry-on fine,\nand not falling apart, the front of the house is designed to reassure the\ncaptains of new economy that yes, their meritocratic utopia is being\nconstructed on schedule.\n\nThat there is a strong deterministic, learnable, and predictable relationship\nbetween striving and success; between legible merit and desirable outcomes.\n\nThat their playbook for a post-scarcity digital utopia is working as designed.\n\nThat the exceptional outcomes they enjoyed can become commonplace.\n\nThat there is not just a meritocracy in place, but that it is a broad-based\nmeritocracy, one where most people, not just 10x programmers, can get ahead\nthrough cunning plans rather than desperate gambling.\n\nThis part of the false consciousness crafting is not so much a bunch of lies\nas a bunch of helpful, premature exaggerations directed at movers and shakers,\na kind of collective visualization exercise. A kind of collective cheerleading\nto boost the morale of the heroic world-denters.\n\nThe wealthy do not actually want to be surrounded by a naked, devastated\ndystopia. They are not vampires who would enjoy the sight of environments\ndrained of life energy. They like to think they are simply winning the most in\na society that\u2019s winning overall.\n\nThe things they hope are true are all true. Just not quite as true as the more\ndeluded and tone-deaf among the fortunate like to believe.\n\nIt\u2019s like 90% true. We\u2019re 90% of the way towards the brave new world. Utopia\nis always just 10% away. It just takes the other 90% of the time to get there.\n\nThis idea of reverse reality distortion too, took me a while to figure out.\nSilicon Valley acknowledges the existence of the reality distortion field cast\nby the conjurers of new wealth. What it does not quite recognize is the\nreality distortion field that goes the other way: the theater of yes-your-\nplans-are-succeeding manufactured for the benefit of the leaders, so they\ncontinue trying to make the New Economy happen. It\u2019s quite fetch.\n\nBecause the New Economy isn\u2019t there yet. And building it is hard work. And\nsigns that the plans aren\u2019t working as smoothly as you think makes it even\nharder. The work needs cheerleading. Premium mediocre cheerleading suitable\nfor Instagramming.\n\nBecause you see, while it is somewhat important that everybody drink some\nkool-aid, it is absolutely crucial that the leaders drink a lot of their own\nkool-aid. The geese who lay the golden eggs must not be killed by despair at\nthe slow rate of progress. If they want to believe the wealth being created by\nthe new economy is largely a consequence of their brave, individual, Randian\nstriving, then that illusion must not be disturbed too much.\n\nThis little-recognized dynamic is why almost everybody gets the Episode of the\nAvocado Toast completely wrong. A clueless millionaire-next-door type, fooled\nby randomness into believing his own success to be a divinely ordained reward\nfor grit rather than a matter of survivorship bias, thinks avocado toast is a\nsubstitute for home-ownership savings. This means the premium-mediocre\nillusion-crafting is working.\n\nRejoice fellow-premium-mediocre locusts, our plan worked.\n\nThe Randian strivers will continue putting in their 100-hour weeks figuring\nout obscure crypotography and machine learning problems and 3d printed tiny\nhouses so our premium-mediocre free-riding gets just a little bit more\nsustainable every year.\n\nYou just have to laugh while you eat your salad alone. Except you\u2019re not\nalone. You\u2019re being watched by people who sincerely want you to enjoy your\nsalad so their work feels more meaningful. The emotional labor serves a\npsychological purpose.\n\nSmile, you\u2019re on millionaire Instagram.\n\nThis took me a while to understand because on the surface, all the illusion-\ncrafting and believing goes the other way. Steve Jobs hypnotized you, not the\nother way round, didn\u2019t he? Actually the hypnotism has always been duplex.\n\nWe help them believe the new economy is emerging faster than it is, they help\nus believe we are contributing more to it than we are, rather than mostly just\nfree-riding and locusting. This is consensual utopianomics at its best.\n\nThe movers and shakers of the new economy believe sincerely and strongly in\ntheir theories of how the world they are creating works. They have to,\notherwise they\u2019d be too demotivated to continue building it. They have to\nbelieve that merit is rewarded because they sincerely believe in rewarding\nmerit. They have to believe luck isn\u2019t that important. They have to believe a\nnew prosperity is taking root because they genuinely want prosperity for all.\nThey have to believe that more new wealth has been created than is actually in\ncirculation. That the rising tide is raising all boats faster than it actually\nis. That the new middle-class is bigger than it is. That 8 out of 10 can learn\nprogramming and make it rather than 2 out of 10.\n\nThat making it to the new world is a matter of grit rather than gambling.\n\nThat you\u2019re actually enjoying your premium mediocre salad beneath that method-\nacted Duchenne smile.\n\nSo you see, premium mediocrity is about faking it for them, so they can\ncontinue making it for you.\n\nThere are details here. You have to present yourself as an MVP \u2014 a minimum\nviable person. You need lorem ipsum filler in your performed life. Your entire\nexistence is a sort of audition waiting for somebody to replace the stubs of a\npotential life with the affordances of an actual life. You cannot afford to\nhave the stench of desperation about you, or visible signs of having been\ndefeated by the hollowing-out.\n\nSo you must laugh as you eat your salad.\n\nTo be picked to thrive, you have to show that you are already thriving and\ndon\u2019t need no stinkin\u2019 luck. You have a towel.\n\n## A Naked Call Option on Life Itself\n\nLike all escaped realities, the theater of premium mediocrity that serves as\nan MVP of post-industrial modernity in our Swedish-styled neourban cores is\nnot actually sustainable in its present form, but it could become sustainable.\nIt is something like a complex stack of individual and collective cultural\ndebt \u2014 in the sense of technical debt in software \u2014 embodied by what are\nessentially the wireframes of the new economy and the stick-figures navigating\nthem, rather than a fully functional UI.\n\nThis is fine. This is good. This is how agile software development of the new\neconomy should work.\n\nI was puzzled by the economic structure of premium mediocrity until I (re)read\nthis clever refactoring of technical debt as a naked call option. I wouldn\u2019t\nhave understood this as recently as a year ago, but with my newly acquired\npremium-mediocre cryptoinvesting savvy, and newfound cryptobourgeoisie\nambitions, I do.\n\nUnlike a covered call, which is about promising to sell what you actually own,\na naked call is about promising to sell what you don\u2019t actually own.\n\nLike wearing a nice sweatshirt, learning the lingo, and hanging out at a\nhackerspace with a code editor open, looking the part, but only scrambling to\nlearn a new skill if somebody actually hints they might want to hire you if\ntheir funding comes through in a few months.\n\nThat\u2019s selling a naked call option. Faking it till you make it. Ironically, it\ncalls for careful dressing up.\n\nLike any option, the naked call option that is the premium mediocre life has\nan expiry date. LARPing a non-role in a meritocracy-by-consensus has a burn-\nrate to it. At some point you have to drop the pretense, yield your place in\nthe lottery to newer players, and retreat to a cheaper small town and a life\nof below-the-API subsistence.\n\nBut there\u2019s a chance you will win the lottery.\n\nHuman beings are odd assets: they acquire the value the moment somebody\nbelieves in them. In this they are totally unreal, in the sense of Philip K.\nDick\u2019s definition of reality as that which does not go away when you stop\nbelieving in it. Humans come alive the moment somebody believes in them enough\nto invest in them. Ghosts that materialize within premium mediocre shells,\nconjured up by magical spells known as \u201cnon-sucky job offers\u201d.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised. There is a reason the Hollywood model is the\nreference for the tech economy. The only difference in the premium mediocre\nworld is that it is the waiting-tables part that\u2019s hidden from view, in the\nform of aggressive, invisible, price-shopping behaviors. It is the auditions\nthat are in public view.\n\nThe premium mediocre life is an immersive, all-encompassing audition for an\nactual role in the party that is the new economy.\n\nThis is necessary of course, to bootstrap an economy built out of larger\ncollective efforts, spanning hundreds or thousands of individuals acting in\ncoordination on increasingly weird new platforms. And there has been progress.\nMaking dollars driving Lyft is better than making pennies selling ads on a\nblog.\n\nBut we\u2019re not there yet. We\u2019re just 90% there, and the other 90% will get done\nany day now.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t want to take your chances in the lottery-locust economy of\nnaked call options that is premium mediocrity, you can try to be a Real\nPersonTM in one of two ways: being a hipster or a lifestyle designer.\n\n## How to Be a Real PersonTM\n\nIf we premium mediocre types in the metropolitan neourban cores of the\ndeveloped world are naked call options, your friendly neighborhood hipster\ndown the street and your friendly online-neighborhood vitamin vendor 12 time\nzones away are covered call options, but for smaller stakes. They largely only\nsell what they can already actually deliver. They do not like the high-\nrisk/high-return/short-runway premium mediocre life as a naked human call\noption in rent-is-too-high places. They tend not to dream too big, like hoping\nto own an actual house, unless they get unusually lucky.\n\nTo understand this, you have to situate premium mediocrity, which is a\nmainstream ethos, relative to its two marginal subcultural neighbors within\nthe same economic stratum: the hipster class to the left, and the lifestyle-\ndesigning Tim Ferriss class to the right.\n\nUnlike Maya Millennial, your friendly neighborhood artisan barista Molly\nMillennial actually cares enough about taste to log serious hours cultivating\nit. Molly Millennial\u2019s condition is sincerely aestheticized precarity. To\nforget, if only for a moment, the unsustainability of one\u2019s economic condition\nby making obsessively high-quality latte art, is to access a temporary retreat\nfrom awareness of your false consciousness.\n\nAnd at the other end of the spectrum you have the hustler, Max Millennial,\narbitraging living costs and, with a bit of geo-financial judo, attempting a\nBoydian flanking maneuver around the collapsing middle-class script.\n\nFour-hour workweek my ass. The Bali-based lifestyle designer people are the\nsecond hardest working people I know. Second only to hipsters avariciously\ncollecting and hoarding TasteCoins.\n\nWhether he sells over-the-counter vitamins, high-quality backpacks, or\ninternet marketing services, Max Millennial too is attempting to escape the\npremium mediocrity that his mainstream cousin has accepted.\n\nThough polar opposites in many ways \u2014 Max is mercenary and instrumental-\nminded, Molly is missionary and appreciation-minded \u2014 they are ultimately two\nsides of the same coin. Both are likely to be young, white (the premium\nmediocre class is relatively more diverse), and blessed with Boomer parents\ngiven to snide remarks about participation trophies and entitlement. Both are\nthrowbacks to an earlier Catcher-in-the-Rye anti-phoniness ethos. Both are\nlikely acutely aware of their privileges even as they navigate their\ndifficulties.\n\nNeither likes the idea of the performed life of a naked call option, of being\na shell waiting for a ghost to be conjured up within. Both seek substance. One\nseeks financial substance within reach of non-exceptional individual striving\nfar from white elephant student loans and high rents. The other seeks cultural\nsubstance far from centers of soul-sucking premium-mediocre consumption\ntheaters. Both work hard at acquiring real skills. Max Millennial can actually\nmarket on the Internet and make memes happen. Molly Millennial can actually\nguide you to better coffee than Starbucks offers.\n\nEach has a nemesis. Molly\u2019s nemesis is the basic bitch. Max\u2019s nemesis is the\nbasic bro.\n\nMolly and Max are fundamentally local-optimizing life-hackers, trading the\nmainstream casino economy for more predictable marginal ones with some\nsubstance. Both appreciate excellence and detest mediocrity. One optimizes for\ntaste and aesthetics, the other for effectiveness and financial leverage.\n\nBut here\u2019s the fundamental problem with Molly and Max: there is ultimately no\nguaranteed sustainability on the margins either. Max might retire early, but\nmust then face the void of meaning created by a decade of mercenary\narbitraging. Molly might find deep meaning in her knowledge of coffee, but at\nsome point the credit card bills will become overwhelming. Max and Molly\nsacrifice the small chance of big mainstream wins for a more realistic shot at\nfinding actual meaning or financial sustainability, but never both at once.\n\nThat is the tragedy of excellence on the margins; what Bruce Sterling\nevocatively labeled favela chic. Instead of individuals and specific\nexperiences being premium mediocre, it is a case of entire subcultural milieus\nbeing premium mediocre, in ways that are only visible from outside them.\nInside, things seem excellent. So long as you avoid asking tough questions too\noften.\n\nNeither Molly, nor Max, has accepted the bargain at the heart of premium\nmediocrity that Maya Millennial has, which is to refuse to deny either the\nneed for meaning or the need for financial sustainability. Which is why \u2014 and\nthis is definitely my attempt at supplying a redemptive account of Maya\nMillennial\u2019s choices as being fundamentally the correct ones \u2014 she chooses to\nfake both for a while in the hope of acquiring both for good later.\n\nBecause Maya Millennial, you see, is the basic bitch. A risk-taker who wants\nit all. Meaning and money.\n\nMolly thinks Maya has a taste problem; that she is a beyond-the-pale\nphilistine. But Maya knows she actually has a long-term financial\nsustainability problem and refuses to be in denial about it.\n\nMax thinks Maya has a skills problem; that she\u2019s a bullshit artist who cannot\ndeliver the twitter trends she pretends to understand. But Maya knows she\nactually has a long-term meaning problem and refuses to be in denial about it.\n\nMax and Molly can no more escape awareness of the false consciousness at the\nheart of Premium Mediocrity than Maya, but they have crafted temporary refuges\nthat make it easier to temporarily escape from whichever flavor of existential\ndread \u2014 lack of meaning and lack of financial sustainability \u2014 bothers them\nmore.\n\nOddly enough, Maya, she of the consciously worn mask and obviously premium\nmediocre theatrical life, is the most real person in this particular glass\nmenagerie. Molly and Max Millennial, so sure of their own authenticity, are in\nfact the robots with Real People Personalities,TM products of Sirius\nCybernetics. It is their pleasure to serve a fine cup of coffee for you, with\nartisan pride. Or a finely crafted marketing campaign for your fundamentally\nshitty product, delivered from Bali at a quarter of your local costs, with\nstoic grace.\n\n## Neourban Elegy\n\nThis post is, I suppose, in some sense, a sort of neourban elegy. In the past\nyear, we\u2019ve become so obsessed with hillbilly elegies and elaborate accounts\nof (and excuses for the Nazi shittiness of) the Lost Boys and Bartlebys of\nMiddle America who seek neither meaning, nor financial sustainability in any\nmeaningful way, that we\u2019ve lost sight of why we so-called bicoastal elites are\nthe way we are.\n\nWe\u2019ve almost started believing the hostile gaslighting accounts of our own\nhypocrisies as some sort of conspiracy of cruelty towards a brave Middle\nAmerica, where men are Real Men, women are Real Women, and avocado toast is\nReal Guacamole and Chips made by Real Illegal Mexicans.\n\nScrew that.\n\nAt the heart of premium mediocrity, underneath all the hustling and towel-\nbased-personal-branding, behind the luck-making and laughing-salad-eating,\nthere is a deep and essential kindness. Kindness towards parents. Kindness\ntowards the talented who work harder because they have found more meaningful\nwork to do. Kindness towards those unlike you in every way except willingness\nto play the premium mediocre fake-it-till-you-make-it MVP game. A cheerful\nwillingness to pronounce strange names and try strange foods, in the spirit of\nlearning your part in an emerging theater.\n\nYes, sometimes it means accidentally buying our own bullshit for a while.\nSometimes it means believing our own illusions for a while. That\u2019s not coastal\nelitism. That\u2019s not hypocrisy. That is the art of the premium mediocre\nperformed life.\n\nThose are the alternative facts of bicoastal life, facts that are part of\ntrying to invent the future, even if large parts of it look like poorly\ndesigned Hollywood sets peopled by bad actors.\n\nThis story, I think, has a happy ending. The stone soup that is the new\neconomy does create increasing serendipity. Just not as fast, and as\npainlessly, as the villagefolk \u2014 and here I mean techies \u2014 earnestly believe.\n\nThe premium mediocre gentry are the cultural market makers and stone-soup\ninstigators that the new economy needs to emerge. In the end, this is what the\nmuch-valorized hillbillies who want to fearfully retreat from the future don\u2019t\nget. That inventing the future means showing up to help sustain the fiction\nwhile it is being built out. It means taking risks to make money, meaning, or\nboth.\n\nEven if you\u2019re only an extra on the set playing a bit part, and paying high\nrents for the privilege.\n\nEven if you prefer not to.\n\nIt takes an entire gentrified neighborhood to raise a premium mediocre post\nlike this one.

Note most people don\u2019t see us 90% on the way to the new economy so\nmuch as clinging to the narratives of the old. Clear lack of vision on the\npart of the political class that could do a lot to accelerate and pioneer a\nnew economy that enables actual-broad-based-prosperity. Need more vision!\nHere\u2019s to hoping Jerry re-earns his moonbeam moniker in these last 15 months.\n\nAnd do watch this epic 1970\u2019s campaign tape if you haven\u2019t already:\nhttp://www.calbuzz.com/2010/11/excloo-long-lost-apocalypse-brown-tape-found/\n\n\u201cAnd in this survey, it noted that there\u2019s a lot of work to do. There\u2019s a lot\nof distrust, if you will, from these white working-class voters, who were\nDemocrats 20 years ago, 30 years ago, and do not trust the Democrats even on\nthe economy now. How did that happen?\n\nGOV. JERRY BROWN: It happened because the global economy is changing. America\nis losing manufacturing jobs both to foreign countries, but also to\ntechnology, automation, innovation, and all of that. So we\u2019re going through a\nreal transition. If you look at democratic countries around the world, whether\nit\u2019s South Korea or Brazil or in Europe, there\u2019s a lot of discontent.\n\nAnd that discontent is because, I believe, that the foundations, the very\nbasis of our expectations, particularly working people, people in the middle\nclass, people in more vulnerable positions, highly insecure. And what do you\ndo about that? They\u2019re skeptical of more government because governments in\npower have been presiding while people\u2019s life chances have deteriorated.\n\nIn America, college education has gone from essentially free to now we have a\ntrillion dollars of debt. Home prices are out of the reach of many people. And\njobs, downward mobility, insecurity, and all the rest of it. This is a global\nphenomenon, and Democrats have been the champion of working people, and they\nhaven\u2019t been able to deliver in face of these global trends. And, yes, you\u2019d\nhave to say that leadership has not been clever enough, or strong enough, or\nperhaps visionary enough.\u201d\n\n     * Venkatesh Rao says\n\nAugust 17, 2017 at 6:51 pm\n\nThe 90% line was a joke, linked to the 90% rule of software: \u201cThe first 90\npercent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time.\nThe remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the\ndevelopment time.\u201d\n\nie it\u2019s really 50%\n\nThanks for the link :)\n\n     * Y Nut says\n\nAugust 27, 2017 at 1:06 am\n\nGovernor Brown didn\u2019t have a monopoly on this insight. More likely, it was\nprovided to him. US government does have resources to inform itself. The\nmasses mistakenly waited for the government to care about them.\n\nUS Government did take care of the industrialized Japan and overall rising\nthreat from Asian Tiger. Instead of pushing them down or competing, they\nplayed the newly arrived capitalistic nation-states by stroking their ego into\nbetting even more on themselves. Like a great conman, US simply let them win\nwith eyes to the prize in the long run. Newly rich Japanese bought into all of\ninflated assets in US allowing US investors in the ponzi to escape with a\ngross profit, while leaving Japan holding the bag when prices eventually\nreset. See Pebble Beach ownership changes.\n\nChina is the new Japan. Buying real estate in US, out-manufacturing the US,\nbut the it will all repeat soon.\n\nSo US elites will continue to dominate the global order for another 50 years\nwhile Chinese economy stagnates permanently stuck in low profit margin\nmanufacturing. Vietnam is being prepped to take over Chinese role facilitated\nby PTT. Any jobs saved or not is simply an unintended benefit.\n\nThus, the condition of the masses of Americans is unknown. PTT was never about\nsaving American jobs from China, but containing China Inc. vs Fortune\n500....Americans will have to figure it out amongst themselves.\n\n       * Micha Elyi says\n\nAugust 27, 2017 at 2:43 pm\n\n> See Pebble Beach ownership changes.\n\nOh, that was pure Let\u2019s Gang Up and Screw the Foreigner\u2013the same game that\nMexicans have enjoyed playing on visiting American tourists for decades and\ndecades. Here\u2019s a recent round of the game.\n\n     * Micha Elyi says\n\nAugust 27, 2017 at 2:25 pm\n\n> In America, college education has gone from essentially free to now we have\n> a trillion dollars of debt. Home prices are out of the reach of many people.\n> And jobs, downward mobility, insecurity, and all the rest of it. This is a\n> global phenomenon, and Democrats have been the champion of working people,\n> and they haven\u2019t been able to deliver in face of these global trends.\n\nOk, let\u2019s suppose \u201cDemocrats have been the champion of working people\u201d and\nsincerely have good intentions about that. Subsidizing college for everybody\nballooned demand while supply was inelastic, resulting in costs with \u2018upward\naspirations\u2019. Let\u2019s suppose that Democrats didn\u2019t intend to put millennials\nover a trillion dollars in debt for mediocre college educations (is a state\nuniversity degree in liberal arts or general studies the premium mediocre\nversion of a high school diploma?), still that is what happened.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose Democrats subsidized home ownership for average people without\nforeseeing that this would inevitably push home prices out of the reach of the\nnext generation of average people.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose Democrats could never in a million years foresee that the taxes\nand government debt required to conjure cheap college, cheap mortgages, and\nmake-work jobs wouldn\u2019t result in problems with \u201cjobs, downward mobility,\ninsecurity, and all the rest of it\u201d.\n\nWith all these suppositions, I can only conclude that Democrats were foolish.\nStupid, even. Oops.\n\nWithout supposing all that, I can only conclude that Democrats were a\ncombination of crooks running a confidence game for marks that were themselves\ndishonest and thought they could cheat the cheaters. Evil, even. Oops again.\nNo, make that an uh-oh.\n\nThe free ride, the illusion that we\u2019ve almost arrived at the Land of No Work\nAnd All Play is almost over. Get ready to learn the hard lesson of Pinnochio,\nkids. Oldsters, you\u2019re in the wagon too. Everybody is about to turn into a\ndonkey and get worked very hard.\n\nRepublicans weren\u2019t meanies when they warned that everybody (or even a\nsizeable percentage of everybody) can\u2019t all jump up on the wagon and ride\nwhile fewer and fewer other people are doing all the pushing and pulling of\nthe wagon. We were realistic.\n\n       * Lee says\n\nAugust 30, 2017 at 3:58 pm\n\nI mean, you\u2019re not wrong, but Republicans also push supply-side economics,\nwhich is the financial equivalent of them peeing on your leg and telling you\nit\u2019s raining.\n\n         * Y Nut says\n\nSeptember 4, 2017 at 12:15 am\n\nCome on now....voters voted in ex-democrat Trump as a republican candidate and\nnow president, because they realized that Republican Congress is selling the\nsame tax and spend scheme just as democrats.\n\nBUT, even Trump can\u2019t drain the swamp. Not after hurricane Harvey. ...\nGovernment shutdown now tied to Harvey spending?....\n\nLook at Europe now....see how much governments can tax the productive labor.\nUS also has a special deal with Saudis which makes it even easier. 20% value\nadded tax, 60~70% tax on incomes, etc....all the while supporting royal\nfamilies in the 21st century.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, it is not the US middle class tax payers who\nare paying, it is the Chinese savers and Oil producers who are the suckers\nwhere only way to not be a sucker is to buy US assets which basically means\nthey can\u2019t escape the all mighty dollar as a reserve currency. This also means\nthat US Government has no incentive to stop printing. Until world war\nredefines the world order.\n\nChina is not Germany, Japan, Korea, nor Taiwan. They have nukes, they have\nmassive military, they have massive populations. It was a mistake to treat\nthem as a sucker. Unlike the Arabian upper class, Chinese elites will pursue\nrestoration of China as the center of the world.\n\n  2. Halikaarnian says\n\nAugust 17, 2017 at 11:36 pm\n\nI like your metaphorical dividing line of above/below the API\u2013my own weird\nbusiness ventures seem to churn around very close to that line.\n\nThe cultural aspects of this piece remind me a lot of some of my peeves with\ngeek culture in the past ten years or so\u2013the vast explosion in what the\nuncharitable would call fanservice pablum with better costumes, Game of\nThrones being only the tip of the iceberg. Not a few times I have excitedly\nsidled up to groups of people who are obviously familiar with a lot of the\ncultural material which provokes a lot of intellectual daydreaming and head-\nscratching for me, only to find that while they have read the books, there is\nan enthusiasm gap between they and I for the real-world implications of the\ncontents of those books. You bring up a perspective on this problem I hadn\u2019t\nconsidered: one can move into a cultural space in order to gain proximity to\nfuture opportunities just as surely as one can move to SF or NY and put up\nwith the CoL etc for the same reasons. That said, I\u2019m not totally convinced by\nthis interpretation, because the other and probably better argument is that\ngeek culture is just a bunch of Loser societies, in which mastery of\nsubcultural minutiae is a status symbol and a form of busywork.\n\nYour bit about the constant characterization of an extremely ad-hoc cultural\nzone as some sort of conspiracy against the \u2018heartland\u2019 is spot on, and\nneeded. If anything, I think you underestimate the amount of middle-aged\nBerniecrat delusions on this point.\n\nI think you have a problem, however, in ascribing conscious motivation to the\neffect upon the \u2018mover and shaker\u2019 class of a million premium mediocre types\nbrandishing their towels. After emphasizing the aspirational and essentially\npragmatic nature of the whole phenomenon, it seems like a bit of a leap to\nascribe the bolstering of the \u2018mover and shaker\u2019 worldview (which I agree, is\nabsolutely an *effect* of this phenomenon) to collective foresight on the part\nof the individual, essentially selfish towel-brandishers.\n\n  3. Lamar says\n\nAugust 18, 2017 at 5:53 am\n\nGreat article. One question.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Max Millennial just work as a salesman for his tech overlords?\nSeems BDRs are overlooked in the schema.\n\n     * Venkatesh Rao says\n\nAugust 18, 2017 at 8:47 am\n\nThose jobs are not easy to get and quite hard to do.\n\n       * Y Nut says\n\nAugust 27, 2017 at 1:09 am\n\nSales is the ultimate Loser\u2019s bargain....You either generate $1M of sales and\nget $50k commission or you are fired for failing to meet the quota....and your\nnext employer is only looking to hire winners.\n\n  4. Marc Hamann says\n\nAugust 18, 2017 at 6:55 am\n\nGreat post! It really resonates with my experience relating to my millennial\nfriends, and I hope this is start of a trend to stop bashing millennials and\nstart understanding and helping them.\n\nThe next thing we need to get over is the Blue vs Red thing. The epithet\nthrowing in both directions is like beggars arguing over the last crust of\nbread (Should we use it for avocado toast or PBJ?) The real problem is the\ndisintegrating social and economic contract.\n\nThe brave face of Premium Mediocre can only hold out so long. Pretty soon our\nsystem needs to get some There there.\n\nIf not... I\u2019ve read too much history not to know what kinds of things come\nnext...\n\n  5.

Then they began to climb and they\nwere going to the East it seemed, and then it darkened and they were in a\nstorm, the rain so thick it seemed like flying through a waterfall, and then\nthey were out and Compie turned his head and grinned and pointed and there,\nahead, all he could see, as wide as all the world, great, high, and\nunbelievably white in the sun, was the square top of Kilimanjaro. And then he\nknew that there was where he was going.\u201d\n\n     * Y Nut says\n\nAugust 27, 2017 at 1:23 am\n\nThere are 2 types of entrepreneurs:\n\n1) Delusional founders of modest means 2) Trust fund kids with hobby\nstartup.com\n\nAny one can be a winner. But the difference is that #1 will have incurred\ntremendous opportunity cost (forgone medical school) and #2 never needed a job\nanyway. But elites needed lots of #1s to take the risk they themselves\nwouldn\u2019t take because of poor risk/reward ratio.

Although this article is written in the American context,\ndoes the distinction between premium mexiocre and the old middle class still\nhold for countries such as China and India where a large middle class/ PM\nclass has only emerged in the past few decades? 2.

I\nwonder if there is any way to add evidence to that part of your story? It\nwasn\u2019t my experience at all that Kindness underpinned the world of the\nemerging new economy (I was in NYC mostly). The absence of it was a leading\nfactor in my \u201cretirement\u201d. It seemed to me that a deep and essential FOMO and\nlack of courage to pursue authenticity (*not same as \u201cmeaning\u201d) makes that\nworld go \u2019round, as opposed to a deep and essential kindness. It felt like you\nsort of took an easy dismount there, like \u201chow do I get out of this mess and\njustify the negative externalities? Kindness sounds great; who can argue with\nkindness?\u201d I\u2019d love to see a deeper critique of this mystical Kindness to\nwhich you refer. Maybe you have some links or resources?

Compared to the more absolute parochialism of\nprovincial, parochial trumpist type milieus, both NY are relatively willing to\naccept varied people and let them seek their own paths. Live and let live is\nkindness. Less kind milieus would have punished you severely for even\nattempting to quit the game.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason far more people escape from villages/small towns to cities\nrather than the other way around. The indifference or apathy is better than\nthe active oppressiveness of small town life for those who don\u2019t conform\nstrongly to the bubble reality.\n\n       * Sonny says\n\nAugust 23, 2017 at 10:12 am\n\nThanks Venkatesh!

What is a trumpist type\nmilieu??? 90% of the counties in the US? Come out to the Midwest. Kindness? Oh\nyou betcha, people are very kind. It\u2019s meanness that is preventing economic\nsuccess here, or Millennials from being able to contribute? No way. I\u2019ve lived\nin the blue coastal areas (DC and NYC), and I\u2019ll take here any day for day-to-\nday kindness and helping out others, in both business and living. Live and let\nlive is much more pronounced in the actual, real-life Midwest I live in (with\nboth the lefties at work and\u2013egads!\u2013the working-class \u201ctrumpists\u201d near home).\nPeople don\u2019t leave small cities in \u201cparochial\u201d areas because they\u2019re mean and\nparochial\u2013they tend to leave them because there are no more jobs here because\nof the very macro economics you are talking about. The mega-corporations based\non the globalist model are in the big cities, and it\u2019s where feeder jobs are.\nThey tend not to be in small farming or former industrial towns.\n\n       * Alan says\n\nSeptember 1, 2017 at 9:01 am\n\nYou might be right about bi-coastal types, but you don\u2019t understand rural\nAmericans at all. They are not like rural villagers in other countries \u2013 they\nare likely to have extended family across dozens of states and are frequently\nless provincial or parochial than many of the city-dwellers I have met. They\ntend to have a live and let live attitude, but they aren\u2019t going to validate\nyour actions if they think you are harming yourself. There is a great deal of\nkindness in rural America \u2013 more than I see in the cities, though there is a\ngreat deal there too. Perhaps you are just unable to see it.\n\n         * millennial says\n\nSeptember 1, 2017 at 12:50 pm\n\n\u201cSwung and miss\u201d is right. Bicoastal America is cut throat.

You discredit those who might steal your spot. Everybody knows\neverybody else in the industry and there is no room for \u201clive and let live.\u201d\nSuccess is about getting people the story they wang to he\u2019s and castigating\nthose who don\u2019t do it as well as you do. Add to that the general grumpiness of\nNew Englanders, the hollowness of Californians, and the puritanical tendencies\nof the Northeast... and bicoastal striver milieus are no place to be. There\nare very kind cultures in America. I have found them in Minnesota. On Oahu. In\nTexas. (And Houston is far more a \u201clive and let live\u201d city than any of the big\nmetrohubs on the far coasts...).\n\nVenkat speaks I guess of stuff he does not know.\n\n     * Matthew Carlin says\n\nSeptember 6, 2017 at 1:49 pm\n\nThanks, Sonny.

Dave Foster says\n\nAugust 23, 2017 at 8:11 am\n\nVenkat,\n\nWonderful piece. I think that the two-way, inter-generational ruse is pretty\nmuch an I\u2019m OK, you\u2019re OK kind of practicality in a society where self-\nactualizing \u201cmaking it\u201d goals are style/comfort measures in an otherwise not-\nlife-threatening context (for the majority). Did this type of useful deception\n\u2013 as all civilities are \u2013 exist in the New World emigration or Going West\nfrontier days? With opportunity then came often fatal danger. GDP is a\ntroublesome metric but it is a coin of the realm macro metric and a time\nseries shows an s-curve effect where the post-WWII expansion-meets-baby boom\nhas been flattening out since the 70s. It\u2019s a \u201cyou look great in that dress\u201d\nor \u201cyou were awesome in that kindergarten play\u201d kind of local family kindness\nfor somewhat bigger stakes. The two generations of buying single family homes\nwhich steadily appreciate and 30-40 years of working for a firm to build up a\ndecently paying-out pension in order to take painting classes and go on\nEuropean river cruises is a collapsing model. But it was an anomaly in human\nhistorical terms. There will be self-actualizing in the future but maybe with\nmore of a return to traditional multi-generational living arrangements where\nSonny or Missy spend part of their time reprogramming the Rossum\u2019s Elder Care\nRobots(TM) for ma/da/gran as one of many crypto currency gigs.\n\n  16.

Or maybe you are\ndescribing your own birthing pains into the next...phase 3) Thank you!

The millennial and\ngen-Xers don\u2019t care where your ancestors came from or who you sleep with; but\nI don\u2019t see where we are going or even can go. All the offered goals are still\npicket fence of some sort. No leader (authors and dreamers so comfortable\ncritiquing from the sidelines) can publicly confront the choices that are\nalready forced upon us. Some can predict doom or utopia, but How to navigate\nthe actual terrain?\n\n     * Chas C-Q says\n\nAugust 27, 2017 at 9:13 am\n\nAre we perhaps moving into a post-leader world, where Big Brother is just the\npublic face of the hapless faction with the best publicity and the biggest\nsh*t-stirring stick, and no real command of events?\n\n  17. skitter says\n\nAugust 26, 2017 at 1:26 pm\n\nHey Venkat,\n\nThis is great, though I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t arrive at a 2\u00d72: level of\nmeaning on one axis, financial stability on the other. Premium Mediocre bottom\nleft, Artisanal top left, Mercenary bottom right, Digital Utopia top right.\nPicture 1: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B65r-7V56ByPN0Zyd2wycEwwRWc\n\nDigital Utopia is there as the gold standard, even though the logic seemed\ninconsistent at first. The other odd aspect is the kindness dropping along\nboth axes as skill increases. I let the gradient run all the way diagonally to\nDigital Utopia, again just to see what would happen. Picture 2:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B65r-7V56ByPc2hrNEt1Yi1MQlE\n\nIt took some time trying to fold it along the kindness diagonal to figure out\nwhat the new axis components would be. Kindness to what must be unkindness\nspans both the financial and the meaning axes. (Edit: And I should have used\nyour term Financial Sustainability instead of Financial Stability)\n\nAs far as meaning, I really don\u2019t know how I would react or how society will\nreact to a non-zero sum Ctrl+C Ctrl+V utopia of literally unlimited resources.\nThere\u2019s more of a precedent for people finding meaning in the skills of\ncraftsmanship or profiteering.\n\nAnd do we actually want the Digital Utopia to be a meritocracy? Real-time\nmeritocracy is not kind. It would be a nasty, brutish, Social Darwinian\nsystem. Though every field requiring skill is somewhat meritocratic, they are\nnot reliably just. We\u2019re imperfect judges of the best person for each job.\nReputation accumulates, and those meritocratic features turn historic \u2014\nappealing to authority and aristocratic social capital.\n\nI want the Digital Utopia to be kind and financially sustainable even when\nwe\u2019re mediocre or worse. Small-m meritocratic at most, wary of circular logic\nor punitive measures from the deserving wealthy. The kindness line runs\nstraight from Premium Mediocre to Digital Utopia. A Digital Utopia can be\nmediocre, kind, and egalitarian. Picture 3:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B65r-7V56ByPbF9hNkh2WUJDc0k\n\nThat makes it seem much more achievable.\n\n     * Josephine Stewart says\n\nAugust 30, 2017 at 8:33 am\n\nBest comment is best.\n\nThe largest and scariest and oftest-avoided question concerning meritocratic\nutopias, digital or otherwise, is: Who decides merit, and according to what\nparameters? To follow: What happens to all the many millions of people who\ninevitably do not satisfy those parameters? Does the utopia tacitly\naccept/perpetuate the current effective decision, which is that anyone who\nfails to thrive does so based on their own lack of merit, and therefore\ndeserves whatever misery they land in?\n\nSo many of these intellectualizations seem to leave that question up to \u201cthe\nmarket,\u201d which has been answering it poorly. I am not confident that its\nanswer will get better once it masters its new way of growing. Humans and the\nmarkets they worship have proven themselves endlessly and inventively capable\nof finding the least compassionate, most unequal ways to distribute the net\nbenefits of progress. I don\u2019t see a sufficient reckoning with that, here. How\ndoes the eventual \u201cmeritocracy\u201d work? At what point is the anticipated utopia\ngood enough that people (at least partially) drop their fictions? How does\nthat supposedly more sustainable (rather than Just Richer) society deal with\nall the people who stop pretending when the unspecified meritocracy continues\nto leave them out?\n\n  18. Jacob Falkovich says\n\nAugust 26, 2017 at 5:52 pm\n\nI had a couple of thoughts about this, and then a couple more thoughts, and\nthen 20 more thoughts so I ended up writing a 3,000 word blog post about the\npremium mediocre life instead of just commenting.\n\nSorry\n\n  19.

Nature and economic realities trump power elites, but they get to\ndeploy the UMC to handle it with rewards being premium mediocre life just\nenough motivation to differentiate among the masses.\n\nPremium mediocre life = enough $ for college education, healthcare, safe and\ngood schools, and retirement so your children are available to lead the battle\nand not beholden to \u201cfamily obligations\u201d.\n\nThe conflict UMC experiences is due to having been to the sausage factory and\nactually understand enough to run in on behalf of investors.

McG says\n\nAugust 27, 2017 at 12:26 pm\n\nMy parents grew up during the Great Depression, and part of my formative years\nwere spent in subsidized public housing. I attended a four-year university in\nmy hometown because that way I could live at home. The idea of borrowing money\nto pay a tuition that today wouldn\u2019t even pay for a semester\u2019s on-campus\nparking even at that same school, would have scandalized my parents as much as\nit does me now.\n\nStill, if I had kids I would rather know that they\u2019re dealing with real\ncircumstances sensibly and practically, and not putting up a front to spare my\nfeelings.\n\nThen again, my wife\u2019s parents were of a far different background than mine and\nI saw many of these dynamics you describe, in her relationship with her\nmother.\n\n  22. Pamela J. Hobart says\n\nAugust 27, 2017 at 12:53 pm\n\nI finally read this... while eating a $5 almond croissant in a chain bakery in\nManhattan. It felt actually premium (or close), but what do I know.\n\nThe impress/console-the-parents aspect is most interesting to me, and probably\nsurprising to a bunch of young adults who take themselves to be freer of\nfamily obligations and expectations than any young adults who\u2019ve gone before\nthem. Plenty of motives are largely unconscious, and wanting to prove\nsomething to one\u2019s parents isn\u2019t completely separable from wanting to prove it\nto yourself and/or others, anyways.\n\nEven though premium mediocre makes enough sense now that it\u2019s in place and\nwidely observable, I am left wondering about its origins though. Why exactly\nthat, why exactly now? Plenty of parents are still better impressed by a\ndoubling down on the \u201csuccess sequence\u201d of credentialed education, work,\nfamily as compared to their kids\u2019 ~fancy~ tastes. You still hear plenty of\n\u201cwhen I was your age... (things were hard/bad/etc)\u201d with the implication that\nif you spend $5 at Starbucks while barely making rent, you\u2019re forsaking the\nmaybe-eventually-upwardly-mobile prudence that would still work if only you\ndid it right (this is sometimes simply blaming the victim of economic turmoil,\nbut it still gets said). Why is downmarket consumption (e.g. McDonald\u2019s\ninstead of Chipotle, Walmart clothes instead of Target) performative and\nironic instead of a responsible-seeming coping mechanism for economic limbo?\nIt could have gone either way, but tastes went premium mediocre instead.\n\nPart of the explanation might have to do with changes in family formation and\npublic/private breakdown. The love-based male breadwinner marriage is, in\npart, a technology for affirming & upholding separate but equal spheres of\nlife for men and women. Men are the mercenaries working out in public, women\nprovide the meaning in a private sheltered refuge of a home. For lots of\nreasons, that\u2019s fallen apart \u2013 love-based male breadwinner marriage was\nactually kind of a flash in the pan, though it\u2019s still prominent in\nreactionaries\u2019 minds. Inequality is now just as prevalent in personal lives as\neconomic ones. Those who manage to cash in on careers also tend to do way\nbetter at forming high-reward partnerships. And it still really matters where\nyou came from (c.f. \u201cDream Hoarders\u201d-type considerations). But the narrative\nhas still solidified that everyone can and should be doing/having it all as\n\u201catomized\u201d individuals. Some things are way too out of reach for these\nautonomous individuals right now, like home ownership. But a pretty good\nburrito, a pretty good mixed drink, a pretty good outfit can help to comfort\nyou while you bide your time, waiting to see whether you\u2019ll fail on meaning,\nfail on money, or maybe both.\n\n     * SAGReiss says\n\nAugust 30, 2017 at 9:02 pm\n\nI couldn\u2019t follow most of your argument because I\u2019m old and drunk and reading\non the phone.

John Waterton says\n\nAugust 28, 2017 at 12:15 pm\n\nYour points about simultaneously recognizing one\u2019s own precarious economic\nsituation while aspiring to something bigger and concrete, and the way that\nsuccess really is a lottery, really resonated with me. I\u2019m lucky enough to be\ninching towards some financial stability myself, but I really feel like it was\na lottery win to get my foot in the door. My first \u201creal\u201d job after graduating\ninto the wonderful job market at the height of the Recession was an entry-\nlevel tech job offered to me by a guy on the other side of the country who I\u2019d\nbeen \u201cInternet-friends\u201d with over tech topics since early high school, based\non an off-hand comment I made a year before in a casual conversation. I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nI\u2019m doing well enough now and think I\u2019ll even own a house in a decent\nneighborhood one day, between the day job and a side hustle. I\u2019ve been within\na week of falling off the balance beam into the wreckage crater of a start-up\nmore than once, though, and had to win the lottery each time to make it\nthrough. A friend passing my resume to a friend, repeat 3x until it found its\nway into the hands of a total stranger who happened to be a hiring manager,\nisn\u2019t skill. I might have made some of my own luck along the way, but it\u2019s\nstill luck.\n\nIt\u2019s made me appreciate, and display, a certain type of kindness.\n\nI hire my team now and I\u2019m looking for those people who are really trying hard\nand looking for their break to give them an opportunity the same way I got\nmine. A girl from rural West Virginia who needed a ticket to anywhere with\nroom for her brains and ambition. A smart guy with ticks in the wrong boxes\nlanguishing in a cube at a call center. A line manager with way too good of a\nbusiness sense trapped in a $35K per year job trying to support a family.\nSmart, hard-working people whose lives have been changed by someone noticing\nthem and saying, \u201cGreat job subsisting, but you can do better. Here\u2019s your\ncareer-track job with benefits.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the responsibility of all of us who won the lottery to help someone else\nwin. We might not all become millionaires and drive Teslas, but by reaching\nout and taking a chance on someone who sincerely wants to make it but hasn\u2019t\ngot their winning ticket yet, maybe we can at least keep the dream alive for a\nlittle longer before admitting defeat, moving back to the cheap small town,\nand living below the API.\n\n     * EverExtruder says\n\nAugust 28, 2017 at 12:56 pm\n\nAgree 100%.

Justin says\n\nAugust 30, 2017 at 3:26 pm\n\nWhile I appreciate most of the article, and there\u2019s a lot of insightful things\nabout the nature of the growing no-longer-quite-middle class, I think you link\npremium mediocre _far_ too strongly to aspiration and coded signaling.\n\nMy parents (and those of most of my friends) know we\u2019re not in super-strong\neconomic shape. Whenever they visit, they pay for all the meals, because they\nknow that they are (and will continue to be) on a more stable economic footing\nthan their millennial children. They\u2019re _also_ smart enough to know that we\nhave it better than those with _no_ jobs, who can\u2019t afford to pretend to still\nbe middle class. In other words, parents know that we\u2019re actually part of the\nprecariat, or barely a step above, and if our purchasing habits comfort them,\nit is not through illusion.\n\nLikewise, we have no illusions that the rich will miraculously give us high-\npaying jobs. I think this is probably actually a thing in Seattle, the Bay\narea, and NY, where serendipitous meetings could get you a job in a start-up\nor a tech giant? But remember that premium mediocre is a nation-wide thing,\nand it\u2019s especially common in the suburbs, where you will _not_ get a job that\npays well, and you (and everyone else) know it.\n\nI think that premium mediocre is 99% \u201ctreat yourself\u201d+\u201dI\u2019m not gonna look at\nmy budget, I don\u2019t wanna, you can\u2019t make me, LALALALALALAL.\u201d First off, you\nhave to accept that premium mediocre _is actually a better experience_ than\njust mediocre. Premium mediocre food _tastes_ better. Would it taste better in\na blind taste test? Sometimes; often not. But we do ascribe more enjoyment to\nthings that we pay more for. And superfluous frills, like the colors in a\nunicorn [insert food item of your choice] _do_ make people happy; people don\u2019t\nget enough bright colors most of the time! Starbucks _is_ better coffee than\nyou can get at most other places; snarky hipsters may disagree, but it\u2019s true.\nYou know why Starbucks is better? Because it has a _shitload_ of sugar in it.\nYou\u2019ll note that this is the same reason the smoothies at Panera are top-notch\npremium mediocre: lacking in fruit, with whipped cream on top. It _tastes_\ngood.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right about he avocado toast. A lot of premium mediocre is\nless-filling/more expensive for a good item. But what you miss is that _all_\npremium mediocre falls into this category: it\u2019s just that most of it not a\nbetter _item_, but a better _experience_. Chipotle and Veggie Grill are _way_\nbetter experiences than McDonalds or any other old-school fast food. They have\nbetter decor, they have better service, you can see the ingredients in your\nfood, and the food mostly looks like it does in the picture.\n\nWe all remember the famous marshmallow experiment, right? Where some kids were\nable to delay their gratification and get rewarded with _more_ sugar bombs\n(and had coping strategies to help them get through the temptation), and\nothers just ate the marshmallow right away? And how years later, the ones who\ncould delay gratification were in much better shape (financially,\neducationally, etc.) than the ones who couldn\u2019t?\n\nAre you familiar with more recent critiques of that study? E.g., kids in low-\nincome families are more likely to end up in worse shape (financially,\neducationally, etc.) than kids in high-income families? And if you live in the\nchaotic environment of a low-income life, delayed gratification often doesn\u2019t\nactually work, so taking the marshmallow right away is actually the _smart_\nstrategy, as it\u2019s the only way to guarantee you ever get any marshmallows at\nall.\n\nThat\u2019s what premium mediocre is about, at its core. We recognize that reality\nin America is truly depressing, even for what was the middle class (even\nthough we know we are riding a _ton_ of privilege), and we don\u2019t have any real\nhope of it getting better. We\u2019re taking that freaking artisanal marshmallow\n(or that all-marshmallow box of Lucky Charms), even if it\u2019s only slightly\nbetter (or different?) from the ones in the cheap bag from the cheap store,\nbecause we\u2019re going to wring every drop of fun/flavor/experience we can _now_.\nWe know the floor is going to fall out from under us, and we don\u2019t know how\nsoon, so we take what we can get.\n\nIf we think about the fact this economy is why we can\u2019t have nice things, then\nwe realize we can\u2019t have nice things, and that means we stop having nice\nthings. It\u2019s mentally much easier to just have nice things right now and\nsuffer the consequences later.\n\nPremium mediocre is not aspirational, or a sweet illusion: it\u2019s \u201ctreat\nyourself now, because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next.\u201d If we have\naspirations, it\u2019s the hope that automation brings some sort of revolution and\na shift to a universal basic income, not that we\u2019ll magically get picked for a\nlottery that most of us (all of us in the suburbs) are not actually even\nbuying tickets for.\n\n  40. SAGReiss says\n\nAugust 30, 2017 at 4:50 pm\n\n\u201cActually all the coffee at Starbucks is premium mediocre. I like it anyway.\u201d\n\nI like the article, but this passage explains the whole problem in a nutshell.\nI live in France. I spend all of my afternoons in a local cafe, where not\nsurprisingly they serve coffee. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s French roast. I don\u2019t\ndrink coffee. I drink liquor, cheap liquor, except for Chartreuse because it\nis indeed too good to be true. I think a cup of coffee in my home bar costs\n1.20 euros, about a dollar & a half. I don\u2019t think you could buy a glass of\nwater at Starbucks for a dollar & a half. So long as you keep buying stupid\nexpensive shit at chain stores, they will keep earning handfulls of money. If\ninstead you went to a normal restaurant where pop cooks & mom serves (or vice\nversa), The Olive Garden would go out of business.\n\n  41. John Cocktoastone says\n\nAugust 30, 2017 at 6:40 pm\n\nDid I miss it, or was API never defined? What exactly is it? Google just\nyields programming jargon and not even urban dictionary helped.\n\n     * Doucho Baggins says\n\nAugust 31, 2017 at 10:39 am\n\nThat was frustrating, I did not see it clarified either. Although the article\nwas thought provoking enough that I spent more time googling the terms,\nconcepts and people I was unfamiliar with than I did reading it. As far as I\nwas able to infer, API- \u201capplication program interface\u201d in this context refers\nto the social, personal and economic tools you need to clutch that\nprofessional lottery ticket he talks about. Here is a quote from a website\nthat came up from a quick Google search:\n\n\u201cThere are many different types of APIs for operating systems, applications or\nwebsites. Windows, for example, has many API sets that are used by system\nhardware and applications \u2014 when you copy and paste text from one application\nto another, it is the API that allows that to work.\u201d\n\nHis \u201cabove/below the API line\u201d is asserting that people with out those skills\nwon\u2019t be in position to get lucky enough to fake it till they make it. If you\nhave had to do anything online on a parent\u2019s obsolete device I think you can\nfeel the point he is making.\n\n     * TGracchus says\n\nAugust 31, 2017 at 11:42 am\n\nI had to do a bit of extra research, too. This article by Peter Reinhardt\nexplains the concept.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing disparity between workers who make the software (above the\nAPI) and those completing the tasks (below the API). Many jobs that can be\nparceled out via API will be vulnerable to robot automation, perhaps as soon\nas 2020.\u201d\u201d\n\n  42.

Chris Korda says\n\nAugust 31, 2017 at 3:58 pm\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating that despite all the soaring abstractions and\ngeneralizations, the word \u201cclimate\u201d does not appear anywhere in the post or in\nany of the replies. Yet the climate crisis is determining the future\nhabitability of Earth. We simply don\u2019t have time to repeat the Gilded Age and\nits ghastly consequences (Communist revolutions, two world wars, tens of\nmillions dead, etc.) I\u2019m reminded of Dan Miller\u2019s explanation\u2013in his talk \u201cA\nReally Inconvenient Truth\u201d\u2013of how climate change has exactly the right\ncharacteristics to be nearly impossible for humans to respond to in a timely\nand decisive way. To borrow his car crash analogy, we\u2019re already past the\npoint of avoiding a crash or even slowing down before impact; humanity is\ngoing through the windshield now. People can still ignore it because the\npoorest nations and classes are hitting the windshield first, but that won\u2019t\nlast. I\u2019m also reminded of Ted Kaczynski\u2019s essay \u201cShip of Fools.\u201d It really is\na failure of imagination. People find it hard to imagine that anything as big\nas Earth\u2019s climate could fail. I get that it\u2019s unpleasant to face the\nharshness and fundamental indifference of the universe as revealed by science,\nbut time is short. We either wake up and make it through the bottleneck\nsomehow, or we don\u2019t. Bacteria will be more than happy to pick up where they\nleft off before plants disenfranchised them.\n\n     * Christopher says\n\nSeptember 1, 2017 at 1:55 am\n\nI think this essay provides a set of pretty good reasons why this essay\ndoesn\u2019t mention global warming. Those dots might be a little hard to connect,\nI\u2019m not sure on the exact connection myself, but I will ask this:\n\nEveryone I know is sure that global warming is an extinction level event. What\nconcrete actions would you like me to take to turn things around, keeping in\nmind that I make $15,000 a year and am not enough of a saint to completely\nsubordinate my life to saving humanity?\n\nAlso keeping in mind that if we\u2019ve past the point of no return and we live in\na godless universe, clothing ourselves in sackcloth and ashes is a truly\nmeaningless gesture.\n\n       * Chris Korda says\n\nSeptember 1, 2017 at 2:33 pm\n\nRegarding \u201cconcrete actions\u201d you could take \u201cto turn things around\u201d: Firstly\nyou could not procreate. Anyone who eschews procreation deserves a pass on\neverything else, for the simple reason that non-procreation has a uniquely\nexponential effect. Unlike recycling, eating low on the food chain, biking,\nusing LED light bulbs, etc. all of which only reduce your environmental impact\nduring your own lifetime, non-procreation eliminates your *future* impact, all\nthe way out to the most distant geological time horizon. There is no other\nvoluntary behavioral change you could make that would have anything like the\nexponential impact of avoiding all of your potential progeny. While you\u2019re at\nit you could also adopt a vegetarian\u2013or better yet a vegan\u2013diet. This is\nsurprisingly easy to do and probably has the largest possible impact after\nnon-procreation. Regarding your income, non-procreation costs you nothing, on\nthe contrary assuming you live in the USA it saves you on the order of a\nquarter of a million dollars per child (see link below). In my experience\nvegetarianism and veganism also yield significant savings, despite massive and\nabsurdly illogical governments subsidies for the meat and dairy industries.\nhttps://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child\n\n  45.

Christopher says\n\nSeptember 1, 2017 at 1:43 am\n\nSo, I was linked here from Slate Star Codex, and uh, holy cow.\n\nSo, this works as a defense in that it explains why certain actions shouldn\u2019t\nbe understood as motivated by delusion, malice or stupidity, but are in fact\nrelatively sensible ways to combine self-preservation in a bad situation with\nsome level of kindness and outward thinking.\n\nIt kind of fails as a defense in the sense that you\u2019ve just written one of the\nmost terrifyingly plausible dystopias since brave new world.\n\nHere are two things that seem very, very bad to me.\n\n1: The magic is dying\n\n> Humans come alive the moment somebody believes in them enough to invest in\n> them.\n\nThis is why the premium mediocre lifestyle is probably psychologically\ndevastating in the long run. Because all of Maya Millenial\u2019s premium mediocre\nactions are rooted in this conviction: Almost nobody can believe in me enough\nto \u201cinvest\u201d in me and therefore give me meaning.\n\nMaya\u2019s parents sure couldn\u2019t; oh, they meant well enough, she feels like she\nowes them a pretense that they actually invested that magic in her, but they\ndidn\u2019t. Maya\u2019s friends are a bunch of premium mediocre strivers too. They\ncan\u2019t invest in her. Look at poor Molly, she\u2019s trying to get some kind of\nmeaning, some of that magic of being invested in through pride in her work. I\nmean, it\u2019s fine, she probably isn\u2019t cut out for the risks of finding real\nmeaning, and gosh there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, it takes all sorts, but\nMaya knows Molly works at Starbucks. You ain\u2019t getting blood from that Turnip\nno matter how hard you squeeze.\n\nUnder your own account, the most important magic is slowly draining out of the\nworld, until only a few people have it. Which leads me to my next point:\n\n2: Who has the false consciousness?\n\nIt\u2019s not Maya Millenial; she knows exactly what she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s not her\nparents, either; they love her, they hope things will work out, she and they\nboth agree not to notice the worry that underlies their every interaction, but\nin this case I agree that this is about hope, forward looking thinking and\nmutual spared feelings. Both sides collapsing into panic would be incredibly\ncounter-productive, so they don\u2019t, but, you know, mom and dad still pay for\nthe meals when they visit.\n\nSo who, in this narrative, is actually delusional, actually shielded from what\nis going on?\n\nIt\u2019s the people handing out opportunities, jobs, and the \u201cmagic\u201d that makes us\n\u201ccome alive\u201d. This is bad for two reasons.\n\nFirst, you\u2019re making the argument that the only way society can move forward\nto a positive new economy is if the people constructing the new economy are\npervasively and consciously shielded from the actual effects of their\npolicies. I don\u2019t know how they could possibly build something that functions\nif that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\n\nSecond, the galactic hitchiker is not depending on the person he fooled for\n\u201cmeaning\u201d or \u201cthe magic of another human being investing in you\u201d he is\ndepending on the other person for a toothbrush. The meaning comes from\nelsewhere, and here\u2019s the most important thing: The hitchiker\u2019s sense of\nmeaning doesn\u2019t go away if the strag tells him, \u201cBuzz off, I\u2019m not giving you\nanything\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Maya Millenial knows the only way she can get meaning in her life,\nthe only way she can come alive, is for one of the new aristocracy to notice\nher. The only way that aristocrat will notice her is if she is consciously\nfalse at all times around him.\n\nShe is aiming to extract meaning from a relationship which she has personally\nset up as completely based on falsity.\n\nThat is also likely to be psychologically devastating. And if I wanted to spin\noff into complete paranoia, what other strategies does that suggest for Maya?\nOne is for her to spin her wheels for as long as possible. Once Silicon\nValley-senpai actually notices her, she might be judged wanting, and kicked to\nthe curb, stuck working with that stuck up bitch Molly and enduring the pity\nof her friends. Better to just extend the premium mediocre lifestyle for as\nlong as possible, rather then face concrete knowledge that the tiny minority\nleft who can actually distribute meaning might decide you have none.\n\n  48. jld says\n\nSeptember 1, 2017 at 9:25 am\n\nI didn\u2019t care to read this until I saw it linked at Slate Star Codex and with\nboth praise and befuddlement.

Do you disagree with anything I said above?\n\n         * Venkatesh Rao says\n\nSeptember 4, 2017 at 11:02 am\n\nI\u2019ve appropriated a couple of your terms, but we neither share enough common\nground here, nor analysis goals, to meaningfully agree or disagree.\n\nYou remain on my \u201ctrack but don\u2019t argue\u201d list.\n\n           * Gabriel Duquette says\n\nSeptember 4, 2017 at 11:53 am\n\nIs it arguing if you explain how are analysis goals are different? I promise\nnot to argue that you should share my goals.\n\n           * Venkatesh Rao says\n\nSeptember 4, 2017 at 12:11 pm\n\nYes, at this stage of our respective projects. Let us punt to 2027.\n\n  56. A F Bunny says\n\nSeptember 4, 2017 at 4:02 pm\n\nTPPB does not follow standardized acronym formation...on purpose? I can\u2019t look\nat that acronym without thinking \u201ctoilet paper peanut butter\u201d and I have to\nstop thinking about that right now.\n\n\u201cThat inventing the future means means showing up to help sustain the fiction\nwhile it is being built out. \u201d\n\nDoes \u201cmeans means\u201d mean more than single usage?\n\n  57. Venkatesh Rao says\n\nSeptember 4, 2017 at 4:18 pm\n\nFor all those asking about API: the term stands for application programming\ninterface and has been used in this sense of a motif for automation for a\nwhile in the tech world. I\u2019ve now linked what I think is one of the first\narticles to use the term that way.\n\nAlso fixed the TBPB acronym typo and a couple of others.\n\n     * G Mo says\n\nSeptember 4, 2017 at 6:29 pm\n\n\u201cand has been used in this sense of a motif for automation for a while in the\ntech world.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been a programmer for 26 years \u2013 no, API is not used that way.\n\n       * Nolan Gray says\n\nSeptember 6, 2017 at 10:02 am\n\n\u201cOh no you dinnnit\u201d This comment was generated by an api that scrapes Diplo\u2019s\nsoundcloud comments and reposts them in other comment forms such as this one.\nI can\u2019t seem to find the handshake for humor though.\n\n  58. j m rowland says\n\nSeptember 5, 2017 at 4:47 am\n\nUsing nominative pronouns in objective cases (e.g., phrases like \u201cfor Phil and\nI\u201d) is a cut below premium mediocre \u2014 but you instantly bump it up into\ntextbook premium mediocre territory if you justify it in any way (most\ncommonly by saying \u201cthis is the way real people talk\u201d).\n\n  59. Eman Noname says\n\nSeptember 5, 2017 at 7:54 am\n\nI recommend you read this: https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Dumbing-America-Paul-\nFussell/dp/0786104244 It will fine tune your thinking on this and provide\nfurther perspective on the concept of \u201cPremium Mediocrity\u201d.\n\n  60. Fbdjdifhfhdhrvf says\n\nSeptember 5, 2017 at 8:17 am\n\nSome milennials saw the writing on the wall and pledged their bodies to the\nwar machine.\n\nSome got out and got either stable jobs as government employees, or lucrative\njobs as government contractors, all of which come with varying degrees of\nrestriction on both speech and public engagement (Hatch Act all the way\nthrough the highest security clearances).\n\nOthers got hurt.\n\n  61. Nolan Gray says\n\nSeptember 6, 2017 at 9:56 am\n\nLeave a comment lifted from Diplo\u2019s soundcloud. \u201cDamn bro this is tiiiight\u201d\n\n  62. Aptenodytes says\n\nSeptember 7, 2017 at 6:41 am\n\nHas anyone discussed the origins of premium mediocrity?\n\n     * Aptenodytes says\n\nSeptember 7, 2017 at 9:46 am\n\nAs in the phenomenon, not the concept\n\n  63. Brian Hewes says\n\nSeptember 8, 2017 at 10:12 am\n\nFascinating this is a POV I have not seen before and it reads rather\npositively. This should be a book in the vain of \u2018Bobos in Paradise\u2019.\n\n  64. Timothy Hawkins says\n\nSeptember 8, 2017 at 10:30 am\n\nPremium Mediocre is the Premium Mediocre alias for the term \u201cPretencious\u201d, a\nwell documented pre-millenial term...\n\n     * Ahmad Ragab says\n\nSeptember 8, 2017 at 10:14 pm\n\nSo, \u201cpremium mediocrity\u201d is definitely a kind of pretentiousness, but it\nexhibits at least two properties, I\u2019d argue, that naked pretentiousness\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily have, at least on Rao\u2019s account:\n\n1\\. Self-awareness 2. Self-abnegation\n\nSelf-awareness in that our beloved Maya intimately aware of her existential\nfinancial precariousness must perform pretentiousness to maintain the illusion\nof her striving, and display just enough conspicuous consumption to let us\nknow she means it, all the while jumping through the necessary lifehackery to\nkeep up those appearances.\n\nSelf-abnegation in that ultimately through some sacrifice to purpose and\nmeaning, that she maintains her pretentious existence to satisfy both the\nworld-weary concerns of her boomer parents and as a gesture to the theatre of\nmeritocracy for which we must all buy tickets to attend, and then lavishly\nrave about after over cocktails involving exotic fruits/spices.\n\n  65. Aptenodytes says\n\nSeptember 8, 2017 at 1:08 pm\n\nThat\u2019s certainly one way of looking at it.\n\n  66. Matt Kee says\n\nSeptember 8, 2017 at 3:49 pm\n\nI think Molly and Max have birthed premium mediocre news and premium mediocre\nscience \u2013 otherwise known as fake news and psuedoscience. Molly\u2019s narrative of\ncorporations and government and science conspiring to steal our quality of\nlife leads her to distrust everything. Max has found a way to package and sell\nthis narrative as clickbait. Max\u2019s clickbait narrative usually goes like this,\n\u201cscientist/doctor reveals shocking secret hidden knowledge that\ncorporations/government don\u2019t want you to know.\u201d\n\nMaya waffles back and forth on whether to believe premium mediocre news and\npremium mediocre science. Maya wants to believe these stories because the\nstories fit a narrative that everything in the new economy is not yet\ncompletely working and how the captains of industry in the new economy don\u2019t\nknow as much as they claim to know. Maybe maya believes the story today. Or\nmaybe Maya does not. But Maya always clicks.\n\n  67. JohnH says\n\nSeptember 9, 2017 at 8:27 pm\n\nSeems like there\u2019s a place in here somewhere for the ganjapreneurs. Not quite\npipe dreamers... some people will make a lot of money growing and selling weed\nand related products. Eventually MJ will become commodified and not worth the\nhassle but it\u2019s a unique opportunity in that the Feds basically prevent\ncompetition from the national, publicly traded corporate sector. Lot\u2019s of\nniches to explore. It\u2019s pretty fun, check out a podcast like Stoner or The\nReal Dirt.\n\n#### Blogchains\n\n    * Annual Roundups\n    * Book Notes\n    * Captain's Log\n    * Clockmaking\n    * Domestic Cozy\n    * Elderblog Sutra\n    * Fiction\n    * Into the Pluriverse\n    * Lexicon\n    * Lunchtime Leadership\n\n#### Subscribe\n\nGet new post updates by email\n\n#### Crash Early, Crash Often\n\n#### Be Slightly Evil\n\n#### Gervais Principle\n\n#### Tempo\n\n#### Meta\n\n  * Log in\n  * Entries feed\n  * Comments feed\n  * WordPress.org\n\nReturn to top of page\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 \u00b7 Prose on Genesis Framework \u00b7 WordPress \u00b7 Log in\n\n", "frontpage": false}
