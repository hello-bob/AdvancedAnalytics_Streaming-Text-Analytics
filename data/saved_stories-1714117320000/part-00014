Edited by Travis.\n\nThe Nobel Prize recipient and father of modern neuroscience who was integral\nto our understanding of the neuron (Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal) did not credit his\nsuccess to intelligence. He pointed out that very intelligent people, like\neveryone else, are prone to bias. Instead, he credited his success to being\nable to admit errors and change his mind.\n\nAll of us make mistakes. By being willing to admit them, we enable ourselves\nto improve. By doing so publicly, we model to others that making mistakes is\nokay. And, perhaps paradoxically, by admitting our mistakes we can often build\ntrust, whereas adamantly denying them shows that we are not willing to learn\nand grow.\n\nIf we can build a healthy culture of admitting mistakes, then perhaps it will\nbe easier for us to admit our own mistakes as well. To that end, here are 10\ngreat cases of scientists and other experts admitting their mistakes publicly.\n\n## 1\\. A chapter is undermined in a best-selling book\n\nDaniel Kahnehman was a recipient of the closest thing to a Nobel Prize in\neconomics (The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Science in Memory of Alfred\nNobel) and he revolutionized our understanding of the mind. His critically\nacclaimed book Thinking Fast and Slow contains a great deal of insight, but it\nhas not been immune to objections. The chapter about \"social priming\" (the\nidea that behavior can be affected by subtle cues that you\u2019ve been exposed to)\ncontains the following emphatic endorsement of the effect of social priming:\n\n> [D]isbelief is not an option. The results are not made up, nor are they\n> statistical flukes. You have no choice but to accept that the major\n> conclusions of these studies are true. More important, you must accept that\n> they are true about you.\n\nBut this endorsement ended up drawing careful criticism from other researchers\nin a blog post. Kahnehman\u2019s response to this criticism was remarkable in that\nit freely admitted error and spoke candidly about how that error arose. For\nexample, here is a snippet:\n\n> I knew, of course, that the results of priming studies were based on small\n> samples, that the effect sizes were perhaps implausibly large, and that no\n> single study was conclusive on its own. What impressed me was the unanimity\n> and coherence of the results reported by many laboratories. I concluded that\n> priming effects are easy for skilled experimenters to induce, and that they\n> are robust. However, I now understand that my reasoning was flawed and that\n> I should have known better. [...] Clearly, the experimental evidence for the\n> ideas I presented in that chapter was significantly weaker than I believed\n> when I wrote it. This was simply an error: I knew all I needed to know to\n> moderate my enthusiasm for the surprising and elegant findings that I cited,\n> but I did not think it through.\n\nFollowing the controversy, Kahneman went a step further by writing an open\nletter to the research community engaged in priming studies. In this letter,\nhe urged them to conduct replication studies to address the shaky evidence\nbase on which some of the field's findings relied. He expressed concern that a\nfailure to openly address these issues would undermine the credibility of the\nfield as a whole, and encouraged researchers to take doubts seriously, not\nshying away from them:\n\n> To deal effectively with the doubts you should acknowledge their existence\n> and confront them straight on, because a posture of defiant denial is self-\n> defeating.\n\nKahneman's actions serve as an exemplar for how we can all deal with criticism\nconstructively and advance our fields or our lives by embracing, rather than\nshying away from, the identification and correction of errors. His call for\nreplication and his candidness about his own errors reflect an understanding\nthat science (and reasoning more generally) is a progressive endeavor,\nimproved not just through breakthroughs but also through the correction of\nmistakes.\n\n## 2\\. A launch Integration Manager at NASA takes blame for the Columbia\nShuttle Disaster\n\nOn February 1st, 2003, the NASA Space Shuttle named Columbia disintegrated\nupon re-entering the Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts aboard.\nThe tragedy was caused by a piece of foam insulation breaking off of the\nshuttle's external tank during launch and hitting the left wing, damaging the\nthermal protection system. This damage allowed hot gasses to penetrate the\nwing upon re-entry, leading to the shuttle's destruction.\n\nA public apology is not unusual in a disaster like this. What is refreshing is\nhow much the Launch Integration Manager, Wayne, took full responsibility. No\nexcuses given. No looking to shift blame onto others (even when others are\nalso at fault). This extract is from an email he sent to thousands at NASA\nafter he heard from an employee that none of the top managers took\nresponsibility:\n\n> I cannot speak for others but let me set my record straight: I am at fault.\n> If you need a scapegoat, start with me. I had the opportunity and the\n> information and I failed to make use of it. I don't know what an inquest or\n> a court of law would say, but I stand condemned in the court of my own\n> conscience to be guilty of not preventing the Columbia disaster. We could\n> discuss the particulars: inattention, incompetence, distraction, lack of\n> conviction, lack of understanding, a lack of backbone, laziness. The bottom\n> line is that I failed to understand what I was being told; I failed to stand\n> up and be counted. Therefore look no further; I am guilty of allowing\n> Columbia to crash.\n\nIt is admirable that Wayne was willing to do this. Even though he was not\nsolely responsible for the event, he took responsibility for his role in it.\n\nAdmitting mistakes when nobody else will can be a daunting but deeply\nimpactful action. It requires courage and integrity, especially in\nenvironments where the culture may not support such openness. Doing so can be\na powerful way to lead by example, which can gradually help to shift the\ncultural norms within an organization or group towards greater transparency\nand accountability.\n\nFor a more in-depth exposition of the Columbia crash, check Wayne\u2019s blog\nseries After Ten Years.\n\n## 3\\. Sharing stories of medical mistakes\n\nBrian Goldman has experienced, first-hand, the damage and shame of a culture\nthat denies mistakes and expects perfection. Here is a snippet from his TED\nTalk, in which he discusses his experiences in the medical profession:\n\n> And over the course of the next hour and a half or two, she started to feel\n> better. And I felt really good. And that's when I made my first mistake; I\n> sent her home. I made two more mistakes. I sent her home without speaking to\n> my attending. I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do,\n> which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a\n> chance to see her for himself. And he knew her; he would have been able to\n> furnish additional information about her. Maybe I did it for a good reason.\n> Maybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident. Maybe I wanted to be\n> so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I\n> would be able to take care of my attending patients without even having to\n> contact him. The second mistake that I made was worse. In sending her home,\n> I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me,\n> \u2018Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this.\u2019 In fact, so lacking in confidence\n> was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker,\n> \"Do you think it's okay if she goes home?\" And the nurse thought about it\n> and said very matter-of-factly, \u2018Yeah, I think she'll do okay....\"\n\nUnfortunately, Mrs. Drucker passed away as a result of those mistakes.\n\nFrom Goldman\u2019s talk, we can learn about how the fear of admitting mistakes not\nonly stifles learning but also perpetuates a cycle of concealment and repeated\nerrors, which can have devastating consequences.\n\n## 4\\. A physicist announces a \u201cdiscovered\u201d planet is not real, during a\nconference\n\nIn the middle of getting ready for an astronomy conference, physicist Andrew\nLynne discovered a huge mistake in his work. He forgot to adjust for the fact\nthat the Earth's orbit is spherical as opposed to circular. This error would\nfalsify a major previous \u201cdiscovery\u201d of his: a planet orbiting a pulsar. It\nmeant that the planet he thought he had discovered wasn't really there. His\ndiscovery had already been published in the very reputable journal, Nature. At\nthe conference stage, Lynne announced his mistake. The crowd responded with a\nstanding ovation.\n\nWe often fear the results of admitting our mistakes. However, doing so shows\nintegrity, and that integrity can be met with respect and appreciation.\n\n## 5\\. Science Communicators on YouTube list their mistakes\n\nTom Scott and Hank Green are two of the most popular science communicators on\nYouTube, with a combined >17 million subscribers. They both recently posted\nvideos admitting their errors. Tom Scott\u2019s video lists everything he is aware\nof that his videos have gotten wrong in the last 10 years, while Hank Green\u2019s\nvideo lists a few significant lies he has believed and shows him reflecting on\nwhat he has learned from them. His reflections include the following lessons\nworth learning:\n\n> I will run to go fact-check something that I disagree with and I will not do\n> that with stuff that aligns with my previous conception of the world. That's\n> just going to be a bias that we all have to deal with and live with and work\n> through. And, yes, sometimes I feel like: What does it matter if somebody's\n> saying a graph is saying something that it isn't actually saying, or that\n> this graph is making people sort of active and excited and enthusiastic\n> about making the kinds of change I want to see in my country, even if it's\n> not right, what does it matter?\n\n> [...] But for who I am and where I sit and what I do, I have to attempt to\n> have a very strong alliance to the truth. And the incentives of the social\n> Internet's content recommendation systems make that hard for all of us. And\n> I don't know what to do about that \u2013 except to try very hard to have an\n> alliance to the truth. And also, in a year that is going to be bad, to touch\n> as much grass as I possibly can.\n\n## 6\\. An SEO giant gets SEO wrong and describes how he was corrected\n\nRand Fishkin is one of the biggest names in the history of search engine\noptimization (SEO). He had argued that keyword weight can be used to determine\nthe importance of a term in a document and to optimize the text. Another SEO\nexpert, Dr. Garcia, responded by explaining how this won\u2019t work. As a result,\nFishkin wrote a blog post entitled \"Admitting I was wrong\" which explained\nwhat happened.\n\n## 7\\. Researchers pay people to find errors in their work\n\nPaying people who discover errors in one\u2019s work is an increasingly popular\n(though still quite rare) technique used to improve the research process and\nmake it more transparent. Some examples include:\n\nDonald Knuth was an early adopter of this process. He is a computer scientist\nwho has been rewarding people who find mistakes in his books with cheques,\nsince 1968. Due to financial security reasons related to people posting their\ncheques online, the reward has been changed to symbolic cheques from a\nfictional bank called \u201cThe Bank of San Serriffe\u201d. You can find the names of\nthe award recipients from 2006 to the present here (949 payments are listed at\nthe time of writing, April 2023).\n\nStuart Ritchie is a Scottish psychologist who incentivizes readers to find\nmistakes in his books through a financial reward. In one mistake that he\nlabeled as \u2018major\u2019 (and paid out \u00a350 for), Ritchie had claimed that nobody had\nattempted a replication of Diederik Stapel\u2019s findings before they were\ndiscovered as fraudulent. In reality, some people attempted to replicate his\nwork before the discovery but their failed replication wasn\u2019t published until\nafter.\n\nThe Red Team Challenge: A group of scientists (Nicholas A. Coles, Leo Tiokhin,\nRuben Arslan, Patrick Forscher, Anne Scheel, & Dani\u00ebl Lakens) offered $3,000\nfor a fault-finding team to join their study. The team would consist of 5\npeople whose job is to find mistakes in their study. In addition, every\n\u201ccritical problem\u201d found would lead to another $100 donation to a GiveWell top\ncharity.\n\n## 8\\. A professor critiques 57 of his own papers in a thread on X\n\nProfessor Nick Holmes created a thread on X to critique his previous papers.\nThe most serious critique is regarding his FMRI study:\n\n> Design was not optimal; was based too much on my behavioral expts[sic]. The\n> effects are weak, the whole-brain analysis failed & it relied on region-of-\n> interest analysis. I doubt it would replicate.\n\nHolmes elaborates in a later interview:\n\n> My only FMRI [functional magnetic resonance imaging] paper so far\u2014I wouldn\u2019t\n> mind if that was stricken from the record. It was all quite open and I\u2019ve\n> been happy to share the data on it. In my series of tweets, I said that I\n> doubted it would replicate and that the effects are quite weak. And I hadn\u2019t\n> pre-specified the analysis I ended up doing in advance, which is not good\n> science. I don\u2019t think I need to retract it yet, although maybe someone will\n> ask me to do so. But I don\u2019t place great confidence in that result.\n\nHe wrote an article on the lessons he learned from creating the Twitter thread\nunderlining the need for creating a culture that encourages admitting mistakes\nin the scientific community: I critiqued my past papers on social media \u2014\nhere\u2019s what I learnt.\n\n## 9\\. Retraction Watch: Doing the Right Thing\n\nThe blog retraction watch has a category called doing the right thing where\ngood behavior (including admitting mistakes and requesting the retraction of\nyour articles) is highlighted and celebrated.\n\nA recent example comes from Andrew P. Anderson, a postdoctoral researcher,\nstudying evolution and sexual selection at Reed College. When he was contacted\nby another research team, to inform him that a finding in his recently\npublished paper appeared to be based on a calculation error, he went through\nall the emotions you might expect: unhappiness at the situation, feeling like\na fraud, hoping the other research team had made a mistake, etc. But once he\nconfirmed the error was real, he thanked them and went through the process of\ncontacting the journal, retracting the paper, correcting it, and resubmitting.\nThis can be a difficult process, and it\u2019s one that plenty of people find\nembarrassing, but Anderson has some words of wisdom that are applicable beyond\nscience:\n\n> People make mistakes and I\u2019m certainly no different. There are people and\n> procedures in place for correcting a paper. While not common, errors and\n> retract/resubmit seem to happen more than I realized as I was looking for\n> how to communicate with the journal about my situation. I got through it by\n> just telling myself this is how science is supposed to work.\n\nThis is true in all walks of life. People make mistakes. Even where errors are\nnot common, they probably happen more than you realize, and acknowledging them\nand correcting them is how good reasoning works.\n\n## 10\\. The Loss of Confidence Project: encouraging psychologists to announce\nthat they've changed their mind\n\nThe aim of this project was to encourage psychologists to admit when they no\nlonger stand by the results of their research. The project attracted quite a\nbit of attention but, interestingly, there were only 13 submissions. In an\nacademic paper on the topic, the founders of the project observe:\n\n> [T]he survey responses we received suggest that the kinds of errors\n> disclosed in the statements are not rare. Approximately 12% of the 316\n> survey respondents reported losing confidence in at least one of their\n> articles for reasons that matched our stringent submission criteria (i.e.,\n> because of mistakes that the respondent took personal responsibility for),\n> and nearly half acknowledged a loss of confidence more generally.\n\nThis suggests that potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of researchers\ncould have submitted loss-of-confidence statements but did not do so. There\nare many plausible reasons for this, including not having heard of the\nproject. However, we think that at least partially, the small number of\nsubmitted statements [only 13 were submitted] points to a gap between\nresearchers\u2019 ideals and their actual behavior\u2014that is, public self-correction\nis desirable in the abstract but difficult in practice.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCan you rise to the ideal of public self-correction? It begins with being able\nto admit to yourself when you are wrong, and that can be difficult. But being\nable to admit being wrong is the first step to avoiding that kind of mistake\nin the future (rather than repeating similar mistakes). As Richard Feynman\nsaid: \u201c[Y]ou must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool''.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to begin this self-correction process, why not start with our\ntool for learning from your mistakes:\n\nLaunch the Learning From Mistakes tool!Click Me\n\n## Recent Posts\n\nSee All\n\nHow to Spot Real Expertise\n\nUnderstanding the Progressive and Conservative Psyche\n\nUnderstanding the difference between credentialists and non-credentialists\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\u00a9 2018 ClearerThinking.org - created by Spark Wave\n\nbottom of page\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nEmail\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\n", "frontpage": false}
