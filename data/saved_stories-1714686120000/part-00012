Studying how the cosmos evolved is important to understand how it began\nand might end, and opens up further questions about dark energy, an unknown\ningredient causing our universe to expand faster and faster.\n\nTo study dark energy\u2019s effects over the last 11 billion years, DESI recently\ncreated the largest 3D map of the universe ever constructed, marking the first\ntime that scientists have measured the expansion history of the universe in\nthat early period. Such precise results have revealed unprecedented new hints\nabout how the young universe might have evolved.\n\nSeveral members of the Ohio State DESI Team. From left to right, Erik\nZaborowski, Chun-Hao To, Paul Martini, Peter Taylor, Klaus Honscheid, Andrei\nCuceu and Ashley Ross.\n\nDESI, an international collaboration involving more than 900 scientists from\nover 70 institutions around the world, is managed by the Department of\nEnergy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and includes large\ncontributions from its Ohio State members. Led by physics professor Klaus\nHonscheid and astronomy and physics professor Paul Martini, the group now\nincludes professors, research scientists, and graduate and undergraduate\nstudents from across the university.\n\nTwo Ohio State members, Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral fellow in astronomy and\nco-convener of the Lyman alpha science working group who led efforts to\nvalidate the instrument\u2019s latest results, and Ashley Ross, a research\nscientist at the university\u2019s Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics\nand co-lead of the group that prepared DESI\u2019s map for interpretation and\naccounted for changes in the instrument's performance, were integral to the\nrecent DESI discoveries.\n\n\u201cDESI looks at a wide range of times across the history of the universe and\nour work looked at some of those most distant measurements,\u201d said Cuceu. \u201cWe\ndid this by measuring a feature called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO),\nminute ripple patterns that the universe provides that indicate the\ndistribution of matter as it evolves.\u201d\n\nLarge-scale surveys have used BAO measurements as cosmic rulers to map\nuniverse expansion in great detail, as researchers can get a better grasp of\nhow dark energy may have stretched the universe at certain points and\ndistances in time by comparing how they ripple through space. In a study led\nby Cuceu, one team used them to confirm the accuracy of 150 artificial\ndatasets made to mimic DESI\u2019s first data release, eventually concluding that\nthe instrument\u2019s findings were accurate throughout many different cosmological\nconstraints.\n\n\u201cWe threw it at many different types of models and decisions across the\nanalysis process, and it always seemed to generate roughly the same end\nresult,\u201d said Cuceu. Their findings are monumental because they show that\nDESI\u2019s results provide tantalizing suggestions that call into question both\ntypical models of cosmology and scientists\u2019 current ideas about how physics\nworks, said Ross.\n\n\u201cOne of the experiment\u2019s goals is to essentially explore the nature of dark\nenergy and if it changes over time,\u201d he said. \u201cThese first DESI results offer\na hint that it might not be a cosmological constant.\u201d\n\nThis artist\u2019s rendering shows light from quasars passing through intergalactic\nclouds of hydrogen gas.

Marenfeld and DESI\ncollaboration\n\nDESI\u2019s first research findings are presented throughout multiple papers, which\ncan be found on the instrument\u2019s data documentation site.\n\nBeyond dark energy, DESI has also been used to study many other cosmological\nmysteries important for physics, such as the mass of important particles\ncalled neutrinos and how individual galaxies develop over time. Martini, who\nwas the instrument scientist for DESI during its construction and\ncommissioning, said that what makes DESI\u2019s results so groundbreaking is the\ndepth of the instrument\u2019s analysis.\n\n\u201cThe improvement that we have managed to achieve is really driven not just by\nthe fact that we have 10 times as much data as previous projects, but also\nthat we took time to really understand the steps and potential sources of\nuncertainty much better,\u201d Martini said.\n\nAs light from a distant quasar passes through gas in space, certain\nwavelengths of light are absorbed.

Rubin\nObservatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. As those instruments\ncollect more precise data and scientists get to work decoding their results,\nmany are confident that even more exciting pieces of the universe\u2019s ever-\nchanging cosmic puzzle will be revealed.\n\n\u201cIt is a really exciting result that could indicate a significant change in\nour understanding of the universe, and the fact that we see these hints about\ndark energy gives us fuel to keep going,\u201d said Honscheid, who is the current\nDESI instrument scientist and instrument operations lead. \u201cThe future looks\nextremely bright for DESI and other long-term experiments like this one.\u201d\n\nDESI is supported by the DOE Office of Science and by the National Energy\nResearch Scientific Computing Center, a DOE Office of Science user facility.\nAdditional support for DESI is provided by the U.S. National Science\nFoundation, the Science and Technology Facilities Council of the United\nKingdom, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Heising-Simons Foundation,\nthe French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), the\nNational Council of Science and Technology of Mexico, the Ministry of Science\nand Innovation of Spain, and by the DESI member institutions.\n\nThe DESI collaboration is honored to be permitted to conduct research on\nIolkam Du\u2019ag (Kitt Peak), a mountain with particular significance to Tohono\nO\u2019odham Nation.\n\n## Share this\n\nFirst year of DESI results unveil new clues about dark energy\n\nShare on: Twitter| Share on: Facebook| Share on: LinkedIn  \n---|---|---  \n  \n## More Ohio State News\n\nRSS feed - More Ohio State News (opens in new window) View all headlines -\nMore Ohio State News\n\nMay\n\n01\n\n,\n\n2024\n\n| 11:49 AM America/New_York\n\n### With huge patient dataset, AI accurately predicts treatment outcomes\n\nScientists have designed a new artificial intelligence model that emulates\nrandomized clinical trials at determining the treatment options most effective\nat preventing stroke in people with heart disease.\n\nRead more\n\nApr\n\n30\n\n,\n\n2024\n\n| 11:15 AM America/New_York\n\n### Protecting endangered monkeys from poachers, habitat loss\n\nThe Tai Forest Monkey Project has operated a research field station in west\nAfrica\u2019s Ivory Coast for 30 years, but on the one day since its opening that\nthe site was unstaffed because of conflict in nearby Liberia, poachers took\nadvantage \u2013 and killed 18 endangered monkeys.\n\nRead more\n\nApr\n\n29\n\n,\n\n2024\n\n| 14:30 PM America/New_York\n\n### Artist Laureate will bring community support to the state through theater\n\nWhen a group of visitors stopped by Kevin McClatchy\u2019s class earlier this\nmonth, he thought they were incoming students on a campus tour.
