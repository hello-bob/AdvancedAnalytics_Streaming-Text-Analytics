Now it\u2019s time for\nour hydraulic Atlas robot to kick back and relax.\u201d\n\nHydraulic Atlas has certainly earned some relaxation; Boston Dynamics has been\nabsolutely merciless with its humanoid research program. This isn\u2019t a\ncriticism\u2014sometimes being merciless to your hardware is necessary to push the\nenvelope of what\u2019s possible. And as spectators, we just just get to enjoy it,\nand this highlight reel includes unseen footage of Atlas doing things well\nalong with unseen footage of Atlas doing things not so well. Which, let\u2019s be\nhonest, is what we\u2019re all really here for.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to the history of Atlas than this video shows. Atlas\ntraces its history back to a DARPA project called PETMAN (Protection Ensemble\nTest Mannequin), which we first wrote about in 2009, so long ago that we had\nto dig up our own article on the Wayback Machine. As contributor Mikell Taylor\nwrote back then:\n\nPETMAN is designed to test the suits used by soldiers to protect themselves\nagainst chemical warfare agents. It has to be capable of moving just like a\nsoldier\u2014walking, running, bending, reaching, army crawling\u2014to test the suit\u2019s\ndurability in a full range of motion. To really simulate humans as accurately\nas possible, PETMAN will even be able to \u201csweat\u201d.\n\nRelative to the other humanoid robots out there at the time (the most famous\nof which, by far, was Honda\u2019s ASIMO), PETMAN\u2019s movement and balance were very,\nvery impressive. Also impressive was the presumably unintentional way in which\nthis PETMAN video synced up with the music video to Stayin\u2019 Alive by the Bee\nGees. Anyway, DARPA was suitably impressed by all this impressiveness, and\nchose Boston Dynamics to build another humanoid robot to be used for the DARPA\nRobotics Challenge. That robot was unveiled ten years ago.\n\nThe DRC featured a [still looking for a collective noun for humanoid robots]\nof Atlases, and it seemed like Boston Dynamics was hooked on the form factor,\nbecause less than a year after the DRC Finals the company announced the next\ngeneration of Atlas, which could do some useful things like move boxes around.\nEvery six months or so, Boston Dynamics put out a new Atlas video, with the\nrobot running or jumping or dancing or doing parkour, leveraging its powerful\nhydraulics to impress us every single time. There was really nothing like\nhydraulic Atlas in terms of dynamic performance, and you could argue that\nthere still isn\u2019t. This is a robot that will be missed.\n\nThe original rendering of Atlas, followed by four generations of the\nrobot.Boston Dynamics/IEEE Spectrum\n\nNow, if you\u2019re wondering why Boston Dynamics is saying \u201cit\u2019s time for our\nhydraulic Atlas robot to kick back and relax,\u201d rather than just \u201cour Atlas\nrobot,\u201d and if you\u2019re also wondering why the video description ends with \u201ctake\na look back at everything we\u2019ve accomplished with the Atlas platform \u201cto\ndate,\u201d well, I can\u2019t help you. Some people might attempt to draw some\ninferences and conclusions from that very specific and deliberate language,\nbut I would certainly not be one of them, because I\u2019m well known for never\nspeculating about anything.\n\nI would, however, point out a few things that have been obvious for a while\nnow. Namely, that:\n\n  * Boston Dynamics has been focusing fairly explicitly on commercialization over the past several years\n  * Complex hydraulic robots are not product friendly because (among other things) they tend to leave puddles of hydraulic fluid on the carpet\n  * Boston Dynamics has been very successful with Spot as a productized electric platform based on earlier hydraulic research platforms\n  * Fully electric commercial humanoids really seems to be where robotics is at right now\n\nThere\u2019s nothing at all new in any of this; the only additional piece of\ninformation we have is that the hydraulic Atlas is, as of today, retiring. And\nI\u2019m just going to leave things there.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Boston Dynamics' Marc Raibert on Next-Gen ATLAS: \"A Huge Amount of Work\" \u203a\n  * How Boston Dynamics Is Redefining Robot Agility \u203a\n  * Q&A: Boston Dynamics on Atlas\u2019s Parkour Skills \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Atlas | Boston Dynamics \u203a\n\nboston dynamicshumanoid robotatlasroboticstechnology & computingartificial\nintelligenceconsumer electronics\n\nEvan Ackerman\n\nis a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum.

A team of\nexperienced engineers controlled each robot, and overhead safety tethers kept\nthem from falling over. The robots had to demonstrate mobility, sensing, and\nmanipulation\u2014which, with painful slowness, they did.\n\nThese robots were clearly research projects, but DARPA has a history of\ncatalyzing technology with a long-term view. The DARPA Grand and Urban\nChallenges for autonomous vehicles, in 2005 and 2007, formed the foundation\nfor today\u2019s autonomous taxis. So, after DRC ended in 2015 with several of the\nrobots successfully completing the entire final scenario, the obvious question\nwas: When would humanoid robots make the transition from research project to a\ncommercial product?\n\nKeep Reading \u2193 Show less\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nThe Institute Guest Article IEEE History\n\n## The Legacy of the Datapoint 2200 Microcomputer\n\n###\n\nThe machine laid the foundation for personal computers from Apple and IBM\n\nQusi Alqarqaz\n\nQusi Alqarqaz is an electrical engineer, engineering manager, and consultant\nwith more than 33 years of experience in the electric power industry and in\nthe analysis and performance improvement initiatives involving electric\nutilities.
