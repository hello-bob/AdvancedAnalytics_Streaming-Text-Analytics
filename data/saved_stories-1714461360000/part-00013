Their study\nidentifies a protein, AC3-AT, that acts as an \u201coff switch\u201d for BAT activation,\nlimiting its effectiveness in combating obesity.\n\nBy potentially blocking this switch, the researchers believe they can enhance\nbrown fat\u2019s activity, offering a new avenue for treating obesity and related\nmetabolic disorders. The findings, which also showed that mice without AC3-AT\nwere protected from obesity and had increased metabolic rates, suggest\npromising strategies for human weight management.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. Brown Fat Activation Limitation: The discovery of the AC3-AT protein explains why the calorie-burning effects of brown fat are typically short-lived, providing a target for prolonging its activation.\n  2. Protective Effects in Mice: Mice lacking the AC3-AT protein demonstrated resistance to obesity, less fat accumulation, and higher metabolic rates, indicating the protein\u2019s crucial role in energy balance.\n  3. Implications for Human Obesity: Given that AC3-AT is also present in humans, these findings open up potential therapeutic applications to enhance brown fat activity and support weight loss in humans.\n\nSource: University of Southern Denmark\n\nBrown fat, also known as brown adipose tissue (BAT), is a type of fat in our\nbodies that\u2019s different from the white fat around our belly and thighs that we\nare more familiar with.\n\nBrown fat has a special job\u2014it helps to burn calories from the foods that we\neat into heat, which can be helpful, especially when we\u2019re exposed to cold\ntemperatures like during winter swimming or cryotherapy.\n\nIntriguingly, this study not only identified AC3-AT, which is a shorter,\npreviously unknown form of the AC3protein. Credit: Neuroscience News\n\nFor a long time, scientists thought that only small animals like mice and\nnewborns had brown fat. But new research shows that a certain number of adults\nmaintain their brown fat throughout life. Because brown fat is so good at\nburning calories, scientists are trying to find ways to activate it safely\nusing drugs that boost its heat-producing abilities.\n\nA new study from the research groups of Prof. Jan-Wilhelm Kornfeld from the\nUniversity of Southern Denmark/the Novo Nordisk Center for Adipocyte Signaling\n(Adiposign) and Dagmar Wachten from the University Hospital Bonn and the\nUniversity of Bonn (Germany) has found that brown fat has a previously unknown\nbuilt-in mechanism that switches it off shortly after being activated.\n\nThis limits its effectiveness as treatment against obesity. According to first\nauthor of the study, Hande Topel, who is a Senior Postdoc at the University of\nSouthern Denmark and the Novo Nordisk Center for Adipocyte Signaling\n(Adiposign), the team has now discovered a protein responsible for this\nswitching-off process. It is called \u2018AC3-AT\u2019.\n\nBlocking the \u201coff switch\u201d opens up a new strategy\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, we think that finding ways to block AC3-AT could be a\npromising strategy for safely activating brown fat and tackling obesity and\nrelated health problems\u201d, Hande Topel says.\n\nThe research team found the switch-off protein using advanced technology\npredicting unknown proteins.\n\nHande Topel explains: \u201cWhen we investigated mice that genetically didn\u2019t have\nAC3-AT, we found that they were protected from becoming obese, partly because\ntheir bodies were simply better at burning off calories and were able to\nincrease their metabolic rates through activating brown fat\u201d.\n\nTwo groups of mice were fed a high-fat diet for 15 weeks, which rendered them\nobese. The group that had their AC3-AT protein removed, gained less weight\nthan the control group and were metabolically healthier.\n\n\u201cThe mice that have no AC3-AT protein, also accumulated less fat in their body\nand increased their lean mass when compared to the control mice\u201d, says co-\nauthor, Ronja Kardinal, who is a PhD student at the University of Bonn in the\nlab of Dagmar Wachten at UKB, continuing: \u201cAs AC3-AT is found not only in mice\nbut also in humans and other species, there are direct therapeutic\nimplications for humans\u201d.\n\nHope for strategies that support weight loss\n\nAlthough the prevalence of brown fat decreases as humans age, and despite\ngrown-ups not having as much brown fat as newborns, it can still be activated,\nfor instance by cold exposure. When it gets activated, it enhances the rate of\nmetabolism of these individuals, which again may help to stabilize weight loss\nin conditions where calorie intake is (too) high.\n\nIntriguingly, this study not only identified AC3-AT, which is a shorter,\npreviously unknown form of the AC3protein. The researchers also identified\nother unknown protein/gene versions, that respond to cold exposure, similar to\nAC3-AT.\n\n\u201cHowever, further research is needed to elucidate the therapeutic impact of\nthese alternative gene products and their regulatory mechanisms during BAT\nactivation\u201d, says co-corresponding author Prof. Dagmar Wachten, Co-Director of\nthe Institute of Innate Immunity at the UKB and member of the Cluster of\nExcellence ImmunoSensation2 and the Transdisciplinary Research Areas (TRA)\n\u201cModelling\u201d and \u201cLife & Health\u201d at the University of Bonn.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding these kinds of molecular mechanisms not only sheds light on the\nregulation of brown fat but also holds promise for unraveling similar\nmechanisms in other cellular pathways.\n\n\u201cThis knowledge can be instrumental in advancing our understanding of various\ndiseases and in the development of novel treatments\u201d, says co-corresponding\nauthor Prof. Jan-Wilhelm Kornfeld, University of Southern Denmark.\n\nThis study was conducted in the context of the DFG Collaborative Research\nCenter Transregio-SFB 333 \u201cBrown and Beige Fat \u2013 Organ Interactions, Signaling\nPathways and Energy Balance (BATenergy)\u201d, which is pursuing a better\nunderstanding of the different types of adipose tissue and their role in\nmetabolic diseases and the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Adipocyte\nSignaling (Adiposign) at University of Southern Denmark that aims to\nunderstand fat cell dysfunction in model organisms and obese patients.\n\n## About this obesity and neuroscience research news\n\nAuthor: Birgitte Svennevig Source: University of Southern Denmark Contact:\nBirgitte Svennevig \u2013 University of Southern Denmark Image: The image is\ncredited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Closed access. \u201cCold-induced expression of a truncated\nAdenylyl Cyclase 3 acts as rheostat to brown fat function\u201d by Jan-Wilhelm\nKornfeld et al. Nature Metabolism\n\nAbstract\n\nCold-induced expression of a truncated Adenylyl Cyclase 3 acts as rheostat to\nbrown fat function\n\nPromoting brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity innovatively targets obesity and\nmetabolic disease. While thermogenic activation of BAT is well understood, the\nrheostatic regulation of BAT to avoid excessive energy dissipation remains\nill-defined.\n\nHere, we demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3) is key for BAT function. We\nidentified a cold-inducible promoter that generates a 5\u2032 truncated AC3 mRNA\nisoform (Adcy3-at), whose expression is driven by a cold-induced, truncated\nisoform of PPARGC1A (PPARGC1A-AT).\n\nMale mice lacking Adcy3-at display increased energy expenditure and are\nresistant to obesity and ensuing metabolic imbalances.\n\nMouse and human AC3-AT are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, unable to\ntranslocate to the plasma membrane and lack enzymatic activity. AC3-AT\ninteracts with AC3 and sequesters it in the endoplasmic reticulum, reducing\nthe pool of adenylyl cyclases available for G-protein-mediated cAMP synthesis.\n\nThus, AC3-AT acts as a cold-induced rheostat in BAT, limiting adverse\nconsequences of cAMP activity during chronic BAT activation.\n\nTags\n\nBATbrain researchbrown adipose\nfatmetabolismneurobiologyNeuroscienceobesityUniversity of Southern Denmark\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
