Pirates?\n\nyesterday by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nHome\n\n> Piracy\n\n>\n\nIn an effort to tackle online piracy, Lithuania has been issuing \u20ac140 fines to\nonline pirates, catching several dozen people in the first few months. These\nearly targets were mostly movie pirates on private trackers. However, a recent\nannouncement revealed that audio copies of the classic self-help book \"The 7\nHabits of Highly Effective People\" are being watched too.\n\nLast summer, Lithuania amended its Code of Administrative Offenses, allowing\nmedia watchdog LRTK to fine pirates, without going to court.\n\nThis legislative change is the latest attempt to deter piracy in the European\ncountry. The potential fines should make pirates reconsider their habits, the\nthinking was.\n\n## Tracking Torrent Trackers\n\nOver the past several months, dozens of fines were handed out. The targets\nwere first-time offenders and all received the minimum fine of 140 euros. For\nrepeat offenses, fines can potentially reach 600 euros.\n\nThe early fines were almost exclusively issued to users of the private torrent\ntracker Linkomanija for sharing pirated films. However, the authorities have\ncast their net wider than that, a recent update shows.\n\nAccording to LRTK\u2019s latest information, it\u2019s also keeping an eye on users of\n\u2018private\u2019 torrent tracker, Torrent.lt. This site was once among the twenty\nmost visited websites in Lithuania and still has a dedicated user base.\n\n## A \u20ac140 Lesson\n\nThree of Torrent.lt\u2019s users were caught illegally sharing an audiobook of\nself-help classic \u201cThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\u201d written in 1989 by\nthe late Stephen Covey.\n\nThe book promises readers \u201cpowerful lessons in personal change\u201d but whether\nthe trio managed to improve their lives isn\u2019t clear. They were certainly not\nvery effective as pirates, however, as the book came at a cost.\n\nLRTK hopes that the fine will offer a powerful lesson too. Since the audiobook\npirates were all first offenders, who eventually apologized for their\ntorrenting habits, the lowest possible fine was deemed sufficient.\n\n\u201cSince the identified persons were sincerely sorry for the offense committed,\nthey were fined 140 euros, which they will have to pay to one of the\ncollection accounts of the State Tax Inspectorate,\u201d the media watchdog writes.\n\nThe print version \u20187 Habits\u2019 book was originally published by Free Press,\nwhich wasn\u2019t involved in the process. Instead, the enforcement action was\ntaken on behalf of a local rightsholder, the Lithuanian Audiosensory Library.\n\n## Effective?\n\nMore \u2018effective\u2019 pirates may use tools to hide their IP-addresses from\ntracking companies but, thus far, LRTK has had no trouble identifying\npotential targets.\n\nAlthough the catch rate is relatively low, and the fine somewhat modest, the\nwatchdog hopes that its enforcement efforts will encourage change. In any\ncase, it doesn\u2019t plan to stop its fining campaign anytime soon.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that LRTK constantly monitors in order to protect\ncopyrights on the Internet and reduce the scale of piracy in Lithuania,\u201d the\ngroup concludes.\n\n  * Next Post\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * Lithuania\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### Lithuania\u2019s \u20ac140 Piracy \u2018Fines\u2019 Will Pay Off, Lawyer Says\n\n  * January 4, 2024, 21:47 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### Lithuania\u2019s Media Watchdog Fines Over Two Dozen \u2018Private\u2019 Torrent Tracker\nUsers\n\n  * October 27, 2023, 21:11 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### Lithuania\u2019s Media Watchdog Issues First-Ever \u2018Fines\u2019 to Torrenting Movie\nPirates\n\n  * August 31, 2023, 10:09 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nTarantino\u2019s NFT Auction Goes Ahead Despite Miramax Copyright Lawsuit\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nTarantino\u2019s NFT Auction Goes Ahead Despite Miramax Copyright Lawsuit\n\nMeet the Guy Behind the Libgen Torrent Seeding Movement\n\nInternet Censors Came For TorrentFreak & Now I\u2019m Really Mad\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14983\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": false}
