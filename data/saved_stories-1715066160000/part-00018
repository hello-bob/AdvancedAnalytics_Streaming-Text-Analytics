Previous studies have found that exposure to\ne-cigarettes on social media is correlated with increased use.\n\nThe term \"e-cigarette\" refers to vaping products, synthetic nicotine products,\nand other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). In a new study, Jessica\nTran and colleagues reviewed ENDS-based content on Instagram for level of\nengagement among adolescent users, accuracy of the ENDS information presented,\nand adherence to federal and Instagram regulation policies.\n\nThe researchers examined ENDS-related Instagram posts in December 2023, using\na simulated 14-year-old female's profile to search hashtags such as #vapelife,\n#vapecommunity, and #ecig. The team reviewed 51 posts from these hashtags to\nassess the presence of health-related warnings and common themes.\n\nThe majority (34) of the 51 posts portrayed e-cigarette use in a positive\nlight, whereas 12 took a negative tone towards ENDS. The most common marketing\nstrategies used included appeals to aesthetics and lifestyle. Two-thirds of\nposts did not contain warnings regarding age restriction or the addictive\npotential of nicotine, in violation of FDA regulations.\n\nIn a breach of Instagram branded content policies, 23 of the 51 posts were\ncreated by vape shops or ambassadors, who serve as sales representatives for\nvape brands. Only 14 of the 51 posts aimed to educate consumers, with 30 of\nthe posts created for promotional purposes.\n\n\"Youth exposure to content about e-cigarettes and other ENDS must be curtailed\nby effective age restrictions and diligent enforcement of regulatory\npolicies,\" said Tran. \"Even more importantly, ENDS-related content must evolve\nto educate consumers about the potential health effects of e-cigarette usage.\"\n\nProvided by American Psychiatric Association\n\nCitation: Research finds e-cigarette content on Instagram violates policies,\nis marketed to teens (2024, May 6) retrieved 6 May 2024 from\nhttps://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-05-cigarette-content-instagram-violates-\npolicies.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
