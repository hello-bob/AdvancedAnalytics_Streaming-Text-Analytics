The dust shield is one of the payloads to fly aboard Firefly\nAerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lunar lander as part of NASA\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload\nServices (CLPS) initiative.\n\nPhoto credit: NASA/Cory Huston\n\nDefeating dust may be a small concern for most people on Earth, but for\nastronauts and spacecraft destined for the Moon or Mars, it is a significant\nhazard that must be mitigated. That\u2019s why researchers at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space\nCenter in Florida are seeking innovative ways to use Electrodynamic Dust\nShield (EDS) technology.\n\nUsing transparent electrodes and electric fields, EDS technology can\nelectrically lift and remove dust from a variety of surfaces for space\napplications ranging from thermal radiators, solar panels, and camera lenses\nto spacesuits, boots, and helmet visors. Controlling and removing the\nstatically-charged dust will be critical to the success of Moon missions under\nthe agency\u2019s\u2019 CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) initiative and Artemis\ncampaign.\n\n\u201cFor these CLPS and Artemis missions, dust exposure is a concern because the\nlunar surface is far different than what we\u2019re used to here,\u201d said Dr. Charles\nBuhler, lead research scientist at the Electrostatics and Surface Physics\nLaboratory at Kennedy. \u201cLunar regolith dust can get into gaskets and seals,\ninto hatches, and even into habitats, which can pose a lot of issues for\nspacecraft and astronauts.\u201d\n\nUnlike dust particles on Earth, dust on the Moon\u2019s surface is sharp and\nabrasive \u2013 like tiny shards of glass \u2013 because it hasn\u2019t been exposed to\nweathering and elements like water and oxygen.\n\n\u201cSimply brushing lunar regolith across surfaces can make the problem worse\nbecause it\u2019s also very electrostatically charged and highly insulating,\u201d\nBuhler said.\n\nBased on the Electric Curtain concept developed by NASA in 1967, EDS\ntechnology has been in development at Kennedy since 2004.\n\nIt first made its way to low Earth orbit aboard the NASA Materials\nInternational Space Station Experiment 11 mission in 2019. EDS technology was\nembedded in 12 different panels made of glass, polyimide, and prototype\nspacesuit fabric and sent to the International Space Station for testing in\nthe vacuum of space.\n\nBefore making it to space, EDS had been predominantly tested in vacuum\nchambers that produced promising results of removing simulants and samples of\nlunar regolith, collected during NASA\u2019s Apollo missions, from surfaces within\na second.\n\nMost recently, as part of Intuitive Machines\u2019 first lunar lander mission, EDS\ntechnology was embedded in two lenses of EagleCam, a CubeSat camera system\ndeveloped by students at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona\nBeach, Florida. Following landing, the EagleCam instrument successfully\ndeployed from Intuitive Machines\u2019 Odysseus lander. The teams at Embry Riddle\nwere unable to acquire images of the lander as they had hoped, but they were\nable to collect other data sets, including from the EDS technology.\n\nLater this year, another EDS technology demonstration is slated to land on the\nMoon as part of NASA\u2019s CLPS initiative mission with commercial partner Firefly\nAerospace.\n\n\u201cThe team has put in a tremendous amount of work and dedication. EDS is\nconsidered the leading technology and the best we have for the removal of dust\nfor space applications,\u201d Buhler said. \u201cTo fly as a dedicated payload on a\nmission to the Moon is very exciting.\u201d\n\nAccording to Buhler, EDS technology could be a first line of defense for\nestablishing an extended human presence on the Moon with future Artemis\nmissions.\n\nFrom its applications with protecting tools, machinery, and spacesuits, the\ntechnology could potentially even help improve day-to-day tasks by being\napplied to small components like gaskets, seals, and hatches. This could save\nastronauts the hassle of traveling to the Moon with extra cleaning supplies.\n\n\u201cEDS technology can be used outside of a habitat to help clean surfaces like\nrailings and floors, but it can be used inside as well,\u201d Buhler said. \u201cAll of\nthose applications are being evaluated and tested.\u201d\n\n### The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of\nhumanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\n  * About NASA's Mission\n\nJoin Us\n\n  * Home\n  * News & Events\n  * Multimedia\n  * NASA+\n  * Missions\n  * Humans in Space\n  * Earth & Climate\n  * The Solar System\n  * The Universe\n  * Science\n  * Aeronautics\n  * Technology\n  * Learning Resources\n  * About NASA\n  * NASA en Espa\u00f1ol\n\n### Follow NASA\n\n  * More NASA Social Accounts\n  * NASA Newsletters\n\n  * Sitemap\n  * For Media\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * FOIA\n  * No FEAR Act\n  * Office of the IG\n  * Budget & Annual Reports\n  * Agency Financial Reports\n  * Contact NASA\n  * Accessibility\n\n  * Page Last Updated:\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\n  * Page Editor:\n\nJamie Groh\n\n  * Responsible NASA Official:\n\nAbigail Bowman\n\n", "frontpage": false}
