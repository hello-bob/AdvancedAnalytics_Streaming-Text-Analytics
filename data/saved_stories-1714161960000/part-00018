By analyzing passive data from a large ISP, we find that\n> around 19% of end-users' privacy can be at risk. When we investigate the\n> root causes, we notice that a single device at home that encodes its MAC\n> address into the IPv6 address can be utilized as a tracking identifier for\n> the entire end-user prefix -- even if other devices use IPv6 privacy\n> extensions. Our results show that IoT devices contribute the most to this\n> privacy leakage and, to a lesser extent, personal computers and mobile\n> devices. To our surprise, some of the most popular IoT manufacturers have\n> not yet adopted privacy extensions that could otherwise mitigate this\n> privacy risk. Finally, we show that third-party providers, e.g.,\n> hypergiants, can track up to 17% of subscriber lines in our study.\n\nComments:| Accepted at ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, to appear in\nthe April 2022 issue  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Networking and Internet\nArchitecture (cs.NI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2203.08946 [cs.CR]  \n(or arXiv:2203.08946v1 [cs.CR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.08946arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Oliver Gasser [view email] [v1] Wed, 16 Mar 2022 21:13:57 UTC (399 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled One Bad Apple Can Spoil Your IPv6 Privacy, by\nSaid Jawad Saidi and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2203\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.NI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
