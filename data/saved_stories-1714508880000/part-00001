The updated\nmemory is slated to offer 25% better performance and 30% greater capacity\ncompared to existing mobile DRAM devices from the company. The new chips also\nappear to be tangibly faster than Micron's LPDDR5X memory and SK hynix's\nLPDDR5T chips.\n\nSamsung's forthcoming LPDDR5X devices feature a data transfer rate of 10.7\nGT/s as well as maximum capacity per stack of 32 GB. This allows Samsung's\nclients to equip their latest smartphones or laptops with 32 GB of low-power\nmemory using just one DRAM package, which greatly simplifies their designs.\nSamsung says that 32 GB of memory will be particularly beneficial for on-\ndevice AI applications.\n\nSamsung is using its latest-generation 12nm-class DRAM process technology to\nmake its LPDDR5X-10700 devices, which allows the company to achieve the\nsmallest LPDDR device size in the industry, the memory maker said.\n\nIn terms of power efficiency, Samsung claims that they have integrated\nmultiple new power-saving features into the new LPDDR5X devices. These include\nan optimized power variation system that adjusts energy consumption based on\nworkload, and expanded intervals for low-power mode that extend the periods of\nenergy saving. These innovations collectively enhance power efficiency by 25%\ncompared to earlier versions, benefiting mobile platforms by extending battery\nlife, the company said.\n\n\u201cAs demand for low-power, high-performance memory increases, LPDDR DRAM is\nexpected to expand its applications from mainly mobile to other areas that\ntraditionally require higher performance and reliability such as PCs,\naccelerators, servers and automobiles,\u201d said YongCheol Bae, Executive Vice\nPresident of Memory Product Planning of the Memory Business at Samsung\nElectronics. \u201cSamsung will continue to innovate and deliver optimized products\nfor the upcoming on-device AI era through close collaboration with customers.\u201d\n\nSamsung plans to initiate mass production of the 10.7 GT/s LPDDR5X DRAM in the\nsecond half of this year. This follows a series of compatibility tests with\nmobile application processors and device manufacturers to ensure seamless\nintegration into future products.\n\nSource: Samsung\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n  * ### Post Your Comment\n\nPlease log in or sign up to comment.\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n## 6 Comments\n\n### View All Comments\n\n  * #### NextGen_Gamer - Wednesday, April 17, 2024 - link\n\nTypo in title...

But how about\nputting two of these chips in a smartphone to support even larger LLMs? Reply\n\n  * #### The Von Matrices - Thursday, April 18, 2024 - link\n\nYou would need a larger smartphone chassis to do that. There's no space on\nsmartphone motherboards for a second RAM chip. Reply\n\n  * #### meacupla - Sunday, April 21, 2024 - link\n\n10.7GB/s is finally getting into impressive territory.\n\nThat's 171GB/s with 128-bit memory bus 256GB/s with 192-bit 342GB/s with\n256-bit 514GB/s with 384-bit 685GB/s with 512-bit\n\nThat's getting into GDDR6 territory for low to mid range GPUs. If M3 Max was\nequipped with this, it would be even faster than the 576GB/s on the PS5 Pro.\nReply\n\n## PIPELINE STORIES\n\n\\+ Submit News\n\nTSMC Readies 8x Reticle Super Carrier Interposer For Next-Gen Chips Twice as\nLarge As Today's TSMC Jumps Into Silicon Photonics, Lays Out Roadmap For 12.8\nTbps COUPE On-Package Interconnect TSMC's System-on-Wafer Platform Goes 3D:\nCoW-SoW Stacks Up the Chips\n\n  * TSMC Preps Cheaper 4nm N4C Process For 2025, Aiming For 8.5% Cost Reduction\n  * TSMC 2nm Update: N2 In 2025, N2P Loses Backside Power, and NanoFlex Brings Optimal Cells\n  * Report: Seagate, Western Digital Hike HDD Prices Amid Surge In Demand\n  * Seagate: Mozaic 3+ HAMR Hard Drives Can Last Over Seven Years\n  * Samsung Starts Mass Production of 9th Generation V-NAND: 1Tb 3D TLC NAND\n  * JEDEC Extends DDR5 Memory Specification to 8800 MT/s, Adds Anti-Rowhammer Features\n  * SK Hynix and TSMC Team Up for HBM4 Development\n  * AMD Announces Ryzen Pro 8000 and Ryzen Pro 8040 Series CPUs: Commercial Desktop Gets AI\n  * TSMC Posts Q1'24 Results: 3nm Revenue Share Drops Steeply, but HPC Share Rises\n\n## LINKS\n\n  * Home\n  * About\n  * Forums\n  * RSS\n  * Pipeline News\n  * Bench\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Contact Us\n  * Accessibility Statement\n\n## TOPICS\n\n  * CPUs\n  * Motherboards\n  * SSD/HDD\n  * GPUs\n  * Mobile\n  * Enterprise & IT\n  * Smartphones\n  * Memory\n  * Cases/Cooling/PSU(s)\n\n  * Displays\n  * Mac\n  * Systems\n  * Cloud\n  * Trade Shows\n  * Guides\n\n## FOLLOW\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * RSS\n\nThe Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997\n\n  * About\n  * Advertising\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.
