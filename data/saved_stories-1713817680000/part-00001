A lot of what we think of as internet culture is\nhappening on Discord.\n\nIn many ways, Discord represents a significant shift from what we now consider\ntraditional social platforms. It\u2019s not a public-facing network like Facebook\nor Instagram, and it\u2019s not really a broadcast medium for creators quite like\nYouTube or TikTok. But it\u2019s also not a forum in the way, say, Reddit is, where\nyou participate in big public threads curated by moderated communities.\nInstead, as you\u2019ll hear Jason describe it, Discord is a place where you talk\nand hang out with your friends over shared common interests, whether that\u2019s\nvideo games, the AI bot Midjourney, or maybe your favorite anime series. It is\na very different kind of interface for the internet.\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014\nand other problems. Subscribe here!\n\nJason and I dug into the nuances of how he sees Discord in the landscape of\nother platforms and how he\u2019s made conscious choices about what he sees as the\nfuture of online communication. For Discord, that future is smaller, more\nintimate, and far from the public eye. We also discussed the inherent tension\nbetween the version of Discord that acts as a tool for voice chat and the\nversion of Discord that\u2019s become a social destination mixing public and\nprivate in increasingly complex and, at times, legally fraught ways. We also\ntouched on the word \u201cservers\u201d and how it\u2019s played an important role in the\nkind of IRC-style culture the company was born in and still cultivates.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear Jason talk about Discord\u2019s evolving business model \u2014 unlike Slack,\nit never went into enterprise software. Instead, it has a consumer\nsubscription service called Nitro and a growing number of other ways it\u2019s\nexploring making money, including the platform\u2019s very first ads. Jason also\nrevealed why he ultimately decided not to sell his company to Microsoft for a\nreported $10 billion and also how the post-pandemic slowdown forced the\ncompany into two rounds of layoffs and a major refocusing effort about what\nJason thinks the Discord community wants and needs. The short answer: a bigger\ngaming focus and more outside developers building apps, bots, and games that\nlive exclusively inside of Discord.\n\nOf course, because Discord\u2019s users are so young, it faces some particularly\nunique content moderation challenges. You\u2019ll hear Jason reflect on his\ntestimony in front of Congress earlier this year around child safety and also\nwhy the company has made some pretty major tradeoffs around features like\nencryption that other platforms have been unwilling to make \u2014 because Jason\u2019s\nperspective is that they have to make the app safe for teens.\n\nThis was a fascinating conversation, and Jason\u2019s perspective \u2014 that online\nlife will only continue to move toward private group chats built around the\nways we spend our time with friends \u2014 looks more convincing by the day.\n\nOkay, Discord CEO Jason Citron. Here we go.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nJason Citron, you are the founder and CEO of Discord. Welcome to Decoder.\n\nThanks for having me, Nilay.\n\nI am really excited to talk to you. Discord is a seemingly very simple\napplication. It\u2019s also very complicated. It exists in a complicated ecosystem\nof things. There\u2019s a lot to talk about with Discord all the time. It started\nas a voice chat for gamers. It grew into a place where people hang out to talk\nto each other. What do you think Discord is now?\n\nNow, I think Discord is a place where people talk and hang out with their\nfriends online.\n\nA long time ago, I was talking to Stewart Butterfield \u2014 this is before he sold\nSlack to Salesforce \u2014 and I said, \u201cDo you think Discord is a competitor to\nSlack?\u201d He said, \u201cNo. Absolutely not. Slack is enterprise software. We do all\nthese enterprise logins. We have to deal with all this stuff at your company.\nDiscord is over there and that\u2019s different.\u201d I always thought that was\ninteresting.\n\nI think that\u2019s true. But the idea that one is very enterprise and one is very\nconsumer, that\u2019s gotten a lot blurrier since I\u2019ve had that conversation. I\nknow entire businesses that not only run in Discord but also talk to their\ncommunities, to their customers, in Discord. Has that gotten blurrier for you\nas well?\n\nWe have always focused on Discord as a service and tool for consumers to come\ntogether and talk and hang out. And it is used in many different ways, to your\npoint. A lot of companies use Discord almost as a new way to communicate with\ntheir superfans online. We love that and we support that use case. But most\npeople who use Discord are in smaller invite-only groups \u2014 we call them\nservers \u2014 with people that they know or friends of friends. It\u2019s a place that\nfeels like your dorm common room or your living room, where people are hanging\nout with people they know.\n\nThat server terminology is always really fascinating to me. I\u2019m somebody who\ncame up on IRC. The first tech website I worked for, Engadget, actually ran\nitself on IRC. We had to teach everybody how to use IRC when they got a job\nwith us, which is wild. Everyone\u2019s moved on from that now. But you\u2019ve kept\nthat terminology, that ethos, alive. You\u2019re starting a server. You\u2019re in\ncharge. Talk to me about that. Why keep that old-school terminology in play?\n\nWhen we started Discord, our focus was very much on building a text and voice\nchat app for people who played video games. Back in 2015, the alternative\nproducts that people used were, literally, they would host voice servers for\ntheir friends. The reason we picked the word server was because, at the time,\nthat was how our customers thought about what the tool was doing for them. It\nwas a server where they could go and bring their friends together.\n\nSo we said, \u201cWell, on Discord, you get a free server; whereas, on those other\napps, you\u2019re paying for a server.\u201d Now, our service runs in the cloud and\ndoesn\u2019t literally have a server the way that they used to rent computers and\nget IP addresses. So it just stuck. People understood the concept of a server\nas a place where you come together, and from 2015 to 2020 or so, Discord\u2019s\nprimary focus was on gaming. Even today, gaming is a huge part of what people\ndo on Discord. So people just get it.\n\nI asked that question very specifically because the word server, to me,\nimplies a bunch of control. As you\u2019re saying, you would go out in the world,\nyou would start a server, and it would be your own. But Discord is a platform.\nThere\u2019s an app store built into it. You\u2019re doing a bunch of developer\noutreach. It is the user interface for some very cutting-edge products like\nMidjourney. That control goes back and forth. There\u2019s what Discord the\nplatform wants, there\u2019s what users are doing with it, and there\u2019s what users\nmight do with it that you haven\u2019t even thought of. There\u2019s what they might\nwant to do with it that you don\u2019t want them to do. How do you think about that\ntension?\n\nOur focus is very much on creating tools that give people the capability to\ndesign their own space. That was part of the intention from day one. That\u2019s\npart of the server idea like you\u2019re talking about. We give you these tools to\nmake a server, and then you can choose: what are the text channels, what are\nthe voice channels, what do you want to name it? How do you want to decorate\nthe different people and have them stand out? We have permissions and role\ncapabilities where you can say, \u201cWell, these are admins and these are newbies\nand they show up differently in chat and they have different powers in chat\nabout who could kick people off and invite people on\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve always had this ethos of leaning toward user control of their spaces.\nFrankly, what\u2019s so cool about that is that it has extended to customizing\nDiscord with our API and bots platform because we knew that people were going\nto want to customize the service and connect it to other services outside in\nthe world. That user control and open ethos is what enabled things like\nMidjourney to flourish. There are over half a million apps that people have\nbuilt on Discord that are used across our user base, so it\u2019s a really\nintentional posture that creates conditions for exciting things to happen.\n\nHow much of the evolution of the product itself is guided by what people are\ndoing as they build applications and bots, and how much is guided by what you\nwant from it?\n\nWe take a mixed approach where we spend a lot of time talking with our\ncustomers of all different kinds trying to understand what people are doing\nwith Discord, what they want from it, and what their challenges are with it.\nThen, we mix that with what excites us as product creators and builders and\nhow we think the world is changing and where it\u2019s going and what we want to\ncreate for people. We try to put that all in a pot and shake it up, and then\nstuff comes out, so in some places, things that our bots community and apps\ncommunity have built have driven our roadmap. I\u2019ll give you one example. In\nthe early days, we had a hunch that Discord would be used for public\ncommunities like some of these we\u2019ve been talking about, but we didn\u2019t\nactually design that in a first-class way into the product.\n\nWhen we initially launched, I think the user cap was 30 or 50 people in a\nserver, for example. As people started using it for more public spaces, we\nkept raising the cap, which was infrastructure work to make the product work\nbetter. We had basic moderation tools, but it became clear that when you have\nthousands of people on a server, you need different kinds of moderation tools.\nA lot of bots sprung up, and that made us realize we needed to invest in this,\nso we created AutoMod, which is now built into the platform that allows these\ncommunities to moderate in much more advanced ways. Now, we have a whole trust\nand safety team. That whole effort was really a response to what people were\ndoing with our product that we thought might happen but weren\u2019t really sure,\nand it wasn\u2019t the original focus.\n\nLet me put that into contrast with, say, Reddit, which is another huge user-\ngenerated platform that is really driven by its community. There\u2019s a tension\nthere. There\u2019s what the community wants, the tools it builds for itself, and\nthere\u2019s what Reddit wants. Those things come to a head. They wax and they\nwane. Have you had those moments where you know that the platform needs to do\nsomething that will make the community mad but you need to do it anyway? Or\nhave you been able to integrate what the community is building in a more\nhealthy or more stable way?\n\nI think that one thing that\u2019s fundamentally different about Discord from\nReddit is that we are much more a group chat app for friends than this public\nspace with moderators and [user-generated content]. We don\u2019t think about\nDiscord as a UGC platform, for example.\n\nReally?\n\nI think about it as a communications app. It\u2019s a group chat app. If you look\nat where people are spending their time and what they\u2019re doing most of the\ntime, most people are texting in invite-only group chats with their friends or\non voice chat, playing games, talking about their day, cooking dinner\nseparately, falling asleep together. That\u2019s what people do. It\u2019s a place where\npeople talk and hang out with their friends, primarily. And then they do go\nexplore these other spaces in their interests and participate in these big\ncommunities. Some people really love that part of the service. But Discord is\na communications tool. It\u2019s not a UGC platform in the sense that I think\nyou\u2019re describing.\n\nI want to stick with that for one second because I think the difference is\npretty finely shaded. It\u2019s a communications platform, but it\u2019s not one to one.\nIt\u2019s one to many by default. You log in to a channel, you\u2019re talking to one\nperson, but you could be talking to lots of people. It\u2019s not encrypted, which\nI want to come back to. That\u2019s a choice you\u2019ve made to make sure you can\nmonitor what\u2019s going on. And because you\u2019re unencrypted and you can moderate,\nyou do moderate it. You do have a trust and safety function. What is the\nactual distinction between a communications platform and a user-generated\nplatform like Twitter or Reddit?\n\nWell, all communications are user-generated, so maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019re\ngetting at. But I think what I was reacting to is more what you were\ndescribing trying to make this comparison between Discord and Reddit, which is\na great product. People post content on Reddit and the content that people\npost for other people, usually strangers, is the primary thing that I think\npeople get from Reddit. Discord\u2019s very different. Discord is more like a group\nchat app where you\u2019re sending messages, frankly, often to one person. Direct\nmessages are very popular. Our servers are also popular. But in that case,\nit\u2019s like three to 10 friends. If you\u2019re playing a video game, it could be\nyour guildmates or the people you regularly play with or a club that you\u2019re a\npart of.\n\nIt\u2019s not a broadcast medium in the way that a lot of these other more social\nmedia-type services are. We do moderate it because we know that there are a\nlot of teens on the platform. When we do have those public spaces, we treat\nthat more like the public UGC stuff. But most of the time, people are hanging\nout with their friends in their virtual living room.\n\nThat\u2019s fascinating, and I want to come back to it because Discord is so many\nthings. Like I said at the start, you can look at it through so many different\nlenses. The idea of it just being a direct small group chat app, I put that\nright next to the fact that it\u2019s the user interface for Midjourney, which is\none of the hottest AI tools out there. And I say, \u201cWell, most AI tools are\ntext-based, they\u2019re prompt-based, and the chat interface is the way we think\nabout using most generative AI tools.\u201d Discord has become that interface for\nat least one of them. Is that a future that\u2019s in conflict with being a small\ngroup chat app, or is that the next extension? Or is that even something that\nneeds to go off in another direction on its own?\n\nI think that the fact that the chat input box has become the primary way to\ninteract with a lot of these generative AI tools and that we have a really\npopular and extensible chat input box is great. Midjourney is a really cool\nproduct and people love using it. They have one of the largest servers on\nDiscord, if not the largest server on Discord. But a lot of people actually\ntake the Midjourney bot into their invite-only server with their friends, and\nthey\u2019re using it there in a more creative space that is not in the public view\nor that is a server that you can just go join. I love Midjourney and the\nthings that other generative AI apps are on Discord, but for us, when we think\nabout the service that we\u2019re offering to users, it\u2019s a group communications\ntool.\n\nOne of the things that people do when they\u2019re hanging out with their friends\nis they play around with these generative AI products. They share their\ncreations with their friends, and they act as conversation pieces, as a shared\nexperience, to do together. From that lens, we love it, and that\u2019s why we\nencourage and support it, but we really come back to what most people are\ndoing on Discord most of the time, and that\u2019s chilling with their friends and\nhanging out. Video games continue to be a huge part of what people do every\nmonth on Discord.\n\nYou add this all up and you get this strikingly different view of what being\non the internet should look like. It\u2019s not whatever TikTok is turning into,\nwhatever Home Shopping Network Instagram is turning into. It\u2019s text. You\u2019re\ntyping a lot; you\u2019re looking at photos that are being generated; you\u2019re\ninteracting with other computer systems through text prompts. Discord is a\nwindow into that. You\u2019re maybe writing some applications that are inherently\ntext-based inside of Discord. But it\u2019s almost like a command line vision of\nconnecting on the internet. It\u2019s old school. Do you see Discord as being that\nbig, as in this is a different way of thinking about connecting and computing,\nor are we very focused on it as a chat app?\n\nThe way that we think about it and our vision for where we think the future\ngoes in regards to Discord, it really comes back to how people spend their\ntime with their friends. When I started the company back in 2012, the bet that\nI made was that video games would continue to become a bigger and bigger form\nof entertainment for people. They would become more and more social. They\nwould be across more and more devices and that there wasn\u2019t a great\ncommunications product that was started with your friends around gaming. So\nthat was the original thesis. Even today, when we picked our heads up after\ncovid to reevaluate what was going on in the world and what our customers\ncared about \u2014 we spent a lot of time last year with folks \u2014 I have more\nconviction today that [gaming] will continue to become the future.\n\nIf you go back over the last 12 years, it\u2019s really played out, and gaming has\nvery much gone mainstream now. I think 93 percent of Gen Z plays video games.\nWhen I was a kid, I was weird playing multiplayer games by myself or with my\nfriends, but it was a niche thing. Today, it\u2019s quite normal. Our vision for\nthe future is a world where people have really rich shared experiences, and\nthey can spend quality time with their friends no matter where they are in the\nworld. A lot of that is going to be video games that exist just on platforms.\nSome of those will be video games that we will serve directly through our\nplatform.\n\nThe bots platform, we\u2019re evolving it to include embedded experiences because\nthat\u2019s the part we think will matter. But it\u2019s really about this idea of how I\nthink the internet\u2019s going to evolve. There\u2019s a need for more cozy, intimate\nspaces where people can spend quality time with their friends away from the\nbroadcast performative stuff that we see a lot of. And we\u2019re very focused on\ncreating those cozy spaces for people to talk and hang out with their friends\nand deepen their friendships.\n\nThis is a theme I see everywhere right now that the United States is heading\ninto an election year: what is our social media going to do to us and what is\nit doing to teenagers? It\u2019s all colliding, and a bunch of these social\nnetworks are not ready to take the weight, or they don\u2019t want to. In the case\nof Meta, I don\u2019t think they want to. You\u2019re not positioned in that fight at\nall. You\u2019re saying, \u201cLook, the internet should go back to being smaller, more\nfragmented, more among people you know and less about these giant culture-\ndefining social media platforms.\u201d\n\nHow comfortable are you in that bet? I mean that in the big way, not the\nlittle way \u2014 you\u2019re the CEO, you have to say you\u2019re comfortable. But is the\ninternet actually moving in that way? Because I know a lot of people who want\nit to, but I\u2019m not sure that it actually is.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an either-or. Over the last 15 years, as we went from the\ninternet being new to Web 2.0 and now the rise of mobile, I think that we saw\na lot of this aspirational promise of these broadcast social media services\nand what they could do for us as people. I actually think they do a lot of\nreally great things. I think, 50 years from now, we\u2019re still going to have\nsomething like this. It\u2019s undeniable that all of these services create value\nfor people. I think there are questions we\u2019re working through as a society\naround some of the negative externalities of those things and how we want to\nmanage through that. But I think we\u2019re going to have public photo sharing and\npublic video sharing apps for the long run.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing on Discord \u2014 and I think this has been a trend for the last\nfive, six, seven years toward group chat messengers in general \u2014 is that\npeople understand that those public spaces are interesting, but there\u2019s\nsomething else that they want in their lives, too. That\u2019s more intimate, cozy\nspaces where you can spend time in a relaxed way with people you know and\nspend quality time with friends even though you can\u2019t maybe be in the same\nphysical space. I think that that is going to continue to grow, and I think\nthat the social media stuff will grow. I think both of these things will exist\nin big ways in the world if you go 20 years in the future.\n\nWhen you look at Discord right now, what part of it is growing faster? Is it\nthe small cozy spaces part, or is it the place where a bunch of crypto\nstartups talk to their customers? That was a big growth moment for Discord,\nbut that\u2019s the big public broadcast version of it. So is it the smaller cozy\npart that\u2019s growing faster, or is it the more public part?\n\nIt\u2019s the smaller cozy part. In fact, that\u2019s the part that\u2019s always been\ngrowing the fastest. The thing that we find that\u2019s interesting is, because\nit\u2019s not publicly out there, people don\u2019t really know about it so much. The\ncrypto thing was big and now the AI thing is big, and those things did bring a\nlot of people to our service. But at the end of the day, the people who come\nto our service and love it the most are the ones who come with their friends\nor find their friends and it ends up becoming this place where they hang out\nonline and keep in touch with the people that they care about.\n\nThat brings me to the Decoder questions. You\u2019ve described a lot of things\nDiscord could be, a sense that you need to focus, and the main thing that it\nalways has been and should be in the future. I want to ask you how the\ncompany\u2019s structured, but there\u2019s a little bit of context here. You did\nrecently have some layoffs. You cited the economic slowdown and your headcount\nwas growing too fast, so you cut 170 people, which is 17 percent of the\ncompany. You cut 4 percent previous to that. How is Discord structured now?\nDid these cuts change that structure?\n\nThe way that we\u2019re structured and those cuts come back to, \u201cWhat are we trying\nto accomplish and what are we trying to build for the world and for people?\u201d\nOver the last year in particular, I mentioned we spent a bunch of time going\nback into the market and talking to customers in a way we hadn\u2019t over the last\nfew years through covid to really refresh our mental model of what people are\ndoing [on Discord] and what they want from us. What we really clicked in on\nwas this insight that while we were focused on being more mass market through\ncovid, gaming actually went mass market at the same time as people grew up.\n\nBecause our service is so good for playing games with your friends, while\npeople do lots of things on Discord, what we realized was that gaming actually\nis still one of the main ways that people spend a lot of time with their\nfriends on Discord. I think it was like 95 percent of our users play video\ngames. Last month, 1.5 billion hours were spent playing games across Discord\non 60,000 titles, so people spend a lot of time playing video games.\n\nWhat that made me realize was that we should really focus on gaming because\nit\u2019s a huge thing that people do on our service, and there are a few billion\npeople that play video games in the world. It\u2019s the largest form of\nentertainment that\u2019s growing the fastest. I think we have a very unique role\nto play there, and we love it. Me, my co-founder [Stanislav Vishnevskiy], and\na lot of the people at the company grew up playing games, and games are such a\ncore part of our social lives and our best relationships. With that insight of\nsaying, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to focus in on gaming,\u201d we realized that we had too\nmany people at the company, and we were not focused on the right stuff. We\nwent through a reevaluation of what the next chapter of Discord was going to\nbe, and through that, we realized we needed to shrink the company a little bit\nand shift our focus.\n\nGoing forward, we are very focused on gaming as our core use case \u2014 group chat\naround gaming. But we\u2019re continuing to enable other things because people who\nplay games do lots of other stuff, and that\u2019s how we got here in the first\nplace. As a result of that, we are organized as a functional company, meaning\nwe have engineering, product management, marketing, finance, and talent. We\norganize functionally because Discord is one product. We essentially have one\nproduct. So we need to organize and coordinate in a way that it comes out as a\ncoherent experience for people. I talk about it like a symphony. Our people\nhear it as one song. Even though we have a hundred people playing instruments,\nwe have to coordinate it effectively.\n\nA functional organization allows us to do that, and then we break it into\nthree different types of work that we organize against. We call them our\nfoundational initiatives. This is the stuff that is the bread and butter of\nwhat we need to deliver on for our users, like performance, trust and safety,\nand core messaging and communication features. We have cross-functional teams\ndedicated to each of those with a design leader, a product leader, and an\nengine leader, and they have a roadmap.\n\nThen, we have what we call our core priorities. These are the step function\nthings that we\u2019re betting on. We have a few of these, and notably one of them\nis our new Quests feature, which we announced. We\u2019re getting into how we help\ngame developers bring their games to life and build their businesses. Another\none is our embedded activities platform that I mentioned, and then there are a\ncouple of other things in there.\n\nThen, we have a much smaller... I call it a venture initiatives team. It\u2019s a\nteam of six people that report directly to me, and this is the crazy\ninnovation lab where we\u2019re trying stuff that may never come to life, but it\u2019s\nthe bigger swings to see what we could create and innovate on for folks. So\nthat\u2019s how we organize the company, and we run it in an interesting way, too,\nwith Loom videos. I\u2019m happy to get into that if you want, but I\u2019ll pause.\n\nWell, two things. I definitely want you to get into Loom videos. That\u2019s the\nfirst time anyone\u2019s ever said that on the show, which is wild. How do you run\nthe company with something called a Loom video?\n\nLoom is actually a specific product that makes it really easy to do video,\nlike screencap and camera recording. But basically what we do is we run the\ncompany hybrid. We use Discord to run Discord. So we\u2019re all over the country\nin America. We\u2019ll get groups of people together to look at marketing plans or\nreview creative assets or product strategies or product demos. I found there\nwas a lot of coordination overhead around how to get a meeting together with\nall the people that want to be in the conversation. It was this chaotic thing.\nAnd we had this idea, \u201cWell, what if they recorded the presentation ahead of\ntime and sent it to me, and then I could just watch it in my free time? And\nthen I could respond with a video as well, so they could see my excitement\naround the feature and I could have their presentation up and be clicking\nthrough it.\u201d\n\nThat gets the initial presentation and reaction out of the way, and it turned\nout that we started doing this in just a couple of spots, and now it\u2019s\nbecoming this thing across the whole company where people record video of them\ndoing a presentation. Usually it\u2019s five, 10 minutes long, and then folks can\nwatch it. I often watch these things at 2x, sometimes when I\u2019m brushing my\nteeth. I always have free time, but I don\u2019t always have an hour to have a\nmeeting, and then sometimes I\u2019ll watch it two, three times, let it marinate in\nmy head, and then I will always have 10 or 15 minutes to just respond or\nreact. I essentially make a response video and send it to them. Then a hundred\npeople can watch it. They don\u2019t have to be in the meeting, and most of the\ntime then, we don\u2019t need a meeting. The communication happened and they can\ngo.\n\nSometimes, if we do need a meeting, we can get folks together. But we\u2019ve\nalready basically had a full brain dump back and forth, and it\u2019s just really\naccelerated our product development and creativity. I think it\u2019s also created\na more human connection between our employees because now we\u2019re seeing each\nother in video in these ways that is much more natural and casual that\nsometimes is missing when you\u2019re hybrid. So it\u2019s been really cool.\n\nAlright. You can\u2019t tell me about your crazy six-person renegade crazy idea\nsquad without telling me a crazy idea. What are some crazy ideas that you\u2019ve\ntried?\n\nI put the chip on the table so that y\u2019all know it\u2019s there, but the challenge\nwith talking about this stuff is that most of it is not going to see the light\nof day. Our users will be listening to this and they\u2019re going to hold me to\nit.\n\nReally?\n\nOh, yeah. If I say anything, they\u2019re going to hold me to it.\n\nI think my idea on my team is to have the worst ideas so that everyone else\ncan have slightly better ideas. What\u2019s one of your worst ideas that you would\njust never do that\u2019s obviously a bad idea?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure I have a lot of bad ideas. I just don\u2019t know which ones\nare bad before I try them.\n\nFair enough.\n\nThe creative process is an interesting thing. We find this a lot at the\ncompany when we build features. If you\u2019re trying to innovate, a lot of the\ntime, things that end up working seem like bad ideas upfront, and oftentimes,\nthey seem like bad ideas to people who are even really good at innovating. I\ntell this story that, when we were originally building Discord back in 2015,\nwe were a team of maybe 12 people at the time. Half of the people working on\nit thought Discord was a bad idea in a 12-person startup. It turned out to be\na good idea.\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to tell beforehand whether innovation is going to work. It\u2019s\nreally important to have space to try things, react to it, and innovate and\niterate to see where it takes you. Sometimes magic comes out the other end,\nand a lot of times, you just get duds. But we don\u2019t ship those. We try not to\nship them.\n\nHow big is Discord now?\n\nWe\u2019re 870 employees at the company. We have a little over 200 million monthly\nactive users all around the world.\n\nOne thing I think about all the time is when The Verge was small, we were able\nto try things and get rid of them really fast. We had a small team, everyone\nknew we were trying something, the vibes were shared, and we had a small\naudience, so we could get rid of things and only three people would ever know.\nNow, we\u2019re big and we have a big team. Some people are really committed to\nsome ideas; some people aren\u2019t. Some people can\u2019t tell from a Zoom call that\nI\u2019m on that I just want to see what happens. And then we have a big audience\nthat\u2019s paying a lot of attention to us, and it gets much harder to take risks\nand shut things down. Discord is in that spot. You have a big team. You have a\nhuge audience of people who care a lot. You won\u2019t even mention a bad idea\nbecause they will hold you to it. How do you think about taking risks?\n\nIt\u2019s a unique situation. Part of the reason I didn\u2019t say anything is because\nwe take an incremental approach toward exposing users to risk or to ideas\nbased on how confident we are in them. Practically speaking, what we tend to\ndo is launch features to very small segments of our user base and see how they\nrespond. But that even comes after what we call a closed beta or closed alpha,\nwhere we just recruit 50 people who sign an NDA to try something. Before that,\nwe use our employees. A lot of them are customers, so that\u2019s a free couple\nhundred users to test something. And before that, the team has to be confident\nin it. So there are these gates that things go through.\n\nIt\u2019s not a highly structured process because it depends on the thing. But we\nfrequently will eventually get to a point where we might, let\u2019s say, launch\nsomething to 50,000 people in our customer base and then let them try it, send\nthem a survey, see how they interact with it, and then, based on that, decide\nwhich way to go. While it can be frustrating for those folks if we, let\u2019s say,\nremove something from the product, we usually only remove something if it\u2019s\nnot actually that popular or useful. The funny thing about it is when we\nremove something, some people care, but most people don\u2019t, and that\u2019s why we\nremoved it. So it works. We don\u2019t remove something that a lot of people love\nbecause, if a lot of people loved it, we wouldn\u2019t remove it.\n\nDo you ever foresee Discord having the Microsoft Excel problem where someone\nhas built an entire business around one button in the toolbar and you can\nnever take it out?\n\nWe do have a lot of developers who build apps on Discord, and so we do think\nabout this around companies that have built these products and depend on\nDiscord to deliver their service and as a user interface for their service. We\nreally value that. To some extent, we already have this dynamic where people\nrely on us. Users rely on us, too, and this is one of the places where we get\na lot of friction with our users when sometimes we realize that a certain\nsegment of people really like the way something has been designed. Maybe it\u2019s\ntens of millions of people who love it. Then, we realize that there are 50\nmillion people or hundreds of millions of people who want something different.\n\nManaging that tension can be quite challenging because that\u2019s a case where\nmaybe we ship something that people loved, and now, it\u2019s years later and our\ncustomer base has grown. The dynamics have changed. Managing all of those\ncompeting interests is not easy, and sometimes we get it wrong.\n\nThis brings me to the Decoder question. You have a lot of decisions to make\nspinning stuff up, spinning it down, growing, focusing. How do you make\ndecisions? What\u2019s your framework?\n\nWe always just focus on our customers. We try to prioritize our customers \u2014\n\u201cwhat can we do to better serve people today than we did yesterday?\u201d Then we\ntry to mix that with \u201cwhat do we want to do\u201d and \u201cwhat are we excited about?\u201d\nBecause great things only come if the people who are making it are excited and\npassionate about it. We actually put a lot of stock in that, and then it\u2019s\nlike, \u201cHow do we build a great business and make money and do all that stuff?\u201d\nObviously, we\u2019re a company, so that\u2019s part of it. But I really do believe that\nover the long term, the best way to build a great business is to serve your\ncustomers really well. We just keep coming back to our customers and try to\nfigure out how we best serve the most of them. That really guides everything.\n\nIs that the tiebreaker in every scenario, or do you sometimes say, \u201cLook, I\u2019m\nthe CEO. I\u2019m just making this decision\u201d?\n\nSometimes the way actual decisions get made is, \u201cWell, we think 30 percent of\nour customers want this and 40 percent of our customers want that and 15\npercent want this, and how do you figure out which ones to listen to? How do\nyou even know if that\u2019s the right breakdown of what customers want?\u201d Sometimes\nwe look at data and we\u2019re like, \u201cWell, people don\u2019t interact with this, but\nthey tell us that they love it.\u201d So there\u2019s a lot of judgment that goes into\nmaking these decisions. We\u2019ve evolved this over time, but there are different\nmodels that people have around how to do this.\n\nWe essentially try to pick a single person who is the owner of making a\nparticular decision, and it\u2019s up to them to farm for dissent in the company\nand collect the insights that they have from customers. Depending on the\ndecision, sometimes if I\u2019m not happy with it, I\u2019ll pull the veto card as CEO.\nBut I try not to do that because great people want to have autonomy and make\ngreat decisions and want to collaborate with other great people. So I like to\nparticipate in that collaborative process. But from time to time, it\u2019s like,\n\u201cOkay, Jason, what do you think we should do?\u201d I apply my judgment and make a\ncall and we see what happens.\n\nOne big call in 2021: you decided not to sell the company to Microsoft. Can\nyou walk us through that decision?\n\nEvery great company along its life will get acquisition offers. It\u2019s just a\nfact of life because, if a company is great, someone\u2019s going to want to buy\nit. That was not the first offer we\u2019ve gotten, and it wasn\u2019t the last one\nwe\u2019ve gotten. It was just the one that became most public. Whenever we get\ninto any of these situations, I try to ask myself a question around where we\nare as a business. What\u2019s the best thing for our customers? What\u2019s the best\nthing for our shareholders? What do I want? What does my team want? And how do\nwe work through that?\n\nSo far, every time, it\u2019s fallen out on the \u201cLet\u2019s stay independent. Let\u2019s keep\nbuilding. Let\u2019s keep growing. We\u2019re having a blast. There\u2019s a ton of\nopportunity in front of us.\u201d So that was all it was. It came back to our\ncustomers and what we think we could build and what we wanted to do, and then\nwe made a call.\n\nI just talked to Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, who told me every company tried to\nbuy Dropbox at the beginning. They would say, \u201cLook, this is a feature. It\u2019s\nnot a whole product.\u201d But Dropbox has managed to survive because it is cross-\nplatform, because it works with everything, because they prioritize working\nwith everything well, because you can use it without being sucked into some\nother ecosystem and locked in. Discord is like that. You just use it and then\nyou\u2019re playing a game over here, wherever you\u2019re playing a game.\n\nDo you think about that \u2014 that if you\u2019d sold to Microsoft, they would\u2019ve\npulled more people into that ecosystem and that would\u2019ve constrained you in\nsome way? I\u2019m sure Sony has talked to you at some point \u2014 or Nintendo or\nwhoever. Is it that actually being cross-platform is the thing that lets you\nbe successful?\n\nI think that the thing that lets us be successful is it is cross-platform, but\nit\u2019s also our focus as a business on building communications tools. There are\na lot of other gaming companies that have communication services as part of\ntheir offerings. Most major game publishers have something. But it\u2019s not their\npriority. Whenever they\u2019re forced to make a tradeoff around, \u201cWhere do we put\nour best engineers and our best creative people?\u201d they focus on the gameplay,\nas they should, but we focus on communications.\n\nThat business structure combined with cross-platform, combined with the macro\ntrends around gaming becoming more cross-platform and more device-agnostic, I\nthink that is really a big factor in what\u2019s helped us get here. But at this\npoint, a lot of people are on Discord, and we\u2019ve become known as the place to\ntalk and hang out with your friends, so there\u2019s a lot of momentum around that\nthat I think we appreciate and seek to cultivate. I think that\u2019s what really\nmakes us successful.\n\nDo you think about how many fronts of competition you have with the big game\ncompanies? Microsoft has Xbox Live. They also obviously make video games. You\nare slowly starting to make some actual games as part of the Discord platform.\nThat\u2019s another front of competition. Is that something you think about \u2014 how\nmany ways you\u2019re competing with those companies and the many ways you might\nstand apart?\n\nOur focus is very much on communications tools. We have a very small games\nteam. They\u2019re mostly to help us figure out how our platform should work so we\ncan open it up to other folks, which we did just before the Game Developers\nConference a couple of weeks ago. So, right now, anyone can come to Discord\nand opt in to the developer preview and build an HTML5 game embedded right in\nDiscord. That exists because we\u2019ve built some stuff ourselves to figure out\nhow it should work. When I think about competition, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re\ncompeting with the gaming companies. In our earlier days \u2014 like the 2016 to\n2017 era \u2014 all of them tried to launch competing Discord services, and I don\u2019t\nthink any of us know too much about them anymore. I think we won that battle.\n\nAt this point, most game developers use Discord as some part of their go-to-\nmarket and development process. This is one of the other things that we\nlearned over the last year as we were talking to customers and game\ndevelopers, too, was how essential Discord is today and our community\ncapability as part of development. We heard from a lot of folks that they\nbring in early playtesters into smaller private Discords and hop on with the\ndevelopers, and they\u2019ll do nightly playtests to get feedback to guide\ndevelopment of the game.\n\nA lot of that informed our roadmap for this year and really trying to elevate\ngame developers and make them our customers and really collaborate with them.\nWe got a lot of positive excitement from folks around Quests and our HTML5\nplatform and some other things we\u2019re doing. I very much think that we are\nhelping game developers with the services that we provide, not really\ncompeting with them.\n\nIn terms of revenue and where you\u2019re growing, it seems like Nitro, the\nsubscription service, that\u2019s where the focus is. How\u2019s that going? Are you\ngetting a lot of consumers actually paying for yet another subscription\nservice?\n\nNitro is doing very well. People really enjoy the features that they get:\nhigher game streaming; animated custom emoji; being able to give their friends\nbenefits through server boosts. I haven\u2019t publicly shared how much revenue\nit\u2019s making, although you could Google it and figure it out, but it\u2019s doing\nvery well.\n\nWe recently launched another consumer revenue line, which we call our avatar\ndecorations, in our shop. Just a couple of weeks ago, we launched a\npartnership with Valorant, which is one of the big FPS titles, and you can buy\nValorant decorations for your profile, and players love that. That\u2019s going\nincredibly well. I\u2019m really excited about what could come next for us through\nour sponsored Quests format where we\u2019re helping game developers reach their\naudience on Discord to help them build better businesses. Of course, we\u2019ll\nmake some money. And then players will get free rewards in their games that\nthey love. And then there\u2019s our platform, where we can help support games and\nother things like Midjourney build businesses and create new shared\nexperiences for people.\n\nThose are some pretty direct revenue models. You have a subscription service.\nYou buy some cosmetic items for an avatar. Those are some microtransactions.\nSome developers come on the platform. You monetize those developers directly.\nYou\u2019re also poking at ads. You\u2019ve launched some gamified ads inside of Quests.\nIs that the bigger revenue opportunity, or is that something you\u2019re trying\nout?\n\nWe\u2019re just trying it out right now. It\u2019s hard to say how big it will be. What\nwe have heard from game developers and game publishers is that they know that\ntheir players are on Discord, and they really want to be able to reach them.\nWhen we talk to players, and we\u2019ve run some of these Quests experiments,\nplayers really love getting free rewards in games they like.\n\nPeople love free stuff. That\u2019s a universal truth.\n\nYeah, I\u2019m like, \u201cPlease give me free Magic: The Gathering packs. Just send\nthem right there.\u201d I think it\u2019s possible that at some point every game will be\nrunning Quests on Discord, and if you like to play games, there\u2019ll be free\nstuff you can get in every game that you care about. I\u2019m excited for that. I\nthink it could be a big business, but we just started it like a week ago.\n\nOne of the things I think about when I think about a platform like Discord,\nads, and games is that a huge market for ads around games is app install ads.\nDownload this game \u2014 that was a huge market for Facebook and Instagram before\nApple introduced App Tracking Transparency. It seems pretty clear Apple wants\na piece of that. But you\u2019ve got a whole community of gamers who like video\ngames, and you could show them ads to download video games. That could be a\nbig business. Is that something you would do?\n\nIn the context of Quests, we\u2019ve explored showing a quest for a game that you\nhaven\u2019t played yet but is similar to something that you\u2019ve liked to play\nbefore, maybe that your friends are playing, and people respond quite\npositively to it. At the end of the day, people who play games like to play\ngames, they like to try new games, and then developers want to build games and\ncreate these businesses and reach players. I think there\u2019s a really\ninteresting win-win-win type of product experience that we can create to\nmatchmake players and developers, and Quests is our starting point. I\u2019m not\nexactly sure where it\u2019s going to go, but so far, the response from players and\ndevelopers has been quite positive. I\u2019m optimistic about it.\n\nOne thing that happens to every company that goes from straight direct-to-\nconsumer subscriptions and direct monetization to ads is they realize the\ncompanies that buy ads have vastly more money and will just keep spending\nmoney. It just happened to Netflix. People like free stuff. People run ads on\nNetflix. That ad-supported tier is growing really fast, much faster than the\npure subscription tier. You can see that they\u2019re monkeying with the prices to\nget more people onto the ad tier and double-dip on the revenue. Are you\nworried about that, that you\u2019re going to open Pandora\u2019s box here and just\nstart shoving ads over the platform?\n\nNo, I\u2019m not worried about that. Our decision-making always comes back to what\nthe best thing is for our customers, for our users. Over the long term \u2014 and\nthe long term is a series of short-terms, right? \u2014 prioritizing the end-user\nexperience is what\u2019s going to build a durable business for us. That is our\nframe in which we think about, if we\u2019re going to have sponsored content, what\nis the product experience and how does that show up in a way that is tasteful\nthat users enjoy? That is our focus. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to open\nPandora\u2019s box. We\u2019re making the calls.\n\nFair enough. I had to ask \u2014 there are a lot of Discord users who really wanted\nme to ask that question, so I had to do it. You have said you want Discord to\nfinally become profitable this year. Are you on track to do that with all of\nthese new revenue streams?\n\nYeah. It\u2019s looking good.\n\nWhich one of these revenue streams do you think will most help you get to\nprofitability?\n\nWe haven\u2019t really broken this out, but I think that we don\u2019t need anything\ndramatically different to happen to become profitable. Most of our revenue\ncomes from Nitro. I think that that can continue to be the case, and Discord\u2019s\ngoing to be in a great spot.\n\nAlright. So I\u2019ve asked you the hard questions about money. Let\u2019s ask the even\nharder questions about content moderation. Every CEO gets a question on\ncontent moderation on Decoder. It\u2019s just the way of the world. You\u2019ve\ndescribed Discord a few times now as a communications tool, which is really\ninteresting. We think of communications tools as having much less moderation\nand much less acceptable kinds of moderation. I would not want anyone looking\nat my iMessage conversations. I would not want anyone looking at my Signal\nmessages. It\u2019s not allowed.\n\nBut with social media companies and user-generated content companies, we want\na lot of moderation. Discord is obviously somewhere in the middle of those\nthings. You have a lot of moderation. You have a big trust and safety team,\nbut you think of it as a communication tool, even though it\u2019s not encrypted.\nHow do you land on what an acceptable amount of moderation is on Discord?\n\nOur priority when we think about this is keeping teens safe.\n\nKeeping teens safe.\n\nThat\u2019s the priority when we think about how we approach Discord as a company\ndoing moderation. That\u2019s one. The second pillar of that is giving people tools\nto moderate their own spaces so they can decide what the rules and norms are\nfor their spaces. This is the fact that every server can have admins who can\nkick off and ban users and delete messages and enforce rules and norms. That\nis also something that\u2019s been built into Discord from day zero.\n\nThe way that we think about it is to keep teens safe, give people tools to\nmoderate their own spaces, and then really focus on those public spaces and\nmake sure we\u2019re applying moderation there. So if you join the Midjourney\nserver or the Minecraft server, we have expectations of the moderators there,\nand we have systems in place to make sure that that is a good experience when\npeople join. Because that is a little bit more like a social media experience,\neven though it\u2019s a chat surface.\n\nWhereas, when you\u2019re in your DMs, the level of the things that we do are\nactually very standard. I think many other messaging apps do these kinds of\nthings like scan image uploads for CSAM [child sexual abuse material], for\nexample. That\u2019s the stuff that we do there. Now, in the case of teens, we have\na product we call Teen Safety Assist. Other companies have stuff like this in\nmessaging services where, when a teen is, let\u2019s say, interacting with someone,\nmaybe sending photos or doing something, they have a sidekick that\u2019s checking\nout the conversation, seeing what they\u2019re doing, and giving them tips on how\nto keep themselves safe or report things. That\u2019s how we think about that\nbecause it\u2019s really important to us that people feel comfortable and safe\nusing Discord, and adults are more equipped to manage their own stuff. We\nthink teens need some more help. But sometimes adults don\u2019t want to manage\ntheir space, and that\u2019s where our teams come in.\n\nHave you ever thought about launching Boomer Safety Assist? Just putting that\nout there as an idea for you. I think a lot of what Gen Z needs and a lot of\nwhat the older folks need turn out to be the same thing.\n\nAnyone can turn on Teen Safety Assist, if you really want to.\n\nJust an idea for you. Just putting it out there. No bad ideas, right? That\u2019s\ninteresting. Earlier, I talked about this idea that this is a different way of\nthinking about connecting and using the internet. You have these different\ntools. You have these different expectations. Do you think this is a place\nwhere you\u2019re going to increase the level of moderation over time, or are you\nat a steady state?\n\nI think that as a society, our priority is to get all the bad experiences, the\nbad crap, off of Discord. If I could wave a magic wand, there\u2019d be none of\nthat stuff there today. But at the scale that we operate, we basically have a\ncity or a country of people on our service. There\u2019s a lot going on, and human\nnature kicks in. So how do you manage in that kind of an environment? What we\nfound is that, as a society, we\u2019re all still working through the expectations\nwe have of companies in this kind of a world. I think that there will probably\nbe more regulation that comes that will require us to do different things,\nwhich may cause us to moderate more. But really, what drives us from a first-\nprinciple standpoint is giving individual users control with our moderation\ncapabilities and then making sure teens are safe.\n\nWe will launch more things for Teen Safety Assist to help teens be safe, and\nwe will probably launch more moderation tools for people. A couple of years\nago, we launched something called Slow Mode. So if people are spamming, you\ncan turn that off. We do have a whole team working on anti-spam, which is a\ndifferent version of this where people are just annoyingly sending messages.\nIt\u2019s a continual investment for us. The problem continues to persist, so we\ncontinue to have people at our company working to make Discord a safe place\nfor folks.\n\nThe idea that teen safety is the first-order bit, and you\u2019re just going to\nkeep focused on that, our Congress seems very interested in this idea. It is\nthe skeleton key that unlocks speech regulations for them in a lot of ways.\nYou just testified in Congress for the first time in January. You talked about\nprotecting children. That\u2019s where you said you don\u2019t encrypt Discord messages\nbecause you want to be able to protect children on the platform. That\u2019s a big\ntradeoff. Most other communications platforms are headed toward encryption,\nand they\u2019re waging big fights to encrypt messages. Why did you make the other\ntradeoff?\n\nFor the reason we said. Discord is a place where people talk and hang out with\ntheir friends and is coming from the lens of creating a casual place where\nyou\u2019re having fun with people you care about. Our priority is making sure that\npeople can relax and have fun. When you focus on that priority, then we made\ncertain decisions in order to make sure we could deliver that kind of an\nexperience for people. So it\u2019s really that simple.\n\nThat is very much in opposition to how the other big companies think about\ntheir communications systems as opposed to their user-generated content\nsystems. As you get bigger, as more kinds of people use the service, you do\nhave weirder, newer problems, particularly as the community starts to build\nthings and do things that maybe teens aren\u2019t doing. I\u2019ll give you an example.\nYou all recently banned a number of servers related to Nintendo Switch\nemulation. Nintendo sued a group called Yuzu. They basically disappeared. But\nthere were some forks of that software, and now those forks, those development\ncommunities, are gone from Discord. They\u2019ve been banned. What happened there?\nHow do you make those calls? Because it doesn\u2019t seem very clear to a lot of\npeople.\n\nThat is an ongoing situation that I really can\u2019t comment on. But generally\nspeaking, we comply with DMCA [Digital Millennium Copyright Act] requests, and\nwe treat copyright law very seriously. When those processes get instigated by\ncompanies, we take it very seriously. In that situation, my understanding is\nit\u2019s something related to that, but I can\u2019t get into all the specifics.\n\nI just wondered because that is happening all over the place in the platform.\nYou look at other companies, they\u2019ve developed massive systems to deal with\ncopyright infringement at scale. YouTube has a notice and takedown regime that\nis so powerful that I think most people think it is copyright law. They don\u2019t\nknow there\u2019s actually a federal copyright law. There\u2019s just whatever YouTube\nthinks, and that is a good enough substitute for most YouTubers. Are you in a\nposition where you\u2019re going to have to start building some of those systems as\nwell, like a content ID for Nintendo Switch emulators?\n\nDiscord is quite different from a broadcast service like YouTube.\n\nBut it is and it isn\u2019t, right? These emulation groups were broadcasting their\nwork.\n\nWell, I guess what I mean is the majority of things that people are doing on\nDiscord are just talking with their friends. If you look at a business like\nYouTube, their fundamental business is that someone uploads a video and then\nthey show it to you. In that core loop, it\u2019s quite easy to upload something\nthat maybe you shouldn\u2019t in that context. On Discord, we do allow people to\nupload files and videos, so of course, we do scan every uploaded file for\nmalware and viruses and things like that.\n\nBut Discord is not a broadcast video platform where people can upload videos\nand then other random people can see it. The volume of that thing on our\nplatform is much smaller, I suspect, than something like YouTube. But from\ntime to time, we do get DMCA requests. Or sometimes we get court orders and we\nhave to interact with law enforcement. So we do have a process in place to\nrespond to those things effectively. We do have a process for those things.\nBut the shape of Discord is quite different from the shape of something like\nYouTube.\n\nI know you said you can\u2019t talk about this specific case, but here, I think\nthese people don\u2019t even know what they did wrong. YouTube has an entire\ninfrastructure. It has a bureaucracy. That\u2019s not actually the only way to\ndescribe it. There\u2019s a YouTube bureaucracy that will take your stuff down if\nyou use some song that you\u2019re not supposed to use. Do you have a bureaucracy\nlike that that can effectively communicate in these cases? As the range of\nuses for Discord expands, they\u2019re going to run into people using it like that,\nwhether or not that\u2019s your intention.\n\nWhat I can say is that in this situation, we acted in accordance with our\npolicies, and they\u2019re based on a court order injunction. I can\u2019t get into much\nmore than that. But I think we shared that in an article that The Verge wrote\nabout it, so that\u2019s what I can say about that. But again, broadly, when we\ncan, we try to communicate to people the rationale behind why actions are\ntaken if they break our terms of service or something.\n\nWe recently released a warning system actually in Discord, where if you break\na community guideline or break a terms of service in a way that doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily make it such that we should delete your account, we will give your\naccount a warning and a fractional disable. You can go see exactly what you\ndid, and you can\u2019t send a message for two hours. Part of that is we think\nsometimes teens just do stupid things, and it\u2019s better to teach them than to\njust kick them off a platform. But of course, it\u2019s commensurate based on the\nintensity of the infraction.\n\nIn many ways, Discord is a store of knowledge now. It\u2019s replaced wikis and\nforums for a lot of people, for a lot of things: AI comes to mind, crypto\ncomes to mind. But there are a lot of communities now that are actively\nupdating their Discords with what they know. Do you think about that\nresponsibility to preserve and make searchable all this knowledge that is\ngoing into the system?\n\nYes, we do. And we\u2019ve actually... Okay, this is one of those things where I\nwas about to say something, and if I say it, then our users are going to hold\nme to it.\n\nSay it.\n\nNo. I\u2019ll just say that I understand that there\u2019s a lot of really important\ninformation in public Discord communities that people are worried about being\nstocked and locked in there. And we understand that. And we intend to try to\nsolve it in a way that makes sense for people. But I don\u2019t have anything\nspecific to share right now.\n\nAlright. That\u2019s very exciting.
