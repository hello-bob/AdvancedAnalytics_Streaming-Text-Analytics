The study is\npublished in Sustainable Cities and Society.\n\nCool paint coatings contain additives that reflect the sun's heat to reduce\nsurface heat absorption and emission. They have been touted as one way to cool\ndown the urban area and mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect, a\nphenomenon in which urban areas experience warmer temperatures than their\noutlying surroundings.\n\nTo date, most studies of cool paint coatings have been either simulation-based\nor tested in scaled-down models, and understanding of its application in real-\nworld scenarios is limited.\n\nNow, NTU researchers have conducted a first of its kind real-world study in\nthe tropics to comprehensively evaluate how well cool paint coatings work in\nreducing city heat.\n\nThe team coated the roofs, walls, and road pavements of an industrial area in\nSingapore and found that by comparison with an adjacent uncoated area, the\ncoated environment was up to 2\u00b0C cooler in the afternoon, with pedestrian\nthermal comfort level improving by up to 1.5\u00b0C, measured using the Universal\nThermal Climate Index\u2014a common international standard for human outdoor\ntemperature sensation that takes into account temperature, relative humidity,\nthermal radiation, and wind speed.\n\nLead author Dr. E V S Kiran Kumar Donthu, who completed the work as a Research\nFellow at Energy Research Institute at NTU (ERIAN), said, \"Our study provides\nevidence that cool paint coatings reduce heat build-up and contribute to the\ncooling of the urban environment.\n\n\"This is a minimally intrusive solution for urban cooling that has an\nimmediate effect, compared to other options that often require major urban\nredevelopment to deploy. Moreover, by reducing the amount of heat absorbed in\nurban structures, we also reduce heat load in buildings, consequently reducing\nindoor air-conditioning energy consumption.\"\n\nLead investigator, Associate Professor Wan Man Pun at the NTU School of\nMechanical & Aerospace Engineering (MAE), said, \"Findings from the study are\nnot just relevant for cities in Singapore where it is hot all year round, but\nfor other urban areas around the world too. With global warming, people will\nincreasingly look for ways to stay cool. Our study validates how cool paint\ncoatings can be a strategy to reduce the urban heat island effect in future.\"\n\nThe study supports the NTU 2025 strategic plan, which seeks to address\nhumanity's grand challenges on sustainability and accelerate the translation\nof research discoveries into innovations that mitigate human impact on the\nenvironment.\n\n## Real-world experiments in 'street canyons'\n\nTo carry out their real-world experiments, the NTU researchers selected four\nrectangular buildings that created two parallel \"street canyons\"\u2014narrow\nstreets flanked by buildings\u2014in an industrial estate west of Singapore managed\nby JTC Corporation.\n\nOne canyon, or \"cool canyon\" was coated with cool paints on the roofs, walls,\nand road pavement, while the other (conventional) canyon remained as it was as\na \"control\" for the experiment.\n\nUsing environmental sensors, the NTU team monitored the conditions in the two\ncanyons over two months, which included air movement, surface and air\ntemperature, humidity, and radiation, to see how well the cool paint coatings\nworked in reducing city heat.\n\nThe researchers found that during a 24-hour cycle, the cool canyon saw up to a\n30% reduction in heat released from the built-up surfaces, resulting in the\nair temperature in the cool canyon being cooler than the conventional canyon\nby up to 2\u00b0C during the hottest time of the day, at around 4pm. As a result,\npedestrians in the cool canyon can feel up to 1.5\u00b0C cooler.\n\nThe NTU research team also found that air temperature in the cool canyon was\nlowered because less heat was absorbed by and stored in the building walls,\nroofs, and roads, and which would subsequently have been released to either\nheat up the surrounding air or the building's interior.\n\nCompared to conventional roofs, the roofs with the cool paint coating\nreflected 50% more sunlight and absorbed up to 40% less heat as a result,\nduring the hottest time of a sunny day. The coated walls also prevented most\nof the heat from entering the industrial buildings.\n\nCo-author, Assistant Professor Ng Bing Feng at the NTU School of MAE, said,\n\"Our study showed that cool paint coating on the road significantly helped\nlower the hottest temperatures in the cool canyon, confirming that cool paint\ncoating can be a promising way to make urban areas cooler and more\ncomfortable, especially during hot weather. We hope findings from our study\nwill encourage more urban planners to adopt cool paint coatings on more built-\nup surfaces, on a large scale.\"\n\nIn future research, the NTU team will focus on how the cool paint coating\nholds up over time in the same experiment location.\n\nMore information: E.
