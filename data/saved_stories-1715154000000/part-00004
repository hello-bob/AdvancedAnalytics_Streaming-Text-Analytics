After all, you were there,\nliving it.\u201d\n\nBy Dennis Tang\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nI remember being a small child, doing arithmetic at the kitchen table, but not\nwhat state I was in\u2014Delaware, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, we moved all around. I\nremember the face of my middle school bully, but not his name. I remember\nfalling desperately in love with a girl in my college Shakespeare lecture, but\nnot what words we actually exchanged. At the time, I must have trusted I\u2019d\nremember every detail, every second. I\u2019d felt those moments so deeply, after\nall. How could I not?\n\nNothing marks growing up like being proven wrong. I was wrong, there is simply\ntoo much, too distant, to remember. Accumulating memories flatten under their\nown weight. Watershed events are smoothed down to a plain. Indelible images\nsmudge and blur. Moments that once felt committed to film, cinematic, are\nshaved down to a point: a single sharp feeling of joy, heartbreak, or loss.\nWhat\u2019s most easily lost are the specifics. Dates forgotten. Details jumbled.\nWas it raining that night, or am I being dramatic? In that Shakespeare\nlecture, were we reading The Tempest, or Twelfth Night? Bits and pieces are\nlost forever, now. Memories become like dreams of the past.\n\nFor those who hope that a journal might provide an empirical record, the\nsubjectivity of the author always interferes.\n\nAnd yet, I have never kept a journal.\n\nPerhaps I should have. Written it down, I mean. As a writer, it feels like a\nduty. To keep a journal is a near-ubiquitous piece of introductory advice.\nStart a journal. Write in it every day. We hear so often about the journals of\nfamous authors\u2014Woolf, Sontag, Kafka, O\u2019Connor, and so on\u2014that it\u2019s as if the\nrest of us are lazy, negligent, bad writers. Letting the raw material of our\nart slip through our hands. In a world of endless writing prescriptions and\ninspiration, such is the party line. As a writer, few things fill me with more\nguilt that I nevertheless, steadfastly do not do. Why is that? Every day, I\nwonder if something is happening to me that I\u2019ll want to remember. I fail to\nwrite all of it down, and I repeat.\n\nPut that way, it sounds like abject insanity. But hints abound that other\nnotable writers are like the rest of us: abortive and lapsed in their\nrecordkeeping, skeptical of what kinds of truth a journal offers anyway. They\noffer some hope for the rest of us, that lax recordkeeping is not the death\nknell for an aspiring writer.\n\nTo start, we may distinguish between notebooks and journals. All writers, we\ncan presume, keep some version of the former, jot down somewhere their\nthoughts and stray bits of poetry or prose, whether it be bound and organized\npages, a Notes app, Post-Its\u2014whatever. A journal, however, is a chronological\nrecording of events as they happen. Joan Didion famously penned an essay about\nthe former called \u201cOn Keeping a Notebook,\u201d in which she admits to failing at\nthe latter. \u201cAt no point have I ever been able successfully to keep a diary,\u201d\nshe writes.\n\n\u201cMy approach to daily life ranges from the grossly negligent to the merely\nabsent, and on those few occasions when I have tried dutifully to record a\nday\u2019s events, boredom has so overcome me that the results are mysterious at\nbest. What is this business about \u2018shopping, typing piece, dinner with E,\ndepressed\u2019? Shopping for what? Typing what piece? Who is E? Was this \u2018E\u2019\ndepressed, or was I depressed? Who cares?\u201d Even for an obsessive like Didion,\nit can be tedious work to record all events with enough fidelity. The minute-\nby-minute might interest the future self, but often not the self who is living\nit.\n\nPatricia Lockwood describes a similar block, in her memoir Priestdaddy. \u201cThe\nsort of diary that fixes my body in time and space, that records the weather\nand my moods and what my rosebushes are doing, has always been impossible for\nme. As soon as I begin to set down the facts, the old childhood chorus of Is\nthat true? Is that really true? starts up, and I hesitate, and then I scratch\nout the sentences until they\u2019re solid black.\u201d\n\nHere, too, we see a skepticism that even daily diary keeping can stick to the\nfacts, the reason Catherine Lacey calls journaling \u201cthat practice of private\nself-mythology\u201d; even when it is fixed in time and space, the self is prone to\nspinning yarns. For those who hope that a journal might provide an empirical\nrecord, the subjectivity of the author always interferes.\n\nEven for writers who do journal, it can prove less than useful. Heidi Julavits\nkept a diary as a child, yet its tediousness is the germ of her memoir, The\nFolded Clock. \u201cThe actual diaries, however, fail to corroborate the myth I\u2019d\nconcocted for myself. They reveal me to possess the mind, not of a future\nwriter, but of a future paranoid tax auditor. I exhibited no imagination, no\ntrace of a style, no wit, no personality.\u201d But is that really true?\n\nWe might infer that things were left out of these journals, something\nexhibited as a child that hints at the creative spark of Julavits the adult.\nIf I\u2019d had a journal, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have written about some toy I desired\nhundreds of times\u2014and yet, I hope, there were more multitudes to my young\nmind. A journal is never complete or perfect, not even in recording one\u2019s\nthoughts. It was written by a different person, fixated and unaware in their\nown ways. A relative child, regardless of age.\n\nJournals miss things, and so more and more effort can always be expended to\npreserve the long tail of experience, every bit of marginalia that could ever\ninform anything. Sarah Manguso, in an essay about memory, describes a case\nthat is the logical end of this impulse:\n\nThe graphomaniac Robert Shields spent four hours a day recording his life in\nfive-minute increments, including logs of his body temperature and blood\npressure and descriptions of his junk mail. He slept in two-hour stretches in\norder to record his dreams. He eventually donated the diaries to Washington\nState University, on the condition that they could not be read or subjected to\na word count until fifty years after his death, but their length is estimated\nat 38 million words.\n\nOne day, someone will dedicate nearly as much of their lives to seeing what\nthese entries contain as Shields did to writing them. Something tells me that\nthey will most likely resemble the diaries that Didion and Julavits considered\ndisappointments: painstakingly mundane, full of the parts of life that we\ndepend on literature to elide, summarize, and synthesize.\n\nIf we do not journal, we are left with memory: fallible, slipshod memory.\nLouise Gl\u00fcck appears to rely entirely on memory in her essay \u201cOn Revenge.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I was a child,\u201d she writes, \u201cI was enormously sensitive to slights; my\ndefinition of slights as broad as my sensitivity was deep. I trust my memory\non this point because the child I describe corresponds so exactly to the\nevolved adult.\u201d And indeed, the kind of telling that follows is less rooted in\nevidence, more memory\u2019s evocation of the past. \u201cPride governed my behavior. It\nprecluded, to my mind, all show of anger [...] Anger was the show of blood\nthat proved the arrow had penetrated.\u201d No diary entries were used in the\nmaking of this. Gl\u00fcck instead interrogates the memory of her feelings, often\nthe memories that linger strongest, for the truth of her interior life. It\nfeels like as rich a vein as any journal.\n\nThere remains the matter your own mind, rich and vast, full of more than you\ncould ever hope to put to the page.\n\nAnnie Ernaux is another writer who we know must rely on memory: after all, her\nmother burned all the diaries she wrote as a youth. And yet her memoirs are\nfull of the details that matter most, serve almost as sociological windows\ninto the times in which they occur. Her style of l\u2019\u00e9criture plate or \u201cflat\nwriting,\u201d as she calls it, is an attempt to impartially represent her own\nrecollections.\n\nAs she writes in A Woman\u2019s Story: \u201cThis way of writing, which seems to bring\nme closer to the truth, relieves me of the dark, heavy burden of personal\nremembrance by establishing a more objective approach.\u201d Ernaux represents an\nalternative mode of writing from memory: memory as pure sense-data, sans the\nsubjectivity of one\u2019s sentimental or emotional bias. Memory as both a source\nof knowledge and subject of interrogation in itself.\n\nYet still, as I write this, I feel like I\u2019m making excuses. I regret\nforgetting the names of people whose faces I remember. I wish I had the\ncrucial scenes of my life in writing in front of me, narrated with complete\nclarity. Problem is, no journal can do that. Wading through the fog of the\npast to cherry-pick the information you want requires hindsight, knowledge\nafter the fact of what matters. What you need is not a journal, but a time\nmachine.\n\nOn some level, a journal is a play for control. It is a fight against the fear\nof loss. The hoarder\u2019s fear, that one will lose anything that might ever be\nuseful. A fear of growing older, losing one\u2019s youth, and forgetting. Not\ncoincidentally, such fears are only amplified by the pressure to produce,\ncapitalism\u2019s dictum to translate every iota of time and energy into inputs for\nprofit. If you are not writing it all down, the reasoning goes, constantly\ncreating material so that it may pay dividends in the future, what the hell\nare you doing?\n\nWell, living, I suppose, which matters for writing too. Reading and writing\nother things, because I can\u2019t do everything. To be sure, there is nothing\nwrong with keeping a journal, and perhaps, someday, I\u2019ll try. But it is\nimportant, I think, to reject claims of any one weird trick to great writing,\nto let go of the anxiety that comes with insisting on complete mastery over\nour habits and ourselves. Whether it is 38 million words or \u201cdinner with E,\ndepressed,\u201d no volume of ink can encompass all of time and space. There is\nsomething mollifying in accepting this, in living with an acknowledgment of\none\u2019s limits. Recognizing that memory is not merely an inferior keeper of\nrecords, but an alternate form of truth in itself.\n\nIn the end, nothing can be nailed down forever by the beings of this moral\ncoil, trying to live and be happy in the perpetual present. Something is\nalways being forgotten. Something is always being lost. A journal is just one\nof the many ways by which we try to stem this tide, and any way in which we\nwrite and think and feel represents nothing other than our best attempt. Which\nis good. It\u2019s okay. And regardless of what\u2019s recorded or lost, there remains\nthe matter your own mind, rich and vast, full of more than you could ever hope\nto put to the page, anyway.\n\nIn the end, to forget is to be human. Don\u2019t be afraid of losing touch with the\npast. After all, you were there, living it.\n\nCraft AdviceDennis TangdiariesJournalingjournalsmemoriesmemorythe writing\nlifewriting practice\n\nShare:\n\n  * Share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n  * More\n\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n###### Dennis Tang\n\nDennis Tang is a lecturer in creative writing at Oberlin College in Ohio.
