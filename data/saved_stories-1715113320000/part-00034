Starting around July\n10, 2024, we expect to offer German clients access to a range of innovative\ncrypto products via a dedicated offering powered by DLT Finance.\n\nDLT Finance is a brand of leading BaFin-licensed crypto service providers DLT\nSecurities GmbH and DLT Custody GmbH, which offer digital asset prime\nbrokerage and crypto custody services. Once the partnership is live, DLT\nFinance will provide localized expertise and infrastructure to serve millions\nof Germans with secure and compliant crypto services.\n\n\u201cCollaborating with industry-leading partners is a vital component of our\nmission to accelerate the global adoption of crypto. Over 5% of Germans\nalready own cryptoassets, and we\u2019re confident our innovative product suite \u2013\nalong with excellent local language client service support \u2013 will be\nattractive to prospective clients as crypto continues to become more\nmainstream across Europe,\u201d said Kraken CEO David Ripley.\n\n\u201cWith this partnership, German clients get access to crypto with certainty\nthat they are trading with a best-in-class offering as Germany transitions\ntoward a new pan-European regulatory framework.\u201d\n\nMarius Sewing, Co-Founder & CEO at DLT Finance, added: \u201cAn integral part of\nour service is to make fully regulated financial market infrastructure for\nbrokerage and custody of digital assets available to industry-leading\npartners. Building on our commitment toward the highest security standards,\nregulatory compliance and technological excellence, this partnership perfectly\nepitomizes DLT Finance\u2019s mission of driving regulated and compliant digital\nasset adoption in the European Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to embark on this joint endeavor with Kraken and look forward\nto advancing the landscape of digital asset adoption, together.\u201d\n\nOur European growth plan acceleration is also reflected in our recent\nacquisition intent announcement of Dutch crypto broker Coin Meester B.V.\n(BCM). We remain committed to scaling our business locally in compliance with\nregulations across other European countries to meet client demand for our\nbest-in-class product suite.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement follows several previous European milestones for our\nbusiness.
