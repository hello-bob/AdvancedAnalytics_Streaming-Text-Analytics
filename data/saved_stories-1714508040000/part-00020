Nobody knows when he\ndied. He had not been seen in weeks when police forced their way into his\nnorth London home on December 28th 2023. Unopened post was piled high on his\ndoormat. His body was decomposing on the bedroom floor.\n\nGiddings\u2019s sad fate is becoming increasingly common. In a recent study in the\nJournal of the Royal Society of Medicine, the authors looked at records of\ndeaths for which pathologists were unable to determine a cause during an\nautopsy (coded as \u201cunascertained\u201d). In the vast majority of cases, including\nGiddings\u2019s, this is usually because a body is too decomposed to examine\nproperly. Their research suggests that the number of unascertained deaths in\nEngland and Wales increased five-fold between 1992 and 2022, even as overall\nmortality rates were falling.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get the full story\n\n### Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.
