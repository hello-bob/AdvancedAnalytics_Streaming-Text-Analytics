It lurks at the heart of the galaxy and\nformed not from an exploding star but the collapse of vast clouds of dust and\ngas.\n\nResearchers spotted BH3 in the latest trove of data gathered by the European\nSpace Agency\u2019s Gaia mission. The space telescope launched in 2013 with the aim\nof compiling a 3D map of a billion stars.\n\nAs researchers were reviewing the Gaia observations, they noticed a distinct\nwobble in one of the stars in Aquila, a constellation that is visible in the\nsummer sky in the northern hemisphere. The movement suggested the star was\nbeing pulled around by a black hole 33 times more massive than the sun.\n\nFurther observations from the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large\nTelescope in Chile\u2019s Atacama desert confirmed BH3\u2019s mass and the star\u2019s orbit,\nwhich circles the black hole once every 11.6 years. \u201cOnly the central black\nhole in the Milky Way is more massive than this one,\u201d Panuzzo said.\n\nWhile BH3 is more massive than other stellar black holes in the Milky Way, it\nis similar to some of those revealed by gravitational waves, or ripples in\nspacetime, which are generated when black holes collide in distant galaxies.\n\n\u201cWe have only seen black holes of this mass with gravitational waves in\nfaraway galaxies,\u201d said Panuzzo. \u201cThis makes the link between the stellar\nblack holes we see in our galaxy and those gravitational wave discoveries.\u201d\nDetails are published in Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nThere may be 100m stellar black holes in the Milky Way, but despite their vast\nmass and the powerful forces they generate, they can be extremely difficult to\nspot. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t have a star orbiting around them, so they are almost\ninvisible to us,\u201d said Panuzzo.\n\nMeasurements of BH3\u2019s companion star found no sign that it was contaminated\nwith material blasted out from the stellar explosion that formed the black\nhole. The finding suggests the black hole formed long before it trapped the\ncompanion star in its powerful gravitational field.\n\nThe next tranche of Gaia data is due for release in late 2025 at the earliest,\nbut the importance of the discovery led the international team to release\ndetails of BH3 early so astronomers can study it immediately.\n\n\u201cAs soon as this comes out people will rush to observe it to see if there are\nany emissions from the black hole,\u201d Panuzzo said. \u201cThat will tell us about the\nwind that comes from stars like the one orbiting the black hole, and also\nabout the physics of the black hole and how matter falls into it.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Black holes\n  * Astronomy\n  * Space\n  * Physics\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
