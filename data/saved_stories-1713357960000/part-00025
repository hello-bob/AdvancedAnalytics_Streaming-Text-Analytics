This helps avoid mix-\nups and gets you better advice. Example: Not so clear: \"What will happen to me\nlater?\" Better: \"What can I do to get better at my job in the next six\nmonths?\"\n\n## 2.Talk About Now, Not Later\n\nTarot cards are best at helping you with what's going on right now. They give\nadvice for today's choices and challenges. Example: Thinking about later:\n\"Will I find someone to love next year?\" Thinking about now: \"What can I do\nright now to find a good relationship?\"\n\n## 3.Ask About You, Not Others\n\nWhen you ask tarot cards for help, focus on what you can do, not what others\nmight do. This helps you take charge of your own life. Example: Asking about\nsomeone else: \"Will the person I like want to get back together?\" Asking about\nyourself: \"What can I do to feel better after a tough breakup and be ready for\na new, happy relationship?\"\n\n## 4.Keep an Open Mind\n\nBe ready for any answer the tarot cards give, even if it's not what you\nexpected. Sometimes, the best advice is a surprise. Example: \"Come to the\nreading ready to listen and think about new ideas the tarot cards might show\nyou.\"\n\n## 5.Don't Keep Asking the Same Thing\n\nIt's best not to ask the same question over and over. This keeps the advice\nclear and helpful.\n\n## Why we created tarotread.ai\n\nWe are Tarot and AI enthusiasts who believe that everyone should have access\nto divine guidance regardless of where they are in life. Our online AI Tarot\nreader can be used for fun, learning, or for some quick advice when you need\nit most. Try your first question on us!\n\nWe believe that AI will never have the same personalized human touch as a\nhuman Tarot reader. Tarot readings involve not only an understanding of the\nsymbolism and meaning of the cards, but also the ability to empathize and\nconnect with those seeking guidance. Making personal connections can be a\ncrucial element of the Tarot reading experience.\n\nAI cannot (yet) fully replicate human subjective interpretation, and therefore\ncannot fully replace a human Tarot reader.\n\n## WHAT OUR USERS ARE SAYING\n\nJorge Wang\n\nEarly bird user\n\nTotally LEGIT!!!
