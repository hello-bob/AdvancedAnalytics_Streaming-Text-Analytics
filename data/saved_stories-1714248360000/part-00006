[+] their titles to \u201cphysician associates.\u201d\n\nGetty\n\nPhysician assistants in Oregon will soon be able to rebrand under new rules\nofficially changing their titles to \u201cphysician associates.\u201d\n\nA bill, which contains the name change to physician associates was passed by\nthe Oregon state legislature and signed into law earlier this month by Oregon\nGov. Tina Kotek. The new licensing rules will take effect June 6, 2024.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge accomplishment that will help pave the way for more states to\nadopt title change and ensure patients better understand how PAs practice on\nhealthcare teams,\u201d said Folusho E. Ogunfiditimi, who is president and chair of\nthe board of the American Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA).\n\nThe name change comes amid a primary care shortage that is triggering states\nacross the country to expand the scope of practice for healthcare\nprofessionals like PAs and nurse practitioners. Increasingly, states are\nallowing PAs to do more and supporters of the name change say the new title\nbetter reflects what they are allowed to do, including prescribe medications\nand diagnose certain illnesses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had countless meetings with legislators to ensure they understand the\nvital role our profession plays in the healthcare system and the need for a\ntitle that better reflects this role,\u201d said Alisa Gifford, president of the\nOregon Society of Physician Associates.\n\n\u201cThanks to the passage of House Bill 4010, PAs will have a title that more\naccurately reflects our scope of practice and will give patients a better\nunderstanding of the important credentials and responsibilities that PAs have\nwithin the healthcare system,\u201d Gifford said. \u201cI hope it helps pave the way for\nother states to update their title as well.\u201d\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### Apple\u2019s iPhone AI Plans Confirmed With New Software Release\n\n### Packers Complete Safety Overhaul With Georgia\u2019s Javon Bullard\n\n### Sopranos Star On James Gandolfini s Caring Reaction To Her MS Diagnosis\n\nBut the push to create more physician associates could face hurdles in other\nstates due to opposition from physicians and their lobbies.\n\nIn 2021, for example, the American Medical Association\u2019s policy-making House\nof Delegates opposed AAPA\u2019s efforts to change the official title of the\nprofession from \u2018physician assistant\u2019 to \u2018physician associate.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe AMA believes changing the title of \u2018physician assistants\u2019 will only serve\nto further confuse patients about who is providing their care, especially\nsince AAPA sought a different title change in recent years, preferring to only\nuse the term \u2018PA\u2019,\u201d AMA immediate past president Dr. Susan R. Bailey said in\nJune of 2021.\n\n\u201cGiven the existing difficulty many patients experience in identifying who is\nor is not a physician, it is important to provide patients with more\ntransparency and clarity in who is providing their care, not more confusion,\u201d\nBailey said. \u201cYet, AAPA\u2019s effort to change the title of physician assistants\nto rebrand their profession will undoubtedly confuse patients and is clearly\nan attempt to advance their pursuit toward independent practice.\u201d\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
