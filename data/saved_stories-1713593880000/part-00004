In this almost a decade, I\nhave been closely following the moves of the only iOS alternative, Google\u2019s\nAndroid.\n\nDespite my preference for iOS, there are good ideas on the other side of the\nturf that I would like to be copied by Apple.\n\nSome of them have begun to be implemented \u2014 even if only in the European\nUnion, by law. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) forced Apple to open iOS more,\ncreating holes in the famous walled garden that the company has built around\nits ecosystem and that leaves on the sidelines what goes against its\ninterests.\n\nIn public, Apple argues that the artificial limitations of iOS are for the\ngood and safety of users. It\u2019s a paternalistic statement, petty and, worst of\nall, largely unfounded.\n\nI classify them unfounded because Apple\u2019s solutions are competitive on their\nown merits, regardless of the artificial/disloyal advantages they enjoy for\n\u201cplaying at home\u201d.\n\nSee, for example, the browser market. Web developers love to hate WebKit,\nSafari\u2019s rendering engine that, in iOS, is mandatory for all other browsers.\n\nIn a world where only three engines coexist \u2014 in addition to WebKit, we have\nthe dominant Blink (Google/Chrome) and the smallest of the trio, Gecko\n(Mozilla/Firefox) \u2014, WebKit is good enough and, in Apple OSs, Safari is the\nbrowser that delivers the best integration and the least impact to iPhone and\nMacBook batteries.\n\nOne of the requirements of the European Union is that Apple accepts browsers\nwith their own engines, such as Android and desktop OSs. This is, unlike the\nbrowsers ballot screen, one of the most faithful to the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d\nresults of DMA, which is to foster competition in digital markets stagnated by\nbig tech.\n\nEvery time I open Firefox on my testing Android phone, with its cool\nextensions and the Gecko engine, I remember the iOS version, much inferior\nbecause it lacks the features that make Firefox on Android an alternative\ncapable of, over there, competing with Chrome.\n\n***\n\nAnother front in which Apple had to make concessions was in the exclusivity in\nthe distribution of apps, until then restricted to its App Store. In Europe,\niOS can now tap on alternative app stores and even instal app installers\ndownloaded from websites.\n\nAltStore PAL, launched on Wednesday 17^th, made history: it\u2019s the first\nalternative store for iOS approved by Apple.\n\nRiley Testut, one of the founders of the store, is also the creator of Delta,\na Nintendo emulator that, due to another concession from Apple, is now\navailable on the App Store elsewhere.\n\nWhy did it take 16 years for Apple to accept video game emulators in its App\nStore? We can only confabulate, but you can say that \u201clack of competition\u201d was\na relevant factor.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, despite the hegemony of Google\u2019s Play Store on\nAndroid, it has always been possible to install alternative app stores. Large\nmanufacturers, such as Amazon, Samsung and Huawei, have their own. At the\nother end of the market, small groups of enthusiasts, such as the F-Droid\npeople, too.\n\nF-Droid is what I\u2019ve once called \u201cthe app store of an ideal world\u201d. By\ndefault, it\u2019s limited to free and open source apps, with a fine curation and a\nnon-commercial \u201cethos\u201d. Another peculiarity is that it\u2019s based on\nrepositories, similar to that of Linux package managers: it\u2019s possible to add\nthird-party repositories to extend the index of downloadable apps.\n\nWhen I have an Android in hand, I can (and prefer) to download most of my apps\nfrom F-Droid. It would be wonderful to have something equivalent on iOS.\n\n***\n\nAlthough iOS is better served with good apps, some Android exclusives are\nmissing. The most frustrating thing is that they just do not exist on Apple\u2019s\ndevice due to artificial limitations of iOS itself, and not due to lack of\ndemand or people willing to create them. As was the case with video game\nemulators until a few days ago.\n\nA good example is Syncthing, a system that keeps files from a directory common\nto two or more synchronized devices \u2014 such as cloud services (Dropbox and the\nlike), but without the cloud.\n\nThere is even an app for iOS, M\u00f6bius Sync, but the OS limitations make the\nexperience far short of that of Android, with the official app or forks of it.\n\nIt isn\u2019t crazy to imagine that these and other limitations of iOS only exist\nto preserve Apple\u2019s business. If people could sync files directly between\ndevices, they might replace a more expensive iCloud subscription for a larger\nSSD on the home computer.\n\n***\n\nTo finish this non-exhaustive list, a feature present in Android and absent\nfrom iOS, which seems to me even more motivated by commercial interests, is\nthe ability to turn the phone into a computer.\n\nFor a few years now, Samsung has been offering DeX, which adapts the Android\nof some more expensive phones in the Galaxy line to large screens by\nconnecting them to a keyboard, mouse and external monitor.\n\nApple\u2019s super powerful chips and the iPadOS\u2019 Stage Manager are the perfect\npieces to make the magical scenario in which we could have only one device\ncome true: in the pocket, it would be the iPhone that everyone knows; by\nconnecting it to a USB-C dock or hub, it would become an iPadOS, or a\nsimplified macOS.\n\nMaybe there could even be a hollow screen to fit the iPhone and turn it into\nan iPad, as Asus tried to do with the Padfone Infinity, without success, a\ndecade ago.\n\nBut then Apple would sell only one instead of three devices, and... well, I\nthink you can understand the reasoning.\n\nIn time: Google is testing a feature similar to Samsung\u2019s DeX for Android 15.\n\n***\n\nAndroid and iOS started from very different places in the late 2000s and, for\na long time, choosing one of them implied giving up certain features. These\ndifferences have decreased a lot in recent years, but they still exist \u2014 as I\njust showed with my \u201clist of envy\u201d of Android.\n\nI hope that EU\u2019s legal obligations end up as a turning point, inspire other\njurisdictions, disseminate around the world and pressure Apple and Google to\nbe less restrictive. Despite Apple\u2019s arguments, in the end, we are the ones\nwho win with all these changes.\n\n\u00ab The beauty of free and open source software\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter:\n\nRodrigo Ghedin is a Brazilian journalist covering consumer tech for a small,\nindependent publication called Manual do Usu\u00e1rio.
