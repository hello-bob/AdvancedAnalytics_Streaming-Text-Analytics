Select a project using the project drop-down menu and\nwork on it without being distracted by irrelevant things.\n\nWidgets\n\nQuickly access everything you need\n\nUse Freeter widgets to set up a workflow providing a quick access to\neverything you need for your work.\n\nWorkflow Examples\n\nWebpage Widget\n\nUse web apps efficiently\n\nEmbed all apps you use daily into your Freeter workflows using the webpage\nwidget, and access them from one window. If you tired of switching between\naccounts, the widget also enables you to stay signed-in with different\naccounts on per-project, per-workflow or per-widget basis.\n\nWeb App Examples\n\nFile Opener Widget\n\nOpen project files in the editor\n\nUse the file opener widget to open all project files and folders in your\nediting programs with a single click.\n\nWeb Query Widget\n\nSearch the web like a ninja\n\nUse the web query widget to quickly perform templated queries with a web\nsearch engine or any other website.\n\nTo-Do List Widget\n\nAdd quick to-do lists\n\nStop keeping checklists and to-do lists in your head. Let the to-do list\nwidget remember them for you.\n\nCommander Widget\n\nStop retyping command lines\n\nIf you need to enter the same commands in the terminal app frequently, use the\ncommander widget to execute them with an easy click.\n\nTimer Widget\n\nBreak work into intervals\n\nUse the timer widget to setup a simple countdown timer that will help you to\nget things done by staying focused for short periods.\n\nNote Widget\n\nWrite quick notes\n\nNeed to write a quick idea or keep an important note in front of you? Use the\nnote widget to place it on the workflow screen.\n\nWorkflow Tabs\n\nOrganize your workflows\n\nIf your project involves activities that can be isolated from each other, or\ncontains sub-projects, or there are too many widgets for a single workflow\nscreen, then split it into multiple workflows and navigate between them using\ntabs.\n\nShelf\n\nOrganize common things\n\nWhen there are some things you need to have constant access to, regardless of\nthe current project or workflow, such as a timer, place them on the Shelf.\n\nUI Theme\n\nSwitch to the dark theme\n\nBy default, the app uses the light color theme. If you prefer dark themes,\nthen you can switch to it.\n\nPrivacy\n\nNo telemetry/tracking\n\nFreeter respects your privacy. The app does not collect nor transmit\ntelemetry, usage tracking or any other data.\n\nGNU GPL\n\nFree Open Source Software\n\nFreeter is Free and Open Source Software, forever. Released under the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\nThe superpower is literally at your fingertips\n\nJust press the Ctrl or \u2318+Shift+F hotkey to access Freeter from anywhere.\n\nDownload Freeter\n\nFor Linux, Windows, Mac OS\n\nMore kind words from happy users\n\n> Just purchased @FreeterApp This is the app I've wanted for a long time and\n> @alex_kaul must've read my mind.
