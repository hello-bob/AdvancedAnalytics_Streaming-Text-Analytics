She was a medical director for the health insurer, a physician with\nsweeping power to approve or reject requests to pay for critical care like\nlife-saving drugs or complex surgeries.\n\nShe had been working at Cigna for nearly 15 years, reviewing cases that nurses\nhad flagged for denial or were unsure about. At Cigna and other insurers,\nnurses can greenlight payments, but denials have such serious repercussions\nfor patients that many states require that doctors make the final call. In\nmore recent years, though, Day said that the Cigna nurses\u2019 work was getting\nsloppy. Patient files that nurses working in the Philippines sent to her, she\nsaid, increasingly had errors that could lead to wrongful denials if they were\nnot corrected.\n\nDay was, in her own words, persnickety. If a nurse recommended denying\ncoverage for a cancer patient or a sick baby, she wanted to be certain it was\nthe right thing to do. So Day said she researched guidelines, read medical\nstudies and scrutinized patient medical records to come to the best decision.\nThis took time. She was clearing fewer cases than many of her peers.\n\nSome of her colleagues quickly denied requests to keep pace, she said. All a\nCigna doctor had to do was cut and paste the denial language that the nurse\nhad prepared and quickly move on to the next case, Day said. This was so\ncommon, she and another former medical director said, that people inside Cigna\nhad a term for these kinds of speedy decisions: \u201cclick and close.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeny, deny, deny. That\u2019s how you hit your numbers,\u201d said Day, who worked for\nCigna until the late spring of 2022. \u201cIf you take a breath or think about any\nof these cases, you\u2019re going to fall behind.\u201d\n\nIn a written response to questions, Cigna said its medical directors are not\nallowed to \u201crubber stamp\u201d a nurse\u2019s recommendation for denial. In all cases,\nthe company wrote, it expects its doctors to \u201cperform thorough, objective,\nindependent and accurate reviews in accordance with our coverage policies.\u201d\nThe company said it was unaware of the use of the term \u201cclick and close\u201d and\nthat \u201csuch behavior would not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nDuring Day\u2019s final years at Cigna, the company meticulously tracked the output\nof its medical directors on a monthly dashboard. Cigna shared this spreadsheet\nwith more than 70 of its doctors, allowing them to compare their tally of\ncases with those of their peers. Day and two other former medical directors\nsaid the dashboard sent a message loud and clear: Cigna valued speed.\n(ProPublica and The Capitol Forum found these other former Cigna doctors\nindependently; Day did not refer them.) One of Day\u2019s managers in a written\nperformance evaluation called the spreadsheet the \u201cproductivity dashboard.\u201d\n\n### Get Our Top Investigations\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

It\u2019s one thing if a\nrushed server forgets the fries with your burger. It\u2019s another entirely if the\npressure to act fast leads to wrongful denials of payment for vital care.\nWalgreens in 2022 dropped measurements of its pharmacists\u2019 speed from their\nperformance reviews after some alleged that practice could lead to dangerous\nmistakes.\n\nProPublica and The Capitol Forum examined Cigna\u2019s productivity dashboards for\nmedical directors from January and February 2022. These spreadsheets tallied\nthe number of cases each medical director handled. Cigna gave each task a\n\u201chandle time,\u201d which the company said was the average amount of time it took\nits medical directors to issue a decision.\n\nDay and others said the number was something different: the maximum amount of\ntime they should spend on a case. Insurers often require approval in advance\nfor expensive procedures or medicines, a process known as prior authorization.\nThe early 2022 dashboards listed a handle time of four minutes for a prior\nauthorization. The bulk of drug requests were to be decided in two to five\nminutes. Hospital discharge decisions were supposed to take four and a half\nminutes.\n\n\u201cMedical directors would message me and say, \u2018We can\u2019t do these cases in four\nminutes. Not if you want to do a good job,\u2019\u201d Day recalled.\n\n> Deny, deny, deny. That\u2019s how you hit your numbers. If you take a breath or\n> think about any of these cases, you\u2019re going to fall behind.\n\n\u2014Dr. Debby Day, a former medical director at Cigna\n\nAs ProPublica and The Capitol Forum reported last year, Cigna built a computer\nprogram that allowed its medical directors to deny certain claims in bulk. The\ninsurer\u2019s doctors spent an average of just 1.2 seconds on each of those cases.\nCigna at the time said the review system was created to speed up approval of\nclaims for certain routine screenings; the company later posted a rebuttal to\nthe story. A congressional committee and the Department of Labor launched\ninquiries into this Cigna program. A spokesperson for Rep. Cathy McMorris\nRodgers, the chair of the congressional committee, said Rodgers continues to\nmonitor the situation after Cigna shared some details about its process. The\nLabor Department is still examining such practices.\n\nOne figure on Cigna\u2019s January and February 2022 dashboards was like a\nproductivity score; the news organizations found that this number reflects the\npace at which a medical director clears cases.\n\nCigna said it was incorrect to call that figure on its dashboard a\nproductivity score and said its \u201cview on productivity is defined by a range of\nfactors beyond elements included in a single spreadsheet.\u201d In addition, the\ncompany told the news organizations, \u201cThe copy of the dashboard that you have\nis inaccurate and secondary calculations made using its contents may also be\ninaccurate.\u201d The news organizations asked what was inaccurate, but the company\nwouldn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nNevertheless, Cigna said that because the dashboard created \u201cinadvertent\nconfusion\u201d the company was \u201creassessing its use.\u201d\n\nDay was afraid to look at the dashboards. Anyone could see that by Cigna\u2019s\nmeasures, she was a laggard. In January 2022, only a third of her peers had\nlower scores, and in February 2022, it was just a quarter.\n\nIn a recorded phone call and in emails with supervisors, Day complained that\nCigna\u2019s metrics failed to account for the quality of decisions. She said she\nand others asked higher-ups how often medical director decisions were\noverturned on appeal but nobody would say.\n\nDay gave Cigna written permission to discuss her employment with ProPublica\nand The Capitol Forum.\n\nThe company described Day as a \u201cdisgruntled former employee\u201d and said her\n\u201cpersonal view is not an accurate representation of the work of the many\nmedical directors and clinicians we employ.\u201d Cigna added that prior\nauthorization requests are often time-sensitive and the company\u2019s \u201cmission is\nto ensure our patients receive the right care as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nCigna rejected the assertions that denying cases was an effective way of\nworking faster. \u201cEven if medical directors were incentivized to review more\nclaims \u2014 which they are not \u2014 it makes no sense to suggest that this\nincentivizes denials; it would be far quicker to approve all claims,\u201d the\ncompany spokesperson wrote. The insurer said that denials take more time\nbecause they require a deeper review of clinical data, potentially requesting\nadditional reviews by senior clinical directors, drafting denial letters and\npossibly phoning the treating physicians.\n\nBut another doctor who had worked at Cigna also said that denying a request\nfor payment was far quicker than approving one since the nurses served up\nlanguage that could be used to justify the denial. That former Cigna medical\ndirector said, \u201cSometimes you just have to accept the nurse and click and\nclose if you had too much work.\u201d (That doctor asked not to be named because\nthey feared repercussions if they commented publicly.)\n\nWhen Debby Day got her job at Cigna in November 2005, she thought it was a\ngodsend.\n\nShe had been working for a health insurance startup in North Carolina. The\ncharismatic founder of the company, Day said, had told her and a handful of\nprincipal executives to expect a windfall when the company went public. That\nnever happened, and Day was eventually left with no job and no severance.\n\nWhen a recruiter mentioned the medical director job at Cigna, it sounded like\na perfect fit. The job was based in North Carolina, but Cigna didn\u2019t mind that\nshe was licensed in California, where she did her residency at Harbor-UCLA\nMedical Center. She was ready to leave the executive track, and the position\nallowed her to put her medical training to good use without the daily grind of\nworking in a clinic.\n\nThe daughter of an ophthalmologist, Day had watched her father perform eye\nsurgery when she was a child, and she found medicine fascinating. When Day\nstarted practicing, she learned quickly that while she enjoyed the\nintellectual challenges of medicine, the hands-on work of seeing patients\ndrained her. As a medical director, she said, \u201cI could really take care of\npatients without having to talk to them all day long.\u201d\n\nCigna, like all health insurers, makes patients get approval in advance for\ncertain treatments. Day became one of the people who reviewed these prior\nauthorization requests, deciding what to cover and what to deny. Everyone Day\nworked with was under one roof in Raleigh, North Carolina. The office buzzed\nwith conversations among colleagues, and she was able to consult with\nspecialists on complex cases.\n\nShe never felt pressure to do anything but make the right decision for the\npatient. At the same time, she said, she didn\u2019t hesitate to reject treatment\nshe thought was improper.\n\nDay describes herself as persnickety but feels that the time she spent\nreviewing case files was essential to reaching the right decision. Credit:\nAndrea Bruce for ProPublica\n\nA couple years into her time at Cigna, Day noticed some doctors prescribing a\ncostly treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG, that helps\npatients with weakened immune systems fight off infections. Only she found\nthey were prescribing it in cases where it didn\u2019t make any medical sense. That\nwasn\u2019t good for patients or for Cigna. \u201cSome of these guys were pouring it\ninto every patient they could get their hands on and then making hundreds of\nthousands of dollars billing for it,\u201d she recalled.\n\nAt the time, Cigna didn\u2019t have a policy for when IVIG should be used, so Day\ndeveloped one based on the scientific evidence available at the time. Day said\nthis saved millions of dollars and that Cigna rewarded her with bonuses and\nstock options.\n\n\u201cIn my head I truly believed that you could marry good health care with\nbusiness,\u201d she said.\n\nAs Day neared the end of her first decade at Cigna, the company closed\nregional offices in favor of a nationwide review system, she said. With\nmedical directors working from home, Day could no longer pop down the hallway\nto consult with doctors in other specialities.\n\nCigna had used a productivity dashboard for years, but by 2019, these metrics\nbegan playing a more prominent role in the company\u2019s evaluations of medical\ndirectors, Day said. Now, making a fast decision seemed more important than\nmaking the right decision, she said. In February 2019 emails to her managers,\nDay openly questioned this system.\n\nHer boss responded: \u201cWe all understand that many cases are involved and take\nmore time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have tried to account for that additional time in\nthe allotment allowed for certain cases.\u201d\n\nStill, he made it clear that transaction volume \u2014 the metric on the dashboard\nthat was similar to a productivity score \u2014 was one of the factors \u201cwe use to\ndetermine merit raises, bonus\u201d and stock awards. When asked about this, Cigna\nsaid that \u201cany assertion that our Medical Directors\u2019 compensation (cash or\nstock) is tied to denials or their handle time for cases is false.\u201d\n\nIn that same 2019 email, Day\u2019s boss added, \u201cWe want to assist every medical\ndirector who wishes to improve his or her efficiency.\u201d\n\nDay shot back, \u201cSome of our newer MDs are quite terrified of the \u2018counting,\u2019\u201d\nshe wrote. \u201cAll ask \u2014 \u2018how is quality measured?\u2019\u201d\n\nSoon, Day realized that her boss wasn\u2019t talking in the abstract about\nimproving efficiency; he was talking about her. She learned that managers were\ngoing to help her pick up the pace of her reviews.\n\nWhen bosses reached out, they didn\u2019t discuss whether she was making the right\ncall, only how long it took her to decide, she said.\n\n> In my head I truly believed that you could marry good health care with\n> business.\n\n\u2014Day\n\nBy then, Day said, Cigna had shifted much of the nursing work to the\nPhilippines. She found mistakes in the case files that these nurses sent. In\nan email to Day, a fellow medical director lamented the amount of time it took\nto untangle one case and said the reports by \u201cthe overseas nurses\u201d were\n\u201cmesses.\u201d\n\nSome of the more astonishing problems that Day spotted have stayed with her.\nIn a case involving a newborn who needed an epilepsy evaluation, Day noticed\nthat a Cigna nurse had listed the mother\u2019s name as the patient, rather than\nthe baby\u2019s. Day fixed that mistake, avoiding what certainly would have been a\ndenial. In another case, a nurse recommended denying payment for an ultrasound\nof the neck because the treatment wasn\u2019t medically necessary. But the nurse\nhad gotten the body part wrong. It was a hip that was injured, and the imaging\nwas needed. An appeal that landed on Day\u2019s desk involved Cigna\u2019s decision to\nreject payment for a test because it wasn\u2019t medically necessary for a patient\nwith a sexually transmitted disease. But Day figured out that the patient had\ntoenail fungus, not an STD.\n\nDay said her bosses didn\u2019t want to hear that she was catching errors. By\nOctober 2020, Cigna had placed Day on a performance improvement plan that\nrequired her to raise her \u201cproductivity level\u201d \u2014 referring to the score on the\ndashboard \u2014 to at least 70%, which would be a significant jump for her but was\nslightly below the median for medical directors. The company made the\nconsequences crystal clear: If she failed to successfully complete the plan,\nshe could be terminated.\n\nProPublica and The Capitol Forum asked Cigna how it calculated that score, but\nthe company wouldn\u2019t say. \u201cTransaction volume helps gauge productivity and\nefficiency \u2014 the amount of work done, not the speed at which it is done,\u201d a\nCigna spokesperson wrote. The company said this metric measured the time a\nmedical director spent on tasks involving medical judgment versus other work,\nsuch as internal meetings or training.\n\nOn the early 2022 productivity dashboard, though, a different calculation\ncould explain Day\u2019s score, and this math reflects how fast medical directors\nreviewed cases. ProPublica and The Capitol Forum multiplied the number of\ncases Day handled by the time Cigna allotted for each type of case, then\ndivided that total by the hours she worked that month. The resulting\npercentage equaled her score. Medical directors who spent every available\nminute of their workdays clearing cases within the time constraints Cigna set\nwould score at least 100%. Indeed, some medical directors had scores greater\nthan 100%, meaning they cleared cases in even less than the allotted time. The\nnewsrooms\u2019 formula accurately reproduced the scores of 87% of the Cigna\ndoctors listed; the scores of all but one of the rest fell within 1 to 2\npercentage points of the number generated by this formula. When asked about\nthis formula, Cigna said it may be inaccurate but didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nDay said her bosses told her that the way to boost her score was to review\nmore cases during her normal work hours.\n\nResponding to questions, Cigna said the productivity dashboard was \u201cprimarily\nused to ensure that we have enough medical directors to perform the amount and\ntype of work that needs to be done.\u201d It is not used, the company said, to\nevaluate the performance of medical directors or track the speed at which\nindividual doctors do their work.\n\nCigna, however, later said of the dashboard that \u201cin the unusual situation\nthat a medical director is a significant outlier to peers performing similar\ntypes of reviews, managers might use this metric as one data point to\nunderstand and discuss the variance with the medical director.\u201d It also said\nDay was placed on a performance improvement plan \u201cto help her meet the most\nbasic standards to support patient care.\u201d\n\nDuring the time Day spent on the performance improvement plan, she refused to\nchange her approach, which she felt was necessary to make the right call.\n\nIn December 2020, she appealed to the human resources department, figuring\nthat colleagues there would see that it was wrong to fire a medical director\nfor taking care to decide critical medical questions.\n\nShe was wrong.\n\n\u201cYou feel that the time constraints/metrics, which are in place to review\nthese cases are unreasonable, for some cases are very complex consisting of\nmultiple pages to review,\u201d a Cigna human resources employee wrote, summing up\nDay\u2019s feelings as the matter escalated.\n\nAnd while Day\u2019s supervisor \u201cappreciates your attention to detail,\u201d the human\nresources employee wrote, he \u201calso realizes that there are metrics in place\nthat he must hold everyone to.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about this, Cigna said, \u201cDr. Day raised questions about her\nperformance improvement plan through appropriate internal ethics channels\navailable to all employees, and there was no wrongdoing found.\u201d\n\nEventually, the daily stress of being pushed to work faster coupled with the\nthreat of being fired took a toll on Day. Sleepless and fighting depression,\nDay was at the breaking point.\n\n\u201cI actually sort of had a mental breakdown,\u201d she recalled.\n\n> At the end of the day, we need to get your productivity up and we don\u2019t have\n> a lot of time to do that.\n\n\u2014Day\u2019s supervisor\n\nOn a recorded call with her boss about her lagging productivity score, Day\nbrought the subject back to the quality of the decisions she was making. Her\nboss made it sound like Day was a broken record.\n\n\u201cWe have the same discussion every time we talk,\u201d he said. While saying\n\u201cnobody\u2019s asking you not to do quality work,\u201d her boss said, \u201cyou must know I\njust have to redirect our discussion.\u201d\n\nBut Day continued: \u201cWhen there is no measurement of quality, then the\ndiscussion will continue to have that element to it.\u201d\n\nThe supervisor said he heard Day\u2019s concerns \u201cloud and clear\u201d but warned that\n\u201cat the end of the day, we need to get your productivity up and we don\u2019t have\na lot of time to do that.\u201d\n\nThe focus on metrics was proof Cigna was losing its way, Day told her boss.\nWhen she started working at Cigna 15 years earlier, there was a \u201ccommitment to\nquality and taking care of our customers.\u201d Day said that it was still\nimportant to her and other medical directors that \u201cwe go home at the end of\nthe day and think we\u2019ve done a good job for Cigna.\u201d\n\nRead More\n\nHow Cigna Saves Millions by Having Its Doctors Reject Claims Without Reading\nThem\n\nIn a response to questions, Cigna said the supervisor, who works in\nCalifornia, was unaware that he was being recorded and that under that state\u2019s\nlaws, it is illegal to record a private phone call without all parties\u2019\nconsent. Day said that she was in North Carolina during the call and that\nNorth Carolina law allows a person on a call to record without getting the\nconsent of others.\n\nDay took a monthslong leave from the job in mid-2021 that allowed her to work\npart time, and she found a therapist who helped her manage the depression.\nWhen she returned, Day said, it was more of the same.\n\nIn the late spring of 2022 she decided to retire from Cigna.\n\nMaya Miller contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under \u2014\n\n  * Health Care\n  * Health Insurance\n\nDavid Armstrong\n\nDavid Armstrong is a reporter at ProPublica specializing in health care\ninvestigations.\n\n  * david.armstrong@propublica.org\n\nMore in Health Care\n\nHeart Failure\n\n### Texas Appeals Court Throws Out Defamation Lawsuit Against ProPublica,\nHouston Chronicle\n\nThe news outlets\u2019 2018 investigation into famed Houston heart surgeon Bud\nFrazier provided a \u201cfair, true, and impartial account,\u201d the court said in its\nruling, potentially bringing a close to the nearly six-year legal battle.\n\nby Jeremy Schwartz, April 25, 6 p.m. EDT\n\nLost Mothers\n\n### What to Know About the Roiling Debate Over U.S. Maternal Mortality Rates\n\nA new study challenged the accuracy of public health data on deaths related to\npregnancy and childbirth \u2014 and the narrative of high and rising U.S. maternal\nmortality rates.
