To date, the company has not seen evidence of exfiltration of\n> materials such as doctors\u2019 charts or full medical histories among the data.\n\nThis data exfiltration occurred despite, Change Healthcare making a $22\nmillion dollar ransom payment to ALPHV/Blackcat. The company was targeted\nagain by RansomHub, who claimed that ALPHV stole the original payment and\nthreatened to sell the data to the highest bidder.\n\nThe staggering scale of data compromised in this breach is matched by the\nprofound financial consequences. The Healthcare Financial Management\nAssociation reported last week that during a Q1 financial results investor\ncall, the company leaders said the Change Healthcare cyberattack had a roughly\n$870 million impact on UnitedHealth Group (UHG) through March. The company\nprojects that direct costs for the full year will be between $1 billion and\n$1.15 billion, with revenue loss at $350-450 million.\n\n\u201cThe effect of the attack in the period is one of keeping all the lights\nbrightly burning at full readiness to resume services while revenue production\nwas essentially suspended,\u201d UGH president and CFO John Rex said.\n\nSome might see this incident as an argument against ever paying a ransom\n(which all law enforcement and government agencies advise against) but it\u2019s\nalso easy to see how Change Healthcare could have decided to fork over $22\nmillion as a shot in the dark at restoring their systems and preventing data\nleak and revenue loss.\n\nUnitedHealth Group reports that pharmacy services are back to 99% of normal\nlevels and that medical claims across the U.S. health system are \u201cflowing at\nnear-normal levels.\u201d Payment processing is at approximately 86% of pre-\nincident levels. The company said it expects \u201cfull restoration of other\nsystems to be completed in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\n## Change Healthcare Reportedly Compromised Through Lack of Multi-Factor\nAuthentication on an Application for Remotely Accessing Systems#\n\nA source familiar with the investigation told the Wall Street Journal that\nChange Healthcare was compromised through a lack of multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA) on an application that gives staff remote access to\nsystems. This happened nine days before the company knew about the breach,\ngiving ALPHV ample time to exfiltrate data.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s Office for Civil\nRights issued a letter and opened an investigation into the Change Healthcare\nincident due to \u201cthe unprecedented magnitude of this cyberattack,\u201d which\nprecipitated a massive disruption in health care and billing.\n\nThe preface of the letter cites ransomware and hacking as the health care\nindustry\u2019s chief cyber threats over the past five years:\n\n> Ransomware and hacking are the primary cyber-threats in health care. Over\n> the past five years, there has been a 256% increase in large breaches\n> reported to OCR involving hacking and a 264% increase in ransomware. In\n> 2023, hacking accounted for 79% of the large breaches reported to OCR. The\n> large breaches reported in 2023 affected over 134 million individuals, a\n> 141% increase from 2022.\n\nThis incident painfully demonstrates that ransomware payments don\u2019t guarantee\ndata security or prevent future attacks. Market consolidation, combined with\nlegacy technologies used in health care systems, makes the industry ripe for\nransomware attacks. These types of centralized systems that handle sensitive\ndata remain prime targets, and a single breach can expose the protected health\ninformation of millions.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nGet notified when we publish new security blog posts!\n\n## Related posts\n\nBack to all posts\n\nSecurity News\n\n### How Threat Actors are Abusing GitHub\u2019s File Upload Feature to Host Malware\n\nGitHub is susceptible to a CDN flaw that allows attackers to host malware on\nany public repository.\n\nBy Sarah Gooding - Apr 23, 2024\n\nSecurity News\n\n### The Dark Side of Open Source\n\nAt Node Congress, Socket CEO Feross Aboukhadijeh uncovers the darker aspects\nof open source, where applications that rely heavily on third-party\ndependencies can be exploited in supply chain attacks.\n\nBy Sarah Gooding - Apr 19, 2024\n\nResearch\n\nSecurity News\n\n### npm Package for ReExt React Components Library Exfiltrates Git Credentials\n\nThe Socket Research team found this npm package includes code for collecting\nsensitive developer information, including your operating system username, Git\nusername, and Git email.\n\nBy Sarah Gooding, Socket Research Team - Apr 18, 2024\n\nProduct\n\n  * Package Alerts\n\n  * Integrations\n\n  * Docs\n\n  * Pricing\n\n  * FAQ\n\n  * Roadmap\n\nAbout\n\n  * About\n\n  * Love\n\n  * Blog\n\n  * Glossary\n\n  * Discord Community\n\n  * CareersHiring\n\n  * Send Feedback\n\n  * Contact Us\n\n  * System Status\n\nPackages\n\n  * npm Package Directory\n\n  * Explore npm Packages\n\n  * Go Package Directory\n\n  * Explore Go Packages\n\n  * Maven Package Directory\n\n  * Explore Maven Packages\n\n  * PyPi Package Directory\n\n  * Explore PyPi Packages\n\n  * Most Popular JS Packages\n\n  * Top JavaScript Maintainers\n\n  * Removed npm Packages\n\n  * Random npm Package\n\nStay in touch\n\nGet open source security insights delivered straight into your inbox.\n\n  * Terms\n  * Privacy\n  * Security\n\nMade with \u26a1\ufe0f by Socket Inc\n\n", "frontpage": false}
