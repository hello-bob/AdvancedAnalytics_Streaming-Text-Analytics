Carta has since removed him from the website, though\nthe company hasn\u2019t yet submitted documentation around his departure to\nsecurities regulator, FINRA, according to the regulator\u2019s current records.\n\n\u201cToday will be my last day,\u201d Kim wrote in a Slack message to Carta employees\non Apr. 19, adding later that he looks forward \u201cto being able to commit more\nof my time and energy to my family\u201d and that he will be \u201crooting for you all,\nand will enjoy watching Carta grow!\u201d\n\nA Carta spokesperson confirmed Kim\u2019s departure, but would not comment on the\nnature of his exit. Kim did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nKim continues to be listed on FINRA regulatory filings as the chief executive\nof Carta\u2019s broker-dealer, Carta Capital Markets, which is the division that\norchestrated tender offers and stock purchases. Carta CEO Henry Ward had told\ncustomers Carta would exit its secondaries business in January, shortly after\none of its customers accused it of using his startup\u2019s confidential data\nwithout his approval to build out its own order book. The customer\u2019s\nallegations, which were posted on X, had gone viral, leading Carta to\ntemporarily suspend its sales outreach.\n\nCarta confirmed to Fortune on Thursday that it had completely exited the\nsecondaries business, but that it still continues to do company-initiated\ntransactions like tender offers.\n\nApart from his involvement in Carta\u2019s liquidity business, Kim has long been\ninvolved in Carta operations, formerly as chief operations officer before he\nleft the company in 2016, then later as head of operations when he returned,\naccording to his LinkedIn. His most recent title, according to previous\nversions of Carta\u2019s website, was chief delivery officer.\n\nCarta has had a tumultuous year, dealing with multiple public scandals. Apart\nfrom the upheaval regarding its liquidity business, Carta is currently engaged\nin multiple lawsuits with former employees, including with its former CTO and\na former sales rep who has accused its chief revenue officer of sexual\nharassment.\n\nCarta, which works with approximately 40,000 startups, was last valued at $8.5\nbillion and is backed by venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz\nand Menlo Ventures.\n\nDo you have an insight to share?
