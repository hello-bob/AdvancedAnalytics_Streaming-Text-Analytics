No\nmatter where you are in the world, you\u2019ll find this pen in homes, offices,\nschools and pretty much everywhere else. This iconic design has reached every\ncorner of the Earth \u2013 and at some point in your life, you\u2019ve almost certainly\nused this pen.\n\nSince it\u2019s release in 1950, more than 100 billion of these pens have been sold\nworldwide, blowing the next best-selling products out of the water. Amazingly,\nthe design has remained basically unchanged for over 70 years \u2013 and it still\ncontinues to dominate the world, with 14 million being sold every day.\n\nBIC Cristal design evolution (Primal Space)\n\nThe impact this pen had on the world was monumental \u2013 pen prices dropped and\nliteracy rates shot up. But what made this pen so successful?\n\nWe\u2019re going to tell the incredible story behind this pen, and how its clever\nuse of physics made it the most perfect design. But to really understand how\nrevolutionary this pen was, we need to go back in time.\n\n### When pens were bad\n\nIn the past, pens were expensive and difficult to use. Traditional quills were\nmessy and had to be constantly dipped in ink. Because of this, writing was\nseen as more of an art form, limited to those that could use a pen. Then, the\nfountain pen was invented, which had a metallic nib and could store the ink\ninside the pen\u2019s reservoir.\n\nEarly fountain pen\n\nAlthough this was an improvement, the nib was scratchy and couldn\u2019t control\nthe flow of ink \u2013 causing sudden blobs to leak out onto the paper. On top of\nthis, they were still super expensive, costing around 150 dollars in today\u2019s\nmoney. At the time, only around 20 percent of the world could read and write,\nand this wasn\u2019t making it any easier.\n\n### The ball-point pen\n\nBut at the end of the 19th century, a breakthrough was made. American inventor\nJohn Loud came up with a mechanism that fed the ink onto the page using a\nsmall ball instead of a thin nib. This would in theory spread the ink more\nevenly and stop it from blotching. He had just invented the ball-point pen.\nWhile his design worked well on tougher surfaces like leather and wood, it was\ntoo rough on paper \u2013 and so his pen never sold. But crucially, his design\nplanted the tiny seed that would lead to BIC\u2019s success.\n\nJohn Loud\u2019s ball point pen patent\n\n### Problems with the ball-point pen\n\nDecades went by and many new designs were made, but none of them could master\nthe ball-point pen. If the ball was too tight in its socket, the ink would\nclog up and it wouldn\u2019t reach the paper. If it was too loose, the ink would\nleak out and smear all over the page. Getting this right was extremely\ndifficult, since the tiny ball was difficult to make with any kind of\naccuracy. Then came Lazlo Biro, a man with a name you might recognize. He\nrealized that the solution was in the ink.\n\nMost pens at the time used thin water-based ink, which was leaky, slow drying\nand would seep through the fibers of the paper. It also relied on gravity to\nfeed the ink onto the ball, which depending on the angle of the pen, gave\nreally poor results.\n\n### Experimenting with pen ink\n\nHe started experimenting with oil-based inks, which were thicker, dried almost\ninstantly and sat on top of the paper, instead of seeping through. This turned\nout to be a stroke of genius \u2013 and it unlocked a unique physical effect that\ncaused the ink to be mysteriously pulled onto the ball, without gravity or any\nexternal forces.\n\nWater-based ink vs oil-based ink (Primal Space)\n\nThis is called Capillary action and it\u2019s what allows water to climb tree roots\nand nutrients to flow around our body. We can see this effect in action by\nplacing a thin tube into some water and watching it climb. But what\u2019s\nhappening here?\n\n### Capillary action\n\nThe attraction between the liquid and the walls of the tube is stronger than\nthe attraction that binds the liquid particles together. And so the particles\nat the top get pulled up by the side of the tube, until the weight of the\nwater eventually cancels out the force.\n\nCapillary action (Primal Space)\n\nIn Biro\u2019s pen, this effect was happening upside down. The ink was being pulled\nthrough by the ultra thin walls of the tip and onto the ball, ensuring that it\nwas constantly covered in ink.\n\n### The Biro pen\n\nIn order to master the ball-point pen, Biro came up with a new design that\nwould pull the ink onto the ball without gravity or moving parts, producing a\nconsistent and smooth line on the page. Biro mastered his design, and his pen\nbecame a hit in South America. But there was still one huge problem. The\ncheapest pen he offered cost an incredible 190 dollars in today\u2019s money. And\nso although the design was great, he never achieved mass market success. At\nthis point, literacy rates had only hit around 33%, and pens remained a luxury\nitem.\n\n### Making the BIC Cristal\n\nBut just a few years later, French manufacturer Marcel Bich discovered Biro\u2019s\npen, and saw a huge opportunity. He bought the patents for 2 million dollars\nand began designing a new and improved version that could be mass-produced for\na much cheaper price. With the help of state-of-the-art Swiss watchmaking\nmachines, he developed a method for mass producing tiny stainless-steel balls,\nto within a fraction of a millimeter. Instead of using metal for the rest of\nthe pen, he bought machines that could mold plastic, something that had only\nbeen around for a few years at this point. This was the end result.\n\n### The BIC Cristal\u2019s design\n\nAlthough it may just look like a pen, it\u2019s hard to overstate just how perfect\nthis design turned out to be. There were no moving parts, springs or complex\nmaterials, yet every element had multiple purposes. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nThe pen had a hexagonal barrel, like a pencil, which stopped it from rolling\noff tables and made it easier to grip. It was made from polystyrene, which was\nstrong, cheap and transparent, allowing the ink level to be seen at all times.\n\nThere was a tiny hole on the barrel, which allowed air to enter and replace\nink as it left the pen. If it didn\u2019t have this hole, the pressure difference\nat higher altitudes would cause the ink to be pushed out the pen. And so the\nhole was also there to maintain the outside air pressure. The ink inside the\ncartridge was a special recipe that maximized the capillary effect whilst\nstill producing a good quality line. Each pen had enough ink to produce about\n3 kilometers of line.\n\nCross section of the BIC Cristal tip (Primal Space)\n\nThe ink flowed into the tip of the pen, which contained the stainless steel\nball. The ball was machined so accurately and could move just enough to spin\nand deposit ink onto the page. When the pen wasn\u2019t being used, the ball would\ncreate a seal, stopping ink from leaking out the bottom. If the pen was turned\nupside down, the capillary action and the surface tension of the ink would\nstop it from falling out the back of the pen.\n\nThe lid, which also doubled as a clip, was made from polypropylene, which\nabsorbed impacts and stopped the pen from cracking. The pen was so perfectly\nsimple and solved every problem that plagued previous pens. It was reliable,\ncomfortable to use and produced a smooth and consistent line. Most of all, it\nwas cheap, hitting the market in 1950 at just 2 dollars \u2013 much cheaper than\nthe 190 dollar alternatives.\n\n### Worldwide success\n\nIt was an instant success, selling around 10,000 units daily in France during\nits first year. Marcel realized how English speaking countries were\npronouncing his name, so he dropped the \u2018H\u2019 and the Bic name was born. Marcel\nunderstood the importance of the economies of scale \u2013 and he quickly expanded\nto other continents, setting up factories all over the world.\n\nThe 4 main BIC Cristal colors (Primal Space)\n\nBy 1953, he was already selling 40 million pens per year, and the BIC Cristal\ntook over the world. Now, anyone in the world that wanted to write or draw\ncould do so, and it was easy. Literacy rates rose all around the world, and\nthe demand for a good pen went through the roof. The world had secretly been\nbegging for this product, and it came at the perfect time. Over the next 50\nyears, 100 billion of these pens were sold and literacy rates went from 35% to\nalmost 90%.\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to imagine life without this pen \u2013 and the fact that\nits design has remained almost exactly the same since day 1 shows just how\nperfect it was.\n\n### References\n\n  * https://www.cascade.app/studies/bic-strategy-study\n  * https://steemit.com/history/@aakashsinha/bic-the-company-behind-the-pen\n  * https://u.osu.edu/bicpens/03-manufacturing/\n  * https://newatlas.com/technology/biro-pen-changed-writing-game/\n  * https://www.dayspringpens.com/blogs/the-jotted-line/who-invented-the-ballpoint-pen-history\n  * https://penlimitedelkos.medium.com/the-science-behind-smooth-writing-how-ballpoint-pens-work-f63fa5d0ac12\n  * https://www.writepads.com/blogs/news/the-mightiest-pen-a-brief-history-of-the-ballpoint-pen\n\n#### Ewan Cunningham\n\nWriter, editor and creator of the Primal Space channel.\n\n0 Comments\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\n#### More Stories\n\nAstronomy\n\n## Communicating with space, how do we do it?\n\nFalcon 9\n\n## How SpaceX Gets These Amazing Camera Shots\n\nFalcon 9\n\n## How does SpaceX transport the Falcon 9?\n\nFalcon 9\n\n## Why doesn\u2019t the sound of a rocket launch kill you?\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n\n#### Enter Giveaway\n\n#### Every month we do a giveaway on the Primal Space YouTube channel.
