When its fossil was first discovered in 1861, some\npeople thought it was an angel.\n\nThough scientists have found some evidence suggesting even earlier bird-like\ndinosaurs could fly, the timeline remains in question. And how birds evolved\nall the features they\u2019d need for flight before they could actually benefit\nfrom flying is still unclear. There\u2019s an age-old question about avian\nevolution, says avian paleontologist Chris Torres of Ohio University: What use\nis half a wing?\n\n> You don\u2019t have to think about flying, your spinal cord just takes over.\n\nRecently, researchers found some clues to the evolution of flight by creating\nthe first maps of living birds\u2019 brain activity during flight and rest. A team\nof scientists trained eight large white pigeons to fly back and forth between\nperches in a lab. Then they injected them with tracer and used a PET scanner\nto record activity (glucose metabolism) in different parts of their brains\nwhen they were at rest on the perch and after a short period of flight. To see\nwhich areas were more active during flight, they compared the scans.\n\nThe cerebellum stood out in bright red, says Amy Balanoff, an assistant\nprofessor at Johns Hopkins University and one of the paper\u2019s authors. These\nare early data in only one species, and they don\u2019t track brain activity second\nto second, but the scans showed statistically significant increases that were\nmost dramatic in a few folds of the cerebellum\u2014folds known to be involved in\nprocessing visual information.\n\nThe data likely reflect the parts of the brain engaged in starting, stopping,\nor changing direction during flight, the researchers say, because the actual\nwing strokes of flight, like the steps humans take while walking, seem to be\nmore controlled by the spinal cord. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to think about walking,\nyou don\u2019t have to think about flying, your spinal cord just kind of takes\nover,\u201d Balanoff says.\n\nBalanoff and her co-authors went one step further to connect the brain signals\nto fossils: They looked inside the skulls of dinosaurs that are most closely\nrelated to modern birds. Then they used three-dimensional scans to create\ndigital casts of these shapes to estimate the size and shape of the animals\u2019\ncerebellums.\n\n\u201cThe cerebellum, it\u2019s sitting on the back of the brain like a bump,\u201d says\nDouglas Wylie, a professor of biological sciences at the University of\nAlberta. \u201cSo you\u2019re able to make some estimates of the cerebellar size\nrelative to the rest of the brain.\u201d\n\n> What use is half a wing?\n\nThe fossil record shows that dinosaur cerebellums expanded significantly well\nbefore the age of archeopteryx 150 million years ago, hinting that earlier\ncreatures like maniraptorans may have flown. Or they at least enjoyed the\nimproved balance and muscle coordination that likely came with a bigger\ncerebellum, and later animals may have made use of those abilities as they\nevolved to fly.\n\n\u201cBehavior is extraordinarily difficult to reconstruct from the fossil record,\u201d\nsays Torres, who studies avian fossils. \u201cWe are operating with a tiny sliver\nof the amount of data that describes the bird\u2019s biology.\u201d There\u2019s not enough\nevidence to give any sense of variation among species, leaving researchers\nwith only minimal clues toward how birds first took off.\n\nAmong those hints, researchers spotted some areas thought to be involved with\nflying that actually didn\u2019t light up more after birds flew. Still, because the\nbirds weren\u2019t doing much steering or dodging in the test environment, the\nbrain activity of the pigeons might differ from typical bird flight in the\nwild, noted Andrea Gaede of the Royal Veterinary College of London, who\nstudies visual motion processing. And some brain areas may be just as active\nat rest\u2014showing no increase in flight\u2014because they are working at different\ntasks during rest.\n\nTorres hopes brain activity data like these can help fill out the picture of\nhow other behaviors evolved. He wants to understand why geese and ducks are\nstill here when so many powerful dinosaurs are not. \u201cThe only dinosaurs that\nmade it are the only ones that we can definitively say were capable of powered\nflight,\u201d Torres said. \u201cUnderstanding the origins of powered flight helps us\nunderstand the origins of modern-day biodiversity.\u201d\n\nThe full article was previously published in Nautilus.\n\n## Plantings\n\nIssue 30 \u2013 December 2023\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nViriditas: Musings on Magical Plants: Portulaca oleracea By Margaux Crump\n\nProboscis, Pollen, and the Rapture of Interspecies Intimacy By Jake Eshelman\n\nThe Greening of Milan: Porta Nuova and Vertical Forest By Gayil Nalls\n\nOvershooting Earth\u2019s Boundaries: An Interview with Bill Rees By Rachel Donald\n\nThe Garden of the Five Senses By Gayil Nalls\n\nEat More Plants Recipes: Le Botaniste\u2019s Fennel, Tomato, and Red Pepper Pasta\nSauce\n\nNature Sketching with WS/C\n\nNature Sketching with WS/C\n\nOctober: Capturing Landscapes in Light, Shade, and Color By Gayil Nalls, Liz\nMacklin, and Karen Bauer\n\nElena Renken is a science reporter focusing on the brain and medicine.
