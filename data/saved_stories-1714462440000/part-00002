The birds breed in North America and migrate to southern Mexico and Central\nAmerica in winter. Credit: Carl von Ossietzky-Universit\u00e4t Oldenburg\n\nMigratory birds are able to navigate and orientate with astonishing accuracy\nusing various mechanisms, including a magnetic compass. A team led by\nbiologists Dr. Corinna Langebrake and Prof. Dr. Miriam Liedvogel from the\nUniversity of Oldenburg and the Institute of Avian Research \"Vogelwarte\nHelgoland\" in Wilhelmshaven has now compared the genomes of several hundred\nbird species and found further evidence that a specific protein in the birds'\neyes is the magnetoreceptor which underlies this process.\n\nThe researchers found that there have been significant evolutionary changes in\nthe gene that encodes the protein cryptochrome 4 and that certain groups of\nbirds have lost it entirely.\n\nThese findings are indicative of adaptation to varying environmental\nconditions and support the theory that cryptochrome 4 functions as a sensor\nprotein.\n\nThe study was prompted by research at the Universities of Oldenburg and Oxford\n(UK), which has shown that magnetoreception is based on a complex quantum\nmechanical process that takes place in certain cells in the retinas of\nmigratory birds.\n\nIn a paper published in the journal Nature in 2021, the German-British team\npresented findings according to which it was highly likely that cryptochrome 4\nwas the magnetoreceptor they had been looking for: first, they were able to\nprove that the protein is present in the birds' retina, and second, both\nexperiments with bacterially produced proteins and model calculations showed\nthat cryptochrome 4 exhibits the suspected quantum effect in response to\nmagnetic fields.\n\nInterestingly, the research also demonstrated that these proteins are\nsignificantly more sensitive to magnetic fields in robins, which are migratory\nbirds, than in chickens and pigeons, which are resident species.\n\n\"Consequently, the reason why cryptochrome 4 is more sensitive in robins than\nin chickens and pigeons must be found in the protein's DNA sequence,\" says\nLangebrake, who was the lead author. \"The sequence was probably optimized by\nevolutionary processes in these nocturnal migratory birds.\"\n\nIn the current study, the team led by Langebrake and Liedvogel, therefore,\ninvestigated magnetoreception from an evolutionary perspective for the first\ntime. The researchers analyzed the cryptochrome 4 genes of 363 bird species\nranging from the little spotted kiwi to the song sparrow.\n\nFirst, they compared the protein's evolutionary rate with that of two related\ncryptochromes and found that the gene sequences of the cryptochromes used for\ncomparison were very similar across all bird species: They appear to have\nchanged very little over the course of evolution. This is most likely due to\ntheir key role in regulating the internal clock\u2014a mechanism that is essential\nfor all birds and in which modifications would have extremely negative\neffects.\n\nCryptochrome 4, by contrast, proved to have been highly variable. \"This\nsuggests that the protein is important for adaptation to specific\nenvironmental conditions,\" explains Liedvogel, who is Professor of Ornithology\nat the University of Oldenburg and director of the Institute of Avian\nResearch. The resulting specialization could be magnetoreception. \"A similar\npattern has been observed in other sensory proteins such as light-sensitive\npigments in the eye,\" she explains.\n\nThe researchers then took a closer look at how the gene sequence for\nchryptochrome 4 has evolved in the evolutionary history of birds. The results\nled the scientists to conclude that, in particular, in the case of the\npasserine (Passeriformes) order, the protein has been optimized through rapid\nselection. \"Our results indicate that evolutionary processes could have led to\ncryptochrome 4 specializing as a magnetoreceptor in songbirds,\" says\nLangebrake.\n\nAnother interesting finding was that in three clades of tropical\nbirds\u2014parrots, hummingbirds, and Tyranni (Suboscines), also known as\ntyrants\u2014the information for cryptochrome 4 has been lost in the evolutionary\nprocess, meaning that these birds are unable to produce the protein. This\nindicates that it does not play a vital role in their survival. However, while\nparrots and hummingbirds are sedentary, some tyrants are long-distance\nmigrants who, like small European songbirds, fly both during the day and at\nnight.\n\n\"The fact that, unlike robins, they do not have cryptochrome 4 makes them an\nideal system for investigating various hypotheses about magnetoreception,\"\nsays Langebrake.\n\nAn interesting question here is: have the Tyranni developed a magnetic sense\nthat works independently of cryptochrome 4? Or are they able to orientate\nthemselves without a magnetic sense?\n\nAnother possibility is that their magnetic sense has the same characteristics\nas that in robins, which is light-dependent and can be disrupted by radio\nwaves, for example. \"The first two scenarios would strongly corroborate the\ncryptochrome 4 hypothesis, while the third would pose a problem for the\ntheory,\" the biologist emphasizes.\n\nAs a next step, the research team is therefore planning to investigate\nmagnetic orientation in Tyranni and clarify whether or not they have a\nmagnetic sense. \"The Tyranni clade provides us with a natural tool for\nunderstanding the function of cryptochrome 4 and the importance of\nmagnetoreception in migratory birds,\" says Liedvogel, outlining a starting\npoint for further research.\n\nThe research is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B:\nBiological Sciences.\n\nMore information: Corinna Langebrake et al, Adaptive evolution and loss of a\nputative magnetoreceptor in passerines, Proceedings of the Royal Society B:\nBiological Sciences (2024).
