Thierry Carrez, the vice\nchairperson of the OSI, for example, recently issued a dire warning: \u201csingle\nvendor is the new proprietary.\u201d Sounds terrible, right? I mean, once you\nforget that the vast majority of software that you and I use every day on our\nphones, laptops, servers, etc., is proprietary. (Yes, with plenty of open\nsource buried inside and effectively \u201crelicensed.\u201d)\n\nHere\u2019s just a tiny bit of data that makes these concerns seem silly: Of the\n10,000-plus companies that participate in Linux Foundation projects (and open\nsource more generally), there have been exactly 14 single-vendor relicensing\nevents. Yes, 14. And of those 14, despite all the digital ink we spill talking\nabout the critical need to fork to maintain freedom, only three have been\nforked. Again, that\u2019s 14 projects/repositories out of the 162 million that\nGitHub reports.\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re fixating on very few edge cases when there are\nsignificant, foundational issues in open source that need fixing.\n\n#### [ The best open source software of 2023 ]\n\n## A question of trust\n\nBad actors are striking at the very nature of how open source works. The\nwonderful thing about open source is that anyone can participate, but that can\nalso be a weakness. As we saw recently with the XZ Utils exploit, and again\nmore recently with a similar attack, sophisticated bad actors (perhaps backed\nby nation-states) are using the standard open source contribution process to\ninfiltrate relatively obscure but widely used projects.\n\nSuch social engineering tactics are hard to detect, given the nearly infinite\nattack surface that open source offers and the sophisticated nature of more\nrecent attacks (which emerge at runtime). Of course, the open nature means\nspotting the problems and fixing them may be easier than in proprietary\nsoftware. But with developers including open source code in close to 100% of\nall software, including proprietary, spotting all problems becomes a serious\ngame of Whac-A-Mole.\n\nThe Linux Foundation and others are already working on ways to introduce new\nways to deepen trust in the open source process. Their ideas should work for\nrecent attempts to exploit open source packages, where contributions were\nproposed by newcomers to the project under suspicious circumstances. But would\nit have stopped the XZ Utils exploit, which happened over the course of years?\nThat seems less likely.\n\nAttempts to improve open source processes are also complicated by the nature\nof most open source software: It\u2019s not written by a single vendor or even by a\ncommunity of vendors. It\u2019s written by a solo developer in her free time. Given\nthose realities, what can be done? According to Jack Cable and Aeva Black,\nboth at the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n(CISA), it comes down to vendors doing what some of us have been advocating\nfor years. As they argue, \u201cEvery technology manufacturer that profits from\nopen source software must do their part by being responsible consumers of and\nsustainable contributors to the open source packages they depend on.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d add that perhaps we should start at the top, with the vendors that make\nthe most from open source yet sometimes give the least. Yes, trillion-dollar\ncloud companies make tens of billions off open source but can hardly muster\ntens of thousands of lines of code for any given project. Want open source\nsecurity to improve overnight? Hold vendors accountable for giving back, as\nCISA suggests.\n\n## Making open source AI accessible\n\nAnother massive issue: artificial intelligence. Or, rather, the difficulty of\napplying open source to AI. I won\u2019t go into the details here as I\u2019ve already\ndone that at length (see here or here), but there\u2019s also the problem of\naccessibility in AI. By one estimate, it cost OpenAI $78 million to train\nGPT-4, and Google spent $191 million to train its Gemini Ultra model. These\naren\u2019t the only large language models, of course; there are many, including\n\u201copen source\u201d AI models (in air quotes because even by the OSI\u2019s\nacknowledgement, it\u2019s not yet settled what open source means in AI). It\u2019s\nstill up for debate whether code is truly open if only the very richest\ncompanies can afford to use it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new problem, of course. The exact same issue plagues the cloud.\nNearly 20 years ago I asked open source execs at Google and Yahoo! why they\ndidn\u2019t contribute more code. They rightly took umbrage. Both companies were\namong the leaders in open source contributions, but one of them also said, in\neffect, \u201cEven if we open sourced our infra you couldn\u2019t use it because you\nlack the resources to do anything with it.\u201d\n\nIn cloud we\u2019ve uncovered ways to get around this (Kubernetes, for example),\nand hopefully, we\u2019ll see something similar with AI. Until we do, however, open\nsource in AI might be like putting code in a museum; you can look, but there\u2019s\nno practical way to touch the code or use it.\n\nBack to my central premise. We can choose to spend our time wringing our hands\nover an infinitesimal number of open source projects relicensing to better\nenable themselves to invest in security and continued innovation (Disclosure:\nI work for one of these), and we can make hand-wavey statements about \u201copen\nsource AI\u201d without defining it or making it useful for rank-and-file\ndevelopers (and/or their employers). Or we can do the harder, more important\nwork of figuring out how to make open source work more securely for everyone\non the planet and ensure AI isn\u2019t just for the richest companies. This harder\nwork will pay real societal dividends. The former will\u2014at most\u2014get you kudos\non X/Twitter.\n\nNext read this:\n\n  * Why companies are leaving the cloud\n  * 5 easy ways to run an LLM locally\n  * Coding with AI: Tips and best practices from developers\n  * Meet Zig: The modern alternative to C\n  * What is generative AI?
