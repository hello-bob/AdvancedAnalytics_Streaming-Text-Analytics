That\u2019s where\nCodium AI comes in. It\u2019s a AI based that helps to simplify and automate the\ntest generation process. In this blog, we will delve into how Codium AI can be\nemployed to effortlessly generate tests for an open-source PHP project. We\nwill be looking at the Google API Client Library for PHP as our project.\n\nCodium AI seamlessly integrates with Integrated Development Environments\n(IDEs), allowing developers to automatically generate meaningful tests. Our\nfocus in this tutorial is on the Google API Client Library for PHP, a project\nwith an extensive list of tests covering various Google APIs such as Gmail,\nDrive, YouTube and more.\n\n## PHPUnit & Testing\n\nPHP remains a powerhouse in web development, and PHPUnit serves as a robust\ntesting framework for PHP projects. The project that we are working with is\nbuilt to provide simple access to Google APIs and is built with testing in\nmind. In fact, support for testing with PHPUnit is included out of the box and\na phpunit.xml file is already set up for the application by default. PHPUnit\nallows you to organize your tests into test suites, which are logical groups\nof tests. This helps you run specific sets of tests and provide better\norganization for your tests.\n\n## How To Test PHP based projects With CodiumAI\n\nThere are three ways to generate tests with Codium AI:\n\n  1. Generate Tests From Components Directly: Ideal for testing components with straightforward setups, such as business logic classes and utility code.\n  2. Generate tests from a Single, Simple Test: Tailor tests based on an existing simple test, incorporating the project\u2019s testing style. Some people write a single test in the \u201cstyle\u201d of the project, and then generate tests on top of them.\n  3. Extend Existing Test Suite: Enhance the existing test suite, especially useful for complex setups or when adhering to preferred practices. While currently supporting JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, PHP support is on the horizon.\n\n## CodiumAI Pane \u2013 Features and Configurations\n\nLet\u2019s look at the configuration options before we continue. You can add\ninstructions \u2013 which are specific prompts \u2013 that can guide CodiumAI in test\ngeneration. We\u2019re going to use the PHP project\u2019s standard PHPUnit framework,\nand can also optionally incorporate reference tests for a more tailored\napproach.\n\nMoreover, you can customize the number of tests created \u2013 more or less than\nthe default 6.\n\nIn addition, CodiumAI allows you to tweak existing tests automatically. For\ninstance, if you identify a missing check, or want to check the credentials of\na user before the file upload, you can just use this chatGPT-like\nfunctionality to change the existing test. Now let\u2019s get to generating the\ntests.\n\n##\n\nCode. As you meant it.\n\nTestGPT\n\nTry Now\n\n## Test Generation\n\nOur focus today would be enhancing the test suite for REST APIS. Let\u2019s start\nwith Google Drive APIs. Looking more carefully at the test Suite it is evident\nthat we have pretty good test coverage and every line is covered \u2013 so coming\nup with new test ideas is a pretty difficult task. This is exactly where\ncodiumAI really shines. We\u2019ll let CodiumAI brainstorm some tests for us for\ntesting the URL Authenticator. It delves into the core function of the API\nclient, generating a variety of tests that can enhance the testing suite\nsignificantly.\n\nOnce the tests have finished generating, we can find a set of tests crafted by\nCodium AI tailored specifically to our project in the advanced tests pane. We\ncan add these tests to our project and run it within the test suite.\n\nYou can also provide additional instructions for instance to add an additional\nclientID with an updated expected URL using the TEST GPT functionality.\n\nNow that we have added tests from CodiumAI\u2019s suggestions, reviewed them, and\neven modified then using TestGPT, let\u2019s now take a look at how we can generate\na completely new custom test with Codium AI. We\u2019ll first let the AI generate\nsome tests for us based on the component of our choice \u2013 we are particularly\nfocusing on the decoding of the HTTPS response given a particular stream of\ninput. Let\u2019s see what tests are generated by AI to test the decodeHTTp\nresponse function.\n\nWe have a test to decode the response and check for the HTTPS status code\ngiven a valid json. But what happens when an invalid JSON stream is passed?\nIdeally we would want to handle it graciously with proper status code. Let\u2019s\nask for a test using the New custom test widget. We will allow CodiumAI to\ngenerate this test for me which will supposedly check if the API is able to\nhandle an invalid JSON stream.\n\nWe can see that the test generated checks for the format. And checks this\nagainst the expected HTTP status code\n\nIt\u2019s worthwhile to note that Codium AI has a PR pull request assistant which\nyou can use to automate many of the tasks associated with creating a pull\nrequest \u2013 like generating a description, suggesting improvements, looking for\nsimilar issues and more.\n\n## Summary:\n\nIn conclusion, we\u2019ve successfully harnessed the capabilities of CodiumAI to\ngenerate and enhance tests for an open-source PHP project. We\u2019ve navigated\nthrough the intricacies of testing within the Visual Studio code environment,\nensuring that our tests align seamlessly with the project\u2019s objectives.
