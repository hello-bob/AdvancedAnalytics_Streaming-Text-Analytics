(Courtesy: J Bibette)\n\nOil and water famously don\u2019t mix \u2013 at least, not without adding a surfactant\nsuch as soap to coax them into a stable combination. Now, however, researchers\nin France and US have turned this conventional wisdom on its head by showing\nthat they can, in fact, mix without a surfactant. The finding could have wide-\nreaching implications for industries that make heavy use of such mixtures,\nincluding food, cosmetics, health, paints and packaging to name just a few.\n\nA mixture of two immiscible liquids such as water and oil is known as an\nemulsion. When an emulsion is shaken vigorously, one of its component liquids\nmay disperse into small droplets within the other. But if the emulsion is left\nto stand, its components invariably separate out again.\n\nThe main driver of this separation is that as droplets of each liquid move\ncloser to each other, they coalesce into ever-larger droplets. To prevent\nthis, a third component may be added that is amphiphilic, meaning that it has\nan affinity for the interface between the mixture\u2019s two components. Today\u2019s\nindustrial emulsions rely on the use of such materials, which are termed\nsurfactants. However, many surfactants are toxic for both humans and the\nenvironment. Reducing their use (or doing away with them altogether) would\ntherefore be highly beneficial.\n\n### A counter-intuitive phenomenon\n\nIn the latest work, researchers from the Collo\u00efdes et Mat\u00e9riaux Divis\u00e9s\nLaboratory at the ESPCI in Paris, France; the French company Calyxia, which\nspecializes in the design and manufacture of biodegradable microcapsules; and\nHarvard University in the US studied mixtures composed solely of water and\nvarious types of oil. Within these normally immiscible mixtures, they observed\nultrathin but abnormally stable films of oil spontaneously appearing between\nthe dispersed droplets of water.\n\n\u201cThis phenomenon systematically induces adhesion between the droplets while\npreventing them from coalescing, so allowing us to disperse large proportions\nof water (80% by volume or more) in oil,\u201d explains J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bibette, the\nchemical physicist and ESPCI laboratory director who led the research.\n\n### Stable over several weeks\n\nThe phenomenon, which is detailed in Science, works best for highly polar oils\nthat contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components and have a high\nmolecular weight. These criteria exclude aliphatic hydrocarbons such as\nmethane and polyethylene, for example, but include oils containing alternating\noxygen and carbon atoms \u2013 a category that encompasses all vegetable oils.\n\nThe researchers found that these oils can change their configuration as soon\nas they are confined between two drops of water by \u201cchoosing\u201d to\npreferentially locate their hydrophilic parts towards the water and the\nhydrophobic parts away from it. \u201cThe ultrathin adhesive film induced by the\naffinity of the hydrophobic parts develops spontaneously as soon as the two\ninterfaces approach,\u201d Bibette says. \u201cThe film then acquires an enormous\nviscosity while reducing the free energy of the interface \u2013 something that\nmanifests itself by the water and oil drops adhering together.\u201d\n\nSuch spontaneous gelling between two immiscible liquids had never been\nobserved before, he adds.\n\nRead more\n\n####\n\nColloidal mixture exists in up to six phases at once\n\nSince most vegetable oils can be polymerized, combining them with water could\nallow researchers to make perfectly biodegradable polymeric materials. For\nBibette, one of the most obvious applications that springs to mind is\nbiodegradable capsules for industries such as cosmetics and fragrances.\n\nThe technique could also allow researchers to create new types of plastics\ncomprising biodegradable polymers and up to 90% water by volume, he tells\nPhysics World. \u201cBoth phases could be made (and controlled to be) homogenous\nthroughout the entire mixture, which could allow us to produce a unique bi-\ncontinuous, coexisting hydrophilic and hydrophobic material,\u201d he says. \u201cThis\ncould have applications in areas as diverse as tissue engineering,\nbiodegradable packing and materials for replacing plastics in general.\u201d\n\nIsabelle Dum\u00e9 is a contributing editor to Physics World\n\n### Download your publishing guide\n\nA step-by-step guide unlocking your research\u2019s scientific impact\n\nRead previous\n\n  * Biophysics\n  * Research update\n\n#### Single-cell nanobiopsy explores how brain cancer cells adapt to resist\ntreatment\n\nRead next\n\n  * Ultracold matter\n  * Research update\n\n#### Individual polyatomic molecules are trapped in optical-tweezer arrays\n\n## Discover more from Physics World\n\n    * Polymers\n    * Research update\n\n### Sticky materials un-stick themselves in jumps\n\n    * Nanomaterials\n    * News\n\n### Quantum dot pioneers win Nobel Prize for Chemistry\n\n    * Materials for energy\n    * Research update\n\n### New photovoltaic 2D material breaks quantum efficiency record\n\n## Related jobs\n\n  * New York City | Columbia University - Columbia Nano Initiative (CNI/CISE)\n\n#### Senior Staff Associate III \u2013 Cleanroom Director\n\n  * Yorkshire and the Humber | Luxinar\n\n#### Ultrashort Pulse Laser Applications Engineer\n\n  * United States | Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n\n#### Metals Process Scientist - Materials Science Division\n\n## Related events\n\n  * Materials | Symposium Eighth International Symposium on Dielectric Materials and Applications (ISyDMA'8) 12\u201416 May 2024 | Orlando, US\n  * Materials | Symposium The Eigthth International Symposium on Dielectric Materials and Applications (ISyDMA'8) 12\u201416 May 2024 | Orlando, US\n  * Materials | Exhibition The Advanced Materials Show 2024 15\u201416 May 2024 | Birmingham, UK\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by IOP Publishing Ltd and individual contributors\n\n#### Explore Physics World\n\n  * About us\n  * Our team\n  * Our portfolio\n  * Advertising\n  * Contact us\n  * Feedback\n  * Sign in\n  * Register\n\n#### MORE INFORMATION\n\n  * Institute of Physics\n  * Join the Institute\n  * Modern Slavery Act\n  * Privacy and Cookies\n  * IOP Publishing\n  * Copyright\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Disclaimer\n\n#### OUR MISSION\n\nPhysics World represents a key part of IOP Publishing's mission to communicate\nworld-class research and innovation to the widest possible audience.
