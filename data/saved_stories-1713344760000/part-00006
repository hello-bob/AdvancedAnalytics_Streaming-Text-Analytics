Different types of aircraft that travel at different\nspeeds, in different flight environments and with various forms of propulsion\nhave their own unique vulnerabilities when it comest to run-ins with birds.\nThis has resulted in specific design elements built into modern aircraft that\nwork as countermeasures against bird strikes and engine ingestions.\n\nFor instance, fighter jets often have reinforced windscreens capable of\nlessening the severity of a bird strike at lower speeds, while airliners, with\ntheir big high-bypass turbofan engines, are designed to be able to ingest\nbirds up to a particular size without flaming out. But even the most advanced\nengines can only ingest so much mass before realizing a catastrophic loss of\npower. Maybe the most famous example of this was the \u201cMiracle On The Hudson\u201d\nwhen Captain Sully made a successful gliding descent into the Hudson in an\nA320 full of passengers after ingesting geese in both of the aircraft\u2019s\nengines shortly after takeoff.\n\nHigh performance fighter engines, with lower bypass ratios, are more\nsusceptible to catastrophic bird ingestions than their big high-bypass\nturbofan cousins. As such, fighter pilots take a particular interest in\navoiding birds, especially flocks of them. But considering the speeds that\nthese aircraft are moving at, and how busy their pilots are in the cockpit,\nsometimes birds cannot be avoided, as seen in the video below. In fact, even\nif the bird doesn't take down the jet, the pilot's reaction to the strike\ncould.\n\nAn amazing example of this is the photo seen above, taken by aviation\nphotographer, air traffic controller, and veteran AWACS crewman, Louis\nDePaemelaere (check out his site here), at Buckley Air Force Base in Colorado.\n\nThe picture shows one of the 120th Fighter Squadron F-16C\u2019s blasting out of\nBuckley and right into a small gathering of birds, one of which had a dramatic\ncollision with the Viper\u2019s ALQ-131 electronic countermeasures pod mounted on\nits centerline station. A bit higher and the result of such a collision could\nhave been far more severe.\n\nThe result of an F-16's canopy meeting a bird in flight. , DoD\n\nAlthough the F-16\u2019s single-piece bubble canopy was engineered to withstand a\nstrike from a four pound bird while traveling at 350 knots, and the Block 30\nF-16C\u2019s GE-F110 engine was designed with bird ingestion failure resistance in\nmind, encounters with birds can lead to quick and dramatic flight terminations\nfor the single engine fighter, as seen in the amazing video below. And even in\nthe case of the photo above, maybe ingesting one of these bird would not have\nresulted in the total loss of the aircraft, but multiple ones surely could\nhave.\n\nThe USAF takes bird strikes very seriously, and along with air bases and co-\nlocated civilian airports that their aircraft are based at, Bird Aircraft\nStrike Hazard (BASH) prevention programs have been put into place.\n\nThe DoD describes its BASH initiative and the need for it as such:\n\n\u201cEach year, civil and military aircraft strike thousands of birds. The Federal\nAviation Administration annually reports at least 2,300 wildlife related\nstrikes involving civil aircraft; the Air Force and Navy/Marine Corps report\nat least an additional 3,000. Strikes involving military aircraft cause in\nexcess of $75 million in damage every year. Yet only an estimated 20 percent\nof actual bird strikes are reported. Because pilots and crews use the same low\naltitude airspace as large concentrations of birds, the prevention of bird\nstrikes is of serious concern to the military.\n\nDoD continually implements and improves aviation safety programs in an effort\nto provide the safest flying conditions possible. One of these programs is the\nBird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) prevention program. Throughout the\nmilitary, air operations, aviation safety, and natural resources personnel\nwork together to reduce the risk of bird and wildlife strikes through the\nOperational Risk Management process. Development and implementation of an\neffective BASH program requires constant interaction between air station's\nnatural resources, aviation safety, and air operations communities as well as\nthe pilots and aircrews. Habitat modifications and scaring birds away from the\nrunways is an integral part of the answer, but understanding the behavior and\nmovements of birds in relation to the airfield environment and military\ntraining routes by pilots and aircrews is also a critical factor in reducing\nbird strikes.\"\n\n\"Knowing what types of birds and animals are using the airfield environment\nthroughout the year is critical to reducing BASH risks. A Wildlife Hazard\nAssessment will identify areas of the airfield that are attractive to wildlife\nand provide recommendations to remove or modify the attractive feature.\nCorrective recommendations may include removing unused airfield equipment to\neliminate perch sites, placing anti-perching devices on equipment to remain,\nwiring streams and ponds, brush/tree removal, the use of pyrotechnics, or\nchanging the grass mowing program.\n\nBy identifying the bird species involved and the location of the strike,\nresearchers and airport managers can better understand why the species is\nattracted to a particular area of the airport or training route. To identify\nbirds involved in strike events, remains of the birds must be collected and\nturned in for analysis. If the remains are only snarge (blood, bits of tissue,\nand goo) or feather fragments, these are sent to the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nThe Smithsonian Feather Identification Lab can do DNA analysis on blood\nsamples as well as microscopic feather analysis. Using a feather bank\ndeveloped for the military and civilian aviation communities, the Smithsonian\nInstitution can analyze the micro-structure of the barbs from the sample to\nnarrow down a bird involved in a birdstrike event to species. In knowing the\nspecies of bird involved in a birdstrike event, managers can investigate the\nhabitat and food habits of the species and begin the process of reducing or\neliminating the attractants.\"\n\nTechnology is also advancing BASH risk reduction effectiveness. Radar\nornithology uses radar images obtained from the National Weather Service's\nWSR-88D Doppler radar or mobile radar units to track migrating birds and\nimportant stopover areas. GIS layers of bird radar activity can be layered\nwith actual low level route information along with historic birdstrike data.\nSome of the tools using radar technology include the Bird Avoidance Model\n(BAM), Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS), and mobile marine radars that are\nimplemented at the airfield.\u201d\n\nSo yeah, BASH is not just about telling pilots to watch out because it\u2019s\nmigrations season, it is much more scientific than that and the technology\nbeing garnered from it will continue to have a positive impact on both\nmilitary aircraft and civilian aircraft operational safety.\n\nContact the author Tyler@thedrive.com\n\nAir ForcesF-16FightersU.S. Air Force120th FSBASHBird StrikeBuckley AFBF-16C\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
