Node.js is the undisputed king of server-side development with\nJavaScript, but Bun has gained popularity thanks to its unbelievable\nperformance capabilities. The real question is, though: does it really make\nsense to use Bun instead of Node.js?\n\nLet's learn about Bun and Node.js, dig into their characteristics, and explore\nsome scenarios where Bun can be a better alternative to Node.js.\n\nJoin us on this journey to discover what Bun offers compared to Node.js!\n\n## What Are Bun and Node.js?\n\nBun is a new JavaScript runtime designed for server-side execution of both\nJavaScript and TypeScript. It\u2019s developed in Zig, a low-level programming\nlanguage that allows Bun to reach extreme levels of performance. Thanks to\nthat, it\u2019s suitable for developing high-speed server applications.\n\nNode.js is the most popular JavaScript runtime for server-side development.\nIt\u2019s supported by a vast ecosystem of npm packages and a community of millions\nof users. That\u2019s helped Node.js become widely used for building web\napplications, APIs, and backends.\n\nBun and Node.js are both JavaScript runtimes. At the same time, while they\nboth provide the ability to run JavaScript on the server, they differ in their\ncore focus and characteristics.\n\n## Bun and Node.js: Pros and Cons\n\nTo better understand when to use Bun over Node.js, you first need to look at\nthe benefits and drawbacks of the two technologies. This will help you to see\nwhich is the best option in specific scenarios.\n\nLet\u2019s jump into the pros and cons of Bun and Node.js!\n\n### Bun\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Pros:\n\n  * Extreme performance: Bun's core focus is on executing JavaScript as fast as possible.\n  * TypeScript support: Bun supports TypeScript natively and out of the box, with no additional configuration required.\n  * Node.js compatibility: It\u2019s designed to integrate with existing Node.js codebases and npm libraries.\n\n\u2193 Article continues below\n\n#### Is your app broken or slow? AppSignal lets you know.\n\nMonitoring by AppSignal \u2192\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Cons:\n\n  * Too new: Bun 1.0 was released on September 8th, 2023. This makes it relatively new, so there is a lack of documentation, questions over its stability, and a small community.\n  * Limited API: As a young technology, the roadmap still involves many key features.\n  * Zig popularity: Zig isn\u2019t a popular language, which impacts community contributions.\n\n### Node.js\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Pros:\n\n  * Large community and ecosystem: Node.js can boast more than 25 million users and a million libraries.\n  * Highly stable: Since its first release in 2009, the technology has become mature and stable.\n  * Easy to use: Node.js wouldn\u2019t have become so popular if its API wasn\u2019t so intuitive.\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Cons:\n\n  * Doesn\u2019t support TypeScript natively: Adding TypeScript requires extra dependencies and configurations.\n  * node_modules grows big: The folder used to install dependencies can easily reach gigabytes of space and hundreds of thousands of files.\n  * Not standard compliant: Node.js has only recently begun to adopt web standards such as Fetch API. Many have yet to be implemented.\n\n## 5 Scenarios To Adopt Bun Over Node.js\n\nLet's explore five scenarios (based on the above pros and cons) where Bun\nproves a better alternative to Node.js.\n\n### 1\\. When Performance Is Key\n\nIn most cases, Bun is faster than Node.js. Zig offers great control over code\nexecution, which allows maintainers to optimize for performance at a low\nlevel. Bun is also based on the fast and efficient JavaScriptCore engine. In\ncontrast, Node.js is written in less efficient JavaScript and relies on the\nslower V8 JavaScript engine.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bun processes start 4x faster than Node.js. Plus, the\nnpm-compatible package manager provided by Bun is 25x faster than npm install.\nSpeed is one of the project's design goals, as you can see by running the\nbenchmarks in the official repository.\n\n### 2\\. When You Want an All-in-One Solution\n\nBun is a complete toolkit for building JavaScript apps. In particular, it\nincludes:\n\n  * bun run: A CLI command to execute JavaScript/TypeScript files.\n  * bun install: A Node.js-compatible package manager designed to be a faster replacement for npm and yarn.\n  * bun test: A built-in, fast, Jest-compatible test runner to execute tests with the Bun runtime.\n  * Bun.build: A native bundler to build server-side JavaScript applications efficiently. At the time of writing, it\u2019s still in beta.\n\nThanks to its built-in test runner, bundler, and package manager, Bun provides\na cohesive developer experience. This ensures consistency and efficiency\nthroughout the software development process.\n\n### 3\\. When Module Resolution Might Become a Problem\n\nModule resolution in JavaScript is a complex topic, as CommonJS and ES modules\ndon't always easily coexist. The Node.js ecosystem is built on CommonJS. It\nhas been difficult to add support for ES modules. The problem is that\ninteroperating between the two module systems brings large challenges. On top\nof that, TypeScript enforces its own set of rules around imports. That's why\nthe transition from require() to import instructions is taking years.\n\nBun aims to provide a consistent module resolution system that just works.\nSome game-changing features offered by this system are:\n\n  * Import paths can optionally include extensions.\n  * You can import any file or package, even .cjs files.\n  * You can require() any file or package, even .ts or .mjs files.\n  * You can use require() and import statements in the same file.\n\nThat greatly simplifies module resolution, saving time in making libraries\nwork together.\n\n### 4\\. When You Need an Efficient Built-In Internal Database\n\nSQLite is a popular self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration SQL\ndatabase engine. Its embeddable nature makes it an excellent choice as an\ninternal database. It enables you to manage structured data without the\ncomplexity of traditional databases.\n\nIf you're building a web application that requires an internal database and\nwant to limit external dependencies, Bun is a great option. It comes with a\nbuilt-in bun:sqlite module, a high-performance implementation of an SQLite3\ndriver. Its API is inspired by the popular better-sqlite3, but bun:sqlite\nguarantees from 3 to 6 times better performance.\n\n### 5\\. When You Want to Be Able to Switch to Node.js\n\nBun is still an immature technology, but that shouldn't discourage you from\nusing it. For sure, as your project grows big, the need for a more stable and\nwidely-known technology like Node.js may arise. But thanks to Bun's goal of\nbecoming fully compatible with Node.js, that's not a big problem. Bun is\ndesigned as a drop-in replacement for Node.js, and transitioning from one to\nthe other is a relatively smooth process.\n\nStarting with Bun gives you access to its modern features and high-performance\nadvantages. If, one day, you need Node.js, you can switch your codebase with\nlittle effort. This flexibility ensures that your project can evolve and adapt\nto changing requirements. Thus, Bun is an attractive choice not only for its\nimmediate benefits but also for long-term maintainability goals.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nIn this blog post, we looked at why and when Bun can be a good replacement for\nNode.js.\n\nYou now know:\n\n  * About Node.js and Bun, and why they can be compared\n  * The pros and cons of Bun\n  * The pros and cons of Node.js\n  * Five scenarios where Bun is a better choice than Node.js\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nP.S.
