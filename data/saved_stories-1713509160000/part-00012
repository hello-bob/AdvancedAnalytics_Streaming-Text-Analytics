The hallmarks of aging are a set of\nbiological mechanisms that are finely regulated and strictly interconnected,\ninitiating or contributing to biological changes and anticipating several age-\nrelated diseases. The complex network of cellular and intercellular\nconnections between the hallmarks might represent a possible target for the\nresearch of agents with pleiotropic effects. Vitamin D (VitD) is known to have\na positive impact not only on muscle and bone health but also on several\nextra-skeletal districts, due to the widespread presence of Vitamin D\nReceptors (VDRs). VitD and VDR could be molecules potentially targeting the\nhallmarks of the aging network. To date, evidence about the potential effects\nof VitD on the hallmarks of aging is scarce in humans and mainly based on\npreclinical models. Although underpowered and heterogeneous, in-human studies\nseem to confirm the modulatory effect of VitD on some hallmarks of aging and\ndiseases. However, more investigations are needed to clarify the pleiotropic\neffects of VitD and its impact on the hallmark of aging, hopefully\nhighlighting the courses for translational applications and potential clinical\nconclusions.\n\nKeywords:\n\naging; vitamin D; hallmarks of aging; clinical studies\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nAging is a complex and multifactorial process, marked by a progressive decline\nin organ functions and an increased risk of age-related diseases and mortality\n[1,2]. At the biological level, it is a universal process characterized by\naccumulating damages linked to different mechanisms and pathways defined as\n\u201challmarks\u201d of aging [3]. These hallmarks manifest not merely during\nphysiological aging; they exhibit tight connections with age-related changes,\noften anticipating alterations associated with age-related diseases and\nclinical phenotypes years in advance. Therefore, a better understanding of the\nfeatures and mechanisms related to the hallmarks of aging becomes crucial for\nthe early identification, prediction, and modulation of trajectories of organs\nand systems\u2019 age-related structural and functional changes. Moreover,\nexperimental manipulation of hallmarks aligns with exacerbating or reducing\naging processes and disease-related pathological changes.\n\nTo date, mammalians are characterized by twelve biological hallmarks of aging,\nnamely genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss\nof proteostasis, disabled macroautophagy, deregulated nutrient sensing,\nmitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, altered\nintercellular communication, chronic inflammation, and dysbiosis [2]. These\nare biomolecular, time-dependent manifestations of alterations and mechanisms\naccompanying the aging process, enabling aging acceleration experiments and\npossibly deceleration interventions [4].\n\nWhile these hallmarks have been extensively discussed in the following\nsection, it is essential to recognize that they do not act as a single\nindependent cause. They are incredibly complex and highly interrelated,\ncomplementing others in explaining some or all features of the aging and age-\nrelated disease processes [5]. Individually or synergistically, hallmarks can\nlead to molecular and cellular damage due to primary, antagonistic, and\nintegrative mechanisms. The cumulative effects of the damages are universally\nadverse and might contribute to the initiation and progression of age-related\ndiseases.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanistic relationship among the hallmarks and identifying\ninterventions that modulate such processes hold promise for developing\nstrategies to intervene in human aging at the earlier onset of such changes\nand thus prevent age-related diseases.\n\nVitamin D (VitD) is renowned for its positive impact on musculoskeletal\nstructure and functions, particularly in preventing falls, fragility\nfractures, impaired locomotion, and mobility disability among older adults\nwith deficient plasma levels [6]. In the aging process, the decline in\nphysical performance is recognized as the first phenotypical clinical feature\nof accelerated aging, preceding and contributing to the onset of muscle-\nskeletal chronic diseases and the burden of disability [7,8,9]. Consistently,\naging is associated with a higher likelihood of vitamin D deficiency and\ndysregulated vitamin D function due to reduced sensitivity to 1,25(OH)2D3.\nThis results from the combined effect of age-related decline in (Vitamin D\nReceptor) VDR expression, impairment of cutaneous vitamin D synthesis, and\naltered expression of vitamin D metabolic enzymes. In addition, poor nutrition\nand reduced exposure to sunlight are commonly seen in long-term care\nrecipients\u2014a population at a particularly high risk of deficiency [10].\nTherefore, the clinical practice guidelines state that serum VitD levels of\nless than 25 nmol/L should be considered as vitamin D deficiency\n(hypovitaminosis D), 25\u201350 nmol/L as insufficiency, and over 50 nmol/L as\nsufficient [11]. Beyond its skeletal benefits, extensive preclinical research\nand some clinical studies support the extra-skeletal advantages of VitD at\nmulti-organ levels through the 1\u03b1-hydroxylase enzyme, which is present in many\ntissues besides bone, including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle\ncells, cardiomyocytes, pericytes, neural stem cells, neurons, astrocytes,\nmicroglia, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, epithelial cells adipocytes, myocytes,\nmonocytes, and macrophages.\n\nThe endocrine, intracrine, and paracrine actions of VitD may suggest its\ninvolvement in attenuating the aging process and the age-related pathological\nchanges associated with multiorgan diseases [12]. Some studies suggest a role\nfor VitD in influencing biological age at the epigenetic level since\nindividuals with low VitD levels are biologically older than people with\nadequate levels [13]. Furthermore, VitD has been extensively investigated\nconcerning age-related diseases, particularly cardiovascular disorders.\nEvidence links low levels of VitD to an increased risk of coronary artery\ndisease, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. VitD supplementation has\nshown protective effects against the development and progression of\ncardiovascular diseases [14]. Therefore, randomized clinical trials were\nconducted to test VitD supplementation for preventing or improving non-\nskeletal diseases related to poor VitD status. Although the results were\nmixed, they support the multitargeting actions of low levels of VitD, which\nsignificantly affect the aging process by regulating cell homeostasis,\ncounteracting oxidative and inflammatory damage, and cellular senescence.\n\nThis narrative review aims to summarize the available evidence regarding the\neffects of VitD on modulating age-related changes, either leading to or\npreventing diseases and frailty. Ultimately, we seek to determine whether VitD\nmay be a feasible intervention for attenuating the hallmarks of aging,\nultimately suggesting a role in promoting healthy aging or decelerating age-\nrelated changes anticipating multi-organ diseases.\n\n## 2\\. Methods\n\nTo serve the purpose of this manuscript, we conducted Pubmed and Embase\nresearch, using keywords comprehending \u201cVitD\u201d and each hallmark of aging as\npreviously described, including \u201cgenomic instability\u201d, \u201ctelomere attrition\u201d,\n\u201cepigenetic alterations\u201d, \u201closs of proteostasis\u201d, \u201cdisabled macroautophagy\u201d,\n\u201cderegulated nutrient sensing\u201d, \u201cmitochondrial dysfunction\u201d, \u201ccellular\nsenescence\u201d, \u201cstem cell exhaustion\u201d, \u201caltered intercellular communication\u201d,\n\u201cchronic inflammation\u201d, and \u201cdysbiosis\u201d, by restricting the search to\ninterventions conducted in the human species. We included English literature\nfor the last ten years (the last search was performed in January 2024), with\nsome exceptions for literature about general concepts.\n\n## 3\\. The Hallmarks of Aging\n\nTen years after the initial report, in 2023, Lopez-Ot\u00ecn et al. revisited the\nhallmarks of aging, expanding the list of common denominators of aging [2].\nThe hallmarks, identified across various organisms with special emphasis on\nmammalians, meet three main criteria. Firstly, they are time-dependent\nmolecular or cellular manifestations of changes or alterations accompanying\naging. Secondly, their experimental modulation may accelerate aging processes,\nand the therapeutic interventions targeting the hallmarks have the potential\nto decelerate, halt, or reverse age-related processes. The hallmarks of aging\nare currently categorized as primary, antagonistic, and integrative. Primary\nhallmarks are the causal agents of cellular damage; they encompass genomic\ninstability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and loss of\nproteostasis. Antagonistic hallmarks include deregulated nutrient sensing,\nmitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular senescence. These initially counteract\ndamages caused by primary hallmarks; however, incidentally or with prolonged\npathway stimulation, the antagonistic mechanisms become harmful, contributing\nto accumulated deleterious age-related changes and processes. Integrative\nhallmarks, such as stem cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication,\nchronic inflammation, and dysbiosis, are interconnected with other damage\nmechanisms and collectively contribute to functional age-related decline\n(Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Pre-clinical data supporting the relationship between diseases and\nhallmarks of aging on the left, and available clinical evidence about the\npotential impact of Vitamin D on the hallmarks of aging, on the right. Legend:\nthe thickness of the arrows is representative of the amount of available\nevidence.\n\nThe hallmarks of aging are strongly related to each other, exhibiting\nintricate interactions, with each contributing to and exacerbating the effects\nof others. Genomic instability crosstalks to epigenetic alterations (e.g.,\nthrough the loss-of-function mutation of epigenetic modifiers such as TET2),\nloss of proteostasis (e.g., due to the production of mutated, misfolded\nproteins), disabled macroautophagy (e.g., through the capacity of autophagy to\nremove supernumerary centrosomes, extranuclear chromatin, and cytosolic DNA),\nderegulated nutrient-sensing (e.g., because SIRT6 is an NAD+ sensor involved\nin DNA repair but also responding to nutrient scarcity), mitochondrial\ndysfunction (e.g., due to the mutation of mtDNA), cellular senescence (e.g.,\nbecause DNA damage triggers senescence), altered intercellular communication\n(e.g., by hampering activation of communication pathways), chronic\ninflammation (e.g., because CHIP and leakage of DNA into the cytosol induce\ninflammation), and dysbiosis (e.g., because mutations in intestinal cells\nfavors dysbiosis, whereas specific microbial proteins and metabolites act as\nmutagens). In addition, senescence can initiate inflammation, which in turn\nmay worsen mitochondrial dysfunction and genomic instability. Epigenetic\nalterations, on the other hand, can influence gene expression, including the\nupregulation of proteins like p16 and p21, which promote senescence. Again,\nthe loss of proteostasis, leading to the accumulation of misfolded and damaged\nproteins, triggers senescence pathways in response to stress. Then,\ndysregulation of the mTOR pathway, which regulates nutrient sensing, can\nincrease mitochondrial dysfunction and impact on its biogenesis and function.\nUltimately, increased ROS release associated with mitochondrial dysfunction\ncan induce epigenetic alterations through DNA methylation and histone\nmodification, which in turn creates a feedback loop of declining mitochondrial\nfunction [15]. The interdependence of the hallmarks unveils the complexity of\nthe aging processes and the intricate links between aging and the organ\u2019s\nthresholds for diseases, and then highlights the need for conceiving aging as\na whole and looking for organisms\u2019 macro-biomarkers that are able to quantify\nthe energetic efforts associated with underlying regulatory or compensatory\nmechanisms leading to diseases [16]. Indeed, whether and how one specific\nhallmark\u2019s experimental accentuation or attenuation affects other hallmarks\ndoes not reveal molecular or cellular beneficial or detrimental effects\nimmediately, given the onset of antagonistic or compensatory mechanisms that,\nover time, fail, given their intrinsic poor sustainability as disease markers.\nIn addition, evidence is needed to identify whether aging is driven by the\ndeterioration of cellular hallmarks converging on a common aging pathway in\nall cells or if independent mechanisms will result in different aging pathways\nin individual cells or tissues. A better understanding of the independence or\ninterdependence of the hallmarks of aging will provide a rational basis for\nthe development of novel therapeutics or interventions to modify the rate of\naging.\n\n#### 3.1. Genomic Instability\n\nThe genomic instability pathway involves accumulating genetic damages caused\nby exogenous (chemical, physical, and biological) agents and endogenous\nchallenges (DNA replication errors, chromosome segregation defects, reactive\noxygen species (ROS), and spontaneous hydrolytic reactions). Such an\naccumulation of damage causes mosaicism, explaining the coexistence of normal\nand pathological aging. DNA lesions, such as mutations, deletions,\ntranslocations, telomere shortening, single- and double-strand breaks,\nchromosomal rearrangements, defects in nuclear architecture, and gene\ndisruption caused by the integration of viruses or transposons, impact genes\nand transcriptional pathways, resulting in dysfunctional cells that compromise\ntissue and organism homeostasis [2]. When alterations impact stem cells,\nleading to their exhaustion or hampering their role in tissue renewal, the\ndamage becomes relevant, accelerating the aging process and increasing\nsusceptibility to age-related diseases [17]. DNA repair deficiencies have been\nlinked to aging, suggesting that interventions reducing the mutational nuclear\nor mitochondrial load and enhancing or rerouting repair mechanisms may slow\naging and delay the onset of age-related diseases. VitD emerges as a potential\nintervention in this context [18].\n\n#### 3.2. Telomere Attrition\n\nTelomeres are nucleotide sequences that protect chromosome ends and preserve\ntheir genomic stability. Telomeres, together with the sheltering complex,\nensure the correct segregation of genetic material during the cell division\ncycle and prevent DNA repair systems [19]. Due to the inability of the\nreplicative DNA polymerases to complete the copy of telomere regions during\ncellular division cycles, a shortening of the telomere cap occurs (i.e.,\ntelomere attrition) with advancing age, then activating a DNA damage response\ncascade leading to cellular senescence or apoptosis [20]. Telomerase activity\nis affected with advancing age, and telomere shortening compromises cell\nfunction and life span and is associated with multiple age-related diseases,\nincluding cardiovascular disease, malignancies, dementia, osteosarcopenia,\nfrailty, and other conditions [21]. Notably, deficient telomerase activity is\nalso associated with pulmonary fibrosis, aplastic anemia, and dyskeratosis\ncongenita, characterized by a hampered regenerative capacity of the affected\ntissues. Telomere attrition is adjustable to intrinsic and extrinsic factors,\nincluding diet and lifestyle, with evidence for protective effects due to VitD\n[22].\n\n#### 3.3. Epigenetic Alterations\n\nAlthough the chromosomes carry genetic information, the epigenome is\nresponsible for the functional use and stability of that valuable information,\nconnecting the genotype with the phenotype [23]. Epigenetic alterations\nrepresent reversible, heritable mechanisms that occur without altering the\nunderlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic changes can either be spontaneous or\ndriven by external or internal influences, and they may potentially explain\ndifferent patterns of aging between genetically identical individuals, such as\nidentical twins [24]. A vast array of enzymatic systems is involved in the\ngeneration and maintenance of epigenetic patterns, including DNA\nmethyltransferases, histone acetylases, deacetylases, methylases, and\ndemethylases, as well as protein complexes implicated in chromatin remodeling\nor in ncRNA synthesis and maturation. Then, the major epigenetic alterations\naffecting aging include alterations in patterns of DNA methylation, abnormal\nposttranslational modification of histones, aberrant chromatin remodeling, and\nthe deregulated function of non-coding RNAs [2]. Diet interventions, exercise,\nand pharmacological interventions based on epigenetic-related compounds,\nincluding VitD [13,25], are the most accepted strategies to target aging and\nage-related diseases in humans [14,24].\n\n#### 3.4. Loss of Proteostasis\n\nThe loss of proteostasis is the mechanism underlying the intracellular or\nextracellular accumulation of impaired proteins\u2019 aggregates (i.e., misfolded,\noxidized, glycated, or ubiquitinylated proteins). Proteome integrity requires\ntight regulation and crosstalk among distinct proteostasis networks, from\ntranslation to degradation. Protein mutations increase their intrinsic\ntendency to misfolding and aggregation, hence saturating the protein repair,\nremoval, and turnover mechanisms required to maintain a healthy state. In\naccelerated aging, the burden of misfolded proteins exceeds the capacity of\ncells to maintain proper proteome integrity and leads to disruptions of\ncellular function [1]. Over time, the enhanced production of erroneously\ntranslated misfolded or incomplete proteins, the slowed translation\nelongation, and the accumulation of oxidative damaged proteins sustain the\ncollapse of the intracellular network for proteostasis. These alterations\nincreasingly distract the chaperones from folding healthy proteins required\nfor cellular fitness and then increase the failure of the quality control\nprotein response to damage. Several preclinical models found evidence about\nthe loss of proteostasis among neurodegenerative diseases. Dietary VitD\nsupplementation has profound effects on protein homeostasis, with preclinical\nstudies showing profound effects on IRE-1, XBP-1, and SKN-1 functions,\nsuggesting the promotion of protein homeostasis and the slowing of aging\nprocesses [26].\n\n#### 3.5. Disabled Macroautophagy\n\nAutophagy is an evolutionary, highly conserved, catabolic process that engulfs\ncytoplasmic materials and dysfunctional organelles by forming a double-layered\nautophagosome that fuses with the lysosome for the degradation and recycling\nof nutrients to maintain cellular homeostasis. Autophagy induces stress\nresponses, and starvation, infection, and toxin exposure trigger the catabolic\nprocess to protect cells. Alterations in the autophagic functions compromise\nthe intrinsic cellular housekeeping functions, limiting the recycling of\nmetabolic substrates (i.e., free amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides, and\nlipids) for the biosynthetic process for cell maintenance and survival,\nfavoring the accumulation of dysfunctional organelles and protein aggregates,\nand limiting the clearance of intracellular microbes through lysosomal\ndegradation [27]. Indeed, autophagy primarily serves as a cytoprotective\nmechanism, and its impairment is associated with neural disorders,\ndevelopmental abnormalities, inflammatory diseases, aging, and cancer [27].\nVitD prompts cellular autophagic activities through genomic and non-genomic\nsignaling, influencing various physiological functions along with calcium\nmetabolism. Autophagic mechanisms regulated by VitD and its receptor exert\nprotective effects in inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis, controlling\ncellular proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, and host immunity by\nactivating antimicrobial defense mechanisms [27].\n\n#### 3.6. Deregulated Nutrient-Sensing\n\nThe nutrient-sensing pathways detect and respond to fluctuations in\nenvironmental nutrient levels. Physiologically, nutrient abundance activates\nanabolism and storage, whereas scarcity triggers homeostatic mechanisms that\nmobilize internal stores through autophagy. The nutrient-sensing network\nincludes extracellular ligands (i.e., insulins, IGFs, and receptor tyrosine\nkinases) with which they interact and intracellular signaling cascades. These\ncascades involve the PI3K-AKT and Ras-MEK-ERK pathways and transcription\nfactors, including FOXOs and E26 factors, which transactivate genes involved\nin diverse cellular processes.\n\nDeregulated nutrient-sensing metabolic status is associated with a compromised\nsomatotrophic axis, which includes the growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1, mainly\nproduced by hepatocytes in response to the blood glucose concentration and\nactivating intracellular signaling pathways. In preclinical models, diminished\nIGF-1 levels and GH/IGF-1 signaling are associated with improved stress\ndefenses, autophagy, and cell survival via reduced PI3K/Akt and mTOR\nsignaling. Moreover, GH receptor deficiency improves the defense from\noxidative stress in healthy tissues and promotes apoptosis in neoplastic cells\n[28]. Modulating or perturbing nutrient-sensing node pathways seems to be a\nrobust way to slow aging processes, extend the human lifespan, and protect\nagainst aging-related diseases. Ongoing studies testing caloric restriction (a\nreduction in caloric intake without apparent signs of malnutrition),\npharmaceuticals, dietary patterns, or genetic interventions are waiting for\nmore convincing results [29,30].\n\n#### 3.7. Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nMitochondrial structure and dynamics change with aging. Mitochondria from\nolder subjects swell while their numbers decline and cannot replace themselves\nas quickly as in their optimal functional state [31,32]. Mitochondrial\ndysfunction follows the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations, the\nincreased production of ROS and related damage to cellular macromolecules, the\nimpaired cellular bioenergetic and higher permeabilization of mitochondrial\nmembranes, causing inflammation, altered stress responses, and cell death\n(when activators of caspases, nucleases, or other lethal enzymes are released\nfrom the intermembrane space). Notably, mitochondrial dynamics and quality\ncontrol changes promote the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, which\ncontributes to aging and age-related pathologies. In addition, several cardiac\nand neurodegenerative diseases, muscle atrophy, and sarcopenia recognize\nalterations in mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery [33]. Strategies\naiming to counteract the age-related decline in L-carnitine levels, which may\nlimit fatty acid oxidation by mitochondria, have revealed improvement or\nrescue of mitochondrial dynamics and quality control defects in a placebo-\ncontrolled trial on pre-frail subjects and older men [34]. Mitochondrial-\nderived peptides are emerging as key players in mitochondrial dysfunction\nthrough interactions with stress-sensitive transcription factors. Humanin is a\nmicroprotein encoded by mtDNA that declines with age, exhibits high levels in\ncentenarians and their offspring, and emerges as a potential anti-aging factor\nlinking organellar function to organismal homeostasis [35]. Humanin lacks\ncontributions to cellular senescence, chronic inflammation, and cognitive\ndecline [36]. Concerning mitochondrial dysfunction, VitD directly promotes and\nprevents protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage and indirectly\nregulates autophagy, inflammation, epigenetic modifications, DNA\nabnormalities, and calcium and ROS signaling changes [37].\n\n#### 3.8. Cellular Senescence\n\nSenescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest in response to different\ndamaging stimula. During development, adulthood, and after injury, senescent\npathways play a pivotal role in tissue remodeling, acting as a positive\nregulator of the regenerative potential and function of tissues. Senescent\ncells are also a strong safeguard against tumorigenesis, pacing irreversible\nproliferation arrest via cell and non-cell autonomous pathways. In aged\norganisms, the accumulation of cellular senescence and the release of secreted\nfactors (SASP) adversely modify the behavior of senescent and non-senescent\ncells, remodel the extracellular environment, and sustain inflammation and\ntumorigenesis. Dysfunctional senescent cells may be powerful targets for slow-\naging approaches, but the existence of beneficial senescence programs\ncomplicates the development of interventions without incurring toxicities\n[38]. Nutrition and a healthy lifestyle are intimately linked and can greatly\nimpact cellular senescence. Nutritional elements can influence cellular\nsenescence, with evidence for VitD from both in vitro and in vivo research\n[39]. In preclinical models, interventions targeting senescent cells have been\nshown to delay, prevent, or alleviate tissue damage and multiple disorders.\nSenolytic drugs may target selectively senescent cells, inducing their lysis,\nleading to promising strategies for preventing or treating multiple diseases\nand age-related conditions in humans. However, in some cases, their molecular\ntargets have not been precisely identified and characterized, making them hard\nto introduce in clinical practice in the short term [40].\n\n#### 3.9. Stem Cell Exhaustion\n\nStem cell exhaustion refers to the numerical decline and impaired dynamics of\nthe constitutional stem cells; both aspects are crucial strategies for living\norganisms. With unstable populations of proliferating stem cells, tissues and\norgans lose their ability to recover from primary or injury-induced damage and\nbegin to fail. Cellular de-differentiation, plasticity, and cellular\nreprogramming, i.e., the plasticity of resident stem cells under normal\nconditions, are the main mechanisms for tissue renewal and repair. While stem\nand progenitor cells are all subject to the same hallmarks of aging, the\nmechanism of cellular reprogramming is thought to act autonomously on multiple\ncell types, with higher relevance for the long-term impact on tissue\nrejuvenation. Cellular re-programming consists of the conversion of adult\nsomatic cells into embryonic pluripotent cells; transient reprogramming\nconfers repair capacity to old tissues so that subsequent damage is repaired\nas efficiently as in young individuals; partial reprogramming encompasses\nfeatures of the natural process of tissue repair, according to the finding\nthat the epigenetic methylation clock accelerates soon after tissue injury and\npartially reverses during tissue repair [2]. A large body of the preclinical\nliterature reports stem cell-based interventions\u2019 therapeutic impacts on\ntumors, fibrotic disorders, and tissue damage [41]. Human trials of any stem\ncell therapy must be approached cautiously due to the risk of genetic and\nepigenetic alterations occurring during their induction and manipulation. So\nfar, insufficient clinical evidence supports the effectiveness and safety of\nanti-aging stem cell infusions [42]. Therefore, we are waiting for findings\nfrom trials looking for the effects of stem cell-based interventions on\nphysical frailty and skin aging, which are still in their development phase\n[43].\n\n#### 3.10. Altered Intercellular Communication\n\nAging is characterized by altered intercellular communication due to extensive\nchanges in the amount and secretion of cellular factors and hormonal signaling\npathways. On one side, neural, neuroendocrine, and hormonal signaling pathways\ndecline with aging due to intrinsic adaptations, including adrenergic,\ndopaminergic, and insulin/IGF1-based and renin-angiotensin systems and sex\nhormones. On the other side, intrinsic cellular alterations and environmental\ncellular exposures increase the SASP (senescent-associated secretory\nphenotype) and extracellular vesicles (EVs), acting as carriers for\nintercellular messaging through miRNAs that progressively impact the function\nof neighboring and distant cells, modifying the body\u2019s coordinated functions\nand responses. The intercellular communication derangements ultimately sum up\nthe hallmarks of aging on its own bridging the cell-intrinsic hallmarks to\nmeta-cellular hallmarks, including chronic inflammatory reactions, impaired\nimmunosurveillance against pathogens and premalignant cells, and alterations\nin the bidirectional communication between the human genome and microbiome.\nThe main focus in this area is exploring the effects of blood-borne systemic\nfactors on pro-aging or pro-longevity properties. VitD is a fine-tuned\nimmunomodulatory molecule that impacts immunosenescence and inflammaging, with\nevidence showing that adequate VitD levels help counteract the natural decline\nin immune surveillance [44].\n\n#### 3.11. Chronic Inflammation\n\nInflammation is a ubiquitous mechanism evolved to protect an organism from\ninfection and injury. While the inflammatory cascade in response to acute\ninfection or injury clears invading pathogens and incites wound healing,\nchronic inflammation is a potentially pathologic process arising from the\nperpetuity of the initial trigger or the dysregulation of signaling pathways\nthat is harmful to health. The term \u201cinflammaging\u201d has been coined to describe\nsuch a low-grade, chronic inflammation process that progresses with age and\nimpacts several processes. Chronic inflammation occurs because of multiple\nderangements stemming from the hallmarks of aging, and then it progressively\nincreases according to different trajectories depending on the\nspatial\u2013temporal degree of interaction between coexistent hallmarks and\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors [45]. The VitD immunomodulatory role is widely\nrecognized to have positive effects on health span and lifespan. An adequate\nlevel of VitD counteracts inflammation with multilevel targeting effects,\ni.e., inhibiting the expression and signaling of TLR2, 4, and 9, reducing the\nproduction of cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-6, and Il-23, and repressing the\nactivity of T cells recruiting chemokines [46]. The combination of VitD and\ncurcumin supplements has been recently hypothesized to counteract\nneurodegeneration [44].\n\n#### 3.12. Dysbiosis\n\nDysbiosis refers to an imbalance in the gut microbiome, which can occur\nbecause of several factors related to host genetic variants (ethnicity),\ndietary factors, and lifestyle habits (culture), as well as environmental\nconditions (geography), which makes it challenging to unveil the relationships\nbetween the microbiota and pleiotropic age-associated disease manifestations.\nIn the context of the human microbiome interaction, dysbiosis negatively\nimpacts health, acting as a catalyst factor for fueling inflammation.\nMoreover, interventions aimed at restoring a youthful microbiome may extend\nhealth span and lifespan, with several inflammatory microbial metabolites,\nincluding SCFAs, and exopolysaccharides microbially derived, downregulating\ngut inflammation [47]. Caloric restriction diets induce structural changes in\nthe gut microbiome, increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus and other\nspecies that influence healthy aging. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled pilot study in overweight/obese insulin-resistant volunteers showed\nthat the oral administration of pasteurized A. muciniphila improved insulin\nsensitivity and reduced insulinemia and plasma total cholesterol levels [48].\nNotably, the composition of the intestinal microbiome could be altered by vitD\ndeficiency, and supplementation has been determined to improve gut microbiomes\nwith a positive impact on their overall health and immune system function.\nUltimately, fecal microbiota transplantation opens the possibility of\nmanipulating the gut microbiota with pre-, pro-, and post-biotics to\nrejuvenate the immune system and connected organs, prospecting the analysis of\nmicrobiome data for personalized patient care [49].\n\n## 4\\. Vitamin D and Its Potential Impact on the Biological Hallmarks of Aging\n\nVitD is a highly regulated fat-soluble hormone, and biosynthesis starts after\nsubcutaneous UV irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol. UV radiation plays a\ncrucial role in initiating the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-\nvitamin D3, which further transforms into cholecalciferol, following the\nmevalonate pathway and the Kandutsch\u2013Russell branch of the sterol pathways.\nInterestingly, VitD shares common metabolic pathways with cholesterol; their\nbiosynthesis starts with acetyl coenzyme A (AC-CoA) in the cytosol and\nrecognizes the influence of similar SNPs [50]. Cholecalciferol then converts\ninto calcidiol (25(OH)D) after liver metabolic activation and finally into the\nactive form calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D). The active form of VitD is involved in\nseveral complex metabolic pathways, occurring in several cellular types, and\nspanning extracellular regions, cytosol, lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, and\nmitochondria. Both circulating calcidiol and calcitriol bind to the VitD\nbinding proteins (VitD-BP), then calcitriol dissociates in tissues to bind to\nthe VDR, a nuclear receptor transcription factor, and calcidiol seems able to\nbind accessory pockets of the VDR [51]. The calcitriol uptake into cells\noccurs in both bound and unbound forms and regulates calcium and phosphorus\nhomeostasis through binding to VDR [52]. Beyond bone metabolism, VitD-BPs have\nimmunomodulatory functions, being a negative acute phase protein with levels\ndropping by about a third in patients with acute health conditions [53].\nNotably, VDR seems essential for mitochondrial bio-energetic function through\nthe regulation of key mitochondrial gene sets. The role of single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDR gene has been largely investigated but yet\nmakes definitive conclusions difficult due to variable methodologies and\ndifferent demographics among study populations [54]. Additionally, no evidence\nexists proposing a molecular basis for the differences seen between those who\ncarry VDR SNPs and those who do not; clarification of the mechanisms\nunderlying the functional consequences of these SNPs would provide further\ninformation into the role of the vitamin D/VDR axis and the extent to which\nits genetic component contributes to our physiology [55].\n\nConsidering the wide range of functions that VitD exerts on many cellular\nsystems, it would not be surprising to find an impact on the hallmark of\naging. However, the literature about the potential role of VitD on hallmarks\nof aging is scarce, limited to a few clinical studies and mainly preclinical\nmodels, probably due to the complexity of pathways involved in the aging\nprocess. Nevertheless, the fact that VitD exerts genomic actions has been\nknown for a few years now. VitD acts through binding to VDR, after which\nheterodimers with retinoid receptors are created, and interacts with VitD\nresponse elements (VDREs), enhancer elements in DNA. Indeed, classic VDR\nbelongs to the nuclear receptors and directly affects gene expression. It\ncould induce gene transcription and also suppress gene expression, depending\non the VDR interactions [56]. In addition, 1,25-dihydroxyVitD may also act\nthrough a receptor in the cytoplasmic membrane associated with a special type\nof lipid rafts called caveolas. Through the VDR in the cytoplasmic membrane,\n1,25-dihydroxyVitD can activate signaling pathways and elicit a rapid cellular\nresponse [57]. The wide gene targeted by VitD and VDRs justifies the\npleiotropic functions of VDRs. Table 1 summarizes the main human studies\ninvestigating the effects of VitD supplementation on the main hallmarks of\naging. A detailed description of the studies is reported and discussed in the\nfollowing sections.\n\n#### 4.1. Vitamin D and Genomic Instability\n\nAssociations between VitD and markers of DNA integrity and stability have been\nmainly presented in studies conducted in human cultured cells and\nobservational studies conducted in patients with comorbid diseases, such as\nType 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), obesity, infertility, cancer patients, and\nthe general population [2,58,59]. Oncogenic-induced senescence has been the\ndrive to demonstrate VitD and VDR genomic functions. Without going deeply\nthrough oncogenic pathways, oncogene-induced senescence is the consequence of\nthe expression of oncogenic RAS, as a tumor suppressor mechanism. In more\ndetail, the expression of RAS leads to the down-regulation of VDR, which in\nturn determines a reduction in BRCA1 and 53BP1, which are the main actors\ninvolved in genome stability. The levels of those factors appear to improve\nwith VitD supplementation [60]. In a placebo-controlled trial involving 92\npatients with a history of colorectal adenoma, there was no clear evidence of\na reduction in 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, a marker of DNA damage in normal\ncolorectal epithelial crypt cells. The daily administration of 800 IU VitD3\nalone for six months led to a significant increase in Bax expression, an\napoptosis promoter, without changes in Bcl-2 expression, an apoptosis\ninhibitor [61]. However, a randomized control trial conducted in 92 people\nwith VitD insufficiency (<30 ng/mL) showed that VitD supplementation (2000 IU\ndaily for 3 months) decreased the percentage of DNA damage and oxidative\nparameters when compared to the control group, either with or without diabetes\n[62].\n\nA potential role of VitD in modulating genomic instability has been assessed\nin T2DM. Indeed, poor glucometabolic control might affect genomic stability;\nat the same time, VitD plays a role in sustaining DNA damage repair. In their\nstudy, Fagundes et al. aimed to evaluate the effect of VitD in improving\nglucose and lipid metabolism as well as the modulation of the genomic\ninstability derived from T2DM. The Damage Index obtained from a comet essay\nwas reduced during VitD supplementation therapy, together with an anti-\nmutagenic action. VitD supplementation led to a significant decrease in nitric\noxide (NO) and total thiols and an increase in the concentration of reduced\nglutathione (GSH), leading to a decrease in oxidative processes in cells. Even\nthough this result might be debated, it is important that the antioxidant\nfunction of VitD may be a protective mechanism against DNA damage [63].\n\n#### 4.2. Vitamin D and Telomere Attrition\n\nSeveral human studies have aimed to elucidate the relationship between VitD\nand telomere biology. A positive correlation between serum 25(OH)D levels and\ntelomere length was found in peripheral blood leukocytes among women in the\ntwins UK cohort. Even after adjusting for various factors, the difference in\ntelomere length between the highest and the lowest 25(OH)D tertiles equated to\na 5-year difference in telomeric aging [64]. The Nurses\u2019 Health Study,\nconducted on 1424 women, confirmed a positive correlation between telomere\nlength and serum 25(OH)D concentrations. However, no significant association\nwas found with 1,25(OH)2D3 levels. Genetic factors related to VitD metabolism\ndid not significantly affect telomere length [65]. However, the association\nbetween 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH)2D3 levels and peripheral blood leukocyte telomere\nlength was not confirmed in 2483 men [66] and 5096 young adults from the\nNorthen Finland Birth Cohort 1966 [67]. Nevertheless, the study identified an\ninverse association between body mass index (BMI) and telomere length, even\nafter adjusting for various factors, including 25(OH)D levels [67].\n\nA more recent analysis conducted in older adults (\u226585 years old) examined the\nassociation between 25(OH)D concentration and telomere length in peripheral\nblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) over time. They found a significant positive\nassociation at baseline but inconsistent relationships at subsequent time\npoints [68]. Focusing on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and\nhealthy controls with VitD deficiency, again a significant correlation\nappeared between telomere length and serum 25(OH)D concentrations [69].\nUltimately, active VitD treatment was associated with a greater telomere\nlength in PBMCs in a small sample of hemodialysis patients, supporting its\npotential protective role [70]. The effect of an intervention based on the\ncombination of regular-strength exercise and supplements that included\nbranched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), calcium, and VitD was tested on the\ntelomere length and the expression of telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA).\nSuch an intervention significantly increased TERRA but did not alter telomere\nshortening [71]. TERRA is central to the modulation of telomere length. In\ncells with longer telomeres, TERRA competes with the telomerase\u2019s DNA\nsubstrate or it enhances the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of the\nenzyme to inhibit the elongation of telomeric repeats [72]. On the contrary,\nin cells with shorter telomeres, TERRA promotes telomere lengthening by\nfacilitating the recruitment of telomerase. It is possible that the findings\nreflect a lag in the increase in telomere size. The cross-sectional design of\nthis study limits any causal associations between TERRA and telomere length,\nwhich need to be explored using a prospective study design. By using summary-\nlevel data from the largest genome-wide association studies, a Mendelian\nrandomized study investigated the causal relationship between serum VitD (n =\n73,699) and telomere length (n = 37,684). The findings did not support any\ncausal effect of VitD on telomeric length [73].\n\nObesity is a condition characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation with\nincreased oxidative stress status, which in turn negatively impacts telomerase\nwellness. It has already been demonstrated that obesity accelerates aging and\nis associated with shorter telomeres. Telomerase activity maintains telomere\nlengths and prevents T cell senescence, preserving long-term immune function.\nOn this basis, Zhu et al. recently evaluated whether VitD supplementation\nmight increase telomerase activity in a population of overweight African\nAmerican subjects compared to the control group. Telomerase activity was\nmeasured using the Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP). At\nbaseline, PBMC telomerase activity did not differ between the two groups, but\nVitD supplementation significantly increased telomerase activity, persisting\nafter an adjustment for sex, BMI, and age, supporting the idea of a beneficial\neffect of VitD on telomer wellness [74]. However, telomere length was not\nmeasured in this study [74].\n\n#### 4.3. Vitamin D and Epigenetic Alterations\n\nOn a different note, the concept of epigenetic alterations leading to\naccelerated aging has been developed in recent years and has been associated\nwith several diseases, such as obesity, Werner syndrome, Huntington\u2019s disease,\nand Down syndrome. The cumulative effects of epigenetic alterations are\nmeasured as the DNAm (DNA metilation) and seem to be highly correlated with\nthe individual\u2019s chronological age [75]. The possible role of VitD in\nmodulating epigenetic regulation has been hypothesized, considering the\nassociation between global DNA hypometilation, leucocyte DNA metilation\nchanges, and increased global metilation levels after VitD administration\n[76,77]. In a recent study conducted to evaluate the effect of VitD on\nepigenetic aging in a cohort of young, obese African women, DNAm age was\ncorrelated with chronological age in patients with low VitD levels, while the\nsupplementation decreased DNA metilation and slowed epigenetic aging [75].\nPregnancy has been another condition of interest for the study of epigenetics\nand DNA methylation. As part of the Southampton Women\u2019s Survey (SWS)\nmother\u2013offspring study, it has been demonstrated that methylation at the\nretinoid-X-receptor-alpha (RXRA) locus in the umbilical cord was associated\nwith the offspring bone mass. The relevance of this discovery is due to the\nfact that RXRA is part of VitD intracellular signaling, and greater VitD\nlevels were associated with a lower RXRA methylation burden [78]. From the\ncohort of the Maternal VitD Osteoporosis Study (MAVIDOS), Curtis et al.\nmeasured the DNAm at a specific site in the RXRA locus (10 CpG) and found that\nin the cohort of mothers receiving cholecalciferol, the methylation levels in\nthe RXRA-specific site were significantly lower compared to the placebo group\n[79].\n\nAnderson et al. implemented an epigenome-wide approach to identify\ndifferentially methylated loci among infants born to mothers supplemented with\n400 IU (i.e., control) versus 3800 IU (i.e., intervention) daily of VitD.\nAmong mothers, supplementation with 3800 IU of VitD per day was associated\nwith mean 25(OH)D levels reflective of a sufficient maternal VitD status by\nbirth among the intervention group, as well as significant gains in maternal\nleukocyte DNA methylation associated with genes involved in cell\nmigration/motility, development, and growth. The implications of methylation\ngain for gene expression and pathway activity could be related to blood vessel\ndevelopment, which is central to the biological processes associated with the\ndemands for a hypertrophic maternal circulatory system. The continued\ndevelopment of the circulatory needs of the placenta and maternal VitD status\nhave been shown to affect placental vascular endothelial growth factor gene\nexpression. Among infants, those born to mothers in the intervention group\nshowed methylation gain at loci with biological implications for the\ndevelopmental processes, including bone, lung, metabolic, and nervous systems.\nAmong infants of mothers in the intervention group, methylation loss was\nassociated with genes known to play a role in metabolic processes and signal\ntransduction pathways, a finding also noted in examining the leukocytes of\ntheir mothers [80].\n\n#### 4.4. Vitamin D and Lack of Proteostasis\n\nHow VitD participates in maintaining proteostasis has been studied in the\npreclinical model of C. Elegans, in which DAF-16, HSF-1, and SKN-1 are\nassociated with the premature accumulation of insoluble proteins and\nalterations of protein homeostasis. In their study, Mark et al. found that\nVitD feeding was able to suppress the toxicity of amyloid-beta and slow\nprotein insolubility, reducing protein toxicity in favor of longevity [26].\nPreclinical studies have shown a role of VitD in muscle proteostasis, with a\nfine regulation in place between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and catabolism\n(muscle protein breakdown: MPB). The ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (UPP) is\none of the proteolytic systems where VitD plays a recognized role. In fact,\nthe deficiency of VitD in rats leads to increased MPB and increased expression\nof ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and ubiquitin conjugates, with no increase in\nlysosomal enzymes; as a result, VitD deficiency seems to contribute to\nincreased non-lysosomal proteolysis [81]. Moreover, the lack of VitD signaling\nleads to muscle atrophy of type II fibers [82], sustaining the critical role\nof VDR in muscle metabolic flexibility and pancreatic insulin response. Recent\nstudies have suggested that VDR-deficient mice are predisposed to utilize\nfatty acids as the primary energy source and accordingly exhibit an increase\nin the oxidative type I and type IIa fibers and atrophy affecting both of\nthese muscle fiber types [83]. On the other hand, VitD has a role in the\nphosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,\ninfluencing cellular signaling involved in myogenesis [81]. Adenosine\nmonophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) represents another proteostasis\nregulator that is linked to VitD levels. Indeed, AMPK is activated during\nmetabolic stress, acting as a nutrient sensor and positively regulating the\ncellular response to stressors. It is known that AMPK expression declines with\nage, but in vitro studies suggest that its activity seems to increase after\ntreatment with 1,25(OH)2D3. Moreover, VitD-deficient rats had reduced\nactivation of sirtuin-1, whose activity was derived from AMPK activation [55].\nSo far, evidence in this regard comes from preclinical models, but considering\nthe widely recognized role of VitD supplementation for muscle health, some\nanalogue mechanisms in humans could be hypothesized.\n\n#### 4.5. Vitamin D and Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nProtein homeostasis and cellular respiration should not be considered\nseparately. The finding of novel mitochondrial localization of VDR has shed\nlight on the impact of VitD on mitochondrial function. Indeed, after binding\nVRD, VitD seems able, in preclinical models, to reduce mitochondrial\nrespiration, consequently preventing the excess of ROS [84]. In aged mice, the\nexpression of the protein Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2013related factor 2, a\nregulator of cellular defense from oxidants), which is known to improve\nmitochondrial function, is reduced, but increases after treatment with\ncalcitriol, further confirming the role of VitD in mitochondrial homeostasis\n[85]. The regulation of mitochondrial function has been seen as helpful in\nreversing age-related hypertension in young male mice [85]. Again, due to the\nknown role of mitochondria in neurodegeneration and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in\nparticular, Mohanad et al. found that VitD was able to improve the oxidative\nstress and mitochondrial function in a preclinical model of induced AD,\nthrough calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2)-mediated\nphosphorylation of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) [86].\n\nOne of the districts that highly depends on adequate energy production and\ncellular respiration is the muscular one. In chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease (COPD), besides the pulmonary impairment, several extra pulmonary\ndistricts are involved. In particular, type I muscle fibers suffer from\nreduced airflow and oxygenation, and the muscular structure switches from slow\nto a fast-glycolytic metabolism. Thus, increased fatigue and reduced endurance\nlower extremity strength with consequent impaired mobility, and finally,\nsarcopenia or cachexia represent possible consequences [87]. VitD deficiency\nhas been demonstrated to be linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP\ndepletion, increased production of ROS, with the known damage that oxidative\nstress causes to muscular tissue, and VitD supplementation, which has a\npositive impact on improving lung function, inspiratory muscle strength, and\noxygen uptake. Ca^2+ homeostasis is a key player in muscle health; moreover,\nCa^2+ represents, together with ROS, secondary messages in cellular signaling.\nVitD is the main regulator of Ca metabolism, and its deficiency may impair\ncalcium uptake in mitochondria, compromising adequate homeostasis. Again, VitD\nplays a role in protein synthesis degradation and peroxidation, actively\nimpacting the ATP-ubiquitin-dependent system and nitrosative stress [87].\nSeveral other examples of evidence support the VitD beneficial effect on the\nattenuation of mitochondrial oxidative stress. In rats, VitD attenuated the\noxidative stress neurotoxicity induced by cyanide. In rats\u2019 cardiovascular\nsystems, VitD was proven efficient in reversing the oxidative cardiac injury\ninduced by isoproterenol, reducing H_2O_2 levels, and increasing anti-oxidant\nmechanisms. Moreover, VitD modulates the expression of monoamine oxidase,\nknown to be a mitochondrial pro-oxidative enzyme, and restores vascular\nfunction [88]. The VitD beneficial function is exerted through VDRs\nactivation; in mouse hearts, VDR\u2019s activation was able to reduce tissue\nischemia/reperfusion stress, and its overexpression ameliorated the myocardial\ninfarct size and increased cardiac function.\n\nImprovement in mitochondrial stress with VitD has also been seen in the\ncentral nervous system; in fact, pre-treatment with calcitriol showed\nattenuation of oxidative stress and ROS production in conditions of mild\nhyperomocysteinemia. The same protective effect was demonstrated in the heart\ntissue when exposed to the same condition. Interestingly, VitD combined with\nlipoic acid reduced mitochondrial stress in astrocytes and neurons, both\nactivated by H_2O_2 and streptozotocin [88]. With aging, the accumulation of\nAGE leads to several alterations in the cardiovascular system, such as\nstiffness, atherosclerosis, plaque formation, and endothelial dysfunction. In\ncardiomyocyte cells treated with AGE, mitochondrial dysfunction was associated\nwith contractile impairment. Treatment with VitD reduced AGE accumulation in\nrats, therefore suggesting a further potential protective role [89].\nMitochondrial dysfunction, and consequently, altered placental metabolism and\nincreased ROS production, is a feature widely recognized in obese pregnant\nwomen; similarly, obese women seem to be more frequently VitD-deficient.\nPhillips et al. evaluated whether trophoblast cells treated with VitD could\nshow an improvement in mitochondrial respiration: in vitro treatment with\ncalcitriol showed an increased expression of VDR, both in obese and non-obese\nwomen, while no significant difference was found in oxygen respiration after\ntreatment in non-obese women, and some improvement was seen in obese ones\n[90]. Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) represents a chronic invalidating disease, and\nintestinal fibrosis is a common complication. Epithelial cells switch to\nmesenchymal cells through a process called epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition\n(EMT). Aside from the knowledge that patients with CD have reduced VitD levels\nand that VDD could lead to intestinal fibrosis, Yu et al. investigated whether\nVDR might have a role in modulating intestinal fibrosis through mitochondrial\nregulation. In VDR-knockout mice, epithelial mitochondria showed altered\nmorphology, accumulation of ECM in the interstices, and reduced functional\ngenes, suggesting a potentially protective role of VDR activation against\nintestinal fibrosis [91]. Finally, sarcopenia represents a widely recognized\nclinical syndrome, characterized by impaired physical performance and related\nto poor outcomes. The role of VitD in sarcopenia has been evaluated since\nhypoVitD is linked to muscle weakness, reduced strength and mass, fatigue, and\nreduced mitochondrial activity. However, the results from intervention studies\nevaluating the role of VitD are conflicting and inconclusive, recommending\nfurther studies to better understand and define the possible role of VitD\nsupplementation in sarcopenic patients [92].\n\n#### 4.6. Vitamin D and Cellular Senescence\n\nThere are several insults that might activate the cellular senescence process.\nWhen the cell reduces proliferative capacity, it remains in the Eg1-g2 PHASE,\nand then interrupts divisions and changes morphology. The hallmark of\nsenescence is the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).\nProinflammatory cytokines released by the secretome may increase and trigger\nsecondary senescence in the surrounding environment. Again, VitD\nsupplementation seems to be related to decreased cellular senescence and SASP\n[93]. Part of the aging process is related to the aging of the immune system\ndue to thymic involution and function and the increased number of T immature T\nlymphocytes, with the immune phenotype changing towards a lower CD4/CD8 ratio\nand a decreasing amount of T CD8+CD28+ cells. The inevitable process of\nimmunosenescence exposes older people to recurrent infections and cancers;\nmoreover, chronic disease and low-grade inflammation represent a further step\ndown in immune system efficiency [94].\n\nA recent trial aimed to test the possible effect of a nutraceutical supplement\n(comprehensive of Sambucus nigra, zinc, tyndallized Lactobacillus acidophilus\n(HA122), arabinogalactans, VitD, vitamin E, vitamin C, and group B vitamins)\non some specific signatures of immunosenescence in hospitalized older adults.\nThese supplements determined a reduction in inflammatory mediators such as\nIL-6, CRP, and lymphocyte number, and they were also associated with perceived\nbetter wellness [55,95]. Considering the effect of VitD on the immune system,\nmainly exerted through the inhibition of monocyte and cytokine overproduction\nand direct action on T lymphocytes, Rizka et al. evaluated the potential\neffect of alphacalcidol supplementation in an inflammatory profile (Il-6,\nIL-10, TNF, CD4/CD8 ratio, CD8+, and CD28-) in 110 older fit or frail\nsubjects. The population was randomized to alphacalcidol or placebo and\nadministered orally for ninety days. The cohort receiving alphacalcidiol had a\nbetter immune profile across the whole cohort as well as the cohort divided\naccording to frailty status [96]. These results support the immunomodulatory\nfunction of VitD and highlight the importance of maintaining sufficient levels\nof VitD, which seem crucial in immunosenescence and chronic conditions\ncharacterized by low-grade chronic inflammation. In addition, calcium and\ncalcium signaling have been established as critical factors in the\nimplementation and regulation of cellular senescence. Increased intracellular\ncalcium accumulation occurs in different cell types and in response to many\ndifferent senescence-inducing stimuli. In senescent cells, intracellular\ncalcium concentration increases in the cytosol and mitochondria, coming from\nthe extracellular space through plasma membrane channels, the release by the\nendoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Calcium fluxes between\ndifferent subcellular compartments, calcium channels, calcium-binding\nproteins, calcium-regulated enzymes, and transcription factors also play\npivotal roles in promoting senescence. However, a thorough assessment of the\nfunctional contribution and regulation of each of the factors involved in\ncalcium signaling is still needed to fully understand it [97].\n\n#### 4.7. Vitamin D and Stem Cell Exhaustion\n\nThe influence of VitD on stem cells (SCs) mainly refers to in vitro studies\nconducted on fetal or adult osteoblasts. The administration of VitD per se or\nloaded onto nanoparticles and other nanostructures is associated with great\npotential in bone regeneration and improved stem cells\u2019 differentiation into\nosteoblasts [98].\n\nVDR signaling also plays a vital role in the modulation of neuronal SCs, which\nexhibit a prominent role in developing the entire nervous system during the\nembryonic stage; even in adult brains, neuronal SCs are located in restricted\nregions and support the replacement of damaged neurons [99]. VDR-mediated\ncellular signaling cascades are involved in enhancing neuronal SCs through\nWnt/\u03b2-catenin and Sonic Hedgehog pathways. Based on the canonical signaling of\nWnt in activating neurogenesis in the brain and maintaining balance between\nactivated neural stem cells (aNSC)/qNSC avoiding depletion, it is crucial to\nmaintain persistent VDR activity. Therefore, deficiency in VitD could cause an\nimbalance in Wnt signaling and inhibit the gradual neural SC stimulation\nrequired to maintain a neurogenic rate [100]. However, more research is needed\nin this field to identify potential VDR agonists targeting neuronal SCs. More\nrecently, preclinical studies identified a potential role of VitD on SCs from\npatients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These patients usually display\ninsufficient or deficient VitD levels, which are significantly associated with\npoorer overall survival, both at diagnosis and before allogeneic stem cell\ntransplantation. There is seminal evidence from animal studies that VDR\nagonists may impair leukemic stem cell activity, while the lack of VDR results\nin increased numbers of hematopoietic and leukemia stem cells and quiescent\nhematopoietic stem cells, suggesting a function of VitD as regulators of stem\ncell homeostasis [101,102]. However, therapeutic interventions with VitD\nanalogues have resulted in inconclusive data in humans due to adverse events\nrelated to systemic hypercalcemia [103]. Possibly more promising results could\nbe derived from recent pilot studies evaluating the effects of adding VitD to\nthe adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cell (ASC) infusion in patients with\nType 1 Diabetes [104].\n\n#### 4.8. Vitamin D and Altered Intercellular Communication\n\nVery scarce literature is available regarding the possible role of VitD in\nintercellular communication, and it is mainly focused on bone cells. It is\nalready known that fibroblasts and other osteoblast-lineage cells lead to the\nformation of osteoclasts. However, it is not clear whether intercellular\ninteractions have an impact on the expression of genes implied in\nosteoclastogenesis. In their study, Bloemen et al. evaluated the effect of the\ncell\u2013cell interaction on the micro-RNA (mRNA) expression of the molecules\ninvolved in osteoclast formation in cell cultures. Moreover, they evaluated\nthe formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-positive cells as\nwell as their ability to resorb bone. Interestingly, their data showed that\nosteoclastogenesis-related genes were up-regulated in co-cultures compared to\nmono-cultures and were overpowered by both VitD and dexamethasone [105].\nIntercellular communication is also a contributing factor for receptor\nexpression on osteoblast-like cells, which is fundamental for hormone and\nneurotransmitter binding and signaling. Several years ago, Schirrmacher\nanalyzed the electric coupling in a gap junction of rat osteoblast-like cells\nafter stimulation with VitD, 17\u03b2-estradiol (17\u03b2-E2), the neurotransmitter\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the excitatory amino acid glutamate\n(Glu). They found that the electric coupling response was cell-pair-specific\nwhen exposed to the above-mentioned hormones. Specifically, VitD increased the\ncoupling in some cell pairs but not in others [106]. Considering the\npleiotropic actions of VitD at cellular levels, it could possibly have an\ninfluence on intercellular communication as well, and more studies are\nwarranted to better address this topic.\n\n#### 4.9. Vitamin D and Chronic Inflammation\n\nVitD influences the innate and adaptative immune responses given to the wide\ndistribution of VDR among immune cells and their intrinsic ability to convert\nVitD metabolic precursors into the active form, and then allows for an\nautonomic regulation of the active VitD concentration in an inflamed site\n[107]. Although several preclinical and epidemiological studies confirmed the\ninverse relationship between VitD and chronic inflammation, intervention\nstudies addressing the impact of VitD supplementation on low-grade\ninflammation are not consistent. Indeed, VitD supplementation reduces the\nhigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in patients with diabetes [108],\npsychiatric disorders [109], polycystic ovary syndrome [110], and advanced\nkidney disease [111], and reduces the tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in\npatients with diabetes [112]. However, a systematic review of meta-analyses\nand randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that VitD3 supplementation at a\nrange of doses had no significant effect on the biomarkers of systemic\ninflammation and hypothesized that a low VitD status is a consequence of ill\nhealth rather than its cause [113]. The VITAL study aimed at the primary\nprevention of cancer and CVDs and was conducted among 25,871 women \u2265 55 and\nmen \u2265 50 years of age, with a mean treatment period of 5.3 years. It confirmed\nthat VitD supplementation (2000 IU/daily), with or without n-3 FAs, decreased\nhs-CRP by 19% at year 2, although the reduction was attenuated at 4 years.\nOther inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1) were not significantly\naltered at year 2 or year 4, while n-3 FAs, with or without VitD3, did not\nsignificantly affect these biomarkers at either time point. Therefore, the\nauthors partially confirmed a potential role of VitD supplementation in\nmodulating the chronic inflammatory process, systemic inflammation, and\npossibly autoimmune disease progression [114].\n\n#### 4.10. Vitamin D and Dysbiosis\n\nDysbiosis and gut microbiota dysfunction may result from the interplay of\nseveral factors, and chronic inflammation represents a possible drive for\nthem. HIV-1 infection is an example of a chronic disease where VitD seems to\ncounteract dysbiosis. Indeed, patients with HIV-1 infection are characterized\nby persistent immune activation led by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and microbial\nproducts migrating through a defective gut mucosal barrier. They often present\nwith hypovitaminosis D, and, as a consequence, a concomitant dysregulation of\nthe gut microbiota has been described. The immunomodulatory function of VitD\nseems to be exerted through the induction of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37,\nwhich is protective via the activation of autophagy, the inhibition of HIV-1\ntranscription, and pathogen killing [115]. Moreover, preclinical and clinical\nstudies demonstrated a potential role of VitD in stabilizing the epithelial\ntight junction, as well as regulating the intestinal microbiota composition,\nreducing pro-inflammatory intestinal probacteria. Based on these premises,\nMissalidis et al. evaluated whether VitD or phenylbutyrate (PBA) may have\nmodulatory action on microbiota composition, metabolite production, and immune\nactivation. As a result, VitD and PBA supplements increase VitD levels,\nwithout having a significant improvement in the circulating antimicrobial\npeptide LL-37 and an actual impact on microbiota [115]. Another chronic\ninflammatory condition linked to gut microbiome dysbiosis is osteoarthritis\n(OA). Considering that microbiota dysfunction may lead to chronic low-grade\nsystemic inflammation through LPS, and that LPS is increased in OA patients\nwith low-grade inflammation, Ramasamy et al. conducted a pilot study\nevaluating the interplay between microbiome, knee OA (KOA), and VitD levels,\nwith the ultimate object of establishing whether VitD deficiency is associated\nwith microbiome dysfunction. In the cohort, specific bacteria were identified\nin VDD subjects compared to normal controls, and KOA_VDD patients showed\nspecific bacteria species that were not identified in KOA without VDD,\nsuggesting a possible influence of VitD on gut microbiome, depending on the\nKOA status, and a microbiome influence of the KOA condition in VDD subjects.\nHowever, in the KOA_VDD group, the core bacteria from KOA or VDD were not\nidentified, suggesting a possible interplay of both conditions in microbiota\ndysbiosis [116]. Keeping in line with the potential role of VitD\nsupplementation on microbiota composition in patients with different chronic\nconditions, Kanhere M et al. demonstrated a different gut microbiota\ncomposition in patients with VDD and cystic fibrosis compared to patients with\nnormal VD levels; more specifically, potentially pathogenic species were\nidentified in the microbiome of VDD subjects. Moreover, favorable changes in\nbacteria species were seen in the VDD group after supplementation compared to\nthe placebo group [117]. The effect of VitD supplementation on gut microbiota\nin healthy individuals has also been studied. In their RCT, Singh et al.\nshowed a significant increment of health-promoting gut probiotics after VitD\nsupplementation [118]. This finding supports the potentially beneficial role\nof VitD supplementation in microbiota health. Considering how much VitD is\nrelated to several chronic inflammatory diseases and how negatively low-grade\nchronic inflammation impacts general health, adequate VitD storage should be a\npriority.\n\nTable 1.

Discussion and Future Perspectives\n\nAging is a complex and multifactorial process, marked by the progressive\ndecline in organ functions, leading to frailty and increased susceptibility to\nage-related diseases. Although years of research have supported the importance\nof each hallmark in the process of aging, a significant amount of recent\nevidence indicates that the hallmarks are not acting in isolation but rather\nhave complex, interconnected interactions. Hallmarks of aging are a set of\ninterconnected biological mechanisms that, individually or synergistically,\ncontribute to molecular and cellular damage, potentially initiating and\naccelerating the onset of age-related diseases. The interconnection among\nhallmarks of aging highlights the need to consider aging holistically and\ninvestigate biological and phenotypical changes integrally, ultimately\ndisentangling the potential agonistic, antagonistic, and modulator factors\nleading to organ disease. Currently, we are not certain what impact hallmark\ninteractions have on normal or pathological aging or if there are possible\nhierarchies among the hallmarks. In addition, whether there is a threshold\nbeyond which such interactions could overwhelm compensatory mechanisms needs\nto be investigated [15]. Given the epidemiological scenarios and the available\nscientific and technological achievements, it seems pivotal to move and\nintegrate the routes of research from the biological to the clinical layers in\nthe continuum of dynamism from integrity to damage, from vitality to frailty,\nwith the ultimate goal of expanding a valuable lifespan. In this perspective,\nit appears a priority to explore the efficacy of available multi-target\ninterventions with potential for modulating the hallmarks of aging, then\nverifying the impact on the overall body\u2019s homeostasis and functioning.\nIndeed, the hallmarks of aging could represent a milestone to be addressed and\nunderstood in healthy aging studies and interventions, hopefully driving the\ntransition from preclinical contexts to clinical settings.\n\nIn light of promoting active longevity, strong evidence supports the\ndeleterious effects of hypoVitD on musculoskeletal health, particularly in\ncausing falls, fragility fractures, and mobility issues. Beyond its\nmusculoskeletal effects, VitD may exert several potential extra-skeletal\nactions, modulating several biomolecular mechanisms and pathways that have\nbeen identified as VDR-related in a wide range of cellular types and at\nmultiple cellular layers. Among the biomolecular mechanisms, the hallmarks of\naging are pivotal to disentangle the modulatory or causal effects of VitD on\nthe onset and progression of aging and age-related diseases. VitD appears to\nregulate and influence several hallmarks of aging through genomic and non-\ngenomic pathways, influencing their expression directly or indirectly by\nactivating epigenetic changes or just influencing the cellular environmental\nmilieu. Based on the available clinical studies, we can conclude that ViD may\ncontribute to genomic stability, but it does not seem to have an impact on\ntelomere length, although some findings support a protective role of VitD on\ntelomerase activity in obese individuals. Encouraging evidence supports the\nepigenetic effects of VitD, which may be able to control and attenuate DNA\ndamage in adults, infants, and their mothers. Then, some evidence supports the\nprotective role of VitD in modulating senescence and related-SASP, but proves\nconcerning the capacity of VitD to lower chronic inflammation in the long term\nare still waiting to come, as well as those showing better intercellular\ncommunication. Calcium is also recognized as a potential regulator of\nsenescence in vivo and plays a key role in several processes in which\nsenescence is involved, such as wound healing, cell migration, and invasion,\nas well as insulin sensitivity [119], suggesting that calcium and senescence\nmay be functionally linked in many contexts [120]. To date, there is no\nevidence for an impact of VitD on attenuating SC exhaustion, but it looks\npromising that VitD modulates the vitality and efficacy of SC infusion.\nHowever, caution is needed in interpreting these findings, considering the\nnovelty and the debate about this approach. Notably, clinical studies support\nthe potential of VitD supplementation in hampering dysbiosys, prompting the\nrecovery of gut microbiota health, and providing multiple health benefits.\n\nDespite the interest in VitD supplementation as a strategy supporting human\nlongevity and some evidence about its potential in modulating hallmarks of\naging, we are still far from the point of translation from bench to bed. With\nsome exceptions, the majority of human studies investigated the impact of VitD\nsupplementation on the single hallmark of aging by using disease models or\npeculiar subgroups of the population, focusing mainly on inflammatory-related\nchanges without exploring the correlations with other hallmarks or functional\nor biological markers of aging. Therefore, current knowledge does not allow\nyet to define a potential optimal VitD dosage for modulating hallmarks of\naging or the chronological or functional age at which VitD supplementation\nmight be useful in modulating aging biologically related factors. However,\naging is a progressive process that starts soon after achieving the structural\nand functional body\u2019s maturation. It mainly consists of adaptative changes\nthat lead over time to the accumulation of deficits and insults. Then, we\ncould speculate that early interventions to avoid VitD insufficiency might be\nprotective in the long run, but longitudinal studies based on homogenous\ncohorts and targeted therapy are warranted.\n\nIndeed, there are few intervention studies conducted in humans that confirm\npotential pathways already explored in preclinical models. Human studies\ncarried out so far are mainly transverse, and those few longitudinal studies\nwere too small, limited by a short follow-up time, or focused on a single\nbiomolecular mechanism, unable to obtain clarifying results or provide a wide\nperspective on the overall cellular and pathophysiological changes. Moreover,\nmany literature discrepancies exist and may be justified by the use of\ndifferent VitD supplements, different dosages, heterogeneous VitD baseline\nlevels, often even unknown, different measurement techniques for hallmarks,\nand, ultimately, different target populations and aims.\n\nFrom a clinical standpoint, it is a relevant approach to preventing VitD\ndeficiency at any age since it is associated with osteomalacia and ensuring a\nsufficient level of VitD in the general population. It is strongly recommended\nthat seniors with a fall history or those living in long-term care\ninstitutions maintain or regain optimal VitD levels by means of\nsupplementation (at least 800\u20131000 IU daily). However, optimal VitD levels are\nrecommended in adults or older adults at high risk for fragility fractures.\nSupplementation with VitD is a first-line intervention in the secondary\nprevention of falls and fragility fractures, and, in these cases, it is\nadvisable to measure the patient\u2019s serum VitD concentrations after two-to-\nthree months of ViD supplementation. Indeed, there is no direct evidence\nsupporting a clear advantage in performing a basal assessment of VitD at the\nlevels reached with supplementation. On the contrary, the failure or\ninadequate supplementation with vitamin D in patients on antiresorptive or\nanabolic treatment for osteoporosis is thought to further amplify the problem\nand expose patients to a high risk of re-fracture and mortality [121].\n\nIn summary, a growing body of research has explored the relationship between\nVitD and some hallmarks of aging, with varying results depending on study\nsubgroups and design. Despite encouraging routes for potential interventions\nbased on VitD, further investigations are required to elucidate the effects\nfrom an integrated perspective and set the pillars for the potential clinical\nimplications of these findings.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis research received no external funding.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
