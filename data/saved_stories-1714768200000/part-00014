I no longer\n> build software; I now make furniture out of wood. The hours are long, the\n> pay sucks, and there\u2019s always the opportunity to remove my finger with a\n> table saw, but nobody asks me if I can add an RSS feed to a DBMS, so there\u2019s\n> that :-)\n\nI say legendary because it has over 9000 reactions and most are positive.\nThere\u2019s a reason why so many devs resonate with that comment.\n\nA lot of us said at some point things like \u201cI\u2019m gonna throw my laptop out the\nwindow and start a farm\u201d. Even my last team leader sent me a message out of\nthe blue saying \u201cI think I\u2019ll run a bar. I want to be a bartender and listen\nto other people\u2019s stories, not figure out why protobuf doesn\u2019t deserialize\ndata that worked JUST FINE for the past three years\u201d.\n\nYou know the drill, sometimes the world of software development feels so\nabsurd that you just want to buy a hundred alpaca and sell some wool socks and\nforget about solving conflicts in package.json for the rest of your life.\n\nI went through those stages too: when the Agile meetings at my last job got so\nabsurd that we were being asked to estimate JIRA task time in T-shirt sizes, I\ntook the decision to quit that comfy well paying job for the uncertainty of\nmaking a living from macOS apps. I had only one app that didn\u2019t even work on\nthe latest Apple Silicon chips, and it was making $0, so I really took a bet\nwith it.\n\nRecently, when people started coming with so many unrealistic and absurd\nexpectations and demands about what my apps should do, I started thinking if\nit would be possible to leave software development for a more physical trade.\n\n## # A bit of history\n\nMost of my pre-college time was spent on things I didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nI had a bit of childhood, but then I started going to school 6 hours per day,\nwith 1-2 hours spent on commute after 5th grade. I only liked the 10-minute\nbreaks between classes where I played basketball or practiced parkour.\n\nEvery day after I came back from school, I had to work in agriculture, either\nout in the field with crazy winds and sun and UV radiation, or inside a\n100-meter long greenhouse where it\u2019s either a 50\u00b0C sauna or a muddy\nrainforest. I was very bad at every job I was given, but it\u2019s what my parents\ndid for a living and I had to help them, no questions asked.\n\nThe few hours that remained, usually very late at night, tired both physically\nand mentally, I spent practicing acoustic guitar, doing bodybuilding\nexercises, writing bad poetry or drawing graphite portraits.\n\nme, ages ago, playing a classical guitar on someone's old couch\n\nI almost never did homework or memorize whatever had to be memorized for the\nnext day of school. I just couldn\u2019t justify spending those few hours I had\nleft on even more stuff I did not want to do.\n\nWhen I found my liberty in college, hundreds of kilometers away from my\nparents, it\u2019s like something clicked. I suddenly became incapable of doing\nwork that I found meaningless.\n\nFailing classes became acceptable, quitting jobs was something I did with\nlittle remorse if I felt I wasn\u2019t helping anyone with the work I was assigned,\nand bureaucracy became a disease I had to avoid at all costs.\n\nI still washed the dishes though. Cleaning and other \u201cchores\u201d never felt\nmeaningless for some reason.\n\n## # The first wood thing I did\n\n... was a chess board and piece set. With magnets inside them. Where the\npieces look nothing like ordinary chess pieces.\n\nchess board, first iteration\n\nI was trying to get the pieces to snap into place in a satisfying way, and\nmake sure the game stays that way when kids or dogs inevitably bump the table\nwhere the board sits.\n\nYou know how Magnus Carlsen always adjusts his pieces so meticulously before a\ngame? Well I have half of that obsession as well so I wanted to avoid doing\nthat.\n\nMagnus Carlsen adjusting his pieces before a gamepawn snapping into its square\nbecause of the magnet inside\n\n### # How it was done\n\nI started with a cheap but hefty pine board which I rounded with a lot of\nsandpaper. Then I asked my wife to help me colour in the darker squares\nbecause I\u2019m pretty bad at colouring inside the edges (both literally and\nfiguratively). We used some wood floor markers for that and the colour seems\nto be holding well.\n\n> Most chess board builds you see on YouTube are done by gluing squares of\n> different wood species with alternating colors, but I had neither the skill\n> nor the tools to do that.\n\nThen I drilled holes for the super strong neodymium magnets from the underside\nof the board, having to get really close to the top side without passing\nthrough. I failed on two squares, but some wood putty took care of that.\n\nsculpting chess pieces with my dremel on the balcony\n\nI spent a few sunny days on the balcony sculpting the pieces with a badly\nsharpened knife and my Dremel. This was quite satisfying, there\u2019s something\nreally nice about seeing a non-descript rectangle take the shape of a little\nhorse in your hands. I mean knight, but in Romanian that piece is called\n\u201chorse\u201d, and I really don\u2019t see any knight there.\n\nchess board, start to finish\n\nRegarding the design, I got some inspiration after seeing these modernist\nchess sets, which not only looked beautiful in my eyes, but also had these\ngeometric shapes that didn\u2019t need that much sculpting to replicate. I found\nready-to-buy spheres and cubes of wood at a craft shop around me (which took\ncare of pawns and rooks), and the rest were carved out of rectangles and cones\nof wood.\n\nModernist chess set designs\n\n## # Kaval\n\nTwo Octobers ago, a Romanian music band called Subcarpa\u021bi was holding a free\n\u201cmake a Kaval with your own hands\u201d course, where a flute artisan taught the\nbasics of his trade for a week.\n\n> The Kaval or \u201ccaval\u201d is a long flute with 5 holes and a distinct lower\n> register where notes can sound melancholic and coming from far away, as\n> opposed to the thin cheerful sound of the small shepherd flute.\n\nKaval sample in G minor\n\nEver since I bought my first Kaval, I always wanted to learn how to build one\nmyself. It\u2019s one of those trades where there\u2019s very little info on the\ninternet, so it feels almost mystical compared to what I\u2019m used to in\nprogramming. I would also have the chance to walk home with the finished\nflute, so of course I went to the course.\n\nMaking my own Kaval, in B minor\n\nI loved the fact that we worked in teams of two, and that everything had to be\ndone by hand with no power tools. Even the long bore through the 70cm branch\nof elder tree had to be done with a hand drill, taking turns to rest our\nhands.\n\nThe artisan had been a shepherd himself since childhood, and taught himself\nwith a lot of trial and error about how to build good sounding flutes and how\nto make the holes so that the flute stays in tune. But he didn\u2019t know why the\nholes should be at those specific distances or why the wood tube should be of\nthat specific length for each scale.\n\nI wanted to know those things, because I had an idea of making a universal\nKaval that can play in any scale.\n\n> You see, if you want to play on top of songs in various scales, you need a\n> Kaval made for each specific scale. So you\u2019ll need an A minor flute, and a B\n> minor one and a C minor one and so on, for a total of 12 different flute\n> lengths.\n\nI eventually found info on how a flute works by thinking about it as an open\nor closed tube where the vibrating air creates nodes and antinodes that should\ncoincide with the hole position. At the moment I\u2019m still studying this and\nworking towards my \u201cuniversal flute\u201d goal.\n\n## # What does this have to do with software?\n\nFor the past 10 years I lived in rented apartments, usually at the 3rd or 4th\nstory with no access to a courtyard. I was never able to get used to that,\ngiven that all my childhood I lived and played in a 2000m2 courtyard, on a\nroad where there were more slow horse carriages than noisy cars.\n\nThis year I moved into a rented house with a tiny but welcoming garden and a\nbit of paved court and only now I notice the effect this has had on my mind\nand behaviour.\n\nI develop macOS apps for a living, and there are some unhealthy things in this\nfield that piled up over the years. I get a lot of messages in a demanding and\nnegative tone, and because walking outside the apartment meant unbearable car\nnoise, obnoxious smells and zero privacy, I always defaulted to simply acting\non the feedback, putting up with it and working long hours into the night,\ninstead of going for a walk to calm down.\n\nA few months ago, the most absurd demands started coming up for my apps:\nthings like \u201cwhy does your app not control the volume of my <weird sound\ndevice>? why don\u2019t you just do it, people pay you for it\u201d when the app in\nquestion is Lunar, an app for controlling monitor brightness, not sound\ndevices.\n\nOr \u201cwhy do you disable your apps from working on Windows?\u201d, or \u201cmake Clop\ncompress text and copy it to clipboard\u201d (where Clop is my app that\nautomatically compresses copied images, videos and PDFs, I have no idea what\ncompressing text even means in that context).\n\nBut this time, I was able to simply walk out the front door, grab a branch of\nbeech wood, and, because I remembered my wife saying we forgot to package the\nfrench rolling pin when moving, I took out my pocket knife and started carving\na simple rolling pin for her. It was so liberating to be able to just ignore\nthose messages for a while and do something with my hands.\n\nthe rolling pin is such a simple tool and to this day, my wife still tells me\nhow much she likes it because it's exactly the right length and thickness for\nmaking her tasty egg noodles.. and best of all, it was free\n\nI understand that those people don\u2019t know better, and they would have no idea\nthat there\u2019s no checkbox where you can choose whether an app works on macOS,\nWindows or Linux. I understand how if the app does something with audio volume\nor compression, some think that it should do everything related to those\nworkloads, even if it\u2019s completely outside the scope of the app.\n\nBut the combination of the negative tone and getting message after message,\nsome people being so persistent that they insist on sending me those messages\nthrough all possible mediums (email, Discord, Twitter, contact form, they\u2019ll\nfind me everywhere), makes it hard to just ignore them.\n\nThere\u2019s also this oily smell of AI and machine learning in the tech\natmosphere, where I no longer feel relevant and I seem to have stopped caring\nabout new tech when I noticed that 8 in 10 articles are about some new LLM or\nimage generation model. I guess I like the smell of wood better.\n\n### # Side tangent on privileges of being a software dev\n\nI know I\u2019m privileged to even be able to have the choice of what to do with my\ntime. I got lucky when I chose a computer science university at the right time\nwhich allowed me to progress towards a huge semi-passive income in the last 10\nyears. that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t work my ass off, but luck plays a huge role\ntoo\n\nI got \u201clucky\u201d to have my mind traumatised into some kind of OCD-like state\nwhere I hate leaving a thing unfinished. So I plow through exhaustion, skip\nmeals, miss house chores and annoy dear people around me because I know \u201cI\njust need to fix this little thing\u201d and I\u2019ll finish this app/feature/task I\nstarted. Even though I also know there\u2019s no real deadline and I can leave it\nhalf-finished for now.\n\nBut even if it sounds annoying for a person like me to whine about how I don\u2019t\nfeel good or I feel burnt out, the privilege doesn\u2019t negate the feelings. The\nregression to the norm will make everyone, rich or poor, get used to the\nstatus quo and complain about every thing that\u2019s just a little worse than\ntheir current state. That\u2019s happiness and sadness in a nutshell.\n\nI\u2019m also vaguely aware that software dev as we know it is about to disappear\nsoon, and I got tired of learning the newest thing just to have it replaced\nnext year. I got tired of back pain and chronic finger pain from so many hours\nof sitting and typing, I\u2019d rather have pain from work that also builds some\nmuscle.\n\nAnd I got so tired of everything being online, immaterial, ephemeral and\nlonely, like indie development tends to be.\n\n## # Woodworking with cheap tools and free wood\n\nThis house we rented is small and the owners had to fit the bedroom upstairs.\nI really don\u2019t like climbing stairs up and down, especially when I have to let\nmy dog out three times per night. So we gave up a room and started furnishing\nour own bedroom downstairs.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to buy bedside tables for the price of the bed itself, so I\nthought I could maybe make by own. I\u2019m not yet skilled enough to build my own\nbed though, so we bought that\n\nOne day, while walking with my dog, I noticed that some trees were getting\ntrimmed in the vicinity of our house and there were a lot of white birch\nbranches on the side of the road. I said why not?, grabbed some branches and\nwalked like a lunatic with white long sticks dangling up and down and a black\ndog zig-zagging left and right, all the way home.\n\nI had another small pine panel left from that chess project so I started\nthinking about the simplest way to turn what I have into a bedside table.\n\npine board with birch branches\n\nI used low-grit sandpaper to give the board some nice round corners because I\nlove squircles, swallowed about a spoonful of sawdust because I couldn\u2019t find\nany breathing mask left, criss-crossed 4 branches in a way that would give a\nstable base, and screwed them to the underside of the board with long wood\nscrews.\n\nThe legs would wobble around though, so I drilled small 3mm holes into each\nbranch where they met in the middle, and weaved a florist wire through them to\nkeep the table steady.\n\nBedside table, made out of pine with birch legs\n\n### # The laptop bed table\n\nAfter I\u2019ve shown the bedside table to a friend of mine, he said he also needed\na laptop table for those mornings when he\u2019d rather not get out of bed. I\nwanted to say that\u2019s not very healthy, but what got out instead was sure\nthing, I\u2019ll do it!. Oh well..\n\nI still had the large desk top I glued from smaller beech boards, on which I\nworked for the past 4 years. It stayed unused currently, so I cut part of it\nand built this cute thing:\n\ncute but heavy laptop table, made out of glued beech wood\n\nYou\u2019ll notice three defining features that every laptop table should have:\n\n  * a hole for a charging cable\n  * a carved coaster for the coffee cup\n  * a mildly surprised face? \ud83d\ude26\n\nTo tell the truth, all those are side effects of me drilling holes where there\nshould be no hole, and dropping the board on the ground multiple times because\nmy workbench was not large enough. All the things that could go wrong, went\nwrong with this table.\n\nI hid the defects by turning them into features.\n\nThe whole truth actually is that the table looks nothing like what I planned.\nI bought these nice hidden brass cylindrical hinges to make the table\nfoldable. That way, you could fold the sides flat inside and use it as some\nkind of armchair desk if you wanted.\n\nBrass hinges\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to drill the correctly sized or positioned holes for the hinges\nbecause I still lack a lot of knowledge and skill in working with wood. So\nafter losing my temper with the frickin\u2019 hinges that still didn\u2019t fit after a\nfull day of drilling and chiseling, I glued the sides and inserted 2 trusty\nlong wood screws per side, which I patched with a glue gun that made the screw\nholes look like eyes.\n\nAfter I also carved the handles, the table grew kind of a personality of its\nown, as you can see above.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I do some wood joints, like a dovetail instead of ugly screws and\nglue?\n\nBecause I had no idea they existed. Also, I wasn\u2019t able to fit a simple hinge,\nI would have probably never finished this table if I tried learning wood\njoinery on it.\n\nThis reminds me of how whenever I did pair programming with a colleague, I\nnoticed how they were doing some \u201cnonoptimal\u201d action and I would say:\n\n> Why don\u2019t you just use ripgrep instead of sifting through all these files?\n\nBecause they don\u2019t know it exists, stupid. Or because they just want to get\nthis thing done and move on, they don\u2019t grep files all day like you do.\n\nBut in my ignorance, I seem to have chosen a good enough joining method. As\nyou can see in this wood joinery comparison, 5cm (2inch) screws can hold more\nthan 50kg (110lbs) of force, and I used even longer screws so I think it\u2019s\ngoing to hold a 3kg laptop just fine.\n\nOh right, forgot about this little detail.. I also added a cork pocket for\nholding a notebook, tablet, phone etc. which I lined with a microfiber cloth\non the inside for strength and sewn to the wood with that leftover alpaca wool\nfor style.\n\nCork pocket sewn to the table side\n\n### # The bookshelf without books\n\nLarge bookshelf (200x120x40 cm), made out of pine boards\n\nWhile we were stuck in the apartment in the 2020 pandemic, me and my wife\nbought a lot of stuff that we thought would help us learn new things and start\nnew hobbies. I thought I\u2019m going to build smart LED lighting all my life and\nmy wife would become a professional wool knitter. We were losing our minds,\nfor sure.\n\nSo now we were stuck with crates of stuff we haven\u2019t used in years, and didn\u2019t\nwant to start unpacking them around the house. The clutter that followed after\nthe pandemic, tired our minds just as much as the lockdown itself.\n\nWe dumped the crates on an unused stairway spot, and I thought that a\nbookshelf as large as that spot would clear the clutter.\n\nBefore: clutter | After: organized clutter\n\nBut I could not find any bookshelf that large, certainly not for cheap. So I\ntraced a few lines in Freeform, took some measurements, and ordered a bunch of\nlarge pine boards and a ton of long screws.\n\nI also ordered the cheapest portable workbench I could find ($30) that had a\nvise, so I can stop making sawdust inside.\n\nA few days later, I got to sawing the shelves with my cheap Japanese pull saw\nI bought from Lidl years ago.\n\n> Hint: Hand sawing a long wood board with no skill will certainly end up with\n> a crooked edge. Stacking up 5 boards one on top of the other will still end\n> up crooked.\n\n> Uhm, I guess the hint is, buy a track saw, or make sure the crooked edge\n> isn\u2019t visible.\n\nmaking the bookshelf\n\nMy wife helped a lot with measuring and figuring out where to drill holes and\nplace the screws, while my dog inspected the work regularly to make sure the\ndefects were hidden correctly.\n\nIt took two days of screwing.. erm.. driving screws, I mean. But in the end we\ngot the result we wanted! And I got sores in my right arm for days, driving\nthose long screws is harder than I thought.\n\n## # The desk that became a workbench\n\nIn the thumbnail of this post you can see the current \u201cworkbench\u201d I use, which\nis basically that $30 vise workbench I bought for the bookshelf, with the top\nof my previous \u201ccoding desk\u201d attached in the front.\n\nmy current workbench\n\nIn the image you can see (bottom-left to top, then right):\n\n  * the cheapest block plane I could find ($8)\n  * a red no-name plane I found in the shed of that 100-year old house that we never finished rebuilding\n  * an axe I found rusted and partly broken in the same shed, on which I learnt how to sharpen and restore axes\n  * a folding japanese pull saw that I take everywhere with me\n  * some grip blocks on which I place boards for sanding\n  * a bottle of Osmo Polyx oil I use for finishing\n  * a set of carving knives from Beavercraft (really good and they were available at a nice discount)\n  * a combination square (tucked somewhere at the top of the bench)\n  * a branch of elder tree, which is prepared for drilling a hole through it for making a kaval\n\nI also own some no-name chisels that work well enough and some card scrapers\nthat I still struggle sharpening.\n\nThe only power tools I have are a Makita drill and a random orbit sander on\nwhich I did spend some money, an old circular saw I found in that old shed (it\nwas good enough to cut miters on that laptop table) and a Dremel I use rarely\nbecause I don\u2019t like its power cord. I prefer battery powered tools.\n\n## # The window bench\n\nOur dog Cora loves sitting at the window, growling at old people and barking\nat children passing around. Yeah, she\u2019s terrified of children for some reason.\n\nBut the window sill is not wide enough and her leg kept falling with a \u201cclang\u201d\non the radiator below. So I widened it by placing two glued up boards of pine\non top of the radiator, that I planed and smoothed beforehand.\n\nCora sitting at the windowCora at the window, with the widened sill\n\n> This is when I learned that a hand plane is not some antique tool that\n> nobody uses anymore, but a quite versatile piece that can easily smoothen\n> grain where I would waste 5 sheets of sandpaper and choke on sawdust.\n\nI had to still let the heat radiate somehow, so I drilled large holes with a\nforstner bit, but I also blew the grain fibers on the underside because I had\nno idea of this possible problem. Turns out there is a simple solution to\ndrilling large holes without ripping the fibers:\n\n  1. Drill a small 3-6mm hole in the center with a normal wood drill, all the way to the other side (this will help see where the forstner bit should be place from both sides)\n  2. Place the forstner bit in the hole (this also helps with keeping the bit centered) and drill the large hole, stopping midway through the board\n  3. Turn the board around and repeat step 2 until you meet the other end of the hole\n\nWe also wanted to sit with Cora and there was not much space between the bed\nand the radiator, so I built a narrow bench. I used another two pine boards of\nthe same size, but this time glued them on the side to create a wider board.\n\nFor the legs, well the tree trimming continued near us, so one day I found\nsome thick cherry branches which I brought home, scraped the bark from them,\nthen attached them to the bench using screws from the top side.\n\nI was ok with a rustic look so I didn\u2019t spend much on finishing, patching\nholes, or even proper wood drying. I did use the hand plane to chamfer the\nedges though, I love taking those thin continuous wood shavings from the edge.\n\nWindow bench, in the morning sun\n\n## # The trunk coffee table\n\nCoffee table made out of a beech log\n\nWe recently visited my parents, and loved how the grass finally started\ngrowing in some spots where their house and court renovation was finished and\nwas no longer spewing cement dust. It was an abnormally sunny April and I\nwanted to chat with them at a coffee outside in the early morning before they\nstarted the field work, but there was nowhere to place the coffee outside.\n\n> First world problems right? If you read about The tail end, you might\n> already understand why a trivial thing like coffee time with my parents\n> feels so important to me.\n\nSo one day, while walking on a gravel road near their house, I noticed one\nneighbour had these huge logs of beech that were recently cut. I thought that\nwould be easy to turn into a small exterior coffee table, so I went to ask if\nI could buy one.\n\nWell I kind of had to yell \u201cHELLO!\u201d at their gate because I didn\u2019t know their\nname, and did that a few times until a seemingly sleepy old man appeared at\nthe front door (it was 5 PM) asking what I want. I asked how much he\u2019d want\nfor one of those logs, but he just said to get one, no money needed. Ok,\nthere\u2019s no point in insisting, I chose a wide enough but not too wide log,\nbecause these things are heavy and I wasn\u2019t sure I could lift it, and rolled\nit slowly back home.\n\nI didn\u2019t have my usual tools at my parents house, so I improvised. I found a\nbattered cleaver which my dad used for chopping kindling for the barbecue. I\nsharpened it as well as I could, then used a hammer to roll a burr on the back\nof the cleaver that I could use for scraping.\n\nScraping the bark off the beech log\n\nBeech wood has such a smooth hard wood under the bark that it didn\u2019t even need\nsanding. I used my dad\u2019s power planer to smooth out the top and make a quasi-\nflat surface then finished it with some walnut oil and it was (almost) ready!\n\nBecause the wood was so green, it was certain that it will crack and roughen\nas it dried. So I cut a groove and wrapped a flat iron band around the top to\nkeep it from moving too much. The bottom can expand as much as it wants, I\u2019m\nactually quite curious to watch the table morph throughout the summer as we\nuse it.\n\n## # The orchard bench\n\nBench made from reclaimed wood, for my parents-in-law orchard\n\nBecause we were born in villages that aren\u2019t that far apart, me and my wife\nalways visit both our parents in the same trip. This time when I got to my\nparents-in-law, I took a stroll through their little orchard. They added new\ntrees this year! I can\u2019t wait to taste the large apricots.\n\nWhat struck me as odd about the orchard was that there was no patch of grass\nto lay on. They like digging up the soil every year, and leaving it like that:\nan arid looking patch of land made of dry dirt boulders. I thought a bench\nwould be a good solution and what do you know, there was an old broken door\nthrown in the firewood pile just outside the orchard, that had the perfect\nlength and width for a bench. I forgot to take a photo of the door, but it\nlooked kind of like this one, only worse and with a large rhomboid \u25ca hole at\nthe top.\n\nold broken wooden door\n\nI got to work immediately, dismantling the door piece by piece and pulling out\nnail after nail (they really liked their nails in those old times). I was left\nwith two long and narrow wooden boards, a pile of rotten wood and two\npocketfuls of rusted nails.\n\nI sawed the broken ends of the boards, then I used my father-in-law\u2019s power\nplaner to remove the old gray wood from the top, bottom and sides to get to\nthe fresh wood below. There were a lot of holes and valleys so I had to scrape\nthem by hand with sandpaper rolled around a screwdriver. This took a few more\ndays than I expected, but I eventually got two cleanish boards of.. fir? pine?\nNo idea.\n\nI used a velcro sandpaper attachment for the battery powered drill to sand out\nthe rotten sides and give the boards a curvy and smooth live edge.\n\nCurvy live edge of the bench\n\nFor the legs, I stole some more firewood from their pile, where I found some\nthick branches of unidentified species that were roughly the same length.\nStripping the bark with an axe made them look good enough so I screwed them at\nthe four corners of the board. The bench was wobbly with just the legs, so I\nstrengthened it sideways by adding shorter and thinner branches of more\nunidentified wood between the legs and the center of the board.\n\nI had to do something with the rhomboid \u25ca hole, so I filled it with a square\n4-by-4 salvaged from a recently dismantled shed, and now the bench has 5 legs.\nInstead of sawing the leg to size, I left it protruding above the bench and\nplaced another thick salvaged board on top of it to serve as an arm rest, or\ncoffee table, or a place for the bowl of cherries.\n\nFor the finish, I burned the bench and the bottom of the legs to get a honey-\nbrown aspect and to make it water resistant. I put a very thin layer of\nwhatever wood lacquer I found in my in-laws shed, just for resistance because\nI don\u2019t like glossy wood.\n\nSide photo of the bench for a better view of the legs\n\n## # Other small wood things\n\n### # Water glass shelf\n\nWe don\u2019t have much space on the current eating table, so I built a two-shelf\nstand where we can place the always present water filter jug and the glasses\nand free up some of the center space.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible how strong just a few screws can be.\n\nTable shelf for holding water filter and glasses\n\n### # Kaval stand\n\nI thought I should finally do something about the kavals always rolling around\non some table or couch throughout the house, so I made a stand from long thin\nwood boards glued on the side, and finished it with sunflower oil to give it a\ngolden/orange colour.\n\nThis way I can always expand it by adding more boards to the side if I want to\nadd more flutes.\n\nStand for holding my kaval collection\n\n### # Sharpening block\n\nI need to sharpen blades almost daily, be it the pocket knife, axe, plane\nblade or chisels. So I made a custom sharpening block with the perfect tools\nfor my sharpening technique.\n\nSharpening block, diamond plate with leather strop on a beech base\n\nIt has a $5 diamond plate with 600 grit on one side and a $5 leather strop (a\npiece of leather belt might work just as well) on the other side. I attached\nthe leather with two small screws at the top so I can take it out easily if I\nneed a flexible strop for my carving gouge for example. It is loaded with\ndiamond paste which can be found for cheap at gemstone cutting online stores\n(the knife-specific pastes are a lot more expensive and I\u2019m not sure why).\n\nTo be honest, a $0.5 green compound (chromium oxide) works just as well for\nstropping, that\u2019s what I used before and still use for my detail carving\nknives. It gives a smoother edge than the diamond, the disadvantage being that\nit needs to be re-applied more often on the leather and that you need a bit\nmore blade passes to get the same result. The diamonds seem be cutting faster,\nbut really not much faster.\n\n#### # A bit of a tangent on the sharpening topic\n\nI went through all the phases with sharpening tools. I\u2019ve used water stones,\nnatural stones, ceramic stones, pull-through carbide sharpeners (don\u2019t use\nthese), powered belt sharpeners, wheel sharpeners.\n\nAside from the pull-through sharpeners and the steel rods, all the others work\njust as well with the right technique. I settled on the diamond plate because\nthey\u2019re cheap, stay flat, need zero maintenance, and can cut through any type\nof metal. Paired with a leather strop, for me it\u2019s the simplest way to\nsharpen.\n\nI recommend this OUTDOORS55 video for a no-bullshit sharpening tutorial and\nthe Science of Sharp blog if you\u2019re curious what the different sharpening\ntechniques do to an edge under a microscope.\n\n\u2190 The complex simplicity of my static websites\n\n", "frontpage": true}
