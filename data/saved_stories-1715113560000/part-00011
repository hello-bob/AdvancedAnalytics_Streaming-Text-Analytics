More than 30% of T2D\npatients eventually rely on exogenous insulin treatment. Cadaveric islet\ntransplantation is an effective treatment for insulin-dependent diabetes^3,4.\nNotably, improved metabolic control after islet transplantation is associated\nwith better kidney allograft function and long-term survival^5,6. However, the\napplication of islet transplantation is severely hampered due to the critical\nshortage of donor organs.\n\nThe pancreatic progenitor (PP) cells or islet tissues, generated from human\npluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), have been shown to survive, function and\nreverse hyperglycemia in diabetic animal models^7,8,9. In addition, a recent\nclinical trial has shown that, when subcutaneously implanted into T1D\npatients, the hPSC-derived pancreatic endodermal cells encapsulated with non-\nimmunoprotective devices were able to further mature into meal-responsive\n\u03b2-like cells and secrete insulin, albeit at the levels insufficient to achieve\nthe independence of exogenous insulin^10,11. Nevertheless, clinical\napplications of hPSC-derived cells are undermined by the complicated\ndifferentiation processes and the risk of having residual undifferentiated\ncells that may form teratomas in vivo. Recent studies have focused on\nidentifying intermediate stem cell types, including the non-tumorigenic human\nendoderm stem cells (EnSCs)^12, which appear to be more suitable as precursors\nfor large-scale generation of islet cells.\n\nHere, we report the intrahepatic implantation of islet tissue (E-islets)\ndifferentiated in vitro from autologous EnSCs in a T2D patient who had\nimpaired insulin secretion. This is a pilot study of an investigator-initiated\ntrial designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of E-islets for the\ntreatment of insulin-dependent diabetic patients (Fig. 1a). The patient was a\n59-year-old man with a 25-year history of T2D who developed end-stage diabetic\nnephropathy and underwent kidney transplantation in June of 2017 and displayed\npoor glycemic control since November of 2019, characterized by blood glucose\nlevel ranging from 3.66\u201314.60 mmol/L, mean amplitude of glycemic excursion\n(MAGE) of 5.54 mmol/L, the time-in-the-tight-target-range (TITR, 3.9\u20137.8 mM)\nof 56.7%, with daily hyperglycemic events (> 10.0 mmol/L) of 0.7/d and\nhypoglycemic events (< 3.9 mmol/L) of 0.3/d (Supplementary Table S1). Due to\nthe major concerns of hypoglycemia and the detrimental effect of poor glycemic\ncontrol on the long-term survival of the donor kidney, the patient agreed to\npursue transplantation with autologous E-islets.\n\nFig. 1: Preclinical studies and clinical outcomes of autologous E-islet\ntransplantation in a T2D patient.\n\na Brief scheme of major procedures involved in the generation and quality\ncontrol of E-islets and the safety/effectiveness evaluations of E-islet\ntransplantation. b\u2013d E-islets reverse hyperglycemia in STZ-induced diabetic\nimmunocompromised mice.

S1\u2013S3 and Table S6). E-islets displayed\nsimilar morphology (Supplementary Fig. S3a), endocrine cell composition\n(Supplementary Fig. S3b, c, e, f), gene expression patterns (Supplementary\nFig. S3d\u2013f) and in vitro functionality (Supplementary Fig. S3g) to human\ncadaveric islets, and showed functional efficacy in Streptozotocin\n(STZ)-induced diabetic mouse (Fig. 1b\u2013d) and monkey (Supplementary Fig. S4)\nmodels. The nontarget hepatic or intestinal lineages, when examined by either\nscRNA-seq (Supplementary Fig. S3f) or FACS (Supplementary Fig. S3h), were not\ndetected. Neither tumor formation nor cystic/ductal structures that indicate\ncell proliferation were detected in the immunocompromised animals transplanted\nwith either EnSCs or E-islets during the experiments (Supplementary Table S3).\nThe patient-specific E-islets survived and functioned under the kidney\ncapsules of the diabetic immunocompromised mice humanized with patient\u2019s own\nPBMCs, but rejected by the ones humanized with PBMCs from an unrelated\nvolunteer (Fig. 1e\u2013g; Supplementary Fig. S5), which suggests that patient\u2019s\nimmune system likely tolerates the autologous E-islets.\n\nThe patient underwent a percutaneous transhepatic portal vein transplantation\nwith 1.2 million IEQs of E-islets delivered, conforming to the regulatory\nguidance from the clinical islet transplantation registration. At designated\nvisits, examinations of endocrine function and diabetes-specific parameters by\nmixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) were performed at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,\n24, 36 and 48 weeks and thereafter at specified time points (Supplementary\nFig. S6a). The glycemic control of the patient was measured with a 24-h real-\ntime continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM).\n\nDuring the 116-week follow-up period, no tumor formation was detected either\nby MRI on the upper abdomen or by the measurements of serum tumor-related\nantigen markers. The treatment-emergent adverse events included: (1) temporary\nabdominal distension and loss of appetite within 4\u20138 weeks, relieved with\nmethionyltrichloride; (2) restorable weight loss < 5% (from 80 kg to 76 kg).\n\nThe three major clinical outcomes, the glycemic targets, the reduction of\nexogenous insulin and the levels of fasting and meal-stimulated circulating\nC-peptide/insulin were monitored throughout the first 116 weeks (Supplementary\nTables S4, S5). Marked changes in the patient\u2019s glycemic control were observed\nas early as week 2 post transplantation, as the MAGE declined from 5.50 mmol/L\nto 3.60 mmol/L, and the TITR increased rapidly from 56.7% to 77.8% (Fig. 1h;\nSupplementary Table S1). Over the same period, the time-above-range (TAR)\ndecreased by 55% from baseline, while the events of severe hyperglycemia (>\n13.9 mM) and hypoglycemia (< 3.9 mM) completely disappeared (Supplementary\nFig. S7a, b and Table S1). During the period between weeks 4 and 12, a\nsignificant reduction in ambulatory mean glucose fluctuations (from 5.50 to\n2.6 mmol/L) (Supplementary Table S1) and a steady rise in TITR (from 81% to\n90%) were observed (Fig. 1h; Supplementary Fig. S7c\u2013e and Table S1). After\nweek 32, the patient\u2019s TITR had readily reached 99% and was maintained\nthereafter (Fig. 1h, i; Supplementary Table S1), while MAGE, the gold standard\nof blood glucose variability, was reduced from 5.50 mM to 1.60 mM\n(Supplementary Figs. S6d, S7h\u2013l and Table S1). Importantly, no episodes of\nhypoglycemia or severe hyperglycemia were observed during the whole follow-up\nperiod of 116 weeks post surgery (Supplementary Fig. S7 and Table S1).\nAdditionally, MMTT revealed a trend of stabilization in glycemic variability\nafter surgery, as manifested by the stable fasting glucose concentrations and\nthe significant reductions in the post-meal glucose concentrations (maximum of\n21.3 mM at baseline vs maximum of 9.1 mM at week 105) (Fig. 1j; Supplementary\nTable S5). Consistently, the area under the curve (AUC) derived from the\n5-point intravenous glucose values decreased to 40% of baseline (Supplementary\nFig. S6b), confirmed by the AUCs of the values acquired from CGM\n(Supplementary Fig. S6c). The hemoglobin A1c levels decreased from 6.6%\n(baseline) to 5.5% (week 85) and 4.6% (week 113) (Fig. 1h; Supplementary Table\nS1).\n\nNotably, the insulin requirements were reduced gradually until complete\nwithdrawal at the end of week 11 (Fig. 1h), and the oral antidiabetic\nmedications were tapered since week 44 and discontinued at weeks 48 (acarbose)\nand 56 (metformin) (Supplementary Fig. S6a).\n\nThe average post-surgery fasting C-peptide level (0.68 nmol/L) increased by\n3-fold when compared to pre-surgery level (Fig. 1k; Supplementary Table. S5).\nNotably, the secretions of C-peptide (Fig. 1k) and insulin (Fig. 1l) measured\nby MMTT revealed significant elevations compared to those of the pre-surgery\ntests, as confirmed by the AUCs (Supplementary Fig. S6b).\n\nCollectively, we report the first-in-human tissue replacement therapy using\nautologous E-islets for a T2D patient with impaired islet function. The first\n27-month data revealed significant improvements in glycemic control, and\nprovided the first evidence that stem cell-derived islet tissues can rescue\nislet function in late-stage T2D patients. The grafts were well tolerated with\nno tumor formation or severe graft-related adverse events.\n\nThe precedent clinical trials using cadaveric islets or encapsulated hPSC-\nderived PPs^10,11, along with our study, have provided encouraging evidence\nthat islet tissue replacement is an effective cure for diabetic patients.\nNotably, the derivation of islet tissues from either hPSCs or EnSCs provides\nunprecedented new sources for tissue-replacement therapy. Despite the common\nproof-of-concept purpose, there are some distinctions among the published\ntrials^10,11 and ours. First, EnSC-based islet regeneration system is unique,\nin that EnSCs are nontumorigenic in vivo^12 and amenable for efficient mass\nproduction of islets as they are endoderm-specific and developmentally closer\nto pancreatic lineages. Second, our pilot study chose a T2D rather than T1D\npatient, which not only precluded the interference from autoimmune conditions\nfor the assessment of engraftment and functionality of E-islets but also\nextended the scope of indications for islet transplantation. As for the\nlimitations of this study, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that\nthe residual endogenous islets benefitted from the surgery and acquired\nfunctional improvements. Therefore, an increase in sample size and additional\ntrials of T1D patients with complete loss of islet \u03b2 cells will help draw\ndefinitive conclusions on the causative role of E-islets in the achievement of\nglycemic targets.\n\nFuture studies are warranted to address the pharmacodynamics of stem cell-\nderived islets as a drug, to extend the application of stem cell-derived islet\ntransplantation to other subtypes of diabetes, and to generate \u201cuniversal\nislets\u201d as off-the-shelf products to cure diabetes without the need for\nimmunosuppression.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
