To help navigate these,\nwe gathered insights from experienced serial founders, distilling eight\ntactical lessons they applied differently the second time around.\n\nCopy\n\nStarting another company is like asking a seasoned marathon runner to lace up\ntheir shoes, turn around and tackle another 26.2 miles \u2014 it takes an\nextraordinary level of determination and perseverance. While there is clarity\nand wisdom that comes from the experience of crossing the finish line before,\nthat doesn't mean the path ahead will be easy.\n\nWhile some of the challenges that plague the first-time founder \u2014 like co-\nfounder conflicts and hiring missteps \u2014 might be easier to sidestep, others \u2014\nlike the struggle to find product-market fit \u2014 are likely to still rear their\nugly heads. Then there\u2019s the added difficulty that the repeat founder\u2019s\nperspective may be clouded by past priorities and assumptions that no longer\nserve them. Here\u2019s how Dennis Pilarinos, two-time founder of Buddybuild and\nnow Unblocked, likes to analogize it:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re in an office right now. If we shut off all the lights and\nhad to walk through here, we'd probably bump into the desks and chairs, right?\nBecause we don\u2019t know where they are,\u201d Pilarnos says. \u201cBut if we\u2019ve been in\nhere before and we shut off the lights, we probably have some sense for where\nthings are. So the second time, you roughly know where the furniture is, but\nyou\u2019ll still bonk your toe on a few things.\u201d\n\nThere is a wealth of advice and resources available for first-time founders\ntackling the daunting challenge of building a company from scratch. We\u2019ve even\nrecently unpacked the subject ourselves on the Review. But we know the road\nalso looks a little different the second time around, so for the next part in\nthis series, we\u2019ve asked a select cohort of some of the smartest repeat\nfounders we know to share their most useful pieces of advice for starting a\ncompany again.\n\nTheir insights, compiled below, offer a unique window into navigating the\npsychological and operational challenges of starting up \u2014 all over again.\nWhile this advice is from the second-time founder lens, there\u2019s still plenty\nof wisdom to go around for first-timers, too. Let's dive in.\n\n## ON GETTING INTO THE RIGHT MINDSET:\n\nEvery repeat founder\u2019s reasons for starting something new are different. For\nsome, it\u2019s the allure of getting a successful exit or reaching a higher\nmountaintop. For others, they just can\u2019t stay away from the rush of building\nsomething new from scratch. But what most founders don't anticipate are the\nprofound impact to your mindset that comes with doing it all over again.\n\nWhen every milestone you reach in your company journey (closing a seed round,\nhiring your first engineer, closing your 100th customer) is no longer shiny\nand new, it can be harder to pull from that well of motivation that kept you\ngoing the first time. In this section, seasoned founders divulge what baggage\nsat alongside them as they slid into the driver\u2019s seat for the second time,\nalong with tactics for how they coped.\n\n### Don\u2019t let a past venture cast a shadow on your next one.\n\nBob Moore is a rare breed. A three-time founder and the current CEO at\nCrossbeam, Moore has scaled and sold companies in 2008, 2016 and is running\nthe ship at his latest company since 2018.\n\nMoore has shared his sage advice from his three different ventures on the\nReview before, but there\u2019s one tidbit we think is particularly relevant to\nstarting over again, which is not to let the outcome of your last venture\nweigh too heavily on your new one.\n\n\u201cWhen you get beat, when your strategies aren\u2019t working, when you have to do\nlayoffs, when you announce a modest acquisition \u2014 it\u2019s easy to hang your\nhead,\u201d says Moore. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly confidence-inspiring to see your first\nventure go somewhat quietly into the night. After the modest outcome of my\nfirst startup, I was questioning whether I could ever raise money again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was I going to say? \u2018Hey, I\u2019m the guy who pounded his chest before,\ntrust me this time?\u2019 It also gets personal, fast. You think, \u2018Have I wasted\nthese years of my life?\u2019 or \u2018Is my career as an entrepreneur over?\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nAs a first-time founder, it\u2019s easy to believe that the only return on\ninvestment you get from your startup is the proceeds from your exit. \u201cTurns\nout the experience was the real payoff,\u201d says Moore.\n\n> It wasn\u2019t until I was building my second company that I realized the upside\n> of falling on my face so many times at the first one.\n\nDan Siroker, Limitless\u2019s co-founder and CEO, also felt a similar weight going\ninto his next startup, mainly because his first company, Optimizely, is still\noperating and scaling.\n\n\u201cI had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder too. I want this to be the\ncategory-defining company that my last company could have been. I know it\nsounds silly, because Optimizely did do well and is still doing well, but it\u2019s\nrelative to what it could have been. That gap is what gives me energy and fuel\nand passion for this around,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI had some fear going into my second company that it wouldn\u2019t live up to my\nlast one. I had an irrationally high bar even being able to talk about what I\nwas working on that a first-time founder doesn\u2019t have. A first-time founder\njust wants something to be successful. They almost don\u2019t care what it is.\nThat\u2019s been the biggest psychological challenge this time around.\u201d\n\n> When you start from zero, nothing is ever going to be perfect. You need to\n> be willing to embrace that, and not let it get to you. They say perfect is\n> the enemy of good, and I subscribe to that.\n\nIn terms of how to weather that failure, Bob Moore points to the importance of\nself-care strategies. (He\u2019s previously relied on exercise and improv comedy.)\n\u201cDon\u2019t underplay that aspect, it\u2019s truly a big deal,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes the\ncompany's operational failures are actually outputs of the founder succumbing\nto decision fatigue. Or becoming overly paranoid or personally stressed. Or\nnot having the energy to build the support system that they need to succeed.\u201d\n\nDiscover what other lessons in resiliency Moore learned from building three\nstartups here.\n\n### Distance can make you a better decision-maker\n\nWhen Dennis Pilarinos was heads-down working on his first startup, Buddybuild,\nhe was burning the candle at both ends. \u201cAny number of people told me, \u2018You're\nrunning a marathon at a sprint pace, you won't be able to sustain it,\u2019\u201d\nPilarinos says. \u201cMy internal dialogue was like, watch me.\u201d\n\nHis behavior here most likely resonates with any founder. When a big part of\nyour identity becomes tied to your work, it\u2019s only natural to throw every\nounce of yourself into your startup. But with the benefit of hindsight,\nPilarinos now feels this mentality hurt more than it helped him in the long\nrun.\n\n\u201cNow I have evidence that distance from the problem helps you solve it\nbetter,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I take a day away from the things I\u2019m mulling over or\nthat I just can\u2019t seem to wrap my brain around, I come back to the problem and\nit\u2019s simpler to resolve. Without that distance, you start to lose the forest\nfor the trees. It can lead you down a different direction, and sometimes it\u2019s\nthe wrong one.\u201d\n\n> When you can see what is a tree from what\u2019s a forest, everything becomes a\n> lot clearer. It\u2019s counter to the feeling of perseverance, where you feel if\n> you keep hacking away at this one thing, you\u2019ll eventually figure it out.\n\nThese days, Pilarinos is diligent about time-blocking one day of the week and\ndedicating it entirely to rest. \u201cI'm very principled around the amount of time\nthat I spend on a weekend working,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a first-time founder, it was\nforeign to me that other people wouldn\u2019t be going into the office on a\nSaturday, as I had done so for so long. Now I\u2019m particularly strict around my\nSaturdays. I have a no phone, no computer rule. I actively try to do anything\nelse.\u201d\n\nThis simple buffer has helped Pilarinos stay at equilibrium amidst the high\nhighs and the low lows of startup life. \u201cYou're never as bad or as good as you\nthink you are. It's easy to say, but really hard to internalize. And so on the\ndays that you land that big deal, you're like, \u2018I'm invincible.\u2019 And then when\nthe system is down for an extended period of time or a demo goes poorly or a\ncustomer churns out, you think, \u2018Well, this is the end of the world,\u2019\u201d he\nsays.\n\n\u201cWith Buddybuild, I lived so intensely moment to moment where it was very,\nvery unhealthy. Now it still hurts, but I think I have a little bit more\nperspective to realize that it could be better, it could be worse \u2014 and it\nwill be.\u201d\n\nYou can find all of Pilarinos' essential lessons from building two startups\nhere.\n\n### Reshape your quest for fulfillment\n\nFounders spend arguably their most valuable currency, their time, for years on\nend, with no guarantee they\u2019re ever going to see a return on the investment.\n\nUnderstandably, this raises a few existential questions about how to keep\nyourself going, especially when you\u2019re in it again for the long haul. Feeling\nfulfilled with the job can be a huge internal motivator to keep founders\ngoing, but over-index on it, and you are more likely to come up empty. And\nit\u2019s a lesson that Clay\u2019s co-founder and CEO Kareem Amin learned the hard way.\n\nHis first company, Frame, was acquired by Sailthru in 2014. A couple of\nproduct leadership stints later (including one as VP of Product at the Wall\nStreet Journal) Amin was itching to get back into entrepreneurship. But this\ntime, he wanted to approach things differently, mainly by being mindful of his\nmental health.\n\n\u201cA challenge I had the first time around was treating my company too much like\nmy art project,\u201d Amin says. \u201cIt ended up decreasing the quality of my\ndecision-making, and it would lead the whole team to spiral. Because I was\nputting too much pressure on it to be successful and fulfilling,\u201d Amin says.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s tricky, right? Because for something to be fulfilling, you have to\nboth enjoy it, and it has to align with your ideals and goals.\u201d\n\nThis quest for fulfillment, in part, came from Amin\u2019s previous experience with\nclinching a successful exit for his company. He felt the weight of doing it\nagain on his shoulders. \u201cThere's this pressure to make the biggest thing. You\nkeep asking yourself is this the biggest market? But I don't think that's\nactually what's most valuable,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhen I started to shift my mindset to say, well, my startup doesn't have to\nbe the biggest thing. It just has to be what I think is useful and what other\npeople think is useful. And let's just start there, without putting all that\npressure on it needing it to be something other than what it is. So now I\napproach the problem with curiosity. I ask: well, what does this want to be?\u201d\n\n## ON EXPLORING IDEAS AGAIN:\n\nOnce you\u2019ve mentally prepared to pick up your tools and start building again,\nthe next step is to start sketching out what shape your product will take.\nThough typical startup lore has led many to believe inspiration seems to\nstrike at random, repeat founders know that a great idea needs to be\nvalidated. And that means doing your homework.\n\nThere\u2019s lots to consider in this ideation stage \u2014 it\u2019s also the pivotal time\nto start searching for the right teammates you will bring along for the ride.\nIn this section, we\u2019ll dive into two founders\u2019 examples of the first move they\nmade once they mentally prepped to start building again.\n\n### A tangible framework for choosing your next startup idea\n\nAfter nearly 10 years deeply embedded in the world of product-led growth, Neha\nNarkhede was ready for a new challenge. However, what exactly she wanted to\nbuild wasn\u2019t as clear.\n\nHer first startup Confluent, was an open-source project spun out of the data\nevent streaming platform Apache Kafka that Narkhede co-authored while still an\nemployee at Linkedin \u2014 and it eventually went public in 2021. After navigating\nthe thorny complexities of building open-source software and transitioning\nthat to a thriving SaaS business, she was on the hunt for a different type of\nchallenge.\n\n\u201cI wanted to experience building a traditional SaaS company, starting with a\nclosed-source product, working with a few early customers, taking it to\nmarket, and slowly starting to build the company,\u201d Narkhede says. \u201cThe two\nworlds are so different that just from a curiosity perspective, I knew it\nwould keep me going as a founder because I would learn something new every\nday.\u201d\n\nNeha Narkhede, co-founder at Oscilar\n\nSo when the opportunity presented itself to embark on a new venture, Narkhede\nknew she had to act fast. Intrigued by the risk assessment and fraud space\nfrom her previous startup, she went full force on launching Oscilar as a\nclosed-source, B2B SaaS startup.\n\nPulling from her insights as a previous founder, she was able to expedite the\nvalidation process by leaning on these two tactics:\n\n1) Study the market.\n\n  * \u201cIf you follow the market and there\u2019s a huge transition happening and you are offering the most powerful differentiated product, then that\u2019s the right problem to jump on. That was one of the big reasons why I picked the fraud and risk space \u2014 especially with a pandemic, everything was moving online and there still wasn\u2019t a right solution that\u2019s real-time and AI-powered that solves this problem.\u201d As a bonus, she had seen folks at both Confluent and LinkedIn struggling with fraud and risk, so that was an extra dose of confidence that there was a huge market to tap into.\n\n2) Talk to buyers.\n\n  * \u201cI set up meetings with 70 or 80 prospective buyers who were heads of risk at different companies in different industry verticals. I literally showed them a Figma prototype if they were to use a product like Oscilar to get that customer research to a point where people were ready to buy something \u2014 if only it existed. That was the deeper next step of validating if this was a real problem that people were willing to pay for. That\u2019s the most critical part of customer research that leads to successful companies.\u201d\n\nFor a closer look at how to win with both open and closed-source products,\nlisten to Narkhede's full interview here.\n\n### If your co-founder relationship isn\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it\n\nAs you start pulling the pieces together for another venture, it is just as\nwise to consider who you\u2019ll start another company with, as it is to nail down\nwhat product idea you will explore. And if the threepeat co-founders of Pilot\nrepresent anything, it\u2019s that if you hit a groove with your co-founders the\nfirst time, don\u2019t be so quick to toss that aside.\n\nNow on their third startup together, Jessica McKellar, Waseem Daher, and Jeff\nArnold have been working in tandem since they met as self-professed computer\nnerds at MIT. \u201cThe nerdiest of the computer nerds hung out at the computer\nclub,\u201d jokes McKellar. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where we met.\u201d\n\nThe first company they built out of college, KSplice, was acquired by Oracle.\nA year and one day later, the friends were back at it again to start Zulip\n(acquired by Dropbox). Now they steer the ship at Pilot \u2014 a bookkeeping and\ntax services startup with customers like OpenAI, Lattice and Airtable.\n\nWhile he was moderately intrigued by the idea of what would become Pilot, that\nwasn\u2019t the true pull for starting a bookkeeping company, according to Daher.\nTo hear him tell it, he was so determined to work with McKellar and Arnold\nagain that he was willing to do so at the expense of feeling stoked on the\nidea itself.\n\n> Far and away, the number one thing I optimized for my next startup was\n> working with smart, talented people who challenged me to do my best work\n> every day.\n\nMcKellar and Arnold were on the same exact page \u2014 so the three were very\ndeliberate about only focusing on pursuing startup ideas that the entire\nfounding trio agreed upon. \u201cMy co-founders and I started working together\nbecause we thought we were the most effective company leaders that we knew,\u201d\nMcKellar says. \u201cAnd then we stayed together because we proved that we were so\neffective as a group.\u201d\n\nPilot co-founders\n\n> A smooth co-founder relationship is a rare thing to experience, I would\n> never let go of it. I think that statistically, I wouldn't find it again, if\n> I were to try to start another company with other people.\n\nFor those looking to reverse engineer some of the magic of the Pilot co-\nfounders and weave it into their own, Daher shares the three tactical pointers\nto optimize for with your founding team:\n\n  * 1) Constructive tension. \u201cIt's not always smiles and roses and unicorns or whatever, there's always tension, but it\u2019s a healthy, constructive tension. In any long-term relationship, whether it's your close personal friends or your spouse, it's not like you can never fight, we certainly do, but the undercurrents that have allowed it to work are a strong mutual trust and respect for one another. Jeff, Jessica, and I each have big non-overlapping areas of ownership, and we trust one another to execute well in those areas of ownership. So, there's very little toe stepping, there's very little getting up in each other's businesses.\u201d\n  * 2) Shared Trust. \u201cWe have had a track record of working well together. I know that if Jeff or Jessica says, \u2018I'm going to do X, Y, Z,\u2019 I know that they'll do it, and vice versa. I could tell you, I think with 95% confidence what Jeff or Jessica would do or think in any given situation and vice versa. And the power of that is actually that we know when something is going to be controversial, and when the three of us should discuss it, as opposed to, \u2018Oh, this is a thing that is fine if I just go do it.\u2019 If there's an important thing, the three of us should talk about it. I don't think that like you're off building your own fiefdom or you're going to go do something sneaky that is in your interest and not my interest.\u201d\n  * 3) More energy in the reserves. \u201cA huge advantage of working with the same people as before is we can focus more of our mental energy on making the company successful, as opposed to spending that time debugging the founder relationship. One of the most common causes of death for a company in the early days is founder drama, so being able to solve for that from the get-go is very valuable in increasing the probability or the likelihood of success of the company.\u201d\n\nJust as the Pilot team optimized for happiness by getting the band back\ntogether, Dennis Pilarnos brought several of his former team members at\nBuddybuild with him for his second venture, Unblocked. \u201cSharing the same set\nof beliefs in how we operate was important to us the second time around,\u201d\nPilarnos says.\n\nWhen building with the same folks, he encourages other repeat founders to be\nmindful of checking their priors and reassessing old processes.\n\n\u201cIt's an interesting dynamic because as we're growing the team now, we have\nthis pre-baked culture and perspective on things. There were 10 of us that\nstarted right out of the gate together where we have that shared that\nbackground. So as we bring people in, I'm very mindful and explicit in\nobserving what predispositions we have that we need to reevaluate or reassess.\nMake sure you can answer: What makes them special?\u201d\n\n## ON STAYING SHARP WHILE BUILDING\n\nWhen you build one company and it's successful, founders run the risk of\nhardening their view on the right way to do something \u2014 on everything from how\nto build products to how to distribute pricing and packaging and so on.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a hidden variable problem, where often things work in ways\nthat you might not entirely understand. Put simply: did things work because of\nthat thing or in spite of it?\n\nIn this section, repeat founders share some of the biggest potholes they\u2019ve\ndriven over and what they think would\u2019ve made for a smoother ride.\n\n### Stay in front of customers, always.\n\nWhen serial entrepreneur Steve Blank was just starting out in his career, he\nreported to a repeat founder and CEO. \u201cThe founder was incredibly successful\nat his first company. He took it from 0 to $400 million, and this was back in\nthe 1980s,\u201d Blank says. \u201cHe was out in front of customers all the time, always\nlistening, always pivoting.\u201d\n\nFast forward a couple of years, and Blank was working at this founder\u2019s second\nventure. He noticed something markedly different about where the founder spent\nhis time. \u201cGuess where this CEO was? In front of customers? Hell no. He was\nwining and dining investors. And who was spending time in front of the\ncustomers? I was,\u201d Blank recalls.\n\n\u201cWhat I found in those customer conversations was that we were building a\nproduct no one wanted. When I went back to tell this founder, what do you\nthink was his response? He said, \u2018Hey, I raised money based on these promises,\ngo back and try to sell this stuff.\u2019\u201d\n\n> If you look at what makes or breaks a second startup, luck has something to\n> do with it, and hubris has a lot to do with it.\n\nThese days, Blank teaches entrepreneurship and national security innovation at\nStanford. He\u2019s been a part of or co-founded eight different Silicon Valley\nstartups \u2014 running the gamut from semiconductors, video games, personal\ncomputers, and supercomputers.\n\nBut this early experience is one that stuck with him throughout his whole\ncareer. \u201cWhat this founder didn\u2019t realize is it was their customer insight\nthat was the key to his initial success, not his own.\u201d\n\n> There\u2019s no guarantee that you are going to learn from your successes or\n> failures, but what I\u2019ve found is this: If you can\u2019t draw it on a whiteboard\n> or you can\u2019t teach it to someone else, you probably haven\u2019t learned\n> anything.\n\nMore of Blank's lessons on mastering entrepreneurship and studying customers\nhere.\n\n### Place a focus on focus\n\nFocus is a finicky thing for startup founders. There\u2019s lots of conventional\nstartup wisdom out there pointing to the rewards of staying diligently on\ntask, and other more contrarian takes that pivoting is a healthy (and even\nnecessary) part of the path to product-market fit.\n\nBut after experimenting with both of these approaches at his last startup and\nthe beginning years at Clay, Kareem Amin leans toward the former.\n\n\u201cAn issue I had is I would get excited about something else in the middle of a\nsprint and start doing that,\u201d Amin says. \u201cIf a customer told us that they\nneeded a certain feature then our product would be great, we\u2019d switch gears\nentirely. I had to learn to discipline myself and the team.\u201d\n\nClay co-founder and CEO Kareem Amin\n\nTo practice more rigorous focus, Amin took a closer look at embedding focus\ninto his day-to-day routine, even taking a magnifying glass to his\nconversations.\n\n\u201cIt took a lot of work to shift my attention and perspective to say, the\nvision part is not the problem. Our ambition was large. What was missing was\nclarity around what I was working on each day. And the next day. I started\ntelling people once we agree to something and it's on our sprint planning,\nnothing will shift it. If you're walking to work and you happen to have a new\nidea, throw it away. You hear a lot of people give the advice to stay focused,\nbut what is focus?\u201d Amin says. \u201cSome folks think it's dedicating your mornings\nto some work and then at night you switch gears to something different.\u201d\n\n> For me, focus means that I don\u2019t even think about anything else. If you even\n> start the sentence, \u2018imagine this other world...\u2019 in your head, you're not\n> focused.\n\nFor more techniques on focus and a deeper dive into founder psychology, check\nout our full interview with Amin here.\n\n### Play the instrument you\u2019re best at\n\nFor most founders, the prospect of relinquishing the CEO role as their company\ncrosses the Series A threshold would be unthinkable. But Lloyd Tabb is not\nyour typical founder. He\u2019s learned through hard-won experience that sometimes\nthe best path forward means making tough decisions and letting go of control.\n\nAfter fighting in the fundraising trenches with his business partner (and\nLooker\u2019s President at the time) Frank Bien, Tabb realized that Bien deserved\nthe CEO title. \u201cLooking back now, I firmly believe the reason that Looker has\nexecuted to the degree that it has is because we brought in professional\nmanagement,\u201d says Tabb. \u201cIt was obvious that Frank was a man of very high\nintegrity and he knew enterprise software \u2014 he knew how to execute in this\nspace. So while it felt like I was taking a risk by turning over the CEO role\nand committing us to the enterprise route, I reminded myself that startups are\nall about risks \u2014 and he was a much better bet than I was.\u201d\n\n> As a repeat founder, I often like to say that I\u2019m a one-man band. I\u2019ve\n> played all the instruments and can do just about every startup job. But that\n> doesn\u2019t mean I do them all well. Keep the instrument you\u2019re best at, and\n> give the rest away.\n\nRead the full story of how Looker turned a 216-word pitch email into a $2.6\nbillion acquisition here.\n\n## The Review\n\n  * Articles\n  * Collections\n  * Series\n  * Newsletter\n  * Podcast\n\n## RSS Feeds\n\n## Around the Web\n\n", "frontpage": false}
