The US Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on Evidence\nRules, an eight-member panel responsible for drafting evidence-related\namendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence, heard from computer scientists\nand academics about the potential risks of AI being used to manipulate images\nand videos or create deepfakes that could disrupt a trial.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nLawyer cited 6 fake cases made up by ChatGPT; judge calls it \u201cunprecedented\u201d\n\nThe meeting took place amid broader efforts by federal and state courts\nnationwide to address the rise of generative AI models (such as those that\npower OpenAI's ChatGPT or Stability AI's Stable Diffusion), which can be\ntrained on large datasets with the aim of producing realistic text, images,\naudio, or videos.\n\nIn the published 358-page agenda for the meeting, the committee offers up this\ndefinition of a deepfake and the problems AI-generated media may pose in legal\ntrials:\n\n> A deepfake is an inauthentic audiovisual presentation prepared by software\n> programs using artificial intelligence. Of course, photos and videos have\n> always been subject to forgery, but developments in AI make deepfakes much\n> more difficult to detect. Software for creating deepfakes is already freely\n> available online and fairly easy for anyone to use. As the software\u2019s\n> usability and the videos\u2019 apparent genuineness keep improving over time, it\n> will become harder for computer systems, much less lay jurors, to tell real\n> from fake.\n\nDuring Friday's three-hour hearing, the panel wrestled with the question of\nwhether existing rules, which predate the rise of generative AI, are\nsufficient to ensure the reliability and authenticity of evidence presented in\ncourt.\n\nSome judges on the panel, such as US Circuit Judge Richard Sullivan and US\nDistrict Judge Valerie Caproni, reportedly expressed skepticism about the\nurgency of the issue, noting that there have been few instances so far of\njudges being asked to exclude AI-generated evidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm not sure that this is the crisis that it's been painted as, and I'm not\nsure that judges don't have the tools already to deal with this,\" said Judge\nSullivan, as quoted by Reuters.\n\nLast year, Chief US Supreme Court Justice John Roberts acknowledged the\npotential benefits of AI for litigants and judges, while emphasizing the need\nfor the judiciary to consider its proper uses in litigation. US District Judge\nPatrick Schiltz, the evidence committee's chair, said that determining how the\njudiciary can best react to AI is one of Roberts' priorities.\n\nIn Friday's meeting, the committee considered several deepfake-related rule\nchanges. In the agenda for the meeting, US District Judge Paul Grimm and\nattorney Maura Grossman proposed modifying Federal Rule 901(b)(9) (see page\n5), which involves authenticating or identifying evidence. They also\nrecommended the addition of a new rule, 901(c), which might read:\n\n> 901(c): Potentially Fabricated or Altered Electronic Evidence. If a party\n> challenging the authenticity of computer-generated or other electronic\n> evidence demonstrates to the court that it is more likely than not either\n> fabricated, or altered in whole or in part, the evidence is admissible only\n> if the proponent demonstrates that its probative value outweighs its\n> prejudicial effect on the party challenging the evidence.\n\nThe panel agreed during the meeting that this proposal to address concerns\nabout litigants challenging evidence as deepfakes did not work as written and\nthat it will be reworked before being reconsidered later.\n\nAnother proposal by Andrea Roth, a law professor at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, suggested subjecting machine-generated evidence to the\nsame reliability requirements as expert witnesses. However, Judge Schiltz\ncautioned that such a rule could hamper prosecutions by allowing defense\nlawyers to challenge any digital evidence without establishing a reason to\nquestion it.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nWith Stable Diffusion, you may never believe what you see online again\n\nFor now, no definitive rule changes have been made, and the process continues.\nBut we're witnessing the first steps of how the US justice system will adapt\nto an entirely new class of media-generating technology.\n\nPutting aside risks from AI-generated evidence, generative AI has led to\nembarrassing moments for lawyers in court over the past two years. In May\n2023, US lawyer Steven Schwartz of the firm Levidow, Levidow, & Oberman\napologized to a judge for using ChatGPT to help write court filings that\ninaccurately cited six nonexistent cases, leading to serious questions about\nthe reliability of AI in legal research. Also, in November, a lawyer for\nMichael Cohen cited three fake cases that were potentially influenced by a\nconfabulating AI assistant.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n31\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
