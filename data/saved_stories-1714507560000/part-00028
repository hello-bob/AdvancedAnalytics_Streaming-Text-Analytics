The issue remains the same, but the\nrise of AI increases its importance and its difficulty. Here are words on the\nsubject, illustrated by photos all of which have been processed with AI\ntechnology.\n\nTulip blossom, captured with twenty-year old analog technology, enhanced with\nAI.\n\nThere\u2019s an amusing story about the technology behind these flower pictures,\ndown at the bottom of this piece.\n\nBack in 2004 \u00b7 I was already using Photoshop but in fully-autodidactic mode,\nso I thought I should read a book about it, and selected one by Scott Kelby,\n\u201cThe Photoshop guy\u201d back then and still active in the space, two decades\nlater. It was a good book, but I was left wide-eyed and shocked: I\u2019ll quote\nfrom that piece for those of you who don\u2019t want to step back twenty years in\ntime and read it: \u00b6\n\n> Personal Improvement \u00b7 In particular, Kelby walks through an astounding list\n> of techniques for improving portraits, and I quote: removing blemishes,\n> removing dark circles under the eyes, lessening freckles or facial acne,\n> removing or lessening wrinkles, colorizing hair, whitening the eyes, making\n> eyes that sparkle, enhancing eyebrows and eyelashes, glamour skin softening,\n> transforming a frown into a smile, doing a digital nose job, slimming and\n> trimming, removing love handles, and finally slimming buttocks, arms and\n> thighs.\n>\n> Integrity? \u00b7 Screw it, integrity is history. The image is no longer the\n> capture of a instant\u2019s light and colour, it\u2019s, well... whatever you and\n> Photoshop make of it.\n\nPhotointegrity \u00b7 I proposed a definition at the time: \u201cwhat I\u2019m going to do is\nstrive to balance Truth and Beauty. In practical terms, this means the goal is\nmake the picture look as much as possible like what I saw, as opposed to as\ngood as possible.\u201d \u00b6\n\nSimple yellow flower, captured with twenty-year old analog technology,\nenhanced with AI.\n\nI can\u2019t claim that I follow that strictly; most of the pictures in this space\ncome out of the camera looking less pleasing than what I remember seeing, but\nI will confess that the version you see is often prettier than that memory.\nUsually, that results from the application of a bunch of Adobe technologies.\n\nIs that OK? It\u2019s a judgment call. Is there anything that isn\u2019t a judgment\ncall? Funny you should ask, because Adobe just announced the Firefly\nGenerative AI 3 model, around which the next version of Photoshop is being\nbuilt. Hitting those links and just scrolling through the pictures will give\nyou a feeling for what this software will do.\n\nLet me put a stake in the ground. I believe these things:\n\n  1. If you use generative tools to produce or modify your images, you have abandoned photointegrity.\n\n  2. That\u2019s not always wrong. Sometimes you need an image of a space battle or a Triceratops family or whatever.\n\n  3. What is always wrong is using this stuff without disclosing it.\n\nThe C2PA angle \u00b7 Last October, I wrote up C2PA, a useful digital watermarking\ntechnology that can be used to label images and video. That piece\u2019s\npredictions look like they\u2019re coming true; several manufacturers have\nannounced C2PA support. I\u2019m not going to take the space here to describe C2PA\nagain. \u00b6\n\nI do note that Photoshop already supports C2PA and when it writes a watermark\nsaying \u201cEdited with Photoshop\u201d, that label includes a very few words about\nwhat it did: cropping, levels adjustment, and so on; no details.\n\nI believe strongly that when people use Adobe\u2019s Firefly generative AI to\ncreate or augment pictures, Photoshop should by default turn C2PA labeling on,\nand disclose in the watermark whether it is fully-generated or just augmented.\nSure, the person generating the image can always take that watermark out, but\nthey can\u2019t change its contents, and assuming C2PA becomes ubiquitous, the\nabsence of a watermark would be reasonable grounds for suspicion.\n\nFruit tree blossoms, not open yet, captured with twenty-year old analog\ntechnology, enhanced with AI.\n\nAI + photointegrity? \u00b7 Over the last couple of years, the way I use Adobe\nLightroom has changed a whole lot, and it\u2019s mostly because of AI.\nSpecifically, smart select. Lightroom now offers Select functions for Subject,\nBackground, Sky, and Object. There\u2019s also a very useful \u201cDuplicate and invert\u201d\nfor any selection. I use these for almost every photo I take, especially\nSelect Sky. The amount of light in the sky differs from that down here on the\nsurface, and I\u2019m pretty sure that our eyes compensate for that. Almost every\npicture looks more \u201creal\u201d when you select the sky and dial the brightness down\n(rarely: up) a touch, and maybe bump the contrast a bit. \u00b6\n\nThis photo would have been a complete failure without those tools.\n\nAllyson\u2019s parents speak to the crowd at her memorial.\n\nRecently we were at a memorial social for our recently-deceased friend\nAllyson. It was on a rooftop, on a bright grey day; the volume of light coming\nout of the sky was insane, and kept turning my photographic subjects into dark\nsilhouettes.\n\nThe photo of Ally\u2019s parents addressing the crowd is not great (her mom\u2019s eyes\nare closed) but it at least captures a moment. The original was totally\nunusable, because the subjects are under a canopy and thus shaded, while the\nsky and cityscape and even mountains were reflecting harshly. So you select\nthe subject, you invert and duplicate, you add light to the subject and\nsubtract from the rest, and you get something that looks exactly like what I\nsaw.\n\nOf course, this depends on a good camera with a lot of dynamic range that can\nfish detail out of shadows.\n\nI think this process retains photointegrity.\n\nAI-enhanced analog \u00b7 What happened was, the sun came out after the rain,\neverything is blooming this time of year, and I wanted to take pictures. I was\nrummaging for lenses and there was this dark shape at the back of the shelf.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I thought. It turned out to be an old Pentax with \u201cMacro\u201d in\nits name. Just the thing! Here\u2019s what the combo looks like. \u00b6\n\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\nBy the way, one reason the Internet is still good is that random enthusiasts\nmaintain obscure databases, for example of camera lenses, from whence this smc\nPentax-D FA 100mm F/2.8 Macro, an alternate version of which rejoices in the\nname \u201cSchneider-Kreuznach D-Xenon\u201d. It seems to have been manufactured only\naround 2004. I wrote about buying it in 2011 and shooting flowers and dancers\nwith it in 2014; lotsa groovy pix in both.\n\nAnyhow, this lens does a fabulous job of isolating foreground and background.\nGiven this to chew on, Lightroom\u2019s AI gizmo does a fabulous job of selecting\njust the flower (or background). So it\u2019s easy to sharpen the flower and fade\nthe bokeh; the old lens and the bleeding-edge software were made for each\nother.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nPhotointegrity matters \u00b7 It mattered in 2004 and it matters more every passing\nyear as our level of trust in online discourse falls and the power of\ngenerative AI grows. We have the tools to help address this, but we need to\nthink seriously, and use them when appropriate. \u00b6\n\nUpdated: 2024/04/29\n\nongoing\n\nWhat this is \u00b7 Truth \u00b7 Biz \u00b7 Tech\n\nauthor \u00b7 Dad colophon \u00b7 rights\n\nApril 29, 2024 \u00b7 Arts (11 fragments) \u00b7 \u00b7 Photos (983 more) \u00b7 Technology (90\nfragments) \u00b7 \u00b7 ML-AI (3 more)\n\nBy Tim Bray.\n\nThe opinions expressed here are my own, and no other party necessarily agrees\nwith them.\n\nA full disclosure of my professional interests is on the author page.\n\nI\u2019m on Mastodon!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
