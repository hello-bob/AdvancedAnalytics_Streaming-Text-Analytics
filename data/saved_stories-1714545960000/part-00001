The task of rendering the controlled environment of a well-\nknown racing circuit makes most modern sims a bit easier to understand, and\nthe physical footprints of screens, seats, VR goggles, and motion systems\ncontinue to shrink. But now, leading developer CXC Simulations has unveiled a\nmassive sim that offers a more embodied experience of off-road racing. The\nproject began in partnership with Norwegian Cruise Line, but CXC will now sell\nthe Motion Pro Truck to the general public, albeit at a starting price of\n$600,000.\n\nI visited CXC's headquarters in Los Angeles to learn more about how the wild\nphysicality of high-speed off-roading translates to sim racing. After all, the\ncompany's most popular Motion Pro II sim setup typically features a compact\nracing seat, steering wheel, and pedals atop a small base platform, with the\nchoice of one or three screens or a set of VR goggles. The Motion Pro II has\nproved popular since founder Chris Considine originally launched CXC out of\nhis garage in 2007, to the point that his company now works with professional\nracing teams, enthusiasts, federal government agencies, the military, and law\nenforcement agencies on six continents.\n\nI tested CXC's Motion Pro II, which is equipped with three 55-inch screens,\nand Considine loaded me into a Radical SR8 racecar at the Watkins Glen\ncircuit. The realistic pedals and steering wheel feedback, as well as subtle\ntilting at the seat of my pants and seatbelts that tightened under hard\nbraking, all contributed to a fun experience. And as someone who typically\nsuffers from motion sickness, I never felt any nausea creeping in\u2014while\nappreciating how much the wraparound triple screens contributed to a sense of\nspeed that other single-screen sims entirely lack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge / The Motion Pro II is CXC's bread and butter simulator.\n\nMichael Teo Van Runkle\n\nDespite never having driven at Watkins Glen, much less in a Radical, my skills\nbegan to improve noticeably after just a few laps. The Motion Pro II toed the\nline between gaming and training, as I witnessed my mind adapting to the\ndivergent inputs, though I can still report that sim driving still can't quite\nmatch all the realities of driving a real car around a real track at high\nspeed.\n\nThe Motion Pro Truck sat in a wide-open space behind a shipping container next\nto CXC's assembly line, where I spotted about 15 Motion Pro IIs in various\nstages of production. The sheer size surprised me since I knew the truck\nneeded to fit on a cruise ship, so I asked Considine how the project of\nbuilding a race truck sim came about in the first place.\n\n## Putting an F1 car on a cruise liner\n\n\"We've been building simulators for Norwegian [Cruise Line] for a little over\n10 years now,\" he explained. \"Every year, they typically order eight of our\nregular Motion Pro II simulators, and then what they call a halo project,\nwhich is something that is just so bonkers and so cool that everybody has to\ntake pictures and share it on social and do all that sort of stuff,\" Considine\nsaid.\n\nPrevious installations included a sim built into a real Williams F1 car in\n2009, then whole race car bodies that moved on motion systems. When Norwegian\nasked CXC to outdo those previous builds, Considine envisioned the truck as a\nconcept to attract more spectators. And the sheer size factor surely succeeds\nin that regard.\n\nEnlarge / The body is from a real off-road racing truck.\n\nMichael Teo Van Runkle\n\nThere are no shrunken proportions here, as CXC sources a real Pro Lite chassis\nfrom the Lucas Oil Off-Road Racing Series for the truck itself. In total, the\ntruck can move through six degrees of freedom, with about three feet of travel\nin every direction. The setup weighs about 3,000 pounds (1,360 kg) and runs on\n400 V three-phase power, with a transformer the size of a mini-fridge nearby,\nnext to a small standalone screen that initiates the sim and allows spectators\nto see what the driver experiences.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n29\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\nToday on War Stories, Ars Technica is joined by Dan Greenawalt, Creative\nDirector of the Forza franchise, who takes us through the colossal potential\n(and many challenges) of utilizing deep neural networks to build sophisticated\nracing AI. Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
