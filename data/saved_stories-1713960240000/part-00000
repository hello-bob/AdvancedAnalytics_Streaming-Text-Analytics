The Thermonator, what Throwflame bills as \"the first-ever\nflamethrower-wielding robot dog\" is now available for purchase. The price?\n$9,420.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nElon Musk sells 10,000 flamethrowers in 48 hours [Updated]\n\nThermonator is a quadruped robot with an ARC flamethrower mounted to its back,\nfueled by gasoline or napalm. It features a one-hour battery, a 30-foot flame-\nthrowing range, and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity for remote control\nthrough a smartphone.\n\nIt also includes a LIDAR sensor for mapping and obstacle avoidance, laser\nsighting, and first-person view (FPV) navigation through an onboard camera.\nThe product appears to integrate a version of the Unitree Go2 robot quadruped\nthat retails alone for $1,600 in its base configuration.\n\nThe Robot Dog With A Flamethrower | Thermonator\n\nThe company lists possible applications of the new robot as \"wildfire control\nand prevention,\" \"agricultural management,\" \"ecological conservation,\" \"snow\nand ice removal,\" and \"entertainment and SFX.\" But most of all, it sets things\non fire in a variety of real-world scenarios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * Remote controlling rhe Thermonator robot flamethrower dog.\n\nThrowflame\n\n  * The Thermonator robot flamethrower dog.\n\nThrowflame\n\n  * The Thermonator robot flamethrower dog.\n\nThrowflame\n\n  * The Thermonator robot flamethrower dog.\n\nThrowflame\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nBack in 2018, Elon Musk made the news for offering an official Boring Company\nflamethrower that reportedly sold 10,000 units in 48 hours. It sparked some\ncontroversy because flamethrowers can also double as weapons or potentially\nstart wildfires.\n\nIn the US, flamethrowers are legally unregulated in 48 states and are not\nconsidered firearms by federal agencies. Restrictions exist in Maryland, where\nflamethrowers require a Federal Firearms License to own, and California, where\nthe range of flamethrowers cannot exceed 10 feet.\n\nEven so, to state the obvious, flamethrowers can easily burn both things and\npeople, starting fires and wreaking havoc if not used safely. Accordingly, the\nThermonator might be one Christmas present you should skip for little Johnny\nthis year.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n97\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
