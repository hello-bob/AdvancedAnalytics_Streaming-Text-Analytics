They are the latest in a string of shutdowns that show a publishing\nindustry turning away, or growing increasingly hostile, to the web.\n\nAnd there is, of course, a lot to unpack about what is happening. It\u2019s perhaps\ntaken up by no one better than Casey Newton writing in his own corner of the\nweb, The Platformer. In \u201cHow platforms killed Pitchfork,\u201d Newton has a number\nof incisive, prescient insights about the way in which platforms are\ndestroying themselves in an attempt to commoditize attention.\n\nBut one thing that\u2019s kind of sticking with me is this passing observation\nabout the way Spotify leverages AI and algorithms to generate playlists for\npeople that capture their tastes.\n\n> On one level it\u2019s impressive that Spotify can perfectly capture my musical\n> taste in a series of data points, and regurgitate it to me in a series of\n> weekly playlists. But as good as it has gotten, I can\u2019t remember the last\n> time it pointed me to something I never expected I would like, but\n> ultimately fell totally in love with.\n\nIn a sense, the machines that recommend things to us lack a human imagination.\nI\u2019m not the first person to observe that a lack of genuine and human-centered\ndiscovery does seem to be a significant void in the modern web. Ironically, as\nwe construct algorithmically-fortified communities designed to guide us\ntowards our preferences, we become so much like automatons ourselves, steered\nonly towards what we\u2019ve already pre-established as our likes and dislikes.\nIt\u2019s not just Spotify. Platforms move us toward homogeneity because it\u2019s\nconvenient for them to do so.\n\nThere has been a response, a countervailing force by individuals reclaiming a\nsmaller and more personal web that actually attempts to redefine discovery\nthrough the lens of human insights and curation. Like the Luddites spited\nmodernism, these creators are attempting to resist the dehumanization of\nalgorithms by creating the unexpected and the unfamiliar.\n\nBut these two sides, if you can even call them that, lack definition and\ncohesiveness. On one side, there is a web created by (and sometimes for),\nmachine-driven algorithms and generated content. On the other side, we have a\nmuch less centralized web created by and for humans. The latter version has a\nfew different names: The small web, the personal web, digital gardens. But for\nme, the contrast is more a conflict between analog and digital. So, I\u2019ve come\nto think of this other side as the analog web.\n\n# A History of Analog\n\nThe concept of analog computing \u2014 in reference to technology \u2014 was developed\nin 1940\u2019s, some time before digital computing became widespread. In its\noriginal use, analog computing referred to a device that relied on mechanical\nmeans and other systems of measurements to complete computing tasks rather\nthan the bits and bytes of modern computers. Maybe the most famous example was\nthe differential analyzer, popularized by Vanneaver Bush, who would have his\nown lasting impact on the mid-20th century world and eventually the web (and\nwho was played by Matthew Modine in the Christopher Nolan film Oppenheimer).\n\nThe differential analyzer was a gigantic table with a number of levers and\nshafts that ultimately could be used to crunch numbers and complete various\ncomputing tasks. But it was eventually superseded by the digital computer\nintroduced in the 1960\u2019s which, of course, captured popular and academic\nimaginations.\n\nIt was only at this time that academics and researchers sought a word to\ndistinguish these different forms of computing. They settled on analogue\n(shortened to \u201canalog\u201d in American usage) versus digital.\n\nBut as digital computing became more commonplace, it began to consume other\nindustries and technologies. Music compression, digital film projectors and\ncameras, and digital watches are all artifacts of this transition to a digital\nworld compressed into bytes.\n\nAnd each time digital technology swoops in, a loosely organized community of\nanalog practitioners and hobbyists preserved and distributed its analog\ncounterpart as a bulwark against its erasure. Over time, the word \u201canalog\u201d\ncame to include an increasingly broad set of technologies that relied on\nmechanical means of creation and reproduction \u2014 the record player, the tape\nrecorder, and the film camera to name a few.\n\nMore than just a word, \u201canalog\u201d technologies formed the basis for a new\nculture. Analog\u2019s usage in popular culture came to refer to a world that was\nslower and more considered, even in the face of digital technologies that were\ncheaper and more broadly utilitarian. Flaws in analog technology were\nsomething to be celebrated for its uniqueness rather than a wrinkle to be\nsmoothed out. And so analog as a term is used to tether us to a mechanical\nframework of the world.\n\n# The Web, By Humans\n\nThe web is, by definition, a digital technology. It is grounded in the\nefficiency and scale of digital computing. But there is and always has been a\ntension at the center of it, between commercial interests in a global network\ncomprised of billions and a fractured community of creators building things\nfor their own sake.\n\nFor instance, in the much earlier days of the web, a group of artists and\nwriters found each other out amongst the nodes of the network. They began\ncreating websites unified only by a shared interest in what could be achieved\non the web. After a while, they gathered under the banner of Internet Art, or\nnet.art for short. Their online creations ranged from hypertext poetry and\navant garde stories to websites that extended performances into the real world\nor challenged the idea of what a website even was.\n\nI refer, as I have before, to Rachel Greene in reference to her book about\nNet.art and the importance of the movement:\n\n> I refuse to let commercial interests dominate the history and perception of\n> the net because I think they would exclude the most important and dynamic\n> internal content \u2013 the aesthetic, creative, radical, political ideas and\n> experiments\n\nMuch like the analog practitioners in the wake of digital, the glitches and\nflaws and stutters and stops of the web medium were interesting to net\nartists. They tried to slow the whole thing down and understand what makes the\ninteractive web, as a medium, unique. And their experiments were incredibly\nimportant in finding that out.\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only ones to try. Every so often, a new group shows up on the\nweb\u2019s fringes, hidden below the view of commercial scale, and tries stuff out.\nWe\u2019ve seen this manifest in other movements like Silicon Alley, the Antiweb,\nand the IndieWeb, or in technologies like webrings and federation. These\nmovements have been big and small, but they have all made some impact as a\ncollective force.\n\n# The Analog Web\n\nThe other side of the web has leaned into, as Greene calls it, commercial\ninterests. It is the side of the web that driven by a quest for optimization \u2014\nor the walled gardens in a race to the bottom of the enshittification cycle.\n\nThere is even an increasingly large part of the web caught up in eating its\nown tail. Content is generated by machine-driven AI meant to capture the\nattention of machine-driven algorithms in an attempt to monetize\nprogrammatically inserted adverts that are optimized (and in some cases only\never really viewed by) more machines. With each new turn around the\nalgorithmic web, we get a version that is more and more stripped of its\nhumanity.\n\nRadical, creative experiments have never stopped. Owning your own piece of the\nInternet (to borrow a recent phrase from Anil Dash) is itself a radical act.\nLinking to others at will is subversive all on its own. Or as Jeremy Keith\nonce put it, \u201cit sounds positively disruptive to even suggest that you should\nhave your own website.\u201d The web still exists for everyone. And beneath this\nincreasingly desiccated surface, there is plenty of creators still simply\ncreating.\n\nPeople create these sites simply so that they exist. They are not fed to an\nalgorithm, or informed by any trends. It is quieter and slower, meant to\ntether us to a more mechanical framework of the web.\n\nThis is the analog web.\n\nThere is no strict definition for the analog web, and it\u2019s not tied to a\nsingle methodology or technology. But there is a culture that exists beneath\nthe commercial web that is motivated by the same goal; to create a bulkwark\nagainst the erasure of a more human web.\n\nWe can find some definitions for the analog web in the early days of blogging.\nWriting about the then brief history of blogs in 2001, Rebecca Blood defined\nthem as \u201cfragments, pieced together over months [...], an unexpectedly\nintimate view of what it is to be a particular individual in a particular\nplace at a particular time.\u201d\n\nBut this \u201cintimate view\u201d goes well beyond blogs. As Ana Rodrigues recently put\nit, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be a content creator to have a website.\u201d A personal\nwebsite need only be personal and a website to fit the definition. Everything\nelse is additive. To attach yourself to the analog web requires some space on\na server and a bit of free time \u2014 and many have taken the time to do just\nthat.\n\nThese websites don\u2019t exist with any necessary agenda. They are handmade, and\nat times, even a bit weird. But they represent a person in some way; an\ninterest, an ideology, a hobby, or nothing more bold than a point of view.\nBecause they are distinct and imperfect, these sites can resist the wave of\ngenerated content heading our way. Not to mention, there is an actual joy to\ncreating sites on the analog web:\n\n> For me, the joy of personal websites lies in their distinctive viewpoints\n> and creativity.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with a quote from the late Dean Allen, who used his usual wit\nand voice to describe his own website. This is just an excerpt, and I\nencourage you to read the piece in full:\n\n> This site is made of PHP and MySQL, hyper-text markup, cascading stylesheets\n> and content. This site is ambitious: it has hopes and dreams arching far\n> beyond its current form. When it was younger this site exuded confidence;\n> now it commands a room [...].\n\n> [...] once this site was so drunk that, entering a club, the path to the\n> dance floor looked exactly like the rotating tunnel portal thing from the\n> Six Million Dollar Man. This site is terrible with money. While it has no\n> problem with actors, this site simply would rather not know one. Most\n> everything is funny, to this site.\n\nWhat you create on the web, in other words, can be whatever it is that you\nwant it to be. That is the analog web.\n\nPosted by:\n\nJay Hoffmann\n\nWeb Future\n\n\u00abPrevious Post\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n### About\n\nThis project is my decade-long journey through web history.
