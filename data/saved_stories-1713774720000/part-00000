Many described\nlosing coverage when they needed help the most.\n\nDebarchan Chatterjee/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nDebarchan Chatterjee/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nBy Varsha Bansal\n\n12 April 2024 \u2022 Bengaluru, India\n\nEspa\u00f1olPortugu\u00eas\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7b80\u4f53\u5b57)DeutschFran\u00e7ais\n\n  * Swiggy\u2019s weekly ranking system allows workers to access health insurance depending on the number of \u201cperfect\u201d deliveries they make.\n  * Delivery riders say they find the system convoluted and unfair.\n\nDelivery worker Rakesh was dropping off food orders in the southern Indian\ncity of Hyderabad in late January when he received a distressing call from his\nwife \u2014 she was in severe pain. Over the next three weeks, Rakesh had to drop\neverything to go to hospitals seeking a diagnosis for her.\n\nUntil then, Rakesh had been a \u201cgold\u201d level gig worker for Swiggy, India\u2019s\nsecond-largest food delivery app. He delivered at least 100 orders a week,\nover 14-hour shifts. The prestigious ranking made him and his family eligible\nfor company-sponsored health insurance, among other benefits. But by the time\na gynecologist recommended an urgent procedure \u2014 which cost 1,20,000 rupees\n($1,440) \u2014 for Rakesh\u2019s wife, she was no longer covered by Swiggy\u2019s insurance.\nHe had missed days of work while attending to her health, which caused his app\nranking to drop to silver, making his family ineligible for company benefits.\n\n\u201cI was so angry. I work day and night for Swiggy \u2014 shouldn\u2019t the company\nsupport my family as well?\u201d Rakesh, 38, told Rest of World, requesting to be\nidentified by a pseudonym for fear of reprisal from the company. \u201cI told them\nI have been with Swiggy for more than six years but they said they cannot do\nanything since it\u2019s company policy.\u201d\n\nRolled out in 2023, Swiggy\u2019s gold, silver, and bronze rankings for its gig\nworkforce are based on a dynamic rating system \u2014 it changes weekly depending\non the quality and quantity of work. Workers with a higher ranking get perks\nsuch as the ability to book the following week\u2019s shifts in advance and\n\u201cattractive interest rates\u201d on personal loans. The program also includes\nhealth insurance as a benefit, which can change every week.\n\n> \u201cThe whole point of insurance is to reduce insecurity by giving people a\n> safety net if something bad happens.\u201d\n\nGold-rated workers receive health insurance for themselves and their families;\nin the silver category, the family is ineligible for insurance. Bronze-rated\nworkers are only eligible for insurance coverage in case of accidents.\n\nWhile platforms have often used similar gamification tactics to incentivize\nworkers to work or earn more, including health insurance in such a program\ncould be detrimental not just to the workers but also their families, labor\nexperts told Rest of World.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of insurance is to reduce insecurity by giving people a\nsafety net if something bad happens,\u201d Alex Wood, a labor researcher with the\nOxford Internet Institute, told Rest of World. Instead, Swiggy\u2019s system is\n\u201cturning something that\u2019s meant to provide comfort into something that further\nincentivizes to drive productivity through gamification,\u201d he said.\n\nSwiggy declined to participate in the story.\n\nRest of World spoke to 40 Swiggy food delivery riders across Delhi, Mumbai,\nBengaluru, Hyderabad, and Jaipur \u2014 65% of whom said they found the dynamic\ninsurance feature to be unfair. More than half wanted Swiggy to go back to its\nold system, which had offered uniform and fixed insurance across the fleet.\nMany riders also said they found the system convoluted, and that their\ninsurance claims were fully or partially denied when they or their families\nneeded help the most.\n\nAmir, a Swiggy delivery rider from Hyderabad, told Rest of World he is\nconsidering buying insurance on his own because he can\u2019t depend on the\ncompany\u2019s system. Even if he doesn\u2019t miss a single day of work, his ranking\nmight still be affected as it depends on making \u201cperfect\u201d deliveries.\n\n\u201cWhen we do an order for Swiggy, it has to be a perfect delivery \u2014 without\ncalling the customer too much, or damaging the order and delivering on time,\u201d\nAmir said, speaking under a pseudonym for fear of retribution from the\ncompany. \u201cIf these conditions are met, it\u2019s a perfect order, giving me one\npoint.\u201d\n\nEvery week, delivery riders need to earn 70 points or more to maintain the\ncoveted gold ranking. Between 50 and 70 points drops them to the silver\ncategory, and under 50 points to bronze.\n\nHigher rankings on the platform unlock benefits for delivery riders.\n\nNearly 40% of the workers who spoke to Rest of World said they have had to put\nin an extra 1\u20132 hours per day to earn enough points to maintain their gold\nranking. Many work 15\u201316 hours a day.\n\n\u201cSometimes orders can\u2019t be delivered exactly on time due to traffic but if we\ndeliver the order late to the customer, the app puts it under a bad order,\u201d\nsaid Parvaiz, a Swiggy rider from Hyderabad, who is in the bronze category\nbecause he missed a few days of work. He spoke under a pseudonym as he feared\nretribution from Swiggy.\n\nSwiggy brought in the new health insurance plan in 2023, after it changed its\ncorporate insurance provider from Acko General Insurance to Reliance General\nInsurance, according to several Swiggy workers. The company\u2019s previous policy\nhad been uniform for all workers, they told Rest of World. \u201cEveryone who was\nregistered with Swiggy and would work regularly was able to file for insurance\nand would most likely get it,\u201d said Parvaiz. \u201cBut now, even if we work\nregularly, it depends on their conditions.\u201d The company had first launched\nhealth insurance for its riders in 2015, and claimed to have paid out $3.7\nmillion in insurance claims during the 2023 financial year.\n\nReliance General Insurance did not respond to Rest of World\u2019s request for\ncomment.\n\nIn October 2023, a Mumbai Swiggy delivery rider, who had worked with the\ncompany for seven years, filed an insurance claim worth 23,000 rupees ($275)\nfor his wife\u2019s maternity expenses. But, four months later, Reliance General\nInsurance denied the claim, citing that he was under the \u201csilver plan,\u201d\naccording to a letter reviewed by Rest of World.\n\nRest of World obtained a copy of a letter issued by Reliance General Insurance\nto a Swiggy delivery rider, denying their health-care claim. Personal\ninformation in the letter has been blurred to protect the delivery worker\u2019s\nprivacy.\n\nMost food delivery platforms around the globe offer accident covers to gig\nworkers, without any gamification. Deliveroo in the U.K. offers a range of\ninsurance options, including for accidents that have occured while riders are\nonline on the app, and \u201cup to one hour after\u201d they go offline. DoorDash in the\nU.S. offers accident insurance to its workers while they are in the \u201cdelivery\navailable\u201d or \u201cdelivery service\u201d period. Colombia\u2019s Rappi offers accident\ninsurance to all delivery riders, while Foodpanda in Pakistan offers insurance\nto \u201cactive\u201d riders. None of the apps offer any kind of insurance for gig\nworkers\u2019 families except Deliveroo, which provides a one-time payment for the\nworker when they have a new child.\n\nResearchers told Rest of World the dynamic insurance plan could be part of\nSwiggy\u2019s efforts to cut costs as it prepares for an initial public offering.\nThe company has already laid off part of its workforce and increased prices\nfor customers to cut corners and make more income. The 10-year-old company,\nlast valued at around $10.7 billion in January 2022, posted a loss of over\n$500 million during the 2023 financial year.\n\n\u201cSwiggy seems to be working towards an IPO with a lot of restructuring over\nthe last year with shifting cost structures including layoffs, while also\npausing on innovations,\u201d said Aditi Surie, a senior consultant with the Indian\nInstitute for Human Settlements, who studies digital labor platforms. \u201cI think\nthis move [towards gamification] would be the direction of profitability.\u201d\n\nSwiggy introduced its points-based categorization system to accurately\nevaluate riders\u2019 performance as almost 90% of customers did not bother rating\nthe order after it had been delivered, a former product manager at the company\ntold Rest of World. \u201cThe company needed to know what the customer experience\nwas with the delivery partner doing certain tasks,\u201d they said, requesting\nanonymity as they were not allowed to speak with the media. \u201cThis meant [the\nworker] should be able to find the restaurant quickly because we are providing\ninstructions, maps, phone numbers \u2014 not add on more time to delivery than\nnecessarily required.\u201d\n\n> \u201cIf they categorize us for earnings, that\u2019s fine, but they shouldn\u2019t be\n> playing this game with our health.\u201d\n\nIn India, Swiggy\u2019s competitor, Zomato, piloted health coverage in 2022 that\nextended to workers\u2019 families \u2014 a \u201cloyalty benefit\u201d for those who had been\nwith the platform for more than two years. Zomato also has a four-tiered\ncategorization for its delivery workers \u2014 blue, bronze, silver, and diamond \u2014\nwhich refreshes weekly and offers a set of benefits including priority\nsupport. The company\u2019s general medical insurance plan, however, is uniform for\nall workers, irrespective of their category.\n\nSwiggy riders, meanwhile, are struggling with a feeling of hopelessness.\n\n\u201cIf they categorize us for earnings, that\u2019s fine, but they shouldn\u2019t be\nplaying this game with our health,\u201d Sampat, a Swiggy worker from New Delhi,\ntold Rest of World. Sampat, who spoke under a pseudonym fearing retribution,\nhad met with an accident in October while rushing to deliver an order on time\nto maintain his gold ranking. He was able to file an insurance claim for his\naccident, but said he only received part of the claimed amount. Sampat said\nhis family doesn\u2019t want him to work for Swiggy anymore.\n\nRakesh, who was previously a farmer, is considering moving back to his village\non the outskirts of Hyderabad with his family. After Swiggy refused to pay for\nhis wife\u2019s medical procedure, Rakesh had to take a loan using her jewelry as\ncollateral, and borrow cash from his friends.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know why I am doing this [job.] The work stress is way too much\nwith low earnings and no family security,\u201d Rakesh said. \u201cIf I move back to my\nvillage, I may earn slightly less but I wouldn\u2019t have to work this hard.\u201d\n\nVarsha Bansal is an independent journalist based in Bengaluru.\n\nRead more stories\n\nCreator Economy\n\nIndonesia taps influencers to convince people to move to its new, under-\nconstruction capital\n\nSocial media stars are downplaying fears of deforestation and boredom in\nNusantara.\n\nBy Michelle Anindya\n\nThe Rise of AI\n\nAI \u201cdeathbots\u201d are helping people in China grieve\n\nAvatars of deceased relatives are increasingly popular for consoling those in\nmourning, or hiding the deaths of loved ones from children.\n\nBy Viola Zhou\n\nExporter Newsletter\n\nThe regional flavors of labor-on-demand\n\nA new report digs into the social dynamics of gig work.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\n  * About us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Platforms\n  * Newsletters\n  * Donate\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rest of World\n\n", "frontpage": false}
