Here is the\narticle recap digicame-info:\n\n  * Research firm GfK Japan announced on the 18th that the domestic digital camera market in 2023 will turn positive for the first time in 13 years. Sales volume was 1.2 million units, an increase of 7% from the previous year. This was driven by products such as interchangeable lens cameras. The decline had continued due to the spread of smartphones, but this appears to have come to a halt. The digital camera market had been in decline since peaking at 10.4 million units in 2010.\n  * Looking at unit sales in 2023 by type, interchangeable lens cameras increased by 9%, and compact cameras increased by 6%. Interchangeable lenses also grew by 4%.\n  * This is the second consecutive year of positive growth for interchangeable lens cameras. The number of products over 100,000 yen increased, and the proportion of products in the 100,000 to 200,000 yen price range was 46%, an increase of 7 points from the previous year. The average price (excluding tax) rose 4% from the previous year to 172,000 yen.\n\nRelated posts:\n\n  1. The latest financial results from Nikon, Ricoh, Fujifilm, Canon, and Tamron\n  2.
