It is\na skill that is useful to everybody no matter your profession or age.\nDeveloping and nurturing creativity is more important than ever and more and\nmore new researches show how creativity can positively influence all aspects\nof our lives.\n\nHere are 10 reasons why creativity is important\n\n## 1\\. Creativity helps you solve problems\n\nCreativity is one of the best tools, if not the best, to help you with\nproblem-solving. If your creativity skill is well trained, it will help you\nfind the solutions to the difficult and complex issues you\u2019re facing. If you\nalways find your way out of something, this also means that you\u2019re very\nflexible and have an easier time adapting to different situations. And since\ncreativity and the ability to find solutions also help you better and quickly\nrecover from difficult situations, in the long run it will also help you build\nresilience.\n\n## 2\\. Creativity is the skill of the future\n\nMore and more jobs are being automated and replaced by machines. So the\nquestion is, which jobs will remain for humans? Despite all the big\nadvancements of AI (artificial intelligence), for now humans still have the\nupper hand when it comes to coming up with novel and creative ideas and\nsolutions. AI is great at identifying the patterns within the data it has been\nfed, but it is not so great at anticipating changes of a pattern or making\nconnections to unrelated patterns, which are a key aspect of creativity. No\nmatter if or when AI will catch up, the creativity skill is a skill that will\nhelp you and be useful to you throughout your whole life.\n\n## 3\\. Creativity fuels positive emotions\n\nPositive affectivity indicates how much people experience positive emotions,\nsensations and sentiments. Turns out that if we engage in creative activities\nwe achieve a higher positive affectivity (PA) and this can lessen depressive\nsymptoms, and ultimately positively influence our mental health. So, if your\nday is fueled by positive emotions you will develop psychological resources\nsuch as optimism, tranquility and life satisfaction.\n\n## 4\\. Creativity makes you live longer\n\nThose who are creative are usually more open to new and different concepts,\nideas and feelings and have a higher imaginativeness and openness to new\nexperiences. Researchers have found that higher openness predicts a longer\nlife, and in specific it was creativity, and not overall openness or\nintelligence, that decreased the mortality risk. Therefore, creativity helps\nto protect our health and to maintain the integrity of our neural networks,\nand it can even be of help with dementia in older age.\n\n## 5\\. Creativity helps to reduce stress\n\nAnother great aspect of spending time doing a creative activity is that it can\nreduce your cortisol level, a hormone produced when you\u2019re stressed. Besides\nhelping you to reduce stress, engaging in creative activities also helps to\nreduce anxiety, as it enables us to fully immerse ourselves in the creative\ntask at hand and enter a state of creative flow which positively contributes\nto our mental health.\n\nTry Noisli Pro for free for one month!\n\nLimited offer!

Creativity increases self-esteem\n\nWhen you\u2019re creative you give yourself permission to create without being too\nharsh on yourself and without limiting the work you do. Creative people know\nthe importance of being free of judgement, whether from ourselves or from our\npeers, in order to come up with innovative and creative ideas. Creative people\nknow that at first, some ideas may sound foolish or impossible but that one\nthing might lead to something else. The more you develop your creative skill\nthe more you learn about yourself and to respect and trust your inner self and\nyour ideas, which in return will help to build up and grow your self-esteem.\n\n## 7\\. Creativity fuels your energy\n\nIn our brain we have a task-positive network, which is in action whenever we\nperform attention-demanding tasks, and also a default network, which is more\nactive when we\u2019re engaged in passive tasks such as self-generated thought,\nremembering and mind wandering. When we\u2019re engaging our brain in creative\nactivities we\u2019re engaging our default network and giving the task related\nnetwork a break. This helps us to refuel our energy for subsequent attention-\ndemanding tasks.\n\n## 8\\. Creativity creates value and drives profit\n\nCreativity is not only in high demand because it is a skill difficult to\nreplace, but also because it is one of the main factors that create valuable\nbusinesses. In fact, more and more businesses shift their focus on fostering\ncreativity rather than efficiency and cost-saving solutions, as creativity\ndrives business innovation and growth and ultimately value and profit.\n\n## 9\\. Creativity lets you see opportunities\n\nWhen your creativity is well trained, you\u2019re used to connecting the dots\nbetween different ideas and concepts. In order to do this, you need to be open\nand receptive and always on the lookout for possibilities and \u201cwhat ifs\u201d. This\nmakes you not only a good observer, but it also lets you spot and exploit\nexisting and possible opportunities which others might easily overlook.\n\n## 10\\. Creativity drives innovation\n\nIf we advanced as a society it is in big part also thanks to the creativity\nthat constantly led us to innovate and make our lives easier and better.\nCreativity is the ability to use imagination and think outside traditional\nways so to create something new. Innovation is putting that in practice. If we\nadvanced as a society it is in big part also thanks to the creativity that\nconstantly led us to innovate and make our lives easier and better.\n\nWritten by Sabine Staggl\n\nNoisli for your business\n\nWe offer businesses a free 3-month trial of our Business plan so that you can\nexperience the full benefits of Noisli with your team!\n\nApply here\n\n#### You may also like\n\n  * What is flow and how do you get into a flow state\n\n  * Working Better: Interview with product designer Femke van Schoonhoven\n\n  * Working Better: Interview with web designer Brad Frost\n\n  * Bruno Munari\u2019s design methodology \u2013 from problem to solution\n\n\u00a9 2024 Noisli Terms & Privacy Impressum\n\n", "frontpage": false}
