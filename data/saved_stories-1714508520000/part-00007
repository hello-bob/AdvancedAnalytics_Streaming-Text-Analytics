In\nboth instances, the vehicles had BlueCruise activated and hit stationary cars\nat night, fatally injuring passengers in the other vehicles. Now, the NHTSA's\nOffice of Defects Investigation (ODI) has opened a wider investigation into\nall 130,050 BlueCruise-equipped Mustang Mach-Es built to date.\n\n\"ODI has opened this Preliminary Evaluation to investigate the Ford BlueCruise\nsystem equipped on the subject vehicles. This investigation will evaluate the\nsystem\u2019s performance of the dynamic driving task and driver monitoring,\" said\nthe NHTSA.\n\nBlueCruise is Ford's hands-free, semi-autonomous driver assistance system. It\nonly works on preselected highways, and only when certain driving conditions\nare met. It's important to note that Ford does not market BlueCruise as a\nself-driving nor fully autonomous system, but as a driver aid and clearly\nstates that the driver must be alert at all times when using it. Despite that,\nthe system should of course read stationary cars, even at night, and at least\nalert the driver. However, BlueCruise isn't the only Mustang Mach-E technology\nbeing investigated, as it isn't the only safety fail-safe that should have\nprevented the crash.\n\nFord\n\nWith Ford's Co-Pilot 360 Assist 2.0 system, the Mustang Mach-E has forward\ncollision warnings, automatic emergency braking (which, unfortunately, doesn't\nseem to be as reliable as carmakers would like you to believe), and even an\nevasive steering assist designed to help the driver swerve out of harm's way.\nSomehow, all of these systems failed to prevent the two crashes that sparked\nthe feds' investigation. Since both incidents had very similar\ncircumstances\u2014low-light, nighttime conditions and stationary cars\u2014there may a\nspecific issue that the feds can find, and that Ford can fix.\n\nAccording to the NHTSA, there are only two known crashes with BlueCruise\nengaged currently being investigated, both of which caused a total of three\nfatalities.\n\nThe Drive reached out to Ford for a comment and will update this story when we\nreceive more information.\n\nGot tips?
