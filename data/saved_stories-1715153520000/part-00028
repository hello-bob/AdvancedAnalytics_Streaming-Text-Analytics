Credit: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n\nOn an October morning in 2023, a chemical explosion detonated in a tunnel\nunder the Nevada desert was the launch of the next set of experiments by the\nNational Nuclear Security Administration, with the goal to improve detection\nof low-yield nuclear explosions around the world.\n\nPhysics Experiment 1-A (PE1-A) is the first in a series of non-nuclear\nexperiments that will compare computer simulations with high-resolution\nseismic, tracer gas, acoustic and electromagnetic data gleaned from\nunderground explosions and atmospheric experiments, said Lawrence Livermore\nNational Laboratory researcher Stephen Myers at the Seismological Society of\nAmerica (SSA)'s 2024 Annual Meeting.\n\nThe 18 October explosion\u2014the equivalent of 16.3 tons of TNT\u2014took place in\nAqueduct Mesa \"P Tunnel\" at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). Seismic,\nacoustic and electromagnetic waves from the shock were recorded by instruments\nnear the explosion and with regional seismic networks, while gas tracers and\nchemical byproducts released into the resulting cavity and boreholes also were\nsampled by a dense instrument array. Seismic signals were recorded at least\n250 kilometers away from the explosion.\n\n\"All of this is to help further our goal of monitoring nuclear explosions\nbetter and understanding the source physics of how those explosions generate\nseismic waves,\" Myers said.\n\nPhysics Experiment 1 (PE1) is the latest research program at NNSS, where\natmospheric nuclear tests took place between 1951 and 1962, and underground\ntesting occurred between 1961 and 1992. More recently, programs like the\nSource Physics Experiment looked at a range of non-nuclear chemical explosions\nin different rock environments, collecting data to learn more about explosion\nphysics.\n\nThe seven new experiments planned as part of PE1 include more underground\nchemical explosions under different emplacement conditions, as well as\natmospheric experiments that attempt to track underground and atmospheric\ntransport of gases produced in these types of explosions.\n\nThe program will also use a large electromagnetic coil, about four meters\nwide, to generate pulses of electromagnetic energy inside the tunnel that can\nbe measured at the ground surface, to determine how much of the\nelectromagnetic signal from an underground nuclear test would be affected by\ntraveling through the earth.\n\n\"There's no one experiment that can generate all the signals that are produced\nby a nuclear shot, so we're doing this series of seven to try to piece\ntogether all of those signals,\" Myers explained, \"so that we can validate our\nfull physics codes that we use to simulate what all of those signals would be\nlike from a nuclear explosion.\"\n\nSignificant improvements in high-performance computing have allowed\nresearchers like Myers to create increasingly realistic and complex explosion\nsimulations, but \"then the question is, 'are they correct?' And the only way\nwe can be confident about that is to compare them to these high-resolution\ndata sets from the experiments,\" he said.\n\nThe new experiments are more heavily instrumented than older NNSS experiments,\nhe noted, which helps to validate the computer code simulations.\n\nAtmospheric simulations, for example, must account for complex variables such\nas temperature changes and air turbulence under different topographic\nconditions.\n\nWith the experiments, Myers said, \"We're trying to get an idea if tracers came\nout of the ground after a nuclear test, exactly what some of these very local\nconditions, topography and other aspects, would affect the transport of those\nradionuclides and other telltale gases that could be released by an\nunderground test.\"\n\nMyers said the seismic and acoustic data from PE1 will be released to a public\nseismic database after two years. \"We want this to be a resource for the\ncommunity as a whole.\"\n\nProvided by Seismological Society of America\n\nCitation: New Nevada experiments aim to improve monitoring of nuclear\nexplosions (2024, May 3) retrieved 7 May 2024 from\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-05-nevada-aim-nuclear-explosions.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
