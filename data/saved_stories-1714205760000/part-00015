It was invented by Artur\nFischer and is produced by fischertechnik GmbH in Waldachtal, Germany. Fans\noften refer to Fischertechnik as \"FT\" or \"ft\".^[2] It is used in education for\nteaching about simple machines, as well as motorization and mechanisms.^[3]\nThe company also offers computer interface technology, which can be used to\nteach the theory of automation and robotics.\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\nThe company is a German manufacturer of fasteners, and the original\nFischertechnik set was intended as a Christmas (1964) novelty gift for\nengineers and buyers at industrial clients. The gifts proved popular, so for\nChristmas 1965, the company introduced its first building set for retail sale\nin Germany. In part, it has been claimed to foster education and interest in\ntechnology and science among the young. By about 1970, the construction sets\nwere being sold in the United States at upscale toy retailers such as FAO\nSchwarz.\n\n## Building blocks[edit]\n\nThe basic building blocks were of channel-and-groove design, manufactured of\nhard nylon. Basic blocks came in 15\u00d715\u00d715 and 15\u00d715\u00d730 millimeter sizes. A peg\non one side of each block could be attached into a channel on any of the other\nfive sides of a similar block, producing a tightly-fitting assembly that could\nassume almost any shape. Red cladding plates could be used to complete the\nexterior surfaces of the models.\n\n## Accessories[edit]\n\nThe original blocks were characteristically gray with red accessories such as\nwheels and angled blocks. Electric motors, power sources, and gears were soon\nadded to mobilize models. Additional building pieces such as struts were added\nin \u201cstatics\u201d sets, allowing the construction of realistic-looking bridges and\ntower cranes. A few Fischertechnik girders actually are made of aluminum.^[4]\nAt least one company made Fischertechnik-compatible aluminum bars of any\ndesired length.^[5] To teach the physics of such models, some sets included\nmeasuring devices, so that trigonometric vectors could be calculated and\ntested.\n\n## Electrical and electronic components[edit]\n\nThe early sets were sophisticated and were often used by engineers to teach\nand simulate industrial robotics. This use was advanced by the addition of\nelectrical and electronic components such as microswitches, magnetic-sensing\nreed switches, and photocells, which sensed position and provided input to\nmotors. With the basic electronic block (Grundbaustein), which contained an\noperational amplifier, Schmitt trigger and delay line circuits could be built.\nIn the late 1970s, electronic binary-logic modules (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, flip-\nflops) were introduced, so that models could make some branching decisions.\nPneumatic devices were made available to provide gripping ability. By the late\n1980s, process control CPU modules were added, so that sequences movements\ncould be preprogrammed and executed, first using \u201cLucky Logic\u201d (LLWIN)\nsoftware.\n\n## Kits for younger ages[edit]\n\nAs Lego became more sophisticated with its Mindstorms line, Fischertechnik\nattempted to move down into less technical, more \u201cfun\u201d, building kits for\nyounger ages. The parts were molded from more colorful plastics, and small\nbuilding sets were developed for simple models such as vehicles. However, the\nFischer products were more expensive and had far fewer parts that replicated\neveryday objects than Lego. Especially in the United States, Fischertechnik\nnever achieved parity with Lego in the general construction toy market, and FT\nis still more positioned as a product for schools, engineers, and hobbyists.\nThe sets are not as available at retail as Lego products in the United States,\nor even in Europe.\n\n## Robotic process control[edit]\n\nFischertechnik computing with a Commodore 64 interface\n\nBy 2006, Fischertechnik sets were available for robotic process control using\n\u201cRobo-pro\u201d software (the successor to Lucky-logic), on-board process\ncontrollers with flash memory, infrared and radio-frequency remote control,\nand pneumatic-activation. Robotic models could follow preprogrammed routes or\nlines on the floor, sense obstructions and change course, detect and move\nobjects, and simulate everyday devices such as vending machines, passenger\nelevator systems, and traffic-control lights. In early 2010, Fischertechnik\nintroduced the ROBO TX Explorer kit, which includes a color sensor.\nhttps://www.fischertechnik.de/en/service/elearning/playing/txt-explorer^[6]\n\n## Sets[edit]\n\nFischertechnik has produced myriad different sets over the years, and the\ncompany has several times renamed existing sets. Moreover, there have been as\nmany as five different lines of these sets (often referred to as \"A\", \"B\",\n\"C\", \"D\", and \"E\" in fan circles) with similar but differing components (all\ncompatible, of course). Roughly these fit into the production years 1967\u20131971,\n1972\u20131975, 1976\u20131981, 1981\u20131984 and 1984\u20131991. The A line featured\npredominantly black-and-white images, whereas the \"B\" line features the \"Oscar\nDuJouet 1970\" award on the box design. \"C\" saw the introduction of black\nplastic cogs (earlier they were all red), and \"D\" saw the introduction of\nyellow plastic \"statics\" (whereas before they were grey).\n\nThe following equivalencies can help make sense of some of the core sets:\n\n  * Start 300 = Start 200 + 50/3 = Start 100 + 50/2 + 50/3 = Start 50 + 50/1 + 50/2 + 50/3\n  * Hobby 1 = UT1 = selected parts from Start 300 (but significantly abbreviated)\n  * Hobby 2 = UT2 = Mot1 + Mot2 + Mot3 (The Hobby 2 / UT2 lacks the battery box that comes with Mot1.)\n  * Hobby 3 = UT3 = EM1 + EM2 + EM3 (The \"EM\" stands for \"Electro-Mechanical\".)\n  * Hobby 4 = UT4 = EC1 + EC2 + EC3 (The \"EC\" stands for \"Electronic\".)\n  * Hobby S = Start 50S + 50S/1 + 50S/2 + 50S/3 (Note that those are \"S\" = \"structural\", not a \"5\".)\n\nNote that prior to the Fischertechnik \"C\" line (1976?), the starter sets\ndidn't have as many parts, and neither did their add-on kits (50/1, 50/2,\n50/3). Because the older manuals lack copyright dates or official line\ndesignations, it is difficult to distinguish sets without in-depth knowledge\nof what was actually in the box for each line and set.\n\nMore recently, Fischertechnik has started producing a whole line of kits\nspecialized for the construction of particular models, like boats, airplanes,\nbridges, cranes, etc. This is something of a departure from their traditional\nniche producing generic sets from which (literally) hundreds of different\nmodels can be built. Fischertechnik has also started producing advanced\nrobotic sets, including battery packs, remote controls, and programmable\ncontrol boards.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Lego Technic\n  * NORBIT\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"fischertechnik PROFI Da Vinci Machines\".
