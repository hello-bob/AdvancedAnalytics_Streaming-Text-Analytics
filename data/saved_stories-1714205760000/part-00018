(AP Photo/George Walker IV)\n\nBy CORA LEWIS\n\nUpdated 9:33 PM UTC, April 25, 2024\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n\nLink copied\n\n  * Email\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * X\n\n  * Reddit\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Flipboard\n\n  * Print\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When Anna Branch, 37, had her hours at work reduced in 2019,\nshe suddenly noticed ads for an app called EarnIn.\n\n\u201cYou know how they get you \u2014 the algorithms \u2014 like they\u2019re reading your mind,\u201d\nBranch said. \u201cThe ad said I could get up to $100 this week and repay it in my\nnext pay period.\u201d\n\nBranch, who was working as an administrative assistant in Charleston, South\nCarolina, downloaded the app and added the suggested \u201ctip.\u201d The cash helped\nher cover expenses until payday, when the app debited the borrowed $100, plus\n$14 for tip. Five years later, Branch said she still uses the app, as often as\nonce a month.\n\nEarnIn is one of more than a dozen companies that provide this service, billed\nas Earned Wage Access. The apps extend small short-term loans to workers in\nbetween paychecks so they can pay bills and meet everyday needs. On payday,\nthe user repays the money out of their wages. Between 2018 and 2020,\ntransaction volume tripled from $3.2 billion to $9.5 billion, according to\nDatos Insights.\n\nWhile Earned Wage Access apps have been around for over a decade, the pandemic\nand its aftermath boosted their popularity. Some apps have approachable human\nnames \u2014 like Dave, Clio, Albert, and Brigit \u2014 while others suggest financial\nfreedom: Empower, FloatMe, FlexWage, Rain. The typical user earns less than\n$50,000 a year, according to the Government Accountability Office, and has\nexperienced the pinch of two years of high inflation.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nGerman retirees will get an inflation-busting pension increase this year\n\nTrump called this visa \u2018very bad\u2019 for Americans. Truth Social applied for one\n\nDelta Air Lines, facing another union attempt to organize flight attendants,\nis raising their pay\n\nProponents of the apps say they help people living paycheck to paycheck manage\ntheir finances and avoid the need for more onerous options, such as payday\nloans or overdrawing a bank account. But some analysts, consumer advocates and\nlawmakers say the apps are actually payday loans in a new tech wrapper, and\nthat they can trap users in an endless cycle of borrowing that depletes their\nearnings.\n\nCritics also say the costs of the loans are not always transparent. Many\ncharge monthly subscription fees and most charge mandatory fees for instant\ntransfers of funds, though there is typically a no-cost option to receive\nfunds in one to three business days. The average APR for a loan repaid in\nseven to 14 days was 367%, a rate comparable to payday lending, according to a\nreport from the Center for Responsible Lending.\n\nMuddying the waters is the fact that some employers have integrated Earned\nWage Access apps into their payroll, with different costs, models, and fee\nstructures. Amazon and Walmart, for example, do not always charge employees\nfor early access to earned wages outside of regular pay periods.\n\n## \u201cTHEY GET YOU HOOKED\u201d\n\nSheri Wilkins, 60, who works as a home health aide in College Station, Texas,\nsaid she\u2019s used the apps since 2020, and that she feels \u201cdependent on the\nmoney.\u201d\n\nThe health care contractor that employs Wilkins offers DailyPay, and Wilkins\ntypically uses the app to transfer the amount of that day\u2019s wages ($10.60 an\nhour) twice a day \u2014 once after each of her two shifts, for which she\u2019s paid\nseparately. Each time, she pays a $3.49 fee, for a total of $7 a day. At $35 a\nweek, the app eats up more than three hours of her pay weekly, or a-day-and-a-\nhalf\u2019s work per month.\n\n\u201cThey get you hooked on having that money,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine and great\nto have it \u2014 to buy groceries and cigarettes \u2014 but when it comes time to have\nyour paycheck, it\u2019s only $50-$60.\u201d\n\nWilkins said she was not aware the app had a free option, which would transfer\nthe money in one to three days. She said the app always directed her to the\ninstant transfer option.\n\nA spokesperson for DailyPay said in a statement that the app offers two\noptions with no fees to most users and a third with what they described as a\n\u201csmall ATM-like fee.\u201d\n\nMatt Bahl, who researches workplace issues for the Financial Health Network,\nsaid the growth of the Earned Wage Access industry is a symptom of widespread\nfinancial insecurity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s meant to help solve short-term liquidity challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if\nthose challenges are the result of insufficient income, it won\u2019t solve them.\nYou can\u2019t \u2018tech\u2019 your way out of material deficits.\u201d\n\n## THE TIPS\n\nAndrew Lewis, 32, who lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, said he uses\nEarnIn, in part to meet unexpected expenses. Lewis works as a process\ntechnician for an electronics manufacturing company, and said he sometimes\nuses the app as often as every week, for gas money or something his toddler or\nwife needs.\n\nLewis usually pays the \u201ctips\u201d the apps suggest, he said, but he doesn\u2019t \u201clike\nthem that much,\u201d in part because of the messaging.\n\n\u201cTips keep us running for millions of members like you,\u201d EarnIn\u2019s in-app copy\nreads. The company says it uses tips to maintain a no-fee option.\n\n\u201cI feel a little guilty because of how they make it sound,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nIn 2021, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation\nfound \u201cusers often feel compelled to leave (tips) due to applied pressure\ntactics like... claiming tips are used to support other vulnerable consumers\nor for charitable purposes.\u201d\n\nIn its report, the department found that borrowers who use Earned Wage Access\ntake out an average of 36 loans a year. On 5.8 million transactions, 73% of\nconsumers paid a \u201ctip,\u201d at $4.09 per tip on average. On three dozen loans,\nthat\u2019s $147 annually in tips alone.\n\n## CONVENIENCE AND NO CREDIT CHECK\n\nPenny Lee, head of the Financial Technology Association, an industry group,\nsays more people are turning to Earned Wage Access as a convenience that\nallows them to make up for the \u201cdisconnect between what the consumer needs to\nbe able to spend ... and their pay cycle.\u201d\n\nLike Buy Now, Pay Later loans, the apps don\u2019t run credit checks and bill\nthemselves as interest-free. Unlike payday loans or auto title loans, where\nborrowers pledge their vehicles as collateral, users of the apps don\u2019t face\nballoon payments, black marks on their credit reports, or the possibility of\nlosing their car if they fail to pay. Supporters also say the apps don\u2019t sue\nor send collectors after unpaid debts.\n\nThe FTA says the average cost per use of an Earned Wage Access app is between\n$2.59 and $6.27. The companies say the charges are comparable to ATM fees and\ncheaper than overdraft fees, which people incur if they don\u2019t have enough\nmoney left in a checking account to cover a bill before payday. The average\noverdraft fee is more than $25 and can be as high as $36.\n\nHowever, in its report, the Center for Responsible Lending found that users of\nthe apps experienced a 56% increase in checking account overdrafts.\n\n## A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR REGULATION\n\nA number of states have moved to regulate Earned Wage Access by capping fees\non these products. The industry backs a federal bill, currently before\nCongress, that would exclude the apps from being regulated by the Truth in\nLending Act.\n\nWhen Connecticut passed a law capping the fees the apps could charge, EarnIn\nstopped operating in the state. Asked why, EarnIn CEO Ram Palaniappan said it\nwas no longer \u201ceconomically viable.\u201d\n\nBoth California and Hawaii are currently drafting laws to rein in Earned Wage\nAccess fees.\n\nRep. Bryan Steil, R-WI, one of the federal bill\u2019s backers said, it will\n\u201censure workers across the country can continue to use these services, which\nhelp them to better connect work to reward.\u201d\n\nBut Hawaii State Sen. Chris Lee, a Democrat who introduced regulation\ntargeting Earned Wage Access in the state Senate, called the 300-plus\npercentage interest rates a \u201cmodern payday loan scheme.\u201d Lee said he would\nlike to see more transparency and worker protections.\n\nLauren Saunders, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, says this a\npivotal moment for regulation.\n\n\u201cIf (Earned Wage Access) were being used by people to cover one emergency cost\na year, it could be better than being subject to overdraft fees or payday or\nauto title loans,\u201d she said. \u201cBut being better than terrible predatory\nproducts shouldn\u2019t be the bar.\u201d\n\n## ___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for\neducational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.
