Retail jobs helped her save enough money for an apartment, and\nshe eventually became a manager at Family Dollar. She enrolled in college and\nmaintained straight A's \u2014 for a while.\n\nBut Destiny, who asked to go by only her first name for fear of personal and\nprofessional repercussions, began to suffer from overwork while having\nmultiple jobs during the pandemic, and her mental health faltered.\n\n\"I feel for those who are in my shoes and don't have a connection or a home\nbase,\" said Destiny, who now lives in a small apartment in Alabama with her\nboyfriend. \"You think you're alone, but there are so many of us who are in\nthis situation. We're hopeless, feel like a failure, and we want to get it\ntogether. We just need better resources and time.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually, Destiny dropped out of college and quit her job. She's struggled\nto get medication for her OCD and find stable employment beyond part-time gig\nwork. She knows she's not alone in feeling stuck when it comes to investing in\neducation or finding the right job.\n\n\"When I was a general manager, when I would hire people, I was hiring people\nwho had master's\" degrees, Destiny said. \"They just couldn't find a job that\nused that degree or jobs they just weren't qualified enough for with their\nexperience. I think a degree now is just pretty much a baseline education for\nmost people with jobs.\"\n\nA growing group of America's young people are not in school, not working, or\nnot looking for work. They're called \"disconnected youth\" or \"opportunity\nyouth,\" and their ranks have been growing for nearly three decades. Experts\nsay it's not just work and school; this group is often also disconnected from\na sense of purpose.\n\nIt's creating a tale of two Gen Zs: those who have followed traditional\nmilestones and others who are increasingly getting left behind. These aren't\nall young people taking gap years \u2014 the disconnected youth Business Insider\nspoke with want education and good jobs but are partly victims of economic\ncircumstances outside their control. And that might cost them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 'A long shadow across the whole life course'\n\nData from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas indicates the share of\ndisconnected 18- to 24-year-olds has been on the rise since the 1990s. While\nit fell a bit in the 2010s, it spiked in the 2020s. In 2022, 13.2% of people\nin that age group were considered disconnected.\n\nMeasure of America, which looks at 16- to 24-year-olds who aren't in school\nand aren't working, found that nearly 4.7 million young people were\ndisconnected in 2021.\n\nKristen Lewis, the director and cofounder of Measure of America, part of the\nSocial Science Research Council, described ages 16 to 24 as consequential.\n\n\"Being disconnected from 16 to 24 can really cast a long shadow across the\nwhole life course,\" Lewis said. It can even hurt someone's future earnings and\nlikelihood of owning a house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust look at the wage progression as young people pick up degrees.\n\nUsing 2022 American Community Survey microdata from the University of\nMinnesota's IPUMS program, Business Insider found that 18- to 24-year-old\nAmericans who were working earned a median income of $19,200.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics found that among 25- to 34-year-\nolds working full time in 2021, those who hadn't completed high school earned\na median of $32,500, while those who had completed high school had a median\nincome of $39,700. For those with a bachelor's degree, that jumped to $61,600.\n\n\"When kids become disconnected from school and work, there's just a downward\nspiral that is too often going to result,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, who's introduced\nlegislation to help at-risk youths find jobs and receive job training, told\nBI. \"Some people can figure their way out of that spiral, but many cannot.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph, 21, is in that life stage. He said that while he doesn't want to be\ndisconnected, mental-health challenges and a lack of a financial safety net or\nhealth insurance had left him in a lurch.\n\nHe said he grew up \"very poor\" in a trailer park in Indiana with his parents\nand three siblings. He excelled in high school and got a full scholarship to a\nfour-year college. But after a year of remote learning, he struggled to keep\nup with schoolwork and often missed classes; he dropped out as he worked on\nimproving his mental health. He said he regretted not being able to find a way\nto stay enrolled.\n\n\"I lost my scholarship, and I want to go back to college now and have a much\nbetter relationship with the concept and know myself and my needs better,\" he\nsaid. \"But I can no longer afford it without the scholarship.\"\n\nJoseph has been unemployed since October after struggling to hold down jobs at\na warehouse, a summer camp, and a Walmart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite having trouble finding a doctor to help him receive work\naccommodations for his disability, he's applied to various jobs, including\nsubstitute teaching and working in a kitchen, but he hasn't heard back from\nany. He's starting an online needlepoint-patch business to bring in extra\nincome as he looks for his next job. He said he felt alone.\n\n\"I'd like to live in my own place, learn to drive so that I'm not dependent on\nmy parents for transportation, and have a job that doesn't cause me more pain\nthan I'm already in,\" he said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThis has contributed to feelings of severe anxiety and distress; he said he'd\ncontemplated suicide. He's hoping to finally get evaluated for ADHD and autism\nspectrum disorder after months of having no health insurance.\n\nAshley Palmer, an assistant professor of social work at Texas Christian\nUniversity who has written papers on this cohort, said disconnected youth fall\nalong a spectrum of connectedness to work and school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I don't think that simply being in school or working means that you're doing\nOK or that you're going to have improved well-being,\" Palmer said.\n\nShe said that while there's a lack of research in predicting the long-term\nsocial and psychological effects of disconnectedness, she suspects a lack of\npurpose can erode mental and physical health and relationships with friends\nand community.\n\n\"When you lack that purpose, it is difficult for you to think about how or in\nwhat ways you want to contribute or can contribute to society,\" Palmer said.\n\"Our society is a relational one where we depend on people to be able to\ncontribute in various ways.\"\n\nLewis, the researcher, said that \"youth disconnection is not a spontaneously\noccurring phenomenon.\" Areas with high poverty rates and fewer community\nresources tend to have higher disconnection rates. Palmer added that those\nwith limited access to transportation, people with disabilities, and young\nparents were also more susceptible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn more affluent areas, Lewis said, \"people are experiencing good health,\naccess to knowledge, a decent standard of living \u2014 disconnection is rare in\nthose communities.\"\n\n\"If you think about middle-class kids, they don't get just a chance or one\nsecond chance, they get a million chances,\" Lewis said. \"They're in\ninstitutions where they can try and they can fail and they're protected to\nsome degree from the consequences, and they can mess up and people can help\nthem. Disconnected young people don't have that luxury.\"\n\n## Parents of disconnected youth are at a 'total loss'\n\nSarah Nunley, a Gen X parent of two disconnected youths in Silicon Valley,\nsaid kids in her area are often pressured to focus on academics and attend\ncollege.\n\nBut Nunley said she noticed a \"dramatic shift\" after the remote-school era of\nthe pandemic, as her own kids dropped out of college.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The top priority became this YOLO environment, or mentality that you only\nlive once, where it was more important to spend time with friends and go on\nadventures, and education became secondary to that,\" Nunley said.\n\nVeronica, a 43-year-old parent in Texas, recently watched one of her kids\nbecome disconnected. She thinks he became burned out after working\nrelentlessly in retail during the pandemic and still not getting promoted.\n\n\"He was going full throttle,\" Veronica said. \"I mean, my husband and I would\nmake comments when we saw him coming downstairs in his work uniform, be like,\n'You're going to work again?'\"\n\nNunley said she was at a \"total loss\" about what she and her fellow parents\ncould do to improve things. But she has hope that disconnected youths will\ncome around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Everybody cares. There's not a single person that doesn't care about what's\ngoing on or doesn't have an opinion about what's going on,\" Nunley said. \"So\nfrom that perspective, I think that there is a lot of hope that they will\neventually figure it out. But I don't have any ideas of how they will figure\nit out.\"\n\nDC Lucchesi, a Gen X dad of three, said that while parents want to give their\nkids the tools to do better, so much has changed about the path to success\nsince parents were that age.\n\n\"Generationally speaking, the parents of this 'disaffected youth,' they're all\nmy age,\" he said. \"What we grew up learning or hearing or being told was you\nget a damn college degree and that's going to be your springboard to success.\nAnd somewhere along that space, the success of that safety net disappeared.\"\n\nInstead, Lucchesi said, parents need to learn to be OK with telling their kids\nthat they don't have to pursue an Ivy League degree or attend an elite school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's OK to be doing something else that brings you joy and puts a check in\nthe bank for you,\" he said.\n\nBut the pressure to help isn't only on parents. Palmer, the social-work\nprofessor, argued that policymakers interested in fixing the problem could\nimplement programs like guaranteed income for disconnected youth, expanded\nsocial safety net initiatives like Medicaid, and universal preschool and\nchildcare.\n\n\"The things that worry me are that we are not adequately addressing a growing\nmental-health crisis, and we are missing people with our social safety net \u2014\nthe lack of holistic supports for young people, things like not just making\nsure that they're enrolled or trying to get them placed in a job, but are\nthere livable wages even with a college degree?\" Palmer said.\n\nDestiny aspires to attend law school, though her immediate goal is to find a\nstable job that comfortably pays her bills. She hasn't even begun to think\nabout retirement or a mortgage. She's considering buying an RV and traveling\naround to save money on an apartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think the mental-health crisis has always been a big deal but just swept\nunder rugs,\" Destiny said. \"The only reason there's a true surge in mental-\nhealth crises now is because the newer generations are more outspoken about\nit. Trauma cycles get bigger with every new generation you introduce. I think\nit has finally hit its breaking point.\"\n\nAre you or were you a \"disconnected youth,\" or are you supporting one?
