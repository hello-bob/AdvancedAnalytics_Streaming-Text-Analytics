The official\nreceiver repayments and current level of Cabinet Office funding for the\nUKCloud liquidations is \u00a317.5 million (\u00a320 million day 1 funding less \u00a32.5\nmillion repayment to the Cabinet Office),\" she said in a letter to the Public\nAdministration and Constitutional Affairs Committee.\n\nShe added that, to date, there had been no known claims against the Cabinet\nOffice indemnity.\n\nWinding up the business seems to be taking longer than expected. In a written\nstatement in May 2023, Jeremy Quinn, minister for the Cabinet Office, said the\nliquidation would conclude in the first half of 2024.\n\nIn October 2022, UKCloud and its parent Virtual Infrastructure Group were\nforced into liquidation, potentially affecting clients including central and\nlocal government, the police, the Ministry of Defence, the NHS, Genomics\nEngland, and the University of Manchester.\n\nUKCloud was the only local provider to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with\nthe British government to provide agreed discounts to public sector buyers.\nThe others included Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and HPE.\n\nElsewhere in her response, the official insisted that a project to build a\ndatabase needed for the government's \u00a3158 billion ($190 billion) property\nportfolio had not been \"abandoned.\"\n\n\"The IT project has not been abandoned, although a previous supplier's\ncontract was terminated due to their non-performance,\" she said.\n\nThe Office of Government Property (OGP) \u2013 part of the Cabinet Office \u2013 signed\na contract with Landmark Information Group in October 2020 to build a new\nproperty database called InSite. However, \"due to non-completion the contract\nwas terminated in July 2022,\" she told MPs.\n\nApparently, there were \"multiple attempts to secure improved performance from\nthe supplier.\"\n\nAt the point of termination, the supplier had built an estimated 60 percent of\nthe database, she said.\n\n  * UK govt office admits ability to negotiate billions in cloud spending curbed by vendor lock-in\n  * UK government sets sights on \u00a38B tech procurement overhaul\n  * Multiple billions up for grabs as UK government launches cloud services tenders\n  * UK Cabinet Office hits pause on \u00a39M Microsoft deal\n\nAs part of the termination, the supplier reimbursed \u00a3300,000 to the Cabinet\nOffice for \"the cost of re-procurement and inconvenience, transferred work\ncompleted to date, transferred a number of software licences and provided a\nservice to assist a new contractor.\"\n\nThe net total cost paid by OGP to the supplier was \u00a3585,000 on a contract\nsigned for \u00a31.3 million.\n\nIt will come as an embarrassment that the project is not yet complete as it is\n18 months since the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the government had\nfailed to get a grip on the management of its \u00a3158 billion ($190 billion)\nproperty portfolio because of a failure to replace an aging database.\n\nThe public spending watchdog said that in 2018, Cabinet Office announced\nInSite as its replacement. \"The Cabinet Office told us that it considered\ncommercially available systems in 2018 but believed off-the-shelf options, at\nthe time, were not capable of receiving data from 160 different bodies across\ngovernment,\" a PAC report said in December 2022.\n\nBut the bespoke system soon hit trouble in its development. Citing staffing\nproblems, Landmark Solutions did not complete the InSite project, even when\ngranted an extension.\n\nIn her missive, Little said \"a robust lessons learnt exercise\" had been\ncarried out. \"This identified a number of required improvements including the\nneed for in-house technology expertise,\" she said.\n\nFollowing this exercise, she said OGP procured a commercial off-the-shelf\ntechnology solution from Planon in June 2023, around five years after the\nproject kicked off. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Government\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Procurement\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Government\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Procurement\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Cabinet Office\n  * Competition and Markets Authority\n  * Computer Misuse Act\n  * DCMS\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * GCHQ\n  * HMRC\n  * Home Office\n  * ICO\n  * Insider Trading\n  * NCSC\n  * NHS\n  * RPA\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Sector\n  * United Kingdom\n\n#### More about\n\n9 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Government\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Procurement\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Government\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Procurement\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Cabinet Office\n  * Competition and Markets Authority\n  * Computer Misuse Act\n  * DCMS\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * GCHQ\n  * HMRC\n  * Home Office\n  * ICO\n  * Insider Trading\n  * NCSC\n  * NHS\n  * RPA\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Sector\n  * United Kingdom\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### UK government sets sights on \u00a38B tech procurement overhaul\n\nMega framework set to replace earlier deals coming to an end next year\n\nPublic Sector26 days | 16\n\n#### Some smart meters won't be smart at all once 2/3G networks mothballed\n\nUK reckoning with prospect of millions of homes with obsolete hardware\n\nNetworks10 days | 282\n\n#### UK agriculture department slammed for paper pushing despite tech splurges\n\nDefra is counting contractors like sheep\n\nPublic Sector3 days | 14\n\n#### Getting on board with AI\n\nHow partnerships can provide the key to getting up and running with AI faster\nthan the competition\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Cops cuff man for allegedly framing colleague with AI-generated hate\nspeech clip\n\nAthletics boss accused of deep-faking Baltimore school principal\n\nCyber-crime4 days | 18\n\n#### Turns out teaching criminals to write web code keeps them out of prison\n\nThe software redemption\n\nDevops4 days | 29\n\n#### Law prof predicts generative AI will die at the hands of watchdogs\n\nVideo Big tech backlash and animus against the machines will invite stifling\nred tape\n\nAI + ML5 days | 21\n\n#### Meta comms chief handed six-year Russian prison sentence for 'justifying\nterrorism'\n\nMemo to Andy Stone: Don't go to Moscow for your holidays\n\nPublic Sector6 days | 27\n\n#### Ex-CEO of 'unicorn' app startup HeadSpin heads to jail after BS'ing\ninvestors\n\nLachwani faked it but didn't make it\n\nApplications7 days | 7\n\n#### UK data watchdog questions how private Google's Privacy Sandbox is\n\nLeaked draft report says stated goals still come up short\n\nSecurity7 days | 3\n\n#### Microsoft teases deepfake AI that's too powerful to release\n\nVASA-1 framework can turn a still image and a cloned voice file into a\nplausible video of a person talking\n\nAI + ML9 days | 42\n\n#### IBM accused of cheating its own executive assistants out of overtime pay\n\nBig Blue bosses retaliate against those seeking overtime, lawsuit claims\n\nOn-Prem11 days | 30\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
