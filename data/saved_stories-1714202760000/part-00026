In the\nfew known images of his pets, Milei appears with four of them. But Milei\nhimself says that there are five, and that is how they appear in the\npresidential scepter that he received when he took office in December. A\ncouple of journalists this week asked the presidential spokesperson, Manuel\nAdorni, about the exact number of dogs, but his answers have only managed to\nadd fuel to an issue that has led the president\u2019s detractors to question his\nmental health.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how it changes anything for you if there are four dogs, if\nthere are five dogs or if there are 43 rabbits. What\u2019s the difference?\u201d Adorni\nanswered in his morning press conference on Monday. When cross-examined, he\ntried to settle the debate with a confusing clarification: \u201cIf the president\nsays there are five dogs, there are five dogs and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, another journalist argued that it was necessary to repeat the\nquestion: \u201cWhether there are four or five dogs is not a problem for the\npresident but for all Argentines, because if the president has four dogs, and\nhe sees five, we are talking about a person who sees something that does not\nmatch reality, that\u2019s why I say that we are interested in the number of dogs.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson replied that it is \u201ca lack of respect to define the president\nas a person who speaks with things that do not exist.\u201d Adorni accused the\njournalist of \u201cmessing with his family\u201d and insisted that discussion of this\nissue needed to stop.\n\nThe questions echo a debate that has been alive in Argentine society since the\nelection campaign. In his biography of the libertarian leader, El loco (The\nMadman), Juan Luis Gonz\u00e1lez writes that Milei\u2019s first dog, Conan, died in\n2017. Milei, unable to accept his death, contacted a laboratory to have him\ncloned and began to talk to him through a medium. When EL PA\u00cdS interviewed the\nthen presidential candidate in July, this was his remark on the matter:\n\n\u2014 Is it true that you have telepathic conversations with Conan?\n\n\u2014 Sure, and they also say that my dogs are my advisors, and they are fabulous,\nbecause look at everything I\u2019ve achieved in terms of results.\n\n\u2014 But then you do talk to Conan?\n\n\u2014 What I do inside my home is my problem.\n\nAt that time, there were four months left until the election. Following his\nvictory at the polls, the media echoed the message published by the laboratory\nwhere he cloned the mastiff, PerPETuate, in which they boasted that Milei had\ndedicated the victory \u201cto Conan, his deceased dog, and to the four clones\ncreated from the preserved cells.\u201d Along with the message there was a\nphotograph of Milei with four dogs in 2018, another photo of Conan, and a\nthird in which three clones are seen. The same webpage today, however, shows a\ncorrected picture with \u201cfive clones.\u201d\n\nThe confusion has continued unabated. In a recent interview with CNN en\nEspa\u00f1ol, the journalist asked him about his four dogs, named after famous\nlibertarian economists: Murray, Milton, Robert and Lucas. \u201cThere are five,\u201d\nMilei corrected the reporter, before confessing that his way of relaxing is to\ngo see them every day in the kennels that he ordered built for them in the\nQuinta de Olivos estate. The president offered details about the character of\neach of his five pets. \u201cConan looks very calm, but don\u2019t provoke him,\u201d he\nwarned.\n\nWas Milei referring to the Conan who died in 2017, or to a fifth clone of\nwhich there are no known photographic records?\n\nMilei\u2019s opponents have been using the mystery to ridicule the president. \u201cI am\nstudying so I don\u2019t need to ask a dead dog for advice,\u201d read one of the\nbanners at a massive demonstration in defense of public education on Tuesday.\n\u201cWithout mental health, you see your dead dog,\u201d said another. \u201cConan is dead,\u201d\nread signs painted on the walls of buildings along the path of the protesters.\nSome demonstrators pretended to give orders to an invisible dog, represented\nby a stick to which they had tied a collar on one end.\n\nMilei\u2019s political rivals know that his devotion to his pets is one of the weak\npoints of a leader known for his outbursts of anger. Some have even suggested\nthat he may be suffering from a psychological disorder. This was raised by\nformer president Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, who addressed him in a post on social\nmedia on Thursday: \u201cYou should know that my dog does not advise me (and he is\nalive), that \u2018forces from heaven\u2019 do not send me signals, and that my actions\nand reactions are the result of reflection and not of psychological\nalterations.\u201d The president, at least in public, has not responded to these\nprovocations.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Argentina gripped by one of the largest protests in 20 years: \u2018Public\neducation is an inalienable right\u2019\n\nMar Centenera | Buenos Aires\n\n### Argentina reinforces ties with the US with purchase of used F-16s\n\nMar Centenera | Buenos Aires\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Javier Milei\n  * Argentina\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nGeVestor\n\nWasserstoff-Revolution im AnmarschGeVestor|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nCheckfox\n\nSolar-F\u00f6rder-Hammer in Sachsen: Deshalb m\u00fcssen Hausbesitzer schnell\nseinCheckfox|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nAnd Also...\n\nAnne Heche\u2019s estate cannot pay its debts: The actress had $110,000 and is\nbeing sued for $4 millionEl Pa\u00eds\n\nAS\n\nWhat are the symptoms of bird flu in humans?
