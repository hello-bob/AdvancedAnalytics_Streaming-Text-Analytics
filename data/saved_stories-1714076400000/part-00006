The\nSnapdragon X Plus, announced yesterday, joins the previously announced X Elite\nin Qualcomm's upcoming processor lineup for Windows notebooks. The chips stand\nout as Qualcomm's first potentially competitive laptop processor against\nApple, Intel, and AMD, and the best chance for Windows on Arm to take off.\nHowever, SemiAccurate.com claims that Qualcomm has been far from forthcoming\nwith its curated benchmark results that have been presented to the press.\n\nSemiAccurate, claiming two \"major\" OEMs and a \"deep source at Qualcomm\" for\ntheir benchmark cheating claims, insists that Qualcomm benchmarks are\nimpossible to recreate even by class-leading OEM developers.\n\nA Qualcomm representative sent Tom's Hardware an official comment on the\nmatter, saying succinctly, \"We stand behind our performance claims and are\nexcited for consumers to get their hands on Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus\ndevices soon.\u201d\n\nBack at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit conference held last October, the public\nsaw the first benchmarks of the forthcoming X Elite processors. These numbers,\nclaimed to be clean by SemiAccurate's sources, were slower than expected,\nthough the Qualcomm source claimed the software wasn't final. And those\nbenchmarks were a complete black box \u2014 no one at the conference could see the\nsettings used for testing, and vague charts showing performance against\ncompetitors Apple and Intel were unverifiable.\n\nAfter OEMs got their hands on the X Series chips, SemiAccurate claims no OEM\nhas been able to replicate Qualcomm's touted test numbers. In fact, the site\nreports OEMs first saw numbers \"far sub-50%\" of the numbers Qualcomm claimed.\nQualcomm engineers reportedly told SemiAccurate that they blamed poor\noptimization from Windows running on Arm, and poor cooling. Even after some\ntime had passed and cooling could be improved, however, testers still\nreportedly never came close to Qualcomm's curated benchmarks, with one\nanonymous source comparing the Snapdragon X Elite to Intel Celeron chips.\n\nSemiAccurate makes no claims about specifics of how Qualcomm is allegedly\ncheating its benchmark numbers. If \"tier 1\" OEMs are reportedly unable to even\ncome close to recreating the X Series benchmarks on their own, wrongdoing by\nQualcomm, the site alleges, must be the only other option.\n\nThe site also claims that Qualcomm's product slides are presenting \"tainted\"\nnumbers to the press and its OEM partners. At the Snapdragon Summit, the\ncompany avoided answering technical questions on its forthcoming X Series,\npromising more answers and deep technical briefings before launching its\nchips. It also apparently promised reviewers the opportunity and ability to\nindependently benchmark the new chips before launch; neither of these promises\ncame to be, though there's still time before the chips launch in mid-2024.\n(The press could run benchmarks on devices at hands-on events, but the\nsoftware was all pre-installed in tightly controlled conditions.)\n\nSemiAccurate says Qualcomm's stats, revealed today, on its new line of chips\nlacked the deep technical elements originally promised, with more time spent\non potential camera specs enabled by the SoC processors than any real\ntechnical stats or deep analysis. We did get core counts, cache, and clock\nspeeds, but nothing deeply technical outside of spec sheets.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nIf the claims prove true, it would certainly rock a laptop world that looked\nto the X Series as Windows' response to Apple's M Series processors, but for\nnow, these claims are unsubstantiated. Naturally, we can't test the veracity\nof these huge claims until the silicon comes to market.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to make big announcements in this space at its Build\ndeveloper conference in May, hopefully giving us a better idea of the shape of\nWindows on Arm.\n\nEdit 04/25/2024 3:30am PT: Added comment from Qualcomm.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

It can be distilled (by me, not AI) into\nthree points: Qualcomm has not been forthcoming with detailed specs of their\nchip. OEMs reported poor performance with samples - sometimes 50% slower;\nother times much more. An insider at Qualcomm claims they cooked the\nbenchmarking, yet at the same time by manipulating the benchmarks they made\nthe chip look worse in other areas than it really is.On the first two points\nSemiAccurate states that Qualcomm worked with them months ago. They provided\nmore information on the chip and blamed Windows on ARM for being unoptimized.\n\nI'm trying to see every side here. It could be Qualcomm is maliciously lying\nabout their benchmarks, but if it's really as slow as a Celeron (as one OEM\nstated), then that will be discovered very quickly by tech journalists.\n\nWhat if Qualcomm is struggling to get the chip to play nicely with Windows 11\non Arm? That would make sense why Qualcomm is delaying the benchmarks and test\nsamples to journalists. Nobody at Qualcomm wants to hear, \"The Snapdragon X\nElite runs like trash! What a loser!\" when they believe it's MS's fault. Even\nif MS fixes their OS after launch, everyone will still think of the SD X Elite\nas junk and the initial image can't be fixed. That might explain it all.\n\nReply\n\n  * Bruhme2985\n\nI checked the article tonshardware linked and man did it sound incredibly\npetty and childish. The website for one doesn't look even remotely\nprofessional and the article is just a dude ranting that he didn't get an\ninside peek at it.\n\nA lot of things including the fact that the dude messed things up in the\narticle (for instance snapdragon doesn't have an x Pro chipset), shows that it\nis more of a rant then anything special, the dude wasn't even bothered to\nreread his own rant.\n\nHonestly his article imo has very little weight to it, even if it was true his\narticle is too unprofessional and salty. It makes sense why snapdragon doesn't\nwant to talk to you, you sound too bitter.\n\nReply\n\n  * bcweir\n\nWait, you call the author's remarks petty and childish, yet refer to the other\nperson as 'dude,' undercutting your own argument to treat people with respect.\nUnless you're either a Valley Girl or a professional surfer, try following\nyour own rules before calling out someone else for the same sins you're\ncommitting\n\nReply\n\n  * bit_user\n\n> Bruhme2985 said:\n>\n> I checked the article tonshardware linked and man did it sound incredibly\n> petty and childish.

The articles try way too hard to strike\na clever and informal tone, while self-congratulating and calling out every\nslight the author believes he received, at every possible opportunity. It\nturns them into rants that I find virtually unreadable. Add to that the\njealous paywall-guarding of the few actual nuggets of information the author\nmanaged to collect and the entire site is basically just a frustrating waste\nof time.\n\nI really don't know why anyone in the industry still talks to Charlie, at this\npoint. It's probably just a shrinking number of disgruntled tech workers\ntrying to settle a score, which makes his information very subject to\nexaggeration and mischaracterization.\n\nIf you want to see what SemiAccurate could have been, head on over to\nSemiAnalysis: https://www.semianalysis.com/\n\nReply\n\n  * bit_user\n\nOh, and as for the allegations, I'm probably not as bothered by them as I\nshould be. I try to disregard both leaks and curated benchmark scores, instead\njust waiting until review samples get into the hands of independent tech\njournalists.\n\nThat said, even the best review I saw of the Thinkpad X13S, which I think is\nprobably the leading implementation of the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 we've seen to\ndate, is still quite lacking in benchmarks of native apps, even where they\nexist (i.e. web, productivity, etc.). So, I do understand Qualcomm's concerns\nabout how it will be treated by the tech press and influencers looking to\nscore points with their audience at its expense.\n\nReply\n\n  * Alvar \"Miles\" Udell\n\nYou mean a first party manufacturer is presenting numbers that were probably\nobtained in a very specific way on order to maximize the performance numbers\nfor publicity? That NEVER happens with AMD, Intel, nVidia, or any other\ncompany...\n\nReply\n\n  * JamesJones44\n\nAssuming everything SemiAccurate said ends up being true, the minute\nindependent benchmarks come out Qualcomm would be in big trouble. Maybe they\nare crazy enough to try, but that seems like the fastest way to have your\nproduct killed and lawsuits thrown at your company.\n\nGuess we'll find out in the July timeframe.\n\nReply\n\n  * Bruhme2985\n\n> bcweir said:\n>\n> Wait, you call the author's remarks petty and childish, yet refer to the\n> other person as 'dude,' undercutting your own argument to treat people with\n> respect.

It's informal\nEnglish, and the guy is a dude a male. I am a dude, a male human. How is dude\nderogatory, it really isn't. :unsure:\n\nReply\n\n  * Bruhme2985\n\n> bit_user said:\n>\n> I can confirm that SemiAccurate (mostly the work of Charlie Demerjian) has\n> fallen far from whatever grace it had.

Man, I wonder what happened to him that made him change I guess.\nMaybe stress or something. I read the article and it was very weird, he acted\nas if qualcomn owed him to get a sneek peak of their chip.\n\nReply\n\n  * CmdrShepard\n\nIn the past Charlie was right on Intel SNAFUs so I will give them a benefit of\na doubt (I don't trust Qualcomm as far as I can throw them).\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nUS investigates China's access to RISC-V \u2014 open standard instruction set may\nbecome new site of US-China chip war\n\nFallout-inspired game runs in Excel \u2014 a spreadsheet-powered wasteland escape\nfrom your daily corporate wasteland\n\nAMD Strix Point engineering sample underwhelms in early Geekbench 6 results\n\nAMD-powered classic Macintosh Classic-Inspired mini PC available for retail \u2014\nAyaneo's new AM01 released after a successful Indiegogo campaign\n\nRaspberry Pi Compute Module 4S memory variants announced\n\nTSMC's labor practices draw serious concern in Arizona \u2014 the company's new\nchip plant allegedly plagued by worker abuses\n\nFormer EKWB Employees say company has racist, hostile work environment,\nwithholds overtime pay\n\nGigabyte confirms Ryzen 9000 branding for Zen 5 processors, preps beta BIOS\nupdates for 500-series motherboards\n\nWindows 11 update brings advertisements to the start menu\n\nQualcomm announces Snapdragon X Plus \u2013 10-cores is less than X Elite, but the\nsame 45 TOPS from the NPU\n\nBambu Lab Printer Firmware Updates Have Limited Timeline\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
