There\u2019s that level of scrutiny and\nconcern around the viability for commercial use.\u201d\n\nThe company said Firefly was only trained on licensed content from Adobe\u2019s\nimage banks. To back up that claim, they provided enterprise users with full\nlegal indemnification for any content created using it. This is \u201ca proof point\nthat we stand behind the commercial safety and readiness of these features,\u201d\nClaude Alexandre, the company\u2019s VP of digital media, said at last year\u2019s Adobe\nSummit.\n\nUnfortunately, or perhaps inevitably, this wasn\u2019t entirely true. A Bloomberg\nreport found Firefly was trained, in part, on AI-generated images. Some of\nthese came from Midjourney, an AI many believe was trained on images scraped\nfrom the web.\n\nThis has created a big marketing problem for Adobe and potentially a big legal\nproblem for Firefly\u2019s users. It also highlights IP issues that hang over all\nof AI and that can only be solved by law.\n\n## The 5% solution\n\nAdobe said the images from Midjourney only made up 5% of the training\nmaterial. That\u2019s not a great defense. The company has 248 million images under\nlicense, so that \u201conly\u201d could be up to 1.25 million pictures.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 5%, 1%, 000.1%,\u201d said Katie Robbert, CEO and co-\nfounder of Trust Insights, and a MarTech contributor. \u201cYou are making the\ndeclarative statements of what your product does and doesn\u2019t do. And when it\u2019s\nshown that what you\u2019re saying is not true, then you\u2019re no longer a trustworthy\nbrand.\u201d\n\nIn addition to brand damage, it also means Firefly doesn\u2019t solve the problem\nit is supposed to.\n\nDig deeper: AI in marketing: Examples to help your team today\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a high degree of concern that you\u2019re going to generate\nsomething that someone\u2019s going to come back and say, that\u2019s mine,\u201d Robbert\nsaid. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know that. And that\u2019s the problem. Users are stuck in this\nlimbo of \u2018Can I use it safely, or can\u2019t I?\u2019 We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n## Brands at risk\n\nWhat that means is a lot of marketers for big brands who rely on Firefly are\nnow looking for something that will ensure they have the legal right to use\nthe images they create. \u201cBecause the last thing I need is a lawsuit because I\njust wanted to put an image on my blog,\u201d said Robbert.\n\nIn the event of a lawsuit, it\u2019s the brand and not Adobe that\u2019s at risk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an IP attorney, but I believe the end user is the one who\u2019s liable\nfor the use of the tool,\u201d said Paul Roetzer, CEO of The Marketing AI\nInstitute. \u201cSo if there is some massive class action lawsuit and it\u2019s\ndetermined that these models were actually illegally trained, the end user is\nthe one that\u2019s going to get caught up in it.\u201d\n\nRoetzer said the best remedy for this situation is a legal one. The EU already\nhas regulations in place to deal with this. The AI Act requires providers to\nprovide the public with a detailed summary of the content used for training\ntheir models. It also has limited exceptions for text and data mining, which\nbalance copyright protection with promoting innovation and research.\n\nIn the U.S. it currently looks like regulations may come about because of\nlawsuits, not legislation. Roetzer said that means the technology will\ncontinue to outpace the law.\n\n\u201cThese models are going to advance so much more before we ever have any\nmeaningful lawsuits that get to the point where we have regulations that cover\nthis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe speed of innovation, fueled by consumer demand, is only going to compound\nthe problem.\n\nDig deeper into marketing AI:\n\nWhat is AI in marketing and why should marketers care?\n\nWelcome to MarTechBot\n\nUsing AI to improve customer experience and customer journey orchestration\n\nAI in marketing: Examples to help your team today\n\n\u201cPeople are going to want the most advanced technology,\u201d Roetzer said. \u201cThat\ntechnology may or may not have been trained on things they probably shouldn\u2019t\nhave been trained on. That is just where we are and it\u2019s where we\u2019re going and\nit\u2019s not going to stop anytime soon.\u201d\n\nEmail:\n\nSee terms.\n\nAdd MarTech to your Google News feed.\n\nRelated stories\n\nCrafting exceptional customer experiences with AI and agile: A 5-step guide\n\nAdobe adds AI tools to Photoshop powered by updated Firefly Image 3\n\nEmail tactics and CTAs for lead generation: Best of the MarTechBot\n\nAdobe puts two AI tools into general release\n\nAI-powered martech releases and news: April 18\n\nNew on MarTech\n\nWhat marketers need to know about the TikTok ban\n\nCrafting exceptional customer experiences with AI and agile: A 5-step guide\n\nA marketer\u2019s guide to Reddit\n\nHubSpot launches new genAI-powered Content Hub\n\nHow to align processes to drive martech utilization\n\nAbout the author\n\nStaff\n\nConstantine von Hoffman\n\nConstantine von Hoffman is managing editor of MarTech.
