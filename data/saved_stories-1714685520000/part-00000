You can easily see this dynamic\nin governments, large companies, and political parties. It\u2019s comparatively\neasy to debate complex topics and make good decisions when there are only a\ncouple of well-informed decision makers. But it becomes nearly impossible when\nyou get to even a small team size. To prove the point, try to find a lunch\nrestaurant to satisfy 10 of your coworkers. Seriously, try to do it this\nafternoon and record how long it takes and how satisfied people are with the\noutcome.\n\nThanks for reading Silicon Ladders.

But for this to be an effective strategy, there have to\nbe a small number of people in authority.\n\nThe simple fact that large human organizations require a small number of\nleaders has a profound impact on the connection between skill and reward in\nyour career.\n\n##\n\nLuck and Senior Leadership\n\nImagine that you run a large, highly competitive tech company. You only hire\nworkers that can demonstrate that they are in the top 10% for their skill set.\nBecause your company doesn\u2019t need a lot of employees to be very profitable and\nthe labor market is pretty big, you have an essentially unlimited talent pool\nto recruit from. Because it\u2019s very difficult to measure performance on the\njob, let alone in an interview, workers at your company appear to have a\npretty much undifferentiated level of total skill. Some will be better at\ncoding, marketing, internal office politics, presentations, or management, but\nfor a senior leader without intimate knowledge of what each person is doing,\nthey all appear to be bright, hard-working people.\n\nYour large organization can only remain effective and cohesive with a small\nnumber of senior leaders. But to you, all of your workers will appear to be\npretty much equally skilled. So how can you differentiate the top 1% from the\nmerely top 10% and promote them accordingly?\n\n##\n\nRewarding Business Results Reinforces Luck-Based Promotion\n\nMost organizations solve this (at least on paper) by promoting senior leaders\non the basis of real world business results. After all, a corporate entity\nplaces no intrinsic value on being fair. The point of a business is to\ngenerate profit, and it makes sense to promote leaders who have done that in\nthe past.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a problem for the business, but it is a problem for anyone aspiring\nto be a senior leader. Although skill, work ethic, and a dozen other positive\ntraits are positively correlated with getting good business results, there\nisn\u2019t a strict causal relationship. The world is random.\n\nMIT graduates do better than the average college graduate in their careers,\nbut some won\u2019t do well at all. At the same time, some graduates of local\ncommunity colleges go on to lead fortune 50 companies.\n\n##\n\nDriving Business Results\n\nFrom the perspective of an employee at a technology company where everyone is\nalready an MIT graduate, driving significant business results and being\npromoted to senior leadership largely boils down to luck. If you are a\nsoftware engineer, you would have had a pretty good shot at driving huge\nbusiness impact as employee #5 at Facebook in 2005.\n\nBut in 2005, Facebook looked like most other high-risk startups - there was\nabsolutely no guarantee that it wouldn\u2019t just fizzle out in 18 months. Those\nthat took the risk and stuck with it got rewarded, but those that worked at a\ndozen other promising social network startups at the time got nothing.\n\nThe same winner-takes-all dynamic is at work in a large organization\u2019s\npromotion choices. Those that work on projects that succeed get promoted on\nthe basis of having delivered real world results. But often, those results are\na product of having been at the right place at the right time, not skill.\n\nSo how do you hack the system and get to L9? Increase your exposure to lucky\nevents.\n\nThat may sound like tongue-and-cheek sarcasm, but it\u2019s not. There are\nbehaviors that you can cultivate that will make you more lucky. Check out my\npost next week to learn what they are!\n\nThanks for reading Silicon Ladders.
