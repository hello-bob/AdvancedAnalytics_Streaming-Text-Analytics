Understand it.\n  * Wrap-up: Design Feedback Basics\n\nUser Experience (UX) Design is about identifying, understanding, and solving\nproblems (see UI vs UX). UX Design also requires a careful balance between\naesthetics and usability or form and function. It is much more than \u201cmaking it\npretty\u201d (see Design is not Decoration).\n\nI like to use relatable examples to explain abstract concepts. This time, I\u2019ll\nuse cake. Great design is like a great cake \ud83c\udf82 \ud83c\udf70 \ud83e\uddc1.\n\nWhen you buy a beautiful cake and bite into it only to taste a dry, flavorless\nmouthful, what a disappointment! A great cake needs to taste as great as it\nlooks, and vice versa. In addition, a cake is often intended for a specific\noccasion. It might be for a summer party outdoors (so it better not require\nrefrigeration!) or for a wedding (so it better be big and fancy!) or for a\ngroup with dietary restrictions (so it better be vegan/nut-free/gluten-free!).\n\nA well-designed cake looks great, tastes great, and is perfect for the people\nand occasion it was intended for. In the same way, well-designed software\nsolves a problem for its users in a way that looks great and is easy to use.\n\nThat makes sense, right?\n\nSo you put in a lot of effort to understand the problem and the users, and\nthen get to work crafting a beautiful solution. Then comes the feedback.\n\nAfter a few rounds of design feedback, projects often go off the rails. At\nthis stage, we lose sight of the problem, people start pointing fingers, and\ndesigners feel forced to make changes that ruin the design. (Have you ever\nseen this classic comic on The Oatmeal about the process?)\n\nJust as we must understand problems before jumping in and designing solutions,\nwe must understand design feedback before jumping in and making changes. We\nmust peel apart the layers of aesthetics, usability, functionality, and\npersonal preference to find a solution.\n\nComing back to the baking example, let\u2019s think through how these factors come\ninto play.\n\n## Benny\u2019s Bakery\n\nBenny has a famous bakery for cakes. One of his most popular cakes is his\nsignature chocolate cherry cake.\n\nCharlie wants to purchase one of Benny\u2019s cakes for an upcoming party he is\nplanning. He asks for recommendations, and Benny offers a sample of his\nsignature cake.\n\nCharlie tries the cake, and comments, \u201cThis is great! I love the flavor\ncombination. But, hmm, I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t seem quite... chocolaty\nenough.\u201d\n\nHow should Benny respond? Here are three ways this might play out.\n\n### 1: Benny makes a change without clarifying the feedback.\n\nBenny was very careful to create the right balance of flavors in his chocolate\ncherry cake. Adding more chocolate or removing some cherry would throw off the\nbalance, so he suggested a chocolate cake for Charlie instead.\n\nCharlie replied, \u201cI really like the chocolate cherry flavor, I just think it\nwould be better if it was a little more... chocolaty, somehow.\u201d\n\nBenny wasn\u2019t one to argue with his customers, so he added more chocolate and\nless cherry between the layers. In the end, the cake was okay, but it wasn\u2019t\nquite what Charlie was hoping for. Maybe he should have gone with a chocolate\ncake after all, he thought, or maybe he should have just gone to another\nbakery to find something just right.\n\nBenny reacted to the feedback without fully understanding the problem. He\nwasn\u2019t able to improve the cake for Charlie.\n\nHere\u2019s another way this could have played out:\n\n### 2: Benny clarifies the feedback before making changes.\n\nAfter Charlie requested a more chocolaty chocolate cherry cake, Benny asked\nfor more information.\n\n\u201cBefore suggesting a change, I want to make sure I know what it is that you\u2019re\nnot liking. Can you be more specific? What do you think about the cake itself?\nAnd what about the filling and frosting?\u201d\n\nCharlie thought about it and replied, \u201cI like the cake very much, and the\nchocolate cherry filling is great. Hmm, you know, maybe it\u2019s just the frosting\nand decoration. It has a lot of pink and cherries. It\u2019s a little too, I don\u2019t\nknow... feminine, maybe? Maybe you could just decorate with more chocolate\ninstead of cherries?\n\nNow Benny understood what was going on. Charlie liked the flavor, but it was a\nlittle too frou-frou for Charlie, so he felt funny serving it at his party.\nWith this knowledge, Benny redecorated the cake with chocolate-covered\ncherries and white frosting. The result was almost identical in flavor but had\nan appearance that matched what Charlie was hoping for.\n\nBenny and Charlie were both happy with the result. Charlie would definitely\nreturn in the future, his friends at his party loved the cake so much that\nBenny got new customers, and Benny got new ideas for styling his cakes for\nwider appeal.\n\nBy clarifying Charlie\u2019s feedback, Benny realized that what sounded like an\nissue of flavor was actually an issue of appearance. By identifying this, he\nwas able to adjust the cake perfectly.\n\nBut what about personal preference? How does that factor in? Obviously,\nCharlie\u2019s personal preference is for a masculine cake, but sometimes personal\npreference needs to be identified and then ignored.\n\n### 3: Benny factors in personal preference\n\nBenny understands what Charlie wants but also wants to ensure it\u2019s the right\nchoice for his party. He says, \u201cI think you mentioned that this cake is for\nyour wife\u2019s birthday party. Does your wife prefer things not to be too\nfeminine?\u201d\n\nCharlie thought about it and realized, \u201cNo, actually, she loves pink very\nmuch. She loves chocolate, but the only thing she loves more than chocolate is\npink. You know what, leave it as is. Or if you can make it even more pink, do\nit! I was thinking about the guests at the party, but now that you mention it,\nthis cake is really for her!\u201d\n\nBenny decided to use a pink cardboard base for the cake and stick to the\noriginal cake design.\n\nThe result was perfect. The cake was a hit at the party. It reminded everyone\nof Benny\u2019s wife, and it tasted amazing.\n\nBenny recognized that Charlie\u2019s personal preference was for something less\npink, but that Charlie\u2019s personal preference might not be the most important\nfor this cake. By talking it through, he helped Charlie realize that what he\nwanted was not what was best at all.\n\nSeparating issues of aesthetics, flavor, and personal preference is critical\nfor Benny if he wants to bake the right cake for each customer and each\noccasion. Similarly, separating issues of aesthetics, usability,\nfunctionality, and personal preference is critical for software design.\n\n## A Software Example: Lydia\u2019s Landing Page\n\nLydia has hired Designer Dave to design a landing page encouraging users to\npurchase her company\u2019s new product. This was her first assignment at her new\njob, and she really wanted it to turn out well.\n\nDave put together a page with a prominent orange \u201cBuy It Now\u201d button that\nmatched the product\u2019s branding.\n\nAfter sharing the mockup with Lydia, she commented, \u201cThis is looking great!\nBut, well, I\u2019m not sure about the button.\u201d\n\nDave explained, \u201cThe call-to-action is the most important part of the page. It\nis important to make it clear. And it is orange to match the product\u2019s\nbranding.\u201d\n\nLydia responded, \u201cOk, but it\u2019s just really, I don\u2019t know, too big? Too bold? I\njust really don\u2019t like how it looks there.\n\nThere are a few ways this could play out:\n\n### 1\\. Dave makes changes without clarifying the feedback.\n\nDave was frustrated. Why couldn\u2019t Lydia understand how important it was for\nthe button to be big and prominent? He threw up his hands, then got to work on\na new version with a smaller, more muted button.\n\nLydia still wasn\u2019t sure about the button. But Dave had done what she asked,\nright? Not wanting to cause more delay over a button, she decided to accept\nthe design and move forward.\n\nLydia had a problem, and Dave made changes without understanding it. Now, both\nthe aesthetic and the usability have been compromised. The button no longer\nfunctions as a successful call-to-action. Neither Lydia nor Dave are happy\nwith the outcome.\n\nHere\u2019s a better way this could have gone:\n\n### 2\\. Dave clarifies the feedback before making changes.\n\nDave, sensing some misalignment, offered more explanation and asked questions\nto clarify before making any changes.\n\n\u201cThe call-to-action button is the most important part of the page, so I made\nit very large. And because the primary brand color is orange, I matched that.\nDo you feel like too much orange is being used? Or do you think I have given\nthe button too much prominence?\u201d\n\nAfter giving it some thought, Lydia replied, \u201cI agree that the button is the\nmost important thing. It should definitely be prominent. You\u2019re right that the\nbrand color is orange, but it does feel like a bit much. Maybe what you did is\nfine, but could you try it in another color that works with the brand?\u201d\n\nUnderstanding that Lydia\u2019s issue is aesthetic, Dave modified the design, using\na secondary color that worked well with the branding.\n\nLydia liked it much better, and both Dave and Lydia felt good about where it\nlanded. The page looked great, on brand, and served its purpose perfectly.\n\nBy clarifying Lydia\u2019s design feedback, her goals were better understood. With\na better understanding, Dave put together a well-balanced design that met her\nneeds.\n\nBut where does personal preference factor in? Should Lydia\u2019s preference for\navoiding orange really steer the direction of the project? Here\u2019s one more\nexample, taking this into account.\n\n### 3\\. Dave factors in personal preference.\n\nDave has been working hard to establish consistent standards based on the\ncompany brand. A lot of time and money was invested into the branding\nguidelines. It was backed by market research and already had buy-in from many\ninternal stakeholders.\n\nLydia is relatively new to the company and wasn\u2019t caught up to speed with any\nof this history. All Lydia knew was that she was tasked with hiring a designer\nand monitoring work on a landing page to sell the new product. She had a\nstrong, negative reaction to the orange and believed that users would feel the\nsame way.\n\nBefore making any changes, Dave decided to catch Lydia up on the brand work.\nHe walked her through the branding guidelines and the research behind them. He\nshowed examples of other materials that used the branding. Lydia quickly\nrealized that orange was the right color to use.\n\nDave didn\u2019t change the design just because Lydia didn\u2019t like it. He listened\nto her feedback, identified it as aesthetic and personal preference, and\nhelped give Lydia insight into the larger business impact of using (or not\nusing) a big orange button. With Dave\u2019s help, Lydia was understood, informed,\nand empowered to make the best decision for her business.\n\n## Don\u2019t Dismiss Feedback. Understand it.\n\nAll the examples here are intended to show why we must ask clarifying\nquestions and avoid making assumptions when accepting feedback. It can be\ndifficult to understand and categorize design feedback, and you might be\ntempted to use labels to dismiss valid feedback.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. He\u2019s just commenting on his personal\npreference.\u201d\n\nThis sort of reaction damages working relationships and leads to poor outcomes\nthat fail to solve the problems at hand. Never use these labels to ignore\nfeedback. Use them to clarify and understand.\n\n## Wrap-up: Design Feedback Basics\n\n  1. When you receive feedback, make sure you understand it.\n  2. To understand feedback, it helps to separate issues of aesthetics, functionality, usability, and personal preference.\n  3. Do not use these labels to dismiss feedback. Use them to clarify and understand it.\n\nWhat stories and advice do you have about dealing with feedback?\n\nfeedbackUX Design\n\nJenn Carr Software Consultant & Designer at Atomic Object Ann Arbor.
