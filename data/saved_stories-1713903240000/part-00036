The surface of a sphere, for instance, is\na two-dimensional manifold. Topologists understand such two-dimensional\nmanifolds very well. And they have developed tools that let them make sense of\nthree-dimensional manifolds and those with five or more dimensions.\n\nBut in four dimensions, \u201ceverything goes a bit crazy,\u201d said Sam Hughes, a\npostdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. Tools stop working;\nexotic behavior emerges. As Tom Mrowka of the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology explained, \u201cThere\u2019s just enough room to have interesting phenomena,\nbut not so much room that they fall apart.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mrowka and Peter Kronheimer of Harvard University were\nstudying how two-dimensional surfaces can be embedded within four-dimensional\nmanifolds. They developed new techniques to characterize these surfaces,\nallowing them to gain crucial insights into the otherwise inaccessible\nstructure of four-dimensional manifolds. Their findings suggested that the\nmembers of a broad class of surfaces all slice through their parent manifold\nin a relatively simple way, leaving a fundamental property unchanged. But\nnobody could prove this was always true.\n\nIn February, together with Daniel Ruberman of Brandeis University, Hughes\nconstructed a sequence of counterexamples \u2014 \u201ccrazy\u201d two-dimensional surfaces\nthat dissect their parent manifolds in ways that mathematicians had believed\nto be impossible. The counterexamples show that four-dimensional manifolds are\neven more remarkably diverse than mathematicians in earlier decades had\nrealized. \u201cIt\u2019s really a beautiful paper,\u201d Mrowka said. \u201cI just keep looking\nat it. There\u2019s lots of delicious little things there.\u201d\n\n## Making a List\n\nLate last year, Ruberman helped organize a conference that created a new list\nof the most significant open problems in low-dimensional topology. In\npreparing for it, he looked at a previous list of important unsolved\ntopological problems from 1997. It included a question that Kronheimer had\nposed based on his work with Mrowka. \u201cIt was in there, and I think it was a\nlittle bit forgotten,\u201d Ruberman said. Now he thought he could answer it.\n\nTo understand the question, it helps to first consider two key ideas: simply\nconnected manifolds, and the fundamental group.\n\nSimply connected manifolds are spaces without any holes passing through them.\nIn one dimension, an infinite line is simply connected, but a circle isn\u2019t. In\ntwo dimensions, an infinite plane and the surface of a sphere are simply\nconnected, but the surface of a doughnut is not.\n\nMathematicians make this distinction rigorous by placing loops on a manifold\nand considering how they can be deformed. If any loop can be shrunk to a\npoint, then a manifold is simply connected. On a plane or the surface of a\nsphere, for instance, this is possible \u2014 think about pulling a string taut.\nBut if that string goes around a circle, it can\u2019t shrink. Similarly, on the\nsurface of a doughnut, loops that go either around or through the central hole\ncan\u2019t be deformed into a single point. The doughnut itself gets in the way.\n\nMathematicians classify spaces that are not simply connected by computing\ntheir \u201cfundamental group,\u201d an object whose structure reflects how loops\nshrink. Manifolds that are simply connected have a \u201ctrivial\u201d fundamental group\nwith just one element. But manifolds with holes in them have more complicated\nfundamental groups.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\nFour-dimensional manifolds that are simply connected can still be plenty\nstrange. To understand them, mathematicians ponder what can happen to the two-\ndimensional surfaces embedded in them.\n\nBy analogy, think about laying a loop of string flat on a piece of paper.\nThere\u2019s not much you can do with it. But lift it up into three-dimensional\nspace, and you can tie it into complicated knots. The ways in which you can\nmanipulate the string \u2014 a one-dimensional manifold \u2014 clarify the nature of the\nspace it is embedded in.\n\nSimilarly, in the more complicated world of four dimensions, two-dimensional\nsurfaces are \u201ckind of key to the whole business, in many different ways,\u201d\nRuberman said. \u201cSurfaces tell you much more about a four-dimensional manifold\nthan you have any right to expect.\u201d Surfaces let you distinguish between\nmanifolds: If a surface can live inside one manifold but not another, you know\nthe manifolds are different. And surfaces can be used to build new manifolds\nout of old ones.\n\nSurfaces also have corresponding fundamental groups. And so do their\ncomplements \u2014 the part of a manifold that is left over when you take the\nsurface away. Remove the equator from two-dimensional manifolds like the\nsurface of a sphere or doughnut, for instance, and you get two disconnected\nhemispheres. But the doughnut\u2019s surface remains in one piece if you remove a\nvertical ring instead of a horizontal one. Similarly, depending on how you cut\na surface out of a four-dimensional manifold, you can get different kinds of\ncomplements.\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine\n\n## Introduction\n\nBack in the 1990s, Mrowka and Kronheimer investigated what happens when you\nexcise a two-dimensional surface from a four-dimensional manifold. If the\nmanifold itself is simply connected, what conditions must surfaces meet to\nguarantee that their complements must also be simply connected?\n\nKronheimer and Mrowka knew that some kinds of surfaces could have complements\nthat weren\u2019t simply connected. But their work seemed to indicate that another\nbroad class of surfaces must always have simply connected complements.\n\nFor nearly three decades, nobody could find an example of a surface in that\nclass whose complement was not simply connected. But in the fall of 2023,\nafter coming across the problem, Ruberman thought he could. Instead of\nstarting with a four-dimensional manifold and cutting out a surface, he began\nwith a two-dimensional surface that had the necessary properties and built a\nmanifold around it.\n\nSurfaces tell you much more about a four-dimensional manifold than you have\nany right to expect.\n\nDaniel Ruberman\n\nFirst, he fattened the surface into a four-dimensional blob. This four-\ndimensional blob had a three-dimensional boundary, just as a three-dimensional\nobject like a ball has a two-dimensional boundary. Ruberman wanted to attach a\ncarefully chosen four-dimensional manifold to the other side of the boundary,\nwhich would serve as the surface\u2019s complement. If the gambit worked, then this\nmanifold would have a complicated fundamental group, yet the fundamental group\nof everything taken together would be trivial. The newly constructed four-\ndimensional manifold would therefore be simply connected.\n\nBut to be able to glue everything together in the right way, he had to show\nthat the fundamental group of the new addition satisfied all sorts of\nproperties. \u201cI had no idea how to do that,\u201d Ruberman said.\n\nThen in January, Hughes \u2014 a group theorist \u2014 gave a talk at Brandeis. Ruberman\nwas in the audience. He recognized that Hughes might have the missing piece he\nwas looking for. The two met up the following day, and within a few hours,\nthey\u2019d worked out the main ideas they needed. What Ruberman was missing \u201cis\nsomething group theorists have been computing for 70, 80 years at this point,\u201d\nHughes said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this forever.\u201d By the end of the week, they had a\ncompleted proof.\n\n\u201cI knew some things, and he knew some things, and between the two of us, we\nknew enough to just do it,\u201d Ruberman said.\n\nBecause of the way group theory gets used in the proof, \u201cit\u2019s a little bit\nunusual,\u201d said Maggie Miller of the University of Texas, Austin. \u201cIt\u2019s written\na little bit different than most four-dimensional topologists would be\ncomfortable with.\u201d\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### A New Agenda for Low-Dimensional Topology\n\n  2. ### New Math Book Rescues Landmark Topology Proof\n\n  3. ### Mathematicians Eliminate Long-Standing Threat to Knot Conjecture\n\nThe result is yet another example of how complicated four-dimensional topology\ncan get. \u201cThere are more interesting embeddings of surfaces than we thought,\u201d\nHughes said. This makes it more difficult to classify manifolds, and harder to\nprove other kinds of results about them.\n\nNevertheless, in March, \u0130nan\u00e7 Baykur of the University of Massachusetts,\nAmherst, who organized last year\u2019s list-making conference with Ruberman,\nannounced the solution to another problem involving simply connected four-\ndimensional manifolds from the 1997 list.\n\nIt seems the topologists are cleaning house.\n\nBy Jordana Cepelewicz\n\nSenior Writer\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nAbstractions bloggroup theorymathematicstopologyAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Abstractions blog\n\nconsciousness\n\n### Insects and Other Animals Have Consciousness, Experts Declare\n\nBy Dan Falk\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n30\n\nRead Later\n\nTuring Award\n\n### Avi Wigderson, Complexity Theory Pioneer, Wins Turing Award\n\nBy Stephen Ornes\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\n4\n\nRead Later\n\ngeometry\n\n### Number of Distances Separating Points Has a New Bound\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\n1\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
