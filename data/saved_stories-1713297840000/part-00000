Using the provided package, you can\nquickly set up your application's users, connect them to your Stripe account,\nand start making payouts.\n\nUsing the Payable trait in this package, you can onboard users and then start\nsending them payments:\n\n    \n    \n    use SimonHamp\\LaravelStripeConnect\\Traits\\Payable;\n    \n    class User extends Model\n    \n    {\n    \n    use Payable;\n    \n    }\n    \n    // After onboarding, send the user $100.00 USD\n    \n    auth()->user()->pay(10000, 'usd');\n\nThis package assumes that the User model represents the recipient, but the\ndocumentation outlines how to change the model used if a different model\nrepresents your recipients.\n\nYou can learn more about this package, get full installation instructions, and\nview the source code on GitHub. You must have a Stripe Connect account to get\nstarted, and you can learn more about Stripe Connect through the\ndocumentation.\n\nPaul Redmond\n\nStaff writer at Laravel News.
