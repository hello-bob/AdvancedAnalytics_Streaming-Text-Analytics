It blamed the nosedive on a\n\u201clower volume of consoles sold\u201d during the start of 2024. If that sounds like\na repeat of last year, it\u2019s because it is. \u201cXbox hardware revenue decreased\n30% on a strong prior year comparable, driven by lower volume of consoles\nsold,\u201d Microsoft reported back in April 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nMicrosoft Is Making An Xbox Mini Fridge Because Capitalism\n\nXbox\u2019s AI Chatbot Could Be Your Gaming Assistant\n\nThe Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nThe Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023\n\nIn February, Grand Theft Auto VI parent company Take-Two claimed in a\npresentation to investors that there were roughly 77 million \u201cgen 9\" consoles\nin people\u2019s homes. It didn\u2019t take fans long to do the math and speculate that\nMicrosoft had only sold around 25 million Xbox Series X/S consoles to-date.\nThat puts it ahead of the GameCube but behind the Nintendo 64, at least for\nnow. Given the results this quarter as well, it doesn\u2019t seem like Game Pass\nand Starfield have moved the needle much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe that will change once Call of Duty, which Microsoft acquired last fall\nalong with the rest of Activision Blizzard, finally makes its way to Game\nPass. Diablo IV only just arrived on the Netflix-like subscription platform\nthis month. But given the fact that the fate of Xbox Series X/S appears to be\nlocked in at this point, it\u2019s easy to see why Microsoft is looking at other\nplaces it can put its games.\n\nSea of Thieves, the last of four games in this initial volley to come to PS5,\ndominated the PlayStation Store\u2019s top sellers list last week on pre-orders\nalone. CEO Satya Nadella specifically called this out during a call with\ninvestors, noting that Microsoft had more games in the top 25 best sellers on\nPS5 than any other publisher. \u201cWe are committed to meeting players where they\nare by bringing great games to more people on more devices,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf players there continue to flock to the live-service pirate sim, it\u2019s not\nhard to imagine Microsoft bringing another batch of its first-party exclusives\nto the rival platform. Whether that means more recent blockbusters like\nStarfield or the upcoming Indiana Jones game will someday make the journey\nremains to be seen.\n\nFor now, even if the Xbox Series X/S sales have gone from bad to worse,\nMicrosoft has made it clear it\u2019s not abandoning hardware altogether. Earlier\nthis year, the company promised its next console would be the \u201cbiggest\ntechnical leap\u201d yet in its hardware history. And Xbox president Sarah Bond\nrecently said the company \u201cremains committed\u201d to backwards compatibility and\ngame preservation for players\u2019 current and future libraries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate 4/25/2024 5:57 p.m. ET: Added details from the earnings call.\n\n.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
