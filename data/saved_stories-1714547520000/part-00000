A WAP browser is a web browser for\nmobile devices such as mobile phones that use the protocol. Introduced in\n1999,^[1] WAP achieved some popularity in the early 2000s, but by the 2010s it\nhad been largely superseded by more modern standards such as XHTML.^[2] Modern\nphones have proper Web browsers, so they do not need WAP markup for\ncompatibility, and therefore, most are no longer able to render and display\npages written in WML, WAP's markup language.^[3]\n\nBefore the introduction of WAP, mobile service providers had limited\nopportunities to offer interactive data services, but needed interactivity to\nsupport Internet and Web applications such as email, stock prices, news and\nsports headlines. The Japanese i-mode system offered another major competing\nwireless data protocol.\n\n## Technical specifications[edit]\n\nOSI model by layer  \n---  \n7\\.

All the upper layers view WDP as\none and the same protocol, which has several \"technical realizations\" on top\nof other \"data bearers\" such as SMS, USSD, etc. On native IP bearers such as\nGPRS, UMTS packet-radio service, or PPP on top of a circuit-switched data\nconnection, WDP is in fact exactly UDP.\n\nWTLS, an optional layer, provides a public-key cryptography-based security\nmechanism similar to TLS.\n\nWTP provides transaction support (reliable request/response) adapted to the\nwireless world. WTP supports more effectively than TCP the problem of packet\nloss, which occurs commonly in 2G wireless technologies in most radio\nconditions, but is misinterpreted by TCP as network congestion.\n\nThis protocol suite allows a terminal to transmit requests that have an HTTP\nor HTTPS equivalent to a WAP gateway; the gateway translates requests into\nplain HTTP. WAP decks are delivered through a proxy which checks decks for WML\nsyntax correctness and consistency, which improves the user experience in\nresource-constrained mobile phones.^[6]\n\nThe Wireless Application Environment (WAE) space defines application-specific\nmarkup languages.\n\nFor WAP version 1.X, the primary language of the WAE is Wireless Markup\nLanguage (WML). In WAP 2.0, the primary markup language is XHTML Mobile\nProfile.\n\n### WAP Push[edit]\n\nWAP Push process\n\nWAP Push was incorporated into the specification to allow the WAP content to\nbe pushed to the mobile handset with minimal user intervention. A WAP Push is\nbasically a specially encoded message which includes a link to a WAP\naddress.^[7]\n\nWAP Push was specified on top of Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP); as such, it\ncan be delivered over any WDP-supported bearer, such as GPRS or SMS.^[8] Most\nGSM networks have a wide range of modified processors, but GPRS activation\nfrom the network is not generally supported, so WAP Push messages have to be\ndelivered on top of the SMS bearer.\n\nOn receiving a WAP Push, a WAP 1.2 (or later) -enabled handset will\nautomatically give the user the option to access the WAP content. This is also\nknown as WAP Push SI (Service Indication).^[8] A variant, known as WAP Push SL\n(Service Loading), directly opens the browser to display the WAP content,\nwithout user interaction. Since this behaviour raises security concerns, some\nhandsets handle WAP Push SL messages in the same way as SI, by providing user\ninteraction.\n\nThe network entity that processes WAP Pushes and delivers them over an IP or\nSMS Bearer is known as a Push Proxy Gateway (PPG).^[8]\n\nWAP provides content in the form of decks, which have several cards: decks are\nsimilar to HTML web pages as they are the unit of data transmission used by\nWAP and have their own unique URL, and cards are elements such as text or\nbuttons which can be seen by a user.^[9] WAP has URLs which can be typed into\nan address bar which is similar to URLs in HTTP. Relative URLs in WAP are used\nfor navigating within a deck, and Absolute URLs in WAP are used for navigating\nbetween decks.^[10] WAP was designed to operate in bandwidth-constrained\nnetworks by using data compression before transmitting data to users.^[11]\n\n### WAP 2.0[edit]\n\nA re-engineered 2.0 version was released in 2002. It uses a cut-down version\nof XHTML with end-to-end HTTP, dropping the gateway and custom protocol suite\nused to communicate with it. A WAP gateway can be used in conjunction with WAP\n2.0; however, in this scenario, it is used as a standard proxy server. The WAP\ngateway's role would then shift from one of translation to adding additional\ninformation to each request. This would be configured by the operator and\ncould include telephone numbers, location, billing information, and handset\ninformation.\n\nMobile devices process XHTML Mobile Profile (XHTML MP), the markup language\ndefined in WAP 2.0. It is a subset of XHTML and a superset of XHTML Basic. A\nversion of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) called WAP CSS is supported by XHTML\nMP.\n\n### MMS[edit]\n\nMain article: Multimedia Messaging Service\n\nMultimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a combination of WAP and SMS allowing\nfor sending of picture messages.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe WAP Forum was founded in 1998 by Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Unwired\nPlanet.^[12] It aimed primarily to bring together the various wireless\ntechnologies in a standardised protocol.^[13] In 2002, the WAP Forum was\nconsolidated (along with many other forums of the industry) into Open Mobile\nAlliance (OMA).^[14]\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\nThe first company to launch a WAP site was Dutch mobile phone operator Telfort\nBV in October 1999. The site was developed as a side project by Christopher\nBee and Euan McLeod and launched with the debut of the Nokia 7110. Marketers\nhyped WAP at the time of its introduction,^[15] leading users to expect WAP to\nhave the performance of fixed (non-mobile) Internet access. BT Cellnet, one of\nthe UK telecoms, ran an advertising campaign depicting a cartoon WAP user\nsurfing through a Neuromancer-like \"information space\".^[16] In terms of\nspeed, ease of use, appearance and interoperability, the reality fell far\nshort of expectations when the first handsets became available in\n1999.^[17]^[18] This led to the wide usage of sardonic phrases such as\n\"Worthless Application Protocol\",^[19] \"Wait And Pay\",^[20] and WAPlash.^[21]\n\nBetween 2003 and 2004 WAP made a stronger resurgence with the introduction of\nwireless services (such as Vodafone Live!, T-Mobile T-Zones and other easily\naccessible services). Operator revenues were generated by transfer of GPRS and\nUMTS data, which is a different business model than used by the traditional\nWeb sites and ISPs. According to the Mobile Data Association, WAP traffic in\nthe UK doubled from 2003 to 2004.^[22]\n\nBy the year 2013, WAP use had largely disappeared. Most major companies and\nwebsites have since retired from the use of WAP and it has not been a\nmainstream technology for web on mobile for a number of years.\n\nMost modern handset internet browsers now support full HTML, CSS, and most of\nJavaScript, and do not need to use any kind of WAP markup for webpage\ncompatibility. The list of handsets supporting HTML is extensive, and includes\nall Android handsets, all versions of the iPhone handset, all Blackberry\ndevices, all devices running Windows Phone, and many Nokia handsets.\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\nWAP saw major success in Japan. While the largest operator NTT DoCoMo did not\nuse WAP in favor of its in-house system i-mode, rival operators KDDI (au) and\nSoftBank Mobile (previously Vodafone Japan) both successfully deployed WAP\ntechnology. In particular, (au)'s chakuuta or chakumovie (ringtone song or\nringtone movie) services were based on WAP. Like in Europe, WAP and i-mode\nusage declined in the 2010s as HTML-capable smartphones became popular in\nJapan.\n\n### United States[edit]\n\nAdoption of WAP in the US suffered because many cell phone providers required\nseparate activation and additional fees for data support, and also because\ntelecommunications companies sought to limit data access to only approved data\nproviders operating under license of the signal carrier.^[citation needed]\n\nIn recognition of the problem, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\nissued an order on 31 July 2007 which mandated that licensees of the\n22-megahertz wide \"Upper 700 MHz C Block\" spectrum would have to implement a\nwireless platform which allows customers, device manufacturers, third-party\napplication developers, and others to use any device or application of their\nchoice when operating on this particular licensed network band.^[23]^[24]\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\nCommentators criticized several aspects of Wireless Markup Language (WML) and\nWAP. Technical criticisms include:\n\n  * The idiosyncratic WML language: WML cut users off from the conventional HTML Web, leaving only native WAP content and Web-to-WAP proxi-content available to WAP users. However, others argue^[who?] that technology at that stage would simply not have been able to give access to anything but custom-designed content which was the sole purpose of WAP and its simple, reduced complexity interface as the citizens of many nations are not connected to the web at the present time and have to use government funded and controlled portals to WAP and similar non-complex services.\n  * Under-specification of terminal requirements: The early WAP standards included many optional features and under-specified requirements, which meant that compliant devices would not necessarily interoperate properly. This resulted in great variability in the actual behavior of phones, principally because WAP-service implementers and mobile-phone manufacturers did not^[citation needed] obtain a copy of the standards or the correct hardware and the standard software modules. As an example, some phone models would not accept a page more than 1 Kb in size, and some would even crash. The user interface of devices was also underspecified: as an example, accesskeys (e.g., the ability to press '4' to access directly the fourth link in a list) were variously implemented depending on phone models (sometimes with the accesskey number automatically displayed by the browser next to the link, sometimes without it, and sometimes accesskeys were not implemented at all).\n  * Constrained user interface capabilities: Terminals with small black-and-white screens and few buttons, like the early WAP terminals, face difficulties in presenting a lot of information to their user, which compounded the other problems: one would have had to be extra careful in designing the user interface on such a resource-constrained device which was the real concept of WAP.\n  * Lack of good authoring tools: The problems above might have succumbed in the face of a WML authoring tool that would have allowed content providers to easily publish content that would interoperate flawlessly with many models, adapting the pages presented to the User-Agent type. However, the development kits which existed did not provide such a general capability. Developing for the web was easy: with a text editor and a web browser, anybody could get started, thanks also to the forgiving nature of most desktop browser rendering engines. By contrast, the stringent requirements of the WML specifications, the variability in terminals, and the demands of testing on various wireless terminals, along with the lack of widely available desktop authoring and emulation tools, considerably lengthened the time required to complete most projects. As of 2009^[update], however, with many mobile devices supporting XHTML, and programs such as Adobe Go Live and Dreamweaver offering improved web-authoring tools, it is becoming easier to create content, accessible by many new devices.\n  * Lack of user agent profiling tools: It quickly became nearly impossible for web hosts to determine if a request came from a mobile device, or from a larger more capable device. No useful profiling or database of device capabilities were built into the specifications in the unauthorized non-compliant products.^[citation needed]\n\nOther criticisms address the wireless carriers' particular implementations of\nWAP:\n\n  * Neglect of content providers: Some wireless carriers had assumed a \"build it and they will come\" strategy, meaning that they would just provide the transport of data as well as the terminals, and then wait for content providers to publish their services on the Internet and make their investment in WAP useful. However, content providers received little help or incentive to go through the complicated route of development. Others, notably in Japan (cf. below), had a more thorough dialogue with their content-provider community, which was then replicated in modern, more successful WAP services such as i-mode in Japan or the Gallery service in France.^[25]\n  * Lack of openness: Many wireless carriers sold their WAP services as \"open\", in that they allowed users to reach any service expressed in WML and published on the Internet. However, they also made sure that the first page that clients accessed was their own \"wireless portal\", which they controlled very closely.^[26] Some carriers also turned off editing or accessing the address bar in the device's browser. To facilitate users wanting to go off deck, an address bar on a form on a page linked off the hard coded home page was provided. It makes it easier for carriers to implement filtering of off deck WML sites by URLs or to disable the address bar in the future if the carrier decides to switch all users to a walled garden model. Given the difficulty in typing up fully qualified URLs on a phone keyboard, most users would give up going \"off portal\" or out of the walled garden; by not letting third parties put their own entries on the operators' wireless portal, some^[who?] contend that operators cut themselves off from a valuable opportunity. On the other hand, some operators^[which?] argue that their customers would have wanted them to manage the experience and, on such a constrained device, avoid giving access to too many services.^[citation needed]\n\n## Protocol design lessons from WAP[edit]\n\nThe original WAP model provided a simple platform for access to web-like WML\nservices and e-mail using mobile phones in Europe and the SE Asian regions. In\n2009 it continued to have a considerable user base. The later versions of WAP,\nprimarily targeting the United States market, were designed by Daniel Tilden\nof Bell Labs for a different requirement - to enable full web XHTML access\nusing mobile devices with a higher specification and cost, and with a higher\ndegree of software complexity.\n\nConsiderable discussion has addressed the question whether the WAP protocol\ndesign was appropriate.\n\nThe initial design of WAP specifically aimed at protocol independence across a\nrange of different protocols (SMS, IP over PPP over a circuit switched bearer,\nIP over GPRS, etc.). This has led to a protocol considerably more complex than\nan approach directly over IP might have caused.\n\nMost controversial, especially for many from the IP side, was the design of\nWAP over IP. WAP's transmission layer protocol, WTP, uses its own\nretransmission mechanisms over UDP to attempt to solve the problem of the\ninadequacy of TCP over high-packet-loss networks.^[citation needed]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * .mobi\n  * i-mode\n  * Mobile browser\n  * Mobile development\n  * Mobile web\n  * RuBee\n  * WAP Identity Module\n  * Wireless transaction protocol\n  * WURFL\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Sharma, Chetan; Nakamura, Yasuhisa (2003-11-20).
