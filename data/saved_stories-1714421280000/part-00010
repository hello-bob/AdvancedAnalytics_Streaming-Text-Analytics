We employ an empirical\napproach, using optical character recognition (OCR) software, which finds that\nmerely 93% of paint splatters parse as valid Perl. We analyze the properties\nof paint-splatter Perl programs, and present seven examples of paint splatters\nwhich are not valid Perl programs.\n\nAccepted for publication at SIGBOVIK 2019, held April 1st 2019 in Pittsburgh.\nWinner of a Unwitting Participation Ribbon, \u201can unwelcome brand we\u2019ve affixed\nto each paper determined after careful scrutiny to have included a genuine\nartifact, thereby furthering the admirable causes of open science and fruitful\nprocrastination.\u201d\n\nRead it on Google Docs or download a PDF. Or grab the entire SIGBOVIK 2019\nproceedings; I\u2019m on page 174.\n\n## Supplementary Materials\n\nHere\u2019s all the paint splatters on a single page, along with the valid Perl\nsource code corresponding to each. \u201cNot valid\u201d is written in red for those\nimages which did not parse as valid Perl programs. If different OCR settings\nrecognized multiple valid Perl programs, I chose the one that seemed the most\n\u201cinteresting\u201d, according to my own aesthetic sense.\n\nHere\u2019s a tarball of 100 paint-splatter images that were used as the main\ndataset for this paper.\n\n(source code not available yet because i am bad at GitHub)\n\n## Errata\n\nThere are a few paint splatter Perl programs that I didn\u2019t recognize as\n\u201cinteresting\u201d until after the SIGBOVIK submission deadline. For example, this\nsplatter is recognized by OCR as the string lerzfijglpFiji-j, which evaluates\nto the number 0 in Perl:\n\nThe image below is recognized as the string -*?, which also evaluates to the\nnumber 0 in Perl:\n\nAnother surprising program is shown below; OCR recognizes this image as the\nstring ;i;c;;#\\\\\\?z{;?;;fn':.;, which evaluates to the string c in Perl:\n\nFinally, this image is recognized as the string ;E,'__', which evaluates to\nthe string E__ in Perl:\n\n\u00a9 2023 Colin McMillen.
