Looking back, I now realize that this was the first serious step on my journey to Staff.\n  * April 2023 | I wrote A Staff (Support) Engineer\u2019s Path to summarize what I gleaned from the conversation and thought fostered by the book club.\n  * May 2023 | I created my promotion document, marking the formal beginning of the process.\n  * December 2023 | I submitted my promotion document.\n  * March 2024 | My promotion to Staff Support Engineer was announced.\n\nThe book club did a lot to help focus my thinking. During 2023, I feel like I\n\u201cbecame\u201d a Staff Support Engineer. I started to take on more strategic work. I\nworked to split my time between my own contributions and mentoring others.\nWhen opportunity knocked, I was ready and began to work cross-functionally to\nthe benefit of the GitLab Support team and the broader organization.\n\n## \u2728 Specific Things I am Glad I Did\n\nAdvice is just something that worked well for someone else. This is what\nworked for me:\n\n  * \ud83d\udcd3 Journal periodically.\n  * \ud83d\udee4 Track my work.\n  * \ud83d\udca1 Have an elevator pitch for my ideas and efforts.\n  * \ud83e\udd1d Remember that together is better.\n\n    * Watch Manu and I discuss our paths to promotion and the value of having a promotion buddy.\n  * \ud83d\udcf8 Think big picture: improve the approach to entire types of tickets. Don\u2019t just be satisfied with solving a single occurrence of the problem.\n  * \u2615\ufe0f Set up coffee chats.\n  * \ud83d\udc3e Iterate with intention.\n\nWhile these things served me well during the promotion process, they are also\nongoing practices. I have mentioned drawing inspiration from Cynthia Ng\npreviously and I recommend her notes on tracking one\u2019s work for performance\nreviews and promotions in particular.\n\n## \ud83d\udc4b Tips on Becoming Staff\n\n  * \ud83c\udf75 Expect to be \u201cT\u201d shaped, as other Staff Support Engineers at GitLab discuss in a May 2022 Group AMA on the role.\n\n    * Be helpful broadly. That includes knowing who the SMEs are and pointing folks in the right direction. Don\u2019t try to know it all or do all the things yourself.\n  * \u2764\ufe0f The full extent of your impact will not be known to you.\n\n    * Working to influence at scale means you\u2019ll have a direct and positive impact on someone with whom you are not familiar.\n  * \ud83e\udd84 Staff Support Engineers are like unicorn snowflakes. No two Staff Support Engineers are alike and that\u2019s a good thing. That can also be a very stressful and isolating thing.\n\n    * Remember that comparison is the thief of joy; be at peace with your own unique way of contributing to the team.\n  * \ud83c\udf40 Opportunity knocks but you won\u2019t know when or what it looks like. Have a plan (so you know what you\u2019re working on) but be flexible and ready to pivot when you hear the knock.\n\n## \ud83d\ude4b I\u2019ve been promoted: now what?\n\n> The move to Staff is on my mind but this section applies to newly promoted\n> folks in a variety of roles.\n\nI do not have all of the answers to this question. I do have a few thoughts\nbased on how I have navigated being promoted into new and exciting roles\nduring my years working in tech. Based on that general experience and the\nsituation in front of me today, here\u2019s how I plan to address the question\nabove:\n\n  * \ud83e\udec1 Breathe. You have some time to get your bearing.\n  * \u270c\ufe0f Keep doing what you have been doing.\n\n    * Why? That\u2019s what got you promoted in the first place.\n  * \ud83e\udd45 Set specific reasonable goals for your first X days in the role.\n  * \ud83d\udcbc Chat with your manager.\n\n    * Understand where they think you should focus.\n    * Understand the problems they face and how you fit into managing or solving those problems.\n  * i\ufe0f Use the job description to guide you.\n\n    * Even if it\u2019s not perfect or comprehensive, focus on the core responsibilities and expected outcomes.\n  * \ud83e\udd1d Help the team.\n\n    * Unblock. (That can sometimes be as simple as \u201cI would suggest checking in with soandso\u201d.)\n    * Think about solving types of problems that the team faces systemically (instead of just solving that problem once for a particular customer).\n\n\ud83d\udcaa We can do this! I\u2019ll be seeking to follow the path I\u2019ve laid out above over\nthe next few months. Let me know how things go for you in your new role: \ud83d\udcef\nbrie@infosec.exchange.\n\n## \ud83d\udc96 From the Heart\n\nA year ago, I wrote A Staff (Support) Engineer\u2019s Path shortly before creating\nmy promotion document. If I could go back in time to that version of myself,\nthese are a few kind, gentle things I would say to myself:\n\nEase your mind: during the process, it will feel like a difficult journey and\na long, long road. In the end, \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d is true of all things.\nEven when it feels like it, know that you are not totally alone. There are,\nhowever, some things you must bear and some decisions you must make alone.\n\n  * Plan your work; work your plan.\n  * Embrace uncertainty; expect change.\n\n\ud83e\udd81 You are far more ready than you think. Be bold: leap.\n\n## \ud83c\udf0c What\u2019s next?\n\nIn the time since I first started drafting this blog post, opportunity knocked\nin a very interesting and exciting way that I had not anticipated. As I\nwondered aloud on the /about page of this very site: who knows what the future\nholds?\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Only time will tell.\n\n\u2014 Brie \ud83c\udf08 \ud83e\udd84\n\n  * support\n  * engineer\n  * promotion\n  * reflection\n  * advice\n  * staff\n  * work\n\nShare:\n\n\ud83e\udd84 brie.dev\n\nSource\n\nMade with \ud83d\ude80 Astro and \ud83d\udc96 love.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
