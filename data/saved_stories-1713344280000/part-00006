What does the future hold and what actions can you\ntake now?\n\nget in touch\n\nOn 6th March 2024, the UK Government made a surprise announcement that they\nintend to abolish the 200-some year old non-dom regime and replace it in April\n2025 with a radically different regime and set of rules. This will have far\nreaching consequences, not only for those under the current regime, but in\nattracting investment into the UK.\n\nOur initial analysis of these announcements can be found here, where we\noutline the proposals and discuss the transitional arrangements, the impact on\nprotected trusts and the government's intention to move to a 'residence-based\nregime' for inheritance tax ('IHT').\n\nWith the new rules not coming into force until next April, the real question\nis who will be in power at that point to implement them? A new government,\nfollowing a general election (of which we await a date in 2024) may have its\nown ideas as to what a fair and competitive regime should look like.\n\nIn 2023, we prepared a report looking at the future of the existing non-dom\nregime by talking to non-doms and their advisors and we issued our own\nrecommendations for change. More information on that can be found by reading\nour report in full here.\n\nWe have also compared the UK's regime with a number of alternatives around the\nworld to look at each of their advantages.\n\nTo help you navigate this time of uncertainty, we will be providing regular\nupdates as and when draft legislation is published and would encourage you to\nreview your current position and to get in touch so we can advise on your\noptions to the extent possible at this stage.\n\nWhat are your options?\n\n# UK non-dom regime changes announced in the Spring Budget\n\nWatch our video to hear about some of the key highlights of the proposed non-\ndom changes which were announced on the 6 March.\n\n## Withers report: The UK's non-dom regime - time to reform rather than\nreplace?\n\nIn 2023 we commissioned a report by speaking to non-doms and their advisors to\nunderstand the practical aspects of whether the current regime functions for\nthem and where it fails to do so.\n\nDownload our report\n\n## Resources\n\nTo help you through this time of uncertainty, here are a number of resources:\n\n### How does the UK 'Non-Dom' regime compare to other European jurisdictions?\nPart 1\n\nFind out more\n\n### How does the UK 'Non-Dom' regime compare to other European jurisdictions?\nPart 2\n\nFind out more\n\n### A review of the tax regimes in Singapore and Hong Kong\n\nFind out more\n\n### Does the US offer an alternative to the UK regime?\n\nFind out more\n\n## Get in touch\n\n### Christopher Groves\n\nPartner | London\n\n### Christopher Groves\n\nPartner | London\n\nPrivate client and tax\n\nEmail Christopher\n\n+44 20 7597 6127\n\n### Ceri Vokes\n\nPartner | London\n\n### Ceri Vokes\n\nPartner | London\n\nPrivate client and tax\n\nEmail Ceri\n\n+44 20 7597 6288\n\n### Charlie Tee\n\nPartner | London\n\n### Charlie Tee\n\nPartner | London\n\nPrivate client and tax\n\nEmail Charlie\n\n+44 20 7597 6513\n\n### Justine Markovitz\n\nChairperson | Geneva\n\n### Justine Markovitz\n\nChairperson | Geneva\n\nPrivate client and tax\n\nEmail Justine\n\n+41 22 593 7711\n\n### Berry M.

He's the head of the\nprivate client business at Withers, the law firm that many of you will have\nheard of, of course, and he's based in London. Hello to you, Christopher.\n\nChristopher Groves: Hi, Tom.\n\nTom: Christopher, before we kick off into the subject of the non-dom system\nand the ideas of how to reform it, which is what Withers has recently done,\ncan I just briefly ask you about what your own position at the firm is and\nwhat you do?\n\nChristopher: I'm head of the private client team here in London. I'm a general\nprivate client practitioner, I'm a tax lawyer. I have a mixed practice dealing\nwith some purely UK people, but also a healthy contingent of resident non-\ndoms, the kind of people we're going to be talking about today.\n\nTom: Right. Well, that gives us a good opportunity to segue straight into the\nissue of non-doms. Withers recently produced a report setting out reform\nproposals. We know that there is a very real possibility, if you believe\nopinion polls, that we could have a change of government in this country\nwithin a year. The Labour Party wishes to get rid of the non-dom system. It\nhasn't, as far as I know, proposed any kind of alternative, although that may\nwell happen. So, just as a sort of a general starter point, can you tell me\nwhat you feel is at stake here? Why did the law firm feel it necessary to\nissue these reform proposals at the present time?\n\nChristopher: Well, Tom, I think our view was that the non-dom system, as it\ncurrently stands, has become too political to be sustainable. What we're\ntalking about is a regime that allows people to plan their lives, and that\nhappens on a long-term basis. We've had now the Labour Party go into the last\nthree or four elections - it's quite difficult to remember how many we've had\nrecently - but the last few elections saying they're going to get rid of the\nsystem or replace it, and that level of uncertainty hanging over someone's\nlife I think is ultimately untenable. We're not in the business of making\npredictions about who's going to win the next election, although all the smart\nmoney seems to be one way, but simply the level of uncertainty that is built\nin because one party, two parties, all but one party wants to get rid of the\nnon-dom remittance basis, then that puts a lot of pressure on the existing\nsystem. I think our view is that we've had these arrangements in place as long\nas we've had income tax, and in recent years we've seen increasing amounts of\ntinkering. And I think our view is that the whole system is ripe for reform,\nto step back and understand why we have this basis of taxation, what we're\ntrying to achieve by it, and how it should be targeted.\n\nTom: Let's look at a couple of details. Before we do the details, so one thing\nthat has to be taken into account is how any reformed system would fit or\ndovetail with other elements of policy that would be designed to encourage\ninward investment and inward flows of capital from high net worth individuals,\nwhether it be for reform to the currently now suspended tier one investor visa\nscheme, or things of that sort. How do you envisage any reformed non-dom\nsystem as being able to sort of link up in a coherent way with other kinds of\nideas to encourage that kind of activity?\n\nChristopher: I think that's the key point, Tom, isn't it? The non-dom system\nhas existed in its current form without really being targeted in any\nparticular way other than the way it is for historical reasons. But there are\nanother number of other ways in which we look to attract the people who create\nwealth, employment, who add to the British economy, to the country, and we\nneed to make sure the non-dom system ties in with that. So the immigration\nrules are a case in point and we have seen the removal of the tier one visa,\nthe investor visa, that was perceived as a way for people with access to large\namounts of capital to come to the UK without necessarily contributing much on\nthe ground. You compare that with the entrepreneur's visas, the working visas\nand you see a different class of people coming in there who have to make a\nmuch clearer contribution. I think that the non-dom system would also benefit\nfrom being better aligned with those same kinds of people. We also talk about\nthe UK being a holding company jurisdiction, looking for big corporates to\nbase their headquarters here, and the non-dom system as currently structured\nis more attractive to people who have wealth already rather than those who are\ncreating it. A regime that attracted workers to the UK, something along the\nlines of the Danish model may be very powerful in terms of strengthening the\nUK's economy.\n\nTom: Two specific points of detail, which I want to ask you about quite\nquickly. One is the annual flat fee and the raise to that, and also the 15\nyear point about a sort of cut-off period for the purposes of the remittance\nbasis. Can you just tell me about what your thinking is about both the level\nat which the remittance basis applies and also how long it applies for?\n\nChristopher: The annual fee is something that was first talked about by the\nTories when they were in last in opposition, and then was taken on by Gordon\nBrown. I think the world has moved on since it was brought in, and what we see\nin other jurisdictions is that where you are providing people certainties on\ntheir tax base, many people are in fact willing to pay a much higher annual\nfee than you would pay in the UK. In the UK you would pay nothing for the\nfirst seven years. In Italy you pay \u20ac150,000 from day one. You'll pay \u00a3250,000\npounds to live in Jersey each year. I think by any measure, the annual fee\nthat applies to the remittance basis is too low for the benefit it's giving.\n\nTom: Final point really here is, and we can take a bit more time with this,\nwhat would you hope to be the benefit overall of the reforms that you suggest,\nassuming that any government were to take them up? Obviously, there's one\nlevel, I mean, you've already alluded to the importance of certainty and the\nfact that we don't have certainty at the present time for the political\nreasons given, but what are the possible consequences, positive consequences\nno doubt you would hope would be the result of a reform if your ideas were to\nbe taken up.\n\nChristopher: I think the international lesson is very important here. There\nare a number of other countries bringing in these kind of regimes - Spain,\nItaly, Greece - they're all looking to attract people with simplified flat tax\nregimes. And that's the point of these regimes. Although, the Labour party may\ntalk about getting rid of the regime to increase the tax cake, that can only\nbe a temporary adjustment as people who are in the regime decide not to leave.\nThe real benefit of these regimes is attracting people to the UK who are going\nto contribute to the economy. And that's what we're seeing internationally.\nAnd that's the way we think the remittance basis needs to be focused and\ncharacterized as a regime to attract people who will bring more to the country\nthan simply the payment of tax on the standard basis. The wealth creators, the\nentrepreneurs, the business people who will bring economic activity here,\ncreate jobs and create tax revenues in that way.\n\nTom: What kind of response have you had, by the way, to your ideas, either at\nthe public level or anywhere else? Have you had any feedback from people that\nyou talk to in the policymaking world, what do they say to you?\n\nChristopher: There's been a lot of positive feedback so far. We've been very,\nvery heartened by the feedback we've got. I think though that everyone plays\ntheir cards very close to the chest at the moment. I don't think we have any\nillusions as to our links into government or the opposition parties, but I\nhope that we can contribute to this debate, because at the moment it's a very\none-sided one, a very simple one focused on we should abolish this regime, we\nshould replace it with something, and I think we'd have to contribute to what\nthat something should be.\n\nTom: Well, I think that that's sort of a mindset which I'm certainly hoping to\nsee a lot more of, not just on this topic but many others, as they affect\nissues like this going forward. Christopher, thank you very much indeed for\nyour time today and your comments and it goes without saying that the audience\nat WealthBriefing looks forward to seeing more analysis from Withers and\nindeed other firms of your type on these and related topics. It's very\nimportant that this debate continues in the spirit that you've set out today.\nThank you very much indeed, Christopher, and I look forward to speaking to you\nsoon.\n\nChristopher: Thanks, Tom. Great to speak to you.\n\nMaking UK's non-dom system fit for purpose\n\n# WealthBriefing\n\nChristopher Groves, Regional European Head of the Private Client and Tax at\nWithers, talks to Tom Burroughes, Group Editor at Family Wealth Report, about\nthe different reform options the UK government should consider as opposed to\nabolishing the existing non-dom regime.\n\n## External Publications\n\n#### SPEAR'S\n\nNon-doms and the general election: when should HNWs act?\n\n#### WEALTHBRIEFING\n\nDon't Scrap Non-Doms \u2013 Reform System Instead\n\n#### Law360\n\n'Non-dom' tax reforms should keep UK lawyers busy\n\n#### SPEAR'S\n\nIs this how to save the non-dom regime?\n\n#### INVESTMENT INTERNATIONAL\n\nInternational law firm Withers calls reform UK's dom regime\n\n#### Daily Telegraph\n\nNon-doms plot exodus in wake of Budget crackdown\n\n#### Family Capital\n\nThe doom loop for the wealthy in the UK\n\n#### Daily Telegraph\n\nThe countries welcoming Britain\u2019s spurned non-doms with open arms\n\n#### FINANCIAL TIMES\n\nLabour says it will \u2018modernise\u2019 UK non-dom tax regime\n\n#### DAILY TELEGRAPH\n\nBritain loses non-doms to Italy as Hunt plots tax crackdown\n\n### Your nearest location\n\n#### Padua\n\nPiazza dell'Insurrezione 1, 35137 Padova, Italy\n\n+39 049 65311\n\nenquiries.pd@withersworldwide.com\n\nView office View all offices\n\n  * About us\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n\n  * English\n  * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * Italiano\n  * P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n  * Espa\u00f1ol\n  * \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n  * \u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\n  * \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\n\nWithersworldwide\n\n  * About us\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n\nLanguages\n\n  * English\n  * Fran\u00e7ais\n  * Italiano\n  * P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n  * Espa\u00f1ol\n  * \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n  * \u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\n  * \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\n\nLatest updates by email\n\nTailor your preferences to receive regular, relevant insights and updates.
