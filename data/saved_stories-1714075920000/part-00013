The prognosis is not great.\n\nAnton Cebalo\n\nOct 23, 2022\n\n146\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Social Recession: By the Numbers\n\nnovum.substack.com\n\n72\n\nShare\n\nIntermission (also known as Intermedio) by Edward Hopper, 1963.\n\nOne of the most discussed topics online recently has been friendships and\nloneliness. Ever since the infamous study showing more people are not having\nsex than ever before first made the rounds, there\u2019s been increased interest in\nthe social state of things. Polling has demonstrated a marked decline in all\nspheres of social life, including close friends, intimate relationships,\ntrust, labor participation, and community involvement. The trend looks to have\nworsened since the pandemic, although it will take some years before this is\nclearly established.\n\nThe decline comes alongside a documented rise in mental illness, diseases of\ndespair, and poor health more generally. In August 2022, the CDC announced\nthat U.S. life expectancy has fallen further and is now where it was in 1996.\nContrast this to Western Europe, where it has largely rebounded to pre-\npandemic numbers. Still, even before the pandemic, the years 2015-2017 saw the\nlongest sustained decline in U.S. life expectancy since 1915-18. While my\nintended angle here is not health-related, general sociability is closely\nlinked to health. The ongoing shift has been called the \u201cfriendship recession\u201d\nor the \u201csocial recession.\u201d\n\nMy intention is not to present a list of miserable points, but to group them\ntogether in a meaningful context whose consequences are far-reaching. While\nmost of what I will outline here focuses on the United States, many of these\nsame trends are present elsewhere because its catalyst is primarily the\ninternet itself. With no signs of abating, a new kind of sociability has only\nstarted to affect what people ask of the world through the prism of\nthemselves.\n\nThe topic has directly or indirectly produced a whole genre of commentary from\nmany different perspectives. Many of them touch on the fact that the internet\nis not being built with pro-social ends in mind. Increasingly monopolized\nacross a few key entities, online life and its data have become the most\nsought-after commodity. The everyday person\u2019s attention has thus become the\nscarcest resource to be extracted. Other perspectives, often on the Left,\nstress economic precarity and the decline of public spaces as causes. Some of\nthese same criticisms have been adopted by the New Right, who additionally\nindict the culture at large for undermining traditions of sociality, be it\ngender norms or the family. Believing it disproportionately affects men, this\nposition has produced many lifestylist spinoffs: Men Going Their Own Way\n(MGTOW), trad-life nostalgia, inceldom, masculinist groups, and hustle culture\nwith a focus on 'beating the rat race.\u2019 All of these subcultures are symptoms\nof the social recession in some way, for better or worse.\n\nOften standing outside these developments are the self-described \u2018adults in\nthe room.\u2019 These are the professional media pundits, politicians, bureaucrats,\nand the like, largely disconnected from the problem themselves, but fixated on\nits potential to incubate political extremism. In the past few years, entire\ninstitutes have been set up to study, monitor, and surveil the internet\u2019s\nradicalizing tendencies buoyed by anti-social loneliness. The new buzzword\noften used in this sphere is \u201cstochastic terrorism\u201d and the need to contain\nsome unknown, dangerous element taking hold of the dispirited online. The goal\nhere is not to solve a pernicious problem, but instead to pacify its most\nflagrant outbursts.\n\nWe have no clear, comparative basis on which to judge what will emerge from\nthe growing number of people who feel lost, lonely or invisible. The closest\ncomparison comes from the early 20th century when, for the first time,\nmillions of provincial people moved to major cities to pursue their dreams.\nMany uprooted themselves then only to be poor and unfulfilled, who were later\neasily excited into a mania over mass politics and culture. That\u2019s why German\nnovelist Herman Broch in his story The Sleepwalkers (1930) writes his panorama\nof WWI as rooted in \u201cthe loneliness of I\u201d among three of his characters.\nLikewise, nobody cares for Gregor Samsa in Franz Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis\n(1915), who is compelled to go to work despite not even recognizing himself\nany longer. The alienated product of mass industrial society is familiarly\ndescribed in W.H. Auden\u2019s poem The Age of Anxiety (1948) \u2014 \u201cmiserable wicked\nme / how interesting I am.\u201d\n\nWhile data and polling have their limits, they are a useful starting point for\nconcretely discussing the social recession and whether it\u2019s here to stay. I\u2019ve\ncollected some numbers on the shift happening across a few key areas:\ncommunity, friendship, life milestones, relationships, and trust.\n\nIf this piece has been worth your time so far, please consider subscribing\n(it\u2019s free).\n\n###\n\nBy the Numbers \u2014 Community & Social Activities\n\nIn 2000, Bowling Alone by political scientist Robert D. Putnam was published\nto much praise for its breadth of research. The book documents the decline of\nsociability in the United States since the 1950s. It mainly traces the\ndwindling number of Americans frequenting civic organizations such as\nreligious services, volunteer work, sports clubs, hobbyist groups, and so on.\n\nThe book was one of the first to quantitatively determine that, yes, the\ntraditional American community was on the decline. It remains a staple within\npolitical science courses today. Yet, many of the metrics used in the study\nare today a bit dated. Even the title does not evoke the relevance it once did\n(not even bowling has been spared the decline of social activities). Moreover,\nin the year 2000, it was far easier to see the trend as \u2018fixable\u2019 because it\nwas not overwhelmingly determined by any one factor.\n\nPutnam\u2019s work is an assessment of social life of a different kind, before the\ninternet's mass adoption. That world is clearly never coming back. If we take\none metric commonly cited in the book, church membership, the decline Putnam\ndescribes is exceptionally mild compared to what came after.\n\nU.S. Church Membership Falls Below Majority for First Time (Gallup, 2021)\n\nRather than go through them one by one, Putnam\u2019s trends can be assessed more\ncontemporaneously through a simple metric: screen time, a proxy for time spent\nnot doing community activities in person. Rather than bowling alone, Americans\nare instead browsing alone over 7 hours daily on average and increasing every\nyear. As of 2021, some 31% of Americans claim to be online \u201calmost\nconstantly.\u201d The world Putnam is describing arguably does not register with\nthe same relevancy it once had.\n\n###\n\nFriendships\n\nIf we are browsing alone rather than bowling alone, the real metric to look at\nis friendships themselves. The past few decades have recorded a steep decline\nin people\u2019s circle of friends and a growing number of people who don\u2019t have\nany friends whatsoever. The number of Americans who claim to have \u201cno close\nfriends at all\u201d across all age groups now stands at around 12%, as per the\nSurvey Center on American Life.\n\n> The percentage of people who say they don\u2019t have a single close friend has\n> quadrupled in the past 30 years.1\n\nIt\u2019s been known that friendlessness is more common for men, but it is\nnonetheless affecting everyone. The general change since 1990 is illustrated\nbelow.\n\nTaken from Adrift: America in 100 Charts (2022), pg. 223. As a detail, note\nthe drastic drop of people with 10+ friends, now a small minority.\n\nThe State of American Friendship: Change, Challenges, and Loss (2021), pg. 7\n\nAlthough these studies are more general estimates of the entire population, it\nlooks worse when we focus exclusively on generations that are more digitally\nnative. When polling exclusively American millennials, a pre-pandemic 2019\nYouGov poll found 22% have \u201czero friends\u201d and 30% had \u201cno best friends.\u201d For\nthose born between 1997 to 2012 (Generation Z), there has been no widespread,\ncredible study done yet on this question \u2014 but if you\u2019re adjacent to internet\nspaces, you already intuitively grasp that these same online catalysts are\ndeepening for the next generation.\n\nLeave a comment\n\n###\n\nLife Milestones & Relationships\n\nThere have been many psychological profiles of \u201clate adulthood,\u201d common among\nthose born from the 1990s onward. Many of the milestones \u2014 getting a driver\u2019s\nlicense, moving out, dating, starting work, and so on \u2014 have been delayed for\nmany young adults.\n\nThe trend became obvious starting in the 2010s. In 2019, it was compiled in a\ncomprehensive study titled The Decline in Adult Activities Among U.S.\nAdolescents, 1976-2016.\n\nIllustrated by Axios (2017).\n\nThe same paper looked at how often high schoolers went out without their\nparents, showing a similar decline.\n\nThe Decline in Adult Activities Among U.S. Adolescents, 1976-2016 (2019)\n\nMuch of this is not necessarily \u201cbad\u201d, and it\u2019s more symptomatic than anything\nelse. It\u2019s therefore something of a mixed bag. For example, delayed adulthood\nis linked to less of a desire to engage in risky behavior like delinquency or\nexcess drinking. While risk avoidance may be preferable, it comes at the\nexpense of sociability. It is therefore bundled with other personal costs:\nmental health, for example, among people native to the internet continues to\nworsen amid an increase in so-called \u2018diseases of despair\u2019 in the United\nStates more generally. These were the leading causes of the drop in life\nexpectancy before the pandemic.\n\nFinally, there is the most-discussed stat of them all \u2014 the rapid increase of\npeople who have had no sexual relations since they turned 18, amid a time of\nunprecedented sex positivity no less. Writer Katherine Dee, who writes on the\nsubstack Default Friend, has flipped this common understanding and said that\nthe coming wave is one of disembodied \u2018sexual negativity\u2019 rather than free\nlove (just FYI, her article is paywalled).\n\nCompiled by /u/TheGoldenChampion\n\nThe results, though, are not unexpected. A disembodied, online life produces\nless physical intimacy despite mass culture presenting us with an image that\nsays otherwise. The stat went viral precisely because it showed what many were\nsuspecting and could now concretely confirm.\n\n###\n\nTrust\n\nOne last aspect missing from all this is trust. Trust is the building block of\nall sociability. The past 50 years have been nothing short of America\u2019s\ntransformation from a high-trust to a low-trust society, a collapse of\nauthority across all levels: social, political, and institutional.\n\nIn 2022, trust dropped to a new average low\u2014a development that has been the\ntrend since the 1970s.\n\nConfidence in U.S. Institutions Down; Average at New Low (Gallup, 2022)\n\nThe decline of trust in the United States across the board is a standalone\ntopic all on its own, already the subject of many books and investigations. I\nmention it here because trust is the social glue of any society. Regimes\ncrumble and collapse due to a lack of belief in themselves. A lack of trust in\ninstitutions makes for a lack of trust in other people as well.\n\nProtection, Progress, and Perseverance (2020), pg. 24\n\nAmericans' Trust in Themselves (2021). Although higher than the Pew Research\nfindings, the poll was more general rather than being on the public\u2019s\n\u201cpolitical wisdom.\u201d\n\nMost Americans do perceive that trust has diminished among the general\npopulation. The vast majority are \u201cworried about the declining level of trust\nin each other.\u201d Many also feel that they no longer recognize their own country\n(although this is likely caught up somewhat in political partisanship).\n\nThe state of personal trust (Pew Research Center, 2019).\n\nThe erosion of trust in the U.S. began decades ago after Watergate and the\nproceeding \u201cCrisis of Confidence\u201d during the 1970s. Still, it binds our\ncurrent time to a more familiar past cynicism. Skepticism toward the state has\nevolved into more generalized distrust toward society at large, amplified by\nthe internet.\n\nShare\n\n#\n\nThe New Individual\n\nThe data presented is enough to sketch out an archetype of the new individual,\na growing minority: one who is plugged in, dispirited and often feels\ninvisible. Carl Jung wrote that personal meaning comes \u201cwhen people feel they\nare living the symbolic life, that they are actors in the divine drama.\u201d In\nsuch a frayed sociality, the drama that would give one meaning closes. What\noften enters instead is nostalgia, exaggerated hatred, and the desire to be\nsaved.\n\nRight now, the dispirited are only beginning to agitate the political center\nwhich is led by mostly an older generation socialized in a different way. The\ncurrent U.S. government has been called the \u201coldest government in history.\u201d It\nfits the proper definition of a gerontocracy or \u2018rule of the old.\u2019 As of 2022,\nover 23% of Congress is over 70 years old, and the median age is 61.5.\nAmerican political power has so far only sporadically felt the effects of the\nnew individual at the ballot box, while at the same time chastising the public\nfor it. The politics of the social recession has therefore only really just\nstarted. Analyst Martin Gurri touches on this in his book The Revolt of The\nPublic and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium (2013). As he argues,\nthe digital public lacks a coherent program and is motivated by negation, and\nthe tearing down of idols and authority. We cannot expect the new individual\nto simply be contained to just his or her own alienation, pacified and alone.\nThat alienation will inform beliefs on how society itself should be organized\nand will be the substance of some future worldview, whatever it may be.\n\nAs a starting point for remedies, it should be admitted that this process\ncannot be entirely reverted nor can we expect political management from above\nto contain these asocial sentiments. The healthier alternative involves\nrethinking internet infrastructure on pro-social ends: platforms owned by the\npeople using them with community prerogatives in mind. I\u2019m not going to\npretend to know what that will look like since much of it has to happen\norganically. While the trends described here may be a \u201cnew normal\u201d in the\nsense that they cannot be reversed, I still think another healthier kind of\nonline community is imaginable. The internet does not need to be joined at the\nhip to a permanent social recession like it is now.\n\nThanks so much for reading. This took me some time to research and write.
