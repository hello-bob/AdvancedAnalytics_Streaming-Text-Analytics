Today, most people have forgotten about this common and tasty\nedible weed.\n\nDocks are perennial plants growing from taproots, and they are most often\nfound in neglected, disturbed ground like open fields and along roadsides.\nWhile docks may be happiest and tastiest when they grow with plenty of\nmoisture, the taproot indicates they are drought-tolerant plants. Docks grow\nas basal rosettes of foliage in early spring; they are often one of the first\ngreens to emerge. By late spring or early summer, dock produces tall flower\nstalks that bear copious amounts of seed, which are also edible. The seed,\nhowever, can be labor-intensive to process and reports on its palatability are\nhighly varied.\n\nThe foliage of mature dock plants may be from one to three feet tall,\ndepending on growing conditions, but in early spring, when it's at its most\ndelicious, the smaller plants may be hard to spot. Look for the tall, dark\nbrown, branched flower stalks that produced the prior year's seed crop. These\noften remain standing over winter and new growth will emerge from the base of\nthe stalk.\n\n## Which Docks Are Edible?\n\nThere are many edible docks, but curly dock and broad-leaved dock are the most\ncommon in the USA and Europe. Other edible docks include R. occidentalis\n(western dock), R. longifolius (yard dock), and R. stenphyllus (field dock).\nR. hymenosepalus (wild rhubarb) is common in the desert in the American\nSouthwest. It is larger and more succulent than many other docks. It has been\na traditional food and dye source for several Indigenous tribes.\n\nPatience dock (R. patientia) was once cultivated as a vegetable in both the\nUSA and Europe and is still grown as such by a small number of gardeners.\nPatience dock may be found as a feral plant. It's larger, more tender, and\nperhaps more delicious than any other dock plant. Seeds can be found for sale\nonline.\n\nOne of the best identification features for docks is the thin sheath that\ncovers the nodes where leaves emerge. This is called the ocrea, and it turns\nbrown as the plant ages. The condition of the ocrea may be a good indicator of\nhow tender and tasty that dock plant is. A second excellent identification\nfeature is the mucilaginous quality of the stems. Know that only young dock\nleaves are covered with mucilage.\n\nThe sour flavor of dock comes from oxalic acid, which, when consumed in large\nquantities, may cause kidney stones. The same compound is found in spinach. If\neating spinach is against physician's orders or for those who are prone to\nkidney stones, don't eat dock. Now, for those who are generally healthy and\ndon't eat large quantities of dock on a regular basis, it should be fine. For\nthose who are nervous about this, err on the side of caution.\n\n## Curly Dock\n\nCurly dock may also be called yellow dock, sour dock, or narrowleaf dock,\ndepending on where they are purchased. Common names are tricky for that very\nreason; they change from place to place. For those who need to know precisely\nand with absolute certainty which plant they're dealing with, use the\nbotanical Latin name.\n\n## How and When to Harvest\n\nBoth curly and broad-leaved dock are edible at several stages. The most tender\nleaves and the best lemon flavored ones come from young docks with flower\nstalks that have yet to develop. Pick two to six youngest of the leaves at the\ncenter of each clump. They may not even have fully unfurled, and they will be\nvery mucilaginous.\n\nFrom early to mid-spring, young leaves are tasty raw or cooked. If using raw\nleaves, avoid excessive mucilage by removing the leaf stem (petiole) and using\nonly the actual leaves in salads.\n\nThe midribs of large dock leaves can be tough and fibrous, while the leaf\nblade remains tender. If a plant with tasty foliage but tough midribs is\nfound, remove the midrib from the leaf before cooking. Additionally, larger\npetioles may be tough but pleasantly sour. Consider chopping the petioles into\nsmall pieces, and cooking them as a substitute for rhubarb or Japanese\nknotweed.\n\n## In the Kitchen\n\nLike so many greens, docks reduce in volume when cooked, by about 20 to 25\npercent of their original volume.\n\nBoil or saute dock greens to make the most of their flavor. They are excellent\nin stir-fries, soups, stews, egg dishes, and even cream cheese. There's\nsomething about the texture and flavor of the cooked dock that works\nwonderfully with dairy.\n\nBecause dock has a relatively short harvest season, like so many wild greens,\nharvest as much as you can when it's at its peak, then blanch and freeze for\nlater use. Dock is considered an invasive weed in fifteen states, so foraging\nprobably won't make a dent in the local population. Try vacuum sealing and\nfreezing a bag of dock for winter months when the promise of spring greens\nseems like a cruel culinary tease.\n\n  * Foraged Greens\n  * Foraging\n  * American Cooking Basics\n\nWhat Are Dandelions?
