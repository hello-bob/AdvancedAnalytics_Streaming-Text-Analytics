Follow Us\n\nOne of the most common explanations for why drivers won\u2019t pick an electric\nvehicle (EV) over a hybrid is charging. Specifically, owners don\u2019t want to\ncontend with range anxiety or lengthy charging stops. Still, recharge times\nare getting shorter and range longer. Better yet, Polestar says the production\nversion of its Precept concept car, the \u201cPolestar 5,\u201d will replenish its\nbattery from 10 to 80 percent in 10 minutes. It\u2019ll be one of the closest\nexperiences EV owners will get to refilling at a gas station.\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro Interior Design with Red Cockpit\n\nShare\n\nNext\n\nStay\n\n### The Polestar 5 promises to charge its 77-kWh battery pack from 10 percent\nto 80 percent in just 10 minutes with charging speeds of over 370 kW\n\nLuxury EVs are commonplace today. The Tesla Model S, Porsche Taycan, Lucid\nAir, Mercedes-Benz EQS. These nameplates continue to evolve, marrying posh\nopulence with fully electric applications. However, Polestar will drop its own\nnext-generation competition for these luxury BEVs with the Polestar 5. Better\nyet, Polestar promises record-breaking charging speeds with the 5 sedan.\n\nSpecifically, the Swedish luxury EV marque says a prototype of the Polestar 5\nmanaged to replenish 70 percent of its 77.0-kWh battery back, from 10 percent\nto 80 percent in just 10 minutes. To accomplish the feat, the prototype\nstarted charging at 310 kW and finished at above 370 kWh.\n\nPolestar 5 prototype | Polestar\n\nWhile the charging speeds are downright impressive, the consistent charge rate\nis similarly commendable. It\u2019s \u201cthe first time a complete battery pack has\nbeen tested in a fully functioning car, without showing the eventual power\nreduction typically seen during charging,\u201d Polestar\u2019s battery system chief\nengineer Jens Groot said of the prototype.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for luxury EV shoppers looking to minimize their time at the\nfast charging stations. Sure, you might be able to fill up your BMW 5 Series\nin a couple of minutes, but speeds like this lessen the gap between charging\nan EV and filling a gasoline tank. The Polestar 5 is expected to arrive as a\n2027 model and cost over $100,000, per Car and Driver.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Polestar 2 Is a Swede and Stylish Tesla Model 3 Rival\n\nBest in News\n\n#### Hero Barbers Rescue a Toddler Running Into Traffic\n\n#### Rimac Engineers Spied Testing Bugatti\u2019s New V16 Hybrid\n\n#### Ford EV Sales Continue to Bleed Big Money For the Blue Oval\n\nStaff Writer\n\n# Erik Sherman\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n\nErik Sherman joined the MotorBiscuit team as an Autos Writer in 2022.
