The mouse was ex-Bell Labs,\npreviously in the ownership of the late Jim McKie. I admired Jim and was very\nhappy to have the mouse purely as an artifact, but I\u2019ve also always wanted to\ntry using one...\n\nThe mouse has a male DE-9 connector. This might make you assume it speaks the\nsame serial mouse protocol we all knew and loved back in the 90s, but you\u2019d be\nwrong\u2013and the first hint should have been that it\u2019s a male connector, when all\nthose serial mice had female connectors.\n\nI had to post on the TUHS mailing list for help, but I was quickly pointed at\nthis page, which informed me that the mouse is one of those old-fashioned\ntypes which directly expose the outputs of their quadrature encoders over the\nconnector. The pinout is:\n\n  * Pin 1: +5V\n  * Pin 2: Y1 encoder\n  * Pin 3: Y2 encoder\n  * Pin 4: X1 encoder\n  * Pin 5: X2 encoder\n  * Pin 6: GND\n  * Pin 7: Middle mouse button\n  * Pin 8: Right mouse button\n  * Pin 9: Left mouse button\n\nUsing a DE-9 breakout adapter, I wired the mouse to an Arduino Pro Micro:\n\nGetting the software right took some work, primarily because I spent a lot of\ntime fooling around with some dumb code I got from Sparkfun. Once I threw that\naway and implemented some simple logic that just checks the falling edge on\none Y-axis pin and one X-axis pin and figures out the mouse direction at that\npoint, everything worked beautifully.\n\nThe code is at github.com/floren/depraz-arduino. I believe it should be\nsuitable for use with any quadrature mouse, provided you wire it up properly;\nif I can get my hands on an original Macintosh mouse, I\u2019ll see if my guess is\ncorrect.\n\nYou can see a demo below:\n\nHow is it to use? Well, I\u2019m still getting used to it, but it\u2019s definitely a\npleasant shape in the hand, and the buttons have a very satisfying clickiness\nto them. I intend to use it for a while on my work computer and see how I like\nit long-term.\n\n## Bonus: Old-fashioned Wine Capsules\n\nI opened the mouse up several times over the course of my experimentation. The\nfirst time, I immediately noticed two things: the red plastic shell was quite\nheavy just by itself, and that there was a big piece of duct tape on the\ninside of the shell.\n\nCurious, I peeled back the tape.\n\nAt first, I thought they were pieces of beer cans, but then I pulled some out\nand realized that they were wine capsules, the official name for those pieces\nof foil which go over the cork of a bottle of wine. It turns out that up into\nthe 1980s, these wine capsules were actually made of lead, not the lightweight\nfoil we get these days. Someone had put them inside the mouse, presumably to\nadd a bit more heft\u2013which I do find quite pleasant.\n\nI mentioned this on TUHS, and Norman Wilson soon replied that he may have been\nresponsible:\n\n    \n    \n    The mouse with wine-bottle lead foil in the top may have been my fault. I did that to two of them--at home and in my office--because I found a little more pressure made the ball track better.\n\nOf course it\u2019s not guaranteed that Norman once owned this mouse, but since he\ndid put wine capsules into two mice while working at Bell Labs, I\u2019m going to\nassume it was him. I now know more about the history of this mouse than most\ncars I\u2019ve owned...\n\nJohn Floren\n\n", "frontpage": false}
