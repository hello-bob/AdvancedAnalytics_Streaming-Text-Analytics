Because inevitably, somebody will respond: \u2018wait, I was confused, but I\nthink I\u2019ve figured it out: what you\u2019re calling a \u201cbar\u201d I know as a\n\u201cfrobnicated foo\u201d\u2019.\n\nA frobnicated foo is obviously a type of foo. So writing things like that\nalienates a core part of your audience: the people who have strong opinions on\nfrobnicated foos and thing they\u2019re great. That is, the people who agree with\nyou. But they will be put off when they read that foos are bad, and it will be\ndifficult to win them back.\n\n## Try to write things like this instead\n\n> Often, when people try to solve a problem, they employ a particular\n> approach. This approach is prone to problems; here is why an alternate\n> approach does not run into those problems.\n\nNames are difficult, and people frequently disagree on their meanings. Replace\npesky names with descriptions.\n\nAnd absolute statements (\u2018foo is always better than bar\u2019) are quite strong,\nand require an equally strong defense. It\u2019s not necessary to explicitly state\nan absolute, even if you think it holds. \u2018It might be better to use bar than\nfoo sometimes\u2019 is easier to defend than \u2018bar is better than foo\u2019, and it\u2019s\nusually more true.\n\n## This isn\u2019t redundant\n\nIf somebody already knows what a foo is, isn\u2019t it redundant, even patronising,\nto make them read a description of the problems foo solves and how it solves\nthem? It can be, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. The purpose of a description in\nthis case isn\u2019t just to be a definition-in-place-of-a-name. It\u2019s to frame the\nproblem, in a way that sets up the rest of your argument, and helps people\navoid preconceptions they may have about related names. Your argument should\nbe made in reference to your specific framing of the problem, not just in\nreference to the things that you expect people to know about foos.\n\nProviding context to your argument also means that it can be read and\nunderstood by more people, making it more accessible.\n\n## Have a good reason for complaining\n\nSimply spewing negativity into the void is not a good enough reason to publish\na complaint. There is enough negativity in the world as is. A complaint should\nhave a good reason for existing. In particular, if that reason is to convince\npeople that they should agree with you, then an overly acerbic tone may be\nunhelpful. And empathy always helps.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
