It marks the\nstart of new hardships, impacting families and communities.\n\nPart of that is due to a Florida law many people are unaware of, further\npunishing second-chance citizens, preventing them from truly moving on.\n\n## In-Depth:\n\n  * Stopped by a Dollar Sign\n  * Shelby's Story\n  * \"It's not a Mistake\"\n  * \"We Think it's Unconstitutional\"\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nIt's called \"pay-to-stay\", charging inmates for their prison stay, like a\nhotel they were forced to book. Florida law says that cost, $50 a day, is\nbased on the person's sentence. Even if they are released early, paying for a\ncell they no longer occupy, and regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nNot only can the state bill an inmate the $50 a day even after they are\nreleased, Florida can also impose a new bill on the next occupant of that bed,\npotentially allowing the state to double, triple, or quadruple charge for the\nsame bed.\n\nCritics call it unconstitutional. Shelby Hoffman calls it a hole with no\nladder to climb out.\n\n## Stopped by a dollar sign\n\n\"I work 12-hour shifts,\" Shelby Hoffman said, driving to work.\n\nHoffman is part of Tampa General Hospital Crystal River's clinical staff.\n\n\"The healthcare field has always been, you know, of great interest to me,\"\nHoffman said.\n\nShe's worked hard to get to where she's at, but wants more. Hoffman is on\ntrack to earn her Bachelor's degree this year.\n\n\u201cAt this point in my life with everything I\u2019ve been through, all my\nexperiences, my desirable goal is to work in case management,\" Hoffman said.\n\"As somebody who is in recovery, doing case management is my way of being part\nof the solution. And now, where I\u2019m at today, I\u2019m truly being stopped by one\nsingle barrier and it is a dollar sign.\"\n\nFlorida has what's called an \"exemption from disqualification\" for certain\nemployment opportunities. The state takes into consideration \"the time period\nthat has elapsed since the criminal incident, the nature of harm caused to the\nvictim, and any other evidence or circumstances indicating that you will not\npresent a danger working directly with children or vulnerable adults.\"\n\n\"They told me that you are not eligible. Because you owe over $127,000 for an\nincarceration fee from the State of Florida,\" Hoffman said. \u201cI cried. I was\nhysterically crying. I literally felt like my entire past just punched me in\nthe face.\u201d\n\n## Shelby's story\n\n\u201cWhen I was 13, my parents split up, so it caused a lot of dysfunction,\"\nHoffman said. \"It was honestly just one of those \u2014 I need to find something to\ndistract me. So I found a boyfriend that unfortunately got me hooked on\nopiates.\"\n\nWhen Hoffman was a teenager, she said she was \"snorting them, smoking them,\nand then eventually, you know, I started shooting them.\u201d\n\nAfter turning 18, she was charged for pawning a stolen item and burglary.\n\n\u201cBoth of those charges are drug-influenced, ever since, you know, 10 years\nago, I\u2019ve never caught another charge,\" Hoffman told the ABC Action News\nI-Team.\n\nShe told the judge in her case, she couldn't overcome addiction on her own.\n\n\u201cI told him, 'Listen, your honor, if you put me on the streets, I\u2019m gonna die.\nI need help,'\" she said.\n\nHoffman was sentenced to The Phoenix House for a year.\n\n\"There was another girl in there that was something she shouldn\u2019t have been\ndoing and instead of getting involved and doing what they asked, the director\nkicked me out. So technically that\u2019s failure to complete your terms of the\ncourts,\" Hoffman said.\n\nBecause of that, the judge sentenced Hoffman to seven years in prison. She\nserved 10 months after the judge allowed her to participate in a youth\noffender boot camp.\n\nWFTS\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, I had paid everything off, completed every term that was on\nthat paper, I petitioned the courts to get off of probation, he clapped for me\nand said you out of anybody deserve this, congratulations, Ms. Hoffman,\" she\nsaid. \"When I got released from prison, he wrote me a handwritten Christmas\ncard, telling me he knew I could do it.\u201d\n\nWithin three years, when applying for the exemption to work in case\nmanagement, her dream job is when Hoffman found out that she \u2014 like thousands\nof others \u2014 still owes the state $50 a day for the seven years of her original\nsentence: $127,750.\n\n\"I was completely shocked that a judge could modify every term in my packet,\nin my court case, but you charge me for a cell I didn\u2019t occupy?\" Hoffman said.\n\"I felt so tricked. And so fooled. There is no ladder with them. There is\nnothing that you can do. Apparently. That will ever truly allow you to be a\nsecond chance anything. There isn\u2019t. And they make sure of it.\u201d\n\nHear Shelby describe the process of learning about the fee\n\nShelby Hoffman describes the process of learning about the fee\n\n## \"It's not a mistake\"\n\nHoffman's grandmother, Linda, helped pay off what she said was thousands of\ndollars in other fines and fees.\n\n\u201cSo she can get a job, so she doesn\u2019t violate her probation,\" Linda said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been years and years and years. We thought everything was taken care of.\nAnd she\u2019s proved that she is a good member of society. So now, why is this\ntagging along behind her? I don\u2019t understand it. I thought it had to be a\nmistake. It\u2019s not a mistake.\u201d\n\n  * FL Department of Corrections simulation shows the challenges people face when released from prison\n\nHoffman hired an attorney in an attempt to modify her incarceration's costs to\nthe 10 months she was in prison. The judge denied the motion, pointing to\nstate law, saying, \"A court may not modify a legal sentence imposed by it more\nthan 60 days after the imposition,\" and, \"incarceration costs are 'based upon\nthe length of the sentence imposed by the court at the time of sentencing.'\"\n\u201cI\u2019ve been out of prison 7.5 years at this point. When I have trekked so hard\nto get a track record that I have now, and you are imposing something that I\ncan\u2019t pay off in a lifetime, so I am stuck,\" Hoffman said.\n\nFlorida Department of Corrections\n\nAn empty cell in a Florida prison\n\nI-Team Series | Crisis in Corrections\n\nLinda said her granddaughter is not alone.\n\n\u201cI had a mindset, because my dad was a federal prison guard, that you do the\ncrime, you know, you do the time,\" Linda said. \"But when I actually lived\nthrough this, I thought this is not the way it is, there is no compassion\nshown to anybody who makes a mistake and pays the price for it. And she did.\"\n\n## \"We think it's unconstitutional\"\n\nThe I-Team contacted the Fines & Fees Justice Center, based in Washington,\nD.C., to ask how state law can allow an individual to be charged for a cell\nthey did not occupy if they were released earlier than the time they were\nsentenced.\n\nLisa Foster, Co-Executive Director of the Fines &amp; Fees Justice Center,\nreplied, \"Well, we think it's unconstitutional.\"\n\nFoster pointed to the excessive fines clause \"because it\u2019s not proportionate\neither to the underlying offense or to a person\u2019s financial circumstances.\"\n\nShe said it's important for those who are unaware to know that the vast\nmajority of people in the criminal justice system are poor.\n\n\"Roughly 80% quality for the services of a public defender. That means, by\ndefinition, they are indigent,\" Foster said.\n\nFoster said the $120,000+ Hoffman owes to the state of Florida is \"a life\nsentence.\"\n\n\"It will be on her credit history, it will make it difficult for her to get a\njob, for her to get housing, to buy a car, or do anything else that she needs\nto do, to be able to return to society,\" Foster told the I-Team. \"They have a\nlien attached to anything you get in life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a family now, I have a daughter, a wonderful husband, I have a home, I\nhave all these accomplishments I\u2019ve worked so hard, so hard to maintain,\"\nHoffman said. \"To not to be given the opportunity to have a realistic,\nreasonable, obtainable goal to rectify all of that and to be done with it, so\nI can have a career and I can do the things that I want to do, I can\naccomplish all the goals that I have, that is why this is important. And\nsomebody needs to make these goals realistic for these people.\"\n\nSince 2019, Illinois and New Hampshire have repealed their \"pay-to-stay\" laws\nfor state prisons.\n\nThe Fines &amp; Fees Justice Center said, this last session, it worked with\nstate legislators on a bill that would have allowed judges to do an \"ability\nto pay assessment\" when imposing fines and fees. It failed.\n\nThis story started with a tip.
