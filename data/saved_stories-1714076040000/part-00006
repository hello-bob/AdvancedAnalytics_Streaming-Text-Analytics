Visco and originally\npublished in the June 1986 issue of Writers\u2019 Digest. The second set of rules\n(24-53) is derived from William Safire\u2019s Rules for Writers.\n\nMy several years in the word game have learnt me several rules:\n\n  1. Avoid Alliteration. Always.\n  2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.\n  3. Avoid cliches like the plague. (They\u2019re old hat.)\n  4. Employ the vernacular.\n  5. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.\n  6. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.\n  7. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.\n  8. Contractions aren\u2019t necessary.\n  9. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.\n  10. One should never generalize.\n  11. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \u201cI hate quotations. Tell me what you know.\u201d\n  12. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.\n  13. Don\u2019t be redundant; don\u2019t use more words than necessary; it\u2019s highly superfluous.\n  14. Profanity sucks.\n  15. Be more or less specific.\n  16. Understatement is always best.\n  17. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.\n  18. One word sentences? Eliminate.\n  19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.\n  20. The passive voice is to be avoided.\n  21. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.\n  22. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.\n  23. Who needs rhetorical questions?\n\n  24. Parenthetical words however must be enclosed in commas.\n  25. It behooves you to avoid archaic expressions.\n  26. Avoid archaeic spellings too.\n  27. Don\u2019t repeat yourself, or say again what you have said before.\n  28. Don\u2019t use commas, that, are not, necessary.\n  29. Do not use hyperbole; not one in a million can do it effectively.\n  30. Never use a big word when a diminutive alternative would suffice.\n  31. Subject and verb always has to agree.\n  32. Placing a comma between subject and predicate, is not correct.\n  33. Use youre spell chekker to avoid mispeling and to catch typograhpical errers.\n  34. Don\u2019t repeat yourself, or say again what you have said before.\n  35. Use the apostrophe in it\u2019s proper place and omit it when its not needed.\n  36. Don\u2019t never use no double negatives.\n  37. Poofread carefully to see if you any words out.\n  38. Hopefully, you will use words correctly, irregardless of how others use them.\n  39. Eschew obfuscation.\n  40. No sentence fragments.\n  41. Don\u2019t indulge in sesquipedalian lexicological constructions.\n  42. A writer must not shift your point of view.\n  43. Don\u2019t overuse exclamation marks!!\n  44. Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long sentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.\n  45. Writing carefully, dangling participles must be avoided.\n  46. If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a linking verb is.\n  47. Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.\n  48. Everyone should be careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.\n  49. Always pick on the correct idiom.\n  50. The adverb always follows the verb.\n  51. Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing metaphors.\n  52. If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be by rereading and editing.\n  53. And always be sure to finish what\n\n## Join the Plain Language Community of Practice\n\nLearn about upcoming events and training, plus get support and answers to\nPlain Language questions.\n\nJoin the Plain Language Community\n\nHelp us improve this site on GitHub\n\n#### Contact us\n\n  * Email us\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n\nplainlanguage.gov\n\nAn official website of the U.S. General Services Administration\n\n  * About GSA\n  * Accessibility statement\n\n  * FOIA requests\n  * No FEAR Act data\n\n  * Office of the Inspector General\n  * Performance reports\n\n  * Privacy policy\n\nLooking for U.S. government information and services?\n\nVisit USA.gov\n\n", "frontpage": false}
