Palmer, MD, MHS, transplant pulmonologist and Daniel F. Fortin, MD,\nDistinguished Professor of Medicine, says an \u201cincreasingly large number\u201d of\npatients who have received organs at Duke continue to do well a decade or more\nafter the procedure. Palmer, who is also vice chair for research in the Duke\nDepartment of Medicine, leads an NIH research project designed to help prevent\nlung transplant patients from experiencing chronic lung allograft dysfunction.\n\n\u201cWe have built a successful program over several decades that is one of the\nnational leaders in volume,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cSome of our patients are now 20 to\n25 years past the procedure. It\u2019s quite exceptional, quite wonderful, to\ncelebrate those individuals and their success.\u201d\n\nAmong the Duke recipients demonstrating exceptional longevity is Gary\nKlausner, a New York resident who underwent a double-lung transplant in 1998.\nBecause of complications associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), he received his\ntransplant at a relatively young age\u2014a factor that probably contributes to his\nlongevity, Palmer says.\n\n## A Patient's Story\n\nKlausner was diagnosed with CF at age 10. He was an active child and\nrelatively healthy young adult who managed his CF symptoms with medication and\nexercise. Though he experienced infections and CF-related physical\nlimitations, he was well known within the CF community as an activist who\npromoted research and treatment innovations.\n\nAt age 33, the soon-to-be father and NASDAQ trader, experienced extreme\nweakness and dyspnea that forced him to leave the trading floor. He was\ndiagnosed with Burkholderia cepacia complex, a bacterial infection that\nexacerbated CF symptoms and threatened his life.\n\n\u201cUntil that point, I had been relatively healthy. But it was like falling off\na cliff,\u201d Klausner remembers. \u201cI experienced a dramatic decline.\u201d Following\nhis hospitalization, Klausner returned home but required IV antibiotics and\nneeded 24/7 supplemental oxygen. \u201cThat\u2019s when our focus shifted to considering\ntransplant,\u201d he says.\n\n## Acceptance at Duke\n\nAlthough several programs declined to assess Klausner because of the\nBurkholderia cepacia infection, he was accepted by Duke in the late summer of\n1998. The move to Durham allowed Klausner to participate in respiratory\nconditioning and to ensure fast access to organs when they became available.\n\nWanting to be with his wife while she gave birth to their twin boys, Klausner\ndelayed the move, a decision that introduced additional risks. But double-lung\ntransplant was performed in December that year; he returned home the following\nspring.\n\nRefer a Patient\n\nTo make a referral, log in to Duke MedLink or call 919-613-7777.\n\nSolid Organ Transplant Referral Forms\n\n## Advocate for patients\n\nSince his recovery 25 years ago, Klausner continues to advocate and raise\nawareness for organ donation. \u201cI decided at the time that if I came out of\nthis, I would do my part to raise awareness,\u201d says Klausner who remembers a\ntime when he could not find a local network of supportive patients with the\nshared transplant experience.\n\nNow a successful professional in the health care industry, Klausner is a\nregional celebrity in Long Island. He participates in regional races and\nathletic events, was featured in Newsday on the 15th anniversary of his\ntransplant, and has been the subject of several print and electronic news\nfeatures promoting his transplant awareness activism.\n\nKlausner\u2019s long-term goal is to set the standard for longevity after\ntransplant. \u201cI told my son that I want to be the Tom Brady and Michael Jordan\nof transplant. I want to be the Greatest of All Time.\u201d\n\nThis G.O.A.T. will celebrate his 25th anniversary as he has his first 24 \u2013\npromoting organ donor awareness.\n\nShare:\n\nFacebook Twitter\n\n## Related Articles\n\nINTERDISCIPLINARY\n\nDuke Lung Transplant Center Leads Nation in Third Transplants\n\nArticle\n\nBy Tim Pittman\n\nTransplant\n\n$21M NIH Grant Extends National Lung Transplant Research\n\nArticle\n\nBy Tim Pittman\n\nStay Up to Date with Duke Health\n\nSign up to read more articles like this \u2014 delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nComplimentary CME\n\nDuke Health offers online Continuing Medical Education in several specialties.\n\nView All\n\n### Physicians Featured in this Article\n\nJohn M.
