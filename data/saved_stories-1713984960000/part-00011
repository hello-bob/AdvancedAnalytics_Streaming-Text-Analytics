For those born in 1944 it is about 75 years when they are 65 years old,\u201d\nsaid Wettstein, adding that while the study could not ask 65-year-olds born in\n1911 when they thought old age began, models suggest it would have been at 71.\n\nHowever, it seems perceptions are stabilising: while the team found people\nborn after 1935 perceived old age as beginning later in life than those born\nbetween 1911 and 1935, there was no noticeable difference between those born\nbetween 1936 and 1951 and those born between 1952 and 1974.\n\nFurther, as people get older, they revise the age they consider to be old\nupwards.\n\n\u201cThis could have to do with the fact that many people do not want to be old,\nso they postpone the onset of old age,\u201d said Wettstein, adding that that could\nbe related to age stereotypes.\n\nHowever, it seems those born in later cohorts shift the goalposts to a greater\nextent: while people born in 1944 revised their notion of old age upwards by\n1.9 years on ageing from 64 to 74, those born in 1934 shifted their view by\nless than a month between these ages.\n\nThe team add that while the perception of when old age begins was higher for\nwomen than men, and lower for those who had poor health or were more lonely,\nneither these factors nor education level or how old participants felt, fully\nexplained their findings.\n\nCaroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said it was well known that\npeople tended to judge \u201cold\u201d as meaning at least a few years beyond their\nchronological age, even in their 70s and 80s, and that probably reflects the\nbad image of \u201cold\u201d in western cultures.\n\n\u201cThis is a shame if it holds us back from living as full and happy lives as we\ncould and should in our later years, because of us self-limiting our\nactivities and aspirations,\u201d she said.\n\nInstead, Abrahams said the idea that we are \u201cas old as we feel\u201d is a lot more\nsupportive.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that chronological age is rarely a good proxy for anything and\nthe sooner we realise that in our society, the better,\u201d she said.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Ageing\n  * Older people\n  * Psychology\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### \u2018You\u2019re covered in wrinkles.
