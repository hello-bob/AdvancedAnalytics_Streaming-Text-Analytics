Over\nthe last century, the United States has radically changed how it answers this\nquestion when it comes to treating people with severe mental illnesses. Now we\nappear to be on the brink of another major change.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 20th century, America closed most of the country's mental\nhospitals. The policy has come to be known as deinstitutionalization. Today,\nit's increasingly blamed for the tragedy that thousands of mentally ill people\nsleep on our city streets. Wherever you may stand in that debate, the reform\nbegan with good intentions and arguably could have gone much differently with\nmore funding.\n\nIn October 1963, just weeks before he was assassinated, President John F.\nKennedy signed into law landmark legislation that aimed to transform mental\nhealthcare in the United States.\n\nFor decades, the United States had locked away people deemed to be mentally\nill in asylums. At their height, in 1955, these state-run psychiatric\nhospitals institutionalized a staggering 558,922 Americans.\n\nInvestigative journalists, government officials, and heartbreaking books like\n1962's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest exposed Americans to the horrors of the\nasylum system and sparked a movement for reform. Meanwhile, new\npharmaceuticals like chlorpromazine (also known as Thorazine) burst onto the\nscene, holding the promise to treat people with mental afflictions without the\nneed for around-the-clock supervision. The asylum system was a massive cost to\ntaxpayers, which helped reformers unite with fiscal conservatives to build a\ncoalition for change.\n\nFor President Kennedy, the movement to reform mental healthcare was personal.\nHis younger sister, Rosemary Kennedy, had been born with intellectual\ndisabilities \u2014 and her treatment is illustrative of some of the horrors of the\nasylum era. Kennedy's parents had spent years sending Rosemary to special\nclinics and allowing doctors to subject her to experiments, like injecting her\nfull of hormones as an adolescent. In 1941, surgeons convinced the Kennedy\npatriarch, Joseph Kennedy, of the need for a newfangled medical procedure: a\nlobotomy. The procedure involved cutting out part of Rosemary's brain.\n\nRosemary's surgery went terribly wrong (even for a lobotomy, which is now a\nmedically suspect and extremely rare procedure). The surgeons removed too much\nof her frontal lobe. In an instant Rosemary became completely disabled, losing\nthe ability to talk, walk, and control her bodily functions. Fearing\nembarrassment for his ambitious family, Joe Kennedy had his daughter\ninstitutionalized \u2014 and he kept his family and the public in the dark about\nwhat had really happened to her. It wasn't until 1958 when then-Senator John\nKennedy tracked down his sister and secretly paid her a visit. He was shocked\nby what he found.\n\nLike his sister, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who would go on to found the Special\nOlympics, President Kennedy was inspired by his sister to fight for a better\nfuture for people with mental disabilities. And so, in 1963, he signed into\nlaw the Community Mental Health Act. The bill provided funding for research\ninto mental disabilities and, more importantly, sought to dismantle the\nsprawling asylum system. It was the last bill Kennedy would sign into law.\n\n\"Under this legislation, custodial mental institutions will be replaced by\ntherapeutic centers,\" President Kennedy said when he signed the bill into law.\n\"It should be possible, within a decade of two, to reduce the number of\npatients in mental institutions by 50% or more.\" In fact, due to this law and\nother policy changes, by the 2000s, the number of people in asylums would end\nup plummeting over 90%.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of civil rights for mentally ill folks won a string of\nvictories in state legislatures and the courts that made it harder to detain\nand medicate people against their will.\n\nRather than locking them away in state-run psychiatric hospitals, Kennedy and\nother reformers hoped to give people with mental illnesses the freedom to live\nin their communities and receive care from local organizations. However, the\nCommunity Mental Health Act failed to provide enough funding for the 1,500\ncommunity health centers that lawmakers had initially envisioned. Congress\nleft much of the funding to the states, and, ultimately, only about half of\nthe health centers ended up being built and those that did end up getting\ncreated were largely underfunded.\n\nBoth in the 1960s as governor of California and in the 1980s as president,\nRonald Reagan was an important figure in cutting funding to community health\ncenters. But this was only one part of a broader \u2014 and bipartisan \u2014 set of\nactions and inactions that have led to collective neglect for this vulnerable\npopulation. One reason may be that people with mental disabilities aren't\nexactly a powerful voting bloc.\n\nToday, many of those who would historically be institutionalized in asylums\nare now instead incarcerated in jail, cycling in and out of emergency rooms,\nand living on the streets. Nowhere is this more clear than the city of Los\nAngeles, which has a swelling population of homeless people, many of whom\nsuffer from mental illness.\n\nIn a new book titled Sons, Daughters, and Sidewalk Psychotics, UC San Diego\nsociologist Neil Gong grapples with the system of mental healthcare that Los\nAngeles has adopted in the wake of the closure of asylums.\n\n\"With hindsight, the triumph of deinstitutionalization looks more like a\ntragic irony: an unlikely coalition of civil libertarian liberals and fiscal\nconservatives pushed for the destruction of an abusive and neglectful system\nthat had nonetheless housed, fed, and organized the lives of over half a\nmillion people,\" Gong writes.\n\n### A Crisis Within A Crisis\n\nAs we've covered before in this newsletter, research suggests that the\nhomelessness crisis in states like California is primarily a story about\nhousing supply and demand. There's not enough housing for folks who need it.\nMost of the people facing homelessness are not mentally ill.\n\nHowever, mental illness is a huge predictor of who becomes homeless \u2014 and\nespecially of who stays homeless for a long time. Research estimates that over\n20% of Americans experiencing homelessness \u2014 and a larger percentage of those\nexperiencing long-term homelessness \u2014 suffer from severe mental illnesses.\n\nGong calls the approach that cities like Los Angeles have taken to this\nproblem \"tolerant containment.\" Basically, the city tolerates things like\nencampments, bizarre behavior in public, and drug use as long as it's\ncontained in segregated areas that are mostly out of sight of the majority of\ncity residents.\n\nWhether you're a progressive or conservative, especially in California, it's\npretty universally accepted that this status quo is not working. It's both\ninhumane and also surprisingly expensive. Letting this at-risk population\nlanguish on the streets imposes a whole bunch of downstream taxpayer costs\nlike repeat emergency room visits, police work, crisis care, and incarceration\n\u2014 none of which measurably improve the long-term outcomes for this population.\nThe question is: what should we do now?\n\nMany progressives have advocated for a \"housing first\" solution to the problem\nof homelessness. Basically, they argue, instead of focusing on getting this\nat-risk population psychiatric help or rehab, the priority should be getting\nthem into stable housing first and then focusing on providing other services.\nHowever, Gong suggests, in Los Angeles and other cities, too often the focus\nhas become what you might call housing only. \"Because these public or\nnonprofit providers are under-resourced and understaffed, it kind of ends\nthere,\" Gong says. This policy sometimes can be effective, he says, but\nsometimes it means \"abandoning people to self-destruct.\"\n\nA randomized controlled trial conducted in Santa Clara, California, found that\nproviding chronically homeless folks with permanent housing and voluntary\nsupportive services had an 86% success rate in terms of keeping them from\nreturning to living on the streets. This and similar findings by other studies\nhave been hailed by advocates as a slam-dunk validation for the housing first\napproach to tackling homelessness. But, Gong says, it also suggests there's\nstill a sizable population \u2014 the remaining 14 percent \u2014 that need more than\njust housing and access to what's currently available to them for services. In\na state like California, which has a massive population of chronically\nunhoused people, an 86% success rate suggests there would still be thousands\nof people living on the streets.\n\n\"I do believe that if we are able to deliver the kind of community-based\nservices that were promised 60 years ago, we could whittle that number down,\"\nGong says.\n\nHowever, Gong acknowledges that, even with permanent housing and better\nquality social and psychiatric services, there would still be some small\npercentage of folks who would still wind up living on the streets. And for\nthose folks the government, he argues, may need to impose \"more assertive or\ncoerced treatment, including even, in some cases, longer-term in-patient\ncare.\" In other words, a modern, more humane version of a mental asylum or\nsomething similar.\n\nFor this population who gets forced treatment, Gong stresses, we really need\nto be careful. He cites research that this sort of compulsory care can be\nreally traumatizing for patients and even result in a greater risk of suicide.\n\"So one thing we really need to figure out how to do is to make the small\namount of forced treatment that we might need better.\"\n\n### Reinstitutionalization\n\nWe're now at a crossroads where there's a bipartisan movement for what you\nmight call reinstitutionalization. We're not going back to the horrors of\nlobotomies and forced sterilizations of the asylum era, but a growing number\nof Democrats and Republicans claim that it's now necessary to use greater\nforce to require treatment for mentally ill folks in the quest to end\nhomelessness.\n\nNew York City mayor Eric Adams has for the last couple years pursued a pilot\nprogram that gives the police and medical workers the power to involuntarily\nhospitalize the mentally ill.\n\nLate last year, former president Donald Trump posted a video on his campaign\nwebsite, remarking, \"When I am back in the White House, we will use every\ntool, lever, and authority to get the homeless off our streets.\" He continued:\n\"And for those who are severely mentally ill and deeply disturbed, we will\nbring them back to mental institutions, where they belong... with the goal of\nreintegrating them back into society once they are well enough to manage.\"\n\nRecently, California voters narrowly passed Proposition 1, which was\nchampioned by Governor Gavin Newsom. Groups like the ACLU opposed this ballot\nmeasure on the grounds that it would strip funds from community health\norganizations and \"primarily fund forced treatment and institutionalization.\"\n\nNeil Gong admits he's fearful that the pendulum is swinging back to a more\ndraconian and less humane approach to how we treat the mentally ill. \"I\ndefinitely worry that we're going to move to this kind of heavy-handed, lock-\npeople-up, get-them-outta-sight-in-the-cheapest-way-possible approach,\" Gong\nsays. But, he says, with so much apparent political will to do something about\nthe problem, he maintains hope we can build a better future for some of the\nmost vulnerable people in our society.\n\n  * Rosemary Kennedy\n  * deinstitutionalization\n  * John Kennedy\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### Economy\n\n#### Grocery prices, credit card debit, and your 401K (Two Indicators)\n\n##### Business\n\n#### Profiting off greater risk: the reinsurance game\n\n##### Economy\n\n#### What is a 'freedom economy'?\n\n##### Economy\n\n#### Why is insurance so expensive right now?
