For example, sweep netting captures\ninactive insects, while light traps do not work as well during the day as they\ndo during the night.\n\nThe researchers overcame this challenge by identifying studies that sampled\ninsects during the day and night with traps that specifically caught moving\ninsects, such as pitfall traps, flight interception traps, and aquatic drift\nnets.\n\nAfter meticulously combing through thousands of studies, they identified 99\nstudies spanning from 1959 to 2022, which had used these methods to document\ninsect activity patterns across diverse landscapes, from tropical jungles to\ntemperate forests, arid grasslands and aquatic ecosystems. The total number of\ninsects observed exceeded 3 million individuals.\n\nThe results of the study, published in the journal Nature Communications,\nreveal multiple ecological factors that shape insect activity patterns across\nthe globe.\n\nMultiple insect groups such as mayflies, caddisflies, moths, and earwigs, were\nfound to be more abundant during the night. Conversely, daytime saw increased\nactivity among thrips, bees, wasps, and ants.\n\nNocturnal activity was also more common in rivers and streams. In these\naquatic habitats, there could be twice as many insects active during the\nnight. In contrast, land-based insects generally had higher diurnal activity,\nespecially in grasslands and savannas, where the number of insects out and\nabout could triple during the day.\n\nCredit: Nicky Bay, provided, used with permission\n\nDr. Wong said these contrasting patterns in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems\nmay reflect strategies for predator avoidance. \"Fish tend to hunt aquatic\ninsects during the day, whereas nocturnal animals such as bats make life on\nland more hazardous at night.\"\n\nThe analysis also highlighted the influence of environmental factors, such as\ntemperature, on insect activity at the global scale. \"We found peak levels of\nnocturnal activity in the warmer regions of the world, as more insects likely\nsought refuge from the heat of the day,\" said Dr. Wong.\n\nHowever, the study also sounded a warning on the threats facing insects,\nemphasizing the importance of conservation efforts.\n\n\"Our findings point to the threat of global warming. In the hottest regions in\nthe world such as the tropics, the warming trend may further reduce the\nactivity of nocturnal insects that are already struggling to cope with heat.\nOn top of that, artificial lighting is detrimental to nocturnal insects,\ndisrupting their natural behaviors in ecosystems.\"\n\nInsects perform many vital \"ecosystem services\" such as pollination, nutrient\ncycling and pest control. Many of these services may be provided at night,\nwhen more insects are active.\n\nDr. Wong spoke to the lasting value of ecological fieldwork to better\nunderstand insect activity patterns. \"Such research can be exhausting, as\ntraps need to be installed and replaced multiple times over days and nights,\nacross many different locations.\n\n\"But it is absolutely indispensable. Insects are among the most diverse and\nimportant organisms on our planet, and studying their intricate rhythms\nrepresents not just a scientific endeavor, but an imperative for conserving\nbiodiversity on a rapidly changing planet.\"\n\nMore information: Mark K.
