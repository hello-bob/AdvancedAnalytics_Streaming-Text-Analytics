On one side you want to\nprotect your users' accounts. On the other side, you're dealing with users who\nset their passwords to \"password\" and wonder why their bank accounts are\nsuddenly funding a llama sanctuary or buying Robux.\n\nPasswords should be easy. And yet they aren't. Now it's more complicated than\never to balance security, ease of use, and like wtf is OAuth... amiright?\n\nJanuary 2012\n\n3900 BCE\n\n## Encryption - Ciphers & Cryptography\n\nThe first recorded instance of encryption was in Menet Khufu, an ancient city\nthat bordered the Nile. Researchers have found inscriptions inside the tomb of\nEgyptian Noble Khnumhotep II, who lived around 3900 years ago. The scribe used\na simple code of hieroglyphic substitution, changing one symbol for another to\nobscure the meaning of the inscriptions.\n\nThe message conceals a formula for pottery glaze which was used on clay\ntablets\n\nJanuary 2012\n\n753 BC - 27 BC\n\n## Authentication - Roman Watchwords\n\nThe ancient Romans would utilize passwords through watchwords. The city guards\nwould transcribe a nightly password on a wooden plank, and if someone didn\u2019t\nknow the watchword upon arrival at the gate they would not be permitted to\nenter.\n\nWatch Video\n\nJanuary 2012\n\n1920s\n\n## Speakeasy Code Words\n\nOn January 17th, 1920 the United States banned alcohol in a period called\nProhibition. People created speakeasies, illegal drinking establishments that\nflew under the radar. To stay open in secret, speakeasies used code words to\nallow entry, similar to the Romans thousands of years prior. Some keywords\nincluded \u201cswordfish, open sesame, and 42\u201d\n\nJanuary 2012\n\n1960s\n\n## First Demonstrated Online Password\n\nFernando Corbato demonstrated the first password in an online system in 1961\nfor the MIT Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS) (at MIT). Using a password\nfelt like a straightforward solution to allow individual users to keep a\nprivate set of files.\n\nThe passwords would also limit the amount of time that they could spend on the\nsystem.\n\nIn 1966, graduate student Allan Scherr, fed up with the limits on his time\navailable on his computer time, discovered he could print out the master\npassword file on the system so that he could access other user accounts. And\nthus, the first password was hacked.\n\nCurious if your passwords have been exposed?\n\nCheck out haveibeenpwned.com\n\nJanuary 2012\n\n1970s\n\n## Unencrypted Password\n\nEarlier versions of Unix used a password file, `/etc/passwd` to store all\naccount information on a user, including hashed passwords. This data could be\ndisplayed by running cat /etc/passwd.\n\nIn the 1970s salts were introduced. They make it more difficult for\nunauthorized users to determine the plain text value of passwords in the\n/etc/passwd file by adding extra complexity to passwords before they are\nhashed and stored.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, password security was further enhanced by storing the\npassword hashes separately in a file readable only by root called /etc/shadow.\nAnd now you relive the glory days of poor password security by getting a $cat\n/etc/passwd shirt for free by downloading and installing FusionAuth!\n\nJanuary 2012\n\n1976\n\n## Public Key Cryptography\n\nAsymmetric cryptography, or public key infrastructure (PKI) emerged as a\nsecure authentication technique. PKI was initially classified, and became\npublic in the early 1990s, playing a big role in authentication.\n\nJanuary 2012\n\n1980s\n\n## \u201cPasswords\u201d Make the Mainstream\n\nIn the 1980s, as passwords made the mainstream, so did the rise in hacking.\nThe scope of the problem was so great that in 1985 the U.S. Department of\nDefense recommended the creation of the Department of Defense Password\nManagement.\n\nAt that time, an eight character password containing letters and numbers could\nwithstand six months of attack over a 300-baud modem.\n\nJanuary 2012\n\n1984\n\n## One-time Passwords\n\nOne time passwords were developed by Leslie Lamport in 1984, an early example\nof passwordless authentication.\n\nJanuary 2012\n\n1994\n\n## The World Wide Web Consortium\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT/LCS to\n\u201cshepherd the web, by developing open web standards.\u201d\n\nJanuary 2012\n\n2019\n\n## WebAuthn is Created\n\nThe Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) is developed and recommended by the W3C\nto strongly authenticate users through an authenticator, such as platform\nauthenticators, roaming authenticators, or Near Field Communications (NFC).\nLogging in through a device is commonly referred to as using a passkey.\n\nJanuary 2012\n\nToday\n\n## Passwords on the Brink of Extinction\n\nPasswords are more vulnerable than ever. In 2023, any six character password\nstring containing any mix of letters, numbers, and symbols was susceptible to\nbeing brute force hacked instantly.\n\nAs the problem grows, platforms are requiring more complex passwords, adding\nlayers on top passwords, or dropping passwords altogether for other methods,\nincluding multi-factor authentication, social sign on, passkeys, and more.\nWorld Password Day was created in 2013 by Intel to raise awareness about\npassword security, and why it\u2019s so harmful to businesses and developers.\n\nAs developers, you have more considerations than ever \u2013 you don\u2019t want your\nusers to feel like they are playing the password game when creating an\naccount, after all, do you?\n\nSo, dear developers, let\u2019s raise our coffee mugs (or beer glasses) to World\nPassword Day. May your code be bug-free, your APIs RESTful, and hope that your\nusers enjoy a password free future.\n\nIf all goes well, hopefully you won\u2019t have to answer any more questions from\nyour parents on how to reset their passwords or use a \u201cpassword manager\u201d.\n\n## Important Password Statistics You Should Know by 2024\n\n### 81%\n\nOf company data breaches are caused by weak passwords.\n\n### 555M+\n\nStolen passwords on the dark web since 2017.\n\n### 99.9%\n\nAttacks blocked by multi-factor authentication.\n\n### 336M\n\nUsers affected by a Twitter Bug.\n\n## The Future is Passwordless\n\nIf you are looking to modernize your login experience, check out these\nresources we\u2019ve put together:\n\nWebinar\n\n### Passkeys Unlocked\n\nDon't get left in the dust with passwords.
