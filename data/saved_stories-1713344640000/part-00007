My schedule is just forming up\nas of this writing, so I currently have many time slots available. Most\nAR/VR/MR-specific companies exhibiting publicly will be in LVCC Central Hall\nor the Venetian like last year. While I am primarily there to meet with\ncompanies and see products, I always have some time to meet with blog fans.\n\nI will also attend the SPIE AR/MR/VR conference from January 29th through the\n31st. It is much easier to meet at this conference as everything is in one\nbuilding for the conference and exhibits.\n\nIf you want to meet up with me at either event, please email me at\nmeet@kgontech.com\n\n## Introduction\n\nHumane AI (Humane, hereafter) combines the mid-2010s failed concept of using a\nlaser projector to project on the body with the early 2000s failed projector\nphone (something I wrote about in 2013), only they left out the phone\u2019s flat\npanel display and have more feeble processing than a good smartphone. Rational\npeople wonder what this does that a good smartphone can\u2019t do much better, and\nyou can count me as one of these people.\n\nThis blog has been written about various laser projector scams since the\nbeginning of 2011. Scammers like to associate \u201claser\u201d with near-mystic powers\nthat violate all the laws of physics and rational thought. The other favorite\nword to deceive people is \u201cHologram\u201d (when they are not). The new favorite\nbuzzword is \u201cAI .\u201d\n\nIt looks like Humane started with an abysmally poor-quality laser projector in\na phone-like device, and by saying it does \u201cAI,\u201d it is magically something\nnew. Their picture was good enough to raise $230 million from SK Networks\n(Korea), Microsoft, LG, Volvo, Qualcomm, Open AI founder Sam Alman, and\nothers. Granted, with so many big-name companies, the stakes were chump change\nfor each giant company giant, but it does show foolishness on a grand scale.\n\n## Humane Adds AI to the Laser Projection (Hype Squared)\n\nAt first glance, Human AI looks like it started with a monochrome laser\nprojector, and realizing that that wouldn\u2019t sell venture capital companies\n(VCs), they wrapped it in the current hype surrounding AI. Humane co-founders\nBethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri (left) have the \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d black shirt\ncostume down like other famous Silicon Valley scammers, Elizabeth Holmes,\nfounder of Theranos, Sam Bankman-Fried founder of FTX, and Ronnie Abovitz,\nfounder of Magic Leap. I have learned to be suspicious of the Steve Jobs\npretender look through the years; it\u2019s not a complete tell, but it should make\nyou suspicious.\n\nHumane AI Founders (left), Elizabeth Holmes, San Bankman-Fried, Ronnie\nAbovitz, and Steve Jobs\n\nThis blog has documented for over 12 years how laser scanning is a terrible\nway to generate a display image. In short, the scanning process is too slow\nand inaccurate to generate a high-resolution image, and the lasers can\u2019t be\ncontrolled fast and accurately enough to give good color depth, not to mention\nthe poor power efficiency.\n\n### The fundamental problems with pico projection include:\n\n1\\. Where will you project from? Humane\u2019s \u201cbig concept\u201d is that they will\nmagnetically pin the projector to your shirt or jacket, ignoring that it will\nsag a normal shirt and flop around as one moves. For the Humane\u2019s introduction\nvideo, they pinned it on a heavy leather (or leather-like) jacket to give\nsupport (what do you do in the summer?).\n\n2\\. What and where will you project on? Humane\u2019s \u201cbig concept,\u201d taken from\nlaser projector scams of the past (more on this later), is to project on the\nskin. But the skin is a lousy, non-smooth projection screen with crevices and\npoor reflective qualities. Worse yet, it requires a person to hold their hand\nup wherever the projector happens to be pointing as it flops around hanging on\nyour \u201cshirt.\u201d Unlike a phone display, you can hold where you want or sit down.\n\n3\\. Ambient light is the biggest killer for pico projectors due to the loss of\ncontrast. Humane has not specified the projector\u2019s brightness (in lumens), but\nit has a class 2 laser, so it can\u2019t be that bright when projecting an image\ncompared to the brightness of daylight. Humane demonstration videos are\n\u201cstaged\u201d to put the hand\u2019s projection surface in shadow or a dark environment.\nThe Humane display is guaranteed to be invisible in outdoor daylight, about\n100 times brighter than typical indoor lighting. Unlike flat panel displays\nthat absorb ambient light, projection displays directly compete with it.\n\n4\\. Humane\u2019s projector lacks color and grayscale depth. Humane\u2019s display a\nmonochrome cyan (blue-green). There is no ability to even highly anything with\ncolor. Secondly, they demonstrated very limited grayscale depth; they showed\njust \u201con,\u201d \u201coff,\u201d and a half-level. Even if grayscale is theoretically\npossible with the Humane projector, the ability fo see a grayscale image is\nseverely hampered by using skin as a screen and the lack of contrast due to\nambient light.\n\n5\\. Laser projection\u2019s focus-free is a double-edged sword. While using laser\nscanning allows the projected image to be \u201cfocus-free,\u201d it also means that the\nsmallest objects blocking the projected image cast a harsh shadow blocking\npart of the image.\n\n### Humane\u2019s Poor Image Quality & 720p Resolution Lie\n\nHuman claims to have a 720p (1280 x 720 pixel) monochrome resolution. All\nlaser projector resolution claims I have seen through the years lie about\ntheir resolution, typically by about 2x horizontally and vertically. But\nHumane seems to have topped them by claiming about 4x of the horizontal and\nvertical resolution they can deliver. A picture of a 502- x 410-pixel Apple\nWatch Ultra 2 is on the right. Humane\u2019s image quality is worse than a cheap\n1960s B&W TV (see the series of pictures below).\n\nHumane\u2019s website and other promotional material have a series of fake still\nimages (\u201cPhotoshopped\u201d images overlayed on hands). While even these pictures\nare pretty low-resolution (much less than a true 720p image), they turn out to\nbe much better than what is seen in the videos of the Humane projector. I fear\nthat AI will soon make it easy to make fake images and videos that are less\nobvious, but these fakes from Humane did not use its \u201cAI\u201d technology.\n\nThe images below are still frames from the Humane Introduction Video, \u201cThis is\nthe Humane Ai Pin.\u201d In addition to the lower resolution and contrast than the\nfake stills above. Notice how the crevices in the skin break up the image and\ndon\u2019t just darken it. In the the third from the left still below, the hand has\nbeen turned upward, catching more light (but nothing compared to a bright room\nor sunlight); notice how the image looks even more faded due to the ambient\nlight.\n\nThe second set of video stills is from a demonstration by Bethany Bongiorno,\nHumane Cofounder. These videos were taken in a much darker environment, so the\ncontrast of the projection is better. I want to see a demo in daylight (not in\nthe shade). This video also shows how awkward it is to use your hand as a\ndisplay screen and a controller and how the hand blocks the image.\n\n### But, but, but, it is all about voice recognition and speech.\n\nVoice recognition has been on smartphones for about a decade with Siri (2011)\nand Alexa (2014). People have all experienced the good and bad of voice input\nand output. Certainly, voice can be a good adjunct input, but it can also be\nvery frustrating and difficult to correct when it does not understand you\ncorrectly. AI will likely improve the recognition, but it will not be perfect.\nIn many situations, voice input is insecure, disruptive, and/or impractical\n(due to, say, noise or wind). What is one supposed to do with the Humane\ndevice in such situations?\n\nHumane\u2019s introduction video was a fiasco in that it highlighted the combined\nvoice and image recognition problems. The founders looked stilted, trying to\ntime everything and speaking slowly with preplanned questions to the \u201cAI\nengine,\u201d and sometimes the device gave erroneous answers. When asked about the\nbest place to see the next solar eclipse, it gave a location too far south,\nand when asked to estimate how much protein is in a small number of almonds,\nit said that \u201chalf a cup has 15 grams.\u201d A spokesperson for Humane has\nresponded that it got the date correct on the eclipse but that the location\nwas a \u201cbug\u201d and that while the \u201cAI\u201d missed the question\u2019s intent on the\nalmonds, the answer was technically correct on the grams per cup.\n\nThe AI answered like Cliff Clavin (bar know-it-all from the TV series Cheers\nwho constantly gave erroneous information but showed full confidence in what\nhe was saying \u2013 example, video clip). Apple uses \u201cSiri\u201d to trigger their audio\nresponse; maybe Humane could use \u201cCliff.\u201d\n\nJust for fun, I asked my iPhone\u2019s Siri, \u201cWhere is the best place to watch the\nnext solar eclipse?\u201d and it came back with a series of links to articles (that\nincluded color pictures and maps) that I could scroll through on my phone but\nwould never be able to read on Humane\u2019s terrible display or would want read\nback to me.\n\nIn the real world, speech recognition is much more complex than Humane\u2019s\nsimplistic examples. The environment is going to be more complex and often\nnoisy. When speaking, people are not careful to say each word clearly,\nparticularly when they have to whisper to avoid disturbing the people around\nthem too much. As has been widely discussed, AI will often answer questions\nwith wrong information.\n\n## Old Scam with Slightly New Twist\n\nBack in the days before Streaming, DVDs, and VHS tapes, the Disney company\nfound they could rerelease their animated features every seven years, and a\nnew generation of kids would think they were new. Disney then followed a\nsimilar pattern and put their VHS and later DVD releases in the \u201cDisney Vault\u201d\nbetween rereleases.\n\nThis pattern of letting memories fade away before reintroducing them as \u201cnew\u201d\nalso holds in high-tech. In 2016, this blog wrote about eyeHand in Wrist\nProjector Scams \u2013 Ritot, Cicret, the new eyeHand. These companies showed some\ncomically bad fake images that included \u201cprojecting black,\u201d violating all laws\nof physics.\n\nThe scams by the small companies got big companies like Dell and Hilton to buy\ninto the scammer\u2019s marketing hype, and they released several \u201cconcept videos\u201d\nseemingly based on these scams (see below from that same article).\n\nIn 2018, Haier and ASU revisited the concept (see the 2018 CES Haier Laser\nProjector Watch \u2013 (Wrist Projector Scams Revisited)). Haier showed a prototype\nat CES 2018, enabling me to photograph the difference between the less\nobviously fake images and their real appearance (see article for more\ndetails).\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOnce you get past the contrived demonstrations and crappy displays, Humane\u2019s\nproblem is convincing real people that what they have is better than a\nsmartphone. A modern smartphone has a better onboard processor and, orders of\nmagnitude, a better display, supports audio and video input, and can\ncommunicate with the internet for AI or related speech recognition and\nanswers. A phone does not force one to wear clothes that will be able to\nsupport it or make me hold my hand out to see a crappy image.\n\nFew will believe a startup company has better speech recognition and\ninformation database technology than Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other giant\ncompanies. If Humane really had better technology, why didn\u2019t they release it\nas a software application rather than developing this terrible device?\n\nHumane has no advantages and massive disadvantages compared to a smartphone,\nand it seems most people in technology have come to the same conclusion based\non my reading of the responses. There are a few \u201ceveryone gets a trophy\u201d and\n\u201canything is possible\u201d people who have an open (or empty?) mind to this\nconcept.\n\nHow so many business people could get their companies to fork over a combined\n$230M confounds me. I\u2019m waiting for the AI program that can explain it . . .\nNot really; it is probably a combination of ego, unwillingness to do good due\ndiligence, and fear of missing out (FOMO), all very human problems. These same\n\u201cbusinesspeople\u201d will run most startups through the wringer for a few million\nin VC money and then hold a cash bonfire with Humane AI and Magic Leap\n(another company that originally told investors that a key technology was\nlaser projection). Thankfully, at least this time, they are not stealing money\nfrom individuals on Kickstarter or Indigogo like Ritot, Cicret, and eyeHand\ndid, even if the amount is two orders of magnitude higher.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTags\n\n# Apple# Humane AI# Laser Projection# LG# Magic Leap# Microsoft\n\n##### Karl Guttag\n\nArticles: 256\n\n#### Categories\n\n  * Augmented Reality and HMD (184)\n  * Use Model (93)\n  * Pico Projection (91)\n  * Startups (71)\n  * Technology History (33)\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * AR (102)\n  * Magic Leap (93)\n  * LCOS (87)\n  * HoloLens (86)\n  * Augmented Reality (81)\n\n#### Year\n\n  * 2024 (12)\n  * 2023 (27)\n  * 2022 (16)\n  * 2021 (27)\n  * 2020 (32)\n\n### Categories\n\n  * Augmented Reality and HMD (184)\n  * Conferences (12)\n  * DLP (29)\n  * Foveation (6)\n  * HUD (2)\n  * Intellectual Property (5)\n  * Laser Beam Scanning Projectors (29)\n  * Laser Projection (9)\n  * LCOS (50)\n  * Micro-LED (28)\n  * OLED (23)\n  * Pico Projection (91)\n  * Startups (71)\n  * Technology History (33)\n  * Uncategorized (9)\n  * Use Model (93)\n  * Website (6)\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * Mixed Reality at CES & AR/VR/MR 2024 (Part 2 Mostly Optics) April 11, 2024\n  * 2024 Solar Eclipse Photos (Real Reality) April 8, 2024\n  * Mixed Reality at CES and the AR/VR/MR 2024 Video (Part 1 \u2013 Headset Companies) April 1, 2024\n  * Apple Vision Pro \u2013 Influencing the Influencers & \u201cInformation Density\u201d March 16, 2024\n  * Apple Vision Pro Displays the Same Image Differently Depending on the Application March 7, 2024\n  * Apple Vision Pro\u2019s Optics Blurrier & Lower Contrast than Meta Quest 3 March 1, 2024\n\n### Archives\n\n### Blogroll\n\n  * Display Daily\n  * MicroLED-Info\n\n### 18 Comments\n\n  1. #### SaKiE\n\nDecember 6, 2023 / 7:51 pm Reply\n\nKarl, for they voice recognition, citing Alexa and Siri is fairly outdated.\nHave you tried chatGPT on iOS or Google Gemini ?

I didn\u2019t know about that. I happen to own and regularly\nuse a Sony laser picoprojector with a Microvision display engine. They also\nclaim 720p resolution. Is there a convenient checkerboard or other test\npattern I can use to test that theory?\n\nLoading...\n\n       * #### Karl Guttag\n\nDecember 7, 2023 / 10:10 am\n\nEvery laser projector that I have seen equates \u201cscan lines\u201d with vertical\npixels and then assume that the horizontal pixels agree. But scan lines do NOT\nequal horizontal lines because scan lines are both curved and nonlinearly\nspaced. Thus, a \u201cpixel always sits between two scan lines. On top of all this,\nyou have laser speckle which degrades image quality.\n\nIn 2015, I did an analysis of the Celluon Laser projector which is of the same\nvintage at the Sony projector with the same (or very similar) Microvision LCOS\nengine.

And that a single colour has fewer problems\nwith focus and contrast. The rest is entry-level stuff.\n\nI thought that NUVIZ HUD (now a few years ago) did a great job of delivering a\nbit of \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 solution (functionally not too much, not too little) for\nmotorcyclists. The problem is of course that they went out of business, the\nfirmware lapsed and you were left with a $650 paperweight. So the question is\nwhen will the Humane AI pin turn into a $699 paperweight...?\n\nLoading...\n\n  7. #### David\n\nDecember 12, 2023 / 3:31 am Reply\n\nI have no intention to defend this company or its product, but I do wish there\nwas more conversation around the concept of what information we humans desire\nto be provided to us in different contexts, and what data from our\nsurroundings we want our devices to use. Example, for planning a walk a (big\nscreened) iPad is better than an iPhone, but once we are on the walk then a\n(hands-free) Watch is the better device to tell us to Take Next Left. For many\npurposes, a full colour high-resolution screen is overkill \u2013 we just want to\nknow the time, time to the next train, which platform to head to, which\ndirection to walk in. Even for such simple but invaluable information, I\nstruggle to see why projecting into a user\u2019s hand is preferable to a smart\nwatch. Now, what an Apple Watch can\u2019t do but Humane\u2019s device can, is to use a\ncamera to get visual information about a user\u2019s environment (yep, just like\nany smartphone. Humane\u2019s device is hands free, but a smartphone could be\nperched in a jacket pocket with it\u2019s camera facing outwards too). How useful\nan outwards-facing camera is is debatable, but it certainly isn\u2019t essential\nsince every reader here has reached adulthood without such a gadget! That\nsaid, I recently found myself using my phone camera in Google Translate a lot\nwhilst in France. I could imagine a body-mounted camera could be convenient\nwhen shopping (user picks up a book, camera reads barcode, the device tells\nthem the Goodreads review score) or in warehouse stock control. But again,\nthis could be done with any smartphone in a suitable case with the right\nsoftware. (Or even a Google Glass head-mounted device, haha) Tl;dr there is\nstill virtue in exploring human/internet interfaces that aren\u2019t phone-based,\neven though this particular implementation is flawed.

Like you, I have used my smartphone to translate signs while\ntraveling, I can\u2019t imagine how you would do that with signage. Would it be\nreading a lot of stuff you don\u2019t want in hope to catch the stuff you want? Not\nto mention how inappropriate would be to have it blathering away in some\nplaces.\n\nThe amazing thing is that this concept that is so full of obvious major flaws\nraised $230M.\n\nLoading...\n\n       * #### David\n\nDecember 12, 2023 / 8:01 pm\n\nAbsolutely, Mr Guttag, I agree on all points. And it may reassure you that\nwhen popular technology blogs have run articles about the Humane device, the\nhundreds of comments left by members of the public have also been near\nunanimous in their disparaging of the device. What I am interested in is\nalternative forms of user/internet/environment interaction in general, not\nHumane in particular. As such, I\u2019m interested in the answers that a hundred\npeople might give if asked to ponder the question \u201cWhat tasks would be\neasier/possible if a smartphone was fixed to your jacket, camera pointed\noutwards?\u201d. They might first think of barcodes and QR codes, then of text,\nthen of the improvements of ML image recognition, they might think of users\nwith only one hand, or situations where a user requires both hands. It might\nbe that picking up a French book in one hand and running a finger along the\nline of the text you want translated into English through an earbud is a\nconvenient user interaction. Or maybe it isn\u2019t \u2013 we can\u2019t know until we at\nleast consider it. If consumers consider and discuss such questions and\npotential use-cases, they will be less likely to be taken in by products that\ndon\u2019t meet their expectations. Such discussions would also bring a greater\nbreadth of life experiences to the attention of product designers. Of course,\nsuch discussions should be based on solid foundations of what various\ntechnologies are actually capable of, which is why your objective testing and\nanalysis is so invaluable.

You Are correct about the mount, the one we use for our police\nbody camera uses a steal plate and several rare-earth magnets to hold it in\nplace, just pinning it to your tee shirt would not work very well.\n\nLoading...\n\n  9. #### Augmented Times \u2013 les nouvelles mensuelles de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e \u2013 D\u00e9cembre 2023 - R\u00e9alit\u00e9 Augment\u00e9e - Augmented Reality\n\nJanuary 2, 2024 / 9:02 am Reply\n\n[...] Humane AI \u2013 Pico Laser Projection \u2013 $230M AI Twist on an Old Scam \u2013\nKGOnTech [...]\n\nLoading...\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n### Trending now\n\nI\u2019m Back\n\nCES 2018 Part 2 (Aftermarket Heads Up Display \u2013 HUD)\n\nApple Vision Pro\u2019s Optics Blurrier & Lower Contrast than Meta Quest 3\n\nCES 2019 \u2013 AR and other Interesting Display Technology\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2011-2024 KGOnTech LLC\n\n## Discover more from KGOnTech\n\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\n\nContinue reading\n\nLoading Comments...\n\n%d\n\n# Search results\n\nFiltersShow filters\n\nSort by:\n\n\u2022\u2022\n\n## No results found\n\n## Filter options\n\nSearch powered by Jetpack\n\n", "frontpage": false}
