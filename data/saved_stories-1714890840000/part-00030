Is it in Soda & Energy Drinks?\n\n## The History of Synthetic Caffeine\n\n[Source of information: \u2018Caffeinated: how our daily habit hooks, helps and\nhurts us\u2019 by Murray Carpenter. - blog article written in 2016)\n\nIt sounds dodgy, wrong, futuristic, but you\u2019ve likely consumed synthetic\ncaffeine this week or even today...\n\nA century ago, caffeine added to soft drinks, energy drinks and caffeine\ntablets used to be derived from extracting the caffeine from tea leaves or\ncoffee beans.\n\nBut the desire for caffeine has increased exponentially since then and\nscientists from Monsanto looked for cheaper ways to produce much greater\nindustrial quantities of pure caffeine.\n\nBack in 1905, Monsanto started producing caffeine for Coca Cola in St Louis,\nMissouri using tea leaves to extract the precious caffeine and this long term\npartnership was the backbone of Monsanto before it became an enormous\nmultinational.\n\nBy 1945, there were 4 main players manufacturing caffeine in the USA and\nfollowing Coke\u2019s huge popularity with GIs during the Second World War, they\nwere struggling to cope with demand and foreign companies from Taiwan and\nBrazil were getting in on the market.\n\nCoke\u2019s strategy during the Second World War was to guarantee that every\nsoldier should be able to get a coke for 5 cents anywhere on the battlefield \u2013\nand that plan succeeded. It was an important part of the war effort to improve\nmorale. And it left a generation of American men with a thirst for Coke for\nthe rest of their lives. 10 billion bottles were consumed during the war.\n\nToday, the soft drinks market has enormous caffeine needs.\n\nPepsi and Coke needs over 1.6 million kilograms of synthetic caffeine for the\nUS market alone.\n\nMountain Dew packs in half a million kg of synthetic caffeine into its soft\ndrinks for the US market.\n\nIn short, the estimated total synthetic caffeine imported into the USA\nannually is 7 million kilograms of caffeine powder.\n\n## What is synthetic caffeine?\n\nOn with the story...Known as \u2018caffeine anhydrous\u2019, synthetic caffeine was\nfirst developed by the Nazis in 1942 to keep caffeine supplies available\nduring the embargoes emplaced by the War. By 1953, both Monsanto and Pfizer\nhad synthetic caffeine factories up and running in America.\n\nSynthetic caffeine starts with ammonia. Ammonia is converted to urea. Then you\ncombine urea and chloroacetic acid to produce a compound called uracil. In\nturn, the uracil is processed and converted to theophylline.\n\nThe final touch is to add methyl chloride to produce the final product:\nmethylated theophylline \u2013 otherwise known as synthetic caffeine.\n\nHowever, unfortunately for the caffeine industry, the raw synthetic caffeine\noften glows - a bluish phosphorence - not a good look.\n\nSo, this glowing is removed by rinsing the caffeine with sodium nitrite,\nacetic acid, sodium carbonate and chloroform.\n\nAnd the pure stuff is strong. Lethal in fact in small doses. You need to be\nvery careful with it. A sixteenth of a spoonful will give you the same hit as\na large coffee, a quarter tea spoon will lead to a racing heart, sweating and\nacute anxiety, a tablespoon of caffeine will kill you.\n\nBack in 1995, the Pfizer plant in Grocon, Connecticut, had a major accident in\nwhich a yellow cloud of lethal nitrogen oxide escaped the plant and the entire\nfactory had to be evacuated.\n\n## Where is Synthetic Caffeine Manufactured?\n\nThe synthetic caffeine story is no longer about the USA.\n\nAlmost no synthetic caffeine is produced in the United States anymore.\n\nThe majority of synthetic caffeine is now made in China.\n\n3 Chinese factories together exporting 4 million kg of caffeine alone to the\nUSA every year. Indeed, the majority of the world\u2019s synthetic caffeine comes\nfrom just one Chinese town: Shijiazhung \u2013 a heavily polluted industrial city\nin Hebei province.\n\nThe biggest caffeine factory in the world is the CSPC Innovation\nPharmaceutical Company. It produces 1.8 million kg of caffeine for the US\nmarket alone.\n\nThere is very little information or scrutiny in the world of synthetic\ncaffeine. Almost no one even knows that caffeine is not naturally extracted\nanymore and the energy drinks industry is no rush to make this clear on their\npackaging.\n\nEven government agencies sometimes finds their inspections requests denied.\nFor example, the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and\nHealthcare attempted to inspect the CSPC factory for health and safety checks\non behalf of the European Union. Their attempts were blocked and denied by\nCSPC and in turn CSPC is no longer allowed to export synthetic caffeine to the\nEU. By 2013, 4 of the 5 biggest caffeine manufacturers in China had had their\nlicense to export to Europe revoked. That's worrying.\n\nAt least the EU had tried and failed to inspect these caffeine\nfactories...what about the FDA in America? Nope. They don't seem to be.\n\nVery few foreign inspections appear to happen and it looks like they rely on\nself certification, which is a dangerous path and opportunity for cutting\ncosts and corners \u2013 particularly in a country like China, which is regularly\nin the press for food and drink poisonings.\n\nSo far, it appears that the FDA have visited just one caffeine plant in China\nand the report on their visit makes worrying reading. There were multiple\nserious health and safety dangers including accumulated debris everywhere,\nrusting throughout, no hygiene standards/hair nets/gloves, spillages, you name\nit. They appear to be producing caffeine in a filthy factory. This factory was\na supplier to Coca Cola and Dr Pepper amongst many others.\n\nIn short, the caffeine industry is opaque, with almost no publicly available\ninformation, and what information is available makes very worrying reading.\n\n## Is Synthetic Caffeine used in Soda and Energy drinks?\n\nYes, you find synthetic caffeine in most of the caffeinated soda drinks you\ndrink anywhere in the world. This synthetic caffeine is expertly blended with\ncarbonated sugar drinks to produce those famous soft drinks we all know and\nthink we love.\n\nManufacturers are not obliged to state if the caffeine is natural or\nsynthetic. So, under the ingredients section, it simply states \u2018caffeine\u2019.\n\nThe only country in the world where you are guaranteed to have natural\ncaffeine in your drinks is Japan. Japan outlaws the use of synthetic caffeine\nin food and drinks as an additive. So, all caffeine used is natural caffeine\nextracted from tea or coffee in Japan.\n\n## Do soda drink brands have to state how much caffeine is in the can?\n\nNo - all that\u2019s required is to state that it has caffeine.\n\n## Do soda drink brands have to say whether it\u2019s natural or synthetic\ncaffeine?\n\nThat\u2019s a no again.\n\nSometimes, synthetic caffeine is occasionally mis-blended and the results can\nbe disastrous.\n\nIn September 2010, over a hundred thousand bottles of Sunkist were withdrawn\nafter customer reported stomach pains, throwing up and hospitalisation\nfollowing an error in the blending of caffeine into Sunkist drinks. The\ncaffeine levels found in these Sunkist bottles were off the charts \u2013 each\n350ml bottle had been dosed with 350mg of caffeine \u2013 that\u2019s the equivalent of\n3 red bulls.\n\nHowever, the main issue with synthetic caffeine is that the public don't seem\nto know it even exists, where or how it\u2019s made.\n\nThe lack of scrutiny and transparency, as well as the lack of information on\nfood and drink labels, is an accident waiting to happen and globally\nlegislators need to wake up and smell the coffee that regulators need to\nreview the situation.\n\nDo you want to learn more?\n\nWe recommend this book, which was where most of this information came from:\n\n\u2018Caffeinated: how our daily habit hooks, helps and hurts us\u2019 by Murray\nCarpenter.\n\nAvailable at Amazon.\n\nIMPORTANT: This information is intended to support, not replace, discussion\nwith your doctor or healthcare professionals.

I looked this up after drinking a small coke and my\nheart racing really fast right after which was odd to me since I have a great\ncaffeine tolerance with coffee.. now I know there is a difference between\nsynthetic/natural caffeine and will share this with family and avoid anything\nwith synthetic caffeine.\n\nWendy said:\n\nI have wanted to report this to the FDA and my family mentioned to me that the\nbig soda companies, like Coca Cola and Pepsi are so powerful that they will do\nanything to prevent the FDA from looking into this awful, poisoning, and\ndeadly synthetic caffeine made in China. This would destroy their company,\nincluding all the shareholders who have invested millions of dollars in their\ncompanies. Unfortunately, this could effect our economy, and make our economy\neven worse than it is from the Covid 19 pandemic. Yikes!\n\nDespite worrying about our economy, I think we should get the message out\nabout synthetic caffeine to as many people as possible. If multiple people\nwill raise the concern about the synthetic caffeine made in China to the FDA,\nand then hopefully the FDA will do its job to protect the people in the U.S.\n\nDanielle said:\n\nIf this is such a concern, rather than relying on the huge corporations (who\nare getting filthy rich and in no hurry to find problems) to monitor this\nstuff, hasn\u2019t there been any testing done POST production to check levels of\nharmful compounds and contaminants?\n\nMy biggest concern is the harmful chemicals used in creating the final\nproduct. The molecular structure of synthetic caffeine is apparently nearly\nindistinguishable from natural caffeine chemical compound but is there nothing\nleft of the processing chemicals in that final product? That\u2019s what I\u2019m\ninterested in.\n\nI\u2019m thinking mainly of caffeine pills because, quite frankly, if you\u2019re\ndowning Coke, diet drinks and energy drinks on the regular, you probably don\u2019t\ncare a whole lot what your putting in your body anyway. But if you\u2019re taking\nthe drug caffeine in a pill form rather than the natural drug form of coffee\nfor reasons such as stomach trouble, then you might still care what you\u2019re\ningesting.\n\nAre the processing chemicals actually present, or is it more like, \u201cSwallowing\nknives is really harmful to your health so don\u2019t eat shredded cabbage because\nit\u2019s made by chopping the cabbage up with knives and you don\u2019t want to swallow\nknives\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s actually left IN the final product? I would think that\u2019s pretty easy to\ntest for.\n\nJulie Quinlan said:\n\nWow! I had no idea. It\u2019s criminal the FDA is not interested I. Protecting our\nhealth.
