However, the\nrecommendations related to the time of its execution are conflicting,\nespecially when dealing with patients at risk of erosive tooth wear (ETW) or\ndental caries. Summary: Our objective was to summarize the evidence on the\ntiming of brushing with fluoridated toothpaste in relation to ETW and\ncariogenic dietary challenges. We conducted a scoping review following the\nPRISMA-ScR checklist, using three databases searching for in-vivo, in-situ, or\nin-vitro studies involving human teeth exposed to either a cariogenic or an\nerosive challenge. Only models including human saliva and fluoride were\nassessed. Data selection, extraction, and risk of bias analysis were done in\nduplicate and independently. From 1,545 identified studies, 17 (16 related to\nETW and 1 to dental caries) were included. Most evidence (n=10) supported that\nbrushing with a fluoride-containing product does not increase ETW, independent\nof the moment of brushing. Delaying tooth brushing up to 1 hour (n=4) or\nindividualized recommendations based on the patient's problem (n=2) were less\nfrequent. Only one study reported that brushing pre- or post-meal does not\naffect Streptococcus mutans counts. Most data was in-situ (n=13), and the\noverall study quality was judged as sufficient/low risk of bias. Key Messages:\nAlthough the available evidence lacked robust clinical studies, tooth brushing\nusing fluoridated products immediately after an erosive challenge does not\nincrease the risk of ETW and can be recommended, which is in line with\nrecommendations for dental caries prevention. Furthermore, we suggest updating\nthe international guidelines to promote individualized recommendations based\non risk factors to prevent either ETW or dental caries.\n\nJournal Section:\n\nReview Article\n\nThis content is only available via PDF.\n\nOpen the PDF for in another window\n\nS.
