Now the US Copyright Office has changed\ncourse\u2014but there\u2019s a catch.\n\nTo revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.\n\nILLUSTRATION: BEN HINKS; GETTY IMAGES\n\nLast October, I received an email with a hell of an opening line: \u201cI fired a\nnuke at the US Copyright Office this morning.\u201d\n\nThe message was from Elisa Shupe, a 60-year-old retired US Army veteran who\nhad just filed a copyright registration for a novel she\u2019d recently self-\npublished. She\u2019d used OpenAI's ChatGPT extensively while writing the book. Her\napplication was an attempt to compel the US Copyright Office to overturn its\npolicy on work made with AI, which generally requires would-be copyright\nholders to exclude machine-generated elements.\n\nThat initial shot didn\u2019t detonate\u2014a week later, the USCO rejected Shupe\u2019s\napplication\u2014but she ultimately won out. The agency changed course earlier this\nmonth after Shupe appealed, granting her copyright registration for AI\nMachinations: Tangled Webs and Typed Words, a work of autofiction self-\npublished on Amazon under the pen name Ellen Rae.\n\nThe novel draws from Shupe\u2019s eventful life, including her advocacy for more\ninclusive gender recognition. Its registration provides a glimpse of how the\nUSCO is grappling with artificial intelligence, especially as more people\nincorporate AI tools into creative work. It is among the first creative works\nto receive a copyright for the arrangement of AI-generated text.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the Copyright Office struggling with where to draw the line,\u201d\nintellectual property lawyer Erica Van Loon, a partner at Nixon Peabody, says.\nShupe\u2019s case highlights some of the nuances of that struggle\u2014because the\napproval of her registration comes with a significant caveat.\n\nThe USCO\u2019s notice granting Shupe copyright registration of her book does not\nrecognize her as author of the whole text as is conventional for written\nworks. Instead she is considered the author of the \u201cselection, coordination,\nand arrangement of text generated by artificial intelligence.\u201d This means no\none can copy the book without permission, but the actual sentences and\nparagraphs themselves are not copyrighted and could theoretically be\nrearranged and republished as a different book.\n\nThe agency backdated the copyright registration to October 10, the day that\nShupe originally attempted to register her work. It declined to comment on\nthis story. \u201cThe Copyright Office does not comment on specific copyright\nregistrations or pending applications for registration,\u201d Nora Scheland, an\nagency spokesperson says. President Biden\u2019s executive order on AI last fall\nasked the US Patent and Trademark Office to make recommendations on copyright\nand AI to the White House in consultation with the Copyright Office, including\non the \u201cscope of protection for works produced using AI.\u201d\n\nAlthough Shupe\u2019s limited copyright registration is notable, she originally\nasked the USCO to open a more significant path to copyright recognition for\nAI-generated material. \u201cI seek to copyright the AI-assisted and AI-generated\nmaterial under an ADA exemption for my many disabilities,\u201d she wrote in her\noriginal copyright application.\n\nShupe believes fervently that she was only able to complete her book with the\nassistance of generative AI tools. She says she has been assessed as 100\npercent disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs and struggles to write\ndue to cognitive impairment related to conditions including bipolar disorder,\nborderline personality disorder, and a brain stem malformation.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\nShe is proud of the finished work and sees working with a text generator as a\ndifferent but no less worthwhile method of expressing thoughts. \u201cYou don't\njust hit \u2018generate\u2019 and get something worthy of publishing. That may come in\nthe future, but we're still far from it,\u201d she says, noting that she spent\nupwards of 14 hours a day working on her draft.\n\nAfter her initial registration was refused, Shupe connected with Jonathan\nAskin, founder of the Brooklyn Law Incubator and Policy Clinic at Brooklyn Law\nSchool, which takes pro bono cases centered on emerging tech and policy\nquestions. Askin and Brooklyn Law student Sofia Vescovo began working on\nShupe\u2019s case and filed an appeal with the USCO in January.\n\nThe appeal built on Shupe\u2019s argument about her disabilities, saying she should\nbe granted copyright because she used ChatGPT as an assistive technology to\ncommunicate, comparing her use of OpenAI\u2019s chatbot to an amputee using a\nprosthetic leg. The appeal claimed that the USCO \u201cdiscriminated against her\nbecause of her disability.\u201d\n\nThe Brooklyn Law appeal also claimed that Shupe should be granted copyright\nfor compiling the book\u2014that is, doing the work of selecting and organizing the\nsnippets of AI-generated text. It provided an exhaustive log of how Shupe\nprompted ChatGPT, showing the custom commands she created and the edits she\nmade.\n\nIt includes a side-by-side comparison of the unedited machine output and the\nfinal version of Shupe\u2019s book. On a sentence level, she adjusted almost every\nline in some way, from changes in word choice to structure. One example\ndescribing a character in the novel: \u201cMark eyed her, a complex mix of concern\nand annoyance evident in his gaze\u201d becomes \u201cMark studied her, his gaze\nreflecting both worry and irritation.\u201d\n\nThe appeal cites another recent AI copyright decision about the graphic novel\nZarya and the Dawn, which incorporates AI-generated images created with\nMidjourney. In February 2023, author Kris Kashtanova was granted copyright to\nthe selection and arrangement of AI-generated images in the text, even though\nthey were denied copyright on the specific images themselves.\n\nWhen the USCO granted Shupe\u2019s request for copyright, it did not address the\ndisability argument put forth but agreed with the appeal\u2019s other argument.\nShupe could be considered the author of \u201cselection, coordination, and\narrangement of text generated by artificial intelligence,\u201d the agency wrote,\nbackdating her copyright registration to October 10, 2023, the day that Shupe\nhad originally attempted to register her work. That gives her authorship of\nthe work overall, prohibiting unauthorized wholecloth reproduction of the\nentire book, but not copyright protection over the actual sentences of the\nnovel.\n\n\u201cOverall, we are extremely satisfied,\u201d says Vescovo. The team felt that\ncopyrighting the book\u2019s compilation would provide peace of mind against out-\nand-out reproduction of the work. \u201cWe really wanted to make sure we could get\nher this protection right now.\u201d The Brooklyn Law team hope Shupe\u2019s approval\ncan serve as a blueprint for other people experimenting with AI text\ngeneration who want some copyright protection.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Paradox That's Supercharging Climate Change\n\nMatt Simon\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take this as a win for now,\u201d Shupe says, even though she knows\nthat \u201cin some ways, it\u2019s a compromise.\u201d She maintains that the way she uses\nChatGPT more closely resembles a collaboration than an automated output, and\nthat she should be able to copyright the actual text of the book.\n\nMatthew Sag, a professor of law and artificial intelligence at Emory\nUniversity, calls what the USCO granted Shupe \u201cthin copyright\u201d\u2014protection\nagainst full-fledged duplication of materials that doesn\u2019t stop someone from\nrearranging the paragraphs into a different story. \u201cThis is the same kind of\ncopyright you would get in an anthology of poetry that you didn\u2019t write,\u201d Sag\nsays.\n\nErica Van Loon agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine something more narrow,\u201d she says.\n\nShupe is part of a larger movement to make copyright law friendlier to AI and\nthe people who use it. The Copyright Office, which both administers the\ncopyright registration system and advises Congress, the judiciary system, and\nother governmental agencies on copyright matters, plays a central role in\ndetermining how works that use AI are treated.\n\nAlthough it continues to define authorship as an exclusively human endeavor,\nthe USCO has demonstrated openness to registering works that incorporate AI\nelements. The USCO said in February that it has granted registration to over\n100 works with AI incorporated; a search by WIRED found over 200 copyright\nregistration applications explicitly disclosing AI elements, including books,\nsongs, and visual artworks.\n\nOne such application came from Tyler Partin, who works for a chemical\nmanufacturer. He recently registered a tongue-in-cheek song he created about a\ncoworker, but excluded lyrics that he spun up using ChatGPT from his\nregistration. Partin sees the text generator as a tool, but ultimately doesn\u2019t\nthink he should take credit for its output. Instead, he applied only for the\nmusic rather than the accompanying words. \u201cI didn\u2019t do that work,\u201d he says.\n\nBut there are others who share Shupe\u2019s perspective and agree with her mission,\nand believe that AI-generated materials should be registrable. Some high-\nprofile attempts to register AI-generated artworks have resulted in USCO\nrefusals, like artist Matthew Allen\u2019s effort to get his award-winning artwork\nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre D\u2019op\u00e9ra Spatial copyrighted last year. AI researcher Stephen Thaler\nhas been on a mission for years to prove that the AI system he invented\ndeserves copyright protections of its own.\n\nThaler is currently appealing a ruling in the US last year that rebuffed his\nattempt to obtain copyright on behalf of his machine. Ryan Abbott, the lead\nattorney on the case, founded the Artificial Inventor Project, a group of\nintellectual property lawyers who file test cases seeking legal protections\nfor AI-generated works.\n\nAbbott is a supporter of Shupe\u2019s mission, although he\u2019s not a member of her\nlegal team. He isn\u2019t happy that the copyright registration excludes the AI-\ngenerated work itself. \u201cWe all see it as a very big problem,\u201d he says.\n\nShupe and her legal helpers don\u2019t have plans to push the ADA argument further\nby contesting the USCO\u2019s decision, but it\u2019s an issue that is far from settled.\n\u201cThe best path is probably to lobby Congress for an addition to the ADA\nstatute,\u201d says Askin. \u201cThere's a potential for us to draft some legislation or\ntestimony to try to move Congress in that direction.\u201d\n\nShupe\u2019s qualified victory is still a significant marker in how the Copyright\nOffice is grappling with what it means to be an author in the age of AI. She\nhopes going public with her efforts will reduce what she sees as a stigma\nagainst using AI as a creative tool. Her metaphorical nuke didn\u2019t go off, but\nshe has nonetheless advanced her cause. \u201cI haven't been this excited since I\nunboxed a Commodore 64 back in the 1980s and, after a lot of noise, connected\nto a distant computer,\u201d she says.\n\nUpdated 17-4-2024, 4:35 pm EDT: President Biden's executive order on AI last\nyear asked the US Patent and Trademark office to make recommendations on\ncopyright and AI in consultation with the Copyright Office, it did not ask the\nCopyright Office itself to make the recommendations.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
