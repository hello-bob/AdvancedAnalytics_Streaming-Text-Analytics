He speaks to\nthe pocket-sized device and the AI voice assistant responds back.\n\nAt first, Lyu starts with some easy requests like looking up the weather and\nbasic search questions. Next, he demonstrates the R1\u2019s computer vision for\nidentifying and describing what\u2019s in front of him and then dives into more\nadvanced functions. He uses the R1\u2019s camera to convert a hand-written chart\ninto a spreadsheet that\u2019s then emailed to him. It happens instantly over a 4G\nLTE connection.\n\nThe crowd of several hundred early adopter techies explodes with cheers at the\nspeed and perfect conversion from the AI. Lyu streams music from Spotify,\norders McDonald\u2019s via DoorDash, calls an Uber, generates images from\nMidjourney \u2014 all using his accented English (no wake words like \u201cHey Siri\u201d or\n\u201cAlexa\u201d) which could typically trip up other voice assistants.\n\nThe 34-year-old founder and CEO of Rabbit Inc. had just wrapped up a splashy\nlaunch party for the R1 the night before at the TWA Hotel adjacent to John F.\nKennedy Airport in New York City. Many of the attendees had flown in from\nacross the country to meet Lyu and pick up their pre-ordered R1 devices.\n\nWhen we meet up at a WeWork in midtown Manhattan he\u2019s looking a little tired\nbut tries to hide it underneath his baseball cap, which appropriately has the\nwords \u201cOut of Office\u201d stitched on its front. He tells me he only got a few\nhours of sleep and I believe it because he and Rabbit\u2019s chief technology\nofficer, Peiyuan Liao, were up past 3 a.m. helping me troubleshoot my R1 setup\nissues. They were also busy responding to the feedback and out-of-box problems\ncustomers who picked up their orange-colored devices were sharing to social\nmedia platforms like X.\n\n> \u201cI know exactly what to improve.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I\u2019ll be very happy if the R1 gets a 6/10 review score, today, in\nthe first 24 hours [of it being released],\u201d Lyu tells Inverse. \u201cI know exactly\nwhat to improve. We\u2019re going to fix the battery [drain issues] and fix the\nclock [displaying wrong time zones].\u201d\n\nLyu\u2019s profile began to rocket at the start of the year when Rabbit \u201cwon\u201d CES\nwith the introduction of the R1. The AI gadget, which I likened to a real-life\nPok\u00e9dex (the gadget that fictional Pok\u00e9mon trainers use to identify new\nmonsters), stole attention from iterative versions of devices we already have\nsuch as TVs, laptops, and speakers. That a startup nobody had ever heard of\ncould come out of left field with a device that \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 seemed\nto make artificial intelligence seem desirable with a new handheld device told\nLyu he was on the right track.\n\nWhile Rabbit and the R1 are fresh to the consumer tech world, Lyu is not.\nPrior to forming Rabbit in 2021, and from the moment he left his hometown in\nXian, China to go to university in the UK, he began working his way through\nthe industry. He\u2019s worked on apps, which led to startup entrepreneurship,\nwhich led to his last company, Raven. In 2017, Lyu launched a robotic smart\nspeaker co-designed by Teenage Engineering called the Raven H in partnership\nwith Baidu, in China. The Swedish consumer electronics and industrial design\ncompany, Teenage Engineering, doesn\u2019t do design work with everyone. It has a\ncertain aesthetic that can be described as retro and technical-looking, but\nfunky and playful, and a love for tactile inputs like buttons, knobs, and\nswitches. Devices like the OP-1 synthesizer and sampler tool, and most\nrecently, its work with Nothing for transparent phones and wireless earbuds,\nexemplify non-conformist design and utility. To summarize: Lyu\u2019s done hardware\nand software before, and he knows the intricacies of doing both as they now\ncollide with AI.\n\nIn hindsight, the dots all connected for Lyu to become a figure in AI consumer\ntech \u2014 using AI, specifically natural language processing via voice input and\ncomputer vision \u2014 to enhance our curiosities about the world, and maybe even\ngive us back time, whether that\u2019s saving time working or not getting lost in\napps.\n\nNobody, not even Lyu, can be certain that the R1 will succeed (though 100,000\npre-ordered units since January is a great start) or whether smartphones,\nwhich are starting to get similar AI capabilities, will render it and other AI\ngadgets like Humane\u2019s Ai Pin obsolete before they can even gain traction. But\nLyu isn\u2019t fixated on taking down Apple or Samsung or any other big consumer\ntech company. His full attention, now that the R1 is in the hands of real\ncustomers, is delivering on the promises of the device and its AI. That means\nshipping the new features that were announced at the launch event and\nlistening to feedback for improving the R1 \u2014 and moving fast. Judging at how\nengaged Lyu is sliding into the replies on X, Rabbit is moving at the speed of\nlight.\n\n## Lyu\u2019s Pathway to Tech\n\nTeenage Engineering did the Rabbit R1\u2019s industrial design and it shows. It\nlooks and feels very retro, and is very tactile with its scroll wheel,\nmotorized camera, and Push-to-Talk button.\n\nPhotograph by Raymond Wong\n\nLike any kid growing up in the \u201890s, Lyu loved technology and gadgets. His\nfirst contact was video games \u2014 specifically, arcade machines. Back then,\nChina was not yet the technology powerhouse it is today. The country lagged\nyears, if not a decade, behind the rest of the world with computers and IT\ninfrastructure. But even though his access, especially in Xian, which was not\nyet urbanized, was limited, he found a way. He\u2019d beg his parents to allow him\nto stay at his uncle\u2019s place during Lunar New Year (a week when work\neffectively shuts down and everyone in China goes back to their hometowns to\nspend time with their family) just so he could visit the local arcade.\n\n\u201cWhen I was five or six years old, that was the first time I got my hands on\nan actual computer,\u201d Lyu says while slowly sipping his Diet Coke, kicked back\nin shorts, and comfy Air Jordan 36 Lows. \u201cIt was pretty early in China and it\nwas an Intel Pentium 486 chip running on Microsoft DOS with no mouse. There\nwere a couple of DOS games on a floppy disc. I played that and I was like,\n\u2018Holy shit, this is way different than Street Fighter at the arcade.\u2019\u201d\n\nVideo games and computers weren\u2019t just a hobby to Lyu \u2014 they were part of his\nlife and his identity, and they always found a way to intertwine. By his early\nadulthood, he was a semi-professional Warcraft 3 player and ranked 8th at the\nWorld Cyber Games in 2010.\n\n\u201cI just like to try all the gadgets,\u201d Lyu says. \u201cI saved up my own money for a\nGame Boy. Not the color one, the original one.\u201d\n\nWith the Game Boy and computers piquing his technology curiosity, the natural\nnext step was to learn how to program. Lyu says because he was a minor and\nthere was no access to online courses or YouTube tutorials back in the \u201890s,\nhe again had to find alternative means \u2014 begging his older sister to register\nfor a workshop teaching adults the C programming language so that he could tag\nalong.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I started programming,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just building Flash games\nand some random small projects.\u201d\n\nBy 2008, he graduated high school and applied for university, and it was\nsoccer, not technology, that would free him from China. A big fan of Liverpool\nFC, he sprung at the opportunity to attend the University of Liverpool, where\nhe majored in mathematics.\n\n\u201cIn the remaining year of the workshop, the teacher showed up with a mouse,\u201d\nhe says, and it was a revelation. \u201cThe teacher was like, \u2018From today, whatever\nyou\u2019ve learned is obsolete\u2019 because they started installing Windows and I was\nlike, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t start computer science because then if I graduate,\neverything in the next four years is obsolete\u2019 so I went with something more\nfundamental like mathematics.\u201d\n\nIn the second semester of Lyu\u2019s first year at university, he got a random\nemail from one of his professors asking if anyone had an iPad and knew how to\nuse the Objective-C programming language to create tablet apps. Lucky for Lyu,\nhis mom had just gifted him one, so he replied, and together with his\nprofessor and a few other students, he got his first taste of app development\ntrying to create digital and interactive textbooks. The project ultimately\nfailed when the professor funding the project ran out of cash.\n\n> Lyu doesn\u2019t seem to fear messing up.\n\nThat failure, however, made Lyu realize how much he liked working with a\ncollective of people all trying to build something \u2014 essentially startup\nculture. He\u2019d work on several more projects with three of his university mates\nby graduation time, including a \u201csocial calendar network\u201d called Time Meet\nthat allowed groups of friends to organize plans based on the free time on\ntheir calendars. Lyu\u2019s first official company was financed by money borrowed\nfrom each founding members\u2019 parents. \u201cEach of us borrowed \u00a33,000 and then we\nspent 75 percent of that just to pay the lawyer to register the company. We\nrealized then it was not gonna work.\u201d\n\nCuriosity and determination have always been guiding forces for Lyu. He didn\u2019t\nhave the Silicon Valley connections handed to him, but he had the grit to\nfigure it out. Lyu doesn\u2019t seem to fear messing up. He didn\u2019t fear losing the\nfirst term sheet that he got from an early venture capitalist when his co-\nfounders decided to drop out of the agreement. And he doesn\u2019t fear the\ncritical feedback that early R1 customers are pointing out about the device\nand its AI. Despite calling it the most \u201cdown period of his life,\u201d Lyu says he\ndidn\u2019t dwell on it for long. He picked himself back up to figure out what he\nwanted to do after college.\n\n## Birth of An AI Computer\n\nJesse Lyu demonstrating the R1\u2019s features live at its NYC launch party.\n\nPhotograph by Raymond Wong\n\nAfter spending some time bumping around (talking to VCs and such), TEDx\ninvited him to give a presentation. It was making that keynote when Lyu found\nhis true calling.\n\n\u201cI wanted to build a J.A.R.V.I.S.,\u201d he tells me referring to the fictional AI\nassistant that aids Tony Stark in Marvel\u2019s Iron Man movies. \u201cI wanted to build\nsomething from a sci-fi movie, something for everyone, so I pivoted quickly.\nThat was the early idea of building a computer using natural language.\u201d\n\nAn application to Y Combinator, a VC and startup accelerator that invests and\nincubates startups, moved Lyu and a few friends to Palo Alto, California where\nthey formed Raven.\n\n\u201cWe were one of the first companies really focused on conversational AI, which\nwas before LLMs\u201d Lyu says, referring to the large language models that give\nprograms like ChatGPT the ability to replicate human conversation. \u201cWe were\nreally working hard on natural language processing.\u201d\n\nLyu says the natural language processing that Raven was working on predated\nAmazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant (which launched in the first Echo smart speaker\nin November 2014). \u201cWe didn\u2019t know each other.\u201d\n\nHad it not been for his investors telling him that hardware was really hard to\ndo, Lyu says he could have released a smart speaker before Amazon.\n\n\u201cThe only decision I regret is starting with a music-based phone app. [The\ninvestors] convinced me that it wasn\u2019t a good time and that I didn\u2019t know how\nto do hardware, and then Alexa came out. That felt really bad for me. I had\nthe idea [before them] not knowing that there was such a thing as a smart\nspeaker.\u201d\n\nRaven continued working on its natural language processing. Then, in 2016,\nBaidu (the Google or Yahoo! equivalent in China) reached out to Raven because\n\u201csearch was dying\u201d and \u201cthey weren\u2019t doing anything on mobile,\u201d according to\nLyu. The company wanted to invest in and pivot to AI. Baidu originally wanted\nto buy Raven, but Lyu wasn\u2019t interested, so they landed on a partnership\ninstead, which led to the creation and launch of the AI-powered Raven H smart\nspeaker in 2017 and Raven R smart robot (which was never released). It was\nBaidu\u2019s deep pockets that allowed Lyu to collaborate with Teenage Engineering\non the two Raven smart devices.\n\n> \u201cI wanted to build a J.A.R.V.I.S. I wanted to build something from a sci-fi\n> movie, something for everyone...\u201d\n\nBaidu\u2019s decision to pull the plug on the Raven R can be viewed as a failure,\nbut it did connect Lyu with the tech company and designer he worshiped in his\nyouth \u2014 a partnership that would later extend to Teenage Engineering designing\nthe R1 hardware. So even though his time working on hardware with Baidu was\nshort-lived, he knew that if he were to ever do hardware again (Lyu says it\nwas always a when not if), he\u2019d tap Teenage Engineering for the job without\nhesitation.\n\nSomehow, Lyu\u2019s always had a little bit of luck. When the deal with Baidu ended\nin 2018 and he relocated from Beijing back to the San Francisco Bay Area, Sam\nAltman rang him up. Altman, who catapulted into the spotlight last year with\nthe release of ChatGPT in late 2022 and has become the face of AI, showed him\nwhat OpenAI was developing. Lyu says he was intrigued, but didn\u2019t feel it went\nfar enough. He wanted to see humans manipulate AI to truly understand a user\u2019s\nintention and actions when they\u2019re using a computer.\n\n\u201cIt was roughly around 2020, during hard Covid that I got access to the early\nversion of GPT-3 \u2014 and it was mind-blowing,\u201d he says. \u201cI talked to my team and\nsaid \u2018Let\u2019s not try to recreate the wheel,\u2019 AI understanding a user\u2019s\nintentions is 100 percent solved. Transformers, too. Let\u2019s focus on the next\nstep. Can this language model understand [a user\u2019s actions with a computer]?\u201d\n\nIn order for an AI to understand a user\u2019s computer actions, it needs to first\nbe trained on how people use computers. How do they control a mouse? What\nbuttons do they click? What do certain buttons do?\n\n\u201cWe took a step back to think about how humans learn from nature. We observe,\nwe imitate, we practice. Can we find something in common? Because we don't\nwant to just build a Chrome plugin that just does one thing. We don\u2019t want to\nbuild an agent or action model for solving [commands] on one platform. We\nwanted to find a universal solution.\u201d\n\nTeach Mode, a feature that\u2019s coming soon to the R1, is a way to, well, teach\nthe device\u2019s AI how to use an app or service for you.\n\nPhotograph by Raymond Wong\n\nThat common factor ended up being modern user interfaces \u2014 software that\u2019s\ndesigned for humans to easily understand and operate. For example, everyone\nknows that a gear-shaped icon usually refers to a settings menu with options\nfor adjusting different preferences. With that commonality identified, they\u2019d\njust need to train an AI (neural-symbolic AI) with tons and tons of videos of\npeople interacting with modern UIs on computers and mobile devices. Three\nyears of nonstop training later, all that AI learning morphed into Rabbit\u2019s\nLarge Action Model, or LAM.\n\nIt was at that inflection point after meeting with Altman that Raven became\nRabbit. Why Rabbit? Lyu says there\u2019s \u201cno special meaning\u201d but shares a few\nunofficial inspirations. One: He has a thing for animal names (Raven and\nRabbit) and didn\u2019t want a techie-sounding company. Two: He likes The Matrix\nand in the movie, Neo follows a white rabbit to scratch his curiosity. Three:\nThe R1\u2019s LAM and its Teach Mode (allows users to teach the AI how to use apps,\nservices, and other computer actions) and how it can \u201cspawn different\ninstances\u201d reminds him of the rabbit population at the beginning of the\nanimated film, Zootopia. And four: \u201cThere are two syllables, A and I, in\nRabbit, which could be interpreted as a nod to AI.\u201d Lyu also adds that a\nrabbit is \u201cso easy to visualize\u201d compared to a name like Humane, which is more\nof a feeling, than a thing.\n\n\u201cWe started with 150 [of the most popular apps] like Expedia, Spotify,\nDoorDash, and Uber,\u201d says Lyu. \u201cThose were the first.. and we quickly learned\nthere were similarities [among app designs], like McDonald\u2019s actually uses the\nsame [app] vendor as Taco Bell.\u201d\n\nBy the end of 2023, Rabbit had trained its AI on 800 apps and it was time to\nthink about hardware to put it into. I was expecting Lyu to tell me how\nchallenging it was to nail down a design or procure components and\nmanufacturing, but he didn\u2019t. (When manufacturing hardware, factories request\na Minimum Order Quantity, or MOQ, which is a certain number of units set by\nsuppliers and manufacturers in order to make it worth their time and profit to\nproduce devices.) If a startup cannot meet a supplier\u2019s MOQ, then they can\u2019t\nbuild the product in volume or they may be forced to work with lower-tier\nsupply chains which usually means access to second or third-rate components.\nInstead, what he told me next made my jaw drop \u2014 all of it.\n\n> \u201cI knew exactly what I wanted to build: a Tamagotchi-Pok\u00e9dex-walkie-talkie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe started the R1 design phase in October 2023,\u201d he says, only three months\nbefore Rabbit introduced the device at CES 2024. \u201cHardware is an elimination\ngame. You don\u2019t just put a lot of stuff all over the place and it [becomes]\nbulky. All you have to do is minus. [For R1] I thought about what would\nabsolutely be necessary. A camera is absolutely necessary. The screen is\nnecessary. A SIM card is necessary.\u201d\n\nI ask how that\u2019s even possible considering hardware design and production\nusually take at least a year (if not years) of planning. Because Lyu had\nworked with Baidu to produce the Raven H, he knew how the supply chain worked\nand was confident he could get what would become the R1 together within six\nmonths or less. He bought a Tamagotchi off Amazon in March 2023 and gave the\nRabbit team one single instruction: \u201cAI is scary, but let\u2019s make it fun and\ncute.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew exactly what I wanted to build: a Tamagotchi-Pok\u00e9dex-walkie-talkie.\u201d\n\nPrototypes of the Rabbit R1.\n\nPhotograph by Raymond Wong\n\nWith that vague concept in mind, and Teenage Engineering ready to roll (Lyu\nsits on their board), Rabbit landed on the R1\u2019s square design, which Lyu\nclaims \u201ctook us 10 minutes to design.\u201d He says they started with an iPhone 15\nPro Max and cut it in half, penciled in essentials like the display, the\ncamera, the analog scroll wheel, the Push-to-Talk (PTT) button, the speaker,\nthe microphones, the SIM card, and the USB-C port.\n\n\u201cI basically drew [Jesper Kouthoofd, co-founder, CEO, and head of design at\nTeenage Engineering] a box and said somewhere there needs to be a big button,\nand I want the menu to be controllable with a scroll wheel.\u201d He says it only\ntook 10 minutes of emails to bounce ideas like making the camera rotate and\nselecting a color. Kouthoofd actually suggested making the R1 a dark red, a\ncolor picked from RAL (a German color standard) instead of the Pantone Color\nSystem, which is what many designers select from. Lyu didn\u2019t like it and chose\nthe bright and neon orange-red paint job shipping on final units. It was the\nfirst and only time that he vetoed Kouthoofd on a design decision.\n\n> \u201c[The R1] took us 10 minutes to design.\u201d\n\nShortly after I got my R1 up and running, I dove into the device\u2019s settings\nmenu and noticed that it has 128GB of internal storage. I wondered if that was\na mistake, perhaps in the software mislabeling it. Lyu tells me it\u2019s not,\nthere\u2019s really 128GB of storage in the R1. A miscommunication between Rabbit\nand the flash storage manufacturer led to devices shipping with four times the\nstorage instead of the originally intended 32GB the startup had wanted, so\nRabbit just decided to roll with it. The company didn\u2019t get the extra storage\nfor free, though. It still had to pay for the extra storage per device (only\nan additional 6 to 8 cents, according to Lyu). However, don\u2019t be surprised if\nfuture versions of the R1 have less storage. Because with almost all of the\ndevice\u2019s features processed in the cloud, there\u2019s really no need for so much.\n\nStorage miscommunication with the supplier aside, Lyu says: \u201cThere\u2019s a broad\nmisunderstanding that we don\u2019t know how to do hardware. This is actually our\nstrongest part. My head of hardware has been in the industry for over 30 years\nand he knows everyone that knows everyone back in Shenzhen.\u201d\n\n## Sizing Up the Competition\n\nThe Rabbit R1 and the Humane Ai Pin are the first of a new wave of standalone\nAI gadgets to launch this year.\n\nPhotograph by Raymond Wong\n\nThe Rabbit R1 launched right on the heels of Humane\u2019s Ai Pin. Both \u201cAI\ngadgets\u201d are alike in that they use voice-based AI to answer questions,\ncontrol supported apps and services; become a \u201csecond brain\u201d for offloading\nnotes and such; and both have a camera for identifying objects and scenes.\n\nThey\u2019re also quite different. The Ai Pin starts at $700, is worn on clothing,\nhas a Laser Ink Display to project a mono-colored interface onto the palm of\nyour hand, requires a separate phone number for calls and messaging, and needs\na $24/month subscription to function. On the other hand, the R1 starts at\n$199, comes with a color display for viewing information and what the camera\nsees, doesn\u2019t support calls or messaging, and doesn\u2019t require a subscription\nfee (though it does have an unlocked nano-SIM card slot if you want to connect\nto LTE cellular instead of only Wi-Fi).\n\nWhereas the Ai Pin hopes to one day replace your smartphone, returning you\nback to a life that is more present as opposed to glued to a display and apps,\nthe R1 has no such ambitions to kill the touchscreen slab. \u201cWe never said this\nis gonna replace my phone.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWe never said this is gonna replace my phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not chasing them or checking them. Their philosophy is quite different.\nWhen I started Rabbit, on day one, I knew I was a new startup. The number one\nmistake I see from them is that \u2014 yes, they have over three decades of\nexperience at Apple \u2014 but you\u2019re starting as a new company. You\u2019re not Apple,\nyou shouldn\u2019t do things the Apple way. You cannot customize your first-gen\nproduct. It\u2019s just plain wrong.\u201d\n\nUnlike Humane, Lyu says that he told everyone at Rabbit that hardware needed\nto be \u201cde-risk.\u201d That\u2019s why the R1 doesn\u2019t include wireless charging or even a\nUSB-C cable for charging up the device. \u201cWhy would we offer wireless charging\nif we don\u2019t know how the thermals perform? Why would we offer a charging cable\nif we haven\u2019t tested if it bends and could break at the dining table?\u201d\n\nWill people carry another device in their pocket?\n\nPhotograph by Raymond Wong\n\n\u201cOnce I saw them trying to replace the phone, I had a huge relief, and I knew\nwe were heading in separate directions. I never worried [after that].\u201d\nHumane\u2019s original pitch was that the Ai Pin would replace the phone, but the\ncompany has since walked back on that stance and is repositioning the device\nas a phone companion instead.\n\nWith over 100,000 devices sold so far, the R1 is the first AI gadget hit. The\nprice is 3.5x cheaper and initial impressions from myself and first-order\ncustomers seem to favor the AI speed and capabilities of the R1 over the Ai\nPin. Yet, there\u2019s still immense skepticism about whether the R1 needs to exist\nwhen it\u2019s very likely that many of its AI features will be baked into new\nsmartphones.\n\n\u201cI never believed that my first-generation product was going to convince\neveryone [to buy it],\u201d Lyu says. \u201cThat\u2019s just very unrealistic thinking. But\nwe know where all your pockets are on your pants and they\u2019re basically molded\nto [fit phones]. So we just cut [a phone in half] and made it as light as\npossible, and gave it a color that\u2019s so unrealistic that you just want to have\nit right here and stare at it. We make all this fidgeting analog stuff for you\njust to play around with it.\u201d\n\nLyu believes if phone makers don\u2019t add AI capabilities and change, they\u2019ll die\nbecause \u201capplication systems are dying.\u201d I don\u2019t believe many people share\nthat belief \u2014 think about how phones are now cameras, entertainment portals,\nbanking and payment systems, health and fitness trackers, and more, and it\u2019s\nhard to see them just falling out of style when they\u2019re so central to living.\n\nIt\u2019s at this point of our conversation where it feels like the R1 raison\nd\u2019\u00eatre overlaps with the Ai Pin. Lyu says that the R1 is designed to help you\nquickly compute and then move on. There are no addictive apps like TikTok or\nInstagram to get lost in, like on a phone.\n\n\u201cYou go [to your phone] to waste your time or to kill your time,\u201d he tells me\nwhile waving his iPhone 15 Pro Max, covered with a purple Neon Genesis\nEvangelion case (his favorite anime) in the air. \u201cBut you go [to the R1] to\nsave your time.\u201d\n\n> \u201cYou go [to your phone] to waste your time or to kill your time. But you go\n> [to the R1] to save your time.\u201d\n\nThe Ai Pin is the R1\u2019s most direct competition right now, but a wave of AI\ngadgets is popping up, too. I ask him if he\u2019s concerned about other action-\nbased AI gadgets, such as Open Interpreter\u2019s 01 Light eating the R1\u2019s lunch.\nThe stone-shaped AI gadget can control your computer and perform tasks on your\nbehalf, and costs $99 pre-built or you can DIY one yourself with its open-\nsource design and code.\n\n\u201cThey basically said they just want to build an open-source Rabbit R1,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cI\u2019m actually supportive of that. We have the same goal and we\u2019re\nchasing the same dreams. But what I\u2019ve learned is that if you really want to\nbuild the best end-user experience, you have to be a little bit closed. There\nneeds to be polish on both sides [hardware and software].\u201d\n\nHe raises a hypothetical scenario, where there are five different brands of an\nAI computer, and they all use different microphones to listen to a user\u2019s\nvoice command. They may run the same software, but the AI experience will be\n\u201call over the place\u201d because of the different microphones each brand will\nuse.\u201d[With the R1] we know exactly the driver chip, the microphone of each\ncomponent \u2014 we polish to them. But that cannot be achieved if everyone just\ndownloads the same GitHub code and deploys it on their local environment. We\nsaw that from Android.\u201d\n\nAt this time, there are no plans to license the R1\u2019s software, rabbit OS, to\nother brands to make their own devices. It\u2019s the opposite of Humane, which has\nsaid licensing its Cosmos AI operating system is part of its long-term growth\nstrategy.\n\n\u201cWe care about the experience,\u201d Lyu says.\u201cWe care about design. We don't want\nany trash designs to run our OS. It just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n## The Real Work Begins Now\n\nRabbit founder and CEO Jesse Lyu fielding questions from the media at the R1\nlaunch event.\n\nPhotograph by Raymond Wong\n\nBy the hour mark into Lyu\u2019s R1 launch party keynote, the nerds \u2014 including\nmyself \u2014 are getting restless standing around, but excited at the\npossibilities of what the R1 can do. Lyu starts wrapping up his keynote and\nthrows up a slide showing a list of features that are coming by the summer and\nfeatures in development for future software releases.\n\nThe one thing that seems to be bugging everyone is why the R1 doesn\u2019t have a\nway to set alarms (it\u2019s coming in the summer update); the Ai Pin doesn\u2019t have\nit either (it\u2019s also getting it soon). \u201cDo the founders not use alarms or\ncalendars?\u201d I tweeted during the keynote. So I ask Lyu and his answer is\nsimple: They didn\u2019t have time to add it.\n\n\u201cOur team is too small. We have a lot of other priorities. That\u2019s it. We know\nit needs an alarm, but we didn\u2019t have time to do it.\u201d Rabbit, after all, is\nreally small \u2014 only 45 people (including engineering and marketing) at the\nmoment. The company is scaling up (not too fast, though, Lyu says) with more\nengineers to further develop AI and add new features. Because AI is always\nevolving, it\u2019s not something that will ever be \u201cfinished\u201d so in a way, any AI\ngadget will be never-ending, so long as the hardware can handle the updated\nAI.\n\nThe period after a product launch \u2014 when customers are using it in the real\nworld \u2014 is make or break. Lyu is well aware of this and has said it during his\nkeynote, on X, and again to me, that Rabbit is monitoring all feedback (on\nDiscord, on social media, on tech blogs and YouTube channels, etc.). Without\nthe community, the R1 has no future. So Rabbit is taking the job of listening\nvery seriously. That means delivering the features that it\u2019s promised and\ncontinuously adding new utility.\n\nWe wrap up our interview (over 40 minutes past the originally allotted one\nhour) on AI trust, privacy, and security. For AI and AI gadgets to take off,\nthe answers that the AI responds back with need to be correct. Generative AI\nsuch as ChatGPT has improved at a breakneck pace since it was released in\nNovember 2022, but AI still hallucinates \u2014 there\u2019s a 50-50 chance you\u2019ll get\nan answer or a correct one.\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re super early and we move fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny common facts, up-to-date search information \u2014 I 100 percent trust,\u201d Lyu\nsays. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sense of where the AI that we\u2019ve created is at. Anything\nlegal-related? Hell no. Unless you train [the AI] on dedicated data and\nmodels, which is happening. This trust phase is going to be relatively short.\nI will say that in the next couple of months, this will completely become a\nlegacy issue. The only way to move forward is to build it. We accept the\ncurrent stage of AI, and that\u2019s why we have a disclaimer in the settings\n[menu]. For example, don\u2019t use [the R1] to check your health.\u201d\n\nJumping off trust, Lyu says even though Rabbit is small, security and privacy\nare top priorities. There were rumors that R1 user information might have been\nstored on a server in China, given his past relationship working with Baidu.\nLyu debunked that during a media Q&A session at the R1 launch event,\nconfirming that all Rabbit data is stored on Amazon Web Services, or AWS. His\nChinese-U.S. relationship is more personal than business.\n\n\u201cIf you know... just by speed, there\u2019s no way that [the speed of R1\u2019s AI] can\nbe hosted in China.\u201d He says there would be even greater latency if it was. \u201cI\ncame here to chase the American dream and work hard for my passport. I\u2019m not\neven a Chinese citizen [anymore]. Next year, I\u2019ll be an American citizen.\nUnfortunately, I was born in China... I don\u2019t need to lie about that. But I\nleft Baidu and all that in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe R1\u2019s computer vision can \u201clook\u201d at things its camera \u201csees.\u201d Here, it\ncorrectly identifies this PS5 controller.\n\nPhotograph by Raymond Wong\n\nAs for security, Lyu reminds everyone that \u201cany system can be hacked\u201d but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re taking it lightly, either. \u201cWe\u2019re running infiltration\ntests, every single day. We\u2019ve intercepted numerous attacks. It happens all\nthe time. We\u2019re getting blackmailed. A lot of people say they have our code\nand if we don\u2019t pay $2 million in Bitcoin, they\u2019ll share it to Humane. It\u2019s\njust the nature of running any software company. You have to deal with it.\nSecurity is a high priority for us.\u201d\n\nLyu and I walk out of the WeWork into gorgeous, 70-something-degree weather.\nThe sun is just beaming warmth everywhere. It may be difficult for new apps to\nchange the world the same way they did over a decade ago, but they\u2019re not\ngoing anywhere, even with the new boom in AI.\n\n\u201cWe just need to run fast.\u201d Like any startup, Rabbit is smaller and scrappier,\nand as a result, leadership can make decisions much faster than at a large\ncompany like Apple or Google. \u201cWe\u2019re super early and we move fast. Our\napproach into [using AI to control] third-party apps \u2014 there\u2019s no other route\nand we have some pretty strong patents.\u201d\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * A.I.\n  * Technology\n\n", "frontpage": false}
