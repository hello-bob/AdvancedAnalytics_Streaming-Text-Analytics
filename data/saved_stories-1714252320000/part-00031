I had intended this to\nbe written and published in a few weeks after the NixOS foundation board had\ntime to react and attempt to control the damage from whatever the fuck has\nbeen going on over there.\n\nI just don't care at this point. I need this out of my head and off of my\nchest.\n\nI would also like to have made this a video of some kind to make it more\npersonal (mostly so you can hear my voice and intonation/emotion in it), but\nit would take me too long to make it at my current production schedule\ntimelines. I've already been spending a fucking month working on a mostly done\nPikmin 3 speedrun video that has been constantly interrupted by this shit. As\nmuch as I'd like to do this, I don't think it's in the cards.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm not decrying the tech behind Nix or NixOS as wrong here.\nMy gripes are purely with community management, moderation, and all of the\nsoft squishy stuff that comes with dealing with humans.\n\nThis post contains massive spoilers for Neon Genesis Evangelion, The End of\nEvangelion, and the four part revival Evangelion movies.\n\n## A Cruel Angel's Thesis\n\nIn order to properly convey the level of emotions that I feel about this\nsituation, I need you to understand the weight of The End of Evangelion.\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is an anime series that debuted in October 1995. It is\nwidely considered to be one of the best anime series ever made. It is a story\nabout humanity fighting back against existential threats in a last-ditch\nattempt to stop the apocalypse. Evangelion was also a bit of a satirical\nresponse to the anime zeitgeist of the time. The big story telling meme of the\ntime was having teenagers get powerful robots in order to save humanity. The\ncore premise of Evangelion is \"what if kids got into giant robots to save the\nworld, but it broke them?\"\n\nIf you've never seen it before, Evangelion is a terribly depressing anime. It\nis the kind of thing that disturbs the comforted and comforts the disturbed. I\nthink that it combined with the follow-up movies are peak fiction. It is\nsomething that you should not watch in a single sitting if you haven't seen it\nbefore.\n\nThe key art for this article was taken from the movie The End of Evangelion.\nWhen the original Evangelion series was made, they ran out of time right at\nthe end and had to make something up that would roughly make sense for\neverybody that's viewed it. The ending sucked, but made a lot of thematic\nsense. The showrunner was so frustrated with this ending that he actually\nended up getting funding to make the ending that he wanted to make in the\nfirst place, which was released on film as The End of Evangelion.\n\nOne of the key scenes in the movie is near the end. Humanity had lost. Well,\njust saying that is probably kind of an understatement. Humanity had lost so\nbadly that they had no possible way to continue. Those three people in that\nimage were all that remained of humanity. Shinji and Asuka just stood there\nwaiting to watch for the lights of the sky as humanity was at its end.\n\nThe scene was entirely still.\n\nAnd then music started:\n\nThis song has been stuck in my head for the last couple days. If you take a\ncouple minutes to listen to it, you will instantly understand why this song\nand all of those thematic meanings are going through my head as I analyze the\nsituation involving Nix and NixOS. It all has just come tumbling down,\ntumbling down, tumbling down.\n\nI just can't help but think that this was so preventable.\n\n## The end of Nix/Nix OS\n\nWhen I posted this image to Twitter and Mastodon recently (and back when I\nsent my emails initially), I was intentionally invoking that kind of hopeless\nfeeling of defeat that Shinji and Asuka felt at The End of Evangelion. That\nhopeless feeling of \"Shaka, when the walls fell\" but more. The Nix and NixOS\nproject have not been having a good year these last two weeks.\n\nA lot of the existing tension has boiled over and it has been poorly managed\nto the point where things are becoming irreconcilable. I'm at the point where\nI am going to move away from NixOS for new future things and not use flakes\nfor managing my dependencies in development.\n\nA lot of this started with governance issues surrounding moderation.\nModeration in online spaces is very... Very difficult at the least. Nearly\nimpossible at most. Moderation is a thankless task. Good moderation is\ninvisible. Bad moderation gets you complained at constantly. There is no\nwinning. It is especially bad when the foundation that attempts to arbitrate\nissues has the idea of being incredibly centrist and not wanting to commit to\nany given position.\n\nThis is the situation when the initial moderation team RFC was created. There\nwere people that \"did moderation\", but there was no team of moderators.\nModeration just sort of happened reactively in response to things getting way\nout of hand rather than proactively to create a healthy relationship between\nmembers of the community. The biggest thing that went poorly was the attempt\nto introduce a code of conduct so that everybody is on the same page and\nplaying field. A code of conduct also helps make people like me not feel like\nwe are at risk of being harassed for wanting to participate in a technical\ntool. There was concern trolling abound.\n\nA lot of this tension has boiled over over the years. I had incorrectly\nassumed that it had been handled because it has been three years. Obviously\nmoderation things happened in the background within three years. Right?\n\nNo, wrong! People were still fucking concern trolling about the most middest\nof mid complaints on the code of conduct like it was fucking 2021.\n\nA lot of this stuff has boiled over to the point where I couldn't ignore it\nanymore. In about the second week of April, I sent the NixOS Foundation an\nemail thread addressing my fears with how the community is turning out. I was\nafraid of many things when I wrote that email. One of the biggest things I was\nafraid of is a lot of the people that I know that are incredibly passionate\nand capable becoming burnt out to a crisp trying to make this better.\n\nI'll publish those emails eventually, but for now just know that I tried to\nmeddle behind the scenes to make this timeline not be the one we got. One of\nmy demands was that they adopt the vanilla unmodified Contributor Covenant as\nthe code of conduct for the Nix/NixOS project. The moderation team snuck a\nslightly modified version in at the 11th hour a few months ago and I thought\nthat was okay-ish. I'm just not pleased with the situation.\n\n## It just keeps tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down\n\nAnd then on Friday April 26th, the de facto benevolent dictator for life\ndecided to write and post something on his corporate blog:\nhttps://determinate.systems/posts/on-community-in-nix/. I would say that\narticle was tone deaf, but I don't know if the concept of tonality actually\nregistered in the process of writing it.\n\nI've been told that Eelco is not in fact the benevolent dictator for life, but\nI just can't believe it. He acts like one in how sweeping changes and\nannouncements get dictated from the heavens. Nobody on the NixOS foundation\nboard was aware of that blogpost before it was published.\n\nThis article flopped so hard that there's a \"Maintainers leaving\" milestone:\nhttps://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/milestone/27?closed=1. That person that wrote\nthe \"leaving the Determinate Systems community\" one also ended up writing this\nepic \"I'm quitting\" message that was totally misinterpreted:\nhttps://paste.shark-\nharmonic.ts.net/paste/abd339e0-2317-402b-8d8e-97e580537263/md.\n\nBefore this blog post was released, I was working with various NixOS\nFoundation board members to make sure that things don't get to this point. For\na lot of people, that Eelco blog post was the point of the trust thermocline.\nThe trust thermocline is the point where people will totally mistrust you and\nwhat you are doing to the point where they will accept inferior alternatives\ninstead of your product. In a lot of spaces I've been looking at, people are\nbasically spreading to the wind.\n\nAt this point, I am fairly sure that a fork of Nix and NixOS is not just\ninevitable, but it's just a matter of time, energy, resources, and willpower.\nI doubt that there will be sufficient will to make such a fork. Nix is\nbecoming radioactive.\n\nI was also hoping that if a fork happened it would end up being an io.js\nsituation. In that story, the Forked project ended up being adopted back into\nthe main project. It ended up being the thing that saved node.js from\nirrelevance.\n\nI did not want to get to this point. I have been working in the background in\norder to avoid us getting to this point. My efforts have failed. This is the\ntimeline we got.\n\nMaybe Rocky Linux and Ansible will be good enough for me. I'm gonna miss the\nfuck out of NixOS' declarative everything. There's nothing quite like\ndevShells.\n\nI've spoken at my last NixCon. Until this week I've wanted to do it again, but\nI just can't bother to care anymore.\n\n## It all returns to \"nothing\"\n\nWhen analyzing Evangelion lore, there is something that I intentionally\nomitted. The reason that humanity lost the third impact is because nobody\nbothered to care to make things better. Everybody had been burnt out so much\nthat they just gave up.\n\nHistorically when I've been trying to understand Evangelion, that is the one\nthing that just stood out to me as wrong. Why would people just give up? Why\nwouldn't they want to have a better future? Why wouldn't you want something to\nbe better in general? Why wouldn't you want to have life or living?\n\nYeah, I completely fucking understand why they gave up now.\n\n## The Third Impact\n\nAs I mentioned earlier in my author's note, I've been trying to make a video\nfor the last month. I am almost done with it. I just need to film something in\nperson to thank my patrons and the lighting in my hotel room in New Orleans is\nnot cooperating with me in the slightest.\n\nDealing with this shit (and making sure the open letter goes over smoothly)\nhas been taking up enough energy that I'm just exhausted at this point.\nHonestly, once that Eelco blog post dropped, I almost deleted everything from\nmy blog about Nix and NixOS. Just flat out fucking deleted them. The main\nthing that stopped me is the fact that I am traveling for work at time of\nwriting and have inconsistent internet access.\n\nIn the wake of this, I have been dealing with a unique form of imposter\nsyndrome. I know that what I'm about to say is a false assertion, but it\nreally feels like I have created more pain than good by introducing people to\nthis ecosystem in its current form. This is a very unsettling feeling to have.\nConsciously, I know it is a false realization. I know that it makes no sense\nto think that. I know that at that point I was doing what I thought was\ncorrect and I was doing what I thought was right and good and I was doing it\nin good faith.\n\nThen unforeseen consequences happened.\n\nI will be a lot more cautious about advocating for technology in the future.\n\nFacts and circumstances may have changed since publication.
