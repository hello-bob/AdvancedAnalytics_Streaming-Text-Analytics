Ponzi issued bonds\nwhich offered 50% interest in 45 days, or a 100% profit if held for 90 days.\nThe supposed source of this windfall was the differential earned on trading in\npostal coupons. The actual profit on the postal coupons never amounted to more\nthan a fraction of a penny each, but it didn't matter to Ponzi since this was\nnot the true source of his profits.Ponzi opened his company, \"The Securities\nExchange Company,\" at 27 School Street in Boston the day after Christmas 1919.\nHe was penniless at the time and had to borrow $200 from a furniture dealer in\norder to furnish his new office. Within days he was collecting money from his\ninitial rounds of investors. He then expanded the circle of investors by\ncollecting money from a larger round of investors. When the bonds of the first\ninvestors came due he paid them, with their miraculous profit, using the money\ncollected from the second round of investors. The news of these extraordinary\nprofits swept up and down the east coast and thousands of investors flocked to\nPonzi's office for an opportunity to give him their money. Using the money\nfrom this new surge of investors he paid off the next round of bonds as they\ncame due, with their full profit, which excited even more frenzy.During the\nheady days of the spring and early summer of 1920 Ponzi was the toast of the\nnortheast as people rushed to place their economic security in his capable\nhands. As Ponzi himself described the result:\"A huge line of investors, four\nabreast, stretched from the City Hall Annex . . . all the way to my office! .\n. . Hope and greed could be read in everybody's countenance. Guessed from the\nwads of money nervously clutched and waved by thousands of outstretched fists!\nMadness, money madness, was reflected in everybody's eyes! . . .To the crowd\nthere assembled, I was the realization of their dreams . . . The 'wizard' who\ncould turn a pauper into a millionaire overnight.\"| The Schemer Himself  \n---  \n  \nThe Problem With A Ponzi Deal\n\nThe problem with Ponzi's investment scheme is that it is difficult to sustain\nthis game very long because to continue paying the promised profits to early\ninvestors you need an ever-larger pool of later investors. The idea behind\nthis type of swindle is that the con-man collects his money from his second or\nthird round of investors and then beats it out of town before anyone else\ncomes around to collect. These schemes typically only last weeks, or months at\nmost. There is of course always the temptation to stay around just a little\nlonger to collect another round of investments--especially since each new\nround has to be bigger than the ones before. But Ponzi made another, equally\nfatal, error. He became a member of high society and once he had gotten the\ntaste of this life, he couldn't give it up.\n\nThe Decline & Fall of the First Ponzi Scheme\n\nAlthough he started his business as a penniless coupon clipper, by the end of\nMay 1920 Ponzi was able to purchase a palatial home in the banker's colony of\nhistoric Lexington. He also acquired a 38% interest in Boston's Hanover Trust\nBank and became an instant pillar of the community.\n\nPonzi started his scheme on December 26th. Precisely seven months later, on\nJuly 26th, at the insistence of the Massachusetts District Attorney, Ponzi\nquit accepting deposits from new investors. It was estimated that Ponzi had\nbeen taking in $200,000 a day of new investments prior to the halt. At that\npoint he had already collected almost $10,000,000 from about 10,000 investors.\nAs word got out about his legal troubles, worried investors swarmed his\noffice. Ponzi confidently greeted them and assured them all was well. He\nannounced he would continue to pay matured notes at face value. Unmatured\nnotes would be refunded in the amount of the original investment for those not\nwilling to wait. He assured investors and law enforcement personnel that he\nhad millions in banks here and abroad, far in excess of his liabilities.\n\nFrom July 26th until he was jailed on August 13th, Ponzi kept up this\npractice, appearing at the office each day and redeeming bonds from worried\ninvestors. During this time he actually redeemed $5,000,000 of his bonds in a\nfutile attempt to convince the authorities that he was on the up and up. At\nhis bankruptcy trial, it was discovered that Ponzi still had bonds outstanding\nin the amount of $7,000,000 and total assets of about $2,000,000. Indeed, the\nseemingly lucky investors who redeemed their bonds after July 26th had to\nreturn their windfalls to the bankruptcy court to be distributed among Ponzi's\nlarger circle of creditors. Ultimately, after about seven years of litigation,\nPonzi's disillusioned investors got back 37 cents on the dollar of their\nprincipal, with, of course, no whiff of any profits from the nation's first\nand most notorious Ponzi scheme.\n\nDuring his trial Ponzi's attorneys considered a defense of \"financial\ndementia.\" Ponzi's acquaintances testified that for more than twenty years he\nwas obsessed with devising various grand plans for amassing immense wealth.\nPerhaps, after all, Charles Ponzi believed in his own scheme.\n\nThe Logic of Ponzi Schemes, Chain Letters & Pyramid Schemes\n\nThe essence of the Ponzi scheme was that Ponzi used the money he received from\nlater investors to pay extravagant rates of return to early investors, thereby\ninducing more investors to place their money with him in the false hope of\nrealizing this same extravagant rate of return themselves. This works only so\nlong as there is an ever-increasing number of new investors coming into the\nscheme.\n\nTo pay a 100% profit to the first 1,000 investors you need the money from\n1,000 new investors. Now there are 2000 \"investors\" in the scheme, and in the\nsecond round of payouts to pay the same return to these 2,000 investors in the\nnext round, you need the money from 2,000 new investors--bringing the number\nof participants to 4,000. And to pay these 4,000, you will end up with 8,000\n\"investors,\" then 16,000--and so on.\n\nIf all the investors stay in the scheme, the number of participanats would\ndouble after every round of payouts. Even starting with only 1,000\n\"investors,\" by the 20th round of payouts you would need more new investors\nthan the entire population of the U.S. Eventually, the number of new investors\nthat would have to be found would exceed the population of the earth.\nTypically, however, Ponzi schemes collapse long before they reach their\ntheoretical limit as an ever-increasing number of new participants cannot be\nfound.\n\nPonzi Progression Starting with 1,000 \"Investors\"  \n---  \nPayout Rounds| Number of Participants  \nRound 1 Round 2 Round 3 Round 4 Round 5 Round 6 Round 7 Round 8 Round 9 Round\n10 Round 11 Round 12 Round 13 Round 14 Round 15 Round 16 Round 17 Round 18\nRound 19 Round 20| 1,000 2,000 4,000 8,000 16,000 32,000 64,000 128,000\n256,000 512,000 1,024,000 2,048,000 4,096,000 8,192,000 16,384,000 32,768,000\n65,536,000 131,072,000 262,144,000 524,288,000  \n  \nIn the classic chain-letter scheme 1 person gets, say, 10 people to make an\ninvestment and each in turn get 10 additional people to invest, who then in\ntheir turn must each get 10, and so on. The money for the first 10 \"investors\"\ncomes from the 10 they enroll, and the money for the second group of 10 comes\nfrom the 10 investors that each of them enrolls, and so on. Diagrammatically,\nsuch a scheme looks like a pyramid--hence its alternative name\n\n1 10 100 1,000 10,000 100,000 1,000,000 10,000,000 100,000,000 1,000,000,000\n10,000,000,000  \n---  \n  \nThe reason that this is a scheme and not an investment strategy, is that the\ngeometric progression it depends on is unsustainable. You must continually get\nmore and more new people into the system to pay-off the promises to the\nearlier members. After a few rounds of this kind of increase, the number of\nnew participants in the next round would be larger than the number of persons\non the earth. That's why all pyramid schemes must inevitably come crashing\ndown\n\n(The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has a one-page factsheet on their\nWeb site explaining why pyramid schemes are not legitimate investments.)  \n---  \n  \nThe Logic of Pay-As-You-Go Systems\n\nIn contrast to a Ponzi scheme, dependent upon an unsustainable progression, a\ncommon financial arrangement is the so-called \"pay-as-you-go\" system. Some\nprivate pension systems, as well as Social Security, have used this design. A\npay-as-you-go system can be visualized as a pipeline, with money from current\ncontributors coming in the front end and money to current beneficiaries paid\nout the back end.\n\nThere is a superficial analogy between pyramid or Ponzi schemes and pay-as-\nyou-go programs in that in both money from later participants goes to pay the\nbenefits of earlier participants. But that is where the similarity ends. A\npay-as-you-go system can be visualized as a simple pipeline, with money from\ncurrent contributors coming in the front end and money to current\nbeneficiaries paid out the back end.\n\nSo we could image that at any given time there might be, say, 40 million\npeople receiving benefits at the back end of the pipeline; and as long as we\nhad 40 million people paying taxes in the front end of the pipe, the program\ncould be sustained forever. It does not require a doubling of participants\nevery time a payment is made to a current beneficiary, or a geometric increase\nin the number of participants. (There does not have to be precisely the same\nnumber of workers and beneficiaries at a given time--there just needs to be a\nfairly stable relationship between the two.) As long as the amount of money\ncoming in the front end of the pipe maintains a rough balance with the money\npaid out, the system can continue forever. There is no unsustainable\nprogression driving the mechanism of a pay-as-you-go pension system and so it\nis not a pyramid or Ponzi scheme.\n\nIn this context, it would be most accurate to describe Social Security as a\ntransfer payment--transferring income from the generation of workers to the\ngeneration of retirees--with the promise that when current workers retiree,\nthere will be another generation of workers behind them who will be the source\nof their Social Security retirement payments. So you could say that Social\nSecurity is a transfer payment, but it is not a pyramid scheme. There is a\nhuge difference between the two, and only a superficial similarity.\n\nIf the demographics of the population were stable, then a pay-as-you-go system\nwould not have demographically-driven financing ups and downs and no\nthoughtful person would be tempted to compare it to a Ponzi arrangement.\nHowever, since population demographics tend to rise and fall, the balance in\npay-as-you-go systems tends to rise and fall as well. During periods when more\nnew participants are entering the system than are receiving benefits there\ntends to be a surplus in funding (as in the early years of Social Security).\nDuring periods when beneficiaries are growing faster than new entrants (as\nwill happen when the baby boomers retire), there tends to be a deficit. This\nvulnerability to demographic ups and downs is one of the problems with pay-as-\nyou-go financing. But this problem has nothing to do with Ponzi schemes, or\nany other fraudulent form of financing, it is simply the nature of pay-as-you-\ngo systems.\n\nThe Start-Up Problem In Pension Programs\n\nThere is one other aspect of Social Security, and many private pension\nsystems, that sometimes leads people to a mistaken analogy with Ponzi schemes,\nand that is the \"bonus\" paid to early participants in a pension system.\n\nDuring the start-up of a new pension system the money paid to early\nparticipants is usually much in excess of their contributions and higher than\nthe \"return\" to later participants. This is because people who are nearing the\nend of their working career will not have an opportunity to participate in the\npension system long enough to accrue a significant benefit if computed\nstrictly on an actuarial basis. There are three options: exclude such people\nfrom the system; leave them with an inadequate pension; or provide some kind\nof subsidy to early participants beyond what is justified by their\ncontributions. In private pensions this differential is usually made up by\nsubsidies from the employer. In public pensions this differential is funded by\nassessing higher taxes than would otherwise be necessary to pay a level\nbenefit to all participants and using these additional taxes to pay higher\nbenefits to early participants.\n\nThe first recipient of monthly Social Security payments was Ida May Fuller.\nMiss Fuller worked for about three years under the new Social Security program\nand paid $24.75 in payroll taxes. Her first Social Security check in January\n1940 was for $22.54--she almost got her money back in her very first payment.\nMiss Fuller lived to be 100 years old and collected more than $22,000 in\nbenefits.\n\nThis type of \"bonus\" to early participants should not be confused with the\nmechanics of pyramid schemes. This type of benefit to early participants in a\npension system has nothing to do with an investment scheme using Ponzi-like\nprogressions to show false returns to early participants. In private pensions\nthis bonus is simply an expression of the employer's beneficence. In public\npensions it is an expression of public policy. In the context of the early\nyears of the Social Security program it was an expression of a public policy\nwhich held that workers already old should not be turned away penniless. This\nspirit of public generosity has nothing to do with Ponzi schemes.\n\nPonzi vs. Social Security\n\nSocial Security is and always has been either a \"pay-as-you-go\" system or one\nthat was partially advance-funded. Its structure, logic, and mode of operation\nhave nothing in common with Ponzi schemes or chain letters or pyramid schemes.\n\nThe first modern social insurance program began in Germany in 1889 and has\nbeen in continuous operation for more than 100 years. The American Social\nSecurity system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935.\nCharles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days.  \n  \nLarry DeWitt Historian's Office January 2009  \n  \nPrivacy Policy | Website Policies & Other Important Information | Site Map| Need Larger Text?  \n---|---\n\n", "frontpage": false}
