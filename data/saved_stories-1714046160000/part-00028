You figure out your monthly expenses,\nyour savings, and any income you have coming in. Divide your savings (or at\nleast the amount you want to spend) by the expenses less the income, and you\nget the amount of time available to work on the startup before you run out of\nmoney.\n\nYou definitely want to pad this a bit, because if you run out of money, you\u2019ll\nneed some time to find another source of income. You can also pad this with\ndebt, selling other assets, part time work, investment, etc. Heck, maybe the\nstartup will even make some money too.\n\nBut the goal is to have an idea of how long you can go before you have to call\nit quits for financial reasons. Then you can see if you think you can build\nthe company in that amount of time. (Hint, it\u2019s going to take longer than you\nthink to build the company.)\n\nEmotional runway is another key aspect of surviving a startup. Startups are\nfull of a lot of stress. Some examples:\n\n  * Making decisions on limited data\n  * Dealing with a product that is broken because of the speed at which you built it\n  * Screwing up and apologizing to customers for said screwup\n  * Dealing with financial uncertainty\n  * Hiring\n  * Firing\n  * Limited or nonexistent support structure\n  * Trying to figure out how to build a company\n  * Personnel conflicts\n  * Missing family time because of work\n  * Lack of vacation/benefits\n  * And, of course, the possibility of running out of money\n\nAll of the above make it tough to \u2018tough out\u2019 a startup. These are all costs\nthat you will have to bear. Just like you only have a certain amount of\nsavings to spend down, you also only have a certain amount of emotional wealth\nto spend. (There are times when a startup will deliver emotional wealth too.)\n\nOne of the hardest parts of the current startup for me is keeping an eye on my\nemotional runway. Taking some time off, celebrating successes, being open\nabout the stresses with co-founders and family, and just being aware of what\nputs \u201cmoney\u201d into the emotional piggy bank and what takes it out are all ways\nI\u2019ve dealt with this.\n\nBusiness The Food Corridor | moore | January 3, 2018\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n* Reference checking: not just for VCs and
