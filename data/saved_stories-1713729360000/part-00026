This guide will explain\nthe ins and outs of uBlock Origin\u2019s advanced features, including adding custom\nlists, creating custom user filters, setting up dynamic blocking rules, and\nadjusting rules for uBlock Origin on specific domains with the advanced user\ninterface.\n\nTech and Gaming\n\n0 seconds of 34 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nCopied\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n00:34\n\n00:34\n\nContent\n\n  * Installing uBlock Origin\n  * Setting Up Advanced Options\n  * Dynamic Filtering Rules\n  * Saving and Reverting Filtering Rules\n  * Third-Party Scripts and Frames\n  * Viewing and Editing Dynamic Rules\n  * Removing Elements with Static Rules\n  * Finding and Using Custom Filter Lists\n  * Storing and Syncing Rules\n  * Conclusion\n\n## Installing uBlock Origin\n\nA pre-built version of the uBlock Origin extension is available for Google\nChrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Opera. You can also build the\nextension manually from source for Firefox and Chrome.\n\nAlso read: uBlock Origin \u2013 Better Than AdBlock Plus?\n\nA quick warning: uBlock Origin is not and has never been connected to\nublock.org or the uBlock extension. The Origin part in the name is very\nimportant in distinguishing between these two unrelated projects that once\nshared a similar codebase. ublock.org and the uBlock extension should be\navoided, as they are imitators that purposefully confuse the market to steal\ndata and deceive users. Be sure you have uBlock Origin and not uBlock.\n\n## Setting Up Advanced Options\n\nBefore we can do anything interesting with uBlock Origin, we need to enable\nadvanced settings. Make sure to check out the required reading before you\nproceed. If you lack the troubleshooting experience to manage these types of\ndecisions, consider reading up on how cookies work before you start tinkering\nwith their functionality. Otherwise, expect the unexpected!\n\n1\\. Click on the uBlock Origin extension\u2019s icon.\n\n2\\. Click the Settings icon.\n\n3\\. Tick the box next to \u201cI am an advanced user.\u201d\n\nOnce you have advanced settings enabled, you can adjust blocking settings on a\ngranular level.\n\n## Dynamic Filtering Rules\n\nFiltering is handled in uBlock Origin at two levels: globally and locally.\nGlobal rules apply to all URLs, while local rules are for the current URL\nonly.\n\nThe first column specifies the URL that the content originates from.\n\nThe second column indicates global settings, which are inherited by the\nspecific URLs.\n\nThe third column indicates local rules for the current URL.\n\nIf you mouse over a box in the \u201cglobal\u201d or \u201clocal\u201d rules column, you\u2019ll see\nred, grey, and green thirds.\n\nClick on the red third to set a blocking rule for the associated content type.\nThe green third permits the corresponding element. The grey third sets a\n\u201cnoop\u201d rule, which stands for \u201cno operation.\u201d This setting will prevent uBlock\nOrigin from taking action on the associated content. Setting a \u201cnoop\u201d filter\nwill override global settings for a specific URL.\n\nAt the top of the window are content types. These can be blocked at the global\nand URL-specific level. These are blunt filters but useful nonetheless.\n\nUnder the content types are the URLs loaded on the current webpage. A plus\nicon indicates that content from that URL is being permitted. A minus icon\nindicates that content from the URL is being blocked. You can sometimes see a\nmixture of pluses and minuses for one URL, which indicates that some of the\ncontent is permitted while other content is blocked.\n\nYou can also look at the color coding next to the URL. Green indicates that\ncontent from that URL is permitted. Yellow indicates that some content from\nthat URL is blocked. Red indicates that all content from the URL will be\nblocked.\n\nSettings an inherited based on specificity. For example, global content type\nrules have the lowest priority. Rules set on filtering lists have a medium\npriority ranking: they can override global settings, but not URL-specific user\nsettings. The highest priority is given to URL-specific local rules set by the\nuser.\n\n## Saving and Reverting Filtering Rules\n\nChanges you make to filtering rules are automatically reset the next time you\nvisit a website. To make your settings permanent, click the lock icon.\n\nTo revert to the last saved state, click the eraser icon.\n\n## Third-Party Scripts and Frames\n\nIn general, it\u2019s a good idea to block third-party scripts and frames by\ndefault. This protects both your privacy and your eyeballs. It can also break\nwebsites, so keep a quick finger on the \u201cnoop\u201d override.\n\nTo block third-party scripts and frames, click the red third of the box next\nto each in the global column. This will automatically block all third-party\nscripts and frames on every URL.\n\nIf a website breaks, you can set a \u201cnoop\u201d override to permit third-party\nscripts and frames. Click the grey box in the local rules column to set a\n\u201cnoop\u201d rule and override the global blocking rule for this URL.\n\nThis noop rule will only apply to the current URL.\n\nAlternatively, you can also hunt down the URL of the blocked resource and\npermit that resource specifically. This is easiest with the third-party frame\nhas a clear origin, like a YouTube or Twitter embed. If you permit those\nframes globally and save the rule, those URL-specific filters will trump the\nglobal content type filters.\n\nBy balancing global and local filters with content type filters, you can set\nsensible online privacy settings while permitting content you don\u2019t find as\nobjectionable.\n\n## Viewing and Editing Dynamic Rules\n\nTo view the filters that you\u2019ve already set, look at uBlock Origin\u2019s Settings\npage under the My Rules tab. Here, you\u2019ll see the rules you\u2019ve set in two\nlists. The list on the left is for permanent rules and the list on the right\nis for temporary rules, as indicated by their headings.\n\nThe text contents of the right-most temporary rule column can be edited\ndirectly with the cursor, mouse, and keyboard. If uBlock Origin detects a\ndifference between the two columns, you\u2019ll see contextual buttons labeled\n\u201cRevert\u201d and \u201cCommit\u201d that offer the option to sync the columns with one\nanother. Click \u201cRevert\u201d to copy the unchanged contents of the permanent rule\nlist to the temporary rules list. Click \u201cCommit\u201d to copy the change from the\ntemporary rules list to the permanent rules list.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that the text formatting of the rules follows specific\nconventions. The syntax is like so:\n\n    \n    \n    [parent site hostname] [element hostname] [request type] [rule]\n\nIf you follow the dynamic filtering rules syntax guide on uBlock Origin\u2019s\nGitHub page, you can change and set rules with text strings directly from this\npane.\n\nAlso read: How to Get More Out of Your Adblocker\n\n## Removing Elements with Static Rules\n\nIf you want to remove elements from the page using graphical tools, you can\naccess that feature by setting cosmetic rules. These rules remove DOM elements\nbased on a graphically-based node selection by the user. If you see something\non a website that bothers you, like a email subscription banner, an ad-block\ndetector, or anything else offensive to your sensibilities, you can remove it\nthis way.\n\n### Temporary Rules: Element Zapper\n\nThere are two different ways to set cosmetic rules in uBlock Origin. The first\nis with the Element Zapper, accessed through the lightning bolt icon on uBlock\nOrigin\u2019s extension dropdown pane.\n\nThis tool sets a temporary rule removing the specified DOM element. With the\nnext browser session, the element will return. To create a rule, click the\nelement zapper icon, and then click on the page element you want to remove. As\nyou mouse over various DOM elements, they\u2019ll be colored yellow to indicate\nwhat element is currently selected. Once the right element is selected, click\nto remove the selected element instantly. No confirmation box will appear\nafter clicking\n\nThe element zapper will do its best to pick the element you\u2019ve selected, but\nyou might need to dance your mouse around a bit to get the element you\u2019re\nhoping for. It will attempt to adhere to the largest DOM object that its\nalgorithm can locate and select.\n\n### Permanent Rules: Element Picker\n\nTo set a permanent rule, use the Element Picker, represented by the eyedropper\nicon to the right of the lightning bolt.\n\nThis will activate an interface similar to the element zapper, but now DOM\nelements will be highlighted in red instead of yellow.\n\nWhen you click on the red highlighted element, a text box will appear in the\nlower-right, previewing the class or ID of the selected element. It\u2019s this\ntext-based class or ID match that will be used to remove the element in the\nfuture. And since many sites obfuscate their code to make ad blocking more\ndifficult, you may need to refine the element picker\u2019s automatic selection\nfrom time to time. You can also use this tool to select \u201clayers\u201d of the DOM\nthat are completely obscured or exist only in DOM logic.\n\nTo select a different element, mouse over its name in the yellow box below the\nwhite text box. Click on the text to see the associated element highlighted in\nred.\n\nWhen the correct element is selected, click the \u201cCreate\u201d button to create the\nrule and remove the element. You can also click the adjacent \u201cPick\u201d button to\nreturn to the element picker if you selected the wrong part of the page.\n\nIn the future you can find the rule in uBlock Origin\u2019s settings under the \u201cMy\nFilters\u201d tab. New rules will appear at the bottom of the list with their data\nand timestamp.\n\nIf you want to ignore a rule, you can type an exclamation point at the\nbeginning of the line to comment out the element rule. You can also see\nadditional static filer syntax in uBlock Origin\u2019s documentation on GitHub.\n\n## Finding and Using Custom Filter Lists\n\nuBlock Origin comes with some preset filter lists, but there are many more you\ncan add. The easiest way to add more filters is to browse FilterLists.\n\nIf you find a filter list you want to add to uBlock Origin\u2019s filters, click\n\u201cDetails\u201d and then \u201cSubscribe.\u201d This will automatically download and include\nthe list in uBlock Origin\u2019s blocking rules for websites visited in the future.\nOnly lists with the uBlock Origin icon can be added to uBlock Origin in this\nway.\n\nThese filters will then appear under the \u201cFilter Lists\u201d tab in uBlock Origin\u2019s\noptions page. They can be viewed and toggled from that page in the future.\n\n## Storing and Syncing Rules\n\nTo make a local backup of your uBlock Origin rules, you can save your settings\nout to a file. Find the dialog options at the bottom of the main uBlock Origin\nsettings tab.\n\nIf you want to use the browser-based cloud storage for extensions, you can\ntick the \u201cEnable cloud storage\u201d option on the main page of uBlock Origin\u2019s\nsettings. This will allow you to upload data within the extension\u2019s small file\nspace within the browser. This only syncs with other copies of the same\nbrowser, however.\n\nIf you upload your uBlock Origin settings in Firefox, you cannot then download\nthem in Chrome on another computer. As a result, sharing configurations\nthrough files is the most reliable method of the time being. To sync your\nrules among multiple browsers and computers, you can share the backup\nconfiguration text file over a cloud storage service.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nuBlock Origin isn\u2019t exactly an ad blocker. It\u2019s a wide-spectrum content\nblocker. That means it can control what comes into your browser no matter its\norigin. That makes it extremely powerful, and extremely easy to mess up. So\ntake care with what you do, and if something breaks, be prepared to fix it.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter!\n\nOur latest tutorials delivered straight to your inbox\n\nAlexander Fox\n\nAlexander Fox is a tech and science writer based in Philadelphia, PA with one\ncat, three Macs and more USB cables than he could ever use.\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Tweet\n\nRelated\n\n7 Free Ad Blockers That Perform Well on Microsoft Edge\n\n10 Funny Chrome Extensions to Prank Your Friends\n\nHow to Disable Web Page Auto-Refresh In Your Browser\n\nHow to See a Password in Your Browser Instead of Dots\n\n18 Hidden Google Games for You to Play\n\nAffiliate Disclosure: Make Tech Easier may earn commission on products\npurchased through our links, which supports the work we do for our readers.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Uqnic Network Pte Ltd.
