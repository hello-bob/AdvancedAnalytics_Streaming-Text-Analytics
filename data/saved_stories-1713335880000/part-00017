Photograph: Caitlin O\u2019Hara/The Guardian\n\nIn an unprecedented deal, a private company purchased land in a tiny Arizona\ntown \u2013 and sold its water rights to a suburb 200 miles away. Local residents\nfear the agreement has \u2018opened Pandora\u2019s box\u2019\n\nby Maanvi Singh in Cibola and Queen Creek, Arizona\n\nShare\n\nOne of the biggest battles over Colorado River water is being staged in one of\nthe west\u2019s smallest rural enclaves.\n\nTucked into the bends of the lower Colorado River, Cibola, Arizona, is a\ncommunity of about 200 people. Maybe 300, if you count the weekenders who come\nto boat and hunt. Dusty shrublands run into sleepy residential streets, which\nrun into neat fields of cotton and alfalfa.\n\nNearly a decade ago, Greenstone Resource Partners LLC, a private company\nbacked by global investors, bought almost 500 acres of agricultural land here\nin Cibola. In a first-of-its-kind deal, the company recently sold the water\nrights tied to the land to the town of Queen Creek, a suburb of Phoenix, for a\n$14m gross profit. More than 2,000 acre-feet of water from the Colorado River\nthat was once used to irrigate farmland is now flowing, through a canal\nsystem, to the taps of homes more than 200 miles away.\n\nA Guardian investigation into the unprecedented water transfer, and how it\ntook shape, reveals that Greenstone strategically purchased land and influence\nto advance the deal. The company was able to do so by exploiting the arcane\nwater policies governing the Colorado River.\n\nExperts expect that such transfers will become more common as thirsty towns\nacross the west seek increasingly scarce water. The climate crisis and chronic\noveruse have sapped the Colorado River watershed, leaving cities and farmers\nalike to contend with shortages. Amid a deepening drought and declines in the\nriver\u2019s reservoirs, Greenstone and firms like it have been discreetly\nacquiring thousands of acres of farmland.\n\n> Here we are in the middle of a drought trying to preserve the Colorado\n> River, and we\u2019re allowing water to be transferred off\n\nRegina Cobb, former state representative\n\nAs US states negotiate how they will divide up the river\u2019s dwindling supplies,\nofficials challenging the Greenstone transfer in court fear it will open the\nfloodgates to many more private water sales, allowing investors to profit from\nscarcity. The purchases have alarmed local residents, who worry that water\nspeculators scavenging agricultural land for valuable water rights will leave\nrural communities like Cibola in the dust.\n\n\u201cHere we are in the middle of a drought and trying to preserve the Colorado\nRiver, and we\u2019re allowing water to be transferred off of the river,\u201d said\nRegina Cobb, a former Republican state representative who has tried to limit\ntransfers. \u201cAnd in the process, we\u2019re picking winners and losers.\u201d\n\nIn February, a federal judge ruled that the Cibola-Queen Creek transfer was\ndone without proper environmental review, ordering the federal Bureau of\nReclamation to complete a more thorough evaluation. The US Department of\nJustice, which is representing the bureau in the legal proceeding, declined to\ncomment on whether the bureau would be appealing the decision.\n\nMeanwhile, Greenstone \u2013 which appears to be the first water brokerage firm to\nsell rights to the Colorado River \u2013 could help chart the course of how the\nresource can be bought and sold in the west.\n\n## The farm that was really an investment firm\n\nGreenstone first arrived in Cibola a decade ago \u2013 though few here knew\nanything of the company at the time. Through a subsidiary called GSC Farm LLC,\nthe company purchased 485 acres of land in the Cibola valley in 2013 and 2014,\nfor about $9.8m. Hardly anyone in town took notice.\n\n\u201cWhy would we?\u201d said Holly Irwin, a supervisor for La Paz county, which\nencompasses Cibola.\n\nQueen Creek is one of the fastest growing communities in Arizona and is\nheavily reliant on groundwater for its water supply. Photograph: Mario\nTama/Getty Images\n\nInitially, Greenstone leased that land back to farmers, who planted fields of\nalfalfa and rows of puffball cotton.\n\nThen, in 2018, the company sold the water tied to that farmland to Queen\nCreek, a fast-growing sprawl of gated communities on the outskirts of\nArizona\u2019s capital. The city\u2019s government agreed to pay the company $24m for\nthe annual entitlement to 2,033 acre-feet of Colorado River water.\n\nIn July of last year, amid continuing legal challenges and national scrutiny,\nthat water was finally diverted. The alfalfa and cotton fields were fallowed \u2013\nreduced to dry brush and cracked earth.\n\nMany in town were blindsided. \u201cWe were all just like: what the heck?\u201d Irwin\nrecalled.\n\nGSC Farm, she realized, wasn\u2019t really a farm at all \u2013 it was part of a water\ninvestment firm that had brokered water transfer deals all across the south-\nwest.\n\nGSC Farm is one of at least 25 subsidiaries and affiliates of Greenstone,\nregistered in Arizona and other states. Business registration records, deeds,\nloan documents and tax records show that these companies share the same\nexecutives. To local residents, including elected officials such as Irwin, it\nwas initially unclear that the business \u2013 which had been acquiring thousands\nof acres of farmland not only in Cibola but across Arizona \u2013 went by so many\nnames.\n\nGreenstone\u2019s executives and lawyers did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s\nquestions about the company\u2019s corporate structure, its business model, and how\nit initiated the Queen Creek deal.\n\nPublic records revealed that Greenstone\u2019s financial backers include the global\ninvestment firm MassMutual and its subsidiary Barings, as well as public\npension funds. At least one of its acquisitions appears to be financed by Rabo\nAgriFinance, a subsidiary of the Dutch multinational banking and financial\nservices company Rabobank.\n\nOn its website, Greenstone describes itself as \u201ca water company\u201d and as \u201ca\ndeveloper and owner of reliable, sustainable water supplies\u201d. Its CEO, Mike\nSchlehuber, previously worked for Vidler Water Company \u2013 another firm that\nessentially brokers water supply \u2013 as well as Summit Global Management, a\ncompany that invests in water suppliers and water rights. Greenstone\u2019s\nmanaging director and vice-president, Mike Malano \u2013 a former realtor based in\nPhoenix who remains \u201cactive in the Arizona development community\u201d, per his\ncompany bio \u2013 got himself elected to the board of the Cibola valley irrigation\nand drainage district, a quasi-governmental organization that oversees the\ndistribution of water for agriculture in the region.\n\nIrwin was horrified. She felt that a company with ties to big banks and real\nestate developers, posing as a farm, had infiltrated her small town and sold\noff its most precious resource.\n\nThe deal won\u2019t have an immediate impact on Cibola\u2019s residents. It doesn\u2019t\naffect the municipal water supply. But she worries that the transfer will be\nthe first of many. And if more and more farms are fallowed to feed water to\ncities, what will become of rural towns along the river?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be like Owens Valley,\u201d she said, referring to the water grab that\ninspired the movie Chinatown. In the early 20th century, agents working for\nthe city of Los Angeles, posing as farmers or ranchers, bought up land in the\nvalley and diverted its water to fuel their metropolis, leaving behind a\ndustbowl.\n\nBy allowing the Greenstone deal to go through, \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve opened\nPandora\u2019s box,\u201d she said.\n\nHolly Irwin, a La Paz county supervisor, fears the water transfer will be the\nfirst of many. Photograph: Caitlin O\u2019Hara/The Guardian\n\nThe Colorado River, which stretches from the Rocky Mountains into Mexico, has\ndeclined by about 20% since the turn of the century, amid the most severe\ndrought the west has seen in 1,200 years. In a painfully negotiated deal,\nArizona, Nevada and California agreed to reduce the amount of water they draw\nfrom the river by 13% through 2026. Experts warned that even deeper cuts would\nbe necessary in the coming decade, but states are currently deadlocked over a\nlonger-term conservation plan.\n\n\u201cWith ongoing shortages on the river, driven by climate change, Colorado River\nwater is going to become very valuable,\u201d said Rhett Larson, a professor of\nwater law at Arizona State University. \u201cAnyone who understands this dynamic\nthinks, \u2018Well, if I could buy Colorado River water rights, that\u2019s more\nvaluable than owning oil in this country at this stage.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough the price Queen Creek paid for the water was remarkable \u2013 amounting to\nmore than $11,500 per acre-foot \u2013 lawyers and water experts in Arizona told\nthe Guardian it would probably sell for even more today.\n\nThe process of selling and transferring the water, however, can be\nbureaucratic and complicated. In most cases, a company like Greenstone would\nhave to first convince fellow landowners in their local irrigation district to\nallow the sale, and then secure approvals from the state department of water\nresources and the US Bureau of Reclamation, the federal agency that manages\nwater in the west.\n\nWhat Irwin and many of Cibola\u2019s residents didn\u2019t realize was that in their\nsleepy, riverside town, a select group of farmers and landowners had been\nworking for years to facilitate such deals.\n\nTwo satellite maps of south-western Arizona. The top map has two towns marked\n- Cibola and Queen Creek - and a line connecting the two. The bottom map has\nfive tracts of land marked in orange next to the winding Colorado river\n\n## \u2018His dream was to sell this water\u2019\n\nIrrigation districts, as the name suggests, are designed to distribute water\nfor irrigation across the US west. These districts were formed in the 19th and\n20th centuries as cooperatives, allowing farmers to pool resources to develop\nwater infrastructure. In the Colorado River basin, the districts contract with\nthe Bureau of Reclamation to deliver water flowing through federal\ninfrastructure to farms and ranches.\n\nFarmers tend to be possessive of their precious water, explained Susanna Eden\nof the University of Arizona Water Resources Research Center. Most irrigation\ndistricts are set up to keep water for farming \u2013 and to keep it within their\njurisdictions.\n\nBut in the Cibola valley irrigation and drainage district (CVIDD), landowners\nseem to have anticipated the market potential of their water.\n\n\u201cIt has been said, and I think it has been demonstrated, that the Cibola\nvalley irrigation and drainage district was set up by people who were\ninvesting in water, rather than pure agriculturalists,\u201d said Eden.\n\nIn 1992, long before Greenstone arrived on the scene, CVIDD amended its\ncontract with the Bureau of Reclamation to explicitly contemplate \u201cwater\nexchange, water lease, water transfer\u201d or a change in the \u201ctype or place of\nuse\u201d of its water allotment.\n\nThe CVIDD board president, Michael Mullion, a farmer in Cibola who had been\nleasing land from GSC Farm in addition to tending his own land, vouched for\nthe Greenstone\u2019s water transfer at a 2019 hearing with the state\u2019s department\nof water resources. In his testimony, Mullion talked about how his grandfather\nhad come to the Cibola valley in 1949. \u201cHe brushed, cleared, levelled and\nbuilt the canals for this particular ground,\u201d he said. \u201cBut his dream was to\nactually sell this water.\u201d\n\n\u2018What are we willing to sacrifice?\u2019 A journey down America\u2019s most endangered\nriver\n\nRead more\n\nThe district\u2019s governing philosophy already aligned with Greenstone\u2019s, but the\ncompany\u2019s 500-acre purchase here allowed it to more directly influence the\ndistrict\u2019s policies. Irrigation district boards make key decisions about water\nin the district \u2013 and buying more land can buy more influence on the board.\nLandowners in the district are entitled to two votes for every acre they hold\nin board elections.\n\nThe district\u2019s board of directors now includes the heads of prominent farming\nfamilies in the area, including Mullion and his father, Bob, as well as\nGreenstone\u2019s vice-president, Malano.\n\nOver the years, CVIDD helped landowners, including Greenstone, gain more\nagency and direct control over their water rights. In most irrigation\ndistricts, the district contracts with the Bureau of Reclamation for the right\nto a lump sum of water, which it distributes to landowners and farmers.\n\nHowever, a review of CVIDD\u2019s contracts with the bureau revealed that between\n2006 and 2014, the district began removing itself as the middleman \u2013 giving a\nfew large landowners even more agency over how they use their water. Whereas\nin other irrigation districts, members would have to vote to approve a water\ntransfer like the Greenstone deal, in the Cibola valley, some landowners can\npropose transfers as they please, subject to federal approval.\n\nAmid growing public scrutiny of the Cibola-Queen Creek transfer, the CVIDD\nboard in 2019 unanimously approved a resolution disputing the idea that water\nrights are reserved for local use, and supporting landowners\u2019 right to change\n\u201cthe place of use and purpose of use\u201d of their water.\n\n\u201cI believe they\u2019ve been setting the stage for the Queen Creek transfer,\u201d said\nJamie Kelley, an attorney based in Bullhead City. \u201cThis was their long-term\nplan.\u201d\n\nMullion and lawyers representing CVIDD did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s\nquestions about its founding principles. They also did not address critiques\nthat their policies were set up to benefit landowners seeking to sell water\nrights.\n\nCarol Stewart in her store, the only shop in Cibola. Photograph: Caitlin\nO\u2019Hara/The Guardian\n\n## A community fights back\n\nEven now, after years of public debate and litigation, local residents remain\nbaffled by the idea that water could be sold and syphoned away from them, for\never.\n\nDown a dusty, two-lane road, just past the unassuming cream-colored building\nwhere the Cibola valley irrigation district is headquartered, a group gathered\nfor an informal meeting with Holly Irwin last summer to discuss their\ngrievances.\n\n\u201cWhy is somebody coming from so far away to take water from here?\u201d said Carol\nStewart, who runs Karlz Country Store \u2013 the only shop in town.\n\nShe hosted a handful of friends and neighbors, mostly retirees and recreators\nwho had settled here decades ago. Everyone huddled into Stewart\u2019s wood-paneled\nmobile home, a respite from the searing heat, and shouted their questions over\nthe buzz of the AC. What did the transfer mean? Would they have enough water\nto supply homes here?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the mighty dollar,\u201d Irwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about money, and how\nmuch they can come in and take advantage.\u201d\n\nThis deal wouldn\u2019t affect the town\u2019s residential water supplies, Irwin\nexplained. But it meant that more and more farmers might choose to sell out \u2013\nthe water that once irrigated Cibola\u2019s fields could be diverted away. And as\nthe Colorado River shrank, corporations were growing increasingly thirsty for\nrural supplies.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t we have water rights?\u201d asked John Rosenfeld, who has lived in Cibola\nfor 24 years. \u201cI have a right to that water, because I\u2019m paying for it.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t quite that simple, Irwin responded. Most of Cibola\u2019s residents get\ntheir water from a municipal supply or from private wells. But some properties\nhere come with water rights attached, sometimes dating back to before Arizona\nwas a US state. In the 1800s and the decades following, miners and farmers\ncould snatch water rights up and down the Colorado River simply by laying\nclaim to the water and putting it to use for livestock or irrigating land. It\ndidn\u2019t matter to these settlers that some of that water and land was taken\nfrom Indigenous tribes that were here before them.\n\nA cotton field in Cibola. Water rights have been passed down between\ngenerations in the area. Photograph: Caitlin O\u2019Hara/The Guardian\n\nThose water rights were then passed down from generation to generation. They\nwere formalized in agreements and interstate contracts that left some farming\nregions and tribes with the highest-priority water rights, while other rural\nand metropolitan areas received lower-priority rights. Such contracts assign\nwater rights a \u201cpriority level\u201d of one through six \u2013 priorities one through\nfour represent rights for permanent water service, whereas priorities five and\nsix represent the temporary rights to surplus supplies. The water rights\nGreenstone purchased in Cibola and sold to Queen Creek are fourth priority \u2013\npermanently secured and prized.\n\nNotably missing from the group at Karlz Country Store were farmers. The\nGuardian tried to contact a number of farmers in the region, but other than\nMullion, none were available for an interview. Not all agriculturalists are\ninterested in selling their water \u2013 but the option may be increasingly\nappealing as the climate crisis and water shortages disrupt their ability to\neffectively farm. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know, but demands create pressure,\u201d said Wade\nNoble, an attorney representing farmers with the Wellton-Mohawk irrigation and\ndrainage district, north of Cibola. \u201cThe drought on the river has created very\nhigh pressure.\u201d\n\nGreenstone isn\u2019t the only company coveting such water rights. Across the US\nwest, private investors have been scouring rural communities in search of\nhigh-priority water rights. In Arizona, Greenstone and firms like it have\nacquired thousands of acres of irrigable land and their corresponding water\nrights.\n\nIn the Cibola valley, for example, Western Water LLC, another company that\nspecializes in \u201cthe sale and transfer of water rights\u201d, owns about 100 acres\nof land, along with its entitlement to a modest 620 acre-feet of water, public\nrecords from the Bureau of Reclamation and La Paz county showed.\n\nThe Cibola valley irrigation and drainage district office in Cibola.\nPhotograph: Caitlin O\u2019Hara/The Guardian\n\nBefore the Bureau of Reclamation approved Greenstone\u2019s water transfer to Queen\nCreek, an investigation by the Arizona Republic found that Greenstone and its\ncompetitors had acquired thousands of acres of irrigable land across Arizona,\nincluding in La Paz, Pinal, Maricopa, Mohave and Yuma counties. The\nnewspaper\u2019s reports were cited by local officials who argued that Greenstone\u2019s\nwater transfer to Queen Creek would be a harbinger of many more such deals, as\nwater becomes increasingly scarce across the west.\n\nA Guardian review of deeds and other public records found that in Yuma county,\ncompanies associated with Greenstone hold about 5,300 acres of farmland, much\nof it within the Wellton-Mohawk irrigation and drainage district. Taxes on\nthose lands were paid by Sunstone Farms LLC, a Greenstone subsidiary that\nleases agricultural properties.\n\nThere, unlike in CVIDD, individual landowners cannot initiate water transfer\nagreements on their own. But because votes within Wellton-Mohawk are also\nweighted based on how much land someone owns, larger landowners could seek\nmore influence on its board. County records indicate that a Greenstone-\naffiliated LLC is one of the largest landowners in the district.\n\nMeanwhile to the north, in Mohave county, Greenstone\u2019s competitor Water Asset\nManagement holds more than 2,400 acres, and access to nearly 16,000 acre-feet\nof water, per public records from the county.\n\nIn 2022, La Paz along with Mohave and Yuma counties filed a lawsuit against\nthe Bureau of Reclamation, challenging its claim that the deal would cause \u201cno\nsignificant\u201d environmental impact.\n\n\u201cWe are arguing in our lawsuit that Reclamation did not analyze the precedent\nthat this transfer set,\u201d said John Lemaster, an attorney representing Mohave\ncounty. \u201cThe entire purpose of Greenstone is to develop and sell water\nresources. We know future transfers are likely.\u201d\n\nThis year, a federal judge in Arizona sided with them, ruling that the Bureau\nof Reclamation\u2019s environmental evaluation was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and\nordering the agency to prepare a more thorough assessment. While it\u2019s unclear\nhow the agency will proceed, given that water is already flowing to Queen\nCreek, the outcome could define how future deals are made and who can lay\nclaim to the Colorado River\u2019s water.\n\nGreenstone, meanwhile, has tried to play down the significance of the\ntransfer.\n\nColorado River has lost 10tn gallons of water since 2000 due to climate crisis\n\nRead more\n\nAt a March 2022 committee hearing to discuss a bill introduced by Cobb, the\nformer state representative who tried to limit water transfers, Malano balked\nat descriptions of his company as a hedge fund, describing Greenstone as \u201cone\nof the largest farming operations in the state of Arizona\u201d.\n\nIndeed, Greenstone and its competitors, such as Water Asset Management, often\nlease their land to farmers. But Greenstone\u2019s ultimate goal, per its website,\n\u201cis to advance water transactions\u201d. And it has been busy doing so. In 2017, it\nhelped secure the right to Rio Grande water for a Facebook data center in Los\nLunas, New Mexico. While the Queen Creek deal was the company\u2019s first sale off\nthe Colorado River, it has also brokered a number of deals to supply\ngroundwater to developing communities across Arizona.\n\nIn September, the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general filed an amicus brief in\nsupport of the counties challenging the transfer. \u201cFuture transfers will be\nlikely, if not inevitable,\u201d Kris Mayes wrote, \u201cgiven the need for water across\nArizona.\u201d\n\n## A building boom strains a dwindling resource\n\nQueen Creek is growing fast.\n\nWide, tree-lined boulevards vine off into neat, master-planned communities\nnamed Harvest and Encanterra, featuring resort pools, lush golf courses and\nornamental lakes. Beyond the sand-hued estates, which blend into the Sonoran\nlandscapes, there is construction. Cranes clear ground, crews build wood\nframes through suburban cul-de-sacs in various states of completion.\n\nQueen Creek was the seventh-fastest growing city in the US, according to a\nCensus Bureau report released last year. It, like many Arizona suburbs, has\nstruggled to balance a development boom with a shrinking water supply.\n\nLast year, the state moved to limit new housing construction in the suburbs of\nPhoenix \u2013 one of the fastest-growing metro areas in the country \u2013 to avoid\nemptying region\u2019s underground aquifers. Projecting a 4.86m acre-foot shortfall\nin groundwater supplies over the next century, the state announced that all\nfuture housing developments in the desert would have to find some other source\nof water, by purchasing or importing their supply.\n\nNew home construction at a housing development in Queen Creek last year. A\nwater manager said the town had spent years working to secure water.\nPhotograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nAmbitious cities and developers have been left scrambling.\n\nThe suburb of Buckeye, west of Phoenix, has considered building a desalination\nplant in the Mexican town of Puerto Pe\u00f1asco and piping the treated water\nseveral hundred miles north to Arizona.\n\nQueen Creek\u2019s water manager Paul Gardner said the town had been working for\nyears to secure water for its future. In addition to piping water from the\nColorado River, the city has also sought to import groundwater from the\nHarquahala valley, to the east of Cibola. It recently signed a $30m deal with\nHarquahala Valley Landowners LLC, a company that represents farmers and\ninvestors with water rights, to syphon off 5,000 acre-feet of ground water a\nyear to feed its maze of gated communities and sprawling subdivisions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Cibola, Holly Irwin dreams of development too \u2013 though of a\ndifferent sort.\n\nOn the east bank of the Colorado, she recently oversaw the cleanup and\nrestoration of a stretch of open space for residents and visitors. \u201cNow we\nhave trash cans, we have picnic tables,\u201d Irwin said. \u201cMy goal is we\u2019ll have\ncampsites that stretch all the way down. And more electrical hookups for RVs.\u201d\n\nIn the summertime, she hopes, the river will be filled with boats and its\nshore with picnickers and campers. \u201cWe could attract more people, from all\nover.\u201d\n\nStewart, the shop owner, first came here as a \u201cweekender\u201d from San Diego,\nCalifornia. She was drawn to the region\u2019s rugged beauty and rural familiarity.\n\u201cThis was a place to roam, to be with family.\u201d\n\nIn the decade since she and her family moved here, she has also seen the\nColorado shrink, and its lush banks fade. \u201cThere\u2019s been years when you could\nbasically walk across the river,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is what has scared a lot of\npeople. We need the water here.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Colorado river crisis\n  * Arizona\n  * Climate crisis in the American west\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
