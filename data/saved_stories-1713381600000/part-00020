At a little before 8 in the\nmorning I had flour, oil, and eggs but no milk. I knocked on the door of my\nneighbor - who I'd seen only twice before and luckily she was home and let me\nborrow some milk. Like the good ol' days, huh?\n\nOne problem was averted yet another arose. These \"muffins\" I was making\nactually had to be good, not the barely eatable non-sense I usually made.\nHaving no other game plan I threw something together, prayed, and dished out\nmy questionable muffins to my guest. What a bad host I am! That day, I thought\nreally hard... so what exactly are baked goods? We say \"pie crust, muffin,\ncupcake, coffee cake, puff pastry, and croissant\", but do we know what they\nactually mean?\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPer Se (New York, New York)\n\nMichael Ohene's Cookie Recipe Generator\n\nCoi (San Francisco, California)\n\nBaguettes Deconstructed\n\nAdditives\n\nI used to dismiss baking as making goo or sugar covered pillow-like bread, but\nthis is not entirely true. Yes, the essence of baking can be hidden behind all\nthe goo, but this is obscenity encroaching on the fine art of baked goods and\nunfortunately unless one is a connoisseur the fundamental distinctions are not\nnoted very well. So I spent some time - a really long time - baking, serving,\nand eating cakes, cookies, coffee cakes, etc. trying to figure out what\nfundamentally defines baked goods. I finally came up with an answer which was\nnaturally due to my initial false assumptions and failures. I tried using a\nnumerical range, but after following this method and getting unsatisfactory\nresults I knew there was still room for culinary error, something that was\nunacceptable. I envisioned having a few criteria one could follow and from\nthere spontaneously throw in random ingredients like a flux capacitor to get a\nsatisfactory batter or dough for a baked good.\n\nAfter pouring through countless recipes I finally created a procedure to\naccurately characterize baked goods, in it, we must employ three calculated\nvalues. These values are the moistness value, butter(oil) content, and the egg\ncontent; all obtained from a recipe. Of course, a recipe provides a list of\ningredients and measurements, which includes instructions for combining the\ningredients. Each ingredient can be considered either a wet or a dry\ningredient. In the following procedure, most wet ingredients are given\nconstant values (see Table1.), while flavorings, leavenings (baking powder,\nbaking soda, yeast, etc.), seasonings (e.g. salt), and food pieces (shredded\ncoconut, walnut pieces, blueberries, etc.) are omitted. The constant values\nare multiplied by their respective quantities (in cups) yielding a product.\nThe products are summed and finally divided by the dry ingredient product\n(obtained from Table 2.) to yield a solution called the moistness value.\n\nI know... \"How can you possibly use volume (cups)?\" Either volume or mass can\nbe used assuming standard mass/volume conversions, but I found using volume\ngreatly simplifies the calculations.\n\nBut what is this beast of a procedure? Does it design baked goods? Does it\nanalyze baked goods? After years of reinventing itself, the procedure has\nsettled in the role of a design tool which aides in creating new recipes, an\nanalysis tool for reviewing recipes with no need for baking, and a\ncharacterization tool which attempts to define all possible baked goods.\nImmense, yet its most useful role is likely in allowing one to substitute\ningredients.\n\nWet Ingredient| Value/cup  \n---|---  \nbanana (mashed)| 0.375  \nbutter, oil, shortening| 0.5  \nbuttermilk| 1  \ncream cheese| 0.35  \ncooked (sweet) potatoes| 0.5  \ncranberries mashed/pulsed with sugar| 0.2  \ngrated carrots| 1/3  \njumbo eggs| 1/4  \nextra-large eggs| 1/5  \nlarge eggs| 1/6  \nlarge egg yolk| 1/8  \nlarge egg white| 1/24  \nhoney, milk, molasses, orange juice, water| 1  \nsour cream, yogurt, whipping, heavy cream| 0.7  \napplesauce| 0.6  \n  \nTable 1. Values for some common wet ingredients\n\nDry Ingredient| Value/cup  \n---|---  \nalmond paste| 1  \nfinely ground pecans, walnuts, almonds| 1/3  \nflour (cocoa powder, whole wheat, all-purpose, etc.)| 1  \nold fashioned rolled oats| 0.5  \nmelted chocolate (non-dark)| 0.5  \npeanut butter| 2/3  \n  \nTable 2. Values for some common dry ingredients\n\nAll values in Table 1 and Table 2 are \"per cup\" except for eggs which is \"per\negg\". Let's look at an excerpt from an example recipe.\n\nQuantity| Ingredient| Wet| Dry  \n---|---|---|---  \n3 1/2 cups| all-purpose flour| -| 3.5  \n1 teaspoon| baking powder| -| -  \n1 teaspoon| baking soda| -| -  \n3/4 teaspoon| salt| -| -  \n16 tablespoons| butter| 0.5| -  \n2 cups| sugar| -| -  \n3| large eggs| 0.5| -  \n2 teaspoons| vanilla extract| -| -  \n2 cups| old-fashion rolled oats| -| 1  \n  \nTable 3. Sample mystery recipe\n\n(1)  \n---  \n  \n(2)  \n---  \n  \nIn equation (1), a, b, c, and d represent quantities for wet ingredients x_1\n(butter) and x_2 (eggs) and dry ingredients x_3 (flour) and x_4 (oats)\nrespectively. Equation (2) provides an accompanying practical calculation for\nequation (1).\n\nNote the following relations: 3 teaspoons = 1 tablespoon 16 tablespoons = 1\ncup\n\nThe resulting moistness value, butter content, and egg content are: 0.22,\n11.1%, 0.67E; (0.5/4.5) and (3/4.5) gave us the butter and egg content\nrespectively (see next section for an explanation of moistness, butter\ncontent, and egg content). These are our characterization numbers. You can\nsave time and just use this web application to get the same numbers. From\nusing Table 4 and our characterization numbers, we see this is some sort of a\ncookie.\n\n[Note from the editor, Michael Chu: Michael Ohene's Table 4 was too detailed\nto present in HTML here, so click on this image to load a PDF showing the\ncomplete table.]\n\nTable 4. Periodicity of Baked Goods in the USA\n\nExplanation of the chart (Table 4) Moistness - wet ingredient to dry\ningredient percentage^1 ^2.A higher moistness value corresponds to a more\nfluid/less stiff batter. Butter content - butter/oil/shortening to dry\ningredient ratio. On the chart the butter content values are divided into\n\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\", and \"very high\" to make the chart more intuitive. Egg\ncontent - number of eggs to dry ingredient ratio.\n\nTable 4 was formed by plotting hundreds of recipes. Anything falling within a\ngrid is what that grid is labeled (e.g. scone). Some grids are empty because\nit would not make sense for them to exist. For example, a very moist bread\n(0.60) with a low butter content would be airy and tasteless.\n\nResults and interesting facts Unlike most other baked goods cakes have an\nextra criterion, when buttermilk is replaced by a constant value of 1.75, a\ncake must equal a value between 1 - 1.25. This requirement is due to the acid\ncontent in buttermilk.\n\nAlso notice that having one or more eggs per a cup of dry ingredients results\nin a cakey baked good. Therefore if you are experimenting with chocolate chip\nrecipes and use a cup of flour, you must discard some of the egg you plan to\nuse.\n\nA moistness value of 0.35 - 0.47 usually results in a yeast dough. A moistness\nvalue above 0.50 cannot be kneaded.\n\nThe baked goods (brownies, cookies, cakes, etc.) that kids like are on the\nouter edges of Table 4.\n\nCan you find a recipe that defies the logic (is outside the groupings) of this\nchart? Sometimes, but it most likely received bad reviews.\n\nFinal notes: Mixing instructions, directions on how to combine ingredients,\nare usually shared for similar types of baked goods. For example, you always\nuse cold water for pie crust recipes.\n\nLeavening (baking soda and baking powder): used to make a dough or batter rise\nwhen baked. Table 5 below shows common leavening ratios. What is a leavening\nratio? Comparing teaspoons of leavening to cups of dry ingredients is a good\nrule of thumb. For example, in Table 3 the leavening ratio was 0.44 for our\ncookie. Also, if you use an acid (e.g. buttermilk, vinegar), baking soda must\nbe included.\n\nBaked Good| Leavening Ratio  \n---|---  \nshortbread cookie| 0 - 0.15  \ncookie| 0.15 - 0.5  \npound cake| 0 - 0.8  \nmuffin| 0.8 - 1.66  \ncake| 0.8 - 1.66  \nbiscuit| 1 - 2.5  \n  \nTable 5. Leavening ratios\n\nHave fun!\n\nFootnotes ^1When a glaze is used - usually for pound cakes - the moistness\nvalue increases by 0.05. For example a moistness value of 0.66 will become\n0.71 if a glaze is used.^^ ^2This assumes standard/normal baking temperature\nand pressure/altitude.^^\n\nUpdate (July 31, 2010): Added a link to Michael Ohene's web-based recipe\ncharacterization numbers calculator.\n\nMichael Ohene is an electrical engineer by profession with an interest in the\nmodeling and classification of artistic disciplines including: baking, knot\ntying, and floral design. At the heart of his research at\nwww.whatsthesequency.com he demonstrates the ability to transform random logic\ninto more accessible visual logic.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPer Se (New York, New York)\n\nMichael Ohene's Cookie Recipe Generator\n\nCoi (San Francisco, California)\n\nBaguettes Deconstructed\n\nAdditives\n\nNext \u00bb\n\n\u00ab Prev\n\nWritten by Michael Ohene\n\nPublished on July 12, 2010 at 09:00 PM\n\n19 comments on Analyzing a Baking Recipe:(Post a comment)\n\nOn July 13, 2010 at 02:04 PM, Steve C (guest) said...\n\nSubject: Sweet Potato\n\nThis is good information for the next time I attempt a sweet potato gnocchi.\n\nOn July 13, 2010 at 09:01 PM, an anonymous reader said...\n\nSubject: Ratios\n\nSomething tells me you would very much enjoy the book Ratio: The Simple Codes\nBehind the Craft of Everyday Cooking\n\nEric Means\n\nOn July 15, 2010 at 11:19 AM, an anonymous reader said...\n\nbrilliant.\n\nOn July 16, 2010 at 05:35 PM, an anonymous reader said...\n\nSubject: Brilliant!\n\nFor the past year I've often considered deleting Cooking for Engineers from my\nRSS feed, as updates are few and far between these days, but always ended up\ndeciding to keep it around for whatever reason.
