While drawing historical or mythical figures, for instance, he\nwould wait until the \u201cspirit\u201d appeared in his mind\u2019s eye. The visions were\napparently so detailed that Blake could sketch as if a real person were\nsitting before him.\n\nLike human models, these imaginary figures could sometimes act\ntemperamentally. According to Blake biographer John Higgs, the artist could\nbecome frustrated when the object of his inner gaze casually changed posture\nor left the scene entirely. \u201cI can\u2019t go on, it is gone! I must wait till it\nreturns,\u201d Blake would declaim.\n\nSuch intense and detailed imaginations are thought to reflect a condition\nknown as hyperphantasia, and it may not be nearly as rare as we once thought,\nwith as many as one in 30 people reporting incredibly vivid mind\u2019s eyes.\n\nJust consider the experiences of Mats Holm, a Norwegian hyperphantasic living\nin Stockholm. \u201cI can essentially zoom out and see the entire city around me,\nand I can fly around inside that map of it,\u201d Holm tells me. \u201cI have a second\nspace in my mind where I can create any location.\u201d\n\nThis once neglected form of neurodiversity is now a topic of scientific study,\nwhich could lead to insights into everything from creative inspiration to\nmental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis.\n\n> Theirs is a very different experience from most. It\u2019s extremely immersive,\n> and their imagery affects them emotionally\n\nReshanne Reeder, Liverpool University\n\nFrancis Galton \u2013 better known as a racist and the \u201cfather of eugenics\u201d \u2013 was\nthe first scientist to recognise the enormous variation in people\u2019s visual\nimagery. In 1880, he asked participants to rate the \u201cillumination, definition\nand colouring of your breakfast table as you sat down to it this morning\u201d.\nSome people reported being completely unable to produce an image in the mind\u2019s\neye, while others \u2013 including his cousin Charles Darwin \u2013 could picture it\nextraordinarily clearly.\n\n\u201cSome objects quite defined. A slice of cold beef, some grapes and a pear, the\nstate of my plate when I had finished and a few other objects are as distinct\nas if I had photos before me,\u201d Darwin wrote to Galton.\n\nUnfortunately, Galton\u2019s findings failed to fire the imagination of scientists\nat the time. \u201cThe psychology of visual imagery was a very big topic, but the\nexistence of people at the extremes somehow disappeared from view,\u201d says Prof\nAdam Zeman at Exeter University. It would take more than a century for\npsychologists such as Zeman to take up where Galton left off.\n\nWilliam Blake\u2019s depiction of Minos for Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. The artist saw\nthe models for his work as if they were in the room with him. Photograph:\nAlamy\n\nEven then, much of the initial research focused on the poorer end of the\nspectrum \u2013 people with aphantasia, who claim to lack a mind\u2019s eye. Within the\npast five years, however, interest in hyperphantasia has started to grow, and\nit is now a thriving area of research.\n\nTo identify where people lie on the spectrum, researchers often use the\nVividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), which asks participants to\nvisualise a series of 16 scenarios, such as \u201cthe sun rising above the horizon\ninto a hazy sky\u201d and then report on the level of detail that they \u201csee\u201d in a\nfive-point scale. You can try it for yourself. When you picture that sunrise,\nwhich of the following statements best describes your experience?\n\n1\\. No image at all, you only \u201cknow\u201d that you are thinking of the object 2.\nVague and dim 3. Moderately clear and lively 4. Clear and reasonably vivid 5.\nPerfectly clear and as vivid as real seeing\n\nThe final score is the sum of all 16 responses, with a maximum of 80 points.\nIn large surveys, most people score around 55 to 60. Around 1% score just 16;\nthey are considered to have extreme aphantasia; 3%, meanwhile, achieve a\nperfect score of 80, which is extreme hyperphantasia.\n\nThe VVIQ is a relatively blunt tool, but Reshanne Reeder, a lecturer at\nLiverpool University, has now conducted a series of in-depth interviews with\nhyperphantasic people \u2013 research that helps to delineate the peculiarities of\ntheir inner lives. \u201cAs you talk to them, you start to realise that this is a\nvery different experience from most people\u2019s experience,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s\nextremely immersive, and their imagery affects them very emotionally.\u201d\n\nSome people with hyperphantasia are able to merge their mental imagery with\ntheir view of the world around them. Reeder asked participants to hold out a\nhand and then imagine an apple sitting in their palm. Most people feel that\nthe scene in front of their eyes is distinct from that inside their heads.\n\u201cBut a lot of people with hyperphantasia \u2013 about 75% \u2013 can actually see an\napple in the hand in front of them. And they can even feel its weight.\u201d\n\nAs you might expect, these visual abilities can influence career choices.\n\u201cAphantasia does seem to bias people to work in sciences, maths or IT \u2013 those\nStem professions \u2013 whereas hyperphantasia nudges people to work in what are\ntraditionally called creative professions,\u201d says Zeman. \u201cThough there are many\nexceptions.\u201d\n\nFrancis Galton, a controversial figure, but the first scientist to recognise\nthe variability in people\u2019s powers of visualisation. Photograph: Granger \u2013\nHistorical Picture Archive/Alamy\n\nReeder recalls one participant who uses her hyperphantasia to fuel her\nwriting. \u201cShe said she doesn\u2019t even have to think about the stories that she\u2019s\nwriting, because she can see the characters right in front of her, acting out\ntheir parts,\u201d Reeder recalls.\n\nHyperphantasia can also affect people\u2019s consumption of art. Novels, for\nexample, become a cinematic experience. \u201cFor me, the story is like a film in\nmy mind,\u201d says Geraldine van Heemstra, an artist based in London. Holm offers\nthe same description. \u201cWhen I listen to an audiobook, I\u2019m running a movie in\nmy head.\u201d\n\nThis is not always an advantage. Laura Lewis Alvarado, a union worker who is\nalso based in London, describes her disappointment at watching The Golden\nCompass, the film adaptation of the first part of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark\nMaterials. \u201cI already had such a clear idea of how every character looked and\nacted,\u201d she says. The director\u2019s choices simply couldn\u2019t match up.\n\nZeman\u2019s research suggests that people with hyperphantasia enjoy especially\nrich autobiographical memories. This certainly rings true for Van Heemstra.\nWhen thinking of trips in the countryside, she can recall every step of her\nwalks, including seemingly inconsequential details. \u201cI can picture even little\nthings, like if I dropped something and picked it up,\u201d she says.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Observed\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best\nObserver writers\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Aphantasia is known to run\nin families, so it\u2019s reasonable to expect that hyperphantasia may be the same.\nLike many other psychological traits, our imaginative abilities probably come\nfrom a combination of nature and nurture, which will together shape the\nbrain\u2019s development from infancy to old age.\n\nZeman has taken the first steps to investigate the neurological differences\nthat underpin the striking variation in the mind\u2019s eye. Using fMRI to scan the\nbrains of people at rest, he has found that hyperphantasic people have greater\nconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in \u201chigher-\norder\u201d thinking such as planning and decision-making, and the areas\nresponsible for visual processing, which lie towards the back of the skull.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that if you say \u2018apple\u2019 to somebody with hyperphantasia, the\nlinguistic representation of \u2018apple\u2019 in the brain immediately transmits the\ninformation to the visual system,\u201d says Zeman. \u201cFor someone with aphantasia,\nthe word and concept of \u2018apple\u2019 operate independently of the visual system,\nbecause those connections are weaker.\u201d\n\nFurther research will no doubt reveal the nuances in this process. Detailed\nquestionnaires by Prof Liana Palermo at the Magna Graecia University in\nCatanzaro, Italy, for instance, suggest that there may be two subtypes of\nvivid imagery. The first is object hyperphantasia, which, as the name\nsuggests, involves the capacity to imagine items in extreme detail.\n\nThe second is spatial hyperphantasia, which involves an enhanced ability to\npicture the orientation of different items relative to one another and perform\nmental rotations. \u201cThey also report a heightened sense of direction,\u201d Palermo\nsays. This would seem to match Holm\u2019s descriptions of the detailed 3D\ncityscape that allows him to find a route between any two locations.\n\nBlake\u2019s Ghost of a Flea. Photograph: incamerastock/Alamy\n\nMany mysteries remain. A large survey by Prof Ilona Kov\u00e1cs, at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd\nUniversity in Hungary, suggests that hyperphantasia is far more common among\nchildren, and fades across adolescence and into adulthood. She suspects that\nthis may reflect differences in how the brain encodes information. In infancy,\nour brains store more sensory details, which are slowly replaced by more\nabstract ideas. \u201cThe child\u2019s memories offer a more concrete appreciation of\nthe world,\u201d she says \u2013 and it seems that only a small percentage of people can\nmaintain this into later life.\n\nReeder, meanwhile, is interested in studying the consequences of\nhyperphantasia for mental health. It is easy to imagine how vivid memories of\nupsetting events could worsen the symptoms of anxiety or post-traumatic stress\ndisorder, for example.\n\nReeder is also investigating the ways that people\u2019s mental imagery may\ninfluence the symptoms of illnesses such as schizophrenia. She suspects that,\nif someone is already at risk of psychosis, then hyperphantasia may lead them\nto experience vivid hallucinations, while aphantasia may increase the risk of\nnon-sensory delusions, such as fears of persecution.\n\nFor the moment, this remains an intriguing hypothesis, but Reeder has shown\nthat people with more vivid imagery in daily life are also more susceptible to\nseeing harmless \u201cpseudo-hallucinations\u201d in the laboratory. She asked\nparticipants to sit in a darkened room while watching a flickering light on a\nscreen \u2013 a set-up that gently stimulates the brain\u2019s visual system. After a\nfew minutes, many people will start to see simple illusions, such as geometric\nshapes. People with higher VVIQ scores, however, tended to see far more\ncomplex scenes \u2013 such as a stormy beach, a medieval castle or a volcano. \u201cIt\nwas quite psychedelic,\u201d says Lewis Alvarado, who took part in the experiment.\n\nReeder emphasises that the participants in her study were perfectly able to\nrecognise that these pseudo-hallucinations were figments of their imagination.\n\u201cIf someone never has reality discrimination issues, then I don\u2019t think\nthey\u2019re going to be more prone to psychosis.\u201d For those with mental illness,\nhowever, a better understanding of the mind\u2019s eye could offer insights into\nthe patient\u2019s experiences.\n\nFor now, Reeder hopes that greater awareness of hyperphantasia will help\npeople to make the most of their abilities. \u201cIt\u2019s a skill that could be\ntapped,\u201d she suggests.\n\nMany of the people I have interviewed are certainly grateful to know a little\nmore about the mind\u2019s eye and the way theirs differs from the average\nperson\u2019s.\n\nLewis Alvarado, for instance, only came across the term when she was listening\nto a podcast about William Blake, which eventually led her to contact Reeder.\n\u201cFor the first month or so I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot something I talk about loads, but I think it has helped me to realise why\nI experience things more intensely, which is comforting.\u201d\n\n  * David Robson is the author of The Laws of Connection: 13 Social Strategies That Will Transform Your Life, published by Canongate on 6 June (\u00a318.99).
