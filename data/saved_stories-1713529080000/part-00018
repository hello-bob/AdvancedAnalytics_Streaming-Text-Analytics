However, it is 14A that will be the make-or-break node for Intel\nFoundry. Winning customers starts with process technology, and Intel is\nbetting big here, but they need a generation where everyone gets comfortable.\nCustomers will use 18A to dip their toes in the Intel waters with less\ncritical chips that are not core to their business; if all goes well, they\nwill look to 14A as the main process for their linchpin designs \u2013 think the\nlargest, expensive dies like AI accelerators, CPUS, and potentially even\nmobile in 2027.\n\nSource: Intel\n\nIntel will need to win their business to make its IDM 2.0 foundry strategy\nwork, or else they will not have enough scale and volume to compete given\ntheir internal product business will continue to lose market share for the\nnext few years. It simply isn\u2019t possible to run a leading-edge foundry without\nmultiple large, leading-edge customers.\n\n#### Is Intel Back? Foundry & Product Resurgence Measured\n\nDylan Patel, Myron Xie, and 3 others\n\n\u00b7\n\nApr 2\n\nRead full story\n\nIntel will be the first, by a margin of years, to adopt ASML\u2019s high-NA EUV\nlithography scanners in high volume manufacturing. Both TSMC and Samsung have\nonly ordered tools for R&D. Intel, perhaps trying to correct for being late to\nthe low-NA game, has been high-NA\u2019s loudest and strongest champion. With the\nfirst customer-owned example now being installed in their Hillsboro fab, Intel\nwill have a head start on R&D and real-world experience with high-NA scanners.\n\nBut there is the question of economics. Our model shows that high-NA single\nexposure is more expensive than low-NA double patterning.\n\nAnd other chipmakers have publicly signaled that high-NA is too expensive\nthrough both their low orders and with public commentary:\n\n> Technology itself is of no value. Only what can serve your customer. So we\n> always work with our customers to give them the best transistor technology\n> and the best power-efficient technology and at a reasonable cost, okay? And\n> more importantly, the technology maturity that -- in the high-volume\n> production, that's all important. Everything. Everything counted together.\n> So we -- every time we know that there are some new structure, new tools\n> such as high-NA EUV, we look at it carefully, look at the maturity of the\n> tools, look at the cost of the tools and look at the schedule of that -- how\n> to achieve it. We always make the right decision at the right moment to\n> serve our customer.\n>\n> C.C. Wei, TSMC Vice Chairman & CEO\n\nWhy, then, would Intel Foundry bet its future on high-NA if it is more\nexpensive? At SPIE Lithography and Advanced Patterning, and now more recently\nwith Intel\u2019s new announcement, we finally heard the answer: directed-self\nassembly (DSA), Intel\u2019s magic bullet that dramatically lowers lithography\ncosts.\n\nSource: Intel\n\nBelow we\u2019ll discuss what DSA is, how it could potentially make high-NA\neconomical, go through the technical details of how DSA works, and the risks\ninvolved with adopting this new technology. We\u2019ll also show an updated cost\nmodel including high-NA + DSA, talk through the potential applications beyond\ncritical layers on leading-edge logic, and finish with the implications for\nthe companies involved \u2013 Intel, TSMC, the single source DSA materials supplier\nwho could benefit, ASML future outlook with tool orders which is quite non-\nconsensus from the drama of yesterday\u2019s earnings, and more on 14A challenges.\n\n##\n\nWhy Directed Self Assembly Is Needed: Breaking the Dose vs. CD Tradeoff\n\nThe main challenge driving high cost on high-NA is the critical dimension (CD)\nvs. dose curve and its flow-through to throughput and cost per wafer. Critical\ndimension is the width of the smallest line or space that can be imaged by a\nlithography scanner. Achieving good image quality at lower CDs requires\nexponentially higher doses. Because of limited light source power, delivering\nhigher doses means the scanner must run more slowly, waiting for enough\nphotons to reach each exposure field. Running slowly means fewer wafers\nproduced by the scanner, which translates to a big cost increase when using a\ntool depreciating by more than $150,000 per day. For a more detailed\ndiscussion, see our piece on high-NA cost.\n\n#### ASML Dilemma: High-NA EUV is Worse vs Low-NA EUV Multi-Patterning\n\nDylan Patel, Jeff Koch, and Lithos Graphein\n\n\u00b7\n\nDecember 11, 2023\n\nRead full story\n\nLower exposure doses allow the scanner to run at or close to its maximum,\nstage-limited throughput. While normally the image quality would be\nunacceptably poor, with directed self assembly it can be rectified. Directed\nSelf Assembly (DSA) is a nanopatterning technique that utilizes the self-\norganizing properties of block copolymers, guided by pre-patterned templates.\nIn simple terms, it can repair the feature, dramatically reducing the dose\nrequired and actually improving the final pattern quality.\n\n##\n\nHow Directed Self Assembly (DSA) Works\n\nThe mechanism of DSA is there in the name: a chemical that is \u201cself-\nassembling\u201d and does so in the location where it is \u201cdirected.\u201d\n\nDSA integration flow, Source: (Han, E. et al. \"DSA materials and processes\ndevelopment for \u2264 P24 EUV resist L/S pattern rectification,\" Proc. SPIE 12956\n(2024))\n\n\u201cSelf-assembly,\u201d despite the complex chemistry behind it, is an intuitive\nconcept \u2013 components that start off randomly arranged organize into a useful\nstructure when energy is added to the system. Imagine (this is slightly\nhyperbolic) a Lego set that builds itself when you bake it in an oven.\n\nSelf-assembly of a block copolymer: the blocks organize themselves when\nheated, Source: (Gornev, E et al. \"Cellular automata method for directed self-\nassembly modeling,\" Proc. SPIE 11022 (2019))\n\nChemically, this behavior is achieved with a block co-polymer (BCP). Two\npolymers, only a handful to dozen nanometers long, are linked by a covalent\nbond to form the BCP. The current state-of-the-art polymer used is\npolystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate), abbreviated as PS-b-PMMA.\n\nThe two polymers, PS and PMMA, do not mix well. Just like oil and water, PS is\na nonpolar molecule while PMMA is polar \u2013 they naturally will separate into\nlayers, as that\u2019s the lowest energy arrangement. PS-b-PMMA, naturally wants to\narrange into a regular, orderly pattern of layers. Adding energy in the form\nof heat allows the molecules to more quickly find this equilibrium\narrangement.\n\nIn practice, this means coating a wafer with PS-b-PMMA and baking it for less\nthan an hour results in a regular pattern of PS and PMMA alternating lines,\neach ~20nm wide. If that sounds like a good starting point for producing\nultra-thin metal wires to connect billions of transistors together (an M0\nlayer in leading-edge logic)... you\u2019d be correct.\n\nBut this method of self-assembly alone is pretty useless, since the placement\nand orientation of the lines is more or less random. It needs to be guided,\nand that\u2019s where lithography comes in.\n\nSingle EUV exposure vs. resist rectification with EUV + DSA. The lower middle\nimage shows self-assembly without a guide pattern: looks neat, but not useful\nfor integrated circuits, Source: (Han, E. et al. \"DSA materials and processes\ndevelopment for \u2264 P24 EUV resist L/S pattern rectification,\" Proc. SPIE 12956\n(2024))\n\nAn EUV exposure is used to produce the guide pattern: this defines the\norientation and position of the self-assembly. The process is very similar to\na normal EUV lithography flow, except the pattern is transferred from\nphotoresist to a special underlayer customized for DSA. This underlayer has a\nchemical affinity for only one of the block copolymers. With this patterned\nunderlayer, during the bake the copolymers will not only align relative to\neach other but also relative to the underlayer \u2013 so the line placement is\nexactly where desired.\n\nChemical \u201cmagic\u201d of DSA: block copolymer self-assembles in lines, aligned with\na guide pattern underneath, Source: (Han, E. et al. \"DSA materials and\nprocesses development for \u2264 P24 EUV resist L/S pattern rectification,\" Proc.\nSPIE 12956 (2024)) & SemiAnalysis\n\nThe critical dimension of these lines is defined by the length of each polymer\nchain. This means the BCP can be customized to print features as small (or\nlarge) as the polymer chains can be produced. EMD, the leading manufacturer of\nDSA chemicals in this application, has shown a 9nm CD with the possibility to\ngo smaller. This is good enough to compliment high-NA EUV.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the key detail for the EUV-produced guide pattern: it can be\nproduced with much lower doses. The DSA molecules self-assemble into lines\nwith very low line edge roughness (LER), regardless of the LER of the guide\npattern. They will align with the average of the guide pattern. As long as the\nguide pattern is placed accurately (which it can be, EUV overlay is very\ngood), the LER of the EUV exposure can be poor \u2013 DSA can heal it. Relaxing\nimage quality requirements for the EUV exposure means the dose can be reduced\nby 50% or more.\n\nHealing with DSA vastly improves low-dose EUV image quality flow, Source:\n(Han, E. et al. \"DSA materials and processes development for \u2264 P24 EUV resist\nL/S pattern rectification,\" Proc. SPIE 12956 (2024))\n\nWe use the 50% number for dose reduction as a reasonable assumption based on\nexisting, replicated work. Early R&D work from Intel using a \u201cnovel\nunderlayer\u201d that can be patterned directly with EUV exposure, rather than by\npattern transfer from photoresist, shows 25 mJ/cm^2 dose is viable \u2013 a 3-4x\nreduction. If this is what can be brought to production, then the cost savings\nare much higher than even what we model below conservatively.\n\nEUV doses of just 25 mJ/cm^2 can be achieved with a patternable underlayer +\nDSA, Source: (Han, E. et al. \"DSA materials and processes development for \u2264\nP24 EUV resist L/S pattern rectification,\" Proc. SPIE 12956 (2024))\n\nThe final piece of the patterning puzzle is a dry etch: PS-b-PMMA can be\nselectively etched so just the polar molecule (PMMA) is removed. PS becomes\nthe line, PMMA leaves the space \u2013 it ends up acting more or less the same as\ndeveloped photoresist, so the typical post-develop integration flows (pattern\ntransfer to hardmask, SOC, substrate, etc.) can be used.\n\nUltimately the experimental results speak for themselves. Intel showed\nexceptional yield results for a self-aligned EUV litho-etch-litho-etch scheme\nwhen using DSA to rectify the pattern:\n\nSubstantial yield improvement on low pitch metal & via layers by using DSA,\nSource: Intel\n\n##\n\nWhat\u2019s the Catch? (Risks)\n\nSo far this is a near-perfect story for DSA. Given the product described\nabove, every chipmaker would be using it for every EUV layer. But at the\nmoment they are not. It\u2019s been stuck in research for well over a decade.
