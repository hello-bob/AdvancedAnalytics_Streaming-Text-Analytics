That filling? The data is weak\n\n## Getting evidence-based care may be like pulling teeth, researchers suggest.\n\nBeth Mole - 5/7/2024, 5:56 PM\n\nEnlarge\n\nGetty | Julian Stratenschulte\n\n#### reader comments\n\n128\n\nThe field of dentistry is lagging on adopting evidence-based care and, as\nsuch, is rife with overdiagnoses and overtreatments that may align more with\nthe economic pressures of keeping a dental practice afloat than what care\npatients actually need. At least, that's according to a trio of health and\ndental researchers from Brazil and the United Kingdom, led by epidemiologist\nand dentist Paulo Nadanovsky, of the University of the State of Rio de\nJaneiro.\n\nIn a viewpoint published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, the researchers\npoint out that many common\u2014nearly unquestioned\u2014practices in dentistry aren't\nbacked up by solid data. That includes the typical recommendation that\neveryone should get a dental check-up every six months. The researchers note\nthat two large clinical trials failed to find a benefit of six-month check-ups\ncompared with longer intervals that were up to two years.\n\nA 2020 Cochrane review that assessed the two clinical trials concluded that\n\"whether adults see their dentist for a check\u2010up every six months or at\npersonalized intervals based on their dentist's assessment of their risk of\ndental disease does not affect tooth decay, gum disease, or quality of life.\nLonger intervals (up to 24 months) between check\u2010ups may not negatively affect\nthese outcomes.\" The Cochrane reviewers reported that they were \"confident\" of\nlittle to no difference between six-month and risk-based check-ups and were\n\"moderately confident\" that going up to 24-month checkups would make little to\nno difference either.\n\nLikewise, Nadanovsky and his colleagues highlight that there is no evidence\nsupporting the benefit of common scaling and polishing treatments for adults\nwithout periodontitis. And for children, cavities in baby teeth are routinely\nfilled, despite evidence from a randomized controlled trial that rates of pain\nand infections are similar\u2014about 40 percent\u2014whether the cavities are filled or\nnot.\n\nAs for the disconnect between common practices and the state of the evidence,\nthe researchers suggest that economic pressures are largely to blame, as well\nas the training and opinions of practicing dentists and the expectations of\npatients\u2014\"all of which tend to favor excessive diagnoses and interventions,\"\nthe researchers write. The problem may date back to the 1970s and 1980s when\nfluoridated toothpaste became common, and the rate of cavities saw an\n\"extraordinary decline.\" That left dentists with a financial need to find new\nways to keep their offices filled, even if teeth didn't need to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this created two problems: People being overtreated or not treated at all,\nthe researchers wrote.\n\n> The prevailing dental economic model based on fee-for-service creates an\n> environment of dental overdiagnosis and overtreatment. At the same time,\n> many persons who do not have dental insurance cannot afford to pay out of\n> pocket for dental care, creating a situation where people with low income or\n> who are part of a racial and ethnic minority group are often underdiagnosed\n> and undertreated.\n\nThe researchers called for more clinical trials to assess the effectiveness\nand benefits of treatments and to have dental guidelines updated accordingly.\nThen, Nadanovsky and colleagues said, resources can be allocated to the\npatients who need them the most. \"The aim is to reduce overdiagnosis and\novertreatment while increasing necessary treatment,\" they conclude.\n\nIn a lengthy statement to Ars, the American Dental Association responded to\nthe viewpoint by saying that it is \"dedicated to evidence-based dentistry.\"\nThe ADA defined evidence-based dentistry as that which \"integrates the\ndentist\u2019s clinical expertise, the patient\u2019s needs and preferences, and the\nmost current, clinically relevant data. All three are part of the decision-\nmaking process for patient care.\"\n\nThe ADA did not respond directly to questions regarding the shaky evidence\nbehind common practices and recommendations, such as six-month check-ups. (The\nADA does not recommend a specific interval between visits but recommends\nseeing a dentist \"regularly.\") Instead, the ADA emphasized that the \"dentist-\npatient relationship is critically important.\" While noting the \"ethical\nresponsibility of dentists,\" the ADA focused on the role of patients in their\ncare. According to the ADA, patients should be selective in finding a dentist,\nreceive dental care cost estimates upfront, and always ask questions and\ndiscuss alternatives. The association also referenced its statement on dental\npatient rights and responsibilities.\n\n\"Patients always have the option to discuss alternative treatment plans,\ndecline care, or seek another opinion,\" the ADA told Ars.\n\n\"The nation\u2019s dentists have long sought to turn the tide of untreated oral\ndisease and advise people to visit their dentist regularly for recommendations\nspecific to their individual needs developed in accordance with the latest\nscientific evidence available,\" the ADA said.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n128\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
