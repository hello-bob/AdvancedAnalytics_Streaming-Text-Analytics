This skepticism\n> arises from two observations: 1) smaller models can also exhibit high\n> performance on emergent abilities and 2) there is doubt on the discontinuous\n> metrics used to measure these abilities. In this paper, we propose to study\n> emergent abilities in the lens of pre-training loss, instead of model size\n> or training compute. We demonstrate that the models with the same pre-\n> training loss, but different model and data sizes, generate the same\n> performance on various downstream tasks. We also discover that a model\n> exhibits emergent abilities on certain tasks -- regardless of the continuity\n> of metrics -- when its pre-training loss falls below a specific threshold.\n> Before reaching this threshold, its performance remains at the level of\n> random guessing. This inspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those\n> that manifest in models with lower pre-training losses, highlighting that\n> these abilities cannot be predicted by merely extrapolating the performance\n> trends of models with higher pre-training losses.\n\nComments:| 18 pages, 6 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2403.15796 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2403.15796v2 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.15796arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Zhengxiao Du [view email] [v1] Sat, 23 Mar 2024 11:03:31 UTC (865 KB)\n[v2] Sat, 30 Mar 2024 09:55:12 UTC (354 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Understanding Emergent Abilities of Language\nModels from the Loss Perspective, by Zhengxiao Du and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2403\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
