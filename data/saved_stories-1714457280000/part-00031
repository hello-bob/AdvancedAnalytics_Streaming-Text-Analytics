(case no.\n30-2021-01226723-CU-BC-CJC). In this case, SFC is requesting that Vizio\nprovide source code to programs on some Vizio devices that are covered by the\nGNU General Public License v2 (GPL) and GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1\n(LGPL). In response, Vizio has argued that SFC cannot enforce a request for\nsource code if it does not hold copyright to the underlying software. In\nsupport of that argument, Vizio has made reference to an FAQ that is captioned\n\"Who has the power to enforce the GPL.\"\n\nVizio has now subpoenaed FSF to testify at a deposition in this case.\n\nFSF has always intended for the GNU licenses to promote the freedom to run,\ncopy, distribute, study, change, and improve software \u2014 which requires that\nsource code be shared with users.\n\nVizio's attempt to leverage an FSF FAQ to avoid being held accountable under\nthe GNU GPL is both malicious and ironic. Users should be free to enforce\ntheir right to source code under the GNU GPL licenses through any available\nlegal mechanism, without having to rely on a copyright holder to take action.\n\nIn that spirit, we have updated the above FAQ to read as follows:\n\n> Q: Who has the power to enforce the GPL?\n>\n> A: Since the GPL is a copyright license, it can be enforced by the copyright\n> holders of the software. If you see a violation of the GPL, you should\n> inform the developers of the GPL-covered software involved. They either are\n> the copyright holders, or are connected with the copyright holders.\n>\n> In addition, we encourage the use of any legal mechanism available to users\n> for obtaining complete and corresponding source code, as is their right, and\n> enforcing full compliance with the GNU GPL. After all, we developed the GNU\n> GPL to make software free for all its users.\n\nThe update better reflects the intention of the GNU GPL licenses.\n\nWe are preparing to deliver deposition testimony in response to Vizio's\nsubpoena. We will continue to closely monitor the case, and we support the SFC\nin their efforts. Needless to say, a court decision confirming users' standing\nto enforce their right to source code under the GNU GPL licenses would be a\ngreat help in ensuring software freedom.\n\nThe FSF invests much of our limited resources in activities that safeguard\nenforcement of the GNU GPL licenses, which includes extensive preparation for\nthis deposition with legal counsel. Please consider making a financial\ncontribution to enable us to continue doing this work. If you don't have the\nfinancial means, you can also contribute to the GNU Project, or help\ninvestigate possible GPL violations.\n\n##### Document Actions\n\n  * Share on social networks\n  * Syndicate:\n  * News\n  * Events\n  * Blogs\n  * Jobs\n  * GNU\n\n1PC9aZC4hNX2rmmrt7uHTfYAS3hRbph4UN\n\n##### Sign up\n\nNews\n\n    FSF to be deposed in SFC v Vizio, updates relevant FAQ entry Apr 29, 2024\n    Alyssa Rosenzweig, who spearheaded the reverse-engineering of Apple's GPU, to keynote LibrePlanet Mar 27, 2024\n    Hayley Tsukayama will speak about grassroots activism at LibrePlanet 2024 Jan 23, 2024\n    More news...\n\nRecent blogs\n\n    What role community plays in free software and more -- Interview with David Wilson\n    Meet the locals: Come to LibrePlanet and connect with free software supporters in New England\n    There are plenty of ways to socialize at LibrePlanet 2024: Cultivating Community\n    March GNU Spotlight with Amin Bandali: Sixteen new GNU releases!\n    Recent blogs - More...\n\nThe FSF is a charity with a worldwide mission to advance software freedom \u2014\nlearn about our history and work.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2004-2024 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
