These materials are sourced directly from nature, free from plastics and synthetic processes. Think of them as the purest choices for your health and the environment.\n\n  * Tier 2: Nature-Inspired Innovations Here, we explore materials that, while not entirely natural, are inspired by nature and brought to life through innovative science. At the end of the day, you\u2019re still met with plastic-free, minimally processed, non-toxic alternatives.\n\n  * Tier 3: Mindful Alternatives These options, like rayon or viscose, are mostly plastic-free, but be mindful \u2013 their production might involve some non-ideal chemicals.\n\n  * Tier 4: Avoidable (Synthetic) Materials & Fabrics The materials in this tier represent what we aim to move away from. Derived from petrochemicals and notorious for their environmental and health impacts, these are the materials we recommend avoiding to truly embrace a healthier, plastic-free lifestyle.\n\nRemember: This isn't about rigid rules, but about empowering you with helpful\ninformation. Use this glossary as your compass, make informed choices that\nalign with your priorities, and build a wardrobe and home that reflects your\nvalues and supports your health.\n\n## Tier 1: Natural Fabrics & Materials\n\nBelow, we highlight the materials and fabrics that embody the core principle\nof our commitment to a plastic-free world.\n\nThese fabrics and materials are sourced from nature, free from synthetic\nprocesses and plastics.\n\n### Cotton\n\nA soft, breathable, absorbent, and versatile natural fiber grown from the\nfluffy bolls of cotton plants.\n\nUses: Commonly used in clothing (shirts, t-shirts, hoodies, socks, underwear),\nbedding (sheets, towels, pillows, duvet covers), home textiles (curtains,\ntablecloths), and upholstery.\n\nGood to know: Conventional cotton is one of the world's dirtiest crops as\ncultivation heavily relies on pesticides, herbicides (glyphosate), and\nfertilizers, raising concerns about environmental pollution, soil health, and\npotential health risks for farmers and consumers. This is why some brands and\nconsumers push for \"100% organic cotton.\" Organic cotton skips the harsh\nchemicals, making it a more eco-friendly and healthier choice.\n\n#### Upcycled Cotton\n\nUpcycled cotton is derived from cotton fabric scraps and secondhand cotton\ngarments. It aims to reduce waste and the environmental footprint associated\nwith virgin cotton production, including water usage and the impact of\npesticides.\n\nUses: Commonly used in casual wear, home textiles, and as a filler material.\nIt is also gaining popularity in eco-conscious fashion lines for its\nsustainability profile.\n\nGood to know: The process of recycling cotton involves sorting, cleaning, and\nre-spinning cotton fibers into new yarns, which can significantly decrease the\ndemand for new cotton and the associated environmental burden. However, the\nrecycling process can sometimes involve mixing with other fibers to ensure\nstrength, and the extent of chemical processing can vary. Recycled cotton\nsupports the circular economy and reduces landfill waste, aligning with eco-\nfriendly and sustainable manufacturing practices.\n\n### Linen\n\nA strong and naturally crisp fabric woven from the fibers of flax plants,\nrenowned for its breathability, antibacterial properties, versatility, and\nbeautiful drape.\n\nUses: Popularly used in clothing (shirts, dresses, pants, suits), bedding\n(sheets, duvet covers), home textiles (curtains), and upholstery.\n\nGood to know: Linen\u2019s natural fibers allow air to circulate freely, reducing\nthe growth of bacteria and fungi.

Although linen can be cultivated without these inputs, not all producers adhere to these practices. The organic certification ensures that the linen is produced in a truly pesticide-free environment.\n\n  * Retting Process: The process of separating linen fibers from the woody stalk (retting) can involve chemicals like Alkali and Oxalic acid to speed up the process. Organic linen ensures that either no chemicals are used during retting or that any chemicals used are environmentally benign, preserving the integrity of the fabric and the environment.\n\n#### Bamboo Linen\n\nA natural fabric produced from the mechanical processing of bamboo stalks.\nIt's a more traditional method similar to how linen is made from flax. Bamboo\nlinen retains the inherent qualities of bamboo, such as breathability and\nmoisture-wicking properties, without the need for chemical intervention.\n\nUses: Ideal for clothing that requires a lightweight and airy feel, bamboo\nlinen is also used in bed linens, towels, and eco-friendly home textiles.\n\nGood to know: Unlike bamboo viscose, which is chemically processed, bamboo\nlinen is created through a mechanical method that is more environmentally\nfriendly and maintains the natural attributes of bamboo fibers. It is\nconsidered a more sustainable option due to its minimal processing, but it is\nless common, less soft (more coarse), and often more expensive than bamboo\nviscose.\n\n### Hemp\n\nA versatile and durable natural fiber derived from the long, tough stalks of\nthe Cannabis sativa plant. Hemp is known for its durability, sustainability,\nand moisture-wicking properties.\n\nUses: Commonly used in clothing (shirts, dresses, jeans, jackets), home\ntextiles (curtains, rugs, towels), bedding (sheets, duvet covers), paper\nproducts, construction materials, upholstery, cushions, and even furniture\nframes.\n\nGood to know: Hemp cultivation requires minimal pesticides and herbicides, and\nit returns 60-70% of the nutrients it takes from the soil. Hemp fabric also\noffers UV protection and has antimicrobial properties, making it a healthy\nchoice for skin.\n\n### Wool\n\nWool is a natural protein fiber obtained from the fleece of sheep and other\nanimals, including camelids (alpacas, camels, llamas), goats (such as cashmere\nand mohair goats), and rabbits (like angora). It's known for its durability,\ninsulation properties, and ability to absorb moisture without feeling wet.\n\nWool fibers are crimped, elastic, and can be spun into yarn or woven into\ntextiles. It's widely used in clothing, blankets, carpeting, and other\napplications where insulation and comfort are desired. Wool is also naturally\nflame-resistant, making it a great choice for mattresses.\n\nWool is classified based on microns \u2013 a measurement of the thickness of a wool\nfiber. A wool with a low micron is softer to the touch than a wool with a\nlarger micron. In perspective, the average human hair is around 50 microns,\nwhereas wool will generally range from 10-25 microns.\n\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of different kinds of wool.\n\n#### Merino\n\nA soft and fine wool fiber obtained from the fleeces of Merino sheep, renowned\nfor their gentle nature and adaptability to diverse climates.

These trees absorb more carbon dioxide\nthan they emit, making them valuable for the environment. Healthwise, cork's\ninherent properties make it suitable for people with allergies and sensitive\nskin. Its resistance to mold and mildew also adds to its appeal.\n\nWhen considering cork, look for certifications like FSC (Forest Stewardship\nCouncil) to ensure responsible harvesting practices.\n\n### Untreated Bamboo\n\nNatural bamboo in its raw, unprocessed state that boasts strong and durable\nfeatures with a natural aesthetic. Notably, unlike processed bamboo fabrics,\nuntreated bamboo utilizes the natural structure and properties of the bamboo\nitself. No chemical treatments or complicated processing is involved.\n\nUses: Commonly used in furniture (chairs, tables, shelves, sofas, etc.),\nutensils, flooring, and other household items.\n\n## Tier 2: Nature-Inspired Innovations\n\nPlastic-Free Alternatives\n\nWhile we often strive for \"natural\" and \"organic\" fabrics and materials, both\nhealthy and eco-conscious alternatives still exist. They are inspired by\nnature and brought to the market by science and innovation.\n\nWhile these materials might not be \"natural\" in the traditional sense, they're\nderived from renewable plant sources and avoid harmful plastics and other\npetroleum-based synthetics entirely.\n\nSure, some processing is still involved, but the end result? Bio-based,\nbiodegradable, plastic-free alternatives that are sustainable and relatively\nhealthy for humans.\n\n### Lyocell\n\nA regenerated cellulose fiber derived from wood pulp, often eucalyptus, beech\ntrees, or bamboo. This material possesses a soft, comfortable feel similar to\ncotton yet exhibits strength and durability, even when wet.\n\nUses: Commonly used in clothing (shirts, pants, dresses, underwear), bedding\n(sheets, towels, blankets), home textiles (curtains, tablecloths, etc.), and\nvarious industrial applications.\n\nGood to know: Unlike conventional viscose or rayon, the production of lyocell\nuses a closed-loop system that recycles most of the solvents, minimizing\nenvironmental impact and chemical exposure. Furthermore, compared to other\ncellulose-based fabrics, lyocell uses significantly fewer and less harmful\nchemicals during processing. For example, in most cases, the wood pulp is\ndissolved in a non-toxic organic solvent, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO),\nto create a solution. This solution is then extruded through fine openings to\nform filaments, which are solidified into fibers.\n\n#### TENCELTM\n\nA brand name under which Lenzing AG, an Austrian chemical & textiles company,\nmarkets its lyocell fibers. TENCELTM is well-known for its sustainable and\neco-friendly qualities. It is derived from sustainably sourced wood pulp,\noften from eucalyptus trees, and produced using a closed-loop process, where\nthe solvent used in the manufacturing is recycled, minimizing environmental\nimpact.\n\n### Natural Latex\n\nA biodegradable, elastic material sourced from the sap of the rubber tree\n(Hevea brasiliensis). It is processed through methods that maintain its\nnatural composition without synthetic additives or harsh chemicals.\n\nUses: Favored in products requiring flexibility and resilience, such as\nmattresses, furniture, pillows, and various apparel components like elastic\nwaistbands.\n\nGood to know: \"100% Natural Latex\" assures a product made solely from\nharvested rubber tree sap without synthetic materials. Using generally safe\nchemicals like sulfur and zinc oxide, the vulcanization process doesn't\nsynthetically alter the latex but stabilizes its inherent qualities.\n\n#### Latex Processing\n\nDifferent attributes can be enhanced depending on the manufacturing process.\n\nDunlop Latex Process: This method, used for about a century, involves pouring\nnatural rubber sap into a mold, adding minimal ingredients like Zinc, Sulfur,\nand soaps to form a gel-like substance. It's then baked, washed to remove\nimpurities, and baked again for drying. The result is a dense, durable foam.\nDunlop latex often meets the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS), requiring\nat least 95% organic content. Its straightforward production process, using\nminimal additives, aligns well with these standards.\n\nTalalay Latex Process: Developed in the 1940s for a less dense foam, the\nTalalay process starts similarly with pouring rubber sap into a mold. The mold\nis only partially filled, and synthetic materials like styrene-butadiene\nrubber and other chemicals are sometimes added. The mixture is then vacuum-\nsealed and flash-frozen with carbon dioxide before baking. This process\nresults in evenly distributed air pockets within the foam. However, most\nTalalay latex does not meet GOLS standards, and the exact chemical additives\nare often undisclosed, leading to potential concerns about human health. One\nexception is Vita Talalay, which achieves OEKO-TEX certification.\n\nFor Talalay latex products, especially mattresses, be aware that chemicals may\nbe introduced post-processing. Its lower density can require adhesives to bind\nsmaller pieces together, forming larger sheets. This practice can introduce\nadditional chemicals into the final product.\n\nOverall, while both Dunlop and Talalay processes start with natural rubber\nlatex, their production methods and the additives used vary significantly.\nDunlop latex generally offers a more health-conscious choice, meeting higher\norganic standards. In contrast, Talalay latex, with its potential use of\nsynthetic additives and post-processing chemicals, requires more careful\nconsideration.\n\n### Mycelium\n\nInnovative materials derived from the root structure of mushrooms (mycelium).\nThese fabrics are grown by feeding agricultural byproducts to mycelium cells,\nwhich then form a dense, interconnected network.\n\nUses: Emerging in the fashion industry, particularly for vegan leather\nalternatives in shoes, bags, and accessories. It's also being explored for use\nin packaging, construction, and even furniture due to its versatile and\ncustomizable properties.\n\nGood to know: While mycelium-based fabrics are highly innovative and\nsustainable, they require some degree of chemical treatment and human\nmanipulation to transform into a viable textile. However, these fabrics\nrequire minimal growth resources, produce zero waste, and are fully\nbiodegradable. The production process emits significantly fewer greenhouse\ngases than traditional leather or synthetic materials. They offer a promising\nsustainable alternative for a variety of applications, aligning with circular\neconomy principles.\n\n### Spider Silk\n\nTougher than Kevlar and stronger than steel, spider silk is a high-strength,\nversatile, and super unique protein fiber naturally produced by spiders. It\u2019s\nonly downfall? It\u2019s difficult to harvest and produce commercially. This\nlimitation has spurred scientists to look for alternative ways to harness the\nremarkable properties of spider silk, and has led to the creation of synthetic\nspider silk, created through bioengineering processes using yeast, bacteria,\nor other microorganisms.\n\nUses: While not widely available for commercial use yet, synthetic spider silk\nholds potential in a variety of applications due to its unique properties.\nIt's being explored for use in performance wear, medical sutures, and\nbulletproof clothing.\n\n### Cactus\n\nAn innovative material derived from the fibers of the nopal cactus, primarily\ncultivated in Mexico. This material is celebrated for its remarkable\nsimilarity to animal leather, offering comparable suppleness, durability, and\naesthetic appeal.\n\nUses: Initially popular in the footwear industry for shoes, sandals, and\nboots, cactus material is rapidly expanding into other areas, including\naccessories like bags, wallets, and belts. Its versatility and leather-like\nqualities also open doors to its use in various apparel applications and\nupholstery.\n\nGood to know: While cactus-based material is more sustainable than traditional\nleather and many synthetic alternatives, it does undergo some chemical\nprocessing. This process involves extracting and refining the cellulose fibers\nfrom the cactus, which may involve using certain chemicals to create the final\ntextile product.\n\n### Algae-based materials\n\nAlgae has recently emerged as a bio-based material that can replace both\nplastics and textiles without the use of chemicals.\n\nUses: Packaging materials, disposable items (like water bottles and cutlery),\nand even in the fashion industry for accessories and details in clothing.\n\nGood to know: The production of algae bioplastics and textiles is relatively\nlow-impact, as algae can grow in a variety of environments, including\nwastewater, and does not compete with food crops for land resources.\n\n### FutureFabrics\n\nAn umbrella term \u2013 coined by Unwrap \u2013 for a new generation of textiles created\nthrough advanced scientific methods and eco-friendly processes. These fabrics\nare derived from unique natural sources or by transforming existing natural\nfibers into more durable and versatile materials.\n\nUses: The applications for futurefabrics are diverse, ranging from high-\nfashion and everyday apparel to industrial uses and home textiles. These\nmaterials are often sought after for their unique properties, such as\nincreased strength, enhanced comfort, or special functionalities like water\nresistance or breathability.\n\nGood to know: Companies like Natural Fiber Welding, with their CLARUS\u00ae\ntechnology, and Modern Meadow, with their biofabricated materials, are at the\nforefront of this movement. These companies leverage scientific advancements\nto not only create new materials but also to enhance the properties of\nexisting natural fibers. The focus is on creating textiles that are not only\nenvironmentally sustainable but also meet the high demands of modern consumers\nin terms of quality and ethical production standards. FutureFabrics represent\na shift towards a more conscious and responsible approach to textile\nproduction, prioritizing both the planet's health and consumer needs.\n\n## Tier 3: Mindful Alternatives\n\nPlastic-Free, Semi-Synthetic Alternatives\n\nIn our journey towards more health and eco-conscious choices, Tier 3\nmaterials/fabrics \u2013 which we've named Mindful Alternatives \u2013 play a unique and\nimportant role. This tier focuses on materials free from plastics, aligning\nwith our commitment to reducing plastic use and its environmental impact.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these materials may involve some trade-\noffs in terms of chemical processing that may raise environmental or health\nconcerns. This is where the 'mindful' aspect comes into play \u2013 understanding\nand weighing the pros and cons.\n\n### Rayon\n\nA semi-synthetic fiber known for its silk-like texture and feel. Rayon is\nderived from wood pulp and is often praised for its softness and versatility.\nHowever, its production process raises some environmental and health concerns.\n\nUses: Commonly found in various clothing and bedding items, due to its ability\nto mimic the properties of cotton and silk. Its affordability also makes it a\npopular choice in the fashion industry.\n\nGood to know: While rayon is based on a natural material (wood pulp), its\ntransformation into fiber involves intense chemical processing. This process\ntypically includes a heavy chemical bath, turning the pulp into a viscous\nsolution, which is then spun into fibers. The environmental impact of this\nprocess is considerable, contributing to deforestation and pollution due to\nthe chemicals used. Additionally, the chemical processing involved in rayon\nproduction can pose health risks to the workers involved in its manufacturing\nand potentially to the end consumers. As such, while rayon offers certain\ndesirable textile properties and cost benefits, it is important to be aware of\nits environmental and health implications in the production process, making it\na material that requires mindful consideration.\n\n### Modal\n\nA type of rayon, modal is a semi-synthetic fabric known for its softness and\nhigh strength when wet. It's derived from the cellulose of beech trees and is\nparticularly appreciated for its silky, smooth texture and lustrous finish.\n\nUses: Modal is widely used in clothing, such as underwear, pajamas, and\nsportswear, due to its breathability, moisture-wicking properties, and\nresistance to shrinkage and fading. It's also found in home textiles like bed\nlinens and towels.\n\nGood to know: While modal shares many characteristics with standard rayon,\nincluding its base in natural cellulose, it is generally considered more\nenvironmentally friendly due to more sustainable and efficient processing\nmethods. However, like rayon, the production of modal still involves chemical\nprocessing, notably using chemicals such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and carbon\ndisulfide (CS2), which can have environmental and health impacts.\n\n### Viscose\n\nA type of rayon, viscose is a semi-synthetic fabric made from regenerated\ncellulose, typically derived from wood pulp. Known for its silk-like luster,\nsmooth feel, and high absorbency, viscose closely mimics the qualities of silk\nand cotton.\n\nUses: Viscose is commonly used in a variety of garments, such as dresses,\nshirts, and linings, due to its draping quality. It's also found in home\ntextiles like bedding and curtains, offering a soft, comfortable feel.\n\nGood to know: The production of viscose involves dissolving cellulose in a\nchemical solution, usually containing sodium hydroxide and carbon disulfide,\nto create a viscose solution which is then spun into fibers. This process is\nsimilar to other types of rayon but is distinct in its use of specific\nchemicals and methods. While viscose offers desirable textile properties, the\nenvironmental and health concerns associated with its production process are\nsignificant. The chemicals used can be harmful to both factory workers and the\nenvironment if not properly managed. This has led to increased interest in\nmore sustainable and safer methods of producing viscose, including closed-loop\nprocesses that minimize chemical waste and exposure.\n\n### Synthetic Blend Latex\n\nA material often marketed as natural latex, but actually includes a blend of\nnatural and synthetic rubber. Synthetic blend latex is less environmentally\nfriendly than 100% natural latex and may involve additional chemicals in its\nprocessing.\n\nUses: Common in various products where elasticity is key, such as mattresses,\nfurniture, gloves, and medical supplies. It's also found in certain clothing\nitems where stretch and durability are important.\n\nGood to know: Synthetic blend latex differs from 100% natural latex as it\ntypically contains petrochemical compounds, which can reduce the product's\noverall biodegradability and eco-friendliness.\n\n### Polylactic Acid (PLA)\n\nA biodegradable bioplastic derived from renewable resources like corn starch\nor sugarcane.\n\nUses: Common in single-use products like packaging, disposable cutlery, and\nbags. Also used in 3-D printing and as a biodegradable medical implant\nmaterial.\n\nGood to know: While PLA is biodegradable under industrial composting\nconditions, it poses challenges in traditional recycling systems and can\ncontribute to contamination of the recycling stream if not properly sorted.\nIts production also raises concerns about land use and food security, as it\ncompetes with food crops for agricultural resources.\n\n### Pineapple Leaf Fiber (Pi\u00f1atex)\n\nPi\u00f1atex is a distinctive and sustainable textile developed by Ananas Anam,\nmade from the waste leaves of pineapples. As a popular vegan alternative to\nanimal leather, Pi\u00f1atex stands out with its unique texture and feel, closely\nresembling traditional leather.\n\nUses: Pi\u00f1atex is extensively utilized in the fashion industry, particularly\nfor creating bags, shoes, wallets, and clothing accessories. Its adaptability\nalso makes it suitable for use in upholstery and interior design, offering an\neco-friendly option.\n\nGood to know: The process of creating Pi\u00f1atex involves an innovative approach\nto sustainability, using a byproduct of pineapple cultivation to reduce waste.\nHowever, it's important to note that Pi\u00f1atex, as a finished product, includes\nsome synthetic elements. The pineapple fibers are bonded using a resin, which\nmay contain synthetic compounds to enhance the durability and functionality of\nthe material. This incorporation of synthetic components is necessary to meet\nthe performance standards expected of a leather alternative. As such, while\nPi\u00f1atex is a significant step forward in terms of environmental\nresponsibility, it does blend natural and synthetic materials in its\nproduction.\n\n## Tier 4: Avoidable Materials\n\nPetroleum-based Synthetics\n\nIn the world of fashion, textiles, and everyday essentials, a variety of\nmaterials have become staples due to their adaptability and cheaper cost of\nproduction. Yet, many of these, derived from petrochemicals \u2013 essentially\nrefined oil \u2013 present health risks that can no longer be overlooked.\n\nThe concerns are wide-ranging, but the evidence is mounting.\n\nAs these synthetic materials break down, they shed small pieces of plastic,\nwhich have become known as microplastics.\n\nParticularly concerning is the ability of microplastics to cross the blood-\nbrain barrier. This barrier is a critical defense mechanism of the body,\nprotecting the brain from toxins. However, new studies have shown that\nmicroplastics can bypass this barrier, potentially leading to neurological\nissues that are not yet fully understood.\n\nOther studies have shown that exposure to plastics and plasticizers can\ndisrupt the endocrine system, affecting hormonal balance and fertility\nfunctions. Microplastics can lead to changes in gut microbiota and cause\ninflammation, potentially impacting digestive health. Microplastics have also\nbeen observed in human lung tissues, suggesting a risk to respiratory health.\nMost concerning? All of this research is relatively new.\n\nWearing these fabrics and materials on our bodies and using them throughout\nour home environment is, unfortunately, only one part of the problem...\n\nWhen discarded, they contribute to the burgeoning waste in landfills and\noceans, where they persist for centuries, posing a threat to ecosystems and\ncontaminating the food and water sources we depend on.\n\nOur stance is clear: The most effective way to mitigate the hidden dangers of\nthese plastics is to avoid them entirely.\n\nTo simply stop purchasing fabrics and materials containing toxic synthetics\n(plastics).\n\nTo embark on a plastic-free lifestyle.\n\nThat said, the more familiar you are with today\u2019s commonly used hazardous\nmaterials and fabrics, which we\u2019ll cover below, the better consumer you can\nbe. Are we trying to save the world? No. Are we virtue signaling? No.\nGreenwashing? Not that, either.\n\nOur goal is to promote healthier choices simply.\n\nBecause it all starts with you \u2013 looking after your health.\n\nBy taking care of our health and wellbeing, you can also contribute to\nprotecting our planet from further pollution.\n\n### Polyester\n\nA synthetic fabric made from petroleum-based fibers, known for its durability,\nwrinkle resistance, and quick-drying properties. Polyester alone makes up a\nstaggering 50% of the fabrics used in America today \u2013 a number that\u2019s still\nrising \u2013 primarily due to its low cost and versatility.\n\nUses: Just about everything. Polyester's applications are vast, ranging from\nclothing like shirts, pants, and dresses, to home essentials such as curtains,\nbedding, and upholstery. It's also commonly used in athletic gear, due to its\nwater-resistant qualities.\n\nGood to know: Polyester is to the fashion industry as seed oils are to big\nfood industry. While polyester offers practical benefits in textile\nproduction, its health and environmental impacts are significant. Starting\nwith petroleum (a bad enough start), the process includes several stages of\nchemical cleansing, extreme heating, spinning, melting, and additional\nchemical treatment. A major concern is its contribution to microplastic\npollution; washing polyester garments releases tiny fibers into the air, our\nlungs, and on our skin.\n\n### Elastane\n\nElastane, also known as Spandex or Lycra, is a synthetic fiber known for its\nexceptional elasticity. It's a polyurethane-based material, valued for its\nability to stretch up to five times its original length and return to its\noriginal state.\n\nUses: Elastane's stretchy quality makes it a staple in various forms of tight-\nfitting clothing, including activewear, swimwear, and underwear. It is also\ncommonly blended with other fabrics in clothing to add stretch, as well as in\nhome textiles like fitted sheets for a snug fit.\n\nGood to know: Elastane is a bit of a hidden staple in the fashion world. It\u2019s\ncommonly found in small percentages (up to ~5%) across even the most\n\u201cethical,\u201d \u201csustainable\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d clothing items to ensure a comfortable,\nsecure fit. Think waistbands, collars, joggers, socks, etc.\n\nThe production of elastane does involve complex chemical processes, including\nthe use of substances like polyurethane and various solvents. As an entirely\nsynthetic fabric, no organic materials are used to make this substance, and it\ndoes not exist anywhere in nature. In terms of shedding, elastane does\ncontribute to microplastic pollution. Additionally, elastane can sometimes\ncause skin irritation, especially in tight-fitting garments where prolonged\nskin contact occurs.\n\n### Nylon\n\nA synthetic polymer, nylon is a resilient, versatile material originally\ndesigned as a silk substitute. It's known for its strength, elasticity, and\nresistance to mildew and moths.\n\nUses: Nylon's uses extend beyond clothing, such as swimwear, windbreakers,\nrain jackets, compression shorts, and wetsuits, to a variety of items\nincluding ropes, toothbrush bristles, and sleeping bags. It's also common in\nhome textiles like carpets and upholstery due to its durability.\n\nGood to know: Nylon poses concerns due to its petrochemical origin and the\nchemicals involved in its production, which can include adipic acid and\nhexamethylene diamine. When it comes to consumer use, Nylon can release\nmicroplastics into the environment, particularly during washing. Additionally,\nNylon products can off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particularly\nwhen new, which may affect indoor air quality and pose respiratory risks.\n\n### Recycled Polyester\n\nA fabric derived from post-consumer plastic waste, recycled polyester is often\ntouted as a sustainable option, made from items like plastic water bottles and\nfishing nets recovered from oceans and landfills. It's seen as a way for\nbrands to engage in sustainable practices.\n\nUses: Recycled polyester is found in various products, from clothing and\naccessories to home textiles. Its applications are similar to traditional\npolyester, offering the same versatility and durability.\n\nGood to know: Despite the \"recycled\" label, it's important to approach\nrecycled polyester with a critical eye. While you are extending the life of\nplastic waste that would otherwise impact our planet, at the end of the day\nit's still post-consumer garbage (quite literally), washed and reprocessed\nwith chemicals. Regarding health, troubling studies have shown that recycled\nplastic fabrics are prone to just as much, if not more, shedding, while other\nstudies suggest that recycling plastics possibly exacerbates our global\nmicroplastic dilemma.\n\nBy wearing and using products made from recycled polyester, we are essentially\nrepurposing waste materials for direct contact with our bodies, raising\nquestions about the long-term health implications.\n\n### Polyurethane (PU)\n\nPolyurethane, commonly known as PU, is a synthetic polymer used in a wide\nrange of applications. Primarily used in the manufacturing of foam in padded\nfurniture, it's also notable for its adaptability to other forms due to its\nunique properties. PU can be transformed into both a fiber and an elastomer,\nleveraging its inherent elasticity. Think of it as a versatile \"chameleon\"\nmaterial, adapting to various shapes and uses.\n\nUses: Polyurethane is used as the core foam in mattresses, couches, and\nmattress toppers, given its cushiony properties. It is also found in carpets,\nkitchen sponges, shoe soles, and even in paints, coatings, sealants, and\nadhesives. Additionally, due to its elastic properties, polyurethane is\nessential in manufacturing fibers like spandex and lycra, commonly used in\nstretchy, form-fitting clothing.\n\nGood to know: The versatility of polyurethane comes with several health\nconsiderations. Its production involves the use of chemicals and solvents,\nsuch as isocyanates and dibutylin, both known carcinogens. In household\napplications, polyurethane contributes to indoor air pollution through off-\ngassing VOCs, which can lead to respiratory issues and other health concerns.\nProducts made with polyurethane, especially furniture and mattresses, are\noften treated with flame retardants containing endocrine-disrupting chemicals.\nLast but not least, as PU breaks down, it contributes to microplastic\npollution, a concern for both human health and environmental sustainability.\nThe widespread use of PU, particularly in common items like furniture and\nclothing, underscores the importance of being aware of its potential impacts\nand considering healthier alternatives.\n\n### Polyethylene (PE)\n\nPolyethylene is the world\u2019s most common plastic, known for its versatility and\nwide range of applications. It is a polymer made from ethylene, a compound\nderived from petroleum and natural gas.\n\nUses: In textiles it's found in some waterproof fabrics due to its moisture-\nresistant properties. Beyond clothing, polyethylene is a primary material in\nplastic bags, bottles, containers, food packaging, and household items like\ncutting boards and storage bins. It's also used in the construction of pipes\nand insulation.\n\nGood to know: From a health perspective, polyethylene poses concerns related\nto its production and disposal. While it is less toxic compared to some other\nplastics, its manufacturing process involves petrochemicals and can release\nharmful emissions. Polyethylene items can leach chemicals, particularly when\nheated or in contact with oily substances, potentially contaminating food or\ndrinks. When polyethylene products break down, they release microplastics that\ncan contaminate water and soil, ultimately entering the food chain and\npotentially impacting human health. The widespread use of polyethylene,\nespecially in disposable products, highlights the need for more sustainable\nalternatives and better waste management practices to mitigate its\nenvironmental footprint.\n\n### Acrylic\n\nAcrylic is a synthetic polymer derived from fossil fuels that can be\nformulated to mimic the properties of natural fibers like wool. The acrylic\nfabric is known for its lightweight, soft, and warm characteristics.\n\nUses: Commonly found in clothing (sweaters, fleece jackets, gloves, hats,\nsocks), home textiles (blankets, rugs, carpets), upholstery, and even craft\nsupplies (yarn, felt). Acrylic is also well-suited for awnings, boat covers,\nand outdoor furniture due to its resistance to fading, mildew, and sunlight.\n\nGood to Know: Acrylic is one of the most dangerous, commonly used fabrics in\nthe world today. Studies show acrylic sheds significantly more microplastics\nthan other fabrics during washing, polluting the air you breathe, water, and\nour food chain. In the study, researchers found acrylic released over 700,000\nmicroplastics per wash, compared to polyester's 496,000 and cotton-polyester\nblends 138,000.\n\nWhile extremely harmful toxins/chemicals aren\u2019t commonly present in the final\nproduct, the production process of acrylic does warrant some consideration. It\ninvolves toxic base substances like Polyacrylonitrile and Acrylonitrile.\nPolyacrylonitrile is highly flammable and mimics cyanide poisoning when\ninhaled, while Acrylonitrile is a toxic liquid, harmful to the eyes, skin,\nlungs, and nervous system and is directly linked to certain cancers.\n\nA range of other chemicals (formaldehyde, phthalates, chlorine, and solvents\nsuch as acetone and dimethyl formamide) and flame retardants (bromine\ncompounds) are used to produce some forms of acrylic that we won\u2019t even get\ninto.\n\nWhile the risk from wearing acrylic clothing may be lower, especially if\nwashed before wearing, the presence of these toxic substances in the fabric's\nlifecycle makes acrylic a less desirable choice for health-conscious\nconsumers.\n\nDiscover the brands, products and insights you need to start your plastic-free\njourney.\n\nBrands\n\nApparelHousehold\n\nFollow us\n\nInstagram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nCompany\n\nAboutOur MissionGlossaryFAQ & ContactSubmit a Brand\n\n\u00a9 2024 Unwrap.
