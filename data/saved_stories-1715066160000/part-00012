Johnson, for her part, added: \u201cI may take up a minor\nin math, but I don\u2019t want that to be my job job.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s conversation on CBS\u2019s popular Sunday evening news magazine were\nperhaps their most extensive, widely broadcast remarks to date on the new\nground that they broke with respect to the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThe 2,000-year-old theorem established that the sum of the squares of a right\ntriangle\u2019s two shorter sides equals the square of the hypotenuse \u2013 the third,\nlongest side opposite the shape\u2019s right angle. Countless schoolchildren taking\ngeometry have memorized the notation summarizing the theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2.\n\nFor 2,000 years, mathematicians maintained that any alleged proof of the\nPythagorean theorem that was based in trigonometry would constitute a logical\nfallacy known as circular reason \u2013 in essence, trying to validate an idea with\nthe idea itself.\n\nBut the bonus question on a math contest that Johnson and Jackson took home to\ncomplete during the Christmas break of their final year at St Mary\u2019s served as\nthe impetus for them to plot out a new way to demonstrate that one could\nindeed use trigonometry to prove Pythagoras\u2019s theorem.\n\nTheir work was so compelling that the pair went to a regional meeting of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society in Atlanta in March 2023 to outline their\nfindings. At the organization\u2019s recommendation, Jackson and Johnson have\nsubmitted their discoveries for final peer review and publication \u2013 as well as\nworking on additional proofs while that process is pending, as 60 Minutes\nnoted.\n\nThe 60 Minutes interview gave Johnson and Jackson occasion to reflect on the\nintense reaction caused by initial media reports on their innovative work at\nSt Mary\u2019s, a Catholic high school that has been dedicated to educating Black\ngirls since its founding shortly after the US civil war.\n\nSome of it was negative. Some in the math community smarted at claims in a\npress release issued by St Mary\u2019s that asserted Jackson and Johnson\u2019s research\nwas \u201cunprecedented\u201d. And they flocked to social media demanding that a 2009\ntrigonometry-based proof for Pythagoras\u2019s theorem get its due.\n\nYet a lot of the reaction to Johnson and Jackson was positive, especially as\nmathematicians who picked apart their work confirmed that \u2013 by all indications\n\u2013 they had arrived at a valid new proof, a celebration-worthy accomplishment.\n\nMichelle Obama wrote a post on social media that linked to a story about\nJohnson and Jackson, adding the text: \u201cI just love this story. ... Way to go,\nNe\u2019Kiya and Calcea! I\u2019m rooting for you and can\u2019t wait to see what you all do\nnext.\u201d\n\nThey also received a commendation from Louisiana\u2019s then governor as well as\nsymbolic keys to the city of New Orleans.\n\nAsked on 60 Minutes why they thought people were so impressed with what they\nhad done, Jackson said she thought the public was surprised young Black women\ncould author such a feat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be celebrated for what it is,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cLike \u2013 it\u2019s a great\nmathematical achievement.\u201d\n\nJackson is now attending New Orleans\u2019 Xavier University and enrolled in its\npharmacy department. Meanwhile, Johnson \u2013 who graduated from St Mary\u2019s as its\nvaledictorian \u2013 is now an environmental engineering student at Louisiana State\nUniversity in Baton Rouge.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US news\n  * New Orleans\n  * Mathematics\n  * Louisiana\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
