Engineers have turned to heteroclinic connections as a way of\ntransferring a spacecraft between orbits without expending propellant.\nHowever, calculating these points presents a challenge, requiring either\nimmense amounts of computing power or a human-in-the-loop to make an\nintelligent estimate that can be worked from.\n\nIn 2019, a paper was published, extolling the virtues of using artificial\nneural networks to identify heteroclinic connections.\n\nThe Voyager probes undertook the Grand Tour [PDF] based on a certain alignment\nof the planets that occurs once every 175 years. They used orbital mechanics\nand gravity assists to take in Jupiter, Saturn, and, in the case of Voyager 2,\nUranus, and Neptune. However, the need to save fuel on missions closer to home\nhas become a priority, thanks in part to NASA's Artemis program.\n\nWhile a direct moonshot is all well and good, planners want to cut down on the\nfuel needed for expeditions around the vicinity of the Moon, particularly\nconsidering that a substantial chunk of the Artemis program involves the\nconstruction of the Lunar Gateway in orbit around the Moon. Hence the need for\nfuel-minimal trajectories in the vicinity of the Moon.\n\nIt's a variation of the classic three-body problem. One body is the spacecraft\nitself, while the other two are the Earth and the Moon. Yet calculating a\ntrajectory to travel from point A to point B while using minimal fuel, thanks\nto heteroclinic connections, is no easy task.\n\nThe approach published by Postgraduate Research Student Danny Owen and\nLecturer in Orbital Mechanics Dr Nicola Baresi this week uses knot theory, an\narea of mathematics. This is used to generate rough trajectories that can then\nbe refined, effectively giving space agencies a variety of possible routes\nfrom a specific orbit.\n\n  * US reckons it's about time the Moon had its own time zone\n  * Solar eclipse darkened skies, dampened internet traffic\n  * NASA to shoot rockets at April solar eclipse to see how it messes with the atmosphere\n  * Google searches for boss to get grip on climate, energy costs of this AI hype cycle\n\nOwen said: \"Previously, when the likes of NASA wanted to plot a route, their\ncalculations relied on either brute force or guesswork.\n\n\"Our new technique neatly reveals all possible routes a spacecraft could take\nfrom A to B, as long as both orbits share a common energy level.\n\n\"This makes the task of planning missions much simpler. We think of it as a\ntube map for space.\"\n\nThe researchers have applied the technique to other planetary systems,\nincluding the Galilean moons of Jupiter, in addition to the Earth-Moon system.\n\u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Space\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Space\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Artemis\n  * Asteroid\n  * Astronomy\n  * Black Hole\n  * CSA\n  * Earth\n  * ESA\n  * Exomoon\n  * Exoplanet\n  * Galaxy\n  * Hubble Space Telescope\n  * ISS\n  * James Webb Space Telescope\n  * JAXA\n  * Moon\n  * NASA\n  * Roscosmos\n  * Satellite\n  * Solar System\n  * Square Kilometre Array\n\n#### More about\n\n2 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Space\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Space\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Artemis\n  * Asteroid\n  * Astronomy\n  * Black Hole\n  * CSA\n  * Earth\n  * ESA\n  * Exomoon\n  * Exoplanet\n  * Galaxy\n  * Hubble Space Telescope\n  * ISS\n  * James Webb Space Telescope\n  * JAXA\n  * Moon\n  * NASA\n  * Roscosmos\n  * Satellite\n  * Solar System\n  * Square Kilometre Array\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Space Force boss warns 'the US will lose' without help from Musk and\nBezos\n\nChina, Russia have muscled up, and whoever wins up there wins down here\n\nSecurity9 days | 41\n\n#### NASA will send astronauts to patch up leaky ISS telescope\n\nThermal shield damage is screwing with daytime observations of X-ray bursts\n\nScience2 days | 11\n\n#### NASA confirms Florida house hit by a piece of ISS battery pack\n\nWho needs aircon when you have NASA to punch holes through your home?\n\nScience4 days | 38\n\n#### Reducing the cloud security overhead\n\nWhy creating a layered defensive strategy that includes security by design can\nhelp address cloud challenges\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### NASA needs new ideas and tech to get Mars Sample Return mission off the\nground\n\nCurrent plans are too expensive and slow, meaning China could win race to\nscore red rocks\n\nScience4 days | 42\n\n#### NASA solar sail to be Siriusly visible in orbit from Earth\n\nLook out for a new star next week\n\nScience19 hrs | 12\n\n#### Mars helicopter sends final message, but will keep collecting data\n\nOne last software update installed safely, reconfigured it as 'stationary\ntestbed'\n\nScience2 days | 20\n\n#### Solar eclipse darkened skies, dampened internet traffic\n\nByteflow dropped by around half under some of the path of totality\n\nNetworks11 days | 25\n\n#### Alibaba signs to explore one-hour rocket deliveries\n\nChinese space startup claims it has the tech to make it happen.
