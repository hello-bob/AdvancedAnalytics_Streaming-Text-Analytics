From there, the\nhistorically important 12-string was gifted to a road manager and then\ndisappeared for more than 50 years.\n\nThe well-traveled instrument was recently discovered in an attic in rural\nEngland, found while the home owners were packing up for a move. They\ncontacted the Beverley Hills auction house, and Julien's Auctions' founders\nhopped over the pond for a closer look.\n\nJohn Lennon's 1964 Framus 5/024 Hootenanny is the headline act for the\nupcoming Music Icons sale, where it's expected to set new auction records\n\nJulien's Auctions\n\nThe guitar \u2013 serial number #51083 \u2013 has a spruce top in natural finish with\nmahogany back and sides, a mahogany neck topped by a rosewood fingerboard\nrocking 19 frets, with a trapeze tailpiece and floating rosewood bridge.\nDuring the visit, the original Australian-made guitar case was also recovered\nfrom the trash heap.\n\n\"The discovery of John Lennon\u2019s Help! guitar that was believed to be lost is\nconsidered the greatest find of a Beatles guitar since Paul McCartney\u2019s lost\n1961 H\u00f6fner bass guitar,\" said Darren Julien, co-founder and Executive\nDirector at Julien\u2019s Auctions. \"Finding this remarkable instrument is like\nfinding a lost Rembrandt or Picasso, and it still looks and plays like a dream\nafter having been preserved in an attic for more than 50 years. To awaken this\nsleeping beauty is a sacred honor and is a great moment for Music, Julien\u2019s,\nBeatles and Auction history.\"\n\nLennon's recovered icon is said to be in tip-top condition, and will now\nheadline the upcoming Julien's Auctions Music Icons sale at the Hard Rock Cafe\nin New York on May 29 and 30 (and online as well). It's been given a somewhat\nconservative estimate of between US$600,000 and $800,000.\n\nGeorge Harrison picking away at the Framus 5/024 Hootenanny while John Lennon\nlooks on\n\nBeatles Book Photo Library\n\nIt's expected to exceed that by some margin though \u2013 perhaps eclipsing the\nauction price of Lennon's \"She Loves You\" guitar and even putting Kurt\nCobain's record-setting '59 Martin D-18E in its sights. A book titled \"The\nBeatles: Photographs From The Set of Help!\" will accompany the guitar and\ncase.\n\nFor some context, and a reminder of the importance of provenance for such\nthings, Framus 5/024 12 Hootenanny guitars not associated with Lennon\nfrequently appear at auctions and on music resale platforms like Reverb for a\nfraction of the anticipated Music Icons price.\n\nThe auction house is also highlighting other notable additions to next month's\nsale, including a rose-sparkle Fender P bass from U2's Adam Clayton, a stage-\nplayed Kramer six-string used by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce co-founder Mick Mars, a hand-\nwritten setlist penned by Kurt Cobain, and selections from the wardrobes of\nTina Turner, Amy Winehouse, Joan Jett, Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury.\n\nItems from the auction go on display at the Hard Rock Cafe Piccadilly Circus\n(in London) from today, before making their way to New York next month for a\npre-sale exhibition and subsequent auction.
