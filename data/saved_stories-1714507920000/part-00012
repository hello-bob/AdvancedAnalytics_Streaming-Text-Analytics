What\u2019s crucial is proper and\neffective Product Management by the agency.\n\n(The beloved \u201cPO per proxy\u201d won\u2019t cut it, either.)\n\nHaving experience with both sides, I wrote some fictional letters to them.\n\n## The biggest mistake clients of digital agencies can make is writing\ntickets. \u00b6\n\nDear future client, please stop writing tickets.\n\nInstead, insist on discussing how you could best contribute in harmony with a\ndedicated product team.\n\nLeave the organization of the product team and the resources to the agency -\nthey know how to do it best.\n\nWhat are you then, instead? Well.\n\nSometimes, you are the Subject Matter Expert, having expertise and access to\nusers.\n\nMost importantly, you need to act like a CEO, owning the vision and mission\nand identifying the problems that must be addressed. You trust that the agency\nconducts effective discovery and identifies the features themselves.\n\nYour most important job is ensuring the agency has the necessary monetary\nresources to staff the team sustainably.\n\nIn this regard, You can act like a VC, first investing small amounts until you\nhave proof (in the team and the market) and then more significant amounts.\n\n## The biggest mistake digital agencies can make is being satisfied with a\nbriefing. \u00b6\n\nDear future agencies, please take responsibility for the product and move away\nfrom the mindset that someone from the client should tell you what to build.\n\nMost clients lack product management competence or cannot do it because they\nhave too much detailed knowledge and get lost in details. In most cases, it\u2019s\nboth.\n\nProduct management is a skill that must be learned over several years, for\nexample, in a startup committed to a vision. It means responsibility for\nproviding value to the customer (value risk) while being viable for the\nbusiness.\n\nPlease take responsibility for all product risks (value risk, business\nviability risk, feasibility risk, usability risk) and staff and bill\naccordingly\u2014only then can digital products succeed.\n\nEverything else is money wasted for the client and opportunities for the\nproduct.\n\n## Sketch of a a more successful model \u00b6\n\n  * Published On: 2024-04-30\n  * Want to leave a public comment?
