In this context, strength is\ndefined as how much force a material can withstand before it is permanently\ndeformed from its original shape, and toughness is its resistance to\nfracturing (cracking). The alloy\u2019s resilience to bending and fracture across\nan enormous range of conditions could open the door for a novel class of\nmaterials for next-generation engines that can operate at higher efficiencies.\n\nThe team, led by Robert Ritchie at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n(Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley, in collaboration with the groups led by\nprofessors Diran Apelian at UC Irvine and Enrique Lavernia at Texas A&M\nUniversity, discovered the alloy\u2019s surprising properties and then figured out\nhow they arise from interactions in the atomic structure. Their work is\ndescribed in a study recently published in the journal Science.\n\n\u201cThe efficiency of converting heat to electricity or thrust is determined by\nthe temperature at which fuel is burned \u2013 the hotter, the better. However, the\noperating temperature is limited by the structural materials which must\nwithstand it,\u201d said first author David Cook, a Ph.D. student in Ritchie\u2019s lab.\n\u201cWe have exhausted the ability to further optimize the materials we currently\nuse at high temperatures, and there\u2019s a big need for novel metallic materials.\nThat\u2019s what this alloy shows promise in.\u201d\n\nThe alloy in this study is from a new class of metals known as refractory high\nor medium entropy alloys (RHEAs/RMEAs). Most of the metals we see in\ncommercial or industrial applications are alloys made of one main metal mixed\nwith small quantities of other elements, but RHEAs and RMEAs are made by\nmixing near-equal quantities of metallic elements with very high melting\ntemperatures, which gives them unique properties that scientists are still\nunraveling. Ritchie\u2019s group has been investigating these alloys for several\nyears because of their potential for high-temperature applications.\n\nThis material structure map shows kink bands formed near a crack tip during\ncrack propagation (from left to right) in the alloy at 25 C, room temperature.\nMade with a electron-backscatter diffraction detector in a scanning electron\nmicroscope.

The best cryogenic\nsteels, specially engineered to resist fracture, are about 20 times tougher\nthan these materials. Yet the niobium, tantalum, titanium, and hafnium\n(Nb_45Ta_25Ti_15Hf_15) RMEA alloy was able to beat even the cryogenic steel,\nclocking in at over 25 times tougher than typical RMEAs at room temperature.\n\nBut engines don\u2019t operate at room temperature. The scientists evaluated\nstrength and toughness at five temperatures total: -196\u00b0C (the temperature of\nliquid nitrogen), 25\u00b0C (room temperature), 800\u00b0C, 950\u00b0C, and 1200\u00b0C. The last\ntemperature is about 1/5 the surface temperature of the sun.\n\nThe team found that the alloy had the highest strength in the cold and became\nslightly weaker as the temperature rose, but still boasted impressive figures\nthroughout the wide range. The fracture toughness, which is calculated from\nhow much force it takes to propagate an existing crack in a material, was high\nat all temperatures.\n\n#### Unraveling the atomic arrangements\n\nAlmost all metallic alloys are crystalline, meaning that the atoms inside the\nmaterial are arranged in repeating units. However, no crystal is perfect, they\nall contain defects. The most prominent defect that moves is called the\ndislocation, which is an unfinished plane of atoms in the crystal. When force\nis applied to a metal it causes many dislocations to move to accommodate the\nshape change.\n\nFor example, when you bend a paper clip which is made of aluminum, the\nmovement of dislocations inside the paper clip accommodates the shape change.\nHowever, the movement of dislocations becomes more difficult at lower\ntemperatures and as a result many materials become brittle at low temperatures\nbecause dislocations cannot move. This is why the steel hull of the Titanic\nfractured when it hit an iceberg. Elements with high melting temperatures and\ntheir alloys take this to the extreme, with many remaining brittle up to even\n800\u00b0C. However, this RMEA bucks the trend, withstanding snapping even at\ntemperatures as low as liquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C).\n\nThis map shows kink bands formed near a crack tip during crack propagation\ntesting (from left to right) in the alloy at -196 C. Credit: Berkeley Lab\n\nTo understand what was happening inside the remarkable metal, co-investigator\nAndrew Minor and his team analyzed the stressed samples, alongside unbent and\nuncracked control samples, using four-dimensional scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy (4D-STEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy\n(STEM) at the National Center for Electron Microscopy, part of Berkeley Lab\u2019s\nMolecular Foundry.\n\nThe electron microscopy data revealed that the alloy\u2019s unusual toughness comes\nfrom an unexpected side effect of a rare defect called a kink band. Kink bands\nform in a crystal when an applied force causes strips of the crystal to\ncollapse on themselves and abruptly bend. The direction in which the crystal\nbends in these strips increases the force that dislocations feel, causing them\nto move more easily. On the bulk level, this phenomenon causes the material to\nsoften (meaning that less force has to be applied to the material as it is\ndeformed). The team knew from past research that kink bands formed easily in\nRMEAs, but assumed that the softening effect would make the material less\ntough by making it easier for a crack to spread through the lattice. But in\nreality, this is not the case.\n\n\u201cWe show, for the first time, that in the presence of a sharp crack between\natoms, kink bands actually resist the propagation of a crack by distributing\ndamage away from it, preventing fracture and leading to extraordinarily high\nfracture toughness,\u201d said Cook.\n\nThe Nb_45Ta_25Ti_15Hf_15 alloy will need to undergo a lot more fundamental\nresearch and engineering testing before anything like a jet plane turbine or\nSpaceX rocket nozzle is made from it, said Ritchie, because mechanical\nengineers rightfully require a deep understanding of how their materials\nperform before they use them in the real world. However, this study indicates\nthat the metal has the potential to build the engines of the future.\n\nReference: \u201cKink bands promote exceptional fracture resistance in a NbTaTiHf\nrefractory medium-entropy alloy\u201d by David H.
