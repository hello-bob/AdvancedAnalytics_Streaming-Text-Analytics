For the 1793 novel, see Christian\nHeinrich Spiess.\n\nStatue of Peterm\u00e4nnchen\n\nPeterm\u00e4nnchen (English: \"Little Peterman\") is a small good-natured household\nspirit who is said to live in the Schwerin Palace in Schwerin, Mecklenburg,\nGermany.^[1] The diminutive spirit, maybe only a few feet tall, is often\ndescribed as carrying many keys, roaming through the vaults and tunnels\nunderneath the castle, unlocking doors as he goes. Other descriptions of\nPeterm\u00e4nnchen have him carrying a lantern and a sword or dagger. He is also\nsaid to be the keeper and watchman of the castle, rewarding those who are\nhonest and good. Conversely the spirit will punish or drive away thieves and\nintruders. To do so Peterm\u00e4nnchen will cause a nuisance or play pranks. The\nspirit is said to make crashing and banging noises at night. Peterm\u00e4nnchen is\nalso said to have woken soldiers who fell asleep on their night-watch in order\nto save them from being punished.^[2]^[3]\n\nLegend further has it that when Christianity first came to the Schwerin area,\na pagan god, who was worshiped at the site of the present Schwerin castle,\nfled leaving his servants, the spirits. Eventually these spirits also\ndeparted, except for one: Peterm\u00e4nnchen, who would not leave his post. Other\nlegends surrounding the ghost have him once working in the tunnels as a\nblacksmith.\n\nPeterm\u00e4nnchen has been described as appearing in numerous forms over the\nyears, sometimes as an old man with a white, flowing beard extended down to\nhis waist. On another occasions Peterm\u00e4nnchen would have a cavalier look with\na stylish moustache, wearing a waistcoat, riding boots with spurs and a\nfeathered hat.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"The Haunted Castle\".
