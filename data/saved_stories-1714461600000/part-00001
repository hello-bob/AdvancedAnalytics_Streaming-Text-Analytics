Sure, it makes sense for protestors to take costly actions\nto show how much they care about their cause. And it makes sense for them to\ndefy particular laws when they want others to consider cancelling those laws.\nBut why go beyond that to break laws to which they don\u2019t object, and to induce\ndirect physical force to be used on them in enforcing those laws?\n\nThe second puzzle is why law tends to excuse and cut punishments for \u201ccrimes\nof passion\u201d, not planned beforehand, and also when the guilty party apologizes\nand acts contrite afterward. Note that we don\u2019t do this for small legal\nviolations, like a speeding or parking ticket. You won\u2019t get out of these by\nshowing that you did them at the last minute without planning them beforehand,\nor by showing afterward how sorry you are and now see the error of your ways\nand will never ever do it again. But we let such factors influence the\npunishment for violent crimes like murder.\n\nMy explanation is that humans have long developed a set of social norms\ndesigned to limit feuds. In a feud, opposing coalitions repeatedly hurt each\nother, typically physically, each time in retaliation for prior hurts in the\nseries. Feuds can be very damaging, and hard to stop once they get going. So\nwe pay more attention to events plausibly related to feudes, and we have\nspecial social norms, attitudes, and habits designed to prevent them from\nstarting, and to end them once they do start.\n\nAnd as we see a revolution as related to an extreme feud, we apply similar\nattitudes and habits when some large coalition seems to threaten to cause a\nfull breakdown of the social order, in order to forcibly replace existing\nrules and authorities with a whole new set.\n\nOne such habit is to draw a clear line at direct physical harm. We\u2019ll tend to\nlet it slide if two sides merely dislike each other, insult each other, refuse\nto socialize or do business with each other, or fail to tell each other\nhelpful info. But once one side physically touches the other, to hurt them or\nforce them to do things, we see that as crossing a clear bright line. That\u2019s\nwhen observers plan to step in, make it stop, and blame whomever crossed that\nline.\n\nAnother such habit is treating violations that seem more likely to perpetuate\na feud more severely than those that seem more likely to end them. So as feuds\nare continued by intentional reprisals, we treat intentional harms more\nseverely than accidental harms. And as someone who seems sincerely sorry for\ntheir crime seems less likely to continue a feud by committing more of those\ncrimes, we treat that less severely. But we only apply these adjustments to\nharms that could plausibly be part of a feud. Parking and speeding tickets are\nnot plausibly such harms, so they don\u2019t get such adjustments.\n\nTo gain attention for their cause, many protestors try to frame their actions\nas being possibly the start of a revolution. Large coordinated co-located mobs\ndefying laws, and physical violence happening to them, tend to cause such\nframing. We then see police causing physical violence to them as crossing that\nbright feud line, and sympathize more with the protestors who didn\u2019t cross\nthat line. Even though they violated the law on purpose.\n\nAnd that\u2019s my theory.\n\n### Subscribe to Overcoming Bias\n\nBy Robin Hanson \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nThis is a blog on why we believe and do what we do, why we pretend otherwise,\nhow we might do better, and what our descendants might do, if they don't all\ndie.\n\n34 Likes\n\n34\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Feud-Limiting Norms\n\nwww.overcomingbias.com\n\n36\n\nShare\n\n36 Comments\n\nSteevenBlue Pine20 hrs agoHonestly, I rarely see violence done to the\nprotestors. And most reporting that I read, even in widely read newspapers,\nonly reports on the law breaking protestors, not on the physical force used on\nthem. I think it's more likely that law breaking protestors are seeking\nattention and status from other people like themExpand full commentLike\n(4)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n4 replies by Robin Hanson and others\n\nDavesNotHere20 hrs agoMaybe we have an overblown idea of feuds.A while ago,\n(long enough for the details to get fuzzy) I read something about the famous\nAmerican feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys. As I recall, although it\napparently affected people's imaginations for a long while, the actual number\nof violent incidents and the length of time it continued were much smaller\nthan I would have imagined from its reputation.In the medieval period feud was\nsort of an informal system of policing. The reduced prevalence of honor\nculture and herding, which both contributed to its necessity/popularity, might\nalso explain its disappearance.But I am just a guy on the internet, I don\u2019t\neven pretend my facts are authoritative.Expand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n3 replies by Robin Hanson and others\n\n34 more comments...\n\nA Fertility Reckoning\n\nThose who consume too much alcohol or other recreational drugs often make\nexcuses.
