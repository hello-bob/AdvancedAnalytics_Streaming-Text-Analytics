Why?\n\nVlad C\u0103lin\n\nApr 29, 2024\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why do indie hackers bet on their personal branding?\n\njointhetechbubble.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nRecently I came to a realization: in the indie hacking space, there are people\nwho are pushing a lot to build up their personal brand, communicating about\ntheir builder journey, sharing their numbers openly and putting themselves as\nthe face of their business.\n\nAnd often, their social media accounts aren\u2019t promoting anything related to\ntheir product directly. Things like new features, use cases, etc. They just\nshare things about the indie hacking process.\n\nHere\u2019s some examples:\n\nYou can see the pattern... they talk a lot about the insides of their\nbusiness, being open and transparent about it. But for most, they are not\ntalking about the business itself, meaning their personal accounts are not a\ndistribution channel for their indie business... or is it?\n\n#\n\nThe actual reason they are building their personal brand\n\nFor most of them, the actual reason is different: they are targeting other\nindie hackers as their customer base, and they are building their distribution\nchannel to sell them other products.\n\nSome of them have their own podcast that is aimed to indie hackers, some of\nthem have newsletters or the ones who really aim to cash in big on the indie\nhacking trend have courses where they teach how to become a successful indie\nhacker.\n\nAnd they are building their personal brands in order to funnel people into\nthese side businesses, which in some cases might be more profitable than their\nmain ones.\n\nIn other cases, their main business is actually targeted at indie hackers,\nwith things such as code boilerplates, marketing tools, content generation,\nsocial media analytics. Sure, there could be other customer types to target,\nbut indie hackers is a category that is easily accessible through\n#buildinpublic, #indiehackers and sharing numbers along the way (MRR is\nprobably the most popular shared metric that draws in the most indie hackers\nas customers).\n\n#\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not something negative to post about the indie hacking process\nto create an audience of indie hackers, it\u2019s something that became more and\nmore obvious lately.\n\nIndie hackers who are building for indie hackers, who are building for indie\nhackers, and so on. It\u2019s definitely not sustainable.\n\nI think this happens because a lot of indie hackers want to build something to\nscratch their own itches, and them identifying with the indie hacking space,\nthey end up building something for it.\n\nBut the market is much more than that, and I think these indie hackers limit\nthemselves to a market that some even started to compare it as a \u201cPonzi scheme\nof boilerplates and wrappers\u201d.\n\nThanks for reading The Tech Bubble!
