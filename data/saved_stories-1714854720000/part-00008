We explore the optimization\n> metric of LLMs, which is based on predicting the next token, and develop a\n> novel model grounded in this principle. Our approach involves constructing\n> an ideal generative text model represented by a multinomial transition\n> probability matrix with a prior, and we examine how LLMs approximate this\n> matrix. We discuss the continuity of the mapping between embeddings and\n> multinomial distributions, and present the Dirichlet approximation theorem\n> to approximate any prior. Additionally, we demonstrate how text generation\n> by LLMs aligns with Bayesian learning principles and delve into the\n> implications for in-context learning, specifically explaining why in-context\n> learning emerges in larger models where prompts are considered as samples to\n> be updated. Our findings indicate that the behavior of LLMs is consistent\n> with Bayesian Learning, offering new insights into their functioning and\n> potential applications.\n\nComments:| 12 pages, 6 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nACM classes:| I.2.7  \nCite as:| arXiv:2402.03175 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2402.03175v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.03175arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Vishal Misra [view email] [v1] Mon, 5 Feb 2024 16:42:10 UTC (305 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled The Matrix: A Bayesian learning model for LLMs,\nby Siddhartha Dalal and Vishal Misra\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2402\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
