Its Owners Do\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of AI taking over humanity; we should fear the fact\nthat our humanity hasn\u2019t kept up with our technology\n\nBy Joseph Jones\n\nMoor Studio/Getty Images\n\nIn April a lawsuit revealed that Google Chrome\u2019s private browsing mode, known\nas \u201cIncognito,\u201d was not actually as private as we might think. Google was\nstill collecting data, which it has now agreed to destroy, and its \u201cprivate\u201d\nbrowsing does not actually stop websites or your Internet service provider,\nsuch as Comcast or AT&T, from tracking your activities.\n\nIn fact, that information harvesting is the whole business model of our\ndigital and smart-device-enabled world. All of our habits and behaviors are\nmonitored, reduced to \u201cdata\u201d for machine learning AI, and the findings are\nused to manipulate us for other people\u2019s gains.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. AI could be used more ethically for everyone\u2019s\nbenefit. We shouldn\u2019t fear AI as a technology. We should instead worry about\nwho owns AI and how its owners wield AI to invade privacy and erode democracy.\n\nNo surprise, tech companies, state entities, corporations and other private\ninterests increasingly invade our privacy and spy on us. Insurance companies\nmonitor their clients\u2019 sleep apnea machines to deny coverage for improper use.\nChildren\u2019s toys spy on playtime and collect data about our kids. Period\ntracker apps share with Facebook and other third parties (including state\nauthorities in abortion-restricted states) when a woman last had sex, their\ncontraceptive practices, menstrual details and even their moods. Home security\ncameras surveil customers and are susceptible to hackers. Medical apps share\npersonal information with lawyers. Data brokers, companies that track people\nacross platforms and technology, amplify these trespasses by selling bundled\nuser profiles to anyone willing to pay.\n\nThis explicit spying is obvious and feels wrong at a visceral level. What\u2019s\neven more sinister, however, is how the resulting data are used\u2014not only sold\nto advertisers or any private interest that seeks to influence our behavior,\nbut deployed for AI training in order to improve machine learning. Potentially\nthis could be a good thing. Humanity could learn more about itself,\ndiscovering our shortcomings and how we might address them. That could assist\nindividuals in getting help and meeting their needs.\n\nInstead, machine learning is used to predict and prescribe, that is, estimate\nwho we are and the things that would most likely influence us and change our\nbehavior. One such behavior is how to get us to \u201cengage\u201d more with technology\nand generate more data. AI is being used to try and know us better than we\nknow ourselves, get us addicted to technology, and impact us without our\nawareness, consent or best interest in mind. In other words, AI is not helping\nhumanity address our shortcomings, it\u2019s exploiting our vulnerabilities so\nprivate interests can guide how we think, act and feel.\n\n## Curated by Our Editors\n\n  * ### AI Can Transform the Classroom Just Like the Calculator\n\nMichael M.

To meet its\nrevenue goals, the platform used AI to keep people on the platform longer.\nThis meant finding the perfect amount of anger-inducing and provocative\ncontent, so that bullying, conspiracies, hate speech, disinformation and other\nharmful communications flourished. Experimenting on users without their\nknowledge, the company designed addictive features into the technology,\ndespite knowing that this harmed teenage girls. A United Nations report\nlabeled Facebook a \u201cuseful instrument\u201d for spreading hate in an attempted\ngenocide in Myanmar, and the company admitted the platform\u2019s role in\namplifying violence. Corporations and other interests can thus use AI to learn\nour psychological weaknesses, invite us to the most insecure version of\nourselves and push our buttons to achieve their own desired ends.\n\nSo when we use our phones, computers, home security systems, health devices,\nsmart watches, cars, toys, home assistants, apps, gadgets and what have you,\nthey are also using us. As we search, we are searched. As we narrate our lives\non social media, our stories and scrolling are captured. Despite feeling free\nand in control, we are subtly being guided (or \u201cnudged\u201d in benevolent tech\nspeak) towards constrained ideas and outcomes. Based on previous behaviors, we\nare offered a flattering and hyperindividualized world that amplifies and\nconfirms our biases, using our own interests and personalities against us to\nkeep us coming back for more. Employing AI in this manner might be good for\nbusiness, but it\u2019s disastrous for the empathy and informed deliberations\nrequired for democracy.\n\nEven as tech companies ask us to accept cookies or belatedly seek our consent,\nthese efforts are not done in good faith. They give us an illusion of privacy\neven as \u201cimproving\u201d the companies\u2019 services relies on machines learning more\nabout us than we know ourselves and finding patterns to our behavior that no\none knew they were looking for. Even the developers of AI don\u2019t know how\nexactly it works, and therefore can\u2019t meaningfully tell us what we\u2019re\nconsenting to.\n\nUnder the current business model, the advances of AI and robot technology will\nenrichen the few while making life more difficult for the many. Sure, you\ncould argue that people will benefit from the potential advances (and tech\nindustry-enthralled economists undoubtedly will so argue) in health, design\nand whatever efficiencies AI might bring. But this is less meaningful when\npeople have been robbed of their dignity, blamed for not keeping up and\ncontinuously spied on and manipulated for someone else\u2019s gain.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of AI taking over humanity; we should fear the fact\nthat our humanity hasn\u2019t kept up with our technology. Instead of enabling a\nworld where we work less and live more, billionaires have designed a system to\nreward the few at the expense of the many. While AI has and will continue to\ndo great things, it\u2019s also been used to make people more anxious, precarious\nand self-centered, as well as less free. Until we truly learn to care about\none another and consider the good of all, technology will continue to ensnare\nand not emancipate us. There\u2019s no such thing as artificial ethics, and human\nprinciples must guide our technology, not the other way around. This starts by\nasking about who owns AI and how it might be employed in everyone\u2019s best\ninterest. The future belongs to us all.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author\nor authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nJoseph Jones is an assistant professor of media at West Virginia University\nwhere he teaches courses about media ethics, law, history, sociology,\nphilosophy and power.
