Her\nelderly laboratory mice were starting to look younger. They were more\nsprightly and their coats were sleeker. Yet all she had done was to briefly\ntreat them \u2014 many weeks earlier \u2014 with a drug that corrected the organization\nof proteins inside a type of stem cell.\n\nWhen technicians who were replicating her experiment in two other labs found\nthe same thing, she started to feel more confident that the treatment was\nsomehow rejuvenating the animals. In two papers, in 2020 and 2022, her team\ndescribed how the approach extends the lifespan of mice and keeps them fit\ninto old age^1^,^2.\n\nThe target of Florian\u2019s elixir is the immune system. The stem cells she\ntreated are called haematopoietic, or blood, stem cells (HS cells), which give\nrise to all immune cells. As blood circulates, the mix of cells pervades every\norgan, affecting all bodily functions.\n\nBut the molecular composition of the HS cells changes with age, and this\ndistorts the balance of immune cells that they produce. \u201cFixing the drift in\nthem that occurs with time seems to fix a lot of the problems of ageing \u2014 not\nonly in the immune system but also in the rest of the body,\u201d says Florian, who\nis now at the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nIn March^3, another team showed that restoring the balance between two key\ntypes of immune cell gives old mice more youthful immune systems, improving\nthe animals\u2019 ability to respond to vaccines and to stave off viral infections.\n\nHow to make an old immune system young again\n\nOther scientists have used different experimental approaches to draw the same\nconclusion: rejuvenating the immune system rejuvenates many organs in an\nanimal\u2019s body, at least in mice. And, most intriguingly, evidence suggests\nthat immune-system ageing might actually drive the ageing of those organs.\n\nThe potential \u2014 helping people to remain healthy in their later years \u2014 is\nseductive. But translating this knowledge into the clinic will be challenging.\nInterfering with the highly complex immune system can be perilous, researchers\nwarn. So, at first, pioneers are setting their sights on important yet low-\nrisk goals such as improving older people\u2019s responses to vaccinations and\nimproving the efficiency of cancer immunotherapies.\n\n\u201cThe prospect that reversing immune ageing may control age-related diseases is\nenticing,\u201d says stem-cell scientist Vittorio Sebastiano at Stanford Medical\nSchool in California. \u201cBut we are moving forward cautiously.\u201d\n\n## Fading immunity\n\nThe human immune system is a complex beast whose multitudinous cellular and\nmolecular components work together to shape development, protect against\ninfections, help wounds to heal and eliminate cells that threaten to become\ncancerous. But it becomes less effective as people age and the system\u2019s\ncomposition starts to change. In older age, people become susceptible to a\nrange of infectious and non-infectious diseases \u2014 and more resistant to the\nprotective power of vaccines.\n\nThe immune system has two main components: a fast-acting innate system, which\ndestroys invading pathogens indiscriminately, and a more-precise adaptive\nimmune system, whose components learn to recognize specific foreign bacteria\nand viruses and generate antibodies against them.\n\nThe HS cells in the bone marrow spawn the immune cells of both arms of the\nsystem. They differentiate into two main classes \u2014 lymphoid and myeloid \u2014\nwhich go on to differentiate further. Lymphoid cells are mostly responsible\nfor adaptive immunity, and include: B cells, which produce antibodies; T\ncells, which help to attack invaders and orchestrate complex immune responses;\nand natural killer cells, which destroy infected cells. Myeloid cells include\na raft of cell types involved mostly in innate immunity.\n\nOne of the earliest changes in the immune system as people age is the\nshrinking of the thymus, which begins after puberty. This organ is the\ncrucible for T cells, but a lot of the tissue has turned to fat by the time\npeople hit their 30s, slashing the production of new T cells and diminishing\nthe power of the immune system. What\u2019s more, the function of T cells alters as\nthey age and become less specialized in their ability to recognize infectious\nagents.\n\nThe proportions of different types of immune cell circulating in the blood\nalso changes. The ratio of myeloid to lymphoid cells skews markedly towards\nmyeloid cells, which can drive inflammation. Moreover, increasing numbers of\nimmune cells become senescent, meaning that they stop replicating but don\u2019t\ndie.\n\nAny cell in the body can become senescent, typically when damaged by a\nmutation. Once in this state, cells start to secrete inflammatory signals,\nflagging themselves for destruction. This is an important anticancer and\nwound-healing mechanism that works well in youth. But when too much damage\naccumulates with ageing \u2014 and immune cells themselves also become senescent \u2014\nthe mechanism breaks down. Senescent immune cells, attracted by the\ninflammatory signals from senescent tissue, secrete their own inflammatory\nmolecules. So not only do they fail to clean up properly, but they also add to\nthe inflammation that damages surrounding healthy tissue. The phenomenon is\nknown as \u2018inflammaging\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt becomes a terrible positive feedback \u2014 a never-ending dance of\ndestruction,\u201d says immunologist Arne Akbar at University College London.\n\nAnd evidence suggests that this feedback loop is kicked off by the immune\nsystem. In a series of experiments in mice^4, Laura Niedernhofer at the\nUniversity of Minnesota in Minneapolis has shown that immune-cell senescence\nactually drives senescence in other tissues. \u201cThese cells are extremely\ndangerous,\u201d she says.\n\nHer team used genetic methods to eliminate an important DNA-repair enzyme in\nthe immune system of the mice. The animals remained healthy until adulthood\nbut then, unable to correct accumulating mutations, various types of immune\ncell started to become senescent.\n\nA few months later, increasing numbers of cells in organs such as the liver\nand kidney also fell into senescence, and the organs showed signs of damage.\nThese effects were all reversed when the scientists gave the mice immune cells\nfrom the spleens of young, healthy mice.\n\nAll of this suggests that fixing the characteristics of immune-system ageing\ncould help to prevent or mitigate diseases of ageing, says Niedernhofer.\n\n## Battling senescence\n\nMany scientists are trying to do just that, from very different angles. Lots\nof the approaches hint that very short treatments of the immune system might\nhave long-term effects, keeping side effects to a more manageable minimum.\n\nOne approach is to tackle senescent immune cells head on, using drugs to\neither remove them or block the inflammatory factors they secrete. \u201cSenescent\nimmune cells have long been known to be very modifiable in humans,\u201d says\nNiedernhofer. \u201cThey go up if you smoke and down if you exercise.\u201d\n\nAre your organs ageing well? The blood holds clues\n\nSome drugs \u2014 such as dasatinib, which is approved for the treatment of some\ncancers, and quercetin, which is marketed as an antioxidant dietary supplement\nbut not approved as a drug \u2014 are known to reduce the age-related acceleration\nof senescence, and dozens of clinical trials are testing their impact on\nvarious age-related diseases. Niedernhofer herself is involved in a small\nclinical trial on older people with sepsis, a condition that becomes more\ndeadly with age.\n\nHer team is also doing experiments to assess which of the many types of immune\ncell is the most important in driving senescence in the body, which should\nhelp in the design of more precise therapies. Two types \u2014 T cells and natural\nkiller cells \u2014 are emerging as key contenders, she says. She plans to screen\nnatural products and drugs already approved for use by the US Food and Drug\nAdministration for their ability to interact with those types of immune cell\nin senescence.\n\nAkbar thinks that targeting inflammation itself might be as effective as\ntargeting the senescent cells. He and his colleagues did a study in healthy\nvolunteers using the investigational compound losmapimod, which blocks an\nenzyme involved in the production of inflammatory molecules called cytokines.\nThey treated the volunteers with the drug for four days, and then, over the\ncourse of a week, measured their skin responses to an injection of the virus\nthat causes chickenpox. Most people are exposed to this virus during their\nlives and it frequently lingers in the body. But with age, people tend to lose\ntheir immunity to it, and it can then manifest as shingles. The drug restored\nthe immune response in the skin in older volunteers to a level similar to that\nseen in the younger volunteers^5. In unpublished work, Akbar has found the\nsame robust skin results up to three months later.\n\n\u201cTemporarily blocking inflammation in this way to allow the immune system to\nfunction might similarly boost the response of older patients to flu\nvaccinations,\u201d says Akbar.\n\n## Immune boost\n\nThe value of priming the aged immune system before administering a vaccine has\nbeen demonstrated in a series of clinical trials led by researcher Joan\nMannick, chief executive of Tornado Therapeutics, which is headquartered in\nBoston, Massachusetts. Those trials tested analogues of the drug rapamycin and\nother drugs with similar mechanisms, which target the immune system and are\napproved for prevention of organ transplant rejection and for the treatment of\nsome cancers. The drugs block an enzyme, called mTOR, that is crucial for many\nphysiological functions and which becomes dysregulated in old age.\n\nFor several weeks before receiving their influenza vaccinations, trial\nparticipants were treated with doses of the drugs that were low enough to\navoid side effects. This treatment regimen improved their responses to the\nvaccine, and boosted the ability of their immune systems to resist viral\ninfections in general.\n\nBut rapamycin can raise susceptibility to infection and affect metabolism, so\nMannick is planning trials with similar drugs that might have a safer profile.\n\u201cBut there are all sorts of different ways to try to improve the immune\nsystem,\u201d she notes.\n\nOne other way is to try to restore the function of the thymus to maintain the\nproduction of new T cells. Immunologist Jarrod Dudakov at the Fred Hutchinson\nCancer Center in Seattle, Washington, is researching the basic biology of\nthymus cells to try to work out how they regenerate themselves after stressful\nassaults. \u201cIt\u2019s all a bit early to see how this understanding will translate\ninto the clinic,\u201d he says. But he thinks that maintaining the ability of the\nthymus to generate a broad repertoire of T cells will be \u201cfoundational\u201d.\n\nOthers are trying to combat ageing by generating thymic tissue from\npluripotent stem cells for eventual transplantation. But Greg Fahy, chief\nscientific officer at Intervene Immune in Torrance, California, says he sees\nno need to wait for these long-term prospects to come to fruition, because an\navailable drug \u2014 synthetic growth hormone \u2014 is already known to regenerate\nthymus tissue. He is doing a series of small studies on healthy volunteers\nusing growth hormone as part of a cocktail of compounds. Early results\nindicate that the participants show increased levels of functional thymic\ntissue, and that their epigenetic clock \u2014 a biomarker of ageing \u2014 reverses by\na couple of years^6. Fahy is now extending the trial to look at whether the\ndrug cocktail also improves physical fitness in a larger group of volunteers.\n\n## Turn back time\n\nAnother approach, not yet in the clinic, is to partially reprogram immune\ncells, to try to turn back the clock in cells that have become senescent. This\ninvolves transiently exposing the cells in a dish to a cocktail of\ntranscription factors known to induce a pluripotent state in adult cells.\n\nReversal of biological clock restores vision in old mice\n\nSebastiano and his colleagues have shown in human cells that this process\ncorrects the epigenetic changes that occur with ageing^7. He has co-founded a\nstart-up company to use the technique to try to counteract a problem in a\ncancer therapy known as CAR T, in which T cells are engineered outside the\nbody to target and destroy a person\u2019s cancer. But the T cells can turn\nsenescent before they can be returned to the person. Rejuvenating them during\nthe generation process would make production quicker and more robust, says\nSebastiano.\n\nFlorian\u2019s approach, too, aims to produce healthier immune cells \u2014 inside the\nbody^1^,^2. HS cells in the blood rack up epigenetic changes, and their\nenvironment also changes as they age. This causes proteins in the cells to\narrange themselves more symmetrically \u2014 a process known as polarization \u2014\nwhich shifts the balance of stem-cell differentiation in favour of myeloid\ncells over lymphoid cells. Florian\u2019s studies used a four-day treatment with a\ncompound, called CASIN, that inhibits one part of this process to correct the\npolarization, and helped the mice to live longer.\n\nThe team saw the same life-extending effects when HS cells from old mice given\nCASIN were transplanted into old mice that hadn\u2019t received the treatment.\n\u201cThis very small step had a large impact,\u201d says Florian.\n\nFlorian next hopes to bring her work to the clinic. As a first case study, she\nthinks her drug might support regeneration of the immune system after people\nreceive chemotherapy for cancer.\n\n## How old?\n\nResearch on immune ageing faces some fundamental challenges. One is shared\nwith ageing studies in all organs \u2014 the inability to measure ageing precisely.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know in a quantitative, measurable, predictive way what ageing means\nat the molecular level in different cell types,\u201d says Sebastiano. \u201cWithout\nthose benchmarks, it is very hard to show rejuvenation.\u201d Last year, a\nconsortium of academics got together to begin developing a consensus on\nbiomarkers of ageing \u2014 which will be essential when scientists come to seek\napproval from regulatory agencies for anti-ageing therapies.\n\nAnother challenge is the difficulty in pinning down what makes one immune cell\nunique. Until recently, it has been hard to demonstrate which subtypes of\nimmune cells live where, and how they change with time.\n\nBut technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing, which quantitatively\nmeasures the genes being expressed in individual cells, have tightened up\nanalysis. A large study of immune cells in the blood of mice and humans across\na range of ages published last November, for example, revealed 55\nsubpopulations. Just twelve of those changed with age^8.\n\nWith so many strands of research coming together, scientists are cautiously\nhopeful that the immune system will indeed prove to be a key lever in healthy\nageing. Don\u2019t expect an elixir of youth any time soon, says Florian \u2014 by\ndefinition, ageing research takes a long time. \u201cBut there is such great\npotential for translation.\u201d\n\nNature 629, 276-278 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01274-3\n\n## References\n\n  1.
