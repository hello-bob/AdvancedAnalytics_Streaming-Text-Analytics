We split the problem of\n> \"aligning to human values\" into three parts: first, eliciting values from\n> people; second, reconciling those values into an alignment target for\n> training ML models; and third, actually training the model. In this paper,\n> we focus on the first two parts, and ask the question: what are \"good\" ways\n> to synthesize diverse human inputs about values into a target for aligning\n> language models? To answer this question, we first define a set of 6\n> criteria that we believe must be satisfied for an alignment target to shape\n> model behavior in accordance with human values. We then propose a process\n> for eliciting and reconciling values called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE),\n> which uses a large language model to interview participants about their\n> values in particular contexts; our approach is inspired by the philosophy of\n> values advanced by Taylor (1977), Chang (2004), and others. We trial MGE\n> with a representative sample of 500 Americans, on 3 intentionally divisive\n> prompts (e.g. advice about abortion). Our results demonstrate that MGE is\n> promising for improving model alignment across all 6 criteria. For example,\n> almost all participants (89.1%) felt well represented by the process, and\n> (89%) thought the final moral graph was fair, even if their value wasn't\n> voted as the wisest. Our process often results in \"expert\" values (e.g.\n> values from women who have solicited abortion advice) rising to the top of\n> the moral graph, without defining who is considered an expert in advance.\n\nSubjects:| Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Machine\nLearning (cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.10636 [cs.CY]  \n(or arXiv:2404.10636v1 [cs.CY] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Ryan Lowe T.
