Until\nvery recently, it was my preferred grocery store; though Amazon is not a force\nfor good in the world, I\u2019m not sure if I can be convinced that Albertson\u2019s,\nKroger, or Walmart are any less evil, and Amazon had a big edge on their\ncompetitors: Just Walk Out. Amazon\u2019s prices aren\u2019t much better than other\ngrocery stores, and their selection is decidedly inferior, and their produce\nis frequently sad (don\u2019t store potatoes under sun lamps, what the hell is\nwrong with you), but Just Walk Out was the killer feature that nobody else\nhad.\n\nFrom this end-user\u2019s perspective, Just Walk Out was magical. I used to be able\nto grab a cart, arrange my bags in it, fill them up, and leave. A few hours\nlater, Amazon sent me a bill. What I especially liked was being able to bag as\nI go; this allowed me to have dedicated bags for meat, produce, dry goods,\nnon-food items, and so on \u2014 this made unloading things when I got home so much\neasier.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t magic on the backend. If you ever looked up at the\nceiling while in the store, you would notice a grid containing a mind-blowing\nnumber of cameras, spaced 3 feet or so apart from each other. These cameras\nrecorded your every move through the store, through multiple angles. When you\nleft the store, this footage was combined with data collected through a\nnetwork of sensors on the shelves and sent to a human working in India to\nreview and ring you up. A lot of people seemed surprised to learn it wasn\u2019t\npowered by AI, but it was always obvious to me that there was still a human in\nthe loop, given the several-hour delay between leaving the store and receiving\nyour receipt.\n\nSadly, the magic is now gone; Amazon decided that these humans cost too much\nand took too long to do their jobs, so they killed the Just Walk Out program\nin their stores. In its place, they now offer the Dash Cart.\n\nUsing the Dash Cart is a truly wretched experience. After about 5 minutes with\nit, I missed Just Walk Out so badly that I put everything back on the shelf,\nlogged out of the cart, and just walked out of the store, never to return\nagain.\n\nThe cart is unlike any other grocery cart you\u2019ve used, in a bad way. It is\nessentially a large rigid plastic bin on wheels. It features a comically large\ngrey box housing a touch screen and a sensor package above the handle, where\nthe child seat would normally be, which extends over a good portion of the\ncart. If you\u2019re shopping with a young child that can\u2019t walk on their own for\nthe entire trip, well, no, you\u2019re not; not with this cart, anyway. If, like\nme, you frequently used this space for delicate produce and squishable items\nlike bread and chips, a small auxiliary bin is provided underneath the sensor\npackage, but it doesn\u2019t have enough clearance to hold a bag standing upright.\n\nUnlike the carts currently on display on Amazon\u2019s PR website, the cart I used\ndidn\u2019t have any sort of venting on any of the bins or on the lower level.\nInstead, they were just solid plastic. This means that any fluids that leak or\nare spilled in the cart over the course of its use are there forever, until it\nis hosed out. If one was left outside in the rain, it would fill up with\nwater.\n\nAfter I logged into the cart (by using a hidden unlabeled scanner on the\nunderside of the cart that the attendant had to show me,) the screen\ninstructed me that it was a good time to load my own bags into the cart, if I\nhad brought any. I dutifully started arranging my bags in the cart; it gave me\nseemingly about 30 seconds to do so before it started screaming at me and\ndemanding to know what I had removed from the cart. After a couple of attempts\nat appeasing it, I started to ignore its complaints and went about finishing\narranging my bags. Keep in mind that this was in the vestibule of the store; I\nhadn\u2019t even gotten within reach of any merchandise yet.\n\nOnce I had my bags in place, I was seemingly able to negotiate some sort of\npeace with the screen by reassuring it that I hadn\u2019t removed anything.\nUnfortunately, this peace was short-lived; any time the cart was jostled (by,\nsay, pushing it around the store,) it would again demand to know what had been\nremoved. It asked me what I had removed from the cart at least three more\ntimes as I made my way from the vestibule to the produce section.\n\nI got as far as the cooler containing grapes and strawberries, selected a\ncarton of strawberries, and put it into my produce bag in the cart. The cart\nbeeped at me. \u201cWhoops,\u201d I thought, \u201cI forgot, I have to scan things now.\u201d I\nremoved the strawberries from the bag, found the barcode, and held it up to\none of the two large openings in the sensor package that presumably contained\ncameras. It scanned the barcode and added the strawberries to my receipt.\nSuccess! \u201cWell, this is less convenient but I can make it work,\u201d I thought.\n\nI then selected a bag of grapes. I found the (clearly legible, undamaged)\nbarcode on the grapes and held it up to the cameras; the cart made a positive\nsounding noise, so I put the grapes into the produce bag. I went to move on to\nmy next objective, but then the cart indicated that it did not recognize the\nitem I had put in the cart.\n\nFolks, I tried to scan the bag of grapes no less than six different times.\nEach time that I did, the cart would make a positive sounding noise, as if it\nhad recognized the item, and then pop up the screen indicating it had not a\nfew seconds later, after I had put the grapes back into the bag. This was a\nparticularly shitty experience because the screen is angled in a way that it\nis not visible unless you are standing in the back of the cart, but the sensor\npackage is too large to be convenient to reach over; you have to scan and load\neach item from the front or side of the cart, and then walk around to the back\nto be able to see if it worked.\n\nAt this point I decided the whole endeavor was untenable. I was shopping for a\nweek\u2019s worth of groceries for my family and had about 70 items on my list, and\nI came to the conclusion that repeating this song and dance 69 more times\nwould not be very nice at all. I put the strawberries back, logged out of the\ncart, took my bags back to the car, and drove over to the local incarnation of\nKroger, where I was able to complete my shopping without having to deal with\nany testy machines. Now that Just Walk Out is gone, there is no reason\nwhatsoever for me to choose Amazon over any of their competitors for\ngroceries, and many reasons not to, like that shelf full of green potatoes.\n\nIn short, the experience of using the Dash Cart is very similar to using one\nof those early self-checkout machines (UNEXPECTED ITEM IN BAGGING AREA) except\nthat you push the machine around with you in the store and it harasses you the\nentire time that you\u2019re shopping. It should be embarrassing to Amazon that\nthese things can\u2019t reliably scan a bag of grapes with a sensor package larger\nthan many \u201cself-driving\u201d vehicles. The only good thing about these carts is\nthat they\u2019re so poorly designed that they surely won\u2019t last. If rain, cars,\nand the rough-and-tumble life of a grocery cart in a parking lot don\u2019t do them\nall in by the end of summer, a Chicago winter will surely finish the rest of\nthem off.\n\nPosted on May 2, 2024, 2:43 PM UTC\n\nLast updated on May 2, 2024, 3:01 PM UTC\n\namazon groceries shopping weblogpomo2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
