(CC BY Brookhaven National\nLaboratory)\n\nThe US Department of Energy has given the green light for the next stage of\nthe Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Known as \u201ccritical decision 3A\u201d, the move\nallows officials to purchase \u201clong-lead procurements\u201d such as equipment,\nservices and materials before assembling the collider can begin.\n\nThe EIC, costing between $1.7bn and $2.8bn, will be built at Brookhaven\nNational Laboratory in Long Island, New York. This will involve the lab\nrevamping its existing 3.8 km-long Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider accelerator\ncomplex that collides heavy nuclei such as gold and copper to produce a\nquark\u2013gluon plasma.\n\nA major part of the upgrade will involve adding an electron ring so that the\nEIC consists of two intersecting accelerators \u2013 one producing an intense beam\nof electrons and the other a high-energy beam of protons or heavier atomic\nnuclei.\n\nEach high-luminosity beam will be steered into head-on collisions with the\nparticles produced providing clues to the internal nature of protons and their\ncomponents.\n\n\u201cPassing this milestone and getting these procurements under way will help us\nachieve our ultimate goal of efficiently delivering a unique high-energy,\nhigh-luminosity polarized beam electron\u2013ion collider that will be one of the\nmost challenging and exciting accelerator complexes ever built,\u201d notes EIC\nproject director Jim Yeck. If there are no unforeseen construction delays,\nthen the first experiments are expected to begin in 2029 or 2030.\n\nRead more\n\n####\n\nBrookhaven chosen to host major US nuclear physics facility\n\nMeanwhile, the UK has said it will provide \u00a358.4m ($73.8) to develop new\ndetector and accelerator infrastructure for the EIC. The money comes as part\nof a \u00a3473m package of spending by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)\nInfrastructure Fund.\n\nThis money also includes \u00a3125m for a new diffraction and imaging electron\nmicroscopy facility at the Science and Technology Facilities Council\u2019s\nDaresbury Laboratory. The facility, known as Relativistic Ultrafast Electron\nDiffraction and Imaging, will be the world\u2019s most powerful microscope for\nimaging dynamics being able to study biological and chemical processes in\n\u201creal time\u201d at the femtosecond timescale.\n\nMichael Banks is news editor of Physics World magazine\n\n### CERN Courier\n\nReporting on international high-energy physics\n\nRead previous\n\n  * Quantum computing\n  * News\n\n#### Europe plans to build 100-qubit quantum computer by 2026\n\n## Discover more from Physics World\n\n    * Astronomy and space\n    * News\n\n### Battle for the skies: US insists GMT and TMT telescopes must vie for\nfunding\n\n    * Publishing\n    * Podcasts\n\n### Purpose-Led Publishing: Antonia Seymour outlines the role of not-for-\nprofit publishers\n\n    * Quantum\n    * Feature\n\n### Why you shouldn\u2019t be worried about talk of a \u2018quantum winter\u2019\n\n## Related jobs\n\n  * United Kingdom | BAE Systems Digital Intelligence\n\n#### Classified Networks Vulnerability and Protective Monitoring Liaison\nOfficer\n\n  * England | Institute of Physics\n\n#### Helping you train to teach physics\n\n  * Oakland | University of California Office of the President\n\n#### Program Officer, UC Research Initiatives\n\n## Related events\n\n  * Biophysics and bioengineering | Workshop Information Processing, Noise, and Adaptation in Living Systems 15\u201419 April 2024 | Dresden, Germany\n  * Quantum | Conference IQT The Hague 22\u201424 April 2024 | The Hague, Netherlands\n  * Biophysics and bioengineering | Workshop Interdisciplinary challenges in non-equilibrium physics: from soft to active, biological and complex matter (IntCha24) 22\u201426 April 2024 | Dresden, Germany\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by IOP Publishing Ltd and individual contributors\n\n#### Explore Physics World\n\n  * About us\n  * Our team\n  * Our portfolio\n  * Advertising\n  * Contact us\n  * Feedback\n  * Sign in\n  * Register\n\n#### MORE INFORMATION\n\n  * Institute of Physics\n  * Join the Institute\n  * Modern Slavery Act\n  * Privacy and Cookies\n  * IOP Publishing\n  * Copyright\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Disclaimer\n\n#### OUR MISSION\n\nPhysics World represents a key part of IOP Publishing's mission to communicate\nworld-class research and innovation to the widest possible audience.
