However, at the end of last year, the\ncybersecurity researcher and DPRK blogger stumbled across something new: signs\nNorth Koreans are working on major international TV shows.\n\nIn December, Roy discovered a misconfigured cloud server on a North Korean IP\naddress containing thousands of animation files. Included in the cache were\nanimation cells, videos, and notes discussing the work, plus changes that\nneeded to be made to ongoing projects. Some images appeared to be from an\nAmazon Prime Video superhero show and an upcoming Max (aka HBO Max) children\u2019s\nanime.\n\nThe findings and security lapse\u2014detailed in a report by the Stimson Center\nthink tank's North Korea\u2013focused 38 North Project, which helped analyze the\nfindings along with Google-owned security firm Mandiant\u2014provide a glimpse at\nhow North Korea can use skilled IT and tech workers to raise funds for its\nheavily sanctioned regime. It also comes as US officials increasingly warn\nabout North Korean IT workers infiltrating companies and their outsourcing.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s internet is a small\u2014and fragile\u2014space. The repressive nation\nonly has 1,024 IP addresses and around 30 websites that connect to the global\ninternet. While there is a limited internal intranet, only a few thousand of\nthe country\u2019s 26 million people can get on the internet. When they do, it\u2019s\nhighly controlled: These select few North Koreans can use the internet for an\nhour at a time and have a person sitting next to them approving their use\nevery five minutes.\n\nWhen Roy discovered the exposed cloud server, it was being updated on a daily\nbasis. Martyn Williams, a senior fellow on the 38 North Project who helped\nanalyze the contents of the server, says the server likely allowed work to be\nsent to and from North Korean animators. The server itself is still live, but\nit mysteriously stopped being used at the end of February. While there is a\nlogin page, its contents can be accessed without a username and password. \u201cI\nfound the login page after I found all the exposed files,\u201d Roy says.\n\nInside, the files contained editing comments and instructions in Chinese which\nwere translated to Korean, the researchers write in their report. \u201cFor a lot\nof the animation files, we would find things like spreadsheets with details of\nthe workflow,\u201d Williams says. A sample of the files shared with WIRED show\ndetailed anime images and video clips, with notes for the authors and date\nstamps on various files. In one instance, the report says, an animator was\n\u201casked to improve the shape of the character\u2019s head.\u201d\n\nBased on the documents and drawings, the researchers were able to identify\nsome of the shows and projects the North Koreans were working on. Some of the\nprojects included work from season 3 of the Amazon show Invincible, which is\nproduced by California-based Skybound Entertainment. There were also documents\nlinked to Max and Cartoon Network show Iyanu: Child of Wonder, produced by\nYouNeek Studios, as well as files from a Japanese anime series and an\nanimation studio in Japan.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nBoomergasms Are Booming\n\nJason Parham\n\n  * Security\n\nThe Biggest Deepfake Porn Website Is Now Blocked in the UK\n\nMatt Burgess\n\n  * Gear\n\nWhat Is 5G Home Internet?

There\nwere also files and projects the researchers could not identify\u2014including a\n\u201cbunch of files\u201d with videos of horses and a Russian book on horses, Williams\nsays.\n\nSanctions placed upon the North Korean regime, for its ongoing human rights\nabuses and nuclear warfare programs, prohibit US companies from working with\nDPRK companies or individuals. However, the researchers say it is highly\nunlikely that any companies involved would have a clue about North Korean\nanimators working on the shows, and there is nothing suggesting the companies\nviolated any sanctions or other laws. \u201cIt is likely that the contracting\narrangement was several steps downstream from the major producers,\u201d the report\nsays.\n\nSpokespeople for Amazon and Max spokesperson declined to comment for this\nstory. YouNeek Studios did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cWe do not work with North Korean companies, or Chinese companies on\nInvincible, or any affiliated entities, and have no knowledge of any North\nKorean or Chinese companies working on Invincible,\u201d a spokesperson for\nSkybound Entertainment says. \u201cWe take any claims very seriously and have\ncommenced an investigation into this.\u201d In a post on X, the company\ncharacterized the findings as \u201cunconfirmed\u201d and said it is working with\nauthorities to investigate.\n\nWilliams says it is possible that a front company in China is used to help\ndisguise the activity and involvement of North Koreans. The researchers were\nable to analyze connections to the exposed server and, despite most having\ntheir location masked by a VPN, spotted access from Spain and three Chinese\ncities. \u201cAll three cities are known to have many North Korean\u2013operated\nbusinesses and are main centers for North Korea\u2019s IT workers who live\noverseas,\u201d the report says.\n\nWhile Williams says the researchers did not find any identifiable names of\nNorth Korean organizations buried in the files, the country has a well-\nestablished animation company called April 26 Animation Studio, which is also\nknown as SEK Studio. Originally set up in the 1950s, the studio has worked on\nhundreds of international TV shows and movies.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the US Treasury Department has sanctioned SEK\nStudios, individuals linked to it, and various \u201cfront companies\u201d that it says\nare used to \u201cwork for foreign customers.\u201d Many of these have links to China,\naccording to the sanctions. \u201cSEK Studio has utilized an assortment of front\ncompanies to evade sanctions targeting the government of the DPRK and to\ndeceive international financial institutions,\u201d a statement issued as part of\nthe sanctions in 2021 says.\n\nThe main aim of these efforts, says Michael Barnhart, a North Korea researcher\nat Mandiant, is to raise money for the North Korean regime. The country\u2019s\nhackers and scammers have stolen and extorted billions of dollars to help fund\nits military ambitions in recent years, including from huge cryptocurrency\nheists. In early 2022, the FBI issued a 16-page alert warning companies that\nremote North Korean freelance IT workers were infiltrating businesses to earn\nmoney they could funnel back home.\n\n\u201cThe volume is much higher than we were expecting,\u201d Barnhart says of North\nKorea\u2019s IT workers. They are constantly changing their tactics to avoid being\ncaught, he says. \u201cWe had one not too long ago, where during the interview, the\nperson\u2019s mouth was just off-frame. You could tell that someone in the\nbackground was speaking on their behalf.\u201d Technically, Barnhart says,\ncompanies should verify their remote workers\u2019 devices and make sure that there\nis no remote software connecting to a company laptop or network. Businesses\nshould also put extra efforts at the hiring stage by training HR staff to\ndetect possible IT workers.\n\nHowever, he says, increasingly there is a greater crossover between North\nKorean IT workers and individuals who are members of known hacking groups or\nclassified as advanced persistent threats (APTs). \u201cThe more we focus on IT\nworkers, the more we\u2019re starting to see APT operators and efforts blending in\nwith those,\u201d he says. \u201cThis might be the most quick learning-on-your-feet,\nnimble nation-state that I've ever seen.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
