Weinstein's accusers could again be called to testify.\n\nA spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said it \"will do\neverything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our\ncommitment to survivors of sexual assault.\"\n\nDouglas H. Wigdor, an attorney who has represented eight Weinstein accusers,\nslammed the decision and said it \"is a major step back in holding those\naccountable for acts of sexual violence.\"\n\n\"Courts routinely admit evidence of other uncharged acts where they assist\njuries in understanding issues concerning the intent, modus operandi or scheme\nof the defendant,\" he said in a statement.\n\nWigdor said that overturning the conviction was \"tragic in that it will\nrequire the victims to endure yet another trial.\"\n\nJudge Madeline Singas, in a dissenting opinion, accused the majority of\n\"whitewashing the facts to conform to a he-said/she-said narrative\" and\nfailing to recognize that the jury was allowed to consider Weinstein's past\nassaults.\n\n### Recommended\n\nNBCBLK\n\n### NBCBLKHaiti Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigns as new government takes\nshape\n\nWorld\n\n### World'Europe could die,' France's Macron says as he calls for stronger\ndefense and economic reform\n\n\"This Court has continued a disturbing trend of overturning juries\u2019 guilty\nverdicts in cases involving sexual violence,\" Singas wrote.\n\nIn a separate dissenting opinion, Judge Anthony Cannataro said the decision\nwas an \u201cunfortunate step backwards.\"\n\nWeinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison\nfollowing his conviction on charges of criminal sex act for forcibly\nperforming oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and rape in\nthe third degree for an attack on an aspiring actor in 2013.\n\nThe charges came to light in 2017 following investigative reports published by\nThe New York Times and The New Yorker. His pattern of sexual abuse and lack of\naccountability helped fuel the #MeToo Movement.\n\nWeinstein also faced charges in Los Angeles and was convicted in 2022 of rape\nand sentenced to 16 years in prison. He was acquitted of a count of sexual\nbattery in that case.\n\nJuda Engelmayer, a spokesperson for Weinstein, said they are \u201cthrilled with\nthe court\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a long road ahead of us in California,\u201d Engelmayer said in\na statement to NBC News.\n\nThis is a developing story.
