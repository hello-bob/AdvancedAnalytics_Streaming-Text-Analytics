But Kagan is one of nearly 300 locals who sent a letter to officials\nahead of a protest Thursday against the installation of synthetic turf in what\nthey consider their shared backyard. They cited a growing body of research\nabout the presence of chemicals, microplastics and other harmful substances in\nthe turf and the risks those may present to human health and the environment.\n\nA group of Washington Heights residents are protesting plans to install\nsynthetic turf over a field in Bennett Park, April 3, 2024. Credit: Ben\nFractenberg/THE CITY\n\nArtificial turf has recently been the subject of scrutiny, as concern mounts\nnationwide around PFAS, or dangerous \u201cforever chemicals\u201d that don\u2019t break\ndown, accumulate in the body over time and are linked to a number of serious\nhealth issues. Boston in 2022 banned artificial turf because it can contain\nPFAS, and New Jersey\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection also raised\nconcerns about PFAS in artificial turf.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency last year set strict \u2014 near-zero \u2014 limits\non these forever chemicals in drinking water.\n\nBut Bennett Park, which sits at the highest natural point on Manhattan, is one\nof over 50 parks slated to get artificial turf over the next five years as\npart of upgrades the Parks Department is making. The agency currently manages\n275 artificial turf fields and play areas, totalling more than three times the\nsize of the Central Park Reservoir.\n\n\u201cWe follow all guidelines to ensure that we are using materials that are\ntested and approved by experts,\u201d Parks spokesperson Kelsey Jean-Baptiste said\nin a statement. \u201cSynthetic turf fields are highly durable, usable year-round,\nand able to accommodate a variety of sports and activities.\u201d\n\nStill, guidance from Mount Sinai recommends against installing artificial turf\nbecause of uncertainties around how safe the turf is and the potential\nexposure to chemicals and heat, as the turf can get extremely hot.\n\n\u201cWe know that artificial turf of all types contains chemicals that have been\nlinked to cancer, that may be harmful to the nervous system, that may harm the\nreproductive system,\u201d said Sarah Evans, a public health and environmental\nmedicine professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \u201cWe don\u2019t\nknow what the extent of exposure to children is when they play on those\nfields, so that is a very big emerging concern.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not yet data to say whether artificial turf is safe, Evans said. Her\ncolleague Homero Harari is leading a first-of-its-kind five-year study\nexamining how youth are exposed to different components of the synthetic turf\nfields.\n\nUntil there\u2019s more scientific evidence, some parents like Kagan prefer to take\na more cautious route \u2014 and would rather have dirt than turf.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to spend these years when my kid would actually be on the\nturf and the science is unclear and then it becomes clear \u2014 I don\u2019t want that\nto be something I regret,\u201d Kagan said. \u201cWe\u2019re making it clear to the Parks\nDepartment that this is not just an issue for our park and neighborhood, but\nsomething they should be considering citywide.\u201d\n\n## PFAS Problems\n\nArtificial turf is often made of plastic blades and a layer of \u201cinfill\u201d\nbetween those blades. The city in recent years has moved away from installing\nartificial turf that featured infill made from crumb rubber, which is\nmanufactured from used tires and can contain heavy metals and toxic chemicals.\n\nThe Parks Department will place turf made of tufted nylon carpet \u2014 without any\ninfill \u2014 at Bennett Park and other multipurpose areas. For sports fields, the\nagency opts for turf with infill made of coated sand. The Parks Department\nadmits that PFAS are detectable in the nylon turf it plans to install.\n\n## Sign up for THE SCOOP!\n\nGet the latest stories from THE CITY delivered to your inbox each morning.\nCancel anytime.\n\n\u201cHow can they in good conscience put this stuff down knowing there\u2019s PFAS in\nit?\u201d said Kyla Bennett, science policy director at the watchdog groupPublic\nEmployees for Environmental Responsibility and one of the researchers who\ndiscovered PFAS in turf in Massachusetts in 2019. \u201cIt boggles my mind.\nChildren will be exposed to this PFAS. These are carcinogens. What are they\nthinking?\u201d\n\nShe said children, who are still developing and thus more susceptible to the\nharmful effects of the chemicals, can be exposed through inhaling, ingesting\nand touching the chemicals. Abrasion of the turf can release the chemicals and\nmicroplastics from the surface, onto children and into the environment, she\nadded.\n\nThe Parks Department indicated it\u2019s working with manufacturers working to\nreduce or eliminate PFAS from the synthetic turf products. It soon will have\nto, as Gov. Kathy Hochul last year signed into law a bill that bans the sale\nof carpets \u2014 including artificial turf \u2014 that contain PFAS, by 2027.\n\nTenCate Americas, whose company installed the turf at Asphalt Green on the\nUpper East Side, emphasized that levels of PFAS in turf are low and the\ncompany has now \u201celiminated these trace amounts of non-soluble PFAS from our\nmanufacturing process,\u201d according to spokesperson Erica Rumpke.\n\nMitchell Silver, who was parks commissioner for more than 7 years under Mayor\nBill de Blasio, emphasized that he never encountered health problems with turf\nfields in his tenure.\n\n\u201cWe had, at the time I was commissioner, over 180 synthetic turf fields and we\ndidn\u2019t hear that people were expressing concern about cancer or any other\nchronic illnesses,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThe scientists may say one thing, but again,\nI need to know what field, what manufacturer, what are you hearing\nspecifically, are these just generic claims? Because our goal was to protect\npublic health, safety and welfare.\u201d\n\nBennett said the city should take a more precautionary stance.\n\n\u201cThe absence of evidence is not the same thing as the evidence of absence,\u201d\nshe said.\n\n## Plastic Over Grass\n\nStill, former Parks Department commissioners framed artificial turf as\nnecessary and requiring less maintenance for high intensity sports like\nsoccer, football and lacrosse. Grass fields become dirt fields with heavy use,\nthey said.\n\n\u201cPeople who think that you can have a large network of urban sports fields\ncomposed entirely of grass are living in La La Land,\u201d said Adrian Benepe, who\nserved as Parks commissioner for over a decade under Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\u201cThe only way you can have people play on grass over it is if you deny the use\nmost of the year.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s no comfort to some of the Washington Heights neighbors pushing against\nwhat they worry will be a short-sighted decision to put down turf.\n\nThe Parks Department posted improvement plans at Bennett Park in Washington\nHeights that included installing synthetic turf over a field, April 3, 2024.\nCredit: Ben Fractenberg/THE CITY\n\nMaggi Farmer, a lawyer who lives in the neighborhood, at first liked the idea\nof artificial turf at the park, though her almost 3-year-old son enjoyed\nplaying in what she called the \u201cdust bowl\u201d at Bennett.\n\n\u201cIt feels nice to sit on, there\u2019s no dirt, it makes places look clean,\u201d she\nsaid. But as she read up on artificial turf, she changed her mind. She said\nshe tries to reduce plastic in her life and worries about the effects of\nchemicals that could be in the synthetic turf.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most natural places we have \u2014 how can we just cover it\nwith a plastic carpet?\u201d she said.\n\nEm Asher, a decade-long resident of Washington Heights and the parent of a\ntoddler, said they\u2019d prefer the community tend to a natural green space,\ninstead of trashing the synthetic turf once it reaches the end of its\nlifespan.\n\n\u201cI know microplastics are ubiquitous, but to me that\u2019s an argument to regulate\ntheir use even more \u2014 not to use them when unnecessary,\u201d Asher said. \u201cI don\u2019t\nwant my child rubbing their face or rolling around on the plastic.\u201d\n\n### Related Headlines\n\nTHE CITY is an independent nonprofit newsroom dedicated to serving the people\nof New York.\n\nQuestions? info@thecity.nyc\n\n## Follow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * RSS Feed\n\n### ABOUT\n\n### TEAM\n\n### FUNDERS\n\n### ETHICS\n\n### DIVERSITY\n\n### DONATE\n\n### CONTACT\n\n### REPUBLISH\n\n### CAREERS\n\n## Subscribe to THE SCOOP\n\nSign up and get everything you need to know to be an active New Yorker\ndelivered to your inbox each morning.
