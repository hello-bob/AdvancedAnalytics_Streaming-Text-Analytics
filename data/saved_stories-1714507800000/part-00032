But China's done this before \u2013 Chang'e-6 was built as the backup\nto Chang'e-5, and the latter mission ended in triumph.\n\nThe lander is equipped with a drill and a scoop. Mission plans call for those\ntools to acquire around two kilograms of Moon stuff, which will be loaded into\nthe ascender. That craft will connect with the re-entry model to bring bits of\nLuna to Terra.\n\nThe mission is scheduled for 53 days from go to woah \u2013 30 days longer than\nChang'e-5\u2019s sortie \u2013 and will require retrograde orbits of the Moon.\n\n  * Forget everything you learned playing Lunar Lander: Chinese boffins reveal secrets of Chang'e 5 probe's touchdown\n  * Solar eclipse darkened skies, dampened internet traffic\n  * NASA taps trio of companies to build the next generation of lunar rover\n  * Japan's Moon lander makes it through another lunar night\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, China is also considering a Mars\nsample return mission. The Alibaba-owned Post last week reported that Wu\nWeiren, chief designer of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, told a\nconference that it plans to launch a craft called Tianwen-3 in 2030.\n\nThe mission plan calls for twin launches: one to carry a lander and ascent\nvehicle, and the other to haul an orbiter and return vehicle to Mars.\n\nThe most efficient round trips to Mars require over 500 days travel time, so\neven if China manages to launch Tianwen-3 in 2030 it would be several years\nbefore it returns with any red rocks.\n\nBut even a 2033 return would spank NASA, which \u2013 due to tech and funding woes\n\u2013 is struggling to design a sample return mission that would return to Earth\nby 2040.\n\nIf China is first to bring back a chunk of Mars, the moniker \"red planet\"\ncould take on a new meaning. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * China\n  * Mars\n  * Moon\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * China\n  * Mars\n  * Moon\n  * Space\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Artemis\n  * Asteroid\n  * Astronomy\n  * Black Hole\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * CSA\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Earth\n  * ESA\n  * Exomoon\n  * Exoplanet\n  * Galaxy\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * Hubble Space Telescope\n  * ISS\n  * James Webb Space Telescope\n  * JAXA\n  * JD.com\n  * NASA\n  * Roscosmos\n  * Satellite\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * Solar System\n  * Square Kilometre Array\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n\n#### More about\n\n5 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * China\n  * Mars\n  * Moon\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * China\n  * Mars\n  * Moon\n  * Space\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Artemis\n  * Asteroid\n  * Astronomy\n  * Black Hole\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * CSA\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Earth\n  * ESA\n  * Exomoon\n  * Exoplanet\n  * Galaxy\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * Hubble Space Telescope\n  * ISS\n  * James Webb Space Telescope\n  * JAXA\n  * JD.com\n  * NASA\n  * Roscosmos\n  * Satellite\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * Solar System\n  * Square Kilometre Array\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### NASA needs new ideas and tech to get Mars Sample Return mission off the\nground\n\nCurrent plans are too expensive and slow, meaning China could win race to\nscore red rocks\n\nScience14 days | 45\n\n#### Japan's Moon lander makes it through another lunar night\n\nWhat do we say to the God of Death?
