SanDisk\u2019s recent product line, the\nPro-Blade, aims to unify these different methods of data management for pro\nusers.\n\nDoes it deliver the performance necessary for 50+ megapixel raw files and 8K\nvideo? This review will give you the answers and help explain how the Pro-\nBlade System works\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## What is the Pro-Blade Ecosystem?\n\nPro-Blade is SanDisk\u2019s name for a line of products built around the \u201cMag\u201d SSD\ndrive. The Mag is a fast NVMe SSD with available storage options of 1 TB, 2\nTB, and 4 TB. The fundamental idea is that you can film directly onto the SSD\nMag, then connect it to an enclosure and use it as part of an SSD storage\nsystem (either portable or desktop-based). You can think of it as writing your\nfootage directly to the same SSD that you do your editing or backups on.\n\nYou\u2019ll need one of SanDisk\u2019s two enclosures if you get the Mag SSD. The\nsmaller \u201cTransport\u201d enclosure supports one Mag at a time and is useful for\nworking with the Mag SSD if you\u2019re on the go. Meanwhile, the larger \u201cStation\u201d\nenclosure supports up to four Mag SSDs at once and is used to plug the Mag\ninto your desktop workflow.\n\nThe Pro-Blade Family. From left to right: Station enclosure, Transport\nenclosure, Mag SSD.\n\nThe main selling point is that you can film directly to the Mag SSD, then\nquickly unplug it and attach it to one of your enclosures to see the footage\nimmediately. There\u2019s no need for the import step any more, and because of the\nultra-fast speeds of the Mag, it functions simultaneously as a recording\nmedium and a storage/editing medium. Most videographers will want to get\nmultiple SSD Mags in order to quickly swap them out and expand how much\nstorage they can carry on the go.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019ve been talking about filming and videography, but technically\nthe Mag SSD works with any compatible camera that can write over USB C. It\ncould be a good choice for dual photo/video shooters, too. However, I think\nit\u2019s overkill if all you do is photography, since very few photographers have\nthe need to attach a dedicated SSD to the camera to record images. As I see\nit, the biggest benefit of the Pro-Blade ecosystem is that you can simplify\nand speed up the process of capturing large volumes of data on the go.\n\n### 1\\. The SSD Mag\n\nThe Mag is an interesting bit of kit on its own. It\u2019s quite a compact SSD,\nalmost the exact dimensions of a typical NVMe drive, and very solidly built,\nwith a lightweight and durable aluminum housing. SanDisk rates it for 3m drops\nand 4000lb crush loads. While I didn\u2019t feel like running it over with my car,\nI\u2019m not surprised to see those ratings after handling it. On the bottom of the\nhousing, there\u2019s a spot for labeling the drive for identification, while the\nserial number is clearly marked.\n\nAs a tip, I recommend naming your external drives by the serial, as it can\nmake sorting and unplugging multiple drives a lot easier.\n\nHere comes the interesting part, as there\u2019s already a number of small and fast\nSSDs with metal housings available: the interface is not USB-C, micro USB, or\nanything else you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s a proprietary \u201cPro-Blade Interface.\u201d While\nI\u2019m not a huge fan of proprietary connectors, I was impressed by the\nmodularity, durability, and throughput of this one.\n\nThe connector is rated for 2,000+ cycles into the docks, and the performance\nof the Mag SSD is rated for 3,000+MB/s reads, although you\u2019ll need the larger\nStation to support these speeds. The connector features a number of pins in a\nsmall, almost recessed socket. Keeping this area clean is the only imaginable\nweak point in the otherwise very durable design. Consider storing these in a\ndedicated pouch or pocket if you\u2019re working in dusty conditions.\n\nAs shown throughout a number of other design decisions, SanDisk specifically\ntargeted this device at pro users, who need the full speed throughput for\nhours on end. Smaller devices with weaker interfaces or thermal management\nsetups, like those aforementioned portable SSDs, just couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\nRounding out the rest of the Mag\u2019s body is a small handle with some knurling\nand a fingernail slot, which is used for removing the drive from the Transport\nor Station housings.\n\n### 2\\. The Transport Housing\n\nThe Pro-Blade Transport acts as the interface, cooling, and dock for a single\nSSD Mag. One mag slots into the enclosure, docking with a very reassuring\nclick. On the other side of the housing is a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2\u00d72 20Gbps port\n(yes, USB-C naming is a complete mess). The takeaway is that the interface is\ncapable of doing 2000MB/s read and write to the drive, with the convenience of\nthe USB-C cable and port.\n\nThe rest of the housing has a very clean and modern design language, with\nprofessional branding and an area of exposed aluminum to act as a heat sink.\nThere\u2019s a small LED indicator next to the mag slot that indicates activity on\nthe drive, and it\u2019s bright enough to be visible at a distance, while not being\ndistracting.\n\nSliding the Mag SSD into the Transport housing\n\nThe overall size of the enclosure is reasonable, especially when you consider\nthat you can swap out the Mag SSD with any other Mag SSDs that you have. It\neffectively allows for unlimited storage on the go, depending on how many Mag\nSSDs you\u2019re carrying. Since there is no duplication of housings, cables, power\nsupplies, etc., I consider this a great solution when size and portability are\nimportant.\n\n### 3\\. The Station\n\nThe Station is the other way to connect Mag SSDs to your computer, and it\u2019s\ncapable of housing four of them at a time. The Station is to be targeted at\nthe most demanding workflows: think productions, large studios, and high\nthroughput users. Since the Mag SSD maxes out at 4 TB, the Station allows you\nto fit up to 16TB of capacity into a fairly small box, while making all that\ndata accessible at 3000+MB/s over Thunderbolt 3.\n\nThe Station is set to support active cooling and daisy chaining of Thunderbolt\n3 devices through the second port. All these features together make the\nStation a great offload point for larger productions, or as a really speedy\noption for storing a ton of footage in a small form factor as part of a\ndesktop workflow.\n\n## Performance\n\nThat sums up how each of the three components of the Pro-Blade System work,\nbut how do they perform?\n\nIn my experience, the Mag SSD performed excellently on both PC and Mac, with\nno problems connecting. For Mac testing, I used the 14 inch Macbook Pro with\nan M1 Pro chip. Windows testing was performed on an AMD 5950x on X570. Testing\nincluded both synthetic benchmarks from CrystalDiskMark and Blackmagic, as\nwell as real-world file transfer testing with a mix of raw photos and video\nfiles. With both computers, the drive was connected via USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 with\nSanDisk\u2019s supplied USB-C cable.\n\n### 1\\. CrystalDiskMark\n\nWhile sequential read and write operations are a bit of an overly ideal\ntesting metric, they can provide the first indication if a device isn\u2019t living\nup to its claims. There\u2019s no worries about that with the Pro-Blade Mag,\nhowever. When using the Transport housing, the combo was able to effectively\nsaturate the 10Gbps USB-C link at a queue depth of 8, and only dropped\nslightly at QD1. Even with the more punishing random 4KiB tests, the drive\nperformed well.\n\nThe SSD Mag combined with the Transport housing is the fastest USB SSD I\u2019ve\ntested. Performance in AmorphousDiskMark on Mac were similar, but note that\nthe random test is performed at a different queue depth, making the results\nbetween Windows and Mac not directly comparable for that test.\n\n### 2\\. Real-World Performance\n\nReal-world transfers from a 7000MB/s-capable host yielded speeds of around\n650MB/s. The test folder was about 10GB, and was made of a mix of PSD, DNG,\nand MOV files.\n\nIn testing with larger file transfers, including a single transfer of over\n150GB, the drive continued to perform at around 650MB/s, with no issues with\nheat. Impressively, this sustained performance showed no signs of an exhausted\nSLC cache or other SSD performance trickery like throttling.\n\n## Interface Awareness\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this review carefully, you might have noticed a discrepancy: a\nclaimed 2000MB/s performance figure for the Mag SSD, with both my synthetic\nand real-world testing capping out at around 1000MB/s. This difference comes\nfrom the choice of interface that SanDisk used with the Transport: USB-C 3.2\nGen 2 2\u00d72.\n\nReaching the 2000 MB/s performance rating of the Transport is only possible if\nyour computer supports these advanced ports, which is not the case even with\nmany high-performance computer setups. For example, Apple currently doesn\u2019t\nhave any products with USB-C Gen 2 2\u00d72 ports \u2013 if you need something faster\nthan USB-C 3.2, you need to use Apple\u2019s Thunderbolt connection, and the\nTransport lacks Thunderbolt support. You can see the problem!\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not the Mag SSDs that are capped around 1000 MB/s, it\u2019s\nthe computers. Since the Station housing is rated to an even higher 3000 MB/s\n(and does offer Thunderbolt connection), I\u2019m sure that the Mags are capable of\nhitting higher performance than what I could measure. Of course, whether you\nneed even higher performance depends on what sort of production you\u2019re\nrunning. For me, maxing out my computer\u2019s USB-C 3.2 port is plenty fast enough\nfor my needs!\n\n## Recommendations\n\nAs it stands, the Pro-Blade ecosystem is a very high-quality product with a\ngreat user experience. It\u2019s certainly built for professional use scenarios,\nfrom the industrial design to the performance considerations. The one\nexception is the lack of Thunderbolt support in the Transport housing, which\nlimits the real-world speeds to about 1000 MB/s rather than 2000 MB/s unless\nyour computer supports 3.2 2\u00d72.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Pro-Blade ecosystem is more expensive than getting\na simple backup/portable SSD \u2013 for example, SanDisk\u2019s own Extreme Portable SSD\nV2 offers similar levels of performance, at a cheaper price point, if your\nlaptop setup is already limited to 1000 MB/s anyway. The selling point of the\nPro-Blade ecosystem really is the ecosystem and the ability to swap multiple\nSSD mags quickly between your camera, your Transport housing, and your Station\nhousing, and to get those insane speeds with the Station housing when working\nfrom a desktop.\n\nAn alternative product in between the SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD and the\nPro-Blade ecosystem is the SanDisk Pro-G40. This device supports Thunderbolt\n3, so you\u2019ll get very high speeds if your computer is Thunderbolt-capable. The\nPro-G40 also has the same pro-level build quality as the Pro-Blade line, with\nan IP68 rating and durable crush and drop resistance. Of course, the Pro-G40\ndoesn\u2019t have the ability to swap from camera to Transport housing to Station\nhousing like the Pro-Blade ecosystem does.\n\nIn short, if you need an ultra-fast, portable, and swappable storage that\neliminates import times, the SanDisk Pro-Blade ecosystem is the way to go.\nBetween the durability, speed, and forward-facing 2\u00d72 capability, SanDisk has\ncreated portable storage that is built to last.\n\nYou can support our testing efforts at Photography Life by buying any of your\nequipment, not just this product, at the links to our B&H affiliate below:\n\n  * Mag SSDs\n  * Transport housing\n  * Station housing\n\nLet me know in the comments section below if you have any questions!\n\n### Related Articles\n\n  * SanDisk PRO-G40 SSD Review\n\n  * Exascend Explorer Portable SSD Review\n\n  * Samsung Portable SSD T1 Review\n\n  * Samsung PRO Plus SD Card Review\n\n  * Platypod Pro and Max Review - A Tripod Alternative\n\n  * AEO Photo Lightning Strike Pro Review\n\nDisclosures, Terms and Conditions and Support Options\n\nFiled Under: Videography Tagged With: Gear Reviews, SanDisk, Storage\n\n#### About Alex Coleman\n\nI'm Alex Coleman, a commercial and travel photographer in Arizona.

Did that ever get sorted out?\n\n1\n\nReply\n\nFiatlux\n\nFebruary 25, 2024 11:59 pm\n\nNote that there\u2019s a good reason for the transport housing to not support\nThunderbolt : USB-only hosts (such as cameras) do not support Thunderbolt\ndevices. Ideally, you\u2019d have two versions: a USB housing to use on the camera\nand a Thunderbolt one to use on a laptop when on the go.\n\n1\n\nReply\n\n#### Learn\n\n  * Beginner Photography\n  * Landscape Photography\n  * Wildlife Photography\n  * Portraiture\n  * Post-Processing\n  * Advanced Tutorials\n\n#### Reviews\n\n  * Camera Reviews\n  * Lens Reviews\n  * Other Gear Reviews\n  * Best Cameras and Lenses\n\n#### Photography Tutorials\n\nPhotography Basics\n\nLandscape Photography\n\nWildlife Photography\n\nMacro Photography\n\nComposition & Creativity\n\nBlack & White Photography\n\nNight Sky Photography\n\nPortrait Photography\n\nStreet Photography\n\nPhotography Videos\n\n#### Unique Gift Ideas\n\n#### Subscribe via Email\n\nIf you like our content, you can subscribe to our newsletter to receive weekly\nemail updates using the link below:\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n#### Site Menu\n\n  * About Us\n  * Beginner Photography\n  * Lens Database\n  * Lens Index\n  * Photo Spots\n  * Search\n  * Forum\n\n#### Reviews\n\n  * Reviews Archive\n  * Camera Reviews\n  * Lens Reviews\n  * Other Gear Reviews\n\n#### More\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * Subscribe\n  * Workshops\n  * Support Us\n  * Submit Content\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 \u00b7 Photography Life\n\n", "frontpage": false}
