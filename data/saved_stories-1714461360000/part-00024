In February 2020, the FCC put all four wireless\nproviders on notice that their practices of sharing access to customer\nlocation data were likely violating the law.\n\nThe FCC said it found the carriers each sold access to its customers\u2019 location\ninformation to \u2018aggregators,\u2019 who then resold access to the information to\nthird-party location-based service providers.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, each carrier attempted to offload its obligations to obtain\ncustomer consent onto downstream recipients of location information, which in\nmany instances meant that no valid customer consent was obtained,\u201d an FCC\nstatement on the action reads. \u201cThis initial failure was compounded when,\nafter becoming aware that their safeguards were ineffective, the carriers\ncontinued to sell access to location information without taking reasonable\nmeasures to protect it from unauthorized access.\u201d\n\nThe FCC\u2019s findings against AT&T, for example, show that AT&T sold customer\nlocation data directly or indirectly to at least 88 third-party entities. The\nFCC found Verizon sold access to customer location data (indirectly or\ndirectly) to 67 third-party entities. Location data for Sprint customers found\nits way to 86 third-party entities, and to 75 third-parties in the case of\nT-Mobile customers.\n\nThe commission said it took action in response to a May 2018 story broken by\nThe New York Times, which exposed how a company called Securus Technologies\nhad been selling location data on customers of virtually any major mobile\nprovider to law enforcement officials.\n\nThat same month, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that LocationSmart \u2014 a data\naggregation firm working with the major wireless carriers \u2014 had a free,\nunsecured demo of its service online that anyone could abuse to find the near-\nexact location of virtually any mobile phone in North America.\n\nThe carriers promised to \u201cwind down\u201d location data sharing agreements with\nthird-party companies. But in 2019, reporting at Vice.com showed that little\nhad changed, detailing how reporters were able to locate a test phone after\npaying $300 to a bounty hunter who simply bought the data through a little-\nknown third-party service.\n\nThe FCC fined Sprint and T-Mobile $12 million and $80 million respectively.\nAT&T was fined more than $57 million, while Verizon received a $47 million\npenalty. Still, these fines represent a tiny fraction of each carrier\u2019s annual\nrevenues. For example, $47 million is less than one percent of Verizon\u2019s total\nwireless service revenue in 2023, which was nearly $77 billion.\n\nThe fine amounts vary because they were calculated based in part on the number\nof days that the carriers continued sharing customer location data after being\nnotified that doing so was illegal (the agency also considered the number of\nactive third-party location data sharing agreements). The FCC notes that AT&T\nand Verizon each took more than 320 days from the publication of the Times\nstory to wind down their data sharing agreements; T-Mobile took 275 days;\nSprint kept sharing customer location data for 386 days.\n\nThis entry was posted on Monday 29th of April 2024 04:56 PM\n\nNe'er-Do-Well News\n\nAT&T LocationSmart Securus Technologies Sprint T-Mobile U.S. Federal\nCommunications Commission Verizon\n\n## 6 thoughts on \u201cFCC Fines Major U.S. Wireless Carriers for Selling Customer\nLocation Data\u201d\n\n  1. LarryF April 29, 2024\n\nA quick calculation shows that this cost the violators in aggregate about 62\u00a2\nper customer. That really sends a message, but not a good one. $100 per\ncustomer would be a good starting point. It has to be more than the profit of\nselling location data.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n    1. Billy Jack April 29, 2024\n\nExcellent observation.\n\nIf the fine is less than the profits made, then the fine is nothing more than\na cost of doing business.\n\nAt the very least, it ought to be some low multiple of the prices charged.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  2. Norm April 29, 2024\n\nWow. Their wrists mus smart something awful.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  3. l0calh0st April 29, 2024\n\nThat\u2019s not a fine, that\u2019s a cost of doing business. A fine must be\nprohibitively expensive.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  4. Denbub2542 April 29, 2024\n\nWhen will companies actually be fined a huge amount for illegal sharing of\ncustomer data and individual sys admins be held accountable on a personal\nlevel for breaches for for lack of cyber due diligence. Tired of a 1 year\ncredit monitoring and pittance for class action monetary compensation. I want\nreal change.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  5. Mike April 29, 2024\n\nWhat about the companies that resell/piggyback on the major carriers, e.g.,\nTimeWarner/Spectrum Mobile that uses Verizon?\n\nHave they been selling location data too? Or was that done by Verizon since it\nwas their cell towers/system carrying the calls?\n\nReply \u2192\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMailing List\n\nSubscribe here\n\nSearch KrebsOnSecurity\n\nRecent Posts\n\n  * FCC Fines Major U.S. Wireless Carriers for Selling Customer Location Data\n  * Russian FSB Counterintelligence Chief Gets 9 Years in Cybercrime Bribery Scheme\n  * Who Stole 3.6M Tax Records from South Carolina?\n  * Crickets from Chirp Systems in Smart Lock Key Leak\n  * Why CISA is Warning CISOs About a Breach at Sisense\n\nStory Categories\n\n  * A Little Sunshine\n  * All About Skimmers\n  * Ashley Madison breach\n  * Breadcrumbs\n  * Data Breaches\n  * DDoS-for-Hire\n  * Employment Fraud\n  * How to Break Into Security\n  * Internet of Things (IoT)\n  * Latest Warnings\n  * Ne'er-Do-Well News\n  * Other\n  * Pharma Wars\n  * Ransomware\n  * Russia's War on Ukraine\n  * Security Tools\n  * SIM Swapping\n  * Spam Nation\n  * Target: Small Businesses\n  * Tax Refund Fraud\n  * The Coming Storm\n  * Time to Patch\n  * Web Fraud 2.0\n\nWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia\n\n\u00a9 Krebs on Security - Mastodon\n\n", "frontpage": true}
