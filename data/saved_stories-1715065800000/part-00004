The designation is ProPublica\u2019s 17th Pulitzer finalist in 16 years.\n\nProPublica\u2019s \u201cFriends of the Court\u201d series uncovered the biggest ethics\nscandal to hit the Supreme Court in the modern era. Reporters Justin Elliott,\nJoshua Kaplan, Alex Mierjeski, Brett Murphy and Kirsten Berg pierced decades\nof judicial secrecy and uncovered major gifts to justices from a small set of\npolitically influential donors.\n\nThe series began a national conversation about ethics and judicial reform of\nthe Supreme Court. In response to ProPublica\u2019s reporting, the court announced\nin November that it had unanimously adopted the first ethics code in its\n234-year history. Justice Clarence Thomas for the first time acknowledged that\nhe should have reported selling real estate to billionaire Harlan Crow in\n2014, writing in his annual financial disclosure form that he \u201cinadvertently\nfailed to realize\u201d that the deal needed to be disclosed. Thomas also disclosed\nreceiving three private jet trips from Crow, two of which ProPublica had\nalready reported. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted to authorize subpoenas\nof Crow and conservative legal activist Leonard Leo as part of its ongoing\neffort to investigate ethics lapses by justices.\n\nIn the series honored as a Pulitzer finalist in explanatory reporting, the\nTribune, ProPublica and FRONTLINE used a trove of unreleased investigative\nfiles to produce a startling and exhaustive investigation of the Uvalde\nshooting, which included a documentary. It revealed what no one else had:\nStates across the country are providing devastatingly insufficient training\nfor law enforcement to confront a mass shooter, leaving critical and long-\noverlooked gaps in preparedness between children and the officers expected to\nprotect them. The series involved the work of Lomi Kriel, Lexi Churchill,\nPerla Trevizo and Jessica Priest for ProPublica and the Tribune; Jinitzail\nHern\u00e1ndez and Zach Despart for the Tribune; and Juanita Ceballos, Michelle\nMizner and Lauren Prestileo for FRONTLINE.\n\nRead More\n\nFriends of the Court\n\n\u201cSomeone Tell Me What to Do\u201d\n\nAfter the news investigation, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland unveiled\nthe findings of a federal probe into the response. Garland pointed to missteps\nthat led to delays in confronting the shooter. Then he turned to what he said\nwas the biggest failure, one that required the most urgent action to avoid\nanother colossal breakdown such as the one that cost lives that day: the lack\nof sufficient active shooter training for law enforcement. Garland\u2019s comments\nvalidated the investigation\u2019s finding that there is an astounding dearth of\nsuch instruction around the country.\n\nProPublica received Pulitzer Prizes for national reporting in 2020, feature\nwriting in 2019, public service in 2017, explanatory reporting in 2016,\nnational reporting in 2011 and investigative reporting in 2010.
