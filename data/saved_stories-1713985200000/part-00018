However, tokenization imposes several\n> disadvantages, such as performance biases, increased adversarial\n> vulnerability, decreased character-level modeling performance, and increased\n> modeling complexity. To address these disadvantages without sacrificing\n> performance, we propose SpaceByte, a novel byte-level decoder architecture\n> that closes the performance gap between byte-level and subword\n> autoregressive language modeling. SpaceByte consists of a byte-level\n> Transformer model, but with extra larger transformer blocks inserted in the\n> middle of the layers. We find that performance is significantly improved by\n> applying these larger blocks only after certain bytes, such as space\n> characters, which typically denote word boundaries. Our experiments show\n> that for a fixed training and inference compute budget, SpaceByte\n> outperforms other byte-level architectures and roughly matches the\n> performance of tokenized Transformer architectures.\n\nComments:| 9+9 pages, 3+1 figures, 2+4 tables  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.14408 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.14408v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14408arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Kevin Slagle [view email] [v1] Mon, 22 Apr 2024 17:59:29 UTC (107 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled SpaceByte: Towards Deleting Tokenization from\nLarge Language Modeling, by Kevin Slagle\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
