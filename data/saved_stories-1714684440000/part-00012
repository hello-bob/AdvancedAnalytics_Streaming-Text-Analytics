Credit: NASA/Wikimedia Commons\n\nWestern disturbances describe a system of winds that bring snow and rainfall\nto northern India during winter months. They originate west of the Hindu Kush\nand the Himalaya mountains, sometimes as far away as the Mediterranean Sea,\nand are vital for ensuring water security across states in northern India.\n\nA new study published in the journal Weather and Climate Dynamics found a\nseasonal shift in western disturbances: They are now occurring more frequently\nin summer months, when they were once rare. Western disturbances have become\ntwice as common in June in the past 20 years than during the previous 50\nyears.\n\nTypically, western disturbances occur between December and March. That timing\nbenefits farmers and boosts water security, because the heavy precipitation\nrecharges mountain glaciers and snowpack that lose mass in the warmer summer\nmonths.\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\n\u201cWinter precipitation is important for livelihoods [in northern Indian\nHimalayan states] because it ensures water availability in the subsequent\nspring season,\u201d said A. P. Dimri, a climate scientist at Jawaharlal Nehru\nUniversity who was not affiliated with the study.\n\n> \u201cWe had anecdotal evidence of western disturbances interacting with the\n> monsoon, but now we have been able to show the trend.\u201d\n\nThe snow and ice associated with western disturbances melt in the spring,\nmaking up a large proportion of runoff in the Indus-Ganges river system\u2014an\nartery that provides water for irrigation, hydropower, and household use for\nthe roughly half a billion people living in its plains.\n\nBut 70 years of storm track data from a climate hindcast (European Centre for\nMedium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5; ERA5) show that the\nwestern disturbance season has gotten longer. It now stretches into May, June,\nand July, when the weather pattern can sometimes interact with the summer\nmonsoon, which begins in June. The result is worse flooding.\n\n\u201cIn the winter, the atmosphere is drier because it\u2019s colder. So western\ndisturbances have to draw their own water from the Arabian Sea, and typically,\nthey do not cause floods,\u201d said Kieran Hunt, the author of the study and a\nmeteorologist at the University of Reading. A lot of the precipitation falls\nas snow, which melts slowly through the spring. But an overlap between western\ndisturbances and monsoons\u2014which carry about 6\u20137 times more moisture\u2014can be\ncatastrophic.\n\n\u201cWe had anecdotal evidence of western disturbances interacting with the\nmonsoon, but now we have been able to show the trend [in shifting patterns]\nmore clearly,\u201d Hunt said. Flash floods in 2013 in the Himalayan state of\nUttarakhand claimed around 6,000 lives. They happened in June, when western\ndisturbances struck during the summer monsoon. The same happened in July 2023,\nleading to floods in many northern Indian states, including in the capital,\nNew Delhi.\n\nThe changing pattern of western disturbances is \u201cvery concerning,\u201d especially\nbecause it has the potential to result in weather extremes, said Rajib\nChattopadhyay, a meteorologist at the Indian Institute of Tropical\nMeteorology.\n\n### The Climate Link\n\nWestern disturbances are steered by the subtropical jet stream, a high-\naltitude air current.\n\nClimate change has altered the jet stream\u2019s movement: Polar regions have\nbecome warmer, reducing the temperature gradient between them and the tropical\nregions to the south. The force that used to draw the jet stream northward\nbefore the monsoon season is therefore weaker, extending the time storms pass\nover India.\n\n> \u201cWe need to give more attention to western disturbance forecasts.\u201d\n\nThe weakening temperature gradient also means that the jet stream is more\nsusceptible to local factors. One dominant local factor, according to Hunt, is\nthe rapid warming of the Tibetan Plateau. Studies have previously shown that\nthe region is warming at rates almost twice the global average. This makes the\nplateau warmer than surrounding regions, resulting in a temperature gradient\nthat strengthens the jet stream, intensifying western disturbances and making\nthem more frequent.\n\nAnother local factor, according to Hunt, may be the reduction in aerosols over\nnorthern India due to air pollution control measures, which has made the local\natmosphere warmer and the temperature gradient stronger, also strengthening\nthe jet stream.\n\n\u201cWe need to give more attention to western disturbance forecasts,\u201d\nChattopadhyay said, adding that \u201cit is useful to get some first-order outlook\non impending disasters of flash flood, cloudbursts, etc., during monsoon and\ncold wave or snowfall during other seasons.\u201d\n\n\u2014Rishika Pardikar (@rishpardikar), Science Writer\n\n2 May 2024: This article was updated to clarify water use in the basin.\n\n##### Citation: Pardikar, R.
