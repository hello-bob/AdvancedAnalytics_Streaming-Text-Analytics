The former CEO of\nthe Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) \u2014 the special purpose acquisition\ncompany that was created to purchase the Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 is\nsuing his successor for allegedly hacking his private accounts as part of a\n\u201ccoup d\u2019etat.\u201d The details are fairly messy. Patrick Orlando, the CEO of DWAC\nuntil March 2023, claims he was ousted by Eric Swider, a Trump Media board\nmember who was appointed CEO immediately after Orlando was fired. (Swider\nserved as CEO until March of this year.) Orlando filed the suit against Swider\nthrough the Benessere Investment Group, a company he controls, according to\nWired\u2019s report. After Orlando was fired, Swider enlisted his former personal\nassistant, Alexander Cano, to help him improperly gain access to Orlando\u2019s\naccounts, the suit claims. Cano allegedly accessed an electronic storage\naccount at Box.com tied to Benessere and ARC Global Investments II \u2014 a\nseparate fund Orlando organized that provided financing for the deal to\nacquire Truth Social \u2014 that contained the login information for Orlando\u2019s\nMailchimp and DocuSign accounts, as well as his confidential files. Cano\npassed the \u201cstolen information\u201d along to Swider, the suit claims. Per the\nsuit, Swider then used Orlando\u2019s Mailchimp account to email ARC II\u2019s investors\nabout the Truth Social deal after Orlando\u2019s firing. \u201cMr. Orlando\u2019s leadership\nhas guided our common interests with DWAC directly into the arms of the SEC,\nthe DOJ, lengthy delays and costly investigations,\u201d Swider wrote, according to\nWired. \u201cBy filing this lawsuit against DWAC, Mr. Orlando is destroying the\nvalue that may be realized upon consummation of the business combination by\nthe Company and its members.\u201d Swider also invited investors onto a series of\nZoom calls to \u201cunderstand our risk exposure based on leadership that continues\nto march us down a path of mis-information, hidden information, and self\ndealing.\u201d Orlando\u2019s tenure at DWAC was indeed a rocky one. The proposed Trump\nMedia-DWAC merger was delayed for years, due in part to probes by both the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and federal criminal investigators. Those\ndelays cost DWAC $100 million, CNBC reported in 2023. The Truth Social merger\nfinally went through in March of this year.\n\n  * 8x8\n\n6 days ago\n\nRheinmetall from Germany Secures Major Australian Contract for <b>8x8</b>\nboxer\n\nRheinmetall from Germany Secures Major Australian Contract for 8x8 boxer. ...\nFED 2013 Meeting - Forum Defence Industry \u00b7 FED ...

It would also enforce high security standards for government\ncollaboration tools, including end-to-end encryption. The Secure and\nInteroperable Government Collaboration Technology Act, a discussion draft\nshared exclusively with The Verge, would make it so that a government user on\nTeams, for example, would be able to talk to a colleague at a different agency\nusing Zoom.
