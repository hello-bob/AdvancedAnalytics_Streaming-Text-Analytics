Expressions are defined in Python, compiled into\nSQL, and run directly against your data warehouse.\n\nAnalyze retention funnels directly in your data warehouse without writing\ncumbersome SQL\n\nHashquery\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nfrom hashquery import attr\n\nfrom hashquery.demo import demo_project as project\n\n# Import data with cols \"timestamp\", \"user_id\", and \"event_type\"\n\nevents = project.models.events_model\n\n# Calculate funnel retention metrics\n\nfunnel = events.with_activity_schema(\n\ngroup=attr.user_id,\n\nEnter to Rename, Shift+Enter to Preview\n\nSQL Output\n\nLoading\n\nResults\n\nDownloading Python\n\nLoading\n\n##### Motivation\n\nLogic shouldn't be trapped in any tool, especially not your BI tool. But data\nteams are often forced to choose between doing their modeling with proprietary\nDSLs like LookML or adding complex business logic into raw SQL, where it can't\nbe easily re-used or extended.That's why we're building Hashquery.Hashquery is\ncapable of expressing complex, multi-layered data queries, way beyond the\ncapabilities of standard SQL. It natively integrates with Hashboard, with more\nsemantic layer integrations to come. And unlike a DSL, Hashquery is fully\ncomposable and extensible \u2014 it's just Python.\n\n##### Use cases\n\nPortable Business IntelligenceImport and extend your BI logic in other\napplications, in notebooks, or anywhere else you can write Python.\n\nTeach SQL new tricksCreate metrics that are hard (or impossible!) to write by\nhand in SQL, like funnel attribution and complex segmentation.\n\nAlerting and validationWrite threshold alerts and unit tests against your\nbusiness data and integrate them into your existing tech stack.\n\nAI and LLMs (coming soon)Use LLMs to generate easy to understand Hashquery\nwhich follows the semantics that your data team defined upstream.\n\n##### Works with\n\nSnowflake\n\nBigQuery\n\nMotherDuck\n\nDatabricks\n\nPostgres\n\nRedshift\n\nMySQL\n\nAthena\n\nClickHouse\n\nCSV Files\n\n##### Try Hashquery\n\nThe hashquery client is available in early beta and we'd love to get your\nfeedback.\n\nQuick startConnect to demo data or to your existing Hashboard project, and\nmodel your first analysis.\n\nGuides & API ReferenceLearn how to perform common analysis types using\nHashquery, and browse all available tools.\n\nSign up for updatesStay up-to-date on Hashquery news.\n\n##### FAQ\n\n", "frontpage": true}
