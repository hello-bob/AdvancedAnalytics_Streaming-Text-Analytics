(AP) \u2014 Democrats won back a majority in the Michigan House and\nrestored their party\u2019s full control of state government Tuesday thanks to\nvictories in two special elections.\n\nMai Xiong won the special election in the 13th District, which covers Warren\nand part of Detroit, while Peter Herzberg won in the 25th District, which\ncontains the cities of Wayne and Westland. Both candidates were favorites in\nthe heavily Democratic districts.\n\nThe lower chamber has been tied 54-54 between Democratic and Republican\nlawmakers since November, when two Democratic representatives vacated their\nseats after winning mayoral races in their hometowns.\n\nDemocrats flipped both chambers in the 2022 midterms while maintaining control\nof the governor\u2019s office to win a trifecta for the first time in 40 years.\nThey moved quickly to roll back decades of Republican measures and implement\nthe party\u2019s agenda in their first year, including overhauling the state\u2019s gun\nlaws.\n\nSince the House deadlocked, Republicans have pushed to pass legislation they\nsay is bipartisan, such as a government transparency package, which would open\nthe Legislature and governor\u2019s office up to public record requests.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nMichigan GOP lawmaker falsely claims that buses carrying March Madness teams\nare \u2018illegal invaders\u2019\n\nMichigan governor\u2019s budget promises free education and lower family costs, but\nGOP says it\u2019s unfair\n\nWith each Democratic candidate winning Tuesday, the party will regain control\nthrough the end of the year, with every seat in the House up for reelection in\nNovember.\n\nXiong is a Macomb County commissioner who was endorsed in the primary by Gov.\nGretchen Whitmer. Herzberg is a Westland City Council member who defeated a\nWhitmer-endorsed candidate in the primary earlier this year.\n\nLawmakers are now expected to turn their focus to a state budget with a self-\nimposed July 1 deadline. Whitmer in her annual State of the State speech in\nJanuary called on lawmakers to pass a $80 billion budget that would provide\nfree community college for all high school graduates and free preschool for\n4-year-olds.\n\nIn recent months, Democrats have also deliberated on expanding the state\u2019s\nhate crime law and enacting a comprehensive school safety package of bills in\nthe wake of the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School.\n\nLawmakers will be working against the clock. They are set to take a summer\nbreak at the end of June and representatives will soon begin campaigning in\ntheir districts.\n\nJOEY CAPPELLETTI\n\nCappelletti covers politics and state government for The Associated Press in\nMichigan.
