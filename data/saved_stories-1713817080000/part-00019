(Manuela\nDurson via Shutterstock)\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral argument on Monday in a case that one legal\nexpert has called the \u201cmost important Supreme Court case about homelessness in\nat least 40 years.\u201d The issue before the court is the constitutionality of\nordinances in an Oregon town that bar people who are homeless from using\nblankets, pillows, or cardboard boxes for protection from the elements while\nsleeping within the city limits. Defending the ordinances, the city contends\nthat the laws simply bar camping on public property by everyone. But the\nchallengers in the case counter that the ordinances effectively make it a\ncrime to be homeless in the city.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling could have a significant impact not only in the small city\nof Grants Pass, Oregon, whose ordinances are being challenged, but in cities\nacross the United States, where similar laws have proliferated. The \u201ccamping\nban\u201d model of legislation has been adopted more widely in recent years as\nstate and local governments try to grapple with double-digit increases in the\nnumber of people who are homeless. Data released by the U.S. Department of\nHousing and Urban Development indicated that more than 600,000 people in the\nUnited States were homeless on a single night in 2023.\n\nThe dispute before the court on Monday comes to the justices from Grants Pass,\na city of just under 40,000 people in southwestern Oregon. With a vacancy rate\nof one percent and essentially no affordable housing, the city has as many as\n600 people experiencing homelessness. The chief operating officer of a\nnonprofit in the county where the city is located that serves people who are\nhomeless said in a declaration submitted in the case that almost all of the\npeople who are homeless and live in the city do so involuntarily. \u201cThere is\nsimply no place in Grants Pass for them to find affordable housing or shelter.\nThey are not choosing to live on the street or in the woods,\u201d the nonprofit\nCOO said.\n\nAt a 2013 city council meeting to discuss possible solutions to the city\u2019s\nhomelessness problem, the city council president suggesting \u201cmak[ing] it\nuncomfortable enough for [homeless people] in our city so they will want to\nmove on down the road.\u201d The city decided to increase enforcement of ordinances\nthat bar the use of blankets, pillows, and even cardboard boxes while sleeping\nwithin the city.\n\nThe ordinances impose a $295 fine for violations; the fine increases to\n$537.60 if it is not paid. After two citations, police in Grants Pass can\nissue an order that bans the individual from city property; a violation of\nthat order exposes the individual to a conviction on criminal trespass\ncharges, which carry penalties of up to 30 days in jail and a $1250 fine.\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled in Martin v. City\nof Boise that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment bars\nthe imposition of criminal penalties for sitting or sleeping outside by people\nexperiencing homelessness who do not have access to shelter.\n\nShortly after the court\u2019s ruling in the Boise case, John Logan and Gloria\nJohnson (along with Debra Blake, who has since died) went to federal court in\nOregon to challenge the constitutionality of the Grants Pass ordinances on\ntheir own behalf and on behalf of others who are involuntarily homeless in\nGrants Pass. Logan has been homeless at times in the city for over a decade\nand has sometimes slept in his truck outside the city so that he was not\nticketed and fined for sleeping in the truck in the city. After she was\nevicted and could not find other housing that she could afford, Johnson slept\nin her van, where the ordinances were enforced against her on \u201cdozens of\noccasions.\u201d\n\nA federal district court issued a permanent injunction that barred the city\nfrom enforcing the ordinances at all at night and under some circumstances\nduring the day. Relying on the Martin case, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel\nupheld that ruling; the full court of appeals denied the city\u2019s request to\nrehear the case by a vote of 14-13. The city came to the Supreme Court, which\nagreed earlier this year to weigh in.\n\nIn its brief at the Supreme Court, the city insists that the Eighth Amendment\nregulates cruel and unusual methods of punishment; it does not regulate the\nsubstance of criminal offenses. \u201cModest\u201d punishments like fines and short jail\nterms are not cruel and unusual, the city argues. The Eighth Amendment, the\ncity contends, was modeled on the English Declaration of Rights, which was in\nturn \u201ca reaction to cruel sentencing practices under King James II.\u201d Indeed,\nthe city notes, the amendment\u2019s ban on \u201cexcessive fines\u201d in another clause\nindicates that fines may be imposed \u2013 they simply may not be excessive.\nOtherwise, the excessive fines clause would not be necessary.\n\nIn 1962, in Robinson v. California, the city continues, the Supreme Court held\nthat the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment prohibited the\nstate from making it a crime simply to be a drug addict in California, even if\nthere was no proof that the defendant had ever used drugs in the state. That\nis, it barred the criminalization of status (being a drug addict), but not\nconduct (possession or use of drugs). But, the city notes, the court explained\nthat the state could still make it a crime for addicts to engage in conduct\nrelated to drugs \u2013 buying, selling, using, or possessing them.\n\nThe court of appeals, the city argues, wrongly \u201cstretched Robinson\u2019s narrow\nholding that\u201d the cruel and unusual punishments clause \u201cforbade punishing a\nparticular status, decoupled from any conduct, into a sweeping constitutional\nrule that prohibits any punishment for purportedly involuntary acts that flow\nfrom a status.\u201d But, the city contends, its ordinances pass muster under\nRobinson because they do not make it a crime to be homeless in the city.\nInstead, they only apply when someone has committed an affirmative act that\n\u201csociety has an interest in preventing\u201d \u2013 in this case, \u201coccupying a campsite\non public property.\u201d\n\nThe city tells the justices that the 9th Circuit\u2019s rulings in the Boise case\nand this one \u201chave proved practically unworkable.\u201d \u201cThe lack of constitutional\nfoundation\u201d for the decisions, it contends, \u201chas thrust federal courts into\nthe inappropriate role of legislating homelessness policy and yielded a host\nof complex rules that micromanage local governments on that pressing issue.\u201d\nThe city cites the difficulty of determining, for example, whether someone who\nis experiencing homelessness is doing so voluntarily \u2013 for example, whether\nsomeone has declined to stay in a shelter because her dog would not be able to\nstay with her \u2013 as well as the difficulty of determining how many beds are\navailable each night and how many people need shelter. As a result, the city\ncautions, encampments of people who are homeless \u201chave multiplied unchecked\nthroughout the West because generally applicable restrictions on public\ncamping no longer play their critical deterrent role, resulting in spikes in\nviolent crime, drug overdoses, disease, fires, and hazardous waste.\u201d\n\nThe challengers push back sharply against city\u2019s characterization of the\nordinances at the center of the dispute and, by extension, the question before\nthe justices. Although the ordinances \u201cnominally prohibit camping,\u201d they\nconcede, the weather in Grants Pass is cold and rainy, so that anyone who does\nnot have access to shelter must have a blanket to survive. As a result, they\nsay, the real question before the court is whether the ordinances violate the\nEighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment \u201cby inflicting\npunishment on the City\u2019s homeless residents for simply existing in the\ncommunity without access to shelter.\u201d\n\nThe court of appeals was correct, the challengers tell the justices, in\nholding that the answer to that question is \u201cyes.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling\nin Robinson easily disposes of this case, the challengers contend, because \u2013\njust like the state law in Robinson \u2013 the city\u2019s ordinances punish people who\nare involuntarily homeless based on their status.\n\nNothing about the lower court\u2019s ruling, the challengers maintain, infringes on\nthe city\u2019s power to address the problem of homelessness. Indeed, they say, the\ndistrict court acknowledged that the city retains the \u201cbroad power\u201d to do so,\n\u201cincluding whether to offer shelter options or other social services, whether\nto restrict when and where homeless residents may sleep, and whether to\nprohibit tents and clear encampments.\u201d The city can also continue to enforce\nits health and safety laws, including laws that restrict litter, bar the\nobstruction of roads, and prohibit the possession of drugs. \u201cBut just as\nCalifornia crossed the constitutional line when it criminalized simply being\nin the state while having a narcotic addiction,\u201d the challengers emphasize,\n\u201cpunishing people for existing in the community without shelter is cruel,\nunusual, and impermissible under the Punishments Clause.\u201d\n\nThe $295 fine per violation increases to over $500 when not paid \u2013 which, the\nchallengers say, is \u201cdevastating,\u201d particularly when the increase is almost an\ninevitability when someone is already experiencing homelessness because they\ncannot afford shelter. Police can fine someone experiencing homelessness\nrepeatedly in a short period of time: Debra Blake, one of the original\nplaintiffs in this case, was fined three times in one morning and, by March\n2020, owed more than $5,000 in fines. Such a scheme can perpetuate a \u201ccycle of\nhomelessness and poverty,\u201d the challengers add. And when people experiencing\nhomelessness accrue unpaid fines, those fines can lead to the suspension of\ntheir driver\u2019s licenses and lower credit scores, which can in turn make it\nmore difficult for them to obtain jobs and housing.\n\nIn a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief, the Biden administration agrees that the\ncore of the 9th Circuit\u2019s decision in the Boise case is sound. Cities, U.S.\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar writes, cannot make it a crime for people\nexperiencing homelessness who do not have access to shelter to reside within\ntheir limits at all. However, Prelogar stresses, cities can enforce\nrestrictions to ensure the health and safety of their residents, including by\nprohibiting tents, stoves, and fires in public spaces and by closing\nencampments.\n\nAt the same time, the Biden administration parts ways with the challengers by\narguing that the principle outlined in Robinson requires an individualized\ninquiry into the specific circumstances of someone who is homeless. It is not\nenough, the Biden administration suggests, for courts to conclude that someone\nis involuntarily homeless and therefore cannot be charged with violating the\nordinances simply based on the ration of people experiencing homelessness to\nthe number of beds available in shelters. Such an approach, the Biden\nadministration posits, \u201cwould alleviate many of the practical concerns that\u201d\nthe city and its supporters \u201chave expressed about the effects of the court of\nappeals\u2019 decision in Martin and this case.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published at Howe on the Court.\n\nPosted in Featured, Merits Cases\n\nCases: City of Grants Pass, Oregon v.
