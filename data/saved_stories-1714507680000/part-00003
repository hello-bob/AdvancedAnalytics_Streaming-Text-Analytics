The court considered the request during a closed-door\nconference on Friday and ultimately denied it on Monday without comment.\n\nNavarro's legal team contended that pausing the lower court's ruling that\ndenied his request to avoid prison was justified because he posed no flight\nrisk and was raising significant legal issues.\n\nHe said his appeal would present numerous issues likely to lead to the\nreversal of his conviction or a new trial. However, both lower courts rejected\nsimilar appeals made by Navarro.\n\nChief Justice Roberts rejected his request in a brief opinion last month,\nsaying that the federal appeals courts had determined Navarro forfeited any\nchallenge to the notion that he could avoid appearing before Congress, even if\nhe was entitled to executive privilege. Roberts saw no reason to disagree with\nthis determination.\n\nNavarro's defense attorneys expressed frustration with the decision, saying\nthat it severely limited their ability to mount a defense.\n\nJust before reporting to prison in March, Navarro held a press conference\nwhere he criticized the judicial process, accusing the district and appellate\njudges involved in his case of being biased Democrats from \"start to finish\".\n\nWith the Supreme Court's decision, it is expected that Navarro will serve his\nfour-month prison term before his appeal of the conviction is heard by the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nFormer White House adviser Steve Bannon was also convicted on two counts of\ncontempt of Congress for failing to comply with a January 6 committee subpoena\nand was sentenced to four months in prison.\n\nHowever, a different judge ruled that he could remain free while awaiting\nappeal. Bannon's case was argued before a federal appeals court in November,\nbut as of now, he has not served any time in prison.\n\nDonald trump Supreme court\n\n\u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2024.
