Usually they just draw some\nbasic info on the bottle with special paint marker. Then I got this idea.\nEverybody can get paper label printed, but what about bottle plotter. CNC that\nwould used this paint marker as plotter to plot the label directly on the\nbottle. And with toolchager you could also has more colors.\n\nI had this idea in my head for some time, but it take me quite long time to do\nthis mental kick-off and start to work on it. Usually, what works for me is\nthat when the mood is right I go outside walking and fully put myself in this\ntrans-like state where I keep iterating on that idea and create first design\nin my head. But the \"mood\" was not coming for some time, so once I have found\nmyself forced to drive for 2h alone in car back home. I never tried this while\ndriving, but I have managed to get myself into that state and come with first\ndesign. I also decided I would like to prototype it as fast as possible.\n\nThe plan was to create shitty design print it, test it, change it, print it.\nIt was kind of amazing, funny but also exhausting. On beginning I started\nsimply on the whole mechanical configuration of the plotter. Main ideas for\nbefore I started.\n\n  * I will putt stepper motor on free moving arm with rubber wheel touching the bottle on top and with its weight it will press on the bottle to assure contact and when running it will rotate the bottle.\n  * Pen will be placed horizontally\n  * There will be quite sophisticated revolver mechanism for changing pens\n  * Bottle will be rolling on bearing on the bottom that will be done in way it could accommodate different diameters of bottles\n  * I will make the final product as simple/cheap as possible. Maximum of 3D printing and as few types of mechanical components as possible. I decided to use M4x10 with cylindrical head as standard fastener.\n\nSpoiler: All of this proved to be wrong.\n\nAfter putting first part together issues started to show up. Having motor on\ntop did not work, it was trying to push the bottle not roll it everytime. I\ndecided to abandon multitool quite soon as it started to be obvious it is just\nbig complication for now. And should be pushed to the future as \"Nice to\nhave\".\n\nFirst prototype was just awful, ugly falling apart. I was printing 4 revision\nof some part per day. But I was learning a lot. I used some parts that I\nalready had on hand as linear stage etc.\n\nOn the picture is already little bit advanced version where I started testing\nmotorized roller on bottom. But this also did not work well. One of the issue\nwas that, as the bottle is not perfect you may end up on different spot when\nyou are rotating back and forward. Also one the issues is that you need some\nfreedom of movement on the pen to allow for following surface of bottle. So\neverything point to having the pen vertical. In hindsight it seems sooooo\nobvious.\n\nI tried to used printed spring for the pen holder but it was not working well\nso I went with linear rail that was actually at hand.\n\nFirst more successful print\n\nEnded up with pretty cool refind pen holder system\n\nI still had issues with using bottom rollers for rotating the bottle. I wish\nthere would already some industrial application where you need to rotate\nsomething around its axis (lath). Yep, Im an idiot...\n\nYes using this axial direct drives solves lot of issues and is simpler. One\ndisadvantage is that the motor has lower resolution, but that should not be an\nissue.\n\nCouple of iteration later on locking mechanism. Simple and mostly printed.\n\nAfter all of this I actually had decent CNC bottle plotter. But it was still\nbased on proprietary components (motors, stage, linear rails) that I had by\naccident lying around, so in case I would like to build another one, I could\nnot.\n\n## Version 2\n\nLot of time passed before this. This project was something I did for my own\neducation and for fun. So in free time. And as I started to build Positron V3,\nthen design some parts and upgrade for it for our Muon3D project. I really did\nnot have time to focus on this. But luckily I was approached by my first\ncustomer who offered couple bottles of wine in exchange for working bottle\nplotter.\n\nWhen I started to work on first version I was not using any master model or\nassembly of whole project. All was done on my table, which was helpful as I\ndid not have really that many experience to be sure how I want to really\ndesign it. But for V2 I decided to build 3D assembly before printing and\nbuilding.\n\nKey ideas for V2:\n\n  * Use only as much standard as possible components. Which means cheap and easy to get.\n  * Simplify the design even more.\n  * Use 3D designed master model\n\nAs I was little bit skeptic about having assembly model on begging, as I saw\nit as too much extra work without much of benefit. I had it say it definitely\nsaved me lot time and iterations after all. And it was worth it.\n\n3D model\n\nThe plotter itself\n\nAnd plotted bottle\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIm happy I managed to test both, rapid iteration and more controlled way of\nbuilding stuff. Again looking on the final machine everything looks as very\nobvious solution. Which is annoying as it took me quite some time to get to\nthat. But it is also sign that it is probably the right one.\n\nAnd another thing. I was not really able to find some G-Code generator that I\nwould be happy with so I build my own.\n\ngeek hacking programming\n\n  * Z\u00edskat odkaz\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * E-mail\n  * Dal\u0161\u00ed aplikace\n\n### Koment\u00e1\u0159e\n\n#### Okomentovat\n\n### Popul\u00e1rn\u00ed p\u0159\u00edsp\u011bvky z tohoto blogu\n\n### Reprogramming \"old\" Sennheiser SKM 3072-U - Part 1 - Intro\n\ndubna 09, 2021\n\nI'm somehow interested in audio production. But not it more my pet hobby,\nnothing that would generate decent income. This means I usually don't want to\nspend much of money on the equipment. Right about now is quite good time to\nget some old-ish wireless audio equipment for decent price. The reason is that\nthere was change ( info ) in wireless bands and bands that used to be free\nbefore are not available for the professional audio anymore. That means that\nlot of productions are ditching their stuff to buy new one, compatible. But\nnot all the old stuff is useless as some of it can be reprogrammed. There is\ntight window from 822 to 830 MHz in EU. This window is quite narrow, but at\nleast it should granted all the time for professional audio. Other option is\nto go below 700Mhz, but then you might get into collision with local TV\ntransmitter. Therefore I settled for the narrow band since I don't plan to use\ntoo many transmitters at once and this should work for me well.
