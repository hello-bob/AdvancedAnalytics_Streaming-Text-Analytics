O. Kwon\n\nApril 22, 2024 7:00 AM EDT\n\nKwon is the author of the novels Exhibit and The Incendiaries\n\nNo one regrets having a child, or so it\u2019s said. I\u2019ve heard this logic often,\nusually after I\u2019m asked if I have children, then, when I say I don\u2019t, if I\nplan to. I tend to evade the question, as I find that the truth\u2014I have no\nplans to be a parent\u2014is likely to invite swift dissent. I\u2019ll be told I\u2019ll\nchange my mind, that I\u2019m wrong, and that while I\u2019ll regret not having a child,\npeople don\u2019t regret the obverse. Close family, acquaintances, and total\nstrangers have said this for years; I let it slide, knowing that, at the very\nleast, the last part is a fiction.\n\nIt is, unsurprisingly, a challenge to get solid data on the number of parents\nwho regret having children. In 1975, the popular advice columnist Ann Landers\nasked her readers if, given the chance to do it all over again, they\u2019d have\nchildren. Seventy percent said they wouldn\u2019t; this result, though, came from a\ngroup of self-selecting respondents. \u201cThe hurt, angry and disenchanted\u201d are\nmore inclined to write back than contented people, as Landers observed in a\nfollow-up 1976 column. But in 2013, a Gallup poll asked Americans 45 and older\nhow many kids they\u2019d have if they could go back in time. Seven percent of the\nrespondents with children said zero. And in 2023, a study estimated that up to\n5% to 14% of parents in so-called developed countries, including the United\nStates, regret their decision to have children.\n\nThese studies align with what I've found in my personal life: While most\nparents don\u2019t regret having kids, some do. Perhaps in part because I\u2019ve\nwritten publicly about choosing not to have children, I\u2019ve had people,\nespecially mothers, confide in me about parental regret, and frequently enough\nI\u2019ve lost count.\n\nRead More: Why So Many Women Are Waiting Longer to Have Kids\n\nMost of the time\u2014whether I hear it in passing, quickly, from a stranger at a\nliterary event, or late at night from a beloved friend\u2014this kind of revelation\narises from a place of anguish. Some of these parents talk about feeling\nutterly alone, like villains past all imagining. Several have noted that,\nafraid of being judged, they decline to be candid with their own therapists.\nIf asked what I think, I reply that, from what I\u2019m hearing, they\u2019re not alone.\nNot at all. I hope it helps; I\u2019m told, at times, it does. It\u2019s a physic to\nwhich I\u2019ve devoted my life: asked why I write, I often respond that books,\nwords have provided vital fellowship during spells of harsh isolation, when I\nthought that solitude and its attendant, life-torquing evils\u2014shame, guilt, the\npain of exile\u2014might kill me.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m so often advised that I\u2019ll be a parent that, though I\u2019m sure I\nwon\u2019t, I still prod at this ghost self, trying on its shape, asking what I\u2019d\ndo if I felt obliged to adopt this spectral, alternate life as mine. For\nhere\u2019s the next question people tend to broach if I indicate I don\u2019t plan on\nhaving kids: what does my husband think? I find this odd, a little prying\u2014do\npeople think I didn\u2019t discuss this topic with him, at length, long before we\npledged to share a life?\u2014but the question also rings the alarm bell of one of\nmy own great fears. If I respond with the truth, that he feels exactly as I\ndo, here\u2019s the usual follow-up: but what if he changes his mind?\n\nRead More: Why I Have Zero Regrets About My Childless Life\n\nI have friends who long for kids, and I know the need to be potent,\ninarguable, as primal as my desire to go without. I\u2019ve seen parent friends\u2019\nfaces open with love as they watch their small children sing to living-room\nkaraoke, the adults radiating joy as laughing tots carol and bop. Should my\nhusband\u2019s mind change, I can picture the rift that would open wide, dividing\nus. Either I\u2019d deprive him of what he needs, or I\u2019d give in, birthing a child\nI don\u2019t want. Or, and this prospect is painful enough that it hurts to type\nthe words, our lives would have to diverge. No bridge of compromise can quite\ntraverse the rift: as King Solomon knew, there are no half-children.\n\nThis fear is so salient that I turned it into a pivotal tension in my upcoming\nnovel, Exhibit: a celebrated photographer and her husband agreed they both\ndon\u2019t want children, but he wakes up one day realizing he does, and powerfully\nso. She\u2019s certain she ought not be a parent; he\u2019s pining for a child; they\nlove each other very much. Short on joint paths forward, they have no idea\nwhat to do next.\n\nParental regret springs from a range of origins, not all having to do with\nprivation of choice or means. In and before a post-Dobbs U.S., people have\ngiven birth against their will. The cost of raising a child runs high; for\nparents lacking funds and support, dire hardship can result. It\u2019s a lack far\ntoo typical in the U.S., where there\u2019s no federally mandated paid parental\nleave, and families are often priced out of childcare. But this regret isn\u2019t a\nphenomenon limited to people in grave financial straits, nor to those forced\ninto parenting. Other parents, all through the world, also wish they\u2019d elected\notherwise.\n\nIn recent months, as I waited for the publication of the novel I worked on for\nnine years, I kept returning to the plight I\u2019d explored: I hadn\u2019t yet finished\nwondering what I might do, how I\u2019d live, if. And though I\u2019d heard a range of\nchronicles of parental regret, as have other friends without kids, the stories\nwere related one-on-one, in private. It\u2019s a taboo subject, one made all the\nmore difficult, punitive, by the ubiquitous belief that people who feel as\nthey do either can\u2019t or ought not exist.\n\nRead More: Does Marriage Really Make People Happier? A Discussion\n\nI\u2019ve also thought about the isolating effect of silence, and what it can cost\nto live in hiding. I wanted to talk with parents who, if they could go back in\ntime, might make different choices\u2014and who\u2019d also agree to be quoted. It was,\nagain unsurprisingly, hard to find people willing to speak with me on the\nrecord about parental regret. I promised to alter the names of each parent I\ninterviewed for this piece. Even so, people were skittish.\n\n\u201cI don't think that everyone is made for children,\u201d says Helen, a high school\nteacher in her 40s. And telling people that their purpose is to reproduce is\ndestructive, she adds. It\u2019s what she heard growing up: though Helen wanted to\ntake Latin in high school, her mother forced her to enroll in home economics\ninstead. \u201cI don't think I ever decided to have kids. I was pretty much just\ntold that that's what you do. That's what girls are for,\u201d Helen says.\n\nAs a result, Helen makes sure to tell her students that having children is an\noption, one that might not be right for them. She says the same thing to her\nkids, both girls. \u201cI think that people need to know that just being themselves\nis enough,\u201d she says.\n\nRead More: Why You Should Think Before Telling Mothers 'They're Only Little\nOnce'\n\nAt this point, half an hour into a phone call, Helen has cried, briefly, a\ncouple of times. Now, I\u2019m the one tearing up. I tell Helen I grew up in a\npredominantly Christian Korean American community. The primacy of having kids\nis built into the Korean language: I knew most Korean adults only as \u201cthe\nmother of x\u201d or \u201cthe father of y.\u201d I might have felt less strange if I\u2019d had a\nHelen at my high school. While I didn\u2019t quite, at any point, decide against\nbeing a parent\u2014I didn\u2019t have to, since I had no inkling of the urge in the\nfirst place\u2014I also never heard it said that there might be an alternative.\n\n\u201cAnd if you thought there was any other way to live, there's something wrong\nwith you,\u201d Helen says.\n\nI ask what she\u2019d do if she had more time to herself. \u201cI would write. I would\ntake walks,\u201d she replies. \u201cI enjoyed writing academic papers. I enjoyed\nwriting them for my master's.\u201d It used to upset her when classes were too\neasy. Given the chance, she would think for hours without interruption. She\u2019d\ntake up further studies.\n\nAnd if she could inhabit the person she was before she became a parent? \u201cI\nwould have stopped that pregnancy before it happened.\u201d But that\u2019s the part\nHelen\u2019s never said to her daughters, who, after all, didn\u2019t ask to be born.\nShe\u2019s hell-bent on raising them well, not taking out any regrets on the girls.\n\u201cI love them. I just don't love the choice I made.\u201d\n\nEach parent I talk to points out this dividing line: it\u2019s possible to have\nstrong, lasting regrets about a life choice while ferociously loving\u2014and\ncaring for\u2014the fruit of that decision. Paul, a Canadian father of young boys,\nnotes that though he could write a book on everything he resents having lost\nas a result of becoming a parent, he also would do anything for his kids.\nPaul\u2019s boys are the loves of his life. Still, overall, fathering has been\ndetrimental to his well-being.\n\n\u201cMy body is constantly on standby, waiting for the next disaster,\u201d Paul says.\n\u201cAs an introvert, I also deeply resent having no private time.\u201d He\u2019s fatigued\nand never at ease, finding all aspects of child-rearing to be stressful. It\u2019s\nnot a problem that would be resolved if he had more caretaking support. \u201cI do\nhave help with the kids from family, and I know if I asked for more help, I'd\nget it,\u201d he tells me, but he often refuses help because he believes that, as a\nfather, it's his job to take on the brunt of tasks that attend parenting.\n\nInstead, what Paul lacks, in terms of support, is people with whom he can be\nhonest. \u201cI don't have anyone to talk to about parental regret,\u201d he says. He\nwishes he had more spaces where parents aren't publicly shamed for feeling\ntrapped or stifled. And though he\u2019d felt ambivalent about becoming a father,\nand it was his husband who first decided he wanted a child, he hasn\u2019t let this\ninitial split in longing drive them apart. With his husband, as with the other\npeople in his life, he's quiet about his regret: \u201cAs much as I might feel his\ndesire to be a parent has led me to my decision, that decision was also my\nown.\u201d\n\nPeople have asked how I learned that not having kids might be an option. I\nlive in San Francisco, where I\u2019m hardly the only person with no kids\u2014out of\nthe major U.S. cities, San Francisco has the smallest percentage of\nchildren\u2014but even so, for some people, having kids can feel so fated that they\ntalk about not having imagined otherwise.\n\nOne friend who\u2019s asked this question has told me she felt regret during the\nfirst years of her child\u2019s life, but that, as her child got older, the rue\nleft. For other parents, though, the regret proves lasting. Robin, who has\nadult offspring in their 40s, says that, to this day, if she could reverse\ntime, she would \u201ccertainly not have a baby ever, not under any circumstances.\u201d\nShe notes that she\u2019d had no notion of what being a parent can entail. Having\ngrown up in an affluent, cheerful family, she was glad to have children with\nher husband, figuring that \u201cit all just looked like a romantic, happy road.\u201d\n\nInstead, after electing to be a stay-at-home mother, Robin found herself in\nwhat she calls \u201cthe domestic gulag,\u201d a life that consisted of being \u201ca\nchauffeur and an arranger and an appointment setter and a social secretary and\na party planner and a chef and a meal planner and a budgeter\u201d and \u201can\nemergency nurse and a night nurse and a psychologist and a confidant.\u201d\n\nRobin also, like the other parents I spoke to, felt responsible for raising\nher children well, teaching them how to lead \u201cgood, honorable, happy\u201d lives,\nstriving to instill and model integrity and kindness. It was a daily, 20-year\neffort all the more crushing since, each morning, waking up, she\u2019d recall the\nday\u2019s to-do list and know that she didn\u2019t want to do any of it.\n\nReplying to my questions, Robin keeps having to pause to take phone calls from\na nurse caring for her ill, elderly aunt. There\u2019s no one else in Robin\u2019s\nfamily who\u2019ll fill the role, she says, so it\u2019s up to her to look after her\naunt\u2019s well-being. I\u2019m conscious that I\u2019m telling you this because I\u2019m alive\nto what at least some readers will think about Helen, Paul, and Robin: that\nthe act of admitting to regret ipso facto convicts them as bad, unfit parents.\nAs, that is, evil people. They know it, too, and are as afraid of being\nrecognized as they are intent on telling people what they\u2019re living\nthrough\u2014hoping, with a fervor I recognize from my bygone life as an\nevangelical Christian, to prevent others\u2019 misery.\n\nHoping to ease others\u2019 solitude, too. Online forums aside, there are almost no\nspaces where a parent can discuss regret. Some of this is for good reason\u2014no\nchild should have to hear that they\u2019re regretted\u2014but what other human\nexperience is there about which one will probably be judged a monster for\nhaving any regret at all?\n\nOne problem is that our culture wants just one kind of story about parenting,\nand it\u2019s a story of \u201cpure joy,\u201d says Yael Goldstein-Love, a writer and\npsychotherapist in California whose clinical practice focuses on people who\nare adapting to parenthood. But, Goldstein-Love says, people often experience\ngrief in the transition to being a parent, grief for the life they might have\ninhabited otherwise. \u201cPart of what makes the grief unspeakable is that there's\nalways a strand of this regret,\u201d she adds.\n\nWhile Goldstein-Love hasn\u2019t had patients bring it up, she also has friends who\nconfide in her about parental regret. I mention the alacrity with which people\ncan lunge to say that no parent feels regret, that it\u2019s impossible. I ask if,\nperhaps, this type of remorse poses an existential threat, belying an ideal\npicture of what we might be to our own parents. Is this an aspect of why\npeople can be so quick to refute the notion that regret can, and does, happen?\n\nAbsolutely, she replies: Most people want to believe that our parents felt\nnothing but delight about raising us. \u201cThey never regretted a moment. They\nnever hated us. And that's bullsh-t.\u201d I ask Goldstein-Love what she\u2019d tell\nparents who wish they had made another choice.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that you can, and this is much easier said than done, try not\nto feel ashamed of this.\u201d It\u2019s tempting, she explains, to judge how we feel\nabout life experiences, asking ourselves, \u201cDoes this make me a good person?\nDoes this make me a bad person? Am I doing this right? Am I doing this wrong?\u201d\n\nBut feelings aren\u2019t inherently \u201ctruly ugly,\u201d Goldstein-Love says. \u201cThey just\nare.\u201d It\u2019s what people make of their feelings that might be \u201cugly or not.\u201d\nSome people don\u2019t find joy in parenting, let alone pure joy, \u201cand that\u2019s also\nfine.\u201d Regret is not itself a threat to a parent\u2019s love for a child, and it\ncan help to admit, even to oneself, that which might feel unspeakable. \u201cI\nreally would encourage people to realize that you are not alone in this\nfeeling,\u201d she says.\n\nI think of the halting conversations I\u2019ve been having with parents, and the\ndifficulty with which people talk about regret. Few choices are less\nirreversible than deciding to be a parent: once the child is born, a person is\nhere who didn\u2019t previously exist. But I also wonder who\u2019s being served well by\na monolithic idea that no one regrets being a parent. Not these parents; not,\nas some of the people I\u2019ve spoken with have pointed out, any kids who pick up\non parental regret and think it can\u2019t happen, except to them. If more people\nhad the support to make reproductive choices based on their own desires and\nlife situations, and if the monolith were spalled in favor of plural\nnarratives that better reflect the complexities of human experience, what\nthen?\n\nI think of the people who have spoken to me about regret and isolation,\nincluding those I haven\u2019t yet mentioned\u2014a mother finishing nursing school in\nMississippi, a mother of five in Nebraska, and all the privately confiding\nparents. One parent asks at the end of our conversation, \u201cWhat have other\nparents said? Was it the same thing? Was it the same thing as me?\u201d\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * The 100 Most Influential People of 2024\n  * Coco Gauff Is Playing for Herself Now\n  * Scenes From Pro-Palestinian Encampments Across U.S. Universities\n  * 6 Compliments That Land Every Time\n  * If You're Dating Right Now , You're Brave: Column\n  * The AI That Could Heal a Divided Internet\n  * Fallout Is a Brilliant Model for the Future of Video Game Adaptations\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
