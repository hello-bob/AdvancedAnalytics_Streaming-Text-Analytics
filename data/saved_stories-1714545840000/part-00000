All three ether ETFs closed down less than 1\nper cent.\n\nThe bitcoin ETFs saw nearly HK$67 million (US$9.2 million) in trading volume\nby the end of the day, with ChinaAMC\u2019s ETF seeing the most trading with about\nHK$37 million changing hands.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s launch of new crypto ETFs, seen as offering some advantages for\ninvestors in Asia compared with similar products in the US that are much\nbigger in scale, will test the city\u2019s progress in its pursuit of becoming a\nhub for virtual asset businesses.\n\nThe six Hong Kong funds racked up nearly HK$87 million by the close of\ntrading. In comparison, 11 bitcoin ETFs in the US, which debuted in January,\nsaw more than US$4.6 billion traded on their first day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHong Kong could expect the trading volume of its spot crypto ETFs to reach 20\nper cent of those in the US within about a year, HashKey Group chief operating\nofficer Livio Weng said at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\nMarket makers likely contributed the bulk of first-day trading, so it remains\nto be seen how demand for these products will hold up in the coming days and\nweeks.\n\nSaturday\n\nInside China Tech Newsletter\n\nYour weekly round-up of the biggest trending tech stories from China.\n\nBy submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP.

Online Chinese brokerage Tiger Brokers said in a statement on\nMonday that it is offering platform fee exemptions for the first batch of\nthese ETFs.\n\nGiven the Hong Kong ETF market\u2019s diminutive size compared with the US, the\nfunds are hoping to draw investors looking for products offered specifically\nin Asia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNon-Hong Kong residents can purchase shares in the crypto ETFs as long as they\npass local know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, HashKey Capital said in a\nstatement on Tuesday.\n\n06:54\n\nIs cryptocurrency too risky for China?\n\nIs cryptocurrency too risky for China?\n\nWhile that means the ETFs are technically available to mainland Chinese\ninvestors who have Hong Kong bank or brokerage accounts, investing in these\nproducts could still be difficult because mainland identity cards may not be\nable to pass brokerage platforms\u2019 KYC procedures, said one industry insider\nwho declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeijing has strictly banned commercial cryptocurrency trading on the mainland.\nOther types of ETFs can already be traded through the Stock Connect scheme\nthat links to markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nHong Kong regulators at the launch event on Tuesday morning, which included a\nbell-ringing ceremony, cautioned that there are high risks involved in the\ncrypto-based products despite the successful listings.\n\n\u201cOur approval for virtual asset ETFs does not equate to us supporting the\nrelevant virtual assets or us encouraging the public to invest in them,\u201d\nChristina Choi Fung Yee, executive director of investment products at the\nSecurities and Futures Commission, said during the ceremony. \u201cVirtual assets\nare extremely speculative with highly volatile prices ...
