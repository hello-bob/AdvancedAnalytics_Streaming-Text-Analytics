Like, \"fooled Gracie's Mother\" good.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n# # F.A.Q\n\n## Problem\n\nMany websites are using AI/ML to create clickbait which actually doesn't have\nany valuable content.\n\n## Value\n\nI use AI to de-clickbait the clickbait by allowing AI to read my news for me.\nThen it creates a meaningful tldr; regarding the articles of interest which\nhelps discern what I should read. It is saving me a ton of time.\n\n## Why\n\nFWIW HAQ.NEWS really started out as my personal news feed, enriched by Ai, and\nconverted into something quick and easy to read. But then I started getting\nrequests for features like rss, Gracie got involved, and with the super-power\nof Ai things have taken on a life of their own.\n\n## Sharing\n\nI currently post daily infosec news to x, linkedin, mastodon and rss.\n\nI also post daily infosec podcasts and interviews to apple podcasts and\nspotify.\n\n## Ads\n\nThis isn't an Ad.\n\nI want to encourage people and projects that impress me, by posting a banner\nlinking their work, as it's my desire to help others. I do not take or make\nany money.\n\nThanks, Jared Folkins\n\n\u00a9 2024 HAQ.NEWS JARED@HAQ.NEWS\n\n", "frontpage": false}
