The League was a non-Zionist\norganisation and was led by Isaac Nachman Steinberg.\n\nIn late 1938 or early 1939, the pastoral firm of Michael Durack in Australia\noffered the League about 16,500 square kilometres (6,400 sq mi) in the\nKimberley region in Australia, stretching from the north of Western Australia\ninto the Northern Territory. The League sent a Yiddish poet and essayist\nMelech Ravitch to the Northern Territory in the 1930s to investigate the\nregion and to collect data on topography and climate.\n\n## Investigations[edit]\n\nThe League investigated the proposal, hoping to buy an area of 28,000 square\nkilometres (11,000 sq mi) of agricultural land for 75,000 Jews fleeing\nEurope.^[2] The tract in question was that of Connor, Doherty and Durack\nLimited, including Auvergne Station, Newry Station, and Argyle Downs, and\nextending between the Ord and Victoria Rivers. Under the plan, an initial\n500-600 pioneers would arrive to construct basic necessities for the\nsettlement such as homes, irrigation works, and a power station, followed by\nthe arrival of the main body of immigrants.^[3] Ravitch in his report to the\nLeague promoted a bigger number than Steinberg, suggesting the area could\naccommodate a million Jewish refugees.\n\nSteinberg (1888\u20131957) was sent out from London to further investigate the\nscheme's feasibility and to enlist governmental and communal endorsement. He\narrived in Perth on 23 May 1939. Steinberg was a skilled emissary, and based\nhis campaign on the officially declared need by Australia to populate northern\nAustralia.^[4]\n\nBy early 1940, he won the support of churches,^[5] leading newspapers, many\nprominent political and public figures (including Western Australian Premier\nJohn Willcock) and a number of Jewish leaders,^[3] but he also encountered\nopposition. Steinberg left Australia in June 1943 to rejoin his family in\nCanada.\n\n## Opposition[edit]\n\nA 1944 opinion poll found that only 53% of Australians supported the scheme,\nwith 47% against the plan. Opposition was primarily based on concerns that the\nsettlers would inevitably drift away from Kimberley and begin migrating to the\ncities in large numbers.^[3] On 15 July 1944 the scheme was vetoed by the\nAustralian government and Labor Prime Minister John Curtin (with bipartisan\nsupport^[3]) informed Steinberg that the Australian government would not\n\"depart from the long-established policy in regard to alien settlement in\nAustralia\" and could not \"entertain the proposal for a group settlement of the\nexclusive type contemplated by the Freeland League\".^[2]^[6]\n\nIn 1948 Steinberg published a book on his experience, titled Australia \u2013 the\nUnpromised Land: in search of a home.^[7]^[8]\n\nHowever, even after Israel was created in 1949, Steinberg tried once more \u2013\nunsuccessfully \u2013 approaching the newly re-elected Robert Menzies in 1950. But\nMenzies replied that the idea ran contrary to his government's policy of\nassimilation aimed at achieving \"the ideal of one Australian family of\npeoples, devoid of foreign communities.\"^[9]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Australia portal\n\n  * Andinia Plan\n  * Fugu Plan\n  * Jewish Autonomous Oblast\n  * Madagascar Plan\n  * Port Davey, another location proposed for Jewish resettlement in Australia during WWII.\n  * Proposals for a Jewish state\n  * Uganda Scheme\n  * Zionism\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"YIVO | Frayland-lige\". yivoencyclopedia.org.
