Women reported less overall job\nsatisfaction than men for the sixth consecutive year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nJob satisfaction in the US is at a high\u2014but less so for women than men\n\n4 ways to manage your company\u2019s \u201cemotional culture\u201d\n\nWegovy and Ozempic: Are we ready for weight loss drugs?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nWegovy and Ozempic: Are we ready for weight loss drugs?\n\nIn 2023, men were 4.5 percentage points more satisfied than women overall with\ntheir work. Women reported lower satisfaction across 24 of 26 of the\nsubcategories used by the Conference Board. The largest gaps between men and\nwomen in satisfaction among those categories were related to the financial\nbenefits of work, with bonuses having the largest disparity. That was followed\nby potential for career growth, health benefits (including mental health\npolicies), and wages.\n\nCultural factors also deepened the satisfaction gap, with women substantially\nless satisfied than their male counterparts by the recognition they receive,\nperformance reviews, and the quality of leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWomen were only slightly (0.1 percentage points) more satisfied with their\ncommute and interest in their work.\n\nWomen made up almost half of the U.S. workforce as of March 2023, according to\nthe U.S. Government Accountability Office. Yet many are still making less than\ntheir male counterparts for the same work. On average, women working full-\ntime, year-round are paid 83.7% of what men are paid \u2014 and the pay gap becomes\neven wider for Black and Hispanic women, according to the Department of Labor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## A growing dissatisfaction with work\n\nOverall job satisfaction grew slightly in 2023, ticking up to 62.7% from 62.3%\nfrom a year earlier. There was, however, a year-over-year decrease in all of\nthe subcomponents of job satisfaction compared for both men and women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe largest declines in 2023 were also in financial benefits \u2014 like bonuses,\nhard base benefits, wages, and promotions \u2014 which the Conference Board\nsuggests could mean workers are feeling the pinch of inflation.\n\nThe average annual percentage change in wages for all workers rose to 8.3% in\n2022, but dropped off to 7% in 2023, according to data from the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis. That means that while wages continued to grow last\nyear, they did so at a slower pace than a year earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## The grass isn\u2019t always greener\n\nThe Conference Board also found that people who left their jobs during the\npandemic in search of new employers are now less satisfied overall than those\nwho stayed in their jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese \u201cjob switchers\u201d reported an overall job satisfaction 5.6 percentage\npoints lower than the \u201cjob stayers,\u201d according to the report. And in 15 of the\n26 subcategories, those who switched jobs were less satisfied. Chief among\nthese was a far lower satisfaction with the leadership and culture in their\nnew jobs.\n\nMore than one-third of Americans changed jobs between 2020 and 2022, in search\nof better pay, according to a 2022 PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll. The tight\nlabor market drove workers in search of better wages and benefits to the job\nboard, where they were able to exercise new-found power in the market to\nsecure higher-paying positions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, it was found that many were reaping the benefits \u2014 at least\nfinancially. A majority of workers who moved to new jobs between April 2021\nand March 2022 saw a year-over-year increase in their real earnings, a Pew\nResearch Center poll published in July 2022 found.\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
