But it is\nawfully hard to get rid of because it appears to follow immediately from two\nprinciples that are intuitive:\n\n  1. If we can prove that AA is true, then we can prove that at least one of AA or BB is true. (In symbols, A\u2192(A\u2228B)A\u2192(A\u2228B).)\n  2. If we can prove that at least one of AA or BB is true, and we can prove that AA is false, then we may conclude that that BB is true. (Symbolically, (A\u2228B)\u2192(\u00acA\u2192B)(A\u2228B)\u2192(\u00acA\u2192B).).\n\nThen suppose that we have proved that PP is both true and false. Since we have\nproved PP true, we have proved that at least one of PP or QQ is true. But\nbecause we have also proved that PP is false, we may conclude that QQ is true.\nQ.E.D.This proof is as simple as can be. If you want to get rid of this, you\nhave a hard road ahead of you. You have to follow Graham Priest into the\nwilderness of paraconsistent logic.Raymond Smullyan observes that although\nlogic is supposed to model ordinary reasoning, it really falls down here.\nNobody, on discovering the fact that they hold contradictory beliefs, or even\na false one, concludes that therefore they must believe everything. In fact,\nsays Smullyan, almost everyone does hold contradictory beliefs. His argument\ngoes like this:\n\n  1. Consider all the things I believe individually, B1,B2,...B1,B2,.... I believe each of these, considered separately, is true.\n  2. However, I also believe that I'm not infallible, and that at least one of B1,B2,...B1,B2,... is false, although I don't know which ones.\n  3. Therefore I believe both \u22c0Bi\u22c0Bi (because I believe each of the BiBi separately) and \u00ac\u22c0Bi\u00ac\u22c0Bi (because I believe that not all the BiBi are true).\n\nAnd therefore, by the principle of explosion, I ought to believe that I\nbelieve absolutely everything.Well anyway, none of that was exactly what I\nplanned to write about. I was pleased because I noticed a very simple,\nspecific example of something I believed that was clearly inconsistent. Today\nI learned that K2, the second-highest mountain in the world, is in Asia, near\nthe border of Pakistan and westernmost China. I was surprised by this, because\nI had thought that K2 was in Kenya somewhere.But I also knew that the highest\nmountain in Africa was Kilimanjaro. So my simultaneous beliefs were flatly\ncontradictory:\n\n  1. K2 is the second-highest mountain in the world.\n  2. Kilimanjaro is not the highest mountain in the world, but it is the highest mountain in Africa\n  3. K2 is in Africa\n\nWell, I guess until this morning I must have believed everything![Other\narticles in category /math/logic] permanent link\n\n", "frontpage": false}
