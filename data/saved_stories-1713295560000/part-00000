It covers hundreds of\nmillions of Google users from 2014 through 2023 when the settlement was\npreliminarily approved.\n\nThese users of Google services qualify as Class members because Google\nallegedly tracked their locations when using Android and iOS devices even when\nthey'd disabled Location History in their account settings.\n\nBut due to the purported impracticality of identifying and paying pennies to\nmillions of people whose privacy was violated, the settlement proposed\nawarding the funds cy pres \u2013 French for \"as near as possible\" \u2013 to 21\nnonprofit organizations, after $18 million is allocated to pay attorneys' fees\nand the small number of named plaintiffs receive $5,000 each.\n\nFor example, the settlement proposal calls for the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and\nTechnology Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation to receive $6\nmillion each, and for Georgetown Law, Harvard, MIT, and Yale to each receive\n$1.5 million, among other beneficiaries.\n\nThe idea is that paying these organizations represents the best practical\nremedy to Google's behavior, because the groups support privacy through their\neducation and policy work.\n\nLast month, however, and in a subsequent filing last week, attorney Theodore\nFrank, of the nonprofit Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute, urged the court to\nreject the settlement proposal, noting that it's quite feasible to pay\nmillions of plaintiffs.\n\nFrank has helped make that happen: He previously urged the rejection of a cy\npres settlement in another Google privacy claim (In Google Referrer Header\nPrivacy Litigation), and helped to get $23 million directed to class members.\nGiven a 1.3 percent claim rate, that resulted in $7.70 being paid each to more\nthan 2 million claims who would otherwise have gotten nothing.\n\nWith regard to the Location History case, Frank argued in a filing [PDF] last\nweek that the organizations receiving the money \"engage in work that a\nsubstantial percentage of the class would not want to support (such as 'racial\njustice' \u2013 a codeword for support for racial discrimination and anti-Semitic\npolicies \u2013 and promoting abortion).\"\n\n  * What's up with AI lately? Let's start with soaring costs, public anger, regulations...\n  * British watchdog has 'real concerns' about the staggering love-in between cloud giants and AI upstarts\n  * 96% of US hospital websites share visitor info with Meta, Google, data brokers\n  * US legislators propose American Privacy Rights Act - and it looks quite good\n\nEssentially, he's arguing that those in the settlement Class with conservative\nviews are not being represented adequately if the funds go to organizations\nthat support progressive causes.\n\nHe also objects that some of these organizations focus only on a narrow subset\nof people affected by Google's tracking, \"(e.g., computer science\nundergraduates or 'historically marginalized communities').\"\n\nWhat's more, Frank contends that many of the organizations that would benefit\nfrom Google's funds have prior relationships that raises questions about\nconflict of interest.\n\n\"Multiple attorneys from the law firms litigating the case sit on the boards\nof the proposed recipients,\" he asserts in a March filing [PDF]. He also\npoints out that the lead law firm handling the case, Lieff Cabraser Heimann &\nBernstein, LLP, has worked with the two proposed settlement recipients, the\nElectronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nWhat's more, he contends, because Google already gives to several of the\ndesignated cy pres organizations, the value of the settlement is less than it\nappears: \"this is merely a shift in accounting entries, with no evidence that\nthe cy pres is not displacing donations Google would already make.\"\n\n\"The fundamental problem is that the money belongs to the class, which has not\nconsented to have $40-$50 million of its money given away to friends of the\nplaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and often ideological organizations,\" Frank told The\nRegister in an email.\n\n\"If a lawyer is representing an odious billionaire (call him Monty Burns) and\ndecides to divert a few million dollars of his client's money to a nonprofit\nbecause the lawyer feels the nonprofit will spend it better than the\nbillionaire would, the lawyer would go to jail for embezzlement and be\ndisbarred. There shouldn't be an exception just because the clients here\naren\u2019t billionaires.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs pursuing the settlement have been allowed to file a response\nbut have not yet done so.\n\nA hearing on the objection to the proposed settlement is scheduled for\nThursday, April 18, 2024. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Google\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Google\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * App stores\n  * Chrome\n  * Chromium\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * Google I/O\n  * Google Nest\n  * G Suite\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Pixel\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Tavis Ormandy\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Alphabet\n  * Search Engine\n\n#### More about\n\n7 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Google\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Google\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * App stores\n  * Chrome\n  * Chromium\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * Google I/O\n  * Google Nest\n  * G Suite\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Pixel\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Tavis Ormandy\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Alphabet\n  * Search Engine\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Google will delete data collected from 'private' browsing\n\nDeclares victory in settlement of class action lawsuit, but individual claims\nremain possible\n\nPersonal Tech15 days | 30\n\n#### Google One VPN axed for everyone but Pixel loyalists ... for now\n\nAnother one bytes the dust\n\nPersonal Tech4 days | 7\n\n#### Google joins the custom server CPU crowd with Arm-based Axion chips\n\nCloud Next Neoverse V2 cores available in GCP later this year\n\nSystems7 days |\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Google sues app devs, claims they're Play Store crypto scammers with\n100k+ victims\n\nThe pair allegedly made 87 apps since 2019 and defrauded folks of tens of\nthousands of dollars\n\nApplications11 days | 20\n\n#### Japan turns up heat on Apple, Google with threat of hefty fines\n\nAntitrust proposals could stretch to 30% of annual revenues for law-breaking\napp store monopolies\n\nApplications22 hrs | 3\n\n#### Google bakes new cookie strategy that will leave crooks with a bad taste\n\nDevice Bound Session Credentials said to render cookie theft useless\n\nSecurity13 days | 27\n\n#### Microsoft's playdate in Google's Privacy Sandbox gets messy\n\nAnalysis Targeted ads in Edge may be blocked before they even arrive\n\nApplications12 days | 6\n\n#### Google ponders making AI search a premium option\n\nAd-free search experience might not be on the cards\n\nAI + ML12 days | 20\n\n#### AI spam is winning the battle against search engine quality\n\ninterview 'Not all AI content is spam, but I think right now all spam is AI\ncontent'\n\nAI + ML3 days | 32\n\n#### Google plunks down $1 billion for extra Japan-US submarine cable\n\nAdds Hawaii stopover for another planned link\n\nNetworks5 days | 7\n\n#### Next Vision, or Vision Next?
