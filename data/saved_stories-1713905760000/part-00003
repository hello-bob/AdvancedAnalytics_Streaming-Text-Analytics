The borders have come to a standstill; the conflict on\nland is largely a stalemate. However, Ukraine has achieved a massive victory\nin the naval theatre.\n\nMap of the current situation in Ukraine\n\nYou might wonder how this is possible if Ukraine doesn\u2019t have a navy. During\nthe 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea, Russia captured a vast majority of\nUkrainian warships, leaving Ukraine virtually navy-less.\n\nThe Kremlin naturally thought of this as a significant advantage. At the\nbeginning of the invasion, Russia had 74 surface vessels and 6 submarines.\nMany of these vessels were brought in specially for the invasion from other\ntheatres (e.g. the Pacific and Arctic). This was important as Russia knew that\nthe Turkish straits (the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles), which served as the\nonly entry point into the Black Sea from the Aegean Sea, would be blocked by\nTurkey (a NATO member). Thus, Russia wanted to prepare a huge fleet from the\nget-go as they wouldn\u2019t be able to reinforce it during the war. This naval\nfleet was led by the Moskva, a cruiser that served as the flagship of the\nRussian Black Sea navy.\n\nTurkish straits\n\nThe Ukrainian navy paled in comparison to the Russian Black Sea fleet. Ukraine\nonly had a flagship (the frigate Hetman Sahaydachniy) and 4 small corvettes.\n\nHowever, this didn\u2019t matter, as Ukraine managed to sink more than 25 Russian\nwarships. Apart from a few smaller boats, Ukraine only lost 1 of their\ncorvettes (which was most likely decommissioned).\n\nHow did they do this? Using innovative tactics and modern technology!\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the different weapons Ukraine has used to destroy Russian\nwarships.\n\n##\n\n1\\. Anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs)\n\nYes, in the early days of the Russian invasion, Ukraine used anti-tank guided\nmissiles (ATGMs) to destroy Russian warships. As the name suggests, anti-tank\nguided missiles are used to destroy tanks and other land-based heavily\narmoured vehicles. These can be shoulder-launched (operated by a single\nsoldier) or tripod-mounted (operated by a squad of soldiers). In the Russo-\nUkrainian war, the Ukrainian Skif ATGMs, the American FGM-148 Javelin anti-\ntank missiles, the British NLAW ATGMs and the German Panzerfaust 3 disposable\nanti-tank rocket-propelled grenade launchers have been used.\n\nAn Ukrainian Skif missile\n\n##\n\n2\\. Tactical ballistic missiles\n\nThe Ukrainians have primarily used the OTR-21 Tochka-U missile, which is a\nSoviet-era tactical ballistic missile. Tactical ballistic missiles are used to\ndestroy short-range (up to 120 km) targets on battlefields (e.g. ports,\nairbases, barracks and supply depots). This missile was introduced in military\nservice by the Soviets in 1989 (an earlier variant called just the Tochka was\nintroduced in 1975). The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)\nreported that Ukraine had 500 OTR-21 Tochka-U missiles in 2022.\n\nOTR-21 Tochka-U missile systems at a Russian parade\n\n##\n\n3\\. Anti-ship and cruise missiles\n\nAnti-ship and cruise missiles have been one of the most important weapons\nemployed by Ukraine to destroy the Russian Black Sea fleet. Ukraine\u2019s arsenal\nof these missiles consists of American Harpoon missiles (in operation since\n1977), Franco-British Storm Shadow missiles (in operation since 2003) and\ntheir own R-360 Neptune missiles (in operation since 2021). The Neptune\nmissiles have been particularly useful; as they have been recently developed,\nthey are the most technologically advanced. Their long range of 200-300 km\nalso made them extremely critical in many Ukrainian operations.\n\nAmerican Harpoon anti-ship missile\n\nFranco-British Storm Shadow cruise missile\n\nUkrainian Neptune anti-ship and cruise missile\n\n##\n\n4\\. Drones\n\nAerial and sea drones have played a crucial role in the Ukrainian attack on\nthe Russian Black Sea fleet. Aerial drones are known as Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles (UAVs) in military terms. Similarly, sea drones are known as Unmanned\nSurface Vehicles (USVs). The Ukrainians have used the Turkish Bayraktar TB2\nUAVs (in operation since 2014) and their own MAGURA V5 USVs (in operation\nsince 2023).\n\nTurkish Bayraktar TB2 UAV\n\nUkrainian MAGURA V5 USV\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at some of the heaviest naval losses the Russians have\nincurred in the Black Sea.\n\n##\n\n1\\. 5 patrol boats\n\nOn 22 March 2022, a video was posted on the internet of a Russian Raptor-class\npatrol boat getting destroyed by an ATGM. The boat was severely damaged and\nhad to be towed away to the Russian Black Sea naval headquarters at\nSevastopol. In the first week of May 2022, 4 more Russian patrol boats\nstationed near Snake Island (in Ukraine) were attacked by Ukraine using the\nTurkish Bayraktar TB2 UAVs. 3 were sunk and one had to be taken to Sevastopol\nfor repairs.\n\nRussian Raptor-class patrol boat\n\nSnake Island, Ukraine\n\n##\n\n2\\. The Saratov\n\nThe Saratov was a Tapir-class landing ship. It was stationed in the Port of\nBerdyansk, which the Russians had captured on 26 February 2022. Almost a month\nlater on 24 March, the Ukrainians attacked the port using OTR-21 Tochka-U\ntactical ballistic missiles. The Saratov subsequently caught on fire and\neventually sank. The Novocherkassk and Tsezar Kunikov landing ships were\ndamaged and had to be taken back to Sevastopol, after which they were made\noperational again. However, this was short-lived, as the Novocherkassk was\nsunk in 2023 and the Tsezar Kunikov was destroyed in 2024.\n\nThe Saratov in 2007\n\nThe Saratov on fire and the Novocherkassk and Tsezar Kunikov fleeing to\nSevastopol\n\nThe location of Berdyansk\n\n##\n\n3\\. The Moskva\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva was the biggest triumph for Ukraine and the most\ndevastating loss for Russia in the Black Sea naval theatre. The Moskva was a\nguided missile cruiser, arguably the second most important type of warship\n(only behind the aircraft carrier). Guided missile cruisers are used to\nachieve air and sea superiority (also known as command of the sea), which can\ndecide the outcome of battles and wars. The Moskva was critical in the Russian\ntakeover of Snake Island on 24 February 2022. Ukraine wanted to regain control\nof Snake Island, and they believed sinking the Moskva would be integral in\ndoing so.\n\nAs this was in the early stages of the war, Ukraine didn\u2019t have much\nexperience in sinking Russian warships, especially not guided missile cruisers\nsuch as the Moskva. The Ukrainians decided to gamble with their Neptune\nmissiles. On 3 April, the Ukrainians had damaged the Russian frigate Admiral\nEssen using their Neptune missiles, so it wasn\u2019t a complete gamble. Still, the\nwhole operation was a big risk.\n\nOn 13 April, two Neptune missiles were fired at the Moskva, which was moving\n150 km south of the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. The ship caught on fire and\nsome ammunition on board exploded. A few hours later, it sank.\n\nThis was a huge victory as Ukraine had sunk a moving target. Thus, they could\nnow sink/damage stationary and moving targets.\n\nThe Moskva was the largest warship the Russians had lost since World War 2.\nThe Ukrainians enjoyed their victory so much that they declared the wreckage\nof the Moskva to be an underwater cultural heritage site!\n\nSnake Island would be recaptured by the Ukrainians shortly after.\n\nThe Moskva in 2012\n\n##\n\n4\\. The Rostov-on-Don and the Minsk\n\nOn 13 September 2023, Ukraine launched an air-raid on Sevastopol with Storm\nShadow missiles. The Kilo-class submarine Rostov-on-Don and the landing ship\nMinsk were greatly damaged by the attack. The Kremlin has declared that they\nwould repair the ships, but they remain inoperative to this day.\n\nThe Rostov-on-Don in 2014\n\nThe Minsk in 2011\n\n##\n\n5\\. The Ivanovets\n\nThe sinking of the Tarantul-class corvette Ivanovets is one of the most recent\nUkrainian \u201cnaval\u201d victories in the Black Sea. On 1 February 2024, Ukraine\nreleased a video which showed them sinking the Ivanovets stationed in Lake\nDonuzlav (west of Crimea) using their MAGURA V5 USVs.\n\nThe Ivanovets in 2012\n\nLocation of Lake Donuzlav/Donuzlav Gulf\n\n##\n\nAftermath\n\nIn recent land battles, Ukraine has regained a lot of their south-western\ncoastline, including the port city of Odesa. Thus, the deadly combination of\ntheir long-range Neptune missiles and ability to launch UAVs and USVs off of\ntheir coastline has given Ukraine the power to strike the headquarters of the\nRussian Black Sea navy\u2014Sevastopol (which they have done multiple times now).\nThe western Black Sea is under Ukraine\u2019s control and Russia knows this.\n\nThus, Russia has shifted the headquarters of their Black Sea navy from\nSevastopol to Novorossiysk, which is a port in Russia proper. Although Russia\nhas not announced this formally, the shifting of Russia\u2019s remaining warships\nfrom Sevastopol to Novorossiysk makes it the de facto headquarters of the\nBlack Sea navy. But, they may not be done yet. Local leaders in Abkhazia (a\nRussian-occupied territory in Georgia which they captured in 2008) have\nrevealed plans showing that Russia wants to relocate their Black Sea navy\nheadquarters to the port of Ochamchire in Abkhazia.\n\nThere are many advantages for The Kremlin to relocate to Ochamchire.\nOchamchire has a larger natural harbour than Novorossiysk (allowing more ships\nto be stored there). Moreover, Russia would be able to launch attacks into\nUkraine from Georgia, which the Ukrainians can do very little about as\nAbkhazia is out of the range of their missiles and drones.\n\nPort of Sevastopol\n\nPort of Novorossiysk\n\nPort of Ochamchire\n\nHowever, this decision could have a much larger motive. Georgia has been\nbuilding a deep sea port on the Black Sea called Anaklia, which can\npotentially serve as a key checkpoint between oil and gas from Asia (from\ncountries like Azerbaijan) and Europe. This plan to make a new route for the\ntransfer of energy from Asia to Europe is known as the \u201cMiddle Corridor\u201d.\nRussia likely wants to undermine the construction of this port to maintain the\nflow of Asian oil and gas through Russian territory (which is the case today\nas part of the \u201cNorthern Corridor\u201d).\n\nNorthern Corridor, proposed Middle Corridor and Ocean Route\n\n##\n\nConclusion\n\nThe destruction of more than 25 Russian warships in the Black Sea by a country\nvirtually without a navy begs the question: is having a navy useless?\n\nWell, the Russo-Ukrainian war would point to yes. Here are the unit costs of\nsome of the weapons used by Ukraine ($USD):\n\n  1. FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile: $240,000 for export\n\n  2. OTR-21 Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile: $300,000\n\n  3. Harpoon anti-ship missile: ~$1.4 million\n\n  4. Storm Shadow cruise missile: $2.5 million\n\n  5. Bayraktar TB2 UAV: ~$2 million\n\n  6. MAGURA V5 USV: $273,000\n\nSome of these might seem very expensive, but compared to warships, it\u2019s\npeanuts.\n\nHere are the unit costs of some of the warships mentioned ($USD, adjusted for\ninflation):\n\n  1. Raptor-class patrol boat: $2.1 million\n\n  2. Ivan Gren-class landing ship (the next version of Tapir-class ships like the Saratov): $160 million\n\n  3. Ropucha-class landing ship (the Novocherkassk, the Tsezar Kunikov and the Minsk): $675 million\n\n  4. The Moskva: $750 million\n\n  5. The Rostov-on-Don: $300 million\n\n  6. The Ivanovets: $60-70 million\n\nAs you can see, the weapons employed by Ukraine are an extremely cost-\neffective way to sink/destroy warships costing up to hundreds of millions.\nThis data would suggest that having a navy in 2024 is useless. But, I think\nthat\u2019s not necessarily the case.\n\nI think the most important ship, the aircraft carrier, still holds immense\nvalue. Aircraft carriers are essential in achieving air superiority during\namphibious invasions. An aircraft carrier can be sent to faraway theatres of\nwar, where it can launch fighters and bombers to carry out airstrikes on the\nbattlefield. Submarines can be sent to the middle of oceans to destroy\nwarships. Other warships like cruisers and battleships can be used to block\nchokepoints (e.g. what Turkey has done with the Turkish straits to prohibit\nmore Russian warships from entering the Black Sea). If naval vessels are\nfitted with accurate anti-missile and anti-drone systems, a lot of this damage\ncan be avoided, and navies can function normally. But, these systems can be\nexpensive. Take the example of India. The Indian navy is planning on\ninstalling anti-drone systems in warships like the INS Vikramaditya and INS\nVikrant. This has cost them about USD 60 million.\n\nHowever, I think the usage of cheap missiles and drones to effectively destroy\nwarships has changed war forever. Amphibious landings are going to be a lot\nmore difficult now, as landing ships and warships supporting the landing ships\ncan be destroyed cheaply, effectively and quickly (unless fitted with\nexpensive protective systems).\n\nIt would be interesting to see the impact of this tactic on the likely\nimminent Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The USA can supply Taiwan with some of\ntheir UAVs and USVs. If Taiwan employs a similar strategy to Ukraine, can they\nprevent the Chinese from ever stepping foot on Taiwanese soil?\n\nI don\u2019t know what the future holds, but I\u2019m certain that war will never be the\nsame.\n\n### Subscribe to Back To Sifar\n\nBy Sifar Jirgale \u00b7 Launched 3 years ago\n\nInteresting global events related to geopolitics covered by an enthusiast in\nhigh school :)\n\n5 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n5\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How Ukraine, a country without a navy, destroyed 25+ Russian warships\n\nbacktosifar.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nIndia's population is growing too rapidly?
