CalMatters CEO Neil Chase still says \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen\nenough yet.\u201d\n\nBy Sarah Scire @SarahScire April 25, 2024, 10:37 a.m.\n\nApril 25, 2024, 10:37 a.m.\n\nThe nonprofit newsrooms CalMatters and The Markup announced last week that\nthey were joining forces. CalMatters, founded in 2015, is an established\nstatewide newsroom, while the 4-year-old Markup focuses on technology and\nstories that are national \u2014 even global \u2014 in scope.\n\nNabiha Syed, chief executive officer of The Markup, said the idea of a merger\nor acquisition had been on her mind \u201cin a general way\u201d for some time before\ntalks began with CalMatters.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\n\u201cBig tech is watching you. Who\u2019s watching big tech?\u201d The Markup is finally\nready for liftoff\n\nSarah Scire\n\nFebruary 25, 2020\n\n\u201cWe live in this industry. We all know the reality. We know that we have to be\nefficient and really effective with our resources,\u201d Syed said. \u201cMergers [can\nmake] good business sense if the partners are a good fit. And that\u2019s always\nthe big question: \u2018Are the partners a good fit?'\u201d\n\nOne specific catalyst was seeing Markup stories resonate locally \u2014 especially\nin California, home to many of the tech companies that The Markup covers.\n(Syed hailed editor-in-chief Sisi Wei\u2018s \u201cvisionary leadership\u201d in finding\npartners for The Markup\u2019s stories and publishing \u201cstory recipes\u201d that help\nlocal outlets find disparities in internet offers by neighborhood, investigate\ncensorship in schools, and see if their city is using flawed homeless\nvulnerability scoring systems.) The other was finding the right match.\n\n\u201cWe saw that our work really hit a chord when it was rooted in a local place,\u201d\nSyed said. \u201cThen the question was, well, intellectually this could make sense\n\u2014 it could definitely make sense on the local level \u2014 but who\u2019s the right\npartner? Who\u2019s innovative, who\u2019s stable, who would be interested?\u201d\n\nThe Markup \u2014 which has published tools and investigations into Amazon,\nFacebook, Uber, health care companies, local governments, and more \u2014 was also\nseeking an organization that was fiercely independent.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\nIs Facebook too big to know? The Markup has a plan (and a browser) to wrap its\narms around it\n\nJoshua Benton\n\nOctober 19, 2020\n\n\u201cWe have a very particular approach to editorial independence, because we know\nthat our stories can sometimes take on real centers of power,\u201d Syed said. \u201cWe\nwanted to know that we were going to a place that shared not just tolerance\nfor editorial independence, but that it\u2019s, like, what helps you get out of bed\nin the morning.\u201d\n\nEnter CalMatters.\n\nCalMatters chief executive officer Neil Chase said he and his friend David\nBoardman were \u201cseveral drinks\u201d in after a joint Lenfest and Aspen Institute\nevent in Charleston last year when Boardman turned to him with an idea. \u201cI\njust realized \u2014 you\u2019re the perfect partner for The Markup,\u201d Boardman, who\nchairs the board at The Markup alongside other roles in news leadership, told\nChase.\n\nChase remembers that Boardman told him, \u201cWe\u2019ve had real success doing local\njournalism at a national scale.\u201d\n\nThe two talked about Markup reporting that had led to Los Angeles becoming the\nfirst city to outlaw digital discrimination by internet service providers.\n(The Markup\u2019s impact page is filled with entries about Federal Trade\nCommission policies, class-action lawsuits, and new legislation.) They also\ndiscussed how important state, local, and city governments will continue to be\nin shaping tech policy.\n\n\u201cThe more we looked at it, the more it made sense,\u201d Chase said. \u201cTechnology\npolicy is the biggest story that the world is watching California for right\nnow. These are things that affect everybody. It is all coming out of\nCalifornia and we\u2019re in a great position to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe magic is that the way that The Markup investigates, they collect data and\nthey build tools,\u201d Chase added. \u201cThe way they report is going to help every\none of our beats \u2014 not just technology.\u201d\n\nWhat else did CalMatters want to know about the potential acquisition? Chase\nsaid the nonprofit looked over The Markup\u2019s books for \u201canything surprising\u201d as\npart of its due diligence. Chase was also interested in who was backing The\nMarkup financially.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the funding lists. We have different sets of funders; there\u2019s\nonly a couple of funders that overlap. This opens the door for us to funders\nwho haven\u2019t supported us yet and it helps our funders have access to\nsupporting this new work,\u201d Chase said. \u201cWhen you put two organizations\ntogether, if the funding streams are different, you put the two streams\ntogether. That\u2019s a powerful financial story, as opposed to the other way\naround, if all the same people are supporting you.\u201d\n\nCalMatters, like The Markup and many other nonprofit outlets, relies primarily\non foundations and major donors to fund its journalism. In 2022, half of\nCalMatters\u2019 revenue came from foundation grants, with another 42% coming from\ngifts from major donors. (Just 5% of revenue came from memberships \u2014 which\nstart at $10/month if you want a tote bag \u2014 and 3% from corporate\nsponsorships.) As Chase put it, \u201cthe nonprofit business is relentless, nonstop\nfundraising.\u201d\n\nBefore committing to merging with The Markup, Chase spoke to some backers.\n\n\u201cIt does take a minute to explain: how do a national and a local organization\nget together \u2014 and why does that makes sense? But we told the story to a\nnumber of The Markup\u2019s current supporters and the response was universally:\n\u2018That sounds really smart\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing that.\u2019 I think if their\nsupporters had said \u2018That sounds crazy\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s a bad idea,\u2019 then we would\nhave rethought it,\u201d Chase said. \u201cSo, the diligence is partially studying their\nbooks and their corporate documents and all that. But it\u2019s also taking the\ntemperature of the people who make it possible and saying, \u2018Do you think this\nis a good idea?'\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a recent uptick in consolidation in nonprofit news, and the\nindustry might just be at the beginning. Chase, for one, believes \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink we\u2019ve seen enough yet.\u201d States Newsroom acquired Pew\u2019s Stateline.\nThere\u2019s been nonprofit mergers in New Jersey, Colorado, and Chicago. Mother\nJones merged with the Center for Investigative Reporting late last year. And\nthe Center for Public Integrity, facing layoffs and turmoil in leadership,\nexplored merging with other news organizations, including The Markup.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\nWhat happened when the Chicago Sun-Times freed the news\n\nJane Elizabeth\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\nThe benefits of joining forces boil down to something like this: it\u2019s simply\ntoo expensive to run all these different nonprofit news companies. Industry\nleaders hope that by sharing line items like payroll, technology, and\nbusiness-side positions, they can conserve resources and put their business\nmodels on firmer, more sustainable ground.\n\n\u201cI think consolidation is natural. I think it\u2019s important. And I think you\u2019re\ngoing to see more of it where it makes sense,\u201d Chase explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not like\n[CalMatters] is in a position to go roll up a bunch of companies or anything.\nThis one-off made sense for us because both companies are in pretty good shape\n\u2014 as good as a nonprofit could be. It\u2019s not a bail-somebody-out-who\u2019s-in-\ntrouble situation and I don\u2019t know that we could fix somebody else\u2019s\nsituation. This is two organizations that would have been okay on their own\nbut I think will be better off together.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition will result in \u201ca single integrated newsroom\u201d led by the\ncurrent leadership team at CalMatters \u2014 Chase as CEO and Kristen Go as editor-\nin-chief \u2014 with Wei taking on the new title of chief impact officer and Syed\ndeparting for a yet-to-be-announced external role this summer. Currently,\nCalMatters has 72 employees and The Markup has 28, roughly half of whom live\nin New York. CalMatters will not force employees to relocate but will offer\nhelp to staff who do want to make the move, Chase said. Both newsrooms are\nunionized with NewsGuild.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\n\u201cA bigger focus on the human impact of technology\u201d: Sisi Wei is The Markup\u2019s\nnew editor-in-chief\n\nHanaa' Tameez\n\nAugust 2, 2022\n\n\u201cWhat I find really unique about this merger is that it is the coming together\nof a national organization and a local organization. I have not seen a combo\nlike this, personally, in the industry,\u201d Wei said.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE\n\nA journalistic lesson for an algorithmic age: Let the scientific method be\nyour guide\n\nJulia Angwin, The Markup\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nHow \u2014 and how well \u2014 the newsrooms will blend is a good question. Though both\noutlets fall under the broad category of accountability journalism, The\nMarkup\u2019s reach is much smaller, according to statistics from SimilarWeb, and\nits budget smaller.\n\nThe Markup\u2019s audience is also much more targeted. The newsroom\u2019s published\nworks \u2014 often accompanied by code, data sets, and statistical analysis \u2014\nevince what can only be described as a zeal for methodology. \u201cWe invite\nacademics, journalists, policymakers, consumer activists, and community\norganizers to engage with our findings,\u201d The Markup\u2019s About page reads, \u201cafter\nall, this is for you.\u201d\n\nChase said Markup reporters will be able to continue to work on stories that\nare national in scope. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t not do a story because it\u2019s not 100%\nCalifornia,\u201d he said.\n\nOther aspects of the transition are yet to be decided, however. Take the issue\nof digital privacy, the target of some of The Markup\u2019s most celebrated\ninvestigations and tools. Since Syed and former editor-in-chief Julia Angwin\nlaunched The Markup in 2020, the news org has made explicit privacy promises\nto its readers.\n\n\u201cWe will not expose you to third-party tracking. We will collect as little\npersonal information about you as possible. And we will never monetize this\ndata,\u201d The Markup\u2019s About page reads. \u201cThis makes our work more complicated\nand more expensive, which is tough for a nonprofit\u2014but your privacy is worth\nit.\u201d\n\nThe promises have made The Markup an outlier in the news industry. (The\nnewsroom rejected eight different email providers before finding one that\ncould be custom-built to send without user-tracking.) The Markup says it has\nnot displayed advertisements on its site \u201cbecause they so often contain\ntracking technology\u201d and does not \u201cshare, loan, trade, rent, or sell donor\ninformation to third parties.\u201d\n\nChase said that the privacy policy came up when he and editor-in-chief Kristen\nGo held an open house for Markup staff to ask questions after the acquisition\nwas announced.\n\n\u201cMy answer was that I really respect that and I admire it. At the same time,\nwe use the data we collect to give readers a better experience. If you\u2019re\ngetting a newsletter, I\u2019d like to not offer you that newsletter subscription\nwhen you come in. If you\u2019re a member, I\u2019d like to know that and put different\nmessaging on the screen. If you live a mile from we\u2019re going to have an event\ntomorrow, I\u2019d like to invite you to the event,\u201d Chase said. \u201cSo I said to\nthem, that\u2019s one of the several things that we haven\u2019t figured out yet.\u201d\n\nMarkup reporters also asked CalMatters leadership about maintaining the\neditorial independence they\u2019ve become accustomed to.\n\n\u201cIn response, Neil, very poignantly, said something like \u2018I would love to have\narguments with funders because if we\u2019re not making people mad, we\u2019re not doing\nour job,'\u201d Wei recounted. \u201cI feel good in terms of having a very clear answer:\nour editorial independence is intact, and nothing is going to change there.\u201d\n\nSarah Scire is deputy editor of Nieman Lab.
