While that function lets users turn off data\ncollection when using the Chrome browser, other Google tools used by websites,\nsuch as advertising technology, scoop up their data anyway, according to the\nsuit.\n\nGoogle, which agreed to settle in December, will expunge \u201cbillions\u201d of data\nrecords that reflect people\u2019s private browsing, according to details that were\nmade public Monday in a filing at San Francisco federal court. Google also\nsaid it made several changes to its disclosures to clarify how people\u2019s data\nis collected as well as what activity is visible to websites when users browse\nin \u201cincognito\u201d mode. And the company agreed for the next five years to allow\nincognito mode users to block third-party cookies.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to settle this lawsuit, which we always believed was\nmeritless,\u201d Jose Castaneda, Google spokesperson, said in a statement. \u201cWe\nnever associate data with users when they use incognito mode. We are happy to\ndelete old technical data that was never associated with an individual and was\nnever used for any form of personalization.\u201d\n\nWhile the plaintiffs asked for $5 billion in damages, the settlement includes\nno payment from Google. Instead, individuals will be able to pursue damages by\nfiling their own complaints against Google in U.S. state courts, according to\ncourt papers. About 50 people have already done so, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, led by attorney David Boies, called the settlement\n\u201cgroundbreaking\u201d and a \u201chistoric step\u201d in requiring big tech companies to be\ntransparent to users about how they collect and use their data. Google\u2019s\nagreement to retroactively delete user information is a significant concession\nas it forms the backbone of the company\u2019s lucrative advertising business,\nwhich depends on the quality of its search engine. It also comes as Google is\nin the throes of multiple regulatory challenges in the U.S. and abroad, amid\nrising concerns about how the tech giants use the vast amounts of data they\ncollect from users.\n\nRead More: Which Apps Collect My Personal Data and Should I Worry?\n\n\u201cThere has been a steady drumbeat of complaints, lawsuits, and regulatory\naction centered on companies collecting or sharing customer data in unexpected\nways,\u201d said Stephanie Liu, a senior analyst at Forrester. \u201cThe rise of\nprivacy-oriented class action lawsuits and complaints shows consumers are\nincreasingly privacy savvy and taking action.\"\n\nThe settlement provides \u201csubstantial relief\u201d for plaintiffs, according to\nrepresentatives of the consumers in the lawsuit, which include attorneys from\nthe law firms Boies Schiller Flexner and Morgan & Morgan.\n\nRead More: Google Will Stop Providing Law Enforcement Data on Which Users Were\nNear a Crime\n\nThe settlement also forestalled a trial that was scheduled for February, in a\nyear that\u2019s expected to be one of Google\u2019s busiest in the courts. A jury trial\nin a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department and a coalition of state\nattorneys general accusing the company of violating antitrust regulations by\nillegally monopolizing digital advertising is slated for September, and a\nsimilar lawsuit from Texas and other states challenging its ad tech practices\nhas been scheduled for March 2025.\n\nRead More: Why We Should Get Paid for Our Online Data\n\nIn a third case, a U.S. judge in Washington is set to hear closing arguments\nin May for a landmark federal antitrust trial that alleges the company has\nillegally monopolized the online search market.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * The 100 Most Influential People of 2024\n  * How Far Trump Would Go\n  * Scenes From Pro-Palestinian Encampments Across U.S. Universities\n  * Saving Seconds Is Better Than Hours\n  * Why Your Breakfast Should Start with a Vegetable\n  * 6 Compliments That Land Every Time\n  * Welcome to the Golden Age of Ryan Gosling\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
