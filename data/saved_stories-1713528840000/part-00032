In war, it\u2019s a tool that can be used for\ndeception, luring enemies into traps, or encouraging defection by mimicking\nthe voices of enemy soldiers.\n\nDubbed Ghost Machine, the tool helps Army Special Operations Forces\ninstructors teach operators how cheap, easily-available tech is reshaping\ngovernments\u2019 abilities to target and influence soldiers.\n\nThe basic idea behind Ghost Machine is not new\u2014armies have broadcast the\nvoices of collaborators to encourage allied surrender since at least World War\nII. In the 2010s, ARSOF members encouraged defections within Ugandan warlord\nJoseph Kony\u2019s force by broadcasting messages from members\u2019 families.\n\nBut those voice broadcasts required the physical presence and willing\nparticipation of the speaker. Now, an ARSOF soldier could theoretically copy\nan enemy\u2019s commander\u2019s voice from intercepted communications or public data,\nthen use it to trick an enemy into thinking their commander had been captured.\n\nThe main limitations are hardware and the quantity of data on which to train\nthe program, the instructor said, speaking at a stand displaying psychological\nwarfare technology during ARSOF\u2019s yearly capabilities exercise.\n\n\u201cIf you have less performing hardware, you need a little bit more data. If you\nhave high performing hardware, just a minute or 30 seconds [of audio] will do\nan outstanding job at cloning,\u201d said the instructor, who asked to go by his\nfirst name, Achilles, due to Army Special Operations policy.\n\nGhost Machine is particularly good at replicating the voice of a man who runs\na fake podcast for an ARSOF training scenario, thanks to the quantity of the\ndata, Achilles said.\n\n\u201cWe have gigabytes of his audio,\u201d Achilles said. \u201cWhen you use his voice in\n[Ghost Machine], it is perfect.\u201d The copy is so good, it even accurately\ncreates the breathing patterns and pauses of the podcaster, he added.\n\nStory Continues Below Sponsor Message\n\nStory Continues Below Sponsor Message\n\nIn one example loaded into the Ghost Machine, the program duplicated a\nfictional Chinese enemy commander telling his troops to surrender.\n\nAchilles couldn\u2019t speak to the accuracy of the automatic translation widget\nused to translate the English-language message into Chinese. However, he said\nits Spanish translation did a \u201creally good job\u201d based on his knowledge as a\nnative speaker.\n\nAchilles went through a special operations-funded project to train soldiers as\nsoftware designers, then later helped launch the project. It was designed by\none machine-learning engineer contractor, and took about six weeks from\ncreation to final product.\n\nThe main costs for the program were training Achilles and hiring the\ncontractor, he said. The program\u2019s interface is run off the open-source Gradio\napp, and its algorithms are powered by commercially available artificial\nintelligence models.\n\nA separate large language model used for exercises can create whole pieces of\ncontent\u2014such as a radio script\u2014based on the Republic of Pineland, the\nfictional country at the center of ARSOF\u2019s Robin Sage exercise, Achilles said.\n\nGetting audio in the right position for an enemy to hear it is another\nchallenge, but other ARSOF instructors said they\u2019re working on it.\n\nIn the past, units would set up speakers in the general direction of the enemy\nand pressing play. But that requires carting loudspeakers close to the front,\nand even then, the enemy may not hear the message if the speakers are not\nenormous.\n\nNow, instructors teach students how speakers slung from drones can be flown\ntoward enemy positions to blast messages, said Nathan, another soldier\ntraining ARSOF forces in psychological operations.\n\nOn display was a $40 speaker Nathan built out of car speaker parts\u2014a skill he\npicked up growing up, he said.\n\nThe combination of speakers and drones is in part a reflection of tactics seen\nin Ukraine, he added, referring to numerous instances of Russian soldiers\nsurrendering to Ukrainian drones. In one video, a Ukrainian drone drops\nsurrender instructions to a Russian soldier, who then follows the drone back\nto Ukrainian lines.\n\nThe example shows how combining technological advancements with time-tested\ntechniques\u2014 like dropping leaflets\u2014can work, said ARSOF psychological\noperations soldiers.\n\nAfter all, such drops require the U.S. to know the enemies\u2019 \u201cactual location,\u201d\nadding a level of intimidation, said George, another ARSOF soldier.\n\nShare This:\n\nNEXT STORY: Geothermal energy easing US military's logistics challenges\n\nMideast missile duels have cost US Navy nearly $1B, secretary says\n\nArmy recruiting on pace to hit goal\u2014and break a years-long streak\n\nThe Air Force is quietly revolutionizing parts replacement\n\nPentagon will use commercial space assets in military operations, under new\nplan\n\nMoscow attack shows growing reach of ISIS-K.
