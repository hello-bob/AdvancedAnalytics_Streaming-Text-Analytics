Mobile\nusers are now on the front lines of YouTube\u2019s war on ad-blockers, who have\npreviously slipped by the company\u2019s efforts to force you into watching its\nads. Instead, YouTube is once again encouraging users who want an ad-free\nexperience to shell out $13.99 a month for YouTube Premium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October, YouTube made it nearly impossible to watch its website while using\nan ad blocker. Users were presented with the message, \u201cVideo playback is\nblocked unless YouTube is allowlisted or the ad blocker is disabled.\u201d At the\ntime, the company claimed it had \u201claunched a global effort\u201d to encourage users\nto watch ads, a YouTube spokesperson told The Verge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYouTube\u2019s fight against ad blockers dates back to May 2023, when users first\nstarted noticing pop-ups stating \u201cAd blockers are not allowed on YouTube.\u201d At\nthe time, a YouTube spokesperson called this a \u201csmall experiment,\u201d but it\u2019s\nturned into an outright war against tools that make the Internet more\nbearable. However, ad-blocking tools were quietly allowed to circumnavigate\nYouTube\u2019s ads for years, so what changed?\n\nIn April 2023, Google reported a decline in ad revenue for its second straight\nquarter. Google\u2019s ad revenue has barely ever declined in the last 20 years, so\nalarm bells were surely going off at the company\u2019s headquarters. One month\nlater, YouTube\u2019s crackdown on ad blockers commenced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its Monday blog post, YouTube says ad blockers violate its terms of\nservice. This may be true, but the continued crackdown seems to have more to\ndo with protecting YouTube\u2019s bottom line than supporting its creator economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": true}
