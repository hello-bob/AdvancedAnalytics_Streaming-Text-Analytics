There has been much evidence showing that single FPGAs\n> can be competitive with GPUs in performance for some computations,\n> especially for low latency, and often much more efficient when power is\n> considered. This suggests that there is merit to exploring the use of\n> multiple FPGAs for large machine learning applications. The challenge with\n> using multiple FPGAs is that there is no commonly-accepted flow for\n> developing and deploying multi-FPGA applications, i.e., there are no tools\n> to describe a large application, map it to multiple FPGAs and then deploy\n> the application on a multi-FPGA platform. In this paper, we explore the\n> feasibility of implementing large transformers using multiple FPGAs by\n> developing a scalable multi-FPGA platform and some tools to map large\n> applications to the platform. We validate our approach by designing an\n> efficient multi-FPGA version of the I-BERT transformer and implement one\n> encoder using six FPGAs as a working proof-of-concept to show that our\n> platform and tools work. Based on our proof-of-concept prototype and the\n> estimations of performance using the latest FPGAs compared to GPUs, we\n> conclude that there can be a place for FPGAs in the world of large machine\n> learning applications. We demonstrate a promising first step that shows that\n> with the right infrastructure and tools it is reasonable to continue to\n> explore the possible benefits of using FPGAs for applications such as LLMs.\n\nComments:| 33 pages, 24 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Hardware Architecture (cs.AR); Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster\nComputing (cs.DC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.16158 [cs.AR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.16158v1 [cs.AR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16158arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Paul Chow [view email] [v1] Wed, 24 Apr 2024 19:25:58 UTC (861 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled The Feasibility of Implementing Large-Scale\nTransformers on Multi-FPGA Platforms, by Yu Gao and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.DC cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
