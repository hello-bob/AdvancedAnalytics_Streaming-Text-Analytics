I\u2019m excited about that,\u201d Bridges said on the Film Comment podcast,\nabout 29 minutes into that link. \u201c[Jared] Leto is the star of this third one.\nI\u2019m really anxious to work with him. I\u2019ve admired his work.\u201d It\u2019s definitely\nworth listening to the interview to hear Bridges reminisce about the white\nleotard he had to wear in Tron, as well as the motion capture tech he endured\nwhile being \u201cde-aged\u201d for Tron: Legacy (\u201cI didn\u2019t like the way I looked... I\nfelt like I looked more like Bill Maher than myself.

He reprised the role in\nthe sequel Tron: Legacy, both as the character 30 years later and a digital\nversion of him named Clu. Both characters appear to die at the end of the film\nbut it\u2019s not 100% definitive\u2014and we also know copies are easy to come by in a\ndigital world. io9 reached out to Disney for comment or clarification on the\nnews and has not heard back as of publication. The studio did, however,\nconfirm the casting news with this tweet:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about Tron: Ares since it won\u2019t be released until October\nof next year, but what little can gloss comes from the official description:\n\u201cTron: Ares follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the\ndigital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind\u2019s\nfirst encounter with AI beings.\u201d Leto is Ares and, as we saw in the first\nimage, he\u2019s a product of Dillinger, which was the name of the main adversary\nfor Flynn and his company, Encom.\n\nWhat this news does do is firmly link a story that is seemingly standalone\nwith the history and world of the previous movies. And that\u2019s an original 1984\ngrid helmet in the image, right? Is that some kind of tease?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll find out on October 10, 2025 when Tron: Ares hits theaters.\n\nWant more io9 news?
