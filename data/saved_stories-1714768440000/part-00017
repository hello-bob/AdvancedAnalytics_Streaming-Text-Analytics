The\nAmerican writer Meghan O\u2019Gieblyn also wonders about these things, and her\nessays offer pointed inquiries into the philosophical and spiritual\nunderpinnings of this technology. She\u2019s steeped in the latest AI developments\nbut is also well-versed in debates about linguistics and the nature of\nconsciousness.\n\nO\u2019Gieblyn also writes about her own struggle to find deeper meaning in her\nlife, which has led her down some unexpected rabbit holes. A former Christian\nfundamentalist, she later stumbled into transhumanism and, ultimately, plunged\ninto the exploding world of AI. (She currently also writes an advice column\nfor Wired magazine about tech and society.)\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWhen I visited her at her home in Madison, Wisconsin, I was curious if I might\nsee any traces of this unlikely personal odyssey.\n\nI hadn\u2019t expected her to pull out a stash of old notebooks filled with her\nautomatic writing, composed while working with a hypnotist. I asked O\u2019Gieblyn\nif she would read from one of her notebooks, and she picked this passage: \u201cIn\nall the times we came to bed, there was never any sleep. Dawn bells and\ndoorbells and daffodils and the side of the road glaring with their faces\nundone ...\u201d And so it went\u2014strange, lyrical, and nonsensical\u2014tapping into some\npart of herself that she didn\u2019t know was there.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThat led us into a wide-ranging conversation about the unconscious,\ncreativity, the quest for transcendence, and the differences between machine\nintelligence and the human mind.\n\nSINGULAR MIND: Writer Meghan O\u2019Gieblny grew up as a Christian fundamentalist.\nAs a young adult, she lost her faith in God and found the potential for\ntranscendence in a new realm. Photo courtesy of Meghan O\u2019Gieblyn.\n\nWhy did you go to a hypnotist and try automatic writing?\n\nI was going through a period of writer\u2019s block, which I had never really\nexperienced before. It was during the pandemic. I was working on a book about\ntechnology, and I was reading about these new language models. GPT-3 had been\njust released to researchers, and the algorithmic text was just so wildly\ncreative and poetic.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nSo you wanted to see if you could do this, without using an AI model?\n\nYeah, I became really curious about what it means to produce language without\nconsciousness. As my own critical faculty was getting in the way of my\ncreativity, it seemed really appealing to see what it would be like to just\nwrite without overthinking everything. I was thinking a lot about the\nSurrealists and different avant-garde traditions where writers or artists\nwould do exercises either through hypnosis or some sort of random\ncollaborative game. The point was to try to unlock some unconscious creative\ncapacity within you. And it seemed like that was, in a way, what the large\nlanguage models were doing.\n\nYou have an unusual background for a writer about technology. You grew up in a\nChristian fundamentalist family.\n\nMy parents were evangelical Christians. My whole extended family are born\nagain Christians. Everybody I knew growing up believed what we did. I was\nhomeschooled along with all my siblings, so most of our social life revolved\naround church. When I was 18, I went to Moody Bible Institute in Chicago to\nstudy theology. I was planning to go into full-time ministry.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nBut then you left your faith.\n\nI had a faith crisis when I was in Bible school, which metastasized into a\nseries of doubts about the validity of the Bible and the Christian God. I\ndropped out of Bible school after two years and pretty much left the faith. I\nbegan identifying as agnostic almost right away.\n\nBut my sense is you\u2019re still extremely interested in questions of\ntranscendence and the spiritual life.\n\nAbsolutely. I don\u2019t think anyone who grew up in that world ever totally leaves\nit behind. And my interest in technology grew out of those larger questions.\nWhat does it mean to be human? What does it mean to have a soul?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nA couple of years after I left Bible school, I read The Age of Spiritual\nMachines, Ray Kurzweil\u2019s book about the singularity and transhumanism. He had\nthis idea that humans could use technology to further our evolution into a new\nspecies, what he called post-humanity. It was this incredible vision of\ntranscendence. We were essentially going to become immortal.\n\n> The algorithmic text was just so wildly creative and poetic.\n\nThere are some similarities to your Christian upbringing.\n\nAs a 25-year-old who was just starting to believe that I wasn\u2019t going to live\nforever in heaven, this was incredibly appealing to think that maybe science\nand technology could bring about a similar transformation. It was a secular\nform of transcendence. I started wondering: What does it mean to be a self or\na thinking mind? Kurzweil was saying our selfhood is basically just a pattern\nof mental activity that you could upload into digital form.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nSo Kurzweil\u2019s argument was that machines could do anything that the human mind\ncan do\u2014and more.\n\nEssentially. But there was a question that was always elided: Is there going\nto be some sort of first-person experience? And this comes into play with\nmind-uploading. If I transform my mind into digital form, am I still going to\nbe me or is it just going to be an empty replica that talks and acts like me,\nwith no subjective experience?\n\nNobody has a good answer for that because nobody knows what consciousness is.\nThat\u2019s what got me really interested in AI, because that\u2019s the area in which\nwe\u2019re playing out these questions now. What is first-person experience? How is\nthat related to intelligence?\n\nIsn\u2019t the assumption that AI has no consciousness or first-person experience?\nIsn\u2019t that the fundamental difference between artificial intelligence and the\nhuman mind?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThat is definitely the consensus, but how can you prove it? We really don\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s happening inside these models because they\u2019re black box models.\nThey\u2019re neural networks that have many hidden layers. It\u2019s a kind of alchemy.\n\nA sophisticated large language model like Chat GPT has accumulated a vast\nreservoir of language by scraping the internet, but does it have any sense of\nmeaning?\n\nIt depends on how you define meaning. That\u2019s tricky because meaning is a\nconcept we invented, and the definition is contested. For the past hundred\nyears or so, linguists have determined that meaning depends on embodied\nreference in the real world. To know what the word \u201cdog\u201d means, you have to\nhave seen a dog and belong to a linguistic community where that has some\ncollective meaning.\n\nLanguage models don\u2019t have access to the real world, so they\u2019re using language\nin a very different way. They\u2019re drawing on statistical probabilities to\ncreate outputs that sound convincingly human and often appear very\nintelligent. And some computational linguists say, \u201cWell, that is meaning. You\ndon\u2019t need any real-world experience to have meaning.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to have a soul?\n\nThese language models are constructing sentences that make a lot of sense, but\nis it just algorithmic wordplay?\n\nEmily Bender and some engineers at Google came up with the term \u201cstochastic\nparrots.\u201d Stochastic is a statistical set of probabilities, using a certain\namount of randomness, and they\u2019re parrots because they\u2019re mimicking human\nspeech. These models were trained on an enormous amount of real-world human\ntexts, and they\u2019re able to predict what the next word is going to be in a\ncertain context.\n\nTo me, that feels very different than how humans use language. We typically\nuse language when we\u2019re trying to create meaning with other people.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nIn that interpretation, the human mind is fundamentally different than AI.\n\nI think it is. But there are people like Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, who\nfamously tweeted, \u201cI am a stochastic parrot, and so r u.\u201d There are people\ncreating this technology who believe there\u2019s really no difference between how\nthese models use language and how humans use language.\n\nWe think we have all these original ideas, but are we just rearranging the\nchairs on the deck?\n\nI recently asked a computer scientist, \u201cWhat do you think creativity is?\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s easy. It\u2019s just randomness.\u201d And if you know how these\nmodels work, there is a certain amount of correlation between randomness and\ncreativity. A lot of the models have what\u2019s called a temperature gauge. If you\nturn up the temperature, the output becomes more random and it seems much more\ncreative. My feeling is that there\u2019s a certain amount of randomness in human\ncreativity, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s all there is.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nAs a writer, how do you think about creativity and originality?\n\nI think about modernist writers like James Joyce or Virginia Woolf, who\ncompletely changed literature. They created a form of a consciousness on the\npage that felt nothing like what had come before in the history of the novel.\nThat\u2019s not just because they randomly recombined everything they had read. The\nnature of human experience was changing during that time, and they found a way\nto capture what that felt like. I think creativity has to have that inner\nsubjective quality. It comes back to the idea of meaning, which is created\nbetween two minds.\n\nIt\u2019s commonly assumed that AI has no thinking mind or subjective experience,\nbut how would we even know if these AI models are conscious?\n\nI have no idea. My intuition is that if it said something that was convincing\nenough to show that it has experience, which includes emotion but also self-\nawareness. But we\u2019ve already had instances where the models have spoken in\nvery convincing terms about having an inner life. There was a Google engineer,\nBlake Lemoine, who was convinced that the chatbot he was working on was\nsentient. This is going to be fiercely debated.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> Artificial general intelligence is creating something that\u2019s essentially\n> going to be like a god.\n\nA lot of these chatbots do seem to have self-awareness.\n\nThey\u2019re designed to appear that way. There\u2019s been so much money poured into\nemotional AI. This is a whole subfield of AI\u2014creating chatbots that can\nconvincingly emote and respond to human emotion. It\u2019s about maximizing\nengagement with the technology.\n\nDo you think a very advanced AI would have godlike capacities? Will machines\nbecome so sophisticated that we can\u2019t distinguish between them and more\nconventional religious ideas of God?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the goal for a lot of people developing this technology. Sam\nAltman, Elon Musk\u2014they\u2019ve all absorbed the Kurzweil idea of the singularity.\nThey are essentially trying to create a god with AGI\u2014artificial general\nintelligence. It\u2019s AI that can do everything we can and surpass human\nintelligence.\n\nBut isn\u2019t intelligence, no matter how advanced, different than God?\n\nThe thinking is that once it gets to the level of human intelligence, it can\nstart doing what we\u2019re doing, modifying and improving itself. At that point it\nbecomes a recursive process where there\u2019s going to be some sort of\nintelligence explosion. This is the belief.\n\nBut there\u2019s another question: What are we trying to design? If you want to\ncreate a tool that helps people solve cancer or find solutions to climate\nchange, you can do that with a very narrowly trained AI. But the fact that we\nare now working toward artificial general intelligence is different. That\u2019s\ncreating something that\u2019s essentially going to be like a god.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nWhy do you think Elon Musk and Sam Altman want to create this?\n\nI think they read a lot of sci-fi as kids. [Laughs] I mean, I don\u2019t know.\nThere\u2019s something very deeply human in this idea of, \u201cWell, we have this\ncapacity, so we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d It\u2019s scary, though. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called\nthe singularity. You can\u2019t see beyond it. It\u2019s an event horizon. Once you\ncreate something like that, there\u2019s really no way to tell what it will look\nlike until it\u2019s in the world.\n\nI do feel like people are trying to create a system that\u2019s going to give\nanswers that are difficult to come by through ordinary human thought. That\u2019s\nthe main appeal of creating artificial general intelligence. It\u2019s some sort of\ngodlike figure that can give us the answers to persistent political conflicts\nand moral debates.\n\nIf it\u2019s smart enough, can AI solve the problems that we imperfect humans\ncannot?\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nI don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s similar to what I was looking for in automatic writing,\nwhich is a source of meaning that\u2019s external to my experience. Life is\ninfinitely complex, and every situation is different. That requires a constant\nprocess of meaning-making.\n\nHannah Arendt talks about thinking and then thinking again. You\u2019re constantly\nmaking and unmaking thought as you experience the world. Machines are rigid.\nThey\u2019re trained on the whole corpus of human history. They\u2019re like a mirror,\nreflecting back to us a lot of our own beliefs. But I don\u2019t think they can\ngive us that sense of meaning that we\u2019re looking for as humans. That\u2019s\nsomething that we ultimately have to create for ourselves.\n\nThis interview originally aired on Wisconsin Public Radio\u2019s nationally\nsyndicated show To the Best of Our Knowledge.
