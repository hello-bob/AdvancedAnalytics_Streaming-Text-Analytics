(October 2021)  \n---  \n  \nTupper's self-referential formula is a formula that visually represents itself\nwhen graphed at a specific location in the (x, y) plane.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe formula was defined by Jeff Tupper and appears as an example in Tupper's\n2001 SIGGRAPH paper on reliable two-dimensional computer graphing\nalgorithms.^[1] This paper discusses methods related to the GrafEq formula-\ngraphing program developed by Tupper.^[2]\n\nAlthough the formula is called \"self-referential\", Tupper did not name it as\nsuch.^[3]\n\n## Formula[edit]\n\nThe formula is an inequality defined as:\n\nwhere denotes the floor function, and mod is the modulo operation.\n\n## Plots[edit]\n\nLet equal the following 543-digit integer:\n\n    960 939 379 918 958 884 971 672 962 127 852 754 715 004 339 660 129 306 651 505 519 271 702 802 395 266 424 689 642 842 174\n    350 718 121 267 153 782 770 623 355 993 237 280 874 144 307 891 325 963 941 337 723 487 857 735 749 823 926 629 715 517 173\n    716 995 165 232 890 538 221 612 403 238 855 866 184 013 235 585 136 048 828 693 337 902 491 454 229 288 667 081 096 184 496\n    091 705 183 454 067 827 731 551 705 405 381 627 380 967 602 565 625 016 981 482 083 418 783 163 849 115 590 225 610 003 652\n    351 370 343 874 461 848 378 737 238 198 224 849 863 465 033 159 410 054 974 700 593 138 339 226 497 249 461 751 545 728 366\n    702 369 745 461 014 655 997 933 798 537 483 143 786 841 806 593 422 227 898 388 722 980 000 748 404 719\nDerivation of k\n\nGraphing the set of points in and , results in the following plot:^[note 1]\n\nThe formula is a general-purpose method of decoding a bitmap stored in the\nconstant , and it could be used to draw any other image. When applied to the\nunbounded positive range , the formula tiles a vertical swath of the plane\nwith a pattern that contains all possible 17-pixel-tall bitmaps. One\nhorizontal slice of that infinite bitmap depicts the drawing formula itself,\nbut this is not remarkable, since other slices depict all other possible\nformulae that might fit in a 17-pixel-tall bitmap. Tupper has created extended\nversions of his original formula that rule out all but one slice.^[4]\n\nThe constant is a simple monochrome bitmap image of the formula treated as a\nbinary number and multiplied by 17. If is divided by 17, the least significant\nbit encodes the upper-right corner ; the 17 least significant bits encode the\nrightmost column of pixels; the next 17 least significant bits encode the 2nd-\nrightmost column, and so on.\n\nIt fundamentally describes a way to plot points on a two-dimensional surface.\nThe value of is the number whose binary digits form the plot. The following\nplot demonstrates the addition of different values of . In the fourth subplot,\nthe k-value of \"AFGP\" and \"Aesthetic Function Graph\" is added to get the\nresultant graph, where both texts can be seen with some distortion due to the\neffects of binary addition. The information regarding the shape of the plot is\nstored within .^[5]\n\nAddition of different values of k\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Bitmap \u2013 Computing term\n  * Elementary function \u2013 Mathematical function\n  * Quine (computing) \u2013 Self-replicating program\n  * Recursion \u2013 Process of repeating items in a self-similar way\n  * Strange loop \u2013 Cyclic structure that goes through several levels in a hierarchical system\n\n## References[edit]\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ The axes in this plot have been reversed, otherwise the picture would be upside-down and mirrored.\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ * Tupper, Jeff. \"Reliable Two-Dimensional Graphing Methods for Mathematical Formulae with Two Free Variables\" Archived 2019-07-13 at the Wayback Machine\n  2. ^ \"Pedagoguery Software: GrafEq\". www.peda.com.
