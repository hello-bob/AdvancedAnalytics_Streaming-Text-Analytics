Around 53 improvements.\n\nOfficial ISOs are now automatically run through a CI testsuite before release.\nThe newly started testsuite project tests various program binaries and whether\nthe architectural ISOs fully boot.\n\n### User visible\n\n  * GCC 13\n  * LLVM/Clang 18\n  * GlibC 2.39\n  * Musl 1.2.5\n  * uClibc 1.0.47\n  * Linux 6.8.7\n  * X.Org 21.1.12\n  * GNOME 46.1\n  * KDE 24.02/6.1\n  * switched to pipewire by default\n  * enabled zram swap by default\n  * fixed many older Xorg and FB drivers\n  * improved installer for many non-x86 architectures\n  * improved LVM & RAID installer\n  * build time estimates\n  * better dependency resolution\n  * included more USB, Ethernet, and PHYs in initrd\n  * more lightweight netinstall w/o curl\n  * better nfsroot support\n  * x32 builds now run enable 4GB HIGHMEM for more than 800MB usable RAM\n  * i686 builds now run on AMD Geode LX, Transmeta Crusoe and VIA C3\n  * ps3fb was reworked to free 8MB of RAM and reduce background CPU load by up to 6%\n  * added and improved homebrew support for other BSD and macOS\n  * latest linux kernels now booted via unversioned symlink\n  * unified compressed Linux kernel vmlinuz* names for all architectures\n  * mksh is the new default for /bin/sh and initrd\n  * source package builds now default to no-LTO and \"smartly\" optimizations to speed up builds on slower systems\n  * most of KDE and GNOME actually finally works again\n  * a ~30MB on average memory leak was fixed in the initrd\n  * over 200 new packages (now over 5000)\n  * most existing packages received an update\n  * over 5100 SVN revisions since the 23.6 release\n\n### Developer visible\n\n  * cached dependencies are now automatically marked optional by pkginstalled\n  * rustc is more often bootstrapped using the host system rustc\n  * libglvnd is installed by default\n  * libxcrypt now provides vintage crypto on glibc based builds\n  * icu4c was hotfixed for cross builds with different endianness\n  * reworked git checkouts for hopefully finally stable checksums\n  * better ninja support\n  * many more - may the source and manual be with you!\n\n## Known Issues\n\nDue to the nature of all cross compiled base install ISOs, gobject-\nintrospection is not installed by default and some packages need to be\nnatively, locally rebuilt for some advanced gnome-desktop packages.\n\nLast modified: 2024-04-29 18:18 \u2014 Copyright \u00a92004-2023 ExactCODE and others.\nAll Rights Reserved.
