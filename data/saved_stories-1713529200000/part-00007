These \"AIs,\" if they achieve\n\"Superintelligence\" (Nick Bostrom), could pose \"existential risks\" that lead\nto \"Our Final Hour\" (Martin Rees). And Stephen Hawking recently made\ninternational headlines when he noted \"The development of full artificial\nintelligence could spell the end of the human race.\"\n\nTHE EDGE QUESTION\u20142015 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT MACHINES THAT THINK?\n\nBut wait! Should we also ask what machines that think, or, \"AIs\", might be\nthinking about? Do they want, do they expect civil rights? Do they have\nfeelings? What kind of government (for us) would an AI choose? What kind of\nsociety would they want to structure for themselves? Or is \"their\" society\n\"our\" society? Will we, and the AIs, include each other within our respective\ncircles of empathy?\n\nNumerous Edgies have been at the forefront of the science behind the various\nflavors of AI, either in their research or writings. AI was front and center\nin conversations between charter members Pamela McCorduck (Machines Who Think)\nand Isaac Asimov (Machines That Think) at our initial meetings in 1980. And\nthe conversation has continued unabated, as is evident in the recent Edge\nfeature \"The Myth of AI,\" a conversation with Jaron Lanier, that evoked rich\nand provocative commentaries.\n\nIs AI becoming increasingly real? Are we now in a new era of the \"AIs\"? To\nconsider this issue, it's time to grow up. Enough already with the science\nfiction and the movies, Star Maker, Blade Runner, 2001, Her, The Matrix, \"The\nBorg.\" Also, 80 years after Turing's invention of his Universal Machine, it's\ntime to honor Turing, and other AI pioneers, by giving them a well-deserved\nrest. We know the history.

Brown 1-28-2015\n\nJohn Brockman's Edge Question is a major event in the intellectual calendar\neach year \u2014 its roots go back to talks he had with Isaac Asimov and others in\n1980. This year's question, \"What do you think about machines that think?\"\ndrew essays from Daniel C. Dennett, Nicholas Carr, Steven Pinker, Freeman\nDyson, George Church and nearly two hundred other luminaries and Nobel Prize\nwinners.\n\nUVM computer scientist and robotics expert Joshua Bongard was asked to weigh\nin, too. ...\n\n...[R]ead the whole essay. It\u2019s online now and will appear in a printed book\nas each of the Edge questions \u2014 like \u201cWhat will change everything?\u201d (2009) and\n\u201cWhat is your dangerous idea?\u201d (2006) \u2014 has for the last decade.\n\n\"Naches\" from our Machines\n\nBy Samuel Arbesman 1.29.15\n\nThis year\u2019s Edge question is \u201cWhat do you think about machines that think?\u201d\nMyresponse is less about their likelihood and more about how we should\nrespond, as a society, if this ever comes to pass. Specifically, it involves\nnaches, the Yiddish term for pride and joy...\n\nRead the rest here.\n\nTania Lombrozo\n\nThinking machines are consistently in the news these days, and often a topic\nof discussion here at 13.7. Last week, Alva No\u00eb came out as a singularity\nskeptic, and three of us contributed to Edge.org's annual question for 2015:\nWhat do you think about machines that think?\n\nIn response to the Edge.org question, I argued that we shouldn't be\nchauvinists when it comes to defining thinking \u2014 that is, we should resist the\ntemptation to restrict what counts as thinking to \"thinking like adult humans\"\nor \"thinking like contemporary computers.\" Marcelo Gleiser suggested that\nwe're already living as transhumans, enhanced by our technogadgets and medical\nimprovements. And Stuart Kauffman considered Turing machines, the quantum and\nhuman choice.\n\nIn addressing the relationship between humans and thinking machines, all three\nof our responses \u2014 and those by many others \u2014 raised questions about what (if\nanything) makes us uniquely human. Part of what's fascinating about the idea\nof thinking machines, after all, is that they seem to approach and encroach on\na uniquely human niche, homo sapiens \u2014 the wise.\n\nDomingo 25, de enero do 2015 | lanacion.com (Buenos Aires)\n\n#\n\nWhat do you think about machines think?\n\nMore than 180 scientists, philosophers, writers and technicians responded to\nthe annual call Edge.org website with original reflections on the scope, risks\nand possibilities of artificial intelligence, a field-edge science that is\nalready bringing the future to present\n\nArtificial intelligence, is one of the most promising developments of modern\nscience, or risk to humanity? Between these two poles, with irony, optimism\nand caution, the 186 scientists, writers and thinkers convened this year by\nEdge.org-a website associated with a publisher that promotes thinking and\ndiscussion of the art in science, arts and moved literature- to meet its\nannual question. The collaborators wrote brief essays available on the web (\nwww.edge.org ) and, like every year, will soon have its publication on paper.\nHere a selection of their responses.\n\nPamela McCorduck, Steven Pinker, Irene Pepperberg, Thomas A. Bass, Paul\nDavies, Nicholas G. Carr.\n\n# Is Your Computer About To Become The Enemy?\n\nBy Sheizaf Rafaeli 22:01:15, 07:14\n\n180 intellectuals responded to this Edge annual question - \"What do you think\nabout computers that think?\" Soon this question may become an issue for all of\nus\n\n\"What do you think about computers that think?\" The question for 2015 on the\nprestigious Edge.org site. Each year the site gives the same question to more\nthan 180 intellectuals and publishes their answers in one sequence, later\npublished as a thick book. Respondents ranged from columnists in The New York\nTimes, Nobel Prize winners, best-selling authors, and heroes of the technology\nworld, many of them close friends of the site's colorful editor, literary\nagent John Brockman. Previously published questions: \"What scientific concept\nhas to retire?\", \"What tools will improve everyone's thinking?\" and \"What\nshould we be worried about? \". This year, as mentioned, Brockman called 180\nintellectuals to express an opinion on the question Hawking has been talking\nabout. And Disclosure: I was delighted to receive an invitation to participate\nthis year in most of this dialogue, and my response, ordered to be short -\neven short of this column - for the annual anthology published.\n\nSeveral respondents, including the writer Pamela McCorduck, Italian physicist\nCarlo Rovelli, Professor Margaret Levi of Stanford University and the Israel\nPrize laureate and former president of the Weizmann Institute Haim Harari,\nrefer to machines that think as inevitable, and in large measure daily.\nInterest in human responsibility and proper management like any other field,\nand material nightmares. More than the machines thinking like people, I am\nconcerned about people who think like machines, writes Harari.\n\nOthers relate to the very dismissive forecast: Vice President for Research of\nthe George Washington University, Neurobiologist, Leo Chalupa doubts machines\nwill be capable of abstract thought. Science fiction writer Bruce Sterling\nwrites that computers may be major players in the future, but the script will\nnever write people. They further emphasize emotion and will remain forever\nconfined to human beings.\n\nWhat a Child Can Teach a Smart Computer\n\nBy Alison Gopnik Jan. 22, 2015\n\nEvery January the intellectual impresario and literary agent John Brockman\n(who represents me, I should disclose) asks a large group of thinkers a single\nquestion on his website, edge.org. This year it is: \u201cWhat do you think about\nmachines that think?\u201d There are lots of interesting answers, ranging from the\nskeptical to the apocalyptic.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that asking whether machines can think is the right question,\nthough. As someone once said, it\u2019s like asking whether submarines can swim.\nBut we can ask whether machines can learn, and especially, whether they can\nlearn as well as 3-year-olds. ...\n\n# Very big thinkers ponder: \"What do you think about machines that think?\"\n\nBy David Pescovitz at 6:40 am Wed, Jan 21, 2015\n\nOver at BB pal John Brockman's Edge.org, nearly 200 very smart people, like\nDaniel C. Dennett, Brian Eno, Alison Gopnik, Nina Jablonski, Peter Norvig, and\nRodney Brooks, ponder the EDGE Annual Question of 2015: What do you think\nabout machines that think?\n\nThis week's Nova magazine features contributions from Frank Tipler, Paul\nSaffo, Tomaso Poggio, Nicholas Carr, Kevin Kelly, Juan Enriquez, Peter Norvig,\nJochi Ito, Julio Boccaletti, Carlo Rovelli, Douglas Coupland, and Haim Harari\n\n\"Another year, and some of the most important thinkers and scientists of the\nworld have accepted the intellectual challenge.\" \u2014El Mundo\n\nEL MUNDO. DOMINGO 18 DE ENERO DE 2015\n\n# THE CHALLENGE OF THINKING MACHINES\n\n\"What do you think about machines think?\" This is the annual question that the\ndigital magazine Edge launches every year around this time, and which it\npresents to some of the brightest minds on the planet. Just over a month ago,\nin early December, Stephen Hawking warned of the potentially apocalyptic\nconsequences of artificial intelligence, which in his opinion could eventually\nlead to \"the end of the human species\". But really, should we fear the danger\nof a future army of humanoids out of control? Or rather we should celebrate\nthe extraordinary opportunities that could give us the development of thinking\nmachines, and even sentient beings? Do such beings along with ourselves pose\nnew ethical dilemmas? Would they be part of our \"society\"? Should we grant\nthem civil rights? Would we feel empathy for them? Another year, and some of\nthe most important thinkers and scientists of the world have accepted the\nintellectual challenge posed by the editor of Edge, John Brockman. This is\njust a selection of some of the most interesting responses.\n\nNick Bostrom, Daniel C.
