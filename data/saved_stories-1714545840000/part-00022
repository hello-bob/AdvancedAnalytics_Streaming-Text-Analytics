Stuart Potts at\nhis flat in Middleton, Manchester. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The\nGuardian\n\nStuart Potts is an unlikely do-gooder \u2013 a former crack addict who has hit rock\nbottom more than once. But since 2020 he has offered hundreds of homeless\npeople a bed in his small flat \u2013 and for many of them, it has been life-\nchanging\n\nby Samira Shackle\n\nShare\n\nWhen Jade and John came across Stuart Potts early this year, they were\nsleeping rough in Manchester city centre. It was during January\u2019s brutal cold\nsnap, but the pair couldn\u2019t find a homeless shelter that would take them in as\na couple, and they didn\u2019t want to be separated. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on the streets\ntogether; we\u2019ve been through some of the worst nights of our life together,\u201d\nsaid Jade, who is 38, with a hoarse voice and a broad Rochdale accent.\n\nStill, when someone from a local charity told them about a man putting\nhomeless people up in his own house, they were suspicious. \u201cI thought he was\njust going to be some fucking ... \u201d Jade paused, looking for the right word,\n\u201cteacher or something.\u201d But when they met for a pint to scope him out, Jade\nwas immediately reassured. \u201cHe\u2019d been on the streets, and he\u2019d been to prison.\nHe was really normal, we just felt comfortable. He\u2019s not judging.\u201d They stayed\nat his flat that night.\n\nStuart Potts, or Pottsy, as his friends call him, is an unlikely do-gooder. He\nhas a long criminal record (\u201cmostly petty stuff\u201d, he says), and has spent much\nof his life in and out of prison. For a period, he lived in a tent by the\ncanal in Salford and in Manchester city centre. He was formerly addicted to\ncrack cocaine. A stout, tough 43-year-old with close-shaved hair, he holds his\nbody tightly: chest out, shoulders back, wide-open eyes darting about,\nobserving and assessing as he talks. He speaks at a million miles a minute,\nswearing constantly, rattling off memories of being run over by a drug dealer,\ngetting stabbed with a broken bottle, going to prison for kicking someone\u2019s\nhead in. Describing an abortive attempt to go to Cocaine Anonymous some years\nago, he cackles: \u201cEveryone was fucking talking about crack, and all I could\nthink about was how much I wanted some crack.\u201d The story of his nervous\nbreakdown, he relays as a farce (\u201cdancing naked under the apple tree like a\npsychopathical nutcase\u201d). Many anecdotes are animated by a scathing contempt\nfor authority: \u201cthe system\u201d, the police, council functionaries with \u201cno\nfucking compassion\u201d.\n\nPotts talks with the cynicism of someone who has hit rock bottom, several\ntimes over, and had to pull himself back up. When he describes the worst\nmoments of his life, however, it\u2019s usually softened by a memory of someone\nhelping when they didn\u2019t have to. These days, helping others has become Potts\u2019\nfocus. It\u2019s not really a job, since he isn\u2019t paid; it\u2019s more of a need,\nsomething that eases his own anxiety and keeps his demons at bay.\n\nPotts lives in a one-bed flat in Middleton, a town in Greater Manchester. Ever\nsince he moved in, back in April 2020, he has let homeless people come and\nstay: an ever-changing cast of strangers who sleep on the sofa and in the\ncaravan he has parked outside the flat. He doesn\u2019t charge rent, but has a few\nbasic rules: hard drugs and violence are forbidden, and everyone has to pitch\nin with housework. Space can be tight. The first time I visited, in February,\nthere were six people staying: two in the caravan, four on the large U-shaped\nsofa. They shared the living room with Bullseye, a mixed staffordshire bull\nterrier Potts rescued when a neighbour went to prison. The most people he\u2019s\nhad staying at one time is eight. \u201cThat was too many,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was\nstepping over bodies.\u201d\n\nHis work is entirely informal, operating outside the auspices of any governing\nauthority, charity registration, funding body or council department. Last\nyear, the council rang Potts, asking to inspect the flat since he was\nadvertising it as a shelter. \u201cThey said: \u2018We need to know if the cooking\nfacilities are safe,\u2019\u201d Potts recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018All right, I\u2019ll kick them out\non the street and we\u2019ll see what the cooking facilities are like in a fucking\ntent, shall we?\u2019\u201d He gave a dry laugh, shaking his head. (The council didn\u2019t\ncome: he successfully argued that since it\u2019s a private property, they had no\nright to inspect.) The entire operation is funded out of Potts\u2019 pocket: a\nuniversal credit allowance that after his rent \u2013 \u00a3595 a month \u2013 leaves him\nwith less than \u00a3100 a week.\n\nThe drastic increase in homelessness and rough sleeping over the past decade\nand a half is visible on the streets of every major city in the UK. But even\nthose who are distressed by this are unlikely to host strangers in their own\nhome. Potts, though, sees his actions as logical and obvious: people need\nhelp, and if you can provide it, then you should. \u201cI don\u2019t need this space \u2013 I\ncan sit in my bedroom and watch TV,\u201d he said, motioning at his modestly sized\nfront room. \u201cIf more people helped others, the world would be a better place,\nwouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nPotts stresses that his \u201cmum brought me up good and proper\u201d \u2013 but as a\nteenager growing up in Salford, he started getting into trouble. \u201cWe\u2019ve had\nour hard times with Stuart, but a lot of it was typical boy stuff,\u201d his mum,\nPat Malone, said. \u201cWe used to say he was a lovable rogue.\u201d Potts went to\nprison several times in his late teens and 20s, including an 18-month stint\nfor beating up a burglar who had broken into a friend\u2019s house. After he got\nout, he had a chequered career: working in factories, as a cobbler, locksmith\nand painter and decorator. But gradually, life stabilised. He got married,\nmoved into a comfortable council house, and had three kids. Then, in 2016,\nafter more than 15 years, the marriage broke down.\n\nBegging on the Manchester streets. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty\nImages\n\nFaced with the prospect of losing his children, Potts went off the rails and\nstarted using crack. \u201cIt was a coping mechanism, masking the thing, but it\nmade it 10 times worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst mistake of my life.\u201d He used\ncrack for about six months, then had a breakdown and was sectioned. \u201cIt was a\nreally terrible time, seeing your child go through that,\u201d said Malone. After\nthree months on a psychiatric ward, Potts managed to rent a flat of his own,\nwith help from benefits. But he was still struggling. To distract himself as\nmuch as anything else, he gathered donations of sleeping bags and tents from\nfriends, and handed them out to homeless people.\n\nThe man who propelled Potts from giving out bedding to opening up his own home\nwas a rough sleeper called Stephen Bolton. Potts encountered him sitting\noutside a Tesco near his flat. Bolton was in his 50s, a heroin and crack\naddict who had been homeless for years. It was raining and Potts asked if\nBolton wanted to stay with him. \u201cI told him I wouldn\u2019t have any drugs at mine,\nbut if he wanted help, he was welcome.\u201d A few weeks later, Bolton decided to\ntake him up on the offer. Potts helped him go cold turkey: \u201cHe was sweating\nhis bollocks off.\u201d He gave Bolton beers and the odd diazepam \u201cto take the edge\noff\u201d, gradually transitioning to vitamin C as a placebo.\n\nBolton stayed for nine weeks, until Potts proudly told a neighbour what he\u2019d\ndone. The neighbour informed the landlord, who admonished Potts for bringing a\n\u201csmackhead tramp\u201d into the flat and evicted them both. (\u201cI wanted to go round\nand break the bastard\u2019s legs,\u201d Potts said, of the neighbour.) Within a few\nweeks of being back on the streets, Bolton relapsed, and died of an overdose.\n\u201cHe went down the rabbit hole again,\u201d said Potts. \u201cIt made me so angry.\u201d\n\nPotts is bombastic and funny, full of righteous outrage and profane humour.\nBut when I asked what made him approach Bolton \u2013 a stranger to him, someone\nwith a serious drug addiction \u2013 and offer to take him in, he was\nuncharacteristically lost for words. \u201cI\u2019ve always done stuff like that,\u201d he\nsaid, then tailed off. \u201cLove of people I guess.\u201d He can\u2019t explain why he did\nit, and can\u2019t understand why other people find it strange.\n\nAfter being evicted, Potts was homeless too, sometimes sofa-surfing, sometimes\nsleeping in a tent. Time blurs when your only focus is where you\u2019re going to\nsleep that night, and he can\u2019t say exactly how long it went on for. But it was\na dark period. \u201cI\u2019ve been kicked while I\u2019ve been sleeping, pissed on, spat\nat,\u201d he said. One night, when he was sleeping by the canal in Salford a group\nof teenagers picked up his tent and tried to throw it in the water. But he\nalso remembers moments of kindness, such as the woman called Debbie who let\nhim stay the odd night on her sofa when the temperatures got really cold. \u201cNot\neverybody\u2019s the same, are they?\u201d he said. \u201cIf these people what helped me\ndidn\u2019t exist, I wouldn\u2019t be sat where I am now.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Potts received a life-changing tip that would set him on a new, much\nmore ambitious path. Another rough sleeper told Potts he sometimes squatted in\nempty buildings, and Potts decided to try it. Squatting in a residential\nproperty is illegal, and he was soon evicted. But it planted the seed of an\nidea: researching squatting law, he discovered it is far harder to evict\nsquatters from commercial properties.\n\nPotts had noticed a doctor\u2019s surgery in Eccles, in Salford, that had been\nempty for more than a decade. \u201cI thought, why are people sat out here freezing\nwhen the building\u2019s empty? I\u2019ll take it over.\u201d He posted about the squat on\nFacebook and people rushed to help. (\u201cI know a lot of people round Salford,\u201d\nhe said.) Within 48 hours, \u201cwe had beds, mattresses, cookers, fridge-freezers,\nmicrowaves, TVs, bedding, food in the cupboards, staff on board who were\nvolunteering\u201d. He went out to inform rough sleepers, and within a few days 18\npeople were staying.\n\nEvicting squatters from commercial properties requires court action, and in\nthis case, it took seven months. When they were finally evicted from the\ndoctor\u2019s surgery, Potts found another building, then another. For a brief\nperiod, Potts was running three separate squats at once. He developed a system\nfor the people he was housing: \u201cI had the ones that had more drug and alcohol\nissues at the vet\u2019s. Once they\u2019d progressed a bit, I moved them to the\nchemist, and once they progressed more from that, I\u2019d move them to the pub.\u201d\nBy the autumn of 2019, they were set up in the Unicorn, an abandoned pub in\nEccles. Potts dubbed it the Saving People Shelter Project, printed a banner\nand hung it outside the pub.\n\nThere is significant evidence that placing people in secure, long-term\naccommodation can go a huge way towards stabilising their lives. In policy-\nspeak, this is called the Housing First model: giving people homes with no\nconditions attached, rather than the traditional approach of expecting them to\ntackle addiction or mental health problems first. Research shows that 80-90%\nof people in Housing First schemes maintain a tenancy for a year or more,\ncompared with 40% for traditional approaches. Since 2008, Housing First has\nbeen Finland\u2019s national policy, and in that time overall homelessness has\ndecreased 47%, and long-term homelessness more than 70%. In his own, wildly\ninformal way, Potts follows something akin to the Housing First model: find\npeople accommodation and the rest will follow.\n\nThe Saving People Shelter Project housed in a squat in a former NHS doctor\u2019s\nsurgery in Eccles, in 2019. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nLife in the squats wasn\u2019t always perfect. Paul Doyle, who was homeless after\nhis release from prison, lived in the Unicorn and helped Potts run it. \u201cWe had\nsome trouble \u2013 your smashed windows, or people using drugs. Then we\u2019d just\nsling them out,\u201d he said. But mostly, it was quite stable. There were about 14\nof them at the Unicorn, some of whom were working, including a postman who had\ngot into rent arrears and lost his home.\n\nPotts speaks about this period with an evangelising zeal. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any\nmoney. If I can do that, surely to God the government or the local authority\ncan do it, can\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nPotts\u2019 freewheeling approach has been an essential part of his success. But\nthat impulsivity has also landed him in trouble. After being evicted from the\nUnicorn in October 2019, Potts opened a new shelter in another abandoned pub,\nthe Albert Edward, also in Eccles. A few weeks after they moved in, it was\nRemembrance Sunday. About 300 people gathered around the Cenotaph war monument\nin Eccles, a few metres from the Albert Edward.\n\nShortly before the two minutes\u2019 silence began, Potts leaned out of the window\nand set off two fireworks. He says it was intended as a mark of respect,\nsomething like the cannon that fire at Remembrance events in London. This was\nnot the way it was interpreted. People panicked. Among them were war veterans,\nwho told local media the sound had triggered PTSD symptoms. Potts was\narrested. The next day he pleaded guilty to one count of throwing fireworks in\na public place and one count of using threatening, abusive or insulting words\nor behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress.\n\nPotts apologised, but the judge was unconvinced of his remorse. He was\nsentenced to 16 weeks in prison. Potts was a prominent local figure at this\npoint, and the Manchester Evening News even ran a live blog from the hearing.\nPeople were furious about the incident, seeing it as two fingers up to the war\ndead. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for any malicious purpose, and my friends know that,\u201d\nPotts told me. \u201cBut a lot of people still don\u2019t like me.\u201d Malone, Potts\u2019\nmother, has observed this too. \u201cStuart\u2019s grandad was in the war, so he\u2019s got a\nlot of respect,\u201d she said. \u201cBut people don\u2019t forget. Some people, when they\u2019ve\nhad a drink and they see him, they start on him for no reason.\u201d\n\nWhile he was in prison, the squat fell apart, and Potts lost his flat. When he\nwas released, he was placed in a B&B the council uses as temporary\naccommodation, then moved to other temporary accommodation in Middleton, just\nnorth of Manchester\u2019s city centre. Soon after his arrival, the council said\nthey were discharging their housing duty towards him because he had made\nhimself intentionally homeless by going to prison. He relayed this with a\ncackle of disbelief: \u201cI said: \u2018Are you mad?\u2019 I said: \u2018I didn\u2019t want to go to\nprison.\u2019\u201d\n\nPotts needed somewhere to live and heard that a flat over the road was\navailable. Potts spoke to the landlady and explained that he had no money for\na deposit (typically, tenants have to pay a month\u2019s rent upfront, plus another\nmonth), but would find a way to pay it if she\u2019d let him move in. \u201cI said: \u2018I\nhaven\u2019t got a pot to piss in at the minute. I\u2019ve got no money, but the\nbenefits will pay for the rent, if you\u2019ll trust me.\u2019\u201d The landlady agreed.\n\u201cThat was a massive break for me,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019d still be\nsquatting, or on the streets.\u201d\n\nIn April 2020, Potts moved in, furnished the place and relaunched the Saving\nPeople Shelter Project. From the outset, he was upfront with the landlady\nabout his operation. She didn\u2019t object as long as there was no damage to the\nproperty or trouble with the neighbours. He has maintained warm relations,\nhelped along by a habit of redistributing excess donations from the shelter \u2013\nrecently, several hundred pastries from a local bakery \u2013 along the street.\n\u201cAsk anybody round here about Pottsy and they\u2019ll tell you what a good heart he\nhas and it\u2019s true, he has a heart of gold,\u201d one local resident told me.\n\nPotts\u2019 flat is on the ground floor. The front door opens straight into the\nliving area, which is dominated by a large sofa and a big TV. The walls are\ncovered with framed collages of family photos; Potts now has seven children,\nthree from his first marriage, and four born subsequently to different\nmothers. Some live with their mothers, others are in the care system, and one\nhas been permanently adopted. He sees and speaks to some of his children\nregularly, while others have limited contact with him, either through their\nown choice, or because they\u2019re in care. Potts talks often about his mistakes:\nhis breakdown, his self-destructive response to losing his family, his drug\nuse. \u201cI don\u2019t like some of the consequences of my actions,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I\ndon\u2019t regret any of it, because without those experiences I wouldn\u2019t be where\nI am today, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to help people.\u201d\n\nThe people who pass through are a cross-section of those who have fallen\nthrough Britain\u2019s frayed social safety net: migrants with no recourse to\npublic funds, men who aren\u2019t considered vulnerable enough for housing support,\nlong-term rough sleepers who can\u2019t prove a connection to any local area. Since\n2010, as homelessness in the UK has soared, barriers to getting help have\nmultiplied. The demand for services is overwhelming. \u201cSometimes if we go\nthrough the council, it takes hours and hours and there still isn\u2019t a bed for\nsomeone at the end of it,\u201d said Jonathan Billings, who runs a local charity,\nEgg, which helps homeless people find work. \u201cStuart\u2019s place is informal and\nthere\u2019s not really rules or structure to it, so from our perspective, it\u2019s a\nvery good emergency option. He\u2019s got a good way with people \u2013 he\u2019s relatable,\nas he\u2019s lived through it himself.\u201d\n\nHis mum worries about how dangerous it is for Potts to take strangers into his\nhome, some of whom have serious issues. But she can see how it gives him a\nlevel of stability and purpose that seemed impossible a few years ago. She is\nnot the only one who worries about his safety. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is remarkably\ngenerous, and he is a good guy, but you can\u2019t get away from the fact it\u2019s an\nunregulated project, which means it\u2019s high-risk, both for him and for others,\u201d\nsaid one person who works for a homelessness charity in Manchester. \u201cI can see\nwhy he does it, since a lot of these people literally have no other options,\nbut that\u2019s a structural problem. The council should be providing beds, not\nthis one bloke.\u201d\n\nSolving that structural problem in Manchester \u2013 and across Britain \u2013 has\nproven thorny. When Andy Burnham became Manchester\u2019s mayor in 2017, he pledged\nto end rough sleeping. His flagship homelessness policy is A Bed Every Night,\nwhich promises that anyone who calls the council will be accommodated indoors.\nLike most cities in the UK, Manchester has a dearth of social or affordable\nhousing to move people into. Over time, the system has bottlenecked: demand\nfrom new rough sleepers is growing, but beds aren\u2019t opening up. Accommodation\nthat was designed as a temporary stopgap is now accommodating people for weeks\nor even months.\n\nThe mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, talks to homeless people in\n2017. Photograph: Mayor of Greater Manchester/PA\n\nDespite multimillion-pound investment in services in Manchester over the past\nseven years, overall levels of homelessness in the city are still increasing,\nand rough sleeping has increased for the past two consecutive years. This is\npartly due to changes way beyond the power of the Manchester mayor\u2019s office \u2013\nfor instance, in the asylum system. There has been a 13-fold increase in the\nnumber of asylum-seekers sleeping rough in Manchester within the last year,\nwhich Potts has noticed. \u201cMy house is like the bleeding United Nations,\u201d he\nsaid. Simultaneously, the number of no-fault evictions has risen sharply,\nwhile catastrophic funding crises at councils around the country have further\ncurtailed homelessness services. \u201cProvisions in Manchester are very, very\ngood, but they can only do so much. What we need is more affordable housing\nand more social housing,\u201d said Billings.\n\nOne of the central challenges of the homelessness crisis is making the leap\nfrom short-term fixes to long-term solutions. Providing a shelter bed for a\nnight requires resources \u2013 but in many ways, it\u2019s the easy part. For a person\nto make their way out of the world of emergency accommodation into a home of\ntheir own is astonishingly difficult. As well as the shortage of affordable\nhousing, making the transition typically requires people to navigate a vast\ntangle of bureaucracy \u2013 and to do so when they may have no income, extremely\nlimited resources and nowhere to live.\n\nWhen someone arrives at his flat, Potts immediately starts trying to find\nsomewhere more sustainable for them to live, and to clear any obstacles in the\nway of that goal. As 2022 drew to a close, Dave Lees arrived at Potts\u2019 place,\nafter someone he knew from the pub found it online. Lees is now 71, a tall,\nthin man with deeply cracked wrinkles and long grey hair. He had become\nhomeless about five years earlier, when the house he shared with his dad had\nto be sold to pay for his dad\u2019s dementia care. In March this year, I returned\nto Potts\u2019 flat, and Lees was over for a visit. We sat on the sofa, daytime TV\nplaying on mute, as Potts rolled Lees cigarettes. \u201cOne domino goes over, the\nnext one, and the next one,\u201d said Lees. \u201cAnd that little phrase: \u2018Things can\u2019t\nget any worse.\u2019\u201d Potts laughed at this. \u201cI never say that any more, mate.\nNever.\u201d\n\nAfter losing his home, Lees moved between friends\u2019 places, with periods\nsleeping rough. \u201cIt was only a short while sleeping out,\u201d he said. Potts\ninterjected, kindly: \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in it. I\u2019ve done it, haven\u2019t I?\u201d One\neffect of moving around so much was that Lees didn\u2019t have any documentation:\nno photo ID, no bank cards. Many people who experience homelessness are stuck\nin this vicious circle. Without a birth certificate, you can\u2019t get a passport.\nWithout photo ID, you can\u2019t get a bank account. Without a bank account, you\ncan\u2019t get benefits. Lees was eligible for a state pension, but with no bank\naccount and no documentation, he couldn\u2019t claim it.\n\nIn many parts of the UK, people have to prove their connection to a local area\nin order to qualify for any kind of housing support. This can be impossible\nfor those who have been sofa-surfing or sleeping rough, who don\u2019t have utility\nbills or other proof of residence. Lees couldn\u2019t prove his connection to\nSalford, although he had lived there for most of his life. Potts has seen this\nplay out hundreds of times, but his voice rose in frustration as he described\nit. \u201cI said: \u2018He\u2019s not living anywhere at the moment. He\u2019s a man and a bag.\u2019\u201d\nOver a period of months, they took it step-by-step, gradually building up the\ndocumentation Lees needed to get a bank account, his state pension and\nbenefits. This process \u2013 meetings, phone calls, endless form-filling \u2013 took a\nfull year. Lees slept on Potts\u2019 sofa throughout.\n\nIn November 2023, 12 months after Lees arrived, he moved into a one-bed flat\nin Potts\u2019 own building. (Potts had been \u201con at the landlord\u201d about it for\nmonths.) Potts gave Lees his TV, and Malone gave him her old sofa. \u201cYou can\nrest easy now, can\u2019t you?\u201d Potts said to Lees. \u201cA door you can close behind\nyou, without the chaos.\u201d Lees is the second person he has moved into a flat\nwithin his own building.\n\nSince he moved into his flat in 2020, Potts says \u201chundreds\u201d of people have\npassed through. Some stay for a night or two, others \u2013 like Lees \u2013 for months.\nA Polish man is just planning to move after living in the caravan for two\nyears, while he sorted out his EU settled status and trained as a forklift\ntruck driver. Potts never asks for rent, but if people do find work or get\nbenefits sorted while they\u2019re staying, he expects them to chip in where they\ncan \u2013 buy and cook the odd meal for the group, or contribute to bills. \u201cHe\ndoesn\u2019t have many rules, so the ones he\u2019s got, you\u2019ve got to abide by,\u201d said\nTrevor, who moved in at Christmas, after a mental health crisis. Potts went on\nholiday in late February, leaving a group of four people in his flat. \u201cIf it\nwas me, I\u2019d be on pins the whole time about what was happening at my gaff,\u201d\nsaid Trevor, shaking his head thoughtfully. \u201cHe\u2019s a very trusting man. There\u2019s\nnot another one of him.\u201d\n\nStuart Potts: \u2018The truth of it is, I could be homeless again tomorrow.\u2019\nPhotograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nEven so, Potts is tough about upholding the rules. Not long before my first\nvisit in February, he kicked someone out after seven months. The man had got\ndrunk and aggressive. Potts told him to leave, without hesitation, but he felt\nhurt. \u201cI thought he was my friend, but he wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. (A few months\nlater, the man apologised, sending Potts an emotional WhatsApp video of a new\nflat he\u2019d moved into, saying he\u2019d never be able to thank him enough for\ngetting him back on his feet.) Soon after that, Potts asked a transgender\nwoman to leave, after she refused to help with cleaning and described the\nother residents as \u201csavages\u201d. She accused Potts of bigotry. \u201cShe said that\u2019s\nwhy I was kicking her out,\u201d he said, sounding astonished. \u201cI don\u2019t give a toss\nwhat your sexuality is. If you\u2019re a cunt, you\u2019re a cunt.\u201d\n\nThanks to his work running the shelter, and as an activist and advocate, Potts\nhas been propelled into the slightly uneasy position of being a respected\nspokesperson on criminal justice. Last year, he was due to give a speech about\nthe difficulties faced by ex-prisoners at the Tory party conference, but was\ndenied entry due to his criminal record, an irony that was not lost on him.\nPotts doesn\u2019t see himself as someone doling out support from on high. He views\nhimself more as a knowledgable friend trying to leverage a temporary run of\nluck to help others before things turn again. In his mind, even his current\nhome can feel contingent and tenuous. \u201cThe truth of it is, I could be homeless\nagain tomorrow,\u201d he told me.\n\nKnowing you have a bed is liberating, and can free the mind to start thinking\nabout the future. Jade, the woman who was staying with her boyfriend, John,\nwas full of this sense of possibility when I met her in February. She had deep\nbags under her eyes and wore a fluffy dressing gown adorned with the Disney\ncharacters Lilo and Stitch. \u201cStuart told us more information within 10 minutes\nof being here than our last hostel did in three months,\u201d she said. She had big\nplans: applying for ID, finding work, saving for a deposit, moving into a\nflat. The two of them had been homeless for about a year. Jade had, in the\npast, suffered domestic violence, and struggled with drug addiction. Her three\nchildren are in long-term foster care. Despite the sleeping arrangements in\nPotts\u2019 flat \u2013 sharing a sofa with two strangers and a large, snoring dog \u2013 she\nwas relishing the feeling of normality. \u201cI love having a hot shower every\nday,\u201d she said. That night she and John were planning to cook a meal of roast\npork and garlic potatoes for the group, as they\u2019d got some money through from\nbenefits payments.\n\nBut despite best intentions, it doesn\u2019t always work out. A few weeks after\nJade and John arrived, someone donated a Tesco voucher to Potts. He used it to\nbuy a large joint of beef, thinking it would make a nice change from their\ntypical meals of pasta and soup. A few days later, the beef went missing from\nthe fridge. Jade disappeared for several days. Potts looked at the footage\nfrom the CCTV camera he has outside the house, and saw the car of someone he\nknew to be a crack dealer, parked up outside. When Jade returned, Potts said,\nshe was \u201coff her tits\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been on crack, so I know, I recognise it, and I\ndon\u2019t want to be around it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe invisible city: how a homeless man built a life underground\n\nRead more\n\nPotts didn\u2019t have to kick Jade and John out, because he\u2019d already arranged for\nthem to move into a multiple-occupancy house owned by a couple he knows. Drug\nuse is prohibited there, too, and Potts hoped it was a one-off relapse. The\nnext time I visited Potts, Jade and John had moved out. They were doing well,\nand Jade was looking at getting a caravan. But a few weeks later, they had\nused drugs again, and were evicted. Potts lost contact with them entirely, and\ndoesn\u2019t know where they are now. \u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people really do\nhave to want to help themselves.\u201d\n\nWhen it does work out, it\u2019s a kind of magic. On a bright spring day, I went\nwith Lees to his flat, which is on the floor above Potts\u2019 place. The walls\nwere freshly painted, and natural light streamed in through uncurtained\nwindows. Lees had used some of his pension money to buy art supplies, which\nwere neatly stacked in the bedroom. He used to be a sign painter, and was\nexcited to start drawing again. Before I left, Lees showed me something: a\nblue ring-binder, full of plastic wallets, each holding a different document.\nBirth certificate, national insurance number, tax return, bank statements,\ntenancy agreement, gas bills. Proof of existence. So mundane, so vital. \u201cI\nwon\u2019t be letting go of this again,\u201d he said.\n\nSome names have been changed to protect anonymity\n\nFollow the Long Read on X at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and\nsign up to the long read weekly email here.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * The long read\n  * Homelessness\n  * Manchester\n  * Housing\n  * Drugs\n  * UK criminal justice\n  * Prisons and probation\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
