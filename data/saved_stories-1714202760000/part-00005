You will need to do this twice for everything to work. Alternately,\ndisable NoScript entirely until you are done with this site.\n\nYou can opt instead to view the simple test, which will give you a quick\npass/fail for IPv4, IPv4+IPv6, and IPv6. It will however offer little\ndiagnostic information.\n\n  * For the Help Desk\n  * Summary\n  * Tests Run\n  * Share Results / Contact\n  * FAQ for You\n  * Help Popup\n  * Debug\n  * Other IPv6 Sites\n\n0/9 tests run  \n---  \n  \nHow this test works: Your browser will be instructed to reach a series of\nURLs.

IPv6-only users might still reach this, if their\nprovider has employed a NAT64/DNS64 or proxy solution.  \n---|---  \nTest with IPv6 DNS recordpending-| Fetches an object that has just an AAAA\nrecord in DNS. This is expected to use IPv6. Users not yet on the IPv6\nInternet are likely to see this fail. As long as it fails quickly, it will be\nOK - for now.  \nTest with Dual Stack DNS recordpending-| This is the most important test. This\nverifies your browser can connect to a site that has both IPv4 and IPv6\nrecords published. IPv4 only hosts should connect fine (using IPv4).If this\ntest fails or times out, you can expect major problems as publishers start\noffering their sites on IPv6.  \nTest for Dual Stack DNS and large packetpending-| Validates that you can\nconnect to a dual-stack server (like the ds test); and that you can\nsend/receive large packets on that connection. If this test times out for any\nreason, it indicates trouble for World IPv6 Day.  \nTest IPv6 large packetpending-| Validates that IPv6 requests with large\npackets work. If this test times out, but other IPv6 tests work, it suggests\nthat there may be PMTUD issues; possibly involving IP tunnels. Double check to\nmake sure that ICMPv6 Type 2 (\"Packet Too Big\") messages are not filtered by\nyour firewall.  \nTest if your ISP's DNS server uses IPv6pending-(This is bonus credit)| This is\na test of your ISP's resolver (instead of a test of your host). If this test\npasses, your DNS server (often run by your ISP) is capable of reaching\nIPV6-only DNS authoritative servers on the Internet. This is not critical (at\nthis time) for you to reach sites via IPv6.  \nFind IPv4 Service Providerpendinghttps://ipv4.lookup.test-\nipv6.com/ip/?callback=?&asn=1| Attempts to identify what Internet Service\nProvider you use for IPv4. This may be different from the marketing name you\nsee in your local market; or may reflect a previous company name. The name\nshown reflects how it is known in the network operator community.  \nFind IPv6 Service Providerpendinghttps://ipv6.lookup.test-\nipv6.com/ip/?callback=?&asn=1| Attempts to identify what Internet Service\nProvider you use for IPv6. When the IPv4 name and the IPv6 name don't match,\nit may suggest that you're using a tunnel; or some form of third party\nprovider for IPv6.  \nTest for buggy DNSpending-| Queries for a malformed AAAA record. Some routers\nmishandle these as \"A\" records, and only keep the first 32 bits. We want this\ntest to fail to connect.  \n  \nIf the summary results indicated problems, you (or your technical support) may\nbe able to use the information above to diagnose the issues.
