Barnum Brought Beluga Whales to New York City\n\n### Bill Wasik and Monica Murphy on Museum Ethics and Animal Welfare in 19th\nCentury America\n\nBy Bill Wasik and Monica Murphy\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nAs the vast glaciers of the last ice age retreated toward the poles some\nhundred centuries ago, most of the small, playful white whales that had\nforaged at the southern edge of the glacial mass migrated northward to the\nArctic seas. Several thousand stayed behind, having found a bit of stable\nhabitat at the mouth of what would eventually be called the St. Lawrence\nRiver, a deep channel of cold, fresh water flowing northeast from the Great\nLakes basin to the Gulf of St. Lawrence off the Labrador coast.\n\nHere, the mixing of massive liquid volumes causes an upwelling of\nmicronutrients, supporting a diverse food chain. The St. Lawrence beluga\nwhale, cut off from the rest of its species, thrived here for millennia near\nthe apex of the ecological web. During summers, female belugas and their young\nascended the tidal river while a mostly male population of adults swam near\nits mouth. In the winter, both groups retreated to the loose-pack ice regions\nof the lower estuary and gulf.\n\nSinging, squeaking, squealing, chirping, clicking, whistling, whirring, and\nmooing to one another, beluga whales form a noisy society. Their varied\nvocalizations resound through air and water, as well as the hulls of ships,\ninspiring the old sailors to call them \u201csea canaries.\u201d Beluga pods range in\nsize from a few individuals to a few dozen, and their social affiliations are\nloose, often transient.\n\nTogether, sometimes in perfect synchronization, their white bodies slip\nthrough the water forward, backward, surfacing, spouting, and diving\u2014sometimes\ndeeper than twenty meters below the surface\u2014in pursuit of a variety of prey:\nbig fish, like salmon and cod, but also sandworms, shellfish, squid,\noctopuses, and schools of little fish. When the whales are not chasing meals,\nthey often chase one another, in what scientists describe as social locomotor\nplay. Belugas are among the species that researchers have observed playing\nwith toys in the wild, including found objects, exhaled bubbles, and living\nthings found in their waters.\n\nAnd so the beleaguered St. Lawrence beluga had a new enemy: the American\nshowman.\n\nOrcas were the principal predators of beluga whales in the St. Lawrence River\nuntil humans migrated to its shores. Then, for at least several thousand\nyears, indigenous people hunted the beluga from open-top canoes, driving them\ninto the shallows and dispatching them with spears. When French explorer\nJacques Cartier made his second exploratory voyage up the St. Lawrence in\n1535, he noted the presence of both the Iroquois hunters and the snow-white\nwhales, describing the latter as delicious.\n\nBasque sailors joined the beluga hunt in the 1600s, building fixed weir nets\non the mudflats near the river\u2019s mouth; when the tides went out, the whales\nwould get trapped in the meshings and become easy prey for the hunters. French\ncolonists followed, and, after receiving a white-whale fishing concession from\nFrench administrators, many found the commercial harvest of whales for their\noil and skins to be a lucrative occupation. The introduction of harpoons and\nguns in the nineteenth century accelerated the slaughter, and, thereafter, the\nlocal whale population suffered a steep decline.\n\nEven when the species was still common on the St. Lawrence River, the beluga\nwhale was an extreme oddity to the landlubbing New Yorker, several hundred\nmiles to the south. The creature\u2019s slippery, deep-sea strangeness, its perfect\npallor, its size, its thrilling association with ancient tales, its\nincongruity in the industrial dry-land cityscape ensured that, should one ever\nsplash within city limits, the populace would be helpless to look away from\nthe spectacle. Is it any wonder, then, that the idea of bringing a beluga\nwhale to the heart of the metropolis, to be feasted upon by the public gaze,\nbecame an animating ambition of museum owner and impresario Phineas Taylor\nBarnum? As he would later recall in his autobiography:\n\nIn 1861, I learned that some fishermen at the mouth of the St. Lawrence had\nsucceeded in capturing a living white whale, and I was also informed that a\nwhale of this kind, if placed in a box lined with sea-weed and partially\nfilled with salt water, could be transported by land to a considerable\ndistance, and be kept alive. It was simply necessary that an attendant,\nsupplied with a barrel of salt water and a sponge should keep the mouth and\nblow-hole of the whale constantly moist. It seemed incredible that a living\nwhale could be \u201cexpressed\u201d by railroad on a five-days\u2019 journey, and although I\nknew nothing of the white whale or its habits, since I had never seen one, I\ndetermined to experiment in that direction. Landsman that I was, I believed\nthat I was quite as competent as a St. Lawrence fisherman to superintend the\ncapture and transport of a live white whale.\n\nAnd so the beleaguered St. Lawrence beluga had a new enemy: the American\nshowman, who would stop at nothing to have the charismatic cetacean on display\nin his museum. As with his other animal attractions, Barnum seemed to relish\nthe challenges of capturing and conveying the whales to New York\u2014elaborately\ngriping to reporters about the hardships and expenses he suffered in the\neffort, reinforcing the rarity and value of the animals to a breathless public\neager for new amusements.\n\nAfter preparing an eighteen-by-forty-foot tank made of brick and cement in the\nbasement of his American Museum\u2014for \u201cthe reception of the marine\nmonsters\u201d\u2014Barnum himself undertook the trip to French Canada, where he\ncontracted local fishermen to assist in the capture of at least two beluga\nwhales. They constructed a large V-shaped weir, or \u201ckraal,\u201d made with wooden\nstakes, and waited several days for two whales to enter the trap together\nduring high tide.\n\nWhen a beluga pair finally wandered into the stockade, fishing boats blocked\ntheir retreat with splashing and yells until the tide went out, so that, in\nBarnum\u2019s description, \u201cthe frightened whales would find themselves nearly\n\u2018high and dry,\u2019 or with too little water to enable them to swim, and their\ncapture would be the next thing in order.\u201d The fishermen secured heavy ropes\naround the whales\u2019 tailfins and dragged the helpless creatures out of the\nwater and into separate seaweed-lined wooden crates. The crates were then\nloaded onto a sloop and sailed upriver to Quebec City, where they were loaded\nonto the special railcar Barnum had hired for the long trip back to New York.\n\nThe showman had already provided a thrilling account of the whale hunt to\nnewspapers in Quebec and Montreal, and telegraphed communities along the train\nroute announcing the impending arrival of the crated whales. \u201cThe result of\nthese arrangements may be imagined: at every station crowds of people came to\nthe cars to see the whales which were traveling by land to Barnum\u2019s Museum,\u201d\nBarnum crowed, \u201cand I thus secured a tremendous advertisement, seven hundred\nmiles long, for the American Museum.\u201d Upon the belugas\u2019 arrival at their\ndestination, a writer for the New-York Tribune gushed, a \u201creal live whale is\nas great a curiosity as a live lord or prince, being much more difficult to\ncatch, and far more wonderful in its appearance and habits.\u201d\n\nThe possibility of seeing a whale in New York City stimulated a curiosity so\nimplacable... that the moral sense could not be engaged.\n\nBarnum\u2019s advance publicity effort ensured that by the time the whales sloshed\ninto their ice-cooled tank, in the dank basement of the American Museum,\nthousands of New Yorkers crowded the entrance, impatient to lay eyes on the\ngreat \u201cwhite whales.\u201d They would have to hurry: These two belugas would not be\nat the museum long. \u201cI did not know how to feed or take care of the monsters,\nand, moreover, they were in fresh water, and this, with the bad air in the\nbasement, may have hastened their death, which occurred a few days after their\narrival, but not before thousands of people had seen them,\u201d wrote Barnum, with\nevident overall satisfaction, in one of his autobiographies.\n\nBarnum\u2019s American Museum handbill, 1864.\n\nBarnum being Barnum, he \u201cresolved to try again.\u201d Weeks later, he had installed\na new tank made of slate and thick glass plates, twenty-four feet square, on\nthe museum\u2019s more commodious second floor. Fresh water from city taps was\nreplaced with murky brackish water from the mouth of the East River; Barnum\nhad situated a steam-powered pumping apparatus at the harbor\u2019s edge and laid a\nnetwork of iron pipes under city streets (with the purchased permission of a\nManhattan alderman) to ensure that his next two Labrador whales bobbed before\nvisitors in a circulating supply of untreated harbor water.\n\nAlas, these whales quickly died as well\u2014\u201ctheir sudden and immense popularity\nwas too much for them,\u201d Barnum later quipped. If museum visitors were troubled\nby the serial cetacean fatalities, it did not deter them from paying their\ntwenty-five-cent admission fees and lingering in the second-floor galleries to\nbehold their short-term antics. And so, Barnum continued to exhibit whales on\nthe second floor of his museum, one pair after another, in cheerful, morbid\nsuccession. \u201cNOW IS THE TIME to see these wonders,\u201d declared a newspaper\nadvertisement announcing the most recent arrivals in 1865, \u201cas THEIR LIVES ARE\nUNCERTAIN.\u201d\n\nIt is disconcerting to see that phrase there, in stark capital letters, and to\nimagine how little it seemed to have troubled the moral sense of the man who\npaid to have it printed\u2014to say nothing of the countless men, women, and\nchildren drawn to the museum in droves by this grim sales pitch.\n\nPerhaps the most charitable way to imagine it is that the possibility of\nseeing a whale in New York City stimulated a curiosity so implacable\u2014the\nirresistible pull, in an era before it was easy to visit zoos or aquaria or\ntravel long distances, of seeing creatures that had been brought so far, with\na physiology so enormous and strange\u2014that the moral sense could not be\nengaged. But that supposition makes it all the more remarkable that, by the\nfollowing year, the arrival of the animal-welfare idea would render such\nflagrant disregard for animal suffering and death in a New York newspaper\nadvertisement nearly inconceivable: arguably illegal, but perhaps more\nimportant, unfashionable.\n\n__________________________________\n\nFrom Our Kindred Creatures: How Americans Came to Feel the Way They Do about\nAnimals by Bill Wasik and Monica Murphy.
