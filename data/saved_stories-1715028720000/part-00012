(Shinnosuke Ito)\n\nEvery time an earthquake occurs in Japan, social media sites are filled with\nposts saying things like: \u201cThere have been many earthquakes lately, haven\u2019t\nthere?\u201d\n\nScientists who actually know about such things say statistics show no recent\nincrease in quake frequency. But they do warn about waves of online quake\ninformation, often inaccurate or blatantly false, that could be affecting\npeople\u2019s perceptions of seismic activity.\n\nAccording to the Japan Meteorological Agency, 89 earthquakes of intensity of 4\nor higher on the Japanese seismic scale of 7 were observed nationwide from\nJanuary to the end of April this year. An intensity of 4 creates shaking that\n\u201csurprises most people,\u201d the JMA said.\n\nOver the same period for the last three years, the number of earthquakes of\nintensity 4 or higher was nine in 2023, 22 in 2022, and 21 in 2021.\n\nThe 89 figure of this year stands out.\n\nMany posts on X say, \u201cThere have been many earthquakes lately, haven\u2019t there?\u201d\n(Ryo Oyama)\n\nBut 66 of those tremors were related to the destructive Noto Peninsula\nearthquake that hit on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nIf those quakes are deducted from the total, 2024 has been a fairly normal\nyear so far.\n\nNaoshi Hirata, a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo who chairs the\ncentral government\u2019s earthquake research committee, was asked about the matter\nat a news conference in April.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the statistics, there is no indication that earthquakes are\nvery frequent right now,\u201d Hirata said.\n\nFrom May 2014 to April 2024, Japan recorded 717 earthquakes of intensity 4 or\nhigher.\n\nFor the previous 10-year period, from May 2004 to April 2014, the number of\nsuch earthquakes was 831. And for the decade before that, from May 1994 to\nApril 2004, the figure was 701.\n\nThe figures have remained generally unchanged so far this century.\n\nHirata noted that even in the world of seismology, which analyzes earthquakes\non a long-term scale, such as 100 years, \u201cit is normal for earthquakes to\noccur with this frequency in Japan.\u201d\n\nKatsuya Yamori, a professor at Kyoto University\u2019s Disaster Prevention Research\nInstitute who is an expert on the psychology of disaster prevention, had a\ntheory on why some social media users feel there are so many more earthquakes\nthese days.\n\n\u201cIt is probably because people have come to experience earthquakes as a social\nphenomenon,\u201d he said.\n\nIf a major quake struck Japan in the Edo Period (1603-1867), when there was no\ninternet or TV, people in faraway areas would not \u201cexperience\u201d it, Yamori\nsaid.\n\nIn contrast, \u201cPeople who live in the internet society experience earthquakes\nthrough the words, actions and images of others on TV and the internet, even\nif they do not feel the tremors themselves and do not see collapsed buildings\nin front of them,\u201d Yamori said.\n\nFurthermore, smartphones and social media have become common communication\ntools, and news sites and disaster prevention applications have been enhanced.\n\n\u201cPeople have more opportunities to come into contact with information on\nquakes in distant areas, so they now experience quakes not only as natural\nphenomena but also as social phenomena,\u201d Yamori said.\n\nIn other words, the recent \u201cincrease in earthquakes\u201d is more about the\n\u201cincrease in postings and information about earthquakes,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough it is useful for people to share their earthquake stories to increase\nawareness in preparing for disasters, equating information found online with\nreal experiences can be dangerous.\n\nAfter the Noto Peninsula earthquake, many false rescue requests were posted on\nsocial media.\n\nUploaded images of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami and the\n2004 Kumamoto Earthquakes were falsely described as damage on the Noto\nPeninsula.\n\nMany people believed such fake information was real and spread it out of good\nintentions.\n\nSatoshi Harada, who heads the JMA\u2019s earthquake and tsunami monitoring\ndivision, urges people to \u201cimprove their daily preparedness rather than feel\nafraid because they believe there are many more earthquakes occurring.\u201d\n\n## Related News\n\n  * Tsunami fears for Noto region if major quakes continue to hit\n\nMay 7, 2023\n\n  * Water could be causing mystery quakes, land rise in Ishikawa\n\nJanuary 19, 2022\n\n  * Experts caught off guard by intensity of Jan. 1 Noto earthquake\n\nJanuary 2, 2024\n\n  * Noto earthquake information was slow in reaching Kishida in Tokyo\n\nFebruary 2, 2024\n\n  * Trapped water could be behind quake swarm in Ishikawa\n\nMay 6, 2023\n\n  * Experts warn Ishikawa quakes likely to continue for months\n\nJune 21, 2022\n\n  * Share\n  * Tweet list\n\n  * Print\n\n## Trending Now\n\n  1.
