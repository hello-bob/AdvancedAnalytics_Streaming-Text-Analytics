Why are so many devices\nallowing attacks?\n\nDan Goodin - 4/24/2024, 8:55 PM\n\nEnlarge\n\nGetty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n26\n\nHackers backed by a powerful nation-state have been exploiting two zero-day\nvulnerabilities in Cisco firewalls in a five-month-long campaign that breaks\ninto government networks around the world, researchers reported Wednesday.\n\nThe attacks against Cisco\u2019s Adaptive Security Appliances firewalls are the\nlatest in a rash of network compromises that target firewalls, VPNs, and\nnetwork-perimeter devices, which are designed to provide a moated gate of\nsorts that keeps remote hackers out. Over the past 18 months, threat\nactors\u2014mainly backed by the Chinese government\u2014have turned this security\nparadigm on its head in attacks that exploit previously unknown\nvulnerabilities in security appliances from the likes of Ivanti, Atlassian,\nCitrix, and Progress. These devices are ideal targets because they sit at the\nedge of a network, provide a direct pipeline to its most sensitive resources,\nand interact with virtually all incoming communications.\n\n## Cisco ASA likely one of several targets\n\nOn Wednesday, it was Cisco\u2019s turn to warn that its ASA products have received\nsuch treatment. Since November, a previously unknown actor tracked as UAT4356\nby Cisco and STORM-1849 by Microsoft has been exploiting two zero-days in\nattacks that go on to install two pieces of never-before-seen malware,\nresearchers with Cisco\u2019s Talos security team said. Notable traits in the\nattacks include:\n\n  * An advanced exploit chain that targeted multiple vulnerabilities, at least two of which were zero-days\n  * Two mature, full-feature backdoors that have never been seen before, one of which resided solely in memory to prevent detection\n  * Meticulous attention to hiding footprints by wiping any artifacts the backdoors may leave behind. In many cases, the wiping was customized based on characteristics of a specific target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose characteristics, combined with a small cast of selected targets all in\ngovernment, have led Talos to assess that the attacks are the work of\ngovernment-backed hackers motivated by espionage objectives.\n\n\u201cOur attribution assessment is based on the victimology, the significant level\nof tradecraft employed in terms of capability development and anti-forensic\nmeasures, and the identification and subsequent chaining together of 0-day\nvulnerabilities,\u201d Talos researchers wrote. \u201cFor these reasons, we assess with\nhigh confidence that these actions were performed by a state-sponsored actor.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also warned that the hacking campaign is likely targeting\nother devices besides the ASA. Notably, the researchers said they still don\u2019t\nknow how UAT4356 gained initial access, meaning the ASA vulnerabilities could\nbe exploited only after one or more other currently unknown\nvulnerabilities\u2014likely in network wares from Microsoft and others\u2014were\nexploited.\n\n\u201cRegardless of your network equipment provider, now is the time to ensure that\nthe devices are properly patched, logging to a central, secure location, and\nconfigured to have strong, multi-factor authentication (MFA),\u201d the researchers\nwrote. Cisco has released security updates that patch the vulnerabilities and\nis urging all ASA users to install them promptly.\n\nUAT4356 started work on the campaign no later than last July when it was\ndeveloping and testing the exploits. By November, the threat group first set\nup the dedicated server infrastructure for the attacks, which began in earnest\nin January. The following image details the timeline:\n\nEnlarge\n\nCisco\n\nOne of the vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-20359, resides in a now-\nretired capability allowing for the preloading of VPN clients and plug-ins in\nASA. It stems from improper validation of files when they\u2019re read from the\nflash memory of a vulnerable device and allows for remote code execution with\nroot system privileges when exploited. UAT4356 is exploiting it to backdoors\nCisco tracks under the names Line Dancer and Line Runner. In at least one\ncase, the threat actor is installing the backdoors by exploiting\nCVE-2024-20353, a separate ASA vulnerability with a severity rating of 8.6 out\nof a possible 10.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n26\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
