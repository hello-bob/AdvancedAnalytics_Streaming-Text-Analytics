Pressdram\n\n### How to respond to a frivolous legal threat\n\nShaun Usher\n\nMar 29, 2022\n\n39\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Arkell v. Pressdram\n\nnews.lettersofnote.com\n\n2\n\nShare\n\nThe following letter can be found in More Letters of Note. Grab a copy here.\n\nJames Arkell\u2019s solicitor as he reads the reply from Private Eye magazine (not\nactual footage). Photo: Getty.\n\nIn April of 1971, in an article that lasted a single paragraph, Private Eye1\nmagazine alleged that one James Arkell, in his role as Retail Credit Manager\nof Granada TV Rental Ltd, had for some time been receiving monthly backhanders\nfrom a debt collection agency used by his employer. Arkell was less than\npleased, and before long a letter arrived at Private Eye\u2019s offices in which\nhis solicitors demanded a retraction and damages for their client. That letter\ncan be read below, as can an uncompromising reply which has since become\nfamous in legal and publishing circles for reasons that will become clear.\n\nNever ones to miss an opportunity, Private Eye published the exchange very\nquickly, and almost immediately Arkell withdrew his complaint. The magazine\nhave since used the dispute as shorthand when responding to threats\u2014e.g. \u201cWe\nrefer you to the reply given in the case of Arkell v. Pressdram.\u201d\u2014as have\nrecipients of legal threats in the wider world.\n\nNote: \u2018Pressdram Ltd\u2019 is Private Eye\u2019s publisher. Also, there was no \u201ccase\u201d\nlegally, despite the name by which the dispute is now known.\n\n> 29th April 1971\n>\n> Dear Sir,\n>\n> We act for Mr Arkell who is Retail Credit Manager of Granada TV Rental Ltd.\n> His attention has been drawn to an article appearing in the issue of Private\n> Eye dated 9th April 1971 on page 4. The statements made about Mr Arkell are\n> entirely untrue and clearly highly defamatory. We are therefore instructed\n> to require from you immediately your proposals for dealing with the matter.\n>\n> Mr Arkell\u2019s first concern is that there should be a full retraction at the\n> earliest possible date in Private Eye and he will also want his costs paid.\n> His attitude to damages will be governed by the nature of your reply.\n>\n> Yours, Goodman Derrick & Co.\n\n> Dear Sirs,\n>\n> We acknowledge your letter of 29th April referring to Mr. J. Arkell.\n>\n> We note that Mr Arkell\u2019s attitude to damages will be governed by the nature\n> of our reply and would therefore be grateful if you would inform us what his\n> attitude to damages would be, were he to learn that the nature of our reply\n> is as follows: fuck off.\n>\n> Yours, Private Eye\n\nSupport Letters of Note for \u00a33.33/mo\n\n1\n\nPrivate Eye is a British satirical news publication founded in 1961 which,\nthanks to its unflinching commitment to uncovering scandals, is no stranger to\nlegal disputes.\n\n39 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n39\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Arkell v.
