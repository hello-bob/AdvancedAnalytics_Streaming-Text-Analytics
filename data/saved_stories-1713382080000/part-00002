L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 79\u2013489,\n60 Stat. 427, enacted July 5, 1946, codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 et seq. (15\nU.S.C. ch. 22) is the primary federal trademark statute in the United States.\nIn other words, the Act is the primary statutory foundation of United States\ntrademark law at the federal level. The Act prohibits a number of activities,\nincluding trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and false advertising.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nNamed for Representative Fritz G. Lanham of Texas, the Act was passed on July\n5, 1946, and signed into law by President Harry Truman, taking effect \"one\nyear from its enactment\", on July 6, 1947.^[1] In rare circumstances, a\nconflict will arise between trademarks that have been in use since before the\nLanham Act went into effect, thus requiring the courts to examine the dispute\naccording to the trademark act that existed before the Lanham Act.\n\nBefore its enactment, trademarks relied solely on protection under state-level\ncommon law. ^[2] Subsequent federal laws proved ineffective, leading to\nconfusion and inadequate safeguarding of marks. Trademarks persisted\nindefinitely, even if unused. The Lanham Act emerged as a long-awaited\nsolution, aiming to comprehensively regulate the creation and utilization of\ntrademarks, offering protection to both trademark owners and consumers.^[3]\n\nThe Act has been amended several times since its enactment. Its impact was\nsignificantly enhanced by the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984,^[4] which\nmade the intentional use of a counterfeit trademark or the unauthorized use of\na counterfeit trademark an offense under Title 18 of the United States\nCode,^[5] and enhanced enforcement remedies through the use of ex parte\nseizures^[6] and the award of treble profits or damages (whichever is\ngreater).^[7]\n\nIn 1999, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act inserted 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1125(d), and amended 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2)(D).\n\n### Civil enforcement[edit]\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 32 and 43 of the Act (now known as 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1124\u20131125) set out the\nremedies that can be sought when a trademark is infringed. Notably, Section\n43(a) of the Lanham Act focuses on false advertising and unfair competition,\nproviding a legal recourse for individuals and businesses.^[8]This section\nenables legal action against those engaging in misleading advertising\npractices that may cause confusion about the origin of goods or services. A\ncrucial provision within Section 43(a) allows any person who anticipates\ndamage from false advertising to initiate a civil action. These provisions\nforbid the importation of goods that infringe registered trademarks, and\nrestrict, through the use of injunctions and damages, the use of false\ndescriptions and trademark dilution.\n\n\u00a7 43(a) (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)) is the \"likelihood of confusion\" standard for\ninfringement of an unregistered trademark or trade dress, and courts still\nfrequently refer to the provision as \"Section 43(a)\":\n\n> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125 - False designations of origin, false descriptions, and\n> dilution forbidden\n>\n> (a) Civil action\n>\n> (1) Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any\n> container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or\n> device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin,\n> false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading\n> representation of fact, which\u2014\n>\n>     (A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as\n> to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another\n> person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods,\n> services, or commercial activities by another person, or\n>     (B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature,\n> characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another\n> person\u2019s goods, services, or commercial activities,\n>\n> shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she\n> is or is likely to be damaged by such act.\n\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(A) is often used when false or misleading statements\nare alleged to have hurt a consumer or business. The claimant must prove that\na false or misleading statement was made in commerce and that the statement\ncreates a likelihood of harm to the plaintiff.\n\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(B) is often used when false or misleading statements\nare alleged to have hurt a business.\n\n### Jurisprudence[edit]\n\nThe Act has been held to have extraterritorial impact,^[9] and the circuit\ncourts have been giving more favorable interpretations in extending its\nscope.^[10] The original ruling by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates,^[11] as interpreted by the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit,^[12] contemplates a three-part test in determining whether the\nAct applies (where at least two factors must be met):\n\n  1. the conduct of the defendant must have a substantial effect on United States commerce,\n  2. the defendant must be a United States citizen, and\n  3. there must be an absence of conflict with foreign law.\n\nAlthough the Lanham Act sets out clear parameters as to what constitutes\ntrademark infringement, subsequent court decisions, especially those involving\nthe Internet, have loosened the strictures.^[13]\n\nIn 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law had no impact on public\ndomain works in Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.\n\nIn 2014, the various interpretations that had been adopted by the circuit\ncourts as to who had standing to sue under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) were ousted by\nthe Court in Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, where Justice Scalia\nadopted a multi-step approach:\n\n  1. Under Article III, the plaintiff must have suffered or be imminently threatened with a concrete and particularized \"injury in fact\" that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.^[14]\n  2. AGC requires the ascertainment, as a matter of statutory interpretation, of the \"scope of the private remedy created by\" Congress, and the \"class of persons who [could] maintain a private damages action under\" a legislatively conferred cause of action.^[15]\n  3. A statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests \"fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked,\"^[16] and the \"zone of interests\" formulation applies to all statutorily created causes of action, as it is a \"requirement of general application\" and Congress is presumed to \"legislat[e] against the background of\" it, \"which applies unless it is expressly negated.\"^[17]\n  4. A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.^[18] A plaintiff suing under \u00a71125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational injury flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant's advertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.\n  5. Direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the proximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue under \u00a71125(a).\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola\nCo.^[19] that the Act complemented the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, allowing\na company to sue for infringement by way of civil action.^[20]\n\nIn 2017 Matal v. Tam, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1052(a) of the Act, denying registration to any trademarks seen as disparaging\nan individual or group, was an unconstitutional restriction of applicants'\nfreedom of speech.\n\nIn 2019 Iancu v. Brunetti, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision in 15\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1052(a) of the Act, denying registration to any trademarks seen as\nconsisting of immoral or scandalous matter, was an unconstitutional\nrestriction of applicants' freedom of speech.^[21]\n\n## Divisions[edit]\n\nIn the United States Code, the Act has been divided into four subchapters:\n\nSubchapter| Name| Sections| Description  \n---|---|---|---  \nI| The Principal Register| \u00a7\u00a7 1051\u20131072| Lanham Act, ss. 1\u201322  \nII| The Supplemental Register| \u00a7\u00a7 1091\u20131096| Lanham Act, ss. 23\u201328  \nIII| General Provisions| \u00a7\u00a7 1111\u20131127| Lanham Act, ss. 29\u201345  \n\u00a7 1128| later creation of the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement\nCoordination Council  \n\u00a7 1129| passage of prohibitions against cyberpiracy originally codified here,\nbut now covered by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 8131  \nIV| The Madrid Protocol| \u00a7\u00a7 1141\u20131141n| later passage, in consequence of US\naccession to the Madrid system  \n  \n### The Trademark Registers[edit]\n\nSubchapter I sets forth the requirements that a mark must meet to receive a\nregistration on the Principal Register, which bestows various rights on the\ntrademark owner to prevent others from infringing their mark. Among the\nrequirements are prohibitions against the registration of marks that are\nconfusingly similar to existing marks, are generic or merely descriptive, are\nscandalous or immoral, or fall onto certain other prohibited categories.\nSubchapter I also sets forth certain procedural requirements, such as the\nsubmission of an affidavit of continued use after five years of registration.\n\nSubchapter II sets forth a form of registration on the Supplemental Register,\nfor certain marks that are unregistrable under Subchapter I, but may become\nregistrable in the future, such as those that are merely descriptive. This\nform of registration, while not granting all the protections of registration\non the Principal Register, does provide notice to potential infringers that\nthe mark is in use, and also provides some procedural benefits.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * International cybercrime\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Lanham Act, \u00a7 46.\n  2. ^ \"Lanham Act | UpCounsel 2023\".
