The lock\u2019s maker Chirp Systems\nremains unresponsive, even though it was first notified about the critical\nweakness in March 2021. Meanwhile, Chirp\u2019s parent company, RealPage, Inc., is\nbeing sued by multiple U.S. states for allegedly colluding with landlords to\nillegally raise rents.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n(CISA) warned about a remotely exploitable vulnerability with \u201clow attack\ncomplexity\u201d in Chirp Systems smart locks.\n\n\u201cChirp Access improperly stores credentials within its source code,\npotentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized access,\u201d CISA\u2019s\nalert warned, assigning the bug a CVSS (badness) rating of 9.1 (out of a\npossible 10). \u201cChirp Systems has not responded to requests to work with CISA\nto mitigate this vulnerability.\u201d\n\nMatt Brown, the researcher CISA credits with reporting the flaw, is a senior\nsystems development engineer at Amazon Web Services. Brown said he discovered\nthe weakness and reported it to Chirp in March 2021, after the company that\nmanages his apartment building started using Chirp smart locks and told\neveryone to install Chirp\u2019s app to get in and out of their apartments.\n\n\u201cI use Android, which has a pretty simple workflow for downloading and\ndecompiling the APK apps,\u201d Brown told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cGiven that I am pretty\npicky about what I trust on my devices, I downloaded Chirp and after\ndecompiling, found that they were storing passwords and private key strings in\na file.\u201d\n\nUsing those hard-coded credentials, Brown found an attacker could then connect\nto an application programming interface (API) that Chirp uses which is managed\nby smart lock vendor August.com, and use that to enumerate and remotely lock\nor unlock any door in any building that uses the technology.\n\nBrown said when he complained to his leasing office, they sold him a small $50\nkey fob that uses Near-Field Communications (NFC) to toggle the lock when he\nbrings the fob close to his front door. But he said the fob doesn\u2019t eliminate\nthe ability for anyone to remotely unlock his front door using the exposed\ncredentials and the Chirp mobile app.\n\nA smart lock enabled with Chirp. Image: Camdenliving.com\n\nAlso, the fobs pass the credentials to his front door over the air in plain\ntext, meaning someone could clone the fob just by bumping against him with a\nsmartphone app made to read and write NFC tags.\n\nNeither August nor Chirp Systems responded to requests for comment. It\u2019s\nunclear exactly how many apartments and other residences are using the\nvulnerable Chirp locks, but multiple articles about the company from 2020\nstate that approximately 50,000 units use Chirp smart locks with August\u2019s API.\n\nRoughly a year before Brown reported the flaw to Chirp Systems, the company\nwas bought by RealPage, a firm founded in 1998 as a developer of multifamily\nproperty management and data analytics software. In 2021, RealPage was\nacquired by the private equity giant Thoma Bravo.\n\nBrown said the exposure he found in Chirp\u2019s products is \u201can obvious flaw that\nis super easy to fix.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of them being motivated to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re\npart of a private equity company now, so they\u2019re not answerable to anybody.\nIt\u2019s too bad, because it\u2019s not like residents of [the affected] properties\nhave another choice. It\u2019s either agree to use the app or move.\u201d\n\nIn October 2022, an investigation by ProPublica examined RealPage\u2019s dominance\nin the rent-setting software market, and that it found \u201cuses a mysterious\nalgorithm to help landlords push the highest possible rents on tenants.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor tenants, the system upends the practice of negotiating with apartment\nbuilding staff,\u201d ProPublica found. \u201cRealPage discourages bargaining with\nrenters and has even recommended that landlords in some cases accept a lower\noccupancy rate in order to raise rents and make more money. One of the\nalgorithm\u2019s developers told ProPublica that leasing agents had \u2018too much\nempathy\u2019 compared to computer generated pricing.\u201d\n\nLast year, the U.S. Department of Justice threw its weight behind a massive\nlawsuit filed by dozens of tenants who are accusing the $9 billion apartment\nsoftware company of helping landlords collude to inflate rents.\n\nIn February 2024, attorneys general for Arizona and the District of Columbia\nsued RealPage, alleging RealPage\u2019s software helped create a rental monopoly.\n\nThis entry was posted on Monday 15th of April 2024 10:51 AM\n\nA Little Sunshine Latest Warnings Security Tools\n\nAugust.com Chirp Systems Matt Brown ProPublica RealPage Inc.

If there is a flaw in a car to could\n\u2018potentially\u2019 cause an accident \u2013 recalls can be mandated (often done\nvoluntarily before mandated). Why can\u2019t we get that sort of system enacted for\nCyber? Also, seems like a class action lawsuit could be filed...\u2019did knowingly\ncontinue to provide devices for security while aware said devices contain\nflaws that do the opposite\u2019.

Wannabe Techguy April 15, 2024\n\nSo yet again, a flaw that could be easily fixed if the companies wanted to?\nWhy am I not surprised? BTW, I\u2019ve never heard of negotiating your rent. I\u2019ve\nalways thought whatever they tell you is it.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  5. Bill Horvath April 15, 2024\n\nIf I remember right, August is one of the few companies making Homekit locks.\nI wonder if Apple knows about this one yet?\n\nReply \u2192\n\n    1. RWKOS April 15, 2024\n\nWas wondering the same.\n\nBrian, what is not clear from the article, at least to my level of knowledge,\nis whether the August locks are also affected.\n\nDoes the problem begin with August, or is intrinsic to something Chirp does\nwith August\u2019s product.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n  6. Roger Chase April 15, 2024\n\nWhy don\u2019t everyone using these locks just take the batteries out and use a\nkey.. I\u2019m sure if enough of the tenants get together and insist on keys the\nmanagers would do it or better yet take it to court.\n\nReply \u2192\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMailing List\n\nSubscribe here\n\nSearch KrebsOnSecurity\n\nRecent Posts\n\n  * Crickets from Chirp Systems in Smart Lock Key Leak\n  * Why CISA is Warning CISOs About a Breach at Sisense\n  * Twitter\u2019s Clumsy Pivot to X.com Is a Gift to Phishers\n  * April\u2019s Patch Tuesday Brings Record Number of Fixes\n  * Fake Lawsuit Threat Exposes Privnote Phishing Sites\n\nStory Categories\n\n  * A Little Sunshine\n  * All About Skimmers\n  * Ashley Madison breach\n  * Breadcrumbs\n  * Data Breaches\n  * DDoS-for-Hire\n  * Employment Fraud\n  * How to Break Into Security\n  * Internet of Things (IoT)\n  * Latest Warnings\n  * Ne'er-Do-Well News\n  * Other\n  * Pharma Wars\n  * Ransomware\n  * Russia's War on Ukraine\n  * Security Tools\n  * SIM Swapping\n  * Spam Nation\n  * Target: Small Businesses\n  * Tax Refund Fraud\n  * The Coming Storm\n  * Time to Patch\n  * Web Fraud 2.0\n\nWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia\n\n\u00a9 Krebs on Security - Mastodon\n\n", "frontpage": false}
