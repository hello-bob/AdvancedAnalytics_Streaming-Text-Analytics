OpenAI was first\nto market and has already monetized its APIs and LLM access. Now Google is\nplanning to emulate this through its cloud and AI Studio services, and it\nseems the days of unfettered free access are numbered.\n\n## RIP PaLM API\n\nIn an email to developers, Google said it was shutting down access to its PaLM\nAPI (the pre-Gemini model which was used to build custom chatbots) to\ndevelopers via AI Studio on August 15. This API was deprecated back in\nFebruary.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\nThe tech giant is hoping to convert free users into paying customers by\npromoting the stable Gemini 1.0 Pro. \u201cWe encourage testing prompts, tuning,\ninference, and other features with stable Gemini 1.0 Pro to avoid\ninterruptions,\" The email reads. \u201cYou can use the same API key you used for\nthe PaLM API to access Gemini models through Google AI SDKs.\u201d\n\nPricing for the paid plan begins at $7 for one million input tokens and rises\nto $21 for the same number of output tokens.\n\nThere is one exception to Google\u2019s plans - PaLM and Gemini will remain\naccessible to customers paying for Vertex AI in Google Cloud. However, as\nHPCWire points out, \u201cRegular developers on cheaper budgets typically use AI\nStudio as they cannot afford Vertex.\u201d\n\n## Are you a pro?
