It supports C89, C99,\nmost of C11/C17 and most compiler extensions provided by gcc, clang, and\nVisual Studio. A variant of CBMC that analyses Java bytecode is available as\nJBMC.\n\nCBMC verifies memory safety (which includes array bounds checks and checks for\nthe safe use of pointers), checks for exceptions, checks for various variants\nof undefined behavior, and user-specified assertions. Furthermore, it can\ncheck C and C++ for I/O equivalence with other languages, such as Verilog. The\nverification is performed by unwinding the loops in the program and passing\nthe resulting equation to a decision procedure.\n\nCBMC is available for most flavours of Linux (pre-packaged on Debian, Ubuntu\nand Fedora), Windows and MacOS X. You should also read the CBMC license (BSD\n4-clause). For questions about CBMC, contact Daniel Kroening.\n\nCBMC comes with a built-in solver for bit-vector formulas that is based on\nMiniSat. As an alternative, CBMC has featured support for external SMT solvers\nsince version 3.3. The solvers we recommend are (in no particular order)\nBoolector, CVC5 and Z3. Note that these solvers need to be installed\nseparately and have different licensing conditions.\n\n## CBMC News\n\nI did a website refresh. It's got dark mode!\n\n## CBMC Documentation\n\n  * The CPROVER Manual contains a tutorial from a user's point of view and describes what properties are checked.\n\n  * A set of slides on CBMC: PDF, 2x3 handouts. The sources are available here.\n\n  * The primary reference for CBMC is A Tool for Checking ANSI-C Programs (ca. 1900 citations).\n\nWe also have a list of interesting applications of CBMC.\n\n## CBMC Download\n\nWe are maintaining CBMC for x86 Linux, Windows and MacOS.\n\nWindows| Download cbmc-5.95.1-win64.msi, and then double-click to install.\nThis is an x64 binary for the command line (there is no GUI). You will need to\nrun CBMC from the Visual Studio Command Prompt.We recommend you install the\nfree Visual Studio Community.  \n---|---  \nUbuntu 24.04 and Debian trixie| Do apt-get install cbmc to install. This will\ngive you cbmc 5.95.1.  \nDebianUbuntu 20.04 and 22.04| While the current stable Debian and Ubuntu\n20/22.04 do have a cbmc package, this package is at version 5.12, which is\nmore than a decade old. Download one of the following binary packages: 64-bit\nUbuntu 20.04/x64: ubuntu-20.04-cbmc-5.95.1-Linux.deb 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04/x64:\nubuntu-22.04-cbmc-5.95.1-Linux.deb Do dpkg -i\nubuntu-20.04-cbmc-5.95.1-Linux.deb to install.  \nFedora| On Fedora 18 or newer, you can do yum install cbmc This will give you\nversion 5.50.  \nMacOS| To get a recent version of CBMC, consider using Homebrew, and then do\nbrew install cbmcThis is a command-line tool only, there is no GUI. You need\nto have the Command Line Tools for Xcode, which can be downloaded by running\nthe Xcode application or from here.  \nSource Code| Source code is available here.  \n  \nIf you need a Model Checker for Verilog or SMV files, consider EBMC. For Java,\nuse JBMC.\n\nThis research was sponsored by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)\nunder contract no. 99-TJ-684, the National Science Foundation (NSF) under\ngrant no.
