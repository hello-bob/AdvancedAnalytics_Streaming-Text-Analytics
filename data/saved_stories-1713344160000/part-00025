Maybe both. Both is good.\n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years since Windows XP support expired. That\u2019s a whole decade,\npeople! But when I recently posted a meme \u201ccelebrating\u201d the occasion, I\nstarted hearing from people who \u2014 God help them \u2014 are still using XP.\n\nOne person told me he believes XP still lives on at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space\nFlight Center on old systems still running Windows XP Embedded (XPe). Why?\nBecause their manufacturers wouldn\u2019t (couldn\u2019t?) update their systems. Of\ncourse, NASA could replace them... but at a six-figure price for new gear, no\none has the budget to do it.\n\nI can believe that \u2014 I used to work at Goddard in the late 1980s, and one of\nmy projects was running an online system to track the real-time status of NASA\nSpace Shuttle communication links. Among the systems I ran herd on was a\ntertiary Shuttle data connection that was a 110-baud Telex line to Bermuda\ndating to the 1950s. It worked, but that\u2019s all you could say about it.\n\nThen, as now, we kept it going because NASA didn\u2019t have the money to replace\nit. (NASA, by the way, has never had anything like the budget it needs since\nthe 1960s and the Apollo moon landings.)\n\nBut I digress.\n\nNASA\u2019s not the only one stuck with running XP. Several people told me their\nmedical facilities are still running XPe systems, too. Yet another tells me\nhis engineering lab is doing the same thing. The reason? Once more, it works\nand there\u2019s no money to replace the equipment.\n\nBut, you say, those are corner cases, oddball situations. No one is really\nrunning XP on a PC anymore are they? ARE THEY?\n\nYes, in fact, they are.\n\nAccording to StatCounter, as of March 2024, 0.39% of desktops are still\nrunning Windows XP. Let\u2019s do a little math. Microsoft claims there are 1.4\nbillion Windows PCs in the world, so that means we still have not quite 5.5\nmillion XP computers up and running dsomewhere. And since StatCounter gets its\nnumbers from systems connected to the Internet, that means we have about 5.5\nmillion compromised PCs around the globe.\n\nEek!\n\nThe classic justification is that, \u201cIt\u2019s working just fine! Why should I spend\nany money on it!?\u201d My 1991 Toyota MR-2 worked just fine for decades, too, but\nI still wouldn\u2019t drive in a demolition derby without brakes or a seat belt.\n\nIt\u2019s not just XP though. There\u2019s a lot of archaic systems still out there in\nproduction.\n\nFor example, if you think XP is way too old to run for work, consider the\nGerman railroad company that was recently looking for a Windows for Workgroups\n3.11 administrator! It turns out this software runs the \u201cdriver\u2019s cab display\nsystem on high-speed and regional trains [which] shows the driver the most\nimportant technical data in real-time.\u201d\n\nI love trains, but I think I might avoid German ones.\n\nThere\u2019s another ancient system still \u201cdriving\u201d public transportation. In San\nFrancisco, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), still\nuses 5.25-in. floppy disks to run the city\u2019s Muni Metro light rail. Every\nmorning, the system boots up three floppy disks to load the Automatic Train\nControl System (ATCS) software. ATCS enables the human train operators to\nsupervise while the train drives itself.\n\nThis takes \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d to scary new levels.\n\nAt least San Francisco is upgrading its system \u2014 if officials can get the\nbudget.\n\nNow, I use old technology all the time. Under my main work desk, I keep my\n1982 vintage KayPro II computer. It still boots from its floppy drives. But I\nhaven\u2019t used it for work this century. I keep it purely out of nostalgia since\nit was my first PC.\n\nBut I\u2019m sensible about it. I keep all the other computers at hand up to date\nwith the latest patches and updates. You should, too. Doing otherwise is just\nasking for trouble.\n\nBut, before I leave you, color me curious. What\u2019s the oldest system you\u2019re\nstill using for real work?\n\n## Related content\n\n  * news\n\n#### Anthropic\u2019s latest version of Claude comes to Amazon Bedrock\n\nAmazon continues to keep the latest Anthropic generative AI models in its\ncloud.\n\nBy Jon Gold\n\nApr 16, 2024 3 mins\n\nGenerative AI Artificial Intelligence Cloud Computing\n\n  * feature\n\n#### Windows 10 Insider Previews: A guide to the builds\n\nGet the latest info on new preview builds for Windows 10 22H2 as they roll out\nfrom Microsoft.
