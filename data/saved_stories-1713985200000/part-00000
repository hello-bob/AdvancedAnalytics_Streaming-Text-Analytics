The only named\ndefendant, a software developer from Washington, denies any involvement with\nthe hack and the pirate library, suggesting that the plaintiffs targeted the\nwrong person. With a motion to dismiss, the defendant hopes to end the case\nhere and now.\n\nAnna\u2019s Archive is a meta-search engine for shadow libraries that allows users\nto find pirated books and other related sources.\n\nThe site launched in the fall of 2022, just days after Z-Library was targeted\nin a U.S. criminal crackdown, to ensure continued availability of \u2018free\u2019 books\nand articles to the broader public.\n\nLate last year, Anna\u2019s Archive expanded its offering by making information\nfrom OCLC\u2019s proprietary WorldCat database available online. The site\u2019s\noperators took more than a year to scrape several terabytes of data and\npublished roughly 700 million unique records online, for free.\n\nThis \u2018metadata\u2019 heist was a massive breakthrough in the quest to archive as\nmuch published content as possible online. However, OCLC wasn\u2019t pleased and\nresponded with a lawsuit at an Ohio federal court, accusing the site and its\noperators of hacking and demanding damages.\n\nThe non-profit says that it spent more than a million dollars to respond to\nAnna\u2019s Archive\u2019s alleged hacking efforts. Even then, it couldn\u2019t prevent the\ndata from being released through a torrent.\n\n\u201cDefendants, through the Anna\u2019s Archive domains, have made, and continue to\nmake, all 2.2 TB of WorldCat\u00ae data available for public download through its\ntorrents,\u201d OCLC wrote in its complaint.\n\n## Who\u2019s Anna?\n\nFollowing the alleged hacking efforts, OCLC tried to identify the\nperpetrators. This investigation led them to Maria Dolores Anasztasia\nMatienzo, a resident of Seattle, Washington, who was listed as the only named\ndefendant.\n\nThe complaint mentioned that Matienzo describes herself as an \u201carchivist\u201d and\nuses the handle \u201canarchivist\u201d on social media. The defendant allegedly works\nas a software engineer at an AI startup and previously worked as a catalog\nlibrarian at a direct competitor of OCLC.\n\nFor OCLC, these and related findings were reason enough to sue Matienzo as\npart of the Anna\u2019s Archive conspiracy. However, in a motion to dismiss filed\nyesterday, Matienzo denies any involvement with the shadow library or the\nhack.\n\n\u201cI am not affiliated in any way with Anna\u2019s Archive and had no involvement in\nthe alleged hacking and/or scraping of data from WorldCat.org that was\nallegedly orchestrated and carried out by Anna\u2019s Archive,\u201d Matienzo writes in\nan accompanying declaration.\n\n## Motion to Dismiss\n\nThe motion argues for the dismissal of the claims on several grounds. For one,\nit notes that the Ohio court has no jurisdiction over the defendant, who has\nnever conducted business in the state.\n\nSecondly, the complaint only sparsely mentions Matienzo. There are six\nparagraphs with individual allegations and two others where she is mentioned\nas part of the Anna\u2019s Archive group. However, none of these include factual\nevidence, the defense argues.\n\n\u201cA review of these paragraphs reveals that the allegations contained therein\nare nothing more than conclusory statements that are unsupported by any\nfactual evidence,\u201d the motion to dismiss reads.\n\n\u201c[T]he conclusory and unsupported allegation that \u2018Matienzo owns, operates,\nand/or controls Anna\u2019s Archive,\u2019 is not sufficient to state a claim against\nMs. Matienzo.\u201d\n\nSome of the allegations\n\n## \u2018No Shred of Evidence\u2019\n\nIn total, OCLC asserts twelve claims against Matienzo including breach of\ncontract, unjust enrichment, and trespass of chattels. The defense notes that\nthese all fail, as no claims are specifically linked to her with concrete\nevidence.\n\n\u201cOCLC does not allege that it traced any of the attacks to Ms. Matienzo, that\nOCLC discovered any shred of evidence demonstrating Ms. Matienzo\u2019s alleged\nties to Anna\u2019s Archive, or that Ms. Matienzo herself committed any wrongful\nact against OCLC. This is because no such evidence exists.\u201d\n\nThe defense adds that the similarity between defendant\u2019s social media handle,\n\u2018anarchivist\u2019, and Anna\u2019s Archive is insufficient to support the claims. The\nsame applies to other facts, including her previous occupation as a catalog\nlibrarian.\n\nMatienzo consistently denied any association with Anna\u2019s Archive and\ninformally cooperated with OCLC in an attempt to resolve the lawsuit before\nspending money on a defense. However, that didn\u2019t lead to any agreement.\n\nThe defense therefore urges the Ohio federal court to dismiss all claims to\nprevent Matienzo from having to invest more time and money on the matter.\n\n\u201cIf this case is not dismissed, Ms. Matienzo will be forced to litigate a case\nin which she should have never been named as a defendant in a venue thousands\nof miles across the country from her state of domicile,\u201d the defense adds.\n\n\u2014\n\nA copy of the full motion to dismiss, filed yesterday at the U.S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of Ohio, is available here (pdf)\n\n  * Next Post\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * Anna's Archive\n  * oclc\n  * worldcat\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### Dutch Court Orders ISP to Block \u2018Anna\u2019s Archive\u2019 and \u2018LibGen\u2019\n\n  * March 22, 2024, 16:35 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nLawsuits\n\n### Lawsuit Accuses Anna\u2019s Archive of Hacking WorldCat, Stealing 2.2 TB Data\n\n  * February 7, 2024, 19:43 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### Silenzio! \u2018Anna\u2019s Archive\u2019 Shadow Library Blocked Following Publishers\u2019\nComplaint\n\n  * January 4, 2024, 09:14 by Andy Maxwell\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nU.S. House Passes Copyright \u201cSmall Claims\u201d Bill with Overwhelming Majority\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nHollywood Wins Pirate Site Blocking Expansion in Australia\n\nU.S. House Passes Copyright \u201cSmall Claims\u201d Bill with Overwhelming Majority\n\nUK Considers Throwing Persistent Internet Pirates in Jail\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14963\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": true}
