It\nreported that 61% of Gen Z said they can\u2019t imagine doing work tasks without\nusing generative AI \u2014 the most out of any of the generations.\n\nDavis said that we should definitely \u201cembrace technology and AI\u201d but said\ncopying answers from ChatGPT can hurt your chances of getting a job.\n\nA Resume Genius survey of 625 hiring managers found that over half disliked\nAI-generated resumes and would consider it a red flag that would make them\nless likely to hire a candidate.\n\n## \u2019100 identical responses\u2019\n\nOne of the reasons why copying ChatGPT\u2019s responses is an ineffective way of\nusing AI is that the chatbot does not always provide reliable information.\n\nOne initial issue with ChatGPT was that its knowledge base was limited to data\nreleased before September 2021 but this was resolved in September 2023, its\nowner OpenAI announced on X.\n\n\u201cChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce\nincorrect answers,\u201d it says on the company website. \u201cIt has limited knowledge\nof world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful\ninstructions or biased content.\u201d\n\nDavis shared a recent story from an employer she works with who was hiring for\na brand marketing position, and asked a question in the job application about\ncandidates\u2019 favorite fitness-related product launches in the past year.\n\n\u201cThey said they got about 100 identical responses of \u2018my favorite campaign\nlaunch was Peloton\u2019 and the employer was like \u2018ultimately that was ChatGPT,\nbut then also equally Peloton was released like four or five years ago\u2019,\u201d\nDavis said. The employer was referring to an ad campaign from Peloton in 2020.\n\nDavis said that young people \u201cneed to educate themselves\u201d on how to use\nChatGPT properly and not just to copy answers.\n\n## \u2018It should be used as a tool, not a replacement\u2019\n\nThere are several uses for AI in the job application process from helping you\nprep for interviews or researching a company.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, you can use ChatGPT in the job search process but it should be\nused as a tool, not a replacement,\u201d Davis warned.\n\nMichelle Reisdorf, district director at recruitment firm Robert Half, shared a\nsimilar view with CNBC Make It previously and said that AI is great for\n\u201cproofreading and enhancing what you\u2019ve already written but it\u2019s not a one-\nstop shop to generate the perfect resume.\u201d\n\nReisdorf added: \u201cRecruiters will be able to tell if you\u2019re not including\nspecific details from your past jobs or writing in a personal, human voice.\u201d\n\nDavis said she uses ChatGPT to help her structure documents, brainstorm ideas,\nand produce drafts but \u201cI never just type in a question and then copy and\npaste my responses.\u201d\n\n#### Stay in the loop\n\nGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inbox\n\nSign Up\n\n#### About Us\n\nLearn more about the world of CNBC Make It\n\nLearn More\n\n#### Follow Us\n\nCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel\n\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.
