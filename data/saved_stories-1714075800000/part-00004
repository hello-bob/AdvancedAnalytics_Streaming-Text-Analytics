The game was developed by Lion Entertainment and published by\nStrategic Simulations in 1994 for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. A Japanese\nversion titled Lost Dungeon (\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3) was published by T&E Soft the following\nyear.\n\n## Gameplay[edit]\n\nEnemy attacking\n\nSlayer features a customizable dungeon generator so each time the player\nstarts the game, they are faced with a new dungeon. The dungeon always ends\nwith a boss floor, randomly selected from several possible bosses. When\nstarting a new game, the player may either create a custom character with\nrandomly generated stats, pick from a selection of preset characters, or reuse\na previously created character. The game may be saved at any time, but is\nlimited to a single save slot.\n\n## Development and release[edit]\n\nSlayer was developed as part of a contract between video game corporation SSI\nand TSR, the owner and publisher of the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons &\nDragons. SSI had previously used the license to adapt the property into a\nnumber of notable games including Pool of Radiance, the Gold Box series, and\nEye of the Beholder.^[3] For Slayer, SSI gave development duties to Lion\nEntertainment, an Austin, Texas-based studio founded by Douglas Grounds in\nJune 1993.^[4] Grounds was also a producer at The 3DO Company's Austin\noffice.^[5] Lion Entertainment's principle staff for Slayer consisted of\ndirector Ronald Bollinger; programmer Glen Merriman; music composer Billy\nWolfe; sound editor Geoffrey Sanders; art director Daniel Bourbonnais; and\nartists Daniel Bourbonnais, Martin Thomas, Sara Farr, and Rebecca Price.\nGrounds served as executive producer while assisting on programming. The\ngame's 3D modeling and rendering were done by Grounds, Bollinger, and\nSanders.^[6]\n\nSlayer was released exclusively for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer by SSI in\nNorth America in September 1994^[1] and by SSI's parent company Mindscape in\nEurope in 1995. The game was published by T&E Soft in Japan on January 20,\n1995 under the title Lost Dungeon.^[2] Computer Gaming World reported months\nahead of the game's scheduled launch that SSI and TSR were dissolving their\npartnership and that Slayer would be one of the last products in that\nagreement.^[3] A version for the PlayStation was announced for an October 1995\nrelease but never materialized.^[7]^[8] SSI and Lion Entertainment did\ncollaborate on a sequel to Slayer titled Advanced Dungeons & Dragons:\nDeathKeep, released on 3DO in 1995 and Windows in 1996.^[9]^[10] Lion\nEntertainment went on to port several popular first-person shooters including\nDoom II, Duke Nukem 3D, and Quake to Macintosh before voluntarily closing in\n1999.^[4]^[11]^[12]\n\n## Reception and legacy[edit]\n\nReception\n\nReview scoresPublication| Score  \n---|---  \nComputer and Video Games| 59%^[13]  \nElectronic Gaming Monthly| 35/50^[14]  \nGamePro| 15.5/20^[15]  \nGamesMaster| 80%^[16]  \nG\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4| 79%^[17]  \nJoystick| 75%^[19]  \nM!

They criticized the music and lack of sound effects, but praised the\nabundance of options and the varied dungeon layouts, and commented that the\nadjustable difficulty make the game appropriate for players of all ages.^[15]\n\nNext Generation was generally negative to the game and gave it 2 stars out of\n5.^[21]\n\nAllen Rausch for GameSpy called Slayer \"a fantastic game\" for how rare it is,\nand that it \"was actually one of the better games\" for the 3DO system.^[29]\n\nConcordia University professor and author Mark J. P. Wolf noted Slayer as an\nexample of a game that utilizes handcrafted assets (including walls, doors,\nand windows) to give each of its dungeons a deliberate feel in their design\ndespite a reliance on random, procedural generation for their layouts.^[30]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b EGM staff (October 1994). \"Fact Files: Slayer\".
