The platform originally existed to\nsync health data from third-party fitness devices to your Google account, but\nnow it's being killed off. Deprecation of the APIs happened on May 1, and\nGoogle has stopped accepting new sign-ups for the API. The official shutdown\ndate is June 30, 2025.\n\nThe Google Fit API was launched in 2014, just a few weeks after Apple\nannounced Healthkit in iOS 8. The goal of both platforms is to be a central\nrepository for health data from various apps and services. Instead of seeing\nsteps in one app and weight in another, it could all be mushed together into a\none-stop-shop for health metrics. Google had a lot of big-name partners at\nlaunch, like Nike+, Adidas, Withings, Asus, HTC, Intel, LG, and app makers\nlike Runtastic and RunKeeper.\n\nFast-forward to 2024, and we get the familiar story of Google being unable to\nthrow its weight behind a single solution. Today, Google has three competing\nfitness APIs. There is a \"Comparison Guide\" on the Android Developer site\ndetailing the differences between the \"Health Connect\" API, the \"Fitbit Web\nAPI\" and the \"Google Fit REST API.\"\n\nBesides killing off the API, Google Fit in general seems like a dead product.\nGoogle's deal to acquire Fitbit closed in 2021, making Fitbit the shiny new\nfitness brand and bringing with it fitness API No. 2. New Google products like\nthe Pixel Watch and Pixel phones come with the Fitbit app as the built-in\nfitness solution instead of Google Fit, and the Google Fit app hasn't seen a\nsignificant upgrade in a while.\n\nGoogle's Fit API shutdown timeline.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle's new fitness API, Health Connect, has had a \"beta\" app on the Play\nStore since 2022 that only works with Android 13, and in Android 14, Health\nConnect became baked into the OS as an open source framework for storing\nhealth data. That Android 14 launch was only seven months ago, and with\nAndroid's slow update schedule and even slower developer feature adoption,\nit's hard to say too much about Health Connect. Google notes that the Play\nStore version of Health Connect and the Android 14 version of Health Connect\nare not the same thing (!), and an automatic \"migration\" pop-up screen and\ndevice reboot is needed to move to the Android 14 version. Google hasn't said\nanything about compatibility with versions of Android older than Android 14\n(or 13?), so even in 2025, Android's slow update speed means this is going to\nbe an API with low device support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne change pointed out by Google's comparison guide is that while the Fitbit\nAPI syncs health data to your Fitbit account (Fitbit accounts are also being\nshut down in 2025), and the Google Fit API syncs health data to your Google\naccount, Health Connect doesn't sync to any cloud provider. The documentation\naround Health Connect never talks about the cloud at all. From a platform\nperspective, not having cloud sync makes Health Connect more of a neutral,\nnot-Google-affiliated standard for health data storage. Google also pitches\nthe lack of cloud storage as a privacy feature. And just like how Google and\nSamsung teamed up for Wear OS (I assume this was a related project) Samsung\nhas agreed to give up on the \"Health Platform API\" and is a launch partner for\nHealth Connect.\n\nFrom a user perspective, with no cloud syncing, what happens to my health data\nif I switch devices or if my phone breaks? Can I ever easily look at my health\ndata in a more capable tablet or web app, or will that not work? For now, all\ntalk of \"sharing\" is limited to local apps or devices that directly sync to\nyour phone, like a smartwatch. The Fitbit app can show third-party Health\nConnect data right now, but it's unclear if it will sync third-party data to\nthe cloud. Google notes that \"Our Android Health API offerings have moved to\nan on-device model, so there will not be an alternative to the Fit REST API.\"\n(A REST API, by definition, is over the Internet.)\n\nThe company's migration guide notes that the Google Fit and Health Connect\nAPIs aren't compatible, and for now Google recommends supporting both while\nusers and manufacturers transition from one API to the other. The guide also\nflatly says, \"We don't recommend migrating to Health Connect if you're an\nexisting Google Fitbit Web API developer,\" and then offers no alternative, so\nit sounds like the goal is siloed on-device data only, and any devices that\nuse the web APIs will stop syncing in 2025.\n\nBy the way, despite being the same age, Apple's Healthkit ecosystem isn't\nbeing shut down and will continue running. While Google starts over, Healthkit\nwill continue growing its ecosystem and its already significant lead, and\nApple will continue to build user and developer trust.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n62\n\nRon Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in\nAndroid OS and Google products.
