Meanwhile, today\u2019s particle colliders\nare exploring a microcosmic world billions of times smaller than the smallest\natom.\n\nThese two extremes, the biggest and smallest distances probed by science, are\nseparated by 47 orders of magnitude. That\u2019s one with 47 zeros after it, a\nnumber so ludicrously huge that it isn\u2019t worth trying to get your head around.\nAnd yet, despite exploring such radically different distances and phenomena,\ncosmology and particle physics are deeply connected. Observing the motions of\nstars and galaxies can reveal the influence of as-yet-undiscovered particles,\nwhile studying fundamental particles in the lab can tell us about the birth\nand evolution of the cosmos.\n\nIntriguingly, both disciplines are grappling with unexplained results that\ncould be pointing to the existence of a new force of nature. If such a new\nforce were to be confirmed, the implications for our understanding of the\nuniverse, its history and makeup would be profound.\n\nThere are four forces that we already know about. Gravity governs the grandest\nscales, marshalling the planets in their orbits and shaping the evolution of\nthe universe as a whole. Electromagnetic force gives rise to a vast range of\nphenomena, from the magnetic field of the Earth to radio waves, visible light\nand X-rays, while also holding atoms, molecules and, by extension, the\nphysical world together. Deep within the atomic nucleus, two further forces\nemerge: the vice-like \u201cstrong force\u201d, which binds atomic nuclei, and the \u201cweak\nforce\u201d, which among other things causes radioactive decay and enables the\nnuclear reactions that power the sun and the stars.\n\nStudying these forces has transformed our understanding of nature and\ngenerated revolutionary new technologies. Work on electromagnetism in the 19th\ncentury gave us the electric dynamo and radio broadcasts, the discovery of the\nstrong and weak forces in the 1930s led to nuclear energy and atomic bombs,\nwhile understanding gravity has made it possible to put astronauts on the moon\nand to develop GPS satellites that can tell us our location anywhere on Earth\nto within a few metres. Uncovering a fifth force would be one hell of a prize.\n\n> Such a new force could help unlock a deeper structure at the base of reality\n\nHints that physicists may be on the brink of making such a breakthrough have\nbeen accumulating over the past decade. The first tranche of evidence comes\nfrom particle physics experiments here on Earth, the results of which appear\nto conflict with our current best theory of fundamental particles, the\nstandard model.\n\nNotwithstanding its rather uninspiring name, the standard model is one of\nhumankind\u2019s greatest intellectual achievements, the closest we have come to a\ntheory of everything, and has passed almost every experimental test thrown at\nit with flying colours. So far at least.\n\nHowever, the BaBar experiment in California, the Belle experiment in Japan and\nthe LHCb experiment at Cern have all spied exotic fundamental particles known\nas \u201cbeauty quarks\u201d behaving in ways that go against the predictions of the\nstandard model. Meanwhile, just outside Chicago, Fermilab\u2019s Muon g\u20132\nexperiment has been busily studying another type of fundamental particle\ncalled a muon, finding that it emits a slightly stronger magnetic field than\nexpected.\n\nThe most exciting explanations for these anomalies involve hitherto unknown\nforces of nature that subtly alter the way beauty quarks transform into other\nparticles or mess with the muon\u2019s magnetism. Such a new force could help\nunlock a deeper structure at the base of reality, explaining why we have the\nfundamental particles in nature that we do. Another tantalising possibility is\nthat it could act as a link to the unseen \u201cdark universe\u201d, made from invisible\ndark matter.\n\nThat said, for now the overall picture remains frustratingly murky. Just over\na year ago, new results from LHCb poured cold water on the prospects of a big\nbreakthrough, after missed biases were found in some of the earlier\nmeasurements. Meanwhile, theorists have been debating just how magnetic the\nmuon really ought to be, leaving open the possibility that this anomaly is\ndown to a calculational problem.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling evidence for a new force at work in the universe\ncomes from the other end of the cosmic scale. For the past few years,\ncosmology has been riven by what has become known as the \u201cHubble crisis\u201d \u2013 a\ndramatic disagreement over how fast the universe is expanding.\n\nAccording to the accepted cosmological story, the universe as we know it began\nwith the big bang around 13.8bn years ago and has been expanding ever since,\nwith galaxies carried ever farther apart as the space between them stretches.\nCosmologists have two ways of figuring out how fast space is stretching. One\ninvolves studying a host of far-off galaxies through telescopes, then\ndetermining the relationship between their distance and how fast they appear\nto be rushing away from us. The other exploits exquisitely precise maps of\nfaded light from the fireball of the big bang \u2013 known as the \u201ccosmic microwave\nbackground\u201d \u2013 to infer the properties of the infant universe. Then you apply\ncurrent cosmological theory to run the clock forward and predict how fast the\nuniverse ought to be expanding today.\n\nThe fact that these two methods give different answers is the strongest\nevidence we have that there is more to the universe than we\u2019ve imagined so\nfar. Possibilities abound. A popular proposal involves a form of energy that\ndrove the universe to expand even more rapidly than thought soon after the big\nbang. Others involve \u201cdark forces\u201d acting in the hidden world of dark matter.\nSome have even proposed that gravity itself behaves differently over the vast\nspaces between galaxies.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Inside Saturday\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But the wealth of\nemerging evidence does suggest that physics may be on the brink of something\nbig. The discovery of a new force would mark the start of a new age of\nexploration, perhaps offering a deeper understanding of the basic building\nblocks of nature, or opening the door to a vast, unknown dark realm, which,\ndespite being invisible, contains 95% of everything that exists. Such\nbreakthroughs are always hard won, but following nature\u2019s breadcrumb trail may\nsoon lead to a profound new view of the universe.\n\nHarry Cliff is the author of Space Oddities: The Mysterious Anomalies\nChallenging Our Understanding of the Universe (Picador).\n\n## Further Reading:\n\nWhite Holes: Inside the Horizon by Carlo Rovelli (Allen Lane, \u00a314.99)\n\nThe End of Everything: (Astrophysically Speaking) by Katie Mack (Penguin,\n\u00a310.99)\n\nThe Elephant in the Universe: Our Hundred-Year Search for Dark Matter by\nGovert Schilling (Belnap, \u00a324.95)\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Physics\n  * The big idea\n  * Particle physics\n  * Gravity\n  * Cern\n  * Space\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
