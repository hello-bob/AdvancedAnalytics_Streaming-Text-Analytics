Today\u2019s\nupdate is designed help to reduce the do-it-yourself complexity of SecOps and\nenhance the productivity of your entire Security Operations Center.\n\n### Turn intelligence into action\n\nAt Next \u201824, we shared how Applied Threat Intelligence can help teams turn\nintelligence into action, uncover more threats with less effort, and unlock\ndeeper threat hunting and investigation workflows. Today we are unveiling new\nfeatures that will use AI to automatically generate detections based on new\nthreat discoveries. Coming later this year, this new capability will help\nenable you to identify malicious activity operating in your environment, and\nshare clear directions that guide you through triage and response.\n\n\u201cGoogle Security Operations provides access to unique threat intelligence and\nadvanced capabilities that are highly integrated into the platform. It enables\nsecurity teams to surface the latest threats in a turnkey way that doesn\u2019t\nrequire complicated engineering,\u201d said Michelle Abraham, research director,\nIDC. \u201dGoogle is a potential partner for organizations in the fight against\nexisting and emerging threats.\u201d\n\nGoogle Security Operations is a unified, AI and intel-driven platform for\nthreat detection, investigation, and response.\n\n### Uncover the latest threats with curated detections\n\nTo help reduce manual processes and provide better security outcomes for our\ncustomers, Google Security Operations includes a rich set of curated\ndetections. Developed and maintained regularly by Google and Mandiant experts,\ncurated detections can enable customers to detect threats relevant to their\nenvironment. Notable new curated detections include:\n\n  * Cloud detections can addresses serverless threats, cryptomining incidents across Google Cloud, all Google Cloud and Security Command Center Enterprise findings, anomalous user behavior rules, machine learning-generated lists of prioritized endpoint alerts (based on factors such as user and entity context), and baseline coverage for AWS including identity, compute, data services, and secret management. We have also added detections based on learnings from the Mandiant Managed Defense team. Detections are now available in Google Security Operations Enterprise and Enterprise Plus packages.\n\n  * Frontline threat detections can provide coverage for recently-detected methodologies, and is based on threat actor tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), including from nation-states and newly-detected malware families. New threats discovered by Mandiant\u2019s elite team, including during incident response engagements, are then made available as detections. It is now available in the Google Security Operations Enterprise Plus package.\n\n### Drive productivity for all with AI-powered SecOps\n\nThe addition of Gemini in Security Operations can elevate the skills of your\nsecurity team. It can help reduce the time security analysts spend writing,\nrunning, and refining searches and triaging complex cases by approximately\nsevenfold. Security teams can search for additional context, better understand\nthreat actor campaigns and tactics, initiate response sequences and receive\nguided recommendations on next steps \u2014 all using natural language. Today we\nare sharing two exciting updates to Gemini in Security Operations.\n\nNow generally available, the Investigation Assistant feature can help security\nprofessionals make faster decisions and respond to threats with more precision\nand speed by answering questions, summarizing events, hunting for threats,\ncreating rules, and receiving recommended actions based on the context of\ninvestigations.\n\nInvestigation Assistant can help answer questions, summarize events, hunt for\nthreats, create rules, and recommend actions.\n\nPlaybook Assistant, now in preview, can help teams easily build response\nplaybooks, customize configurations, and incorporate best practices \u2014 helping\nsimplify time-consuming tasks that require deep expertise.\n\nPlaybook Assistant can help build response playbooks, customize\nconfigurations, and incorporate best practices.\n\n### Reduce manual work with autonomous parsers\n\nGetting data into the system and maintaining the pipeline is a critical yet\ntime consuming task in security operations. As log sources change and new\nfields need to be extracted, security engineers and architects are often\nrequired to spend considerable time writing new parsing logic and ensuring\nbackward compatibility.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that Google Security Operations can now\nautomatically parse log files by extracting all key-value pairs to make them\navailable for search, rules, and analytics. Available in preview, automatic\nparsing can help reduce the maintenance overhead of parsers in general, and\nalso reduce the time consuming task of creating custom parsers. It supports\nJSON-based logs, and we will be adding support for other log formats.\nAutomatically parsing log files can help security teams have the right data\nand context, making for faster and more effective investigations and detection\nauthoring.\n\n### Raise the bar for defense\n\nFor customers in need of expert support for managing Google Security\nOperations, we\u2019ve got you covered. Google Security Operations can also work in\nconcert with Mandiant Managed Defense and Mandiant Hunt, which can help you to\nreduce risks to your organization. Mandiant's team of seasoned defenders,\nanalysts, and threat hunters work seamlessly with your security team and the\nAI-infused capabilities of Google Security Operations to quickly and\neffectively hunt or monitor, detect, triage, investigate, and respond to\nincidents.\n\nAnd for our public sector customers that may have more specialized\nrequirements, we offer Google SecOps CyberShield to help governments worldwide\nbuild an enhanced cyber threat capability.\n\nTo learn more about Google Security Operations, and the rest of Google Cloud\nSecurity\u2019s comprehensive portfolio including an expanded Chrome Enterprise\necosystem, come meet us in person at our RSA Conference booth (N5644). You can\nalso catch us at our keynotes, presentations, and meetups including our\nsession, \u201cBye-Bye DIY: Frictionless Security Operations with Google,\u201d on\nTuesday, May 7, at 1:15 p.m. PDT.\n\nNot attending RSAC? Join us for our upcoming webinar, \u201cStay ahead of the\nlatest threats with intelligence-driven security operations,\u201d on Wednesday,\nMay 22, at 11:00 a.m. PDT.\n\nPosted in\n\n  * Security & Identity\n\n##### Related articles\n\nSecurity & Identity\n\n### Advancing the art of AI-driven security with Google Cloud\n\nBy Steph Hay \u2022 6-minute read\n\nSecurity & Identity\n\n### Introducing Google Threat Intelligence: Actionable threat intelligence at\nGoogle scale\n\nBy Sunil Potti \u2022 5-minute read\n\nSecurity & Identity\n\n### Chrome Enterprise expands ecosystem to strengthen endpoint security and\nZero Trust access\n\nBy Kiran Nair \u2022 3-minute read\n\nSecurity & Identity\n\n### Cloud CISO Perspectives: Tour the new Security Command Center Enterprise\n\nBy Phil Venables \u2022 5-minute read\n\n### Footer Links\n\n#### Follow us\n\n  * Google Cloud\n  * Google Cloud Products\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n  * Cookies management controls\n\n  * Help\n\n", "frontpage": false}
