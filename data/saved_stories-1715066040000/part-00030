The Guild publicly expressed frustration over stagnant\nwages and shrinking pension benefits at The Gray Lady, common worker\ngrievances.\n\nThere was one particularly interesting talking point the Times Guild returned\nto and hammered on repeatedly: the NYT\u2019s stock buyback program. Almost every\nGuild press release and tweet during this period expressed outrage over the\nNYT\u2019s share repurchase policy. The Guild characterized the NYT\u2019s repurchase\nprogram as \u201cegregious\u201d and an \u201cinsult\u201d.\n\nOne curious thing about the Guild\u2019s anger over the NYT\u2019s supposedly egregious\nand insulting repurchase policy is that over the preceding three years, the\nNYT had in fact hardly bought back any of its own stock!\n\nThe NYT\u2019s 2022 annual report reveals that the company had made nearly $500\nmillion in net income over the last three years while spending only $105\nmillion on share repurchases. And most of that $105 million simply went to\noffset the $72 million of stock-based compensation issued over that time.\n(Stock-based compensation represents the value of newly issued restricted\nstock or stock options given to employees in lieu of cash, while buybacks\nrepresent the reverse, cash given to investors for stock which is then\nretired. Any buyback program should therefore be measured net of stock\nissued.)\n\nThe NYT\u2019s net stock buyback over that timeframe would therefore have been only\n$33 million (ignoring some minor tax and option adjustments), or only 7% of\nnet income earned over the preceding three years. By comparison, the members\nof the S&P 500 (an index whose constituents make up the majority of corporate\nprofit in America) spent 44% of their net income on buybacks last year.\n\nIf the Guild wanted to be mad about the NYT\u2019s choice to give cash to\nshareholders, they could have focused their ire on the NYT\u2019s generous\ndividend, which totaled over $140 million over that period. Or they could have\nprotested the NYT\u2019s acquisition of The Athletic in 2022, which saw over $500\nmillion of the NYT\u2019s cash distributed to shareholders of a different company.\nBut no, it was Times\u2019 meager buyback that set off the Guild.\n\nSomething specifically about stock buybacks seems to trigger strong emotions:\nto most, buybacks intuitively seem frivolous, manipulative, and wasteful.\nCritics blame buybacks for a wide variety of societal ills, from inequality to\nlow productivity. Last year, Congress passed a 1% excise tax on stock\nbuybacks, with the Treasury Department stating that \u201cas the tax code has\nfavored stock buybacks, many companies have failed to reinvest profits in\ntheir workers, growth, and innovation.\u201d\n\nBut if you ask financial experts, the fuss around buybacks is much ado about\nnothing. Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Mauboussin says that buybacks are\nimportant and misunderstood, and AQR founder Cliff Asness dismisses buyback\ncriticisms as symptoms of \u201cBuyback Derangement Syndrome\u201d. And here is what\nWarren Buffett had to say about repurchases in last year\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\nannual letter:\n\n> When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the\n> country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an\n> economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not\n> mutually exclusive).\n\nSo, do buyback critics have a point, or are they a bunch of economic\nilliterates?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start with a story.\n\nYou have a job at the local widget factory, and you are living a happy life.\nYou collect a wage and spend it on cheeseburgers and beer. One day it occurs\nto you that you will one day want to retire and be able to eat cheeseburgers\nand drink beer without having to work every day at the widget factory.\n\nThe next logical step here would be to set aside some of your wages in a\nsavings account, but in our story, savings accounts haven\u2019t been invented yet.\nYou have to find some other way to defer consumption.1\n\nYou decide that you will enact your savings plan by launching a successful\nnewspaper. Like, a real, old school, print newspaper, just like the original\nNew York Times. Your plan is to cut back on the cheeseburgers and beer, and\nuse the money you save to buy a printing press and ink and hire journalists\nand pressmen.2 If people like your newspaper, they will exchange their hard\nearned dollars for your newspaper, and advertisers will supplement this with\neven more dollars to reach your readers.\n\nMost of the dollars you receive will go right back out the door to produce the\nnewspaper \u2014 to buy paper and ink and to pay the journalists and pressmen \u2014 but\nthe leftover dollars, your profit, will be enough for you to buy cheeseburgers\nand beer until you die.\n\nWe can use this little sketch to understand how private investment affects the\neconomy. In the first part of the story, you contribute to the production of\ngoods and services through your job at the widget factory, and in exchange you\nreceive pieces of paper that you trade for goods and services that others\nproduce (cheeseburgers and beer).\n\nIn the second part of the story, you choose to buy fewer cheeseburgers and\nless beer, and use your money to buy printing presses and journalists instead.\nYou are reallocating society\u2019s scarce resources (labor and land), nudging\nsociety to grow fewer hops and raise fewer cows and instead mine metal and\ncraft it into advanced machinery. Fewer farmers, more miners and craftsmen and\njournalists.\n\nOn a societal level, a successful newspaper is a good trade for everyone\ninvolved. Consumers like your newspaper enough to vote for it with their\npocketbooks. Workers like your newspaper enough to vote for it with their\nfeet. And you make enough profit to fund your retirement.\n\nYou can see the accounting behind an unsuccessful newspaper as well. Consumers\ndon\u2019t vote with their pocketbooks, workers don\u2019t vote with their feet, and\nafter your newspaper shuts down, society\u2019s scarce productive resources will be\nredirected elsewhere to produce something people actually want, perhaps to\nback to grow more hops and raise more cows.\n\nThere are certainly other important impacts on society from your newspaper\nthat are not captured by economic success or failure: perhaps your newspaper\u2019s\ncoverage creates a more well-informed electorate (good!), or maybe your\nnewspaper disseminates misinformation that sows confusion and division among\nthe masses (less good!). But we will set these externalities aside for now,\nfocused as we are on the narrow issue of stock buybacks.\n\nSuccessful ventures create economic growth by allowing society to produce more\nand better output with the same scarce inputs. That\u2019s the name of the game:\nsociety is working with a (relatively) fixed pool of labor, land, and natural\nresources, and we have to figure how best to turn that into useful economic\noutputs.\n\nNow, you are probably wondering what this all has to do with stock buybacks.\nWell, we can select individual features of a modern economy to layer onto our\nsimple model, like so:\n\nA business can be launched as a sole proprietorship, where there is no\nseparation between the owner and the company. However, in reality, any\nsignificant business venture usually is formed as some kind of limited\nliability partnership or corporation. Effectively, you take your newspaper,\nand, as SBF might put it, you drop it into a kind of invisible box.\n\nThe box is not real in a physical sense, but it is very real in a legal sense.\nThe box has a lot of useful features: it can enter into contracts, it can sue\nor be sued, it limits liability to its owner(s), and economic claims on the\nbox can be sliced in a myriad of different ways.\n\nMost importantly, nothing about the box changes the economics of the newspaper\ninside in any meaningful way. The newspaper is just as it was before, and the\nbox simply adds a useful layer of abstraction.\n\nHere is how a modern business venture looks with the addition of the box:\n\n  1. Some promoter comes along and tells you that if you put your money in a magic box today, your money will multiply, and in the future you will be able to take more money out of that box than you put in originally.\n\n  2. The promoter goes and buys ink and printing presses and hires journalists (all inside the magic box), in an effort to make their promises come true.\n\n  3. It worked! The magic box is now spitting out money and rewarding the people who put their money in the box in step 1.\n\n  4. Or, alternatively, it didn\u2019t work, too bad, maybe next time. You diversified your savings across a bunch of different boxes, right?\n\nWe need to examine step 3, where the magic box returns money to the original\ninvestors. The buyback skeptics would have us believe that it is very\nimportant how the magic box spits money back out to the original investors.\nOur task is to ascertain whether that is the case.\n\nClaim: Stock buybacks are uniquely damaging to society when compared to\ndividends.\n\nIn the olden days, if you raised equity investment to start a company (that\nis, if you sold off slices of your magic box), and it was successful, your\ninvestors would expect to receive ongoing regular cash dividends, to be paid\nout of profits. They would treat that as reliable income that they could\nexpect to use for their everyday consumption needs, e.g. cheeseburgers and\nbeer.\n\nThe proportion of profits used for dividends (the \u201cdividend payout ratio\u201d)\nwould vary by circumstance, but it was typical for that figure to reach 60% to\n80%, with the remaining 20%-40% reinvested in the business for future growth \u2014\nthink of a newspaper periodically buying larger, more efficient printing\npresses.\n\nEdgar Lawrence Smith, in his landmark 1924 study Common Stocks as Long Term\nInvestments, found that stocks had been historically undervalued because\ninvestors failed to properly appreciate the value of the \u201cprofitable\nreinvestment...of their undistributed earnings\u201d. Investors in that era mostly\njust focused on the value of the regular dividend, comparing it to the coupon\non comparable bonds. However, that 20%-40% of retained earnings, redeployed in\nthe business, compounded into higher dividends over the years, leaving fixed-\ncoupon bonds in the dust.3\n\nReturning to our model, imagine our newspaper now has a hundred investors,\neach of whom own 1% of the company. If they are all looking for a steady\nincome far into the future, then dividends work great to satisfy everyone\u2019s\nconsumption needs.\n\nBut imagine one of our hundred investors wants to make a big purchase, perhaps\none of those newfangled cars. To fund it, they want to sell their share,\nexchanging their future stream of income for a big pile of money that they can\nspend today.\n\nOne way to solve that is to have a marketplace where they can be matched with\na saver who wishes to buy a future stream of income, and make a trade. And as\nlong as there have been stocks, there have been stock exchanges where they can\ndo just that.\n\nAnother possibility is for the company to step in and buy that investor\u2019s\nshare on behalf of the remaining investors. This is a stock buyback or\nrepurchase. The company will have to part with a chunk of cash, but at the end\nof the transaction, the remaining investors will each own a larger piece of\nthe company (1.01%, instead of 1%).\n\nThere are a few reasons why this might make sense:\n\n  1. The newspaper\u2019s management team should be better informed than most about their own company\u2019s value. They are well placed to accept a good offer and pass up a bad one.\n\n  2. The group of people in the world that places the highest value on the newspaper is their current investors. Otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be holding the stock! The existing investors are natural buyers for any stock that comes on the market.\n\n  3. The newspaper is generating plenty of excess cash, which it is currently using to pay dividends.\n\nThe problem with this plan is that we already established that some of our\nshareholders are relying on the dividend to pay the bills, so our buyback plan\nis out. Oh well.\n\nAnd so it was that in the olden days, buybacks were fairly uncommon. But one\ncan start to see how repurchases could make sense, if conditions were to\nchange in the future.\n\nNow, our shareholders can still use their dividend to buy stock from the\nselling shareholders, and in fact, if our shareholders all chip in equally to\ndo so, they will be in the exact same economic position that they would have\nbeen had we cut our dividend to do the buyback.\n\nBroadly speaking, dividends and buybacks will be the same economically \u2013 they\nare just different ways to get cash from the company into the hands of\nshareholders. Buybacks initially put all of that cash into the hands of\nshareholders who want out, while dividends initially distribute the cash\nequally among all shareholders.\n\nGoing back to our history lesson: In the olden days, stock investing was\nlargely the province of a few very wealthy people buying individual stocks for\ntheir dividends. In 1900, a single share of stock would typically cost $100\n(no fractional shares back then!), at a time when the average annual income\nwas $450. There were only a couple of hundred listed companies of any size,\nand the largest among them had about 10,000 shareholders.\n\nGradually, the world of stock investing expanded. Incomes exploded, opening up\nnew demand for long-term saving, and industrial conglomerates like General\nElectric and U.S. Steel were formed, soaking up that demand. By 1920, the most\nwidely held stock was AT&T, with 130,000 individual shareholders \u2013 but that\nwas still only 0.1% of the country\u2019s population.\n\nThe Great Depression put a damper on stock investing for a while, but by the\n1950s, retail brokerages like Merrill Lynch had pushed down commissions and\nexpanded stock investing to a somewhat wider audience. In 1952, still in the\nshadow of a brutal post-Depression bear market, an NYSE survey found 6.5\nmillion shareowners in America, representing about 4% of the population at the\ntime. The go-go market of the 1960s would take this figure all the way to 31\nmillion by 1970, which represented 15% of the population, or a quarter of all\nadults.\n\nThe painful bear market of the 1970s would cause stock ownership to actually\ndecline slightly over the next decade. Open market buybacks were difficult to\nexecute under the rules of the time, but companies such as Teledyne and the\nWashington Post took advantage of the low valuations to launch tender offers\nto buy back cheap stock, often with spectacular success. Still, buybacks were\nuncommon, and dividends ruled the day.\n\nIn 1982, the SEC passed rule 10b-18, which provided a safe and legal way for\ncompanies to execute stock buybacks on the open market, without resorting to\ntender offers. This is usually falsely cited as the takeoff point for\nbuybacks, because even a full decade later, companies still strongly favored\ndividends: in 1992, companies spent $94 billion on dividends and only $22\nbillion on buybacks.\n\nThe advent of 401(k) and IRA retirement plans in the early 1980s fueled a boom\nin stock investing through mutual funds. Only 6% of households were invested\nin mutual funds in 1980, but that proportion would soar to 52% by 2001. That\nshare of households invested in mutual funds is still about the same today,\nwith the main difference being that low-cost index funds have caught up to\nactively managed funds. Meanwhile, direct ownership of stock stagnated: today,\nstill only 22% of households own stock outside of their retirement plans.\n\nThe popularity of index funds and mutual funds caused a shift from direct\nretail ownership to institutional ownership of stock (which includes pension\nfunds and mutual funds). Institutional ownership grew from about 30% in 1980\nto about 80% today.\n\nNow we have better conditions for buybacks. It is no longer the case that most\ninvestors directly buy shares in individual companies in expectation of a\nreliable passive income. We buy stock via index funds in retirement accounts,\nwith no need for current income, just the expectation that we will cash them\nout at retirement as needed. We are barely even aware of the dividends we\nreceive, because we automatically reinvest them back into more shares; we have\nno problem if companies reduce dividends to buy shares on our behalf. Also, if\nwe need cash, it\u2019s now trivial to cash out small slices of our existing\nholdings with minimal transaction costs.\n\nBuybacks do carry some minor tax advantages over dividends, but the chief\nadvantage is flexibility. In practice, regular dividends are viewed as a\ncommitment, and it is quite a commitment to pay out a dividend of 70% of one\u2019s\nnormalized earnings each and every year. A major recession or an event like\nCovid can leave a company scrambling for cash.\n\nMost companies find it much better to have a smaller regular dividend, with\nthe balance of excess cash to be returned to shareholders via a flexible\nbuyback policy; many shareholders would have just used the larger dividend to\npurchase more stock anyway, and so will be completely indifferent.\n\nToday, most companies pay a steady small dividend alongside a larger but\nfluctuating sum of cash that goes toward buybacks. In lean years, many\ncompanies omit buybacks entirely, as the NYT did in 2020 and 2021. Here is the\nS&P\u2019s chart showing how buybacks and dividends over the last 25 years, where\nwe can clearly see that buybacks now well outstrip dividends, except during\nrecessions:\n\nIn 2023, the constituents of the S&P 500 earned $1.8 trillion in aggregate,\nand only paid out a third of those earnings ($588 billion) in the form of\ndividends. They then paid out another 44% of earnings ($795 billion) in\nbuybacks, for a total payout ratio of 77%. American companies pay out about\nthe same share of their earnings that they did a century ago, a decade ago, or\nany time in between.4 It\u2019s just that over the last thirty years, the form of\nthat payout has shifted from dividends to buybacks.\n\nWhen you invest in an S&P 500 index fund in your 401(k), you are buying a\nslice of a magic box that spits out $1.8 trillion a year in earnings, and that\n$1.8 trillion will grow in the future as the constituent companies reinvest a\nsmall portion of those earnings ($400 billion) on your behalf and as they ride\nthe growth of the global economy. The other $1.4 trillion is distributed to\nyou and your fellow owners to reallocate as they please.\n\nYou can create compounding financial returns for yourself by using your share\nof that $1.4 trillion to buy more shares of the magic box from owners that\nwant out. Ignoring taxes, you are indifferent as to exactly how that happens:\nyou can use your dividends to buy shares from selling investors, or the\ncompany can use that money to buy shares from selling investors on your\nbehalf. You will end up in the same place either way.\n\nClaim: Corporations are acting immorally or dishonestly when they buy back\nstock or pay dividends.\n\nNot only is this claim illiterate, it is in a sense precisely backwards.\nRemember that the whole game is to induce people to defer consumption and put\ntheir money inside a box with the promise that if all goes well, they (or\ntheir future designees) will someday be able to take more money out of the box\nthan they put in.\n\nIf you are running a company that is throwing off cash, and you don\u2019t have\nmany opportunities for reinvestment, then your investors will say \u201chey why\ndon\u2019t you give us that cash so we can productively invest it elsewhere\u201d. If\nyou say \u201chaha no\u201d, then a) they will try to fire you if they can and b) you\nare the one acting immorally. You (or your predecessor) raised money from\ninvestors with the promise that they would make money if things went well, and\nnow you are pulling the rug on them.\n\nThe ability to return capital is a load-bearing pillar holding up capitalism.\nPeople will only put money in a box if they believe they can get it out later.\n(Insert your favorite joke here about crypto, NFTs, or airlines, but this\nstatement still rounds to being completely true.) If companies can\u2019t or won\u2019t\nreturn capital to shareholders, then people won\u2019t invest, and the system falls\napart.\n\nOne confusing aspect here is that as a society we want capital to flow to the\nmost productive projects, so companies with lots of investment opportunities\nshould be retaining their earnings for investment or even raising new money\nfrom investors, while companies with few investment opportunities should be\nreturning every dollar they can. It\u2019s always debatable what any particular\ncompany should be doing at any specific point in time. But we always expect\nsome companies to be returning capital to investors and some companies to be\nraising capital from investors.\n\nInterestingly, people intuitively understand distributions when they start a\npersonal, wholly-owned LLC for some small new consulting venture. No one\nworries that they are acting immorally by taking a distribution from their\nLLC; they understand that the LLC\u2019s money is their money, but temporarily held\ninside a box that they fully own.\n\nIf Apple has $160 billion of cash, and you own one share of Apple representing\none-sixteen-billionth of the company, then Apple is holding $10 of cash that\nbelongs to you that they will someday choose to return. People intuitively\nbelieve that Apple and their personal LLC are economically completely\ndifferent, but ignoring taxes, they are economically very similar.\n\nClaim: Stock buybacks and dividends are a \u201cwaste of money\u201d.\n\nNo! Again, this is illiterate. A company that has $100 million on deposit at\nChase has an entry in a ledger that Chase maintains that entitles the company\nto $100 million of goods or services in the future.\n\nLet\u2019s say that the company has ten shareholders that each own 10% of the\ncompany, and it decides to distribute that $100 million to those shareholders\nvia a dividend.\n\nWhat happens now? Chase reduces the company\u2019s ledger balance by $100 million\nand increases the balance in each of the individual shareholder\u2019s ledgers at\nChase by $10 million. That\u2019s it.\n\nThe money was inside the box before, and now it is outside the box, but the\nmoney always belonged to the shareholders. Money is simply moved from one\npocket to another. Nothing is being \u201cwasted\u201d; in fact, economically nothing is\nreally happening at all. No real goods or services are being consumed here, as\nopposed to our earlier example when scarce labor and capital was being\ndiverted to produce printing presses and journalism.\n\nThere is some indirect practical future impact from the money no longer being\ntrapped inside the box; presumably the individual shareholders will use the\nmoney differently than the company would have, for better (if the company is\nconstrained in their investment opportunities) or for worse (if the company is\npassing up high-return investment opportunities to make the distribution). But\nin no case can a distribution unequivocally be framed as a \u201cwaste\u201d. For mature\ncompanies, there is usually some positive optimal level of distributions,\nwhich is why shareholders are willing to pay taxes to free their money from\nthe box.\n\nA stock buyback is economically more similar to the choice to move cash from a\nchecking account to a money market fund than it is to the purchase of a new\nprinting press.\n\nClaim: Stock buybacks are a vehicle for executives to extract more\ncompensation by artificially inflating stock prices.\n\nThe rough intuition behind this claim is the notion that stock prices are\ndetermined by supply and demand. The argument goes that stock buybacks\nincrease demand, and therefore stock buybacks must artificially inflate stock\nprices. Furthermore, since executive pay is tied to stock prices, whether\nthrough share and option grants or bonuses, it is argued that executives\nundertake stock buybacks for selfish reasons, to inflate their own pay.\n\nWe have already looked at one problem with this model: increased buybacks have\nhistorically been funded by reducing dividends, and savers are likely to\nreinvest their dividends right back into stocks, just as you do automatically\nin your 401(k). If we account for the reduction in demand from lower\ndividends, it\u2019s not clear that there is any meaningful net increase in demand\nfrom increasing buybacks.\n\nEven if we ignore that, aggregate buybacks are simply not large enough to have\na meaningful impact on stock prices. We can use the S&P 500 to stand in for\nthe entire market of publicly traded companies in America; company value\nfollows a power law and the S&P 500 (which consists of the 500 most valuable\ncompanies in the US, more or less) accounts for 80% of total publicly-traded\nUS market value (and in fact over half of all US corporate profits). In 2023,\nS&P 500 companies bought back 2% of their stock in aggregate. One would not\nexpect that buying only 2% of the stock of a company over the course of an\nentire year would have any meaningful direct impact on the stock price \u2013\ninvestors often build 2% positions in much shorter time periods without any\nnoticeable effect on the price of a stock.\n\nNote that this is true for companies in aggregate, but not necessarily true\nfor any specific company. One can easily imagine a smaller company with a cult\nfollowing aggressively repurchasing enough stock so that all rational\ninvestors sell out, leaving only cult members trading stock amongst themselves\nat a high price. However, most corporate profits, dividends, and buybacks are\nconcentrated in a small number of very profitable companies at the very top \u2013\nApple and Alphabet combined accounted for 18% of all S&P 500 buybacks in 2023,\nand the top 20 companies combined accounted for nearly half \u2013 so activity at\nsmaller companies won\u2019t matter, even in the aggregate.\n\nWe have also noted here in the past that one would expect buybacks to shrink\nexecutive compensation, all things being equal. Executive compensation is\nproportional to the size of the company being managed (last year, Tim Cook\u2019s\ntarget compensation was seven times that of the CEO of the NYT), and buybacks\nshrink the value of the company, as they move value outside the box.\n\nThe way to grow executive compensation would be to forego buybacks and\ndividends and instead retain profits to make internal investments or to buy\nother companies,5 which will cause the company to grow exponentially over\ntime. This indeed was a popular strategy during the conglomerate craze of the\n1960s, but this tended to destroy value (or at least transfer value to the\nshareholders of target companies) so it quickly fell out of favor with\ninvestors. Buybacks usually happen because investors like them; most\nexecutives feign enthusiasm but merely tolerate them so they don\u2019t get fired.\n\nFinally, some make the more nuanced argument that buybacks can be a trick to\ninflate the value of stock option packages specifically; the idea is that\nbuybacks shift returns from dividends to capital appreciation, and stock\noptions only gain value with capital appreciation. The problem with this\nargument is that the effect size would be fairly small, and in any case,\noptions have fallen out of favor over the years, going from 70% of CEO stock\ncomp in 2006 to only 34% in 2022.\n\nClaim: Stock buybacks divert money that would normally go to increase wages,\nas demonstrated by the fact that wages flatlined at the same time stock\nbuybacks were liberalized, in 1982.\n\nThis one is pretty simple. The NYT goes out and sells newspaper subscriptions\nand ad space for money. The workers at the NYT, who (in conjunction with the\nNYT\u2019s external suppliers) produce the newspaper, would like to capture as much\nof that money as possible in the form of wages. The money that is left over\nafter paying suppliers and employees is profit, which goes to the owners. The\nowners would like to capture as much profit as possible, and they will fight\nwith the workers and suppliers over how the pie is split.\n\nBuybacks and dividends and investments have nothing to do with it. Sure, after\nthey clear their profits, the owners need to figure out how to reinvest their\nmoney in the highest return projects possible, and usually this means pulling\ncash out of the company via buybacks and dividends and investing in new\nexternal projects. Sometimes it means leaving profits in the company and\ninvesting in internal projects, but it is the nature of successful investment\nthat it simply turns into more money later, so even internal investment must\neventually lead to bigger buybacks and dividends, because at some point,\ninternal investment opportunities will get tapped out. (Indeed, the handful of\ncompanies that drive a disproportionate share of all buybacks today are always\ngoing to be the companies that successfully reinvested retained earnings in\nthe recent past \u2014 that list today includes Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta.)\n\nComplaining about high profits and high buybacks and/or dividends is totally\nredundant and illiterate. It is like complaining that the CEO gets paid too\nmuch and he deposits his paycheck into his bank account. Profits have to be\nreturned to the owners eventually, and buybacks and dividends (and sometimes\nthe sale of the entire company) are simply the vehicles through which this\nhappens. Higher buybacks have chiefly come at the expense of lower dividends,\nbut in any case, both happen after the company has booked their profits, so it\nis highly unlikely that buybacks lower wages.\n\nIt is natural that the Times Guild should publicly negotiate for higher wages\nat the expense of corporate profits \u2013 after all, collective bargaining is the\npoint of a union. And in a way, it\u2019s quite clever for a newsroom to employ\neconomically illiterate talking points in service of wage negotiations. What\nis management going to say? \u201cDon\u2019t listen to our newsroom, they are\neconomically illiterate, also subscribe to the New York Times for only $1 per\nweek and become better informed about the world!\u201d But we should still call out\neconomic illiteracy when we see it.\n\nIt is also worth noting here that high corporate profits and buybacks can\u2019t be\nthe source of broad-based lower wages anyway, simply because the most\nprofitable companies are not the largest employers. Corporate profits are\nlargely a function of high productivity and sustainable competitive\nadvantages, and so are not remotely evenly distributed among companies.\n\nIn aggregate, the S&P 500 only employs 20% of US workers, despite accounting\nfor over half of all corporate profits. A huge share of American workers are\nat smaller companies that hardly make any profit at all. There is a huge\ndisparity even within the top of S&P 500: Apple made $97 billion last year\ndespite having only 90,000 US employees, while Wal-Mart made only $16 billion\nlast year with a US workforce of 1,600,000! Even if the most profitable\ncompanies decided tomorrow to share more of their profits with their\nemployees, it would do nothing to improve the lot of most workers, simply\nbecause the most profitable companies employ such a tiny share of the total\nAmerican workforce.\n\nAs for the final claim about 1982, the claim that real wages have flatlined\nsince the early 1980s has been repeatedly debunked over time, and we already\nsaw that buybacks didn\u2019t gain much traction until well into the 1990s. In any\ncase, corporate profits are unlikely to have been the source of widespread\nwage pressure, since they have gone up only a couple of percentage points over\nthe last forty years, and even that increase is partially attributable to\nfalling effective corporate tax rates.\n\nClaim: Stock buybacks funded by debt are a harmful form of \u201cfinancial\nengineering\u201d.\n\nIn our original model, we only have one way of funding capital investment, the\nsale of equity. You put your money in a box, the managers of the box use your\nmoney in some business venture, and if that venture is successful, you get a\nfixed percentage of all the money thrown off by that venture from now until\neternity.\n\nIn the real world, we have another popular way of funding capital investment:\nthe sale of debt. This is a slightly different kind of contract. You still put\nyour money in a box, but instead of getting a fixed percentage of all of the\nmoney thrown off by the venture for eternity, you get a fixed dollar amount\nfor a fixed period of time (and you also get your fixed dollar investment back\nat the end).\n\nThis is a minor feature to add to our model. Equity and debt are very similar\nat a fundamental level: you defer consumption today in the hope of more\nconsumption tomorrow. The main difference is in the payoff schedule. The\npayout for the equity investor is subject to much more variance; the debt\ninvestor gets a fixed payout, and the equity investor gets whatever is left\nover. An entrepreneur will usually raise money using a mix of both equity and\ndebt, depending on the availability and price of each instrument in the\nmarket.\n\nYou will often see a pundit work himself into a lather over these kinds of\nbasic capital structure decisions, fulminating about how virtuous old-\nfashioned physical engineering has been displaced by dishonest modern\nfinancial engineering. As evidence, he will point to transactions where a\ncompany swaps debt for equity, such as a leveraged buyout (in which a sponsor\nbuys out existing equity owners in part with money raised from debt investors)\nor a stock repurchase funded in part with newly-issued debt. (Curiously, no\none complains when companies engage in the opposite form of financial\nengineering \u2013 using retained equity earnings to pay down debt.)\n\nThere is nothing inherently good or bad about swapping debt for equity or vice\nversa, despite the moral connotations often applied to debt generally. Debt\nand equity have different advantages and drawbacks, depending on the specific\nsituation. We have been funding companies with different mixes of debt and\nequity for centuries. When you made (or will make) your biggest financial\ninvestment \u2013 your home \u2013 you likely funded (or will fund) that investment with\na huge slug of debt and a sliver of equity. This is all perfectly well and\ngood, because your debt payments align with your likely future income stream.\n\nThe 2010s were a period of very low interest rates. Naturally, some corporate\nexecutives responded to this by issuing cheap debt and using the proceeds to\nretire expensive equity. For example, Apple had $121 billion of cash and zero\ndebt at the end of fiscal 2012; this shifted to $148 billion of cash and $113\nbillion of debt by the end of fiscal 2023. Apple borrowed money and used it to\nbuy back stock.\n\nThis is fine. Managers are supposed to respond to price signals by giving\ninvestors what they want. If investors are willing to pay a dear price for\ndebt (Apple\u2019s average effective pre-tax interest rate on outstanding term debt\nis less than 3%) and demand a high price for equity, Apple executives can make\neveryone happier by issuing cheap debt and using the proceeds to redeem\nexpensive equity. Investors get the debt they crave and dispose of the equity\nthey don\u2019t want.\n\nObserve that this is simply a recapitalization \u2013 investors as a whole still\nown Apple in its entirety, just chopped up in a slightly different contractual\nform. This recapitalization might have been conducted through share\nrepurchases, but it could have been done through dividends instead and ended\nwith the same result.\n\nNothing immoral occurred here, there was no manipulation, and there was\ncertainly no displacement of physical engineering. This was a good trade for\neverybody. Within certain limitations around complexity, taxes, and risk, it\nis desirable that companies respond to changing circumstances and price\nsignals by altering their capital structure, and when they do so, it is\ninevitable that they will use stock buybacks as a tool.\n\nClaim: Stock buybacks are harmful to society because they discourage\ninvestment.\n\nThis is the crux of the debate around stock buybacks. The argument here is\nthat stock buybacks displace productive economic investment. The story goes\nthat if businesses would just reinvest their profits rather than give them\nback to shareholders, society would be much better off.\n\nLet\u2019s think about what would happen if major companies went from retaining 23%\nof their earnings (as they do today) to retaining 100% of their earnings.\n\nWell, first, big business would get much, much bigger. Companies that reinvest\nearnings productively will not only grow, they will grow exponentially.\n\nWe have seen this historically not only with conglomerates like Berkshire\nHathaway, but also capital-intensive juggernauts like Wal-Mart, McDonalds, and\nSouthwest. They started from a few stores (or planes), and each year, they\nreinvested almost all of their earnings into more stores, and after a couple\nof decades, they had thousands of stores. Eventually, they saturated their\nmarkets, stopped building more stores, and started returning gobs of cash to\nshareholders.\n\nLast year, the S&P 500 returned $1.4 trillion to shareholders in dividends and\nrepurchases, or 3.5% of its market value. If those companies instead used that\nmoney to invest internally year after year, in only twenty years, they would\ndouble in size relative to the rest of the economy (relative to the\ncounterfactual), and in twenty more years, they would double again.\n\nHowever, remember that our other economic inputs, such as labor, are fixed.\nFor existing big business as a whole to grow much faster than the broader\neconomy, it would have to aggressively displace smaller businesses. If the S&P\n500 employs 20% of all workers today, imagine what it would mean for that\ngroup to quadruple in size.\n\nIn our thought experiment, new business formation would be throttled as well:\nwhile big incumbents would be newly awash in capital to redeploy, savers would\nbe starved of the cash they would usually use to fund new enterprises.\n\nHistorically, startups have been the engine of American growth and innovation,\nand without them, the corporate landscape would look much different. For\nexample, here is a list of the original Dow Jones Industrial Average\ncomponents from 1896:\n\nThe American Cotton Oil Company\n\nDistilling & Cattle Feeding Co.\n\nNorth American Company\n\nThe American Sugar Refining Company\n\nGeneral Electric Company\n\nTennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company\n\nAmerican Tobacco Company\n\nThe Laclede Gas Company\n\nThe United States Leather Company\n\nChicago Gas Light and Coke Company\n\nNational Lead Company\n\nUnited States Rubber Company\n\nIn this world, anyone with an innovative business idea would be at the mercy\nof gatekeepers at existing big businesses, who now would control all the cash.\nWould we expect a Manager of Corporate Development at The American Cotton Oil\nCompany to spot and oversee the next Google?\n\nWe could go on and on with this reductio, but here we should stop and identify\nsome of the errors in the original premise.\n\nFor one, the statement \u201cbuybacks discourage investment\u201d carries with it an\nimplication that more investment is always better, when in fact the goal is to\nfind the optimal dose of investment for each organization.\n\nInvestment consumes scarce societal resources, so it is nonsensical to talk\nabout the risk of discouraging investment without first defining the optimal\nlevel of investment and then showing that major companies are falling short of\nthat mark, something that no critic ever does.\n\nThis is a general issue with models that appeal to our intuitions. We never\nhave to think of broader economic constraints when we buy a loaf of bread or\nfill a tank of gas \u2014 we just worry about the price and otherwise think of the\nsupply as infinite, which for our purposes it might as well be. But when we\nmodel the economy as a whole, we have to think carefully about all of the\neconomic constraints within the system, such as the size of the labor pool \u2013\ncompanies can\u2019t just increase investment without disrupting other parts of the\nsystem.\n\nFinally, there is a common fallacy at play here, which is the false analogy\nbetween a household budget and a corporate budget. In reality, corporate\nmanagers do not have the full discretion to reinvest earnings as they please.\nInvestors are worried that managers will squander their cash, and so they\nexpect managers to justify their capital allocation decisions, and they\ngenerally expect managers of large, mature companies to return the majority of\nthe cash they generate back to investors.\n\nThis works the other way as well: companies are not limited by their retained\nearnings either. If they can convince investors that they have a lot of good\ninvestment opportunities, they simply raise more money from investors to act\non them. Smaller companies do this routinely, through the sale of equity and\ndebt. Companies are constrained, but in a much different way than households\nare.\n\nLet us propose a simple framework for thinking about earnings reinvestment.\nFrom a company\u2019s point of view, investment opportunities come in three\nbuckets:\n\n  1. Growing or improving the existing business. In our newspaper example, it was more printing presses. These investments usually carry a high incremental return, but are hard to come by, as they are constrained by demand \u2013 the number of printing presses you need is limited by the number of homes you can deliver newspapers to.\n\n  2. Expanding into adjacent businesses, where the assets from your existing business give you some sort of edge over competitors. The NYT has recently gotten into the casual gaming business with some success, rolling it into their existing app. Historically, newspaper companies also reinvested part of their earnings into other media assets, such as magazines, television stations, and cable, which might be considered adjacent if you squint hard enough, but probably didn\u2019t rise to the level of driving any real synergies.\n\n  3. Expanding into unrelated businesses. This is a bad idea unless you are literally Warren Buffett. We already referenced how there was a conglomerate fad in the 1960s that went very badly. Investors have learned through bitter experience that companies that lose focus do badly \u2014 it is not for nothing that Peter Lynch dubbed this process \u201cdiworsification\u201d.6\n\nWithin this framework, it\u2019s easier to see why big companies return most of\ntheir cash to shareholders. The most profitable companies today will tend to\nbe more mature, and thus will have fewer opportunities to grow or expand their\nexisting business, especially relative to the gushers of cash they generate.\n(How profitable are the biggest companies? Apple generated nearly $100 billion\nof profit in fiscal 2023 after spending $30 billion on R&D, while all US\nearly-stage VC investment last year added up to only $40 billion.) Investors\nwish to allocate cash to the companies with the best investment opportunities,\nand so we observe investors moving cash away from large mature companies\ntoward smaller growth companies.\n\nGiven that the theory behind this claim is incoherent, it should be no\nsurprise that the evidence shows no relationship between buybacks and\ninvestment. Corporate capital expenditure and R&D spending are no lower today\nthan they were before buybacks were popular. Also, the largest buyers of their\nown stock are Apple, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft (which combined accounted\nfor a quarter of all S&P 500 buybacks over the last 5 years), which are the\nsame companies that also spend mind-boggling sums investing in AI, self-\ndriving cars, and VR.7\n\nClaim: Nuh-uh, look at this case where a company failed to make an important\ninvestment at the same time it was buying back stock!\n\nHere is a common narrative:\n\n  1. An opinion writer decides to scrutinize a company that has stumbled recently.\n\n  2. They discover that the company would be doing much better if it had not passed on some particular investment.\n\n  3. They also learn that this company was buying back stock at the same time it was passing on this investment.\n\n  4. They triumphantly conclude that the stock buyback caused the company to miss the investment, and was therefore the root cause of the company\u2019s misfortune. They then pen a thinkpiece about how buybacks are ruining Corporate America, with this particular example as Exhibit A.\n\nFor a concrete example, we previously looked at an NYT op-ed that made this\nargument at the time Southwest had an operating meltdown over Christmas:\nSouthwest was buying back stock at the same time it failed to upgrade its\nscheduling software, therefore stock buybacks were a root cause of Southwest\u2019s\nwoes.\n\nThis line of reasoning is completely fallacious, and you see it everywhere.\n\nFirst of all, the writer implies that they have uncovered a correlation\nbetween major companies that repurchase stock and major companies that pass on\ngood investments, when they have done nothing of the sort. This is because\nsubstantially all profitable major companies buy back stock as a matter of\npolicy. 429 members of the S&P 500 (that is, 86%) bought back stock in 2023\nalone. Extend the window more than 12 months, and you will likely find that\nbasically every profitable company has engaged in some sort of stock buyback\nin the recent past. Of course every investigation of a struggling company will\nturn up a stock buyback in the past; every investigation of a successful\ncompany will uncover a past repurchase as well. All major profitable companies\nbuy back stock!\n\nIn addition, we know that 100% of all companies regret passing on some past\ninvestment. (Who among us doesn\u2019t?) If you ran the investigation the opposite\ndirection, examining companies that bought back stock, you would find that\nthey all have many investment decisions they wish they could have back. This\nwould also show nothing. The Venn diagram of Major Companies That Repurchased\nStock and Major Companies That Missed an Important Investment isn\u2019t even a\ncircle, it\u2019s just the rectangular set labeled \u201cMajor Companies\u201d.\n\nThe problem with the entire premise the false analogy between a household\nbudget and a corporate budget (again). People assume that any missed\ninvestment is due to some cash constraint, when that is never going to be the\ncase at a big company that always generates more cash than they know what to\ndo with.\n\nBad investment decisions are just bad investment decisions: they usually\nresult from some other less obvious organizational constraint (such as a\ncultural resistance to change, or limited bandwidth to implement change) or\njust plain old bad judgment. People tend to assume that most difficult\nproblems can be solved by writing a check, but if that were the case, big\ncompanies would be unbeatable, when in reality they come and go.\n\nOf course it is still possible that there is still some causal relationship\nhere; maybe companies that spend more on buybacks make worse investment\ndecisions. If this were the case, however, we would expect to see some\nanecdotes where a company passed up on an investment specifically so it could\nmake a larger buyback. We actually have anecdotes like this when it comes to\ndividends; here is a story about GE during the depths of the financial crisis\nfrom Power Failure, which we reviewed in the last edition:\n\n> On January 24 [2009], [GE CEO Jeff Immelt] announced that GE would keep its\n> dividend at $1.24 for 2009 and would perhaps cut it in 2010, but only if\n> necessary.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> After forty-five minutes of debate at the board meeting, Ralph Larsen, the\n> lead director and former CEO of Johnson & Johnson, announced the dividend\n> would have to be cut. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is,\u201d Larsen told Jeff.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> After Larsen ruled on the dividend, Jeff said he felt like \u201ca cub getting my\n> ears boxed by an elder lion...No matter how dire the extenuating\n> circumstances...I didn\u2019t want to be the CEO who cut GE\u2019s storied dividend\n> for the first time since the Great Depression,\u201d he recalled.\n\nEven though Immelt was eventually overruled, one can see why he wanted to keep\npaying a large dividend, even when his company desperately needed to preserve\ncash. He viewed the dividend as a public commitment, and one does not\nbacktrack on public commitments lightly. And by the same token one can see why\nthe board merely wanted to cut the dividend, instead of eliminating it\nentirely, which would be the common sense action for a company in financial\ndistress. Later that year, GE ended up having to sell NBCU to Comcast at a\ndeep discount in order to shore up the balance sheet, a move they would later\ndeeply regret.\n\nThis story is actually a strong argument in favor of buybacks. Many companies\npride themselves on an unbroken dividend streak stretching back decades, but\nno one strives for an extended repurchase streak. A company can just shut off\nbuybacks for a couple of years with no repercussions, as the NYT did in 2020\nand 2021.\n\nWhen this newsletter last touched on the subject of buybacks, we said:\n\n> [W]e should consider banning buybacks because there is no other topic on\n> earth that causes so many otherwise smart people to contort themselves into\n> logical pretzels and embarrass themselves in public...everything was fine\n> back when everyone was mostly just paying out dividends, so maybe we should\n> think about just going back to that and saving everyone the brain damage.\n\nBuybacks probably don\u2019t matter. There exists another very close substitute,\ndividends, which produces almost the exact same end result with none of the\ntoxic discourse.\n\nBuybacks are only worth examining because they are a perfect example of how\ndumb economic ideas take hold in the minds of intelligent people and refuse to\nlet go. Even though the buyback debate has almost zero real stakes, the same\ncannot be said of housing, trade, price controls, or any of the numerous other\nissues where popular economic myths lead to destructive public policy.\n\nStock buybacks would seem to be a strangely arcane topic for the average\nperson to get worked up about. Who cares about the specific financial pipes\nthat your savings flow through to end up backing a promising project?\n\nWe get angry about stock buybacks because our brains work from a series of\nfalse analogies to assemble a narrative that triggers strong emotions: we\nimagine that stock buybacks pit big corporations against everyday workers,\ndemonstrate executive greed, and accelerate the decline of great\norganizations. The other major financial topic that gets such a reaction is\nhigh-speed trading, another case where normal people get very angry about a\ntopic they do not remotely understand because they mistakenly believe it\nrepresents some great injustice.\n\nAdam Mastroianni has a great recent post that relates to this topic. He\nobserves that a lot of complicated math was figured out by the ancients,\nthousands of years ago, but a lot of simpler facts about nature were a mystery\nuntil very recently: for example no one knew that objects of different masses\nfall at the same speed until someone thought to do an experiment in the 1600s,\nand no one thought to figure out the rules of heredity until Mendel did some\nexperiments in the 1800s.\n\nHe connects this to what psychologists call the illusion of explanatory depth:\nthe idea that people believe they have a deep understanding of a given topic,\nwhen in fact they are only working from a folk theory, an incomplete and\nincorrect intuitive model of a subject. When you are familiar with some\nsubject, and you have some mental model of it that works well enough for your\npurposes, you incorrectly conclude that you have a real understanding of it,\nand explore no further. The illusion is only shattered when you are forced to\nwrite out a coherent explanation of the topic in your own words. (The original\nexperiment asks people to explain everyday objects like toilets and car\nbatteries.) Mastroianni states:\n\n> This, I think, explains the curious course of our scientific discovery. You\n> might think that we discover things in order from most intuitive to least\n> intuitive. No, thanks to the illusion of explanatory depth, it often goes\n> the opposite way: we discover the least obvious things first, because those\n> are things that we realize we don't understand.\n\nHe concludes that the key to progress is to break the illusion of explanatory\ndepth; people didn\u2019t explore heredity and physics for many centuries because\nthey were working from folk theories that mostly worked well enough, but once\nthey realized how little they actually knew, they made quick progress by\nformulating theories and then rigorously verifying them (or discarding them)\nthrough careful experiments.\n\nFolk theories are as prevalent in economics as they are in science. People use\nintuitive models and heuristics that actually manage to work well enough in\nday-to-day life, but backfire badly when applied to create economic policy\nbecause they contain weaknesses that emerge when they are used to model the\nsystem as a whole.\n\nFor example, we talk here sometimes about common examples of counterproductive\nhousing policy, where for example a government might propose subsidies for new\nhomebuyers while placing strict limits on the production of new homes.\nAccording to folk theory, the subsidy will obviously make new homes more\naffordable, but a more careful model will show that housing will in fact not\nbecome more affordable at all: houses will be no more abundant than they were\nbefore, and the extra subsidy will simply cause homebuyers to bid up the price\nof existing homes, fully negating the value of the subsidy to the homebuyer\nand transferring the subsidy to selling homeowners.\n\nIt is easy to see here how folk theory works well in day-to-day life but\nbreaks down when considering the economy as a whole: we navigate the world\nthrough the abstraction of money, and individually we can procure more goods\nand services by obtaining more money and outbidding our neighbor for scarce\nresources, but the economy as a whole is constrained by the total amount goods\nand services produced, and there is no neighbor that can be outbid.\n\nThe illusion of explanatory depth explains how the Times Guild could be so\nconfident and yet so mistaken about stock buybacks: even the brightest minds\nare easily fooled into thinking they have a deep understanding of a topic that\nthey only have a superficial familiarity with. Often, the biggest obstacle to\nlearning is having the awareness to realize that most of one\u2019s beliefs derive\nfrom unsupported folk theories, and the key to knowledge is to have the\ndiscipline to dispose of that folk theory when a more rigorous and evidence-\nbased model comes along to contradict it.8\n\nIt would be wonderful if proven new discoveries were immediately widely\naccepted, but in reality, smart people tend to cling to folk theories long\nafter being presented with conclusive evidence that contradicts them. We are\nusually unaware that we are operating from folk theories, and over time, these\nfolk theories become ingrained in our minds as core truths, and as we use them\nand teach them, they become wrapped up with our egos and identities, and we\nform communities around them. When these folk theories are challenged, we\ninstinctively look for any way to defend them, as a way to protect our own\nstatus and internal narratives.\n\nOne popular story about this process plays out is, of course, Moneyball.9 But\nas it specifically pertains to economics, Paul Krugman wrote a classic essay\nexploring this subject in 1996, back when free trade was a hot topic. In it,\nhe expressed shock that so many intellectuals of the day failed to comprehend\nand publicly opposed the basic concept of comparative advantage, an idea that\nwas originally formulated and fully explained in the 1800s. His thesis was as\nfollows:\n\n> (i) At the shallowest level, some intellectuals reject comparative advantage\n> simply out of a desire to be intellectually fashionable. Free trade, they\n> are aware, has some sort of iconic status among economists; so, in a culture\n> that always prizes the avant-garde, attacking that icon is seen as a way to\n> seem daring and unconventional.\n>\n> (ii) At a deeper level, comparative advantage is a harder concept than it\n> seems, because like any scientific concept it is actually part of a dense\n> web of linked ideas. A trained economist looks at the simple Ricardian model\n> and sees a story that can be told in a few minutes; but in fact to tell that\n> story so quickly one must presume that one's audience understands a number\n> of other stories involving how competitive markets work, what determines\n> wages, how the balance of payments adds up, and so on.\n>\n> (iii) At the deepest level, opposition to comparative advantage -- like\n> opposition to the theory of evolution -- reflects the aversion of many\n> intellectuals to an essentially mathematical way of understanding the world.\n\nThree decades later, we can see very little has changed. Debunked economic\nfolk theories are still sold as avant-garde, and their inherent complexities\nand contradictions are actually highlighted to appeal to insecure midwits. The\nkey to breaking free of folk theories is to have to write out how the theory\nmaps to the evidence, but we exempt folk theories from the normal standards of\nlogic and evidence: for example, unrepresentative anecdotes are recast as\n\u201clived experience\u201d, and mishandled or outright fabricated data is presented as\nunassailable proof.\n\nThere is a full set of widely accepted but incoherent talking points that\ndefenders of economic folk theories revert to when challenged: for example, it\nis often claimed that academic economic models are useless because they cannot\ndescribe the world with precision, but it is never explained why folk economic\nmodels would be any more reliable by that standard?\n\nPublic policy crafted around folk theories is rarely subject to any\naccountability; when those policies predictably backfire, instead of engaging\nin introspection, we simply double down on the same failed policies.\n\nFinally, there is a huge incentive for politicians and members of the media to\npander to the sensibilities of the public and bestow credibility on debunked\nfolk theories, thus the unsupported claim from the Treasury Department that\nstock repurchases harm innovation. This creates a cycle where bad ideas manage\nto retain some legitimacy and never quite go away.\n\nIn such an environment, we should always expect to be walking around with some\nweb of debunked ideas in our brains, especially as we get further and further\naway from our area of expertise. The best solution, to constantly evaluate\nevery theory against the available evidence in a consistent epistemological\nframework, is perhaps unrealistic. Maybe the next best solution comes from the\nlate Charlie Munger: \u201cAny year that passes in which you don\u2019t destroy one of\nyour best-loved ideas is a wasted year.\u201d\n\nThanks for reading MD&A!

In our story, you are investing\ndirectly in a productive asset to make the model more clear, but the economics\nwill still be the same if we layer in abstractions like stock and bank\naccounts.\n\n2\n\nAdolph Ochs, the man who built the New York Times, started his newspaper\ncareer at the age of 14 as a printer\u2019s devil at the Knoxville Chronicle,\nbefore buying the Chattanooga Times with $250 of borrowed money (and $1,500 of\nassumed debt) at 19, which he managed successfully. Twenty years later, the\nNew York Times was in financial distress, and he had acquired enough of a\nreputation that the existing investors recruited him to take over the Times.\n\nHe managed to secure a majority equity interest in the Times through a\ncombination of equity sweeteners earned by personally subscribing for $75,000\nof newly issued bonds, and shares earned as equity compensation that vested\nafter he turned in three consecutive years of profitable operation. His great-\ngreat-grandson is chairman of the Times today.\n\n3\n\nHe actually quotes everything in proportion to share price, so a stock might\nhave a dividend yield of 6% and undistributed earnings of 2.5% each year; he\nfinds that while investors focus on the 6%, the 2.5% is a critical factor in\ndetermining total return. But you can see the payout ratio here is still 70%\n(6% divided by (6% + 2.5%)).\n\n4\n\nGranted, we are hand-waving the Great Depression, M&A booms, etc., but this\nrounds to being true \u2013 mature companies have always returned most of their\ncash to shareholders.\n\n5\n\nAll that happens when one company buys another for cash is that the owners of\nthe selling company get a one-time dividend, funded by the owners of the\nacquiring company, who in return get a box that they can extract cash from in\nthe future.\n\n6\n\nThere is a minor version of this where companies will get into the real estate\nbusiness by developing their own corporate headquarters, and that sometimes\ngoes better: In 1904, the NYT built Times Tower in midtown Manhattan, for\nwhich the city named the adjacent square, and which became a lucrative source\nof ad revenue for future owners. The NYT would later build two other Manhattan\nheadquarters as they grew over the years.\n\n7\n\nS&P classifies the big tech companies as either Information Technology or\nCommunications Services, and those sectors combined accounted for 43% of all\nbuybacks over the last five years. Financial Services accounted for another\n18% of buybacks \u2013 that sector includes big banks like Wells Fargo and JP\nMorgan, which are limited in their ability to retain earnings by regulation,\nand so have to return most of their profits to investors via buybacks and\ndividends.\n\n8\n\nA couple of sayings apply here: \u201cIt is impossible to learn that which one\nthinks one already knows\u201d, \u201cIt ain\u2019t what you don\u2019t know that gets you in\ntrouble.
