In\nfighting that monster, the hero often gets help from their usual social\nallies, such as friends, family, and local authorities. In a more \u201cmodern\u201d\nstory, however, the villain may be a friend, parent, boss, teacher, police, or\ngovernment agency. The hero must now learn to distrust many usual authorities,\nand judge who are their real allies.\n\nSuch stories come from our usual cultural authorities, however, like those who\nmake our movies, TV shows, novels, and songs. And so these can be seen at a\nmeta level as the same simple hero story: our cultural authorities teaching us\nhow to anticipate and deal with the real villains we may encounter in our\nmodern world. So then a meta-modern story is when those cultural authorities\nbecome the villains. In such stories, heroes must learn to distrust many\ncultural authorities and decide which ones are their real allies.\n\nNow there are some movies roughly of this form. But they typically warn\nagainst trusting *conservative cultural authorities. For example, Breaking the\nWaves and Handmaids Tale warn against trusting religious cultural authorities.\nVideodrome, Natural Born Killers, Starship Troopers, and Fight Club warn\nagainst trusting authorities who promote violence. Pleasantville, Network,\nStepford Wives, and They Live warn against trusting traditional culture. While\nmovies like Matrix and Truman Show warn generically against trusting\nappearances, they don\u2019t warn about culture in particular.\n\nHowever, as our cultural elites are now dominated by non-conservatives, such\nmovies are now really just our usual cultural authorities warning against\ntrusting rebels who defy their cultural dominance. They are not really warning\nagainst trusting dominant cultural authorities. Any movies that do this must\nbe pretty far out into the long tail of niche products. But they might be the\nwarnings we really need.\n\n### Subscribe to Overcoming Bias\n\nBy Robin Hanson \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nThis is a blog on why we believe and do what we do, why we pretend otherwise,\nhow we might do better, and what our descendants might do, if they don't all\ndie.\n\n8 Likes\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Who Warns Of Warners?\n\nwww.overcomingbias.com\n\n3\n\nShare\n\n3 Comments\n\ndoopilidoo1 hr agoI think media still warns against itself. Major villains in\nAmerican Gods and Hazbin Hotel are supernatural personification of TV and\nother modern entertainment. In The Boys, the evil Vought has an entertainment\ndivision similiar to Disney+(and ironically also Amazon Prime) that does\nblatant propaganda.Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nCatherine Caldwell-HarrisHigher Cognition21 mins agoI appreciate the logic of\nthis blog post. That logic suggests: Fictional narratives should exist (or may\nneed to be created) that sound the alarm about harms done by the currently\ndominant liberal (or non-conservative) cultural elites.I'm trying to think of\npossible harms to be warned against. It isn't easy to come up with anything.\nSo, trying hard, I've thought of these 3:\"Feminists told me I could be both a\nmother and have a career, but I waited too long and am childless...\" (this\ndisappointment has been documented and parodied)\"Non-white males from\nhistorically marginalized groups are valued for all the important, high status\njobs; as a white male I can't get ahead, therefore, I succumb to depression\nand substance abuse...\" (the documented 'deaths of despair' of middle-aged\nwhite males, reported in PNAS 12 years ago approx.)\"Liberal educators told me\nthat emotional regulation, social skills, learning-how-to-learn and finding\nout what I loved doing should be my educational goals. I did that, but now I\ndon't have the math, writing and science skills to get a job, so I'm 32 and\nstill making working as a waiter.\"It is hard to think of harms or curtailments\nto happiness that are a consequence of liberalism. Anyone have any\nidea?Regarding: \"Any movies that do this must be pretty far out into the long\ntail of niche products.\" --> Do you know of any movies that do this (even if\nthey are very obscure, niche...)?Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 more comment...\n\nA Fertility Reckoning\n\nThose who consume too much alcohol or other recreational drugs often make\nexcuses.
