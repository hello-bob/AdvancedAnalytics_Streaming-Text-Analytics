Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Microsoft has revealed the end of support and availability dates for the\nclassic Teams app\n\nJohn Callaham Neowin @JCalNEO \u00b7 Apr 25, 2024 06:16 EDT with 6 comments\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced that it would give people who were\nstill using the classic Teams desktop app some more time to make the\ntransition to the more recent \"Teams 2.0\" version, until at least July 1,\n2024. This week, the company offered some more concrete info on when support\nfor classic Teams will end and also when it will become completely unavailable\nto use.\n\nIn a support page on Microsoft's site, the company confirmed that it has\nstarted sending notifications to classic Teams users, warning them that the\napp will reach its official end-of-support date of July 1, 2024. After that\ndate, Microsoft will no longer release any updates, patches, or new features\nfor classic Teams users.\n\nWhile the classic Teams app won't get any more updates after July 1, it will\nstill be useable for people and businesses who have yet to make the move to\nthe new Teams desktop app, After July 1, classic Teams users will see another\nwarning notification, informing them that it is no longer supported. Those\nnotification warnings can be dismissed but they will continue to show up\noccasionally for people still using the older app.\n\nHowever, the real day of reckoning is when the classic Teams app will no\nlonger work at all. Microsoft has announced that anyone using classic Teams on\nolder and unsupported operating systems (Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and MacOS Sierra\n10.12) will begin to see warnings in August that the app will no longer work\nafter October 23, 2024. After that date, those users who try to use the app\nwill see another notification saying their use of the app has now been\nblocked. Those users can continue to access Teams on supported web browsers.\n\nFor all other users, the shutdown of the classic Teams app will take a bit\nlonger, but it will happen. The blocking of the use of classic Teams all\nsupported Windows and MacOS operating systems will happen on July 1, 2025.\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Teams\n  * Microsoft teams\n  * Classic teams\n\nLike\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nReport a problem with article\n\nNext Article\n\n### Get the Lenovo Legion Go portable gaming PC for a new low price of $629.99\n\nPrevious Article\n\n### Proton Mail for Business adds some new features including an employee\navailability tool\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### The Microsoft Teams iOS app has added mixed reality-based spatial\nannotations for workers\n\nJohn Callaham \u00b7 Apr 17, 2024 with 1 comment\n\n### Microsoft Teams for Education Search Progress and Coach feature\nimprovements\n\nJohn Callaham \u00b7 Apr 9, 2024 with 0 comment s\n\n### The Microsoft Teams Shifts app gets some improvements for importing\nschedules from Excel\n\nJohn Callaham \u00b7 Apr 3, 2024 with 0 comment s\n\n### Microsoft Teams (free) adds automatic welcome messages for Windows 11 and\nmore\n\nJohn Callaham \u00b7 Apr 2, 2024 with 3 comment s\n\nFrom the WebPowered by ZergNet\n\nWe Might Know Where Human Teeth Came From & We Can't Sleep Now\n\nThis Is The Most Reliable Air-Cooled Engine Ever Created\n\nIf Hitler Had Won WW2, These Were His Plans For The US\n\nThis Is Easily The Best Motor Oil Brand On The Road Today\n\n### Subscribe to our Newsletter\n\n### Community Activity\n\nRefresh\n\n  * Tesla Cybertruck in The Neobahn\n  * What should I do with this free PC? in Hardware Hangout\n  * Discord Applying Forced Arbitration - opt-out before it is too late! in Back Page News\n  * What was the last movie you watched?
