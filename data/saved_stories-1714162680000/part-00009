The peculiar\nthing is that I never write several drafts about the same idea.\n\nThroughout the week, I come up with ideas I want to share with you, dear\nreader. Ideas are sometimes inspired by something happening in my life as a\ndad or at work. But not always. Sometimes, ideas appear out of nowhere, and I\ncan't see how they connect to anything else. It must be something they put in\nthe water because this kind of idea often comes to me while I shower.\n\nUnless I'm in a complex task (or in the middle of showering), I write the\nessay when inspiration strikes.\n\nI don't spend any time brainstorming or writing an outline. I take the idea\nand run with it.\n\nI often realize halfway through that an idea is too complex to be written in\none go. Or that I need more original ideas about this topic to make an\ninteresting essay.\n\nI don't force it. I stop typing and abandon the draft. I don't abandon it \"for\nnow.\" I abandon it forever.\n\nWhat? How could that be? You thought this idea had legs, you worked on it for\na while...\n\nthen decide to let it go FOREVER?\n\nIt sounds dramatic.\n\nWhat I mean when I say I abandon it forever is that I will never continue\nworking on this specific essay. I won't read it ever again, either.\n\nIf the idea returns to my mind, if it harasses me for long enough, I will\nbring it back to my text editor. But the first thing I'll do is create a new\nfile. It will be a new project, a new take, a new idea really. Not an\niteration of the first draft.\n\nWhen writers I admire open up about their writing process, they talk about\nrevisiting and revising their drafts over and over again. They edit the crap\nout of their original brain dump until they get to a masterpiece.\n\nI don't. Rewriting every sentence ad nauseam would ruin the fun. The best I\ncan do is correct things here and there before I hit the publish button.\n\nHaving this blog allows me to justify the time I spend writing drafts that\nwill never become essays.\n\nWriting an idea down is like watering freshly planted seeds. After watering\nthem with a watering can for a while, one relies on nature, rain, and time to\ndo their magic.\n\nAnd who knows? Some of these ideas might bear unexpected, good fruits.\n\nIf they don't, the time spent wrestling with an idea and practicing the craft\nof writing was super valuable anyway.\n\nGreg Gilbert's notes \u00a9 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
