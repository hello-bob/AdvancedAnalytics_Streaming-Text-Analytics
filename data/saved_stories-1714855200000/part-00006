To receive it in your inbox every Thursday, and read\narticles like this first, sign up here.\n\nLast week, Moderna and Merck launched a large clinical trial in the UK of a\npromising new cancer therapy: a personalized vaccine that targets a specific\nset of mutations found in each individual\u2019s tumor. This study is enrolling\npatients with melanoma. But the companies have also launched a phase III trial\nfor lung cancer. And earlier this month BioNTech and Genentech announced that\na personalized vaccine they developed in collaboration shows promise in\npancreatic cancer, which has a notoriously poor survival rate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrug developers have been working for decades on vaccines to help the body\u2019s\nimmune system fight cancer, without much success. But promising results in the\npast year suggest that the strategy may be reaching a turning point. Will\nthese therapies finally live up to their promise?\n\nThis week in The Checkup, let\u2019s talk cancer vaccines. (And, you guessed it,\nmRNA.)\n\nLong before companies leveraged mRNA to fight covid, they were developing mRNA\nvaccines to combat cancer. BioNTech delivered its first mRNA vaccines to\npeople with treatment-resistant melanoma nearly a decade ago. But when the\npandemic hit, development of mRNA vaccines jumped into warp drive. Now dozens\nof trials are underway to test whether these shots can transform cancer the\nway they did covid.\n\nRecent news has some experts cautiously optimistic. In December, Merck and\nModerna announced results from an earlier trial that included 150 people with\nmelanoma who had undergone surgery to have their cancer removed. Doctors\nadministered nine doses of the vaccine over about six months, as well as\nwhat\u2019s known as an immune checkpoint inhibitor. After three years of follow-\nup, the combination had cut the risk of recurrence or death by almost half\ncompared with the checkpoint inhibitor alone.\n\n## Related Story\n\nWhat\u2019s next for mRNA vaccines\n\nmRNA vaccines helped us through the covid-19 pandemic\u2014but they could also help\ndefend against many other infectious diseases, offer universal protection\nagainst flu, and even treat cancer.\n\nThe new results reported by BioNTech and Genentech, from a small trial of 16\npatients with pancreatic cancer, are equally exciting. After surgery to remove\nthe cancer, the participants received immunotherapy, followed by the cancer\nvaccine and a standard chemotherapy regimen. Half of them responded to the\nvaccine, and three years after treatment, six of those people still had not\nhad a recurrence of their cancer. The other two had relapsed. Of the eight\nparticipants who did not respond to the vaccine, seven had relapsed. Some of\nthese patients might not have responded because they lacked a spleen, which\nplays an important role in the immune system. The organ was removed as part of\ntheir cancer treatment.\n\nThe hope is that the strategy will work in many different kinds of cancer. In\naddition to pancreatic cancer, BioNTech\u2019s personalized vaccine is being tested\nin colorectal cancer, melanoma, and metastatic cancers.\n\nThe purpose of a cancer vaccine is to train the immune system to better\nrecognize malignant cells, so it can destroy them. The immune system has the\ncapacity to clear cancer cells if it can find them. But tumors are slippery.\nThey can hide in plain sight and employ all sorts of tricks to evade our\nimmune defenses. And cancer cells often look like the body\u2019s own cells\nbecause, well, they are the body\u2019s own cells.\n\nThere are differences between cancer cells and healthy cells, however. Cancer\ncells acquire mutations that help them grow and survive, and some of those\nmutations give rise to proteins that stud the surface of the cell\u2014so-called\nneoantigens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonalized cancer vaccines like the ones Moderna and BioNTech are developing\nare tailored to each patient\u2019s particular cancer. The researchers collect a\npiece of the patient\u2019s tumor and a sample of healthy cells. They sequence\nthese two samples and compare them in order to identify mutations that are\nspecific to the tumor. Those mutations are then fed into an AI algorithm that\nselects those most likely to elicit an immune response. Together these\nneoantigens form a kind of police sketch of the tumor, a rough picture that\nhelps the immune system recognize cancerous cells.\n\n\u201cA lot of immunotherapies stimulate the immune response in a nonspecific\nway\u2014that is, not directly against the cancer,\u201d said Patrick Ott, director of\nthe Center for Personal Cancer Vaccines at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,\nin a 2022 interview. \u201cPersonalized cancer vaccines can direct the immune\nresponse to exactly where it needs to be.\u201d\n\nHow many neoantigens do you need to create that sketch? \u201cWe don\u2019t really know\nwhat the magical number is,\u201d says Michelle Brown, vice president of\nindividualized neoantigen therapy at Moderna. Moderna\u2019s vaccine has 34. \u201cIt\ncomes down to what we could fit on the mRNA strand, and it gives us multiple\nshots to ensure that the immune system is stimulated in the right way,\u201d she\nsays. BioNTech is using 20.\n\nThe neoantigens are put on an mRNA strand and injected into the patient. From\nthere, they are taken up by cells and translated into proteins, and those\nproteins are expressed on the cell\u2019s surface, raising an immune response\n\nmRNA isn\u2019t the only way to teach the immune system to recognize neoantigens.\nResearchers are also delivering neoantigens as DNA, as peptides, or via immune\ncells or viral vectors. And many companies are working on \u201coff the shelf\u201d\ncancer vaccines that aren\u2019t personalized, which would save time and expense.\nOut of about 400 ongoing clinical trials assessing cancer vaccines last fall,\nroughly 50 included personalized vaccines.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee any of these strategies will pan out. Even if they do,\nsuccess in one type of cancer doesn\u2019t automatically mean success against all.\nPlenty of cancer therapies have shown enormous promise initially, only to fail\nwhen they\u2019re moved into large clinical trials.\n\nBut the burst of renewed interest and activity around cancer vaccines is\nencouraging. And personalized vaccines might have a shot at succeeding where\nothers have failed. The strategy makes sense for \u201ca lot of different tumor\ntypes and a lot of different settings,\u201d Brown says. \u201cWith this technology, we\nreally have a lot of aspirations.\u201d\n\n# Now read the rest of The Checkup\n\n### Read more from MIT Technology Review\u2019s archive\n\nmRNA vaccines transformed the pandemic. But they can do so much more. In this\nfeature from 2023, Jessica Hamzelou covered the myriad other uses of these\nshots, including fighting cancer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article from 2020 covers some of the background on BioNTech\u2019s efforts to\ndevelop personalized cancer vaccines.

(NYT)\n\nStudies in which volunteers are deliberately infected with covid\u2014so-called\nchallenge trials\u2014have been floated as a way to test drugs and vaccines, and\neven to learn more about the virus. But it turns out it\u2019s tougher to infect\npeople than you might think. (Nature)\n\nWhen should women get their first mammogram to screen for breast cancer? It\u2019s\na matter of hot debate. In 2009, an expert panel raised the age from 40 to 50.\nThis week they lowered it to 40 again in response to rising cancer rates among\nyounger women. Women with an average risk of breast cancer should get screened\nevery two years, the panel says. (NYT)\n\nWastewater surveillance helped us track covid. Why not H5N1? A team of\nresearchers from New York argues it might be our best tool for monitoring the\nspread of this virus.
