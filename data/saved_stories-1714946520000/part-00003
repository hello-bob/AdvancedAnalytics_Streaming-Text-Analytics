Photograph: Sunset\nBoulevard/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe ObserverStanley Kubrick\n\n# \u2018He erased the entire project\u2019 ... the book Stanley Kubrick didn\u2019t want\nanyone to read to be published\n\nHalf a century since the perfectionist director vowed to block it, a critique\nthat dared to discuss flaws in his films is to be published\n\nDalya Alberge\n\nShare\n\nStanley Kubrick, the relentless perfectionist who directed some of cinema\u2019s\ngreatest classics, was so sensitive to criticism that, in 1970, he threatened\nlegal action to block publication of a book which dared to discuss flaws in\nhis films.\n\nThe director of Spartacus and 2001: A Space Odyssey, warned the book\u2019s author\nand publisher that he would fight \u201ctooth and nail\u201d and \u201cuse every legal means\nat his disposal\u201d to prevent its publication \u2013 and he did.\n\nNow, 25 years after his death, the book Kubrick did not want anyone to read is\nbeing published, more than half a century late.\n\nDr Strangelove at 60: is this still the greatest big-screen satire?\n\nRead more\n\nThe Magic Eye: The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick by Neil Hornick now has three\nprefaces reflecting its subject\u2019s ruthlessness in trying to block publication\nand control his image.\n\nHornick, now 84, from London, said Kubrick\u2019s legal threats had come as a\nshock: \u201cI regard it as a painful episode.\u201d\n\nHe had been commissioned to write the very first book on Kubrick by cinema\nspecialist The Tantivy Press more than 50 years ago. Kubrick was initially\nhelpful, sharing viewing prints of his films that were otherwise inaccessible.\n\nBut, after seeing a draft of the book, the film-maker changed his mind and\nblocked its publication. He complained that the book had \u201ca summary of the\ngood things about [each] movie followed by a summary of the bad points, which,\nin [Kubrick\u2019s] view, always outweigh the good on account of the overly\nemphatic way in which such criticisms are presented.\u201d\n\nTantivy had signed an agreement with Kubrick stating that it would not publish\nanything \u201cuntil such time as its entire contents have been approved in writing\nby me [Kubrick]\u201d.\n\nKubrick and the Lolita star Sue Lyon during shooting in 1962. Photograph:\nPictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy\n\nHornick said: \u201cI understood his legal agreement with the publisher entitled\nhim to ensure the book was factually correct. I didn\u2019t expect the whole book\nto be rejected.\u201d\n\nKubrick\u2019s lawyers were clear: \u201cIf ... any attempt were to be made by yourself\nor any other publisher to publish the existing manuscript without his approval\nour Client will have no alternative but to accept our advice to take all steps\nas are open to him to prevent such publication and to seek redress for damages\nsuffered.\u201d\n\nKubrick estimated that the \u201cunacceptable\u201d criticisms amounted to a third of\nthe 70,000-word manuscript. But he never specified what had caused such\noffence and Hornick was bewildered as he believed the criticisms were not that\nextensive.\n\nThey appeared primarily in a chapter on Lolita, a 1962 adaptation of Vladimir\nNabokov\u2019s controversial novel about a man who becomes obsessed by a 12-year-\nold girl.\n\nIn the book, Hornick wrote: \u201cThere are good things in Lolita. But in too many\nrespects it squanders, impoverishes and conventionalises its source material,\ndraining it of its complexity, nymphetry and eroticism.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cI found the film version largely a pointless betrayal of the\noriginal novel from which it was adapted. However, I expressed great\nadmiration for most of his other films.\u201d His book describes 2001 as \u201ca\nmagisterial achievement\u201d and Kubrick\u2019s 1957 first world war movie Paths of\nGlory as \u201ca film of intoxicating visual sophistication\u201d.\n\nKubrick never responded to his offer to revise substantial sections, \u201cso long\nas the critical integrity of the book was not jeopardised\u201d, Hornick had\nwritten to him. Instead, the film-maker collaborated closely with his friend,\nthe film critic Alexander Walker, on a book titled Stanley Kubrick Directs,\npublished in 1972. \u201cWho could blame me for not wanting to prolong the agony,\ngiving up on the whole sorry imbroglio, and getting on with my own creative\nlife?\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if he was bitter that Kubrick\u2019s lawyers blocked publication of his book,\nHornick said: \u201cPerhaps at the time, yes, and highly frustrated too, but not\nfor long, as I was very busy with other projects.\u201d\n\nNeil Hornick said despite publication of his book being blocked he remained\n\u2018bitten by the Kubrick bug\u2019. Photograph: Jonathan Cronin\n\nFilippo Ulivieri, a leading Kubrick scholar, said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite shocking to\nread the correspondence between Kubrick\u2019s lawyers and Neil\u2019s publisher ...\nKubrick wanted a book that praised his films and Neil\u2019s book was not like\nthat. His films up to that point were reviewed positively \u2013 although some\ncritics, especially in New York, had been critical. So he needed a book that\nwas completely positive.\n\n\u201cWith its down to earth, craft-oriented analysis of the films, would\n[Hornick\u2019s] book have chipped away at the myth of the all-powerful, never-\nfailing director?\u201d\n\nUlivieri added that Hornick\u2019s book \u201coffers a very precise, unbiased view of\nKubrick\u2019s films\u201d, unlike so many others. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to find even a\nsingle flaw pointed out in the Kubrick literature.\u201d\n\nStanley Kubrick: film\u2019s obsessive genius rendered more human\n\nRead more\n\nThe Magic Eye could have remained unread. However Hornick was approached by\nNew York-based Sticking Place Books.\n\nPaul Cronin, its British publisher, said: \u201cHis reaction to The Magic Eye\nshowed Kubrick\u2019s image-control obsessions taken to extremes. He didn\u2019t just\nmake edits \u2013 he erased the entire project. Now, almost 55 years after Neil\nHornick completed it, readers can finally make their own judgments about the\nbook Kubrick was so implacably determined to keep from public view.\u201d\n\nHornick writes in his preface: \u201cGiven the sad fate of my book, I thought I\u2019d\nfinished with Kubrick. But, as I\u2019m sure others before and after me have also\ndiscovered, one is never really finished with him. If you\u2019ve once been bitten\n\u2013 or is the word \u201csmitten\u201d? \u2013 by the Kubrick bug, it kind of gets into your\nbloodstream and stays with you for life ... I remain interested in him to this\nday.\u201d\n\nThe Magic Eye: The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick by Neil Hornick is published on\n30 April by Sticking Place Books\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Stanley Kubrick\n  * The Observer\n  * Film books\n  * Film industry\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
