For over 40 years, the Camry has been a staple among those\nwho just want An Car and the 2025 Toyota Camry isn\u2019t trying to change that.\nIt\u2019s not a sports car, a luxury car, nor a mom or dad car\u2014that honor is\nreserved for minivans and crossovers. The prefix that best applies to the\nCamry is \u201cnormal\u201d if you prefer to be nice, or \u201cboring\u201d if you want to be,\nwell, less nice.\n\nBut the Camry is also one of the best-selling cars in its segment, and it was\none of the last sedans to outsell SUVs and pickups before truck fever struck\nin the U.S. When someone just wants a normal car for normal things, like\ncommuting to work or shuttling a family around, the Camry is a good go-to.\nThat\u2019s still true today, and now that the 2025 Camry is hybrid-only and\ndelivers a more refined driving experience, maybe it\u2019s time to drop the\n\u201cboring\u201d prefix altogether. The new Camry is simply a good car, maybe even a\nfun one.\n\nToyota\n\nThe outgoing Camry was split into different lineups depending on drivetrain.\nThere was the 2024 Toyota Camry and the 2024 Toyota Camry Hybrid. That gas-\nonly model came with either a 301-horsepower V6 or a 2.5-liter four-cylinder\nwhile the Hybrid took the latter and added an electric motor.\n\nStarting at $34,495, this new 2025 Camry drops the Hybrid suffix because,\nwell, they\u2019re all hybrids. Now, the only available drivetrain is a 2.5-liter\nfour-cylinder engine paired to an electric motor that makes a total of 225 hp\non front-wheel-drive models. Output increases to 232 hp for all-wheel-drive\ncars courtesy of an electric motor in the rear axle, which provides on-demand\npower when more traction is required. AWD is available on all trims for an\nextra $1,525, even the base model.\n\nToyota\n\nAnd, yes, speed racers, the V6 is gone and so is the TRD trim. But, again, the\nCamry is not a sports car and was never meant to be one. What the ninth-gen\nToyota Camry is, though, is redesigned. Underneath the new sheet metal,\nhowever, the latest Camry rides on the same TNGA-K platform as its\npredecessor. You can see traces of the old model in this new one, but the\nfront end has changed quite a bit, sporting the \u201chammerhead\u201d fascia of the new\nPrius and Crown Signia.\n\nThis shared design language has grafted well onto the \u201cboring\u201d Camry, and it\nnow looks slightly more athletic while still resembling the previous\ngeneration. It\u2019s a good balance of old and new that sticks to the overall vibe\nof the car, which is conservative yet forward-thinking. A good old-fashioned\nsedan with a pioneering streak.\n\nToyota\n\nThe interior follows this design ethos, looking vaguely similar to the\nprevious model while taking a big leap forward. There\u2019s still a kind of\nstepped center console that favors the driver, and the dashboard is now\nsegmented in a more dramatic way. The transition looks really cool, though,\nwith matching trim on the door cards and dash that gives the cabin a sense of\nflow. Upper and lower Camry grades are differentiated by the materials\nadorning the dash, so an XSE might have leather-like material while another\ngrade will feature a cloth-like covering. Both look and feel great.\n\nFront and center is a big infotainment screen that measures 8 inches\ndiagonally as standard, but there\u2019s an upgraded 12.3-inch screen available.\nAll Camry grades get wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as two\nUSB-C ports and at least one USB-A for front passengers. The inductive\ncharging pad looked too smooth to be useful, so I opted not to use it. Last\nthing I want is an iPhone flying off the console. I\u2019m a hardwired hold-out, so\nI always plug straight in, but I get why people love wireless... everything.\n\nToyota\n\nOne of the most welcome changes is the addition of a teal paint finish, which\nToyota calls Ocean Gem. Even the Camry\u2019s chief engineer, Mark DeJongh,\nremarked that the Camry team was surprised when they saw the paint on a\nfinished car. The lively teal pops off the sheet metal in ways that the paint\nswatch couldn\u2019t capture.\n\nToyota\n\nIndeed, the new color looks friendly and bright in a late-\u201990s, early-\u201900s\nkind of way. As a millennial, I\u2019m fully onboard\u2014especially when Ocean Gem is\ncoupled with the Camry\u2019s standard 16-inch and available 18-inch wheels. Upper\ntrims get optional 19-inch wheels but sidewall is king for both looks and\nperformance, if you ask me.\n\nI mentioned before that a Camry TRD will not be available at launch. I\u2019ll let\nyou make up your own mind about that, but I never understood the appeal of a\n\u201csports\u201d Camry. The Camry always struck me as an honest and self-possessed\ncar. There was no pretense, no feigned personality.\n\nToyota\n\nThat honesty is abundant in the new hybrid model, which handles exceptionally\nwell in its natural habitat of both the city and highway. I drove the Camry\naround Coronado, California, which connects to San Diego via a long causeway.\nHeading east along State Route 94, the Camry showed off what it can do on a\ntwisty mountain road in both FWD and AWD spec. I was surprised to learn that\nthe new Camry is pretty fun to drive.\n\nIt will never sound the same as the dearly departed V6, but the hybrid has\npep! Acceleration is boosted by electric motors while the electronically-\ncontrolled CVT handles simulated gear shifts seamlessly, making power feel\nlinear and smooth. Toyota says the new model with electronic motor-fed AWD\nmakes 30 hp over the previous car that featured mechanical all-wheel drive.\nThat seems like a misdirect to gloss over the big power drop from the missing\nV6, but, in practice, the new car is plenty responsive.\n\nToyota\n\nMy major gripe is that the steering feels too heavily weighted. It\u2019s not like\nthe Camry is hard to steer, but the wheel seems more resistant than necessary\nin a family car like this. It ends up stiffening the feel, which is fine at\nspeed but less welcome when maneuvering around parking lots at, say, the\ngrocery store, or while getting in and out of the suburbs.\n\nThen again, the combination of slightly heavier steering with the Camry\u2019s\nreworked suspension and new drivetrain add up to great highway performance.\nThe drive is planted and the Camry offers a smooth ride, but it\u2019s not so\ncompliant that it feels lifeless. This is a sedan that communicates well\nthrough sound and steering feel and is overall just firm enough.\n\nToyota\n\nThere are MacPherson struts up front and a multi-link rear featuring new\n\u201csport-tuned\u201d shock absorbers. The suspension is tuned a little stiffer than\nyou\u2019d expect in a family car, but it\u2019s not trying to be raw or visceral. In\nother words, it\u2019s more of a sporty sedan than sports sedan. And that\u2019s great\nbecause this is a Camry, after all. It\u2019s a car that has always known what it\ndoes and is perfectly happy just doing it well.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m a fan of the move to a hybrid drivetrain across all trims. It\nsimplifies the lineup and splits the difference between fuel efficiency and\nperformance. A base model Camry LE will get a whopping 53 mpg on the highway\nand 50 in the city. Modern cars should\u2019ve always been circling this many mpg,\nand it\u2019s great to see a stalwart sedan like Camry lead the pack in terms of\nfuel economy.\n\nToyota\n\nGiven the impressive balance this midsize sedan strikes between enjoyable\ndriving and efficiency, the \u201cboring\u201d old Camry has caught up to competitors\nlike the Honda Accord, Kia K5, and Hyundai Sonata, all of which tout strong\nhybrid offerings. The downside is that the new Camry\u2019s price starts a couple\nof thousand dollars higher than it did when a simple combustion engine was in\nthe base model. The trade-off, however, is clearly compelling.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry Specs  \n---  \nBase Price| $29,495  \nPowertrain| 2.5-liter four-cylinder hybrid | electronic continuously variable automatic | front- or all-wheel drive  \nHorsepower| 225 (FWD) | 232 (AWD)  \nTorque| 163 lb-ft @ 5,200 rpm (not including torque from the electric motor)  \nSeating Capacity| 5  \nCurb Weight| 3,450-3,682 pounds  \nCargo Volume| 15.1 cubic feet  \nEPA Fuel Economy| 53 mpg city | 50 highway | 51 combined  \nQuick Take| The 2025 Camry makes no pretense of being a sports car but the\nstandard hybrid drivetrain makes it fun to drive while getting outstanding\nfuel economy.  \nScore| 8/10  \n  \nToyota\n\nGot a tip?
