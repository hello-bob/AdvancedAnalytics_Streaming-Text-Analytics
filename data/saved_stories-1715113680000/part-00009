It works for the Nordic\ncountries\n\nLucy Vincent\n\nInmates cook together, eat together \u2013 and sometimes even forage together. It\nputs Britain\u2019s rat-infested facilities to shame\n\nShare\n\nI spent three weeks visiting prisons across Scandinavia to find out how they\nfeed their prisoners. You may ask why any of us should be concerned with what\npeople in prison eat. But research suggests that good nutrition not only\nimproves wellbeing, security and safety in prisons, it may have an effect on\nrehabilitation and keep people from returning to prison.\n\nSo does a region with one of the lowest reoffending rates in the world \u2013 only\nabout 30% of Nordic prisoners end up back inside within two years \u2013 and a\nhumane approach to incarceration treat prison food differently from countries\nwith higher recidivism and a more punitive culture? As the founder of a\ncharity dedicated to improving prison food in the UK, I wanted to find out.\n\nIn Denmark, I spent two days in Storstr\u00f8m prison, a high-security male\nestablishment. Here, 65% of the prisoners cook all of their meals themselves,\nin kitchens they share with about six others. They plan meals and budget\ntogether, and twice a week they shop for ingredients in the prison\u2019s in-house\ngrocery store. They dine together, often with the on-duty prison officers. The\nless confident cooks in the housing unit quickly learn vital kitchen skills\nfrom their peers. One prisoner told me he had been able to \u201clive healthily and\neat clean\u201d here. \u201cI eat well, cook for myself, work out and spend time\noutside. I can keep in touch with my family and I\u2019m able to bake my kids cakes\nfor when they visit. I feel as though I\u2019m in the best possible position I\ncould be to come back out.\u201d\n\nIn Storstr\u00f8m\u2019s prison kitchen, the catering manager leads a team of staff and\nprisoners who produce meals for everyone in the establishment. He enrols every\nprison kitchen worker in a four-year culinary diploma. At the end of it, they\nwill be trained to the same level of qualification as he is. I watched as they\nprepared homemade Greek meatballs with couscous and feta with care and\nattention to detail. The kitchen\u2019s in-house nutritionist is required, by\nDanish law, to measure the nutritional breakdown of each dish and display it\nto prisoners.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the UK, where a rat-infested prison kitchen and a food\npoisoning incident that left six people seriously ill in hospital recently hit\nthe headlines.\n\nAt Sulkava prison in Finland, I stood on the edge of a lake where, in the\nsummer, prisoners fished for their dinner and foraged in the woodland for\nmushrooms and lingonberries. \u201cBeing here and able to cook for myself brings me\na sense of normality, dignity and self-sufficiency,\u201d one prisoner told me. At\nSuomenlinna prison off the coast of Helsinki, I stood in the dining hall\nwatching men line up at the salad bar and help themselves to fresh rye bread.\n\nIn contrast, prisoners in the UK routinely eat unhealthy, processed, tasteless\nfood, sometimes alone in their cell, often next to their toilet.\n\nA smaller prison population and more public money puts Nordic prisons at an\nobvious advantage. In England and Wales, the daily budget for prison food is\njust \u00a32.70 per prisoner.\n\nBut some of what I observed in Scandinavia I have seen in British prison\nkitchens too. A prison in Brixton, London, makes every plate of food from\nscratch. Homemade spice rubs, marinades and curry sauces enhance the poor\nquality meat and pack it with flavour. Prisoners make their own pastry,\nturning it into quiches and pies. Inspiring leadership and a commitment to\nmaking every plate of food as healthy, delicious and appetising as it can be\nwithin the limitations of prison catering set it apart from the rest.\n\nThe charity I founded teaches prisoners in England and Wales to cook and grow\nfood, and trains catering teams to produce healthy meals. But prisons like HMP\nBrixton are still the exception.\n\nEvery day, our prisoners are eating poor quality food that is degrading their\nhealth and wellbeing at exactly the time they need it to improve. They are\nleaving prison in poorer health than when they entered, making recovery and\nrehabilitation difficult, and for many impossible. Some have simply forgotten\nhow to do the things we take for granted: how to eat around a table, after\nmonths of eating alone, or how to cook, after surviving on pre-made, pre-\nselected prison meals, and sometimes noodles boiled in a travel kettle. For a\nfew, such as Mohammed Azizi, the consequences of a prolonged prison diet are\nmuch more extreme.\n\nIn April, an inquest into his death while serving time at HMP Norwich heard\nhow he had \u201crepeatedly claimed that prison food was making his Crohn\u2019s disease\nsymptoms worse\u201d. Along with Crohn\u2019s disease and self-neglect, malnutrition was\nrecorded as a cause of death.\n\n\u2018If only my tastebuds could paint\u2019: how prison food art reveals life inside\n\nRead more\n\nPrison catering teams need to be inspired, upskilled and empowered to make\ngood quality food. Prison grounds need to be utilised more to grow food. New\nprisons need to be designed featuring self-catering facilities, and existing\nestablishments should be given the resources to introduce them. At Manchester\nprison, we\u2019re about to start a cooking course in new kitchenette facilities.\nThis shows that even in the country\u2019s oldest Victorian prisons, a different\napproach is possible.\n\nBetter quality food in prison has the potential to reduce violence, improve\nmental health and reduce reoffending. A study by Think Through Nutrition at a\nyoung offenders institution in Aylesbury found that nutritional supplements\nreduced disciplinary incidents by 37%.\n\nWith the prison population in England and Wales projected to reach 114,800 by\n2028, the UK urgently needs to rethink how and why we lock people up. Better\nquality food needs to be part of that solution.\n\nIn Scandinavia, I saw a prison system that successfully prioritises the\nwellbeing of prisoners through opportunities to cook, eat and learn about\nnutritious food. It is rooted in the principles of respect, rehabilitation and\nequality. Perhaps respect is a good place to start.\n\n  * Lucy Vincent is the founder and chief executive of Food Behind Bars\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Prisons and probation\n  * Opinion\n  * Europe\n  * Nutrition\n  * Malnutrition\n  * Food\n  * Health policy\n  * UK criminal justice\n  * comment\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
