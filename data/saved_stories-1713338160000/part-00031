Here\u2019s how they get made.\n\nIt\u2019s partly AI, partly a get-rich-quick scheme, and entirely bad for confused\nconsumers.\n\nBy Constance Grady@constancegrady Apr 16, 2024, 6:00am EDT\n\n## Share this story\n\n  * Share this on Facebook\n  * Share this on Twitter\n  * Share this on Reddit\n  * Share All sharing options\n\n### Share All sharing options for: Amazon is filled with garbage ebooks.\nHere\u2019s how they get made.\n\n  * Reddit\n  * Pocket\n  * Flipboard\n  * Email\n\nConstance Grady is a senior correspondent on the Culture team for Vox, where\nsince 2016 she has covered books, publishing, gender, celebrity analysis, and\ntheater.\n\nIf you\u2019re a millennial, you may remember that specific moment in time around\nthe late 2000s when streaming video technology had just gotten good but there\nweren\u2019t that many legitimate streaming platforms available yet. So if you were\na student without a TV and you wanted to watch a show, you would go to a\nwebsite that aggregated lists of illegal streams.\n\nIt would be covered in banner ads and autoplaying video ads decorated with\nlittle play button arrows, and in order to watch your show, you would have to\nsolve the puzzle of figuring out which play button to click that would\nactually get you to your show instead of spiriting you away to a website that\nsold upsetting porn or amateurish video games. It could be done, but you had\nto be paying attention, and you had to have the barest modicum of web savvy to\ndo it right.\n\nRight now, navigating the ebook and audiobook marketplaces is like being back\non those sites. There are a thousand banner ads larded with keywords, and\nthey\u2019re all trying to get your clicks.\n\nTake, for example, when tech journalist Kara Swisher\u2019s Burn Book came out this\nFebruary. A host of other books hit the Kindle store along with it. They all\nhad bizarre, SEO-streamlined titles, like those new businesses that are named\nPlumbing Near Me to game the Google algorithm.\n\n\u201cI found \u2018Kara Swisher: Silicon Valley\u2019s Bulldog,\u2019 and \u2018Kara Swisher Book: How\nShe Became Silicon Valley\u2019s Most Influential Journalist,\u2019 and \u2018Kara Swisher\nBiography: Unraveling the Life and Legacy,\u2019 by a \u2018guy\u2019 who \u2018wrote\u2019 four\nbiographies this month,\u201d said Ben Smith when he interviewed Swisher for\nSemaforum.\n\nSwisher was less than flattered by the biographies. \u201cI wrote [Amazon CEO] Andy\nJassy and I said, \u2018You\u2019re stealing my IP! What is going on?\u2019\u201d she told Smith.\n(Disclosure: Swisher works for Vox Media.)\n\nHere is almost certainly what was going on: \u201cKara Swisher book\u201d started\ntrending on the Kindle storefront as buzz built up for Swisher\u2019s book. Keyword\nscrapers that exist for the sole purpose of finding such search terms\ndelivered the phrase \u201cKara Swisher book\u201d to the so-called biographer, who used\na combination of AI and crimes-against-humanity-level cheap ghostwriters to\ngenerate a series of books they could plausibly title and sell using her name.\n\nThe biographer in question was just one in a vast, hidden ecosystem centered\non the production and distribution of very cheap, low-quality ebooks about\nincreasingly esoteric subjects. Many of them gleefully share misinformation or\nrepackage basic facts from WikiHow behind a title that\u2019s been search-engine-\noptimized to hell and back again. Some of them even steal the names of well-\nestablished existing authors and masquerade as new releases from those\nwriters. According to the Authors Guild, it would be impossible for anyone but\nAmazon to quantify these books \u2014 and that\u2019s not information Amazon is sharing.\n\nAll of this means that to buy the book you want \u2014 to buy Kara Swisher\u2019s Burn\nBook instead of Kara Swisher Book: How She Became Silicon Valley\u2019s Most\nInfluential Journalist \u2014 you have to know what you\u2019re looking for and pay a\nmodicum of attention to your purchase.\n\nWho wants to do that? Especially in a marketplace like Amazon, where we are\ntrained to buy quickly and thoughtlessly with a single click and where writers\nhave been trained to send their wares without even thinking about it because\nwhere else are you going to sell an ebook.\n\nIt\u2019s so difficult for most authors to make a living from their writing that we\nsometimes lose track of how much money there is to be made from books, if only\nwe could save costs on the laborious, time-consuming process of writing them.\n\nThe internet, though, has always been a safe harbor for those with plans to\ninnovate that pesky writing part out of the actual book publishing. On the\ninternet, it\u2019s possible to copy text from one platform and paste it into\nanother seamlessly, to share text files, to build vast databases of stolen\nbooks. If you wanted to design a place specifically to pirate and sleazily\nmonetize books, it would be hard to do better than the internet as it has long\nexisted.\n\nNow, generative AI has made it possible to create cover images, outlines, and\neven text at the click of a button.\n\nIf, as they used to say, everyone has a book in them, AI has created a world\nwhere tech utopianists dream openly about excising the human part of writing a\nbook \u2014 any amount of artistry or craft or even just sheer effort \u2014 and\nreplacing it with machine-generated streams of text; as though putting in the\nlabor of writing is a sucker\u2019s game; as though caring whether or not what\nyou\u2019re reading is nonsense is only for elitists. The future is now, and it is\nfilled with trash books that no one bothered to really write and that\ncertainly no one wants to read.\n\nThe saddest part about it, though, is that the garbage books don\u2019t actually\nmake that much money either. It\u2019s even possible to lose money generating your\nlow-quality ebook to sell on Kindle for $0.99. The way people make money these\ndays is by teaching students the process of making a garbage ebook. It\u2019s grift\nand garbage all the way down \u2014 and the people who ultimately lose out are the\nreaders and writers who love books.\n\nNone of this is happening through any willful malice, per se, on the part of\nthe platforms that now run publishing and book-selling. It\u2019s happening more\nbecause the platforms are set up to incentivize everything to cost as little\nas possible, even if it\u2019s garbage.\n\nIn a statement, Amazon spokesperson Ashley Vanicek said, \u201cWe aim to provide\nthe best possible shopping, reading, and publishing experience, and we are\nconstantly evaluating developments that impact that experience, which includes\nthe rapid evolution and expansion of generative AI tools.\u201d\n\nYet the garbage books predate the problem of AI. Here\u2019s how they get made in\nthe first place.\n\n### The scammy underbelly of online self-publishing\n\nThese days, the trash ebook publishing landscape is fully saturated with\ngrifters. There are blogs that talk about the industry, but they tend to be\nclickbait sites riddled with SEO keywords and affiliate links back and forth\nbetween each other. Virtually every single part of the self-publishing grift\nworld that can be automated or monetized has been automated and monetized.\n\nIf you look a few years back, however, you find a very different landscape. In\nthe internet of the early 2010s, lots of people were excited about making\nmoney with trash ebooks and trash audiobooks, but they weren\u2019t yet all trying\nto scam one another on top of their eventual readers. They wrote real blogs\nabout the process of the grift with their real human voices. They\ndistinguished between schemes that were \u201cwhite hat\u201d (following the rules) and\n\u201cblack hat\u201d (violating some terms of service). They compared strategies and\nteachers of strategies.\n\nAccording to the blogs of the era, one of the most infamous teachers was a man\nwho went by Luca de Stefani, or Big Luca. Legend had it he held the world\nrecord for making the most money using Kindle Publishing in a single day. What\nset Big Luca\u2019s Self Publishing Revolution course apart from the rest \u2014 Big\nLuca\u2019s \u201cblack hat breadwinner video lesson,\u201d per one review \u2014 was that he gave\nhis students access to a secret Facebook group where self-publishers organized\nreview swaps and buys.\n\nFor the self-publishing grift, good reviews are crucial. The more five-star\nreviews a book has, the more likely Amazon\u2019s algorithm is to push it toward\nreaders. If you\u2019re mostly publishing trash books, you\u2019re not going to get tons\nof five-star reviews organically. Big Luca\u2019s Facebook group gave grifters a\nplace to offer to swap five-star reviews or sell five-star reviews for $0.99 a\npop. As far as Amazon\u2019s algorithm was concerned, there was no difference\nbetween that kind of review and the one a real reader might leave. The results\nwere extremely lucrative.\n\nLuca didn\u2019t invent this formula. He learned it from the OG self-publishing\ngrift course K Money Mastery, now apparently defunct, where he excelled.\n\nEventually, Big Luca had wrung all the money he could from the self-publishing\nhustle. He climbed up to the next level of the pyramid and became a teacher,\nand in 2016, the lore goes, a man named Christian Mikkelsen enrolled in Big\nLuca\u2019s Self Publishing Revolution.\n\nThe Mikkelsen twins are named Christian and Rasmus, and they are 28 years old.\nThey have dark blond hair and blue eyes and meticulously groomed facial hair,\nand they always seem to be posting to Instagram from luxurious private pools\nthat are also somehow exotic beaches. They have managed, in what must be\nfairly acknowledged as a feat of branding wizardry, to hold on to the domain\nPublishing.com, and there they peddle their wares: a course they say can help\nstudents make a lifetime of easy cash off the revenue from books they don\u2019t\neven have to bother to write themselves. If they happen to land a student who\nwants to write a book in good faith and just doesn\u2019t understand how to sell\ntheir book on their own, well, they\u2019re happy to take money from that student,\ntoo.\n\nAccording to a profile in Inc., Christian found his way into the self-\npublishing world by googling \u201chow to make money online.\u201d His first book was a\nbrief ebook titled How to Be a 4.0 Student in College, Like Me. Big Luca\u2019s\nmethod apparently served him well enough that he thought it would be\nworthwhile to bring his twin Rasmus into the fold.\n\nTogether, the Mikkelsens published trash book after trash book, guides to keto\nand sex and crystals. Then they started running their manuscripts through\nGoogle Translate to start selling foreign language editions, an innovation on\nthe old grift that bumped their income into six figures and, after a few\nmonths, got Amazon to block their publishing account. The time had come, as\nInc. would put it, to \u201cdo what entrepreneurs do\u201d: pivot. They started a\nYouTube channel so they could teach the business of self-publishing to anyone\nelse who wanted to learn. Six months and 1,000 subscribers later, they\nlaunched their first paywalled online course.\n\nFirst it was called Audiobook Impact Academy. Then it was Publishing Life.\nNow, with AI an ever-more-fashionable buzzword, it\u2019s AI Publishing Academy.\nIt\u2019s always more or less the same method, with a few new tweaks in every new\niteration. But the method doesn\u2019t change as much as you might think.\n\n### How the garbage books get made: A case study\n\nIf you want to take the Mikkelsen course, the first thing you do is sit\nthrough their sales pitch. It runs for two hours, and it\u2019s just a video of\nChristian sitting in a dark room, drinking thirstily from a water bottle as he\nshows you screencaps of his students\u2019 royalty checks and repeats that he is\nalready rich; he doesn\u2019t have to show you how to make this kind of money. He\u2019s\ndoing it for fun.\n\nChristian\u2019s offer is, he says, unbeatable. He will show you how to produce a\nbook without having to write it. \u201cWhat used to be the hardest part in the\nprocess \u2014 which was creating that book that you upload onto Amazon \u2014 is now\nthe easiest part, and the most fun,\u201d Christian explains. \u201cBecause AI can help\ndo that for you.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, AI will write your outline for you. The twins feel that the\nquality isn\u2019t there on purely AI-generated books yet; they demand better for\ntheir readers than AI prose. Still, they say using AI to outline saves their\nstudents weeks of researching their own manuscripts.\n\nThat AI is part of but not central to the process is a helpful talking point\nfor the Mikkelsens as Amazon strengthens its regulations against purely AI-\ngenerated text for sale.\n\n\u201cLast year we began requiring all publishers using our Kindle Direct\nPublishing service to provide information about whether their content is AI-\ngenerated and further reduced the total number of titles that can be published\nin a day,\u201d said Amazon spokesperson Vanicek. Vanicek added that they have \u201ca\nrobust set of methods\u201d to detect content that violates their guidelines, and\nthey regularly remove those books and sometimes suspend the publishing\naccounts of repeat offenders.\n\n\u201cThe thought of human creativity being overshadowed by robots isn\u2019t exactly\nthe prettiest picture,\u201d Christian wrote in a (suspiciously ChatGPT-sounding)\nblog post in March. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to set the record straight. There are two\ncamps of AI use out there: AI-generated and AI-assisted. They are completely\ndifferent.\u201d\n\nIn April, however, the Mikkelsens announced that they were preparing to launch\na new proprietary AI program, Publishing.ai, that they promise will write a\nmanuscript for you, \u201cSoooo much faster than a ghostwriter!\u201d\n\nUnder the Mikkelsen model, you also don\u2019t have to pick your own topic. They\ngive you access to keyword scrapers that have pulled trending topics off\nKindle and Audible. And once AI is finished with your outline, you can send it\nover to a ghostwriter to turn into a book for a mere $500. For a 30,000-word\nbook, that works out to a fee of $0.016667 per word. (The Mikkelsens work with\na ghostwriting company developed by two former students. There, ghostwriters\nget hired on a freelance basis and are kept anonymous.)\n\nOnce you have your manuscript, Christian promises, the twins will show you how\nto hire audiobook narrators for a flat $20 fee by haggling their prices down.\nThey\u2019ll introduce you to a network of people who are generous with their five-\nstar ratings and will push your book up the algorithmic Amazon rankings for\nyou. All you have to do is sit back and collect your royalty checks as you\nrake in month after month of passive income.\n\nAs Christian talks, he seems to cast a kind of hypnotic spell. You start to\nwonder: \u201cAm I stupid for not having invested in ebook publishing before now?\u201d\nYou see five-figure check after five-figure check. A ticking clock turns on.\nChristian wants to give you a special rate for the course. The course is worth\n$15,500. The regular price is $6,000. But he\u2019s willing to give it to you for\njust $1,995 as long as you\u2019re one of the first people to sign up after the\nwebinar ends!\n\nNone of what the Mikkelsens are describing here is illegal, but if you know\nthe norms of publishing, you know it\u2019s unethical. As documentarian Dan Olson\nlays out in a lengthy 2022 deep dive into the Mikkelsens, their method of\npublishing means developing a book you\u2019re probably not qualified to write. It\nused to mean paying a ghostwriter starvation-level wages to churn out a\nmanuscript; now it means creating a book likely riddled with misinformation\nand minimal means of correcting it. It means deceiving readers with fake\nreviews. (That one can get you kicked off Amazon if you get caught.)\n\nIf you aren\u2019t versed in publishing\u2019s industry standards, however, the\nMikkelsen model can seem incredibly attractive.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Yup, this would be great.\u2019 I was totally vibing with it,\u201d\nrecalls Jennifer (whose name has been changed to protect her privacy), a\n37-year-old in Virginia, who signed up for the twins\u2019 course in September. She\nhad recently written and self-published her own book on Amazon, but she wasn\u2019t\nsure what to do to start promoting it.\n\nThe twins\u2019 sales pitch struck her as the perfect solution: She could provide\nher ideas, people who were good with words could rewrite her draft and polish\nthe whole thing up into a sales-ready package, and everyone would get paid. \u201cI\nwas like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m ready to invest and make this a better thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very efficient, friendly, interactive webinar,\u201d recalls Cecilia\n(also not her real name), a Seattle-based 50-year-old who works in the health\nspace. She signed up for the twins\u2019 seminar in September, and she remembers\nbeing pleasantly won over by that two-hour sales pitch. It seemed to be so\ntransparent. \u201cIt promoted trustworthiness,\u201d she says.\n\nOnce Jennifer and Cecilia had turned over their money for the course, both of\nthem changed their minds fast.\n\n\u201cI started listening to the modules,\u201d Jennifer says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how\nelse to describe them\u201d \u2014 there is a long, expressive pause \u2014 \u201cbut as a jet\nstream of bullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll it does is tell you to buy different products,\u201d Jennifer recalls of the\nMikkelsen course. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s nothing that they actually provide\nthemselves, other than \u2018Go buy other people\u2019s products\u2019 \u2014 and I\u2019m sure they\nown those too, right?\u201d (We can\u2019t confirm that the Mikkelsens do own the\nproducts they recommend, but the ghostwriting company they work with is run by\nformer Mikkelsen students.)\n\nThe course cost $2,000, but that wasn\u2019t enough. To get a Mikkelsen-approved\ntopic for your book, you had to pay for access to the software that analyzed\nAmazon keywords to tell you what was trending. To create the perfect outline,\nyou had to pay for access to the AI that outlined and drafted your book for\nyou. You had to pay for the cover design and for the reviewers. The $2,000 fee\nwas supposed to guarantee you frequent one-on-one calls with a publishing\ncoach, but the coaching calls were mostly about upselling to the premium\n$7,800 course, Jennifer says.\n\nAfter a few weeks of phone calls, Cecilia decided she had had enough of the\nprogram and asked for her money back. She didn\u2019t expect it would be a problem,\nsince the course was advertised as fully refundable. Customer service reps\nthen told her that, to qualify for a refund, she had to prove she\u2019d sat\nthrough the whole course, published a book, and failed to make her money back.\nShe says she had to threaten to call the attorney general before they sent her\nmoney back without such proof.\n\nJennifer wrote off her $2,000 as the cost of learning a bad lesson, but she\nwanted to warn other people against making the same mistake. She posted a\nnegative review of Publishing.com on the user review site TrustPilot, where it\nhas a 4.7 rating. So did Cecilia. Both of them found their reviews queried by\nTrustPilot, which required them to submit proof of going through the course in\norder to keep their reviews up. Most of the course\u2019s five-star reviews,\nhowever, remain unverified. I reached out to some of the five-star TrustPilot\nreviewers to get their take on the Mikkelsens\u2019 course, but I never heard back\nfrom any of them.\n\nAfter the Mikkelsens\u2019 course got big, the rumors on Reddit say Big Luca was\nfurious that they\u2019d ripped off his business model. He used to brag that he was\ngoing to drag them into court. Instead, he got out of the self-publishing\ngame.\n\nNow he runs a program called Big Luca International or, more informally,\nSchool for the Rich, self-described as \u201cthe world\u2019s leading company in online\nmarketing training.\u201d It\u2019s supposed to teach you how to monetize any online\nbusiness \u2014 the self-publishing black hat breadwinning tricks, extrapolated out\nto all the other industries of the internet. With the advent of AI, it\u2019s\neasier than ever to flood the whole digital ecosystem with trash in pursuit of\npassive income.\n\n### The neverending grift\n\n\u201cIt sucks that I did this,\u201d Jennifer says of her experience at AI Publishing\nAcademy. \u201cBut I mean, it\u2019s put some fire under my butt to do it [marketing]\nmyself for my own books.\u201d\n\nJennifer didn\u2019t set out to make a quick buck with a garbage ebook. She did the\nwork of writing a book because she believed in it. The Mikkelsens got her\nbecause she couldn\u2019t figure out how to sell her book on her own, and part of\nthe reason she couldn\u2019t sell it is because the marketplace is already so\nflooded with books. Many of which are garbage books.\n\nThe Mikkelsens are not the chief villains of this story. They are small-time\noperators working one level of a very big grift industry. The grift is that\ntechnology and retail platforms have incentivized a race to the bottom when it\ncomes to selling books. Together, without ever caring enough about the issue\nto deliberately try to do so, they have built a landscape in which it\u2019s hard\nto trust what you read and hard to sell what you write.\n\nThe incentives of the modern book-selling economy for writers are to keep your\ncosts low, low, low and your volume high, high, high, and definitely put your\nbook on Amazon because where else are you going to sell an ebook? The\nincentive of the modern book-buying economy for readers is to go onto Amazon\nand lazily click around with a few search terms, and then buy the first book\nthat looks right with the click of a single button. The incentives are, in\nother words, driving us all straight into a flood of garbage.\n\nThat\u2019s what the grift does. It finds every spot in the process of making and\nselling a book that is inconvenient or laborious, and it exploits those spots.\nIt exploits our cultural belief that books are meaningful, that writing a book\nis a valuable act, that reading a book will enrich your life. When it\u2019s\nfinished, you\u2019re left with something that\u2019s not a real book but a book-shaped\ndigital file filled with nothing of any use to anyone at all.\n\n### You've read 1 article in the last 30 days.\n\nWill you support Vox today?\n\nWe believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.\nThat kind of knowledge helps create better citizens, neighbors, friends,\nparents, and stewards of this planet.
