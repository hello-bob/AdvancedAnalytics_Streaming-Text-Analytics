Google avoided a fine at that point by\npledging to enter into good-faith negotiations over compensation with news\nproviders for their content, among other steps.\n\nSpecifically, according to the authority, Google agreed to provide news\nagencies and publishers with a \u201ctransparent assessment\u201d of their remuneration\nfor usage rights, and to make certain that the negotiations didn\u2019t impinge on\n\u201cother economic relations\u201d between Google and the publishers.\n\nHowever, Google has failed to maintain those commitments in several ways, the\nauthority said. First, it has not been sufficiently forthcoming in its\ninformation sharing with its representatives, failing to provide information\nnecessary for the monitoring of the agreement in a timely way. Second, the\ncompany has failed to provide full details about how it makes money from news\ncontent, which also violates its 2022 commitments.\n\nFinally, the authority accused Google of using news content to train its Bard\nAI service (now called Gemini), without the permission of the publishers, and\nwithout providing access to an opt-out tool that would have let them contest\nthe AI usage.\n\n\u201cThe Autorit\u00e9 considers the fact that Google did not inform editors and press\nagencies of the use of their content by its service Bard to be a breach of its\nobligation of transparency,\u201d the authority\u2019s statement said.\n\nGoogle didn\u2019t get around to providing a tool for publishers to opt out of\nhaving their material used to train Bard until September 2023, when it\nlaunched Google Extended. Until then, the authority said, publishers\u2019 only\noption was to block all Google services from crawling their sites, including\nthose indexing it for its search, Discover, and News services.\n\nIn response to the authority\u2019s ruling, Google issued an official blog post\nsaying it found the fine \u201cdisproportionate,\u201d but that it would pay up rather\nthan contest it, saying \u201cit is time to turn the page.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier ruling in this same case, in July 2021 the authority fined\nGoogle \u20ac500 million for practices likely to cause harm to the press sector.\n\n## Related content\n\n  * brandpost Sponsored by Broadcom\n\n#### Opening more opportunities for VMware Cloud Service Providers\n\nBy Ahmar Mohammad, Broadcom VP, Partners, Managed Services, and Solutions GTM\n\nMay 07, 2024 4 mins\n\nCloud Computing\n\n  * news\n\n#### Red Hat seeks to shrink IT skills gap with Lightspeed gen AI\n\nBuilding on the success of Ansible Lightspeed, Red Hat will extend generative\nAI capabilities across its platforms, including Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux.\n\nBy Thor Olavsrud\n\nMay 07, 2024 5 mins\n\nRed Hat Generative AI IT Skills\n\n  * feature\n\n#### CDOs\u2019 biggest problem?
