It really is appalling. I don\u2019t know what he was thinking.\n> I think it\u2019s totally his fault and I don\u2019t think Ridley Scott helps him. I\n> would have played it a lot better than Joaquin Phoenix, I tell you that. You\n> can say it\u2019s good drama. No \u2014 it\u2019s lies.\u201d\n\nA reviewer in Le Figaro said the movie should have been named, \"Barbie and Ken\nUnder the Empire.\" Ouch. But it is a movie about his relationship with\nJosephine to the exclusion of almost everything else, except some exciting\nbattles.\n\nThere are lots of articles pointing out the historical inaccuracies in the\nmovie (like this), and I know Ridley Scott (the director) doesn\u2019t care about\nthose at all. But let\u2019s take a few anyway.\n\n  * Napoleon was not present at Marie Antoinette\u2019s guillotining.\n\n  * He did not shoot off the tops of the Pyramids.\n\n  * The Battle of Austerlitz was not fought primarily on a frozen lake.\n\n  * He did not slap Josephine at the annulment ceremony.\n\n  * Wellington and Napoleon never met,\n\n###\n\nHistorical Movies\n\nScott\u2019s defense of Napoleon is \u201cit\u2019s a movie, not a documentary.\u201d If you\u2019ve\never read a book and then seen the movie, you know that they can\u2019t get in\neverything, and \u201ccinematic license\u201d excuses a lot of sins.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s compare Napoleon to another eponymously titled movie: Lincoln.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Americans generally worship Abraham Lincoln, as much or\nmore than French people love Napoleon. Lincoln also stars an actor of a\ndifferent nationality than the subject (Daniel Day-Lewis is English / Irish),\nso it\u2019s not that Joaquin Phoenix isn\u2019t French.\n\nSuppose Lincoln gave only passing mention to the Civil War and the fight\nagainst slavery, and concentrated on Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln\u2019s rocky\nrelationship? They did lose a son, after all, so why not make a movie out of\nthat? That\u2019s what Napoleon does with Josephine.\n\nOr: suppose a French director made a movie about Lincoln, starring a French\nactor, and the movie showed him fighting in the Mexican War and publicly\nopposing slavery right from his boyhood? After all, he did free the slaves\neventually. \u201cIt\u2019s a movie, not a documentary\u201d they could say, \u201cand no one\ncares about all those details.\u201d U.S. audiences would be unamused. We can\u2019t\nexpect the French to be amused at Napoleon.\n\nThe fault is in the script, and I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the producer who\u2019s\nat fault or Mr. Scott, but no actor could have salvaged this mess of a movie.\nNot even Brian Cox (who\u2019s too old for the part anyway).\n\nLife Since the Baby Boom is a reader-supported publication.

There are, of course,\nmany inaccuracies in it, e.g. \u201cHouston, we have a problem\u201d was never said in\nreality. But as this article says,\n\n> While it may be easy for filmmakers to play with facts, Ron Howard committed\n> to portraying events in Apollo 13 as true to life as he could, which many\n> experts agree that he did. NASA planetary scientist Rick Elphic \"posits that\n> Apollo 13 might be one of the most accurate, especially when it came to the\n> science of space travel\" (via Time).\n>\n> Not only did Apollo 13 get the science right, but the film accurately\n> portrayed the events of the real space disaster by adhering to the timeline\n> as recorded in Jim Lovell's book. Beyond that, the filmmakers and set\n> designers went to great effort to recreate the space capsule and command\n> center's actual environment. Lovell told The New York Times, \"It's really\n> amazing. Everything. The instrument panels, the console switches. That's\n> exactly what it looks like inside.\"\n\nRon Howard made an effort. Ridley Scott and his scriptwriter did not.\n\n##### Master and Commander\n\nJust in time for me to mention it, this article came out comparing Napoleon to\na far superior movie about the same era, Peter Weir\u2019s Master and Commander.\n\nJust like Lincoln didn\u2019t try to explore his whole life but rather,\nconcentrated on the 13th Amendment, a focused movie about one incident in\nNapoleon\u2019s life would have been a much more successful effort:\n\n> Master and Commander proves that, instead of trying to tell Napoleon's story\n> in a single movie, the best way to reveal deep truths about his character\n> and make him a believable protagonist is to concentrate on a specific\n> period. Scott's film could have emulated Weir's movie and followed\n> Napoleon's journey during the French Revolution, or delved into the siege of\n> Toulon, or his legendary Russian campaign. Ironically, in trying to cover\n> everything, the film failed to explain almost anything about his motives and\n> nature. As Master and Commander proved, the Napoleonic era demands\n> specificity instead of generality.\n\n###\n\nHis Rise to Power\n\nThe recapture of Toulon from the British is, well... reasonable for a movie.\nOf course it was more complicated than the movie makes it out to be, and the\ndirecting is, indeed, Ridley Scott-esque in its action sequences. But hey,\nit\u2019s a movie. So I don\u2019t object to that. The \u201cwhiff of grapeshot\u201d that\ndispersed the Royalist mob: that\u2019s in there and it\u2019s well done.\n\n###\n\nJosephine\n\nThe movie is all about his romance with her. If it were titled \u201cNapoleon and\nJosephine,\u201d that might be fine, but it\u2019s not. So we have a right to see\nsomething about what he did besides have sex with her.\n\nTheir marriage was in 1796. The movie goes from that directly to the Pyramids.\nHis Egyptian expedition, though, was in 1798, two years later, and it was\naimed directly at England, for whom Egypt was critical. Yet although that\u2019s\nmentioned, it\u2019s only in his letter to Josephine.\n\nNelson and the Royal Navy destroyed the French fleet at the Battle of the\nNile, but all the military misadventures in the Middle East don\u2019t matter at\nall in this movie; only that Napoleon suspects she\u2019s being unfaithful to him\n(as she was). When he comes back to Paris, all he cares about is her. She\nmakes him say, \u201cI am just a brute that is nothing without you.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re crowned Emperor and Empress. At dinner he publicly says that she\u2019s had\nother lovers, and yet she\u2019s still not pregnant. They have a food fight in\nfront of the guests. Then he comes to her bed.\n\n###\n\nA Whirlwind Tour of His Career, Sort Of\n\nNow we\u2019re at Austerlitz. He still writes to Josephine and tells her he misses\nher warmth. The French win the battle, of course, and the disputed drownings\nof men on the frozen lake is shown in full Ridley Scott glory. But again: hey,\nthis is a movie so we\u2019ll excuse that.\n\nBut immediately, he\u2019s back with Josephine again. Her handlers set up an A-B\ntest to determine whose fault it is that she can\u2019t get pregnant: he has sex\nwith another woman, to see if she gets pregnant. She does, therefore it\u2019s\nJosephine\u2019s fault, therefore he must dump her. This takes up multiple minutes\nof screen time, including the marriage \u201cannulment\u201d and her exile. The\nannulment was in 1810. Was there nothing happening between 1805 and then?\n\nAnyway, he visits her in her exile, we have a brief t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between\nNapoleon and the Russian Czar on their mutual hatred of England, and then it\u2019s\nback to his romantic life. He marries Marie-Louise, and then, nine months\nlater, she bears him a son. Then it\u2019s back to Josephine\u2019s place of exile to\nshow her the new baby. Why he would do this, I have no idea.\n\nThen he writes to her again, explaining that now he has to invade Russia. The\nBattle of Borodino takes up about 60 seconds of screen time. He advances to\nMoscow, finds it deserted, and is puzzled when it gets burned to the ground.\nThe army retreats to Poland, and again we have the letters between him and\nJosephine. \u201cFortune has deserted me,\u201d he says, as the troops starve, fall\nsick, and get attacked by Cossacks. Their suffering doesn\u2019t prevent him from\ndeserting them and returning to Paris.\n\nWe skip straight from there to his exile to Elba, which actually happened in\nApril 1814. Two more critical years missing.\n\n> War and Peace, in almost any of its movie versions, tells the story from the\n> Russian side, much, much better. General Kutusov\u2019s brilliant strategy to let\n> the vastness of Russia defeat Napoleon is not mentioned at all.\n\nHe returns from Elba, naturally to see Josephine, who dies of diptheria before\nhe can reach her. The English and Prussians join to defeat him again at\nWaterloo (and this battle scene is sensational).\n\n###\n\nWhat\u2019s Missing?\n\nMaybe you see the movie and wonder, \u201cHey, did Napoleon do anything besides win\nbattles and screw Josephine?\u201d\n\nWell, yes. Like:\n\n  * Changing the art of war. His brilliant use of artillery and maneuver changed military thinking forever. However...\n\n  * Losing the Battles of Trafalgar and Leipzig, which were kinda strategic. Losing the Peninsular War in Spain, which, ironically, Wellington played a key part in (in the movie, he magically appears at Waterloo).\n\n  * His legal code, still in use in many parts of the world.\n\n  * The metric system, which he helped spread.\n\n  * The Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States.\n\n  * The Louvre, which had been a palace and he made into one of the world\u2019s premier art galleries.\n\n  * The End of the Holy Roman Empire\n\n####\n\nNapoleon as a Person\n\nMy friend Margaret Rodenberg who wrote Finding Napoleon, said;\n\n> What I most disliked about the movie is that it portrays Napoleon as an\n> unthinking automaton in war and a silly jerk in love. He is a fascinating\n> character who was Shakespearean in his flaws and his genius.\n>\n> The movie ignores the depth of his character and his accomplishments which\n> were beyond the battlefield. It\u2019s a shame because no one will make another\n> Napoleon movie for a long time. A missed opportunity to show the depth and\n> breadth of a monumental leader\u2014however you judge him in the final balance.\n\nThis is maybe the closest to what Brian Cox was getting at, and while Joaquin\nPhoenix was certainly guilty of portraying him \u201cas an unthinking automaton in\nwar and a silly jerk in love,\u201d I\u2019ve tried to show that the script and the\nediting combined to force it on him. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve seen him in Joker\nand he\u2019s not the kind of actor, like Alan Arkin or Philip Seymour Hoffman, who\ncan play anything because they disappear into their characters.\n\n###\n\nSummary\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have Apple TV, you\u2019ll probably be able to see Napoleon for\nfree soon. I\u2019d say, \u201cSkip it. Wrong script, wrong director, wrong actor. Good\nbattle scenes, though.\u201d\n\n### Subscribe to Life Since the Baby Boom\n\nBy Albert Cory \u00b7 Launched 2 years ago\n\nAmusing stuff from a Boomer Fl\u00e2neur in high tech\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why the \"Napoleon\" Movie Was So Bad\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nNo Source Code == No Patent\n\nHow we know you \"have' the invention\n\nApr 17, 2023 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### No Source Code == No Patent\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n10\n\nBring Back Private Offices\n\nOpen Office Sucks\n\nMar 4 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n19\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Bring Back Private Offices\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n14\n\nWorking at Google: Maps\n\n\"Oh, I Love Google Maps!\"\n\nFeb 13, 2023 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n5\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Working at Google: Maps\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n3\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Albert Cory\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
