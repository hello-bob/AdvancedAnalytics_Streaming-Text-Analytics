For three extended periods on October 21,\n2016, internet users were left without their doses of Twitter, CNN and Netflix\namong other popular sites.\n\nNaturally there was speculation about the powerful threat actors who could\nhave caused such a disruption. But the incident was not conducted by a hostile\nstate. It turned out to be extremely unsophisticated, just a distributed-\ndenial-of-service attack targeting Dyn, a company which provided Domain Name\nSystem (DNS) services \u2014 a critical part of the internet\u2019s communications\nstructure.\n\nWhile the attack was unsophisticated, it was large. The volume of traffic sent\nto Dyn\u2019s servers was generated by a botnet of internet-connected consumer\ndevices from wireless cameras through to WiFi routers. The botnet, named Mirai\nafter a Japanese cartoon, had been developed by a trio of U.S. citizens barely\nout of their teens, all of whom were soon arrested.\n\nWhile they pleaded guilty just over a year later, their invention raised the\nspecter of something much more long-lasting \u2014 the specter of just how much\nharm could be caused by sloppy security practices among Internet of Things\n(IoT) producers, particularly the widespread use of default usernames and\npasswords that allowed the Mirai botnet to automatically infect them and\nspread itself to around 300,000 devices, all of which could be ordered to\ntarget anything else connected to the internet.\n\nOn Monday, the United Kingdom became the first country in the world to ban\ndefault guessable usernames and passwords from these IoT devices. Unique\npasswords installed by default are still permitted.\n\nThe Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022 (PSTI)\nintroduces new minimum-security standards for manufacturers, and demands that\nthese companies are open with consumers about how long their products will\nreceive security updates for.\n\nManufacturing and design practices mean many IoT products introduce additional\nrisks to the home and business networks they\u2019re connected to. In one often-\ncited case described by cybersecurity company Darktrace, hackers were\nallegedly able to steal data from a casino\u2019s otherwise well-protected computer\nnetwork after breaking in through an internet-connected temperature sensor in\na fish tank.\n\nUnder the PSTI, weak or easily guessable default passwords such as \u201cadmin\u201d or\n\u201c12345\u201d are explicitly banned, and manufacturers are also required to publish\ncontact details so users can report bugs.\n\nProducts that fail to comply with the rules could face being recalled, and the\ncompanies responsible could face a maximum fine of \u00a310 million ($12.53\nmillion) or 4% of their global revenue, whichever is higher.\n\nThe law will be regulated by the Office for Product Safety and Standards\n(OPSS), which is part of the Department for Business and Trade rather than an\nindependent body.\n\nRocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at consumer-rights\norganization Which? said: \u201cThe OPSS must provide industry with clear guidance\nand be prepared to take strong enforcement action against manufacturers if\nthey flout the law, but we also expect smart device brands to do right by\ntheir customers from day one and ensure shoppers can easily find information\non how long their devices will be supported and make informed purchases.\u201d\n\nViscount Camrose, one of the British legislature\u2019s hereditary peers, who was\nappointed minister for cyber by the government, said: \u201cAs every-day life\nbecomes increasingly dependent on connected devices, the threats generated by\nthe internet multiply and become even greater.\n\n\u201cFrom today, consumers will have greater peace of mind that their smart\ndevices are protected from cyber criminals, as we introduce world first laws\nthat will make sure their personal privacy, data and finances are safe,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nSimilar laws are being advanced elsewhere, although none have entered into\neffect. The European Union\u2019s Cyber Resilience Act is yet to be finally agreed,\nbut its similar provisions aren\u2019t expected to apply within the bloc until\n2027.\n\nThere is no federal law about securing consumer IoT devices in the United\nStates, although the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020 requires the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology \u201cto develop and publish\nstandards and guidelines for the federal government\u201d on how they use IoT\ndevices.\n\n  * Technology\n  * Industry\n  * News\n\nGet more insights with the\n\nRecorded Future\n\nIntelligence Cloud.\n\nLearn more.\n\nTags\n\n  * password\n  * Botnets\n  * router\n  * Internet of Things (IoT)\n  * IoT\n  * regulation\n  * law\n  * United Kingdom\n  * smart devices\n  * hardware\n\nNo previous article\n\nNo new articles\n\nAlexander Martin\n\nis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.
