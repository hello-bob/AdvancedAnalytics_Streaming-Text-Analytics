Where\ndo I want to be next year? Why haven't I managed to get that promotion this\ntime around? What's the point of all of this anyway?\n\nHow do we find answers? I am not an expert in your career. But I've been\naround enough to begin to see patterns, and sometimes being transfixed on a\nsingle goal can do more harm than good.\n\nLet's dig into this a little bit.\n\nThe Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new\nposts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\n##\n\nThe Fallacy of the Straight Line\n\nSomething that often throws people off is the idea that they need to doggedly\nprogress in a straight line. For example, if someone had gotten to the point\nin their career where they were leading a team for the first time, they might\nlook upwards and think that their ultimate goal is to find the shortest path\nto the top. See the diagram below:\n\nThis hypothetical person may believe that the game they are playing is about\ngoing from engineering manager to director to VP to CTO as quickly as\npossible, else they have failed in their quest. However, careers are long. A\nnarrow focus on getting everything yesterday can be incredibly damaging to\nboth their mental health and their ultimate destination.\n\nA quest for self-actualization through becoming CTO before the age of 35 can\nlead to burnout, disillusionment, and a sense of failure. It may also lead to\na lack of focus on the things that actually matter, such as building a\nportfolio of skills and experiences that will make them a better and wiser\nleader in the long run.\n\nAnd get this: the path to increasingly senior roles is not something that you\nhave complete control over. The upper echelons of leadership, which includes\nsenior individual contributor roles also, are a function of the skills of the\nperson that is doing them, combined with, most importantly, the fact that the\ngiven company needs someone to do that role at that time.\n\nSometimes companies just don't need someone in that position. This can pan out\nin a number of ways. For example:\n\n  * If you work for a small creative agency, it will likely never get to the scale where it will need middle management, let alone a CTO or dedicated principal engineer.\n\n  * If you work for a large enterprise, it may have a rigid internal structure that doesn't allow for the kind of lateral moves that you need to make to get the experience required to get to the top. You could wait your whole life for a promotion there.\n\n  * If you work for a company that is in decline, it may not have the resources to promote you, even if you are the best person for the job; in fact, they may be trying to flatten the organization due to this period of austerity.\n\nSo, it's often not you, it's them. And that's OK.\n\nIt is why it is so important to focus on what you can control, and let go of\nwhat you can't. And it is also important to loosen your expectations of where\nexactly your career may end up, and instead focus on the journey that you are\non right now, with a mindful eye on your general direction toward a future\nthat makes you happy whilst developing a portfolio of skills and experiences\nthat make you a better leader.\n\nAnd it just turns out that there is an analogy that we can use to help us\nthink about this: the Tarzan method.\n\n##\n\nVine Swinging\n\nNew York City\u2013based filmmaker Casey Neistat once answered a question about the\nnature of his own career progression with a neat analogy. It fits in well with\nhaving a more exploratory, playful, and joyful approach to your own career. In\nthe video, to answer the question, he pulls out a big roll of paper from the\nwall and lays it across his table, and then proceeds to draw something similar\nto the diagram below:\n\nOn the left-hand side of the diagram is where you are right now in your\ncareer. On the right-hand side of the diagram are your current goals and\naspirations, whatever they may be. The dotted line that is connecting the two\nis an idealized optimal shortest path that you could take to get from where\nyou are to where you want to be.\n\nHowever, the problem is that this direct path may not be possible, and it may\nnot even exist. If your dream is to be the CTO of the biggest technology\ncompany in the world in twenty years time, which is a grand, respectable\ndream, then how do you even plan for that? It's highly likely that this\ncompany doesn't even exist yet, and the skills that you need to get there may\nbe in a field that hasn't even been invented.\n\nInstead, you should think about your career like Tarzan swinging through the\njungle. Tarzan starts at one tree and knows that he has an ultimate\ndestination, but the path to get there isn't immediately clear: there are\nhundreds of different trees that he could swing to. He doesn't know which one\nis the right one at any given time. He just has to trust his instincts and his\ngeneral sense of direction and then progress to the next vine, and then the\nnext, and then the next. In the diagram, these vine swings are represented by\nthe up and down line that eventually connects you to your goals.\n\nAs you swing from vine to vine, those leaps will take you along a path that is\nunique to you. Your first swing may take you off-course when you measure\nyourself against the dotted straight line, but it may also take you to a place\nthat you never even knew existed. The same is true for the next swing, and the\nnext swing. These new and unknown places are marked on the diagram as circles\nat the peaks and troughs of the swings. They may even be the most important\nplaces that you visit on your journey.\n\nAnd here's the neat thing: it's likely at these most outward swings of each\nvine that you discover what really matters to you. You may find that you love\na particular type of work, or a particular type of company, or a particular\ntechnology. You may find yourself trying a role that you hadn't originally\nconsidered, or trying out working remotely, or moving to a different country.\nYou may find that you love smaller start-ups rather than big enterprises, or\nperhaps the other way around. Who knows what you might find? That's the beauty\nof the Tarzan method.\n\n##\n\nThe Trajectory of Your Swing\n\nThe Tarzan method is a great way to think about your career progression\nmetaphorically, but it doesn't give you a lot of practical advice on how to\nactually get from one vine to the next. For that, we need to think about the\ntrajectory of your swing. A heuristic can help here: scope and impact.\n\n  * Scope is the breadth of your responsibility. It covers the size of the team that you manage, the size of the budget that you control, the number of projects that you are responsible for, and the number of people that you influence. It is the size of the sandbox that you play in.\n\n  * Impact is the depth of your responsibility. It covers the result of the work that you produce, the output of your team, the effectiveness of the decisions that you make. It is the quality of the sandcastles that you build.\n\nIf you are thinking about your leadership career as a series of vine swings,\nthen you can think about each swing as a progression in either scope or\nimpact, or both. Ideally, when you zoom out at any point in your career, you\ncan step back and observe that both have been trending upward over time.\n\nIn fact, we can plot the interplay between scope and impact as a quadrant, as\nshown below:\n\nOn the x-axis, we have impact, and on the y-axis, we have scope. Given your\nown internal measurement of your current scope and impact, you can work out\nwhich quadrant applies to you in your current situation and then think about\nwhich of them should guide you in your next vine swing.\n\nEach part of the quadrant begins with the letter S, and they are, starting at\nthe bottom left and progressing clockwise:\n\n  * Stagnating: You have low impact and low scope compared to where you want to be. You are likely in a role that is not challenging you or satisfying you, and you are not making the impact that you want to make. Staying in this zone is not good in the long run. For you, it means that you are going to grow continually more dissatisfied with your work. It also becomes a vicious cycle: the less satisfied you are, the less you are likely to do good work, and the less opportunities that you are likely to get. You need to move out of this zone as soon as possible.\n\n  * Stepping up: You are in a period where you are primarily focused on increasing your scope so that it can lead to a larger impact in the future. The ways that this can typically happen are by taking on more responsibility, such as by getting promoted, or by taking a vine swing to a different, often smaller, company that is offering a bigger role than you currently have. You can commonly see this happen when someone moves from a bigger company to a smaller company for a more senior role, such as a director of engineering at a public company moving to smaller private company as a VP of engineering.\n\n  * Skyrocketing: This is where you are in a role that is both offering you a continued increase in both scope and impact. For example, you may be in a leadership role in a start-up that is growing extremely fast around you. When you're in this position, the best move is to stay where you are and continue to grow with the company. This is the most desirable position to be in, but it is also the most rare.\n\n  * Skilling up: This typically follows a stepping up period where you are primarily working on improving your performance and impact through learning new skills. This can be done by doubling-down where you are and investing in your own personal development, or by taking a smaller role at a bigger or more challenging company that will push you to learn new things.\n\nThe key to progressing in your career is to continually move around this\nquadrant between the top left and the bottom right, hoping that you get\nperiods of time in the top right. The more that you can do this, the more that\nyou will grow in your career.\n\nAnd, it goes without saying, you don't want to be in the bottom left for too\nlong.\n\nSo the question isn't \"how do I get to the top as quickly as possible?\" but\ninstead it should be \"how do I maximize my chance of skyrocketing in the\nfuture?\" Sometimes the answer to this question isn't to take the most direct\npath, but instead to take the most interesting path. You never know what you\nmight find.\n\nThink about it over the next six months. What vine are you going to swing to\nnext?\n\n26 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n26\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Tarzan Method\n\ntheengineeringmanager.substack.com\n\n3\n\nShare\n\n3 Comments\n\nAnton ZaidesLeading DevelopersApr 25Liked by James StanierThat\u2019s a great\nanalogy, I\u2019m going to steal that one for myself. I\u2019m guilty of most of the\nthings you mentioned in the intro - the desire to move to the top in a\nstraight line.The vine analogy gives me the freedom to experiment, without\nbeing disappointed if I don\u2019t get the exact role I aimed for.I do think though\nthat sometimes it\u2019s up for us to create the opportunities inside the\norganization. A smaller organization, or one that is in decline, can still\nprovide you with options to increase impact/scope/both, in some places even\nwith the title attached.Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by James Stanier\n\nBenil DoshiApr 24Liked by James StanierYet another masterpiece from Mr\nJames!Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 more comment...\n\nThe problem with your manager...\n\nIt's probably nothing to do with them.\n\nDec 30, 2023 \u2022\n\nJames Stanier\n\n67\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The problem with your manager...\n\ntheengineeringmanager.substack.com\n\n16\n\nManage your capacity, not your time\n\nWe obsess over managing our time.
