This is an illustration of APL\u2019s concept: a system\nthat fits the payload of a standard Humvee.\n\nCredit: Johns Hopkins APL\n\n###### Thu, 06/01/2023 - 20:42\n\nFor researchers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in\nLaurel, Maryland, the challenge of feeding people during times of crisis or\nconflict is an opportunity to dramatically reinvent how food is made: out of\nalmost nothing.\n\n\u201cYes, we are aiming to create food from thin air,\u201d said Collin Timm, a\nchemical and biological engineer at APL. \u201cIt would be a revolutionary\ncapability to be able to produce food on demand in any setting.\u201d\n\nTimm is the principal investigator for one of four teams selected for the\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2019s (DARPA) Cornucopia program. He\nleads the APL research team in attempting to unlock the potential to produce\nnutritionally complete, palatable foods in the field. The group is using\nelectricity to capture water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and trace minerals from\nthe air and then producing a rich, glucose-based material (called feedstock)\non which to grow microbial food products.\n\nAPL\u2019s approach, dubbed RePLICaTE \u2014 for Reducing Provisions and Logistics\nInputs through Calorie Transformation from Electricity \u2014 is focused on\ndelivering a working prototype, demonstrating a leap forward in food\nproduction on demand. Collaborators on the project include the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, North Carolina State University and Meridian Biotech.\n\n## The Feedstock Is the Key\n\nFeedstock refers to a raw material that is used as fuel or converted to\nanother form of fuel or energy product. For example, crude oil is a feedstock\nused to create gasoline, corn is used to produce ethanol, and soybean oil is\nused to produce biodiesel.\n\n\u201cOur process is focused on generating a central, rich feedstock from the\ncomponents in air to support the growth of food microbes,\u201d explained APL\u2019s\nWilliam Stone, a molecular biologist overseeing this aspect of the project.\nThe team will capture carbon dioxide from the air and reduce it into simple\norganic molecules, such as formate and acetate, using sequential chemical\nreactors. Those products, in turn, will be converted into sugars.\n\n\u201cWe are using upstream technologies to convert air and electricity into\nmolecular building blocks, such as sugars and fixed nitrogen, that are\nrequired for microbes,\u201d Stone said. \u201cDownstream food-safe microbes then use\nthis feedstock to efficiently produce all the macronutrients and vitamins to\nbe included in food products. Marrying the upstream and downstream processes\nis a complex systems integration challenge that we are well prepared to\ntackle.\u201d\n\nTo develop these upstream complex processes, APL is collaborating with experts\nat the Johns Hopkins Ralph O\u2019Connor Sustainable Energy Institute who\nspecialize in creating useful products from atmospheric carbon.\n\n\u201cWe aim to extract as many of the nutrients microbes need to produce food from\nthe air as possible.\u201d Stone said. \u201cWe will even capture dust and other\nparticulate matter and extract trace minerals like iron and magnesium that are\nneeded for nutritionally complete food products.\u201d\n\n## All in Good Taste\n\nThe team is also focused on another important part of the eating experience:\ntaste.\n\n\u201cWe are attempting to genetically engineer the production of vitamins and\nflavor components, like butter or vanilla, in organisms generally regarded as\nsafe by the FDA for human consumption,\u201d said Julie Gleason, a molecular\nbiologist at APL.\n\nIn addition to the flavor engineering work led by APL, Meridian Biotech is\nidentifying nutritious, palatable microbes and processing them into food\nformats. Meridan\u2019s texturization process converts bacteria and fungi into\nready-to-eat microbial shakes, bars and jerkies. North Carolina State\nUniversity brings expertise in developing novel technologies for engineering\ndiverse organisms. \u201cThe goal is to create a nutritionally complete tasty meal\nreplacement bar or shake,\u201d Gleason added.\n\nOne of the trickiest challenges, Timm said, is integrating these chemical and\nbiological operations into a single process. It poses design and control\nchallenges such as balancing carbon and nitrogen capture ratios, optimizing\nthe production of the RePLICaTE feedstock, and allocating energy efficiently\nto produce and process the final product.\n\nDARPA has also challenged the teams to create a manufacturing and housing\nsystem that could fit on the back of a truck, which deployed troops could use\nto make nourishing and appetizing food on demand in remote locations, removing\nthe need for costly and vulnerable food supply chains.\n\nThe current primary source of nutrition in many military operations \u2014 called\nMeal, Ready-to-Eat, or MRE \u2014 is not recommended as a sole source of food for\nlong missions, not approved for civilian use and not tailored for age and\ngender differences.\n\n\u201cOur solution has got to lend itself to military field operations and disaster\nrelief efforts,\u201d Timm said. \u201cSo, we are aiming for something that fits the\npayload of a standard Humvee.\u201d\n\n## Leveraging Soldier Support\n\nThis new program benefits from APL\u2019s decades of work on projects designed to\ndirectly support soldiers in the field. Timm noted that the Laboratory has,\nfor some time, focused on unburdening the warfighter and ensuring access to\nresources on demand.\n\nRecently, APL scientists have undertaken internally funded projects to produce\nglucose from microbes and engineer microbes for food production.\n\nThe team is also motivated by the impact RePLICaTE could have on the planet\u2019s\nchanging climate. Those early research projects provided critical proofs of\nconcept and preliminary data for RePLICaTE, APL\u2019s latest foray in a growing\neffort to address climate change and its impacts.\n\n\u201cAs part of our work in this area, we\u2019ve been very interested in the\nresilience of food systems, and we\u2019ve been investing in the development of\ntechnologies to provide for basic needs when climate change-induced extreme\nweather strikes,\u201d said Marisa Hughes, the environmental resilience research\nlead in APL\u2019s Research and Exploratory Development Department.\n\n\u201cThis system has the potential to transition to Department of Defense\nexpeditionary partners and cross-agency responders to disasters and\ndisplacements,\u201d she said. \u201cWith further refinement, larger food-on-demand\nsystems could expand to alleviate food logistics limitations across the armed\nservices and enhance homeland security by increasing resilience of domestic\nfood supply chains. Furthermore, if paired with renewable energy, this could\nproduce food products with a drastically reduced carbon footprint.\u201d\n\nMaking climate-informed decisions, adapting our forces to a climate-changed\nworld, and contributing to our nation\u2019s climate goals are among the many\nchallenges that require bold innovations. APL\u2019s Research Frontiers Forum on\nJune 8 will explore goals, gaps and game-changing research in climate change\nand national security.\n\nLearn more about these efforts at jhuapl.edu/ourwork/climate.\n\nThis material is based on work supported by the Defense Advanced Research\nProjects Agency (DARPA) and Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific (NIWC\nPacific) under Contract No. N66001-23-C-4007.
