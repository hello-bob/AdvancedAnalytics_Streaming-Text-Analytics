Taiwan\nstrongly objects to China\u2019s sovereignty claims and says only the island\u2019s\npeople can decide their future.\n\nEarlier this week, a Chinese ministry of foreign affairs (MFA) spokesperson\nsaid Volt Typhoon was in fact unrelated to China\u2019s government, but was part of\na criminal ransomware group.\n\nIn a statement, China\u2019s embassy in Washington referred back to the MFA\nspokesperson\u2019s comment, saying: \u201cSome in the US have been using origin-tracing\nof cyber-attacks as a tool to hit and frame China, claiming the US to be the\nvictim while it\u2019s the other way round, and politicizing cybersecurity issues.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you\nwhat\u2019s happening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.
