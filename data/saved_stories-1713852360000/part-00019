I believe that's true, but I also believe\nthat I've adopted it as an approach I take for self-preservation and a hedge\ntowards always taking a conservative approach to, well, work, design \u2014 most\nthings.\n\nI took this approach when I chose a major in college. I didn't think I could\nhandle the math required to pursue something like computer science, so I\nmajored and business and economics. I've never used the degree.^[1]\n\nI will readily defer to folks I feel are more experienced than I am. I tend to\nbe more collaborative as well since I'm always looking to learn from others. I\ntell myself I don't have an eye for design (I really don't think I do), so\nanything I build leans heavily on text and narrow color sets.\n\nI'm typically reticent to speak up (especially in person) and am much more\ncontent to sit in the corner and read a book \u2014 so to speak. John Oliver did a\nbit recently where he characterized political figures' personalities as books,\ntheir preferred vacation as books \u2014 you get the idea \u2014 and yeah, that'd be me\ntoo.\n\nI approach things this way so that there's less space exposed for failure. It\nallows me to approach things very incrementally, tweaking and changing things\nin iterative, small steps. I'll build a minimum viable version of something\nthat I know works and iterate on it endlessly until it's grown to where I want\nit and I can trust it to continue working.\n\nThis yields slow progress, but it tends to be reliable. I avoid the risks and\n\u2014 perhaps \u2014 rewards that come with bigger leaps. I'd much rather move slow and\nfix things than move faster and risk breaking things.\n\n  1.
