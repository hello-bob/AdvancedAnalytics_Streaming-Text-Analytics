This\nunderscores the necessity for a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and user-\ncentric social network.\n\n## The Nostr revolution\n\nNostr, acronym for \u201cNotes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays\u201d,\nrevolutionizes social networking and online communication by eliminating\ndependency of centralized servers.It employs a client-relay model, where users\nrun clients, and anyone can operate relays.\n\nThis protocol ensures tamperproof communication through cryptographic keys and\nsignatures. By enabling users to establish pathways and publish notes to\nrelays and incentivizing relay operators, Nostr addresses many shortcomings of\nexisting systems.\n\nEmpowering freedom in Nostr\n\nA secure, user-centric protocol and social network\n\n### You own your identity, signed\n\nNostr uses a public key system, where your identity is tied to a unique\ncryptographic key. You have full control over your identity without relying on\na central authority. Nostr's protocol eliminates the need for Know Your\nCustomer (KYC) processes. No email, ID, thumbprint, or eyeball scans required.\nYour privacy is entirely yours to safeguard.\n\n### You own your data, signed\n\nUsers sign their posts with their cryptographic keys in Nostr. This\ncryptographic signature ensures the authenticity of your data, and you\nmaintain ownership over it. Each client validates these signatures, ensuring\ndata integrity. Users select relays for data exchange, and relays communicate\ndirectly with users, not with each other.\n\n### You own your audience\n\nIn Nostr, you have full control over your audience. Users choose their\npreferred relay servers and can recommend relays to maintain their follower\nbase, even if they switch relays. Additionally, users can mute other users,\nwords, and contents (if the feature is available), shaping their social media\nfeed according to their preferences.\n\n### You are free to speak\n\nYou can publish anything you want as long as relays are willing to accept it.\nIf no one accepts what you have to say you can easily run your own relay.\nRelays can ban some users from publishing to them, but if you have people that\nfollow you can always find another relay to publish to and your follower\nclients should be capable of finding you there and continue to get your\nupdates.\n\n### You are free to be anonymous\n\nNostr supports user anonymity. Users can choose to be anonymous or use\npseudonyms without compromising their ability to participate. Nostr is also\navailable On TOR that prevents tracking of users. Nostr does not have the\ncapacity to provide user data to governments, safeguarding users' freedom of\nexpression from prohibitions or restrictions.\n\n### You are free to develop\n\nNostr encourages development and customization. Users are free to develop on\nthe platform, contributing to the growth and evolution of the network. Anyone\ncan build on Nostr, creating clients, relays, tools, and apps. Users have the\nfreedom to establish payment methods for their features, providing developers\nwith a potential source of revenue.\n\n## Get started with Nostr\n\n### Create an account\n\nWith Nostr there is not a central provider that give you an account, in fact\nyour account is powered just by cryptography, and you could create one (or\nmore!) yourself by hand, without any limit. But usually the easist way is to\nuse a Nostr app to bootstrap a new account and then use it everywhere.\n\n### Secure your key\n\nAn account is a key-pair. The private key (nsec) is your digital identity, if\nyou loose or leak it, you are burned; so you need to keep your key-pair secure\nand private. Use a password manager, make a backup on paper and use it only in\ntrusted apps. Never enter your nsec in a website, install a signer extension.\n\n### Pick an app\n\nNostr developers already have built several applications that cover different\nareas; probably the easist way to start using Nostr and learn more is\ndownloading a social client and start getting involved with the community and\nlearn more. Need help? Use the #asknostr hashtag!\n\n### Explore Nostr\n\nAfter you are familiar with the basic concepts you can explore other social\nclients and other Nostr applications; your already have your digital identity\nand it works everywhere, so you can simply login in using your nsec. As usual\nbe sure that the app is from a trusted source!\n\nNostr resources\n\nDiscover how many things you can do with Nostr\n\n## Microblogging\n\n### Damus\n\n### Coracle\n\n### Gossip\n\n## Long-form\n\n### Habla\n\n### Yakihonne\n\n### Shipyard\n\n## Streaming\n\n### Nests\n\n### Zap.stream\n\n### Stemstr\n\n## Community\n\n### Highlighter\n\n### Flockstr\n\n### Creatr\n\n## Other Stuff\n\n### Blowater\n\n### Amethyst\n\n### Flare\n\n## Key Management\n\n### nos2x\n\n### Amber\n\n### nsec.app\n\nThis is only a quick selection of the 80+ applications that have already been\nbuilt on Nostr, discover them all!\n\n## Develop on Nostr\n\n## Where all started\n\nThe Nostr \"manifesto\" was published in 2019 and slowly but surely the\ncommunity gathered around the idea and expanded it, turning it into a fast,\nflexible and usable protocol that is used by real people everyday.\n\nRead more >>\n\n## Discover the NIPs\n\nNIPs stand for \"Nostr Implementation Possibilities\", they exist to document\nwhat may be implemented by Nostr compatible relay and client software; study\nthem to develop your project.\n\nRead more >>\n\npowered by njump & open-sourced on github\n\n", "frontpage": false}
