One\nof those was when I decided to return to Nigeria after a stint at Harvard. I\nknow people who called me stupid for making that decision. Yes, they did to my\nface. Or was it when I moved from the city where things were \u2018happening\u2019?\n\nI remember how in a private 'hangout' with Sam Altman some years ago, he\nshared how though being an investor fit his natural strengths and his way of\ninteracting with people, he still chose to run OpenAI as an operator. At that\ntime, he was terrible at managing people. This was some years before GPT-3 was\npublicly available. He was willing to look stupid, and frankly miserable, as\nan operator, so he could work on an important problem.\n\nLooking stupid is a good way to master the moat of low status.\n\nIt is a decent entrance into setting aside the glory of previous achievements\nand continue the journey of evolving.\n\nA lot of good decisions we make will look stupid. That's not a problem if we\ncan cope with being misunderstood for a little while. It becomes a problem\nwhen it makes us feel stupid.\n\nWe shouldn't try things out only when it is obvious to everyone. Or when there\nis a public concensus that it is honourable to do something.\n\nWe often won't look beautiful during the phase as we evolve. We may not be\nable to defend the decisions in convincing ways - which confirms our\n'stupidity'.\n\nBut the result of doing the right things in the right sequence, over time,\nbecomes the proof.\n\nIt is better to look stupid for a while and become better, than become stupid\nby doing nothing about that longing in your heart1.\n\n1\n\nIn this context, stupid is used to explain a lack of sound judgement.\n\n### Subscribe to More! by Damola\n\nBy Damola Morenikeji\n\nDamola's musings, and learnings, published every day-ish.\n\nShare\n\nKinda nice\n\nA kind person will help you understand reality as it is, prompt you to\nreflect, and nudge you to fine-tune your position till you get to a place\nwhere...\n\nFeb 19 \u2022\n\nDamola Morenikeji\n\nThe /ai 'manifesto'\n\nTo retain the trust others have in you and your work, tell us how you made use\nof AI in your craft.
