U.S. insurance companies have dropped customers over images that are\noutdated or misrepresented. In one example given by the publication, a drone\nphoto that initially appeared to show fallen tree limbs was actually just\nshadows.\n\nCindy Picos, who lives in Auburn, California, tells The Wall Street Journal\nthat her home insurance CSAA Insurance used a drone to take aerial photos of\nher home and then dropped her as a customer.\n\n\u201cI thought they had the wrong house. Our roof is in fine shape,\u201d Picos says.\n\nTo prove that her roof was in fine condition, Picos hired an independent\ninspection company to survey her Californian home The company told her that\nher roof had another 10 years of life at least.\n\nHowever, CSAA Insurance still refused to reconsider its decision and Picos was\nnever even allowed to view the insurer\u2019s aerial images.\n\nA spokesman for CSAA Insurance tells The Washington Street Journal that it has\nsince changed its policy to allow customers to see images on request. The\nspokesperson claims that plane and satellite images are reviewed by employees\nand enable accurate and efficient inspections.\n\nImage credits: Header photo licensed via Depositphotos.\n\nCulture, News, Technology\n\naerialphotography, drone, insurance\n\nRelated Articles\n\nInsurance Company Flew a Drone to Take Photos of Man\u2019s House and Canceled His\nPolicy\n\nVerifly: $1,000,000 in Drone Insurance \u2018On Demand\u2019 for as Little as $10/Hour\n\nSix Production Companies Get an Official OK from the FAA to Use Drones\n\nReckless Drone Pilots Cause the Destruction of Thousands of Bird Eggs\n\nDiscussion\n\nTrending Articles\n\nFilm Director: If Guns Require Licenses, Why Not Cameras?\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nMKBHD Calls Humane AI Pin the \u2018Worst Product\u2019 He\u2019s Ever Reviewed\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nThis \u2018Photo\u2019 Was Made From an 84-Year-Old Woman\u2019s Memory\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\nThe Trailer for the World\u2019s First Fully AI-Generated Film is Here\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nPhotographer Helps Grizzly Bear Narrowly Escape Oncoming Train\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\nReading mode: Light Dark\n\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc.
