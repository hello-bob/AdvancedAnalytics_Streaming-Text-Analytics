Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer\nof nurses during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded\nsoldiers at Constantinople.^[4] She significantly reduced death rates by\nimproving hygiene and living standards. Nightingale gave nursing a favourable\nreputation and became an icon of Victorian culture, especially in the persona\nof \"The Lady with the Lamp\" making rounds of wounded soldiers at\nnight.^[5]^[6]\n\nRecent commentators have asserted that Nightingale's Crimean War achievements\nwere exaggerated by the media at the time, but critics agree on the importance\nof her later work in professionalising nursing roles for women.^[7] In 1860,\nshe laid the foundation of professional nursing with the establishment of her\nnursing school at St Thomas' Hospital in London. It was the first secular\nnursing school in the world and is now part of King's College London.^[8] In\nrecognition of her pioneering work in nursing, the Nightingale Pledge taken by\nnew nurses, and the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest international\ndistinction a nurse can achieve, were named in her honour, and the annual\nInternational Nurses Day is celebrated on her birthday. Her social reforms\nincluded improving healthcare for all sections of British society, advocating\nbetter hunger relief in India, helping to abolish prostitution laws that were\nharsh for women, and expanding the acceptable forms of female participation in\nthe workforce.\n\nNightingale was a pioneer in statistics; she represented her analysis in\ngraphical forms to ease drawing conclusions and actionables from data. She is\nfamous for usage of the polar area diagram, also called the Nightingale rose\ndiagram, equivalent to a modern circular histogram. This diagram is still\nregularly used in data visualisation.\n\nNightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer. In her lifetime, much of\nher published work was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her\ntracts were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood\nby those with poor literary skills. She was also a pioneer in data\nvisualisation with the use of infographics, using graphical presentations of\nstatistical data in an effective way.^[7] Much of her writing, including her\nextensive work on religion and mysticism, has only been published\nposthumously.\n\n## Early life\n\nEmbley Park in Hampshire, now a school, one of the family homes of William\nNightingale\n\nFlorence Nightingale was born on 12 May 1820 into a wealthy and well-connected\nBritish family at the Villa Colombaia,^[9]^[10] in Florence, Tuscany, Italy,\nand was named after the city of her birth. Florence's older sister Frances\nParthenope had similarly been named after her place of birth, Parthenope, a\nGreek settlement now part of the city of Naples. The family moved back to\nEngland in 1821, with Nightingale being brought up in the family's homes at\nEmbley, Hampshire, and Lea Hurst, Derbyshire.^[11]^[12]\n\nFlorence inherited a liberal-humanitarian outlook from both sides of her\nfamily.^[7] Her parents were William Edward Nightingale, born William Edward\nShore (1794\u20131874) and Frances (\"Fanny\") Nightingale (n\u00e9e Smith; 1788\u20131880).\nWilliam's mother Mary (n\u00e9e Evans) was the niece of Peter Nightingale, under\nthe terms of whose will William inherited his estate at Lea Hurst, and assumed\nthe name and arms of Nightingale. Fanny's father (Florence's maternal\ngrandfather) was the abolitionist and Unitarian William Smith.^[13]\nNightingale's father educated her.^[12]\n\nA BBC documentary reported that \"Florence and her older sister Parthenope\nbenefited from their father's advanced ideas about women's education. They\nstudied history, mathematics, Italian, classical literature, and philosophy,\nand from an early age Florence, who was the more academic of the two girls,\ndisplayed an extraordinary ability for collecting and analysing data which she\nwould use to great effect in later life.\"^[7]\n\nYoung Florence Nightingale\n\nIn 1838, her father took the family on a tour in Europe where she was\nintroduced to the English-born Parisian hostess Mary Clarke, with whom\nFlorence bonded. She recorded that \"Clarkey\" was a stimulating hostess who did\nnot care for her appearance, and while her ideas did not always agree with\nthose of her guests, \"she was incapable of boring anyone.\" Her behaviour was\nsaid to be exasperating and eccentric and she had little respect for upper-\nclass British women, whom she regarded generally as inconsequential. She said\nthat if given the choice between being a woman or a galley slave, then she\nwould choose the freedom of the galleys. She generally rejected female company\nand spent her time with male intellectuals. Clarke made an exception, however,\nin the case of the Nightingale family and Florence in particular. She and\nFlorence were to remain close friends for 40 years despite their 27-year age\ndifference. Clarke demonstrated that women could be equal to men, an idea that\nFlorence had not learnt from her mother.^[14]\n\nNightingale underwent the first of several experiences that she believed were\ncalls from God in February 1837 while at Embley Park, prompting a strong\ndesire to devote her life to the service of others. In her youth she was\nrespectful of her family's opposition to her working as a nurse, only\nannouncing her decision to enter the field in 1844. Despite the anger and\ndistress of her mother and sister, she rejected the expected role for a woman\nof her status to become a wife and mother. Nightingale worked hard to educate\nherself in the art and science of nursing, in the face of opposition from her\nfamily and the restrictive social code for affluent young English women.^[15]\n\nPainting of Nightingale by Augustus Egg, c. 1840s\n\nAs a young woman, Nightingale was described as attractive, slender, and\ngraceful. While her demeanour was often severe, she was said to be very\ncharming and to possess a radiant smile. Her most persistent suitor was the\npolitician and poet Richard Monckton Milnes, but after a nine-year courtship,\nshe rejected him, convinced that marriage would interfere with her ability to\nfollow her calling to nursing.^[15]\n\nIn Rome in 1847, she met Sidney Herbert, a politician who had been Secretary\nat War (1845\u20131846) who was on his honeymoon. He and Nightingale became\nlifelong close friends. Herbert would be Secretary of War again during the\nCrimean War when he and his wife would be instrumental in facilitating\nNightingale's nursing work in Crimea. She became Herbert's key adviser\nthroughout his political career, though she was accused by some of having\nhastened Herbert's death from Bright's disease in 1861 because of the pressure\nher programme of reform placed on him. Nightingale also much later had strong\nrelations with academic Benjamin Jowett, who may have wanted to marry\nher.^[16]\n\nNightingale c. 1854\n\nNightingale continued her travels (now with Charles and Selina Bracebridge) as\nfar as Greece and Egypt. While in Athens, Greece, Nightingale rescued a\njuvenile little owl from a group of children who were tormenting it, and she\nnamed the owl Athena. Nightingale often carried the owl in her pocket, until\nthe pet died (shortly before Nightingale left for Crimea).^[17]\n\nHer writings on Egypt, in particular, are testimony to her learning, literary\nskill, and philosophy of life. Sailing up the Nile as far as Abu Simbel in\nJanuary 1850, she wrote of the Abu Simbel temples, \"Sublime in the highest\nstyle of intellectual beauty, intellect without effort, without suffering ...\nnot a feature is correct \u2014 but the whole effect is more expressive of\nspiritual grandeur than anything I could have imagined. It makes the\nimpression upon one that thousands of voices do, uniting in one unanimous\nsimultaneous feeling of enthusiasm or emotion, which is said to overcome the\nstrongest man.\"^[18]\n\nAt Thebes, she wrote of being \"called to God\", while a week later near Cairo\nshe wrote in her diary (as distinct from her far longer letters that her elder\nsister Parthenope was to print after her return): \"God called me in the\nmorning and asked me would I do good for him alone without reputation.\"^[18]\nLater in 1850, she visited the Lutheran religious community at Kaiserswerth-\nam-Rhein in Germany, where she observed Pastor Theodor Fliedner and the\ndeaconesses working for the sick and the deprived. She regarded the experience\nas a turning point in her life and issued her findings anonymously in 1851;\nThe Institution of Kaiserswerth on the Rhine, for the Practical Training of\nDeaconesses, etc. was her first published work.^[19] She also received four\nmonths of medical training at the institute, which formed the basis for her\nlater care.\n\nOn 22 August 1853, Nightingale took the post of superintendent at the\nInstitute for the Care of Sick Gentlewomen in Upper Harley Street, London, a\nposition she held until October 1854.^[20] Her father had given her an annual\nincome of \u00a3500 (roughly \u00a340,000/US$65,000 in present terms), which allowed her\nto live comfortably and to pursue her career.^[21]\n\n## Crimean War\n\nA print of the jewel awarded to Nightingale by Queen Victoria, for her\nservices to the soldiers in the war\n\nFlorence Nightingale's most famous contribution came during the Crimean War,\nwhich became her central focus when reports got back to Britain about the\nhorrific conditions for the wounded at the military hospital on the Asiatic\nside of the Bosporus, opposite Constantinople, at Scutari (modern-day \u00dcsk\u00fcdar\nin Istanbul). Britain and France entered the war against Russia on the side of\nthe Ottoman Empire. On 21 October 1854, she and the staff of 38 women\nvolunteer nurses including her head nurse Eliza Roberts and her aunt Mai\nSmith,^[22] and 15 Catholic nuns (mobilised by Henry Edward Manning)^[23] were\nsent (under the authorisation of Sidney Herbert) to the Ottoman Empire. On the\nway, Nightingale was assisted in Paris by her friend Mary Clarke.^[24] The\nvolunteer nurses worked about 295 nautical miles (546 km; 339 mi) away from\nthe main British camp across the Black Sea at Balaklava, in the Crimea.\n\nLetter from Nightingale to Mary Mohl, 1881\n\nNightingale arrived at Selimiye Barracks in Scutari early in November 1854.\nHer team found that poor care for wounded soldiers was being delivered by\noverworked medical staff in the face of official indifference. Medicines were\nin short supply, hygiene was being neglected, and mass infections were common,\nmany of them fatal. There was no equipment to process food for the patients:\n\n> This frail young woman ... embraced in her solicitude the sick of three\n> armies.\n>\n> \u2014 Lucien Baudens, La guerre de Crim\u00e9e, les campements, les abris, les\n> ambulances, les h\u00f4pitaux, p. 104.^[25]\n\nAfter Nightingale sent a plea to The Times for a government solution to the\npoor condition of the facilities, the British Government commissioned Isambard\nKingdom Brunel to design a prefabricated hospital that could be built in\nEngland and shipped to the Dardanelles. The result was Renkioi Hospital, a\ncivilian facility that, under the management of Edmund Alexander Parkes, had a\ndeath rate less than one tenth of that of Scutari.^[26]\n\nStephen Paget in the Dictionary of National Biography asserted that\nNightingale reduced the death rate from 42% to 2%, either by making\nimprovements in hygiene herself, or by calling for the Sanitary\nCommission.^[27] For example, Nightingale implemented handwashing in the\nhospital where she worked.^[28]\n\nFlorence Nightingale, an angel of mercy. Scutari hospital, 1855\n\nDuring her first winter at Scutari, 4,077 soldiers died there. Ten times more\nsoldiers died from illnesses such as typhus, typhoid, cholera, and dysentery\nthan from battle wounds. With overcrowding, defective sewers and lack of\nventilation, the Sanitary Commission had to be sent out by the British\ngovernment to Scutari in March 1855, almost six months after Nightingale had\narrived. The commission flushed out the sewers and improved ventilation.^[29]\nDeath rates were sharply reduced, but she never claimed credit for helping to\nreduce the death rate.^[30]^[31] Head Nurse Eliza Roberts nursed Nightingale\nthrough her critical illness of May 1855.^[32]\n\nIn 2001 and 2008 the BBC released documentaries that were critical of\nNightingale's performance in the Crimean War, as were some follow-up articles\npublished in The Guardian and the Sunday Times. Nightingale scholar Lynn\nMcDonald has dismissed these criticisms as \"often preposterous\", arguing they\nare not supported by the primary sources.^[12]\n\nNightingale still believed that the death rates were due to poor nutrition,\nlack of supplies, stale air, and overworking of the soldiers. After she\nreturned to Britain and began collecting evidence before the Royal Commission\non the Health of the Army, she came to believe that most of the soldiers at\nthe hospital were killed by poor living conditions. This experience influenced\nher later career when she advocated sanitary living conditions as of great\nimportance. Consequently, she reduced peacetime deaths in the army and turned\nher attention to the sanitary design of hospitals and the introduction of\nsanitation in working-class homes (see Statistics and Sanitary Reform).^[33]\n\nThe Mission of Mercy: Florence Nightingale receiving the Wounded at Scutari\n(Jerry Barrett, 1857)\n\nAccording to some secondary sources, Nightingale had a frosty relationship\nwith her fellow nurse Mary Seacole, who ran a hotel/hospital for officers.\nSeacole's own memoir, Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands,\nrecords only one, friendly, meeting with her, when she asked her for a bed for\nthe night and got it; Seacole was in Scutari en route to the Crimea to join\nher business partner and start their business. However, Seacole pointed out\nthat when she tried to join Nightingale's group, one of Nightingale's\ncolleagues rebuffed her, and Seacole inferred that racism was at the root of\nthat rebuttal.^[34] Nightingale told her brother-in-law, in a private letter,\nthat she was worried about contact between her work and Seacole's business,\nclaiming that while \"she was very kind to the men and, what is more, to the\nOfficers \u2013 and did some good (she) made many drunk\".^[35] Nightingale\nreportedly wrote, \"I had the greatest difficulty in repelling Mrs. Seacole's\nadvances, and in preventing association between her and my nurses (absolutely\nout of the question!) ... Anyone who employs Mrs. Seacole will introduce much\nkindness \u2013 also much drunkenness and improper conduct\".^[36] On the other\nhand, Seacole told the French chef Alexis Soyer that \"You must know, M Soyer,\nthat Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When I passed through Scutari, she\nvery kindly gave me board and lodging.\"^[37]\n\nThe arrival of two waves of Irish nuns, the Sisters of Mercy, to assist with\nnursing duties at Scutari met with different responses from Nightingale. Mary\nClare Moore headed the first wave and placed herself and her Sisters under the\nauthority of Nightingale. The two were to remain friends for the rest of their\nlives.^[38] The second wave, headed by Mary Francis Bridgeman met with a\ncooler reception as Bridgeman refused to give up her authority over her\nSisters to Nightingale while at the same time not trusting Nightingale, whom\nshe regarded as ambitious.^[39]^[40]\n\n### The Lady with the Lamp\n\nThe Lady with the Lamp. Popular lithograph reproduction of a painting of\nNightingale by Henrietta Rae, 1891.\n\nDuring the Crimean War, Nightingale gained the nickname \"The Lady with the\nLamp\" from a phrase in a report in The Times:\n\n> She is a \"ministering angel\" without any exaggeration in these hospitals,\n> and as her slender form glides quietly along each corridor, every poor\n> fellow's face softens with gratitude at the sight of her. When all the\n> medical officers have retired for the night and silence and darkness have\n> settled down upon those miles of prostrate sick, she may be observed alone,\n> with a little lamp in her hand, making her solitary rounds.\n>\n> \u2014 William Russell, Cited in Cook, E. T. (1913). The Life of Florence\n> Nightingale. Vol. 1, p. 237.\n\nThe phrase was further popularised by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1857 poem\n\"Santa Filomena\":^[41]\n\n> Lo! in that house of misery A lady with a lamp I see Pass through the\n> glimmering gloom, And flit from room to room.\n\nNightingale was nicknamed \"the lady with the hammer\" by the troops after using\na hammer to break into locked storage to access medicine to treat the wounded.\nHowever, Russell thought the behaviour was unladylike, and invented an\nalternative, leading to \"The Lady with the Lamp\".^[42]^[43]\n\n## Later career\n\nIn the Crimea on 29 November 1855, the Nightingale Fund was established for\nthe training of nurses during a public meeting to recognise Nightingale for\nher work in the war. There was an outpouring of generous donations. Sidney\nHerbert served as honorary secretary of the fund and the Duke of Cambridge was\nchairman. In her 1856 letters she described spas in the Ottoman Empire,\ndetailing the health conditions, physical descriptions, dietary information,\nand other vital details of patients whom she directed there. She noted that\nthe treatment there was significantly less expensive than in Switzerland.^[44]\n\nNightingale, c. 1858, by Goodman\n\nNightingale had \u00a345,000 at her disposal from the Nightingale Fund to set up\nthe first nursing school, the Nightingale Training School, at St Thomas'\nHospital on 9 July 1860.^[45] The first trained Nightingale nurses began work\non 16 May 1865 at the Liverpool Workhouse Infirmary. Now called the Florence\nNightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, the school is part of King's\nCollege London. In 1866 she said the Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital in\nAylesbury near her sister's home Claydon House would be \"the most beautiful\nhospital in England\", and in 1868 called it \"an excellent model to\nfollow\".^[46]\n\nNightingale wrote Notes on Nursing (1859). The book served as the cornerstone\nof the curriculum at the Nightingale School and other nursing schools, though\nit was written specifically for the education of those nursing at home.\nNightingale wrote, \"Every day sanitary knowledge, or the knowledge of nursing,\nor in other words, of how to put the constitution in such a state as that it\nwill have no disease, or that it can recover from disease, takes a higher\nplace. It is recognised as the knowledge which every one ought to have \u2013\ndistinct from medical knowledge, which only a profession can have\".^[47]\n\nNotes on Nursing also sold well to the general reading public and is\nconsidered a classic introduction to nursing. Nightingale spent the rest of\nher life promoting and organising the nursing profession. In the introduction\nto the 1974 edition, Joan Quixley of the Nightingale School of Nursing wrote:\n\"The book was the first of its kind ever to be written. It appeared at a time\nwhen the simple rules of health were only beginning to be known, when its\ntopics were of vital importance not only for the well-being and recovery of\npatients, when hospitals were riddled with infection, when nurses were still\nmainly regarded as ignorant, uneducated persons. The book has, inevitably, its\nplace in the history of nursing, for it was written by the founder of modern\nnursing\".^[48]\n\nIllustration in Charles Dickens' Martin Chuzzlewit. Nurse Sarah Gamp (left)\nbecame a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian\nera, before the reforms of Nightingale.\n\nAs Mark Bostridge has demonstrated, one of Nightingale's signal achievements\nwas the introduction of trained nurses into the workhouse system in Britain\nfrom the 1860s onwards.^[49] This meant that sick paupers were no longer being\ncared for by other, able-bodied paupers, but by properly trained nursing\nstaff. In the first half of the 19th century, nurses were usually former\nservants or widows who found no other job and therefore were forced to earn\ntheir living by this work. Charles Dickens caricatured the standard of care in\nhis 1842\u20131843 published novel Martin Chuzzlewit in the figure of Sarah Gamp as\nbeing incompetent, negligent, alcoholic and corrupt. According to Caroline\nWorthington, director of the Florence Nightingale Museum, \"When she\n[Nightingale] started out there was no such thing as nursing. The Dickens\ncharacter Sarah Gamp, who was more interested in drinking gin than looking\nafter her patients, was only a mild exaggeration. Hospitals were places of\nlast resort where the floors were laid with straw to soak up the blood.\nFlorence transformed nursing when she got back [from Crimea]. She had access\nto people in high places and she used it to get things done. Florence was\nstubborn, opinionated, and forthright but she had to be those things in order\nto achieve all that she did.\"^[50]\n\nThough Nightingale is sometimes said to have denied the theory of infection\nfor her entire life, a 2008 biography disagrees,^[49] saying that she was\nsimply opposed to a precursor of germ theory known as contagionism. This\ntheory held that diseases could only be transmitted by touch. Before the\nexperiments of the mid-1860s by Pasteur and Lister, hardly anyone took germ\ntheory seriously; even afterwards, many medical practitioners were\nunconvinced. Bostridge points out that in the early 1880s Nightingale wrote an\narticle for a textbook in which she advocated strict precautions designed, she\nsaid, to kill germs. Nightingale's work served as an inspiration for nurses in\nthe American Civil War. The Union government approached her for advice in\norganising field medicine. Her ideas inspired the volunteer body of the United\nStates Sanitary Commission.^[51]\n\nNightingale advocated autonomous nursing leadership, and that her new style of\nmatrons had full control and discipline over their nursing staff.^[52] The\ninfamous \"Guy's Hospital dispute\" in 1879\u20131880 between matron Margaret Burt\nand hospital medical staff highlighted how doctors sometimes felt that their\nauthority was being challenged by these new style Nightingale matrons. This\nwas not an isolated episode and other matrons experienced similar issues, such\nas Eva Luckes.^[53]\n\nFlorence Nightingale (middle) in 1886 with her graduating class of nurses from\nSt Thomas' outside Claydon House, Buckinghamshire\n\nIn the 1870s, Nightingale mentored Linda Richards, \"America's first trained\nnurse\", and enabled her to return to the United States with adequate training\nand knowledge to establish high-quality nursing schools.^[54] Richards went on\nto become a nursing pioneer in the US and Japan.^[55]\n\nBy 1882, several Nightingale nurses had become matrons at several leading\nhospitals, including, in London (St Mary's Hospital, Westminster Hospital, St\nMarylebone Workhouse Infirmary and the Hospital for Incurables at Putney) and\nthroughout Britain (Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley; Edinburgh Royal\nInfirmary; Cumberland Infirmary and Liverpool Royal Infirmary), as well as at\nSydney Hospital in New South Wales, Australia.^[56]\n\nIn 1883, Nightingale became the first recipient of the Royal Red Cross. In\n1904, she was appointed a Lady of Grace of the Order of St John (LGStJ).^[57]\n\nIn 1907, she became the first woman to be awarded the Order of Merit.^[58] In\nthe following year she was given the Honorary Freedom of the City of London.\nHer birthday is now celebrated as International May 12th Awareness Day.^[59]\n\nFrom 1857 onwards, Nightingale was intermittently bedridden and suffered from\ndepression. A recent biography cites brucellosis and associated spondylitis as\nthe cause.^[60] Most authorities today accept that Nightingale suffered from a\nparticularly extreme form of brucellosis, the effects of which only began to\nlift in the early 1880s. Despite her symptoms, she remained phenomenally\nproductive in social reform. During her bedridden years, she also did\npioneering work in the field of hospital planning, and her work propagated\nquickly across Britain and the world. Nightingale's output slowed down\nconsiderably in her last decade. She wrote very little during that period due\nto blindness and declining mental abilities, though she still retained an\ninterest in current affairs.^[12]\n\n## Relationships\n\nFlorence Nightingale by Charles Staal, engraved by G. H. Mote, used in Mary\nCowden Clarke's Florence Nightingale (1857)\n\nAlthough much of Nightingale's work improved the lot of women everywhere,\nNightingale believed that women craved sympathy and were not as capable as\nmen.^[a] She criticised early women's rights activists for decrying an alleged\nlack of careers for women at the same time that lucrative medical positions,\nunder the supervision of Nightingale and others, went perpetually\nunfilled.^[b] She preferred the friendship of powerful men, insisting they had\ndone more than women to help her attain her goals, writing: \"I have never\nfound one woman who has altered her life by one iota for me or my\nopinions.\"^[63]^[64] She often referred to herself as, for example, \"a man of\naction\" and \"a man of business\".^[65]\n\nHowever, she did have several important and long-lasting friendships with\nwomen. Later in life, she kept up a prolonged correspondence with Irish nun\nMary Clare Moore, with whom she had worked in Crimea.^[66] Her most beloved\nconfidante was Mary Clarke, an Englishwoman she met in Paris in 1837 and kept\nin touch with throughout her life.^[67]\n\nSome scholars of Nightingale's life believe that she remained chaste for her\nentire life, perhaps because she felt a religious calling to her career.^[68]\n\n## Death\n\nThe grave of Florence Nightingale in the churchyard of St Margaret's Church,\nEast Wellow, HampshireIn 1939 Belgium issued a semi-postal stamp in honour of\nNightingale in recognition of her work with the Red Cross when in Belgium\n\nFlorence Nightingale died peacefully in her sleep in her room at 10 South\nStreet, Mayfair, London, on 13 August 1910, at the age of 90.^[69]^[c] The\noffer of burial in Westminster Abbey was declined by her relatives and she is\nburied in the churchyard of St Margaret's Church in East Wellow, Hampshire,\nnear Embley Park with a memorial with just her initials and dates of birth and\ndeath.^[71]^[72] She left a large body of work, including several hundred\nnotes that were previously unpublished.^[73] A memorial monument to\nNightingale was created in Carrara marble by Francis William Sargant in 1913\nand placed in the cloister of the Basilica of Santa Croce, in Florence,\nItaly.^[74]\n\n## Contributions\n\n### Statistics and sanitary reform\n\nFlorence Nightingale exhibited a gift for mathematics from an early age and\nexcelled in the subject under the tutelage of her father.^[d] Later,\nNightingale became a pioneer in the visual presentation of information and\nstatistical graphics.^[76] She used methods such as the pie chart, which had\nfirst been developed by William Playfair in 1801.^[77] While taken for granted\nnow, it was at the time a relatively novel method of presenting data.^[78]\n\nIndeed, Nightingale is described as \"a true pioneer in the graphical\nrepresentation of statistics\" and is especially well known for her usage of a\npolar area diagram,^[78]^: 107 or occasionally the Nightingale rose diagram,\nequivalent to a modern circular histogram, to illustrate seasonal sources of\npatient mortality in the military field hospital she managed. While frequently\ncredited as the creator of the polar area diagram, it is known to have been\nused by Andr\u00e9-Michel Guerry in 1829^[79] and L\u00e9on Louis Lalanne by 1830.^[80]\nNightingale called a compilation of such diagrams a \"coxcomb\", but later that\nterm would frequently be used for the individual diagrams.^[81] She made\nextensive use of coxcombs to present reports on the nature and magnitude of\nthe conditions of medical care in the Crimean War to Members of Parliament and\ncivil servants who would have been unlikely to read or understand traditional\nstatistical reports. In 1859, Nightingale was elected the first female member\nof the Royal Statistical Society.^[82] In 1874 she became an honorary member\nof the American Statistical Association.^[83]\n\n\"Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East\" by Florence\nNightingale\n\nHer attention turned to the health of the British Army in India and she\ndemonstrated that bad drainage, contaminated water, overcrowding, and poor\nventilation were causing the high death rate.^[84] Following the report The\nRoyal Commission on India (1858\u20131863), which included drawings done by her\ncousin, artist Hilary Bonham Carter, with whom Nightingale had lived,^[e]\nNightingale concluded that the health of the army and the people of India had\nto go hand in hand and so campaigned to improve the sanitary conditions of the\ncountry as a whole.^[7]\n\nNightingale made a comprehensive statistical study of sanitation in Indian\nrural life and was the leading figure in the introduction of improved medical\ncare and public health service in India. In 1858 and 1859, she successfully\nlobbied for the establishment of a Royal Commission into the Indian situation.\nTwo years later, she provided a report to the commission, which completed its\nown study in 1863. \"After 10 years of sanitary reform, in 1873, Nightingale\nreported that mortality among the soldiers in India had declined from 69 to 18\nper 1,000\".^[78]^: 107\n\nThe Royal Sanitary Commission of 1868\u20131869 presented Nightingale with an\nopportunity to press for compulsory sanitation in private houses. She lobbied\nthe minister responsible, James Stansfeld, to strengthen the proposed Public\nHealth Bill to require owners of existing properties to pay for connection to\nmains drainage.^[86] The strengthened legislation was enacted in the Public\nHealth Acts of 1874 and 1875. At the same time, she combined with the retired\nsanitary reformer Edwin Chadwick to persuade Stansfeld to devolve powers to\nenforce the law to Local Authorities, eliminating central control by medical\ntechnocrats.^[87] Her Crimean War statistics had convinced her that non-\nmedical approaches were more effective given the state of knowledge at the\ntime. Historians now believe that both drainage and devolved enforcement\nplayed a crucial role in increasing average national life expectancy by 20\nyears between 1871 and the mid-1930s during which time medical science made no\nimpact on the most fatal epidemic diseases.^[30]^[31]^[88]\n\n### Literature and the women's movement\n\nHistorian of science I. Bernard Cohen argues:\n\n> Nightingale's achievements are all the more impressive when they are\n> considered against the background of social restraints on women in Victorian\n> England. Her father, William Edward Nightingale, was an extremely wealthy\n> landowner, and the family moved in the highest circles of English society.\n> In those days, women of Nightingale's class did not attend universities and\n> did not pursue professional careers; their purpose in life was to marry and\n> bear children. Nightingale was fortunate. Her father believed women should\n> be educated, and he personally taught her Italian, Latin, Greek, philosophy,\n> history, and \u2013 most unusual of all for women of the time \u2013 writing and\n> mathematics.^[78]^: 98\n\nLytton Strachey was famous for his book debunking 19th-century heroes, Eminent\nVictorians (1918). Nightingale gets a full chapter, but instead of debunking\nher, Strachey praised her in a way that raised her national reputation and\nmade her an icon for English feminists of the 1920s and 1930s.^[89]\n\nWhile better known for her contributions in the nursing and mathematical\nfields, Nightingale is also an important link in the study of English\nfeminism. She wrote some 200 books, pamphlets and articles throughout her\nlife.^[50] During 1850 and 1852, she was struggling with her self-definition\nand the expectations of an upper-class marriage from her family. As she sorted\nout her thoughts, she wrote Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after\nReligious Truth. This was an 829-page, three-volume work, which Nightingale\nhad printed privately in 1860, but which until recently was never published in\nits entirety.^[90] An effort to correct this was made with a 2008 publication\nby Wilfrid Laurier University, as volume 11^[91] of a 16 volume project, the\nCollected Works of Florence Nightingale.^[92] The best known of these essays,\ncalled \"Cassandra\", was previously published by Ray Strachey in 1928. Strachey\nincluded it in The Cause, a history of the women's movement. Apparently, the\nwriting served its original purpose of sorting out thoughts; Nightingale left\nsoon after to train at the Institute for deaconesses at Kaiserswerth.\n\n\"Cassandra\" protests the over-feminisation of women into near helplessness,\nsuch as Nightingale saw in her mother's and older sister's lethargic\nlifestyle, despite their education. She rejected their life of thoughtless\ncomfort for the world of social service. The work also reflects her fear of\nher ideas being ineffective, as were Cassandra's. Cassandra was a princess of\nTroy who served as a priestess in the temple of Apollo during the Trojan War.\nThe god gave her the gift of prophecy; when she refused his advances, he\ncursed her so that her prophetic warnings would go unheeded. Elaine Showalter\ncalled Nightingale's writing \"a major text of English feminism, a link between\nWollstonecraft and Woolf\".^[93] Nightingale was initially reluctant to join\nthe Women's Suffrage Society when asked by John Stuart Mill, but through\nJosephine Butler was convinced 'that women's enfranchisement is absolutely\nessential to a nation if moral and social progress is to be made'.^[94]\n\nIn 1972, the poet Eleanor Ross Taylor wrote \"Welcome Eumenides\", a poem\nwritten in Nightingale's voice and quoting frequently from Nightingale's\nwritings.^[95] Adrienne Rich wrote that \"Eleanor Taylor has brought together\nthe waste of women in society and the waste of men in wars and twisted them\ninseparably.\"^[96]\n\n### Theology\n\nDespite being named as a Unitarian in several older sources, Nightingale's own\nrare references to conventional Unitarianism are mildly negative. She remained\nin the Church of England throughout her life, albeit with unorthodox views.\nInfluenced from an early age by the Wesleyan tradition,^[f] Nightingale felt\nthat genuine religion should manifest in active care and love for others.^[g]\nShe wrote a work of theology: Suggestions for Thought, her own theodicy, which\ndevelops her heterodox ideas. Nightingale questioned the goodness of a God who\nwould condemn souls to hell and was a believer in universal reconciliation \u2013\nthe concept that even those who die without being saved will eventually make\nit to heaven.^[h] She would sometimes comfort those in her care with this\nview. For example, a dying young prostitute being tended by Nightingale was\nconcerned she was going to hell and said to her \"Pray God, that you may never\nbe in the despair I am in at this time\". The nurse replied \"Oh, my girl, are\nyou not now more merciful than the God you think you are going to? Yet the\nreal God is far more merciful than any human creature ever was or can ever\nimagine.\"^[11]^[64]^[i]^[j]\n\nDespite her intense personal devotion to Christ, Nightingale believed for much\nof her life that the pagan and eastern religions had also contained genuine\nrevelation. She was a strong opponent of discrimination both against\nChristians of different denominations and against those of non-Christian\nreligions. Nightingale believed religion helped provide people with the\nfortitude for arduous good work and would ensure the nurses in her care\nattended religious services. However, she was often critical of organised\nreligion. She disliked the role the 19th century Church of England would\nsometimes play in worsening the oppression of the poor. Nightingale argued\nthat secular hospitals usually provided better care than their religious\ncounterparts. While she held that the ideal health professional should be\ninspired by a religious as well as professional motive, she said that in\npractice many religiously motivated health workers were concerned chiefly in\nsecuring their own salvation and that this motivation was inferior to the\nprofessional desire to deliver the best possible care.^[11]^[64]\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Nursing\n\nSee also: Elizabeth Christophers Hobson\n\nBlue plaque for Nightingale in South Street, Mayfair, London\n\nNightingale's lasting contribution has been her role in founding the modern\nnursing profession.^[100] She set an example of compassion, commitment to\npatient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration. The first\nofficial nurses' training programme, her Nightingale School for Nurses, opened\nin 1860 and is now called the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and\nMidwifery at King's College London.^[101]\n\n> She belongs to that select band of historical characters who are instantly\n> recognisable: the Lady with the Lamp, ministering to the wounded and dying.\n\n\u2013 BBC profile of Nightingale.^[7]\n\nIn 1912, the International Committee of the Red Cross instituted the Florence\nNightingale Medal, which is awarded every two years to nurses or nursing aides\nfor outstanding service.^[102] It is the highest international distinction a\nnurse can achieve and is awarded to nurses or nursing aides for \"exceptional\ncourage and devotion to the wounded, sick or disabled or to civilian victims\nof a conflict or disaster\" or \"exemplary services or a creative and pioneering\nspirit in the areas of public health or nursing education\".^[103] Since 1965,\nInternational Nurses Day has been celebrated on her birthday (12 May) each\nyear.^[104] The President of India honours nursing professionals with the\n\"National Florence Nightingale Award\" every year on International Nurses\nDay.^[105] The award, established in 1973, is given in recognition of\nmeritorious services of nursing professionals characterised by devotion,\nsincerity, dedication and compassion.^[105]\n\nThe Nightingale Pledge\n\nThe Nightingale Pledge is a modified version of the Hippocratic Oath which\nnurses in the United States recite at their pinning ceremony at the end of\ntraining. Created in 1893 and named after Nightingale as the founder of modern\nnursing, the pledge is a statement of the ethics and principles of the nursing\nprofession.^[106]\n\nThe Florence Nightingale Declaration Campaign,^[107] established by nursing\nleaders throughout the world through the Nightingale Initiative for Global\nHealth (NIGH), aims to build a global grassroots movement to achieve two\nUnited Nations Resolutions for adoption by the UN General Assembly of 2008.\nThey will declare: The International Year of the Nurse\u20132010 (the centenary of\nNightingale's death); The UN Decade for a Healthy World \u2013 2011 to 2020 (the\nbicentenary of Nightingale's birth). NIGH also works to rekindle awareness\nabout the important issues highlighted by Florence Nightingale, such as\npreventive medicine and holistic health. As of 2016, the Florence Nightingale\nDeclaration has been signed by over 25,000 signatories from 106\ncountries.^[108]\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Nightingale inspired many US Army nurses, sparking a\nrenewal of interest in her life and work. Her admirers include Country Joe of\nCountry Joe and the Fish, who has assembled an extensive website in her\nhonour.^[109] The Agostino Gemelli Medical School^[110] in Rome, the first\nuniversity-based hospital in Italy and one of its most respected medical\ncentres, honoured Nightingale's contribution to the nursing profession by\ngiving the name \"Bedside Florence\" to a wireless computer system it developed\nto assist nursing.^[111]\n\n### Hospitals\n\nFour hospitals in Istanbul are named after Nightingale: Florence Nightingale\nHospital in \u015ei\u015fli (the biggest private hospital in Turkey), Metropolitan\nFlorence Nightingale Hospital in Gayrettepe, European Florence Nightingale\nHospital in Mecidiyek\u00f6y, and K\u0131z\u0131ltoprak Florence Nightingale Hospital in\nKad\u0131k\u00f6y, all belonging to the Turkish Cardiology Foundation.^[112]\n\nIn 2011, an appeal was made for the former Derbyshire Royal Infirmary hospital\nin Derby, England to be named after Nightingale. It was suggested the name\ncould be either Nightingale Community Hospital or Florence Nightingale\nCommunity Hospital. The area where the hospital is situated is sometimes\nreferred to as the \"Nightingale Quarter\".^[113]\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of temporary NHS Nightingale Hospitals\nwere set up in readiness for an expected rise in the number of patients\nneeding critical care. The first was housed in the ExCeL London^[114] and\nseveral others followed across England.^[115] Celebrations to mark her\nbicentenary in 2020, were disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic and\nNightingale's contribution to scientific and statistical analysis of\ninfectious disease and nursing practice may have led to the new temporary\nhospitals being in her name, in Scotland named the NHS Louisa Jordan after a\nnurse who followed in Nightingale's footsteps in battlefield nursing in World\nWar One.^[116]\n\n### Museums and monuments\n\nStatue of Nightingale by Arthur George Walker in Waterloo Place,\nLondonFlorence Nightingale Statue, London Road, DerbyFlorence Nightingale\nstained glass window, originally at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary Chapel and\nnow removed to St Peter's Church, Derby and rededicated 9 October 2010\n\nA statue of Florence Nightingale by the 20th-century war memorialist Arthur\nGeorge Walker stands in Waterloo Place, Westminster, London, just off The\nMall. There are three statues of Nightingale in Derby \u2013 one outside the\nDerbyshire Royal Infirmary (DRI), one in St Peter's Street, and one above the\nNightingale-Macmillan Continuing Care Unit opposite the Derbyshire Royal\nInfirmary. A pub named after her stands close to the DRI.^[117] The\nNightingale-Macmillan continuing care unit is now at the Royal Derby Hospital,\nformerly known as The City Hospital, Derby.^[118]\n\nA stained glass window was commissioned for inclusion in the DRI chapel in the\nlate 1950s. When the chapel was demolished the window was removed and\ninstalled in the replacement chapel. At the closure of the DRI, the window was\nagain removed and stored. In October 2010, \u00a36,000 was raised to reposition the\nwindow in St Peter's Church, Derby. The work features nine panels, of the\noriginal ten, depicting scenes of hospital life, Derby townscapes, and\nNightingale herself. Some of the work was damaged and the tenth panel was\ndismantled for the glass to be used in the repair of the remaining panels. All\nthe figures, who are said to be modelled on prominent Derby town figures of\nthe early sixties, surround and praise a central pane of the triumphant\nChrist. A nurse who posed for the top right panel in 1959 attended the\nrededication service in October 2010.^[119]\n\nThe Florence Nightingale Museum at St Thomas' Hospital in London reopened in\nMay 2010 in time for the centenary of Nightingale's death.^[50] Another museum\ndevoted to her is at her sister's family home, Claydon House, now a property\nof the National Trust.^[120]^[121]\n\nUpon the centenary of Nightingale's death in 2010, and to commemorate her\nconnection with Malvern, the Malvern Museum held a Florence Nightingale\nexhibit^[122] with a school poster competition to promote some events.^[123]\n\nIn Istanbul, the northernmost tower of the Selimiye Barracks building is now\nthe Florence Nightingale Museum.^[124] and in several of its rooms, relics and\nreproductions related to Florence Nightingale and her nurses are on\nexhibition.^[125]\n\nWhen Nightingale moved on to the Crimea itself in May 1855, she often\ntravelled on horseback to make hospital inspections. She later transferred to\na mule cart and was reported to have escaped serious injury when the cart was\ntoppled in an accident. Following this, she used a solid Russian-built black\ncarriage, with a waterproof hood and curtains. The carriage was returned to\nEngland by Alexis Soyer after the war and subsequently given to the\nNightingale training school. The carriage was damaged when the hospital was\nbombed during the Second World War. It was restored and transferred to Claydon\nHouse and is now displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum in Mytchett,\nSurrey, near Aldershot.^[126]\n\nBust of Nightingale unveiled at Gun Hill Park in Aldershot in 2021\n\nA bronze plaque, attached to the plinth of the Crimean Memorial in the\nHaydarpa\u015fa Cemetery, Istanbul, Turkey and unveiled on Empire Day, 1954, to\ncelebrate the 100th anniversary of her nursing service in that region, bears\nthe inscription: \"To Florence Nightingale, whose work near this Cemetery a\ncentury ago relieved much human suffering and laid the foundations for the\nnursing profession.\"^[127] Other monuments of Nightingale include a statue at\nChiba University in Japan, a bust at Tarlac State University in the\nPhilippines, and a bust at Gun Hill Park in Aldershot in the UK. Other nursing\nschools around the world are named after Nightingale, such as in An\u00e1polis in\nBrazil.^[128]\n\n### Audio\n\nFlorence Nightingale's voice was saved for posterity in a phonograph recording\nfrom 1890 preserved in the British Library Sound Archive. The recording, made\nin aid of the Light Brigade Relief Fund and available to hear online, says:\n\n> When I am no longer even a memory, just a name, I hope my voice may\n> perpetuate the great work of my life. God bless my dear old comrades of\n> Balaclava and bring them safe to shore. Florence Nightingale.^[129]\n\n### Theatre\n\nThe first theatrical representation of Nightingale was Reginald Berkeley's The\nLady with the Lamp, premiering in London in 1929 with Edith Evans in the title\nrole. It did not portray her as an entirely sympathetic character and draws\nmuch characterisation from Lytton Strachey's biography of her in Eminent\nVictorians.^[130] It was adapted as a film of the same name in 1951. In 2009,\na stage musical play representation of Nightingale entitled The Voyage of the\nLass was produced by the Association of Nursing Service Administrators of the\nPhilippines.\n\n### Film\n\nIn 1912, a biographical silent film titled The Victoria Cross, starring Julia\nSwayne Gordon as Nightingale, was released, followed in 1915 by another silent\nfilm, Florence Nightingale, featuring Elisabeth Risdon. In 1936, Kay Francis\nplayed Nightingale in the film titled The White Angel. In 1951, The Lady with\na Lamp starred Anna Neagle.^[131] In 1993, Nest Entertainment released an\nanimated film Florence Nightingale, describing her service as a nurse in the\nCrimean War.^[132]\n\n### Television\n\nPortrayals of Nightingale on television, in documentary as in fiction, vary \u2013\nthe BBC's 2008 Florence Nightingale, featuring Laura Fraser,^[133] emphasised\nher independence and feeling of religious calling, but in Channel 4's 2006\nMary Seacole: The Real Angel of the Crimea, she is portrayed as narrow-minded\nand opposed to Seacole's efforts.^[134]\n\nOther portrayals include:\n\n  * Laura Morgan in Victoria episode #3.4 \"Foreign Bodies\" (2018)^[135]\n  * Kate Isitt in the Magic Grandad episode \"Famous People: Florence Nightingale\" (1994)^[136]\n  * Jaclyn Smith in the TV biopic Florence Nightingale (1985)^[137]\n  * Emma Thompson in the ITV sketch comedy series Alfresco episode #1.2 (1983)^[138]\n  * Jayne Meadows in PBS series Meeting of Minds (1978)^[139]\n  * Janet Suzman in the British theatre-style biopic Miss Nightingale (1974)^[140]\n  * Julie Harris in Hallmark Hall of Fame episode #14.4 \"The Holy Terror\" (1965)^[141]\n  * Sarah Churchill in Hallmark Hall of Fame episode #1.6 \"Florence Nightingale\" (1952)^[142]\n\n### Banknotes\n\nFlorence Nightingale's image appeared on the reverse of \u00a310 Series D banknotes\nissued by the Bank of England from 1975 until 1994. As well as a standing\nportrait, she was depicted on the notes in a field hospital, holding her\nlamp.^[143] Nightingale's note was in circulation alongside the images of\nIsaac Newton, William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Michael Faraday, Sir\nChristopher Wren, the Duke of Wellington and George Stephenson, and prior to\n2002, other than the female monarchs, she was the only woman whose image had\never adorned British paper currency.^[7]\n\n### Photographs\n\nNightingale had a principled objection to having photographs taken or her\nportrait painted. An extremely rare photograph of her, taken at Embley on a\nvisit to her family home in May 1858, was discovered in 2006 and is now at the\nFlorence Nightingale Museum in London. A black-and-white photograph taken in\nabout 1907 by Lizzie Caswall Smith at Nightingale's London home in South\nStreet, Mayfair, was auctioned on 19 November 2008 by Dreweatts auction house\nin Newbury, Berkshire, England, for \u00a35,500.^[144]\n\n### Biographies\n\nThe first biography of Nightingale was published in England in 1855. In 1911,\nEdward Tyas Cook was authorised by Nightingale's executors to write the\nofficial life, published in two volumes in 1913. Nightingale was also the\nsubject of one of Lytton Strachey's four mercilessly provocative biographical\nessays, Eminent Victorians. Strachey regarded Nightingale as an intense,\ndriven woman who was both personally intolerable and admirable in her\nachievements.^[145]\n\nCecil Woodham-Smith, like Strachey, relied heavily on Cook's Life in her 1950\nbiography, though she did have access to new family material preserved at\nClaydon. In 2008, Mark Bostridge published a major new life of Nightingale,\nalmost exclusively based on unpublished material from the Verney Collections\nat Claydon and from archival documents from about 200 archives around the\nworld, some of which had been published by Lynn McDonald in her projected\nsixteen-volume edition of the Collected Works of Florence Nightingale (2001 to\ndate).^[7]\n\n### Other\n\nKLM MD-11, registration PH-KCD, Florence Nightingale\n\nIn 2002, Nightingale was ranked number 52 in the BBC's list of the 100\nGreatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.

Beginning in 1968, the US Air Force operated a fleet of 20 C-9A\n\"Nightingale\" aeromedical evacuation aircraft, based on the McDonnell Douglas\nDC-9 platform.^[151] The last of these planes was retired from service in\n2005.^[152]\n\nIn 1981, the asteroid 3122 Florence was named after her.^[153] A Dutch KLM\nMcDonnell-Douglas MD-11 (registration PH-KCD) was also named in her honour; it\nserved the airline for 20 years, from 1994 to 2014.^[154]^[155] Nightingale\nhas appeared on international postage stamps, including, the UK, Alderney,\nAustralia, Belgium, Dominica, Hungary (showing the Florence Nightingale medal\nawarded by the International Red Cross), and Germany.^[156]\n\nFlorence Nightingale is remembered in the Church of England with a\ncommemoration on 13 August.^[157] Celebrations to mark her bicentenary in\n2020, were disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, but the NHS Nightingale\nhospitals were named after her.^[116] Nightingale Road (Chinese: \u5357\u4e01\u683c\u723e\u8def) in\nHong Kong, between the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the nursing school, was\nofficially named by the Lands Department after Florence Nightingale in\n2008.^[158]\n\n## Gallery\n\n  * A tinted lithograph by William Simpson illustrating evacuation of the sick and injured from Balaklava\n\n  * Picture of Nightingale in The Illustrated London News, 24 February 1855\n\n  * A ward of the hospital at Scutari where Nightingale worked, from an 1856 lithograph by William Simpson\n\n  * Nightingale's moccasins that she wore in the Crimean War (the other items are not hers)\n\n  * Florence Nightingale exhibit at Malvern Museum, England, 2010\n\n  * Nightingale's medals displayed in the National Army Museum\n\n  * Memorial to Nightingale, Church of Santa Croce, Florence, Italy\n\n## Works\n\n  * Nightingale, Florence (1979).

Women crave for being loved, not for loving. They scream out at you for sympathy all day long, they are incapable of giving any in return, for they cannot remember your affairs long enough to do so. ... They cannot state a fact accurately to another, nor can that other attend to it accurately enough for it to become information.\"^[61]\n  2. ^ In the same 1861 letter she wrote, \"It makes me mad, the Women's Rights talk about 'the want of a field' for them \u2013 when I would gladly give \u00a3500 a year for a Woman secretary. And two English Lady superintendents have told me the same thing. And we can't get one ...\"^[62]\n  3. ^ Florence Nightingale, the famous nurse of the Crimean war and the only woman who ever received the Order of Merit, died yesterday afternoon at her London home. Although she had been an invalid for a long time, rarely leaving her room, where she passed the time in a half-recumbent position and was under the constant care of a physician, her death was somewhat unexpected. A week ago she was quite sick, but then improved and on Friday was cheerful. During that night alarming symptoms developed and she gradually sank until 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon, when the end came. \u2014 New York Times (15 Aug 1910)^[70]\n  4. ^ There were rumours that she was tutored by an eminent mathematician who was a friend of the family. Mark Bostridge says, \"There appears to be no documentary evidence to connect Florence with J. J. Sylvester.\"^[75]\n  5. ^ [many letters were written by Nightingale to her cousin Hilary Bonham-Carter] ... Royal Commission on India (1858\u20131863) ... feeling that her cousin was neglecting her art, [Nightingale] made Hilary Bonham Carter leave ... the Indian embroidery belonged to dear Hilary ...^[85]\n  6. ^ Her parents took their daughters to both Church of England and Methodist churches.^[citation needed]\n  7. ^ Nightingale's rare references to Unitarianism are mildly negative, and while her religious views were heterodox, she remained in the Church of England throughout her life. Her biblical annotations, private journal notes, and translations of the mystics give quite a different impression of her beliefs, and these do have a bearing on her work with nurses, and not only at Edinburgh, but neither [Cecil(ia) Woodham-]Smith nor [her] followers consulted their sources.\"^[97]\n  8. ^ While this has changed by the 21st century, universal reconciliation was very far from being mainstream in the Church of England at the time.\n  9. ^ \"Certainly the worst man would hardly torture his enemy, if he could, forever. Unless God has a scheme that every man is to be saved forever, it is hard to say in what He is not worse than man. For all good men would save others if they could.\"^[98]\n  10. ^ Although not formally a Universalist by church membership, she had come of a Universalist family, was sympathetic to the tenets of the denomination, and has always been claimed by it.^[99]\n\n## Citations\n\n  1. ^ \"Florence Nightingale\".
