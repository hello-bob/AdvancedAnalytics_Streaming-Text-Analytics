The game is available as a single HTML page that runs in a web browser.\nIt presents a page with a randomly chosen background colour. The player then\nneeds to guess the three RGB hexademical digits that make the given background\ncolour. See github.com/susam/myrgb for more information about this game.\n\nI wrote this game last Saturday afternoon and shared it on my website at\nmyrgb.html later in the evening. I had no intention of sharing this with a\nwide audience yet because I had not had sufficient time testing it well. But\nsomehow a Hacker News (HN) user named talonx discovered this game on Sunday\nmorning and shared it on HN in this post:\nnews.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882018.\n\nSince I had not shared this game with anyone anywhere yet, I was quite\nsurprised to wake up Sunday morning and find my game trending at the top of\nHN. I believe this is where maintaining an RSS feed on my website might have\nhelped. Every new page that I publish on this website also appears as an entry\nin the RSS feed for this website. This feed can be found here: feed.xml. I\nhave a couple of hundred subscribers to this feed. It is very likely that the\nHN user who shared this game on HN found it through this feed.\n\nEver since this game was shared on HN, my website has received a large number\nof hits. In the last three days (excluding today), this game has received a\ntotal of 166102 hits. The actual numbers for each day look like this:\n\nDate| Hits  \n---|---  \n31 Mar 2024| 95467  \n01 Mar 2024| 48330  \n02 Mar 2024| 22305  \n  \nTo all visitors of this website who played this game and shared this game with\nothers, thank you! Crafting tiny software tools like this is a creative outlet\nfor me. To know that there are others out there who enjoyed this game brings\nme joy!\n\nTo play this game, go to myrgb.html now and guess some colours!\n\n\u00a9 2001\u20132024 Susam Pal\n\n", "frontpage": false}
