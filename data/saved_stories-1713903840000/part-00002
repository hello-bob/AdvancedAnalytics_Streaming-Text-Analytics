They\nsaid the snake, which they named Vasuki indicus, would have looked like a\nlarge python and would not have been venomous.\n\nThe lignite mine where the fossil was found is located in Panandhro, in the\nwestern state of Gujarat.\n\n\u201cConsidering its large size, Vasuki was a slow-moving ambush predator that\nwould subdue its prey through constriction like anacondas and pythons. This\nsnake lived in a marshy swamp near the coast at a time when global\ntemperatures were higher than today,\u201d said Debajit Datta, a postdoctoral\nresearcher in palaeontology at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee and\nthe lead author of the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports on\nThursday.\n\nThe Panandhro lignite mine in Gujarat where the remains of the prehistoric\nsnake, Vasuki indicus, were found.

Titanoboa,\nestimated at 13 metres long and more than 1 tonne, lived between 58m and 60m\nyears ago. The largest living snake today is Asia\u2019s reticulated python at 10\nmetres.\n\n\u201cThe estimated body length of Vasuki is comparable to that of Titanoboa,\nalthough the vertebrae of Titanoboa are slightly larger than those of Vasuki.\nHowever, at this point, we cannot say if Vasuki was more massive or slender\ncompared to Titanoboa,\u201d said Sunil Bajpai, a palaeontologist, professor at\nRoorkee and the study\u2019s co-author.\n\nThese huge snakes lived during the Cenozoic era, which began after the\ndinosaur age ended 66m years ago.\n\nThe biggest Vasuki vertebra was about 11cm (4in) wide. Vasuki appears to have\nhad a broad, cylindrical body perhaps around 44cm wide. The skull was not\nfound.\n\n\u201cVasuki was a majestic animal,\u201d Datta said. \u201cIt may well have been a gentle\ngiant, resting its head on a high porch formed by coiling its massive body for\nmost parts of the day or moving sluggishly through the swamp like an endless\ntrain.\u201d\n\nFossils found in Somerset by girl, 11, \u2018may be of largest-ever marine reptile\u2019\n\nRead more\n\nThe researchers are unsure what prey Vasuki ate, but considering its size it\ncould have included crocodilians. Other fossils found in the area included\ncrocodilians and turtles, as well as fish and two primitive whales,\nKutchicetus and Andrewsiphius.\n\nVasuki was a member of the madtsoiidae snake family that appeared roughly 90m\nyears ago but went extinct about 12,000 years ago. These snakes spread from\nIndia through southern Eurasia and into north Africa after the Indian\nsubcontinent collided with Eurasia about 50m years ago, Bajpai said.\n\nThis was a dominant snake family during the dinosaur age\u2019s late stages and\ninto the early Cenozoic before its diversity dropped, he added.\n\n\u201cSnakes are amazing creatures that often leave us stunned because of their\nsize, agility and deadliness,\u201d Datta said. \u201cPeople are scared of them as some\nsnakes are venomous and have a fatal bite. But snakes perhaps attack people\nout of fear rather than with an intent to attack. I believe snakes, like most\nanimals, are peaceful creatures, and an important component of our ecosystem.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Snakes\n  * Fossils\n  * Animals\n  * India\n  * Wildlife\n  * South and central Asia\n  * Evolution\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
