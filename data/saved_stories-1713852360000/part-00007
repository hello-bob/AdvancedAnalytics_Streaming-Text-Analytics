Statistics\n  * Quorum\n  * Majority Requirement\n  * Outcome\n\n### Time Line\n\nNomination period:| Saturday 2024-03-09 00:00:00 UTC| Friday 2024-03-15\n23:59:59 UTC  \n---|---|---  \nCampaigning period:| Saturday 2024-03-16 00:00:00 UTC| Friday 2024-04-05\n23:59:59 UTC  \nVoting period:| Saturday 2024-04-06 00:00:00 UTC| Friday 2024-04-19 23:59:59\nUTC  \n  \nPlease note that the new term for the project leader shall start on\n2024-04-21.\n\n### Nominations\n\n  1. Andreas Tille [tille@debian.org] [nomination mail] [platform]\n  2. Sruthi Chandran [srud@debian.org] [nomination mail] [platform]\n\nThe ballot, when ready, can be requested through email by sending a signed\nemail to ballot@vote.debian.org with the subject leader2024.\n\n### Data and Statistics\n\nThis year, like always, statistics will be gathered about ballots received and\nacknowledgements sent periodically during the voting period. Additionally, the\nlist of voters will be recorded. Also, the tally sheet will also be made\navailable to be viewed. Please remember that the project leader election has a\nsecret ballot, so the tally sheet will not contain the voter's name but a HMAC\nthat allows the voters to check that their vote is in the list of votes. There\nis a key generated for each voter that is send along with the ack for the\nvote.\n\n### Quorum\n\nWith the current list of voting developers, we have:\n\n    \n    \n    Current Developer Count = 1010 Q ( sqrt(#devel) / 2 ) = 15.8902485820707 K min(5, Q ) = 5 Quorum (3 x Q ) = 47.6707457462121\n\n### Quorum\n\n  * Option1 Reached quorum: 293 > 47.6707457462121\n  * Option2 Reached quorum: 280 > 47.6707457462121\n\n### Majority Requirement\n\nThe candidates need a simple majority to be eligible.\n\n### Majority\n\n  * Option1 passes Majority. 4.578 (293/64) > 1\n  * Option2 passes Majority. 4.242 (280/66) > 1\n\n### Outcome\n\nIn the graph above, any pink colored nodes imply that the option did not pass\nmajority, the Blue is the winner. The Octagon is used for the options that did\nnot beat the default.\n\n  * Option 1 \"Andreas Tille\"\n  * Option 2 \"Sruthi Chandran\"\n  * Option 3 \"None of the above\"\n\nIn the following table, tally[row x][col y] represents the votes that option x\nreceived over option y. A more detailed explanation of the beat matrix may\nhelp in understanding the table. For understanding the Condorcet method, the\nWikipedia entry is fairly informative.\n\nThe Beat MatrixOption  \n---  \n1| 2| 3  \nOption 1| 201| 293  \nOption 2| 135| 280  \nOption 3| 64| 66  \n  \nLooking at row 2, column 1, Sruthi Chandran received 135 votes over Andreas\nTille\n\nLooking at row 1, column 2, Andreas Tille received 201 votes over Sruthi\nChandran.\n\n### Pair-wise defeats\n\n  * Option 1 defeats Option 2 by ( 201 - 135) = 66 votes.\n  * Option 1 defeats Option 3 by ( 293 - 64) = 229 votes.\n  * Option 2 defeats Option 3 by ( 280 - 66) = 214 votes.\n\n### The Schwartz Set contains\n\n  * Option 1 \"Andreas Tille\"\n\n### The winners\n\n  * Option 1 \"Andreas Tille\"\n\nDebian uses the Condorcet method for voting. Simplistically, plain Condorcets\nmethod can be stated like so : \"Consider all possible two-way races between\ncandidates. The Condorcet winner, if there is one, is the one candidate who\ncan beat each other candidate in a two-way race with that candidate.\" The\nproblem is that in complex elections, there may well be a circular\nrelationship in which A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A. Most of the\nvariations on Condorcet use various means of resolving the tie. See Cloneproof\nSchwartz Sequential Dropping for details. Debian's variation is spelled out in\nthe constitution, specifically, A.5.\n\nDebian Project Secretary\n\nBack to the Debian Project homepage.\n\nThis page is also available in the following languages:\n\nfran\u00e7ais Nederlands Portugu\u00eas\n\nHow to set the default document language\n\nHome\n\n  * About\n\n    * Social Contract\n    * Code of Conduct\n    * Free Software\n    * Legal Info\n  * Help Debian\n\n  * Getting Debian\n\n    * Network install\n    * CD/USB ISO images\n    * Pure Blends\n    * Debian Packages\n    * Developers' Corner\n\n  * News\n\n    * Project News\n    * Events\n  * Documentation\n\n    * Release Info\n    * Debian Wiki\n\n  * Support\n\n    * Debian International\n    * Security Information\n    * Bug reports\n    * Mailing Lists\n\n  * Site map\n  * Search\n  * The Debian Blog\n  * Debian Micronews\n  * Debian Planet\n\nSee our contact page to get in touch.
