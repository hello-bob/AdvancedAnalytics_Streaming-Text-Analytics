Its value is approximately one hour, or half an hour for a one-way trip.\nIt is named after Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti, though Marchetti himself\nattributed the \"one hour\" finding to transportation analyst and engineer Yacov\nZahavi.^[1]\n\nMarchetti posits that although forms of urban planning and transport may\nchange, and although some live in villages and others in cities, people\ngradually adjust their lives to their conditions (including location of their\nhomes relative to their workplace) such that the average travel time stays\napproximately constant.^[1]^[2]^[3] Ever since Neolithic times, people have\nkept the average time spent per day for travel the same, even though the\ndistance may increase due to the advancements in the means of transportation.\nIn his 1934 book Technics and Civilization, Lewis Mumford attributes this\nobservation to Bertrand Russell:^[4]\n\n    Mr. Bertrand Russell has noted that each improvement in locomotion has increased the area over which people are compelled to move: so that a person who would have had to spend half an hour to walk to work a century ago must still spend half an hour to reach his destination, because the contrivance that would have enabled him to save time had he remained in his original situation now\u2014by driving him to a more distant residential area\u2014effectually cancels out the gain.\n\nA related concept is that of Zahavi, who also noticed that people seem to have\na constant \"travel time budget\", that is, \"a stable daily amount of time that\npeople make available for travel.\"^[5]^: 8 David Metz, former chief scientist\nat the Department of Transport, UK, cites data of average travel time in\nBritain drawn from the British National Travel Survey in support of\nMarchetti's and Zahavi's conclusions.^[5] The work casts doubt on the\ncontention that investment in infrastructure saves travel time. Instead, it\nappears from Metz's figures that people invest travel time saved in travelling\na longer distance,^[6] a particular example of Jevons paradox described by the\nLewis\u2013Mogridge position. Because of the constancy of travel times as well as\ninduced travel, Robert Cervero has argued that the World Bank and other\ninternational aid agencies evaluate transportation investment proposals in\ndeveloping and rapidly motorizing cities less on the basis of potential\ntravel-time savings and more on the accessibility benefits they confer.^[7]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Braess's paradox\n  * Urban sprawl\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Marchetti, C.
