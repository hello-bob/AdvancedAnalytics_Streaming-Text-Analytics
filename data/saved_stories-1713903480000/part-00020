In this blog post,\nwe\u2019ll explore what was so exciting about a computer that fit in your hand,\nsomething we take for granted today.\n\nThe Atari Portfolio had most of the functionality of an IBM PC while fitting\nin your hand. It was a lot of power in a small package for 1989.\n\nHandheld computers weren\u2019t exactly unheard of in 1989. But until the Atari\nPortfolio, handheld computers had been single-purpose devices. You could get\none to store your contacts, one to translate English words into another\nlanguage, a handheld dictionary / thesaurus, and even a handheld Bible.\n\nThe Portfolio broke new ground because it put a general purpose DOS PC into\nthat form factor. The Atari Portfolio wasn\u2019t quite powerful enough to\nreplicate all of the functions of all those special purpose handheld devices,\nat least not all at once. But it hinted at a time in the future when a similar\ndevice would be. In the meantime, it gave you a wide choice of software to\ncarry with you. In the meantime, a Portfolio worked well as a personal\norganizer and could run other DOS programs in a pinch, while only costing $100\nmore than a Casio personal organizer.\n\nThe rise and fall of palmtops had some echos with the rise and fall of\nnetbooks between 2007 and 2013. It didn\u2019t replace your regular PC, but it\nfacilitated taking some of your work with you on the go.\n\nAnd this wasn\u2019t necessarily as radical of a departure for Atari as it might\nfirst seem. Atari had sold PCs before. And Jack Tramiel and his sons had\nplenty of experience selling handheld calculators in the 1970s.\n\n## Misconceptions about the Atari Portfolio\n\nLet\u2019s get a few misconceptions about the Atari Portfolio out of the way.\nBecause there are a few misconceptions about it, even though the machine\nrightfully deserves a place in history.\n\n### Atari didn\u2019t invent it\n\nFrequently, people credit Atari with inventing the product category. This\nisn\u2019t exactly true. Atari licensed the technology from a British company\ncalled Distributed Information Processing (DIP) Research, a company made up of\nformer Psion employees. DIP sold their own version of the same machine with\ntheir own name on it in the UK. It was the same machine as the Porftolio, so\nit\u2019s not completely unfair to say the Atari Porftolio was the first PC\ncompatible palmtop. But it\u2019s not quite right to say Atari invented it.\n\n### The Atari Portfolio fell short of 100% IBM PC compatibility\n\nSecondly, the Atari Porftolio wasn\u2019t 100% IBM PC compatible. Even Computer\nChronicles got this wrong in its Oct 25, 1990 episode, which was dedicated to\npalmtops. Guest host Douglas Nichols said it could run any MS-DOS program,\nwhich wasn\u2019t completely accurate. It ran a clone of MS-DOS that could run a\nlot of text based programs compatible with DOS 2.1 and even DOS 3.x, but its\nOS was a potential source of incompatibility.\n\nThe screen was another source of incompatibility. It was only 40 columns\nacross and eight lines up and down. MS-DOS programs that assumed a larger\nscreen would malfunction. So would programs that tried to use custom\ncharacters or any of the standard graphics modes. It was only capable of\n240\u00d764 resolution graphics.\n\nA third source of incompatibility was the memory. It came with 128k of memory.\nYou had to partition that memory between running programs and storage. By\ndefault, it used 32k for storage, which left 96k available to run DOS and your\nprogram. That meant software that needed a full 128k or more probably wouldn\u2019t\nrun on the Portfolio.\n\n## Why the Atari Portfolio succeeded\n\nI hope I don\u2019t sound like I am down on the Portfolio. It was a useful and\ngroundbreaking device. It\u2019s just that having DOS in the palm of your hand\nrequired some compromises in 1989.\n\nI would also argue it was compatible enough to be useful. It came with six\nprograms built into ROM. They included a text editor suitable for note-taking,\na spreadsheet that was capable of reading Lotus 1-2-3 files, a calculator, and\nsoftware for transferring data back to a regular full-sized PC. And since it\nworked like a regular PC, it meant someone who knew how to use a PC already\nknew how to use the Portfolio. And it meant people who could program a PC\ncould write programs for the Portfolio. As long as they considered the size of\nthe screen and the amount of available memory when they developed their\nprograms, everything they knew about programming a PC still applied.\n\nBetween the familiarity and the price, the Atari Portfolio was able to build\nup a usable ecosystem. Atari\u2019s motto in the late 1980s was power without the\nprice, and when it came to the Portfolio, they meant it. The Portfolio only\ncost $399 at introduction, later lowered to $299.\n\nFor comparisons sake, its closest competitor in 1989, the Poquet PC, cost\n$2,000. HP palmtops cost $800, but those were still two years away.\n\n## Atari Portfolio technical specifications\n\nThe Atari Portfolio used an Okidata 80c88 CPU running at 4.92 megahertz. The\n80c88 was a fully licensed version of the Intel 8088 CPU, specially\nmanufactured to use less power.\n\nNon volatile memory was still very expensive, so it used regular DRAM like any\nother PC. It took power from 3 standard AA batteries and could theoretically\nrun for about 3 weeks under light usage. It had an AC adapter plug that you\ncould use to provide backup power while you were changing the batteries or to\npower the device while you were transferring data back and forth to a PC.\n\n### Storage options\n\nAtari also sold memory cards in 32, 64, and 128 KB capacities, priced at $80,\n$130, and $200, respectively. These had a small coin cell battery like video\ngame cartridges did at the time to provide persistent storage. The Portfolio\nused the memory cards as drive A. It didn\u2019t have a provision for a floppy\ndrive. But anyone who knew how to use a regular PC at the time would associate\nthe A drive with removable storage, so that wasn\u2019t jarring.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a lot of removable storage, but it was enough to bring whatever you\nwere working on at the time with you.\n\n### Expansion options\n\nThe Portfolio had an expansion port that took sidecars much like the IBM PCjr\nand Texas Instruments home computer used earlier in the decade. Atari sold\nsidecars that provided 256 KB of RAM and a second port for another storage\ncard, a serial port, and a printer port. Each sidecar extended the unit\u2019s\nlength by 2.8 inches. You could plug in two memory sidecars, a serial and a\nparallel sidecar to outfit your Portfolio with 640k of RAM and ports for a\nprinter and modem. At that point, you could duplicate a desktop PC, except for\nthe size of the screen and keyboard. But the resulting computer wasn\u2019t very\nportable anymore. You ended up with a comically long train much like the train\nyou got if you plugged every available TI sidecar into your Texas Instruments\nhome computer.\n\nRealistically, most Portfolio owners could get by with just the serial or the\nparallel sidecar, since either of those would allow you to transfer data back\nto a full size PC using the built-in software. Or, if you were a power user,\nyou could get a docking station produced by XoteriX that provided rechargeable\nbatteries, serial and parallel ports, 512K of RAM, and a 20 MB hard drive for\n$899.\n\nYou could also get a device for a standard PC that allowed it to read the\nAtari memory cards. But it was usually cheaper to buy a parallel side car and\nuse the built-in data transfer software to send the data back to your PC.\nPlus, the parallel port allowed you to print directly from the Portfolio if\nyou ever needed to do that.\n\n## The Atari Portfolio\u2019s legacy\n\nDIP developed a follow-on palm top, but Atari didn\u2019t license it. Sharp did,\nand sold it as the Sharp PC-3000 and PC-3100, introduced in 1991. The PC-3000\nhad a CGA-compatible 80\u00d725 screen, a 10 MHz 80C88 CPU, 1 MB of RAM, and ran\nMS-DOS 3.3. The PC-3100 had the same specs but 2 MB of RAM.\n\nIf Atari had chosen to license the technology, they could have called it the\nMega Portfolio.\n\nThere were some changes from the Portfolio design. The PCMCIA standard was\nformalized at this point, so the Sharp palmtops used PCMCIA memory cards for\nstorage. They also had a built-in serial port to use for transferring data to\na full-sized PC. That eliminated the need for train of sidecars.\n\nThe PC-3000 cost $999 when it reached the market in 1991. I found\nadvertisements for it as late as 1994, at a price of $875.\n\nSharp palmtops don\u2019t turn up on eBay nearly as frequently as an HP 95 LX, so\nthat suggests they didn\u2019t sell as well as the HP palmtops.\n\nIn 1993, Atari discontinued the Portfolio along with each of its other\ncomputer products to concentrate solely on the Jaguar console. In retrospect,\nstaying in the PC business might have been a better idea, but you know what\nthey say about hindsight.\n\nThe HP palmtops of the 1990s were more powerful, more compatible, and\ntherefore more useful than the Portfolio. But it is completely fair to say HP\nbenefited from Atari and DIP establishing the market.\n\n### Cultural impact\n\nAnd it\u2019s fair to say the machine had some cultural impact. The Atari Portfolio\nwas the machine 10-year-old John Connor used to hack into a bank ATM in the\n1991 movie Terminator 2. And historian Benj Edwards found an image of an Atari\nPortfolio in a 1990s clipart collection.\n\nSo Atari wasn\u2019t just about video games.\n\nIf you found this post informative or helpful, please share it!\n\n  * share\n  * save\n  * share\n  * share\n  * share\n  * share\n  * pocket\n  * share\n  * email\n  * RSS feed\n\nDave Farquhar\n\nDavid Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author.\nHe started his career as a part-time computer technician in 1994, worked his\nway up to system administrator by 1997, and has specialized in vulnerability\nmanagement since 2013.
