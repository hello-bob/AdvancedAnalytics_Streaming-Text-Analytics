The disease rendered her wheelchair-bound until her death Sunday.\n\nDespite her condition, Estrada completed university studies to become a\npsychologist. She also became an activist promoting assisted suicide and\neuthanasia in Peru.\n\nAlthough those procedures are illegal in Peru, Estrada in 2021 won court\napproval to undergo euthanasia after Peru's EsSalud social security system\ndenied her request for euthanasia.\n\nPeru's Supreme Court in 2022 gave final approval for Estrada's request for\neuthanasia to end her 35 years of suffering. She had petitioned the nation's\ncourts to win approval for the procedure since 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the court rulings, EsSalud officials said Estrada wouldn't need a second\npsychological evaluation and allowed her to designate a person she trusted to\nsign a document giving consent to the euthanasia.\n\nThe manner of Estrada's death wasn't reported.\n\nCanada, Switzerland and several other nations are among those allowing\nassisted suicide in limited circumstances. So are several states in the United\nStates.\n\nGovernment officials in France in May are scheduled to debate a proposed law\nthat would legalize end-of-life care for terminally ill adults who are\nmentally competent.\n\nIf you or someone you know is suicidal, call the National Suicide Prevention\nLifeline at 988.\n\n  * Topics\n  * Law and Crime\n  * Supreme Court\n\n### Latest Headlines\n\nWorld News // 6 hours ago\n\nU.S. military joins Japan in search for missing 7 MSDF crew from helicopter\ncrash\n\nApril 23 (UPI) -- Japan's defense minister on Tuesday said the United States\nwill join search-and-rescue efforts for the seven missing Maritime Self-\nDefense Force members who crashed in two helicopters over the weekend.\n\nWorld News // 7 hours ago\n\nPhilippines orders Apple, Google to remove Binance from app stores\n\nApril 23 (UPI) -- Philippine market regulators said Tuesday they had ordered\nApple and Google to remove the apps of the virtual cryptocurrency exchange\noperator Binance from their app stores to protect investors in the country.\n\nWorld News // 10 hours ago\n\nGermany arrests aide for member of EU Parliament on suspicion of spying for\nChina\n\nApril 23 (UPI) -- German authorities on Tuesday said they arrested an employee\nof a European Parliament member on suspicion of spying for China.\n\nWorld News // 10 hours ago\n\nRishi Sunak's flagship 'Stop the Boats' bill passes, 5 killed trying to reach\nEnglish coast\n\nApril 23 (UPI) -- British lawmakers passed legislation early Tuesday allowing\nthe government to deport asylum seekers who arrive without permission to\nRwanda.\n\nWorld News // 13 hours ago\n\nKim Jong Un oversees North Korean 'nuclear trigger' counterattack drill\n\nSEOUL, April 23 (UPI) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided a firing drill\nof super-large multiple rocket launchers simulating a nuclear counterattack,\nstate media said Tuesday, one day after Seoul detected a ballistic missile\nlaunch.\n\nWorld News // 18 hours ago\n\nPM Rishi Sunak to announce Britain's largest-ever military aid package for\nUkraine\n\nApril 22 (UPI) -- Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is to travel to Poland on Tuesday\nwhen he will announce Britain's largest-ever military aid package for besieged\nally Ukraine.\n\nWorld News // 1 day ago\n\nEU gives TikTok 24 hours to provide risk report on 'TikTok Lite' rewards\nfeature\n\nApril 22 (UPI) -- The European Commission said on Monday officially opened an\ninvestigation into the Chinese-owned video app TikTok over its TikTok Lite\nversion.\n\nWorld News // 1 day ago\n\nBritain charges 2, Germany arrests 3 for Chinese spying\n\nApril 22 (UPI) -- London's Metropolitan Police charged two men while German\nauthorities arrested three accused of spying for China.\n\nWorld News // 1 day ago\n\nU.N.-EU report finds Europe warming twice the pace of rest of world\n\nApril 22 (UPI) -- Europe saw its warmest year on record in 2023, both on land\nand sea, with climate change driving the rate of warming at double the global\naverage, according to a new international report published Monday.\n\nWorld News // 1 day ago\n\nJapan FTC to give Google chance to voluntary resolve dispute with Yahoo Japan\n\nApril 22 (UPI) -- The Japan Fair Trade Commission gave Google a chance to\nvoluntarily change its search practices after determining it had placed what\nit called unfair restrictions on competitors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Trending Stories\n\nNear Oklahoma City, family of 5 -- including 2 kids -- found dead in home\n\nPM Rishi Sunak to announce Britain's largest-ever military aid package for\nUkraine\n\nFTC votes 3-2 to ban non-compete clauses for American workers\n\nTabloid publisher takes stand to outline 'great relationship' with Trump in\nhush-money trial\n\nBaltimore accuses firms behind Dali ship that destroyed bridge of negligence\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Follow Us\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack to top\n\nAbout UPI Contact Corrections Feedback Advertisements\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 United Press International, Inc.
