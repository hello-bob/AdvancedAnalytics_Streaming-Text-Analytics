U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the\nregion, said U.S. forces destroyed more than 80 drones and at least six\nballistic missiles.\n\nIsrael has been honing its air defences since enduring Iraqi Scud missile\nsalvoes in the 1991 Gulf War, said Dr. Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher\nat the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. That work resulted\nin a multi-layered air defence network linked by central control nodes, he\nsaid.\n\nThe outer layers are the Arrow-2 and Arrow-3 systems, designed to intercept\nballistic missiles fired from thousands of kilometres away. The Arrow-2 is\noptimised for destroying missiles in the atmosphere, while the Arrow-3 can hit\nthem while they are coasting in space. Both are meant to minimise the chance\nthat warheads or payloads from the destroyed targets cause harm on the ground.\n\nDavid\u2019s Sling provides the middle layer of protection, Kalisky said, and is\nmeant to engage shorter-range ballistic missiles launched 100km to 200km (62\nto 124 miles) away. Developed and manufactured jointly by Israel\u2019s state-owned\nRafael Advanced Defense Systems and the U.S. Raytheon Co, David\u2019s Sling can\nalso intercept aircraft, drones and cruise missiles.\n\nThe final ring of protection comes from what is most likely the best-known and\nmost-used of Israel\u2019s air defence systems: the short-range Iron Dome, which is\noptimised for destroying small, slow, unguided targets such as short-range\nrockets and drones, he said.\n\nMissile interception\n\nSpace\n\nMissile\n\nlaunch\n\nEarth\u2019 s atmosphere\n\nTarget\n\n70km\n\n300km\n\n1000km\n\n2000km\n\nIRON\n\nDOME\n\nDAVID\u2019S\n\nSLING\n\nARROW 2\n\nARROW 3\n\nA graphic shows four types of interceptor missile systems Israel uses and the\nranges within which they operate.\n\n## IRON DOME\n\nIron Dome was built to intercept the kind of low-tech rockets fired by the\nPalestinian Islamist movement Hamas in Gaza. Developed by state-owned Rafael\nAdvanced Defense Systems with U.S. backing, it became operational in 2011.\nEach truck-towed unit can direct radar-guided missiles against short-range\nthreats such as rockets, mortars and drones.\n\nA key part of Iron Dome is its control system\u2019s ability to discern what\nincoming targets pose a threat. If an adversary\u2019s rocket will land harmlessly\n- in an unpopulated area or in the sea, for instance - it will not be\nintercepted. That makes it ideal for \u201csaturation\u201d scenarios in which an enemy\ntries to fire so many missiles that not all of them will be shot down, said\nUzi Rubin, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and\nSecurity.\n\n\u201cIts radar and battle management systems are designed to handle a huge number\nof targets simultaneously,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cEach launcher can fire its full load\nof 20 interceptors within 10 seconds or so.\u201d\n\nWhen Hamas began its attack on Israel in October 2023, it fired several\nthousand rockets into Israel, with a reported interception rate of about 90%.\n\nRafael says that over the course of its service, Iron Dome has intercepted\nthousands of targets.\n\nThe company says it delivered two Iron Dome batteries to the U.S. Army in\n2020. Ukraine is seeking the system to protect cities in its war with Russia,\nbut Israel has so far only provided Kyiv with humanitarian support and civil\ndefence supplies.\n\nA video shows the sky over Jerusalem at night during Iran\u2019s attack.

The radar detects\nincoming targets within a 100 km radius and provides midcourse guidance for\nthe Tamir interceptor missile. The battle management control system (BMC)\ncalculates the impact point of an incoming missile and only intercepts those\nthat will fall in a protected area. Each missile launcher can fire up to 20\ninterceptor missiles against incoming targets.\n\nThe systems work to create a protective space above Israeli towns and\nsettlements. Any incoming projectile determined to be a threat can be\ntargeted.\n\nAREA DEFENCE\n\nIron Dome is a mobile system designed to intercept short-range rockets and\nartillery shells that endanger populated areas in Israel.\n\nInterceptor\n\nmissile\n\nIncoming\n\nrockets\n\nIsraeli cities\n\nMissile\n\nlauncher\n\nBattle management\n\nand weapon control\n\nBATTERY CAPABILITIES\n\nEach battery \u2013 a combination of missile launcher, control station and radar \u2013\ncan defend about 150 square kilometres (58 square miles), about the size of a\nmedium-sized city.\n\nDetection and\n\ntracking radar\n\nA graphic shows a city being protected from attack by Iron Dome. Iron Dome is\na mobile system designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells\nthat endanger populated areas in Israel. Each battery \u2013 a combination of\nmissile launcher, control station and radar \u2013 can defend about 150 square\nkilometres (58 square miles), about the size of a medium-sized city.\n\nThe mission of shooting down numerous cheap, low-end threats means Iron Dome\u2019s\ninterceptors must also be inexpensive. Each Tamir missile costs about $50,000,\nKalisky said, which is low relative to a multimillion-dollar Patriot missile.\nThe price of not stopping an incoming threat must also be factored in, said\nAnkit Panda of the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that Iron Dome is a 100% effective capability, but you have to\nconsider the alternative,\u201d of much more damage from enemy rockets, he said.\n\nTamir interceptor missile\n\nThe solid propellant motor\n\nallows the missile to reach Mach 2\n\nFragmentation\n\nwarhead\n\nNavigation and\n\nelectro-optical sensor\n\n2.83 metres\n\n1\n\nThe proximity fuse warhead activates as the missile approaches its target.\n\n2\n\nWithin 10 metres (33 feet) of the target, the warhead detonates, destroying\nthe enemy missile with fragments of high-speed metal.\n\n< 10 metres\n\nA graphic shows a Tamir interceptor missile and how it works. The solid\npropellant motor in a Tamir missile allows it to reach Mach 2. The proximity\nfuse warhead activates as the missile approaches its target. Within 10 metres\n(33 feet) of the target, the warhead detonates, destroying the enemy missile\nwith fragments of high-speed metal.\n\nThe high rate of fire, especially during a full-blown conflict, puts a strain\non the ammunition supply of any air defence system, Kalisky said. That is why\nsaturation attacks are an attractive tactic, and why countries must stockpile\nair defence missiles, he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem with any type of ammunition,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to prepare in\nadvance. You have to prepare for that kind of attack.\u201d\n\nIsrael does not publicise the number of Tamir interceptors it produces or\nstockpiles. It also does not disclose the number of missiles fired by its air\ndefence systems, although Kalisky said Iron Dome is designed to fire two\nmissiles at each target.\n\nThe layers of defences and the use of systems tailor-made for Israel\u2019s\nspecific situation make Iron Dome especially potent, Panda said.\n\n\u201cIsrael I think has the most effective missile defence solution for the\nthreats it faces as a country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty well established\nthat Iron Dome has a concept of operation that is incredibly effective.\u201d\n\nTitle photo\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets launched from the\nGaza Strip, as seen from the city of Ashkelon, Israel, Oct. 9, 2023.\nREUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nSources\n\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)\n\nEdited by\n\nSimon Scarr, Jon McClure and Ros Russell\n\n## Site Index\n\n### Latest\n\n  * Home\n  * Authors\n  * Topic sitemap\n\n### Browse\n\n  * World\n  * Business\n  * Markets\n  * Sustainability\n  * Legal\n  * Breakingviews\n  * Technology\n  * Investigations\n  * Sports\n  * Science\n  * Lifestyle\n\n### Media\n\n  * Videos\n\n  * Pictures\n\n  * Graphics\n\n### About Reuters\n\n  * About Reuters\n  * Careers\n  * Reuters News Agency\n  * Brand Attribution Guidelines\n  * Reuters Leadership\n  * Reuters Fact Check\n  * Reuters Diversity Report\n\n### Stay Informed\n\n  * Download the App (iOS)\n  * Download the App (Android)\n  * Newsletters\n\n## Information you can trust\n\nReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world\u2019s\nlargest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every\nday.
