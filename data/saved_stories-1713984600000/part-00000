But few executives think\nabout questioning as a skill that can be honed. That\u2019s a missed opportunity.\n\n##### The Opportunity\n\nQuestioning is a powerful tool for unlocking value in companies: It spurs\nlearning and the exchange of ideas, it fuels innovation and better\nperformance, it builds trust among team members. And it can mitigate business\nrisk by uncovering unforeseen pitfalls and hazards.\n\n##### The Approach\n\nSeveral techniques can enhance the power and efficacy of queries: Favor\nfollow-up questions, know when to keep questions open-ended, get the sequence\nright, use the right tone, and pay attention to group dynamics.\n\nMuch of an executive\u2019s workday is spent asking others for\ninformation\u2014requesting status updates from a team leader, for example, or\nquestioning a counterpart in a tense negotiation. Yet unlike professionals\nsuch as litigators, journalists, and doctors, who are taught how to ask\nquestions as an essential part of their training, few executives think of\nquestioning as a skill that can be honed\u2014or consider how their own answers to\nquestions could make conversations more productive.\n\nThat\u2019s a missed opportunity. Questioning is a uniquely powerful tool for\nunlocking value in organizations: It spurs learning and the exchange of ideas,\nit fuels innovation and performance improvement, it builds rapport and trust\namong team members. And it can mitigate business risk by uncovering unforeseen\npitfalls and hazards.\n\nFor some people, questioning comes easily. Their natural inquisitiveness,\nemotional intelligence, and ability to read people put the ideal question on\nthe tip of their tongue. But most of us don\u2019t ask enough questions, nor do we\npose our inquiries in an optimal way.\n\nThe good news is that by asking questions, we naturally improve our emotional\nintelligence, which in turn makes us better questioners\u2014a virtuous cycle. In\nthis article, we draw on insights from behavioral science research to explore\nhow the way we frame questions and choose to answer our counterparts can\ninfluence the outcome of conversations. We offer guidance for choosing the\nbest type, tone, sequence, and framing of questions and for deciding what and\nhow much information to share to reap the most benefit from our interactions,\nnot just for ourselves but for our organizations.\n\n## Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Get\n\n\u201cBe a good listener,\u201d Dale Carnegie advised in his 1936 classic How to Win\nFriends and Influence People. \u201cAsk questions the other person will enjoy\nanswering.\u201d More than 80 years later, most people still fail to heed\nCarnegie\u2019s sage advice. When one of us (Alison) began studying conversations\nat Harvard Business School several years ago, she quickly arrived at a\nfoundational insight: People don\u2019t ask enough questions. In fact, among the\nmost common complaints people make after having a conversation, such as an\ninterview, a first date, or a work meeting, is \u201cI wish [s/he] had asked me\nmore questions\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t believe [s/he] didn\u2019t ask me any questions.\u201d\n\nWhy do so many of us hold back? There are many reasons. People may be\negocentric\u2014eager to impress others with their own thoughts, stories, and ideas\n(and not even think to ask questions). Perhaps they are apathetic\u2014they don\u2019t\ncare enough to ask, or they anticipate being bored by the answers they\u2019d hear.\nThey may be overconfident in their own knowledge and think they already know\nthe answers (which sometimes they do, but usually not). Or perhaps they worry\nthat they\u2019ll ask the wrong question and be viewed as rude or incompetent. But\nthe biggest inhibitor, in our opinion, is that most people just don\u2019t\nunderstand how beneficial good questioning can be. If they did, they would end\nfar fewer sentences with a period\u2014and more with a question mark.\n\nSubscribe to our Weekly Newsletter\n\nWeekly Hotlist\n\nA roundup of Harvard Business Review\u2019s most popular ideas and advice.\n\nSign Up\n\nThanks for signing up, !\n\nYou can view our other newsletters or opt out at any time by managing your\nemail preferences.\n\nDating back to the 1970s, research suggests that people have conversations to\naccomplish some combination of two major goals: information exchange\n(learning) and impression management (liking). Recent research shows that\nasking questions achieves both. Alison and Harvard colleagues Karen Huang,\nMichael Yeomans, Julia Minson, and Francesca Gino scrutinized thousands of\nnatural conversations among participants who were getting to know each other,\neither in online chats or on in-person speed dates. The researchers told some\npeople to ask many questions (at least nine in 15 minutes) and others to ask\nvery few (no more than four in 15 minutes). In the online chats, the people\nwho were randomly assigned to ask many questions were better liked by their\nconversation partners and learned more about their partners\u2019 interests. For\nexample, when quizzed about their partners\u2019 preferences for activities such as\nreading, cooking, and exercising, high question askers were more likely to be\nable to guess correctly. Among the speed daters, people were more willing to\ngo on a second date with partners who asked more questions. In fact, asking\njust one more question on each date meant that participants persuaded one\nadditional person (over the course of 20 dates) to go out with them again.\n\nAsking a lot of questions unlocks learning and improves interpersonal bonding.\n\nQuestions are such powerful tools that they can be beneficial\u2014perhaps\nparticularly so\u2014in circumstances when question asking goes against social\nnorms. For instance, prevailing norms tell us that job candidates are expected\nto answer questions during interviews. But research by Dan Cable, at the\nLondon Business School, and Virginia Kay, at the University of North Carolina,\nsuggests that most people excessively self-promote during job interviews. And\nwhen interviewees focus on selling themselves, they are likely to forget to\nask questions\u2014about the interviewer, the organization, the work\u2014that would\nmake the interviewer feel more engaged and more apt to view the candidate\nfavorably and could help the candidate predict whether the job would provide\nsatisfying work. For job candidates, asking questions such as \u201cWhat am I not\nasking you that I should?\u201d can signal competence, build rapport, and unlock\nkey pieces of information about the position.\n\nMost people don\u2019t grasp that asking a lot of questions unlocks learning and\nimproves interpersonal bonding. In Alison\u2019s studies, for example, though\npeople could accurately recall how many questions had been asked in their\nconversations, they didn\u2019t intuit the link between questions and liking.\nAcross four studies, in which participants were engaged in conversations\nthemselves or read transcripts of others\u2019 conversations, people tended not to\nrealize that question asking would influence\u2014or had influenced\u2014the level of\namity between the conversationalists.\n\n## The New Socratic Method\n\nThe first step in becoming a better questioner is simply to ask more\nquestions. Of course, the sheer number of questions is not the only factor\nthat influences the quality of a conversation: The type, tone, sequence, and\nframing also matter.\n\nIn our teaching at Harvard Business School, we run an exercise in which we\ninstruct pairs of students to have a conversation. Some students are told to\nask as few questions as possible, and some are instructed to ask as many as\npossible. Among the low-low pairs (both students ask a minimum of questions),\nparticipants generally report that the experience is a bit like children\nengaging in parallel play: They exchange statements but struggle to initiate\nan interactive, enjoyable, or productive dialogue. The high-high pairs find\nthat too many questions can also create a stilted dynamic. However, the high-\nlow pairs\u2019 experiences are mixed. Sometimes the question asker learns a lot\nabout her partner, the answerer feels heard, and both come away feeling\nprofoundly closer. Other times, one of the participants may feel uncomfortable\nin his role or unsure about how much to share, and the conversation can feel\nlike an interrogation.\n\nOur research suggests several approaches that can enhance the power and\nefficacy of queries. The best approach for a given situation depends on the\ngoals of the conversationalists\u2014specifically, whether the discussion is\ncooperative (for example, the duo is trying to build a relationship or\naccomplish a task together) or competitive (the parties seek to uncover\nsensitive information from each other or serve their own interests), or some\ncombination of both.\n\nSee more HBR charts in Data & Visuals\n\nConsider the following tactics.\n\n### Favor follow-up questions.\n\nNot all questions are created equal. Alison\u2019s research, using human coding and\nmachine learning, revealed four types of questions: introductory questions\n(\u201cHow are you?\u201d), mirror questions (\u201cI\u2019m fine. How are you?\u201d), full-switch\nquestions (ones that change the topic entirely), and follow-up questions (ones\nthat solicit more information). Although each type is abundant in natural\nconversation, follow-up questions seem to have special power. They signal to\nyour conversation partner that you are listening, care, and want to know more.\nPeople interacting with a partner who asks lots of follow-up questions tend to\nfeel respected and heard.\n\nAn unexpected benefit of follow-up questions is that they don\u2019t require much\nthought or preparation\u2014indeed, they seem to come naturally to interlocutors.\nIn Alison\u2019s studies, the people who were told to ask more questions used more\nfollow-up questions than any other type without being instructed to do so.\n\n### Know when to keep questions open-ended.\n\nNo one likes to feel interrogated\u2014and some types of questions can force\nanswerers into a yes-or-no corner. Open-ended questions can counteract that\neffect and thus can be particularly useful in uncovering information or\nlearning something new. Indeed, they are wellsprings of innovation\u2014which is\noften the result of finding the hidden, unexpected answer that no one has\nthought of before.\n\nA wealth of research in survey design has shown the dangers of narrowing\nrespondents\u2019 options. For example, \u201cclosed\u201d questions can introduce bias and\nmanipulation. In one study, in which parents were asked what they deemed \u201cthe\nmost important thing for children to prepare them in life,\u201d about 60% of them\nchose \u201cto think for themselves\u201d from a list of response options. However, when\nthe same question was asked in an open-ended format, only about 5% of parents\nspontaneously came up with an answer along those lines.\n\nOf course, open-ended questions aren\u2019t always optimal. For example, if you are\nin a tense negotiation or are dealing with people who tend to keep their cards\nclose to their chest, open-ended questions can leave too much wiggle room,\ninviting them to dodge or lie by omission. In such situations, closed\nquestions work better, especially if they are framed correctly. For example,\nresearch by Julia Minson, the University of Utah\u2019s Eric VanEpps, Georgetown\u2019s\nJeremy Yip, and Wharton\u2019s Maurice Schweitzer indicates that people are less\nlikely to lie if questioners make pessimistic assumptions (\u201cThis business will\nneed some new equipment soon, correct?\u201d) rather than optimistic ones (\u201cThe\nequipment is in good working order, right?\u201d).\n\n#### Read more about\n\nGood Leadership Is About Asking Good Questions\n\nSometimes the information you wish to ascertain is so sensitive that direct\nquestions won\u2019t work, no matter how thoughtfully they are framed. In these\nsituations, a survey tactic can aid discovery. In research Leslie conducted\nwith Alessandro Acquisti and George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon University,\nshe found that people were more forthcoming when requests for sensitive\ninformation were couched within another task\u2014in the study\u2019s case, rating the\nethicality of antisocial behaviors such as cheating on one\u2019s tax return or\nletting a drunk friend drive home. Participants were asked to rate the\nethicality using one scale if they had engaged in a particular behavior and\nanother scale if they hadn\u2019t\u2014thus revealing which antisocial acts they\nthemselves had engaged in. Although this tactic may sometimes prove useful at\nan organizational level\u2014we can imagine that managers might administer a survey\nrather than ask workers directly about sensitive information such as salary\nexpectations\u2014we counsel restraint in using it. If people feel that you are\ntrying to trick them into revealing something, they may lose trust in you,\ndecreasing the likelihood that they\u2019ll share information in the future and\npotentially eroding workplace relationships.\n\n### Get the sequence right.\n\nThe optimal order of your questions depends on the circumstances. During tense\nencounters, asking tough questions first, even if it feels socially awkward to\ndo so, can make your conversational partner more willing to open up. Leslie\nand her coauthors found that people are more willing to reveal sensitive\ninformation when questions are asked in a decreasing order of intrusiveness.\nWhen a question asker begins with a highly sensitive question\u2014such as \u201cHave\nyou ever had a fantasy of doing something terrible to someone?\u201d\u2014subsequent\nquestions, such as \u201cHave you ever called in sick to work when you were\nperfectly healthy?\u201d feel, by comparison, less intrusive, and thus we tend to\nbe more forthcoming. Of course, if the first question is too sensitive, you\nrun the risk of offending your counterpart. So it\u2019s a delicate balance, to be\nsure.\n\n#### The Power of Questions in Sales\n\nThere are few business settings in which asking questions is more important\nthan sales. A recent study of more than 500,000 business-to-business sales\nconversations\u2014over the phone and via online ...\n\nIf the goal is to build relationships, the opposite approach\u2014opening with less\nsensitive questions and escalating slowly\u2014seems to be most effective. In a\nclassic set of studies (the results of which went viral following a write-up\nin the \u201cModern Love\u201d column of the New York Times), psychologist Arthur Aron\nrecruited strangers to come to the lab, paired them up, and gave them a list\nof questions. They were told to work their way through the list, starting with\nrelatively shallow inquiries and progressing to more self-revelatory ones,\nsuch as \u201cWhat is your biggest regret?\u201d Pairs in the control group were asked\nsimply to interact with each other. The pairs who followed the prescribed\nstructure liked each other more than the control pairs. This effect is so\nstrong that it has been formalized in a task called \u201cthe relationship\ncloseness induction,\u201d a tool used by researchers to build a sense of\nconnection among experiment participants.\n\nGood interlocutors also understand that questions asked previously in a\nconversation can influence future queries. For example, Norbert Schwarz, of\nthe University of Southern California, and his coauthors found that when the\nquestion \u201cHow satisfied are you with your life?\u201d is followed by the question\n\u201cHow satisfied are you with your marriage?\u201d the answers were highly\ncorrelated: Respondents who reported being satisfied with their life also said\nthey were satisfied with their marriage. When asked the questions in this\norder, people implicitly interpreted that life satisfaction \u201cought to be\u201d\nclosely tied to marriage. However, when the same questions were asked in the\nopposite order, the answers were less closely correlated.\n\n### Use the right tone.\n\nPeople are more forthcoming when you ask questions in a casual way, rather\nthan in a buttoned-up, official tone. In one of Leslie\u2019s studies, participants\nwere posed a series of sensitive questions in an online survey. For one group\nof participants, the website\u2019s user interface looked fun and frivolous; for\nanother group, the site looked official. (The control group was presented with\na neutral-looking site.) Participants were about twice as likely to reveal\nsensitive information on the casual-looking site than on the others.\n\nAsking tough questions first can make people more willing to open up.\n\nPeople also tend to be more forthcoming when given an escape hatch or \u201cout\u201d in\na conversation. For example, if they are told that they can change their\nanswers at any point, they tend to open up more\u2014even though they rarely end up\nmaking changes. This might explain why teams and groups find brainstorming\nsessions so productive. In a whiteboard setting, where anything can be erased\nand judgment is suspended, people are more likely to answer questions honestly\nand say things they otherwise might not. Of course, there will be times when\nan off-the-cuff approach is inappropriate. But in general, an overly formal\ntone is likely to inhibit people\u2019s willingness to share information.\n\n### Pay attention to group dynamics.\n\nConversational dynamics can change profoundly depending on whether you\u2019re\nchatting one-on-one with someone or talking in a group. Not only is the\nwillingness to answer questions affected simply by the presence of others, but\nmembers of a group tend to follow one another\u2019s lead. In one set of studies,\nLeslie and her coauthors asked participants a series of sensitive questions,\nincluding ones about finances (\u201cHave you ever bounced a check?\u201d) and sex\n(\u201cWhile an adult, have you ever felt sexual desire for a minor?\u201d).\nParticipants were told either that most others in the study were willing to\nreveal stigmatizing answers or that they were unwilling to do so. Participants\nwho were told that others had been forthcoming were 27% likelier to reveal\nsensitive answers than those who were told that others had been reticent. In a\nmeeting or group setting, it takes only a few closed-off people for questions\nto lose their probing power. The opposite is true, too. As soon as one person\nstarts to open up, the rest of the group is likely to follow suit.\n\nGroup dynamics can also affect how a question asker is perceived. Alison\u2019s\nresearch reveals that participants in a conversation enjoy being asked\nquestions and tend to like the people asking questions more than those who\nanswer them. But when third-party observers watch the same conversation\nunfold, they prefer the person who answers questions. This makes sense: People\nwho mostly ask questions tend to disclose very little about themselves or\ntheir thoughts. To those listening to a conversation, question askers may come\nacross as defensive, evasive, or invisible, while those answering seem more\nfascinating, present, or memorable.\n\n## The Best Response\n\nA conversation is a dance that requires partners to be in sync\u2014it\u2019s a mutual\npush-and-pull that unfolds over time. Just as the way we ask questions can\nfacilitate trust and the sharing of information\u2014so, too, can the way we answer\nthem.\n\nAnswering questions requires making a choice about where to fall on a\ncontinuum between privacy and transparency. Should we answer the question? If\nwe answer, how forthcoming should we be? What should we do when asked a\nquestion that, if answered truthfully, might reveal a less-than-glamorous fact\nor put us in a disadvantaged strategic position? Each end of the\nspectrum\u2014fully opaque and fully transparent\u2014has benefits and pitfalls. Keeping\ninformation private can make us feel free to experiment and learn. In\nnegotiations, withholding sensitive information (such as the fact that your\nalternatives are weak) can help you secure better outcomes. At the same time,\ntransparency is an essential part of forging meaningful connections. Even in a\nnegotiation context, transparency can lead to value-creating deals; by sharing\ninformation, participants can identify elements that are relatively\nunimportant to one party but important to the other\u2014the foundation of a win-\nwin outcome.\n\nAnd keeping secrets has costs. Research by Julie Lane and Daniel Wegner, of\nthe University of Virginia, suggests that concealing secrets during social\ninteractions leads to the intrusive recurrence of secret thoughts, while\nresearch by Columbia\u2019s Michael Slepian, Jinseok Chun, and Malia Mason shows\nthat keeping secrets\u2014even outside of social interactions\u2014depletes us\ncognitively, interferes with our ability to concentrate and remember things,\nand even harms long-term health and well-being.\n\nIn an organizational context, people too often err on the side of privacy\u2014and\nunderappreciate the benefits of transparency. How often do we realize that we\ncould have truly bonded with a colleague only after he or she has moved on to\na new company? Why are better deals often uncovered after the ink has dried,\nthe tension has broken, and negotiators begin to chat freely?\n\nTo maximize the benefits of answering questions\u2014and minimize the risks\u2014it\u2019s\nimportant to decide before a conversation begins what information you want to\nshare and what you want to keep private.\n\n### Deciding what to share.\n\nThere is no rule of thumb for how much\u2014or what type\u2014of information you should\ndisclose. Indeed, transparency is such a powerful bonding agent that sometimes\nit doesn\u2019t matter what is revealed\u2014even information that reflects poorly on us\ncan draw our conversational partners closer. In research Leslie conducted with\nHBS collaborators Kate Barasz and Michael Norton, she found that most people\nassume that it would be less damaging to refuse to answer a question that\nwould reveal negative information\u2014for example, \u201cHave you ever been reprimanded\nat work?\u201d\u2014than to answer affirmatively. But this intuition is wrong. When they\nasked people to take the perspective of a recruiter and choose between two\ncandidates (equivalent except for how they responded to this question), nearly\n90% preferred the candidate who \u201ccame clean\u201d and answered the question. Before\na conversation takes place, think carefully about whether refusing to answer\ntough questions would do more harm than good.\n\n### Deciding what to keep private.\n\nOf course, at times you and your organization would be better served by\nkeeping your cards close to your chest. In our negotiation classes, we teach\nstrategies for handling hard questions without lying. Dodging, or answering a\nquestion you wish you had been asked, can be effective not only in helping you\nprotect information you\u2019d rather keep private but also in building a good\nrapport with your conversational partner, especially if you speak eloquently.\nIn a study led by Todd Rogers, of Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, participants were\nshown clips of political candidates responding to questions by either\nanswering them or dodging them. Eloquent dodgers were liked more than\nineloquent answerers, but only when their dodges went undetected. Another\neffective strategy is deflecting, or answering a probing question with another\nquestion or a joke. Answerers can use this approach to lead the conversation\nin a different direction.\n\n### . . .\n\n\u201cQuestion everything,\u201d Albert Einstein famously said. Personal creativity and\norganizational innovation rely on a willingness to seek out novel information.\nQuestions and thoughtful answers foster smoother and more-effective\ninteractions, they strengthen rapport and trust, and lead groups toward\ndiscovery. All this we have documented in our research. But we believe\nquestions and answers have a power that goes far beyond matters of\nperformance. The wellspring of all questions is wonder and curiosity and a\ncapacity for delight. We pose and respond to queries in the belief that the\nmagic of a conversation will produce a whole that is greater than the sum of\nits parts. Sustained personal engagement and motivation\u2014in our lives as well\nas our work\u2014require that we are always mindful of the transformative joy of\nasking and answering questions.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the May\u2013June 2018 issue of Harvard\nBusiness Review.\n\nRead more on Managing people or related topic Business communication\n\n  * Alison Wood Brooks is the O\u2019Brien Associate Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School.\n\n  * Leslie K.
