For reference, a 5kWh system can power an entire tiny home or RV, or\nseven to 10 household appliances.\n\nAlso: The EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra is the home backup system we needed during a\nrecent storm The Anker Solix X1's batteries can also store energy from solar\npanels, and the system can perform a 20-millisecond switchover during an\noutage for uninterrupted power.\n\n\"Soaring energy bills, power outages, and the shift toward eco-friendly living\nare driving more people to residential solar energy backup,\" Anker Solix\nGeneral Manager Shaun Xiong said in a statement. \"You need a way to store that\nenergy -- and the Anker Solix X1 is the answer.
