Ron DeSantis signed into law H.B. 3, a bill that\nwill forbid children under 14 from signing up for social media accounts and\nrequire children ages 14 or 15 to obtain parental consent to access social\nmedia. The bill, along with others being considered at the state and federal\nlevels, comes in response to growing concerns about the possibly detrimental\neffects of social media on children\u2019s mental health.\n\nThe science on these questions is far from settled, and laws like Florida\u2019s\nwill inevitably face constitutional challenges on First Amendment grounds.\nThese debates will continue to play out, and they\u2019re worth having. But\nFlorida\u2019s regulation has been signed into law, and another, more pressing\nquestion will crop up if it goes into effect on January 1, 2025, as written:\nHow will the government enforce it?\n\nDoing so will inevitably require validating users\u2019 online identities, a\nprocess that, given current technological realities, will either be\nineffective or raise a host of privacy concerns. Similar issues exist with\nregulators\u2019 efforts to crack down on deepfakes, bot-driven misinformation\nnetworks, and other forms of online identity fraud.\n\nEach of these policy efforts has its political valence. Each is worthy of\ndebate on the merits. Yet underlying them all are more essential questions:\nHow do we make the internet governable? Can we?\n\nThe internet age has fundamentally shaken our confidence in tackling these\nuncertainties. Though American policymakers are certainly accustomed to\ndebates about whether or how they should regulate a new technology, most agree\nthat it\u2019s generally possible for the government to do so (even if it\u2019s not\nalways prudent). The internet is different. It upends the concept of borders,\nas anything put on the internet is simultaneously \u201cexported\u201d to every country\non Earth. Unlike physical goods, software can be easily and cheaply\nreplicated. And perhaps most notably, anyone can broadcast to anyone else,\nunder whatever identity he or she wishes to assume. It\u2019s not clear that the\nstate\u2019s command applies as neatly in the world of bits as it does in the world\nof atoms.\n\nThe internet and technologies built upon it put policymakers in an unfamiliar\nposture, yes, but this does not mean that there is nothing the government can\ndo. Success, however, will require a new frame of mind. Rather than simply\ncommanding via the law, governments can build tools and capabilities that\ncreate value for citizens and help enable the policies lawmakers wish to\nenact. Among the best and most pressing examples of such a project is the\ndevelopment of a national digital identification (ID) infrastructure.\n\nAs of this writing, 67 senators have co-sponsored the Kids Online Safety Act\n(KOSA), legislation that aims to create safeguards for children using the\ninternet. State governments across the country have approved bills with\nbroadly similar aims. But setting aside the legitimate substantive debate\nabout these bills, one common question looms over them: How does an internet\nuser prove their age?\n\nNew legislation aims to alter age verification processes, which up until now\nhave largely been governed by the honor system. Under KOSA, for example, the\nFederal Trade Commission and state attorneys general would be empowered to\nbring investigations against companies that expose children to content (and\neven user interface designs) that are deemed \u201cdangerous\u201d for them. Unlike\nearlier laws, such as the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (passed in\n1998), KOSA carries potentially serious legal consequences for social media\nwebsite owners. Thus, the honor system will not do, nor will inferences made\nby algorithms (which, incidentally, only a fraction of the companies covered\nby laws like KOSA are in a position to develop). Companies covered by these\nlaws will need to prove their users\u2019 ages somehow, likely by collecting their\nphone numbers or state-issued IDs.\n\nUnder KOSA, all types of firms\u2014from publicly traded companies such as Meta to\nmidsized enthusiast websites such as Strava (a social media network for\nrunners) to purveyors of online pornography\u2014could need to collect your ID.\nAlready, this raises serious privacy concerns. Policymakers have railed\nagainst firms like Meta for their aggressive data collection tactics, yet\nthese laws mandate the collection of sensitive user data. One shudders to\nimagine what a pornography website might do with such information.\n\nFlorida\u2019s H.B. 3 is even more complicated: because it requires parental\nconsent for children between 14-15, affected social media platforms will need\nto validate not just the age of children but also the identity of a child\u2019s\nparent or guardian. The law does not provide any guidance on the specifics of\nhow any of this is to be done.\n\nIt gets thornier. Artificial intelligence (AI) image generation models have\nbeen used to create convincing photos of fake driver\u2019s licenses, and the odds\nof this capability improving over time are high. And, of course, these same\nimage generation models will be used in countless other ways to impersonate\npeople against their will and without their knowledge. The ability to do so\nwith video and audio is similarly advancing rapidly.\n\nThere is a wide chasm here: We cannot robustly prove who is who online. In the\nphysical world, the government is the source of canonical forms of\nidentification, from driver\u2019s licenses to passports and green cards. How might\nthat function translate to the digital realm?\n\nIdeally, such a system would be based on physical (and hence difficult to\nreplicate) characteristics that uniquely identify an individual. It would also\nbe provably secure so that no one, including the government, could monitor the\nactivity of individual users. (When you present your driver\u2019s license at a\nbar, no centralized government database is being pinged\u2014that should be the\ncase with any online verification.) Finally, such a system would ideally\npermit users to share only relevant, necessary information. For example, if a\nuser wants to access adult entertainment online, all they should need to prove\nis their age. Not their name, not their specific date of birth\u2014just a single\ndata point: Are they at least as old as the law requires them to be?\n\nRecent technological developments present a unique opportunity for the\ngovernment to create a digital public infrastructure for such identification.\nMost Americans carry around devices with biometric authentication hardware\neverywhere they go (fingerprint, iris, and face scanners have been common in\nsmartphones, tablets, and laptops for more than a decade), making unique\nidentification easier. We have also made great strides with end-to-end\nencryption, a cryptography technique that allows two parties to exchange\ninformation while keeping the information fully secure while it is in transit.\nCryptography researchers and startups (often working on blockchain\ntechnologies) have made substantial progress on so-called \u201czero-knowledge\nproofs\u201d that enable the kind of selective disclosure where users only prove\nspecific information.\n\nThese developments suggest a national digital ID system is possible in the\nU.S. But how would the various components fit together? Here, international\nexamples can offer some guidance.\n\nIndia, for instance, has implemented the Aadhaar system, which provides\ncitizens with a unique 12-digit ID number linked to their biometric and\ndemographic data. To enroll, citizens visit an authorized center to provide\nfingerprints, iris scans, and a photograph. Once the ID number is issued, it\nserves as a universal proof of identity for a wide range of services\u2014from\nopening a bank account to filing taxes and receiving government benefits.\n\nEstonia is perhaps the most celebrated digital infrastructure innovator. Its\nsystem, called e-Estonia, is based on a digital ID card that allows citizens\nto securely authenticate their identity online. A chip-enabled card is used in\ncombination with a PIN code and serves as a legally binding digital signature.\nThis allows Estonians to easily access more than 5,000 e-services spanning\nhealth care, voting, education, banking, and more. Essentially all government\nservices are digitized and accessible online. Estonia has also implemented\nX-Road, a data exchange layer that enables secure, decentralized data sharing\nbetween public and private databases.\n\nNeither country\u2019s system is perfect, and both would undoubtedly need to be\nmodified for the U.S. Americans, with our healthy tradition of federalism, are\nmore used to identity being provided by state driver\u2019s licenses. Obviously,\nthere are security concerns with a centralized database of citizens\u2019 biometric\ndata. The system would need to be used more sparingly than elsewhere in the\nworld because of our robust protections for free speech. It is inconsistent\nwith most interpretations of the First Amendment, for example, to forbid\nanonymous speech as a matter of law. Therefore, social media platforms\nprobably shouldn\u2019t be required to connect every account with the account\nholder\u2019s real identity. Perhaps most importantly, Americans\u2019 trust in\ngovernment is low and unlikely to rise in the foreseeable future.\n\nOn the other hand, a capability of this kind would be a useful countermeasure\nagainst social media bots. It would be possible, for example, to have a \u201cblue\ncheck\u201d indicating one\u2019s personhood, even if the account in question is\nanonymous. \u201cSpear phishing\u201d emails involving the impersonation of a specific\nindividual could become much easier to spot. Identity fraud and cybercrime,\nwhile not disappearing by any means, would become more challenging. Debates\nover bills like KOSA could focus on the substantive merits (is it right to\ncensor the internet for children?) rather than on implementation details and\nuser privacy concerns.\n\nDigital public infrastructure is not easy. Nontrivial technical challenges\nabound, and some might reasonably debate whether the government or private\ncompanies should build these capabilities. While it would make sense for the\ngovernment to collaborate with the private sector to build such a system, the\nstate may end up carrying the load for the same reason that our passports and\ndriver\u2019s licenses are not handed out by corporations: because infrastructure\nof this kind is ultimately a public good. In an ideal world, digital\nidentification would be free, widely available, and fully private, but it is\nnot clear how a privately owned solution would satisfy all three criteria.\nNonetheless, there is an ecosystem of startups approaching this problem from a\nvariety of angles. If the federal government does not provide this service, it\nwill likely be provided by market actors with all the strengths\u2014and\nweaknesses\u2014that implies.\n\nEven if the technical challenges can be delegated to private firms, the\npolitical obstacles cannot be. Convincing Americans that digital ID technology\nreally is secure and reliable will be an uphill battle\u2014as it should be.\nDigital IDs are still a new idea relying on recent technology, and the\ngovernment has not always shown itself to be a capable tech developer or a\nfaithful steward of Americans\u2019 privacy. Public skepticism is justified. For\nthat reason, policymakers would be wise to find small-scale ways to deploy and\ntest this technology before rolling it out broadly. In the same vein, the\noverseers of the system will likely need to iterate rapidly to real-world\nconditions and user feedback\u2014another characteristic of successful 21st-century\norganizations that our federal government has largely failed to cultivate.\n\nIn a deeper way, then, digital public infrastructure offers an opportunity for\nthe federal government to demonstrate to its citizens that it can evolve to\nmeet the needs of our current era\u2014an opportunity to earn trust. Perhaps that,\neven more than the infrastructure itself, is what America needs most.\n\n0\n\nBy Dean Ball\n\n##### Comments (0)\n\nJoin The Dispatch to participate in the comments.\n\nThere are currently no responses to this article.
