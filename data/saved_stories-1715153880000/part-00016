It found that renewables have grown from 19% of electricity\nin 2000 to more than 30% of global electricity last year.\n\n\u201cThe renewables future has arrived,\u201d said Dave Jones, Ember\u2019s director of\nglobal insights. \u201cSolar, in particular, is accelerating faster than anyone\nthought possible.\u201d\n\nSolar was the main supplier of electricity growth, according to Ember, adding\nmore than twice as much new electricity generation as coal in 2023.\n\nIt was the fastest-growing source of electricity for the 19th consecutive\nyear, and also became the largest source of new electricity for the second\nyear running, after surpassing wind power.\n\nThe first comprehensive review of global electricity data covers 80 countries,\nwhich represent 92% of the world\u2019s electricity demand, as well as historic\ndata for 215 countries.\n\nThe surge in clean electricity is expected to power a 2% decrease in global\nfossil fuel generation in the year ahead, according to Ember.\n\n\u201cThe decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable,\u201d said Jones. \u201c2023\nwas likely the pivot point \u2013 peak emissions in the power sector \u2013 a major\nturning point in the history of energy. But the pace of emissions falls\ndepends on how fast the renewables revolution continues.\u201d\n\nAlthough fossil fuel use in the world\u2019s electricity system may begin to fall,\nit continues to play an outsized role in global energy \u2013 in transport fuels,\nheavy industry and heating.\n\nA separate study by the Energy Institute found last year that fossil fuels\nincluding oil, gas and coal made up 82% of the world\u2019s primary energy.\n\nWorld leaders are aiming to grow renewables to 60% of global electricity by\n2030 under an agreement struck at the UN\u2019s Cop28 climate change conference in\nDecember.\n\nThis would require countries to triple their current renewable electricity\ncapacity in the next six years, which would almost halve power sector\nemissions.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Renewable energy\n  * Energy\n  * Solar power\n  * Coal\n  * Wind power\n  * Fossil fuels\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
