The small, evergreen\ntree or shrub is famously drought-tolerant, with some varieties capable of\nenduring more than 200 days between waterings. And yet here I was, gently\nlowering an 18-inch variety named for botanist Howard McMinn into the damp\nsoil of Tacoma, a city in Washington known for its towering Douglas firs,\nbigleaf maples, and an average of 152 rainy days per year.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m a thoughtless gardener. Some studies suggest that the\nSeattle area\u2019s climate will more closely resemble Northern California\u2019s by\n2050, so I\u2019m planting that region\u2019s trees, too.\n\nClimate change is scrambling the seasons, wreaking havoc on trees. Some\ntemperate and high-altitude regions will grow more humid, which can lead to\nlethal rot. In other temperate zones, drier springs and hotter summers are\ndisrupting annual cycles of growth, damaging root systems, and rendering any\nsurvivors more vulnerable to pests.\n\nDead larch trees, a result of bark beetle infestation, stand amidst a city\nforest in Hagen, Germany. In addition to pests, high temperatures and drought\nhave created stress for the native forest.

Scientists say\nthat climate change will likely kill virtually all of California\u2019s iconic\nJoshua trees by the end of the century. David McNew / Getty Images\n\nThe victims of these shifts include treasured species from around the globe,\nincluding certain varietials of the Texas pecan, the towering baobabs found in\nSenegal, and the expansive fig trees native to Sydney. In the Pacific\nNorthwest, I\u2019ve seen summer heat domes turn our region\u2019s beloved conifers into\nskeletons and prolonged dry spells wither the crowns of maples until the\nleaves die off in chunks.\n\nThe world is warming too quickly for arboreal adaptation, said Manuel Esperon-\nRodriguez, an ecologist at Western Sydney University who researches the impact\nof climate change on trees. That\u2019s especially true of native trees. \u201cThey are\nthe first ones to suffer,\u201d he said.\n\nUrban arborists say planting for the future is urgently needed and could\nprevent a decline in leafy cover just when the world needs it most. Trees play\na crucial role in keeping cities cool. A study published in 2022 found that a\nroughly 30 percent increase in the metropolitan canopy could prevent nearly 40\npercent of heat-related deaths in Europe. The need is particularly acute in\nmarginalized communities, where residents \u2014 often people of color \u2014 live among\ntreeless expanses where temperatures can go much higher than in more affluent\nneighborhoods.\n\nPeople take refuge under a shady tree amid an intense heat wave in the summer\nof 2022 in Calexico, California.

Urban botanists\nand other experts warn that cities are well behind where they should be to\navoid overall tree loss. The full impact of climate change may be decades\naway, but oaks, maples, and other popular species can take 10 or more years to\nmature (and show they can tolerate a new climate), making the search for the\nright varieties for each region a frantic race against time.\n\nIn response, scientists and urban foresters are trying to speed up the\nprocess, thinking strategically about where to source new trees and using\nexperiments to predict the hardiness of new species. Beyond that, many places\nare moving past the idea that native species are the most sustainable choice\nby default.\n\n\u201cEverybody is looking for the magic tree,\u201d said Mac Martin, who leads the\nurban and community forestry program at Texas A&M\u2019s Forest Service. He went on\nto say that one kind of tree isn\u2019t enough. We need \u201ca high number of diverse\ntrees that can survive.\u201d\n\nIn other words, a whole new urban forest.\n\nIn late 2023, that quest took Kevin Martin, no relation to Mac, to the arid\nforests of Romania. As the head of tree collections at the Royal Botanic\nGardens, Kew, he spent a week hiking through pine-scented forests to gather\nbeech acorns. He brought seeds from seven species back to the U.K. and planted\nthem in individual pots at the botanical garden\u2019s nursery. Now, he waits.\n\nHe hopes the trees will thrive in London\u2019s drier springtime soils, which are\nmaking it hard for old standbys like the English oak to survive the hotter\nsummers that follow. The research is part of a bigger change for the botanical\ngarden, Martin said, which historically focused on collecting rare plant\nspecimens. \u201cWe\u2019re flipping that on its head and looking at what we want to\ngrow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a good outcome for humanity.\u201d\n\nA group of people trek through a wooded area of Romania looking for trees for\nthe Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew that might thrive in a future London climate.\nThomas Freeth / Courtesy of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew\n\nUnder normal conditions, trees are among the best defenses against heat, and\nnot just because they provide a shady place to rest. As their leaves transform\nsunlight into energy, trees give off water vapor through tiny holes called\nstomata, cooling the air around them with \u201cnature\u2019s own air conditioning,\u201d\nMartin said.\n\nBut increasingly hot temperatures can shut down this process. In extreme dry\nheat, the cells slacken and the stomata close, stopping water from escaping.\nThe point at which this happens is called the turgor loss point, and it\u2019s like\nthe leaves on a houseplant wilting. If a stressed tree doesn\u2019t get water, its\nleaves will overheat and die before the fall, sometimes across entire sections\nof the crown. In highly humid conditions, the air holds too much water vapor\nto absorb any more, leaving leaves waterlogged and beckoning rot. Even if a\ntree in this condition looks healthy, it can\u2019t cool cities as well as it used\nto. Making matters worse, distressed plants are more vulnerable to pests like\nthe borer beetle.\n\nNative trees are particularly at risk for climate stress, and in many cities,\nthey make up a significant chunk of urban tree cover. Eighty-seven percent of\nthe trees in Plano, Texas, are native species, for example. That number is 66\npercent in Santa Rosa, California, and 30 percent in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nTo be sure, non-native trees have been a part of human settlements for a long\ntime. Plants often spread with human migration, and European colonists brought\nmany species to other continents. Many of these newcomers grow faster than the\nindigenous varieties, and some have proven better suited to urban areas.\n\nDead leaves hang on a holly tree branch in London in August 2022 as a result\nof stress caused by heat and lack of rain.

Until the seasons started going haywire, this\nmade them well-suited to their adopted homes. For example, the London plane, a\ncross between an American sycamore and a plane tree from western Asia, lines\nstreets in temperate zones around the world. Now, scientists are worried about\nthe tree\u2019s future in its namesake city as dry springs and hot summers leave\nthem weak and susceptible to pests.\n\nTo find solutions, researchers are studying which trees could do better than\nthose currently struggling in rapidly warming cities, with an eye toward\nspecies that have already adapted to drier regions hundreds or even thousands\nof miles away. In Canada, for example, scientists have matched trees from the\nnorthern United States with the expected climates in cities including\nVancouver, Winnipeg, and Ottawa. Urban foresters in Sydney are considering the\ntrees in Grafton, an Australian city about 290 miles closer to the equator.\n\nA researcher from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew bends over his notes while\nhunting for beech acorns in Romania. Thomas Freeth / Courtesy of the Royal\nBotanic Gardens, Kew\n\nThinking of a future U.K., Kevin Martin started evaluating trees from the\nsteppes of Romania more than 1,000 miles away. To find the right places to\ncollect acorns, Martin looked at both temperature and the amount of water\navailable in the soils of Romanian forests, explaining that trees in moist\nsoils in tropical rainforests or near rivers will keep going even in hot\nconditions.\n\nHe will have to wait two years for the acorns to sprout and grow into\nsaplings. Only then can he begin stress-testing the specimens to see if the\ntrees are a good fit for the growing conditions of London in 2050 and beyond.\nMartin plans to study at what point the trees\u2019 leaves hit turgor loss in dry,\nhot conditions. But crucially, the trees must also be able to adapt to\nLondon\u2019s cold winters, which are expected to stay freezing even as drought and\nheat waves increase.\n\nSeedlings grow in the arboretum at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Courtesy of\nRoyal Botanic Gardens, Kew\n\nExamining leaf turgor loss can\u2019t be used to assess trees for every\nneighborhood in a city. Parts of Sydney are facing increasingly humid summers\nin an otherwise temperate climate. With this in mind, the municipal forestry\ndepartment used a database that matches a far-off location\u2019s current humidity\nwith what experts expect for the city in 2050. In addition to considering\ntemperature, officials hope to increase tree canopy to cover 27 percent of the\ncity in the next quarter century. They are also mindful that the climate will\nchange gradually and have laid out a phased planting plan. Trees that thrive\nin the Sydney of 2060 may struggle in 2100.\n\nSuch factors are on Mac Martin\u2019s mind as his department updates Texas A&M\u2019s\nonline tree selector, a statewide database that recommends species, to include\nvarieties that are likely to flourish in the future.\n\nTexas is slated to experience a triple climate whammy of hotter summers,\ncolder winters, and changing humidity, with some places becoming intolerably\ndry and others getting more muggy. It\u2019s a complex weather pattern to plant for\n\u2014 and that\u2019s assuming cities are prepared to adapt once the right species are\nidentified.\n\nAs risky as it may seem to hold on to endemic species in the face of climate\nchange, some governments continue to create policies that favor native trees\nover non-natives. Canada, for example, has funded the planting of thousands of\nnative trees in urban areas through its 2 Billion Trees project.\n\nBotanists like Henrik Sj\u00f6man, who oversees collections at the Gothenburg\nBotanical Gardens in Sweden, say native-only thinking can leave cities\nunprepared to adapt to climate change. But he doesn\u2019t believe cities must\ncompletely abandon native species. He hopes that some species can be saved\nwith a process he calls \u201cupgrading.\u201d The idea is to find trees from the same\nspecies that are already growing in harsher conditions, and propagate seeds\nfrom those plants. To grow more resilient English oaks in the U.K., for\nexample, scientists could grow them from acorns sourced from western Asia,\nwhere the tree also grows. These acorns would come from trees thriving in a\nmore arid region, so they could potentially yield hardier varietals that will\none day thrive in a drier London.\n\nAdditionally, locale-adapted native species might continue thriving in\nwoodlands like large city parks or green spaces. Sj\u00f6man said it\u2019s possible\nthat trees in undeveloped areas will have more time to adapt to climate\nchange, because rainfall more easily soaks into the ground and fills the water\ntable. That\u2019s not the case in highly paved and built-up neighborhoods, where\ndecreasing rainfall hurts trees more.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s pushed to its limit in urban environments,\u201d Sj\u00f6man said.\n\nThat reality has many locales taking a \u201cblock-by-block\u201d approach to planting\nguidelines. Toronto, for example, plants trees from the region\u2019s ecosystem\nwhenever possible, said Kristjan Vitols, the city\u2019s supervisor of forest\nhealth care and management. That\u2019s especially true of its iconic ravines,\nwhere newly planted trees must be endemic \u2014 and raised from locally sourced\nseeds when possible. But the city is also open to non-native species where\nplants face harsh conditions along streets.\n\nThe rules for Toronto\u2019s ravines are based on the idea that a species will\ndevelop traits specific to a location as they grow over many generations. As a\nresult, trees grown from seeds gathered in Toronto may be more likely to\nblossom when native pollinators are active than seeds from the same species\ngrown at a lower latitude.\n\nForesters say there\u2019s another valid argument for trying to keep as many native\ntrees as possible. For some First Nations and Indigenous people with deep ties\nto particular varieties, phasing them out could add to the long history of\ncultural and physical dispossession.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest, for example, the Western redcedar (written as one\nword because it\u2019s not a true cedar) is central to Native American cultural\npractices for many local tribes. Some groups refer to themselves as the\n\u201cpeople of the cedar tree,\u201d using the logs for canoes, basketry, and medicine.\n\nA dead branch is visible on a Western redcedar tree in Oregon in October 2023.\nAmanda Loman / AP Photo\n\nBut drying soils mean the tree is no longer thriving in many parts of\nPortland, Oregon, said Jenn Cairo, the city\u2019s urban forestry manager. The city\nhas faced deadly heat domes and drier conditions in recent years. As a result,\nPortland only recommends planting the species in optimal conditions in its\nlist of approved street trees. \u201cWe\u2019re not eliminating them,\u201d she said, \u201cbut\nwe\u2019re being careful about where we\u2019re planting them.\u201d\n\nA similar tactic is being used in Sydney, where the Port Jackson fig tree is\nstruggling, but a close relative, the Moreton Bay fig, is thriving. Head of\nurban forestry Karen Sweeney said the city is looking at irrigated parklands\nas potential homes for native species that are dying elsewhere in the city.\n\u201cWe often say we\u2019re happy to do it where we can find a location,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen introducing new tree species to supplement the urban canopy, they must be\nsure any newcomers won\u2019t spread invasively \u2014 dominating their new habitats and\ncausing damage to native species.\n\nRead Next\n\nIn America\u2019s cities, inequality is engrained in the trees\n\nAdam Mahoney\n\nThere are plenty of examples of what to avoid. The Norway maple, native to\nEurope and western Asia, has escaped the bounds of North American cities,\ncreating excessive shade and crowding out understory plants \u2014 they\u2019re one of\nthe invasive species pushing out natives in the ravines of Toronto. Tree of\nheaven, native to China, deposits chemicals into the soil that damage nearby\nplants, letting it establish dense thickets and drive out native species; it\nis illegal to plant in parts of the U.S., including Indiana, where residents\nare urged to pull it up wherever they see it. The highly flammable eucalyptus,\nnative to Australia, has put down roots all over the world, bringing increased\nwildfire danger along with it.\n\nUrban tree experts don\u2019t expect introduced species to cause major disruptions\nto native wildlife. Done right, adding some variety to cities dominated by one\nkind of tree could reduce the problems caused by waves of pests or disease. A\npatchwork of species could create a buffer against tree-to-tree infection\namong the same species. While it\u2019s possible that new plant species displace\nplants used by animals that depend on one kind of plant to survive, those\ncases are the exception, Esperon-Rodriguez, the ecologist at Western Sydney\nUniversity, said.\n\nSome native animals do surprisingly well alongside their new plant neighbors.\nIntroducing trees that are closely related to what\u2019s already there could\nprovide additional food and shelter for the local fauna. Animals might already\nbe eating fruit from a new tree that grows somewhere else in their range.\n\nThe manzanita tree in my yard is still growing strong as of April 2024. Laura\nHautala\n\nIf it thrives, my Howard McMinn manzanita could attract Anna\u2019s hummingbird\nwith its pale blossoms in the Pacific Northwest, just as it would in its\nnative California hills.\n\nFor now, my manzanita is a small bush. (Manzanita straddles the line between\nshrub and tree, which is not a clear-cut distinction. The definition of a tree\nis something that ornithologist David Allen Sibley said \u201cone could quibble\nendlessly over.\u201d) The plant made it through a cold snap this winter, and I was\nhappy to see the bright green new leaves growing at the tips of its little\nbranches after temperatures warmed.\n\nEager for a sign of spring, I leaned in close and found what I was looking\nfor: clusters of tiny, unopened flower buds.\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
