The practice\nstarted innocently enough. I write book reviews from time to time, and so\npublishers sometimes send me upcoming titles that fall roughly within my\ninterests. When a publisher provided a choice between a PDF of a book and a\nphysical copy, I would usually ask for the PDF, because I didn\u2019t want my house\nto fill up with books that I might end up not reading. But what was at first a\nmatter of clutter-free convenience became a habit, and now I encounter nearly\nevery written work, regardless of its length, quality, and difficulty, on the\nsmall screen of my iPhone.\n\nI use a variety of e-reading apps: Amazon Kindle, Apple Books, Libby. The last\nthree books I downloaded onto the Apple Books app are Rachel Cusk\u2019s novel\n\u201cSecond Place\u201d; Malcolm Lowry\u2019s 1947 classic \u201cUnder the Volcano,\u201d which I\nbought because I wanted to see if I would enjoy it more than I did when read\nit twenty years ago; and Gary Indiana\u2019s essay collection \u201cFire Season.\u201d\nAccording to the little readout beneath the cover image for each book, I am\nnine per cent through the Cusk, a distressing three per cent through the Lowry\nreread, and a hundred per cent through the Indiana, a book I found liberating,\nboth for its style and for its freeing expression of unpleasant thoughts.\n\n### News & Politics\n\nThe latest from Washington and beyond, covering current events, the economy,\nand more, from our columnists and correspondents.\n\nThe e-reading apps have their merits. At times, they become respites from the\nother, more addictive apps on my phone. Switching to a book from, say,\nTwitter, is like the phone-scroller\u2019s version of a nice hike\u2014the senses\nreorient themselves, and you feel more alert and vigorous, because you\u2019ve\nspent six to eight minutes going from seven to eleven per cent of Arthur\nKoestler\u2019s \u201cDarkness at Noon.\u201d Or you might feel a sense of pride because\nyou\u2019ve reached the sixty-per-cent mark in Elton John\u2019s autobiography, \u201cMe,\u201d\nwhich isn\u2019t a great work of literature but at least is better than Twitter.\nThe book apps also seem to work as a stopgap for children, who are always\nlusting after screen time of any sort. My seven-year-old daughter has read\nhundreds of books on the Libby app, which lets you check out e-books from\npublic libraries you belong to. As a parent, I find this wildly preferable to\nhearing the din of yet another stupid YouTube short or \u201cIs it Cake?\u201d episode\ncoming through her iPad\u2019s speakers.\n\nStill, the arrival of these technologies has been accompanied by a steady\ndecline in the number of books that get read in any form. A pair of 1999\nGallup polls, for example, found that Americans, on average, had read 18.5\nbooks in the course of the previous twelve months. (It should be noted that\nthese were books people had read, or said they had read, \u201ceither all or part\nof the way through.\u201d) By 2021, the number had fallen to 12.6. In 2023, a\nNational Endowment for the Arts survey found that the share of American adults\nwho read novels or short stories had declined from 45.2 per cent in 2012 to\n37.6 per cent in 2022, a record low. There are plenty of theories about why\nthis is happening, involving broad finger-pointing toward the Internet or the\nongoing influence of television, or even shifting labor conditions, as more\nwomen have entered the workforce.\n\nWe continue to spend a lot of time reading words, whether via social media or\npush notifications or text messages, but it can seem off to label any of that\n\u201creading,\u201d a term that suggests something edifying or educational. Even book\napps, I find, can feel like a sort of in-between, not the time suck of social\nmedia but also not the comfortable absorption of a good paperback. There\u2019s\nsomething about scrolling and tapping that leads to a quick calcification of\nmuscle memory. You start to tap on the same things not out of familiarity or\ncomfort but out of sheer habit. Now that I read on my phone, I give up on new\nbooks more quickly than I used to. I go back to the same stuff over and over,\nin the same way that I watch the same YouTube videos over and over. I\u2019m not\nentirely sure why I get mired in such a rut; part of it, I suspect, is just\nthat I\u2019m getting older. Of the books I\u2019ve recently downloaded, only the Cusk\ncame to me via recommendation algorithm, the \u201cFor You\u201d box in Apple Books.\nEven so, I find that my reading habits follow a pattern that one might call\nalgorithmic, and which I prefer to call laziness.\n\nMy colleague Kyle Chayka has written shrewdly and at length about the\nseduction of algorithms and the homogenizing effect they have on cultural\nproduction. But I have found myself wondering whether we actually live in a\nworld forcibly shaped by algorithms or whether our phones themselves\u2014their\nfiddly buttons, their flashing screens, their slight but satisfying heft\u2014have\nother, more fundamental ways of making us lazy. If the algorithms are to\nblame, then we need to find ways to get outside of or otherwise away from\nthem. But if the problem is our phones\u2014and, of course, us\u2014then we may have to\nwalk away from much more.\n\nThe BOOX Palma is a new e-reader that promises an immersive experience for\n\u201creading an ebook, listening to a podcast, or perusing your favorite news\nfeeds.\u201d It costs about two hundred and eighty dollars and is roughly the size\nof a Google Pixel phone. The Palma runs on the Android platform, which means\nthat you can add apps like Twitter to the device, but doing so is clearly not\nthe point. The screen is matte, gray scale, and plain. Like the Kindle and\nother e-readers, the Palma is supposed to approximate the look of the physical\npage and cut down on eye fatigue.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nTextures: For Black Women, Embracing Natural Hair Is About More than Style\n\nSeveral years ago, there was some talk that cell-phone addiction was driven,\nin part, by the bright colors on our phone. Turning your phone display to gray\nscale would, it was suggested, make things feel less immersive and a bit\ndrearier; this, in turn, would help you cut down on your screen time. Of\ncourse, even if this trick works, you can always change your phone back\nwhenever you want. The Palma, though, does not have color options, nor does it\nhave cellular service, and that means you cannot connect to the Internet\nwithout Wi-Fi. You can take the device on long, contemplative walks, listening\nto music or podcasts that you\u2019ve downloaded, knowing that you will not be\ndisturbed by a push notification while you stroll through the woods.\n\nI have bought a handful of similar devices through the years, in the vain hope\nthat one of them might replace my iPhone. The dream is a handheld object that\nrenders the worst and most addictive apps unusable and perhaps even makes the\ngood apps\u2014which is to say, word-processing and e-reading apps\u2014a little better.\nThere\u2019s always a honeymoon period with these devices, during which I envision\na whole new life of information consumption. When I bought a Kindle, a few\nyears ago, I subscribed to the Financial Times\u2019s Kindle delivery service; I\npictured myself sitting at the table in our kitchen with a bowl of oatmeal, a\npot of coffee, and the gray-scale version of the F.T., which might not be as\nnice as the print version, with its salmon pages, but is certainly better than\nreading the newspaper\u2019s iPhone app, with a notification buzzing every few\nminutes. That particular fantasy didn\u2019t last a week.\n\nA methadone-like treatment for cell-phone addiction\u2014that is, a tamer and less\naddictive version of the real thing\u2014doesn\u2019t seem to work. Though the BOOX\nPalma can make the apps gray and accessible only through Wi-Fi, I will\nprobably just spend more of my time in Wi-Fi range, watching black-and-white\nvideos. This doesn\u2019t mean that the Palma or other e-readers are useless. The\nPalma has speakers and Bluetooth compatibility, so it can work with audiobooks\nto create something of a patchwork of portable text: words issue from the car\nspeakers on my drive to my younger child\u2019s day care, pop up on the device\u2019s\nscreen when I\u2019m waiting in line for coffee, and finally appear on the desktop\nmonitor in my office, where they will get swallowed up by five separate chat\nplatforms and the demands of my fantasy-basketball team.\n\nThis bouncing around might be clumsy and a bit tacky, but it tweaks the\nrelationship I have with the prose on the page\u2014and not, to my surprise, in a\nbad way. As a writer, I often read to remind myself that sentences can, in\nfact, be interesting. This multimedia method of reading creates quick little\nshots of prose that can loosen the writing gears. You can read a few pages of\nBruce Chatwin, listen to the next chapter in your car, then bounce back to\nyour Google Docs app to spill a bit of short-term inspiration onto your own\npage. Writers are not entirely different from the large language models that\nare supposed to replace us: we take in words with our eyes, sort them in our\nheads, then spit them back out in a sequence that mimics a voice. E-readers\ncan provide a point of stylistic differentiation. Maybe the L.L.M.s will learn\nto mimic Nabokov better than I can, but I doubt that they will ever sense the\ndifference between \u201cPale Fire\u201d when it\u2019s read out loud and \u201cPale Fire\u201d on the\npage, nor can they feel out the subtle demands this new form of reading would\nplace upon us writers who, I imagine, will soon have to adjust our prose, even\nsubconsciously, to move from screen to speaker to second screen. Those of us\nwho care about human interventions into style, regardless of how subtle and\nultimately insignificant they may be, can perhaps take some solace, then, in\nthe possibility that the future of reading will be across mediums, devices,\nand senses. If we are truly being colonized by the algorithms and A.I., we at\nleast have more places to hide.\n\nOne of the books that I find myself tapping on repeatedly\u2014without ever getting\npast forty per cent, somehow\u2014is Richard Brautigan\u2019s novella \u201cTrout Fishing in\nAmerica.\u201d I\u2019m not being compelled by an algorithm. But there\u2019s a surf spot in\nMarin County that I used to go to which is very near the house where\nBrautigan, in 1984, died by suicide. Over the years, I told a handful of other\nsurfers about the links between Brautigan and this spot, and later, whenever I\nwould make it back out there, I would see the cropping of little houses on the\nhill overlooking the ocean, many of them with chicken runs and ruined\nvegetable-garden projects, and I would think to myself, with a great deal of\nembarrassment, that I still hadn\u2019t actually finished \u201cTrout Fishing in\nAmerica.\u201d Little compulsions like that one probably determine our online\nbehavior more than we would like to admit. What\u2019s particularly distressing to\nme is that, although I can imagine a world in which careful regulation and\navoidance of algorithms makes phones less addictive, I cannot imagine myself\nfreed from such stubborn vanities. \u2666\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Why facts don\u2019t change our minds.\n\n  * The tricks rich people use to avoid taxes.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * How did polyamory get so popular?\n\n  * The ghostwriter who regrets working for Donald Trump.\n\n  * Snoozers are, in fact, losers.\n\n  * Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: \u201cGirl\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nJay Caspian Kang is a staff writer at The New Yorker.\n\nMore:ReadingBookse-readingAmazon Kindle\n\n### News & Politics\n\nThe latest from Washington and beyond, covering current events, the economy,\nand more, from our columnists and correspondents.\n\nRead More\n\nPage-Turner\n\nOur Essential Cookbooks\n\nFifteen cookbooks that New Yorker writers and editors can\u2019t do without.\n\nBy The New Yorker\n\nBooks\n\nBriefly Noted\n\n\u201cCocktails with George and Martha,\u201d \u201cCahokia Jazz,\u201d \u201cThe Limits,\u201d and \u201cThe\nTower.\u201d\n\nCover Story\n\nAna Juan\u2019s \u201cClickbait\u201d\n\nThe artist captures the mesmerizing\u2014and distracting\u2014glow of modern\nentertainment.\n\nBy Fran\u00e7oise Mouly\n\nCover Story\n\nMark Ulriksen\u2019s \u201cStanding Guard\u201d\n\nThe artist depicts the tail-wagging occasion of the first signs of spring.\n\nBy Fran\u00e7oise Mouly\n\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
