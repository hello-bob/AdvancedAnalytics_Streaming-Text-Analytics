Ubuntu 24.04 LTS brings together the latest\nadvancements from the Linux ecosystem into a release that is built to empower\nopen source developers and deliver innovation for the next 12 years.\n\nThe road to Noble Numbat has proven to be an exciting journey through\nsuccessively ambitious interim releases, experimenting with new approaches to\nsecurity (and tackling last minute CVEs), evolving our core desktop apps, and\ncontinuing our commitment to performance and compatibility across a wide array\nof hardware supported by the brand new Linux 6.8 kernel.\n\nDownload for free\n\nWhilst each LTS is a significant milestone, it\u2019s never the final destination.\nWe look forward to extending and expanding on what we\u2019ve delivered today both\nwithin the lifecycle of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and in future releases, always\nconsidering how we can live up to our mission, and the values of Ubuntu\nDesktop.\n\nLet\u2019s get into the details.\n\n## Rethinking provisioning\n\nAddressing the fundamental issue of \u201chow do I get Ubuntu on this machine?\u201d is\nstill one of our biggest priorities. Whilst today Ubuntu ships pre-installed\non millions of desktops, laptops and workstations around the world thanks to\nour partnerships with OEMs like Dell, HP and Lenovo, more than ten times as\nmany users install the operating system themselves each year. Here\u2019s what\nwe\u2019re adding to simplify Ubuntu installations.\n\n### Unifying the stack\n\nOver the last few interim releases we have aligned the underlying tech stack\nof the desktop installer to use the same Subiquity back end as Ubuntu server,\ncreating a consistent codebase across both platforms to deliver feature parity\nand easier maintainability. This is complemented by a brand new front end\nbuilt in Flutter which has been iterated on significantly over the past year\nto improve access to accessibility options, increase clarity on the user\nexperience and deliver a polished and improved experience.\n\n### Additional encryption options\n\nAs part of this migration we\u2019ve brought ZFS guided install back as a\nfilesystem option and added support for ZFS encryption. We\u2019ve also added\nimproved guidance for dual-boot setups, particularly in relation to BitLocker.\nOne major request from users has been support for hardware-backed full disk\nencryption and it makes its first appearance in an experimental form in Ubuntu\n24.04 LTS. This implementation has certain limitations at launch which\nrestrict its use to those devices that only require a generic kernel with no\nthird party drivers or kernel modules, and does not currently support firmware\nupgrades. We intend to extend the hardware compatibility of this feature over\ntime within the lifecycle of this release, with support for NVIDIA drivers as\nour first priority.\n\n### Integrated autoinstall\n\nOne of the most exciting new additions is the surfacing of autoinstall support\nin the graphical installer. Users or enterprises who want to create a\ncustomised, repeatable, automated installation flow can now provide the\naddress of a local or remote autoinstall.yaml file and let Subiquity take over\nfrom there.\n\nCheck out this getting started tutorial to see how easy it is to automate\nuser-creation, install additional apps and configure your filesystem in a\nformat you can use across multiple machines.\n\nThis brings us a number of steps closer to the long term goal of zero touch\nprovisioning, and we plan to add additional support for SSO authentication to\naccess protected autoinstall files in a corporate environment at a later date.\n\n## New core apps\n\nThe new features don\u2019t stop once you\u2019ve installed Ubuntu Desktop. The new App\nCenter (also flutter-based) is another notable highlight, bringing a modern,\nmore performant new look to app discovery with clearer categories and\napplication management functionality. Since its initial launch, the App Center\nnow includes a new ratings service to allow users to vote on the quality of\ntheir apps and view an aggregated score from other users. These scores,\ncombined with the other rich meta-data available from the Snap Store, will\nmake it easier for us to deliver additional discovery mechanisms such as top\ncharts, most popular or recently updated.\n\nWhile the App Center defaults to a snap-centric view by default to enable us\nto deliver these usability features, you can still use it to find and install\ndeb packages via the search toggles.\n\nAs part of the new App Center development we\u2019ve split out firmware updates\ninto their own dedicated app. This not only allows a richer experience\nmanaging firmware but also improves performance since the old Ubuntu Software\napplication would need to remain permanently running in the background to\ncheck for new firmware on previous releases.\n\n## GNEW GNOME\n\nUbuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS continues our commitment to shipping the latest and\ngreatest GNOME with version 46. This release delivers a host of performance\nand usability improvements including file manager search and performance,\nexpandable notifications and consolidated settings options for easier access.\n\nAs usual, Ubuntu builds on the excellent foundation provided by GNOME with a\nnumber of extensions and additions. The colour picker allows users to tailor\ntheir desktop highlights to their taste, triple buffering improves performance\non Intel and Raspberry Pi graphics drivers and the addition of the Tiling\nAssistant extension enables quarter screen tiling support for better workspace\nmanagement.\n\n## Consistent networking across desktop and server with Netplan 1.0\n\nIn Ubuntu 23.10 we included Netplan as the default tool to configure\nnetworking on desktop, unifying the stack across server and cloud where\nNetplan has been the default since 2016. This change enables administrators to\nconsistently configure their Ubuntu estate regardless of platform. With the\nrecent release of Netplan 1.0, all platforms also benefit from new features\naround wireless compatibility and usability improvements such as netplan\nstatus \u2013diff.\n\nIt is important to note that Netplan does not replace NetworkManager and will\nnot impact workflows that prefer the previous configuration methods.\nNetworkManager has bidirectional integration with Netplan, meaning changes\nmade in either configuration are updated and reflected in both.\n\nYou can read more about this bidirectionality in Lukas\u2019 previous blog. To find\nout what\u2019s new in Netplan 1.0, check out his recent announcement.\n\n## Comprehensive GPO support with Active Directory\n\nUbuntu Desktop is highly prevalent in enterprise engineering and data science\nteams in enterprise, academic and federal institutions around the globe,\nwhilst Windows remains the corporate OS of choice for other departments.\nCanonical\u2019s Landscape is highly effective at monitoring, managing and\nreporting on the compliance of Ubuntu instances across desktop, server and\ncloud, however desktop IT administrators are often looking for solutions that\nhelp them manage mixed Ubuntu and Windows devices.\n\nOn-premise Active Directory has been the preferred management tool for Windows\nadministrators for many years, and still represents the majority share of\norganisations. User authentication with Active Directory on Linux has been a\nstandard for some time as part of the System Services Security Daemon (SSSD),\nhowever in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS we introduced additional support for Group Policy\nObjects (GPOs) allowing further compliance configuration. Over the course of\nour interim releases this GPO support has been expanded to cover the majority\ndevice and user policies requested by Active Directory administrators,\nincluding:\n\n  * Privilege management and removal of local admins\n  * Remote scripts execution\n  * Managing apparmor profiles\n  * Configuring network shares\n  * Configuring proxy settings\n  * Certificate autoenrollment\n\nIn addition to the pre-existing policies available on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This\ndelivers a best in class solution for administrators looking to empower their\ndevelopers with Ubuntu Desktop.\n\nGoing forward, our attention is now turning to support third party cloud-based\nidentity providers following a proof of concept implementation of Azure Active\nDirectory enrollment in Ubuntu 23.04. We are currently in the process of\nexpanding on the functionality delivered in that release as part of a new\nimplementation and look forward to talking more about that in the near future.\n\nFinally, for those developers who remain on Windows due to internal policy\nrequirements, we are continuing to invest in enterprise tooling for Ubuntu on\nWindows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Ubuntu 24.04 LTS supports cloud-init\ninstance initialisation, enabling administrators to seed custom config files\non their developer\u2019s machines to create standardised Ubuntu environments. This\nis a more robust solution than existing import/export workflows and represents\nthe first step toward future management and compliance tooling.\n\n## Secure software management in Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS\n\nUnderneath the hood, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS also includes a number of security\nimprovements for those developing and distributing software within the Ubuntu\necosystem. In Ubuntu 23.10 we landed a new version of software-properties that\nchanged the way Personal Package Archives (PPAs) are managed on Ubuntu.\n\nPPAs are a critical tool for development, testing and customisation, enabling\nusers to install software outside of the official Ubuntu archives. This allows\nfor a great deal of software freedom but also comes with potential security\nrisks due to the access they are granted to your OS. In Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, PPAs\nare now distributed as deb822-formatted.sources files with their signing key\ndirectly embedded into the file\u2019s signed-by field. This establishes a 1:1\nrelationship between the key and the repository, meaning one key cannot be\nused to sign multiple repositories and removing a repository also removes its\nassociated key. In addition, APT now requires repositories to be signed using\nstronger public key algorithms.\n\n### Unprivileged user namespace restrictions\n\nAnother significant security enhancement is the restriction of unprivileged\nuser namespaces. These are a widely used feature of the Linux kernel that\nprovide additional security isolation for applications that construct their\nown sandboxes, such as browsers which would then use that space to execute\nuntrusted web content. So far so good, however the ability to create\nunprivileged user namespaces can expose additional attack surfaces within the\nLinux kernel and has proven to be a step in a significant number of exploits.\nIn Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, AppAmor is now used to selectively control access to\nunprivileged user namespaces on a per application basis so that only\napplications with legitimate need can leverage this functionality.\n\nYou can read more about this change as well as a range of other security\nenhancements to the latest Ubuntu release in the security team\u2019s deep dive.\n\n### Improved proposed pocket\n\nThe proposed pocket is used as a staging area for software updates prior to\ntheir release to the wider Ubuntu user base. In the past this pocket has been\nan all-or-nothing experience, with users who opt in to updates from proposed\nneeding to take all updates that were available. As a result the chance of\nintroducing system instability was significantly increased, disincentivising\nthose who wanted to provide testing support for specific features in advance\nof their wider availability.\n\nIn Ubuntu 24.04 LTS we have lowered the default apt priority of updates in\n\u201cproposed\u201d to allow users to specify exactly which packages they want to\ninstall and which they want to remain stable. This change is designed to\nincrease the confidence of users who want to test specific features ahead of\ntheir general release.\n\n## Building the future, together\n\nThis brings us to the end of this deep dive into the motivations and decisions\nbehind just some of the features of the latest Long Term Supported release of\nUbuntu Desktop. It has been a challenging and exciting experience to see each\nof these building blocks come together over the last three interim releases.\nWith Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS our goal has been to build a platform ready to\nstand the test of time, and the foundation for your next, great open source\nproject.\n\nAs always, the story continues.
