I love\nthat the same technology is being used almost 30 years on.\n\nSo after buying a Wacom ArtPad II, which came with an original pen, out of\ncuriosity I bought a few different types of S-Pen to confirm the information I\nhad read.\n\nI hope his is useful to somebody who has an old Wacom tablet but is missing a\npen.\n\nA selection of pens compatible with my Wacom ArtPad II\n\nFrom top to bottom:\n\n  * The original pen that came with my Wacom ArtPad II.\n  * \u201cSamsung S-Pen with Eraser\u201d (here black, with eraser, about three quarters of the size of the original pen) cost \u00a310. Works well, including the eraser. I would class it as a very good replacement for the original pen.\n  * \u201cS-Pen For Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1\u201d (here black, a little smaller again, about a third or so the size of the original pen) cost \u00a35. This works just fine with my ArtPad II. The nib has ever so slightly more friction than the original pen but it\u2019s a good stand in. The shape is slightly flattened so it\u2019s comfortable for pointing, but not for drawing.\n  * \u201cS-Pen NOTE 1\u201d (here white, about the size of a Nintendo DS stylus) cost \u00a32. Too small to use for writing. However the one I received was broken, in that it was always clicking.\n\n## Notes\n\n  * Toshiba Tablet-PC pens are also known to be compatible\n  * There are many other third party Samsung-compatible pens available\n  * You might be able to rehouse the S-Pen, for example in a larger, 3D-printed body\n\n## Pen compatibility between models\n\n  * UltraPen, Cintiq pen, \u201cPenabled\u201d pen, ArtPad / UD / CT pen, or S-Pen are interchangeable (this is what I needed)\n  * Bamboo pens and Graphire pens are interchangeable\n  * Intuos3 pens can only be swapped with other Intuos3 pens\n\n## References\n\n  * 68kMLA forum topic\n  * greg-kennedy.com (plus comments)\n  * Bongofish wiki (archived page)\n  * Wacom Asia (archived PDF)\n\n\\-- Enjoyed this blog post?
