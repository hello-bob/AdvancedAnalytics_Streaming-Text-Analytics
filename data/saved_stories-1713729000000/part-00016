It becomes\ntiresome after a while, hearing the same arguments made verbatim across all\nentertainment. I\u2019ve heard them. You\u2019ve heard them. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no need to\ngo in depth here, but below are a few choice favorites from the latest\ncontroversy over female custodians:\n\nI quite love that last one. It is very reminiscent of \u201cStar Wars is a\nfranchise about space wizards!\u201d In my mind, it\u2019s one of the ugliest tactics\nthe Left will play. Even as they make a big deal about adding representation\nto a landmark IP, they will stomp on fans\u2019 faces and say they should accept\nthose changes because their favorite property is childish. Of course, if it\nwas only silly and childish, then the Left wouldn\u2019t have bothered to begin\nwith.\n\nThe rank and file Leftists are an interesting sort. Their unofficial job is to\nrun cover for these changes, making up obfuscating arguments, crying out for\ntheir own representation, and demoralizing and insulting the masses when they\nfail to get their way. They are ultimate of gaslighters, creating problems\nthat don\u2019t exist so companies can excusably kowtow to their \u201ccustomers\u201d. They\nare to convince you that what is happening is the will of the masses, and if\nthey can\u2019t do that, to beat you down and make you think your hobbies aren\u2019t\nworth fighting for.\n\nBut in 2024, I hope we\u2019ve learned the lesson that all entertainment is\nimportant, no matter how childish or silly it seems. Because if you care about\nsomething, that means it\u2019s a potential weapon the Left can and will turn\nagainst you. That investment in established IPs puts people in movie theaters.\nIt makes them subscribe to streaming services. It makes them purchase toys and\nclothing and merchandise. That investment is control over the masses, and the\nLeft love nothing more than using that to lecture to the untouchables.\n\nPut simply, diversity and inclusion are humiliation rituals. If they happen to\nfit in the established canon, then so much better. It\u2019s plausible deniability\nto gaslight those who don\u2019t know any better. But as the internet autists rush\nto say whether the representation does or does not fit in the lore, the rest\nof us know the real reason behind these changes.\n\nIt\u2019s to flex.\n\nIt\u2019s to say this thing that you love is no longer yours. It\u2019s ours, and there\nis nothing you can do about it. And it isn\u2019t a mistake or a well-meaning push\nfor a broader audience. It\u2019s to cause outrage. It\u2019s to scorn the people the\nLeft despise. It\u2019s civilizational trolling, and it\u2019s done because not only\nwon\u2019t they face consequences, they know they\u2019ll be rewarded for it.\n\nBut ultimately, this was a long time coming for Warhammer 40k. Female\ncustodians aren\u2019t the toppling of a based company finally succumbing to\nLeftist screeching. It\u2019s a victory lap after a very long and slow defeat. The\nbattle was lost long before any changes made their way into codexes or lore.\nIt was lost with the company\u2019s hiring practices, its changes in work culture,\nits phasing out of the old guard. Warhammer 40k was lost the way all IPs were\nlost\u2014with its HR department.\n\nEven so, I\u2019m not interested in covering the defeat of yet another IP and yet\nanother company. Warhammer 40k is not remarkable because it\u2019s turning woke.\nIt\u2019s remarkable because it\u2019s still turning woke in the year 2024. The question\nis not why we lost another hobby. The question is why Warhammer 40k lasted as\nlong as it did. And I think in pondering such a topic, we can find strategies\nto future proof our culture against the Leftist corrosion.\n\nTo begin, let\u2019s define the \u201cwoke\u201d as phenomenon. Many Leftists have made fun\nof the Right for frequently being unable to nail a solid definition, but\nthat\u2019s because wokeness isn\u2019t a coherent set of principles one can point to on\na paper somewhere. Anytime someone on the Right tries to encapsulate the\nconcept, the Left will deny it or otherwise reframe the discussion.\n\nPutting it simply, wokeness is an intersectional political coalition that is\nanti-Christian, anti-white, anti-masculine, and anti-hierarchical in nature.\nIt will take whatever outlying form to denigrate those concepts, whether that\nbe a feminist shitlib, an immigration advocate, or an oppressed trans person.\nWokeness is the dissolution of all ingrained distinction, cultural identity,\nand social norm into what the Right affectionally refers to as gay space\ncommunism. It is the homogenization of the human race into the same brownish\ndiversity cast, and if you want any proof of that, just look at what Hollywood\nproduces.\n\nPicture taken from Star Wars Acolytes\n\nAll woke entertainment looks alike. All woke entertainment speaks the same\nmessage. All woke entertainment smiles the same narcissistic grin to the\nmasses. This is because it is not an avenue to explore the human condition. It\nis the political propaganda of a system that can no longer deliver on its\npromises. We were promised the atheistic, rationalist utopia of Star Trek, and\ninstead we were delivered a society that can no longer speak basic truths for\nfear that it may be \u201cintolerant\u201d.\n\nWokeness is nothing more than a Leftist covering their ears and shouting \u201cNuh\nuh!\u201d to the concerned citizen noticing the increase in crime in their\nneighborhoods and their ever rising grocery bills. It is the denial of basic\ntruths, and therein lies the secret of claiming an independent culture from\nthe Left.\n\nHow is this anything but divine punishment?\n\nWarhammer 40k was resistant to the Left for so long because it was a universe\nthat (unintentionally) founded itself in very basic truths of mankind. And it\npresented those truths in such an obvious way that it was next to impossible\nfor the Left to deny. It is difficult for the woke to corrupt a property that\noutright acknowledges how the woke corrupts IPs to begin with.\n\nShall we raise a few examples? In 40k, there are the Chaos Gods which are the\nSci-Fi equivalent of the devil. The woke can try to depict heroic gay romances\nand represent obese persons, but to anyone with common sense, these narratives\nultimately twist themselves into the corruptions of Slaanesh and Nurgle (two\nof the Chaos Gods). In outlining the existence of a hell, the Right now has\nthe vocabulary (and the canon) to section off Leftist controlled portions of\nthe narrative.\n\nYou might have an atheistic character, but when the God-Emperor of Mankind is\nraising up saints, that character goes from a noble objector to a skeptic\nfool. When you create a definite good and evil in a fictional universe, then\nit becomes ever more difficult for the Left to pervert. And the more unabashed\nyou portray these truths, the more tenuous the Left\u2019s depictions become.\n\nThe Left can easily get away with perverting Star Wars because Star Wars is a\nquasi Buddhist Sci-Fi adventure. But what happens if there were definable\nuniversal constants that went against Leftist interpretations? What if the\nJedi Order were explicitly defined as a male only society and that to deviate\nfrom this was heresy? Yes, the Left can go and insert their narratives, but\nthere is now plausible deniability from the Right.\n\nWhat if we can create a fictional universe so grounded in obvious realities\nthat any Leftist interpretation could be canonically discarded as a sham? I\nknow there\u2019s no such thing as an airtight creation, but it would be a\ntremendous leap forward if we could create spaces resistant to Leftist\nencroachment. The concept of a Rightwing fictional universe has always been\ntantalizing, but what makes a fictional universe Rightwing? It is grounding\nthose narratives in the Truth.\n\nI don\u2019t have all the answers, but I think the future of Rightwing\nentertainment is creating properties which explore the truth in very basic\nways that the Left cannot. In acknowledging the truths of the human existence,\nwe can come to art that inherently resists Leftist adaption. In delving into\nthe deepest parts of the human condition, we can better understand the world\nand better condemn the perversion the Left wants to create.\n\nIt is in speaking the truth that we win, and I think... that might be enough.\n\nTrantor Publishing is a reader-supported publication.
