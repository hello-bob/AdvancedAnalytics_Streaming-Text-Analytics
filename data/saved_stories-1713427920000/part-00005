The keychain tracker takes a CR2023 battery; the card is not rechargeable.\n\nChipolo\n\n  * Pebblebee's trackers are all rechargeable.\n\nPebblebee\n\n  * Google's \"Find My Device\" app.\n\nGoogle\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nAfter an announcement that ended up being a year early, Android's version of\nTile/AirTags is ready to launch. Google has been gearing up on the software\nside of things to enable a Bluetooth tracking network on Android, and the\ncompany's two tracking tag hardware partners, Pebblebee and Chipolo, now have\nship dates. The two companies each have a press release today, with Pebblebee\nsaying its trackers will ship in \"late May,\" while Chipolo says it will ship\n\"after May 27th.\" Google has a blog post out, too, promising \"additional\nBluetooth tags from Eufy, Jio, Motorola and more\" later this year.\n\nBoth sets of devices have been up for preorder for a year now, and it doesn't\nseem like anything has changed since. Both companies are offering little\nBluetooth trackers in a keychain tag or credit card format, and Pebblebee has\na third stick-on tag format. They'll all be anonymously tracked by Android's 3\nbillion-device Bluetooth tracker network, and the device owner will be able to\nsee them in Google's \"Find my device\" app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChipolo's \"One Point\" key chain tag is the only thing that takes a CR2032 coin\ncell battery, while the company's credit card tracker is not rechargeable.\nPebblebee's key chain, credit card, and stick-on tracker all have rechargeable\nbatteries, including the wallet card, which is very rare! Nothing has UWB for\nprecise location tracking\u2014everything uses a speaker. Both companies sell\nmultiple SKUs of what look like the exact same product but are locked to\nGoogle's or Apple's network\u2014no switching allowed.\n\nThese were all supposed to come out in 2023 originally. Google's patch notes\nsay that the tracking network shipped in Android in December 2022, even though\nnothing is using it. The company has actually been waiting on Apple. In May\n2023, Google and Apple announced a joint standard for \"unknown tracker\"\nalerts. While the two networks will not be compatible, they will team up to\nalert users if a tracker is being used to stalk them. All this hardware was\nannounced a week later, but in July 2023, Google shipped what a spokesperson\ncalled, \"a custom implementation\" for AirTags (enabling Android phones to\nalert users to an unknown AirTag), and the company said it wouldn't enable its\ntracking network until the joint tracking detection standard with Apple was\nready. It looks like Apple will do that in iOS 17.5. iOS 17.5 is expected to\nbe out\u2014you guessed it\u2014at the end of May, so these tags can finally ship.\n\n9:00pm update: A Google spokesperson told us Google's July release of\nAndroid's unwanted AirTag detection is \"a custom implementation\" and not the\njoint standard.\n\nListing image by Chipolo\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n63\n\nRon Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in\nAndroid OS and Google products.
