There\u2019s Mr. Jones by\nCounting Crows, Beverly Hills by Weezer, Forever by Drake, among countless\nothers. But as much of a joke as they\u2019ve become in the culture, my favorite\nhas always been Nickelback\u2019s Rockstar. It\u2019s brutally honest - the protagonist\ndoesn\u2019t hide that he wants to be famous for entirely selfish, shallow reasons.\nHe\u2019s a vain prick who wants to fart out low-effort music and be rewarded with\nadoration, money, sex and drugs. It\u2019s an incredibly self-aware song for\nNickelback of all bands to have released.\n\nThey say that everybody wants to be famous, and the data bears it out. Surveys\nconsistently find that social media influencer is among young Americans\u2019 most\ndesired careers - along with other fame heavy jobs like musician or actor.\nThat\u2019s not a new phenomenon, of course. For generations we\u2019ve had aspiring\nactors moving to Hollywood, stage performers moving to NYC to shoot for\nBroadway, country music singers moving to Nashville, all chasing the dream of\nstardom. But the rise of social media has changed the nature of fame.\n\nIndustries like acting and music are sometimes called \u2018superstar\u2019 industries\nor \u2018glamor\u2019 industries. A tiny percentage of aspiring actors will become\nsuperstars, but most will end in total failure, waiting tables in Los Angeles\nand eventually dropping out of the industry altogether. That\u2019s always been the\ndeal - a very small chance at very big stardom.\n\nBut today, the entire economy of celebrity has been radically altered by the\nsocial internet. In the 1990s, getting your face in front of tens of thousands\nof people was an achievement reserved for a very few - in the movie Groundhog\nDay Bill Murray\u2019s character considers himself a celebrity simply because he\u2019s\na weatherman on a local news channel. But since the rise of YouTube, TikTok,\nInstagram, and Twitter, that level of micro-stardom is commonplace. On YouTube\nalone there are over 300,000 accounts with more than 100,000 subscribers, and\non Twitter there are hundreds of thousands of accounts with over 10,000\nfollowers.\n\nWhat social media has created is effectively a middle class of fame.\n\nFame is now fractal. There are still nationally famous A-list celebrities. But\nthere\u2019s also an upper-middle class of online celebrities now, with hundreds of\nthousands of followers. There\u2019s a middle class of internet fame composed of\nfolks with tens of thousands of followers. And there\u2019s even a lower-middle\nclass consisting of people who aren\u2019t really famous, but do have 5,000 or so\nfollowers. That audience size is more attention than they\u2019d ever get in real\nlife, and this kind of person will often have a few hit posts that have gone\n\u2018viral\u2019 for them. Lots of content creators are newly famous, for this new\ndefinition of fame.\n\nWhether it\u2019s thousands or millions, more people than ever are thinking about\nthe audiences they have. And that can be dangerous, because people who get\neven a little bit of fame should be afraid of their audiences.\n\nInterested in how the social internet works?

These internet personalities are often able to persuade their\naudiences, whether they\u2019re massively famous or just a little famous. But what\nwe don\u2019t think about enough is how much their audiences can influence them.\n\nIn his famous blog post Status as a Service, Eugene Wei \u2014 one of the most\nincisive analysts of social media systems \u2014 argues that the mass-marketing of\na chance at micro-celebrity is actually a successful social network\u2019s core\nbusiness model:\n\n> Can I use the social network to accumulate social capital?...And how do I\n> earn that status?...\n>\n> Read Twitter today and hardly any of the tweets are the mundane life updates\n> of its awkward pre-puberty years. We are now in late-stage performative\n> Twitter, where nearly every tweet is hungry as hell for favorites and\n> retweets, and everyone is a trained pundit or comedian. It's hot takes and\n> cool proverbs all the way down.\n\nHe\u2019s right. Twitter was originally imagined as a \u2018microblogging\u2019 site, where\npeople would share passing thoughts and and snippets from their everyday\nlives. We forget that because almost nobody uses it that way any more. Now,\nwe\u2019re all tweeting to get attention, to get likes, to be the funniest and\ncoolest personality, to go viral.\n\nRemember, the new landscape of social media fame is that it\u2019s fractal. People\nwho reach 1000 followers tweet with the same sense of heady exaltation as\nthose who reach 10,000 or 100,000. For most people, having a few thousand\npeople read what they write is far more attention than they\u2019ll ever get in\ntheir offline lives. Small scale virality is just as intoxicating as large\nscale virality.\n\nAnd this brings me to the main point of this post, which is that social media\ninfluencers, if they\u2019re not careful, can be manipulated by their audiences.\n\nIf you\u2019ve amassed a following, you\u2019ve probably got a niche of some kind.\nYou\u2019ve cultivated a specific audience based on your style of posting. Audience\nCapture is the phenomenon by which online personalities begin feeding\naudiences what they want to hear - and end up becoming beholden to them.\n\nThis is not necessarily as sinister as it sounds. Whenever influencers say\nsomething we like, we click the \u201clike\u201d button, or share it to our own\nfollowers. When we don\u2019t like it, we ignore it or criticize it in the replies\nand comments. This is just social media\u2019s equivalent of the Hayekian price\nmechanism \u2014 a distributed system of feedback that tells the take-generators\nwhich opinions are in demand. This is the marketplace of ideas, in a very\nliteral sense. (Note: Whether you think this is a good way to organize\nsociopolitical discourse is another question entirely.)\n\nWe all want to go viral, and as status-seeking monkeys we\u2019re all constantly\nsearching for what can help us do that. The natural outcome of all this is\nthat we end up posting what our followers want to hear - not what we actually\nthink.\n\nYou make a provocative post on some topic, and get more likes and shares than\nyou normally receive. You then make an even more provocative post, and it does\neven better. Social media is structurally set up to encourage extreme views\nand content, and before long you\u2019re posting about this issue constantly. You\nnever planned to become a rage-bait influencer on this particular topic, but\nthe alternative is to go back to your posts getting a pitiful amount of\nengagement, and you\u2019re not going to do that.\n\nThis temptation is especially strong in politics. Researchers have found that\nanimosity towards political out-groups is a powerful driver of engagement on\nFacebook and Twitter:\n\n> Social media may be creating perverse incentives for divisive content\n> because this content is particularly likely to go \u201cviral.\u201d We report\n> evidence that posts about political opponents are substantially more likely\n> to be shared on social media and that this out-group effect is much stronger\n> than other established predictors of social media sharing, such as emotional\n> language....Language about the out-group was a very strong predictor of\n> \u201cangry\u201d reactions (the most popular reactions across all datasets).\n\nThis audience capture phenomenon can even work in both directions. Outlandish\nhot takes can generate a lot of attention and engagement, and they can lock\nyou into a cycle where you\u2019re captured by your audience\u2019s expectations for how\nyou post. But they can also negatively polarize people against you. You don\u2019t\nhave to search far to find extreme takes polarizing normal people against\nwhatever the take happens to be:\n\nThis sort of thinking is dangerous for anyone who values independent thought.\nYou don\u2019t want to end up with your political views defined by whatever gets\nyou the most likes, or what you happen to have been negatively polarized\nagainst. But that\u2019s increasingly common in today\u2019s social landscape.\n\nThe most extreme cases of audience capture trend towards self-flanderization,\nwhere online creators become a parody of themselves. Consider the case of Nick\nPerry, aka Nikocado Avocado. Perry started his content career as a milquetoast\nvegan violin performer. But to his detriment, Perry tried doing a few mukbang\nvideos where he would eat large meals of various foods. His audience loved\nthem - and demanded more. Not just more mukbang content, but bigger meals,\nmore extreme eating challenges. Perry took up the challenge and created the\n\u2018Nikocado Avocado\u2019 personality. The end result, a few years later:\n\nNick Perry vs Nikocado Avocado\n\nI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a better way to hammer home the point - following your\naudience\u2019s cues blindly is actually dangerous. Beware your audience. They may\nlike you, but they\u2019re not necessarily good for you.\n\n##\n\nKill Your Darlings\n\nOne of the classic pieces of advice for any writer is to Kill Your Darlings.\nWriters are often very proud and protective of parts of their work - a\nparticularly clever turn of phrase, a certain character, a crazy plot twist.\nBut good writing is usually concise, and good storytelling is usually direct.\nAs a writer, you can\u2019t get too attached to some very clever thing if it hurts\nthe flow of your writing. You need to able to kill your darlings, no matter\nhow proud you are of them.\n\nOnline content creators should view not just their content, but also their\naudiences, through the lens of \u2018Kill Your Darlings\u2019. Maybe your followers\nexpect one thing from you. Maybe they\u2019ll be bored or angry if you post in a\ndifferent style, or with a different political slant. Maybe some will unfollow\nyou!\n\nPost how you want to post despite that. Make them angry. Kill your darlings,\ndrive away the audience that\u2019s trying to capture you.\n\nBut don\u2019t take it from me. Listen to Bo Burnham, one of the most artistically\ngifted comedians in the world today. Near the end of his special Make Happy,\nin a section filled with silly jokes about Pringles and Chipotle burritos, he\nsuddenly goes deep into his fear of the audience and how he feels stifled by\ntheir expectations: (starts at 5:00)\n\n> The truth is my biggest problem's you I want to please you - but I want to\n> stay true to myself I want to give you the night out that you deserve But I\n> want to say what I think and not care what you think about it A part of me\n> loves you Part of me hates you Part of me needs you Part of me fears you And\n> I don't think that I can handle this right now\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen a more painfully honest account of an artist\ngrappling with audience capture. Burnham feels the pressure to give his paying\naudience what they expect, but still wants be his authentic self. And I think\nwe could all learn something from him here.\n\nYou can respect your audience and be suspicious of them at the same time. You\ncan try to give them want they want, but you also shouldn\u2019t shy away from\noffending them. This applies to famous artists, but it also applies to micro-\ninfluencers. We\u2019re all a little bit famous these days, and that means we\u2019re\nall vulnerable to the dynamics of audience capture. So beware your audience.\n\nThanks to Noahpinion, who contributed to portions of this piece\n\nIf you enjoyed this piece, consider sharing it on social media!\n\nShare\n\n### Subscribe to Infinite Scroll\n\nBy Jeremiah Johnson \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nThe Power of Posting\n\n17 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n17\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Beware Your Audience\n\nwww.infinitescroll.us\n\n1\n\nShare\n\n1 Comment\n\nMike Kidwell9 hrs agoThat Nick Perry picture is one of the most depressing\nthings I've ever seen.
