It may just be because\nrestricting eating time means people eat fewer calories overall.\n\nIn a randomized-controlled trial, people who followed a time-restricted diet\nlost about the same amount of weight as people who ate the same diet without\nthe time restriction, according to a study published Friday in Annals of\nInternal Medicine.\n\nThe finding offers a possible answer to a long-standing question for time-\nrestricted eating (TRE) research, which has been consumed by small feeding\nstudies of 15 people or fewer, with mixed results and imperfect designs.\n\nThe new study\u2014led by Nisa Marisa Maruthur, an internal medicine expert at\nJohns Hopkins\u2014has its own limitations and, like any one study, isn't the last\nword on the matter. But \"it takes us one step closer to identifying the\nunderlying mechanisms of TRE,\" nutrition experts Krista Varady and Vanessa\nOddo of the University of Illinois wrote in an editorial accompanying the\nstudy. \"Using a controlled feeding design, Maruthur and colleagues show that\nTRE is effective for weight loss, simply because it helps people eat less.\"\n\nThe study involved 41 people, 21 who followed a time-restricted diet for 12\nweeks and 20 who ate a usual eating pattern (UEP). Most of the participants\nwere Black women (93 percent) with obesity and either pre-diabetes or diet-\ncontrolled diabetes, limiting the generalizability of the findings. But the\nstudy carefully controlled what and when the participants ate; each\nparticipant got controlled meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack) with\nidentical macro- and micro-nutrients. Each participant was assigned a calorie\nlevel for their meals based on an established, standardized equation that\nestimates baseline caloric need. They were told to maintain their current\nexercise level, which was monitored with a wrist-worn accelerometer.\n\n## No magic necessary\n\nIn the time-restricted group, people only ate in a 10-hour window between 8 am\nand 6 pm, with 80 percent of their total daily calories consumed before 1 pm.\nIn the usual eating group, people ate between 8 am and midnight, with 55\npercent of their calories eaten after 5 pm for dinner and a night-time snack.\nIn each eating group, participants were given specific windows of a couple of\nhours in which they should eat each pre-made meal. The participants ate three\nmeals each week at a research site, where dieticians addressed adherence\nissues, and their eating was carefully monitored with the use of food diaries\nand urine tests. Approximately 96 percent of people in both groups followed\nthe schedules to within 30 minutes. Diet adherence\u2014eating all their assigned\nfood and not eating outside food\u2014was also high, with 93 percent in the time-\nrestricted group and 95 percent in the usual eating group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end of the 12 weeks, both groups lost about the same amount of weight,\nan average of around 2.4 kg (5.3 pounds), with no statistically significant\ndifference between the two groups. The researchers also found no differences\nbetween the two groups in their glucose homeostasis, waist circumference,\nblood pressure, or lipid levels.\n\n\"Our results indicate that when food intake is matched across groups and\ncalories are held constant, TRE, as operationalized in our study, does not\nenhance weight loss,\" Maruthur and her colleagues concluded. The authors are\nupfront about the limitations of the study, though, noting that the results\ncould have been different in different groups of people and potentially in\nshorter time-restricted windows, such as eight hours instead of 10. They\ncalled for more research to explore those questions.\n\nOutside experts applauded the study while also adding that it's not\nsurprising. \"The headline finding that TRE does not magically lead to more\nweight loss sounds sensational but is also obvious,\" Adam Collins, a nutrition\nexpert at the University of Surrey, said.\n\nNaveed Sattar, a professor of cardiometabolic medicine at the University of\nGlasgow, called the study \"well done.\" It \"tells us what we expected\u2014that\nthere is nothing magical about time-restricted eating on weight change other\nthan effects to reduce caloric intake,\" he said. \"If time-restricted eating\nhelps some people eat less calories than they would otherwise, great.\"\n\nThe experts Varady and Oddo, meanwhile, see it as a boon for anyone trying to\nlose weight. \"Many patients stop following standard-care diets (such as daily\ncalorie restriction) because they become frustrated with having to monitor\nfood intake vigilantly each day,\" they wrote in their commentary. \"Thus, TRE\ncan bypass this requirement simply by allowing participants to 'watch the\nclock' instead of monitoring calories while still producing weight loss.\" It's\na \"simplified\" and \"accessible\" dietary strategy that anyone can follow,\nincluding lower-resource populations, the researchers wrote.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n164\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
