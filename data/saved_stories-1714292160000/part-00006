A GitHub employee assured me that\nthey would take action, but it appears that those actions have failed.\n(#42869)Please fix.Edit 1: I'd also like to note the amount of unrelated\ndiscussions being started here, from random users most likely on the wrong\nrepo to outright scams being present here, it seems that GitHub isn't\nmoderating content being posted on their site very well.  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

As far as I can find there's only an option to\nreport specific user.Given the fact that most email services won't sent GitHub\nemails to spam, these scams/spams are quite effective in regard to\npenetrability \ud83d\ude0f  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

I am aware that these are a phishing\nattack. But it's getting annoying.As a society, it would be beneficial for\neveryone to be informed. We can be absent-minded. Please do not forget;An\norganization like Github will not send you this type of email! Be careful when\ngranting permissions to your Github account and the bots, tools, and other\ncontent you want to add. Check out the tools.How can we as a community help\nyou further @github?Additionally, efforts were made to fulfill the same issue\nand PR demands through my projects. Is there a way to temporarily turn off the\nnotification email for my own repos?  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

When it is done from my open source\nprojects, the e-mail is sent through my project. That's when I get very\nuncomfortable. I should be able to intervene.  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful? Give feedback.\n\nSign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.
