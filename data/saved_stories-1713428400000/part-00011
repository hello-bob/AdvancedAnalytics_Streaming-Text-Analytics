This update includes context window\nexpansions, a new chat interface, easier ways to add context to chat, new\nmodels, and more.\n\n## Bigger and better context windows to improve chat\n\nWe\u2019ve historically limited Cody to a maximum context window of 7,000 tokens,\nmeaning that Cody won\u2019t pass more than 7,000 tokens (small chunks of text) to\nthe underlying LLMs. This is mostly to make sure that too much context isn\u2019t\npassed into the LLM, which can lead to poor context recall and then poor\nanswer quality.\n\nBecause of Claude 3\u2019s improved context recall, we can now expand that context\nwindow without degrading chat quality. We\u2019ve made huge updates to Cody\u2019s\nmaximum context window for Claude 3 Sonnet and Opus models:\n\n  * 30,000 tokens of user-defined context (user @-mentioned files)\n  * 15,000 tokens of continuous context (user messages and context that's sent back to the LLM to help it recall earlier parts of a continuous conversation)\n\nNote: One line of code converts to roughly 7.5 tokens, so these limits are\napproximately 4,000 and 2,000 lines of code, respectively.\n\nThis update means two things:\n\n  * You can now push way more context into Cody, including multiple large files, so you can ask questions about larger amounts of code\n  * You can have much longer back-and-forth chats with Cody before it starts to forget context from earlier in the conversation\n\nWe\u2019ve also increased the output token limit for all messages generated by\nCody\u2019s underlying LLMs. Outputs were previously limited to 1,000 tokens, and\nwe\u2019ve quadrupled it to 4,000 tokens. This means you shouldn\u2019t see Cody's\nresponses getting cut off mid-answer anymore. This update applies to all\nmodels and for all tiers of Cody users.\n\n## Revamped chat interface\n\nThe chat interface is getting a new look! Cody\u2019s chat log is now structured as\na series of cells, each showing a message alongside the sender's avatar. When\nSourcegraph fetches context to use in a request, Cody shows the context in a\ncell alongside the Sourcegraph avatar.\n\n## Unit test command improvements for JS, TS, Go, and Python\n\nWe\u2019ve improved Cody\u2019s unit test command for JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and\nPython code in two ways:\n\n  1. Cody will now determine the correct range of code to apply the command to based on the code syntax\n  2. When you trigger a Quick Action (Ctrl + ./Cmd + .) on a function symbol, Cody will now given an option to generate a unit test\n\n## Add context to chat using right-click\n\nYou can now grab code from the open file and use it as context in chat without\nhaving to manually @-mention it.\n\nHighlight the code you want to use, then right-click -> \u201cCody Chat: Add as\ncontext.\u201d The highlighted file range will be added as an @-mention in the chat\nsidebar.\n\n## New model support: GPT-4 Turbo and Mixtral 8x22B\n\nMistral just released Mixtral 8x22B, their latest open source model, and it\u2019s\nnow available as a chat option for Cody Pro users. The model scores highly in\nmath & coding benchmarks, particularly among open models.\n\nWe\u2019ve also upgraded Cody\u2019s GPT-4 Turbo model from the preview version to the\nnewer, non-preview version.\n\n## Experimental support for CodeGemma + Ollama\n\nYou can now use CodeGemma models via Ollama with Cody. The CodeGemma family\nsupports fill-in-the-middle code completion and can be used to power Cody\u2019s\nautocomplete functionality.\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee the changelog and GitHub releases for a complete list of changes.\n\n## Thank you\n\nCody wouldn\u2019t be what it is without our amazing contributors \ud83d\udc96 A big thank you\nto everyone who contributed, filed issues, and sent us feedback.\n\nAs always, we value your feedback in our support forum, Discord and GitHub.\nHappy Codying!\n\nTo get started with Cody install it from the VS Code Marketplace\n\n### Get Cody, the AI coding assistant\n\nCody makes it easy to write, fix, and maintain code.\n\nLearn more\n\n## Products\n\n  * Cody\n  * Code Search\n\n## Solutions\n\n  * Enterprise\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Blog\n  * Library\n  * Customer stories\n  * Changelog\n  * Documentation\n  * Community\n  * Support forum\n\n## Company\n\n  * About\n  * Careers - We're hiring!\n  * Contact\n  * Handbook\n  * Sourcegraph strategy\n\n  * \u00a9 2024 Sourcegraph, Inc.\n  * Terms\n  * Security\n  * Privacy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
