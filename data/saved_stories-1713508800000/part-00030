G\u00f3rny wrote that the spread of\nthe \"\"AI bubble\"\" indicated a need for Gentoo to formally take a stand on AI\ntools. After a lengthy discussion, the Gentoo Council voted unanimously this\nweek to adopt his proposal and ban contributions generated with AI/ML tools.\n\n#### The case against\n\nIn his RFC, he laid out three broad areas of concern: copyrights, quality, and\nethics. On the copyright front, he argued that LLMs are trained on copyrighted\nmaterial and the companies behind them are unconcerned with copyright\nviolations. \"\"In particular, there's a good risk that these tools would yield\nstuff we can't legally use.\"\"\n\nHe questioned the quality of LLM output, though he did allow that LLMs might\n\"\"provide good assistance if you are careful enough\"\". But, he said, there's\nno guarantee contributors are aware of the risks. He minced no words about his\nview of the ethics of the use of AI. G\u00f3rny took issue with everything from the\nenergy consumption driven by AI to labor issues and \"\"all kinds of spam and\nscam\"\". The only reasonable course of action, he said, would be to ban the use\nof those tools altogether in creating works for Gentoo:\n\n> In other words, explicitly forbid people from using ChatGPT, Bard, GitHub\n> Copilot, and so on, to create ebuilds, code, documentation, messages, bug\n> reports and so on for use in Gentoo.\n\nHe added that this only extended to works created expressly for the Gentoo\nproject, and did not encompass upstream projects using things like ChatGPT.\nAndreas K. H\u00fcttel asked whether there were objections to packaging AI software\nfor Gentoo. This did not elicit a response in favor or against on the list,\nbut the AI policy page expressly mentions that the policy does not prohibit\npackaging AI-related software.\n\n#### Is this necessary?\n\nRich Freeman wrote that he thought it made sense to consider the use of AI,\nbut suggested the Gentoo developer certificate of origin (DCO) already had the\nnecessary language to prohibit AI-generated contributions. \"\"Perhaps we ought\nto just re-advertise the policy that already exists?\"\" He also poked at the\nethical case laid out by G\u00f3rny, and suggested it would alienate some\ncontributors even if the majority of the project was in favor. Freeman said it\nwas not a bad idea to reiterate that Gentoo didn't want contributions that\nwere just piped out of a GPT application into forums, bug reports, commits,\netc., but didn't think that it required any new policy.\n\nUlrich Mueller replied that there is overlap with existing policy, but did not\nfind it redundant and supported the idea of a clarification on how to deal\nwith AI-generated code. Sam James agreed with the proposal but worried that it\nwas \"\"slightly performative [...] given that we can't really enforce it\".\"\nG\u00f3rny wrote that it was unlikely that the project could detect these\ncontributions, or that it would want to actively pursue finding them. The\npoint, he said, is to make a statement that they are undesirable.\n\nOskari Pirhonen wanted to know about cases where a contributor uses ChatGPT to\nhelp with writing documentation or commit messages (but not code) because they\ndon't have \"\"an excellent grasp of English\"\". If those contributions\nexplicitly called out AI-generated content, would those be acceptable? G\u00f3rny\nsaid that would not help much, and dismissed the quality of content generated\nby ChatGPT. Mueller wanted to know where the line was: \"\"Are translation tools\nlike DeepL allowed? I don't see much of a copyright issue for these.\"\"\n\nIn a rare dissent, Matt Jolly responded that Gentoo would always have poor\nquality contributions, and could simply use common sense to filter out low-\nquality LLM material. \"\"We already have methods for weeding out low quality\ncontributions and bad faith contributors - let's trust in these and see what\nwe can do to strengthen these tools and processes.\"\" He argued in favor of\nusing LLMs for code documentation and asked why he had to type out an\nexplanation of what his code does if an LLM can generate something that only\nrequires some editing. The proposal, he said, was a bad idea and banning LLMs\n\"\"at this point is just throwing the baby out with the bathwater\"\". Guidelines\nwould be fine, even a ban on completely AI-generated works, but he was opposed\nto \"\"pre-emptively banning useful tools\"\".\n\nJames replied that tools trained on Gentoo's current repository should be OK,\nas well as using LLMs to assist with commit messages. But, he said, a lot of\nFOSS projects were seeing too much AI spam and were not interested in picking\nthe \"\"possibly good\"\" parts out.\n\nDavid Seifert responded in support of the RFC and asked if it could be added\nto the next Gentoo Council meeting agenda. G\u00f3rny said that he had been asked\nfor a specific motion and provided this language:\n\n> It is expressly forbidden to contribute to Gentoo any content that has been\n> created with the assistance of Natural Language Processing artificial\n> intelligence tools. This motion can be revisited, should a case been made\n> over such a tool that does not pose copyright, ethical and quality concerns.\n\n#### Approved\n\nGiven the ratio of comments in favor of banning AI-generated contributions to\nobjections to such a ban, it is not surprising that the council voted to\naccept G\u00f3rny's proposal. Now the question is how Gentoo implements the ban. In\nan emailed response to questions, G\u00f3rny said that Gentoo is relying on trust\nin its contributors to adhere to the policy rather than trying to police\ncontributions to see if they were generated with AI/ML tools:\n\n> In both cases, our primary goal is to make it clear what's acceptable and\n> what's not, and politely ask our contributors to respect that. If we receive\n> contributions that contain really \"weird\" mistakes, the kind that [do not]\n> seem likely to be caused by a human error, we're going to start asking\n> questions, but I think that's the best we can do.\n\nAs AI/ML continues to dominate the tech industry's agenda, Gentoo is unusual\nin looking to shut it out rather than trying to join the party. How well the\npolicy works, and how soon it is tested, will be interesting to see.\n\n> Did you like this article?

And anything\nbeyond that half-broken prompt will be assumptions on the AI side that humans\nare going to waste time reading and finding mostly consistent until they read\nthe code and figure the description might not even match! Wasting even more\ntime.\n\nI'm sorry but words have meaning. Using AI as a fluff generator is probably\nthe worst disrespect you can show to your reader. I much prefer broken\nEnglish.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 17:40 UTC (Thu) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\nSo much for theory. And now, any practical example of this AI-driven spammy\ncontribution? In the projects I watch closely, the situation you and the\narticle are describing, is mostly purely theoretical. To me it seems like a\nsignal that there are enough contributors to the project, when they can raise\nbarriers to avoid problems that aren't even there.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 17:40 UTC (Thu) by atnot (subscriber, #124910) [Link]\n\nI personally increasingly feel like this is going to solve itself when the\ncompanies that offer these services start charging for their actual cost.\nInstead of subsidizing it as they do now under the assumption that it'll give\nthem a valuable market position, increase their valuation with hype and that\nthe models will soon be obsolete and replaced by magitudes better and cheaper\nones anyway etc.\n\nIt's just kind of hard to imagine someone paying $100/mo or sitting there with\ntheir GPU roaring for hours on end while coding just for some moderately\nimproved autocomplete.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 17:54 UTC (Thu) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\nUmm, haven't they said the same thing about the shared e-scooters, ride-\nsharing, couch-sharing, etc.? That it will solve itself? :)\n\nAs long as there are always new investors ready to pour resources in, it won't\nsolve itself, certainly not in the way you think. They might actually manage\nto make inference dirt cheap, so they could afford to stay at these\nsubscription levels, while even making profit. I don't see why not. The\nhardware hasn't even really started moving in the direction of cheaper\ninference yet, but it will.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 17:58 UTC (Thu) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\nbtw the improved autocomplete from Github is $100/year, not $100/month - and\nso far, at least to me, it's been worth every penny :)\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 18:00 UTC (Thu) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\n(*and* I got three RTX 3090 sitting around here just so that I can play around\nthese so-called improved autocompletes :D weren't even that expensive, 2nd\nhand from a miner)\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 18:55 UTC (Thu) by atnot (subscriber, #124910) [Link]\n\nSorry, but $100 is just nowhere near enough to cover the cost of running these\nthings. Microsoft charges their enterprise customers roughly 4x that and not\neven they have remotely turned a profit on it. In fact to my knowledge, not a\nsingle company has ever turned a profit with an LLM offering at any price\npoint. And they'd be yelling it from the rooftops if they did.\n\nIt's also notable that even at that price, they have to give deep discounts to\nenterprise customers so that they can proudly announce companies like McKinsey\ngetting on board. Not because they have any use for it either mind you, but to\nbe able to \"better answer our customers questions about AI\".\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 21:17 UTC (Thu) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\nAt that scale, they also have massive opportunities to optimize and cut the\ntotal amount of work they need to do, just by looking at the data that goes\nthrough and balancing it against the compute costs (using heuristics, for\nexample, how often is the suggested code accepted, etc.).\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 17:42 UTC (Thu) by Karellen (subscriber, #67644) [Link]\n\nFrom Matt Jolly's email linked in the article:\n\n> we're always going to have BS/Spam PRs and bugs - I don't really think that\n> the content being generated by LLM is really any worse.\n\nIsn't part of the issue with LLMs not just that the quality can be low, but\nthat the quantity of low-quality submissions jumps by orders of magnitude if\nLLM-powered submissions are allowed? See, for example, Clarkesworld ceasing to\naccept submissions altogether because of the volume of low-quality LLM-powered\ndross.\n\nAlso, doesn't explicitly banning LLM-generated contributions simplify the\nrejection process? If it's allowed provided the quality is good enough, you\ncould end up spending way too much time arguing with bad-faith actors about\nwhether the contributions they submitted are good enough or not. Whereas being\nable to just say \"Policy says no.\" makes dealing with such people a lot more\nstraightforward.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 18:59 UTC (Thu) by atai (subscriber, #10977) [Link]\n\n>Isn't part of the issue with LLMs not just that the quality can be low, but\nthat the quantity of low-quality submissions jumps by orders of magnitude\n\nnot really true in the context of spam generation (so not directly comparable\nto FOSS contribution but still matters) AI has improved the quality to make it\npossible to democratize good spam among all spammers.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 19:32 UTC (Thu) by flussence (subscriber, #85566) [Link]\n\nCopyright and ethics, sure; it's well documented at this point LLMs will steal\nentire chunks of GPLed code wholesale with the serial numbers filed off, and\ntheir proponents are so far up their own asses that not even a bolt of\nlightning and voice from the heavens would get them to shut up. The purpose of\nthe system is what it does: which is to steal labour from the undercompensated\nin novel ways outside the law. Much like Open SourceTM has become.\n\nBut I don't think Gentoo has a leg to stand on regarding contribution quality,\nnot while nobody seems to mind all the low-effort automated spam coming from\nwithin the house. The bugzilla is littered with tens of thousands of script-\ngenerated snowclone \"QA\" reports (not to be confused with clear, proofread,\nactionable bug reports), and almost nobody reads them, let alone acts on them,\nbecause the signal-to-noise ratio is somewhere between a windows UAC prompt\nand ph*ronix. Drive-by spamming one of the single digit bug IDs should've been\na massive wake up call that this process is FUBAR, but alas.\n\nHow much does all that *cost*? The project still can't even scrape together\nenough resources or willing contributors to upgrade or moderate its phpbb2\nforums, for so long that it's statistically likely that a few people who once\nmade fun of what a farce it is may have died of old age at this point.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 20:50 UTC (Thu) by kleptog (subscriber, #1183) [Link]\n\nHonestly, this feels like a rerun of the \"you can't use a spell/grammer\nchecker on your school assignment because that's cheating\". Right now people\nare using prompts in chatbots, but in a few years it will be seamlessly\nintegrated into all sorts of products. It's only going to get faster and\ncheaper as time goes on.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 21:04 UTC (Thu) by mb (subscriber, #50428) [Link]\n\n>but in a few years it will be seamlessly integrated into all sorts of\nproducts\n\nRight. That won't resolve the open questions, though.\n\nJust processing copyrighted material through some sort of \"AI\" filter should\nnot make the Copyright go away. Or alternatively, any program processing any\ndata shall be allowed to remove Copyright. Cannot choose both.\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 21:14 UTC (Thu) by snajpa (subscriber, #73467) [Link]\n\n> Right. That won't resolve the open questions, though.\n\nI have a feeling that trend is going to accelerate. Open questions kinda\nrendered \"obsolete\" by even more pressing new open questions :-D\n\n### Gentoo bans AI-created contributions\n\nPosted Apr 18, 2024 22:22 UTC (Thu) by Wol (subscriber, #4433) [Link]\n\n> Honestly, this feels like a rerun of the \"you can't use a spell/grammer\n> checker on your school assignment because that's cheating\".\n\nMy feeling in all of this is IFF you use an AI to help you write a valid\nreport (of whatever sort) that's fine. The AI is the *assistant*. If, however,\nthe AI is the *author* then you don't want to go near it with a barge pole.\n\nIn other words, if there is a *human* involved, who has sanity checked it for\nhallucinations, accuracy, what-have-you, then that's fine. If the human\nsending it can't be bothered, then why should the human receiving it bother,\neither? And if it's the AI bot that's sending it, then you REALLY don't want\nto know!\n\nCheers, Wol\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, Eklektix, Inc. Comments and public postings are copyrighted\nby their creators.
