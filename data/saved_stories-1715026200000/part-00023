Back of the envelope numbers are fine!\"\n\nSome emails bounced back.\n\nSome went unanswered.\n\nBut five coders wrote back.\n\nThis turned out to be a tiny study, but given the great code these folks have\nwritten, I think the results are interesting--and a testament to practice!\n\nName| GitHubId| Hours| YearOfEstimate| BornIn  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nDonald Knuth| 56000| 2013| 1938  \nRob Pike| robpike| 30000| 2013| 1956  \nPeter Norvig| norvig| 30000| 2013| 1956  \nStephen Wolfram| 50000| 2013| 1959  \nLars Bak| larsbak| 30000| 2013| 1965  \n  \n# My Conclusion\n\nNo evidence has been found that the 10,000 hour strategy is flawed. :)\n\n# Thank You\n\nI hope these data points can encourage other aspiring programmers as much as\nthey encouraged me.\n\nI am eternally grateful to the programmers who responded.\n\nBack then I was 5 years into my programming career, I had passed 10,000 hours\nof practice, and was starting to worry that the \"10,000 hour strategy\" I had\nbeen following and telling other aspiring programmers to follow may have been\nin vain, because I was still a pretty bad programmer (many would argue that\ntoday, 6 years later, I'm not much better, but now I can say that's just\nbecause I only have 29,000 hours of practice).\n\nThese busy coders answered my cold emails with not just a number but many\nencouraging words and thoughts.\n\nOne of my favorite responses was from Peter Norvig, who sent me a Python\nprogram computing his estimate:\n\n# sum(years * (hours/week)) * (weeks/year) (4 * 10 # college + 2 * 30 # first\njob + 5 * 20 # grad school + 6 * 20 # faculty, research faculty + 6 * 25 #\nprogramming jobs + 15 * 10 # management jobs ) * 48\n\nThank you everyone!\n\n\u2042\n\n# Notes\n\nI promised I would compile the responses and publish the results to the public\ndomain.\n\nBut, while waiting for more responses to trickle in, I slowly forgot about\nthis project.\n\nUntil this morning (7/18/2019), when I stumbled upon one of those old emails.\n\nSorry for the delay!\n\n# Related Posts\n\n  * Why 10,000 hours?
