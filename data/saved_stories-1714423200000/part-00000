Credit: Lilian de Oliveira Guimar\u00e3es/Instituto Pasteur\n\nThe technology used to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at record speed early in the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has been successfully tested as a technique to monitor\narboviruses and diseases transmitted mainly by mosquitoes.\n\nIn an article published in the journal Microbial Genomics, researchers\naffiliated with Pasteur Institute in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and the University of\nS\u00e3o Paulo (USP), in collaboration with colleagues at the University of\nBirmingham in the United Kingdom, describe the use of the technology to\nsequence viral RNA and DNA from blood-engorged mosquitoes collected in S\u00e3o\nPaulo city with the aim of finding out how arboviruses circulate as a basis\nfor predicting future outbreaks of dengue, zika, chikungunya and yellow fever,\namong other diseases.\n\n\"The study proved the concept that it's possible to use metagenomics\n[sequencing the genetic material of all organisms in an environment at the\nsame time without isolating them] to analyze samples from invertebrates.\nPreviously, it was used to analyze samples from vertebrates [such as humans\nand other primates]. Our protocol can reveal viral diversity and identify\nmosquito species while also analyzing their feeding habits, and has the\npotential to extend our understanding of insect genetic diversity and the\ndynamics of arbovirus transmission,\" said Karin Kirchgatter, a researcher at\nPasteur Institute (S\u00e3o Paulo) who coordinated the study jointly with Nicholas\nJ. Loman, Professor of Microbial Genomics and Bioinformatics at the University\nof Birmingham.\n\nThe protocol was developed by researchers affiliated with the Brazil-UK Center\nfor Arbovirus Discovery, Diagnosis, Genomics and Epidemiology (CADDE).\n\nAnother key member of the research team was Ester Sabino, a professor at USP.\nSabino led the first sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil (in March 2020) and\ngenomic analysis of the first cases of infection by the gamma variant in\nManaus, the capital of Amazonas state, about a year later.\n\n\"The success of the tracking test was important. It showed that the technology\ncan also be used to investigate arboviruses rapidly and efficiently. The test\nwasn't surveillance but the technique will be an important part of it. We also\nadded information of various kinds, such as epidemiological data, as a basis\nfor predicting new outbreaks of disease,\" Sabino said.\n\n## How it works\n\nNanopore sequencing allows for real-time analysis of long DNA or RNA\nfragments. It works on the principle of minute changes in electric current\nwhen the nucleotides of a single-stranded DNA molecule are pulled through a\nnanopore, a tiny hole (on the order of 1 nanometer in internal diameter) that\nis made up of certain transmembrane cellular proteins.\n\nThe amount of change in current is characteristic for each nucleotide. The\nchange in the current is directly read, and the sequence is determined by\ndetecting changes in the current specific to the base in question. The results\ncan be compared to genetic sequencing databases to determine the details of\ninterest, such as the species from which the sample was taken.\n\n\"The technique is still expensive. No genetic sequencing technology can be\nconsidered low-cost to date. With time and expanding use, the cost will come\ndown,\" said Jeremy Mirza, a researcher at the University of Birmingham and\nfirst author of the article. He is also affiliated with CADDE.\n\nReal-time metagenomics can be used to detect emerging viruses and unknown\npathogens in samples taken from patients, without requiring reagents developed\nspecifically for certain microorganisms, as do conventional tests.\n\nThe protocol described in the article identifies vectors, viruses and hosts by\nmeans of a portable device that can be used in future to look for pathogens in\nremote areas. For the first time, it has now been used to identify not just\nthe virus and mosquito species in a sample, but also the contents of the\nmosquito's blood meal.\n\n\"We tested the technology on samples collected at the S\u00e3o Paulo zoo, a\nbiodiversity hotspot and hence an interesting area for this type of study. The\ndiversity of vectors and blood meal sources is huge. Large numbers of people\nare continuously on the move there, it's a stopover for many migratory birds,\nand it's also a controlled location with a known number of animals and\nspecies. The mosquitoes can be tracked as they move through the zoo on the\nbasis of the blood on which they feed,\" Kirchgatter explained.\n\nThe samples analyzed in the study came from engorged mosquitoes collected at\nthe zoo in 2015 and had already been analyzed using traditional techniques.\n\"This enabled us to compare the results and the time taken in each stage of\nthe process,\" said Lilian de Oliveira Guimar\u00e3es, second author of the article\nand a researcher at Pasteur Institute.\n\n\"In 2015, we analyzed each mosquito individually, identifying the species by\nclassical taxonomy, sequencing specific regions of each specimen and comparing\nthe sequences manually. This took weeks. With the new methodology, molecular\nidentification is feasible in real time. It identifies and correlates species\nand feeding preferences, as well as the viruses present in the insect,\" she\nadded.\n\nAccording to the authors, the positive results of the arbovirus tracking test\nopen the door to further research and discoveries. Combining information about\nmosquito genetic diversity and the transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne\nviruses presents an opportunity to link novel arboviruses to the mosquito\nvectors of these pathogens.\n\n\"Further, it can be used to identify animals that may be infected by these\nviruses and point to risks of spillover into human populations,\" the\nresearchers note. \"The portability of the technology permits discovery of\nnovel arboviruses in remote environments, and the method can form the basis of\nan early warning detection system by identifying arboviruses before they\nspread into human populations, providing a system for preempting future\narboviral epidemics.\"\n\nMore information: Jeremy D.
