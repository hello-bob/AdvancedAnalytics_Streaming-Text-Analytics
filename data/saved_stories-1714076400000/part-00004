Part 2 was about\ndigital security basics. I\u2019ll now explain what I do to protect my mind from\ngoing crazy with overstimulation from computers. This completes a trifecta of\nbasic defense tutorials: privacy, security, focus.\n\n### Light Tech Threat Model\n\nWe spend disproportionately little energy defending our attention compared to\nour health, family and money. Attention is a scarce resource that needs to be\ndefended viciously. Advertisers want to change your behavior. Apps want to\nmake you spend your time using them. Attacks are automated, continuous, multi-\npronged and AI-assisted. You should then treat access to your brain as a high-\npriority asset.\n\nI realized that in the past years I had been wasting a lot of time and\nattention on things that didn\u2019t matter, and that this was negatively affecting\nmy overall wellbeing. I feelt I was struggling to keep up with:\n\n  * Being up to date with tech.\n  * Staying in touch with friends an colleagues.\n  * Focusing for long stretches of time on a single task.\n\nOur brains were not designed to gobble this much information every day. You\nwouldn\u2019t eat 4,000 calores of sugar a day. That is, unless you want to be\nobese. You can\u2019t expect your brain to consume huge amounts of (financial,\nnews, social) information without being \u201cmentally obese\u201d. You\u2019ll suddenly\nrealize you can\u2019t read long articles or concentrate for a long time. Your\nattention span drops year after year. You can\u2019t even get yourself to read\nbooks anymore. You\u2019re the mental equivalent of a fat person who can\u2019t run to\ncatch a bus.\n\nThe solution is to protect your attention from attacks. The security model and\nlanguage is useful here. Security means protecting something you value. For\nexample, physical security is about protecting our bodies from harm, and\nproperty from theft. Privacy is information security, protecting information\nwe value. There\u2019s no specific word, however, for the practice of securing our\nattention. I propose the following name: Attention control (ATTSEC)\n\n## Techniques. TL;DR\n\nLet\u2019s get down to actual techniques. Usual disclaimers: these worked for me,\nmay not for you, etc. Again, I tried ordering tips from basic to hardcore.\nFollow along until you feel good about your protection level.\n\n  1. Disable all notifications\n  2. Snooze emails aggressively\n  3. Avoid news\n  4. Avoid or tame social media\n  5. Use uBlock to tailor the web\n  6. Archive conversations in messaging apps\n  7. Use browser tab groups\n  8. Take your time to respond or react\n  9. Schedule specific times to check email and social media\n  10. No-screen Fridays\n\n### 1\\. Disable all notifcations\n\nThis one is easy. Notifications where invented in an era where we only\nreceived texts or calls from people we loved. By having your phone vibrate or\nmake a noise when some event happens, you\u2019re delegating control of your\nattention to some random app developer. Guard your attention against external\ninteractions: disable all notifications.\n\nBut what about messages from loved ones? Those too: you\u2019ll develop a habit of\nchecking them from time to time, on your own terms. Almost no message requires\nyour attention in less than 6 hours. For urgent matters, ask your loved ones\nto call. Having all notifications disabled means you can now use your phone\nwith sound on! Oh, I can already hear the laughter of Gen Zs... But really, if\nyour phone can only make a noise when a loved one calls you, I think it\u2019s a\ndamn good use of a ringtone.\n\n### 2\\. Snooze emails aggressively\n\nI use Gmail as my email client, but most modern clients these days allow\nsnoozing too. Learn how to use it, as it\u2019s a major tool in regaining control\nover your own attention. Snoozing an email means making it dissappear from\nyour inbox until a later time, defined by you.\n\nMost of you reading this post are probably productivity obsessed. I am too.\nIt\u2019s common for knowledge workers. You\u2019ll need to tame your email if you want\nto control your attention. How?\n\nEvery time I open my email inbox, I quickly scan the new message senders and\nsubjects. I can instantly archive (or delete) about 50% without opening them.\nFor the rest, I take 5 seconds to decide if I should open it now or if I can\nsnooze it to a more appropriate time. For example, I often snooze personal\nemails to the weekend, when I like to take a couple of hours to read and reply\nthose while drinking coffee or mate.\n\nI refrain from opening emails right away. If I\u2019m unable to decide whether one\nis instantly snoozable to a better time, I read over it quickly. This is a\ndangerous moment: reading text from someone else has the potential to\ncompletely change your mood, mental context, etc. I try to only superficially\nengage with the content, only to decide when would be a good time to process\nit in depth. To me, that\u2019s usually next Monday for work stuff, where I like to\ntake 3 to 4 hours reading and responding to work email. Most other emails can\nbe snoozed to 2 or 3 days from now. Some emails require immediate attention,\nso I read and reply them then. But only about 5% of emails reach this stage.\n\nA nice side effect of doing this is that people get used to you taking a\ncouple of days to reply. It also allows your brain to background-process.\nYou\u2019ll find that when you do reply to your snoozed emails, you struggle much\nless to find what you want to say. Also, no need to apologize for responding\nlate. People understand you own your time and manage it as best as you can.\n\n### 3\\. Avoid news\n\nI started writing this blog post back in 2021. I don\u2019t think I need to explain\nthis one, being 2024. Everyone now knows that the news industry is corrupt,\nbiased, sensationalist, and maximizes drama in readers. Just quit. You can\nstay informed in other, healthier, ways. At least give it a try for 3 months\nand see.\n\n### 4\\. Avoid or tame social media\n\nI\u2019ve written about this before: social media is hurting your brain. Countless\nstudies show depression and reported anxiety increased since the invention of\nsocial apps. I\u2019m not even going to cite them: if you\u2019re curious you\u2019ll find\nthem in 2 seconds. Most people are already aware of the damage, but still\ncan\u2019t quit. This reminds me of smokers.\n\nThat\u2019s OK, it\u2019s hard. I even returned to Twitter myself after a 2-year hiatus.\nThe release of GPT-4 brought a kind of narrative void that I had to fill with\ncommunity-facing story-building. But I think I\u2019m ready to quit again. In fact,\npublishing this post is my excuse to announce I\u2019m quitting again, and\ncommiting publicly. Man, I really sound like smokers now.\n\nIn any case, if you too find it too hard to quit, consider at least taming it.\nTry leaving the most toxic ones: TikTok, Instagram, Facebook. Be very\nselective with who you follow. Every tweet you read is a microprogram that\nruns in your head.\n\nFor the social media apps you do keep, use them on desktop only. Remove the\napps from your phone, and even log them out from your phone\u2019s browser. Have\nTwitter on your phone and you may never be bored again. But you\u2019ll also\ncompletely concede your attention.\n\n### 5\\. Use uBlock to tailor the web\n\nThis is how my twitter home looks like:\n\nI use uBlock to customize how Twitter and other web apps look. For comparison,\nthis is how it looks with uBlock paused:\n\nYuck! I remove: ads, features I don\u2019t want to use, and even design elements I\ndon\u2019t like. It\u2019s a free internet, you should navigate it as you like!\n\nHow do you do this? Easy:\n\n  1. Go to your laptop browser.\n  2. Download ublock origin.\n  3. Go to the website you want to tame, eg: nytimes.com.\n  4. Right-click the element that you don\u2019t like, like the \u2018subscribe\u2019 button, and select \u201cblock element\u201d from the menu, which is a new function uBlock adds.\n  5. Use the two sliders provided to fine-tune the selection. I recommend moving the rightmost slider totally to the right, and gradually moving the leftmost as much as possible without selecting something you don\u2019t want. It takes a bit of practise but eventually you\u2019ll get it right in 1 second.\n  6. Click \u2018create\u2019, and you\u2019re done!\n\nPoof! The subscribe button has dissappeared. If you refresh the page, it\u2019s\nstill not there. If you ever want it back, you can go to the uBlock settings\nand edit your filters. If you happen to accidentally break a website doing\nthis, again, edit your filters.\n\nUse uBlock to tailor the web agressively!\n\nFrom time to time, the filter you\u2019ve configured will break, because websites\nchange their code. Don\u2019t fret, do it again. Every time a filter breaks, you\u2019ll\nbe shocked at how other people use the web in this filthy unedited mode.\n\n### 6\\. Archive conversations in messaging apps\n\nThis sounds like a cute trick but is surprisingly effective. Whatever\nmessaging app you use most (WhatsApp, in my case) has an Archive function. It\nwill also allow you to configure it so that archived conversations are\nautomatically unarchived when a new message arrives.\n\nEvery time you open your messaging app, instead of seeing a long list of\nconversations, you see this:\n\nWhich is to say: only the conversations that need your attention. This: (1)\nremoves the anxiety of losing track of messages that require some future\naction. (2) cleans up your messages visually.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how good this feels until you try it!\n\n### 7\\. Use browser tab groups\n\nMost of you probably have lots of open tabs in your browser. I propose three\nlevels of enlightenment/tidyness here:\n\n  1. Use vertical tabs (available in Brave or Arc browser as far as I know).\n  2. Group the tabs (google \u201chow to group tabs on Brave\u201d or whatever your browser is) so that at least you categorize or hide the mess.\n  3. Never leave open tabs \u201cfor later\u201d. Every night, decide if you want to (a) close the tab and forget about it or (b) send an email to yourself and snooze it to a future time when you\u2019ll be able to re-assess if you want to read it (eg: the weekend). Only leave \u201ccore\u201d tabs open every night: gmail, etc.\n  4. Bonus level: not only close all tabs but also turn off your computer and thus close all open apps too. Finish the day like a boss and start each day with a clean slate!\n\n### 8\\. Take your time to respond or react\n\nThis takes years of practice, but realize you don\u2019t need to reply to\neverything, much less immediately. Not only that, but you\u2019ll find that if you\ntake your time, you\u2019ll response will be better. Sometimes, you\u2019ll realize no\nresponse was needed.\n\nThis applies to emails, texts, messages, tweets, life events, everything! I\u2019m\njust restating an age-old teaching here, which is very difficult to follow,\nthough. Again, if you take your time to reply, no need to apologize about it.\n\n### 9\\. Schedule specific times to check email and social media\n\nNow that you\u2019ve tamed social media, your browser, messaging apps and email,\nyou\u2019ll need to schedule time to check them. They won\u2019t come barking at you, so\nyou should plan for when to engage them. Most of the anxiety of wanting to\ncheck these channels evaporates once your brain knows it will have time for\nthem later. Scheduling daily or weekly moments for \u2018external engagements\u2019 will\nfree the rest of your time to drown in the dread of boredom work deeply on\nstuff that matters to you, think, have good conversations, or read a lot.\n\n### 10\\. No-screen Fridays\n\nThis is my most precious discovery and advice. I\u2019m not sure where I got the\nidea from: jews, some writer I admire, or if I came up with it myself. I\ndearly ask you to consider to refrain from using screens on Fridays (or any\nother day you choose) Yes, everyone can do it. That\u2019s how we lived 30 years\nago, and nobody died.\n\nIf your job requires you to use a computer, try telling your coworkers that\nyou won\u2019t be available on those days. If you use the internet for reference,\ndownload and prepare in advance. If you need to be in touch with people for\nwork or personal matters, tell them that on Fridays they should call instead\nof message.\n\nThis is the most hardcore level of attention protection, but believe me: it\u2019s\nfantastic. No-screen Fridays are now my favorite days: no external input, no\ndistractions, no drama from the digital world. You\u2019ll find that these days\nyou\u2019ll be able to recover the lost power of focus you most probably lost. I\u2019d\nsay this technique on its own has had the most profound impact in my life\nsince I started this journey of attention control. To the daring reader: I\nurge you to try it!\n\nClose your laptop for the day, put your phone in \u201csound on\u201d mode in case\nsomeone needs to call you, and enjoy the analog world! You can still use your\nKindle and Google Maps (for navigation), but don\u2019t use screens for anything\nelse, at all! Enjoy your new life!\n\n## Summary and final words\n\n  1.
