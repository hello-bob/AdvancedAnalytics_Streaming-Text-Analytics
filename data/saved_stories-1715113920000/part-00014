Perhaps most impressively, batteries discharged over 5GW at peak times,\nmarking a 100% increase over the average in just one year.\n\nThis intensification of previous trends has had a series of knock-on effects\nin CAISO, most notably manifesting in the operations of natural gas.\n\n### Is California Finally Moving Away from Natural Gas?\n\nDespite a substantial increase in midday demand due to battery charging (more\non this later), there was no corresponding increase in natural gas generation.\nIn fact, the opposite occurred.\n\nFrom the mid-morning until the late evening, average hourly gas generation was\nat its lowest levels in the last 7 years, reversing a trend we wrote about\nlast year.\n\nIn mid-December of 2023, CAISO changed its methodology for reporting natural\ngas generation. To accommodate this change, Grid Status calculated an\n\u201cAdjusted Natural Gas\u201d generation data series based on our analysis of the\ndata reported by CAISO. See the footnote at the end of this post for\nunadjusted graph and more information on our adjustment methodology.\n\nIn the figure above, what was previously a defined peak in natural gas\ngeneration each evening has eroded into a plateau in 2024. That is because\nbatteries are assisting with the predictable, but large, swings in solar\noutput each day. These rapid ramps have been largely managed by natural gas\nunits to date, but now batteries are taking on much of that responsibility.\n\nThe data clearly shows that batteries are displacing natural gas when solar\ngeneration is ramping up and down each day in CAISO.\n\nData from April 30th when battery discharge hit an all-time record in CAISO\n\nInterestingly, it appears that batteries charged on that same cheap solar\nduring the day have been able to take control of the peak management from\nnatural gas generators. The shifting of this critical grid responsibility of\nhandling solar ramps to a more responsive asset like batteries has important\nconsequences. Because gas is no longer needed as much in the\nmornings/evenings, the amount held online during uneconomic midday conditions\nin preparation for evening solar down ramps can be reduced.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising aspect of this transformation in supply is that\nall this reduction occurred despite the average daily gas prices declined from\nnearly $9/MMBtu last April to just $4/MMBtu this year at SoCal Citygate (a\nrepresentative gas hub near the majority of gas plants in California).\n\nThe changes don\u2019t stop with batteries and gas. While solar was charging the\nsolution to its own grid issue it was also setting new records.\n\n### A Return to Increasing Solar in CAISO\n\n2024 has seen a shift from the stagnant solar generation of the past several\nyears. This step change is in some ways even more dramatic than the increase\nin batteries as solar was stuck in the same band from 2021-2023 while\nbatteries were still increasing year-over-year.\n\nEvery one of the top ten instantaneous solar generation records in CAISO\noccurred in the final 3 weeks of April (before we hit May, which has already\nnabbed three of the spots). Before this streak, the peak output was barely\nover 16 GW in September of 2023. Now the record stands at more than 18.5 GW\nand is poised to keep growing.\n\nSolar generation trends also bear a notable resemblance to the adjusted gas\ngeneration trends above. For both technologies, 2021-2023 and 2018-2020 were\nclustered together (particularly during the evening peak for gas) while 2024\nis a paradigm change.\n\nWhile new solar capacity additions certainly played a role in elevating\noutput, there are two other potential drivers at play.\n\n  1. With a reduction in the need for midday gas due to batteries, there is more room for solar generation to supply the wider grid.\n  2. The increased midday demand from batteries can consume solar output that might otherwise get curtailed.\n\nAs batteries work synergistically with solar in multiple ways, CAISO (and\nreally California\u2019s) grid of the future seems to be taking a much clearer\nshape than in previous years.\n\n## What about Hydropower?\n\nWe don\u2019t want to forget about hydropower \u2014 a sizable and dispatchable resource\non the western grid that could explain any of the changes we\u2019ve discussed so\nfar.\n\nIn this case, the decrease in gas doesn\u2019t correspond with a banner year in\nhydropower production either. Despite relatively high shoulder hour output,\nthe midday generating level is in the lower tranche of the last 7 years.\n\nLower midday usage of hydropower is highly desirable for the CAISO system as\nit allows for greater dispatch of hydropower resources during the hours\nwithout solar generation - a textbook complementary system. Snowpack-fed\nhydropower systems in the western United States display substantial\nvariability across a year as water levels are managed on a longer timeframe\nthan their eastern cousins, which are typically not reliant on a single\nseason\u2019s precipitation to remain operational. By reducing the need for midday\nhydropower, a significant portion of a given year\u2019s available MWhs can be\nshifted towards more critical periods.\n\nThe evening peak erosion pattern for gas generation is also present for\nhydropower, although this weathering is not dissimilar to 2023 and has not yet\nreached the level setting of gas\u2019 featureless plain.\n\n## Collaborating with Neighbors\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at the last major variable piece of CAISO\u2019s operations,\ninterchange.\n\nAlongside the uptick in battery operations and solar generation and the\ndowntick in gas, CAISO has, on average, reduced their midday exports. 2023 had\nseen a dramatic expansion of exports during daytime hours which correlated\nwith the substantial uptick in gas generation. In 2024, despite the increase\nin solar generation, midday exports have actually declined somewhat while the\novernight imports have returned to pre-2023 levels. This suggests that the\noverall shift down in natural gas generators held online in CAISO to deal with\nramping issues may have contributed to an increase in off-peak imports.\n\nWith the changes in CAISO\u2019s generation mix detailed above, these exports to\nthe rest of the west are substantially cleaner than they were in 2023. By\ndriving down the commitment of uneconomic gas for operational reasons,\nbatteries within CAISO also ensure that the wider system balance in the west\nhas had to absorb fewer MWhs of inflexibly committed generation in CAISO.\n\n## The Big Load Shift\n\nCAISO\u2019s load has been low this April, with a relatively mild spring, the\ncontinued march of BTM solar installations, and energy efficiency upgrades.\nHowever, with changes to the state\u2019s net-metering program, BTM solar growth\nhas started to slow.\n\nAll of the different generation sources we discussed so far are running with\nthe goal of serving load. And, through the lens of load, 2023 and 2024 finally\nlook more similar, but there is one major factor missing, the key driver we\u2019ve\nbeen focusing on, batteries. One quirk of CAISO\u2019s load reporting is that they\ndo not include battery charging, which distorts the picture of total demand on\nthe grid. To ameliorate this, we have added it back in the figure below, which\ndramatically alters the shape of the load curve for 2024.\n\nBatteries elongate the downward ramp in load and shift the daytime minimum\nload to later in the day. As a result, batteries seem to be having a clear\npositive impact on the exact operational issues around ramping that have been\nthe topic of so much discussion in recent years.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe key question going forward is whether this is indicative of a new reality\nin CAISO, or simply an outlier spring. While many elements point to this being\na structural change largely driven by the increased presence of batteries, the\ngrid is changing quickly and sometimes in unpredictable ways. Those changes\naren\u2019t limited to physical assets either, as market consolidation in the West\nis poised to substantially alter management of the western interconnection by\nthe end of the 2020s, a topic we wrote about last year. Whether or not this\nprogress is continued in the years to come, this spring will still stand as a\nshift, the first time California\u2019s ugly duckling demand curve began to\nresemble the intended swan.\n\n### Adjusted Natural Gas Methodology\n\nIn mid-December of 2023, CAISO changed its methodology for reporting natural\ngas generation. While initial inquiries implied a limited impact, certain\nareas of CAISO\u2019s website indicate that comparing data before and after the\nchange cannot be done.\n\nUpon review of CAISO\u2019s natural gas generation reporting change, we determined\nthat this change may have been related to a growing discrepancy between public\nsupply and demand numbers in CAISO. The table below shows an increasing gap\nbetween the sum of supply and demand over the previous Aprils. This\ndiscrepancy has been reported to CAISO and we will update this post if we\nlearn more.\n\nBecause this discrepancy affects a key piece of this analysis, we have\ngenerated a \"adjusted natural gas\" generation value under a new methodology\nfor years prior to 2024 that we believe is more suited for comparison.\n\nSimply put, we match supply and demand by adjusting natural gas. The ratio\nbetween the two is determined based on each 5-minute interval during April\n2024, with a floor of 1 i.e supply can never be below demand. For each\nmatching interval in previous years, gas generation is capped at that value\ntimes demand minus all other sources of supply. The ratio is meant to\nrepresent some normal amount of losses. The formula for this Adjusted Gas\nGeneration value is as follows:\n\nAdj. Gas_interval = (Demand MWh_interval * ratio_interval) - (Non-Gas\nMWh_interval)\n\nThis adjustment can be visualized in terms of the MW gap between supply and\ndemand per 5 minutes interval.\n\nDespite this dramatic adjustments made to 2023 and 2022, the figure published\nin the post above still shows record-low midday gas generation as well as\nflattening of evening demand. The original natural gas chart without any\nadjustments is shown below.\n\n## Sign up for more like this.\n\nEnter your email\n\nSubscribe\n\n## What to Expect on the Grid During the Total Solar Eclipse\n\nThe eclipse is a rare event that has real implications for electric grid\noperations.
