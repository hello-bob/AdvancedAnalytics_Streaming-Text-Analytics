Page\n1 of 5. 1 Comment.\n\nAs part of my Linux 6.9 benchmarking I've been trying out many hardware\ncombinations and overall seeing nice performance out of this kernel that will\ndebut as stable in the next 2~3 weeks. AMD EPYC 4th Gen performance is\nboosted, Intel Xeon Max sees some AI improvements, and as shown in some prior\nIntel Core Ultra performance benchmarks is enhanced as well. Here are some\nmore benchmarks looking at the Intel Core Ultra 7 \"Meteor Lake\" performance on\nLinux 6.9 compared to the current Linux 6.8 stable kernel.\n\nLast month I ran some initial Meteor Lake benchmarks on Linux 6.9 back during\nthe -rc1 stage while more recently I ran a larger set of benchmarks on the\ncurrent Linux 6.9 Git state as of this past week. For lack of other platforms,\nall of my Intel Meteor Lake Linux benchmarking continues to be done using an\nAcer Swift Go 14 with Core Ultra 7 155H\n(https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-core-ultra-7-155h-linux).\n\nThere are many new Linux 6.9 features but helping Meteor Lake in particular is\nthe Meteor Lake tuning within the Intel P-State driver to refine its\nperformance and power efficiency.\n\nContinue on for a look at this Linux 6.8 vs. 6.9 performance for Intel Core\nUltra (Meteor Lake) on this Ubuntu laptop setup. The CPU power consumption,\nCPU temperature, and CPU peak frequency were also monitored across all of\nthese benchmarks.\n\n1 Comment - Next Page\n\nPage: 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIntel Xeon Max Sees Some Performance Gains For OpenVINO & ONNX With Linux 6.9\n\nLinux 6.9 Drives AMD 4th Gen EPYC Performance Even Higher For Some Workloads\n\nIntel Core Ultra \"Meteor Lake\" Yields Faster Performance With Linux 6.9\n\nGoogle Cloud's C3D Instances Provide Strong Performance Value For PingCAP's\nTiDB\n\nLinux 6.9 Features: DM VDO, AMD Preferred Core, Intel FRED & Larger Console\nFonts\n\nLLVM Clang Shows Off Great Performance Advantage On NVIDIA GH200's Neoverse-V2\nCores\n\nLatest Linux News\n\nRadeon OpenGL Linux Driver Massively Improves 3D Texturing Performance For\nOlder GPUs\n\nUbuntu Support Ongoing For The Arm-Based Lenovo ThinkPad X13s Laptop\n\nFedora Evaluates Replacing Redis With Valkey\n\nsystemd Rolling Out \"run0\" As sudo Alternative\n\nKDE's Amarok 3.0 Music Player Released After Six Year Hiatus - Now Ported To\nQt5\n\nGit 2.45 Released With Initial SHA1/SHA256 Interoperability & Reftable Support\n\nRaspberry Pi V3DV Vulkan Driver Implements Extended Dynamic State - Important\nFor DXVK\n\nUbuntu Isn't Yet Recommending GNOME's VRR Option\n\nAMD Prepares Linux For \"Bus Lock Trap\" Feature On Upcoming CPUs\n\nUbuntu 24.10 Is The \"Oracular Oriole\"\n\nShow Your Support, Go Premium\n\nPhoronix Premium allows ad-free access to the site, multi-page articles on a\nsingle page, and other features while supporting this site's continued\noperations.\n\nLatest Featured Articles\n\nIntel Core Ultra \"Meteor Lake\" Performance Improves With Linux 6.9\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7950X & Intel Core i9 14900K: Ubuntu 22.04 vs. 23.10 vs. 24.04\nLinux Performance\n\nGCC 14 vs. LLVM Clang 18 Compiler Performance On Fedora 40\n\nKioxia KCD8XPUG1T92 CD8P-R & KCMYXVUG3T20 CM7-V PCIe 5.0 SSDs\n\nUbuntu 24.04 Boosts Performance, Outperforming Windows 11 On The AMD Ryzen\nFramework 16 Laptop\n\nSupport Phoronix\n\nThe mission at Phoronix since 2004 has centered around enriching the Linux\nhardware experience.
