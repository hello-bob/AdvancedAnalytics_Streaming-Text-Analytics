Goff\n\nDina Temple-Raston Sean Powers April 23rd, 2024\n\n# The company man: US glacial response to Nigeria\u2019s detention of former IRS\ncrypto investigator rankles federal agents\n\nThis week Tigran Gambaryan \u2014 the head of financial crime compliance for\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange \u2014 found himself in the\nlast place he\u2019d ever expected to be: in a Nigerian courtroom pleading for\nbail.\n\nA former investigator with the IRS, he\u2019d spent more than a decade following\nillicit cryptocurrency transactions back to the people who made them. Rolling\nup, among others, the alleged founder of AlphaBay, Alexandre Cazes, and Silk\nRoad\u2019s \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d Ross Ulbricht.\n\nBut now, after a spectacularly bad turn of events, Gambaryan has found himself\nat the center of a battle between his company and regulators of the Nigerian\ngovernment. A Nigerian court has charged him personally for a roster of\nalleged crimes that Binance is accused of committing, and it is unclear how a\nmiddle manager, a former cop, has ended up shouldering the blame. Gambaryan\nhas pleaded not guilty. He says he\u2019s done nothing wrong.\n\nEven so, Nigerian authorities have held Gambaryan under guard since late\nFebruary. Click Here spoke to more than a dozen current and former IRS and FBI\nagents who either knew Gambaryan well or had worked with him, and they all\nvoiced the same concern: Why isn\u2019t the government doing more for one of its\nown?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving a fellow law enforcement officer, even though he\u2019s out of the\ngame, kind of hanging,\u201d said Matt Price, a former IRS agent who worked with\nTigran on cases and at Binance. \u201cWe can\u2019t believe they\u2019re not doing anything.\u201d\nAnd while his plight appears to have been elevated inside the Biden\nadministration in recent days, agents are asking \u201cwhat took them so long?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done nothing wrong,\u201d Gambaryan said in a cell phone video he filmed\nback in March. \u201cI\u2019ve been a cop my whole life. I\u2019m asking the United States\ngovernment to assist me ... I need your help guys. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get\nout of this without your help. Please help.\u201d\n\n## Charges after an escape\n\nGambaryan\u2019s cell phone video summed in 40 seconds what is otherwise a very\ncomplicated series of events. \u201cHello my name is Tigran Gambaryan and I\u2019m the\nhead of financial crime compliance at Binance,\u201d it began. \u201cI have been\ndetained by the Nigerian government for a month and I don\u2019t know what is going\nto happen to me after today.\u201d\n\nWhile Gambaryan recorded the message, it was clear he was worried guards would\nstop him or grab his phone because just a few hours earlier he had awoken from\na nap to learn that the Binance colleague who had been detained with him had\nsomehow escaped. \u201cI had nothing to do with it, I was not involved in any of\nit,\u201d he said in the video.\n\nNadeem Anjarwalla was Binance\u2019s regional manager in charge of Africa. He and\nGambaryan were detained by the authorities at the same time. But the afternoon\nof that video, according to three people familiar with what happened,\nGambaryan found a Post-it note from Anjarwalla that essentially said he was\nsorry, but he was making a break for it. Anjarwalla had put pillows under the\ncovers of his bed so guards would think he was still there.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how he got out of the government compound, it\nappears he asked guards if he could go to a nearby mosque to say prayers for\nRamadan, and while he was in the mosque, he gave them the slip. It was left to\nGamabaryan to break it to his captors that Anjarwalla was gone. The Nigerian\ngovernment now claims that it is in negotiations with Kenya to have Anjarwalla\nextradited.\n\nTheir anger and embarrassment at having lost Binance\u2019s country manager seems\nto have fallen mostly on Gambaryan. Within days of the escape, the Nigerian\nauthorities charged him, Anjarwalla and Binance itself with tax evasion and\nmoney laundering.\n\nThe fact that Gambaryan found himself on the receiving end of all of this is\nparticularly ironic because his job at Binance was to act as a liaison between\nlaw enforcement and the company and he came to Nigeria in the first place to\nteach local investigators how to track shady transactions back to the\ncriminals behind them.\n\n## An unexpected announcement\n\nThe timing of the Nigerian government\u2019s decision to detain Gambaryan and\nAnjarwalla in February came just months after the Justice Department reached a\nplea agreement with Binance\u2019s founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Zhao had\nagreed to plead guilty to a roster of charges including tax evasion and money\nlaundering related to lax oversight at the exchange.\n\nZhao, known as CZ, agreed to step down as CEO, surrender his passport and pay\na multibillion-dollar fine. The announcement, rumored for months, rocked the\ncrypto world and, some observers say, may have planted an idea into the minds\nof some Nigerian officials.\n\n\u201cCZ was sort of a cult figure within the industry,\u201d said Jacob Silverman, who\nwrote a book with Ben McKenzie on the crypto industry entitled \u201cEasy Money:\nCryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud.\u201d\n\nHe said that people had looked up to CZ because he had managed to build the\nbiggest crypto exchange in the world at breakneck speed, though \u201che had had a\nreputation for, you know, to use the old [Mark] Zuckerberg phase, \u2018move fast\nand break things.\u2019\u201d\n\nSilverman said there was always a whiff of something being not-quite-on-the-\nup-and-up about Zhao. Among other things, he would never travel to the U.S. He\nlived in the United Arab Emirates, but he was from Canada.\n\n\u201cPeople kept wondering, what\u2019s this guy up to in Dubai?\u201d Silverman said,\nadding that kind of mystery was rife in the early days of the industry. \u201cThere\nwas a sense that the existing rules, especially the existing rules around\nbanking and how money moves shouldn\u2019t really apply. And that\u2019s certainly what\nanimated a lot of the overseas growth of crypto, especially in East Asia and\nin Africa. There was this notion that \u2018we should be able to move money\nwherever we want to without really much heed for how we\u2019re doing it or how\nmuch we\u2019re sending or to whom.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn its case against Zhao, the Justice Department said the former CEO\nprioritized Binance\u2019s growth, market share and profits over U.S. law. He\nadmitted to facilitating billions of dollars in cryptocurrency transactions\nwithout adhering to some of the most fundamental rules of banking. Binance\ndidn\u2019t implement anti-money laundering protocols or adhere to \u201cknow your\ncustomer\u201d procedures, which require that a bank or financial institution\nshould know basic information about their customers.\n\n\u201cFor several years after Binance first opened in 2017, you could register a\nBinance account with just an email address and a password,\u201d said Silverman.\n\u201cAnd CZ knew that they were flagrantly in violation of Know Your Customer and\nanti-money laundering laws and regulations.\u201d The Justice Department said as\nmuch when it charged Zhao, using internal texts and emails as proof that the\nattitude was \u201cdo it now, and ask for forgiveness later.\u201d\n\n## A very familiar looking set of charges\n\nIn early January, just weeks after the Zhao plea agreement was made public,\nGambaryan was part of a group of Binance employees who traveled to Abuja, the\nNigerian capital, to meet with regulators from the Economic and Financial\nCrimes Commission.\n\n\u201cIt was more of a training event with the EFCC, this is something that Tigran\ndid quite a bit,\u201d said Price. \u201cHe did these trips a lot and I had done it\nquite a bit. You come in and talk to law enforcement people, it's usually a\nsoft approach and you're trying to build relationships and trying to train\nthem how to do crypto investigations.\u201d\n\nSo in other words, Gambaryan was there to teach the Nigerian regulators how to\ntrack cryptocurrency transactions back to the bad guys. But the January trip,\nthe first of two Gambaryan would make in the first part of 2024, took a bad\nturn. Nigerian officials said they were concerned that Binance was evading\ntaxes and violating anti-money laundering rules.\n\nA Nigerian official allegedly took someone from the Binance team aside during\nthe early January trip. The official said that regulatory authorities were\nplanning an investigation of the company and that the cost of settling the\ncompany\u2019s legal problems would come to some $150 million. The authorities\nfloated the idea of detaining some of the people in the delegation.\n\n\u201cObviously Tigran said, \u2018shit, I got to get out of here,\u2019\u201d said Price, adding\nthat Gambaryan canceled his remaining appointments and hopped a plane back to\nthe States.\n\nYuki Gambaryan, Tigran\u2019s wife, said she heard about it all in almost real\ntime. \u201cHe texted me, saying that, \u2018Hey, this is just a heads up, but things\nare not going well right now and we might get detained.\u2019 So I was aware of\nit.\u201d\n\nThen, just weeks later, Gambaryan got an invitation from the Nigerian\ngovernment to meet with regulators again. Gambaryan told his friends that he\nfelt he had an obligation to go. I asked his wife whether she was worried when\nhe left for that second trip at the end of February.\n\n\u201cI was. One hundred percent. Everybody was,\u201d she said.\n\nSoon after officials detained Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, they asked Binance to\nturn over all the Nigerian transaction data they had. Local newspaper reports\nthen said the government had limited the request to the top 100 users. Central\nbank officials then began accusing Binance of manipulating the exchange rate\nof the local currency, the naira, and said the company couldn\u2019t account for\ntens of billions of dollars in transactions.\n\nAll of which Binance has disputed.\n\n## \u2018Some pretty bad people were using the platform\u2019\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s indictment against the former CEO of Binance showed\nZhao and his lieutenants had a penchant for rule-breaking. \u201cYou had, for\nexample, employees of Binance joking about the price of an AK-47 and as if\nthey knew about it in the context of a conversation of terrorist groups using\nBinance,\u201d said Silverman, the author of that book on cryptocurrencies. \u201cI\nthink the company, at least at the top levels, definitely had a sense that\nsome pretty bad people were using the platform.\u201d\n\nBinance has been left to convince skeptics that they have changed. Richard\nTeng, the company\u2019s new CEO, is a former Singaporean regulator. He hired\npeople like Gambaryan to help redeem the brand. Nigerian regulators are either\nunconvinced, or opportunistic. It is hard not to see echoes of the charges the\nJustice Department brought against Zhao in what Gambaryan is battling in\nNigerian courts now.\n\nNigeria has the second largest cryptocurrency adoption rate in the world,\nafter India. Its crypto transactions topped $56.7 billion last year, according\nto Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform.\n\nWe spoke to half a dozen people close to Tigran\u2019s case in both the U.S. and\nNigeria and they say there may have been something else about the Zhao plea\nagreement that caught the eye of Nigerian officials. CZ agreed to pay a record\n$4.3 billion in fines and restitution to the U.S. government \u2014 one of the\nbiggest fines in corporate history.\n\nSilverman said it sends another message. \u201cI think that indicates the gravity\nof the situation and maybe the amount of money sloshing around,\u201d he said.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like a coincidence that days after Nigerian officials detained\nthe two Binance executives in a government compound, they mused in the local\npress about potential billion-dollar fines.\n\n## Economic woes\n\nNigeria\u2019s case against Gambaryan is about more than just trying to hold\nBinance and the cryptocurrency industry to account. There is a larger context:\nNigeria is in the midst of a full-blown economic crisis.\n\nThe numbers tell the story. Inflation in Nigeria is now well over 30 percent.\nFood prices are up even more than that and the local currency, the naira, has\ndeclined in value against the U.S. dollar by some 40 percent since the\nbeginning of the year. Just to keep up with inflation, Nigerians have started\nflocking to cryptocurrencies \u2014 and trading stablecoins, which are pegged to\nthe U.S. dollar \u2014 amongst themselves, peer-to-peer.\n\nBinance just facilitates those trades, it doesn\u2019t control them. But it has\nangered Nigeria\u2019s central bank nevertheless. According to Feyi Fawehimni, a\nNigerian scholar who has been writing about the nation\u2019s economic and\npolitical affairs for more than a decade, it was easy to blame Binance for\neconomic problems.\n\n\u201cPeople who wanted simple answers simply turned on them and said, Oh, OK, this\neconomy is struggling. Nobody has dollars, who\u2019s fault is this?\u201d he said. \u201cThe\ndollar rate has jumped so significantly and the central bank had no control,\nso Binance became a kind of scapegoat.\u201d\n\nCentral bankers didn\u2019t want to blame the people trading naira, so they blamed\nthe Binance platform instead. \u201cThese are unpopular people, right?\u201d he said.\n\u201cNobody likes Binance. The US government doesn't like them. The U.K.\ngovernment doesn't like them. Everyone is suspicious of them as a crypto\nplatform across the world so someone in the government made the calculation\nthat if we go after these people, nobody's going to really fight for them.\u201d\n\nAnd the calculation was right. Gambaryan has given critics of Binance a human\nshape, a shorthand not just for crypto and all the problems it has caused in\nNigeria. They didn\u2019t have a former CEO to blame so they settled for a\ncompliance officer.\n\nNearly all the current and former IRS agents we spoke to for this story said\nNigeria wasn\u2019t alone in being unable to see the difference between Gambaryan\nand the company he worked for: the U.S. government seemed to be doing that\ntoo.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until mid-March that the U.S. State Department seemed to focus on\nthe case. Tigran's wife said he had six visits from embassy personnel in Abuja\nwhile he was being held in the government compound. And they\u2019ve visited him\nonce since he\u2019d been moved to Kuje prison. \u201cThey seem kind of out of touch to\nme,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don't seem to understand our sense of urgency.\u201c\n\nWe spoke to four people at the State Department familiar with the case. They\ndeclined to be identified by name because they are not authorized to speak.\nBut they claimed that the State Department didn\u2019t like to interfere with legal\nproceedings in other countries and quickly added that Binance wasn\u2019t just any\ncompany, before mentioning the Zhao plea agreement and the parade of cases\nagainst the industry more generally.\n\nAt the end of March, after Gambaryan had been in Nigerian detention for over a\nmonth, his case was flagged at the Justice Department\u2019s Office of\nInternational Affairs. It\u2019s part of the Criminal Division and is supposed to\nhelp the department sort through international criminal matters. It is unclear\nwhat the response to that query was.\n\nBut the rank-and-file agents we spoke to all agreed that the Gambaryan case\nwas moving slowly. The thought is that if he was an ExxonMobil or Apple\nexecutive detained overseas, would the response have been quicker?\n\nThe only official email that we discovered that went out about Gambaryan among\nthe rank and file came from a special agent in the Cyber Crimes Unit in D.C.\nIt was sent to a small group of agents, nearly all of whom either knew Tigran\nwell or had worked with him. Two people who had seen the email described its\ncontents as mentioning that Tigran had been detained and that he would always\nbe part of the law enforcement family. There was no mention of elevating this\nup the chain of command, but the email did suggest that everyone keep Yuki and\nTigran in their thoughts and prayers.\n\n\u201cI guess the best word for me would be, I think, it is sad,\u201d said John Baker,\nwho was at the IRS with Tigran and retired from the government a couple of\nyears ago, so was at liberty to say on the record what other agents told us\nprivately. \u201cOriginally I was thinking he's well known, so well regarded that\nsomehow the United States would get involved to kind of figure out what's\ngoing on. He has friends in various agencies, including the FBI or the U.S.\nAttorney's Office. But it sounds like most people don't even know what\u2019s\nhappened to him or haven't heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo after the companies and the people making the decisions,\u201d he said. \u201dBut\nwhen we're dealing with people who are, you know, middle management,\nemployees, people who have no way to make a decision other than to receive a\npaycheck, that's crazy to me.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of Binance, Richard Teng, said on Bloomberg television last week that\nthe company is talking to the Nigerian government to get Gambaryan back. \u201cOur\nkey priority is to get Tigran home safely, right?\u201d he said on the sidelines of\na cryptocurrency conference in Dubai. \u201cTigran is a person of the highest\nintegrity, people that know him know that he has devoted his entire lifetime\npreviously with U.S. agencies. We are giving him and his family all the\nsupport needed and our key priority, our prayers, is to bring Tigran home\nsafely as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nSo given all of this one could be forgiven for wondering why Gambaryan\nreturned to Nigeria at the end of February after that earlier close call.\nHindsight is always 20-20. But his friends say that when the Nigerian\ngovernment invited him back for that fateful February meeting, Gambaryan\nthought he saw an opening to make things right.\n\nFormer IRS agent Price said that was just the way Gambaryan was. \u201cHe believed\nhe could solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cKnowing Tigran\u2019s personality, I certainly could\nsee him believing he would be the only one that could fix it.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Gambaryan\u2019s tax trial was postponed until May 17. A bail hearing is\nsupposed to resume April 23. Chengpeng Zhao, the former Binance CEO, is\nsupposed to be sentenced on April 30th. He is facing up to 18 months in prison\nunder federal sentencing guidelines, but prosecutors have said they may be\nasking for a stiffer sentence.\n\n  * News\n  * People\n  * Government\n  * Industry\n  * Podcast\n\nGet more insights with the\n\nRecorded Future\n\nIntelligence Cloud.\n\nLearn more.\n\nTags\n\n  * Nigeria\n  * Binance\n  * cryptocurrency\n\nNo previous article\n\nNo new articles\n\nDina Temple-Raston\n\nis the Host and Managing Editor of the Click Here podcast as well as a senior\ncorrespondent at Recorded Future News.
