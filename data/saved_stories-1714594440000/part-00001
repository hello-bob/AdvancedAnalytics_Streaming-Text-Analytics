Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass.,\nrequested the Federal Trade Commission investigate major automakers for\nbreaking a pledge to protect their customers\u2019 location data, in a letter to\nChair Lina Khan sent today. The automakers had deceptively pledged that they\nwould insist on warrants or other court orders before turning over location\ndata from their customers\u2019 connected automobiles to law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe letter comes in response to an inquiry by Sen. Wyden\u2019s office, which asked\nthe association representing automakers how their members respond to law\nenforcement requests for location information collected from internet-\nconnected cars and trucks. He found that only five \u2014 GM, Ford, Honda,\nStellantis and Tesla \u2014 require a warrant to provide location data to law-\nenforcement. And only Tesla notifies auto owners about government demands.\n\n\u201cAutomakers have not only kept consumers in the dark regarding their actual\npractices, but multiple companies misled consumers for over a decade by\nfailing to honor the industry\u2019s own voluntary privacy principles. To that end,\nwe urge the FTC to investigate these auto manufacturers\u2019 deceptive claims as\nwell as their harmful data retention practices,\u201d Wyden and Markey wrote.\n\nToyota, Nissan, Subaru, Volkswagen, BMW, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Kia all\nconfirmed that they will disclose location data to U.S. government agencies in\nresponse to subpoenas, which do not require a judge\u2019s approval. Volkswagen\nindicated that it will require a warrant for more than seven days of location\ndata, but will disclose six days or less in response to a subpoena. Volvo,\nwhich is owned by Geely, a Chinese company, did not respond to the request.\nThese responses directly contradict a public pledge by the auto industry, that\nthe companies signed onto, committing to require that \u201crequests or demand from\ngovernmental entities for geolocation information, must be in the form of a\nwarrant or court order,\u201d except in emergency situations or with the owner\u2019s\nconsent.\n\nWyden and Markey warned that failing to protect Americans\u2019 privacy could have\ndangerous consequences, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs\ndecision, which allows states to criminalize abortion and places other\nreproductive health choices at risk of criminalization. Vehicle location data\ncan reveal intimate details of a person\u2019s life, including for those who seek\ncare across state lines, attend protests, visit mental or behavioral health\nprofessionals or seek treatment for substance use disorder.\n\nThe full letter to the FTC is here.\n\n###\n\n  * Print\n  * Email\n  * Tweet\n\nPrevious Article\n\n  * Meet Ron\n  * News\n  * Issues\n  * Services\n  * Contact\n  * Office Locations\n\n  * Social Icon\n  * Social Icon\n  * Social Icon\n  * Icon\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": true}
