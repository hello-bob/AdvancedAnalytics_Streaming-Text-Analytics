The top five\ncountries hit were the US, UK, France, Germany and China.\n\nPictured: the NCA took control of the group's services including its leak site\non the dark web\n\nAttacks targeted over 100 hospitals and healthcare companies and at least\n2,110 victims were forced into in some degree of negotiation by cyber\ncriminals.\n\nThe group has attempted to rebuild over the last two months, however the NCA\nassesses that as a result of this investigation, they are currently running at\nlimited capacity and the global threat from LockBit has significantly reduced.\n\nLockBit have created a new leak site on which they have inflated apparent\nactivity by publishing victims targeted prior to the NCA taking control of its\nservices in February, as well as taking credit for attacks perpetrated using\nother ransomware strains.\n\nData shows that the average number of monthly LockBit attacks has reduced by\n73% in the UK since February\u2019s action, with other countries also reporting\nreductions. Attacks appear to have been carried out by less sophisticated\naffiliates with lower levels of impact.\n\nAs well as uncovering the real-world identity of LockBitSupp, the Operation\nCronos investigation has given the NCA and partners a deep insight into\nLockBit\u2019s operations and network.\n\nOf the 194 affiliates identified as using LockBit\u2019s services up until February\n2024:\n\n  * 148 built attacks.\n  * 119 engaged in negotiations with victims, meaning they definitely deployed attacks.\n  * Of the 119 who began negotiations, there are 39 who appear not to have ever received a ransom payment.\n  * 75 did not engage in any negotiation, so also appear not to have received any ransom payments.\n\nThis means up to 114 affiliates paid thousands to join the LockBit programme\nand caused unknown levels of damage, meaning they will targeted by law\nenforcement, but never made any money from their criminality.\n\nActive affiliate numbers have also significantly reduced, to 69, since\nFebruary.\n\nThe NCA uncovered numerous examples of attacks where the decryptor provided by\nLockBit to victims who had paid ransoms failed to work, and where they\nreceived no support from affiliates or LockBit, further highlighting their\nuntrustworthiness.\n\nIn one affiliate attack against a children\u2019s hospital in December 2022,\nLockBitSupp issued an apologetic statement on their leak site and confirmed it\nhad provided the decryptor to the victim for free.\n\nIt said the attacker had \u201cviolated our rules\u201d, had been blocked and was no\nlonger in their affiliate programme. In fact, they remained an active LockBit\naffiliate up until the February 2024 disruption, with NCA analysis showing\nthey went on to build 127 unique attacks, engage in 50 negotiations with\nvictims and received multiple ransom payments.\n\nFinally, as was established by investigators, LockBit did not routinely delete\nstolen data once a ransom was paid.\n\nNCA Director General Graeme Biggar said: \u201cThese sanctions are hugely\nsignificant and show that there is no hiding place for cyber criminals like\nDmitry Khoroshev, who wreak havoc across the globe. He was certain he could\nremain anonymous, but he was wrong.\n\n\u201cWe know our work to disrupt LockBit thus far has been extremely successful in\ndegrading their capability and credibility among the criminal community. The\ngroup\u2019s attempt at rebuilding has resulted in a much less sophisticated\nenterprise with significantly reduced impact.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement puts another huge nail in the LockBit coffin and our\ninvestigation into them continues. We are also now targeting affiliates who\nhave used LockBit services to inflict devastating ransomware attacks on\nschools, hospitals and major companies around the world.\n\n\u201cWorking with our international partners, we will use all the tools at our\ndisposal to target other groups like LockBit, expose their leadership and\nundermine their operations to protect the public.\u201d\n\nSanctions Minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: \u201cTogether with our allies we\nwill continue to crack down on hostile cyber activity which is destroying\nlivelihoods and businesses across the world.\n\n\u201cIn sanctioning one of the leaders of LockBit we are taking direct action\nagainst those who continue to threaten global security, while simultaneously\nexposing the malicious cyber-criminal activity emanating from Russia.\u201d\n\nSecurity Minister Tom Tugendhat said: \u201cCyber criminals think they are\nuntouchable, hiding behind anonymous accounts as they try to extort money from\ntheir victims.\n\n\u201cBy exposing one of the leaders of LockBit, we are sending a clear message to\nthese callous criminals. You cannot hide. You will face justice.\u201d\n\nThe NCA and international partners are now in possession of over 2,500\ndecryption keys and are continuing to contact LockBit victims to offer\nsupport. The Agency has so far proactively reached out to nearly 240 LockBit\nvictims in the UK.\n\nPublic reporting is absolutely vital in supporting global law enforcement to\ntackle ransomware effectively. If you are in the UK, you should use the\nGovernment\u2019s Cyber Incident Signposting Site as soon as possible, for\ndirection on which agencies to report your incident to.\n\nThe Operation Cronos taskforce includes the NCA, the South West Regional\nOrganised Crime Unit (SWROCU), and Metropolitan Police Service in the UK; FBI\nand the Department of Justice in the US; Europol, Eurojust, and law\nenforcement partners in France (Gendarmerie), Germany (LKA and BKA),\nSwitzerland (Fedpol and Zurich Cantonal Police), Japan (National Police\nAgency), Australia (Australian Federal Police), Sweden (Swedish Police\nAuthority), Canada (RCMP), and the Netherlands (National Police - Politie).\n\nThis operation was also supported by the National Bureau of Investigation in\nFinland.\n\n07 May 2024\n\n## Latest from twitter\n\nVisit the NCA timeline on Twitter\n\n## Share this page:\n\nTOP \u02c4\n\n0370 496 7622\n\nNCA general enquiries or to verify an NCA officer, available 24/7\n\n  * Sitemap\n  * Privacy and Cookie Policy\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Publications\n  * Accessibility statement\n\n\u00a9 Crown Copyright\n\n\u00a9 Crown Copyright\n\n", "frontpage": false}
