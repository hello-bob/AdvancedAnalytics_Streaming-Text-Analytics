A ban could devastate their communities.\n\nBy Kelsey Ables\n\nand\n\nJennifer Hassan\n\nApril 25, 2024 at 11:53 p.m. EDT\n\nSome TikTok community members expressed deeper anxiety over the potential loss\nof their close-knit circles on the app. (Video: The Washington Post/Courtesy\nof Sam Reall; Gabrielle Valdez; Jackie Gonzalez; Alexis McKnight)\n\nListen\n\n8 min\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nPresident Biden signed legislation Wednesday that could ban TikTok, leaving\nusers in the United States who have spent years building a home on the\nplatform worried about losing the communities they have come to cherish.\n\nAs talk of a potential ban escalated, creators encouraged fellow users to\ncontact lawmakers and voice their discontent about the measure, which is\nrooted in security concerns over the app\u2019s Chinese ownership. TikTok\u2019s parent\ncompany, ByteDance, has roughly nine months to sell the app to a U.S. company\n\u2014 or TikTok could be banned nationally.\n\nTikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew said a ban would take the platform away\nfrom the 170 million Americans who use it. \u201cMake no mistake, this is a ban \u2014 a\nban on TikTok and a ban on you and your voice,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are not\ngoing anywhere.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAfter the Senate vote, some users scrambled to ask their communities, \u201cWhat\nplatform are we going to now?\u201d\n\nOthers, particularly some with stigmatized interests or marginalized\nidentities, expressed deeper anxiety over the potential loss of close-knit\ncircles built through TikTok that could prove difficult to rebuild elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already built such a strong ecosystem on TikTok,\u201d said Jackie Gonzalez,\nwho has found comfort and community on #DeafTok. \u201cTo tear that down and force\nus to rebuild somewhere else would be a setback for sure.\u201d\n\n###\n\nTourettesTok\n\nSam Reall, 21, was diagnosed with Tourette\u2019s syndrome when he was 6. As he\nnavigated his early years, he tried his best to hide the relentless tics \u2014 the\nsudden movements and sounds caused by the condition, for which there is no\ncure. Isolated and confused, Reall believed he was \u201ccursed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone else had the same condition and felt very much alone,\u201d\nsaid Reall, from Illinois.\n\nFollow Technology\n\nThat changed in 2021, when he began posting to TikTok in a bid to raise\nawareness of the condition, which about 1.4 million people in the United\nStates have, according to the CDC.\n\nWhat came next were \u201chundreds of conversations\u201d between Reall and others like\nhim, plus conversations with their loved ones and family members. Reall said\nhe has made \u201clifelong friends\u201d thanks to the Tourette\u2019s community on TikTok,\nbecome more confident and even stopped hiding his tics. He\u2019s also helped\nothers get diagnosed and seek medical help.\n\n\u201cI have had people tell me they were able to better understand their condition\nas a result of my content,\u201d he said, adding that if such a platform existed\nwhen he was younger, it would have \u201ccompletely changed\u201d his childhood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe proposed TikTok ban would be \u201ca huge step backward for the community,\u201d\nReall said. Trying to move it elsewhere just wouldn\u2019t work, he said, noting\nthat he often posts his videos to Instagram, but they do not reach as many\npeople.\n\n###\n\nDeafTok\n\nWhile growing up, Jackie Gonzalez did what many deaf or hard of hearing people\ndo in a hearing-centered world: She learned to read lips. It was \u201cfor\nsurvival,\u201d the Austin-based business owner said via email, \u201cwith those around\nme oblivious to the work I was doing in order to connect.\u201d\n\nYears later, Gonzalez\u2019s TikTok videos on deafness \u2014 including a series in\nwhich she lip-reads conversations of celebrities caught on camera \u2014 have\nracked up millions of views.\n\n\u201cTikTok has seen this ability and has acknowledged it in a way I never could\nhave dreamed of,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAt the heart of what users call \u201cDeafTok\u201d is a world where being deaf doesn\u2019t\nmean missing out. On DeafTok, being able to turn off hearing aids on a noisy\nplane is a perk. Music can be enjoyed through vibrations, and lip-reading is\ntreated not just as a survival strategy but as a talent.\n\nElizabeth Harris also found support on the platform, making American Sign\nLanguage covers of popular songs and talking about everyday experiences, like\ngoing to the movies on a date and wearing closed-caption glasses.\n\nHarris, 22, plans to keep posting her work on other platforms if TikTok is\nbanned, but she said she doesn\u2019t think she can re-create the same kind of\ncommunity on Instagram \u201cbecause how someone engages on TikTok is different,\u201d\nshe wrote in an email.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nShe asked followers in a March video about what they plan to do if there\u2019s a\nban, saying, \u201cI feel like we\u2019re together and we\u2019re connected, and I don\u2019t want\nto lose that.\u201d\n\n###\n\nGriefTok\n\nFor people who are grieving, TikTok can serve as a digital diary, one that\nhelps them log the mourning process of those they have lost \u2014 parents,\nsiblings, children and pets \u2014 and navigate life without them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree-year-old Auria Valdez loved trees and rain and jumping in puddles. She\nconsidered squirrels her friends. In 2018, she died of a rare and aggressive\nform of cancer.\n\nIn the years since her death, her mother, Gabrielle Valdez, has used TikTok to\nraise awareness of childhood cancer, to find coping tools and to connect with\nothers experiencing loss.\n\n\u201cYou never think your child can get cancer, and you definitely never think\nthey can die,\u201d she said. \u201cI am proof that both can happen, so I used my\njourney to help others.\u201d\n\nValdez, 30, said growing a community on TikTok was easier than on other\nplatforms where she felt she had to \u201cpay\u201d her \u201cway to be heard.\u201d TikTok\nprovided her with global reach and positive engagement through use of hashtags\nlike #grieftok and #childloss, she said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nValdez said her account helps her and others talk about death \u201cin a world that\ndoesn\u2019t prepare us ahead of time for it.\u201d Without TikTok as an outlet for her\ngrief, she worries that she will \u201cgo back to holding that all in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarson Drain, 29, first took to TikTok in 2022, after losing both her parents\nthe previous year, just one month apart.\n\n\u201cI would lose an entire community,\u201d Drain said Wednesday of the platform\u2019s\npotential ban, explaining that no one in her personal life had been able to\nrelate to her double loss. But she found \u201ca steady community and support\nsystem\u201d on TikTok among others who had lost parents \u2014 an important part of her\nhealing process.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cTikTok made me realize that I wasn\u2019t alone in my sadness, anger and\ndepression.\u201d\n\n###\n\nRomance BookTok\n\nKristie Carnevale, 34, posted her first romance #BookTok video on a solo\nChristmas Eve during the pandemic and quickly found a place where she could\nopenly discuss the \u201cspicy books\u201d she\u2019s enjoyed since the \u201cFifty Shades of\nGrey\u201d craze. Three years later, the Detroit-based business owner generates\nmuch of her business through TikTok. But that first night speaks to why she\nstuck around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt really spawned out of loneliness and the urge for community and having\nsomeone to talk to,\u201d Carnevale said.\n\nFor a long time, the genre \u201cwas seen as a guilty pleasure\u201d she said. \u201cYou\ndidn\u2019t tell people you read romances.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut over the past few years, the romance #BookTok community has flourished,\nmaking strides in changing the perception of the genre \u2014 which Carnevale notes\nis \u201ca women-led part of the industry,\u201d with books that center on women\u2019s\nstories and desires.\n\nTanya Baker, who joined the community in 2021, said that while there is still\nprogress to be made, it \u201chas made so many people open and comfortable\u201d with\nreading romance books and \u201ctalking about them with no shame.\u201d\n\nOn her account, Baker, 28, dives into various tropes, recommends books and\nshares bookish lifestyle content. The Southern California-based creator said\nthe work on TikTok allowed her to quit her 9-to-5 job and has been a source of\nlifelong friendships that she credits, in part, to the subject matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of the topics that are discussed in romance books are deeply personal\nand it brings forth a certain amount of vulnerability,\u201d she said, \u201cfor someone\nto openly say they loved a book and detail why.\u201d\n\nBaker said she is devastated by the news of a potential ban. \u201cI don\u2019t believe\nthe magic on BookTok can be recreated/duplicated,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWhen Carnevale thinks about a potential ban, \u201cit breaks my heart,\u201d she said.\nShe worries for creators like herself who make a living on the platform, but\nshe also fears losing what she calls \u201ca little corner of happy in a really,\nreally tough world right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTechnology\n\nBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devices\n\nTikTok and the U.S. government dig in for legal war\n\nReview|\u2018The Age of Magical Overthinking\u2019 tries to pinpoint our mental health\ncrisis\n\nEverything TikTok users need to know about a possible ban in the U.S.\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": false}
