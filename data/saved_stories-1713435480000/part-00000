CEO Sundar Pichai arrives at the federal courthouse\nin Washington, Monday, Oct. 30, 2023.\n\nJose Luis Magana | AP\n\nGoogle terminated 28 employees Wednesday, according to an internal memo viewed\nby CNBC, after a series of protests against labor conditions and the company\u2019s\ncontract to provide the Israeli government and military with cloud computing\nand artificial intelligence services.\n\nThe news comes one day after nine Google workers were arrested on trespassing\ncharges Tuesday night after staging a sit-in at the company\u2019s offices in New\nYork and Sunnyvale, California, including a protest in Google Cloud CEO Thomas\nKurian\u2019s office.\n\nSome of the arrested workers in New York and Sunnyvale, who spoke with CNBC\nearlier on Wednesday, said that during the protest they were locked out of\ntheir work accounts and offices, placed on administrative leave and told to\nwait to return to work until being contacted by HR.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, a memo sent by Chris Rackow, Google\u2019s vice president of\nglobal security, told Googlers that \u201cfollowing investigation, today we\nterminated the employment of twenty-eight employees found to be involved. We\nwill continue to investigate and take action as needed.\u201d\n\nThe arrests, which were livestreamed on Twitch by participants, follow rallies\noutside Google offices in New York, Sunnyvale and Seattle, which attracted\nhundreds of attendees, according to workers involved. The protests were led by\nthe \u201cNo Tech for Apartheid\u201d organization, focused on Project Nimbus \u2014 Google\nand Amazon\u2019s joint $1.2 billion contract to provide the Israeli government and\nmilitary with cloud computing services, including AI tools, data centers and\nother cloud infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThis evening, Google indiscriminately fired over two dozen workers, including\nthose among us who did not directly participate in yesterday\u2019s historic,\nbicoastal 10-hour sit-in protests,\u201d No Tech for Apartheid said in a statement,\nadding, \u201cIn the three years that we have been organizing against Project\nNimbus, we have yet to hear from a single executive about our concerns. Google\nworkers have the right to peacefully protest about terms and conditions of our\nlabor. These firings were clearly retaliatory.\u201d\n\nProtesters in Sunnyvale sat in Kurian\u2019s office for more than nine hours until\ntheir arrests, writing demands on Kurian\u2019s whiteboard and wearing shirts that\nread \u201cGoogler against genocide.\u201d In New York, protesters sat in a three-floor\ncommon space. Five workers from Sunnyvale and four from New York were\narrested.\n\n\u201cOn a personal level, I am opposed to Google taking any military contracts \u2014\nno matter which government they\u2019re with or what exactly the contract is\nabout,\u201d Cheyne Anderson, a Google Cloud software engineer based in Washington,\ntold CNBC earlier on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I hold that opinion because Google is an\ninternational company and no matter which military it\u2019s with, there are always\ngoing to be people on the receiving end... represented in Google\u2019s employee\nbase and also our user base.\u201d Anderson had flown to Sunnyvale for the protest\nin Kurian\u2019s office and was one of the workers arrested Tuesday.\n\n\u201cGoogle Cloud supports numerous governments around the world in countries\nwhere we operate, including the Israeli government, with our generally\navailable cloud computing services,\u201d a Google spokesperson told CNBC on\nWednesday evening, adding, \u201cThis work is not directed at highly sensitive,\nclassified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence\nservices.\u201d\n\nThe demonstrations show Google\u2019s increased pressure from workers who oppose\nmilitary use of its AI and cloud technology. Last month, Google Cloud engineer\nEddie Hatfield interrupted a keynote speech from the managing director of\nGoogle\u2019s Israel business stating, \u201cI refuse to build technology that powers\ngenocide.\u201d Hatfield was subsequently fired. That same week, an internal Google\nemployee message board was shut down after staffers posted comments about the\ncompany\u2019s Israeli military contracts. A spokesperson at the time described the\nposts as \u201cdivisive content that is disruptive to our workplace.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas carried out deadly attacks on Israel, killing 1,200 and\ntaking more than 240 hostages. The following day, Israel declared war and\nbegan implementing a siege of Gaza, cutting off access to power, food, water\nand fuel. At least 33,899 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since that\ndate, the enclave\u2019s Health Ministry said Wednesday in a statement on Telegram.\nIn January at the U.N.\u2019s top court, Israel rejected genocide charges brought\nby South Africa.\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Defense reportedly sought consulting services from\nGoogle to expand its access to Google Cloud services. Google Photos is one\nplatform used by the Israeli government to conduct surveillance in Gaza,\naccording to The New York Times.\n\n\u201cI think what happened yesterday is evidence that Google\u2019s attempts to\nsuppress all of the voices of opposition to this contract are not only not\nworking but actually having the opposite effect,\u201d Ariel Koren, a former Google\nemployee who resigned in 2022 after leading efforts to oppose the Project\nNimbus contract, told CNBC earlier on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s really just creating\nmore agitation, more anger and more commitment.\u201d\n\nThe New York sit-in started at noon ET and ended around 9:30 p.m. ET. Security\nasked workers to remove their banner, which spanned two floors, about an hour\ninto the protest, according to Hasan Ibraheem, a Google software engineer\nbased in New York City and one of the arrested workers.\n\n\u201cI realized, \u2018Oh, the place that I work at is very complicit and aiding in\nthis genocide \u2014 I have a responsibility to act against it,\u2019\u201d Ibraheem told\nCNBC earlier on Wednesday. Ibraheem added, \u201cThe fact that I am receiving money\nfrom Google and Israel is paying Google \u2014 I am receiving part of that money,\nand that weighed very heavily on me.\u201d\n\nThe New York workers were released from the police station after about four\nhours.\n\nThe workers were also protesting their labor conditions \u2014 namely \u201cthat the\ncompany stop the harassment, intimidation, bullying, silencing, and censorship\nof Palestinian, Arab, Muslim Googlers \u2014 and that the company address the\nhealth and safety crisis workers, especially those in Google Cloud, are facing\ndue to the potential impacts of their work,\u201d according to a release by the\ncampaign.\n\n\u201cA small number of employee protesters entered and disrupted a few of our\nlocations,\u201d a Google spokesperson told CNBC Wednesday evening. \u201cPhysically\nimpeding other employees\u2019 work and preventing them from accessing our\nfacilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable\nbehavior. After refusing multiple requests to leave the premises, law\nenforcement was engaged to remove them to ensure office safety. We have so far\nconcluded individual investigations that resulted in the termination of\nemployment for 28 employees, and will continue to investigate and take action\nas needed.\u201d\n\nRead the full memo below.\n\nGooglers,\n\nYou may have seen reports of protests at some of our offices yesterday.\nUnfortunately, a number of employees brought the event into our buildings in\nNew York and Sunnyvale. They took over office spaces, defaced our property,\nand physically impeded the work of other Googlers. Their behavior was\nunacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made co-workers feel threatened. We\nplaced employees involved under investigation and cut their access to our\nsystems. Those who refused to leave were arrested by law enforcement and\nremoved from our offices.\n\nFollowing investigation, today we terminated the employment of twenty-eight\nemployees found to be involved. We will continue to investigate and take\naction as needed.\n\nBehavior like this has no place in our workplace and we will not tolerate it.\nIt clearly violates multiple policies that all employees must adhere to \u2014\nincluding our Code of Conduct and Policy on Harassment, Discrimination,\nRetaliation, Standards of Conduct, and Workplace Concerns.\n\nWe are a place of business and every Googler is expected to read our policies\nand apply them to how they conduct themselves and communicate in our\nworkplace. The overwhelming majority of our employees do the right thing. If\nyou\u2019re one of the few who are tempted to think we\u2019re going to overlook conduct\nthat violates our policies, think again. The company takes this extremely\nseriously, and we will continue to apply our longstanding policies to take\naction against disruptive behavior \u2014 up to and including termination.\n\nYou should expect to hear more from leaders about standards of behavior and\ndiscourse in the workplace.\n\nChris\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
