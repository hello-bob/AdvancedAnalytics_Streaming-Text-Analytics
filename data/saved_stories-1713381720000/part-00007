The image shows the output after executing the commands\ngiven in the OP's question. (Note: I redacted the IP address originally shown\nin the OP's image, because the same address has been redacted in the text of\nthe OP's question.)\n\nThe green text shown in the image did not come from the curl command or from\nthe script shown in the answer posted by Linc D..\n\n> There is no way to determine the content of the troubleshoot.sh script that\n> executed on the OP's Mac.\n\nVarious users (including myself) have downloaded the script in an effort to\ndetermine the content. (I found the file to not be in Bash script text form.)\nHowever, there is no way of knowing if the content of the troubleshoot.sh had\nbeen changed since being executed by the OP. Or, if the IP address had been\nswitched to a different computer.\n\nThe script shown in Linc D.'s answer takes certain information and leaves\nnothing behind. Perhaps, that is precisely what the attacker intended for one\nto think. More could have happened. For example, a background process could\nhave been started which did a more thorough search of the OP's files. Or,\nbased on the OP's sharing settings, other computers could have been infected.\n\nSo beyond changing passwords, the OP may consider erasing all volumes mounted\nwhen or since the commands were entered. Reinstalling macOS, then reloading\nfiles only from backups made before entering the commands. Repeat for any\nother computers which may have been vulnerable.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Apr 11 at 9:43\n\nanswered Apr 11 at 8:33\n\nDavid AndersonDavid Anderson\n\n40.3k1313 gold badges6363 silver badges109109 bronze badges\n\nAdd a comment |\n\n## You must log in to answer this question.\n\n##\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
