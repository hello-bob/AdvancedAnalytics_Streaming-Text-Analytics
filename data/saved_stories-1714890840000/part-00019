Although\nnot a member of the tribe, she grew up on Yakama Indian reservation land in\nWapato, Washington.\n\nCruz, a first-generation university student, remembers how families, including\nhers, would often work for local farmers or fishers in exchange for food to\nsupplement the food stamps and free school lunches that most people on the\nreservation relied on to get by.\n\nCollection: Career resources for PhD students\n\nBut once at university, Cruz found that the give and take and sense of\ncommunity that had helped people to survive just didn\u2019t exist on campus. She\nrelied on food stamps issued by the state during her master\u2019s degree in public\nhealth at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cI also took out loans and\nworked several jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the stamps ran out, I\u2019d go to the food\npantry.\u201d These are distribution centres where people facing hunger can receive\ndonated food, akin to food banks in other parts of the world.\n\nNow four years into a PhD in social epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan\nSchool of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, Cruz no longer thinks of\nherself as food insecure \u2014 unable to count on having enough food to be active\nand healthy \u2014 but things are still tight in a city where the cost of living\nrequires a single adult to earn US$62,500 annually to support themselves.\n\nIn addition to working full time on her dissertation, she does 20 hours a week\nas a researcher for a faculty-member colleague, and also teaches to supplement\nher $37,000 stipend (Harvard will be raising PhD student stipends to a minimum\nof $50,000 in July). She shops at a discount farmers\u2019 market where she can buy\na week\u2019s worth of produce for $10, and she shares accommodation with two other\npeople to minimize housing costs.\n\n## Hard evidence\n\nA study published in February revealed that food insecurity at Harvard is not\njust anecdotal (N. M. Hammad and C. W. Leung JAMA Netw. Open 7, e2356894;\n2024). Commissioned by the dean\u2019s office at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health,\nthe survey found that 17% of the 1,287 graduate students who responded and 13%\nof the 458 postdoctoral responders had experienced food insecurity \u2014 figures\nthat were on a par with or exceeded those for the general US population (13%).\n\nRespondents reported having to skip meals, cut down their portions and fill up\non foods with little nutritional value. Some also reported feeling anxious\nthat they wouldn\u2019t have enough to eat. Food insecurity also correlated with\nrespondents feeling that their housing was at risk because of difficulties\nwith rent or mortgage payments\n\n## Widespread issue\n\nThe struggle to find enough food is a problem not just at Harvard. Food\ninsecurity on campus is widespread in the United States and elsewhere, with\none study reporting that 42% of US undergraduate students on average are\nunable to feed themselves what they need to stay healthy (B. Ellison et al.\nFood Policy 102, 102031; 2021). To lessen the struggle faced by hungry\nstudents, some 750 campuses across the United States have set up food\npantries. Research is lacking on food-access issues affecting UK graduate\nstudents and postdocs, but a study of 161 UK universities found that food\ninsecurity was \u201coff the scales\u201d, says developmental psychologist Greta\nDefeyter, who led the work, which is yet to be published. It affected 57% of\nfirst-year undergraduate and foundation-year students.\n\nPostdocs celebrate 24% pay boost in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities\n\nFood insecurity affected 20% of PhD students, \u201cwhich is much higher than the\nUK average\u201d of 6\u201310% of the general population, says Defeyter, who directs the\nHealthy Living Lab, a food-poverty research group based at Northumbria\nUniversity in Newcastle.\n\nA 2016 report about food insecurity at the ten campuses of the University of\nCalifornia (UC) system found that 25% of graduate students and 48% of\nundergraduates didn\u2019t have enough to eat (see go.nature.com/49dedjx).\n\n\u201cWe started producing the data to go to the state and say, we have a problem\nand we need to do something about it,\u201d said Suzanna Martinez, a health-\nbehaviour epidemiologist at UC San Francisco. Martinez led the research in her\nprevious role at the university\u2019s Nutrition Policy Institute in Oakland,\nCalifornia. \u201cSince 2016, the UC system has published updates on food\ninsecurity and actions to address it on its campuses,\u201d she adds. These reports\ncan be accessed online through the university\u2019s Basic Needs Initiative (see\ngo.nature.com/4begaus).\n\n## Social stigma\n\nAs well as lowering academic performance and increasing the risk of\ndepression, food insecurity is associated with social stigma.\n\nGwen Chodur, now a postdoc in nutritional biology at UC Santa Cruz, was a key\nplayer in the fight for food security while a graduate student in nutrition at\nthe UC Davis. Chodur\u2019s monthly pay in 2016, her first year as a graduate\nstudent, was just under $1,700. A first-generation university student who\nhailed from \u2018coal country\u2019 in Pennsylvania, she often skipped lunch as an\nundergraduate at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. Despite\ntaking on a couple of jobs while there, she says, \u201cI was always one\nunanticipated expense away from not being able to finish my degree.\u201d\n\nWhen she started at UC Davis in September 2016, she explains, she didn\u2019t get\nher first cheque until November, which forced her to get creative with dried\nbeans and rice, or stock up on cans of spaghetti hoops for dinner. \u201cIt was\nvery clear to me that higher education wasn\u2019t designed for students like me,\nand that was very obvious from the first day that I set foot on campus,\u201d she\nsays of the deep-seated sense of impostor syndrome she felt.\n\nPhD students face cash crisis with wages that don\u2019t cover living costs\n\nChodur soon learnt that many other graduate students had similar struggles.\nBolstered by this knowledge, she joined others to launch a separate food\npantry, located in the Graduate Student Association office, for colleagues who\nfelt uncomfortable going to the one on campus. \u201cThey were saying things like,\n\u2018If I see my students there, that could undermine my authority in the\nclassroom and it would be embarrassing,\u2019\u201d says Chodur.\n\nSafyer McKenzie-Sampson spoke out about the location of the weekly free food\nmarket at UC San Francisco. McKenzie-Sampson, who was then a PhD student\nresearching racism and adverse maternal health outcomes in Black communities,\nsays having access to the market was helpful after spending half of her pay on\nrent. But a return trip to the food market took one hour from the Mission Bay\ncampus, where she lived and worked. \u201cThere\u2019d be a group of us with our big\ngreen bags collectively doing the walk of shame to the shuttle bus,\u201d she says.\nRaising the issue repeatedly with her mentor resulted in a second food market\nopening at the Mission Bay Campus. \u201cShe was able to have the right\nconversations with the right people,\u201d McKenzie-Sampson says.\n\nEven so, McKenzie-Sampson still did not have enough to eat, and often had to\ntrack down free food provided at campus meetings. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have\nheard of the example of \u2018having sleep for dinner\u2019. Well, there definitely were\nmany nights when I had sleep for dinner,\u201d says McKenzie-Sampson, who is now\nbased at Stanford University in California, where she researches racism and\nethnicity. She hails from Canada and, like other international students, would\nat that time have been ineligible for food stamps provided through the state\nversion of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\n## Legal help\n\nLegislation introduced in California in 2021 broadened eligibility for food\nstamps in the state\u2019s undergraduates. But food insecurity in graduate students\nrose by 14 percentage points between 2021 and 2023, after a fall of 5\npercentage points between 2016 and 2021.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s still the dollar amount that impacts graduate\nstudents,\u201d says Martinez, noting that their stipends are too high for them to\nbe eligible for food stamps.\n\nMartinez, who advises on basic necessities operations on UC campuses, also\nattributes the jump to cost of attendance and increases in the cost of living.\nShe says that the 2023 Basic Needs Initiative survey on food insecurity might\nhave been done before pay hikes for graduate students, which took effect after\na long-standing and ultimately successful strike over pay and conditions ended\nin December 2022. According to the university\u2019s latest report on basic\nnecessities, between 2020 and 2023, the US consumer price index rose by 19%\nand food prices ratcheted up by 24%.\n\n## Next phase\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at Harvard are in the next phase of investigating food\ninsecurity on campus, taking a deeper dive into the details of how graduate\nstudents and postdocs are weathering it and what they need. Nour Hammad, a PhD\nstudent who researches public-health nutrition and is lead author of the\nstudy, says a food pantry is planned. The research continues, she adds, \u201cto\nsee how food insecurity impacts academic performance, their physical and\nmental health, their relationships \u2014 just their whole experience\u201d.\n\nUntil recently, Cruz was part of those efforts as leader of the Harvard Chan\nAlliance for Low Income and First Generation Students Organization, an\nadvocacy group that campaigns for better food access for students in need and\nserves more broadly as a support system. Group chats announce where on campus\nstudents can find free food \u2014 usually leftover pizza, sandwiches and fruit\nfrom meetings.\n\n\u201cI would say all of us PhD students have Tupperware containers at our desks,\nso if there is food, we can take extra home,\u201d says Cruz. On the day she spoke\nto Nature, she had scored some cooked chicken breasts: \u201cI was like, that\u2019s\ngoing to be my protein for the week.\u201d\n\nNature 629, 489-490 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01279-y\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * PhD students face cash crisis with wages that don\u2019t cover living costs\n\n  * Stagnating salaries present hurdles to career satisfaction\n\n  * Postdocs celebrate 24% pay boost in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities\n\n  * Housing: A home on a budget\n\n  * Collection: Career resources for PhD students\n\n  * Training: Getting an academic research position\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Careers\n  * Lab life\n  * Nutrition\n  * Society\n\n## Latest on:\n\nUS National Academies report outlines barriers and solutions for scientist\ncarers\n\nCareer News 02 MAY 24\n\nMy PI yelled at me and I\u2019m devastated.
