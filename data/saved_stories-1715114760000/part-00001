Microsoft could preview the new model as soon as its\nBuild developer conference later this month, the report said.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s new model is internally referred to as MAI-1.

AFP via Getty\nImages\n\nMicrosoft has been setting aside a large cluster of servers equipped with\nNvidia\u2019s graphic processing units along with large amounts of data to improve\nthe model, according to the report.\n\nMAI-1 will have roughly 500 billion parameters, the report said, while\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 is reported to have one trillion parameters and Phi-3 mini\nmeasures 3.8 billion parameters.\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nMicrosoft tapped Suleyman in March as the head of its newly created consumer\nAI unit and hired several employees of Inflection.\n\nThe new model is not carried over from Inflection, although it may build on\ntraining data from the startup, the report added.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * artificial intelligence\n  * chatgpt\n  * google\n  * microsoft\n  * nvidia\n  * OpenAI\n  * 5/6/24\n\nRead Next Google bans deepfake-porn ads as 'egregious' AI nudes surg...\n\n## Columnists\n\n  * ### \n\nSteve Cuozzo\n\n#### Brooklyn Fare Kitchen & Market opens largest location on Lower East Side\n\n  * ### \n\nCharles Gasparino\n\n#### Higher education\u2019s descent into chaos with anti-Israel protests leads to\nthe question \u2014 who is behind this mass indoctrination?\n\n  * ### \n\nLydia Moynihan\n\n#### 40,000 fans, celebrity guests, a secret set: Why Warren Buffett will be\nthe Taylor Swift of capitalism this weekend\n\n### See All Columnists\n\n#### Trending Now in Business\n\n  * This story has been shared 46,496 times. 46,496\n\n### Jeff Bezos moved to Fla. and invested $60M into lab-grown meat -- then Ron\nDeSantis banned it\n\n  * This story has been shared 6,296 times. 6,296\n\n### Jewish JetBlue customer's booking canceled after he complained about\nflight attendant's 'free Palestine' pin\n\n  * This story has been shared 1,957 times. 1,957\n\n### Apollo-Sony bid for Paramount could face antitrust hurdles from feds:\nsources\n\n## Now on Page Six\n\n  * ### Anya Taylor-Joy gleams in futuristic metal minidress for \u2018Furiosa\u2019 photo call in Mexico City\n\n  * ### All the must-see Met Gala 2024 afterparty looks, from Kendall Jenner to Doja Cat\n\n  * ### King Charles could \u2018easily\u2019 see Prince Harry in London after wayward son spent a month trying to get a meeting: sources\n\nSee All\n\n#### Video\n\n  * ### The dark fashions from Met Gala 2024, \u2018The Garden of Time\u2019\n\n## More Stories\n\n### Page Six\n\n#### Gisele B\u00fcndchen is 'deeply disappointed' by 'irresponsible' jokes about\nTom Brady marriage in Netflix roast: report\n\n### NYPost\n\n#### What angry King Charles really uttered when Kate and William arrived late\nto coronation: expert\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * YouTube\n\n## Share Link\n\nclick to copy\n\n## We Value Your Privacy\n\nWe and our 85 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
