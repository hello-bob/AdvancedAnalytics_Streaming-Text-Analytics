Now it\u2019s a ghost town\n\n### The facility was partly funded by the World Bank and touted to become the\ncountry\u2019s \u201ccyber capital.\u201d\n\nPhotography by A J Ghani for Rest of World\n\nPhotography by A J Ghani for Rest of World\n\nBy Faisal Mahmud and Zuha Siddiqui\n\n18 April 2024 \u2022 Kaliakair, Bangladesh\n\nEspa\u00f1olPortugu\u00eas\u4e2d\u6587 (\u7b80\u4f53\u5b57)DeutschFran\u00e7ais\n\n  * Bangladesh launched its first tech park on the outskirts of Dhaka in 2015. But nearly 10 years later, most of the facility remains unused.\n  * Several companies that had committed to setting up offices and factories at the tech park said they have stalled their plans because of bureaucratic red tape or workers' refusal to move to a place lacking basic infrastructure.\n  * The government agency that oversees and manages tech parks told Rest of World it\u2019s a \u201cvery new concept\u201d and is running \u201cquite well.\u201d\n\nWhen Bangladesh inaugurated its first technology business park \u2014 a sprawling\ncampus for tech companies to set up offices and factories \u2014 in 2015, local\ncomputer manufacturer DataSoft swiftly seized the opportunity, becoming one of\nthe first occupants.\n\n\u25cf\n\nKaliakair\n\nKaliakair is 40 kilometers north of Dhaka.\n\nThe Bangabandhu Hi-Tech City \u2014 a 355-acre facility \u2014 is located in Kaliakair,\na small town on the outskirts of capital Dhaka. Built with partial funding\nfrom the World Bank, the tech park was touted as Bangladesh\u2019s \u201ccyber capital,\u201d\nwhich would house 100,000 workers by 2025.\n\nIn 2016, DataSoft set up a factory making affordable laptops at the\nBangabandhu tech park. The company also planned to bring together a research\nand development team at the factory for its future projects.\n\nBut nearly a decade later, DataSoft has hired only three full-time workers at\nthe Bangabandhu factory. The plans for a dedicated research and development\nteam never took off, as none of the company\u2019s engineers wanted to move from\nDhaka to Kaliakair; the few who made the move did not last long.\n\n\u201cWe were in the middle of nowhere,\u201d Golam Kibria Papel, a DataSoft software\nengineer who moved to Kaliakair with a team of 10 in 2017, told Rest of World.\n\u201cThe nearest bazaar was a 10-minute rickshaw ride away, and one of my\ncolleagues thought the place was haunted.\u201d Papel worked at the Kaliakair\nfacility for just two weeks before seeking a transfer back to the company\u2019s\nDhaka office.\n\nLike DataSoft, several other companies that had pledged investments in\nBangabandhu Hi-Tech City dropped their plans due to a lack of infrastructure\naround the campus and bureaucratic red tape. The tech park, which boasts\nstate-of-the-art infrastructure, now lies deserted. Its mostly vacant\nbuildings are decaying from the outside, and covered with cobwebs and grime on\nthe inside. Only 5,000 workers arrive each day to do low-level jobs such as\nassembly-line work and data entry.\n\nBangladesh launched its first tech park, Bangabandhu Hi-Tech City, on the\noutskirts of Dhaka in 2015.\n\nFour former engineers at Bangabandhu told Rest of World the project failed to\ntake off partly because the government never delivered on its promise of a\nhigh-speed train service between Kaliakair and Dhaka.\n\n\u201cLarge buildings [are] primary steps of establishing a high-tech park but to\nmake it a success like [Bengaluru in India], you have to build a whole\necosystem,\u201d Russell T. Ahmed, president of the Bangladesh Association of\nSoftware and Information Services, told Rest of World. \u201cIt has to be a high-\ntech town.\u201d\n\nBangladesh\u2019s minister of state for information technology, Zunaid Ahmed Palak,\nhad said the Bangabandhu tech park would create jobs, and lead to an eventual\nincrease in foreign investment. He did not respond to Rest of World\u2019s requests\nfor comment on the current state of Bangabandhu.\n\nThe tech park was projected to house 100,000 workers by 2025.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep in mind that high-tech parks are still a very new concept in\nBangladesh. It will take time,\u201d GSM Jafarullah, managing director of the\nBangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority, a government agency that oversees and\nmanages tech parks across the country, told Rest of World. He said the\nBangabandhu facility was running \u201cquite well,\u201d with 87 local and foreign\ncompanies manufacturing and assembling mobile phones, ATMs, and other IT\ndevices.\n\nThe construction of Bangabandhu was partly financed by a $120 million loan\nfrom the World Bank, signed in 2011. Summit Technopolis, the real estate arm\nof Bangladeshi conglomerate Summit Group, invested $208 million in the\nproject. In 2019, the Bangladesh government allocated another $31 million for\nsetting up an extension of the existing park.\n\nAccording to a press release published on Summit Technopolis\u2019 website in\nFebruary 2016, the company planned to occupy two blocks at Bangabandhu,\nspanning 91 acres of land and generating 70,000 jobs. Though Summit has an\noffice in the tech park, Rest of World was not able to verify if its plans had\nprogressed as the company did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRest of World found three companies that had signed agreements with Summit\nTechnopolis between 2019 and 2020 \u2014 each promised investments worth millions\nof dollars into the tech park. None of these agreements have so far\nmaterialized, according to the companies.\n\nSummit Technopolis is one of only a few companies with functioning operations\nin the park.\n\nMizanur Rahman, general manager of 3S Group \u2014 which had agreed to spend $12\nmillion to set up a tech-device manufacturing and assembly facility in\nBangabandhu \u2014 told Rest of World the project is \u201cyet to be implemented\u201d and\nwas stalled due to a \u201cprolonged dollar crisis.\u201d\n\nRahman said he has never visited the tech park.\n\nOryx Biotech, a company that had earmarked an investment of $300 million to\nset up a 25-acre plasma fractionation plant in Bangabandhu in 2020, told Rest\nof World construction hasn\u2019t started because \u201cgovernment offices were closed\nfor a long time.\u201d\n\nNefiz Ahmed, head of business administration at SydneySun, a surveillance\nbusiness solutions company that set up an assembly plant at Bangabandhu, told\nRest of World the tech park \u201chas seen a lot of development in the last five\nyears,\u201d but came with many problems, particularly bureaucratic red tape. \u201cIf\nwe get an environmental clearance for our construction, we need to go to the\ngovernment\u2019s Department of Environment,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nHe also faces the challenge of convincing engineers to commute to the tech\npark. \u201c[Engineers] usually do brain work and it\u2019s not easy to make them spend\nthree to four hours on the road,\u201d said Ahmed.\n\nOn a visit in April, Rest of World found the tech park largely abandoned, with\nempty buildings and vast swathes of unoccupied land.\n\nEntrepreneurs who did not move to Kaliakair back when the tech park was being\nlauded and advertised by the government told Rest of World they are relieved.\n\nIn 2013, Syed Almas Kabir, managing director of Metronet Bangladesh,\nconsidered moving his operations to Bangabandhu after attending a \u201cpromising\u201d\ngovernment-organized roadshow. \u201cBack then, the internet was a bit shoddy in\nDhaka, and the prospect of getting the best high-speed internet alone was a\ngreat prospect in Kaliakair,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he\u2019s glad that he decided against moving to the tech park. \u201cThose who\nshifted there or made investments in the park are not at all happy about it,\u201d\nKabir said. \u201cSome of them are even rueing their decisions.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThose who shifted there or made investments in the park are not at all\n> happy about it.\u201d\n\nBangabandhu Hi-Tech City is one of the only two fully constructed high-tech\nparks that the Bangladesh government has set up outside Dhaka. Progress at the\nother park has also been sluggish.\n\nIn 2017, the government inaugurated the Sheikh Hasina Software Technology Park\n\u2014 labeled the \u201cSilicon Valley of Bangladesh\u201d by state IT minister Palak \u2014 in\nJashore, a city close to the country\u2019s southern border with India. Around\n20,000 people were meant to work at the tech park; today, only 1,600 do.\n\nLater that year, the government organized a grand job fair at the Jashore tech\npark to hire an IT workforce for 30 companies that had expressed interest in\nsetting up their offices in the 15-story building. According to local media,\nthe drive resulted in zero employment. Rest of World found that the majority\nof the current workers at the Jashore facility are call center employees for\nleading Bangladeshi startups, including e-commerce company Chaldal, business\nprocess outsourcing company Digicon, and household services marketplace\nShebaXYZ.\n\nChaldal\u2019s engineers \u201cprefer Dhaka\u2019s facilities,\u201d the company\u2019s co-founder, Zia\nAshraf, told Rest of World. He said the company\u2019s Jashore office houses only\n500 call center workers, mostly hired locally from the area.\n\nSeveral companies that had initially pledged investments in Bangabandhu\ndropped out due to a lack of infrastructure around the campus and bureaucratic\nred tape.\n\n\u201cSenior engineers are still very scarce for most of the companies there,\u201d\nAdnan Imtiaz Halim, CEO and co-founder of ShebaXYZ, told Rest of World.\n\u201cHighly skilled engineers are still needed for complex tasks like database\nmanagement. These positions require attracting talent from Dhaka with\ncompetitive salaries.\u201d\n\nDespite the difficulty in attracting workers to the tech parks outside Dhaka,\nBangladesh has continued to seek investment for the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nIn 2021, the World Bank gave Bangladesh another loan \u2014 $555 million \u2014 for a\nproject geared towards promoting \u201cprivate investment, job creation, and\nenvironmental sustainability in participating economic zones and software\ntechnology parks in Bangladesh.\u201d Due to \u201clarge infrastructure development,\ncompletion timelines vary across components\u201d for tech parks, Hosna Ferdous\nSumi, task team leader at the World Bank\u2019s project for private investment and\ndigital entrepreneurship in Bangladesh \u2014 set to end in 2025 \u2014 told Rest of\nWorld. Construction is underway for a software technology park in Dhaka, which\nwould help promote investment and create job opportunities, she said.\n\nFaisal Mahmud is a journalist based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n\nZuha Siddiqui is a Labor x Tech reporting fellow at Rest of World based in\nKarachi, Pakistan.\n\nRead more stories\n\nExporter Newsletter\n\nThe regional flavors of labor-on-demand\n\nA new report digs into the social dynamics of gig work.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\nThe Rise of AI\n\nHow we\u2019re tracking AI incidents around global elections\n\nRest of World is collecting examples of AI being used for campaigning,\nmisinformation, and memes in a regularly updated tracker.\n\nBy Victoria Turk\n\nCreator Economy\n\nIndonesia taps influencers to convince people to move to its new, under-\nconstruction capital\n\nSocial media stars are downplaying fears of deforestation and boredom in\nNusantara.\n\nBy Michelle Anindya\n\n  * About us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Platforms\n  * Newsletters\n  * Donate\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rest of World\n\n", "frontpage": false}
