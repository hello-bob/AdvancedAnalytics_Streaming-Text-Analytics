Not quite yet\n\n05:48\n\n## Japan a 'stable' choice\n\n\"Japan is economically and politically stable, companies here are well\nconnected across the rest of Asia, which is important for partnerships, and\nthe country is closely integrated into global supply chains,\" Schulz said.\n\nKlaus Meder, president in Japan of German manufacturing giant Bosch, has said\nboth China and Japan have compelling reasons for a significant investment of\nthe company's time and efforts.\n\nChina is the world's largest market for cars and Japanese automobile companies\nstill control the largest share of the global market.\n\nBosch has a principle of producing locally for the local market, said Meder,\nwith manufacturing facilities equally important in both countries to meet\nlocal demand.\n\n\"Japan can be a hard market to enter, with many obstacles, the language\nbarrier and different specifications, but once you are established and have\nearned the trust of your customers, then you can build long-lasting\npartnerships,\" he told DW.\n\n\"There is stability here, there is trust, it is rules-based and most companies\nare satisfied with their financial returns,\" he added.\n\nA presence in Japan is also critical as many partners here are active in other\nparts of the world, notably Southeast Asia, Europe, China and both North and\nSouth America, so it is important to be close to the headquarters of those\nfirms to sustain relationships, said Meder, who has been based in Japan for 12\nyears.\n\n## Why big automakers are losing China\n\n16:15\n\n## Japan's industrial tradition\n\nMarcus Schuermann, CEO of the German Chamber of Commerce in Japan, said the\nresults of the study underline the importance of firms' connections with \"the\noldest industrialized country in Asia\" and the growing trend of management\nfunctions being based here.\n\nMore than 90% of firms taking part in the survey said stability \u2014 economic\nstability, the stability of business relationships and safety and social\nstability \u2014 were their prime motivations for being in Japan.\n\nThis was followed by a qualified workforce and advanced infrastructure. A\nstable political environment based on democratic principles and the legal\nprotection of intellectual property were also cited as key reasons.\n\n\"Regional purchasing and sourcing can be done easily in Japan and there are\nmany key global players here, which means it makes a lot of sense for\ncompanies to take that into consideration when they are thinking about a\nlocation for their regional management functions,\" he told DW.\n\nJapan is outstanding when it comes to economic stability, and pricing and cost\nlevels are \"reasonable,\" he added.\n\nThe work force is also qualified and capable, the revenue potential is\npositive and increased use of robotics and automation is helping to overcome\nproblems associated with an aging population.\n\n\"In addition, wages here are very competitive and between 20% and 30% lower\nthan in Germany, which makes Japan more appealing,\" he said.\n\nAnecdotal evidence would also suggest that German companies find it harder to\nconvince employees to transfer to positions in China than Japan, with living\nconditions and the overall environment in Japan more appealing, particularly\nfor families with children, Schuermann said.\n\nEdited by Wesley Rahn\n\nJulian Ryall Journalist based in Tokyo, focusing on political, economic and\nsocial issues in Japan and Korea\n\nSend us your feedback\n\nYour
