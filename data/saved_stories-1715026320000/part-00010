The book deliberately takes a \u201clearn as you code\u201d approach, starting\nslowly with the basics of building a web application and gradually adding\nadditional features and functionality. So long as you have a basic\nunderstanding of the Go syntax, you shouldn\u2019t have trouble following along \u2014\nespecially if you\u2019ve built web applications in other languages before.\n\n#### What if the book isn\u2019t right for me?\n\nIf you don\u2019t get anything from the book, then I don\u2019t want your money. Just\nreply to your purchase receipt within 30 days and I\u2019ll issue a full refund.\n\n#### Does the book use a framework or the standard library?\n\nLet\u2019s Go teaches you to build web applications using the Go standard library\n(rather than a specific framework like Buffalo, Echo or Gin). A few small\nexternal packages are used where it makes sense for security reasons and to\nreduce complexity.\n\n#### Do you offer a student discount?\n\nYes, I\u2019m happy to offer a 25% discount for anyone in full-time education.\nEmail me at alex@alexedwards.net, and I\u2019ll send you a discount code that you\ncan use at checkout.\n\n#### How often do you make updates? How will I get them?\n\nUpdated versions of the book will be emailed to you at the address you provide\nduring checkout. These are usually sent out once every 6 months, to coincide\nwith new major releases of the Go language. You can unsubscribe from the\nupdates at any time.\n\n#### What happens after I buy the book?\n\nYou can buy online by PayPal, credit card or debit card over a secure\nencrypted connection. After purchase you\u2019ll immediately be given a download\nlink for the book, and a email confirmation will also be sent to you.\n\n#### What are the guided exercises?\n\nIn the Professional Package, at the end of the book there are 6 exercises\nwhich extend the application build. Each exercise is broken down into high-\nlevel steps for you to work through, and there are suggested answers for each\nstep. The exercises are designed to use the principles and patterns covered\nearlier in the book, so they\u2019re a good way to test yourself and check your\nunderstanding.\n\n#### How do you provide access to the source code?\n\nThe source code is included in a zip file as part of the Professional Package\ndownload. You can open it on your local machine and start exploring it right\naway.\n\nAny other questions? Email me at alex@alexedwards.net and I\u2019ll be happy to\nhelp.\n\nReady to get started?\n\nGet the book\n\n### Team Licenses\n\nWith a team license you can buy multiple copies of the Professional Package to\nallocate to employees. It\u2019s perfect for getting your team up to speed with Go\nfor new projects, or for onboarding new hires, interns and contractors to your\ntech stack.\n\n> \u201cI can highly recommend Let\u2019s Go, it helped lots of engineers in learning Go\n> at @bitrise.\u201d Gabor Nadai Engineering Manager / Bitrise\n\nUp to 3 team members| Get for $135 \u2192  \n---|---  \nUp to 5 team members| Get for $225 \u2192  \nUp to 10 team members| Get for $395 \u2192  \nUp to 15 team members| Get for $585 \u2192  \nUp to 25 team members| Get for $895 \u2192  \nAnything else| Contact me  \n  \nLet\u2019s Go\n\nPrivacy and GDPR Copyright \u00a9 2017 \u2013 2024 Alex Edwards Enjoy the rest of your\nMonday!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
