Then his identity was revealed.\n\nBy Lila Shapiro, a features writer for New York Magazine. She has written\nabout Hollywood controversies, literary mysteries, and political battles.\n\nPhoto: Michelle Groskopf\n\nPhoto: Michelle Groskopf\n\nPhoto: Michelle Groskopf\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading\nrecommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nOne afternoon nearly 20 years ago, a lawyer named John Robert Nelson began to\nlead a double life. He was 37, working for a small firm in a small town on the\ncoast of Northern California and earning so little that he had to get up at\nthree every morning to deliver newspapers. The alter ego he created led a more\nglamorous existence. \u201cEnty Lawyer,\u201d as that persona was known, was the author\nof Crazy Days and Nights, a Hollywood-gossip blog that would go on to acquire\ncult status among devotees of celebrity dirt. In his first post, Nelson wrote\nthat he\u2019d started the blog because he was in a \u201cunique position of being able\nto tell you what really goes on behind the scenes and what even the gossip\nmagazines can\u2019t find out.\u201d In the short biography he posted on the site, he\nclaimed he had represented big stars going through \u201carrests, divorces,\nbreakups and hookups, new deals and cancellations.\u201d He promised to dish about\nhis clients as well as his own Hollywood adventures with the celebs and\npseudo-celebs who populated his life. If his claims were to be believed, Enty\nwas among the most connected guys in Hollywood. He was friends with Leonardo\nDiCaprio. He drank with Frank Sinatra. He\u2019d picked up Katherine Heigl on the\nside of the highway at three in the morning when she ran out of gas and\ncollected Quentin Tarantino off a bender in Krakow. A disclaimer said the site\npublished \u201cconjecture and fiction\u201d in addition to \u201caccurately reported\ninformation.\u201d It did not specify which anecdotes were which.\n\nIt was a good time to launch a gossip blog. By the mid-aughts, the public had\ngrown weary of the fawning celebrity coverage that mainstream entertainment\noutlets had been offering up for decades. Magazines often worked in\ncollaboration with publicists to present ennobling portraits of the stars and\nthe industry that made them, glossing over drug addictions and infidelities,\nsexual harassment and corruption. Meanwhile, a new cohort of gossip bloggers\nlike Elaine Lui and Perez Hilton seemed to be stripping away the fa\u00e7ade, and\nthey were attracting huge followings on the internet. Enty was never as big as\nthey were, in part because he wrote anonymously. But he offered something they\ndidn\u2019t. Writing in a unique style, hard-boiled and absurd, he trafficked\nprimarily in blind items, entries written as puzzles that could each\ntheoretically apply to at least two different celebrities \u2014 a clever way to\nboth evade potential libel lawsuits and engage readers, who would guess the\nidentities of the stories\u2019 subjects in the comments section. This allowed him\nto be more salacious than Hilton or Lui. In 2016, a glowing Vanity Fair write-\nup declared him \u201cthe King of the Blind Item,\u201d claiming Enty had become \u201ca\ndirect source for gossip that evades the normal channels of celebrity news and\nfeeds directly into the Internet\u2019s never-ending appetite for the juice.\u201d What\nmade him the king, according to Vanity Fair, was that unlike other gossip\nbloggers who might occasionally write a blind item, Enty revealed the\nidentities of his subjects, albeit sometimes years later.\n\nEnty\u2019s Hollywood was a dark and messy world, uglier and more menacing than the\nglamorous town imagined by outsiders. The authenticity of this vision \u2014 and,\nin turn, the authenticity of his scoops \u2014 was bolstered by how pathetic he\ncame across in his own accounts. Enty described himself as a 300-pound heavy-\ndrinking entertainment lawyer who had been married six times, lived in his\nparents\u2019 basement in L.A., and was bullied by his famous clientele \u2014 a zhlub\nwith the right connections and a nose for dirt.\n\nIn reality, Nelson didn\u2019t live in his parents\u2019 basement, and he hasn\u2019t been\nmarried six times \u2014 only three. Today, he and his wife, Victoria, live in\nIndio, California, a desert city near Palm Springs. Until recently, Nelson\ntold me, the people who knew he wrote the blog included his wife, his brother,\na couple of friends and acquaintances, and a handful of celebrities he\u2019d known\nfor years. Then this past fall, his identity was revealed in an unusual legal\ndispute. He\u2019d had an affair with a woman named Cassandra Crose, whom he met\nthrough his podcast, which he\u2019d started in 2018. A fan and aspiring podcaster\nherself, Crose became his collaborator, then his lover. He told her he was\nsingle and wanted to marry her; when she discovered that he was already\nmarried and he stopped returning her calls, she threatened to tell the world\nwho he was. Eventually, he pursued a restraining order against her, a decision\nthat had unintended consequences. First, Crose followed through on her threat,\ncreating a podcast of her own in which she narrated the story of their\nrelationship in harrowing detail. On her Patreon, where she posted\nsadomasochist texts he\u2019d sent her, she framed him as an abuser who\u2019d\ntormented, deceived, and humiliated her. Internet sleuths, and eventually a\nreporter for the Daily Beast, dug up the court documents he\u2019d filed and\nconfirmed that Nelson was in fact Enty Lawyer. And so the gossip blogger\nbecame the gossip.\n\nHis mother, who\u2019d never known about his alter ego, began getting phone calls\nfrom reporters; people on the internet called him an abuser and a grifter. Now\nhe was looking into filing a defamation lawsuit on top of the restraining\norder. He\u2019d submitted thousands of text messages saved on his phone and\ncomputer to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center. And, for the first time\nin his career, he agreed to sit down with a reporter in person.\n\nNelson proposed we meet on a Tuesday in February by some rose bushes at a park\nin Palm Desert. He wouldn\u2019t give me his phone number. I wondered if he might\nbail, but a few minutes after noon, a balding man in a blue checked polo\nshirt, gray chino shorts, and black flip-flops shuffled up and extended his\nhand in my direction. Contrary to what he had written in his X bio, he was not\n300 pounds or even overweight. Sitting at a picnic table in the shade, he\nremoved his glasses, plain black rectangles, and set them on the table. His\nmanner was mild and digressive; he was given to ending almost every thought\nwith a mumbled \u201cor whatever.\u201d As one acquaintance put it, he has the vibe of\n\u201ca Florsheim shoe salesman.\u201d That didn\u2019t bother Nelson. People tend to \u201cforget\nwhat I look like,\u201d he told me. \u201cI like it like that. I don\u2019t need to be the\ncenter of attention.\u201d\n\nIt was an ordinary day in the desert, hot and dry. Nelson drank from a bottle\nof orange Vitamin Water. \u201cI never have abused anybody in my whole life,\u201d he\ntold me. On the contrary, Crose had been abusing him, he said. Nearby, someone\nwas on a lawn mower, cutting grass. Ignoring the noise and dust, Nelson said\nhe doubted the restraining order would stop her from lying about him. \u201cCan I\ntell you why?\u201d he asked. \u201cMoney. Content. The incentive for her is to ratchet\nit up.\u201d That was something he knew a lot about. \u201cTo get new content,\u201d he said,\n\u201cyou\u2019ve just got to start making up stuff.\u201d\n\nNelson says he grew up in Washington, D.C., the son of two government workers.\nHis parents split up when he was 8. He was reluctant to tell me much about his\nfamily (and the details he did share are impossible to corroborate). The only\nmemory he recounted of his parents was of them fighting before they got\ndivorced. \u201cI would wake up to them screaming at each other,\u201d he said. His\nmother was director of the national school-lunch program and later the\nnational director of WIC, the nutrition program for women and children. His\nfather lacked ambition, Nelson said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really care about advancement\nor anything like that.\u201d\n\nAfter the divorce, Nelson and his mother moved around. When he was in high\nschool, they lived near Dallas, where Nelson claimed he had his first exposure\nto show business. He recalled attending a music festival with a friend his\njunior year of high school; the friend was doing lighting work, and the two\nended up backstage. He was fascinated by how different the musicians seemed\nfrom their public personae. \u201cYou go see this person you\u2019ve admired, and\nthey\u2019re treating some staffer like crap,\u201d he said. A few actors were hanging\nout with them backstage. \u201cThat was the first time that I saw them up close.\nThey looked completely different in real life,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI\u2019m watching\npeople do all kinds of crazy drugs and injecting stuff.\u201d This, he decided, was\nwhat he wanted to do. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be out in front,\u201d he thought. \u201cI like\nbeing in the nuts and bolts and seeing what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nWhile attending Texas Lutheran University in the late \u201980s, Nelson wrote a\ncolumn in the student paper under a pseudonym. He pretended to be a rube who\nhad grown up on a farm, a fish out of water perplexed by student life on a\nbusy college campus. Around then, he started working as a freelance concert\npromoter, but he didn\u2019t earn enough to consistently pay the bills, so after\ngraduating, he got a job at an airline answering phones, then moved to sales.\nIn his early 30s, he applied to the Thomas Jefferson School of Law \u2014 a low-\nranked establishment that later lost its bar accreditation \u2014 because he did\nnot want to risk applying to a place that might reject him. He passed the bar\nin 2005 and was hired by a firm in Humboldt County, California, handling\nprobate proceedings and business contracts.\n\nWorking for a small firm in the middle of nowhere, he was bored and restless.\nHe told me the L.A. \u201cIt\u201d girl Cory Kennedy, whom he described as a friend, had\nrecently started a blog, and he thought, \u201cHey, I can try that. It\u2019s free.\u201d\n(Kennedy said she doesn\u2019t remember ever meeting him.) Nelson launched the blog\nin November 2006. While he passed his days in the office, Enty Lawyer\nsupposedly went on a date at the L.A. celebrity haunt the Ivy, ran into The\nSopranos star Jamie-Lynn Sigler, and represented an \u201cA-list actress\u201d who\n\u201calmost got arrested for crack.\u201d (Nelson said that during this time, he was\nvisiting L.A. once a month and staying with friends.)\n\nSix months later, Nelson moved to L.A. He thought he could get back into the\nmusic business, maybe manage some musicians. Instead, he took a job at a small\nfirm in Central L.A. where he handled probate law. He told me he had a side\nhustle as an entertainment attorney and showed me a few emails from 2011 in\nwhich he appeared to be representing a small-time producer. (He was known, he\nsaid, for being a person who would handle legal matters \u201cfor cheap.\u201d) He first\nmet Hollywood people through friends he\u2019d made as a concert promoter, he said,\nand, later, through his work as a lawyer.\n\nNelson didn\u2019t try to make money from the blog for the first few years. \u201cIt was\nmore about making sure everybody had a good time.\u201d A small community formed\naround the site. The same people were in the comments every day, and he got to\nknow some of them. He ran a Facebook page as Enty and made a point of wishing\nevery member a happy birthday. He met his third wife, Victoria, through that\ncommunity. He told me he never fooled himself that the blog was a big deal.\nWhen Hilton and other gossip sites posted a production still of Jennifer\nAniston topless, they got cease-and-desist notices. Nelson, who had also\nposted the picture, didn\u2019t, but he took it down anyway and wrote on the blog\nthat he\u2019d received the notice. \u201cI wanted to be part of the group,\u201d he told me.\nAnother gossip writer, Ted Casablanca, who was known as \u201cthe King of Blind\nItems\u201d before he retired in 2012, recalled Nelson reaching out to him around\nthis time. \u201cIt\u2019s like he was pulling up to a poker game,\u201d Casablanca said. \u201cHe\nwanted in.\u201d\n\nFans seemed to buy what Enty was selling. They\u2019d speculate about his sourcing,\ntheorizing at one point that Robert Downey Jr. was dropping tips in the\ncomments. (Downey\u2019s publicist flatly denied this.) But fellow gossip writers\nwere not so easily impressed. Hilton, not exactly a figure known for\njournalistic scruples, felt that Enty\u2019s standards on the blog frequently fell\nshort. \u201cI think he\u2019s full of shit,\u201d he told me. Another prominent gossip\nwriter doubted his sourcing. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way he\u2019s getting that much\nscandalous information on a daily basis,\u201d they told me. \u201cI get maybe two good\nblind items a week, and one of them might just be that some TV show will start\nfilming in March.\u201d The writer came to believe Nelson regurgitated most of his\nitems from message boards like Reddit and Lipstick Alley and turned them into\nblinds. The posts that resonated, they added, usually rang true because they\nplayed into ideas that readers already had about any given celebrity. \u201cWhat he\ndoes is very sleight of hand,\u201d the writer said. \u201cHe\u2019d write a blind item, and\nthe reader would say, I think I\u2019ve heard this before.\u201d\n\nTake one typical post from 2006, in which Enty described an encounter with an\n\u201cA list forever\u201d movie star in his 60s who ostensibly spent a week in Enty\u2019s\noffice preparing for litigation. Over the course of the week, Enty claimed to\nhave witnessed excessive drinking, cheating, a party with other aging stars\n\u201cin various stages of undress\u201d and very young women, and middle-of-the-night\n\u201cemergency\u201d phone calls summoning Enty to fetch liquor and whatever else the\nsituation required. Eight years later, Enty reposted the item and wrote that\nthe misbehaving star was Sean Connery. Connery had long had a reputation for\nheavy drinking and womanizing, so it was not inconceivable that he could have\nbehaved that way. But what made the story compelling was that it was presented\nas a firsthand account, and that aspect was certainly fiction. When the\nanecdote had supposedly taken place, a couple years before Nelson had written\nit, Nelson was still in law school. According to public records, he had not\nyet lived in L.A.\n\nWhen I brought this up with Nelson, he admitted that he\u2019d never worked for\nConnery. He said he\u2019d gotten the anecdote secondhand from a law-school friend\nwho\u2019d worked as a gopher at an L.A. firm. (When I asked him to connect me with\nthe friend, he declined.) \u201cObviously, as a lawyer, I\u2019m very big on the truth,\u201d\nNelson told me. He said he never outright made up items but sometimes\npublished tips from readers that he had \u201cno way to verify. The less I believe\nit, the more obscure and generalized I will make it. But I don\u2019t just randomly\nmake up stuff.\u201d He might fudge an anecdote now and then, but the truth\nmattered. \u201cThe heart of whatever you\u2019re saying needs to be true.\u201d\n\nEnty didn\u2019t always pretend to have witnessed the action with his own eyes.\nOften, he would publish a tip without any framing. Nelson told me that some of\nhis best tips came from paparazzi and reporters. That may be true. In 2013, he\nwrote that a superstar had fired an employee after discovering a video of him\nmasturbating to pictures of her and her daughter. When the star learned that a\nmagazine planned to go public with this story, she agreed to pose for the\ncover in exchange for the piece getting killed. \u201cIn the next couple of months\nwhen you see a cover and go wtf, now you know why,\u201d Enty wrote. A few months\nlater, Beyonc\u00e9 showed up on the cover of Shape, a now-defunct fitness\nmagazine. He reposted the blind with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name attached and published it\nagain eight months later, when the fired employee \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s bodyguard \u2014 died\nin a bizarre break-in in Miami. While the story was never confirmed, major\npublications reported on the allegations and credited Crazy Days and Nights.\nNelson said he had gotten the tip from a writer who was frustrated that the\nmagazine had traded away his big scoop.\n\nFive years in, in 2011, Nelson began to look into ways to profit from the\nsite. Money was tight, and L.A. wasn\u2019t cheap. He ran Google ads and began\nwriting every day from his desk at the firm and at home on the weekends,\nposting as many as ten items a day, sometimes more. The following spring, he\npublished one of the most viewed entries in the blog\u2019s history, a blind about\na \u201cformer B list television actress\u201d who he alleged had been physically abused\nby her father and boyfriends. The post went viral after a frequent commenter\nwho went by \u201cHimmmm\u201d claimed (without proof) that the actress was Hayden\nPanettiere, the former child star who\u2019d recently been cast in Nashville. The\ncommenter also claimed, outrageously, that her abuse was part of a much larger\nstory and suggested readers take a look at Diana Jenkins, a Bosnian-born\nsocialite, entrepreneur, and ex-wife of an executive at Barclays: \u201cShe\u2019s the\nRosetta Stone of every scandal and perversion from Hwood all over the globe.\nShe\u2019s been running a high class call girl/party-girl ring for Arabs, Wall\nStreet, DC, Royals, and Hollywood elites.\u201d Panettiere, they added, was her\n\u201clittle pet.\u201d The post got 100 million page views. By the fall of 2012, Nelson\nhad quit his day job and was supplementing income from the site with legal\nwork on the side.\n\nOn the heels of that success, Nelson wrote more and more about rumors of\nsexual transgressions. He told me he had always been a \u201cchampion of women\u201d and\nwas primarily motivated by injustice. Years before places like The New Yorker\nand the New York Times published accounts of the abuses of Harvey Weinstein,\nMatt Lauer, and Kevin Spacey, Nelson took thinly veiled swipes at them in his\nblind items. In 2016, for instance, he wrote about a \u201cproducer/mogul\u201d who\nthreatened to destroy an actress\u2019s career after she \u201crefused his advances.\u201d\nWhen the Weinstein stories blew up, Enty reposted the blind with Weinstein and\nSaoirse Ronan\u2019s names attached. (Ronan has never been connected with Weinstein\nin any other reporting.) In a profile of Enty for the Daily Beast, the former\nsex-and-dating columnist Mandy Stadtmiller called him a whistleblower. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot just about \u2018dirty laundry,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s about justice.\u201d It became\nsomething of a trope, in that moment of reckoning, to recast gossip writers as\nunlikely heroes of public-service journalism. The Ringer went so far as to\ncontend that they had become \u201cindustry watchdogs.\u201d This argument, though,\nelided the thread of old-fashioned misogyny that ran through many of Nelson\u2019s\nposts. He sometimes implied the women who slept with studio bosses were asking\nfor it. As critics of the site have pointed out, Enty was fixated on \u201cyacht\ngirls,\u201d a common euphemism for actresses who engaged in informal high-end\nprostitution, and wrote extensively about the \u201chundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds\u201d of such women who, he absurdly claimed, populated Hollywood (one of\nhis most frequent targets was Meghan Markle).\n\nMe Too was a breakthrough moment for the blog. In 2018, Nelson launched his\nPatreon and daily podcast. In his spare time, he embarked on a strange side\nproject for a guy who\u2019d always operated from behind a veil of anonymity: He\nran for Congress. Nelson, who campaigned as a progressive Bernie Democrat to\nrepresent Ventura County, California, told me he had two reasons for embarking\non this mission. He was \u201cticked off about health care\u201d and interested in\npeering \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d of the electoral process. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I thought\nI could win,\u201d he said. According to Federal Election Commission filings, only\n12 people contributed to his effort. I spoke with two of them. One had given\n$400 but struggled to recall anything about his campaign. \u201cI feel like there\nmight have been a Taylor Swift\u2013ticket hookup?\u201d she said. \u201cAm I crazy?\u201d The\nother donor said she had no memory of meeting Nelson or hearing his name. When\nI read her the names of the other 11 donors, she realized she knew five of\nthem. They were all mothers of girls at her daughter\u2019s elementary school.\nCuriously, all of them had given $390. I later texted her to ask if by any\nchance she recalled getting Taylor Swift tickets around that time. \u201cYes, that\ndoes jog my memory,\u201d she replied. Her daughter had gone to the show with a\ngroup of girls from school. \u201cIt went as a campaign contribution?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWho knew?!\u201d Nelson told me he did offer Taylor Swift tickets to donors. As a\nformer concert promoter, he had ways of getting them for free. But he said\nhe\u2019d raised the money only to pay his campaign manager. (He ended up coming in\nlast in the race with 3.7 percent of the vote.)\n\nOver the next few years, the content of Nelson\u2019s posts and podcasts grew\ndarker, weirder, and more conspiratorial. He wrote about a celebrity \u201crape\nclub,\u201d where world-famous actors were forced to sexually assault children to\npreserve their careers, and a \u201cspectacular ritual killing\u201d by a prominent\npolitical family. And he picked up the Jenkins rumors \u2014 the ones a commenter\non his site had started \u2014 and ran with them. Nelson claimed that Jenkins\u2019s\ncoffee-table book, Room 23, which features photographs of celebrities in a\npenthouse suite in Beverly Hills, was really an advertisement for an escort\nring and accused Jenkins of coercing vulnerable actresses into joining. After\nJenkins was cast in The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in 2021, he tweeted\nthat she had \u201cspent a LOT of time with Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d Uncharacteristically,\nhe posted what he claimed was evidence: a photograph of a woman he said was\nJenkins laughing at a party with Epstein and Trump. When people pointed out\nthat the woman was actually the model Ingrid Seynhaeve (Hilton tweeted at Enty\nthat he was a \u201cmoron\u201d and a \u201cliar\u201d), he refused to take it down, relenting\nonly after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from Jenkins. In 2022, she\nfiled a defamation suit against Enty, who had somehow never been sued before.\nHer complaint alleged that Nelson had intentionally invented these stories for\nprofit, making ever more outrageous claims in a ploy to grow his site. (Nelson\npublished an apology to her after settling the suit last June.) \u201cEnty Lawyer\nhas published fiction,\u201d the lawsuit read.\n\nBrian Pocrass, an attorney and producer, shared this view. Around then,\nPocrass had begun producing a documentary, She Was Here, about Heather\nO\u2019Rourke, an actress best known for playing a child sucked into a supernatural\nvoid in the 1982 horror film Poltergeist. For years, it had been rumored that\npeople involved in the production of Poltergeist had been \u201ccursed\u201d in part\nbecause of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s sudden death when she was 12. But Nelson\u2019s O\u2019Rourke\nblind was of a different order. In 2017, he wrote that three men at a studio\nwhere a child actor had been filming a TV show assaulted her and \u201cinserted\nsomething inside\u201d her and that she died from the resulting injuries. The rumor\nquickly gained traction in conspiratorial corners of the internet, where\nEnty\u2019s mainstream appraisal as a Me Too whistleblower lent it credibility.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s death in fact had been well documented. Her parents had filed a\nmedical-malpractice suit alleging that her doctors had failed to diagnose a\nlong-standing small-bowel obstruction. Still, Pocrass wanted to do his due\ndiligence and try to understand where the story was coming from. In the blind,\nNelson claimed that an actress who co-starred with O\u2019Rourke in the TBS comedy\nRocky Road had supposedly witnessed some of the abuse and sent him a brief\ndescription of what happened that day. Pocrass tracked down the actress, who\ntold him she\u2019d never seen or experienced anything described in the blind. A\nteacher on the set told him the same thing, as did the actress\u2019s mother, who\nwas by her side throughout the shoot. He came to believe that whoever had\nwritten the blind \u2014 either Nelson or the person who submitted the tip \u2014 had\nmade up the story out of whole cloth. It was not an accident, he argued, that\nRocky Road was O\u2019Rourke\u2019s most obscure credit. \u201cThey did their homework,\ntaking the least-recognizable credit on her IMDb, and made up an atrocious\nstory,\u201d Pocrass said. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s family told him about the pain the blind had\ncaused them. \u201cIt\u2019s enough what the family has gone through and then all of a\nsudden, 30 years later, to have people trash her memory and legacy with such\nabsurd lies?\u201d he said. \u201cOf course they\u2019re angry. Wouldn\u2019t you be?\u201d\n\nNelson took down the item in 2019 after learning O\u2019Rourke\u2019s family was upset.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I really thought about Heather\u2019s family when I wrote the\noriginal story,\u201d he told me. This prompted a realization: \u201cOkay, well, this\ncan affect people.\u201d\n\nNelson and Crose during his first visit to Florida in December 2022; Photo:\nCourtesy of the subject\n\nI met Cassandra Crose and her mother, Julie, a semi-retired accountant, in a\npub near Crose\u2019s apartment in Clearwater, Florida. Crose described herself as\na hippie but was dressed soberly in a black T-shirt and black-rimmed glasses,\nher long dark hair tucked behind her ears. She riffled through a leather\nbriefcase packed with court documents and removed a stack of papers. In his\ninitial restraining order, Nelson wrote that he had attempted to break things\noff with Crose by blocking her, ignoring her, and telling her to stop\ncontacting him. Crose said that wasn\u2019t true. \u201cHe never tried to break up with\nme,\u201d she said. \u201cFor someone who\u2019s a fucking lawyer, you would think he would\nprovide some actual evidence.\u201d\n\nCrose met Nelson in August 2022. She was a single mother of three who worked\nas an investigator for a gas-and-electric company; in her spare time, she\nhosted two podcasts: Cassandra Explains It All, in which she waxed nostalgic\nabout the movies and television shows of her millennial childhood, and Welcome\nto the Carterverse, about the now-deceased teen pop star Aaron Carter. Two of\nher kids, ages 6 and 8, have special needs, and she couldn\u2019t afford a\nbabysitter. The podcasts were \u201csomething I could do at night when they\u2019re\nasleep and that gave me a social life,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of\nfriends.\u201d\n\nWhile researching episodes, she came across Enty, who seemed to know\neverything about the child actors of that era. For her 35th birthday that\nAugust, Crose spent $250 on his Patreon to co-host a podcast episode with him.\nShe asked if they could do an episode about The Wonder Years. \u201cI thought maybe\nhe could give me tea on Fred Savage,\u201d she said. After recording it, Nelson\npraised her work and invited her to host more episodes with him. Over the\nfollowing months, they recorded podcasts about Full House and Growing Pains.\nTheir email exchanges took on a flirtatious tone. He told her he\u2019d been\nmarried and divorced a few times and was now living alone out in the desert.\nAfter sharing his real name, he told her not to worry about signing an NDA. \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t want to have people in my life who had to sign NDAs to know me,\u201d he\ntexted her in October 2022. \u201cSo I just don\u2019t have people in my life.\u201d Later\nthat day, he wrote again, this time to confess that he had feelings for her:\n\u201cIf I\u2019m wrong or misunderstanding how you feel about me, please let me know.\u201d\n\nCrose hadn\u2019t had great luck with men, she told me. She\u2019d met the father of her\nkids \u2014 \u201ca drug addict with an anger problem\u201d \u2014 at a Rainbow Gathering in\nArizona. Nelson seemed different. \u201cHe is not a drug addict,\u201d she remembered\nthinking. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a criminal record. He\u2019s a respectable person. He\u2019s\na lawyer. I didn\u2019t think someone like that would ever be interested in me.\u201d\nNelson was texting her dozens of times a day and calling her nearly every\nnight. He told her he was thinking about moving to Florida so they could be\ntogether. He said he loved her, and she said she loved him too. Their texts\nbecame sexts. Nelson shared his fantasies of dominating and owning her. (\u201cGive\nyourself over to me. Life will be so much easier,\u201d he wrote.) Hoping to learn\nhow to please him, Crose listened to a podcast about BDSM. They talked about\nbuying a house together, getting married, having kids. In December, he visited\nfor the first time.\n\nCrose\u2019s mother met him on that trip. He looked older than in the pictures he\u2019d\nshared. \u201cHe said he was 47,\u201d Julie told me. As they eventually learned, he was\n54. Julie found him standoffish and controlling. At a restaurant, he told\nCrose to order a salmon salad. When the order arrived with candied pork belly,\nhe picked each bit of pork off the plate. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want her eating that,\u201d\nJulie recalled. \u201cHe keeps looking at the menu and he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, I\ncan\u2019t wait to move here. Everything here is so cheap.\u2019 And I\u2019m looking at her\ngoing, \u2018He\u2019s moving here already? \u2019\u201d\n\nA week after his visit, Crose was contacted on Twitter by a woman who said she\nwas Nelson\u2019s wife. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first person he cheated on me with. You\nwon\u2019t be the last,\u201d the woman wrote. \u201cHe will despise you too, at some point.\nHe doesn\u2019t even care about his own children.\u201d Nelson had never mentioned any\nchildren. Shocked, Crose reached out to Nelson, who apologized and assured her\nthat he and the woman were separated. He claimed his ex was in denial about\nthe end of the marriage. He said he hadn\u2019t told her about their two kids, ages\n10 and 11, because he was worried she wouldn\u2019t love him anymore if she knew.\nHe texted her that he was buying a ticket to Florida. \u201cI\u2019m going to move out\nthere, even with you hating me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m still going to keep all my\npromises.\u201d\n\nAt the pub, Crose told me she \u201cwasn\u2019t in a position to say no.\u201d He had said\nthe things she wanted most to hear: that he would take care of her and her\nchildren, that he loved her and wanted to share his life with her. \u201cI wanted\nto believe him,\u201d she said. Her mother interjected. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the want,\nit was the needs,\u201d she said. He was sending her money through her Patreon,\nordering groceries to her house, and offering to pay for her kids\u2019 summer\ncamp. The kids had eight specialized-therapy sessions a week. Someone had to\ntake them while Crose was at work. \u201cShe needed the support,\u201d Julie said.\n\nThat visit lasted three and a half weeks. He spent Christmas Eve with Crose\u2019s\nextended family and cooked dinner every night. He picked the kids up from\nschool, cleaned their rooms, did laundry, took them to their therapy\nappointments. He started paying for the appointments, too. Then one day in\nJanuary, \u201che was acting weird,\u201d she recalled. He texted her saying that he was\nat a bar and needed to buy a phone charger. He didn\u2019t come back.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, Crose sent him dozens of messages pleading with him to\ncall her. She told Nelson she loved him. When he didn\u2019t respond, she said she\nmight be forced to go \u201cpublic\u201d about who he was and everything that had\nhappened between them. That seemed to do the trick. Ten minutes later, Nelson\ncalled and said that he really was in love with her, that his marriage was\nover, and that divorce proceedings were underway. He claimed he\u2019d returned to\nCalifornia because he felt guilty about abandoning his daughters.\n\nNelson said he would fly back to Florida later that month. When he failed to\nshow up, Crose brought up a series of messages his wife had sent her. \u201cIt\u2019s\nstuff that you probably would never want to get out there if I\u2019m being\nhonest,\u201d she wrote in a text. His wife had told her that he didn\u2019t know any\ncelebrities and had never worked as an entertainment lawyer. \u201cHe just wants to\nfeel special,\u201d she\u2019d written. \u201cHe makes up the blinds. He\u2019s a grifter.\u201d\n(Nelson said his wife was lying in order to make him \u201cunattractive\u201d to Crose.)\n\nHe returned for a visit at the beginning of February. They had sex. Nelson\ncooked dinosaur chicken nuggets for the kids. Once again, Crose thought that\nhe\u2019d returned indefinitely. He left for California after only two days. She\nsaid they never saw each other in person again.\n\nOver the next nine months, Crose repeatedly threatened to tell the world what\nhad unfolded between them if she learned that he\u2019d been lying to her. But she\nalso told him that she loved him more than anyone she\u2019d loved before. Nelson,\nlikewise, told her he\u2019d never done anything in his life that would make him\n\u201cworthy to have someone like you as my wife.\u201d At the pub, she turned her\nlaptop around to show me months of Zoom invitations labeled \u201cfun time.\u201d \u201cEvery\nsingle night, he\u2019s literally masturbating in front of me,\u201d she said.\nAfterward, they\u2019d watch the classic romantic-comedy seriesThe Love Boat\ntogether.\n\nIn March, Nelson said he was coming back to visit. He sent her photographs\nfrom the Tampa airport but never showed. He told her he\u2019d had to fly back home\nto deal with an emergency. She later realized he\u2019d found those photos online;\nhe\u2019d never been in Tampa at all. Whenever Crose confronted him, he had an\nexcuse: He was stuck somewhere, his wife was drunk, his kids were missing\nschool. Crose felt sorry for him and guilty for doubting him. When it came to\nmen, she told me, she had a history of \u201cburying her head in the sand.\u201d\n\nThat summer, Crose asked Nelson for proof that he and his wife were really\ndivorcing. Nelson emailed Crose what he claimed was a page from the divorce\nfilings. She was reassured. They began to make plans for Crose and her three\nchildren to move in with him in California. Nelson made a shared Google\nspreadsheet to help them stay organized. In October, he sent her the names of\nthe schools where the kids could go and told her he\u2019d talked to the\nadministrators. He also told her he\u2019d booked a flight to Florida and would\ndrive her and the kids back to California. Crose pulled her kids out of the\nspecialized Medicaid therapy they\u2019d spent years on a wait list to obtain. She\nnotified the children\u2019s schools that they would be leaving in the middle of\nthe year. The teachers arranged good-bye parties. Relatives gathered at her\ngrandfather\u2019s house to see her off. \u201cShe said good-bye to her grandfather\nknowing she\u2019d never see him alive again,\u201d Julie said. \u201cThe whole family is up\nthere crying their eyes out.\u201d\n\nIn November, after Crose had packed all their belongings, Nelson texted that\nhis flight to Tampa had been delayed, then texted to say it had been delayed\nonce more. \u201cI have been on the phone with AA for the past hour,\u201d he wrote. The\nnext day, he wrote that he\u2019d arrive that afternoon. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said.\nThirty-two minutes later, there was a knock on Crose\u2019s door. An officer from\nthe sheriff\u2019s department handed her a restraining order.\n\nFrom left: During Nelson\u2019s nearly monthlong visit in January 2023 Photo:\nCourtesy of the subjectCrose at home last November.

From top: During Nelson\u2019s nearly monthlong visit in January 2023 Photo:\nCourtesy of the subjectCrose at home last November. Photo: Courtesy of the\nsubject\n\nAt the park in the desert, Nelson invited me to imagine that I had done\nsomething embarrassing when I was younger: \u201cLet\u2019s say when you were 18, you\ndecided you were going to make a porn or something like that. Maybe you make\nthree or four of them and then you forget about it. You go to college, you\nhave a life, you have a really good career, but one where somebody will fire\nyou if they find out about this or it\u2019ll ruin your reputation. And then you\nget together with somebody and you think, Oh, well, I can trust them, or\nwhatever. And you tell them your story. Then a few weeks later, you go,\n\u2018Really, I don\u2019t want to be with this person.\u2019 And the first thing they do is\nsay, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re not with me, I\u2019m going to tell the whole world your\nsecret.\u2019\u201d That had been his life for the past year, he said. \u201cFrom January 15,\n2023, until now. Every single time I wouldn\u2019t call her back, she would say,\n\u2018I\u2019m going to blow up your world.\u2019\u201d\n\nNelson said he\u2019d been feeling stressed and vulnerable when he first visited\nCrose. Jenkins, the socialite he\u2019d falsely accused of running an international\nescort ring, had recently sued him, and he wanted someone he could confide in.\nHe said he turned to Crose in part because she was one of the few people who\nknew who he was. She was also \u201can attractive person who knew what to say and\nwas good at podcasting,\u201d he told me. And then she \u201croped\u201d him in with a story\nabout her abusive ex and asked for his advice in case the guy ever tried to\ntake her children away.\n\nHe said he wouldn\u2019t have necessarily returned for a second visit if not for\nthe fact that his wife found a Polaroid of him and Crose in his luggage. They\nfought, leaving Nelson with \u201cno place to go.\u201d When he and Crose discussed a\npossible return to Florida, he thought, \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea. I\u2019m pretty\neasily convinced.\u201d One of his ex-wives told me later that Nelson was\n\u201cextremely passive and completely anti-confrontational.\u201d The ex, who asked not\nto be named, said her marriage with Nelson ended after she discovered he was\ncheating on her. (Nelson said this wasn\u2019t how he remembered it.) Had she not\nleft, she said, \u201cI think he would have stayed married to me until he died.\u201d\n\nIt was on his second trip to Florida that Nelson began to feel he\u2019d made a\nmistake. He was taken aback when he realized Crose had told her friends and\nfamily that he was Enty. \u201cMy mom didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said. For two decades,\nperhaps just 20 people knew what he did for work. Now that number was closer\nto 30. \u201cThat really freaked me out,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told me he barely remembered that three-and-a-half-week trip around\nChristmas. He was in a \u201cfog,\u201d he said. \u201cThings got weird.\u201d He said she was\nconstantly asking him to do chores and help out with her children \u2014 not\nexactly the fun fling he\u2019d imagined: \u201cI had assumed the father mantle or\nwhatever when I just met her literally for the first time a couple of weeks\nago.\u201d When he told Crose he missed his kids and wanted to go home, she said\nshe already had made dinner plans with her mother and needed him to watch her\nkids that night. He felt Crose was keeping him a prisoner.\n\nNelson showed me a selection of texts Crose sent him over the course of that\nyear. In April, she wrote to him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t fucking call me back right now\nand apologize and have an actual adult conversation like I\u2019m a human being,\nnot a piece of abuse trash that you can just use and throw away I swear to\nFucking God. I will literally show the entire world who you are.\u201d\n\nIn his initial restraining order against Crose, Nelson claimed their\nrelationship had ended in March 2023, a month after his final visit. (In fact,\nit continued through November.) He said Crose had stalked him and repeatedly\nthreatened to dox him in an effort to harm his business and personal life. I\nasked if he had ever tried to simply break up with her. \u201cAll the time,\u201d he\nsaid. What words had he used? Nelson hesitated. \u201cYou can\u2019t actually say, \u2018I\nwant to break up.\u2019 You can\u2019t actually do that,\u201d he said. Why not? \u201cBecause you\nliterally get these texts every other day. \u2018If you don\u2019t call me, if you don\u2019t\ndo this, if you don\u2019t do that, I\u2019m going to ruin your life.\u2019 Blackmail doesn\u2019t\nhave to be about money.\u201d\n\nNelson admitted he\u2019d repeatedly lied to Crose, telling her he was single and\nyounger than he was, pretending to buy plane tickets he\u2019d never bought,\nsending her photographs he hadn\u2019t taken to make it look like he had tried to\nvisit her when he\u2019d never left Indio. Yes, he told Crose over and over that he\nand his wife were divorcing when they\u2019d never even separated. He\u2019d doctored a\ndocument to look like a page from a divorce filing that did not exist. And\nyes, he and Crose continued to meet on Zoom for \u201csexual activity\u201d nearly every\nnight for nine months \u2014 though he\u2019s adamant he never monitored what she ate.\n(Crose shared many texts that indicate he did.) \u201cAm I proud of it? No, but at\nthe same time, again, I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d He claimed he was trying to\nstop her from \u201cabusing\u201d him. \u201cEvery day was just like, I hope today is not the\nday where I\u2019m going to get yelled at.\u201d\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Jenkins, who had sued him, did not know his identity.\nHe said he stayed with Crose in part because he worried that Jenkins would\nruin him if Crose made good on her threats to expose him. It was only after\nthe lawsuit settled, in June, that he resolved to end the relationship. But it\ntook a few more months before he acted. He said the final straw came about a\nweek before Crose and her children were supposed to join him in California,\nwhen Crose yelled at him on the phone for over an hour. The following day, he\ntold a lawyer that Crose had \u201cto be served because this is just spiraling out\nof control.\u201d Over text message that same night, he wrote to Crose: \u201cI can\u2019t\nwait to destroy and fuck the hell out of you the first night you are here.\u201d\n\nIn the park, he seemed astounded that Crose had taken him seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s\njust like, How can she believe that we\u2019re going to be together?\u201d I asked what\nwas going on in his head while he was talking with Crose about her plans to\npull her kids out of school and therapy. He replied that Crose should have\nknown better: \u201cShe didn\u2019t have an address where she was going to move to. She\nhad no clue. Would you take your three kids across the country and not know\nwhere you are going to live?\u201d\n\nThe day after Crose received the stalking order, she and her friend Tiffany\nBusby, a nurse living in New Jersey, released the first episode of a podcast\ncentered on the affair. Busby told listeners that Crose had been in a\nrelationship with someone who was \u201cdiabolical\u201d and, in Busby\u2019s assessment,\n\u201cincredibly famous.\u201d They\u2019d been planning to make a celebrity true-crime\npodcast called Drenched in Drama since the summer Crose first met Enty. All\nthey needed was a subject. Now they had one.\n\nOver more than 100 posts and episodes, Crose and Busby narrated the story of\nCrose\u2019s relationship with Nelson with occasional detours into his history of\nfalse statements about Jenkins and O\u2019Rourke and other related subjects. In\nretrospect, Crose saw Nelson as psychologically and physically abusive. She\ntold her listeners he had groomed her, preying on her desperation for a\npartner and a father to her children before showing himself to be sadistic.\nShe pondered the idea of rape by deception \u2014 when someone lies to obtain sex\n(a rare category of rape that American courts have largely rejected). Crose\nnever consented, she told me, to being used by the man Enty turned out to be.\n\nIn her response to Nelson\u2019s restraining order, Crose asked that the judge also\nbring a restraining order against Nelson, claiming he had threatened her life.\nOn January 11, 2023, he allegedly told her, \u201cI have killed women before and\ncould kill you. I can make you disappear if I want, and I am smart enough to\nget away with it.\u201d (Nelson told me that he\u2019d never murdered anyone and had\nnever said this to Crose.) Nelson, meanwhile, is pursuing a defamation claim\nagainst Crose, along with a second restraining order in federal court \u2014 this\none adds that she had threatened to kill him too. (As evidence, he showed text\nmessages in which she said \u201cfucking die.\u201d) He also argued that some of her\nPatreon posts, which mentioned his minor children, put his kids in danger. The\njudge dismissed the complaint, in part because Nelson failed to follow\nprocedural rules, and warned him against wasting the court\u2019s time. When I\nasked Emily Sack, a professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, to\nreview Nelson\u2019s filings, she described them as frivolous. Then she paused to\nask me a question: \u201cDo we know if he\u2019s actually an attorney? Because let\u2019s\njust say that the documents weren\u2019t particularly well done.\u201d\n\nIn his daily life, Nelson is trying to carry on as if none of this ever\nhappened. He posts at the same clip he has for the past 13 years \u2014 13 small\nitems a day and one big one. He usually records a podcast or two every\nevening. He says he lost 500 or 600 subscribers from his Patreon in the wake\nof Crose\u2019s statements. But most people in his social circle still don\u2019t know\nabout his double life. \u201cIt can feel like the whole world must know about it,\u201d\nNelson said. \u201cBut in reality, it\u2019s a tiny sliver of the population that really\ncares enough, right?\u201d\n\nOn gossip message boards, hundreds of followers of the saga have denounced\nNelson as a liar and a hack who was just as bad as \u2014 \u201cand even worse\u201d than, as\none redditor put it \u2014 the celebrities he wrote about. Crose, or her Patreon\nlisteners, have reached out to a handful of gossip writers and podcasters who\nlinked to Enty\u2019s work or did podcast interviews with him and warned them about\nhim. A few cut ties with him. DeuxMoi, the modern-day queen of the blind item,\nwho drew inspiration from Nelson\u2019s approach, deleted podcast episodes she\u2019d\nrecorded with him. But most ignored Crose\u2019s pleas. After all these years in\nthe shadows, he was growing more popular than ever, and it was no mystery why.\nDespite all that talk of his Me Too heroism, people never went to him because\nhe stood for truth or justice, and that is why they are not abandoning him\nnow.\n\nOn TikTok, a place where falsehoods and conspiracy theories are circulated so\nwidely and indiscriminately that experts warn of its eroding our ability to\ndistinguish truth from fiction, his work has been embraced by a new generation\nof content creators. Watching their videos, you sense that Enty Lawyer, though\nonly modestly successful, was in some ways a man ahead of his time. One rising\nstar of the gossip world, \u201cCelebritea Blinds,\u201d a pretty young woman with\nblonde ombr\u00e9 hair and glossy lips who speaks in a robotic monotone, has built\nher audience of 337,000 followers by simply reading aloud from a website that\npairs Nelson\u2019s blinds with guesses. Recently, she proudly announced that she\nhad received her first cease-and-desist letter. The person who sent it, she\nsaid, \u201chas been accused of being a predator and abusing many people.\u201d She\npaused, then added a caveat reminiscent of the one Nelson posted on his site\nall those years ago. \u201cYou guys know that all of what I read is alleged,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cI don\u2019t claim that any of this is fact.\u201d\n\nThank you for subscribing and supporting our journalism.
