Harvard Growth Lab\u2019s Country\nRankings assess the current state of a country\u2019s productive knowledge, through\nthe Economic Complexity Index (ECI). Countries improve their ECI by increasing\nthe number and complexity of the products they successfully export. Use the\nvisualizations below to (1) determine a country\u2019s ECI ranking, (2) assess a\ncountry\u2019s change in ECI since 1995 and (3) compare a country\u2019s ranking vis-a-\nvis other countries.
