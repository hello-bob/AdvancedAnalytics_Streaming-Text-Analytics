Instead, when he returned to the planning commission months later,\nJha had added an eighth floor.\n\n\u201cHe came back with something that was even worse,\u201d said Brian Jett, who lives\nthree doors down from the proposed development. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJha believed he had the law on his side, and after an hour-and-a-half hearing\nin February, the planning commission agreed. His 33-unit apartment complex was\napproved unanimously, and Jha hopes to break ground within a year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m offended by it,\u201d said Samantha Millman, the planning commission chair.\n\u201cBut I have no choice but to vote for it.\u201d\n\nHousing & Homelessness\n\n### Thousands of apartments may come to Santa Monica, other wealthy cities\nunder little-known law\n\nDevelopers in Santa Monica are planning 4,500 new apartments under a little-\nknown state legal provision \u2014 and the city might not be able to stop them.\n\nOct. 24, 2022\n\nJha is banking his business on moments like these. Jha has spent the last six\nyears paging through state laws and city zoning codes. His homework leads him\nto snap up single-family homes where he decides the law will let him build\nmuch bigger, no matter what anyone else thinks.\n\nJha is taking advantage of an opportune moment when California politics are\nturning away from the slow-growth mantra that has dominated in established\ncities and suburbs over the last half century. In the face of a crushing\nhousing affordability crisis and shortage of available homes, state lawmakers\nhave approved more than 100 new laws in six years that are designed to\nincentivize new housing proposals and force local governments to approve them.\n\nIn Los Angeles, no one is pushing the envelope more than Jha. Besides the\n33-unit Harvard Heights project nestled between the 10 Freeway and Koreatown,\nhe has two proposals in the San Fernando Valley to tear down single-family\nhomes and build dozens of apartments and townhomes on the sites \u2014 all efforts\nthat never before would have stood a chance of getting built.\n\nJha\u2019s plans are kicking up scorn and anger. Millman, the planning\ncommissioner, called the Harvard Heights building a \u201cmiddle finger to the\ncommunity,\u201d a reference both to the developer\u2019s attitude toward his neighbors\nand the visual of an 89-foot-tall structure lording over the one-, two- and\nthree-story buildings nearby. Neighborhood leaders in the Valley worry that\nJha\u2019s projects will bring in criminals or ruin the rustic suburban character\nsustained over decades.\n\nSubscribers get exclusive access to this story\n\nWe\u2019re offering L.A.

The projects are all\nwithin about half a mile of a major freeway with other multifamily housing and\nbusinesses nearby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJha has already won one court case vindicating his interpretation of city\nzoning rules and is prepared to go back for more.\n\n\u201cThere will always be conflict,\u201d Jha said. \u201cBut the law is very clear: Resolve\nthat conflict in the best interest of producing the housing.\u201d\n\nAfter immigrating to the United States in the late 1990s, Jha spent two\ndecades designing rockets and planes while working for aerospace firms. He\nmarried, had a son and, as he entered middle age, decided he wanted something\nnew and turned to real estate.\n\nCalifornia\n\n### A new California housing law has done little to encourage building, report\nsays\n\nA California law passed in 2021 was supposed to make it easier for homeowners\nto build duplexes, but few are taking advantage of it.\n\nJan. 18, 2023\n\nAt first, Jha wanted to buy a small apartment complex. But when he was outbid\nfor a property in San Pedro he thought a better way to make money was to find\na house he could tear down and replace with apartments.\n\nHe had absolutely no construction background.\n\n\u201cNever ever built a tent in my life,\u201d he said.\n\nA native Hindi speaker, Jha armed himself with an English dictionary to help\nwith words he didn\u2019t understand while scouring property listings, laws and\nzoning codes for places to build. He found the crumbling two-story Victorian\nin Harvard Heights in the West Adams district for $840,000.\n\nThe contentious experience galvanized him. He spent a year fighting an effort\nto make the home a historic landmark, which would have blocked its\nredevelopment. After winning, he planned to build a 20-unit apartment complex\nunder a city program that provides incentives for developers near mass\ntransit.\n\nBut after months of work, he learned that rules requiring him to have a\nspecifically sized driveway and room for an electrical transformer didn\u2019t\nleave enough area on the lot to provide sufficiently wide ground-floor\ncommercial space. Jha abandoned his application, but not before he had lost\ntens of thousands of dollars in permitting fees and design costs, he said.\n\nHis plans in a shambles, Jha returned to his research and found a state law\nknown as the \u201cdensity bonus.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\n\n### California has tried to boost its housing stock. See which states have\ndone better\n\nMany of the states that have provided refuges for Californians fleeing high\nhousing prices added much more housing in the last two years than the Golden\nState did.\n\nJune 27, 2023\n\nIn the simplest terms, the law allows developers to build more dense housing\non a lot in exchange for dedicating some of the units for low-income families.\nJha will set aside three of his 33 apartments for that purpose.\n\nBy doing so, Jha gets to bypass all sorts of city zoning and planning rules.\nThe height of the building will be double what\u2019s otherwise allowed, its width\nwill cover nearly the entire lot and Jha only has to provide 20 parking spaces\non the site. Most important for him, the law says that as long as Jha\ntestifies these waivers are necessary, the city\u2019s hands are tied.\n\n\u201cThe city made me go through hearing after hearing after hearing,\u201d Jha said.\n\u201cThen they would sometimes put a hold on my project because they wanted me to\nreduce the height, they wanted me to reduce the density. But I stuck to my\nproject and I stuck to the law.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrengthening the density bonus for developers was one of the key changes\napproved by state legislators in recent years to increase both affordable and\noverall housing production, said Ben Metcalf, managing director of UC\nBerkeley\u2019s Terner Center for Housing Innovation and former director of the\nstate Department of Housing and Community Development.\n\n\u201cYou can basically choose anything you don\u2019t like in the zoning rules and you\nget free passes to throw it out the window,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an\namazing law.\u201d\n\nLike Jha, builders across the state have sought to redesign projects by adding\nlow-income and veterans housing, while reducing parking and yard space so they\ncan get their projects approved even if there\u2019s community outcry, Metcalf\nsaid.\n\n\u201cThe neighbors have no real leverage anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nPolitics\n\n### California lawmakers have tried for 50 years to fix the state\u2019s housing\ncrisis. Here\u2019s why they\u2019ve failed\n\nAfter an hour of debate, Herb Perez had had enough.\n\nJune 29, 2017\n\nJha\u2019s proposals have left community members apoplectic. In Woodland Hills, Jha\nwants to replace a four-bedroom home with an apartment complex of 67 units,\nseven of which, because of the density bonus and related incentive programs,\nwould be reserved for low-income disabled veterans.\n\nMihran Kalaydjian, vice president of the Woodland Hills/Warner Center\nNeighborhood Council, said the development would hurt the area.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re taking single-family homes and replacing them with big apartment\nbuildings, the residents and the tenants of those apartments are coming from\ndifferent backgrounds,\u201d Kalaydjian said. \u201cThe different backgrounds could be\ncriminal backgrounds. It could influence our neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKalaydjian, a landlord himself with seven properties around Woodland Hills,\nsaid the community has planned areas for commercial buildings and apartments.\nDeparting from that blueprint, he said, could reduce property values and\ncontribute to a general sense of disorder.\n\nA four-bedroom home in Woodland Hills that L.A. developer Akhilesh Jha wants\nto replace with an apartment complex.\n\n(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn Sylmar, Los Angeles\u2019 northernmost neighborhood at the foot of the San\nGabriel Mountains, community leaders believe Jha\u2019s plan to build 40 townhomes\non a one-acre site with a single-family home will destroy the area\u2019s bucolic\natmosphere.\n\nThe lot\u2019s zoning requires that there\u2019s enough space for horse stables, and\ntownhomes would prevent horse-owning residents from ever living there, said\nPeter Postlmayr, a member of the neighborhood council.\n\nJha \u201cbought a piece of property and it\u2019s zoned for horsekeeping,\u201d said\nPostlmayr, adding that there\u2019s an extensive trail network the zoning\ndesignation aims to protect. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to change that, which is to the\ndetriment of those living near there.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\n\n### More than 100 vacant, government-owned parcels in L.A. could be used for\nhousing, study finds\n\nAfter years of dawdling by L.A. on the use of public land for homeless\nhousing, an urban planner hired by the Committee for Greater L.A. has vetted\nthousands of government-owned parcels and come up with a list of 121 that it\nsays are ready for development.\n\nJune 15, 2023\n\nJett and other neighbors in Harvard Heights insist that their opposition isn\u2019t\nbecause they\u2019re against housing, rather the specifics of Jha\u2019s project. A\n64-unit, four-story apartment complex for low-income senior citizens opened\ntwo years ago across the street with community support, they said.\n\nJha\u2019s design includes a two-story above-ground parking garage that\u2019s so wide\nexhaust vents sit less than ten feet from the small apartments next door. All\nthe negative effects of the development plus the relatively few low-income\nunits don\u2019t justify its construction, Jett said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re totally cognizant of the housing crisis and all for affordable\nhousing,\u201d said Jett, an independent film director. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t that.\u201d\n\nMetcalf, of UC Berkeley\u2019s Terner Center, said state lawmakers understood\nnearby residents might dislike newer, larger projects when they were debating\nthe bills. But they wanted to ensure that neighbors\u2019 objections would be less\nlikely to trump housing, especially in areas more primed for growth.\n\nHousing & Homelessness\n\nFor Subscribers\n\n### This exclusive island town might be California\u2019s biggest violator of\naffordable housing law\n\nCoronado officials have thumbed their noses at Gov. Gavin Newsom and state\nregulators, calling the process \u201ccentral planning at its worst\u201d and assuring\nresidents that it will be years before the state cracks down.\n\nApril 18, 2023\n\nBesides the senior housing, multiple other apartment complexes line the block\nwhere Jha is proposing to build in Harvard Heights. Abutting the Woodland\nHills development is a three-story commercial structure, and there\u2019s a\nsimilarly sized apartment building two lots down. The Sylmar project sits on a\nbusy street \u2014 albeit one with an equestrian crossing road sign \u2014 less than two\nblocks from the 210 Freeway.\n\n\u201cIn concept, this is what we\u2019re wanting to see happen on these three sites,\u201d\nMetcalf said. \u201cSome of the specifics may be pretty painful to those who live\nnext door.\u201d\n\nJha\u2019s Sylmar proposal relies on the most aggressive interpretation of state\nregulations. Originally, he said, he was considering using a new law that\nallows single-family home owners to split their lots and build small\ndevelopments on both. But then he came across a little-known provision in a\ndifferent set of laws that only apply when the state has not signed off on\ncities\u2019 required growth plans.\n\nThis provision, known as the \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy,\u201d allows developers to\nessentially propose constructing whatever they want \u2014 provided, again, that\nthey set aside some of the future housing for low-income residents. In this\ncase, it wouldn\u2019t matter that the city\u2019s zoning otherwise requires space for\nhorse stables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city of Los Angeles was out of compliance with the state planning law only\nbriefly. Jha slipped in his application last June during the two weeks between\nthe City Council\u2019s final adoption of the blueprint and the state accepting it.\nNo one else has proposed a builder\u2019s remedy project in the city, planning\nofficials said, and, because the state now has approved L.A.\u2019s plan, they\u2019re\nno longer allowed.\n\nAkhilesh Jha at a one-acre lot in L.A. where he hopes to build 40 townhomes.\n\n(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nJha has had some help in his fights. A few years ago, he contacted Sonja\nTrauss, one of the progenitors of the YIMBY, or Yes In My Backyard, movement,\nwho runs a legal advocacy organization that sues cities for rejecting housing\nprojects. She agreed to fund a lawsuit against Los Angeles in Jha\u2019s effort to\nbuild in Woodland Hills.\n\nJha won the case last October, with an L.A. County Superior Court judge\nordering the city to process his application. Ever since that first\nconnection, YIMBY groups have mobilized behind his projects.\n\nWhile Jha has finished smaller developments around the city, the three large\nefforts have yet to receive their final approval. In the meantime, he rents\nout his single-family homes to pay the mortgages.\n\nCalifornia\n\nFor Subscribers\n\n### Celebs dodged millions in L.A.\u2019s \u2018mansion tax.\u2019 Meet the industry guarding\ntheir wealth\n\nThe \u2018wealth defense industry\u2019 \u2014 a network of accountants and consultants\ntasked with helping the rich stay rich \u2014 is responsible for homeowners\navoiding L.A.\u2019s \u2018mansion tax.\u2019\n\nJune 2, 2023\n\nHe advertises the Woodland Hills house, which has a pool, hot tub and four\nholes of mini-golf on the property, for $350 a night on Airbnb.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Harvard Heights, the Victorian has been used for decades as a sober living\nhome. Eleven people live on the property now, said Earl Lee, the 76-year-old\nmanager who has been there since the mid-1990s.\n\nState and city laws require Jha to offer relocation benefits and housing in\nhis new building to the existing tenants. He said he has no intention of\ndisplacing anyone who doesn\u2019t want to go.\n\nBut city officials have questioned Jha\u2019s compliance with those laws and have\ntold him to better inform the tenants of their rights.\n\nLee said eight residents, including him, have expressed interest in coming\nback to the new development. But the paperwork to prove income and other\neligibility requirements to return is burdensome, he said, and some who had\nwanted to stay already left the home.\n\nCalifornia\n\n### More than 100 vacant, government-owned parcels in L.A. could be used for\nhousing, study finds\n\nAfter years of dawdling by L.A. on the use of public land for homeless\nhousing, an urban planner hired by the Committee for Greater L.A. has vetted\nthousands of government-owned parcels and come up with a list of 121 that it\nsays are ready for development.\n\nJune 15, 2023\n\n\u201cYou can fight it if you want but most people just look for a different\nplace,\u201d Lee said.\n\nJha is pressing ahead with all his plans even as roadblocks continue.
