The\nservice was being livestreamed and a recording of it circulated online, along\nwith other videos of the aftermath.\n\neSafety commissioner orders X and Meta to remove violent videos following\nSydney church stabbing\n\nRead more\n\nBut early Saturday morning Australian time, X issued a statement accusing the\nwatchdog of pursuing global censorship and vowing the company will \u201crobustly\nchallenge this unlawful and dangerous approach in court\u201d.\n\nThe statement from X\u2019s global government affairs team, which was reposted by\nthe company\u2019s owner, Elon Musk, said the company complied with the directive\nby the commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, to remove \u201ccertain posts in Australia\nthat publicly commented\u201d on Monday\u2019s attack.\n\n  * Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nBut it did not believe the orders were \u201cwithin the scope of Australian law\u201d\nand it only complied \u201cpending a legal challenge\u201d.\n\nIt said that X then received another \u201cdemand\u201d from the commissioner that it\n\u201cglobally withhold these posts or face a daily fine\u201d of A$785,000.\n\nMusk said in reposting the statement that \u201cThe Australian censorship commissar\n[sic] is demanding *global* content bans!\u201d.\n\n> The Australian censorship commissar is demanding *global* content bans!\n> https://t.co/CRLglUYYIG\n>\n> \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2024\n\nThe commissioner\u2019s office declined to comment on X\u2019s statement.\n\nIt is understood the commissioner made multiple attempts to ensure X had been\nfully compliant with Tuesday\u2019s order after videos and images of the attack\ncontinued to circulate on the platform, despite the company claiming it had\ncomplied.\n\nThe NSW premier, Chris Minns, said he was shocked but not surprised by X\u2019s\nstatement.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly as I would expect from X or Twitter or whatever you would\ncall it: a disregard for the information they pump into our communities, lies\nand rumours spreading like wildfire and then when things go wrong, throwing\ntheir hands up in the air to say they are not prepared to do anything about\nit,\u201d Minns said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe have had enough, Sydney has had enough.\u201d\n\nHe said the platform allowed rumours about the church stabbing to spread\nunencumbered in such a way that it fuelled resulting riots, and called for\nstronger laws governing social media platforms.\n\n\u201cTo think about young police officers who have to go into harm\u2019s way to calm\ndown a riot based on a rumour or innuendo means that their job is virtually\nnext to impossible for them.\n\n\u201cIt is about time we strengthen rules in relation to the eSafety commissioner\nor the federal government or penalties that are in place for social media\ncompanies, we would all be in favour of that.\u201d\n\nMinns said the government had \u201cwrestled\u201d with the idea of leaving the\nplatform, where he, other ministers and multiple departments including NSW\npolice have accounts, but that to do so would mean only \u201cbad actors\u201d remained\non the site.\n\nThe federal health minister, Mark Butler, said Australia was \u201cnot going to be\nbullied by Elon Musk, or any other tech billionaire, in our commitment to\nmaking sure that social media is a safe space\u201d.\n\nHe told reporters in Adelaide that if X wanted to challenge the ban or any\nfines in court then \u201cwe\u2019re up for that fight\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Afternoon Update\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day,\ntelling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

We are considering whether further\nregulatory action is warranted.\n\n\u201ceSafety is disappointed that process has been unnecessarily prolonged, rather\nthan prioritising the safety of Australians and the Australian community.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, X said it respected the right of a country to enforce its\nlaws within its jurisdiction.\n\nHowever, it added, \u201cthe eSafety commissioner does not have the authority to\ndictate what content X\u2019s users can see globally\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will robustly challenge this unlawful and dangerous approach in court.\n\n\u201cGlobal takedown orders go against the very principles of a free and open\ninternet and threaten free speech everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe statement said the \u201crecent attacks in Australia are a horrific assault on\nfree society\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur condolences go out to those who have been affected, and we stand with the\nAustralian people in calling for those responsible to be brought to justice.\n\n\u201cThis was a tragic event and we do not allow people to praise it or call for\nfurther violence.\n\n\u201cThere is a public conversation happening about the event, on X and across\nAustralia, as is often the case when events of major public concern occur.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Australia news\n  * Elon Musk\n  * Social media\n  * Sydney\n  * Meta\n  * X\n  * Internet safety\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
