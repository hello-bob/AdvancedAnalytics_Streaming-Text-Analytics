In this\nway, it becomes interesting to understand better the context of these\nplatforms' so-called web suburbs that consist in those digital places that\n\u226ahost what we can generally call \u201csubcultures,\u201d including fandoms, religious\nsects, political extremists, and subcultures\u226b. Since April 2020, Gab can be\nconsidered the most widespread alternative platform in Western countries, with\ntwenty million users daily, born as Twitter and Facebook alternative social\nmedia. The alternative social media platforms are intended as other connection\nservices between users, which is halfway between a social media and a\ndiscussion forum born to boycott the censorship actions of the main social\nmedia platforms (Meta Group, Twitter, etc.) and celebrate free speech even on\ncontroversial positions. How are sensitive topics, such as the one that\nconcerns the skepticism related to the approvals of vaccines during the\npandemic, addressed on the alternative social media platform compared to how\nthey are dealt with on the mainstream social media platforms? This explorative\nwork wonders about the users' points of view on vaccine concerns and the\nrelevant differences between Gab and Facebook in addressing this topic. The\nempirical part of this work has been set starting from the dataset composed of\nGab and Facebook content posted between March 2020 and July 2021. The posts\nwere extracted with web scraping techniques (for Gab) and proprietary data\ntools (for Facebook), querying the keywords: vaccine, vaccines, anti-vax (no-\nvax), Covid, Covid-19, coronavirus. The collection procedure considered the\ndifferent platforms' structure and their different organization of the\ninteraction spaces. The population consisted of 8000 English writers' posts,\nfrom which 2000 posts with the highest interaction value were extracted. The\ndataset was analyzed using Topic Modeling, Factor, and Classification Analysis\ntechniques. Our work's methodological output deals with comparing these social\nmedia platforms, bearing in mind their ontological objects and their\nalgorithms' role. From the analysis emerged the differences and similarities\nof the social media platforms in terms of the type of content published, rates\nof involvement, sources of information, and directions of the considered\nspeech. These differences have been duly highlighted by three clusters related\nto discourse orientation and communication approach: Conflict of views,\nEmotional externalization, Recommendation and practices. In addition to the\ntype of communication and information circulating on a powerful platform such\nas Gab, the results help us understand the different narratives promoted on\nthe two social media platforms and their role in the possible promotion of the\nsame sentiment, opinions, and ideological polarization.\n\nKeywords: deplatforming, alternative platform, content analysis, COVID and\nvaccines, pandemic reactions\n\nGo to:\n\n## Introduction\n\nDigital cultures play an essential role in radicalization processes and are\nalways considered a relational experience (online or offline), with a\nsignificant impact on consolidating individual and group identity (Antonelli,\n2022).\n\nAccording to Dow et al. (2021), the pandemic has disrupted traditional and\nsocial structures to which we were accustomed. Facing these disruptions,\npeople \u226aturn online to seek alternative cognitive and social structures. Once\nthere, social media radicalizes beliefs and increase contagion (rapid spread)\nand stickiness (resistance to change) of conspiracy theories\u226b (Dow et al.,\n2021, p. 1).\n\nIn this way, increased online presence during the COVID-19 pandemic and the\nlong periods of lockdown have created a particularly fertile ground for\nspreading conspiracy theories, especially of the right-wing (Bessi et al.,\n2015; Antonelli, 2022). The spread of conspiracy theories is a particularly\ncrucial problem today given the impact such beliefs have on individual\nbehavior and, therefore, collective behavior, for instance, the people who\nbelieved the pandemic was all a farce and decided not to adopt the preventive\nbehaviors recommended by the government (Chan et al., 2021). It is even more\nso if we consider the ease with which these theories generate radicalization\nphenomena that can lead to forms of polarization and violent extremism. The\npower of mass media in social and political changes is not new (Thompson,\n2011); the real revolution is the speed at which social media platforms\nrespond to users' social connections and information needs worldwide. In the\nend, the permanence of conspiracy theories and the subsequent radicalization\nprocess is facilitated by the way platforms work based on algorithms that\nfacilitate the circulation of information in line with users' opinions\n(Cinelli et al., 2021). In this way, following Terren and Borge-Bravo (2021)\nand Del Vicario et al. (2017), if a user tends to consume conspiratorial\ncontent on social media, then the platform will tend to offer him more content\nin line with his conspiratorial interest to optimize his user experience.\nConsequently, the platform will indirectly reinforce his opinion and not allow\nhim to come into contact with content that may question his conspiratorial\nopinion.\n\nAscertaining this background, this work aims to investigate how content\nrelating to the Covid-19 pandemic and the vaccination campaign are\ncommunicated on alternative social media platforms, precisely because of their\ndifferent regulation than traditional platforms. These are used to host\ncontent and content creators that traditional social media platforms may not\ntolerate.\n\nAt the same time, many studies have discussed the role of traditional social\nmedia in disseminating alternative information related to COVID-19 and\nvaccines (Chan et al., 2020; Gesser-Edelsburg, 2021). On the one hand, it is\npossible to hypothesize that alternative social media platforms can become\nattractive to conspiracy theorists and other users marked by radical positions\nalready banned by traditional social media platforms; on the other hand, they\nare also frequented by users who have intentionally migrated from other\ndigital spaces not attended by institutional actors and where content\nregulation policies are not (or differently) addressed (Innes and Innes,\n2021).\n\nThe purpose of this work is not oriented to understanding which conditions\npush banned users from migrating to alternative social media platforms.\nInstead, it is to shed light, by a first comparison exploration, on the many\nways to approach such a relevant topic surfing different regulated digital\nspaces. Gab and Facebook are two social media platforms offering different\ninteraction modes and functionality (Cinelli et al., 2020a). The first one has\nbeen chosen for this case-comparison study because it can be considered the\nmost widespread alternative social media platform in Western countries with\ntwenty million users a day (Longo, 2021) born as Twitter and Facebook\nalternative social media (Nieborg and Poell, 2018). The alternative social\nplatforms are intended as other connection services between users, which is\nhalfway between a social media and a discussion forum born to boycott the\ncensorship actions of the main social media platforms (Meta Group, Twitter,\netc.) and celebrate free speech (Zannettou et al., 2018).\n\nAlthough Gab and similar social media platforms may have been created and\npopulated by users with explicitly political aims and discourses, their\nconsolidation and growing popularity have inevitably led to other non-\npolitical topics being discussed online (Dehghan and Nagappa, 2022). In\nparticular, the vaccine topic (Broniatowski et al., 2021). Facebook, on the\nother hand, can be considered the most established and popular social network\nsite that enables relationships and discourse patterns between digital\npublics. Such patterns are intended as social formations made of temporary\nassociations and cooperations among strangers with mutual agendas which\ndisappear after a few hours of intense shared experience (Arvidsson and\nCaliandro, 2016). Our goal is to explore the narratives on them. In light of\nthis, the research questions that motivate the exploration of the present work\nare:\n\n  * RQ1: What narratives are being built around the themes of COVID and vaccination campaigns on Facebook and Gab?\n\n  * RQ2: Considering the different functioning of the alternative social media platform, do users radicalize about vaccines and COVID issues?\n\nGo to:\n\n## From alternative to extreme social media platforms\n\nSocial media represents an essential space for individual self-expression and\ncollective association; however, users often transform the freedom these\nsocial media platforms offer to promote hate speech, disinformation, and\nconspiracy theories. To improve the safety of their users, social media\nplatforms enforce their terms of service by performing strict moderation that\nincludes removing certain contents or suspending particular users.\n\nThese actions have in turn led to the emergence of a substantial \u201calternative\necosystem\u201d (Rogers, 2020), i.e., a set of discussion platforms (microblogging,\nsocial media, and messaging services) of less regulation and moderation that\nare used to host content and content creators that are not tolerated by\ntraditional social media platforms (like Twitter and Meta group). What is\n\u201calternative social media\u201d? How can we distinguish it from \u201ctraditional\u201d\nsocial media? To answer these questions, Gehl (2015) conceptualizes\nalternative social media platforms using the classic alternative media theory\nthat arose before the dominance of social media giants such as Facebook and\nTwitter. Alternative media were born as a response to older mass media and to\ncounter its large corporate power to promote communication and the\nconstruction of public opinion along democratic lines.\n\nThis definition makes it difficult to consider \u201ctraditional\u201d social media as\nan alternative to mainstream media. On the one hand, the dominant social media\n\u2013 Facebook and Twitter \u2013 may be seen as a first response to the public's\ndemand for broader participation in the production and distribution of\ncontent. On the other hand, however, it cannot be denied that these platforms\nhave maintained or even intensified some of the characteristics of mainstream\nmass media power described by earlier alternative media theorists, such as\ncentralized and controlled communication (Gehl, 2015).\n\nIndeed, traditional social media, being proprietary profit-seeking companies,\ncan become hostile to ideas, discourses, and organizations, especially when in\nconflict with corporate hegemony, while allowing people to be content\nproducers. So, as Gehl (2015) claims, alternative social media can be seen as\na critical response to traditional social media that allows users to share\ncontent and connect and have more access to shape the underlying technical\ninfrastructure and radically experiment with surveillance regimes.\n\nIndeed, these social media platforms promote themselves as alternative\nsolutions for those who want a different social media experience or are\ndissatisfied with the content moderation of major social media platforms. Over\ntime, this business logic has supplanted the idealism of a free and\nparticipatory space that was promoted when the first social media was born,\njust as censorship and the algorithmic manipulation of messages have replaced\nunlimited social flows (Poell, 2014).\n\nThe result of all this has been the birth of alternative social media\nplatforms that try to recover the founding principles of the first social\nmedia. This demonstrates what Waltz (2005) and Atton (2002) argue: there will\nalways be alternative media alongside traditional media. Therefore, dissenting\nopinions and practices will always find new spaces of expression in opposition\nto the hegemonic ones.\n\nWhile on the one hand, alternative social networks were created to offer\ndecentralized and accessible methods of content production that challenge the\npower of proprietary companies, on the other hand, this free content\nproduction can take on dangerous characteristics. The infodemic (Rothkopf,\n2003) understood as facts, mixed with fear, speculation, and rumor, amplified\nand relayed swiftly worldwide by modern information technologies has\ncontributed to the out-of-control spread of conspiracy theories and\ndisinformation.\n\nRecently, the infodemic effect has been made acute by the COVID-19 pandemic in\nthe way people were exposed to large quantities of both accurate and\nmisleading information related to a health topic (Buchanan, 2020; Eysenbach,\n2020), trying to \u2018know what or whom to trust, especially when faced with\nconflicting claims or information' (Gruzd et al., 2021, p. 2).\n\nTo address the issue and respond to growing public and regulatory pressure,\ntraditional social media platforms banned all conspiracy theory-related\ncontent, with influential conspiracy theory personalities and controversial\nentities and groups restricted or prevented from spreading extreme narratives\n(Mahl et al., 2021).\n\nIn this way, traditional social media platforms increased their role as\ncontent moderators and expelled users or groups that promoted controversial\ncontent from their services. Rather than limiting the circulation of this type\nof viewpoint, however, these actions have led to the emergence of alternative\nsocial media platforms that soon became a comfortable refuge for conspiracy\ntheorists and other users with radical positions, obscured by traditional\nsocial media platforms which were not seen as a suitable communication space\nto express their positions. In addition to defining them as \u201calternative\u201d\nsocial media platforms, we could also define these discussion spaces as\n\u201cextreme\u201d social media platforms, understood as those platforms on which users\nwith extreme positions deplatformed by traditional social media platforms\ngather to share their radical ideas freely.\n\nThe emergence of these hyper-radicalized communication spaces motivated the\ngenesis of our work. It is possible to argue that extreme social media\nplatforms share communication practices with traditional social media\nplatforms (the users can create, share, and interact with content in different\nways), the essential differences being the organization of the interaction\nspaces and the criteria for selection of content on the platforms (Cinelli et\nal., 2020a). Following Zeng and Sch\u00e4fer (2021) in highlighting the\ncharacteristics that differentiate extreme social media platforms from\ntraditional ones, we adopt the theoretical framework proposed by Nieborg and\nPoell (2018) which includes governance, users, and technological\ninfrastructure.\n\nIn regard to governance, these social media platforms celebrate the liberation\nof content: they have gained popularity by promoting their image as defenders\nof freedom of information, often resulting in conspiracy theories, racist hate\nspeech, and toxic information being promoted (Thibault, 2016). These\nalternative social media platforms thus host personalities with radicalized\nand controversial positions who no longer find freedom of discussion on\ntraditional social media platforms that moderate content. The lack of\nacceptance by society (or in this case by the digital space) is an additional\nemergent item of the radicalization process (Antonelli, 2022).\n\nThis perception leads users to seek refuge, acceptance, and understanding\nwithin digitally created ad hoc spaces dominated by extremist, simplistic\nnarratives based on the exaltation of violent positions.\n\nRegarding the technological infrastructure and the functioning of alternative\nextreme social media platforms like Gab, no apps are synchronized because they\nare banned from all app stores. It differs from social media platforms like\nFacebook, which depend heavily on the news feed algorithm (Acampa, 2022). In\nthis way, on an alternative extreme social media platform such as Gab, content\nproducers can communicate with, and receive suggestions, directly from their\nmost loyal followers who support their positions.\n\nThis migration can be considered as the full realization of a selective\ninformation space: in this case, the user gets out of the echo chambers of\ntraditional social media and immerse himself in a real \u201cecho platform\u201d, i.e.,\nplatforms in which the contents produced and shared are exclusively in line\nwith the beliefs of the users who live in it.\n\nWhile many studies have questioned the role of traditional social media in\ndisseminating \u201calternative information\u201d (Cinelli et al., 2020b; Jhaver et al.,\n2021), these alternative social media platforms remain little investigated in\nsocial media studies. For this reason, it is interesting to understand how\nthese social media platforms operate in the new peripheries of the web\n(Thibault, 2016) and form a part of a broader communication ecology.\n\nGo to:\n\n## The role of social media in the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe use of the web and social media during the first phase of the pandemic\nsignificantly increased, allowing users to stay connected with friends,\nrelatives, or colleagues, disseminate protocols on care and personal\nprotective equipment, and retrieve real-time information about what was\nhappening at that moment. Social media played an essential role in creating a\nsense of community and solidarity during lockdowns and restrictions imposed by\nthe pandemic. Social media users shared individual experiences and stories of\ndaily life, creating a sense of belonging and closeness among people facing\nsimilar problems (Wong et al., 2021).\n\nAccording to data produced by \u201cWe Are Social\u201d in January 2022, out of a global\npopulation of 7.91 billion people, there are ~5.31 billion mobile users (67%),\n4.95 billion users connected to the Internet (62%), and 4.62 billion active\npeople (which generally means a person who has connected at least once a\nmonth) on at least one social media (58%). These numbers describe a digital\ntransformation underway for almost two decades globally as Internet and social\nmedia penetration rates have constantly increased. The growth of users of\nsocial media platforms has more than tripled in the last 10 years, from 1.48\nbillion in 2012 to 4.62 billion in January 2022, which is an annual average\ngrowth of 12%.\n\nSince the unexpected beginning and first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, global\nterms such as social distancing, gathering, smart working, and lockdown have\nassumed importance. Social media platforms have proved to be potent tools as\nthey have allowed all users, especially the most followed, to spread the rules\nto limit the spread of the virus as much as possible.\n\nAmong the most characteristic functions of social media platforms during this\npandemic have been the rapid dissemination of protocols at regional, national,\nand international levels. Sharing protocols about treatment, personal\nprotection equipment, or even proposals for fair allocation of scarce\nresources in medical settings have now become the new standard (Gonz\u00e1lez-\nPadilla and Tortolero-Blanco, 2020).\n\nThey played an essential role in communication during the pandemic, providing\na channel through which people could stay in touch and exchange information\nabout the spread of the virus, prevention measures, and safety recommendations\n(Wong et al., 2021).\n\nHowever, as the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines ramped up, false\nand misleading information about vaccines' efficacy, safety, and side effects\nincreased on social media (Gruzd et al., 2021).\n\nOn the other side, subjective opinions, prejudices, and conspiracies have been\nintertwined with these reports, generating an enormous proliferation of false\nnews and misinformation in general. This has also occurred because of the\nspeed with which the news circulated, also among the main newspapers.\n\nOf course, when we think about social media platforms, one cannot ignore what\nPariser (2011) called \u201cbubble filters\u201d, according to which users live in a\n\u201ccustom ecosystem\u201d governed by algorithms that choose and predict preferences\nand results according to their own biases. These bubbles produce a cycle of\ncomparable content that prevents the user from seeing other sources to counter\nthe information and, therefore, any fake content. The use of \u201csocial media\nplatforms was perceived as easy and accessible to everyone for sharing,\nposting, and reacting to any information \u2013 also medical information \u2013\nregarding the pandemic. While people continued to work from home and ensured\nsocial distancing, most users supported family and friends and attempted to\nraise awareness by sharing and circulating a range of information within their\nclosed social networks (Saud et al., 2020).\n\nHowever, misperceptions negatively influenced the perceived severity,\nsusceptibility, and efficacy of government preventive measures, which may have\nultimately resulted in decreased compliance (Meppelink et al., 2022).\n\nDuring the pandemic, social networks were the place for four types of users to\nmeet and clash: pros, cons, neutrals, and those hesitant about the scientific\naspects of the vaccination campaign. In this case, social media platforms,\nparticularly those with large user bases, were most culpable of spreading\nvaccine-related misinformation that may have contributed to vaccine hesitancy\n(Gruzd et al., 2021). Several times in this way, social media contents are\nfeatured by verbal aggressions that can be framed as \u201ca personality trait that\npredisposes persons to attack the self-concepts of other people instead of, or\nin addition to, their positions on topics of communication\u201d (Infante and\nWigley, 1986: 61).\n\nMany studies described how social media, despite their efforts to remove\nCOVID-19 vaccine\u2013related misinformation, have featured as vectors for\nvaccination hesitation in many countries worldwide (Lou and Ahmed, 2019;\nBurki, 2020; Gruzd et al., 2023). In this way, hesitant reactions were driven\nby many different reasons related to any other effects of misinformation as in\nthe AstraZeneca case in Italy (Crescentini and Padricelli, 2023), through\nfalse crossclaims about the vaccine efficiency \u2018not constrained within a\nsingle platform' (Gruzd et al., 2023). Considering this, public communication\npolicies provided fast resilience policies oriented to monitoring and\nrestraining the impact of misinformation, taking care that as in the U.K.\ncase, 'government-generated messages may be less effective than those of other\nactors' (Bloomfield et al., 2021)\n\nAccording to this, social media platforms have had the role of disseminating\nnot only scientific and technological content but also the opinions of\nscientific experts even though they are not widely used. The importance of\nscientific communication \u2013 understood not as \u201cpopularization\u201d, that is,\nbringing people closer to knowledge but as a means to transmit and spread\nmessages \u2013 is constantly neglected and denied by scientists. However, there\nare many exceptions in the national and international scene. In this way,\nscientific experts struggled to maintain their previously unchallenged\nauthority due to differing opinions and inefficient communication. At the same\ntime, the web broke the sequential order and tightness of a series of\n'filters' that previously distinguished the pathway of scientific results from\nthe researcher to the general public (Bucchi, 2006, p. 72).\n\nGo to:\n\n## Alternative social media platforms and alternative narrations?\n\nTo answer the research questions mentioned in the introduction section, this\nwork, from a comparative perspective, will explore the narratives of two\nexamples of these respective types of social media platforms, Facebook and\nGab, as they offer different modes of interaction and the ability to amplify\ncontent. It will also reflect on the ontological aspects of the social media\nplatforms themselves, such as the role of algorithms in the dissemination of\ncontent and the polarization of public opinion. The data were collected\nthrough a query strategy and then the database was subjected to a content\nanalysis. To better answer these questions, an in-depth comparison was made of\ncontent posted by users on Gab and Facebook between March 2020 and July 2021.\nThe data collection procedure involved gathering content posted by users on\nboth social media platforms in the selected timespan through a query that\ncontained the following keys: vaccine, vaccines, anti-vax, COVID, COVID-19,\ncoronavirus. Web scraping procedures were used for Gab's extraction while for\nFacebook, we availed ourselves of Crowdtangle, an insight tool reserved for\nthe academic community that only tracks publicly available posts on Meta's\ngroup social media platforms.\n\nTo achieve the objectives of this research, it is necessary to equip oneself\nwith the tools and techniques useful for extracting meaning from the available\ninformation. This is the case with content analysis, a technique aimed at\nbreaking down any type of message into \u201csimpler constituent elements, the\nrecurrence of which can be calculated, also in view of further processing,\npossibly after classification in appropriate systems of categories\u201d (Amaturo\nand Punziano, 2013, p. 24).\n\nIn this specific application case, which follows a content analysis of the\nthird type (Rositi, 1988),^1 the empirical basis was created by preparing a\nstandardized grid for data collection (Table 1). Through this grid, the\ncollection of all cultural products containing the selected keywords during\nthe identified observation period was organized.\n\n### Table 1\n\nContent analysis standard grid.\n\nSocial media platform| Total reactions| External sources| Post type| Message  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nFacebook - Gab| Low \u2013 Medium \u2013 High levels| Academic journal \u2013 Academic press\n\u2013 Amazon \u2013 Blogs \u2013 Cloud \u2013 Documents \u2013 Institutional \u2013 Petition \u2013 Scientific\nreports \u2013 Telegram \u2013 Twitter \u2013 Video Platform - Youtube| Link \u2013 Live video\ncomplete \u2013 Meme \u2013 Native video \u2013 Photo \u2013 Post \u2013 Screen \u2013 Status - Video| Post\ntext  \n  \nOpen in a separate window\n\nThanks to the guidance provided by the grid, in addition to the identifying\nvariable of the social media platform on which the collected content was\nposted, the variable regarding the total reactions to the posts made by users\nwas operationalized. The latter consists of the sum of the number of likes,\ncomments, and content shares. This cardinal variable was subsequently\ndiscretized into an ordered-categorical variable, which follows a specific\nordering as an ordered series along a continuum characterized by a precise\nrange. This transformation operation was conducted by identifying the central\nvalue along the frequency distribution of the entire variable and then\ndividing it into tertials, where each interval had an equal number of observed\ncases. Subsequently, the variable was reclassified into low-medium and high\nreactivity levels, respecting a monotonic relationship between the intervals\n(Marradi, 2007).\n\nThe empirical base initially composed of 8000 observations was reduced to a\ndataset of 2000 posts, selecting an equal number of cases retrieved from the\ntwo social media platforms. The selection of the first 1000 posts from Gab and\nthe first 1000 posts on Facebook was based on replies to rates (we selected\n333 low-rate, 333 medium-rate, and 334 high-rate posts from each platform).\n\nFurthermore, variables related to the type of published post and the nature of\nany external sources contained within the published material were\noperationalized.\n\nThe first variable consists of identifying the communicative codes\ncharacterizing each case observed, whether they are textual (post and status),\naudio-visual (live video complete, native video, photo, screen, meme, and\nVideo), or contain hyperlinks to external social media platforms (Link).\n\nThe origin of these external sources is operationalized in the second\nvariable, which distinguishes those contents not belonging to Gab or Facebook.\nAmong these, there are academic-scientific sources (academic journals,\nacademic press, and scientific reports), commercial sources (Amazon), blogs,\ndocument archives (cloud and documents), institutional press releases,\nfundraising campaigns, petitions, and other social media platforms or instant\nmessaging platforms (YouTube, Twitter, Telegram, and Video platform).\n\nAll the collected data were processed with a multi-stage content analysis that\nconsisted of three separate analytical phases: the application of the main\nseven topics of topic modeling^2 from our dataset in order to understand the\nnarrative features created by users among Gab and Facebook; the application of\na Lexical Correspondence Analysis (LCA)^3 to detect the latent mining\ndimension detectable from the combination of the emerging topics with the\nproper functions of both social media platforms; and a cluster analysis^4 that\nsynthesizes all of the information used in few and homogeneous groups.\n\nGo to:\n\n## The topic model and LCA\n\nAfter building the dataset, the first analytical procedure was used to\nidentify, via the considerable amount of information in the textual variables,\nthe narrative features related to and emerging from the material collected.\nDespite the difficulty in tracing the semantic structure of the texts, topic\nmodeling offered an empirical basis for a simple, automated, and statistically\nrobust solution. This technique identified topics within the analyzed works\nthat were explored through the textual variable. As the first step, the\ndatabase was imported into T-Lab, a specific quantitative content analysis\nsoftware that processed patterns based on textual context. Later, the textual\nvariable was submitted for the thematic analysis procedure of T-Lab. Prior to\nthe preparation of the text for automatic analysis, lemmatization,\nlexicalization, and segmentation procedures were followed and finally, the\nfrequency threshold was set at 10 occurrences. In this way, a final database\ncomprising ~969 total words was obtained.\n\nAfter this corpus building, a model was set up through which seven topics were\nextracted and appropriately renamed to respect statistical criteria as\nfollows: the consideration of specific word occurrences featuring the topic;\nlow-high shared word occurrences among all topics; and semantic tagging of\nselected contexts in order to \u201cdetect the right document meaning in order to\nsolve disambiguation and identifying concepts by a set of words.\u201d (Bolasco,\n2013, p. 126). Since each of the texts analyzed comprised a document composed\nof words, this text could be subdivided into elementary contexts, i.e.,\nsmaller portions of text such as sentences, in which the specific combination\nof words was more or less likely to lead back to a specific topic. The topic\nwould then be the set of specific words belonging only to that topic plus\nseveral other words shared with greater or less probability with other topics.\nThe combination of these sets of specific and shared words leads to different\nsemantic universes. This allows the topic to be correctly labeled considering\nthe specific words, shared words, and elementary context l within the topic,\nwhich helps contextualize the words in specific portions and deduce a general\nmeaning of the topic.\n\nFinally, as summarized in Table 2, the seven topics were classified, taking\naccount of the 3,450 emerging elementary contexts that comprise the total\ncorpus of documents analyzed. Following Habert (2005), the greater\nsignificance of parts of the documents depends on the information weight of\nits elementary contexts, featured by its discursive formulas, their position\nin the document, and the specific weight of each word related to its\ndistribution in the document. In this study, T-Lab returned the following\nsummary of elementary contexts with a hierarchical order based on the\ninformative score of single elementary contexts in which text reduction has\nbeen synthesized by a 95% threshold.\n\n### Table 2\n\nTopic name, featuring words, and examples of elementary context.\n\nTopic name| Featuring words| Examples of elementary context  \n---|---|---  \nBusiness Spamming| business; need; support; help; service; learn; work; job;\nmoney; time| \u22125 Days To Go!

Two weeks ago VAERS reported 6,985 deaths due to the COVID\nvaccines.  \n  \nOpen in a separate window\n\nLexical Correspondence Analysis (LCA) was then implemented to answer RQ1 to\nencapsulate the narration on both social media platforms, Gab and Facebook,\nand underline the main differences between them in framing and discourse-\nbuilding about the COVID vaccine issues during the pandemic period. After\nthis, a cluster analysis was implemented to retrieve three uniform groups\nrepresenting the major communication patterns users utilize. Figures 1, ,22\nshow the main results.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 1\n\nLexical correspondence analysis.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 2\n\nCluster analysis.\n\nBefore discussing the results of the analysis, it is necessary to describe how\nthe LCA (Lexical correspondence Analysis) plan is constructed and how emerged\nthe main latent dimensions thanks to the multidimensional approach we used to\nprocess and analyze textual material. The first one, on the horizontal axis,\nis concerned with the primary communication approach to Covid and vaccine\nissues. It synthesizes the reactions to the pandemic situation during the\nfirst period of the pandemic. Facebook and its related behavioral approaches\nare to the left of the axis. Here, we emphasized and concentrated on the\nprecautionary ways of self-protection from contagion, such as staying at home\nand avoiding interactions. Contrariwise, the right of the axis where Gab is\npositioned focuses on the meditative and wise approaches open to the debate\namong users and their reactions to the pandemic issue over the longer term.\nHere, it is possible to detect those posts linked to the discussions on the\ncontrol measures, COVID victims, and vaccine reliability.\n\nAlong the dimension shown on the vertical axis, higher and lower values relate\nto discourse orientation characterized by individual and collective\nexperiences, respectively.\n\nOn these bases, the narration on both social media platforms is concerned with\nfour discussion frames that emerge across these dimensions. The first frame,\nwhich emerges in the plan's first quadrant, is characterized by a sensible\napproach to the pandemic issue. This is oriented on the micro level and by the\ndirect individual perspective of users. The topic related to the quarantine\ndiaries here gathered all those elements related to the individual narration\nof daily life during the pandemic. This narration practice makes sharing the\nexperiences held during the lockdown possible. It is also supported by the\ncontents related to the contagion updates and the first treatment developed to\nfight the virus. In this way, a narrative reflecting conventional or popular\nwisdom is more concentrated than the more scientific-oriented ones focused on\nin the fourth quadrant, considering the modality of scientific sources\n(Academical Journals, Academic Press, and Scientific Reports) from the\nvariable of external sources addressed.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to the support of the most frequent words, such as Pfizer,\nmRNA, spike protein, release, and Covid vaccine, this quadrant concentrates on\nall those contents that deal with more detailed information concerning the\npandemic in general and the vaccine issue. In this way, a narration is\nfeatured by commenting and reviewing discussions of the scientific sources\naddressed by users. Among the latter, scientific papers have also been\nincluded in the preparation of the data-gathering procedures during the\noperativization phase.\n\nThe second quadrant takes shape as the more speculative one. Here, we find a\nrelative need for more discussion among users. There is instead more space\nreserved for storytelling practices that distinctly emphasize the potential\nfears the socio-economic insecurity can cause because of the lockdown\nisolation, a fertile ground for questionable business practices. Lastly, in\nthe third quadrant, which crosses the impact reaction and the collective\nsphere, it is possible to find the narrative refrain of \u201cstay at home\u201d and the\nother behavioral practices that individuals adopted during the first pandemic\nphase. In summary, looking at the graph, the narration of Gab is featured in\nusers' confrontations and debates on a critical approach to the pandemic.\n\nMoreover, despite the primary identifications of users present on Gab, who are\ndefined as radicalized by scholars (Lima et al., 2018), no rude communication\nstyles emerge from the empirical evidence in this case. At the same time, the\nLCA reveals a proactive debate based on scientific sources if a \u226apolarized\nperspective of user opinions, bubbles, or any other elements linked to the\nreinforcement of their political or social views\u226b (ivi) is not detectable.\nMoreover, despite what was initially expected from Gab, no opportunistic\npractices or phishing post-trends are disseminated by the self-regulated\nusers, unlike what emerges when looking at the part of the graph in which\nFacebook narration is framed. On the one hand, the interpretative schema built\non the popular social media platform appears shaped for a digital space to\nreport \u201cwhat's going on\u201d, in other words, to comprehend the contagion trends\nand to be informed about the pandemic issue. On the other hand, the debate\nabout the situation related to the vaccination campaign goes into the\nbackground. It allows space for spamming and speculating content with no\nlinked external sources that are not violating the strict company regulation.\n\nThe results of the later analytical procedure align with this vision. Later in\nthe LCA, a further cluster analysis is provided. Finally, the synthesis\noperation is carried out on the plane constituted by the intersection of the\ntwo syntheses. In this way, it is also possible to characterize the narrative\ndifferences between Gab and Facebook thanks to the contributions provided to\nthe topics surveyed, the social media platform's positions on the plane, and\nthe position of three emerging groups.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the first group, which contains most of the information\nof the dataset (65%), gathers the social narration that was held on Facebook\nand was related to the collective sphere. Here, there are concentrated words\nand posts that reflect the recommendation and practices to be followed during\nthe lockdown, which was experienced as the \u201cstay at home\u201d wave and the need to\nrespect social distancing. As shown by the most frequent words inside this\ncluster, these recommendations gained more frequency and relevance than\ncontents related to the topic of home business speculation in the cluster. The\nadvice on approaching new forms of sociality, such as going outside only for\nemergency purposes, wearing masks, and promoting social distancing, occurred\nbecause of the pandemic. These recommendation practices have been replaced by\nthose contents that concern and promote remote working practices from home\nthat, as promised by the users, drive easy online economic earnings, such as\nonline investments, buying and selling products, etc. In an opposed position,\nGab takes precedence in the second cluster, comprising 25% of the information\ncontained in the dataset, which relates to the collective sphere. In this\ncase, elements concerning risk perception and discussion concerning vaccine\neffectiveness gain more space. Users' knowledge construction opened to the\nconflict of views between them and any other actor related to the Government\nor conspiracy engagements. As shown in Table 2, the elementary context and the\nmore frequent words underline these conflictual oppositions: \u201cVaccinated\npeople are now believed to be super-spreaders who can shed through their skin,\npores, and breath to those not yet vaccinated, resulting in those people being\ninfected as well\u201d. In this last group is found content more frequently posted\non Gab than on Facebook, constituting 10% of the full information. Here,\ncontent relates to the emotional externalization of the individual experiences\nduring the pandemic. These are related to those social constructions that\nfeature positive and negative experiences. They depend on the learning\nprocesses and the social mechanism connected to a new experience as the\npandemic. Despite the lack of proper methods and instruments to detect and\ncomprehend these elements, other investigative perspectives must support the\nstudy of emotions. In this case, the application of traditional techniques\nrelated to the qualitative approach can be helpful in two ways: to shed light\non the traces already left reported by the quarantine diaries and then to\nidentify interesting research paths to go in-depth into a specific emotion or\nsensation that can be later translated by individuals in a specific attitude,\nsocial construction, or action.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Conclusion and future work\n\nThe content analysis highlighted the differences and similarities of the\nsocial media platforms in terms of the type of content published, rates of\ninvolvement, sources of information, and directions of the considered speech.\nThe results helped to answer RQ1 and provided insight into the different\nnarratives promoted on the two social media platforms. In fact, to the issue\ninvestigated and in contrast to what was hypothesized about the Gab social\nmedia platform, a particularly radical, sectarian, or conspiratorial\nenvironment did not emerge. The empirical exploration to compare Gab and\nFacebook underlines that Gab is a narration more oriented to structures,\nreactions, debating, and emotional assumptions, while with respect to\nFacebook, a more impactful orientation. Referring to RQ2, while Facebook\nfunctioned as the platform where users spread best practices to deal with the\npandemic, Gab on the other hand emerged as a platform characterized by\ndifferent narratives opposing the mainstream narratives, which includes users\nwho address, on one hand, critical and sensitive issues related to the\nemergency, and on the other hand conflictual and critical public\nargumentations. In the case of this study, the alternative ecosystem that was\nborn from an attempt to find spaces of expression not subject to regulation\nand censorship did not generate an information environment based on all the\nsame information and positions. On Gab, different positions and consumption of\ndifferent information sources were detected; this information source was\ncurated collaboratively and used to formulate or reframe explanations about\nthe pandemic and the vaccine campaign. This explains that extremism, in all\nits forms, is a cumulative and incremental phenomenon or a process that arises\nor amplifies as a reaction to exposure or prolonged contact with an\nideologically different type (Antonelli, 2022).\n\nThe major focus of studies on social media platforms like Gab has limited\nitself to either explicitly political topics or certain problematic discourses\nand content such as hate speech, misinformation, and conspiracy theories\n(Dehghan and Nagappa, 2022), but our analysis shows the emergence of Gab as a\nspace for comparison and sharing of information sources and differing\nworldviews that is lacking on Facebook. Gab claims to promote freedom of\nspeech and provide an environment where users can express their opinions\nwithout fear of being censored or banned. Relating to RQ2, as LCA outcomes\nshow, the themes investigated a user who expresses a position against the tide\non Facebook that most likely triggers a real \u201cshitstorm\u201d against him,\ngenerating a polarization of positions that in a short time turns into hate\nspeech, thus preventing a meaningful contest between different opinions. On\nthe contrary, on Gab, the idea of being able to express a position (albeit\ncontroversial and not widely shared by public opinion) with a users' audience,\nwho probably share that same position and are more prone to confrontation than\nto attack, generates a discussion environment that is less polarized and more\nopen to the exchange of opinions. The lack of radicalization of communication\nmay be associated with the sharing of opinions regarding particular themes and\nthe non-existence of users who can counter them. A limitation of the work is\nundoubtedly linked to the themes investigated in a particular and singular\nhistorical moment for the entire world; different results could emerge if\ninvestigating incredibly divisive themes traditionally used to support\nconspiratorial propaganda. An expansion of the work could be done from a\ncomparative perspective between social media platforms and relevant themes in\neach historical moment.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available\nby the authors, without undue reservation.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Ethics statement\n\nEthical approval was not required for the study involving human data in\naccordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.

In the third type, there is no decomposition into\nelements, but the classification unit coincides with the contextual unit. In\npractice, it is as if the examined communication were subjected to a real\nquestionnaire, \u201casking\u201d an advertising message, for example, if a female\ncharacter appears, what role she plays, and so on\u226b (Amaturo and Punziano,\n2013, p. 55\u201356).\n\n^2A model applied to topic extraction was based on the Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation, a \u201cgenerative probabilistic model for text document collections\nbased on a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a\ncollection is modelled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics.\nEach topic is, in turn, modelled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set\nof topic probabilities. In the context of text modelling, the topic\nprobabilities provide an explicit representation of a document\u201d (Blei et al.,\n2003).\n\n^3Lexical Correspondence Analysis is a factorial technique concerning textual\ndata and is useful to synthesize information contained in texts, make graphic\ndisplays of association networks among words and between words and texts, and\nshow the connections between text and context data (Lebart et al., 1998).\n\n^4Cluster analysis is an analytical technique that aims to synthesize observed\nobjects into a few representative groups (Lebart, 1994).\n\nGo to:\n\n## Conflict of interest\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any\ncommercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential\nconflict of interest.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Publisher's note\n\nAll claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do\nnot necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of\nthe publisher, the editors and the reviewers.
