Tensions flared again in late 2021 when the rebel\nMarch 23 Movement (M23) began recapturing swathes of territory.\n\nThe DRC, the UN and Western countries accuse Rwanda of supporting rebel\ngroups, including M23, in a bid to control the region's vast mineral\nresources, an allegation Kigali denies.\n\n\"The world's eyes are wide shut: Rwanda's production of key 3T minerals is\nnear zero, and yet big tech companies say their minerals are sourced in\nRwanda,\" Amsterdam & Partners said in a statement.\n\nTheir cease-and-desist letter claims that minerals going to Apple are sourced\nfrom sites where sexual violence, armed attacks and widespread corruption take\nplace.\n\nMacs, iPhones, and other Apple products are \"tainted by the blood of the\nCongolese people\", the DRC's lawyers said.\n\n(with newswires)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning\n\nSubscribe\n\nKeep up to date with international news by downloading the RFI app\n\nShare :\n\nRead more on related topics:\n\n  * DRC\n  * Apple\n  * Rwanda\n  * Minerals\n  * Mining\n\nRelated content\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO\n\n## Who are the armed groups ravaging the eastern DRCongo?\n\nDR Congo - China\n\n## Long road for DRC as it renegotiates minerals deal with China\n\nAfrican news explained\n\n## Is the US conflict minerals campaign a force for change?\n\nOn the same topic\n\nSouth African elections\n\n## Surprise comeback of South Africa's ex-president Jacob Zuma could challenge\nANC\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo - France\n\n## Tshisekedi visit to France likely to focus on war in eastern DRC and\ncommerce\n\nTogo\n\n## Togo heads to polls amid claims of power grab by President Gnassingb\u00e9\n\nBurkina Faso\n\n## Burkina Faso junta slams NGO report on massacre as 'baseless'\n\nHistory\n\n## How Portugal's Carnation Revolution changed the fate of its colonies in\nAfrica\n\nSouth Africa\n\n## South Africa marks Freedom Day ahead of tense election\n\nUK - Rwanda\n\n## Rwandan opposition deplores UK deportation deal as 'modern slavery'\n\nEAST AFRICA\n\n## More than 150 killed in flooding and landslides in Tanzania\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\n\n## DR Congo accuses Apple of using 'blood minerals' from war-torn east\n\nWEST AFRICA\n\n## Mauritania president to run for second term in June polls\n\nWest Africa\n\n## Burkina Faso's army massacred over 200 civilians in village raid: NGO\n\nDiplomacy\n\n## Senegal's new leader calls for a rethink of the country's relationship with\nthe EU\n\nGABON\n\n## French court rejects corruption charges against daughter of Gabon's ex-\npresident\n\nHappening now\n\n  * France\n  * Paris\n  * European Union\n  * Diplomacy\n  * Protests\n\nServices\n\n  * How to listen to RFI?\n\nApps\n\n  * Download RFI on smartphones and tablets\n\nFrance M\u00e9dias Monde\n\n  * Legal notice\n  * Privacy\n  * Cookies\n  * Web news alerts\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n  * Whatsapp\n  * Telegram\n  * TuneIn\n  * Soundcloud\n\n\u00a9 2024 Copyright RFI - All rights reserved.
