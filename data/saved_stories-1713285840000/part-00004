Here\nwe report two cryo-electron microscopy structures for TAS2R14 complexed with\nG_gust (also known as gustducin) and G_i1. Both structures have an orthosteric\nbinding pocket occupied by endogenous cholesterol as well as an intracellular\nallosteric site bound by the bitter tastant cmpd28.1, including a direct\ninteraction with the \u03b15 helix of G_gust and G_i1. Computational and\nbiochemical studies validate both ligand interactions. Our functional analysis\nidentified cholesterol as an orthosteric agonist and the bitter tastant\ncmpd28.1 as a positive allosteric modulator with direct agonist activity at\nTAS2R14. Moreover, the orthosteric pocket is connected to the allosteric site\nvia an elongated cavity, which has a hydrophobic core rich in aromatic\nresidues. Our findings provide insights into the ligand recognition of bitter\ntaste receptors and suggest activities of TAS2R14 beyond bitter taste\nperception via intracellular allosteric tastants.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\n\n## Access options\n\nAccess through your institution\n\nChange institution\n\nBuy or subscribe\n\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n\n24,99 \u20ac / 30 days\n\ncancel any time\n\nLearn more\n\nSubscribe to this journal\n\nReceive 51 print issues and online access\n\n199,00 \u20ac per year\n\nonly 3,90 \u20ac per issue\n\nLearn more\n\nBuy this article\n\n  * Purchase on Springer Link\n  * Instant access to full article PDF\n\nBuy now\n\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\n\nFig. 1: Overall structures of TAS2R14\u2013G_i1\u2013scFv16 and TAS2R14\u2013G_gust\u2013scFv16\ncomplexes.\n\nFig. 2: Activation of TAS2R14 by cholesterol binding in the orthosteric site.\n\nFig. 3: Distinct activation of TAS2R14 induced by cmpd28.1 in intracellular\nallosteric site.\n\nFig. 4: Distinct structural features facilitate binding of G\u03b1_i1 and G_gust.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Predicting and improving complex beer flavor through machine learning\n\nArticle Open access 26 March 2024\n\nMichiel Schreurs, Supinya Piampongsant, ...
