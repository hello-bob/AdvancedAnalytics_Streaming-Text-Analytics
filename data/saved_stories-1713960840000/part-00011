I will describe arguments\nthat have been made for and against such understanding, and, more generally,\nwill discuss what methods can be used to fairly evaluate understanding and\nintelligence in AI systems. I will conclude with key questions for the broader\nsciences of intelligence that have arisen in light of these discussions. Short\nBio: Melanie Mitchell is Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. Her current\nresearch focuses on conceptual abstraction and analogy-making in artificial\nintelligence systems. Melanie is the author or editor of six books and\nnumerous scholarly papers in the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive\nscience, and complex systems. Her 2009 book Complexity: A Guided Tour (Oxford\nUniversity Press) won the 2010 Phi Beta Kappa Science Book Award, and her 2019\nbook Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans (Farrar, Straus, and\nGiroux) was shortlisted for the 2023 Cosmos Prize for Scientific Writing.\nhttps://cbmm.mit.edu/news-events/even...\n\nShow less Show more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### MITCBMM\n\n53.5K subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\n## Comments 5\n\nTop comments\n\nNewest first\n\n## Transcript\n\nNaN / NaN\n\n# The Debate Over \u201cUnderstanding\u201d in AI\u2019s Large Language Models\n\nMITCBMM\n\nMITCBMM\n\n53.5K subscribers\n\n<__slot-el>\n\n<__slot-el>\n\nDownload\n\n1.6K views 1 day ago\n\n1,630 views \u2022 Apr 22, 2024\n\nShow less\n\nMelanie Mitchell, Santa Fe Institute Abstract: I will survey a current, heated\ndebate in the AI research community on whether large pre-traine ......more\n\n...more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### MITCBMM\n\n53.5K subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nShow less\n\n# The Debate Over \u201cUnderstanding\u201d in AI\u2019s Large Language Models\n\n1,630 views1.6K views\n\nApr 22, 2024\n\nDownload\n\n### CBMM10 Panel: Research on Intelligence in the Age of AI\n\nMITCBMM\n\nMITCBMM\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n112K views 5 months ago\n\n### Stanford CS25: V3 I Retrieval Augmented Language Models\n\nStanford Online\n\nStanford Online\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n114K views 2 months ago\n\n### How fly neurons compute the direction of visual motion\n\nMITCBMM\n\nMITCBMM\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n89K views 1 month ago\n\n### Large Language Models and The End of Programming - CS50 Tech Talk with Dr.\nMatt Welsh\n\nCS50\n\nCS50\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n755K views 5 months ago\n\n### John Maeda's Design in Tech Report 2024: Design Against AI | SXSW 2024\n\nSXSW\n\nSXSW\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n28K views 1 month ago\n\n### Melanie Mitchell Presents \"The Future of Artificial Intelligence\"\n\nUC Davis College of Engineering\n\nUC Davis College of Engineering\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n400 views 1 month ago\n\n### Dense Associative Memory in Machine Learning\n\nMITCBMM\n\nMITCBMM\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n3.1K views 2 months ago\n\n### Mark Zuckerberg - Llama 3, $10B Models, Caesar Augustus, & 1 GW\nDatacenters\n\nDwarkesh Patel\n\nDwarkesh Patel\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n409K views 5 days ago\n\nNew\n\n###\n\n3Blue1Brown series S3 E6\n\nAttention in transformers, visually explained | Chapter 6, Deep Learning\n\n3Blue1Brown\n\n3Blue1Brown\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n748K views 2 weeks ago\n\n### How AI Will Step Off the Screen and into the Real World | Daniela Rus | TED\n\nTED\n\nTED\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n153K views 4 days ago\n\nNew\n\n### Physical and Social Human-Robot Interaction with the iCub Humanoid\n\nMITCBMM\n\nMITCBMM\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n197 views 1 day ago\n\nNew\n\n### The Turing Lectures: What is generative AI?\n\nThe Alan Turing Institute\n\nThe Alan Turing Institute\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n58K views 5 months ago\n\n### What does it mean for computers to understand language? | LM1\n\nvcubingx\n\nvcubingx\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n16K views 3 weeks ago\n\n### The Assembly Hypothesis:Emergent Computation and Learning in a rigorous\nmodel of the Brain\n\nMITCBMM\n\nMITCBMM\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n6.6K views 2 months ago\n\n### Introduction to Large Language Models\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n4.9K views 2 weeks ago\n\n### Jeff Dean (Google): Exciting Trends in Machine Learning\n\nRice Ken Kennedy Institute\n\nRice Ken Kennedy Institute\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n162K views 2 months ago\n\n### LLaMA 3 Tested!!
