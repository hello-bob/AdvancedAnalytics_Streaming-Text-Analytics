Why does the American Diabetes Association push insulin\ninstead?\n\nThe American Diabetes Association takes millions from companies that stand to\nprofit from our reliance on drugs. Is that affecting their guidance?\n\nNeil Barsky\n\nShare\n\nFor a glimpse into how big business influences the $4tn US healthcare system,\nlook no further than the world\u2019s most powerful diabetes advocacy and research\nnon-profit, the American Diabetes Association (ADA).\n\nDiabetes afflicts 38 million Americans, with another 90 million considered\npre-diabetic. Every year the disease claims the lives of over 100,000\nAmericans and disproportionately affects people of color. It is also ruinously\nexpensive, as doctors visits, hospital stays, insulin, blood test strips, leg\namputations, continuous glucose monitors and numerous glucose-lowering drugs\nadd up to about $400bn a year. To put it bluntly, we are losing the war on\ndiabetes.\n\nAnd unlike many other diseases \u2013 such as certain cancers, Alzheimer\u2019s, kidney\ndisease, or Crohn\u2019s \u2013 type 2 diabetes is reversible.\n\nThis bears repeating and elaboration. Numerous nutritional studies have shown\nthat diabetes can be reversed through a strict diet low in carbohydrates, the\nmacronutrient that people with diabetes cannot metabolize without the help of\ndrugs. The ADA concedes this \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know it from the\ndrug therapies or the foods and recipes that the organization recommends to\npeople suffering from the condition.\n\nIn 2020, the then ADA president, Tracey D Brown, rocked the diabetes world\nwhen she disclosed that she had type 2 diabetes and had gotten off insulin and\nother medications by adhering to a low-carbohydrate diet.\n\n\u201cHere is what I do. And it is pretty simple,\u201d she said in an interview that\nmight have made the ADA\u2019s pharmaceutical benefactors crazy. \u201cElevated blood\nsugars happen when you have sugars in your body and you don\u2019t have insulin to\nmanage the sugars in your body. Carbohydrates turn into sugar. So I just try\nto get people to be aware of how many carbohydrates you are actually putting\nin your body.\u201d\n\nThe very next day, the low-carb-focused website DietDoctor.com published a\n\u201cbreaking news\u201d story about the \u201chighly encouraging news\u201d that \u201cthe\ninfluential CEO of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) is on the record as\na low-carb eater\u201d. The following year, Brown resigned her position at the ADA\nto take a senior role at Walgreens.\n\nThe evidence that low-carb diets can effectively treat diabetes has been\naround at least since before insulin\u2019s discovery in 1921, when doctors often\nprescribed very low-carb (ie low-sugar), fat-rich diets to their patients. In\nthe late 18th century, as recounted in Gary Taubes\u2019s book Rethinking Diabetes:\nWhat Science Reveals About Diet, Insulin and Successful Treatments, a Scottish\ndoctor by the name of John Rollo helped two patients with diabetes (a rarer\ncondition those days) return to health by restricting their carbohydrate\nintake.\n\n\u201cThe ingenious author of the work now before us,\u201d a 1797 article in the\nEdinburgh review Annals of Medicine said, \u201crecommends a mode of treatment,\nwhich in some cases, has been decidedly productive of remarkable benefit.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the ADA quietly and grudgingly acknowledged the low-carb diet\u2019s\neffectiveness. In a journal article on dietary guidelines in its medical\njournal Diabetes Care, the ADA gave the low-carb diet its due:\n\n\u201cLow carbohydrate eating patterns, especially very low-carbohydrate eating\npatterns, have been shown to reduce A1C\u201d \u2013 the metric that measures one\u2019s\nblood sugar levels over a period of time \u2013 \u201cand the need for antihyperglycemic\nmedications. These eating patterns are among the most studied eating patterns\nfor people with type 2 diabetes.\u201d\n\n> The ADA still sees diabetes as a progressive disease that gets worse over\n> time\n\nUnfortunately, the ADA still sees diabetes as a progressive disease that gets\nworse over time. It still sanctions insulin therapy for people with type 2\ndiabetes, a remedy many doctors say will harm patients in the long run.\n\n\u201cType 2 diabetes is a condition of too-high blood sugar and too-high insulin\nwhere the body is resisting the effects of insulin, and signaling that it has\nstored enough,\u201d Mariela Glandt, a Harvard-trained endocrinologist who\nprescribes a low-carbohydrate diet to her patients in the Bronx, told me.\n\u201cGiving insulin to someone with diabetes is like giving more alcohol to an\nalcoholic when they are shaking. It will treat the symptom \u2013 ie, the high\nsugar will come down \u2013 but in the end we make the disease worse and increase\nthe chances of long-term complications.\u201d\n\nAs I previously wrote about in the Guardian, I was diagnosed with type 2\ndiabetes three years ago and prescribed insulin shots and metformin, but was\nable to get off all medication by adhering to a strict low-carbohydrate diet.\n\nThe experience left me baffled. I couldn\u2019t understand why only a tiny minority\nof clinicians seem to recommend a diet-based approach to diabetes treatment,\nrather than the insulin-heavy regimen I was initially prescribed. Or why the\nADA\u2019s huge educational campaigns soft-pedaled the diet, and preferred to let\nmillions of people with type 2 diabetes take numerous medications or shoot\nthemselves up with insulin instead.\n\nThis is not a minor matter; if people with diabetes were told clearly and\nunambiguously that if they stopped eating carbohydrate-rich foods they could\nprobably arrest or reverse their diabetes, could thousands of lives and\nbillions of dollars be saved?\n\n\u201cThe reality is that if you want to treat type 2 diabetes effectively, the\nfirst thing you have to do is throw out the ADA\u2019s dietary guidelines,\u201d Sami\nInkinen told me. Inkinen founded Virta Health, a healthcare startup that\ntreats people with diabetes by prescribing a very low-carb diet. \u201cThe ADA has\nbeen slow to accept change. Very slow.\u201d\n\nThe ADA\u2019s messaging seems almost calculated to add to the confusion \u2013 as if,\nafter 80 years of existence and billions of dollars spent on medical research,\nthe ADA is merely a helpless observer in the low-carb diet debates.\n\n\u201cFrom carb-free to low-carb, to whole and empty carbs, it\u2019s hard to know what\nit all means,\u201d the ADA website reads. \u201c\u2018Carbohydrates\u2019 or \u2018carbs\u2019 get a lot of\nattention these days and it\u2019s no secret that carbs can affect your blood\nglucose (blood sugar). You might be wondering if you should eat less of them,\nor even eat them at all. You\u2019re not alone!\u201d\n\nThe ADA\u2019s chief scientific and medical officer, Dr Robert A Gabbay, said that\nthe ADA\u2019s dietary guidelines were the result of a rigorous scientific process\nundertaken annually by a team of medical experts who scrutinize the latest\nstudies about how best to treat type 2 diabetes. \u201cThere is no \u2018one size fits\nall\u2019,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere is more than one way for people to successfully\nmanage their diabetes.\u201d\n\nHe added that corporate funders have no say in the organization\u2019s guidelines:\n\u201cThe standards of care process receives no funding from the industry, [and]\nour guidelines and recommendations are based on science.\u201d\n\nThe ADA has a major say in how diabetes is managed globally. Its medical\npractice committees issue Standards of Care medical guidelines to American\nphysicians and doctors around the world. The organization boasts a $100m\nannual budget, 600,000 volunteers and has 20,000 members from the healthcare\ncommunity. It holds bike-a-thons and walk-a-thons, and publishes dietary\nguidelines and recipes that are downloaded by the millions every year. It\npublishes academic journals and holds medical conferences in which the latest\nresearch is presented. It funds medical research. It hosts summer camps for\nchildren with diabetes.\n\n\u201cTheir professional practice committee writes all of the guidelines that we\nfollow,\u201d Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist at the Yale School of Medicine, told\nme. \u201cClinicians have a lot of respect for that body. Their guidelines are the\nbible for diabetes medical practice.\u201d\n\nThe ADA is far from the only obstacle to widespread adoption of a low-carb\ndiet. Absent a national health education initiative that links carbohydrates\nto the diabetes epidemic, low-carb clinicians will be a voice in the\nwilderness. It can be challenging for many people with diabetes to forgo the\nbreads, sweets, pastas and starches that form the basis of many diets. And\ngiven the dearth of healthy eating options on the shelves of many American\nsupermarkets, some clinicians I spoke with, each of whom was dedicated to\ntheir patients\u2019 wellbeing, said it was more effective to simply prescribe\ntheir patients pharmaceuticals.\n\n> Diabetes was hijacked as a business opportunity almost from the moment that\n> insulin was first discovered\n\n\u201cThe low-carb diet can resonate,\u201d a retired endocrinologist told me. \u201cBut of\nall the patients I had who adopted low-carb diets, very few were from lower\nsocio-economic classes.\u201d\n\nDiabetes was hijacked as a business opportunity almost from the moment that\ninsulin \u2013 the hormone that people with type 1 diabetes cannot produce \u2013 was\nfirst discovered by a team of researchers at the University of Toronto. In\n1923, the University of Toronto board of governors sold the patent for insulin\nto Eli Lilly and Company for $1, because Lilly was better able to manufacture\nand distribute the synthetic hormone. \u201cInsulin does not belong to me,\u201d the\ninsulin medication\u2019s co-inventor, Sir Frederick G Banting, said. \u201cIt belongs\nto the world.\u201d\n\nEventually two international drug companies \u2013 now known as Novo Nordisk and\nNovartis \u2013 wrangled patents as well.\n\n\u201cThe reason the insulin story is so outrageous is that the inventors of\ninsulin wanted insulin to belong to everybody,\u201d David Mitchell, the founder of\nthe non-profit organization Patients For Affordable Drugs, told me. \u201cSomehow\nthese three drug companies got together to create a global oligopoly. It\u2019s a\nremarkable thing when you consider the birth of insulin.\u201d\n\nThe ADA\u2019s corporate contributions are not precisely traceable. Based on\nfinancial filings, this is what we know: between 2017 and 2024, more than 50\npharmaceutical and device manufacturers contributed over $134m to the\norganization, or roughly 20% of its total funding. Food industry contributions\nwere not broken out.\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to see how contributors to the ADA get bang for their buck.\nThe ADA\u2019s social media feed is a virtual supermarket of products purveyed by\nits funders.\n\nNeed a diabetes test? Go to CVS! ($10m 3 year partnership in 2021.) Want to\nlearn more about kidney care? Do it with DaVita! ($1.5m in 2024.) Want to\ndonate to the ADA? Just head over to your local GNC store and put your money\nin the tin can. ($100k in 2024.) Needless to say, a low-carbohydrate product\nthat lowers blood sugar also reduces need for the drugs and ancillary products\nthat make diabetes such a boon for the healthcare industry.\n\nIn 2021, Patients for Affordable Drugs published a landmark report exploring\nconnections between 15 patient advocacy groups and the pharmaceutical\nindustry. The ADA scored lowest because it: \u201cAccepts funding from pharma\nindustry\u201d and also because it \u201cHas board members with financial ties to pharma\nindustry; Shares lobbyist and/or lobby firm with pharma,\u201d the report said.\n\nReading the ADA\u2019s publications, one would get the impression it is a\ngrassroots organization supported by moms and pops. A banner on their website\nblares: \u201cYour Support Goes Twice as Far!\u201d Every few seconds, a pop-up\nannounces a new small donation: \u201cPatrick F donated $100.\u201d \u201cL Robert H. donated\n$12.\u201d \u201cAl S donated $20.\u201d These small donors may not know that, in 2021, the\nPatients for Affordable Drugs report, found that a third \u201cof the members of\nthe ADA board of directors have financial ties to the pharmaceutical\nindustry\u201d.\n\nDiabetes is a national scandal hiding in plain sight. Despite infinite medical\ninnovations, including glucose-lowering drugs, fast- and slow-acting insulin,\nA1C tests, continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps, more than 100,000\nAmericans die from the condition annually. In 1980, before many of these\nmedical breakthroughs were available, that number was 35,000.\n\nThe big winners of the ADA\u2019s cozy arrangements with industry, of course, are\nthe pharmaceutical companies that enjoyed an estimated $58bn in annual sales\nin 2017, and the medical device and food companies who donate to the ADA in\nexchange for recipe endorsements.\n\nThe losers are the millions of people with diabetes who suffer amputations,\nblindness, neuropathy, often daily shoot themselves with insulin and eat\ncarbohydrate-rich foods because they simply are not informed about their\nhealthier options. It is not too late for the ADA to, loudly and in no\nuncertain terms, tell people with diabetes the truth. It might lose funders,\nbut it would also save lives.\n\n  * Neil Barsky, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and investment manager, is the founder of The Marshall Project\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Diabetes\n  * Death by Diabetes: America's preventable epidemic\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
