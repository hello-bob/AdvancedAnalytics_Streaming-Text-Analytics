Then, using some\ntricks, the viewpoint wraps around this grid, which creates the illusion of an\nendless cityscape.\n\nMade with: Three.js, Blender, Unity. Models by VenCreations.\n\nShare this experiment\n\nMade by Little Workshop, a digital studio specialized in WebGL experiences.\nInterested in hiring us to build something awesome? Get in touch.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
