Sometimes\nthis is easy.\n\nIf you want to efficiently pack squares in two dimensions, you arrange them\nlike a checkerboard. To squeeze together three-dimensional cubes, you stack\nthem like moving boxes. Mathematicians can easily extend these arrangements,\npacking cubes in higher-dimensional space to perfectly fill it.\n\nPacking spheres is much harder. Mathematicians know how to pack circles or\nsoccer balls together in a way that minimizes the empty space between them.\nBut in four or more dimensions, the most efficient packing scheme is a\ncomplete mystery. (With the exception of dimensions 8 and 24, which were\nsolved in 2016.)\n\n\u201cIt sounds so simple,\u201d said Julian Sahasrabudhe, a mathematician at the\nUniversity of Cambridge. \u201cThere could be 20 different ways of approaching it.\nAnd that seems to be what\u2019s happened \u2014 there\u2019s lots of different ideas.\u201d\n\nThe known optimal sphere packings in 2, 3, 8 and 24 dimensions look like\nlattices, full of patterns and symmetry. But in every other dimension, the\nbest packings might be totally chaotic.\n\n\u201cThat, I think, is a very tantalizing aspect of it. It\u2019s really very open,\u201d\nsaid Akshay Venkatesh, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study.\n\u201cWe just do not know.\u201d\n\nLast December, Sahasrabudhe, together with his Cambridge colleague Marcelo\nCampos, Matthew Jenssen of King\u2019s College London and Marcus Michelen of the\nUniversity of Illinois, Chicago, provided a new recipe for how to densely pack\nspheres in all arbitrarily high dimensions. It\u2019s the first significant advance\non the general sphere-packing problem in 75 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful piece of mathematics,\u201d said Yufei Zhao, a mathematician at\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThere are new, groundbreaking\nideas.\u201d\n\n## Improving the Baseline\n\nThe tightest way to arrange circles on a two-dimensional plane is in a\nhexagonal pattern, with circles placed at the corners and center of each\nhexagon. Such a grid fills a bit over 90% of the plane.\n\nSamuel Velasco/Quanta Magazine\n\nIn 1611, the physicist Johannes Kepler thought about the best way to pack\nthree-dimensional spheres. For the base layer, he packed the spheres in a\nhexagonal arrangement, like the circles.\n\nHe then placed a second layer of spheres over the first, filling the gaps. But\nthen there\u2019s a choice to make. The third layer can go directly above the first\nlayer:\n\nOr it can be offset:\n\nIn both cases, the pattern then repeats. And in both cases, the spheres fill\nthe exact same amount of space: about 74%.\n\nIn 1831, Carl Friedrich Gauss, one of the most prominent mathematicians of the\n19th century, showed that Kepler\u2019s configurations are the best possible\nlattices \u2014 repeating gridlike configurations \u2014 but he wasn\u2019t able to rule out\nthe possibility that some irregular arrangement could do better. (It was\nfinally ruled out around the turn of the millenium.)\n\nIn higher dimensions, mathematicians were at a loss. Then, in 2016, Maryna\nViazovska used the existence of symmetries particular to eight-dimensional\nspace to prove that particular lattices are optimal. She also worked with\ncollaborators to extend the proof to 24 dimensions. She earned the 2022 Fields\nMedal, the highest prize in mathematics, for this work.\n\n\u201cWhat I love about [sphere packing] is the way it\u2019s a thread connecting lots\nof different areas in mathematics, in computer science and in physics,\u201d said\nHenry Cohn, a mathematician at Microsoft Research who worked with Viazovska on\nthe 24-dimensional proof.\n\nThese known optimal packings \u2014 in one, two, three, eight and 24 dimensions \u2014\ndon\u2019t seem to generalize to higher dimensions. In higher dimensions,\nmathematicians don\u2019t know what percentage of space an optimal arrangement\nwould fill. Instead, they try to approximate it.\n\nIn any dimension, if you start with a very large box and successively fill it\nwith balls \u2014 sticking one anywhere you find a large enough opening \u2014 then the\nspheres will occupy at least $latex \\frac{1}{2^d}$ of the box, where d is the\ndimension of the space. So in two dimensions, they will fill at least 1/4 of\nthe space, and in three dimensions, they will fill at least 1/8 of the space,\nand so forth. In relatively small dimensions, mathematicians often know of\nspecific packings that do much better than this general bound. (For example,\nKepler\u2019s three-dimensional packing fills 74% of the space \u2014 significantly more\nthan the minimal 12.5%.) But the $latex \\frac{1}{2^d}$ baseline is useful\nbecause it applies to all dimensions.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nFrom left: Marcus Michelen, Marcelo Campos, Julian Sahasrabudhe, and Matthew\nJenssen in Sahasrabudhe\u2019s Cambridge office on the last day of a month-long\nvisit in which they broke a 75-year-old sphere-packing record.\n\nJulia Wolf\n\n## Introduction\n\n\u201cThis is kind of the baseline,\u201d Zhao said. Progress establishing a better\nbaseline that generalizes to arbitrary dimensions has been slow.\n\nIn 1905, the mathematician Hermann Minkowski proved that in any arbitrary\nnumber of dimensions, a lattice exists that can pack in twice as many balls as\nthe baseline through the placement of a sphere at each point on the lattice.\n\nThe next substantial improvement came in 1947, when Claude Ambrose Rogers, an\nEnglish mathematician, came up with an even better lattice. Where Minkowski\u2019s\nimprovement over the baseline was by a constant factor, Rogers\u2019 scheme was an\n\u201casymptotic\u201d improvement over the baseline, meaning that as the number of\ndimensions grows, so too does the difference in the efficiency of the packing.\nIn 50 dimensions, Rogers could pack some 50 times as many spheres as the\nbaseline, but in 1,000 dimensions, his packing was roughly 1,000 times better.\n\nIn the past 75 years, a few results here and there have improved on Rogers\u2019\npacking by a constant multiple, but nobody has been able to find another\nasymptotic improvement that works in all dimensions until now.\n\n## Connecting the Dots\n\nCampos, Jenssen, Michelen and Sahasrabudhe began working together early in the\npandemic, meeting on Zoom for hours every day \u2014 though not, at first, on this\nproblem. They co-authored three papers before they first met in person last\nfall, when Jenssen and Michelen came to Cambridge for a month-long visit.\nThat\u2019s when they set their sights on the sphere-packing problem.\n\n\u201cDuring that time is when we started and essentially completed the sphere-\npacking problem,\u201d Michelen said. \u201cIt was definitely very fast, and in some\nways, it came as a bit of a surprise.\u201d\n\nMaryna Viazovska used symmetries particular to 8 and 24 dimensions to prove\nthe existence of optimal sphere packings.\n\n2022 EPFL/Fred Merz \u2013 CC-BY-SA 4.0\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe mathematicians approached the problem using graphs, which are collections\nof vertices (points) connected by edges (lines). Graphs are frequently used in\ncombinatorics and probability theory, the authors\u2019 primary research fields.\nNearly all of the lower bounds to how densely spheres can be packed have come\nfrom studying latticelike structures. But the recent paper uses graph theory\nto create highly disordered packings \u2014 a very different approach.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started to talk about it, it seemed a little bit intimidating,\u201d\nSahasrabudhe said. \u201cWe realized we could model it as a graph. Then we started\nto feel more at home.\u201d\n\nTo create their packing, they started by randomly scattering points in space.\nThese points would eventually be the centers of the spheres in the packing.\nThey then drew a line connecting any two points that were too close to each\nother \u2014 spheres centered at those two points would overlap.\n\nFrom this graph, they wanted to extract an independent set, which is a\ncollection of vertices where no two vertices are connected by an edge, like\nthose shown in red below. If they drew spheres at all the points in an\nindependent set, the balls would not overlap. They would form a sphere\npacking.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to create a sparse independent set \u2014 just grab a few vertices from\nfar-apart regions in a graph. But to make a dense sphere packing \u2014 with as\nmany balls as possible \u2014 they needed a very large independent set. Their\nchallenge was to extract an independent set using a large portion of vertices\nin the original graph.\n\nTo do so, they used a technique called the R\u00f6dl nibble, where one iteratively\nremoves (or \u201cnibbles\u201d) pieces of the graph.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a super influential technique,\u201d Sahasrabudhe said. \u201cIt goes back to the\n\u201980s, but in the last 10 to 15 years, people have really been hammering on\nit.\u201d\n\nThey started by going through every vertex in the graph. At each one, they\n(metaphorically) flipped a coin that was heavily weighted toward tails. If the\nflip landed tails, they did nothing. If it landed heads, they removed the\nvertex and added it to a new graph.\n\nThis nibbling process created an independent set using a relatively small\nportion of the original graph. But this independent set was not big enough. So\nthey repeated the process, nibbling more pieces from the original graph and\nadding them to the new graph. In the end, they got a large independent set of\nthe original graph, which was exactly what they were looking for.\n\nThis advance was the final ingredient in the proof. With their large\nindependent set, they created the densest known sphere packing in higher\ndimensions and the first asymptotic improvement on Rogers\u2019 bound. \u201cWhat amazes\nme about the new paper is just what a nice, simple idea it is,\u201d said Will\nPerkins, a theoretical computer scientist at the Georgia Institute of\nTechnology.\n\nWhile the new result is a significant improvement, it\u2019s not the final answer.\nNo one knows how close the new sphere packing is to the optimal one.\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### In Times of Scarcity, War and Peace, a Ukrainian Finds the Magic in Math\n\n  2. ### Out of a Magic Math Function, One Solution to Rule Them All\n\n  3. ### A New Tool to Help Mathematicians Pack\n\nIn 2010, the physicists Francesco Zamponi and Giorgio Parisi theorized that\nthe best possible \u201camorphous,\u201d or disordered, packing of spheres would be\nexactly twice as dense as the recent breakthrough. So mathematicians may be\nnearing the limit of how tightly spheres can be packed in a disordered way.\nBut it\u2019s possible that a sphere packing in a regular pattern could be\nsignificantly denser.\n\nIn the perennial battle between order and chaos, the new sphere packing scores\na point for disorder. But mathematicians are still undecided on whether order\nor disorder will win out.\n\n\u201cIn this case, I think it\u2019s a real mystery,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nBy Kelsey Houston-Edwards\n\nContributing Writer\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\ngeometrygraph theorymathematicssphere packingAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Mathematics\n\ntopology\n\n### Mathematicians Marvel at \u2018Crazy\u2019 Cuts Through Four Dimensions\n\nBy Jordana Cepelewicz\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n4\n\nRead Later\n\ngeometry\n\n### Geometers Engineer New Tools to Wrangle Spacecraft Orbits\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n2\n\nRead Later\n\ngeometry\n\n### Number of Distances Separating Points Has a New Bound\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\n1\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
