According to its Web site, \u201cFlinks is\na text-mode flashing word Web browser. It is intended for speed reading and/or\nskimming Web pages and text.\u201d\n\nMartin Bays, the author of the project, was first inspired by a mobile-phone\nprogram that rapidly flashed words one after the other on screen, which\npromised reading speeds of 600\u2013700 words per minute (WPM) after a few days of\npractice. Intrigued by the idea and put off by the thought that such a\ntechnically simple program cost $20, Martin set about making Flinks.\n\nAlthough I can't really demonstrate the effect on printed page, Flinks rapidly\nflashes individual words of a Web page one after the other in rapid succession\nto help train your brain for speed reading.\n\nInstallation\n\nGetting Flinks up and running is very easy, because no real installation is\nnecessary, and its dependencies are very minimal. All you need is Python,\nversion 2.4 or later, along with a working version of Lynx.\n\nDownload the latest tarball from the Web site, extract it, and open a terminal\nin the new folder. At the command line, enter:\n\n$ ./flinks\n\nUsage\n\nGiven the simple design, Flinks is best used with Web sites consisting of\nmostly text and easy navigation. A good example of this is Wikipedia, and as a\nresult, Martin has chosen it as the default Web site upon opening Flinks.\n\nTo get going, press the g key to enter a URL (you don't have to enter in the\n\u201chttp://\u201d, something like \u201cmetallica.com\u201d is fine). Once the page loads for a\nfew seconds in the browser, press the spacebar to \u201cplay\u201d the Web page.\nPressing the spacebar again will pause the browser. At this point, a great\ndeal of words starts flying at you, one after the other at a rapid speed. The\neffect is kind of startling at first but pretty darn cool.\n\nFlinks is set to a default speed of 450 WPM, but if you want to speed up or\nslow down the word rate, the up and down arrow keys adjust it accordingly. The\nleft and right arrow keys allow you to skip through sentences, and the / or ?\nkeys let you search forward or backward within the text. Other basic\nnavigation includes b to go back, u to go \u201cunback\u201d and q to quit the program.\n\nIn the end, this program is a great trip. Put on some Speed Garage (or\nconversely some Stoner/Prog rock for a time-warp effect) in the background\nwhile you try reading at 700 WPM, and you'll be in hyperspeed geek heaven.\nAnd, to quote Martin himself:\n\n\"But perhaps the most important plus of using Flinks is that having this\nalmost direct jack from the computer to my brain makes me feel like I'm living\nin the future. And the future is in text mode, just as I always dreamed it\nwould be.\"\n\nSounds good to me.\n\nhttp://mbays.freeshell.org/flinks/\n\nNo comments yet.
