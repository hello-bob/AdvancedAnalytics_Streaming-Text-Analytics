What\ninitially enticed me was the thumb keys, as well as the ability to program\ndifferent macros into the \u201cspare\u201d keys littered around the board. (I still\nhave the Kinesis Freestyle sitting in storage, buyers enquire within...)\n\nI used Monkeytype to practice typing on the keyboard, and the stats there show\nthat it took me about a month to go from the initial speed of 40wpm (quite\npainful) back up to 90wpm. That\u2019s when I started feeling properly comfortable\nwith it. I can now do about 130wpm on this keyboard, which is the same speed I\ncould do on the Freestyle and my laptop keyboard.\n\nI originally bought the Kinesis keyboard because of persistent shoulder pain\nfrom using a single keyboard. Having two keyboards that I can keep a little\nover shoulder width apart has helped to keep my physiotherapy bills down.\nSince using split keyboards, I haven\u2019t had to go to a physio to get my\nshoulders \u201cunlocked\u201d. So the keyboards have paid for themselves that way.\n\nSince buying the Ergodox, I\u2019ve also started to make good use of the layering\nsystem. You can see the full set of layouts here:\n\nA few things to note about Layer 0:\n\n  1. Backspace is where caps lock usually is. I feel strongly about this \u2013 it should be standard on all keyboards.\n  2. Held keys: Z becomes Left control, Forward slash becomes right control, semi-colon switches to the 2nd layer.\n  3. Backtick and tilde are on the bottom left of the left keyboard. This button, when held, switches to the 1st layer.\n  4. Command, option and escape are on the thumb keys. No \u201cEmacs claw\u201d for complicated shortcuts.\n  5. Top left is equals. It gets special preference as I type it a lot when coding.\n  6. The \u201cHyper\u201d key is one of the keys required for my Hammerspoon shortcuts. I use these to move quickly between apps.\n  7. There are shortcuts on the thumb keys for cut (the knife), paste and copy.\n  8. I could probably remap that spare \u201cTab\u201d on the right thumb to something else \u2013 I use the top-left tab out of habit. I don\u2019t have an immediate idea of what it could map to.\n\nA keen observer would note that there\u2019s no curly brackets on here, and yet I\nstill somehow manage to write Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects. I keep those\non Layer 1, where the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cR\u201d keys are my brackets. If I hold backtick\n(bottom left of the left keyboard), this triggers the layer switcher to switch\nto Layer 1. My keyboard indicates this by lighting up a red LED. When I then\npress \u201cE\u201d, I get a square bracket. If I do the same holding of backtick but\npress \u201cE\u201d twice, I get a curly bracket. I think this is one of the cooler\nfeatures of this keyboard. You can configure actions when a key is tapped,\ndouble tapped, held, or tapped then held. I use the first 3 of these, but\nhaven\u2019t found a use for tapped then held yet.\n\nOn Layer 1\u2019s right-hand panel is the arrow keys. I still can\u2019t map it in my\nbrain that left and right arrows are on the left keyboard, and up and down are\non the right. So I\u2019ve got the traditional arrow layout on that layer, on the\nright of the keyboard roughly where my hand expects it to be.\n\nNext, we have Layer 2 which is the media controls. On my laptop keyboard,\nthese are on the function keys, which always felt like a bit of a hard reach.\nTo get to this layer I hold the semi-colon key, and the keyboard indicates\nit\u2019s switched with a green LED. I can then do all the regular music things\nlike play, pause, mute, etc.\n\nFor reasons that are completely opaque to me, there can be up to 32 different\nlayers on the keyboard. I cannot imagine ever needing more than the few that I\nhave right now. Even thinking about the keyboard contortion that would be\nrequired to switch to a 32nd layer and not the 28th layer is giving me a\nheadache.\n\nFinally: a word on the switches inside the keyboard itself. The keyboard came\nwith Cherry Brown switches which are what I would consider to be the greatest\nargument ever against working from the office. They were ridiculously loud.\nAnd stiff enough that even someone who types as hard as I do noticed how hard\nI had to press. I\u2019ve since replaced the switches with Cherry Reds which are\nquieter and not as stiff. I think this has made maybe a 5-10% improvement on\nmy accuracy and speed for this keyboard.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
