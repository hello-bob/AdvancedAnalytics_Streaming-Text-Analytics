This week we're joined by Evan Ovadia,\ncreator of the Vale programming language and collector of memory management\ntechniques from far and wide. He takes us through his most important ones,\nincluding linear types, generation references and regions, to see what Evan\nhopes the future of memory management will look like. If you've been\ninterested in Rust's borrow-check and want more (or want different!) then Evan\nhas some big ideas for you to sink your teeth into. \u2013 Vale: https://vale.dev/\nThe Vale Discord: / discord Evan\u2019s Blog: https://verdagon.dev/home Evan\u2019s 7DRL\nEntry: https://verdagon.dev/blog/higher-raii... 7DRL: https://7drl.com/\nhttps://verdagon.dev/grimoire/grimoire What Colour Is Your Function?:\nhttps://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/20... 42, the language: https://forty2.is/\nVerona Language: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/resea...
