We've\nplayed ours already. No ads here ever, not even our own.\n\n### Setup Concierge\n\nDNS setup can be intimidating and cause of many problems. If needed, we can\nsetup your DNS for email without any additional fees.\n\n### IPv4 + IPv6 Support\n\nSend, receive and access your mails over either IPv4 or IPv6. IPv6 not only\nexpands address space but makes the Internet more efficient.\n\n### Auto-Responder\n\nGoing off-line for a while?

Our interests align with our users and not those of investors.\n\n### Here to Stay\n\nWe have been serving users worldwide since 2014. Web agencies, startups,\nfamilies, NGOs and many others entrust us their email needs.\n\n### Security, Privacy, & Trust\n\nYour emails are your own business. We have no interest in them. We do not\naccess^1, analyse^2, scan or share any user data.\n\n### Continuously Monitored\n\nWe're never running on auto pilot. We monitor all traffic patterns across all\ndomains. We often catch abuse before it happens.\n\n### Refund Guarantee\n\nMigadu may turn out not to be for you. We offer a full refund within the first\n7 days. The following 7 days we may give a pro-rata refund, after which all\nsales are final.\n\nThere is (way) more...\n\n### SIEVE Filtering\n\nFilter your incoming messages using SIEVE scripts which you can manage using\nManageSieve protocol.

Prevent abuse or data leakage by\nmonitoring email traffic.\n\n### Functional Admin\n\nOur administration panel is different than most you have seen. It is an\nopinionated application that wants to minimize your time in it, not maximize\nit as it has become norm nowadays.\n\n### Catchalls\n\nAfraid of missing improperly addressed messages on your domains? We support\ncatchalls, though we do not recommended them.\n\n### Built on Open Source\n\nMigadu is built and operated 100% on top of open source technologies. We\ncontribute to the branch we are sitting on, both financially and with code.\n\n### Multi-Admin Access\n\nSharing the account with multiple admins? No problem, you can even limit\nadmins to specific domains only.\n\n### Automatic Footers\n\nLove sending disclaimers or no-print reminders in your messages? Configure a\nfooter and it will be automatically attached to your outgoing messages.\n\n## Got own clients?\n\n### Unlimited Domains & Mailboxes\n\nNo limits on the number of addresses or domains your account can have.\n\n### Multi-admin Access\n\nYou can open multiple administrators for your account and limit access to only\nselected domains.\n\n### Set Limits\n\nPrevent quota starvation by setting limits on the domains and mailboxes.\n\n### Monitor Domain Health\n\nIf a domain DNS configuration is broken, be the first to know about it.\n\n### No Lock-In\n\nWe use only standard email protocols which means you can easily extract your\ndata at any point in time.\n\n### Backups\n\nAll mailboxes are continuously backed up and ready for restoration in case of\nmalware or user mistakes.\n\n## Management Panel\n\nOur admin panel won't win any beauty contests and that's a good thing. It's\nbuilt to be obvious and efficient.\n\nWe do not distract with irrelevant branding, mood illustrations, animations\nand noise, and let you go fast about your business.\n\nWe respect your time just as much we do ours.\n\nFor the world, Made in Switzerland Copyright \u00a9 Migadu-Mail GmbH 2023\n\n", "frontpage": false}
