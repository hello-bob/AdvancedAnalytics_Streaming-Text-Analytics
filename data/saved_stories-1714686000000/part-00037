This collaboration aims to foster\ninnovation in hardware enablement, enhance user experience, and strengthen our\ncollective commitment to open-source hardware and software.\n\nAs part of this partnership, we are launching a special initiative to empower\nenthusiasts like you to contribute to the improvement of documentation and\nsupport for the Framework laptop within the NixOS ecosystem. Here\u2019s how it\nworks:\n\n## What We\u2019re Offering:\n\nWe are offering the opportunity for selected community members to receive a\nFramework laptop in exchange for actively participating in support requests\nand enhancing documentation specific to the Framework laptop on NixOS.\n\n## How to Participate:\n\nIf you\u2019re passionate about open-source technology and eager to contribute, we\nencourage you to apply for this program by filling out the application form\nhere: https://kumo.lahfa.xyz/apps/forms/s/wee8EFnc2enJazw4JQzDFXGP 136 [1].\n\n## Expectations on Why You Would Be a Good Fit for This Opportunity:\n\nWe are seeking candidates who exhibit a strong track record of active\ncontribution within the NixOS community.\n\nFor example, individuals who have been active contributors in projects such as\nnixos-hardware and nixpkgs, demonstrating their expertise in hardware\nenablement, are highly encouraged to apply. Additionally, candidates who have\nactively participated in documenting hardware configurations in the NixOS wiki\nor manual showcase their commitment to transparency and accessibility, which\nare integral to the success of this initiative.\n\nBesides, we highly value individuals from marginalized backgrounds who stand\nto benefit significantly from this opportunity. Our aim is to foster diversity\nand inclusion within the NixOS community while enhancing support for Framework\nlaptops.\n\n## Selection Process:\n\nWe will carefully review all applications and select participants based on\ntheir enthusiasm, expertise, and willingness to actively engage in support and\ndocumentation efforts.

I actually am in a similar position, my\nloved one has a Framework 13\" AMD that I gifted them and I do the NixOS\nmaintenance for them.\n\nI will not applying (conflict of interest, of course), but I will help with\nQA/testing and facilitating nixos-hardware work and supporting anyone\nbenefiting from this!\n\nteto\n\n13h\n\nHi, thanks for that great announcement. I was planning to get a framework and\nwill likely have some free time soon so this is quite interesting.\n\n> This partnership entails selected community members receiving a Framework\n> laptop\n\nIs there an already known maximu number of how many candidates could be\nselected ?\n\n> to receive a Framework laptop in exchange for actively participating in\n> support requests and enhancing documentation specific to the Framework\n> laptop on NixOS.\n\nis the laptop given or lent ? is there going to be contractual number of hours\n?

What if the person receives a laptop and does nothing in return (sry\n> my brain always imagines the worst scenario first) ?\n\nThe laptop is given. I do not have contractual details yet but I believe the\nidea is to support reasonably the folks that needs help with Framework and\nsupport the NixOS expressions surrounding it.\n\nIf someone receives a laptop and does nothing in return, this is embarrassing,\nI believe we will need the person to return the laptop in one piece to me or\nsomeone else who pledge to work on it. Ideally, the work through the forms is\nto select folks who have shown track record to do work and show it.\n\nObviously, we all have a life and it is perfectly understandable to have\nunexpected events that may rescind some work someone wants to do. We are aware\nof this and if this would arise, we would work to our utmost to figure out a\nsolution that makes sense for the Framework Community and the NixOS community\nand the individual.\n\nteto:\n\n> Is there an already known maximu number of how many candidates could be\n> selected ?\n\nWe know a lower bound: 3.\n\nWe do not know an upper bound yet, I suppose, this is also our opportunity to\nshow what the NixOS community can do in terms of quality work . I\u2019m exciting\nto see this!\n\ntestplayername\n\n12h\n\nMight this mean Framework will officially support NixOS? According to Status\nof Official Linux Distribution Support - Framework Team - Framework Community\n13 the only Linux distros that Framework officially support are Ubuntu LTS and\nFedora.\n\nRaitoBezarius\n\n12h\n\nUnder assumption that things go well, it\u2019s my understanding this would be the\nplan for the Framework folks, yes.\n\nRossComputerGuy\n\n11h\n\nThis is very interesting, especially seeing the \u201cUnannounced model (NDA)\u201d\noption. I hope it\u2019s aarch64 since imo, x86 is an architecture which needs to\ngo away. Plus, Frameworks have always been interesting ever since I saw LTT\u2019s\nfirst video on it. I would be interested in seeing how fast it could compile\nLLVM.\n\nAndersonTorresGreat contributor\n\n9h\n\nNow I am even more interested! Unfortunately it would be almost impossible to\nimport one to Brazil.\n\ncolinsane\n\n5h\n\nfor the \u201cunreleased model (NDA)\u201d, how would that NDA impact the form of one\u2019s\ncontributions? (potential) code contributions would go into some private repo\nuntil the NDA is lifted? or the NDA is broad enough that contributions can\nstill go into public repos just under some product codename until the model is\nformally released?\n\nnotably, i keep the config for all my hosts public, and since i share a lot\nbetween these hosts my concern is if the NDA has implications for how i manage\nthose configs.\n\ncodemichael\n\n2h\n\nI have a FW16 running NixOS and would be happy to contribute to documentation\nand similar.\n\nahoneybun\n\n23m\n\nIt\u2019s fantastic to see some OEM support of NixOS!\n\n### Suggested Topics\n\nTopic| Replies| Views| Activity  \n---|---|---|---  \nAnnouncing nixpkgs-merge-botAnnouncements| 3.8k| Nov '23  \nAnnouncing nixlang.wikiAnnouncements| 3.5k| Dec '23  \nThe garn devlogAnnouncements| 816| Dec '23  \nNixCon NA 2024 - Call for Proposals!Announcements| 1.8k| Dec '23  \nJanurary Nix-community infra updateAnnouncements| 478| Jan 5  \n  \n### Want to read more?
