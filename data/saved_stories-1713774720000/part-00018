Rather than stay in America (see essay below), Turing\ninstead returned to Cambridge, where he had been a fellow at King\u2019s College\nsince 1936.\n\n#### Alan Turing in America\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Veisdal\n\n\u00b7\n\nMay 14, 2021\n\nRead full story\n\nFor about a year, starting in September 1938, Turing worked part-time at the\nGovernment Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), engaging in research on the\ncryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher machine. In his spare time, he\nattended various lectures at Cambridge, including a graduate seminar held by\nphilosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) on the foundations of mathematics.\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s seminar, as he himself described it, regarded investigations\ninto \u201cthe role that logic plays in mathematics, or the relation supposed to\nhold between logic and mathematics\u201d. In particular, Wittgenstein was\ninterested in interrogating mathematicians\u2019 attitudes towards contradictions,\nan attitude of \u201cavoiding them at all costs\u201d, or as he put it, of \u201ca germ which\nshows general illness\u201d (Vanrie, 2024; Berg, 2021). Finding a contradiction in\na system, Wittgenstein argued, is to mathematicians akin to \u201cfinding a germ in\nan otherwise healthy body\u201d and arguing that this \u201cshows that the whole system\nor body is diseased\u201d. This view ran counter to his own views, which\u2014in his\nlater work\u2014maintained that mathematics is a human invention and that\ncontradictions more-so indicate flaws in this invention than truths about the\nabsurdity of reality. Wittgenstein in his seminar, thus, sought to discredit\n\u2018contradictory calculus\u2019, a contraption he regarded as inherently defective.\n\nTuring disagreed. His most celebrated result, entitled \u2018On Computable Numbers,\nwith an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\u2019 employed proof by\ncontradiction in showing that Hilbert\u2019s \u201cdecision problem\u201d did not have a\nsolution\u2014that some problems are indeed undecidable. The result had concrete\nimplications for the development of the computer. Turing\u2014in other words\u2014was\nbuilding a career on a result obtained using the very contraption that\nWittgenstein was looking to suppress.\n\nThis essay is about the colliding of two worlds in one Cambridge classroom in\n1939\u2014the anti-Platonist late Wittgenstein and the realist views of Turing and,\nin turn, his hero Kurt G\u00f6del (1906-1978).\n\n## Keep reading with a 7-day free trial\n\nSubscribe to Privatdozent to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free\naccess to the full post archives.\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
