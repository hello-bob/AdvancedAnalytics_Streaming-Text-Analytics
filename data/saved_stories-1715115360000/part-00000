But now, there are two: \u201cim-a-good-\ngpt2-chatbot\u201d and \u201cim-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot.\u201d These models exhibited the\nsame GPT-4 level capabilities, with some saying they\u2019re even better than the\noriginal.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nOpenAI Launches ChatGPT Enterprise For Businesses\n\nAI This Week: The Hollywood Writer's Strike May Have Ended, But the Battle\nOver AI is Far From Finished\n\nNo Google AI Search, I Don\u2019t Need to Learn About the \u201cBenefits of Slavery\u201d\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nNo Google AI Search, I Don\u2019t Need to Learn About the \u201cBenefits of Slavery\u201d\n\nThese models are even more fleeting than the first gpt2-chatbot. Most AI\nmodels on LMSYS you can select from a dropdown menu. However, the only way to\naccess \u201cim-a-good-gpt2-chatbot\u201d and \u201cim-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot\u201d is by\nnavigating to LMSYS Chatbot Arena (battle). There you can enter a prompt and\nhope one of the chatbots comes up randomly. Despite the strange nature of\nthese AI chatbots, they\u2019ve once again drawn massive attention from the AI\ncommunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nOpenAI Launches ChatGPT Enterprise For Businesses\n\nAI This Week: The Hollywood Writer's Strike May Have Ended, But the Battle\nOver AI is Far From Finished\n\nNo Google AI Search, I Don\u2019t Need to Learn About the \u201cBenefits of Slavery\u201d\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nNo Google AI Search, I Don\u2019t Need to Learn About the \u201cBenefits of Slavery\u201d\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted \u201cim-a-good-gpt2-chatbot\u201d on Sunday, a day before\nthese chatbots went online, which many see as confirmation that OpenAI is A/B\ntesting new models. LMSYS Org typically only works with major AI model\nproviders, offering many of them anonymous testing services. Gizmodo could not\nverify this, but that didn\u2019t stop the online community from running wild with\nspeculation about what OpenAI is cooking up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI and LMSYS Org did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for\ncomment.\n\nOn Reddit and X, users are trying to decrypt Altman\u2019s tweets, past OpenAI\nrelease trends, and information from gpt2-chatbot to decipher what\u2019s coming\nnext. The most popular theory in these channels is that gpt2-chatbot is an old\nAI model from OpenAI, bolstered by an advanced architecture. That said, this\nis all speculation, and it\u2019s still unclear if these AI models are even from\nOpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnline communities have also been impressed with im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot and\nim-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot. Just like the original gpt2-chatbot, some say\nthese AI models outperform current versions of ChatGPT. One user claims they\nwere able to code a mobile game by simply asking \u201ccode Flappy Bird game in\nPython.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI reportedly planned an event at the company\u2019s headquarters on Thursday\nto showcase product demonstrations and share updates, according to The\nInformation. However, the report states the company is now considering\npostponing the event. The report didn\u2019t identify what the event was about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking at Harvard University last week, Altman told a crowd that the\ngpt2-chatbot was not GPT-4.5, according to a report from Axios. However,\nAltman did not clarify whether this was or wasn\u2019t an OpenAI product.\n\nGizmodo was able to use \u201cim-a-good-gpt2-chatbot\u201d in the LMSYS battle arena. In\nour limited testing, we found the chatbot exhibited capabilities similar to\nGPT-4, and other AI models in that class. It answered some questions more\naccurately than Meta\u2019s Llama-3b-70b-instruct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA question that tests pattern recognition. Llama got it wrong, but\ngpt2-chatbot was correct.

It seems clear that a power player is behind them, and Altman seems\nintent on fanning the flames, as online communities speculate this is OpenAI.\nRegardless, new AI models are on the horizon, even if we don\u2019t know what their\norigins are.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
