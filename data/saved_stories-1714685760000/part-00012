Dhime is designed specifically for the beginners. People with\nno prior dance skills can definetely learn dance from Dhime. Infact, beginners\nget the maximum benefit from Dhime.\n\nNot at all. The app records the video of the student dance, only for analysing\nthe dance. The recorded video is never sent out of the mobile/laptop. And it\nis automatically deleted, immediately after the analysis is over. So, the user\ndoes not have to worry about the privacy at all.\n\nIn Dhime, the tutor and the student never interact with each other directly\n(either online or offline). The student learns from the video lessons created\nby a tutor but does not come face to face with the tutor. The learning happens\nin the presence of AI and not in the presence of a live tutor.\n\nDhime's AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a specialized software that analyses\nthe students dance by comparing it with the tutors dance. This advanced and\nspeciailized AI is built at Dhime specifically for this application.\n\nFor dance learning, Dhime does much more than YouTube. YouTube can show dance\nlessons but it cannot give any feedback/guidance to the student. Students\nlearning from YouTube do not get suggestions on how to correct themselves.\nWith Dhime, in addition to getting carefully designed and created dance\nlessons, the students also get instant feedback on how to correct themselves.\n\nNot at all. Zoom classes require a tutor and a student to be present at the\nsame time. Whereas Dhime just needs the student to be online. In Dhime, the\ntutor is never involved directly in the learning process of the student. As a\nresult, a student has the flexibility to use Dhime whenever he wants.\n\nNo. The dance lessons are designed and created by the real experienced dance\ntutors. AI just analyses a student's dance and gives feedback to the student\nto correct himself.\n\n# Contact Us\n\nPhone\n\n(+91) 8296516518\n\nE-Mail\n\ninfo@dhime.in\n\nLinkedin linkedin.com/company/dhime\n\nAddress\n\nT17 17115, Prestige Lakeside Habitat, Gunjur, Bengaluru - 560087\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Dhime\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
