These kinds\nof national security responsibilities once sat almost exclusively in\nWashington, DC. Now in this corner of Washington state, dozens of engineers\nand intelligence analysts are dedicated to watching and stopping the\ngovernment-sponsored hackers proliferating around the world.\n\nMembers of the so-called MSTIC (Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center) team are\nthreat-focused: one group is responsible for Russian hackers code-named\nStrontium, another watches North Korean hackers code-named Zinc, and yet\nanother tracks Iranian hackers code-named Holmium. MSTIC tracks over 70 code-\nnamed government-sponsored threat groups and many more that are unnamed.\n\nThe rain started just before I arrived on a typical fall day in Redmond,\nWashington. It kept coming down for my entire visit. Microsoft headquarters is\nas vast and labyrinthine as any government installation, with hundreds of\nbuildings and thousands of employees. I\u2019d come to meet the Microsoft team that\ntracks the world\u2019s most dangerous hackers.\n\n### Offense and defense\n\nJohn Lambert founded and manages MSTIC.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nJohn Lambert has been at Microsoft since 2000, when a new cybersecurity\nreality was first setting in both in Washington, DC, and at Microsoft\u2019s\nWashington state headquarters.\n\nMicrosoft, then a singularly powerful company that monopolized PC software,\nhad only relatively recently realized the importance of the internet. With\nWindows XP having conquered the world while remaining shockingly insecure, the\nteam witnessed a series of enormous and embarrassing security failures,\nincluding self-replicating worms like Code Red and Nimda. The failures\naffected many of Microsoft\u2019s huge numbers of government and private sector\ncustomers, endangering its core business. Not until 2002, when Bill Gates sent\nout his famous memo urging an emphasis on \u201ctrustworthy computing,\u201d did Redmond\nfinally begin to grapple with the importance of cybersecurity.\n\nThis is when Lambert became fascinated with the offensive side of cyber.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perfection required in the bounds of attack and defense,\u201d Lambert\ntold me. \u201cTo defend well, you have to be able to attack. You have to have the\noffensive mind-set too; you can\u2019t just think about defense if you don\u2019t know\nhow to be creative about offense.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter seeing the number of government-sponsored hacking campaigns increase,\nLambert used this offensive mind-set to help drive fundamental changes in the\nway Microsoft approached the problem. The goal was to move from an unknowable\n\u201cshadow world\u201d\u2014where defense teams watch, frustrated, as sophisticated hackers\npenetrate networks with potent \u201czero-day vulnerabilities\u201d\u2014into a domain where\nMicrosoft can see almost anything.\n\n\u201cWhat are the superpowers of Microsoft?\u201d Lambert remembers asking.\n\nThe answer is that its Windows operating system and other software are almost\neverywhere, giving Microsoft the tools to sense what happens on colossal\nswaths of the internet. That raises real and ongoing privacy questions we\nstill haven\u2019t fully grappled with. For security, however, it\u2019s an enormous\nadvantage.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s products already had Windows Error Report systems built in to try\nto understand general bugs and malfunctions by means of telemetry, or\ncollecting data from any of the company\u2019s hardware or software in use. But it\nwas Lambert and the security teams who turned the telemetry systems into\npowerful security tools, transforming what was once a slow and arduous task.\nPreviously, security teams often had to physically go around the world, find\nspecific targeted machines, copy their hard drives, and dive into the\nincidents slowly. Now those machines simply reach out to Microsoft. Virtually\nevery crash and unexpected behavior is reported to the company, which sorts\nthrough the mass of data and, often, finds malware before anyone else.\n\nThe malware known as Bad Rabbit, which in 2017 pretended to be an Adobe Flash\nupdate and then wiped a victim\u2019s hard drive, crystallizes how Microsoft\nchanged weakness to strength. Within 14 minutes of the ransomware\u2019s\nintroduction, machine-learning algorithms pieced through the data and quickly\nbegan to understand the threat. Windows Defender began blocking it\nautomatically, well before any human knew what was happening.\n\nBad Rabbit was spotted predominantly in Russia and Ukraine in 2017. This is\nthe ransom note victims received.\n\nSource image: Kaspersky Labs\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing that nobody else has: visibility and data. The data that\nnobody else has is around those application crashes at the operating system\nand the software layer,\u201d says Jake Williams, a former member of the National\nSecurity Agency. \u201cEven for third-party crashes, they have telemetry around\nthose. As you start looking at exploit targets, Microsoft has the ability\nthrough their telemetry.\u201d That telemetry has made every Windows machine and\nproduct into a source that feeds Microsoft data and logs, instantly and\nworldwide, on anything unusual.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft sees stuff that just nobody else does,\u201d says Williams, who founded\nthe cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec. \u201cWe routinely find stuff, for\ninstance, like flags for malicious IPs in Office 365 that Microsoft flags, but\nwe don\u2019t see it anywhere else for months.\u201d\n\n### Connect the dots\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCyber threat intelligence is the discipline of tracking adversaries, following\nbread crumbs, and producing intelligence you can use to help your team and\nmake the other side\u2019s life harder. To achieve that, the five-year-old MSTIC\nteam includes former spies and government intelligence operators whose\nexperience at places like Fort Meade, home to the National Security Agency and\nUS Cyber Command, translates immediately to their roles at Microsoft.\n\nMSTIC names dozens of threats, but the geopolitics are complicated: China and\nthe United States, two of the most significant players in cyberspace and the\ntwo biggest economies on earth, are virtually never called out the way\ncountries like Iran, Russia, and North Korea frequently are.\n\n\u201cOur team uses the data, connects the dots, tells the story, tracks the actor\nand their behaviors,\u201d says Jeremy Dallman, a director of strategic programs\nand partnerships at MSTIC. \u201cThey\u2019re hunting the actors\u2014where they\u2019re moving,\nwhat they\u2019re planning next, who they are targeting\u2014and getting ahead of that.\u201d\n\nTanmay Ganacharya leads advanced threat protection research on the Microsoft\nDefender team, which is applying data science to the mass of incoming signals\nin an effort to craft new layers of defense. \u201cBecause we have products across\nany field you can think of, we have sensors that are bringing us the right\nkind of signals,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem was, how do we actually deal with all\nthis data?\u201d\n\nMicrosoft, like other tech giants including Google and Facebook, regularly\nnotifies people targeted by government hackers, which gives the targets the\nchance to defend themselves. In the last year, MSTIC has notified around\n10,000 Microsoft customers that they\u2019re being targeted by government hackers.\n\n### New targets\n\nBeginning in August, MSTIC spotted what\u2019s known as a password spraying\ncampaign. Hackers took around 2,700 educated guesses at passwords for accounts\nassociated with an American presidential campaign, government officials,\njournalists, and high-profile Iranians living outside Iran. Four accounts were\ncompromised in this attack.\n\nAnalysts at MSTIC identified the compromises in part by tracking\ninfrastructure Microsoft says it knows is controlled exclusively by the\nIranian hacking group Phosphorus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOnce we understand their infrastructure\u2014we have an IP address we know is\ntheirs that they use for malicious purposes\u2014we can start looking at DNS\nrecords, domains created, platform traffic,\u201d Dallman says. \u201cWhen they turn\naround and start using that infrastructure in this kind of attack, we see it\nbecause we\u2019re already tracking that as a known indicator of that actor\u2019s\nbehavior.\u201d\n\nAfter doing considerable reconnaissance work, Phosphorus tried to exploit the\naccount recovery process by using targets\u2019 real phone numbers. MSTIC has\nspotted Phosphorus and other government-sponsored hackers, including Russia\u2019s\nFancy Bear, repeatedly using that tactic to try to phish two-factor\nauthentication codes for high-value targets.\n\nWhat raised Microsoft\u2019s alarm above normal on this occasion was that\nPhosphorus varied its standard operating procedure of going after NGOs and\nsanctions organizations. The cross-hairs shifted, the tactics changed, and the\nscope grew.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t uncommon, but the difference here was that this was on a\nsignificantly larger scale than we had seen before,\u201d Dallman says. \u201cThey\ntarget these types of people frequently, but it was the scale and the massive\namount of reconnaissance work that they had done for this campaign [that was\ndifferent]. And then ultimately it came down to the individuals they were\ntargeting, including the individual on the presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s sleuthing ultimately pointed the finger at Iranian hackers for\ntargeting presidential campaigns including, Reuters reported, Donald Trump\u2019s\n2020 reelection operation.\n\nMicrosoft's Redmond campus is is huge. At over 8 million square feet, it's\nhome to over 50,000 employees.\n\nsource: Microsoft\n\n### \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the patterns.\u201d\n\nIn Lambert\u2019s two decades at Microsoft, the tools and weapons of the cyber\ndomain have proliferated to dozens more countries, hundreds of capable\ncybercrime groups, and\u2014increasingly\u2014an industry of private-sector companies\nselling exploits internationally to buyers willing to pay top dollar.\n\n\u201cProliferation means a much broader range of victims,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cMore\nactors to track.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is showing up in political hacks. One consequence of the 2016 US election\nis a rise in the sheer number of players fighting to hack political parties,\ncampaigns, and think tanks, not to mention government itself. Election-related\nhacking has typically been the province of the \u201cbig four\u201d\u2014Russia, China, Iran,\nand North Korea. But it\u2019s spreading to other countries, although the Microsoft\nresearchers declined to specify what they\u2019ve seen.\n\n\u201cWhat is different is that you\u2019re getting additional countries joining the\nfray that weren\u2019t necessarily there before,\u201d says Jason Norton, a principal\nproject manager on MSTIC. \u201cThe big two [Russia and China]\u2014now, we can say\nthey\u2019ve been historically going after this since well before the 2016\nelection. But now you\u2019re getting to see additional countries do that\u2014poking\nand prodding the soft underbelly in order to know the right pieces to have an\ninfluence or impact in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe field is getting crowded,\u201d Dallman agrees. \u201cActors are learning from each\nother. As they learn tactics from the more prominent names, they turn that\naround and use them.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming election is different, too, in that no one is surprised to see\nthis malicious activity. Leading into 2016, Russian cyber activity was greeted\nwith a collective dumbfounded na\u00efvet\u00e9, contributing to paralysis and an unsure\nresponse. Not this time.\n\n\u201cThe difference really comes down to what we know is going to happen,\u201d Dallman\nexplains.\n\n\u201cThen, it was more of an unknown, and we weren\u2019t sure how the tactics would\ndevelop. Now we know; we\u2019ve seen the patterns. You saw them in 2016, you saw\nwhat they did in Germany, you saw them in the French elections\u2014all following\nthe same MO. The 2018 midterms, too\u2014to a lesser degree, but we still saw some\nof the same MO, the same actors, the same timing, the same techniques. Now we\nknow, going into 2020, that this is the MO we\u2019re looking for. And now we\u2019ve\nstarted to see other countries come out and start doing other tactics.\u201d\n\nThe new normal is that industry cyberintelligence shops tend to lead the way\nin this type of public security activity while government follows.\n\nIn 2016, it was CrowdStrike that first investigated and pointed the finger at\nRussian activity aiming to interfere with the American election. The US law\nenforcement and intelligence community later confirmed the company\u2019s findings\nand eventually, after Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, indicted Russian hackers\nand detailed Moscow\u2019s campaign.\n\nAt a total size of over $1 trillion, Microsoft is an order of magnitude\nlarger, bringing enormous resources to the security challenge. And the tech\ngiant has another great advantage: it has eyes, ears, and software everywhere.\nThat, as Lambert might say, is its superpower.\n\n### by Patrick Howell O'Neill\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
