This version brings many\nexciting improvements to GitLab, but also removes some deprecated features. We\nare introducing three breaking change windows during which we expect breaking\nchanges to be deployed to GitLab.com. You can read more about it on our\nblogpost. The third breaking change window begins 2024-05-06 09:00 UTC and\nends 2024-05-08 22:00 UTC.\n\nSelect Git revision\n\n  * Branches 20\n  * main default\n  * renovate/configure\n  * smattr/gitlab-1399\n  * smattr/8082f44e-7577-44a2-87ca-ad1ad6c80d68\n  * smattr/cd67deec-2bd2-4b4a-b2e6-2e8ce2f01c52-1\n  * smattr/d0e9fe13-ece9-4a70-8469-051332db6ecc\n  * smattr/b8ee740d-bedc-4317-ad14-0e72decb02b5\n  * smattr/6f98a376-331c-413d-b67e-312ae781b34f\n  * smattr/116502e3-195b-46c8-8bb0-7549b7694c6a\n  * smattr/nehaljwani-pangocairo\n  * smattr/f35723fc-9855-4ba8-8b02-fde38a5156a4\n  * smattr/a1b8e698-f7ad-4b30-a48b-c30ea6f334e0\n  * smattr/d853834a-1c51-4437-988c-b92e1587fc31\n  * 1918-feature-request-subgraph-as-a-node\n  * smattr/2cf23838-3ac5-4e6a-b04f-5cd49a748910\n  * smattr/4f8a3a2e-71f5-4fe7-961e-e1dcabe6af05\n  * cairo-svg\n  * smattr/7274ea57-04ed-4877-918e-989acc6cae8b\n  * smattr/ba832af5-36ff-48c4-8cd6-49d584aac710\n  * smattr/e1c72f1c-35a1-4064-8d9d-c1724e371e5b\n\n  * Tags 20\n  * 11.0.0\n  * 10.0.1\n  * 9.0.0\n  * 8.1.0\n  * 8.0.5\n  * 8.0.4\n  * 8.0.3\n  * 8.0.2\n  * 8.0.1\n  * 7.1.0\n  * 7.0.6\n  * 7.0.5\n  * 7.0.4\n  * 7.0.3\n  * 7.0.2\n  * 7.0.1\n  * 7.0.0\n  * 6.0.2\n  * 6.0.1\n  * 5.0.1\n\n40 results\n\nHistory\n\n  * Open in your IDE\n\n    * Visual Studio Code (SSH)\n    * Visual Studio Code (HTTPS)\n    * IntelliJ IDEA (SSH)\n    * IntelliJ IDEA (HTTPS)\n  * Download source code\n\n    * zip\n    * tar.gz\n    * tar.bz2\n    * tar\n\n  * Copy SSH clone URLgit@gitlab.com:graphviz/graphviz.git\n  * Copy HTTPS clone URLhttps://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.git\n\nMerge branch 'xry111/redudant-decl' into 'main'\n\nMatthew Fernandez authored 6 hours ago\n\n    \n    \n    cgraph: Remove redundant declaration of aghtmlstr See merge request !3739\n\nbd7b2a0c\n\nName| Last commit| Last update  \n---|---|---  \nci  \ncmake  \ncmd  \nconfig  \ncontrib  \ndebian  \ndoc  \ndot.demo  \ngraphs  \nlib  \nm4  \nmacosx  \nplugin.demo  \nplugin  \nredhat  \nshare  \ntclpkg  \ntests  \nwindows  \n.clang-format  \n.gitattributes  \n.gitignore  \n.gitlab-ci.yml  \n.gitmodules  \n.pylintrc  \nAUTHORS  \nCHANGELOG.md  \nCMakeLists.txt  \nCONTRIBUTING.md  \nCOPYING  \nChangeLog  \nDEVELOPERS.md  \nDoxyfile.in  \nLICENSE  \nMakefile.am  \nNEWS  \nREADME  \nREADME.md  \nautogen.sh  \nconfig-cmake.h.in  \nconfigure.ac  \ncpl1.0.txt  \ndevelopers  \nepl-v10.html  \nepl-v10.txt  \ngen_version.py  \ngraphviz-centos.repo  \ngraphviz-fedora.repo  \ngraphviz.7  \ngraphviz.sln  \ngraphviz.spec  \ngraphviz_version.h.cmake  \nloadimage_test.sh  \nrequirements.txt  \nrpm_notes.txt  \n  \nREADME.md\n\n# Graphviz - Graph Visualization Tools\n\nfrom AT&T Research and Lucent Bell Labs\n\n  * https://graphviz.org/\n\nSee doc/build.html within the source tree or\nhttps://graphviz.org/doc/build.html for prerequisites and detailed build\nnotes.\n\n## main GIT Repository\n\nThe main GIT Repository for graphviz can be found at:\n\n  * https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/\n\n## Support\n\nGraphviz is maintained by a few very talented volunteers, and with some help\nfrom its founders. Financial donations are accepted on patreon. Anyone who is\nable to fund a summer intern project (or other project) based on graphviz is\ninvited to contact any of the project leaders, e.g. send a message to north on\ngraphviz org).\n\nThis project has only 3 of its founders remaining as volunteer maintainers,\nand support is limited and may end soon. If you can help fund to a more formal\nfoundation to continue this project, please contact north on graphviz org.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe Graphviz documents are currently hosted at https://graphviz.org/\n\n## Graph Visualization ( https://graphviz.org/about/ )\n\nGraph visualization is a way of representing structural information as\ndiagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in\nnetworking, bioinformatics, software engineering, database and web design,\nmachine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains.\n\nGraphviz is open source graph visualization software. It has several main\nlayout programs. See the gallery for sample layouts. It also has web and\ninteractive graphical interfaces, and auxiliary tools, libraries, and language\nbindings. We're not able to put a lot of work into GUI editors but there are\nquite a few external projects and even commercial tools that incorporate\nGraphviz. You can find some of these in the Resources section.\n\nThe Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text\nlanguage, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web\npages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an\ninteractive graph browser.\n\nGraphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for\ncolors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom\nshapes.\n\nIn practice, graphs are usually generated from an external data sources, but\nthey can also be created and edited manually, either as raw text files or\nwithin a graphical editor. (Graphviz was not intended to be a Visio\nreplacement, so it is probably frustrating to try to use it that way.)\n\n## Contacts\n\nIf you have a bug or believe something is not working as expected, please\nsubmit a bug report.\n\nIf you have a general question or are unsure how things work, these queries\ncan be posted in the Graphviz Forum.\n\nGraphviz is on twitter and fosstodon.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
