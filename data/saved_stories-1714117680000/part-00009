You can edit and delete your own reviews, improved social\nlinks to generate an image card showing the rating, fixed some bugs.\n\nI also improved the feedback form! Please let me know what you think, good or\nbad, about the site in general! It's extremely helpful, and most people don't\ngive feedback. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nThanks everyone!\n\n###### To-Do List\n\n  * Improve search performance\n  * Collaborative voting lists (so you can pick movies with friends)\n  * Private profiles, for shy guys\n  * Rewrite the little manifesto below and explain the site better.\n  * \"Docket\" where you can easily add stuff to check out (like a watchlist type thing)\n  * Follow other users\n\n###### Previous Updates\n\nApril 25\n\nLight one today. You can edit and delete your own reviews, improved social\nlinks to generate an image card showing the rating, fixed some bugs.\n\nApril 24\n\nBasic lists, improved sign-in. No passwords! Email links or passkeys. You can\nedit your username and email and profile pic. UX cleanup, bug fixes, improved\ndata sources.\n\nApril 23\n\nFixed a bunch of layout stuff, improved data sources for movie and TV cast and\nrew, and a million random things. But mainly, you can rate other ratings! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nApril 22\n\nMostly still cleaning things up (see done list). Gotta do some more of that\ntomorrow, and then hopefully can start on the list feature.\n\nApril 21\n\n\ud83d\udc4b Cool to see people poking around! \ud83d\udc96\n\nMade a horrible version of this a while ago, but had a buch of new ideas so\nI'm working on it for the next few days! Help! It's accidentally 5AM again!\n\nToday, got a bit closer on usability, still fairly barebones and wonky. Added\nphotos, tagging, more metadata. Redesigned a bunch of pages.\n\nPlease leave any feedback you have with the button at the top, even if its\njust a half-formed thought! Everything helps!\n\n###### Recently Done\n\n  * Edit and delete your existing ratings\n  * Passwordless sign-in with magic links\n  * Passkeys\n  * Basic list feature\n  * Passkeys and magic links instead of passwords\n  * Be able to rate other ratings\n  * Make rating flow less cumbersome and nicer looking\n  * Easier way to return to what you were doing after rating\n  * Clean up design of thing page.\n  * Make mobile layout more usable\n\n##### What's the idea?\n\nThere's two: a simpler rating system and the ability to rate anything.\n\nIn most rating systems, there are too many options. And nobody agrees what\nthey mean. Whats the difference between five and four stars? Do you reserve\nfive for perfection? What do the half stars mean? It's a paradox of choice!\n\nSo we have just four: Yes, Yes?, No?, and No.\n\nThink of it like this - do you like the thing? It's yes or no, plus a little\nwiggle room to be wishy-washy. But crucially, there's no middle ground. You've\ngot to pick a side - otherwise why bother reviewing, rating, or reccomending\nsomething? (You can optionally include a text review if you'd like to discuss\nfurther.)\n\nAnd you can rate whatever you want, essentially any piece of media or anything\non Wikipedia. Many sites are dedicated to movies, music, TV, or games, but a\nrating is a rating, let's do it in one place with one system. Maybe you'd also\nlike to rate restaurants, towns, animals, anything. We'll see what people\ngravitate towards. Not everything is available yet, but many things are. I'll\nadd interesting new data sources as people request them.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
