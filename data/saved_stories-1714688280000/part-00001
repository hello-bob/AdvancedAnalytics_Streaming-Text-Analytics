A new study challenges this\nfinding, but also outlines how the telescope might verify the presence of the\nlife-produced gas.\n\nArtist\u2019s concept shows what exoplanet K2-18 b could look like based on science\ndata. (NASA/CSA/ESA/J. Olmsted (STScI))\n\nThe UC Riverside study, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, may be\na disappointment to extraterrestrial enthusiasts but does not rule out the\nnear-future possibility of discovery.\n\nIn 2023 there were tantalizing reports of a biosignature gas in the atmosphere\nof planet K2-18b, which seemed to have several conditions that would make life\npossible.\n\nMany exoplanets, meaning planets orbiting other stars, are not easily\ncomparable to Earth. Their temperatures, atmospheres, and climates make it\nhard to imagine Earth-type life on them.\n\nHowever, K2-18b is a bit different. \u201cThis planet gets almost the same amount\nof solar radiation as Earth. And if atmosphere is removed as a factor, K2-18b\nhas a temperature close to Earth\u2019s, which is also an ideal situation in which\nto find life,\u201d said UCR project scientist and paper author Shang-Min Tsai.\n\nK2-18b\u2019s atmosphere is mainly hydrogen, unlike our nitrogen-based atmosphere.\nBut there was speculation that K2-18b has water oceans, like Earth. That makes\nK2-18b a potentially \u201cHycean\u201d world, which means a combination of a hydrogen\natmosphere and water oceans.\n\nLast year, a Cambridge team revealed methane and carbon dioxide in the\natmosphere of K2-18b using JWST \u2013 other elements that could point to signs of\nlife.\n\nRendering of the likely view on a Hycean world. (AI generated by Shang-Min\nTsai/UCR)\n\n\u201cWhat was icing on the cake, in terms of the search for life, is that last\nyear these researchers reported a tentative detection of dimethyl sulfide, or\nDMS, in the atmosphere of that planet, which is produced by ocean\nphytoplankton on Earth,\u201d Tsai said. DMS is the main source of airborne sulfur\non our planet and may play a role in cloud formation.\n\nBecause the telescope data were inconclusive, the UCR researchers wanted to\nunderstand whether enough DMS could accumulate to detectable levels on K2-18b,\nwhich is about 120 light years away from Earth. As with any planet that far\naway, obtaining physical samples of atmospheric chemicals is impossible.\n\n\u201cThe DMS signal from the Webb telescope was not very strong and only showed up\nin certain ways when analyzing the data,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cWe wanted to know if we\ncould be sure of what seemed like a hint about DMS.\u201d\n\nBased on computer models that account for the physics and chemistry of DMS, as\nwell as the hydrogen-based atmosphere, the researchers found that it is\nunlikely the data show the presence of DMS. \u201cThe signal strongly overlaps with\nmethane, and we think that picking out DMS from methane is beyond this\ninstrument\u2019s capability,\u201d Tsai said.\n\nHowever, the researchers believe it is possible for DMS to accumulate to\ndetectable levels. For that to happen, plankton or some other life form would\nhave to produce 20 times more DMS than is present on Earth.\n\nDetecting life on exoplanets is a daunting task, given their distance from\nEarth. To find DMS, the Webb telescope would need to use an instrument better\nable to detect infrared wavelengths in the atmosphere than the one used last\nyear. Fortunately, the telescope will use such an instrument later this year,\nrevealing definitively whether DMS exists on K2-18b.\n\n\"The best biosignatures on an exoplanet may differ significantly from those we\nfind most abundant on Earth today. On a planet with a hydrogen-rich\natmosphere, we may be more likely to find DMS made by life instead of oxygen\nmade by plants and bacteria as on Earth,\u201d said UCR astrobiologist Eddie\nSchwieterman, a senior author of the study.\n\nGiven the complexities of searching far-flung planets for signs of life, some\nwonder about the researchers continued motivations.\n\n\u201cWhy do we keep exploring the cosmos for signs of life? Imagine you\u2019re camping\nin Joshua Tree at night, and you hear something. Your instinct is to shine a\nlight to see what\u2019s out there. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing too, in a way,\u201d Tsai\nsaid.\n\nShare this Article\n\nFacebookXLinkedInEmailPrintFriendly\n\nTags\n\nCollege Of Natural And Agricultural Sciences\n\nDepartment of Earth and Planetary Sciences\n\nRSS Feeds\n\nCollege of Natural and Agricultural Sciences\n\nScience / Technology\n\n### Related Articles\n\nScience / Technology\n\n### Study reveals cancer vulnerabilities in popular dog breeds\n\nScience / Technology\n\n### Federal grant to advance brain stroke research\n\nScience / Technology\n\n### From polluting waste to sportswear\n\nScience / Technology\n\n### To find life in the universe, look to deadly Venus\n\nUniversity of California, Riverside\n\n900 University Ave. Riverside, CA 92521\n\nTel: (951) 827-1012\n\n  * UCR Library\n  * Campus Status\n  * Campus Store\n  * Career Opportunities\n  * Diversity\n  * Maps and Directions\n  * Visit UCR\n\n## University of California, Riverside\n\n900 University Ave. Riverside, CA 92521\n\ntel: (951) 827-0000 email: webmaster@ucr.edu\n\nFind Us\n\nFollow US:\n\nUC Riverside Facebook UC Riverside X/Twitter UC Riverside YouTube UC Riverside\nInstagram UC Riverside TikTok\n\n### Related Links\n\n  * Privacy and Accessibility\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * \u00a9 2024 Regents of the University of California\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\nSearch\n\nThis website uses cookies to enable essential site functionality, improve your\nexperience, and analyze website traffic.
