In the book, he and Greg Lukianoff argued\nthat parents are doing a real disservice to their kids by overprotecting\n(coddling) them, rather than giving them more freedom and allowing them to\nmake mistakes and learn.\n\nThis year, he\u2019s back with a new book, The Anxious Generation, arguing the\nexact opposite in the digital world: that social media and smartphones have\nmade kids under-protected, rewiring brains and increasing teenage depression\nrates.\n\nHaidt tries to address this obvious contradiction in his book with the\nstandard cop-out of the purveyor of every modern moral panic: \u201cThis time it\u2019s\ndifferent!\u201d He provides little evidence to support that.\n\n  * ### \u2018Twitter Files\u2019 Hucksters Cosplaying as Free Speech Martyrs\n\nELON\u2019S JOURNO-LARPERS\n\n#### Mike Masnick\n\nIn this new book, Haidt is coddling the American parent: providing them with a\nclear, simple, and wrong solution to what is ailing their children. But\u2014as\nwith historic moral panics\u2014parents, schools, and politicians will embrace it,\nabsolving themselves of their own failings in raising children in our modern\nworld and pointing to an easy villain.\n\n## You Can Only Massage the Data So Much\n\nUnfortunately for those seeking an easy solution, the data doesn\u2019t support\nHaidt\u2019s conclusions.\n\nOver the last decade, numerous studies on the impact of phones and social\nmedia on children, including a \u201cstudy of studies,\u201d conclude that social media\nis good for some kids, helping them find like-minded individuals. It\u2019s mostly\nneutral for many kids, and problematic for only a very small group (studies\nsuggest less than 10 percent).\n\nCandice Odgers, the author of one of the meta-studies, notes in her review of\nHaidt\u2019s book that the evidence suggests the causality is likely in the other\ndirection.\n\nIt\u2019s not that social media causes mental health problems in that group.\nRather, those struggling with mental issues\u2014and who can\u2019t find help\nelsewhere\u2014often turn to social media to cope. Getting them actual help would\nbe a solution. Cutting off social media, without anything else, could make\ntheir situation worse, rather than better.\n\nReading Haidt\u2019s book, you might think the evidence supports his viewpoint, as\nhe presents a lot of it. The problem is that he\u2019s cherry-picking his evidence\nand often relying on flawed studies. Many other studies by those who have\nstudied this field for many years (unlike Haidt), find little to no support\nfor Haidt\u2019s analysis. The American Psychological Association, which is often\nquick to blame new technologies for harms (it did this with video games),\nadmitted recently that in a review of all the research, social media could not\nbe deemed as \u201cinherently beneficial or harmful to young people.\u201d\n\nTwo recent studies from the Internet Institute at Oxford used access it had\nobtained to huge amounts of data that showed no direct connection between\nscreen time and mental health or social media and mental health. The latter\nstudy there involved data on nearly 1 million people across 72 countries,\ncomparing the introduction of Facebook with widely collected data on mental\nhealth, finding little to support a claim that social media diminishes mental\nhealth.\n\nTo get around this unfortunate situation, Haidt seems to carefully pick which\ndata he uses to support his argument. For example, Haidt mentions the increase\nin depression and suicide among teen girls from 2000 to the present. The\nnumbers started rising around 2010, though they are still relatively low.\n\n  * ### Elon Musk Is in the \u2018Please Clap\u2019 Stage of His Megalomania\n\nLET THAT SINK IN\n\n#### Anthony L. Fisher\n\nWhat\u2019s left out if you start in 2000 is what happened earlier. Prior to 2000,\nthe numbers were on par with what they were today in the late 1980s and early\n1990s, when no social media existed. Across the decades, we see that the late\n\u201990s and early 2000s were a time when depression and suicide rates\nsignificantly dipped from previous highs, before returning recently to similar\nlevels from the \u201980s and \u201990s.\n\nIt\u2019s worth studying why it dropped and then why it went up again, but by\nstarting the data in 2000, Haidt ignores that story, focusing only on the\nincrease, and leading readers to the false conclusion that we are in a unique\nand therefore alarming period that can only be blamed on social media.\n\nHaidt ties this to his earlier beliefs that the lack of outdoor play by kids\nis a problem. He cites psychology professor Peter Gray's research, including\nhis recent meta-study in the Journal of Pediatrics on the decline in\nchildren\u2019s mental well-being. The study concludes that the lack of\nunsupervised play is the leading cause.\n\nHowever, Haidt conspicuously leaves out an important bit of information. In\nthat same paper, Gray and his co-authors conclude that the research does not\nsupport the premise that social media has anything to do with the decline in\nmental health. Gray and his co-authors state, \u201csystematic reviews of research\ninto this have provided little support for the contention that either total\nscreen time or time involved with social media is a major cause of, or even\ncorrelate of, declining mental health.\u201d\n\nApparently, Haidt only cites the parts of Gray\u2019s work that match his thesis,\nand not the parts that don\u2019t.\n\nSimilarly, while some have pointed out many other potential causes to an\nincrease in depression and suicide rates today\u2014pointing to such things as the\nGreat Recession of 2007 to 2009\u2014Haidt often responds by pointing out that the\nrates of depression increased globally, not just in the U.S.\n\nBut that appears to be wrong.\n\nLooking at suicide rates (which are more indicative of actual depression\nrates, rather than self-reported data, given the decreasing stigma associated\nwith admitting to dealing with mental health issues), the numbers show that in\nmany countries it has remained flat or decreased over the past 20 years.\nIndeed, in countries like France, Ireland, Denmark, Spain, and New Zealand,\nyou see a noticeable decline in youth suicide rates.\n\nIf social media were inherently causing an increase in depression, that would\nbe an unlikely result.\n\nIndeed, another research report from Adriana Corredor-Waldron and Janet\nCurrie, notes that even where we see increases in reports of suicide and\ndepression among children in the U.S., we should be cautious, as much of it\nmay be due to changes in both mental health screening and coding practices.\nSpecifically, they note new guidance in the U.S. under the Affordable Care Act\nin 2011 that increased screening of adolescent girls for depression (the rise\nin depression rates for adolescent girls being key to Haidt\u2019s argument), and a\nsecond change in instructing clinicians to record suicidal ideation\ndifferently than in the past.\n\n  * ### NYC Sues Social Media Owners for Teen Mental Health Crisis\n\n\u2018ATTRACT, CAPTURE\u2019\n\n#### Edith Olmsted\n\nThe conclusion of the paper is not that mental health of adolescents has\ngotten any worse, but rather that we\u2019ve now improved screening and diagnostic\npractices to discover it. Coming at a time when the stigma about mental health\nhas declined somewhat, and when people are more willing to discuss mental\nhealth publicly, there are reasons to question Haidt\u2019s reliance on data that\nmight not tell the story he believes.\n\n## Moral Panics Come and Go, But They Never Fix Real Problems\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t make it directly into his latest book, while he was working\non it, Haidt responded to critics of his thesis by citing Pascal\u2019s Wager\u2014that\nit makes more sense to believe in God than not, because the cost of believing\nand being wrong is nothing. But the cost of not believing and being wrong\ncould be eternal damnation.\n\n\u201cHaidt tries to address this obvious contradiction in his book with the\nstandard cop-out of the purveyor of every modern moral panic: \u2018This time it\u2019s\ndifferent!\u2019 He provides little evidence to support that.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Haidt argues that we should keep kids away from social media for\nthe same reason: even if he\u2019s wrong, the \u201ccost\u201d is minimal.\n\nThe scariest part is that the cost of being wrong is not minimal. Indeed, it\nappears to be extremely high.\n\nIf he\u2019s wrong, it means parents, politicians, teachers, and more do not tackle\nthe real root causes of teenage mental health issues.\n\n#### Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\nThe research has shown repeatedly that social media is valuable for many young\npeople, especially those struggling in their local communities and families\n(multiple studies highlight how LGBTQ youth rely heavily on social media in\nvery helpful ways). Taking that lifeline away can be damaging. There are\nnumerous stories of kids who relied on social media to help them out of tricky\nsituations, such as diagnosing a disease where doctors failed to help.\n\nSimilarly, Haidt is no policy expert, and it shows. In the book, he supports\npolicies like the \u201cKids Online Safety Act,\u201d which has been condemned by LGBTQ\ngroups, given that the co-sponsor of the bill has admitted she supports it to\nremove LGBTQ content from the internet. That\u2019s real harm.\n\nHe also comes out in support of \u201cAge Appropriate Design Codes\u201d (AADC), despite\nthe fact that California\u2019s attempt to pass that has been deemed\nunconstitutional, as it would require websites to remove constitutionally\nprotected content.\n\n  * ### School Districts Should Not Be Suing Social Media Companies\n\nSEE YOU IN COURT\n\n#### Mike Masnick\n\nHaidt only acknowledges this turn of events in an endnote, though he\ncompletely misrepresents the legal challenges and why the court ruled as it\ndid. He brushes aside those concerns as simply being about Big Tech not\nwanting to embrace these laws (which is wrong, as they\u2019ve supported most of\nthese laws, knowing it creates barriers to startups and entrenches their\npositions). The reality is that, in practice, AADC laws have been found to\nstifle often important content.\n\nThe Markup recently published a story about schools that attempted to block\nproblematic content such as pornography, cheating, and harmful content for\nkids. But what really happened was they ended up blocking sites that were\nuseful for kids, including the Trevor Project (which provides suicide\nprevention resources and tools directed mainly at LGBTQ youth), Planned\nParenthood, and more.\n\nIndeed, whenever people who don\u2019t spend much time working in these areas (such\nas Haidt) venture into them, they often fail to understand the complexities,\nnuances, and tradeoffs of their proposals. For example, there has been a\nprolonged effort to get social media websites to remove \u201ceating disorder\ncontent.\u201d Both KOSA and AADC laws would likely require as much.\n\nHowever, multiple studies found that removing eating disorder content likely\nresulted in more harm than help, in that users still sought out that content\n(often through alternate keywords) and often found it on even more dangerous\nsites. When such content was allowed on more mainstream sites, it also came\nwith resources and users who tried to guide people towards recovery. When it\nwas suppressed on those sites, users seeking such content often went to places\nthat were much worse, and encouraged dangerous behavior. That is, the removal\nof \u201cdangerous\u201d content, likely created more dangerous outcomes.\n\nThese efforts can lead to real harms.\n\nHaidt also supports age verification, even as it has been mostly declared\nunconstitutional and a huge privacy risk. France\u2019s data protection agency,\nCNIL, reviewed the technology in 2022 and found that there were no options\nthat would adequately protect privacy. In the book, Haidt suggests that\nprivacy risks can be cured by having a third party \u201cverify\u201d someone\u2019s age and\ngiving websites a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d token, thereby inserting an extra layer to\nkeep identity separate from the site someone visits.\n\nThe problem is that this shows a deep lack of understanding of how any of this\nworks. Such a system still creates very real privacy problems.\n\nHow does the third party provider verify ages and not create a huge privacy\ntarget? How do websites authenticate that the person who verified their age\nwith the provider is the person who is visiting their site? Haidt seems\nexcited that age verification providers have their very own trade group, but\nleaves out that the trade group believes the best way to verify ages is to\nmake users take a video of their face to visit a website, which raises all\nsorts of questions about both privacy and the quality of the technology.\n\nIncredibly, given how much Haidt points to data and studies in the first half\nof the book, when he gets to his policy proposals, he presents no studies or\ndata to support the claims that literally any of his solutions would help.\n\n  * ### California\u2019s New Internet Law Is a F*cking Disaster\n\nSO, SO BAD\n\n#### Mike Masnick\n\nHe suggests raising the age at which kids can use certain websites from 13 to\n16. Why 16? Based on his gut. He literally says he \u201cthinks\u201d age 16 \u201cwas the\nright one for the minimum age,\u201d but presents no research or data to explain\nwhy. He notes that at that age they\u2019re mature enough to handle the internet,\nthough he doesn\u2019t explain why.\n\nAnd why suggest limiting access to age 16, rather than teaching kids digital\nliteracy and how to better use the internet to avoid harms? He doesn\u2019t say. He\njust decides what he thinks is right.\n\nYet, we have actual evidence on this already, regarding the age of 13, which\n(as Haidt notes) is built into the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act\n(COPPA). Researcher Danah Boyd studied this years ago, finding that the actual\nresult of the age 13 limit in COPPA was parents teaching kids to lie about\ntheir age, so that they could use these tools to do things like talk to\ngrandparents and friends.\n\nSome of Haidt\u2019s suggestions are so disconnected from any actual research or\ndata as to raise questions about exactly where he\u2019s coming from. There\u2019s an\nentire chapter talking about how the kids these days just need to be more\nspiritual and religious, which seems like an odd and out of place discussion\nin a book about social media (and, on a separate note there is at least some\nresearch suggesting that kids today are finding spirituality via social\nmedia).\n\nWhen even his former co-author, Lukianoff, pointed out that Haidt\u2019s proposals\nclearly violate the First Amendment, Haidt\u2019s only response is to suggest that\nif First Amendment advocates get together, he\u2019s sure they can figure out ways\nto do age verification that is Constitutional.\n\nThis is the classic \u201cnerd harder\u201d demands of a non-expert insisting that if\nactual experts try hard enough, surely they can make the impossible possible.\n\nThe actual harms to getting this wrong could be tremendous. By coddling the\nAmerican parent, and letting them think they can cure what ails kids by simply\nlimiting their internet access, real harm can be caused.\n\nKids who actually do rely on the internet to find community and social\ninteractions could grow further isolated. Even worse, it stops parents and\nteachers from dealing with actual triggers and actual problems, allowing them\nto brush it off as \u201ctoo much TikTok,\u201d rather than whatever real cause might be\nat play. It also stops them from training kids how to use social media safely,\nwhich is an important skill these days.\n\nTreating social media as inherently harmful for all kids (when the data, at\nbest, suggests only a very small percentage struggle with it), also would\nremove a useful and helpful tool from many who can be taught to use it\nproperly, to protect a small number of users who were not taught how to use it\nproperly. Wouldn\u2019t a better solution be to focus on helping everyone to use\nthe tools properly and in an age appropriate manner?\n\n## Meet the New Panic, Same as the Old Panic\n\nEvery generation has its own moral panic. Throughout history everything from\nthe waltz, to chess, to novels, to pinball, to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, to roleplaying\ngames. Each time, someone comes along and tries to support the moral panic\nwith some form of \u201cthis time it\u2019s different.\u201d This time it\u2019s Jonathan Haidt.\n\nHaidt has responded to these claims of him supporting a moral panic by arguing\nthat some moral panics are, in fact, real threats\u2014using examples like teen\nsmoking and drunk driving.\n\nYet, those are examples of literal physical dangers from consumable materials\n(nicotine and alcohol). Social media is not consumed into the body. These\nthings are not comparable. Every single moral panic based on media has later\nproven to be laughably off-base.\n\nAmusingly, Haidt references a different recent moral panic in defending this\nlatest one: video games. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a huge\nmoral panic around video games, until the research caught up and (as with\nsocial media) could find no causal link between video games and negative\nbehavior.\n\n  * ### Online Porn Panic Can\u2019t Overrule the First Amendment\n\nETERNAL VIGILANCE\n\n#### Ari Cohn\n\nHaidt, incredibly, embraces some forms of video game playing (the video games\nhe played, apparently) but complains about the kids these days and their video\ngames, which involve multiplayer setups where they actually interact with\nother players around the world. He notes (without any supporting evidence)\nthat, in the past, kids would get together to play video games, but today they\ndo so \u201calone in their bedrooms.\u201d\n\nWhere is the data to support this? Where is the data to support that kids\nplaying multiplayer video games are somehow having worse outcomes than those\nwho played multiplayer video games two decades ago?\n\nThis sort of problem is found throughout the book. What data Haidt presents is\ncherry-picked and presented only in a manner to prop up his arguments.\nContrary data (of which there is a lot) is ignored. His policy proposals are\nbased on gut feels, not research, and a lack of understanding of the\ncomplexities and tradeoffs inherent in the approaches he supports.\n\nIn the end, neither the data nor reality support his position, and neither\nshould you. Kids and mental health is a very complex issue, and Haidt\u2019s\nsolution appears to be, in the words of H.L. Mencken: clear, simple, and\nwrong.\n\n# Mike Masnick\n\n@mmasnick\n\nGot a tip?
