Not only is it\nstill there but now there's also the ability to easily setup Ubuntu atop an\nOpenZFS encrypted root file-system.\n\nLast year when Ubuntu 23.04 shipped with its new desktop installer it lacked\nthe OpenZFS root file-system support that had been present in earlier releases\nof Ubuntu Linux. With Ubuntu 23.10 the modern installer added back the\nexperimental root ZFS file-system support for new Ubuntu Linux installations.\n\nWith Ubuntu 24.04 LTS releasing later this month, not only is the OpenZFS root\nfile-system (experimental) option still there, but they've also added an\noption to easily setup an encrypted OpenZFS file-system configuration --\nsimilar to the existing EXT4 LVM with encryption option that's long been\noffered on Ubuntu Linux.\n\nIn March was the merge adding the encrypted ZFS option to the Ubuntu desktop\ninstaller.\n\nSo with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is the ability to continue with a standard EXT4 file-\nsystem install, an encrypted file-system using LVM, or using OpenZFS\nwith/without encryption. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS also has the ability to enjoy\nhardware-backed full-disk encryption with TPM as another new experimental\noption. Or, of course, the Ubuntu desktop installer continues supporting\nmanual (custom) partitioning as well.\n\nAside from the OpenZFS encrypted install, the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS desktop\ninstaller also adds new accessibility features and other refinements with this\nbeing the first Long-Term Support release with its modern desktop installer.\n\n40 Comments\n\nTweet\n\nRelated News\n\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS Downloads Now Available\n\nUbuntu 24.04 Beta Now Available For Testing\n\nUbuntu Maker Canonical Announces New Collaboration With Qualcomm\n\nCanonical Announces Ubuntu Pro For Devices\n\nNetplan 1.0 Is Ready To Go For Ubuntu 24.04 LTS\n\nUbuntu 24.04 Beta Delayed Due To XZ Nightmare\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
