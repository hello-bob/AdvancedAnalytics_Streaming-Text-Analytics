This joint development of the Lunar Excursion\nVehicle 2 (LEV-2) was named \"SORA-Q,\" for the Small Lunar Landing Demonstrator\n(SLIM).\n\nOn January 20, 2024, both LEV-2 and LEV-1 were released onto the lunar surface\njust before SLIM's landing. LEV-2, operating autonomously, captured images of\nSLIM and its surroundings and transmitted them to Earth using LEV-1's\ncommunication device, resulting in an effective collaboration between these\nthree integral components.\n\nDespite its initial spherical form, LEV-2 successfully deformed, deployed, and\nnavigated on the lunar surface. Utilizing an image processing algorithm, LEV-2\nselected high-quality images within SLIM's field of view and transmitted them.\n\nThe collaborative effort involved the National Research and Development Agency\nJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Takara Tomy Corporation, Doshisha\nUniversity, and the incorporation of NuttX in the SPRESENSE TM board by Sony\nGroup Corporation, showcasing the robust real-time capabilities essential for\nthe success of the mission.\n\nAs Apache NuttX makes its mark on the moon, this cosmic success not only marks\na huge technological achievement but also shows the potential of open-source\ninnovation in space. Ongoing data analysis, including driving logs, holds the\npromise of revealing further insights, with results anticipated for future\npublication.\n\nRead more:\n\n  * JAXA official press release\n  * SONY's official press release\n  * Apache on NuttX on Spresense\n\napache-nuttx\n\napache-nuttx-rtos-on-spresense\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Sony Group Corporation.
