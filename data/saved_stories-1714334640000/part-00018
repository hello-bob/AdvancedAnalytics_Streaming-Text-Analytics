This synapse works with water and salt and provides the\nfirst evidence that a system using the same medium as our brains can process\ncomplex information. The results appeared today in the scientific journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nBelow shows a graphical representation of the synapse. The synapse consists of\ncolloidal spheres with nano-channels between them.\n\nIn the pursuit of enhancing the energy efficiency of conventional computers,\nscientists have long turned to the human brain for inspiration. They aim to\nemulate its extraordinary capacity in various ways. These efforts have led to\nthe development of brain-like computers, which diverge from traditional binary\nprocessing to embrace analogue methods akin to our brains. However, while our\nbrains operate using water and dissolved salt particles called ions as their\nmedium, most current brain-inspired computers rely on conventional solid\nmaterials. This raises the question: could we not achieve a more faithful\nreplication of the brain's workings by adopting the same medium? This\nintriguing possibility lies at the heart of the burgeoning field of iontronic\nneuromorphic computing.\n\n## Artificial synapse\n\nIn the latest study published in PNAS, scientists have, for the very first\ntime, demonstrated a system reliant on water and salt exhibiting the ability\nto process intricate information, mirroring the functionality of our brains.\nCentral to this discovery is a minute device measuring 150 by 200 micrometres,\nwhich mimics the behaviour of a synapse\u2014an essential component in the brain\nresponsible for transmitting signals between neurons.\n\nTim Kamsma, a PhD candidate at the Institute for Theoretical Physics and the\nMathematical Institute of Utrecht University, and the lead author of the\nstudy, expresses his excitement, stating, \"While artificial synapses capable\nof processing complex information already exist based on solid materials, we\nnow show for the first time that this feat can also be accomplished using\nwater and salt.\" He emphasizes, \"We are effectively replicating neuronal\nbehaviour using a system that employs the same medium as the brain.\"\n\n> Perhaps this will pave the way for computing systems that replicate the\n> extraordinary capabilities of the human brain more faithfully\n>\n> Tim Kamsma, PhD candidate and lead author\n\n## Ion migration\n\nThe device, developed by scientists in Korea and referred to as an iontronic\nmemristor, comprises a cone-shaped microchannel filled with a solution of\nwater and salt. Upon receiving electrical impulses, ions within the liquid\nmigrate through the channel, leading to alterations in ion concentration.\nDepending on the intensity (or duration) of the impulse, the conductivity of\nthe channel adjusts accordingly, mirroring the strengthening or weakening of\nconnections between neurons. The extent of change in conductance serves as a\nmeasurable representation of the input signal.\n\nAn additional finding is that the length of the channel impacts the duration\nrequired for concentration changes to dissipate. \"This suggests the\npossibility of tailoring channels to retain and process information for\nvarying durations, again akin to the synaptic mechanisms observed in our\nbrains,\" elaborates Kamsma.\n\nMicroscopic picture of the artificial synapse\n\n## Wow!\n\nThe genesis of this discovery can be traced back to an idea conceived by\nKamsma, who began his doctoral research not long ago. He transformed this\nconcept\u2014centred around the utilization of artificial ion channels for\nclassification tasks\u2014into a robust theoretical model. \"Coincidently, our paths\ncrossed with the research group in South Korea during that period,\" recalls\nKamsma. \"They embraced my theory with great enthusiasm and swiftly initiated\nexperimental work based on it.\" Remarkably, the initial findings materialized\njust three months later, closely aligning with the predictions outlined in\nKamsma's theoretical framework. \"I thought wow!\u201d he reflects. \"It's incredibly\ngratifying to witness the transition from theoretical conjecture to tangible\nreal world outcomes, ultimately resulting in these beautiful experimental\nresults.\"\n\n## A significant step forward\n\nKamsma underscores the fundamental nature of the research, highlighting that\niontronic neuromorphic computing, while experiencing rapid growth, is still in\nits infancy. The envisioned outcome is a computer system vastly superior in\nefficiency and energy consumption compared to present-day technology. However,\nwhether this vision will materialize remains speculative at this juncture.\nNevertheless, Kamsma views the publication as a significant step forward. \"It\nrepresents a crucial advancement toward computers not only capable of\nmimicking the communication patterns of the human brain but also utilizing the\nsame medium,\" he asserts. \"Perhaps this will ultimately pave the way for\ncomputing systems that replicate the extraordinary capabilities of the human\nbrain more faithfully\"\n\nTim Kamsma's doctoral research receives funding from Utrecht University's\nScience for Sustainability community. Through its doctoral programme, the\ncommunity fosters interdisciplinary, fundamental research in sustainability.\n\n## Share\n\n  * Share on X\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Share on Facebook\n\n## Contact\n\n### Follow UU\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n  * Youtube\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Instagram\n\nUtrecht University Heidelberglaan 8 3584 CS Utrecht The Netherlands Tel. +31\n(0)30 253 35 50\n\n", "frontpage": false}
