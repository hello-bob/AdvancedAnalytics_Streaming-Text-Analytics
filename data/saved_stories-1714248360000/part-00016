(900+\ncomments, plus Melody\u2019s romance syllabus) and What Are You *Not* Buying (On\nthe Internet) which went in many, MANY unexpected (but useful!) directions.\n\nDorothea Lange always got it. Abandoned farmhouse in Childress County, Texas,\nc. 1938\n\nTwo people meet at some point in their 20s, fall in love, and for some reason\n\u2014 a job, a grad school opportunity, whatever \u2014 decide to move to a place where\nthey know very few people. Maybe they make some friends immediately, but more\nlikely: they don\u2019t. Maybe they already have a kid, maybe they start trying to\nhave one (or a second) shortly after they move. They\u2019re relatively early in\ntheir careers and spending a lot of time trying to advance them, so have very\nlittle energy to allocate to cultivating friendships that aren\u2019t ready-made,\ne.g., a school cohort or friends at work.\n\nThose friendships are nice but somewhat shallow, in part because these people\nspend most of their spare time with their partner, or working, or parenting.\nIt\u2019s hard to get a sitter and you don\u2019t feel super comfortable just lugging\nyour kid to other people\u2019s spaces. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t get out of the\nhouse; it\u2019s just that when you do, it\u2019s usually with your partner and kids.\nMeanwhile, maybe a parent\u2019s health is deteriorating and you\u2019re struggling to\nnavigate care for them across the country. Or maybe you moved closer to your\nparents to relieve your overwhelming childcare needs....but now you realize\nyour parents are your primary points of adult contact.\n\nOne day you wake up and realize you\u2019re deep in the friendship dip. You\u2019re\nmoderately stable in your job and housing. You\u2019ve kinda figured out your\npartnership and/or parenting. You\u2019re decently versed in local issues and a\nmember of the neighborhood Facebook group and/or have exchanged numbers with a\nfew neighbors or know the name of several dogs on your street. You have a\nlovely text threads with friends from your childhood or your 20s that pop off\nevery few days.\n\nBut let\u2019s be real: it\u2019s just not enough. When you let yourself think about it,\nyou feel incredibly isolated. Periodically the thought surfaces, unwanted and\nunbidden: I\u2019ve been here [this many years] and still haven\u2019t made a real\nfriend.\n\nI\u2019ve felt this sort of quiet-frustration-bordering-on-desperation before. It\u2019s\nat the heart of Friend Group, the book I\u2019m currently researching and writing.\nUnlike the dozens of books that focus on how to make friends as an adult, I\u2019m\ntrying to take a larger step back and think about the structures we\u2019ve created\nthat make it so hard to follow those books\u2019 (usually pretty decent) advice.\n\nSome of the difficulty has to do with infrastructure: car culture makes it\nreally hard to just hang out. Some of it has to do with mobility: more\nspecifically, the way educated Americans are more likely to move away from the\nplaces where they have networks of support in pursuit of job and life\nopportunities. Some of it has to do with the way work has cannibalized our\ntime and made \u201changing out\u201d seem like a failure of optimization.\n\nBut a whole lot of this ethos stems from a deep-seated belief in\nindividualism. We think that just because we can \u201cdo it ourselves\u201d (and by\n\u201cit,\u201d I mean raising kids, performing domestic labor, caring for others,\nfinding economic security, living life) that we should do it ourselves....and\nour ability to do so evinces innate moral fortitude. We\u2019re better people, in\nother words, because we did it alone.\n\nYou can read that and understand it as bullshit and simultaneously internalize\nand abide by that line of thinking. That\u2019s the bitch of ideology. To start\ndismantling it, we have to learn to recognize its various shapes. Because this\nisn\u2019t just about finding deep and meaningful friendship in your 30s and 40s,\nor even making parenting slightly less miserable, although both of those are\nnoble and worthy causes. The myth of individualism is at the very heart of\nAmerican inequality \u2014 social, racial, and financial. But to understand why,\nyou have to go back: not to the founding of the country, as many assume, but\nto the presidency of Andrew Jackson.\n\nThat\u2019s what political historian Alex Zakaras argues in his stunning (and\naccessible) book, The Roots of American Individualism: Political Myth in the\nAge of Jackson. I\u2019m so accustomed to our current broken democratic system that\nI forget we used to have a differently broken one, with much more power\nconsolidated around wealthy landowners. (To be fair, wealthy landowners still\ncontrol our current system, we just pretend that \u201callowing\u201d most people to\nvote negates it). Back in the late 18th century, these elites were terrified\nof the word democracy: they hated monarchy, but they also didn\u2019t think the\nfuture of the country should be handed to the general (white, male) public.\n\nThe Jacksonian Democrats, by contrast, were Big Democracy Boosters \u2014 with\nsignificant limits. They believed all white male citizens should have power\nwithin the government. They thought judges should be elected not appointed\n(and elected every few years, to prevent corruption). They believed all white\nmen, regardless of background, should have the right to flourish.\n\nThey also believed strongly in Manifest Destiny \u2014 the idea that white men have\nthe right, the God-given destiny, to colonize what they understood as\n\u201cuninhabited\u201d (read: inhabited by Indigenous people) land, and that the\ncapitalist economy should be allowed to figure itself out (survival of the\nfittest!) with very little intervention. Within this framework, slavery (at\nleast in the South) was understood as a necessity to ensure the spread of\nwhite men\u2019s financial opportunity.\n\nZakaras organizes this thinking into three separate but overlapping myths,\neach with its own protagonist: the independent proprietor (the small\nbusinessman, the small farmer, etc.); the rights-bearer (the man fleeing the\nconstrictive tyranny of the \u2018Old World\u2019 to enjoy the freedoms of religion,\nexpression, arms-bearing, etc., that define the \u2018New World\u2019); and the self-\nmade man (who thrives through hard work in a society free of insurmountable\nclass hierarchies).\n\nAn illustration of a homesteading farmer shooting a bear up in a tree in\nRochester New York c. 1812 (via Getty)\n\nThese myths were present in the late 1700s, but they didn\u2019t become as useful\nor prominent until the early 1800s when, Zakaras argues, they began to\ntransform to accommodate a new generation of Americans who hadn\u2019t lived\nthrough the Revolutionary War. They also collided with easy access to credit,\nthe continued expansion of American territories, the arrival of new European\nimmigrants, renewed religious (and specifically evangelical) fervor, physical\nand class mobility, and the need to continually refine the justification for\nboth slavery and the ongoing displacement and genocide of Native peoples.\n\nHow do you weave all of those things together under the banner of liberty and\ndemocracy? How do you balance pledges of equality with the reality of slavery\n(and the lack of suffrage for women)? You need a BIG, COMPLICATED, ENDURING\nmyth. A foundational myth \u2014 one that can both \u201cmake sense of political events\nand experiences,\u201d as Zakaras puts it, and \u201cconstruct a glorified image of a\nnational people and present it as a worthy object of devotion and sacrifice,\u201d\nrecounting \u201ca story of national origins that illustrates its people\u2019s basic\nvalues or character traits.\u201d\n\nYou need something that convinces Americans with access to power that the way\nthey\u2019re doing things is not just different, but undeniably superior. You need\na myth like individualism.\n\nIn the early 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville embarked from France to the United\nStates, tasked with observing the prison system. He sorta did that, but mostly\nhe just traveled around, observing a nation very much in flux \u2014 and deeply\nimbued with individualism.\n\nAs Tocqueville put it in Democracy in America, Book 2:\n\n> Individualism is a novel expression, to which a novel idea has given birth.\n> Our fathers were only acquainted with egotism. Egotism is a passionate and\n> exaggerated love of self, which leads a man to connect everything with his\n> own person, and to prefer himself to everything in the world. Individualism\n> is a mature and calm feeling, which disposes each member of the community to\n> sever himself from the mass of his fellow-creatures; and to draw apart with\n> his family and his friends; so that, after he has thus formed a little\n> circle of his own, he willingly leaves society at large to itself. Egotism\n> originates in blind instinct: individualism proceeds from erroneous judgment\n> more than from depraved feelings; it originates as much in the deficiencies\n> of the mind as in the perversity of the heart. Egotism blights the germ of\n> all virtue; individualism, at first, only saps the virtues of public life;\n> but, in the long run, it attacks and destroys all others, and is at length\n> absorbed in downright egotism.\n\nWhat Tocqueville describes is a pretty classically American me & mine\nphilosophy: the state is useful in its ability to create conditions that\nfacilitate your personal economic growth and stability (see: legalized\nslavery; the Homestead Act; the use of the American military to eradicate\nNative populations; the postal service to facilitate communication and\ncommerce).\n\nOnce that growth and stability is achieved, you become disinterested (or\noutright hostile) when it comes to offering that sort of stability to others,\nparticularly if they are of a class of people you believe inferior or as\npotentially infringing upon your liberty. (See: animosity toward so-called\n\u201cgovernment handouts\u201d that primarily benefit women and people of color paired\nwith outrage over cuts in programs that make their stability possible, like\nfarm subsidies, incredibly low-cost grazing on federal lands, tax cuts on the\nrich, low estate taxes, mortgage deductions, the list goes on).\n\nTocqueville saw \u201cfree\u201d public institutions \u2014 most notably roads and other\nforms of infrastructure \u2014 as a partial antidote to the worst effects of\nindividualism. A road physically connects you to others; massive\ninfrastructure projects that make life markedly smoother are only possible by\npooling funds through the collection of taxes. It was, at least in theory, a\nform of ideological d\u00e9tente: let people have their freedoms and their dreams\nof autonomy, but keep them tethered to one another through shared need, which\ncould also include things like military defense, access to clean water,\nlibraries, public education, etc.\n\nBut what happens when those shared needs come to be understood as givens? When\nongoing privatization allows the illusion of total autonomy to flourish? Well,\nyou get a significant percentage of the current population of my home state of\nIdaho, amongst other places. We\u2019ve reached what Tocqueville described:\ndownright egotism. It\u2019s the ideological wall I find impossible to scale: I\ndon\u2019t know how to make you care about other people.\n\nThe persistence of slavery had always challenged the ideals of Jacksonian\nDemocracy. But by 1854, with the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the\ncenter simply could not hold. The act\u2019s intention was straightforward: turn\npart of the Louisiana Purchase into official territories, thereby making them\neasier to settle \u2014 and easier for the Trans-Continental Railroad to, well,\ntraverse. But creating those territories negated the Missouri Compromise,\nwhich had temporarily kept the warring factions of abolitionists and slave\nowners at bay. The new territories soon became free-for-alls for interests\nattempting to sway the eventual votes to legalize (or ban) slavery.\n\nHistorians have teased out much more complicated thoughts on this era, but I\nrecognize it as one of those moments when white people had a well-worn story\nof why things had to be the way they were \u2014 and then, when it became clear\nthat the story was indefensible, they just built the story into something\nbigger and bolder.\n\nAnd so, in the years to come, they embroidered and retconned the specifics of\nthe individualist myth to accommodate emerging realities and conflicts: the\nextent of the Native genocide, the place of non-white immigrants in the\nhierarchy, the deracialization of Irish and Italian immigrants, the horror of\nthe Holocaust, the ongoing horror of lynchings, and the utterly nonsensical\nrationales at the heart of Trickle-Down Economics. (I could go on. For several\nparagraphs.)\n\nFor those weaving and receptive to this narrative, it did not matter how\nconvoluted the story became (see especially: The Lost Cause of Confederacy;\nthe persistence of the \u201csavage\u201d in Westerns; Holocaust denial; All Lives\nMatter). What mattered is you could still claim the overarching narrative as\ntrue \u2014 and thus preserve an understanding of self, of nation, of deservedness\nand superiority.\n\nA real exercise in historical retconning on display in this Lost Cause poem\n\nWhite men established their vision of the ideal American ethos \u2014 the urge\ntowards self-determination, access to class mobility, the maxims of personal\nresponsibility, exercising dominion over the land, even land ownership itself\nas a hallmark of success \u2014 when they were the only ones with access to it.\nCrucially, much of that access, particularly in the Jacksonian period, was\npredicated on stealing land from Indigenous people and the enslavement of\nBlack Americans.\n\nAnd yet, eventually, that \u201cfree\u201d land ran out \u2014 or at least dwindled. Over the\nnext century, the vote expanded to women and people of color, and so too did\n(theoretical) access to credit, to wealth, to power. But the white men already\nin power took others\u2019 failure to achieve as evidence of a lack of will and\ngrit \u2014 and proof they weren\u2019t \u201creal\u201d Americans. It\u2019s as if they started a game\nof Monopoly hours before everyone else, bought up everything save two\nproperties, and then invited the rest of the people to join \u2014 and swiftly\nblamed and shamed them for losing.\n\nWithin this framework, new immigrants can only \u201cbecome\u201d American when they\nachieve like white men. Women\u2019s lagging achievement rates when it comes to\npositions of power and wealth aren\u2019t the result of deeply engrained wage gaps,\nsexist policy, lack of parental care leave, lack of childcare access, and the\npaltry value placed on care work \u2014 they\u2019re just not cut out for success. The\nracial wealth gap isn\u2019t related to the legacy of slavery and red-lining, it\u2019s\nbecause Black people are lazy and overly dependent on government assistance.1\n\nFor such a well-polished myth, individualism (at least in this moment) feels\nclunky and ham-fisted. It\u2019s so clearly at cross-purposes with what so many\npeople crave! Articulate its tenets in conversation or debate and you come off\nlike a total asshole! It\u2019s at the heart of our most cruel and exacting policy\nstances, from the lack of mandatory paid parental leave to the handling of\nstudent loan debt. But it also animates incredibly banal shifts in the funding\nof public infrastructure, transportation, and the arts. It\u2019s why so many of us\nstill feel the need to do things on our own \u2014 or under the illusion that we\u2019re\ndoing them on our own. It makes it so easy to judge others according to that\nsame logic.\n\nIndividualism is bullshit! And yet, it endures: in large part because it was\nbuilt on the foundation of white supremacy \u2014 of white people having the most\npower and control. And as long as you believe that we live in a nation where\nopportunity is equally available to all, you can justify the racial wealth\ngap, the rates of incarceration, racial discrepancies in health care, and\nmaternal mortality rates. The myth of individualism makes those utterly\nnonsensical stats make sense.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the hard part. You can\u2019t just decide fuck individualism, I\u2019m\nblowing it up. You have to replace it with a better, more equitable story of\nwho we are as a country and how we organize our society. Which, for a lot of\npeople, would mean giving up a modicum of power. Liberal white people can\nloathe the effects of individualism and still benefit enough from their\nplacement within the racial hierarchy to not dismantle it altogether. Other\npeople with more privilege in the established hierarchy (because of when or\nhow they came to this country, because of their class status, because of their\nrace) can dislike white supremacy in general but still benefit from the status\nquo it structures.\n\nMillions of people \u2014 and white people in particular \u2014 would rather endure\nphysical isolation, generalized loneliness, caregiving exhaustion, and\nfinancial precarity than relinquish some of their societal power. That\u2019s a far\nless optimistic foundational myth than individualism. But it\u2019s a far more\nhonest one. \u25cf\n\nFor those who live in the U.S.: How do you see individualism manifest in your\nworld? How have you or your family rejected or quietly embraced its core\nideologies? If you don\u2019t live in the U.S., how does your nation think of\nindividualism \u2014 and what other founding myths are at work instead or\nalongside?\n\nIf you value this work, if it made you think \u2014 consider subscribing:\n\nSubscribing gives you access to the weekly discussion threads, which are so\nweirdly addictive, moving, and soothing.

Unlike other countries where class status was more entrenched,\nwhite people internalized the idea that they should align themselves not with\nother members of the working class, doing different types of low-wage and\noften exploited work across the nation, but with the class they aspired to\nenter. Politicians both then and now exploited race-based prejudices and fears\n(then: miscegenation; now: crime and drugs) to inoculate against the potential\nclass-based affinity.\n\n### Subscribe to Culture Study\n\nBy Anne Helen Petersen\n\nThink more about the culture that surrounds you\n\n561 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n73 Restacks\n\n561\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Dark Heart of Individualism\n\nannehelen.substack.com\n\n237\n\nShare\n\n237 Comments\n\nMelissa CullensOn PurposeMar 20Liked by Anne Helen PetersenDAMN this was a\ngood one.So another place I think you might poke around and find this myth:\nthe debate between childfree people and people with children.I was on\nInstagram (I know, that's a me problem) the other day and a creator I usually\nlove posted a meme about how parents get to just go home early whenever\nbecause \"kids\" and the comment section was FROTHING. The usual stuff \u2014 parents\ndoing the Rodney Dangerfield dance about how they get no respect (we don't!)\nor systemic support (also we don't!) and that American culture generally seems\ninvested in making more babies and then screwing the people who need to raise\nthem (also true!)The child-free folks argued that it wasn't their job to pick\nup the slack because little Timmy has a tummy ache (fair!) and that having a\nkid is the only vaguely acceptable reason for needing to leave the office\nunexpectedly (also true!). But then it got mean.\"No one made you have a kid \u2014\nthat's your problem.\" \u2014 people mad at parents for having kidsI see this a lot\n(mostly with younger single folks) on the internet \u2014 the feeling that someone\nelse having a child is an imposition on their comfort, and I think it has\neverything to do with the kind of frankensteining of Individualism and the\nCult of Convenience that our phones and 2-day shipping has brought us. This\nvibe of \"we have to share this planet but we don't have to like it \u2014 you clean\nup your own mess and I'll clean up mine.\" (I 100% used to be this person, and\nthen I had a kid! Sorry to the moms and dads who I disregarded in my\nyouth!)There was a great On Being episode recently where Sarah Hendren talks\nabout disability as this anti-american idea, like self-reliance is the most\nimportant personal value you can hold, even though every single one of us will\nat some point be dependent on someone else \u2014 even if just for a few days when\nwe have the flu. She points out the ableist nature of this ideology, but also\nthe incredible beauty of dependence. The humility it gives us. To know that we\ncan't always take care of ourselves is a gift.
