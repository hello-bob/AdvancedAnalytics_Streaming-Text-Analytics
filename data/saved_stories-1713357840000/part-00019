Both areas have\nfertile soil for new ideas in cryptography, and so the blockchain world\nremains in my periphery. As much as I avoid the topic, I can't avoid people in\nmy field who work on it.\n\nA mild silver lining of that reality is that most of the people I interact\nwith who work in blockchain appear to be in it for the math, and put up with\nthe blockchain parts for funding. To be clear, that crosses an ethical line\nfor me personally\u2014and I've been thinking a lot about how to express my\nthoughts about this that is both meaningfully persuasive and intellectually\nhonest in the essay that will close Practical Math for Programmers. But\nshaming them about not meeting my ethical standards also doesn't feel\nproductive.\n\nAnd occasionally, I find people who have a similar persuasion to me, and in an\nappropriately private setting we sometimes discuss how one might frame the\nproblems of Bitcoin and blockchain to the non-cryptographers in their lives\nwho have bought into the hype\u2014and for whom recent events have not convinced\nthem otherwise.\n\nThere are some basic empirical contradictions. Bitcoin can't replace cash as a\nmedium of exchange because there are so few legal things you can actually do\nwith it besides speculate on its price. It's a poor store of value because of\nits wild price fluctuations. It's so expensive and slow to confirm\ntransactions that actually processing a decent fraction of daily purchasing\nvolume on the blockchain would grind consumer finance to a halt. Bitcoin\nmining rapidly centralized, defeating its purpose and threatening its security\nmodel. Bitcoin has also turned out to be highly non-private, rife with scams,\npolitically slow to adapt, and a massive energy hog. But proponents counter\n(at least with consistency) that a future world in which decentralized\ncurrency succeeds would somehow magically fix all these problems, and\nshouldn't we all be dreaming for a better system than the one we currently\nhave?\n\nI don't think anything besides getting bankrupt will convince a \"number go up\"\ncryptocurrency enthusiast to act differently, and so technical or\nobservational arguments above will be ignored as long as the roller coaster\ncontinues to provide thrills. But an appeal to values might persuade those who\nunderstand the high-level criticisms, but still think cryptocurrency will make\nthe world a better place. These people mistrust governments, especially the\nUnited States government, and for good reason. They would prefer a world in\nwhich individuals had more control over their own destinies, whether that\nmeans freedom of movement, freedom to seek economic prosperity, freedom from\nrent-seeking, \"trust-free\" transactions, etc. Often this boils down to\nspecific ways they felt they've been wronged by particular laws and\nregulations\u2014some more extreme than others\u2014or else it is driven by a fuzzier\nsort of attraction to an idealized proto-American individualist lifestyle in\nwhich people can invent and innovate unencumbered. (Pro tip: a history lesson\nhere does not seem to help.)\n\nTo these people I would say: if it succeeded, cryptocurrency would represent a\ntransfer of power. Specifically, it would transfer power to technologically\nsavvy people and away from everyone else. So if you dream of a world with\ncryptocurrency replacing fiat currency, you need to ask yourself whether you\nhave the technical skills required to understand and use cryptocurrency\nsafely, and the time required to exercise those skills in your day to day\nlife.\n\nLet's make it more concrete. In traditional consumer finance today, you spend\nsome basic amount of time trying to determine if some sunglasses you're buying\nonline are counterfeit or a scam (thanks, Amazon). But this is mostly to avoid\nthe hassle. You can get a refund but it takes effort to do so, and then you\nstill have to find another pair of sunglasses to buy. You don't particularly\nworry that by buying these sunglasses, attackers will drain your bank account,\nbecause the banks provide protections and credit cards make chargebacks\nrelatively easy for consumers.\n\nIn a world where everything happens on the blockchain, where the wild west is\nreality, all of the work of vetting the source falls on each individual\nconsumer. In the worst case, you have to read the code of a smart contract,\nand hope that someone else doesn't find a security flaw you didn't spot. If\nyou have the time and ability to do that, then you're probably going to be\nsafe. You won't lose your wallet's private keys, you won't fall for scams, and\nyou'll reap the benefit of a regulation-free economy. Everyone else will just\nhave to shift their trust to some other person or institution that has these\nskills.\n\nMy father, for example, asked me in 2018 or so to buy him some Ethereum. I am\nwell aware of the joy he takes in stock trading and his \"number go up\"\nmentality, so I said no, not if he's going to get into the habit of short-term\nprice speculation. Then he tried to convince me of two things. First, that he\nreally, truly believed in the technical merit of the platform and its long-\nterm prospects for society. He was apparently an avid reader of Ethereum news\n(god only knows what blogs he was reading). Second, he promised me that he\nwould not touch the money for 15 years. I didn't believe him, but thankfully I\nhave enough technical knowledge, so I said, \"only if we do it my way.\" My way\nwas to buy the ETH on Coinbase, send it to a wallet not managed by Coinbase,\nwrite the wallet's secret key on a piece of paper, delete the key from my\ncomputer, and put it in my parents' lock box in a small-town bank branch that\nhappened to be far away from where they lived at the time. It was effectively\nimpossible for my father to access this money, because, while he physically\nhad access to the secret key, he would have never been able to restore the\nwallet without me or someone like me who knew how to get it back into\nCoinbase. This would force him to hold to his \"15 year\" promise. ^1\n\nEven if I hasn't gone to such extreme measures to try to keep him honest\u2014and\nto try to keep him from margin trading or getting scammed\u2014it was clear that he\nneeded me to achieve his goals in this new world. My ability to make the\ntransactions safely for him, and even my hypothetical willingness to teach him\nhow to do it on his own, was an embodiment of that power transfer.\n\nThe story ended much earlier than 15 years. About a year later, my father\nconvinced me to take the ETH out of cold storage so he could cash out\ncompletely. His reason was stated as his impatience with the rate of progress\nof the promised features of Ethereum, and a loss of confidence in the project.\nIn a way I didn't understand, that was somehow tied to the price of ETH, which\nI guess he expected to rise with every new feature. I relented, I cashed him\nout, and then a few things happened. First, he made a small profit. Second, he\nwas irate with the fees Coinbase charged to take USD off the platform. He\ncalled it a \"scam\", but I'm just happy that was the worst of what he\nexperienced. Third, their taxes were a huge headache that year. And finally,\nthe price of Ethereum grew to be much higher.\n\nThe \"number go up\" folks will say, \"See?\" but this isn't for them. That post-\ncashout experience underscores my point: he thought he was well-versed in the\ntechnical merit of Ethereum, and how those technical details related to its\nprice\u2014or at least its worthiness of investment. But he was wrong. Based on\nsome small clues he inadvertently let slip, I suspect what happened was that\nhe was swayed by other new cryptocurrency projects he was reading about that\nwere inspired by Ethereum and able to move faster, and he was planning to\npivot to reinvest his proceeds in Monero or whatever, but then the huge\nexchange fees were so distasteful that he felt standard stock trading would\ncut in less to his profits.^2 So he just happened to be wrong in enough ways\nto cancel out and at least get his money back, if not his time, with a small,\nlucky profit.\n\nFor all that my dad lacks in cryptocurrency knowledge, he is still quite smart\nand technically minded. Over his career he designed and built planes,\nfactories, and medical devices used in optometrists' offices and veterinary\nsciences. I'm sure he has the skills required to learn how to use\ncryptocurrency safely if he had the time necessary to understand the technical\naspects. But he doesn't. And what does that say for the rest of the\npopulation? Working mothers, teenagers, bus drivers, and all the people who\ndon't care about the technology and just want to buy their pizza or watch a\nmovie. If they use digital currency, they will simply be transferring their\ntrust from a government-backed bank to a service provider with shakier safety\nmeasures. And who will be running those service-providers? We nerds who\nactually understand the technical parts. Maybe some people out there still\nthink our current tech moguls like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos are blessed\ninnovators and the best hope for society's progress is to give then more power\nover our personal lives. Maybe they'd be happy to trust them to control all of\nsociety's money, while only the nerds can opt out to manage their own wallets.\nBut for most people, framing cryptocurrency as a choice between letting well-\nregulated, government-insured banks manage our money and letting the next Jeff\nBezos do what he wants with it, should make the best choice obvious.\n\nI have more to say about how this framing\u2014technology as power transfer\u2014relates\nto other tech trends like LLMs, but I could not fit my thoughts in the\nmargins. Next time.\n\nIn cast you missed it: April Cools was last week and a handful of us bloggers\nwrote earnestly about something they don't normally write about. Mine was\nparenting. Maybe join us next year?\n\n  1. In fact, he was so nervous about actually committing to buying the ETH that he made me click the \"buy\" button on Coinbase for him. \u21a9\n\n  2. Since then he has made a small fortune investing in Tesla, and fawns over Elon Musk far more often than I would like. \u21a9\n\nDon't miss what's next.
