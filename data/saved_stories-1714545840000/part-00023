He had worked at the NSA as an information systems\nsecurity designer for just under a month from June to July 2022, making quick\nwork of the short period by accumulating top secret documents with national\ndefense information (NDI).\n\nBetween August and September that year, shortly after leaving the NSA, Dalke\nmade contact with a person he thought was a Russian agent. To prove his\n\"legitimate access and willingness to share,\" he then emailed the apparent spy\nsnippets of three top secret, classified documents with NDI. Dalke then said\nhe'd be willing to sell the full documents and more for just $85k.\n\nOnly there was one problem: he was talking to an undercover FBI agent.\n\nDalke and the FBI agent then arranged a time and place to hand over the\ndocuments. On September 28, the former NSA worker took his laptop to Union\nStation in Denver and sent the documents to the FBI agent over the internet.\nDalke also included a letter in Russian that said, among other things, \"My\nfriends! I am very happy to finally provide this information to you... I look\nforward to our friendship and shared benefit.\"\n\nOf course, the FBI agent was not his friend and the whole thing was a sting\noperation, and the former NSA employee was arrested just after he sent the\nclassified materials. Dalke pleaded guilty from the outset.\n\n\"This defendant, who had sworn an oath to defend our country, believed he was\nselling classified national security information to a Russian agent, when in\nfact, he was outing himself to the FBI,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland\nsaid. \"This sentence demonstrates that those who seek to betray our country\nwill be held accountable for their crimes.\"\n\n  * Ex-NSA techie pleads guilty to selling state secrets to Russia\n  * FBI: We tracked who was printing secret documents to unmask ex-NSA suspect\n  * How CIA betrayed informants with shoddy front websites built for covert comms\n  * Supreme Court not interested in hearing about NSA's super-snoop schemes\n\nSentencing law is somewhat complex, but assuming Dalke can't serve any of his\ncounts concurrently and that he doesn't get out early, he'll be getting out in\nJanuary 2046, and he'll be 53 or 54.\n\nThe NSA employee turned failed Russian informant was remarkably unsuccessful\nin his attempt to give Russia a helping hand, though it is a little concerning\nthat Dalke had NDI material in his possession at all. The incident isn't\nunlike the Teixeira leaks from last month, especially since both Dalke and\nTeixeira were seemingly completely incompetent in leaking info. Maybe the US\ngovernment should review who gets access to classified materials, as it seems\nneither person had any real business handling these docs. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * FBI\n  * NSA\n  * Russia\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * FBI\n  * NSA\n  * Russia\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Roscosmos\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n  * United States Department of Defense\n  * United States Department of Justice\n\n#### More about\n\n8 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * FBI\n  * NSA\n  * Russia\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * FBI\n  * NSA\n  * Russia\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Roscosmos\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n  * United States Department of Defense\n  * United States Department of Justice\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Psst, hey.
