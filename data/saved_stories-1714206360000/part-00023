It\u2019s a problem that isn\u2019t\ngoing away, plaguing everyone from engineering teams to IT security pros, and\nif you work in the industry today you\u2019ve likely experienced it somewhere\nwithin your own teams.\n\nDespite major changes in the tech landscape, it is clear that organizations\nare still having significant difficulty keeping their technical talent in-\nhouse.\n\nAccording to a fall 2022 survey by Deloitte, some 60% of tech leaders believe\nthat recruiting talent is a major challenge. Half of respondents said\nretaining that talent was a similarly major challenge. Good people remain\ndifficult to find, and keep.\n\nThese concerns are further exacerbated by the rapid rate of change across the\nmodern technology spectrum. Innovations such as the cloud, microservices\narchitectures and CI/CD delivery practices have ramped up complexity and\nplaced experienced workers at an even greater premium. To that end, the\ncurrent talent gap has also levied a major impact on observability practices\nwithin many organizations.\n\nAs observability data volumes are skyrocketing, it clearly becomes harder to\nseparate the signal from the noise. When an issue in your cloud applications\nor infrastructure inevitably arises, how quickly can you hope to investigate\nand troubleshoot those problems without the right knowledge in place?\n\nArchitectures have grown exceedingly complex. While services like Kubernetes\nhave helped with building and orchestrating modern applications, the layers of\nadded abstraction involved make almost every aspect of monitoring and\ntroubleshooting even more difficult.\n\nThis troubling knowledge and talent gap trend for observability was\nhighlighted in the 2024 Observability Pulse survey of over 500 IT\nprofessionals globally, and raises the question for how organizations can\ntackle this issue going forward.\n\n## Lack of Knowledge on Teams is Causing Observability Difficulty\n\nEach year, we ask respondents of the Pulse survey about the biggest challenges\nthey face gaining observability into their cloud native environment. In 2023,\nthe top response to this question was \u201cKubernetes\u201c, microservices, serverless\nand cloud native architecture\u201d coming in at just under 50%.\n\nIn 2024, a different response to this question earned the top spot: \u201clack of\nknowledge among the team,\u201d at 48%. \u201cData security\u201d was second at 43% and \u201cthe\ntotal cost of ownership and large volumes of data\u201d was third at 42%. The\n\u201cKubernetes\u201d response was tied for 4th at 36%.\n\nThere are a few different takeaways from that top response. First, it\u2019s a sign\nthat teams are lacking individuals and manpower to gain the correct\nobservability into their environments. Second, it also shows that even if\nteams have the requisite number of individuals, they don\u2019t have the right\ntechnical acumen to gain and maintain observability.\n\nAs a result, organizations must find a way to overcome their current technical\nand process challenges to engage a practical observability approach that meets\nthe vision for unified, cross-stack visibility and troubleshooting that drives\ndown MTTR and improves user experience. This must be supported by tooling that\nhelps experienced workers cover more ground with less effort, and enables less\nexperienced teams to leverage automation and even AI to close the gap and\nperform at a higher level than otherwise possible.\n\nThe 2024 Observability Pulse survey demonstrates clearly that increasing\nmaturity to best enable available talent while more closely controlling costs\nwill be critical requirements, both today and in the future.\n\n## How Logz.io Open 360TM Can Help Overcome Observability Talent Gaps\n\nAn observability platform designed for modern, cloud-native use cases can help\nyou overcome talent gaps and provide needed stability when your team needs it.\n\nProviding the targeted automation necessary to better enable your team,\nregardless of experience level, is precisely how Logz.io has built the Open\n360 observability platform and also curated the hands-on support that you\nreceive when you\u2019re one of our customers.\n\nOpen 360 can help immediately extend the capabilities of your team in many\nways, including:\n\n  * Observability IQ.
