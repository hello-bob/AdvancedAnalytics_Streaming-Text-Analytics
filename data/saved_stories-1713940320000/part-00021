Basic Ansible Knowledge: A fundamental understanding of Ansible, including concepts like playbooks, roles, tasks, and inventory, is essential for using Knee effectively.\n\n  2. Infrastructure Fundamentals: Knowledge of key infrastructure concepts such as virtual machines, networking, and cloud services will greatly aid in the deployment and management of services with Knee.\n\n  3. System Requirements:\n\n     * Your system should meet the minimum requirements for running Ansible.\n\n     * Target System should be Debian based Linux for the intended installation.\n\n     * For replication, MongoDB requires 2 additional hosts, MySQL and PostgreSQL require 1 additional host each.\n\n     * Before running the tool, the details of the target system, such as the IP address and SSH key, are required. To try out Knee locally, set up a virtual machine. Refer to VIRTUAL_MACHINE.md for instructions on setting up the virtual machine locally.\n\n## Supported Systems\n\nDatabases| Webservers| Caching Tools  \n---|---|---  \nMySQL| Nodejs| Redis  \nPostgreSQL| Python  \nMongoDB| Golang  \nRuby  \n  \n## Getting Started\n\n  * Ensure Python is Installed:\n\nDownload and install Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/] \ud83d\udc0d\n\n  * Clone the Git repository:\n    \n        git clone https://github.com/shurutech/knee.git\n\n  * Create virtualenv:\n    \n        virtualenv -p python3.12.x venv\n\n  * Activate Virtualenv:\n    \n        source venv/bin/activate\n\n  * Install Dependencies:\n    \n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n  * To run tests\n    \n        pytest cli/tests\n\n  * Execute command to initialize and run setup: Refer to the Usage Examples for more details.\n    \n        ./knee execute\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter you've completed the setup, you can start exploring the functionalities\nprovided by Knee.\n\nWhen you run the application, you'll be presented with two main options:\n\n  * Knee Defaults: This option provides a set of predefined configurations that automate the installation and setup of commonly used software combinations. If you're not sure what software to install, or if you want to quickly set up a popular software combination, this is a good option to choose.\n\n  * Custom Selection: This option allows you to customize the setup according to your needs. You can select the server, database, caching tool, or any combination of these. You can also choose not to select any of these options if you prefer.\n\nChoose the option that best suits your needs and follow the prompts to\ncomplete the setup.\n\n  * For a comprehensive list of all available commands and options, you can use the help command:\n    \n        ./knee --help\n\nor\n\n    \n        ./knee -h\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n  1. Setting Up a Nodejs-Postgresql-Redis Infrastructure: Knee quickly sets up a server for your application. Run ./knee execute, then choose 'Nodejs' for the server option, 'Postgresql' for the database option, and 'Redis' for the caching tool option in the custom selection.\n\n  2. Quickly Setting Up a Common Software Stack: If you're not sure what software to install, or if you want to quickly set up a popular software combinations(golang-mongo, python-postgres etc.), you can use the Knee defaults option. Run ./knee execute and choose the Knee defaults option.\n\n  3. Customizing Your Setup: If you have specific needs for your project, you can customize your setup with Knee. Run ./knee execute and use the custom selection option to choose the server, database, and additional services that fit your needs\n\n## Next Steps/Features\n\nWe plan to continue building after the initial release and look forward to the\nfeedback from the community. As of now we have following features planned out\nfor next releases.\n\n  * Platform Compatibility: Knee plans to support more OS and configurations.\n\n  * Adaptation to Trends: Staying updated with emerging technologies to meet the changing needs of users.\n\n  * Interactive Input: Enable users to input configuration details directly via command-line.\n\n  * Flexible replica count: Option for the users to input number of replica host.\n\n## Contribution Guidelines\n\nKnee welcomes all constructive contributions. Contributions take many forms,\nfrom code for bug fixes and enhancements, to additions and fixes to\ndocumentation, additional tests, triaging incoming pull requests and issues,\nand more!\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nReporting Bugs\n\nBefore reporting a bug, please:\n\n  * Check the issue tracker to ensure the bug hasn't already been reported.\n  * If the issue is unreported, create a new issue, providing:\n\n    * A clear title and description.\n    * Steps to reproduce the bug.\n    * Expected behavior and what actually happened.\n    * Any relevant error messages or screenshots.\n\nSuggesting Enhancements We love to receive suggestions for enhancements!\nPlease:\n\n  * First, check if the enhancement has already been suggested.\n  * If not, open a new issue, describing the enhancement and why it would be beneficial.\n\nPull Requests Ready to contribute code?
