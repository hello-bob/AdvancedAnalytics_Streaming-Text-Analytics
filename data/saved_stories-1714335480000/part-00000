Ryan Gosling\u2019s role in stuntman pic The\nFall Guy, hard on the heels of his show-stopping Oscars rendition of I\u2019m Just\nKen, is perfectly timed to confirm his ascension to the very top tier of\nstardom. Not only is it a four-quadrant entertainment turbo boost \u2013 covering\nall audience bases with action, romance, a legacy franchise for the oldies,\nJohn Wick-slick for the kids \u2013 it is shrink-wrapped to his public persona. His\nrole as stunt veteran Colt Seavers, saving the skin of the idiot megastar he\ndoubles for, caps off the stance Gosling has upheld on talkshows and memes\nover the last decade: stardom and celebrity as a delectable facade, an in-joke\nbetween star and audience to be played with the lightest of ironic touches.\n\nBut of course Gosling is a bona fide star, one of Hollywood\u2019s most important.\nHis confused, toxic himbo Ken stole the Barbie limelight from Margot Robbie.\nTunnelling into classic archetypes of masculinity with modern self-awareness\nis the on-screen niche he has made his own \u2013 giving us a new, uniquely supple\nmale star for the post-#MeToo era. His mainstream roles \u2013 getaway drivers,\ndaredevil motorcyclists, venal bankers \u2013 have often been ultra-macho, but the\nactor himself comes with rounded metrosexual edges. Men want to be him, with\nhis debonair cool and inexhaustible supply of swanky jackets (the leather\nMiami Vice stunt-team number in The Fall Guy being the latest). As far back as\n2017, Morwenna Ferrier noted that Gosling clones, sporting a certain \u201cturbo\ncleanliness\u201d, were now on the loose in cities everywhere.\n\nAt the same time, this role model status doesn\u2019t alienate women; in fact, like\nmost well-adjusted male stars in this day and age, he wears his feminist\ncredentials on his perfectly pressed sleeve. Raised by his mother and older\nsister, he said in 2016: \u201cI think women are better than men. They are\nstronger, more evolved.\u201d A year later, accepting his Golden Globe for La La\nLand, he thanked his \u201clady\u201d, Eva Mendes, for raising their daughters while he\nwas on set. When Robbie and Barbie director Greta Gerwig were overlooked at\nthis year\u2019s Globes, he objected in writing: \u201cThere is no Ken without Barbie.\u201d\n\nAnd crucially his best work services both sexes, often putting him in\nsubordinate roles that like Ken are candid about male frailties. His Officer K\nin Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Blade Runner sequel looks, like any self-respecting\nreplicant-hunter, like a Raymond Chandler gumshoe. But he is a patsy swept\nalong on narcissistic, all too 21st-century delusions of specialness. (The\ninternet got the hint, memeing his self-righteous \u201cGoddamnit\u201d outburst.)\n\n\u2018No natural leading man qualities\u2019 ... Rachel McAdams and Gosling in The\nNotebook. Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/Alamy\n\nThe Fall Guy is more relaxed \u2013 but still self-deprecating. With his biceps and\nblond feather-cut, driving, fighting, falling human multitool Seavers is cut\nfrom heart-throb cloth. But he wears this burden like his battered jacket. \u201cI\nnever saw a fist I didn\u2019t remember,\u201d he says after a pummelling. The film\u2019s\nscreenwriter Drew Pearce confirms that Gosling\u2019s adeptness at playing two ends\nof the spectrum was key to the film: \u201cHe\u2019s both authentically masculine, yet\nalso emotionally vulnerable. It\u2019s the best of an old-fashioned movie star like\nSteve McQueen, with a modern twist of sensitivity. In the movie we play with\nthat dichotomy \u2013 his character is a good guy, for sure, but there\u2019s a blind\nspot in his emotional self-awareness that comes from a very masculine place.\u201d\n\nUndercutting machismo is nothing new, of course: that was the USP of the\nemerging male stars of 90s New Man-era Hollywood, such as Keanu Reeves, Johnny\nDepp and Leonardo DiCaprio. But Gosling\u2019s ability to simultaneously affirm and\nquestion masculine mores, in films at the very top of his profession, does\nfeel new. His Barbie press tour \u2013 lamenting his daughters\u2019 indifference to\ntheir Ken dolls, while running with a Kenucopia of terrible puns \u2013 was a work\nof art. This was a man obviously drawing from a deep well of misplaced gender\nexpectations: after being fired up by a childhood viewing of Sylvester\nStallone in First Blood, he was suspended from school after lobbing steak\nknives at fellow pupils. Sly\u2019s habit of wearing minks while directing\napparently inspired Ken\u2019s wardrobe.\n\nSubversive glint ... Gosling in The Believer. Photograph: Everett Collection\nInc/Alamy\n\nGosling\u2019s emergence as auto-satirising alpha male is all the more fascinating\nfor the long time it has taken. Not an especial singing or dancing talent, he\nwasn\u2019t on the same 90s fast track as fellow Mouseketeers Britney Spears,\nJustin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera. It was 10 more years until his first\nnotable box office success in 2004 weepie The Notebook, his own balsa-wood\nTitanic. Cast by director Nick Cassavetes for having \u201cno natural leading man\nqualities\u201d, he was an engrossing mess opposite his love rival, the more\nconventionally luscious James Marsden. In contrast with his current GQ\nspiffiness, there was something gawky about the long-chinned actor during this\nperiod. But his subversive glint saw him in good stead during the string of\nriveting misfits he played in the 00s: a self-hating Jewish neo-Nazi in 2001\u2019s\nThe Believer, a crack-addicted high-school teacher in 2006\u2019s Half Nelson, and\na somehow-endearing sex-doll enthusiast in 2007\u2019s Lars and the Real Girl.\n\nHis long showbiz gestation \u2013 and being arguably the most memed actor of the\nsocial media age \u2013 means Gosling feels closer to being one of our own than the\ntypical Hollywood star; a closeness exploited by The Fall Guy in making him\nthe audience proxy, next to airhead megastar Tom Ryder, played by Aaron\nTaylor-Johnson. Growing up aware of how the industry propagates gender\nstandards, he\u2019s earned his stripes in terms of later making these norms\nmalleable. The damaged complexity of his indie phase persisted in Gosling\u2019s\ntake on masculinity once he was at Hollywood\u2019s high table: the diminished,\ndecentralised and incompetent men of The Nice Guys, Blade Runner 2049, and\nBarbie.\n\n\u2018A guy that\u2019s seen too many movies\u2019 ... in Drive. Photograph:\nFilmdistrict/Sportsphoto/Allstar\n\nBut occasionally he has almost seemed to enjoy succumbing to mainstream\nindustry \u201cnihilism\u201d, as Seavers skewers the oeuvre of Tom Ryder. Gosling\u2019s\nmonosyllabic getaway man in Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s head-stomping fairytale\nDrive was, in the actor\u2019s words: \u201ca guy that\u2019s seen too many movies\u201d. He\nreturned to the same caricatural taciturn action mode \u2013 sporting a toothpick\nonce again \u2013 in the recent Netflix movie The Gray Man.\n\nIt seems trite to point out the quality now obvious to everyone, but embracing\ncomedy is what really put Gosling in the mainstream. Playing a Neil Strauss-\ntype pickup artist with an unfeasible abdomen in 2011\u2019s Crazy, Stupid, Love\nwas his first wholehearted stab at the genre, though his facility with\nlarkiness was there in his uxorious wiseguy in Blue Valentine the year before.\nAccording to the leaked Sony emails, he was still actively canvassing in that\ndirection in a 2014 meeting with studio head Amy Pascal. Crazy, Stupid, Love\nalso cemented him in the zeitgeist as the arch-smoothie of the Hey Girl meme\ndoing the rounds during that period; something he seemed happy to endorse\n(ironically).\n\nThe high camp of his recent Oscars performance \u2013 the Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\naesthetics, tittering as he chin-bumped Mark Ronson \u2013 was the fuchsia icing on\nthe cake of his insouciant approach to fame. \u201cI have a theory about leading\nmen,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cThey really transcend and become an all-timer the moment\nthey realise that the goofier they are \u2013 the more they throw away what other\npeople hold on to, the \u2018trying to be cool\u2019 part \u2013 then they become something\nmore cool. What Ryan has is a lack of insecurity about teasing himself \u2013 about\nhis stardom, his masculinity.\u201d\n\n\u2018His style connects him back to retro masculine archetypes, but with a modern\nveneer\u2019 ... Emma Stone and Gosling in La La Land. Photograph: Summit\nEntertainment/Allstar\n\nPaul Newman, and his \u201cironic sensibility\u201d in the likes of 1966 detective pic\nHarper, is the classic-era equivalent Pearce had in mind while writing The\nFall Guy. But Gosling is even more stylised in his comedy outings: he is a\nstraight man by trade, and often even a stooge. In Barbie, the joke \u2013 even in\nhis equine-based embrace of the patriarchy \u2013 is always on Ken. Gosling\u2019s old-\nlady-swindling PI in 2016\u2019s The Nice Guys spends as much time dropping\ncigarettes down his pants, injuring himself when breaking and entering and\nirresponsibly parenting as turning up viable leads. A certain underlying\ntetchiness, allied with his dusty voice, make the actor a natural for this\ndeadpan work. He kills his scenes as credit default swap king Jared Vennett in\nThe Big Short, reeling off predatory financial advice with an unrepentant\nstraight face. His timing and tone are invariably superb. Only Gosling, in an\nSNL skit, could make a crusade against a bad font play like All the\nPresident\u2019s Men.\n\nIt\u2019s curious to see something as old-school as a straight man become white-hot\nbox office in 2024. And it\u2019s undoubtedly a boon for cinema in its current\nturbulent and panicked state; it can still spawn blockbusters with enough heat\nto ignite new stars. It\u2019s not clear if the likes of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya\nand Sydney Sweeney are capable of that feat of old: launching a film on their\nnames alone. But Robbie and the veteran Gosling feel closer to possessing that\nkind of firepower \u2013 probably not enough to \u201csave\u201d cinema, but at least to give\nus hope that it is not in terminal decline.\n\nGosling\u2019s drawn-out, teasing shimmy to the top and tight rapport with\naudiences gives him added credibility as a headliner. His appeal is\nsophisticated: his style connects him back to retro masculine archetypes, but\nwith a modern veneer. That throwback musical La La Land \u2013 with him holding out\nfor jazz (\u201cIt\u2019s dying \u2013 but not on my watch\u201d) and old-timey romance \u2013 located\nthe sweet spot between the two. Of course, he later sent it up on SNL.\n\nRyan Gosling movies \u2013 ranked!\n\nRead more\n\nBut how far can that perfectly calibrated irony take him? If the shtick\ncongeals, he might be a new Roger Moore in waiting. And is his enlightened\nbrand of masculinity, hinting at a course correction for Hollywood gender\nrelations, really meaningful \u2013 or just new packaging? But among the many\nabilities he has shown, Gosling knows how to evolve. To deepen his appeal and\nartistry, not to mention ticking awards-season boxes, he may have to seek out\npenetrating roles in straight drama \u2013 something, outside reteaming with La La\nLand director Damien Chazelle in Neil Armstrong biopic First Man, he\u2019s hardly\nbeen seen in over the last decade. But for now, the Ryanaissance can wait;\nhe\u2019s the Gosling that\u2019s laying the golden eggs.\n\nThe Fall Guy is out on 2 May\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Film\n  * Ryan Gosling\n  * Celebrity\n  * Barbie\n  * Drive\n  * La La Land\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
