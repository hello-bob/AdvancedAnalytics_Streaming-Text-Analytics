Sat, Feb 3 20248:27 AM ESTUpdated Sat, Feb 3 202412:04 PM EST\n\nCarlos Waters@in/carloswaters/@carlos_waters\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO9:5009:50\n\nHow RealPage influences rent prices across the U.S.\n\nMarkets and Politics Digital Original Video\n\nKey Points\n\n  * A group of lawsuits accuse large landlords of price-fixing the market rate of rent in the United States\n  * A complaint filed by Washington D.C.\u2019s Attorney General alleges 14 landlords in the district are sharing competitively sensitive data through RealPage, a real estate software provider\n  * RealPage recommends prices for roughly 4.5 million housing units in the United States\n  * RealPage told CNBC that its landlord customers are under no obligation to take their price suggestions\n\nIn this article\n\n  * MAAUNCH\n  * AVBUNCH\n  * CPTUNCH\n  * JBGSUNCH\n  * EQRUNCH\n\nA group of renters in the U.S. say their landlords are using software to\ndeliver inflated rent hikes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told as tenants by employees of Equity that the software takes\nempathy out of the equation. So they can charge whatever the software tells\nthem to charge,\u201d said Kevin Weller, a tenant at Portside Towers since 2021.\n\nTenants say the management started to increase prices substantially after\ngiving renters concessions during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe 527-unit building is located roughly 20 minutes away from the World Trade\nCenter, on the shoreline of Jersey City, New Jersey. A group of tenants at the\ntower is involved in a sprawling class-action lawsuit against RealPage and 34\nco-defendant landlords. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a statement of\ninterest in the case in December 2023, arguing that the complaints adequately\nallege violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\nIn November 2023, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., filed a similar\nbut more narrow complaint against RealPage and 14 landlords that collectively\nmanage more than 50,000 apartment units in the District.\n\n\u201cEffectively, RealPage is facilitating a housing cartel,\u201d said Attorney\nGeneral of the District of Columbia Brian Schwalb in an interview with CNBC.\nHis office filed the complaint on antitrust grounds. They allege that\nlandlords share competitively sensitive data through RealPage, which then sets\nartificially high rents on a key slice of the local rental market.\n\nOffice of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia, November 2023\n\n\u201cRather than making independent decisions on what the market here in D.C.\ncalls for in terms of filling vacant units, landlords are compelled, under the\nterms of their agreement with RealPage, to charge what RealPage tells them,\u201d\nsaid Schwalb.\n\nRealPage says its revenue management products use anonymized, aggregated data\nto deliver pricing recommendations on roughly 4.5 million housing units in the\nU.S. The company says its tools can increase landlord revenues between 2% and\n7%.\n\n\u201cJust turning the system on will outperform your manual analyst. There\u2019s\nalmost no way it can\u2019t,\u201d said Jeffrey Roper, a former RealPage employee and\ninventor of YieldStar.\n\nYieldStar is one of three key revenue management tools offered by RealPage.\nThe software balances prices, occupancy and lease lengths to help property\nmanagers optimize their portfolio\u2019s yield. The company feeds data from its\nmodels into a newer tool dubbed \u201cAIRM\u201d that considers the effect of credit,\nmarketing and leasing effectiveness.\n\nRealPage told CNBC that its landlord customers are under no obligation to take\ntheir price suggestions. The company also said it charges a fixed fee on each\napartment unit managed with its software.\n\nRealPage was acquired by Miami-based private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $10.2\nbillion in 2021. In court filings, Thoma Bravo has claimed that it is not\nliable for the alleged acts of its subsidiary outlined by plaintiffs in the\nclass-action complaints.\n\nRenters told CNBC they discovered how revenue management software is used in\nreal estate after reading a 2022 ProPublica investigation. Equity Residential\ninvestor materials show that the company started to experiment with Lease Rent\nOptions between 2005 and 2008. RealPage acquired the product in 2017.\n\n\u201cHow could we possibly know?\u201d said Harry Gural, a tenant in an Equity\nResidential property located in the Van Ness neighborhood of Washington, D.C.\nGural says he has been involved in legal matters against his landlord\u2019s\npricing practices for more than seven years.\n\nAffiliates of Equity Residential are contesting a separate decision made by a\nlocal housing authority in Jersey City regarding prices set on the Portside\nTowers property. The company has filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging\nthe decision, stating that the decision could result in millions of dollars in\nrefunds for tenants.\n\nEquity Residential and other defendant landlords declined to comment on\nongoing RealPage litigation.\n\nRedfin reports that asking rents in the U.S. ticked down to $1,964 a month in\nDecember 2023, a decline from recent highs. Prices are coming down in markets\nsuch as Atlanta and Austin, Texas, where home construction is high. But\nanalysts believe low rates of homebuilding on the U.S. East Coast could give\nwell-located landlords more pricing power.\n\n\u201cGuys like us that own 80,000 well-located apartments, we\u2019re still in a pretty\ngood spot,\u201d said Equity Residential CEO Mark Parrell in a June 2023 interview\nwith CNBC.\n\nWatch the video above to learn about the rising tide of lawsuits against U.S.\ncorporate landlords.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated when Equity\nResidential purchased Portside Towers.\n\nRecommended Video\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO12:3312:33\n\nThe rise of corporate landlords in the U.S.\n\nMarkets and Politics Digital Original Video\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
