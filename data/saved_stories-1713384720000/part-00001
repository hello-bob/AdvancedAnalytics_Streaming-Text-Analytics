It's akin to an AI model tag team.\n  * Cost-Effectiveness: Priced at $20/month, Poe users get access to all the latest models, including ChatGPT 4, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Normally, each of these would cost $20/month separately.\n\n#### How Does It Work?\n\n  * Integration and Comparison: Users can query different models like Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4 in one go, compare their responses, or pull in up-to-date information using the Web Search bot. Then, they can leverage a specialized writing bot to continue the conversation using the gathered context.\n  * Compute Points System: Poe now operates on a \"compute points\" system where subscribers receive a million points monthly to use across the diverse chatbots. The cost per message varies significantly across models, making some conversations more expensive than others.\n\n#### Competitive Edge\n\nPoe was the pioneer in allowing users to engage with multiple large language\nmodels (LLMs) from a single platform. Competitors like Perplexity entered the\nmarket later and while it serves as a powerful search engine driven by LLMs,\nit lacks the seamless multi-model interaction that Poe offers.\n\n#### Future Prospects\n\nThe pace at which AI is evolving is pretty impressive. Poe's multi-bot feature\nexemplifies a step towards integrating various AI capabilities into a\nstreamlined workflow, making it a tool for both casual users and AI\ndevelopers.\n\nAs the AI landscape grows, platforms like Poe that facilitate easy, efficient,\nand flexible interactions with multiple AI models will likely become\nincreasingly valuable.\n\nSource: Reddit -> The New Poe App Offers Access to Multiple\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nFor further actions, you may consider blocking this person and/or reporting\nabuse\n\n## Read next\n\n### Unveiling Many-Shot Jailbreaking: A New Challenge for LLMs\n\nDamon Who - Apr 4\n\n### Claude 3 Opus is by far the best AI tool for summarization.\n\nDamon Who - Apr 4\n\n### The Imminent Arrival of Stable Diffusion 3: A New Era in AI-Generated\nImagery\n\nJj Chao - Mar 28\n\nPromptzone - Commumity\n\n  * Joined\n\nMar 23, 2024\n\n### More from Promptzone - Commumity\n\nRewind Becomes Limitless: Launches a $99 Wearable for Capturing Daily\nInteractions\n\n#ai #news\n\nxAI Unveils Grok 1.5V - The Multimodal Assistant With an Edge in Real-World\nUnderstanding\n\n#ai #news #xai\n\nOpenAI Unleashes GPT-4 Turbo Reclaiming AI Supremacy with Enhanced Performance\n\n#ai #news #chatgpt\n\nPromptzone \u2014 PromptZone: A vibrant community for creative minds to share,\nexplore, and discuss prompts across various genres and interests.
