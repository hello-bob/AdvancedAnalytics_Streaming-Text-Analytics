Unfortunately, up\nto half of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have never been published,\nand trials with statistically significant findings are more likely to be\npublished than those without (Dwan et al., Reference Dwan, Gamble, Williamson\nand Kirkham2013). Importantly, negative trials face additional hurdles beyond\nstudy publication bias that can result in the disappearance of non-significant\nresults (Boutron et al., Reference Boutron, Dutton, Ravaud and Altman2010;\nDwan et al., Reference Dwan, Gamble, Williamson and Kirkham2013; Duyx et al.,\nReference Duyx, Urlings, Swaen, Bouter and Zeegers2017). Here, we analyze the\ncumulative impact of biases on apparent efficacy, and discuss possible\nremedies, using the evidence base for two effective treatments for depression:\nantidepressants and psychotherapy.\n\n## Reporting and citation biases\n\nWe distinguish among four major biases, although others exist: study\npublication bias, outcome reporting bias, spin, and citation bias. While study\npublication bias involves non-publication of an entire study, outcome\nreporting bias refers to non-publication of negative outcomes within a\npublished article or to switching the status of (non-significant) primary and\n(significant) secondary outcomes (Dwan et al., Reference Dwan, Gamble,\nWilliamson and Kirkham2013). Both biases pose an important threat to the\nvalidity of meta-analyses (Kicinski, Reference Kicinski2014).\n\nTrials that faithfully report non-significant results will yield accurate\neffect size estimates, but results interpretation can still be positively\nbiased, which may affect apparent efficacy. Reporting strategies that could\ndistort the interpretation of results and mislead readers are defined as spin\n(Boutron et al., Reference Boutron, Dutton, Ravaud and Altman2010). Spin\noccurs when authors conclude that the treatment is effective despite non-\nsignificant results on the primary outcome, for instance by focusing on\nstatistically significant, but secondary, analyses (e.g. instead of concluding\nthat treatment X was not more effective than placebo, concluding that\ntreatment X was well tolerated and was effective in patients who had not\nreceived prior therapy). If an article has been spun, treatments are perceived\nas more beneficial (Boutron et al., Reference Boutron, Altman, Hopewell, Vera-\nBadillo, Tannock and Ravaud2014). Finally, citation bias is an obstacle to\nensuring that negative findings are discoverable. Studies with positive\nresults receive more citations than negative studies (Duyx et al., Reference\nDuyx, Urlings, Swaen, Bouter and Zeegers2017), leading to a heightened\nvisibility of positive results.\n\n## The evidence base for antidepressants\n\nWe assembled a cohort of 105 depression trials, of which 74 were also included\nin a previous study on publication bias (Turner et al., Reference Turner,\nMatthews, Linardatos, Tell and Rosenthal2008); we added 31 trials of novel\nantidepressants (approved after 2008) from the Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) database (see online Supplementary materials). Pharmaceutical companies\nmust preregister all trials they intend to use to obtain FDA approval; hence,\ntrials with non-significant results, even if unpublished, are still\naccessible.\n\nFigure 1 demonstrates the cumulative impact of reporting and citation biases.\nOf 105 antidepressant trials, 53 (50%) trials were considered positive by the\nFDA and 52 (50%) were considered negative or questionable (Fig. 1a). While all\nbut one of the positive trials (98%) were published, only 25 (48%) of the\nnegative trials were published. Hence, 77 trials were published, of which 25\n(32%) were negative (Fig. 1b). Ten negative trials, however, became \u2018positive\u2019\nin the published literature, by omitting unfavorable outcomes or switching the\nstatus of the primary and secondary outcomes (Fig. 1c). Without access to the\nFDA reviews, it would not have been possible to conclude that these trials,\nwhen analyzed according to protocol, were not positive. Among the remaining 15\n(19%) negative trials, five were published with spin in the abstract (i.e.\nconcluding that the treatment was effective). For instance, one article\nreported non-significant results for the primary outcome (p = 0.10), yet\nconcluded that the trial \u2018demonstrates an antidepressant effect for fluoxetine\nthat is significantly more marked than the effect produced by placebo\u2019\n(Rickels et al., Reference Rickels, Amsterdam and Avallone1986). Five\nadditional articles contained mild spin (e.g. suggesting the treatment is at\nleast numerically better than placebo). One article lacked an abstract, but\nthe discussion section concluded that there was a \u2018trend for efficacy\u2019. Hence,\nonly four (5%) of 77 published trials unambiguously reported that the\ntreatment was not more effective than placebo in that particular trial (Fig.\n1d). Compounding the problem, positive trials were cited three times as\nfrequently as negative trials (92 v. 32 citations in Web of Science, January\n2016, p < 0.001, see online Supplementary material for further details) (Fig.\n1e). Among negative trials, those with (mild) spin in the abstract received an\naverage of 36 citations, while those with a clearly negative abstract received\n25 citations. While this might suggest a synergistic effect between spin and\ncitation biases, where negatively presented negative studies receive\nespecially few citations (de Vries et al., Reference de Vries, Roest, Franzen,\nMunaf\u00f2 and Bastiaansen2016), this difference was not statistically significant\n(p = 0.50), likely due to the small sample size. Altogether, these results\nshow that the effects of different biases accumulate to hide non-significant\nresults from view.\n\nFig. 1. The cumulative impact of reporting and citation biases on the evidence\nbase for antidepressants. (a) displays the initial, complete cohort of trials,\nwhile (b) through (e) show the cumulative effect of biases. Each circle\nindicates a trial, while the color indicates the results or the presence of\nspin. Circles connected by a grey line indicate trials that were published\ntogether in a pooled publication. In (e), the size of the circle indicates the\n(relative) number of citations received by that category of studies.\n\n## The evidence base for psychotherapy\n\nWhile the pharmaceutical industry has a financial motive for suppressing\nunfavorable results, these biases are also present in the other areas of\nresearch, such as psychotherapy. Without a standardized trial registry,\nhowever, they are more difficult to detect and disentangle. Statistical tests\nsuggest an excess of positive findings in the psychotherapy literature, due to\neither study publication bias or outcome reporting bias (Flint et al.,\nReference Flint, Cuijpers, Horder, Koole and Munaf\u00f22015). Of 55 National\nInstitutes of Health-funded psychotherapy trials, 13 (24%) remained\nunpublished (Driessen et al., Reference Driessen, Hollon, Bockting, Cuijpers\nand Turner2015), and these had a markedly lower effect size than the published\ntrials.\n\nRegarding spin, 49 (35%) of 142 papers were considered negative in a recent\nmeta-analysis (Flint et al., Reference Flint, Cuijpers, Horder, Koole and\nMunaf\u00f22015), but we found that only 12 (8%) abstracts concluded that\npsychotherapy was not more effective than a control condition. The remaining\nabstracts were either positive (73%) or mixed (19%) (e.g. concluding that the\ntreatment was effective for one outcome but not another). Although we could\nnot establish the pre-specified primary outcome for these trials, and\ntherefore cannot determine whether a specific abstract is biased, published\npsychotherapy trials, as a whole, clearly provide a more positive impression\nof the effectiveness of psychotherapy than is justified by available evidence.\nPositive psychotherapy trials were also cited nearly twice as frequently as\nnegative trials (111 citations v. 58, p = 0.003). Negative trials with a\npositive or mixed abstract were cited more often than those with a negative\nabstract (59 and 87 citations, respectively v. 26, p = 0.05); however, the\nsmall sample size precludes definitive conclusions on the effects of spin on\ncitation rates.\n\n## Preventing bias\n\nMandatory prospective registration has long been advocated as a solution for\nstudy publication and outcome reporting bias. The International Committee of\nMedical Journal Editors (ICMJE) began requiring prospective registration of\nclinical trials as a precondition for publication in 2005, but many journals\ndo not require registration (Kn\u00fcppel et al., Reference Kn\u00fcppel, Metz, Meerpohl\nand Strech2013) and others allow retrospective registration (Harriman and\nPatel, Reference Harriman and Patel2016). Since 2007, the FDA also requires\nprospective registration of most drug trials. This increasing pressure may\nexplain why recently completed, negative antidepressant trials are more\nfrequently published than older negative trials: all negative trials that\nremained unpublished were completed before 2004, while the 25 trials completed\nin 2004 or later (including 14 for which registration was legally required)\nwere all published, even though nine were negative. A regulatory requirement\nis likely to be one of the most effective measures to ensure universal\nregistration; unfortunately, the 2007 law excludes trials of behavioral\ninterventions (e.g. psychotherapy) and phase 1 (healthy volunteer) trials.\n\nNevertheless, registration seems insufficient to ensure complete and accurate\nreporting of a trial. Only around half of all trials registered at\nClinicalTrials.gov were published within two years of completion (Ross et al.,\nReference Ross, Mulvey, Hines, Nissen and Krumholz2009), and non-reporting of\nprotocol-specified outcomes or the silent addition of new outcomes is also\ncommon (Jones et al., Reference Jones, Keil, Holland, Caughey and Platts-\nMills2015, http://www.compare-trials.org). Close examination of registries by\nindependent researchers may be necessary for registration to be a truly\neffective deterrent to study publication and outcome reporting bias. An\nalternative (or addition) to registration could be publication of study\nprotocols or \u2018registered reports\u2019, in which journals accept a study for\npublication based on the introduction and methods, before the results are\nknown. Widespread adoption of this format might also help to prevent spin, by\nreducing the pressure that researchers might feel to \u2018oversell\u2019 their results\nto get published. Furthermore, in our analysis, positive studies were\npublished in journals with a higher median impact factor (and thus higher\nvisibility) than negative studies (3.5 v. 2.4 for antidepressant trials and\n3.1 v. 2.6 for psychotherapy trials), which may be one driver behind the\ndifference in citation rates. Hence, adoption of registered reports might also\nreduce citation bias by reducing the tendency for positive studies to be\npublished in higher impact journals. Peer reviewers could also play a crucial\nrole in ensuring that abstracts accurately report trial results and that\nimportant negative studies are cited. Finally, the prevalence of spin and\ncitation biases also shows the importance of assessing a study's actual\nresults (rather than relying on the authors\u2019 conclusions) and of conducting\nindependent literature searches, since reference lists may yield a\ndisproportionate number of positive (and positively presented) studies.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe problem of study publication bias is well-known. Our examination of\nantidepressant trials, however, shows the pernicious cumulative effect of\nadditional reporting and citation biases, which together eliminated most\nnegative results from the antidepressant literature and left the few published\nnegative results difficult to discover. These biases are unlikely to be unique\nto antidepressant trials. We have already shown that similar processes, though\nmore difficult to assess, occur within the psychotherapy literature, and it\nseems likely that the effect of these biases accumulates whenever they are\npresent. Consequently, researchers and clinicians across medical fields must\nbe aware of the potential for bias to distort apparent treatment efficacy,\nwhich poses a threat to the practice of evidence-based medicine.\n\n## Supplementary material\n\nThe supplementary material for this article can be found at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291718001873.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nMarcus R.
