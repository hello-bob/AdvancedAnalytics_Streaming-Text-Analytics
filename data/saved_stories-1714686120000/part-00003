For example, if the secondary (2) and auxiliary (4)\nbuttons are pressed simultaneously, the value is 6 (i.e., 2 + 4).\n\nNote: Do not confuse this property with the MouseEvent.button property. The\nMouseEvent.buttons property indicates the state of buttons pressed during any\nkind of mouse event, while the MouseEvent.button property only guarantees the\ncorrect value for mouse events caused by pressing or releasing one or multiple\nbuttons.\n\n## Value\n\nA number representing one or more buttons. For more than one button pressed\nsimultaneously, the values are combined (e.g., 3 is primary + secondary).\n\n  * 0: No button or un-initialized\n  * 1: Primary button (usually the left button)\n  * 2: Secondary button (usually the right button)\n  * 4: Auxiliary button (usually the mouse wheel button or middle button)\n  * 8: 4th button (typically the \"Browser Back\" button)\n  * 16 : 5th button (typically the \"Browser Forward\" button)\n\n## Examples\n\nThis example logs the buttons property when you trigger a mousedown event.\n\n### HTML\n\nhtml\n\n    \n    \n    <p>Click anywhere with one or more mouse buttons.</p> <pre id=\"log\">buttons: </pre>\n\n### JavaScript\n\njs\n\n    \n    \n    let log = document.createTextNode(\"?\"); // let log = new Text('?'); function logButtons(e) { log.data = `${e.buttons} (${e.type})`; // log.nodeValue= `${e.buttons} (${e.type})`; } document.addEventListener(\"mouseup\", logButtons); document.addEventListener(\"mousedown\", logButtons); // document.addEventListener('mousemove', logButtons); document.querySelector(\"#log\").appendChild(log);\n\n### Result\n\n## Specifications\n\nSpecification  \n---  \nUI Events # dom-mouseevent-buttons  \n  \n## Browser compatibility\n\nReport problems with this compatibility data on GitHub\n\ndesktop| mobile  \n---|---  \nChrome| Edge| Firefox| Opera| Safari| Chrome Android| Firefox for Android|\nOpera Android| Safari on iOS| Samsung Internet| WebView Android  \nbuttons  \n  \n### Legend\n\nTip: you can click/tap on a cell for more information.\n\nFull support\n\n    Full support\n\n    See implementation notes.\n\nThe compatibility table on this page is generated from structured data.

Therefore, primary might not be the left button on the device, secondary might not be the right button, and so on. Moreover, the middle (wheel) button, 4th button, and 5th button might not be assigned a value, even when they are pressed.\n  * Single-button devices may emulate additional buttons with combinations of button and keyboard presses.\n  * Touch devices may emulate buttons with configurable gestures (e.g., one-finger touch for primary, two-finger touch for secondary, etc.).\n  * On Linux (GTK), the 4th button and the 5th button are not supported. In addition, a mouseup event always includes the releasing button information in the buttons value.\n  * On Mac OS X 10.5, the buttons attribute always returns 0 because there is no platform API for implementing this feature.\n\n## See also\n\n  * MouseEvent\n\n## Help improve MDN\n\nLearn how to contribute.\n\nThis page was last modified on Apr 7, 2023 by MDN contributors.\n\nView this page on GitHub \u2022 Report a problem with this content\n\nMozilla adsDon't want to see ads?\n\nYour blueprint for a better internet.\n\n  * MDN on Mastodon\n  * MDN on X (formerly Twitter)\n  * MDN on GitHub\n  * MDN Blog RSS Feed\n\n## MDN\n\n  * About\n  * Blog\n  * Careers\n  * Advertise with us\n\n## Support\n\n  * Product help\n  * Report an issue\n\n## Our communities\n\n  * MDN Community\n  * MDN Forum\n  * MDN Chat\n\n## Developers\n\n  * Web Technologies\n  * Learn Web Development\n  * MDN Plus\n  * Hacks Blog\n\n  * Website Privacy Notice\n  * Cookies\n  * Legal\n  * Community Participation Guidelines\n\nVisit Mozilla Corporation\u2019s not-for-profit parent, the Mozilla Foundation.\nPortions of this content are \u00a91998\u20132024 by individual mozilla.org\ncontributors.
