Credit: CEA-IRFM\n\nResearchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics\nLaboratory (PPPL) measured a new record for a fusion device internally clad in\ntungsten, the element that could be the best fit for the commercial-scale\nmachines required to make fusion a viable energy source for the world.\n\nThe device sustained a hot fusion plasma of approximately 50 million degrees\nCelsius for a record six minutes with 1.15 gigajoules of power injected, 15%\nmore energy and twice the density than before. The plasma will need to be both\nhot and dense to generate reliable power for the grid.\n\nThe record was set in a fusion device known as WEST, the tungsten (W)\nEnvironment in Steady-state Tokamak, which is operated by the French\nAlternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). PPPL has long\npartnered with WEST, which is part of the International Atomic Energy Agency's\ngroup for the Coordination on International Challenges on Long duration\nOPeration (CICLOP).\n\nThis milestone represents an important step toward the CICLOP program's goals.\nThe researchers will submit a paper for publication in the next few weeks.\n\n\"We need to deliver a new source of energy, and the source should be\ncontinuous and permanent,\" said Xavier Litaudon, CEA scientist and CICLOP\nchair. Litaudon said PPPL's work at WEST is an excellent example.\n\n\"These are beautiful results. We have reached a stationary regime despite\nbeing in a challenging environment due to this tungsten wall.\"\n\nRemi Dumont, head of the Experimentation & Plasma Development Group of the\nCEA's Institute for Magnetic Fusion Research, was the scientific coordinator\nfor the experiment, calling it \"a spectacular result.\"\n\n00:00\n\n-00:45\n\nLuis Delgado-Aparicio, PPPL's head of advanced projects and lead scientist for\nthe physics research and the X-ray detector project, discusses the importance\nof the record results to the Lab. Credit: Michael Livingston / PPPL\nCommunications Department\n\nPPPL researchers used a novel approach to measure several properties of the\nplasma radiation. Their approach involved a specially adapted X-ray detector\noriginally made by DECTRIS, an electronics manufacturer, and later embedded\ninto the WEST tokamak, a machine that confines plasma\u2014the ultra-hot fourth\nstate of matter\u2014in a donut-shaped vessel using magnetic fields.\n\n\"The X-ray group in PPPL's Advanced Projects Department is developing all of\nthese innovative tools for tokamaks and stellarators around the world,\" said\nLuis Delgado-Aparicio, PPPL's head of advanced projects and lead scientist for\nthe physics research and the X-ray detector project.\n\nThis is just one example of PPPL's strengths in diagnostics: specialized\nmeasurement tools used, in this case, to characterize hot fusion plasmas.\n\n\"The plasma fusion community was among the first to test the hybrid photon\ncounting technology to monitor plasma dynamics,\" said DECTRIS Head of Sales\nNicolas Pilet.\n\n\"Today, WEST achieved unprecedented results, and we would like to congratulate\nthe team on their success. Plasma fusion is a fascinating scientific field\nthat holds great promise for humanity. We are incredibly proud to contribute\nto this development with our products, and are thrilled by our excellent\ncollaboration.\"\n\nScientists worldwide are trying different methods to reliably extract heat\nfrom plasma while it undergoes a fusion reaction. But this has proven to be\nparticularly challenging, partly because the plasma must be confined long\nenough to make the process economical at temperatures much hotter than the\ncenter of the sun.\n\nA previous version of the device\u2014Tore Supra\u2014achieved a slightly longer\nreaction, or shot, but back then, the machine's interior was made of graphite\ntiles.\n\nWhile carbon makes the environment easier for long shots, it may not be\nsuitable for a large-scale reactor because the carbon tends to retain the fuel\nin the wall, which will be unacceptable in a reactor where efficient recovery\nof tritium from the reactor chamber and reintroduction into the plasma will be\nparamount.\n\nTungsten is advantageous for retaining far less fuel, but if even minute\namounts of tungsten get into the plasma, radiation from the tungsten can\nrapidly cool the plasma.\n\n\"The tungsten-wall environment is far more challenging than using carbon,\"\nsaid Delgado-Aparicio. \"This is, simply, the difference between trying to grab\nyour kitten at home versus trying to pet the wildest lion.\"\n\n## Novel diagnostic measures record shot\n\nThe shot was measured using a novel approach developed by PPPL researchers.\nThe hardware for the measurement tool, or diagnostic, was made by DECTRIS and\nmodified by Delgado-Aparicio and others on his research team, including PPPL\nresearchers Tullio Barbui, Oulfa Chellai and Novimir Pablant.\n\n\"The diagnostic basically measures the X-ray radiation produced by the\nplasma,\" Barbui said of the device, known as a multi-energy soft X-ray camera\n(ME-SXR).\n\n\"Through the measure of this radiation, we can infer very important properties\nof the plasma, such as the electron temperature in the real core of the\nplasma, where it is the hottest.\"\n\nOff the shelf, the DECTRIS diagnostic can normally be configured with all\npixels set to the same energy level. PPPL developed a novel calibration\ntechnique that allows them to set the energy independently for each pixel.\n\nBarbui said the approach has advantages over the existing technique used in\nWEST, which can be hard to calibrate and generates readings that are sometimes\naffected by the radio frequency waves used to heat the plasma. \"Radio\nfrequency waves don't bother our diagnostic,\" Barbui said.\n\n\"During the six-minute shot, we were able to measure quite nicely the central\nelectron temperature. It was in a very steady state of around 4 kilovolts. It\nwas a pretty remarkable result,\" he said.\n\n## Searching for light at the right energy levels\n\nThe diagnostic looks for light from a specific kind of radiation known as\nBremsstrahlung, which is produced when an electron changes direction and slows\ndown. The initial challenge was figuring out what frequencies of light from\nBremsstrahlung to look for because both the plasma and the tungsten walls can\nemit this sort of radiation, but the measurements need to focus on the plasma.\n\n\"The photon energy band between 11 and 18 kiloelectronvolts (keV) offered us a\nnice window of opportunity from the core emission never explored before and\nthus influenced our decision to carefully sample this range,\" said Delgado-\nAparicio.\n\n\"Normally, when this technique is applied, you make only two measurements.\nThis is the first time we have taken a series of measurements,\" Barbui said.\n\nThe red line represents the plasma's edge. The yellow lines represent the many\nlines of sight of the ME-SXR diagnostic so that it can thoroughly evaluate the\nplasma. The diagnostic readings can be used to calculate the temperature of\nthe electrons in the plasma, the plasma charge and the density of impurities\nin the plasma. Credit: Luis Delgado-Aparicio and Tullio Barbui / PPPL\n\nDelgado-Aparicio also pointed out that \"the special calibration of our\ndetector allowed us to obtain readings for each energy level between 11 and 18\nkeV, for each line of sight from the camera, while sampling the entire cross\nsection.\"\n\nApproximately 10 measurements are taken per second. The trick is to use the\nintensity from the lowest 11 keV energy as a reference level, and measurements\nfrom the other seven intensities are compared to the initial one. Ultimately,\nthis process produces seven simultaneous temperature readings per line of\nsight, hence the high accuracy of the measurement.\n\n\"This innovative capability is now ready to be exported to many machines in\nthe U.S. and around the world,\" said Delgado-Aparicio.\n\n\"From the eight different intensity measurements, we got the best fit, which\nwas between 4 and 4.5 kilovolts for the core plasma. This represents nearly 50\nmillion degrees and for up to six minutes,\" said Delgado-Aparicio.\n\nThe diagnostic readings can be used not only to calculate the temperature of\nthe electrons in the plasma but also the plasma charge and the density of\nimpurities in the plasma, which is largely tungsten that has migrated from the\ntokamak's walls.\n\n\"This particular system is the first of this kind with energy discrimination.\nAs such, it can provide information on temperature and many details on the\nprecise impurity content\u2014mainly tungsten\u2014in the discharge, which is a crucial\nquantity to operate in any metallic environment.\n\n\"It is spectacular,\" said Dumont. While this data can be inferred from several\nother diagnostics and supported with modeling, Dumont described this new\nmethod as \"more direct.\"\n\nBarbui said the diagnostic can gather even more information in future\nexperiments. \"This detector has the unique capability in that it can be\nconfigured to measure the same plasma with as many energies as you want,\"\nBarbui said. \"Now, we have selected eight energies, but we could have selected\n10 or 15.\"\n\nLitaudon said he is pleased to have such a diagnostic on hand for the CICLOP\nprogram. \"In fact, this energy-resolving camera will open a new route in terms\nof analysis,\" he said.\n\n\"It's extremely challenging to operate a facility with a tungsten wall. But\nthanks to these new measurements, we will have the ability to measure the\ntungsten inside the plasma and to understand the transport of tungsten from\nthe wall to the core of the plasma.\"\n\nLitaudon says this could help them minimize the amount of tungsten in the\nplasma's core to ensure optimal operating conditions for fusion. \"Thanks to\nthese diagnostics, we can understand this problem and go to the root of the\nphysics for both measurement and simulation.\"\n\nTime-intensive computer calculations carried out by CEA's Dumont, Pierre Manas\nand Theo Fonghetti also confirmed good agreement between relevant simulations\nand the measurements reported by the PPPL team.\n\nDumont also noted that the ME-SXR camera builds on the Lab's important\ndiagnostic work at WEST. \"The ME-SXR is only part of a more global\ncontribution of diagnostics from PPPL to CEA/WEST,\" Dumont said, noting the\nhard X-ray camera and the X-ray imaging crystal spectrometer.\n\n\"This collaboration helps us a lot. With this combination of diagnostics, we\nwill be able to perform very accurate measurements in the plasma and control\nit in real-time.\"\n\nProvided by Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory\n\nCitation: Fusion record set for tungsten tokamak WEST (2024, May 6) retrieved\n7 May 2024 from https://phys.org/news/2024-05-fusion-tungsten-tokamak-\nwest.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
