Last year we also began delivering prescription medications in\npartnership with Amazon Pharmacy to customers in College Station. We\u2019ve\nreceived great feedback from customers and communities as we\u2019ve rolled out the\nservice.\n\nWatch a drone delivery take flight in 18 photos from Amazon\u2019s drone facility\nin Texas\n\nGet an inside look at how Amazon\u2019s drone delivery program works today\u2014and how\nwe\u2019re innovating for a future of faster deliveries in more cities.\n\nRead more\n\nWe\u2019re now adding a new location and entering into the next stage of the\nprogram\u2019s evolution. Later this year, drone deliveries are coming to the West\nValley of the Phoenix Metro Area in Arizona.\n\nWith this new location, we\u2019ll be fully integrated into Amazon\u2019s delivery\nnetwork, meaning, for the first time, drones will deploy from facilities next\nto our Same-Day Delivery site in Tolleson. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part\nfulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and\ndeliver products all from one site so we can get packages out to our customers\neven quicker. Our Same-Day Delivery sites are situated close to the large\nmetro areas they serve, which means customers get their orders faster. And\nwith connections to the larger Amazon fulfillment centers nearby, we are able\nto offer Same-Day Delivery on millions of items.\n\nWe\u2019re currently working with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and\nlocal officials in Tolleson to obtain all necessary permissions to conduct\nthese deliveries in Tolleson. Once we\u2019ve received all the necessary approvals,\nwe\u2019ll begin reaching out to customers in the West Valley so they can receive\ndrone deliveries when the service goes live later this year.\n\nI\u2019m the site lead at one of Amazon\u2019s first drone delivery sites. Here are 6\ncool facts about our operations in Texas.\n\nTake a look behind the scenes at the Prime Air drone delivery facility in\nCollege Station, Texas.\n\nRead more\n\n\"As Amazon embarks on the national expansion of its Amazon Drone Delivery\nProgram, we're proud to have their innovative presence in our community. By\nbringing this service to new communities, they're not just delivering goods;\nthey're delivering opportunities and economic growth for all,\u201d said Juan F.\nRodriguez, mayor of Tolleson. \u201cAmazon\u2019s commitment to innovation exemplifies\nthe entrepreneurial spirit that drives our city forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis kind of delivery is the future, and it\u2019s exciting that it will be\nstarting in the Phoenix Metro Area,\u201d said Kate Gallego, mayor of Phoenix. \u201cThe\nshift toward zero-emission package delivery will help us reduce local\npollution and further cement our city as a hotbed for the innovative\ntechnology of tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAs we look to the future and prioritize our resources to continue growing the\nprogram, we've also made the decision to close our delivery site in Lockeford.\nWe'll offer all current employees opportunities at other sites, and will\ncontinue to serve customers in Lockeford with other delivery methods. We want\nto thank the community for all their support and feedback over the past few\nyears. We\u2019ll continue delivering in College Station, Texas, and will open\nfurther U.S. locations in 2025.\n\n## Next steps on the new MK30 drone\n\nOur team is currently conducting flight tests for our new MK30 drone. This new\ndrone includes innovative, safety-critical features that allow it to deliver\npackages to customers with smaller backyards and in more densely populated\nsuburban areas. The MK30 is quieter and can fly twice as far as our current\ndrone. While our current drone flies during clear weather, the new MK30 can\noperate in more diverse weather conditions, including light rain.\n\nWe\u2019re flying the new MK30 drone and putting it through its paces at our indoor\nand outdoor test facilities. We\u2019ll use the data from this process to\ndemonstrate to regulators around the world the reliability of our system. The\nMK30 drone will make deliveries to customers later this year.\n\nWe\u2019ll share photos and videos of our progress as we go, and we look forward to\ncontinuing to learn from customers and communities as we methodically expand\nthis program in months and years to come.\n\nRegister to be notified when drone delivery is available in the West Valley\narea. Our journey continues\u2014stay tuned for updates.\n\n## Learn more about Amazon drone deliveries:\n\n  * Watch a drone delivery take flight in 18 photos from Amazon's drone delivery site in Texas\n  * 11 photos of Amazon\u2019s new Prime Air drone that can fly in light rain and deliver packages up to 5 pounds in under an hour\n  * Amazon is launching ultra-fast drone deliveries in Italy, the UK, and a third location in the U.S.\n\nRelated Tags\n\nDroneDelivery InnovationTransportation\n\n3 min\n\nReading:\n\nAmazon drone delivery is coming to Arizona\n\n  * Facebook Share\n  * Twitter Share\n  * LinkedIn Share\n  * Email Share\n  * Copy\n\nLink copied\n\nTrending news and stories\n\n  1.
