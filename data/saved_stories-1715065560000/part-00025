China has rapidly become a major auto exporter, but tariffs have\nkept cheap Chinese EVs out of the U.S. market \u2014 so far.\n\nSTR/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNew EVs aren't cheap.\n\nAt least, not in the United States. In other parts of the world, bargain\nelectric vehicles from China abound, but a 27.5% tariff has kept those cars\nout of the United States.\n\nArvind Srinivasan, who recently shopped around for an EV under $25,000, feels\nconflicted about that.\n\n\"As a consumer, yeah, I would buy a Chinese EV, probably without question,\" he\nsays. \"But as a person who cares about the country, in that view, I feel like,\nno, we should either tariff or ban them.\"\n\nEven higher tariffs and outright bans are both real possibilities.\n\nThat's because cheap Chinese EVs could be devastating to a key sector of the\nU.S. economy: auto manufacturing. And the Biden administration's climate\nstrategy, which would benefit from cheaper EVs, also prioritizes U.S. jobs.\n\n### Business\n\n### Chinese electric carmakers are taking on Europeans on their own turf \u2014 and\nsucceeding\n\n### Up First\n\n### The Sunday Story: Answering Your Questions About Electric Vehicles\n\nClimate, national security, American jobs: This is why Srinivasan is torn.\nEven if he's not a fan of big auto companies, exactly.\n\n\"At some point, if we don't support U.S. auto manufacturers, [Chinese\nautomakers] are just going to come in, undercut it,\" he says. \"Then we're\ndependent on China for cheap EVs. And I don't think that's sustainable for the\ncountry long term.\"\n\n### Plenty of filet mignon but no hamburger\n\nEV prices have been falling, but cheap ones remain elusive.\n\nThat might sound paradoxical, but steak at a discount costs a lot more than\nhamburger meat. Right now, luxury electric SUVs \u2014 the filet mignon of the\nautomotive world \u2014 are on sale. But small, cheap cars? That hamburger case is\nempty.\n\nWell, almost empty. Srinivasan, who wanted an EV to save on gas, found exactly\none option. After poring over the new and used offerings, he went with a new\nChevy Bolt \u2014 just $23,500 after a tax credit.\n\nEnlarge this image\n\nArvind Srinivasan, pictured with his Chevy Bolt, wished there were more\noptions when he was shopping for an affordable EV. Bhargav Devana/Arvind\nSrinivasan hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nBhargav Devana/Arvind Srinivasan\n\nArvind Srinivasan, pictured with his Chevy Bolt, wished there were more\noptions when he was shopping for an affordable EV.\n\nBhargav Devana/Arvind Srinivasan\n\n\"It was like, 'OK, this car isn't great, but it's cheap,'\" he says. \"No one\nsells anything remotely close to its price target.\"\n\nIn fact, right now, not even Chevy sells anything close. General Motors is\nmoving on from the older battery that powers the modest-sized, never-\nprofitable hatchback. The Bolt is not currently in production.\n\nLarger vehicles carry larger price tags. As companies pour billions of dollars\ninto making electric vehicles, they're trying to offset those huge expenses.\nSo even though EV prices have fallen about 10% from last year, they're still\naveraging about $54,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\n### Business\n\n### EVs won over early adopters, but mainstream buyers aren't along for the\nride yet\n\nCompanies say they're working on cheaper options. Ford has a \"skunkworks\" team\ntackling the project; GM has pledged to bring back the Bolt with a new\nbattery; Stellantis has said a profitable $25,000 EV is key. Tesla, the\nundisputed market leader for EVs, says it's bringing a cheaper model to market\nby next year.\n\nBut they don't have much time to waste.\n\nVolvo, the Swedish carmaker owned by a Chinese company, plans to sell a\nChinese-made EV in the U.S. beginning this summer, at a relatively budget-\nfriendly starting price of under $35,000. (Volvo says it's paying the tariff;\nthe company did not comment when asked about reports that it will be refunded\nthat money in exchange for exporting U.S.-made vehicles.)\n\nEnlarge this image\n\nPeople look at a BYD Seagull at the Bangkok International Motor Show in\nNonthaburi, Thailand, on March 27.

The BYD\nSeagull costs just $10,000 in China.\n\nChinese-made cars used to be a punchline. Economist Sue Helper, who has spent\ndecades tracking globalization and auto manufacturing, remembers seeing BYD\nvehicles a few years ago that were, in a word, \"terrible.\" But she recently\ntook a Seagull for a test drive in a parking lot in Detroit. (They are not\nallowed on U.S. streets.)\n\n\"It's impressive,\" she says. \"It's cute.\"\n\n### The Indicator from Planet Money\n\n### The surprising leader in EVs\n\nThe Seagull would cost more than $10,000 in the U.S., given that it would have\nto be modified to meet U.S. safety standards. But you could double the price\nof the Seagull and it would still be a steal.\n\nIn fact, you could double the price and pay the 27.5% tariff, and it would\nstill undercut every EV for sale in the United States.\n\nWhy? Helper points out that, first, it's a very small car, a rare beast in the\nU.S. these days. And China has economies of scale and clever design.\n\nThere's also, she says, \"the Chinese playbook of 'let's subsidize and repress\nlabor and get ourselves a foothold in an international market and take it\nover.'\"\n\nFor instance, she says, the Chinese government heavily subsidizes China's EV\nindustry to give it an international advantage. Wages in the Chinese auto\nindustry are lower. And some companies in the Chinese auto-supply chain almost\ncertainly use forced labor, or modern-day slavery, according to human rights\ngroups.\n\n### Why aren't cheap Chinese EVs for sale in the U.S.?\n\nNational security concerns and old-fashioned protectionism have kept these\ncars out of the U.S. so far.\n\nWhen president, Donald Trump imposed a heavy tariff on Chinese-made vehicles,\nwhich the Biden administration has extended and could increase.\n\nThis year, the U.S. Commerce Department launched an investigation into whether\nChinese vehicles' navigation and communication features could spy on\nAmericans.\n\nThe department's investigation could result in a prohibition on certain\nChinese-made vehicles. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has proposed hiking tariffs on\nChinese vehicles, while Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, has proposed an outright\nban.\n\n### Business\n\n### The $7,500 tax credit for electric cars keeps changing. Here's how to get\nit now\n\nScott Paul of the Alliance for American Manufacturing is lobbying for higher\ntariffs and says he'd back an outright ban. His organization represents\nunionized steelworkers and companies in the auto-supply chain.\n\n\"We've seen this play out in the past in other industries,\" he says. \"We need\nto get ahead of this instead of responding to it after the fact, when we're\njust cleaning up the mess and we're seeing these factories wiped out, these\njobs displaced and these communities devastated.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a different \"Alliance\" \u2014 the Alliance for Automotive Innovation,\nwhich represents automakers \u2014 also recognizes the risk but couches it\ndifferently.\n\n\"The overall competitiveness of the auto industry in the U.S. will be harmed\nif heavily subsidized Chinese vehicles can be sold at below-market prices to\nU.S. consumers,\" John Bozzella, the president of the Alliance for Automotive\nInnovation, told NPR in a statement. The group declined to state a position on\nbanning Chinese autos.\n\nThere's good reason for the more measured tone: Major automakers operate\nglobally, not just in the United States. China is a rival, sure, but it's also\nthe world's largest auto market, as well as a major supplier. As Bozzella has\npreviously put it, where China is seen by policymakers as \"binary\" \u2014 good or\nbad, friend or foe \u2014 for automakers, \"'China' is complicated.\"\n\n### Climate impacts are complicated too\n\nBonnie Dixon, another frustrated car shopper, is also torn over Chinese EVs.\n\nEnlarge this image\n\nBonnie Dixon, pictured with her 1997 Ford Ranger, drives only about once a\nweek. When she does, she would prefer to be driving a zero-emission vehicle.\nBut she can't find a new one in her budget.

When she does, she would prefer to be driving a zero-emission vehicle.\nBut she can't find a new one in her budget.\n\nBonnie Dixon\n\nDixon, who works part time as a research scientist and is on a tight budget,\ndrives an older gas pickup she'd love to swap for a zero-emission car. She's\nwary of used cars so is looking at new ones. She needs a car capable of\ndriving long distances \u2014 she can't have a short-range EV that works only\naround town. New, affordable, long range: no dice.\n\nShe doesn't know much about the politics of tariffs, she says. \"What I am\naware of is just the great urgency of needing to reduce carbon emissions.\"\n\nIf she could buy a Chinese EV, wouldn't that help the planet?\n\nThe answer, according to some climate advocates, is complicated.\n\nThey argue that buying time for U.S. automakers to change \u2014 to make more EVs,\nat cheaper prices, with cleaner supply chains \u2014 could be better for the\nclimate in the long run.\n\n### Climate\n\n### In a boost for EVs, EPA finalizes strict new limits on tailpipe emissions\n\n### Climate\n\n### What biologists see from the shores of the drying Great Salt Lake\n\n### Climate\n\n### The human cost of climate-related disasters is acutely undercounted, new\nstudy says\n\n\"We are trying to move the market so that all automakers are making vehicles\nas sustainably as possible,\" says Katherine Garc\u00eda of the Sierra Club. And\nwhen it comes to things like greener steel and electricity, American companies\nrank much better than Chinese ones. Meanwhile, labor groups and green groups\nhave united around the argument that decarbonizing will be good for the planet\nand U.S. workers.\n\nGarc\u00eda emphasized that people can take public transit, bike and drive used EVs\nto help fight climate change. But she also sees an urgent need for cheaper new\nEVs \u2014 just maybe not cheap Chinese EVs.\n\nIt's a position that resonates with Dixon.\n\n\"Definitely the best solution would be if we could build them in the U.S.,\"\nDixon says. \"That's what I'm hoping \u2014 that the U.S. car manufacturers will get\ntheir act together and produce these more affordable EVs that we need.\"\n\nIn the meantime, when she needs to drive, she hops in her old gas pickup.\n\n  * auto industry\n  * China\n  * vehicles\n  * electric vehicles\n  * EVs\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 169 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
