For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).\n\nVendors 659\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data,\nsuch as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your\ndevice type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for\nexample, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\n\nExamples:\n\n  * A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.\n  * A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors 600\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.\n  * An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors 488\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n  * A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors 483\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you\nsubmit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with\nother information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (which might for example include possible\ninterests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to\npresent content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests,\nsuch as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is\neven easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).\n  * You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.\n\nVendors 218\n\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content\npersonalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other\nservices (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible\ninterests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the\norder in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to\nfind (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.\n  * You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.\n\nVendors 190\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n  * You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an \u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.\n\nVendors 698\n\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact\nwith it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g.\nreached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance,\nwhether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a\nproduct description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you\nvisit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-\nadvertising) content that is shown to you.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.\n  * You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.\n\nVendors 352\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nExamples:\n\n  * The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n  * An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors 441\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.\n  * An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.\n\nVendors 525\n\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as\nthe website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type,\nor which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to\nlimit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\n\nExamples:\n\n  * A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school\u2019s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).\n  * A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.\n\nVendors 117\n\nSpecial Purposes2\n\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly\nfraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots),\nand ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be\nused to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may\nencounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with\nthem.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites.

Often described as a logical treatment of a\nsubject fundamentally resistant to scientific analysis, the emergence of\nBitcoin and its acceptance in the market has many Austrians rightly cackling\nat a real-world proof of the efficacy of the school.\n\nAllen Farrington is a writer and investor in bitcoin. He cowrote \"Bitcoin Is\nVenice\" and \"Only The Strong Survive,\" and is a cofounder of Axiom, a bitcoin-\nfocused venture firm. A version of this essay was originally published on the\nAxiom website.\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\nHong Kong Gives Initial Bitcoin, Ether ETF Approval, Issuers Say\n\nShare\n\nNext\n\nStay\n\nThis essay is part of CoinDesk\u2019s \u201cFuture of Bitcoin\u201d package published to\ncoincide with the fourth Bitcoin \u201chalving\u201d in April 2024.\n\nOn which note, Mises\u2019 monumental \"The Theory of Money and Credit\" is essential\nreading for any bitcoiner, and Menger\u2019s \"On the Origins of Money\" might be the\nsingle best prose answer to the preceding question. More a bitcoiner himself\nthan an Austrian \u2013 or at the very least a polymath \u2013 Nick Szabo\u2019s writing is\nessential reading not only for bitcoiners, but for anybody struggling to\nunderstand what on earth is going on in the world. Contemporary Austrian\neconomist Rahim Taghizadegan has indeed credited Szabo\u2019s thesis in \"Shelling\nOut\" as a novel contribution to the school.\n\nThat said, we do not think of Axiom as a \u201cmoney business\u201d \u2013 and nor does\nanybody else, for that matter. We operate in capital markets, and I have\npersonally found it impossible in the past few months to set up a capital\nmarkets business without thinking about the nature of capital. The reader will\nnot be surprised in the least to learn I believe there is an intimate\nconnection to money, and hence that capital on a \"Bitcoin Standard\" is likely\nto be every bit as different as money, and possibly more so.\n\nJoseph Schumpeter\u2019s critique of the nonsense of \u201cequilibrium\u201d as leaving no\nspace for entrepreneurship is as much about capital as anything else. Without\nentrepreneurs, there is little to distinguish productive capital from mere\nassets: animate matter, rich with potential, from mere inanimate stuff. One of\nthe many lessons of Israel Kirzner\u2019s analysis of the conceptual links between\ncompetition and entrepreneurship is to force the realization that capital is\nboth heterogeneous and unavoidably the product of human creativity. This\nheterogeneity is arguably the soundest conceptual grounding, or the best\nformulated axiom, for a non-circular definition of \u201cliquidity.\u201d The perfectly\nliquid capital is money, which is perfectly homogeneous. Money bears no\nuncertainty because it is the standard of value against which uncertain\nendeavors are to be measured. The role of the entrepreneur is to embrace\nuncertainty by accumulating capital; putting it to heterogeneous use in the\ncreative and competitive pursuit of the satisfaction of the value of others.\n\nSo far, so simple \u2013 and so seemingly axiomatic. But if you are reading this\nyou are most likely interested in Bitcoin, and if you have been kind enough to\ninvest in Axiom Venture Fund I then you most certainly believe that we are\nstill early. And so, I put it to the reader that this \u2013 or, perhaps, the\nconsequences of this \u2013 is not at all widely understood.\n\nThere are plenty of definitions of capital out there, but my favorite\ndefinition is not at all technical and is not from an Austrian. It is that of\nHernando de Soto. It is not even a \u201cdefinition,\u201d per se, but more of an image.\nThis is exactly why I like it. In the dismal science, rhetorical flourish is\nhard to come by \u2013 especially while remaining somewhat accurate and without\nspiraling into statist agitprop.\n\nIn his fantastic \"The Mystery of Capital\", de Soto calls capital, economic\npotential energy. To my mind, this helpfully emphasizes two things:\n\n  1. that work has been done, but the fruits of that work have not been realized, and;\n\n  2. that they can be realized, with intention \u2013 with human action\n\nIt is within our power, not as homo economici, but as individual thinking\nhumans, to tap this reserve of potential energy based on what we value. It is\nnot the preserve of the omniscient, omnipotent capital tsar who allocates all\ncapital from a palace in the sky. Nor is Hayek obsoleted by advances in\nartificial intelligence, to cite exactly some such fashionable statist\nagitprop. It is the entrepreneur that is the motor of the world. She thinks as\nan individual; she acts in the moment; and she allocates at the margin.\n\nSteve Jobs, an entrepreneur if ever there was one, once famously said,\n\n\u201cI think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is\nthat we\u2019re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of\nlocomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy\nto move a kilometer. And humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing,\nabout a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the\ncrown of creation. So, that didn\u2019t look so good. But, then somebody at\nScientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a\nman on a bicycle. And a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the\ncondor away, completely off the top of the charts. And that\u2019s what a computer\nis to me. What a computer is to me is it\u2019s the most remarkable tool that we\u2019ve\never come up with, and it\u2019s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.\"\n\nThis is usually understood as commentary on technology, but I think it is more\nabout capital. A less romantic framing, perhaps, than \u201ceconomic potential\nenergy,\u201d capital is tools. Jobs\u2019 point is just how potent software is as a\nform of capital. But ultimately all capital magnifies the desirability of the\noutput of some exertion of time and energy. A bicycle is one example, and a\ncomputer is another. At the risk of mixing metaphors, capital is the bicycle\nof labor; of time, of effort, and of the grind to produce value by hand.\n\nCapital is tools.\n\n## 2\\. More things, cheaper things, new things\n\nWhat does money have to do with all this? The non-answer is to say that money\nis the most liquid form of capital, but that is to subscribe to a circular\nexplanation. If by \u201cliquid\u201d we simply mean, \u201cthe time and difficulty required\nto transform something into money,\u201d then money can be transformed into money\nin zero time and with zero difficulty, hence it must be maximally liquid. We\nhave both stated and proven a tautology. The fiat economists would be proud*.\n\nI suggest we attempt to invert this understanding of liquidity. Instead of\ntrying to capture how easily and quickly we can convert capital into money,\nwhat if what we meant was how easily and quickly we can convert money into\ncapital?\n\nOkay, why? Is this even different or am I just playing with words?\n\nI think it is different because it forces us to think about what it is we\nreally want; what we want is wealth. We want more things, cheaper things and\nnew things. And we want the comfort and security of knowing we will be able to\nproduce these things far into the future. We don\u2019t want one more thing, one\ncheaper thing and one new thing \u2013 and we don\u2019t even necessarily want any\nthings right now. We want the potential to create more, cheaper and new.\n\nSee also: The Blockchain Industry Must Build for the Real Needs of Real People\n\nMoney does none of this. Money is not wealth. Money is a claim on wealth \u2013\nmoney is liquid; it is salable. It is the maximally efficient way of\ncommunicating the relative value of things we really want. But it is only\nitself valuable because all these other things it helps us value either exist\nin the first place, or else could exist, pending our intentional, directed\neffort to allocate time and energy to bringing them into existence.\n\nMoney is neither sufficient nor necessary for wealth. But capital arguably is.\nReal wealth is illiquid, and the liquidity of money is useful first and\nforemost because it makes it far easier and more efficient to allocate capital\nthan otherwise.\n\nAnother way of thinking about all this is that money is time. More\nspecifically, money is time now. But capital is something different: capital\nis the cumulative product of having decided not to consume today but to make\nmore, cheaper, and newer the future ability to consume. Capital is all time\never. I do not believe it is appropriate to propose that people should want\nonly to consume in the future \u2013 that is none of my business. But we can\napproach the same issue more subtly: if you wanted to forego consumption and\nmaximize your potential to later consume, could you? What are your incentives\neither way?\n\nTo do our best to minimize the economics jargon once again, we might simply\nask: what are you going to do with your time? Are you going to create or\nconsume?\n\nAnd how do the characteristics of money, as the salable representation of that\ntime, influence your decision? I sincerely believe that this is the killer app\nfor Bitcoin: pricing capital. If there were ever a time to say that Bitcoin\nFixes This, here it is.\n\n*Note, by the way, that a tautology cannot be an axiom, as it trivially implies all and only every other tautology as its theorems. Add one tautology to your axioms and you may as well add them all. Nothing is changed, and likely nothing is understood, either. Real axioms require some understanding of the subject matter under exploration.\n\n## 3\\. Stocks and flows\n\nBut is this even broken? Can\u2019t we price capital now?\n\nWe can, but my goodness is it difficult! If you look at what has happened in\ncapital markets over the last fifteen years, at least, this will become\nclearer and clearer.\n\nUntil very recently I worked in this world. Indeed, it was the only (adult)\njob I have ever had besides this one. I enjoyed it greatly and am grateful for\nhaving the opportunity to study and learn as I did. In this role, I chipped in\nhere and there teaching the new hires the basics of financial theory. What I\ndreamed up to teach them I was pitching at folks who I assumed were extremely\nintelligent but who had no experience of economics or finance. I found that an\ninvaluable tool to explore this was by using the concepts of stocks and flows.\n\nBelow is a cartoon version of a balance sheet and an income statement, in\nwhich I attempt to visually convey how the two evolve over time (see next\npage). In that pedagogical context, I was trying to explain as much from first\nprinciples as possible the difference between returns and what is commonly\ncalled \u201cgrowth\u201d but is really just an \u201cincrease.\u201d\n\n(Allen Farrington/Axiom)\n\nAll this is intended to represent the cycle of capital through a business. You\nget liquid, homogeneous capital (money), you transform it into illiquid,\nheterogeneous capital (productive assets), to create a product, keeping a\nlittle liquid to cover the costs of delivering the product; and if you profit,\nthat means you get to go again and create even more capital, except that this\ntime you get to fund it yourself.\n\nIn the context of financial analysis, one of the key implications I intended\nto communicate with this principle is that the measure of success is not that\nthe yellow number goes up, and it\u2019s not even that the dark blue number goes\nup. It\u2019s that the dark blue to purple ratio stays high. Because that is the\nonly sustainable way that the orange number can go up. And this is where\nwealth comes from. Everything else here is valuable only insofar as it lets us\ndo this efficiently.\n\nBut, of course, in the world of quarterly, profit and loss (P&L) finance,\nnobody cares. They want the yellow number to go up at all costs \u2013 which might\nbe a good thing, but it might not \u2013 and in particular they want the ratio of\nsuccessive yellow numbers to go up. They call this ratio \u201cgrowth,\u201d even though\nit is really an \u201cincrease.\u201d It is a dimensionless ratio of one flow to\nanother. A real \u201cgrowth rate\u201d has the dimensions of one over time, like the\nratio of profit over a period to its funding at the start of that period, or\ndark blue to purple above. The reader can hopefully see that what this ratio\ncaptures is the real, causal, time-dependent process by which the ability to\nproduce grows.\n\nWe want the potential to create more, cheaper and new.\n\nThis misunderstanding \u2013 that we should care about short-term flows rather than\nlong-term rates of return on stocks \u2013 I would say is basically the original\nsin of fiat finance and fiat economics. It is how you get the idea that, \u201cwe\nneed to stimulate the economy\u201d; it\u2019s why you might think there is nothing\nwrong with gutting manufacturing capabilities and energy infrastructure\nbecause services are higher margin and \u201cscale better\u201d; it\u2019s how you end up\nfoaming at the mouth over \u201cquarterly earnings,\u201d as if any meaningful\ninvestment project could take three months and as if the measure of its\nsuccess would be a flow and not a stock.\n\nIt\u2019s also how you get the idea that trading jpegs is productive, or that the\nproduct of capital accumulation should be artificial scarcity rather than\nabundance; not more and cheaper but capped and expensive. It\u2019s how you think\nthat if you create a simulacrum of wealth, at no cost, real wealth can somehow\nfollow just because you have bootstrapped an idea. Not productive capacity:\nnot the potential to create more, cheaper and new; but claims on wealth that\nyou cross your fingers somebody else will actually work to create. And it\u2019s\nhow you end up with one of the greatest misallocations of capital in the\nhistory of venture capital and possibly in the history of capital markets.\n\nReal capital is scarce \u2013 precious, even. It is, after all, accumulated time.\nif it is going towards something stupid and short-termist, then it isn\u2019t going\ntowards anything intelligent and long-termist. If the money we use to decide\nhow to allocate capital does not reflect this scarcity, we will think there is\nno cost to short-termism. The incentive here is not wealth, it\u2019s just profit.\nIt is not a stock, it\u2019s just a flow. It is not to create tools, it\u2019s just to\ndismantle them and trade the parts for fun.\n\n## 4\\. The point of profit\n\nThe reader might wonder if there is anything really wrong with that? Am I\nrevealing a paternalistic pedantry of no clear relation to economics? Greed Is\nGood, right? What is the point of investing in the first place if it is not to\nprofit? Isn\u2019t profit a marker \u2013 nay, the marker \u2013 of entrepreneurial success\nand sustainable economic contribution?\n\nSee also: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits Highest Level Since Bitcoin's 2021\nHigh\n\nAs a final tease, I would put forward that a far better contentious proverb to\nemploy here than Gordon Gekko\u2019s motto would be from the New Testament of the\nKing James Bible, in which we are counseled that, the love of money is the\nroot of all evil. Unfortunately, this is commonly misquoted as, money is the\nroot of all evil, which does a dire disservice to the message. The two could\nhardly be more different. It would be a little odd for the general partner of\na bitcoin-focused financial services firm to believe that money is the root of\nall evil, and yet I have a great deal of sympathy for 1 Timothy 6:10. I think\nit can even be a potent tool to distinguish not the technology but the\ncultures of Bitcoin and crypto, and Bitcoin and fiat.\n\nI believe it is completely backwards to think that the point of investing is\nprofit. The point of profit is investing.\n\nMoney means nothing without the capital, and the products of capital, that it\nprices. We like to think it means \u201cour time,\u201d which is true to an extent, but\nour time is not valuable in the slightest without the stocks of capital that\nmultiply its productivity. Profit means nothing beyond the means to continue\ncompounding capital in a truly independent manner. There is capital employed\nwithout profit, but there is no profit without capital employed. Moreover,\nprofit is the informational signal that the way you are creating capital is\nvalued by others. Profits are great, but returns are better.\n\nTo ground this more in everyday experience: if you knew your money was going\nto be more valuable in the future, how would you invest?\n\nThe logical approach would be to invest such that your return, while still\ncompounding in value, would come as late as possible. You want your return as\nfar in the future as it can be, partly because the later it comes the more\nvalue it will have compounded. But partly also because that is more efficient\nthan constantly having to think of new projects, developing new skills,\ntesting new markets and so on.\n\nThis means that at a personal level, you are incentivized to develop skills as\nspecific as possible, crystallize the value of these skills by creating\ncapital as heterogeneous and illiquid as possible, and spend as much time as\npossible thinking about deepening these skills and crystallizing this value.\n\nBut what if your money was going to be less valuable in the future? Well, all\nof that would be flipped. You would want your return as soon as possible and\nyou\u2019d want the optionality of new projects and new markets, which means you\nare incentivized to develop skills as general as possible and hold capital as\nliquid and homogeneous as possible.\n\nThis would mean you are incentivized to stay on top of everything happening in\nthe immediate term, to trade around it, and to spend little time \u2013 or no time\n\u2013 focusing on the long term. Any wealth you do own or that you can create, you\nreally ought to financialize to increase its liquidity. Better yet, you ought\nto financialize somebody else\u2019s wealth. Even better still, you ought to\nleverage somebody else\u2019s financialized wealth \u2013 force others to leverage to\ncompete, misallocate more capital or even start to consume it, create more\nmoney and ensure everybody\u2019s money will be less valuable in the future \u2013 so we\ncan start this merry-go-round all over again.\n\nIn the latter, as long as you profit, everything is fine. In fact, if you have\nsufficient capability to financialize, you don\u2019t even need profit now. You can\npromise endless future profits, \u201cgrow\u201d (i.e., \u201cincrease\u201d), sell the rights to\nthem, and move on. Everything becomes reducible to its immediate flows. But as\nyou gradually strip away your own and everybody else\u2019s capital \u2013 as you\ndismantle, trade, and consume every tool \u2013 you will find returns to be more\nand more elusive and, eventually, impossible. The only important question\nbecomes, who is holding the bag?\n\nBitcoin fixes this. Bitcoin forces us to think first and foremost about the\nstock. It enables us to think far more clearly than we would otherwise about\nthe potential to create more things, cheaper things, and new things. This is\nno mere thought experiment, it is happening around us, at a bewilderingly\naccelerating rate. It\u2019s happening in mining, in the Lightning Network, in\nNostr right now. And in the long run? We wouldn\u2019t dare be so arrogant as to\nsuggest what opportunities can be known. Properly incentivized, purposeful,\nacting humans are nothing if not creative, and Bitcoin is nothing if not an\ninducement to create ...\n\n## 5\\. Bitcoin\u2019s killer app\n\nWhilst it is technically correct to say, \u201cBitcoin mining secures the network,\u201d\nI find this explanation to be dry. We might channel my earlier articulated\nappreciation of de Soto and observe there is a difference between a definition\nthat is technically accurate and one that is rhetorically effective. The hash\nrate, after all, is a flow. I would argue a more imaginative conception of the\nglobal network of Bitcoin miners is as a distributed network of capital \u2013 a\nstock, and a tool \u2013 that earns a return which is contingent on energy\nefficiency, and so which incentivizes more energy, cheaper energy and new\nenergy.\n\nMore energy because Bitcoin pays for waste and for load balancing. This\ncreates extra profit \u2013 not to be cackled over by fat cat executives but to be\nreinvested in heterogeneous capital to utilize yet more wasted energy and\nincrease productive output. Cheaper energy because this reinvestment will\nenable efficiency gains, supplementing the returns of energy infrastructure,\nand will in turn lead to deflation as it is absorbed by the market. And new\nenergy because Bitcoin makes it possible to exploit stranded resources with\nonly an internet connection instead of costly transmission infrastructure.\n\nThe Lightning Network may be explained in equally dry terms of \u201csolving\nBitcoin\u2019s scalability.\u201d And once again, this is not incorrect, but neither is\nit exciting. It is once again affirming that this has a technical purpose and\nis more than just a toy. But it is a purpose that focuses on flows rather than\nstocks. Instead, we might consider it a distributed network of heterogenous\ncapital allocation that generates a return contingent on enabling payment\nefficiency. The consequence is more payments, cheaper payments, and new\npayments.\n\nMore payments because fiat payment rails have counterparty risk,\njurisdictional firewalls, and lower bounds on economically rational\ntransferable value \u2013 all of which are absent in the Lightning Network. Cheaper\npayments because the network is robust, antifragile and decentralized, and\nevery node operates as a kind of cellularly automatous market maker in\nliquidity, meaning routing is competitive and gross costs are driven down, as\nopposed to the network as a whole seeking to profit maximize by holding costs\nup. And new payments because all of this enables such innovations as \u201cpayment\nstreaming\u201d \u2013 very small payments at very short intervals so as to proxy a\ncontinuous flow \u2013 and programmable exchange \u2013 APIs for exchanging proprietary\ncomputational resources directly for bearer value in an automated manner\nrather than at the manual behest of a human.\n\nNostr has often been characterized as a \u201cTwitter alternative.\u201d This is\naccurate enough in terms of the first use case to gain any major traction. But\nit is woefully unimaginative in terms of how widely Nostr could come to be\nutilized. Instead, we might consider it a distributed means of harnessing the\nLightning Network to align the subjective economic valuation of data with the\nphysical cost of the infrastructure facilitating its broadcast. The\nconsequence is more communications, cheaper communications and new\ncommunications.\n\nSee also: Nostr: A Decentralized Censorship-Resistant Twitter\n\nMore communications because the user experience of traditional online\ncommunication networks is subject to the design considerations of their\noperators, whereas the free and open-source nature of the Nostr protocol is\nsuch that anybody can build a client or integrate the protocol into an app to\ncreate whatever experience they want. Cheaper communications because, via\nLightning, the signal of value is directly and bidirectionally expressed in\nthe act of communicating between sender, router and receiver. Building\nservices on Nostr is significantly cheaper than any prior alternative because\nthe network is open and can be tapped into without first building a network\neffect, and its supporting infrastructure, from scratch. And from the users\u2019\nperspective, while legacy social networks are superficially \u201cfree,\u201d the adage\nof, \u201cif the service is free, the product is you,\u201d is healthily absent in\nNostr, enabling the ability to be paid for valuable contribution as well as to\npay for what is valued, in a disintermediated fashion. And new communications\nbecause Nostr doesn\u2019t rely on any centralized entity capable of shutting down\npolitically inconvenient content.\n\nLet us contrast these heterogeneous, illiquid tools to what we have become\nused to under fiat. We get worse things and more expensive things, and\nalthough it is true that we get more things, one has to wonder what kind of\nthing such an intense pressure to consume drives us to produce more of. I\u2019m\nnot convinced it is worth it. If the source of \u201cmore\u201d is pulling forward value\nfrom the future that we have no intention of repaying and allocating time\ntowards this activity and away from experiments in the realm of the cheaper\nand the new, then it is not something I am inclined to celebrate. If the value\nwe believe we have concocted is merely a securitization that makes more liquid\na representation of the illiquid, but does not make anything illiquid, it is\nnot something I am inclined to support. The farmer can always boost\nconsumption by eating seed rather than planting it, or by selling that which\nhe has not yet produced. One can always consume more if one is willing to\nconsume capital. But I\u2019d rather we create it.\n\nThis is what we would expect to flourish from real capital accumulation. The\npotential for more things, cheaper things, and newer things that we can rely\non if needed, but which we don\u2019t need to consume. Of course, we still have\nscarce time with which to decide what kind of capital to create, and so the\nprice of capital is critically important as well. I believe that the price of\ncapital is Bitcoin\u2019s killer app. Bitcoin fixes this.\n\nI think there is a plausible argument that this is axiomatically true. Capital\nis the weave in the fabric of economic life. If Bitcoin fixes capital, then\nBitcoin truly does fix everything. Is this our axiom? For all X, Bitcoin fixes\nX? Is this the mystery of capital?\n\nSure, but we can go further still. Bitcoin is not an end, but a means. Like\nall capital, it is a tool to serve humans, and to enable human flourishing.\nAbove even its effect on capital we must hold at the front of our minds its\neffect on people. A tool does not wield itself. Nor does a business\nspontaneously emerge. A skilled technician wields a tool and an entrepreneur\nbuilds a business. To echo Kirzner, this is a perfectly competitive market.\nAll it takes is an idea and the will to pursue it. Brains and guts. And so, we\ncan echo de Soto once more as well, jettison technical jargon one final time,\nand end on a rhetorical flourish.
