American Civil\nLiberties Union\n\nFootage posted online from the meet showed at least five girls from a rival\nschool stepping up to the plate and then refusing to take their throw in a\nshow of protest.\n\nTheir results were marked down as \u201cno distance.\u201d\n\nThe protest unfolded just days after a federal appeals court ruled Pepper-\nJackson couldn\u2019t be banned from participating in cross-country running and\ntrack with other girls.\n\n## Explore More\n\n### Biden\u2019s new Title IX rules prove it\u2019s time for the DOE to be DOA\n\n### Medicine shuns gender detransitioners like me \u2014 but we deserve to be heard\nand helped\n\n### Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital leaves Texas after investigation over gender\ntransition medication for minors: AG\n\nThe eighth-grader, who takes puberty-blocking medication and estrogen hormone\ntherapy, has identified as a girl since elementary school.\n\nFormer collegiate swimmer-turned-activist Riley Gaines, who has been an\noutspoken critic of trans athletes participating in girls\u2019 sporting events,\nwas among those to lead the outrage over Pepper-Jackson\u2019s most recent win.\n\n\u201cFive middle school female athletes in West Virginia refuse to throw shot put\nagainst male, Becky Pepper-Jackson. This comes just 2 days after the Fourth\nCircuit Court of Appeals blocked the WV law that says you must compete in the\ncategory that matches your sex,\u201d Gaines tweeted.\n\n4\n\nFootage posted online from the meet showed at least five girls from a rival\nschool stepping up to the plate and then refusing to take their throw.\n@Riley_Gaines_/X\n\n4\n\nThe girls staged the protest just days after a federal appeals court ruled\nPepper-Jackson couldn\u2019t be banned from participating in track events with\nother girls. @Riley_Gaines_/X\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day when 13-14yr old girls have to be the adults in the room, but\nI couldn\u2019t be more inspired by and proud of these girls. Enough is enough. The\ntide is turning!\u201d\n\nThe ruling Tuesday from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals blocked a West\nVirginia law banning transgender girls from playing on girls\u2019 sports teams,\nwhich was signed into law by Republican Gov. Jim Justice in 2021.\n\nThe court ruled the law couldn\u2019t lawfully be applied to the eighth-grader.\n\n4\n\nBecky Pepper-Jackson, who takes puberty-blocking medication and estrogen\nhormone therapy, has identified as a girl since elementary school. Getty\nImages for Lambda Legal\n\nJudge Toby Heytens wrote that offering her a \u201cchoice\u201d between not\nparticipating in sports and participating only on boys teams \u201cis no real\nchoice at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe defendants cannot expect that B.P.J. will countermand her social\ntransition, her medical treatment, and all the work she has done with her\nschools, teachers, and coaches for nearly half her life by introducing herself\nto teammates, coaches, and even opponents as a boy,\u201d Heytens wrote.\n\nIn finding that the law violated Title IX when applied to the 13-year-old, the\ncourt pointed to the fact she had been publicly living as a girl for more than\nfive years and changed her name.\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nThe state of West Virginia, too, had issued her a birth certificate listing\nher as female, the judge noted.\n\nIn the wake of last week\u2019s ruling, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick\nMorrisey, a Republican, said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in the decision.\n\n\u201cI will keep fighting to safeguard Title IX. We must keep working to protect\nwomen\u2019s sports so that women\u2019s safety is secured and girls have a truly fair\nplaying field,\u201d the attorney general said. \u201cWe know the law is correct and\nwill use every available tool to defend it.\u201d\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * track & field\n  * transgender\n  * west virginia\n  * 4/22/24\n\nRead Next All the revelations from National Enquirer boss' testimony...\n\n#### Trending Now in US News\n\n  * This story has been shared 55,681 times. 55,681\n\n### Pro-terror protesters smash their way into Columbia's Hamilton Hall, take\nover building in latest campus chaos\n\n  * This story has been shared 53,256 times. 53,256\n\n### Bob Menendez's wife was reported missing to cops by her other lover during\nsecret trip with senator\n\n  * This story has been shared 35,701 times. 35,701\n\n### Father, daughter complain about 'pimples' on new house but builder won't\nfix them since 'it\u2019s not a manufacturer\u2019s problem'\n\n  * This story has been shared 26,010 times. 26,010\n\n### Parking valet, 26, accused of snatching Slack co-founder's kid is charged\nwith unlawful intercourse with a minor\n\n## Now on Page Six\n\n  * ### Jeff Bridges shares health update 3 years after coming \u2018pretty close to dying\u2019\n\n  * ### How \u2018American Idol\u2019 honored Mandisa after Season 5 contestant\u2019s death at 47\n\n  * ### Jon Bon Jovi admits he \u2018got away with murder\u2019 in Dorothea Hurley marriage: I had \u2018100 girls in my life\u2019\n\nSee All\n\n#### Video\n\n  * ### Student waves giant Israeli flag as protests continue at Columbia University\n\n## Now on Decider\n\n  * ### Whoopi Goldberg Accuses \u2018The View\u2019 Producer Of \u201cSide-Eyeing\u201d Her After She Promised Not To Speak About Israel-Palestine Protests: \u201cHe\u2019s Starting To Get Annoyed\u201d\n\n  * Bill Maher Accuses Most Activists Of Being Narcissists On \u2018Real Time\u2019\n  * \u2018Anyone But You\u2019s Big Sex Scene Finds Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell Steaming Up a Shower\n  * Ellen DeGeneres Says She \u201cHated\u201d The Way \u2018The Ellen DeGeneres Show\u2019 Ended: \u201cIt Was Devastating\u201d\n\nSee All\n\n## Covers\n\n### Today's Cover\n\n#### Front Cover Back Cover\n\n#### Flip for back cover\n\n### Browse Covers\n\nBecky Pepper-Jackson, 13, took first place at the Harrison County\nChampionships track meet in West Virginia last Thursday with a 32-foot throw\n-- three feet more than the second-place competitor, records show.
