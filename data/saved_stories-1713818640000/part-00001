It would be Realities\nOf Your Industry 101, because we don\u2019t teach them and this results in lots of\nunnecessary pain and suffering. This post aspires to be README.txt for your\ncareer as a young engineer. The goal is to make you happy, by filling in the\ngaps in your education regarding how the \u201creal world\u201d actually works. It took\nme about ten years and a lot of suffering to figure out some of this, starting\nfrom \u201cfairly bright engineer with low self-confidence and zero practical\nknowledge of business.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t trust this as the definitive guide, but\nhopefully it will provide value over what your college Career Center isn\u2019t\ntelling you.\n\n90% of programming jobs are in creating Line of Business software: Economics\n101: the price for anything (including you) is a function of the supply of it\nand demand for it. Let\u2019s talk about the demand side first. Most software is\nnot sold in boxes, available on the Internet, or downloaded from the App\nStore. Most software is boring one-off applications in corporations, under-\ngirding every imaginable facet of the global economy. It tracks expenses, it\noptimizes shipping costs, it assists the accounting department in preparing\nprojections, it helps design new widgets, it prices insurance policies, it\nflags orders for manual review by the fraud department, etc etc. Software\nsolves business problems. Software often solves business problems despite\nbeing soul-crushingly boring and of minimal technical complexity. For example,\nconsider an internal travel expense reporting form. Across a company with\n2,000 employees, that might save 5,000 man-hours a year (at an average fully-\nloaded cost of $50 an hour) versus handling expenses on paper, for a savings\nof $250,000 a year. It does not matter to the company that the reporting form\nis the world\u2019s simplest CRUD app, it only matters that it either saves the\ncompany costs or generates additional revenue.\n\nThere are companies which create software which actually gets used by\ncustomers, which describes almost everything that you probably think of when\nyou think of software. It is unlikely that you will work at one unless you\nwork towards making this happen. Even if you actually work at one, many of the\nprogrammers there do not work on customer-facing software, either.\n\nEngineers are hired to create business value, not to program things:\nBusinesses do things for irrational and political reasons all the time (see\nbelow), but in the main they converge on doing things which increase revenue\nor reduce costs. Status in well-run businesses generally is awarded to people\nwho successfully take credit for doing one of these things. (That can, but\ndoes not necessarily, entail actually doing them.) The person who has decided\nto bring on one more engineer is not doing it because they love having a geek\naround the room, they are doing it because adding the geek allows them to\ncomplete a project (or projects) which will add revenue or decrease costs.\nProducing beautiful software is not a goal. Solving complex technical problems\nis not a goal. Writing bug-free code is not a goal. Using sexy programming\nlanguages is not a goal. Add revenue. Reduce costs. Those are your only goals.\n\nPeter Drucker \u2014 you haven\u2019t heard of him, but he is a prophet among people who\nsign checks \u2014 came up with the terms Profit Center and Cost Center. Profit\nCenters are the part of an organization that bring in the bacon: partners at\nlaw firms, sales at enterprise software companies, \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d\non Wall Street, etc etc. Cost Centers are, well, everybody else. You really\nwant to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages,\nmore respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you. It\nisn\u2019t hard: a bright high schooler, given a paragraph-long description of a\nbusiness, can usually identify where the Profit Center is. If you want to work\nthere, work for that. If you can\u2019t, either a) work elsewhere or b) engineer\nyour transfer after joining the company.\n\nEngineers in particular are usually very highly paid Cost Centers, which sets\nMBA\u2019s optimization antennae to twitching. This is what brings us wonderful\nideas like outsourcing, which is \u201cLet\u2019s replace really expensive Cost Centers\nwho do some magic which we kinda need but don\u2019t really care about with less\nexpensive Cost Centers in a lower wage country\u201d. (Quick sidenote: You can\nabsolutely ignore outsourcing as a career threat if you read the rest of this\nguide.) Nobody ever outsources Profit Centers. Attempting to do so would be\nthe setup for MBA humor. It\u2019s like suggesting replacing your source control\nsystem with a bunch of copies maintained on floppy disks.\n\nDon\u2019t call yourself a programmer: \u201cProgrammer\u201d sounds like \u201canomalously high-\ncost peon who types some mumbo-jumbo into some other mumbo-jumbo.\u201d If you call\nyourself a programmer, someone is already working on a way to get you fired.\nYou know Salesforce, widely perceived among engineers to be a Software as a\nServices company? Their motto and sales point is \u201cNo Software\u201d, which conveys\nto their actual customers \u201cYou know those programmers you have working on your\ninternal systems? If you used Salesforce, you could fire half of them and\npocket part of the difference in your bonus.\u201d (There\u2019s nothing wrong with\nthis, by the way. You\u2019re in the business of unemploying people. If you think\nthat is unfair, go back to school and study something that doesn\u2019t matter.)\n\nInstead, describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previously\nemployers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs. If you have not had\nthe opportunity to do this yet, describe things which suggest you have the\nability to increase revenue or reduce costs, or ideas to do so.\n\nThere are many varieties of well-paid professionals who sling code but do not\ndescribe themselves as slinging code for a living. Quants on Wall Street are\nthe first and best-known example: they use computers and math as a lever to\nmake high-consequence decisions better and faster than an unaided human could,\nand the punchline to those decisions is \u201cour firm make billions of dollars.\u201d\nSuccessful quants make more in bonuses in a good year than many equivalently\ntalented engineers will earn in a decade or lifetime.\n\nSimilarly, even though you might think Google sounds like a programmer-\nfriendly company, there are programmers and then there\u2019s the people who are\nclosely tied to 1% improvements in AdWords click-through rates. (Hint:\nprovably worth billions of dollars.) I recently stumbled across a web-page\nfrom the guy whose professional bio is \u201cwrote the backend billing code that\n97% of Google\u2019s revenue passes through.\u201d He\u2019s now an angel investor (a polite\nsynonym for \u201crich\u201d).\n\nYou are not defined by your chosen software stack: I recently asked via\nTwitter what young engineers wanted to know about careers. Many asked how to\nknow what programming language or stack to study. It doesn\u2019t matter. There you\ngo.\n\nDo Java programmers make more money than .NET programmers? Anyone describing\nthemselves as either a Java programmer or .NET programmer has already lost,\nbecause a) they\u2019re a programmer (you\u2019re not, see above) and b) they\u2019re making\nthemselves non-hireable for most programming jobs. In the real world, picking\nup a new language takes a few weeks of effort and after 6 to 12 months nobody\nwill ever notice you haven\u2019t been doing that one for your entire career. I did\nback-end Big Freaking Java Web Application development as recently as March\n2010. Trust me, nobody cares about that. If a Python shop was looking for\nsomebody technical to make them a pile of money, the fact that I\u2019ve never\nwritten a line of Python would not get held against me.\n\nTalented engineers are rare \u2014 vastly rarer than opportunities to use them \u2014\nand it is a seller\u2019s market for talent right now in almost every facet of the\nfield. Everybody at Matasano uses Ruby. If you don\u2019t, but are a good engineer,\nthey\u2019ll hire you anyway. (A good engineer has a track record of \u2014 repeat after\nme \u2014 increasing revenue or decreasing costs.) Much of Fog Creek uses the\nMicrosoft Stack. I can\u2019t even spell ASP.NET and they\u2019d still hire me.\n\nThere are companies with broken HR policies where lack of a buzzword means you\nwon\u2019t be selected. You don\u2019t want to work for them, but if you really do, you\ncan add the relevant buzzword to your resume for the costs of a few nights and\nweekends, or by controlling technology choices at your current job in such a\nmanner that in advances your career interests. Want to get trained on Ruby at\na .NET shop? Implement a one-off project in Ruby. Bam, you are now a\nprofessional Ruby programmer \u2014 you coded Ruby and you took money for it. (You\nlaugh? I did this at a Java shop. The one-off Ruby project made the company\n$30,000. My boss was, predictably, quite happy and never even asked what\nproduced the deliverable.)\n\nCo-workers and bosses are not usually your friends: You will spend a lot of\ntime with co-workers. You may eventually become close friends with some of\nthem, but in general, you will move on in three years and aside from\nmaintaining cordial relations you will not go out of your way to invite them\nover to dinner. They will treat you in exactly the same way. You should be a\ngood person to everyone you meet \u2014 it is the moral thing to do, and as a\nsidenote will really help your networking \u2014 but do not be under the delusion\nthat everyone is your friend.\n\nFor example, at a job interview, even if you are talking to an affable 28 year\nold who feels like a slightly older version of you he is in a transaction. You\nare not his friend, you are an input for an industrial process which he is\ntrying to buy for the company at the lowest price. That banter about World of\nWarcraft is just establishing a professional rapport, but he will (perfectly\nethically) attempt to do things that none of your actual friends would ever\ndo, like try to talk you down several thousand dollars in salary or guilt-trip\nyou into spending more time with the company when you could be spending time\nwith your actual friends. You will have other coworkers who \u2014 affably and\nethically \u2014 will suggest things which go against your interests, from \u201cI\nshould get credit for that project you just did\u201d (probably not phrased in so\nmany words) to \u201cWe should do this thing which advances my professional growth\ngoals rather than yours.\u201d Don\u2019t be surprised when this happens.\n\nYou radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the\ncrowd you hang around with: Many people already successfully employed as\nsenior engineers cannot actually implement FizzBuzz. Just read it and weep.\nKey takeaway: you probably are good enough to work at that company you think\nyou\u2019re not good enough for. They hire better mortals, but they still hire\nmortals.\n\n\u201cRead ad. Send in resume. Go to job interview. Receive offer.\u201d is the\nexception, not the typical case, for getting employment: Most jobs are never\navailable publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available\npublicly (see here). Information about the position travels at approximately\nthe speed of beer, sometimes lubricated by email. The decisionmaker at a\ncompany knows he needs someone. He tells his friends and business contacts.\nOne of them knows someone \u2014 family, a roommate from college, someone they met\nat a conference, an ex-colleague, whatever. Introductions are made, a meeting\nhappens, and they achieve agreement in principle on the job offer. Then the\nresume/HR department/formal offer dance comes about.\n\nThis is disproportionately true of jobs you actually want to get. \u201cFirst\nemployee at a successful startup\u201d has a certain cachet for a lot of geeks, and\nvirtually none of those got placed by sending in a cover letter to an HR\ndepartment, in part because two-man startups don\u2019t have enough scar tissue to\nform HR departments yet. (P.S. You probably don\u2019t want to be first employee\nfor a startup. Be the last co-founder instead.) Want to get a job at Google?\nThey have a formal process for giving you a leg up because a Googler likes\nyou. (They also have multiple informal ways for a Googler who likes you an\nawful lot to short-circuit that process. One example: buy the company you work\nfor. When you have a couple of billion lying around you have many interesting\noptions for solving problems.)\n\nThere are many reasons why most hiring happens privately. One is that publicly\nvisible job offers get spammed by hundreds of resumes (particularly in this\neconomy) from people who are stunningly inappropriate for the position. The\nother is that other companies are so bad at hiring that, if you don\u2019t have\nclose personal knowledge about the candidate, you might accidentally hire a\nnon-FizzBuzzer.\n\nNetworking: it isn\u2019t just for TCP packets: Networking just means a) meeting\npeople who at some point can do things for you (or vice versa) and b) making a\nfavorable impression on them.\n\nThere are many places to meet people. Events in your industry, such as\nconferences or academic symposia which get seen by non-academics, are one.\nUser groups are another. Keep in mind that user groups draw a very different\ncrowd than industry conferences and optimize accordingly.\n\nStrive to help people. It is the right thing to do, and people are keenly\naware of who have in the past given them or theirs favors. If you ever can\u2019t\nhelp someone but know someone who can, pass them to the appropriate person\nwith a recommendation. If you do this right, two people will be happy with you\nand favorably disposed to helping you out in the future.\n\nYou can meet people over the Internet (oh God, can you), but something in our\nmonkey brains makes in-the-flesh meeting a bigger thing. I\u2019ve Internet-met a\ngreat many people who I\u2019ve then gone on to meet in real life. The physical\nhandshake is a major step up in the relationship, even when Internet-meeting\nlead to very consequential things like \u201cMade them a lot of money through good\nadvice.\u201d Definitely blog and participate on your industry-appropriate watering\nholes like HN, but make it out to the meetups for it.\n\nAcademia is not like the real world: Your GPA largely doesn\u2019t matter (modulo\none high profile exception: a multinational advertising firm). To the extent\nthat it does matter, it only determines whether your resume gets selected for\njob interviews. If you\u2019re reading the rest of this, you know that your resume\nisn\u2019t the primary way to get job interviews, so don\u2019t spend huge amount of\nefforts optimizing something that you either have sufficiently optimized\nalready (since you\u2019ll get the same amount of interviews at 3.96 as you will at\n3.8) or that you don\u2019t need at all (since you\u2019ll get job interviews because\nyou\u2019re competent at asking the right people to have coffee with you).\n\nYour major and minor don\u2019t matter. Most decisionmakers in industry couldn\u2019t\ntell the difference between a major in Computer Science and a major in\nMathematics if they tried. I was once reduced to tears because a minor\nacademic snafu threatened my ability to get a Bachelor of Science with a major\nin Computer Science, which my advisor told me was more prestigious than a\nBachelor of Science in Computer Science. Academia cares about distinctions\nlike that. The real world does not.\n\nYour professors might understand how the academic job market works (short\nstory: it is ridiculously inefficient in engineering and fubared beyond mortal\ncomprehension in English) but they often have quixotic understandings of how\nthe real world works. For example, they may push you to get extra degrees\nbecause a) it sounds like a good idea to them and b) they enjoy having\nresearch-producing peons who work for ramen. Remember, market wages for people\ncapable of producing research are $80~100k+++ in your field. That buys an\nawful lot of ramen.\n\nThe prof in charge of my research project offered me a spot in his lab, a\ntuition waiver, and a whole $12,000 dollars as a stipend if I would commit 4~6\nyears to him. That\u2019s a great deal if, and only if, you have recently\nimmigrated from a low-wage country and need someone to intervene with the\ngovernment to get you a visa.\n\nIf you really like the atmosphere at universities, that is cool. Put a\nbackpack on and you can walk into any building at any university in the United\nStates any time you want. Backpacks are a lot cheaper than working in\nacademia. You can lead the life of the mind in industry, too \u2014 and enjoy less\npolitics and better pay. You can even get published in journals, if that\nfloats your boat. (After you\u2019ve escaped the mind-warping miasma of academia,\nyou might rightfully question whether Published In A Journal is really\npersonally or societally significant as opposed to close approximations like\nWrote A Blog Post And Showed It To Smart People.)\n\nHow much money do engineers make?\n\nWrong question. The right question is \u201cWhat kind of offers do engineers\nroutinely work for?\u201d, because salary is one of many levers that people can use\nto motivate you. The answer to this is, less than helpfully, \u201cOffers are all\nover the map.\u201d\n\nIn general, big companies pay more (money, benefits, etc) than startups.\nEngineers with high perceived value make more than those with low perceived\nvalue. Senior engineers make more than junior engineers. People working in\nhigh-cost areas make more than people in low-cost areas. People who are\nskilled in negotiation make more than those who are not.\n\nWe have strong cultural training to not ask about salary, ever. This is not\nuniversal. In many cultures, professional contexts are a perfectly appropriate\ntime to discuss money. (If you were a middle class Japanese man, you could\nreasonably be expected to reveal your exact salary to a 2nd date, anyone from\nyour soccer club, or the guy who makes your sushi. If you owned a company,\nyou\u2019d probably be cagey about your net worth but you\u2019d talk about employee\nsalaries the way programmers talk about compilers \u2014 quite frequently, without\nbeing embarrassed.) If I were a Marxist academic or a conspiracy theorist, I\nmight think that this bit of middle class American culture was specifically\nengineered to be in the interests of employers and against the interests of\nemployees. Prior to a discussion of salary at any particular target employer,\nyou should speak to someone who works there in a similar situation and ask\nabout the salary range for the position. It is <%= Date.today.year %>; you can\nfind these people online. (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and your (non-graph-\ndatabase) social networks are all good to lean on.)\n\nAnyhow. Engineers are routinely offered a suite of benefits. It is worth\nworrying, in the United States, about health insurance (traditionally, you get\nit and your employer foots most or all of the costs) and your retirement\nprogram, which is some variant of \u201cwe will match contributions to your 401k up\nto X% of salary.\u201d The value of that is easy to calculate: X% of salary. (It is\nfree money, so always max out your IRA up to the employer match. Put it in\nindex funds and forget about it for 40 years.)\n\nThere are other benefits like \u201cfree soda\u201d, \u201ccatered lunches\u201d, \u201cfree\nprogramming books\u201d, etc. These are social signals more than anything else.\nWhen I say that I\u2019m going to buy you soda, that says a specific thing about\nhow I run my workplace, who I expect to work for me, and how I expect to treat\nthem. (It says \u201cI like to move the behavior of unsophisticated young engineers\nby making this job seem fun by buying 20 cent cans of soda, saving myself tens\nof thousands in compensation while simultaneously encouraging them to ruin\ntheir health.\u201d And I like soda.) Read social signals and react appropriately \u2014\nsomeone who signals that, e.g., employee education is worth paying money for\nmight very well be a great company to work for \u2014 but don\u2019t give up huge\namounts of compensation in return for perks that you could trivially buy.\n\nHow do I become better at negotiation? This could be a post in itself. Short\nversion:\n\na) Remember you\u2019re selling the solution to a business need (raise revenue or\ndecrease costs) rather than programming skill or your beautiful face.\n\nb) Negotiate aggressively with appropriate confidence, like the ethical\nprofessional you are. It is what your counterparty is probably doing. You\u2019re\naiming for a mutual beneficial offer, not for saying Yes every time they say\nsomething.\n\nc) \u201cWhat is your previous salary?\u201d is employer-speak for \u201cPlease give me\nreasons to pay you less money.\u201d Answer appropriately.\n\nd) Always have a counteroffer. Be comfortable counteroffering around axes you\ncare about other than money. If they can\u2019t go higher on salary then talk about\nvacation instead.\n\ne) The only time to ever discuss salary is after you have reached agreement in\nprinciple that they will hire you if you can strike a mutually beneficial\ndeal. This is late in the process after they have invested a lot of time and\nmoney in you, specifically, not at the interview. Remember that there are\nlarge costs associated with them saying \u201cNo, we can\u2019t make that work\u201d and,\nappropriately, they will probably not scuttle the deal over comparatively\nsmall issues which matter quite a bit to you, like e.g. taking their offer and\ncountering for that plus a few thousand bucks then sticking to it.\n\nf) Read a book. Many have been written about negotiation. I like Getting To\nYes. It is a little disconcerting that negotiation skills are worth thousands\nof dollars per year for your entire career but engineers think that directed\neffort to study them is crazy when that could be applied to trivialities about\na technology that briefly caught their fancy.\n\nHow to value an equity grant:\n\nRoll d100. (Not the right kind of geek? Sorry. rand(100) then.)\n\n0~70: Your equity grant is worth nothing.\n\n71~94: Your equity grant is worth a lump sum of money which makes you about as\nmuch money as you gave up working for the startup, instead of working for a\nmegacorp at a higher salary with better benefits.\n\n95~99: Your equity grant is a lifechanging amount of money. You won\u2019t feel\nrich \u2014 you\u2019re not the richest person you know, because many of the people you\nspent the last several years with are now richer than you by definition \u2014 but\nyour family will never again give you grief for not having gone into\n$FAVORED_FIELD like a proper $YOUR_INGROUP.\n\n100: You worked at the next Google, and are rich beyond the dreams of avarice.\nCongratulations.\n\nPerceptive readers will note that 100 does not actually show up on a d100 or\nrand(100).\n\nWhy are you so negative about equity grants?\n\nBecause you radically overestimate the likelihood that your startup will\nsucceed and radically overestimate the portion of the pie that will be\nallocated to you if the startup succeeds. Read about dilution and liquidation\npreferences on Hacker News or Venture Hacks, then remember that there are\npeople who know more about negotiating deals than you know about programming\nand imagine what you could do to a program if there were several hundred\nmillion on the line.\n\nAre startups great for your career as a fresh graduate?\n\nThe high-percentage outcome is you work really hard for the next couple of\nyears, fail ingloriously, and then be jobless and looking to get into another\nstartup. If you really wanted to get into a startup two years out of school,\nyou could also just go work at a megacorp for the next two years, earn a bit\nof money, then take your warchest, domain knowledge, and contacts and found\none.\n\nWorking at a startup, you tend to meet people doing startups. Most of them\nwill not be able to hire you in two years. Working at a large corporation, you\ntend to meet other people in large corporations in your area. Many of them\neither will be able to hire you or will have the ear of someone able to hire\nyou in two years.\n\nSo would you recommend working at a startup? Working in a startup is a career\npath but, more than that, it is a lifestyle choice. This is similar to working\nin investment banking or academia. Those are three very different lifestyles.\nMany people will attempt to sell you those lifestyles as being in your\ninterests, for their own reasons. If you genuinely would enjoy that lifestyle,\ngo nuts. If you only enjoy certain bits of it, remember that many things are\navailable a la carte if you really want them. For example, if you want to work\non cutting-edge technology but also want to see your kids at 5:30 PM, you can\nwork on cutting-edge technology at many, many, many megacorps.\n\n(Yeah, really. If it creates value for them, heck yes, they\u2019ll invest in it.\nThey\u2019ll also invest in a lot of CRUD apps, but then again, so do startups \u2014\nthey just market making CRUD apps better than most megacorps do. The first\nhour of the Social Network is about making a CRUD app seem like sexy, the\nsecond is a Lifetime drama about a divorce improbably involving two\nheterosexual men.)\n\nYour most important professional skill is communication: Remember engineers\nare not hired to create programs and how they are hired to create business\nvalue? The dominant quality which gets you jobs is the ability to give people\nthe perception that you will create value. This is not necessarily coextensive\nwith ability to create value.\n\nSome of the best programmers I know are pathologically incapable of carrying\non a conversation. People disproportionately a) wouldn\u2019t want to work with\nthem or b) will underestimate their value-creation ability because they gain\ninsight into that ability through conversation and the person just doesn\u2019t\nimplement that protocol. Conversely, people routinely assume that I am among\nthe best programmers they know entirely because a) there exists observable\nevidence that I can program and b) I write and speak really, really well.\n\n(Once upon a time I would have described myself as \u201cSlightly below average\u201d in\nprogramming skill. I have since learned that I had a radically skewed\nimpression of the skill distribution, that programming skill is not what\npeople actually optimize for, and that modesty is against my interests. These\ndays if you ask me how good of a programmer I am I will start telling you\nstories about how I have programmed systems which helped millions of kids\nlearn to read or which provably made companies millions. The question of where\nI am on the bell curve matters to no one, so why bother worrying about it?)\n\nCommunication is a skill. Practice it: you will get better. One key sub-skill\nis being able to quickly, concisely, and confidently explain how you create\nvalue to someone who is not an expert in your field and who does not have a\npriori reasons to love you. If when you attempt to do this technical buzzwords\nkeep coming up (\u201cReduced 99th percentile query times by 200 ms by optimizing\nindexes on...\u201d), take them out and try again. You should be able to explain\nwhat you do to a bright 8 year old, the CFO of your company, or a programmer\nin a different specialty, at whatever the appropriate level of abstraction is.\n\nYou will often be called to do Enterprise Sales and other stuff you got into\nengineering to avoid: Enterprise Sales is going into a corporation and trying\nto convince them to spend six or seven figures on buying a system which will\neither improve their revenue or reduce costs. Every job interview you will\never have is Enterprise Sales. Politics, relationships, and communication\nskills matter a heck of a lot, technical reality not quite so much.\n\nWhen you have meetings with coworkers and are attempting to convince them to\nimplement your suggestions, you will also be doing Enterprise Sales. If\ngetting stuff done is your job description, then convincing people to get\nstuff done is a core job skill for you. Spend appropriate effort on getting\ngood at it. This means being able to communicate effectively in memos, emails,\nconversations, meetings, and PowerPoint (when appropriate). It means\nunderstanding how to make a business case for a technological initiative. It\nmeans knowing that sometimes you will make technological sacrifices in pursuit\nof business objectives and that this is the right call.\n\nModesty is not a career-enhancing character trait: Many engineers have self-\nconfidence issues (hello, self). Many also come from upbringings where modesty\nwith regards to one\u2019s accomplishments is culturally celebrated. American\nbusinesses largely do not value modesty about one\u2019s accomplishments. The right\ntone to aim for in interviews, interactions with other people, and life is\ncloser to \u201crestrained, confident professionalism.\u201d\n\nIf you are part of a team effort and the team effort succeeds, the right note\nto hit is not \u201cI owe it all to my team\u201d unless your position is such that\neveryone will understand you are lying to be modest. Try for \u201cIt was a\nprivilege to assist my team by leading their efforts with regards to\n$YOUR_SPECIALTY.\u201d Say it in a mirror a thousand times until you can say it\nwith a straight face. You might feel like you\u2019re overstating your\naccomplishments. Screw that. Someone who claims to Lead Efforts To Optimize\nProduction while having the title Sandwich Artist is overstating their\naccomplishments. You are an engineer. You work magic which makes people\u2019s\nlives better. If you were in charge of the database specifically on an\nimportant project involving people then heck yes you lead the database effort\nwhich was crucial for the success of the project. This is how the game is\nplayed. If you feel poorly about it, you\u2019re like a batter who feels poorly\nabout stealing bases in baseball: you\u2019re not morally superior, you\u2019re just\nplaying poorly\n\nAll business decisions are ultimately made by one or a handful of multi-\ncellular organisms closely related to chimpanzees, not by rules or by\nalgorithms: People are people. Social grooming is a really important skill.\nPeople will often back suggestions by friends because they are friends, even\nwhen other suggestions might actually be better. People will often be\nfavoritably disposed to people they have broken bread with. (There is a\nbusiness book called Never Eat Alone. It might be worth reading, but that\ntitle is whatever the antonym of deceptive advertising is.) People routinely\nfavor people who they think are like them over people they think are not like\nthem. (This can be good, neutral, or invidious. Accepting that it happens is\nthe first step to profitably exploiting it.)\n\nActual grooming is at least moderately important, too, because people are\nhilariously easy to hack by expedients such as dressing appropriately for the\nsituation, maintaining a professional appearance, speaking in a confident tone\nof voice, etc. Your business suit will probably cost about as much as a\ncomputer monitor. You only need it once in a blue moon, but when you need it\nyou\u2019ll be really, really, really glad that you have it. Take my word for it,\nif I wear everyday casual when I visit e.g. City Hall I get treated like a\nhapless awkward twenty-something, if I wear the suit I get treated like the\nCEO of a multinational company. I\u2019m actually the awkward twenty-something CEO\nof a multinational company, but I get to pick which side to emphasize when I\nwant favorable treatment from a bureaucrat.\n\n(People familiar with my business might object to me describing it as a\nmultinational company because it is not what most people think of when\n\u201cmultinational company\u201d gets used in conversation. Sorry \u2014 it is a simple\nconversational hack. If you think people are pissed off at being manipulated\nwhen they find that out, well, some people passionately hate business suits,\ntoo. That doesn\u2019t mean business suits are valueless. Be appropriate to the\ncircumstances. Technically true answers are the best kind of answers when the\nalternative is Immigration deporting you, by the way.)\n\nAt the end of the day, your life happiness will not be dominated by your\ncareer. Either talk to older people or trust the social scientists who have:\nfamily, faith, hobbies, etc etc generally swamp career achievements and money\nin terms of things which actually produce happiness. Optimize appropriately.\nYour career is important, and right now it might seem like the most important\nthing in your life, but odds are that is not what you\u2019ll believe forever. Work\nto live, don\u2019t live to work.\n\nOriginally written: October 29, 2011\n\n### About the author\n\nPatrick McKenzie (patio11) ran four small software businesses.

The listing and distribution of Asmodee Group shares is expected to\ntake place within 12 months, and Coffee Stain & Friends shares during calendar\nyear 2025.\n\nEmbracer Group co-founder and CEO Lars Wingefors, under the company name Lars\nWingefors AB, will form a new long-term ownership structure that includes the\ncurrent holdings in Embracer Group and remain a \u201clong-term, active, committed,\nand supportive\u201d owner of all three companies.\n\n\u201cThe Board of Directors, together with executive management, propose to\ntransform Embracer Group into three separate, listed companies,\u201d said Embracer\nGroup chair of the board Kicki Wallje-Lund in a press release. \u201cThis\ntransformation is an important step in unlocking shareholder value. With this\nnew structure, the three entities will be able to focus on executing their\ncore strategies and leveraging their own strengths, providing more\ndifferentiated and distinct equity stories to both existing and new\nshareholders. After careful evaluation of various strategic alternatives, we\nstrongly believe that this decision will benefit all stakeholders and position\nus for continued success in the future.\u201d\n\nWingefors added, \u201cThis move has been made with the intention to unleash the\nfull potential of each team and provide them with their own leadership and\nstrategic direction. This is the start of a new chapter, a chapter that I\nintend to remain part of as an active, committed, and supportive shareholder\nof all three new entities, with an evergreen horizon. This move towards three\nindependent companies reinforces Embracer\u2019s vision of backing entrepreneurs\nand creators with a long-term mindset, allowing them to continue to deliver\nunforgettable experiences for gamers and fans across the globe.\u201d\n\nFind further details below.\n\n> Background and Strategic Rationale\n>\n> Since its inception, Embracer Group has grown into a global group of\n> creative and entrepreneurial businesses in PC, console, mobile and other\n> related media. This has been possible through the Group\u2019s decentralized\n> operating model, where great entrepreneurs run operations as part of 11\n> operative groups\u2014each with their own distinctive heritage, intellectual\n> properties, branding, business strategy, and operations. Embracer Group\u2019s\n> strategy has been built around backing entrepreneurs and creators within\n> gaming and entertainment with the ambition to achieve soft synergies from\n> its expanded eco-system. The Group has an extensive catalog of over 9003\n> fully owned or controlled franchises, including some of the most popular and\n> iconic titles in gaming, comics, and other media. The current structure and\n> model have served the Group well and have been of paramount importance in\n> building a global group with operations in more than 40 countries.\n>\n> During the past years, the Group has made significant investments in\n> acquisitions and into a strategy of accelerated organic growth. To further\n> realize the untapped potential in Embracer Group and better optimize the use\n> of its resources, Embracer Group announced a restructuring program in June\n> 2023 divided into different phases lasting until March 2024. Focus of the\n> program has been cost savings, capital allocation, efficiency and\n> consolidation, while also divesting selected studios.\n>\n> Following a careful and thorough review, it is the assessment of the Board\n> of Directors that the current Group structure does not create optimal\n> conditions for future value creation both for Embracer Group\u2019s shareholders\n> and other stakeholders. To continue the transformation of Embracer Group\n> into the future for the benefit of all employees, gamers and shareholders,\n> the Board of Directors and the executive management have therefore decided\n> to propose a separation of Embracer Group, creating three separate publicly\n> listed entities: Asmodee, Coffee Stain & Friends, and Middle-earth\n> Enterprises & Friends.\n>\n> The Board of Directors have concluded the following:\n>\n>   * The entities will have sufficient scale, coupled with clearer\n> operational strategies and financial profiles that enable simplified equity\n> stories to attract a larger pool of investors. Current shareholders can\n> freely decide on their capital allocation between the three entities.\n>   * Each entity will be able to fully utilize its own balance sheet, its own\n> set of financial targets and optimal financing structure and capital\n> allocation strategy that enable their growth ambitions.\n>   * The new structure enables the best possible greenlighting models,\n> portfolios and go-to-market strategies for indie games as well as AAA games\n> through two separate, more focused entities.\n>   * Ongoing and future collaboration around intellectual properties,\n> companies and people will still be enabled and encouraged across the\n> entities on market terms.\n>\n\n>\n> Asmodee Group\n>\n> Asmodee is a leading international publisher and distributor of board games,\n> trading cards and digital board games with 23 fully owned studios and\n> 300-plus intellectual properties and constitutes the Tabletop Games\n> operating segment of Embracer Group. As per LTM December 2023, Asmodee\n> generated net sales of SEK 14.8 billion, with Adjusted EBITDA of\n> approximately SEK 2.3 billion, EBITDAC of approximately SEK 2.0 billion,\n> Adjusted EBIT of approximately SEK 1.9 billion and free cash flow after\n> working capital of approximately SEK 2.1 billion.\n>\n> After fiscal year 2024 / 2025, Asmodee has an ambition to grow organically\n> in line with the market, which translates into a mid-single digit organic\n> growth in addition to any acquisitive growth. Asmodee\u2019s ambition is also to\n> expand its margins from current levels as a result of an improved revenue\n> mix and continued cost management while maintaining a high cash conversion.\n>\n> The spinoff of Asmodee with a listing on Nasdaq Stockholm is expected to\n> have value-enhancing benefits through greater focus on its core strategy,\n> portfolio and markets. The ongoing transmedia collaboration around Middle-\n> earth and many other intellectual properties is expected to continue after\n> the completion of the spinoff. As a global leader in board and trading card\n> games, with a proven track-record of profitable growth, Asmodee is well-\n> positioned to build on its strategy and continue to prosper as a standalone\n> entity. The spinoff is also expected to enable Asmodee to quicker resume its\n> value accretive M&A strategy.\n>\n> 23 in-house studios develop tabletop games for all types of players across\n> social, tabletop, and lifestyle, including a steady addition of new content\n> to key brands. The catalog of 300-plus owned intellectual properties include\n> the beloved board games Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders, Azul, CATAN, Dobble,\n> Exploding Kittens, and an extensive number of distributed games and\n> intellectual properties. Asmodee is also developing a wide range of licensed\n> tabletop games based on The Lord of the Rings, Marvel, Game of Thrones,\n> Netflix, LEGO, and Star Wars, including the recent successful trading card\n> game release of Star Wars: Unlimited.\n>\n> Coffee Stain & Friends\n>\n> Coffee Stain & Friends is intended to consist of leading publishers and\n> developers focused on a variety of games for PC, console, and mobile,\n> including community-driven free-to-play games, LiveOps games, and indie / AA\n> games.\n>\n> As a standalone company, Coffee Stain & Friends will be able to better\n> showcase its high margin profile and strong cash flow profile coupled with\n> an enhanced ability to resume and allocate resources towards opportunities\n> to maximize the long-term value creation.\n>\n> The entity will operate under two distinct segments: premium and free-to-\n> play. Premium PC and console operations will include among other Coffee\n> Stain, Ghost Ship, Tarsier, and Tuxedo Labs, as well as THQ Nordic and\n> Amplifier Game Invest. Intellectual properties include Deep Rock Galactic,\n> Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Wreckfest, Teardown, and Valheim, as well as\n> more than 200 other intellectual properties. Free-to-play operations will\n> include Easybrain, Deca, CrazyLabs, and Cryptic. Intellectual properties\n> include Sudoku.com, Blockudoku, Jigsaw Puzzle, and many other intellectual\n> properties. Key published free-to-play games based on licensed intellectual\n> properties include Star Trek Online and D&D Neverwinter Online.\n>\n> Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends\n>\n> Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends is intended to remain a creative\n> powerhouse in AAA game development and publishing for PC and console, and\n> the stewards of The Lord of the Rings and Tomb Raider intellectual\n> properties.\n>\n> As a standalone company, Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends will operate as\n> a more transparent entity, offering a better structure to maximize the\n> potential of its highly strategic franchises, with focus on the Lord of the\n> Rings and a number of other key intellectual properties. Decision-makers\n> will be closer to the organization, leading to enhanced capital expenditure\n> management, accountability, and well-balanced investments to optimize\n> financial performance and profitable growth over the long term.\n>\n> Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends will be the home of critically acclaimed\n> studios, including Crystal Dynamics, Dambuster Studios, Eidos-Montreal,\n> Flying Wild Hog Studios, Tripwire, Vertigo Games, Warhorse Studios, and 4A\n> Games among many others. intellectual properties includes Dead Island,\n> Killing Floor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, The Lord of the Rings, Metro, and\n> Tomb Raider, among many others. The group will include PLAION, Freemode,\n> Dark Horse, and other businesses.\n>\n> Illustrative Pro Forma Financials by Entity and on Group Level\n>\n> LTM as per Q3 Fiscal Year 2023 / 2024 (January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023)\n>\n> SEK, billion| Asmodee Group| Coffee Stain & Friends| Middle-earth\n> Enterprises & Friends| HQ| Embracer Group  \n> ---|---|---|---|---|---  \n> Net sales| 14.8| 10.9| 14.1| 0.0| 39.7  \n> Adjusted EBITDA| 2.3| 4.2| 4.1| -0.3| 10.4  \n> Adjusted EBIT| 1.9| 2.8| 2.0| -0.3| 6.5  \n> Capex| -0.3| -2.2| -2.9| 0.0| -5.4  \n> EBITDAC| 2.0| 2.1| 1.2| -0.3| 4.9  \n> # headcount| 2,450| 3,150| 4,550| 50| 10,200  \n>  \n> Fiscal Year 2022 / 2023 (April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023)\n>\n> SEK, billion| Asmodee Group| Coffee Stain & Friends| Middle-earth\n> Enterprises & Friends| HQ| Embracer Group  \n> ---|---|---|---|---|---  \n> Net sales| 13.4| 10.5| 12.3| 0.0| 36.2  \n> Adjusted EBITDA| 2.3| 3.8| 3.2| -0.2| 9.2  \n> Adjusted EBIT| 2.0| 2.6| 1.6| -0.2| 6.0  \n> Capex| -0.3| -2.2| -3.3| 0.0| -5.8  \n> EBITDAC| 2.0| 1.6| -0.1| -0.2| 3.3  \n>  \n> As of December 2023, the annualized run-rate capex for Coffee Stain &\n> Friends and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends was significantly reduced, to\n> approximately SEK 1.5 billion and SEK 2.3 billion, respectively.

It is intended that\n> Asmodee, Coffee Stain & Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends\n> parent companies will be headquartered in Karlstad, Sweden. Asmodee\u2019s\n> operational headquarters will remain in Paris.\n>\n> Transformation Structure and Process\n>\n> The Board of Directors proposes that shares in two of these entities,\n> Asmodee and Coffee Stain & Friends, will be distributed to the shareholders\n> of Embracer Group, and listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. The third entity, Middle-\n> earth Enterprises & Friends, will remain within the current listed company\n> Embracer Group, which will eventually be renamed at the same time as the\n> Coffee Stain & Friends spinoff.\n>\n> The intention of the Board of Directors of Embracer Group is to carry out\n> both spinoffs by way of a dividend distribution of all shares, a so-called\n> Lex ASEA dividend. Such dividend is subject to shareholders\u2019 approval at a\n> general meeting in Embracer Group. The current dual-share class of A and\n> B-shares will be replicated into the new public entities. Subject to\n> approval of the general meeting of Embracer Group and certain other\n> customary conditions, it is anticipated that a listing of Asmodee can be\n> completed within twelve months. Additionally, a separation of Coffee Stain &\n> Friends is expected in calendar year 2025.\n>\n> As part of the spinoff preparation for Asmodee, Embracer Group has agreed\n> with the management of Asmodee to renegotiate the existing earnout\n> structure. Through the new structure, the management of Asmodee will change\n> their indirect ownership in Asmodee of 4.72 percent (current earnout\n> structure entitling management to exchange that ownership to B shares of\n> Embracer Group if earnout conditions are met) into a direct ownership of\n> 4.72 percent in the Swedish Asmodee holding company, the entity which is\n> intended to be listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. The new agreement with the\n> management of Asmodee means that a maximum of approximately 41 million B\n> shares in a share earnout will be reduced from Embracer Group as of this\n> current quarter.\n>\n> As part of the transformation and ahead of each separation the full capital\n> structure, including both equity and debt, will be reviewed in Asmodee and\n> Coffee Stain & Friends to create the best possible long-term foundation for\n> each entity as a separately listed company.\n>\n> Leadership and Organization\n>\n> Ahead of the initiation of the separation process of Asmodee and in line\n> with already planned governance evolutions, St\u00e9phane Carville, current CEO,\n> and Marc Nunes, current COO and founder, will join and play active roles in\n> the Board of Directors of Asmodee. Thomas Koegler, a longstanding\n> operational and executive leader at Asmodee and current deputy COO, will in\n> the coming months become Asmodee CEO supported by key leaders within\n> Asmodee.\n>\n> For Coffee Stain & Friends, Anton Westbergh, current CEO of the operative\n> group Coffee Stain, will take the leading role in the process leading up to\n> the separation. The Operative Group CEOs of DECA Games, Easybrain, Amplifier\n> Game Invest, and THQ Nordic will report to Anton Westbergh starting April\n> 22, 2024.\n>\n> For Middle-Earth Enterprises & Friends, Phil Rogers will take the leading\n> role in the process leading up to the separation. Phil Rogers is currently\n> interim Group Chief Strategy Officer, with responsibility for the concluded\n> restructuring program, and CEO of the operative group Crystal\n> Dynamics\u2014Eidos.

For\n> me, building a business is not about reaching a certain size or position, it\n> is about the journey to turn many small and sometimes a few large steps into\n> something greater. Today is clearly a day when we take a bigger step. I am\n> so excited to imagine what the coming decades will bring. At the IPO in 2016\n> I made a promise to stakeholders that I would be around for at least 25\n> years\u2013and I still have 17 years left to fulfill that.\n>\n> It has not always been a straight road, but I am very proud of the\n> achievements made possible by thousands of talented individuals who create\n> exceptional content entertaining millions of people worldwide. We have some\n> of the most extraordinary companies and IPs in the games and entertainment\n> industry within Embracer today, and it is my duty to ensure the best\n> possible conditions for continued success.\n>\n> I am convinced that the best is still ahead of us.\n>\n> History has shown that diversified groups like ours can significantly\n> enhance their chances of success by adopting a more agile, fast-moving\n> approach and focusing on well-defined core market segments.\n>\n> Numerous inspiring examples from Sweden illustrate how large enterprises\n> have achieved greater success by dividing into multiple separate specialized\n> companies. I am deeply motivated and inspired by these success stories and\n> believe they offer valuable insights for our own strategic direction. The\n> time is right for Embracer to become three public companies, each boasting\n> sufficient scale, coherent strategies, specialized business models and\n> empowered by visionary leadership teams. Rather than imposing conformity on\n> thriving businesses, we should foster an environment that amplifies existing\n> success. I am confident that this will be easier with three distinct winning\n> formulas in specific market segments.\n>\n> Asmodee is the leading developer, publisher, and distributor of tabletop\n> games on the planet. Coffee Stain & Friends will become the leading and most\n> innovative developer of community-driven games for PC, console, and nobile.\n> Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends will be developing immersive world-class\n> entertainment IPs, including the iconic Lord of the Rings, leveraging in-\n> house AAA capabilities and formidable partnerships.\n>\n> I have always viewed my role as a Group CEO and main owner to be a promotor\n> for successful entrepreneurs, gamemakers and business leaders in achieving\n> more success.\n>\n> This will not change.\n>\n> I today also communicate my intention to form a new long-term ownership\n> structure. This will include the current holdings in Embracer (representing\n> approximately 20 percent of the capital and 40 percent of the votes). I\n> intend to remain a long-term, active, committed and supportive owner of all\n> three entities. This structure will be based on the values and ideas that\n> Embracer was founded upon, trust, a long-term mindset, and a desire to\n> embrace different perspectives going forward.\n>\n> There is not one way to do business, but some business models are more\n> similar than others. The same goes for businesspeople. The ambitions may be\n> similar, but the approach differs. The similarities between the businesses\n> that will make up Asmodee, Coffee Stain & Friends, and Middle-earth\n> Enterprises & Friends are striking, but so are also the differences when it\n> comes to go-to-market strategies and business profiles. All the companies\n> have bright futures ahead, by perfecting what is working for each of them,\n> and by continuing to cooperate when it makes sense.\n>\n> There is significant untapped potential within the group, which I am\n> confident the new structure will unleash.
