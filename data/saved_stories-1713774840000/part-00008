To keep data centers from overheating,\ncompanies use water to cool down the hardware.\n\nAccording to China Water Risk, China could triple the number of data centers\nby 2030, reaching roughly 11 million data center racks that house servers and\nother equipment.\n\nAnd it's not just China. The AI boom is already leading to an astronomical\namount of water being used elsewhere, including in the US. Last year,\nresearchers found that just in training GPT-3 alone, OpenAI partner Microsoft\nconsumed a whopping 185,000 gallons of water, which is enough to cool an\nentire nuclear reactor. Google also admitted in its 2023 Environmental Report\nthat it had used up an astronomical 5.6 billion gallons of water in 2022.\n\nAI chatbots are vastly more energy-intensive than conventional methods of\nfinding information online, relying on specialized chips that consume huge\namounts of electricity.\n\nPer China Water Risk's report, if 100 million users were to chat with OpenAI's\nChatGPT, it would consume the equivalent of 20 Olympic swimming pools. Doing\nthe same via simple Google searches would only \"consume one swimming pool.\"\n\nAll that usage could have devastating effects on parts of the world where\nwater resources are already extremely scarce. Last month, The Atlantic\nreported that Microsoft was trying to cover up the water usage of its data\ncenter in the Arizona desert.\n\n## Keep Cool and Carry On\n\nAnd the AI hype cycle isn't quite over yet. Experts are worried about the\nfurther rise of energy and water usage.\n\nArm Holdings Plc CEO Rene Haas told Bloomberg this week that he expects the\nworld's data centers to use more electricity than India, the world's most\npopulous nation, by the end of the decade.\n\n\"We are still incredibly in the early days in terms of the capabilities,\" he\nsaid, ringing the alarm bells over AI eclipsing our global energy demands.\n\nTo Haas, one meaningful step forward is to find new ways to train and power\nthese AI models with more energy-efficient chips.\n\n\"There needs to be broad breakthroughs,\" he told Bloomberg. \"Any piece of\nefficiency matters.\"\n\nMore on AI and water: Microsoft Is Draining Arizona's Water for its AI\n\nShare This Article\n\nLet's Put a Pin in That\n\nHumane's AI \"Pin\" Is a $700 Flaming Dumpster Fire\n\nApr 11, 11:11 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nSmarter Than Elon\n\nElon Musk Says That Within Two Years, AI Will Be \"Smarter Than the Smartest\nHuman\"\n\nApr 9, 11:59 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nNot My Job\n\nOfficial NYC Chatbot Encouraging Small Businesses to Break the Law\n\nMar 30, 7:30 AM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nEmad and Satya Sitting in a Tree\n\nOusted Founder of Stability AI Seen Meeting With Microsoft CEO\n\nMar 26, 2:00 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
