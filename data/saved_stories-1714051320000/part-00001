It contains more than 99%\nSiC, and it's harder, sharper, and more friable crystal than Black Silicon\nCarbide. The sharp, blocky grains of Green Silicon Carbide are highly pure and\nhave extreme hardness (Mohs 9.4 /Knoop 2600), strong cutting capacity,\nexcellent abrasion resistance, stable chemical properties, outstanding thermal\nconductivity, and high strength at high temperatures.\n\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES\n\nColor: Green Crystal Form: Alpha SiC Shape: Blocky, Sharp edged Friability:\nFriable Mohs hardness: 9.4 Knoop hardness (100 scale) : 2600 Melting Point:\nDissociates at ~2800\u00b0C Specific Gravity: 3.21g/cm3Min Bulk Density: 1.20-1.60\ng / cm3 Knoop hardness (100 scale): 2600kg/mm\n\n## Available Sizes\n\nWe offer both Macro and Micro grit sizing. Our Silicon Carbide is offered in\nstandard FEPA sizes, custom particle sizes, custom densities, and custom\nchemistries.\n\nFor Bonded Abrasives Application\n\nFEPA F\n\nMacro: F12, F24, F30, F36, F40, F46, F54, F60, F80, F100, F120, F150, F180,\nF220\n\nMicro: F240, F280, F320, F360, F400, F500, F600, F800, F1000, F1200\n\nFor Coated Abrasives Application\n\nFEPA P\n\nMacro: P24, P30, P36, P40, P50, P60, P80, P100, P120, P150, P180, P220\n\nMicro: P240, P280, P320, P360, P400, P500, P600, P800, P1000, P1200, P1500,\nP2000, P2500\n\nNoted: Custom sizes and shape are also available upon request.\n\n###### Quick Contact\n\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact with our team.\n\n+86 17803991216\n\nChina, He Nan Sheng, Zheng Zhou Shi, Zhong Yuan Qu No.171\n\n###### Company\n\nSign up for industry alerts, our latest news, thoughts, and insights from\nSanHui.\n\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time!\n\nCopyright \u00a9 SANHUI ABRASIVES CO., LTD\n\n", "frontpage": false}
