As with so many dietary issues, though, the evidence tells a more\nnuanced tale.\n\n### By Amos Zeeberg\n\nUltra-processed foods often contain artificial colors and unnatural shapes\u2014but\nthat doesn't mean the whole category is unhealthy. Credit: Alamy\n\nAfter decades of searching, many scientists believe they have finally pinned\ndown the main problem with our modern diets\u2014the factor driving ever-escalating\nrates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and any number of other serious\nchronic conditions. The culprit isn\u2019t saturated fats, trans fats or some new\nkiller fat you haven\u2019t of. It\u2019s not cholesterol, carbs or sugars; dairy,\ngluten or meat. It isn\u2019t a specific thing at all.\n\nThe problem, according to this increasingly popular argument, is that we\u2019re\neating lots of ultra-processed food or UPF. Traditionally, people used limited\nprocessing techniques such as cooking and pickling to preserve food or to make\nit more pleasant to eat. Modern food companies transform food much more\nextensively through techniques such as extrusion and molding, adding lab-\nderived components including flavorings, emulsifiers and preservatives. They\nuse this additional processing to make foods that are cheaper, longer-lasting\nand more convenient.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long, formal scientific definition, but it can be boiled down to\nthis: If it\u2019s wrapped in plastic and has at least one ingredient that you\nwouldn\u2019t find in your kitchen, it\u2019s UPF,\u201d writes author and infectious disease\ndoctor Chris van Tulleken in his recent, widely praised book, Ultra-Processed\nPeople: The Science Behind Food That Isn\u2019t Food. These ultra-processed foods\nhave come to represent a major part of people\u2019s diets\u2014a large majority in\ncountries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. \u201cWe\u2019ve\nstarted eating substances constructed from novel molecules and using processes\nnever previously encountered in our evolutionary history, substances that\ncan\u2019t really even be called \u2018food.\u2019\u201d\n\nMany researchers and nutritionists say this shift has been a costly one. They\npoint to a series of studies suggesting that ultra-processed food is a major\ndriver of obesity, heart disease, cancer and even neurodegenerative conditions\nlike Alzheimer\u2019s. As the scientific evidence accumulates, some countries have\nresponded by adopting public health policies to try to decrease the amount of\nultra-processed food that people eat. The message has entered the popular\nmedia in increasingly alarming reports. \u201cUltra-processed food isn't just bad\nfor your health\u2014it messes with your mind,\u201d reported National Geographic in\nNovember. \u201cWhat makes ultra-processed foods so bad for your health?\u201d probed\nThe Economist in August.\n\nAlthough there is good research raising concerns about ultra-processed food,\nwe should be hesitant to declare it the primary scourge of the modern diet.\nThe case against ultra-processed food isn\u2019t as solid as the headlines and\npublic outcry would lead us to believe. The research connecting these\nprocessed foods to health problems has limitations, and there is contradictory\nevidence as well. This is a classic example of how research doesn\u2019t speak for\nitself: It must always be interpreted, by people, in the context of other,\noften conflicting evidence. \u201cAre there really studies that show that ultra-\nprocessed foods are unhealthy? It\u2019s pushing very weak data to make a case,\u201d\nsays Gunter Kuhnle, a nutrition researcher at the University of Reading.\n\nThe field of nutrition has a long history of overreacting to contemporary\nresearch trends, and we risk making the same mistake now with processing.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had that issue in the past, as with low-fat recommendations\u201d that later\nturned out to be counterproductive, says Duane Mellor, a dietitian at Aston\nUniversity in England. \u201cWe\u2019ve messed up too many times. We need to make\nsmarter changes more carefully.\u201d The evidence on ultra-processed food, as is\noften the case in science, refuses to yield simple, black-or-white answers.\n\nThe idea that distinctive modern foods cause distinctive modern health\nproblems started gaining traction in the popular press and popular\nimagination.\n\nThe term \u201cultra-processed food\u201d was introduced 15 years ago, when University\nof S\u00e3o Paulo physician, epidemiologist and nutritionist Carlos Monteiro\npublished a short commentary in the journal Public Health Nutrition arguing\nthat industrial foods were \u201chardly compatible with survival,\u201d and that \u201cdiets\nthat include a lot of ultra-processed foods are intrinsically nutritionally\nunbalanced and intrinsically harmful to health.\"\n\nMonteiro concluded by recommending the adoption of policies like those used to\nmake alcohol and tobacco more expensive and less accessible. He and several\ncolleagues soon created a food-categorization system called NOVA, with\nunprocessed or minimally processed food in group 1 and ultra-processed foods\nin group 3. (The system was later expanded to four groups.) UPFs were said to\ninclude a wide range of sweet, salty and fast foods such as soft drinks,\nchicken nuggets, ice cream, chips and cookies. It also encompassed products\nnot usually thought of as junk food but made for convenience or with\ningredients that are not used in home cooking, such as fruit yogurt, sliced\nbread, infant formula and breakfast cereal with low levels of added sugar.\n\nOther researchers began using the NOVA categorization system to examine the\npotential health effects of ultra-processed food, comparing people who ate\nlots of ultra-processed food with those who ate more natural fare. A series of\nthese studies found that UPFs were consistently associated with worse health\noutcomes.\n\nA 2011 study in Guatemala found higher body-mass index and rates of obesity\namong people who ate more highly processed foods\u2014a 10 percentage point\nincrease in consumption of processed food translated to a 4.3% increase in\nBMI. A 2019 study of a group in the U.S. found a connection between eating\nultra-processed food and experiencing metabolic disturbances such as high\nblood sugar and high blood pressure, conditions that increase the risk of\nobesity, diabetes and heart disease.\n\nAs more studies emerged, the idea that distinctive modern foods cause\ndistinctive modern health problems started gaining traction in the popular\npress and popular imagination\u2014and among many physicians as well. \u201cUltra-\nprocessed food feeds into this idea that everything was better in the past,\u201d\nKuhnle states. \u201cOn one side, you have the farmer going in the field. On the\nother side, you have smoking factories. And you can add that there is sort of\nthis general distrust in people of science, of industry, of government.\u201d\n\nBut there is one key, well-known limitation of this kind of retrospective\nresearch: Correlation does not prove causation. In these studies, people who\nate lots of ultra-processed food were usually in worse health\u2014not much worse,\nas in the case of smoking, but somewhat worse. That could be interpreted to\nmean that ultra-processed foods cause health problems, but there are other\nfactors, or confounders, that could also explain the correlation. People who\neat lots of processed food might have unhealthier lifestyles overall, which\ncould explain why they have worse outcomes. People who listen to public health\nadvice about eating fresh foods might also choose to walk up stairs rather\nthan use the elevator, an increase in physical activity that might well not\nshow up in research surveys. Researchers try to correct for these confounders,\nbut different categories of people are too complicated to be perfectly\nstatistically measured and compared.\n\nA study of Spanish university students found that people who ate the most\nultra-processed food were one-third more likely to develop depression over 10\nyears than people who ate the least.\n\nObservational studies are also prone to an issue called reverse causality: Did\ndiet soda make people gain weight, or did overweight people who wanted to shed\nsome pounds start drinking diet soda? What\u2019s more, there are major questions\nabout how well people remember what they eat and therefore how accurately they\ncan report it in observational studies. Some researchers say this kind of\nevidence doesn\u2019t merit the boldface attention it often gets. \u201cHow this stuff\ngets published in The New England Journal of Medicine,\u201d says psychologist and\nfood researcher Peter Rogers, \u201cthat\u2019s strange to me. That we\u2019re not more\nconcerned about the level of evidence.\u201d\n\nSome researchers have tried to get a better look at ultra-processed foods by\nrunning prospective studies, meaning that they gather a group of subjects,\nmonitor their eating habits and lifestyles for some period, and compare their\ndiets with their health outcomes, trying to correct for other factors besides\ndiet. A 2019 French study that followed people for about seven years found\nthat those who ate more ultra-processed food had a higher risk of mortality.\nFor each 10% increase in the amount of UPF eaten, there was a 14% increase in\nthe number of deaths, about half of which came from cancer and cardiovascular\ndisease. A study of Spanish university students in the same year found that\npeople who ate the most ultra-processed food were one-third more likely to\ndevelop depression over 10 years than people who ate the least.\n\nProspective studies can show how people change over time and help reduce the\nproblems of reverse causality and poorly measured diets, but they don\u2019t\neliminate the core entanglement: People who follow the well-known advice to\neat fresh foods are likely different in many complicated ways from those who\nhit the drive-thru. The great majority of the evidence against ultra-processed\nfood is of a circumstantial variety. However, policymakers in a few countries\ndecided the evidence was solid enough and began enacting measures to steer\ncitizens away from UPF. \u201cUltra-processed foods and cardiometabolic health:\npublic health policies to reduce consumption cannot wait,\u201d wrote a group of\nresearchers in the British Medical Journal recently.\n\nThere is one influential study that has gone beyond observational research to\nprovide more concrete proof of how ultra-processed food affects people. In\n2019, NIH researcher Kevin Hall and a group of colleagues published a paper\nbased on an experiment in which they kept 20 subjects in a hospital setting,\ngiving half of them a UPF-heavy diet for two weeks followed by a diet based on\nminimal processing for two weeks, allowing them to eat as much food as they\nwanted at each meal. The other half had the diet with minimal processing\nfirst.\n\nThe researchers carefully arranged the two diets to be equivalent in terms of\nnutrients, energy density fiber and other attributes; they differed only in\nthe percentage of processing. While subjects were on the ultra-processed food\ndiet, they ate about 500 more calories per day, and in just two weeks they\ngained 2 pounds. During the time they ate fresh foods, they lost 2 pounds.\nFinally, there was direct evidence that ultra-processed foods could push\npeople toward obesity.\n\nOne paper, however, does not settle a complicated field. \u201cIt\u2019s a very well-\nconducted study,\u201d says Kuhnle. \u201cBut like all studies, there are limitations.\"\nFor instance, the ultra-processed foods in the study didn\u2019t have much fiber,\nso the researchers also gave people fiber supplements dissolved in water, but\nthat may not be equivalent to eating fiber. Moreover, no single, small\nexperiment could ever settle such a big nutritional question. \u201cI\u2019ve done\nstudies of flavonols (compounds found in fruit, but also used in processing)\nwith 20 or 50 people,\" Kuhnle says. \u201cThe response was always, \u2018That\u2019s a single\nstudy.\u2019 We need more studies to understand this.\u201d\n\nHall readily acknowledges that this single, small study doesn\u2019t provide a\nfinal verdict on ultra-processed food, partly because it didn\u2019t represent real\nlife. \u201cIt\u2019s a very artificial environment, where we can completely take\ncontrol over their food,\u201d he says. He also points out that we can\u2019t\nextrapolate life-long effects based on two weeks of data. \u201cOf course, that\n(level of overeating) wouldn\u2019t last forever,\u201d he says.\n\nEating more ultra-processed foods such as cereals, dark or whole-grain breads\nand yogurts was associated with slightly lower odds of developing Type 2\ndiabetes.\n\nHall, like many other researchers, says the pressing question is to find what\nexactly is wrong with processed foods\u2014that is, to identify the mechanism by\nwhich they seem to impact human health. He has reanalyzed the data from the\n2019 study and found some support for specific hypotheses that other\nresearchers have advanced. Perhaps the problem with ultra-processed food is\nits energy density; or its texture, which may encourage people to eat too\nfast; or its alleged \u201chyper-palatability,\u201d which is defined by specific\ncombinations of sugar, salt and fat. Hall and his colleagues are now running a\nsecond, similar diet trial to try to both replicate the original finding and\nalso to see if any of these hypotheses are borne out by the experiment. This\nkind of study is costly and takes about two years to run, in addition to the\npreparation and analysis.\n\nAnother challenge is that not all ultra-processed foods are alike. In many\ncases, they are not more energy-dense than whole foods. Fruit yogurt is\ngenerally less energy-dense than a homemade cookie, for instance, largely\nbecause the yogurt has more water. This is part of the problem with the\nconcept of UPF. Frozen and canned vegetables are often classified as ultra-\nprocessed, but they are in general healthier than cookies and other homemade,\ncarb-rich foods.\n\nFor many researchers, the ultra-processed food puzzle is not so puzzling. The\nproblem with processed foods, they say, is well explained by guidance that\nmainstream nutritionists have been flogging for years. \u201cA lot of ultra-\nprocessed foods have high salt, fat and sugar levels,\u201d says Kuhnle. \u201cFor most\nultra-processed foods, we don\u2019t really need the label. It\u2019s already what we\u2019d\ncall junk food.\u201d\n\nSome recent research suggests that although there are junky, unhealthful types\nof ultra-processed food, there are other subcategories that aren\u2019t so bad or\nthat might even provide a benefit. A prospective study of about 200,000 people\npublished in February 2023, found that eating more ultra-processed foods such\nas cereals, dark or whole-grain breads, yogurts and dairy desserts was\nassociated with slightly lower odds of developing Type 2 diabetes. Another\nprospective study of about 270,000 people published in November 2023 found\nthat people who ate more ultra-processed breads and cereals and plant-based\nmeat alternatives had the same or slightly lower rates of multimorbidity\n(having two or more serious health conditions) than did those who ate less of\nthem.\n\nThese studies are prone to the same kinds of confounders as other\nepidemiological research. It\u2019s possible that people who have cereal for\nbreakfast may live healthier lives in other, hard-to-measure ways. Still, they\nraise the question of whether ultra-processed foods comprise a monolithic\ncategory that should all be treated the same way, no matter what. When it\ncomes to making real-life decisions about food, many nutrition experts draw\nlines between different types of ultra-processed food. \u201cSoft drinks are banned\nin my house,\u201d says Heinz Freisling, the senior author of the multimorbidity\nstudy. \u201cBut my daughter likes this cereal stuff. She eats it. I think it is\npossible that it can be part of a healthy diet.\u201d\n\nWhen Kevin Hall spends a day in his office, he usually brings in microwavable\nfrozen lunches, even though they often contains additives to preserve flavors\nand textures through freezing and reheating. \u201cIt has lots of protein, lots of\nfiber, lots of legumes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an ultra-processed meal, but I think\nit\u2019s healthy.\u201d\n\nThese legitimate distinctions have sometimes gotten lost in a trend of blaming\nhealth problems on the ultra-processed food bogeyman. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fashion.\nI see it in the titles: ultra-processed food is connected with cancer or heart\ndisease,\u201d says Francesco Visioli, who does research on food chemistry at the\nUniversity of Padova. \u201cI disagree with following the fashion, I disagree with\nriding the wave. In five years, people will say, \u2018Whoa, slow down.\u2019 Progress\nhas to be slow.\u201d\n\nWe already have a long history of enacting nutrition policies prematurely and\nthen scrambling them later when we get better evidence, sowing confusion,\napathy and cynicism in many people\u2019s minds.\n\nConcern over the reputed effects of ultra-processed foods has led to a well-\nintentioned yet possibly misguided push to do something forcefully and quickly\nabout the issue. The dash to improve our health by condemning a new dietary\nvillain should set off alarms: We already have a long history of enacting\nnutrition policies prematurely and then scrambling them later when we get\nbetter evidence, sowing confusion, apathy and cynicism in many people\u2019s minds.\n\nThe research on ultra-processed food is picking up on something important, but\nit\u2019s not clear that the category called \u201cultra-processed food\u201d brings us\ncloser to understanding the problem or ameliorating it. Some of those highly\nprocessed foods, such as sugary drinks and processed meats, can degrade\nhealth\u2014but we\u2019ve known that for years, through other nutrition research. Most\npeople have gotten the message that they should be eating healthier fresh\nfoods that they prepared themselves, rather than unnatural stuff that comes\nout of a sealed bag bearing a long list of unpronounceable ingredients. To\nlittle avail.\n\nIn many countries, most of what people eat fits in NOVA\u2019s \"UPF\" category. It\nis folly to go to war with the majority of our food; it's also costly,\nunproductive and unfair to people without the means to buy and prepare fresh\nfoods. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can overemphasize this. You might think ultra-\nprocessed foods are causing the problem, but ultra-processed food makes up 60%\nof the food supply,\u201d says Kevin Hall, the researcher who provided the most\nwidely touted evidence against ultra-processed foods. \u201cIt\u2019s not like\ncigarettes and cancer, where nobody needs to smoke, and you could just ban\ncigarettes. People need to eat food. You can\u2019t just ban 60% of the food\nsupply, and you can\u2019t just tax 60% of the food supply.\u201d\n\nDuane Mellor, a dietitian at Aston University in England, adds that policies\nagainst ultra-processed foods could backfire if they push people away from\nprocessed \u201cgateway products\u201d that help people to prepare healthy, mostly\nnatural meals, such as shelf-stable salad dressings and soup-stock cubes.\n\nWe already have some good evidence about which foods are particularly bad, and\nfurther research will teach us more. The main goal for us now is to figure out\nhow to make it easier for people to choose healthier options and avoid the\ntrue junk, a challenge that\u2019s the same whether we call it \u201cultra-processed\u201d or\nnot. The better-processed foods can and should play a key role in replacing\nthe dangerous stuff.\n\n\u201cI think there probably is a large set of healthy, ultra-processed foods that\nare already on the market,\u201d says Hall. \u201cWe should make more of those, and\nincrease the availability of those.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of a series of OpenMind essays, podcasts and videos\nsupported by a generous grant from the Pulitzer Center's Truth Decay\ninitiative.\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\n## Tools for Readers\n\nThe Non-Foodie\u2019s Guide to Eating Healthy\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard that you should eat lots of fresh food, and there\u2019s\nabundant evidence supporting that suggestion. Some countries tell people to\neat at least five servings of vegetables and fruits a day. Many nutritionists\nrecommend sticking to the outer aisles of the supermarket (the fresh produce,\ndairy and meat areas) while avoiding the packaged foods in the middle of the\nstore.\n\nUnfortunately, for most people, it isn\u2019t practical to eat fresh food all the\ntime. Often we have limited choices, limited time, limited money or limited\ncooking skills, and we need to grab fast food or convenient food from a\npackage, most of which is heavily processed. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re doomed to\npoor health, however. There\u2019s a wide range of processed foods, many of which\nare good enough to be go-to options in a healthy diet\u2014you just need to know\nwhat to look for. Here are some pointers.\n\nThe Macro Level: Most of our food is made up of just a few chemical\ncategories: carbohydrates, fats, proteins and water. Most processed food is\nlow in water and fiber and high in carbohydrates and fats. Look at nutrition\nlabels and aim to choose foods that contain plenty of fiber and protein.\nDrinking water while you eat is a good way to replace the water that\u2019s pulled\nout of your body during digestion; water also helps you feel full faster and\nreduces overeating. The bugbears to watch out for are the \u201cs\u201d ingredients:\nsugar, saturated fat and salt/sodium.\n\nHealthy From a Box: Some ready-to-heat meals, such as fish fingers or frozen\nentrees with lots of vegetables, can be fairly healthy. Here, too, look for\nones that have lots of fiber and protein and not too much sodium.\n\nThrough the Gate: Some processed foods can be \u201cgateway products\u201d to eating\nhealthy, fresh meals. Packaged dressing offers an easy way to eat fresh\nsalads, for instance. Stock cubes make for flavorful, quick homemade soups.\n\nHow To Eat: Regardless of what kind of food you choose, you\u2019re better off\neating at a table, at a normal mealtime, with real people rather than with\nheads (or text) on a screen. Regular, social meals can help you avoid\novereating. Another tip: Embrace the Confucian idea of eating until you\u2019re 80%\nfull. Stop there and you\u2019ll often feel just right after the meal.\n\n\u2014 Amos Zeeberg\n\nBack to Top\n\nRepublish\n\nAmos Zeeberg\n\nis a freelance journalist who covers technology and science.
