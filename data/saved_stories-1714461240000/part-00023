The FCC proposed the fines in 2020, when the commission had a Republican\nmajority, and finalized them today.\n\nAll three major carriers vowed to appeal the fines after they were announced\ntoday. The three carriers also said they discontinued the data-sharing\nprograms that the fines relate to.\n\nThe fines are $80.1 million for T-Mobile, $57.3 million for AT&T, and $46.9\nmillion for Verizon. T-Mobile is also on the hook for a $12.2 million fine\nissued to Sprint, which was bought by T-Mobile shortly after the penalties\nwere proposed over four years ago.\n\nToday, the FCC summarized its findings as follows:\n\n> The FCC Enforcement Bureau investigations of the four carriers found that\n> each carrier sold access to its customers' location information to\n> \"aggregators,\" who then resold access to such information to third-party\n> location-based service providers. In doing so, each carrier attempted to\n> offload its obligations to obtain customer consent onto downstream\n> recipients of location information, which in many instances meant that no\n> valid customer consent was obtained. This initial failure was compounded\n> when, after becoming aware that their safeguards were ineffective, the\n> carriers continued to sell access to location information without taking\n> reasonable measures to protect it from unauthorized access.\n\n## \u201cShady actors\u201d got hold of data\n\nThe problem first came to light with reports of customer location data \"being\ndisclosed by the largest American wireless carriers without customer consent\nor other legal authorization to a Missouri Sheriff through a 'location-finding\nservice' operated by Securus, a provider of communications services to\ncorrectional facilities, to track the location of numerous individuals,\" the\nFCC said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said that news reports in 2018 \"revealed that\nthe largest wireless carriers in the country were selling our real-time\nlocation information to data aggregators, allowing this highly sensitive data\nto wind up in the hands of bail-bond companies, bounty hunters, and other\nshady actors. This ugly practice violates the law\u2014specifically Section 222 of\nthe Communications Act, which protects the privacy of consumer data.\"\n\nFor a time after the 2018 reports, \"all four carriers continued to operate\ntheir programs without putting in place reasonable safeguards to ensure that\nthe dozens of location-based service providers with access to their customers'\nlocation information were actually obtaining customer consent,\" the FCC said.\n\nThe three carriers are ready to challenge the fines in court. \"This industry-\nwide third-party aggregator location-based services program was discontinued\nmore than five years ago after we took steps to ensure that critical services\nlike roadside assistance, fraud protection and emergency response would not be\ndisrupted,\" T-Mobile said in a statement provided to Ars. \"We take our\nresponsibility to keep customer data secure very seriously and have always\nsupported the FCC's commitment to protecting consumers, but this decision is\nwrong, and the fine is excessive. We intend to challenge it.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n30\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
