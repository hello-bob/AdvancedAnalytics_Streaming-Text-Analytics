Your startup deserves a\nquality network. Join Mercury Raise.\n\nWe interrupt your scheduled programming for a special edition of Unicorner.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been with us for a minute, you might remember Tom White and his\nprevious special edition on the deep tech VC rpv.\n\nTom is back this week, but as a guest editor\u2014and we\u2019re excited to welcome\nArkady Kulik, founder and managing partner at rpv, as our guest contributor.\n\n### How involved are you in VC?  \n  \n---  \n  \n  * Raising money right now!\n  * I've raised in the past\n  * Might raise in the future, we'll see\n  * I'm an investor... it's my job\n\n  \nLogin or Subscribe to participate in polls.  \n  \n\\- Arek and Ethan + Tom \ud83e\udd84\n\n# On Fundraising: How to Deal with Bad Actors\n\n#### Ignore Ghosts, Laugh at Clowns, and Ban Players\n\nWritten by Arkady Kulik, Edited by Tom White\n\n\u275d\n\nWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.\n\nMaya Angelou\n\nHappy fundraises are short and sweet; unhappy ones are interminable,\nfrustrating, and full of wailing and gnashing of teeth. In the nineteen years\nof my entrepreneurial journey, I bootstrapped my first company to multimillion\nsuccess and later raised over $30m as both a founder and a VC.\n\nThe internet is awash with advice \u2014 some good, most bad, a small bit downright\nugly \u2014 on navigating the fundraising process. Strategies and opinions on cold\noutreach, storytelling, et cetera, abound. Such resources suggest a world\nwhere you have unlimited time and energy to pursue these activities. Yet, the\nreality is starkly different: our resources are finite.\n\nMy goal with this paper is to protect your most valuable resource: your time.\n\nTo do it, you need to know how to identify:\n\n  * Ghosts who never respond\n\n  * Clowns who fail to walk their talk\n\n  * Players who have a hidden agenda\n\nThe patterns described below are general behaviors exhibited in the specific\ncontext of the specific fundraises. Do not take them as a holistic description\nof any individual. Always assume good intent. People are rarely malicious; the\nreality is they are simply lazy, disorganized, or don\u2019t care. While some are\nindeed unreliable all the time, others are only unreliable in certain ways or\ncontexts.\n\n## Ignore Ghosts\n\nGhosts are people who abruptly stop communicating with you after initial\nconversations or email exchanges.\n\nDisclaimer: not answering to a cold outreach does not make one a ghost.\n\nGhosts are easy to recognize: you had a conversation or an email exchange and\nthey disappear, ignoring each and every one of your follow ups.\n\nProductive engagement is a sign of respect. If someone respects you and sees\nthe value in what you are building, they will find a minute to tell you what\nthey decided. If they don\u2019t send you a \u201cwe\u2019ve decided to pass\u201d message and\nghost you, they are not worth your time.\n\nHow to deal with ghosts: Don\u2019t be afraid to follow up! People are busy and\nfollow-ups are expected. However, if someone is ghosting you after three\nfollow ups \u2014 stop following up and start ignoring them. Even if they later\nshow up in the same fundraise \u2014 pay them no attention as they are not serious.\n\nProfessional investors will always find the time to send you a pass note.\n\nTop-tier investors will specifically explain why they have passed.\n\n## Join Quality Networks\n\nIn partnership with Mercury\n\nYour startup deserves quality investors and connections.\n\nMercury does more than simplify your startup\u2019s banking* and financial\noperations. They offer the network, connections, and industry expertise\nstartups need to succeed.\n\nAs a founder, you\u2019re constantly balancing the day-to-day and working to\nrealize the larger vision for your company.

Their words are worthless; they\nsimply tell you what you want to hear just to keep you engaged.\n\nClowns are easy to recognize: they often volunteer to do something for you or\neven immediately commit on the very first call. Though overly enthusiastic,\nthey somehow never follow through. As you are following up, they come up with\nexcuses and speak more empty promises.\n\nTrue story: I once had a prospective LP who swore on his mother\u2019s grave that\nhe would sign by a certain date. He never did.\n\nFolks who don\u2019t do what they have promised will be like that with everything:\nsigning paperwork, wiring funds, etc. They are either too busy, too\ndisorganized, or simply don\u2019t care about you. Interactions with them will\nalways end up in broken hopes.\n\nHow to deal with clowns: disengage and cut off the conversation/connection if\nsomeone is not walking their talk. On top of saving time and energy, you are\nsaving yourself from lasting disappointment.\n\nProfessional investors will do what they\u2019ve promised.\n\nTop-tier investors will do what they\u2019ve promised very quickly.\n\n## Ban Players\n\nPeople who pretend to be investors are players. Perhaps they enjoy the status\nof the title or the inherent power dynamic. Maybe they\u2019re simply bored or\nlonely. The point is \u2013 they're looking for a feeling, not an investment.\nMaking money is not their goal, playing a game is.\n\nOf all bad actors, these are the worst. They will waste all of the time you\nare willing to give them and never wire money (even after they have signed the\npaperwork).\n\nDon\u2019t feed their egos.\n\nPlayers are the most difficult to recognize. They are largely good at\ndeception. For some, deception IS the very game they play \u2013 they enjoy lying\nor withholding information in order to feel superior to you. Understanding a\nplayer\u2019s background and true motivation is the key to recognizing them in the\nwild.\n\nPlayer archetypes include (again, all names are fictional):\n\n## #1: Lupus\n\nLupus feels and acts like a king of the world. He made some cash as a\ncorporate and now seeks a raw feeling of power that he expects from the\ninherent power dynamic between founders and investors. As a sadist, he enjoys\ntorturing you.\n\nTell-tale signs are:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 He behaves like an expert in areas he doesn\u2019t understand.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 When he asks questions, he is not looking for answers, he is looking to make\nyou squirm. The more frustrated you are, the happier he is.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 His questions are endless and he is never satisfied. Often he will rephrase\nthe same questions and reask them.\n\nHow to deal with Lupus: test how receptive they are to power dynamic plays.\nFor example, start doubting their capability to invest or even ask the right\nquestions. If it angers them, you found your Lupus. Stop the relationship.\n\n## #2: Octavius\n\nOctavius just knows that he is the smartest guy in the room. If someone dares\nto point out that it\u2019s not true, he explodes. He seeks superiority and will\nlie and cheat his way for this fleeting sensation.\n\nTell-tale signs are:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 He tells you what you want to hear and sometimes even does what he has\npromised. He is 80% clown, but every time you feel like cutting the link, he\ncomes through and you decide to give him another chance.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 He meets hiccups on every step of the process and offers ridiculous excuses:\nnever received an email, had to urgently travel somewhere, etc.\n\nHow to deal with Octavius: give them strict deadlines and do not tolerate a\nsingle slip up. Stop engaging until they complete everything they promised. Be\nready to never see these promises realized.\n\n## #3: Severina\n\nSeverina heard that being a VC is cool, so she decided to launch a fund for\nthe sake of social status. Whether she has a fund or not, she runs around\npromising investments to everyone and basks in unearned gratitude. She\ndesperately wants to be cool.\n\nTell-tale signs are:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 She commits very quickly and is always very optimistic.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Her due diligence was superficial if it was conducted at all.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 You\u2019ve heard from others that she has committed, but doesn\u2019t sign or wire.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 You\u2019ve heard that she might not even have a fund yet.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 She might sneak a finder\u2019s fee in her paperwork and promise to take care of\nyour whole round for you. Real investors do not like finder\u2019s fees and having\nthem in the mix might destroy your chances with a legit investor.\n\nHow to deal with Severina: Begin by asking how many investments they have made\nin the past 3-6 months. Then ask for a couple of references from current\ninvestments. If possible, conduct your own background check. Once your\nsuspicions are confirmed, disregard anything Severina has to say and don\u2019t be\nsurprised if her verbal commitment never turns into a check.\n\nSide note \u2013 never sign any side letters with the finder's fee language; that\ncontract might force you to pay these fees even if you raise money without\ntheir help.\n\n## #4: Edwina\n\nEdwina is looking for a source of income and pretends to be an investor to\nboost her value. She is fishing around to become an advisor, mentor,\nconsultant or something of that nature. She will never invest because she\nsimply doesn\u2019t have the money.\n\nTell-tale signs are:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 She LOVES your company and is very vocal about it with you.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 She is happy to immediately join you, no matter the capacity.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Her promises about investment timelines are vague. She is \u201cwaiting for a\nliquidity event\u201d or \u201chas to talk with her spouse\u201d or some other reason to\ndelay a decision.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Once engaged as an advisor/mentor, she creates zero value, produces no\nintroductions, and helps with nothing of consequence.\n\nHow to deal with Edwina: have a vesting period and a cliff period (at least\nthree months) in all your advisory agreements. 90% of Edwinas would be scared\noff by that, the rest will show no value during the cliff period. Either way \u2013\nyou won\u2019t lose anything. Better yet, avoid them entirely \u2013 their advice is\nrarely correct or helpful.\n\n## #5: Regulus\n\nRegulus is bored. He has successfully sold a startup and doesn\u2019t know what to\ndo next. He thinks \u201cWell, why not invest in startups?\u201d\n\nTell-tale signs are:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 There is no investment process as investing is a leisure activity for\nRegulus.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 He is inconsistent in his communication. It happens in bursts.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 His conviction doesn\u2019t have a trend: he can be very excited initially,\ncompletely discouraged the next day, ready to commit a couple of weeks later,\nand then disappear entirely once it\u2019s time to sign.\n\nHow to deal with Regulus: ask them straightaway what their process is. If\nthere is no clarity, drive the relationship yourself. Tell them what other\ninvestors tend to do at the current stage, proactively seek their questions,\nand push them to reach a decision.\n\nHow to deal with players in general: if someone is trying to play you \u2013 cut\nthem loose as soon as you recognize that behavior. Don\u2019t trust a word they\nsay, don\u2019t allow them to invest in your company and make sure that they are\nnot a part of your life at all.\n\nLife is too short to spend on people who want to harm you. The book Games\nPeople Play is a great way to delve more deeply into that topic.\n\nProfessional investors don\u2019t play games. They clearly understand their\npersonal motivation: some want to make money, others want to advance space\nexploration, others want to cure diseases. All of these investors are for\nreal.\n\nTop-tier investors make money and fulfill their life mission simultaneously.\n\n## Befriend Reliable Actors\n\nNow that you know how to identify and deal with bad actors, it's time to learn\nhow to identify professional investors. Focus your time and energy on them.\n\nHow to recognize professional investors:\n\n  * They have a clear investment process and articulate it concisely. Ask them about it at the end of the first meeting and listen to how they talk about it.\n\n  * They have a reasonable (even if broad) thesis and they have an idea (even if vague) on what they are looking for.\n\n  * They respond to your follow ups. Build a follow up cadence (ideally, 3 to 5 touch points) and track to which follow up they have responded.\n\n  * They are helping you before they have invested. It might be advice on deck composition, an intro to another investor, or anything else that creates value.\n\n  * If they pass - they will write a note, even if it is formal and opaque. They will leave the door open for future opportunities.\n\nHow to recognize top-tier investors:\n\n  * They drive the investment process. You don\u2019t have to remind them or chase them, they are proactive in gathering the needed data. Nick Tawil excels at that.\n\n  * They have a laser-sharp focus and can articulate in simple terms why it works for them right now. Adam Draper stands out for me.\n\n  * They respond without follow ups. If you never had to initiate your follow up cadence, this is a sure sign. Ben Ehrlich has never made me chase him.\n\n  * They help very fast. The best of investors will send you an introduction while you are still on the call. Special shout-out to Dave McClure.\n\n  * If they pass, they will write a clear response with easy-to-understand reasons and might even give advice on how to improve your proposal. Evan Finkel does this with clarity and compassion.\n\nHow to build relationships with professional and top-tier investors:\n\nOnce you find professional investors \u2013 ask yourself if you like them as\npeople.\n\nWould you want to have a relationship with them if there was no business\nbetween you? Do you see them as guests in your house? Would you go on a\nvacation together?\n\nOnce you know they are the real deal, hold them close and treat them as\nfriends.\n\nBe helpful, open, empathetic and kind. Keep your eyes open for potential\ninvestment targets for them or just send them a video or meme their way every\nnow and again. You might even find an LP for your investor, opportunities to\nbe helpful are endless!\n\nIf you don\u2019t genuinely like them as people, disengage. You will never have a\ntrusting and genuine relationship with them. Remember, you are locked in with\nthese people for the long run. The average VC fund lasts longer than the\naverage marriage.\n\n## Afterword\n\nDo not let bad actors get you down.\n\nTheir actions are a reflection of who they are, not who you are.\n\nRecognize their motives and move on.\n\nFocus your time and energy on reliable people who share your passion and\nvalues.\n\nDon\u2019t just wait for the future, build it.\n\nP.S.
