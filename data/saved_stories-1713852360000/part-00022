Are we going to pay the tab?\n\nDisclosure / advertisement: I work for Sentry.\n\nWith XZ we\u2019re in a fresh round of proposals to fix Open Source sustainability.\nOne thing I\u2019m seeing more of this time around is an appetite for tax-based\napproaches. Tim Bray proposes OSQI. Matthew Hodgson also calls for government\nfunding. I\u2019ve pitched a weird hybrid \u201cvoluntary tax.\u201d\n\nEurope is (unsurprisingly) further along with tax-based approaches than the\nUnited States. Sovereign Tech Fund is off and running in Germany. FOSSEPS\nseems to be coming along behind at the EU scope.\n\nTax-based programs tend to be grant-driven, similar to what we see with\nindustrial philanthropies in the U.S. such as the Sloan Foundation. With this\nmodel, maintainers apply for funding for a certain scope of work, and the\ngovernment or charity follows up to ensure the work they are funding gets\ndone. It\u2019s basically the tried and true consulting model for subsidizing Open\nSource, but with a government (or non-profit) as the client.\n\nGrant programs do not get us to sustainability as I define it:\n\n> Open Source sustainability is when any smart, motivated person can produce\n> widely adopted Open Source software and get paid fairly without jumping\n> through hoops.\n\nGrants are hoops.\n\n## The Restaurant Analogy\n\nI\u2019ve hit upon an analogy that I think clarifies our situation. It\u2019s buried in\n\u201cA Vision for Software Commons,\u201d but there\u2019s a lot going on there and I think\nthis is a good enough idea to warrant its own post.\n\n### Not a Grocery Store\n\nOpen Source is not a grocery store. At a grocery store (or pretty much any\nother store, but this analogy works best if we use food), you pay first, then\nyou get to eat.\n\nThis is analogous to thinking of payments to Open Source projects in terms of\nROI: what am I getting in the future for the money I am paying now? This\ndoesn\u2019t work, because you already used the software. You can pay for other\nthings adjacent to the software\u2014consulting, packaging, hosting, and so forth.\nThese subsidize Open Source but do not directly sustain it. ROI as a mechanism\ndepends on scarcity, and Open Source is essentially, intentionally non-scarce.\n\n### Not a Soup Kitchen\n\nOpen Source is not a soup kitchen. Payments to Open Source projects are not\ndonations, they are not charity. They would be if someone else ate the meal,\nbut you ate it.\n\nCompanies are by definition not geared towards making charitable donations.\nYes, corporate philanthropy is a thing. It\u2019s peanuts. I\u2019m seeing maybe $25\nbillion/year, on a U.S. economy of $25 trillion a year. Open Source likely\naccounts for 100s of billions of this value and currently recoups 100s of\nmillions (PDF). We need to grow Open Source income by several orders of\nmagnitude. Calling it charity is a doomed approach. Fortunately, it\u2019s also not\naccurate.\n\n### A Restaurant\n\nOpen Source is a restaurant. At a restaurant, you eat your meal first, and\nthen you are expected to pay for it. Yes, we could dine and dash. But we\ndon\u2019t. When presented with a tab for a meal we have just eaten, we pay the\ntab.\n\nNow picture a meal with a large group of friends. Inevitably, someone forgot\ntheir wallet\u2014or \u201cforgot\u201d \u201ctheir\u201d \u201cwallet.\u201d The rest of the group has to pick\nup their share. Sometimes, one person gets stuck with the whole tab.\n\nOur companies are sitting around the table. Open Source is the meal we consume\nyear after year. We need to split the check. Be careful here: I\u2019m not saying\nwe should tip Open Source projects. I\u2019m saying we should pay our bill. If some\ncompanies want to tip extra, more power to them.\n\n### Residential \u21d2 Commercial \u21d2 Collective\n\nHobby projects are akin to residential kitchens. Mounting expectations such as\nCRA and EO 14028 are akin to OSHA inspections. We need Open Source foundations\nto become commercial kitchens, as it were, fit to deliver at scale. At the\nsame time, we need foundations to find ways of funding individuals that fit\nthe Open Source ethos of collaborative autonomy. If Open Source is to be a\nrestaurant, let it be the Moosewood Collective.\n\n## A New Bucket\n\nCompanies already have a few big buckets that make sense to them to account\nfor money they spend:\n\n  * Taxes\u2014they pay because they have to or (at some point) they\u2019ll be disciplined by government.\n  * Purchases\u2014they pay because they want the product or service they are buying.\n  * Donations\u2014they pay because ... well, they don\u2019t really, if we\u2019re honest. It\u2019s couch pennies.\n\nWe need a new bucket:\n\n  * Fair Share\u2014they pay because, at the very least, they don\u2019t want to be seen by their peers as deadbeats.\n\nLook, don\u2019t get me wrong. This is a huge honkin\u2019 deal. We\u2019re essentially\nasking our corporations to become a little teensy tiny bit less sociopathic\nthan they currently by nature are. Everything is against us. There\u2019s no way\nthis could possibly work. Unless enough of us collectively want it to work.\n\nI want it to work.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Chad Whitacre \u2767 Home\n\n#### Thank you!\n\nYou have successfully joined our subscriber list.\n\n\ud83e\udd7a\n\n", "frontpage": false}
