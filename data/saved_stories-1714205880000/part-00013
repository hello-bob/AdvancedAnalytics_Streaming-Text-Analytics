As 404 Media\nreports, the issue was originally brought to Google's attention by US Sen. Ron\nWyden (D-Ore.) as part of a \"review of the privacy practices of streaming TV\ntechnology providers.\" Google originally told the senator that the issue was\nexpected behavior but, after media coverage, decided to change its stance and\nissue some kind of patch.\n\n\"My office is mid-way through a review of the privacy practices of streaming\nTV technology providers,\" Wyden told 404 Media. \"As part of that inquiry, my\nstaff discovered an alarming video in which a YouTuber demonstrated how with\n15 minutes of unsupervised access to an Android TV set-top box, a criminal\ncould get access to private emails of the Gmail user who set up the TV.\"\n\nThe video in question was a PSA from YouTuber Cameron Gray, and it shows that\ngrabbing any Android TV device and sideloading a few apps will grant access to\nthe current Google account. This is obvious if you know how Android works, but\nit's not obvious to most users looking at a limited TV interface.\n\nThe heart of the issue is how Android treats your Google account. Since the OS\nstarted on phones, every Android device starts with the assumption that it is\na private, one-person device. Google has built on top of that feature with\nmultiuser support and guest accounts, but these aren't part of the default\nsetup flow, can be hard to find, and are probably disabled on many Android TV\nboxes. The result is that signing in to an Android TV device often gives it\naccess to your entire Google account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndroid has a centralized Google account system shared by a million Google-\ncentric background and syncing processes, the Play Store, and nearly all\nGoogle apps. When you boot an Android device for the first time, the guided\nsetup asks for a Google account, which is expected to live on the device\nforever as the owner's primary account. Any new Google app you add to your\ndevice automatically gets access to this central Google account repository, so\nif you set up the phone and then install Google Keep, Keep automatically gets\nsigned in and gains access to your notes. During the initial setup, where you\nmight install 10 different apps that use a Google account, it would be\nannoying to enter your username and password over and over again.\n\nThis centralized account system is hungry for Google accounts, so any Google\naccount you use to sign in to any Google app gets sucked into the central\naccount system, even if you decline the initial setup. A common annoyance is\nto have a Google Workspace account at work, then sign into Gmail for work\nemail and then have to deal with this useless work account showing up in the\nPlay Store, Maps, Photos, etc.\n\nFor TVs, this presents a unique gotcha because, while you will still be forced\nto log in to download something from the Play Store, it's not obvious to the\nuser that you're granting this device access to your entire Google\naccount\u2014including to potentially sensitive things like location history,\nemails, and messages. To the average user, a TV device just shows \"TV stuff\"\nlike your YouTube recommendations and a few TV-specific Play Store apps, so\nyou might not consider it to be a high-sensitivity sign-in. But if you just\nsideload a few more Google apps, you can get access to anything. Further\nconfusing matters is Google's OAuth strategy, which teaches users that there\nare things like scoped access to a Google account on third-party devices or\nsites, but Android does not work that way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the video, Gray simply grabs an Android TV device, goes to a third-party\nAndroid app site, then sideloads Chrome. Chrome automatically signs in to the\nTV owner's Google account and has access to all passwords and cookies, which\nmeans access to Gmail, Photos, Chat history, Drive files, YouTube accounts,\nAdSense, any site that allows for Google sign-in, and partial credit card\ninfo. It's all available in Chrome without any security checks. Individual\napps like Gmail and Google Photos would immediately start working, too.\n\nAs Gray's video points out, Android TV devices can be dongles, set-top boxes,\nor code installed right into a TV. In businesses and hotels, they can be semi-\npublic devices. It's also not hard to imagine a TV device falling into the\nhands of someone else. You might not worry too much about forgetting a $30\nChromecast in a hotel room, or you might sign in to a hotel TV and forget to\ndelete your account, or you might throw out a TV and not think twice about\nwhat account it's signed in to. If an attacker gets access to any of these\ndevices later, it's trivial to unlock your entire Google account.\n\nGoogle says it has fixed this problem, though it doesn't explain how. The\ncompany's statement to 404 says, \"Most Google TV devices running the latest\nversions of software already do not allow this depicted behavior. We are in\nthe process of rolling out a fix to the rest of the devices. As a best\nsecurity practice, we always advise users to update their devices to the\nlatest software.\u201d\n\nMany Android TV devices, especially those built-in to TV sets, are abandonware\nand run an old version of the software, but Google's account system is\nupdatable via the Play Store, so there's a good chance a fix can roll out to\nmost devices.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n27\n\nRon Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in\nAndroid OS and Google products.
