Download the app.\n\nAbout a decade ago, when I first learned about risk management in my college\noutdoors club, I was taught that assuming the \u201clightning position\u201d was the\nbest way to protect yourself in a thunderstorm (spoiler alert: it does bugger-\nall). If you managed to avoid this particular tidbit of backcountry lore,\nallow me to provide a refresher: the lightning position involves crouching\ndown on a sleeping pad with your heels touching, your chest pressed against\nyour knees, and your hands clamped over your ears. It\u2019s supposed to limit your\nlikelihood of getting electrocuted.\n\nOver the last few years, many outdoor education groups have softened their\nstance, now saying the lightning position can only slightly mitigate risk and\nshould only be used as a last resort. But many, including the National Outdoor\nLeadership School (NOLS), still recommend sitting on a sleeping pad as a way\nto help insulate your body from ground strikes (it doesn\u2019t). And others,\nincluding the Boy Scouts, say touching metal can increase your risk of getting\nstruck (another myth).\n\nFew hikers take the time to regularly upgrade their knowledge. That\u2019s because\nsafety research is a total pain. It\u2019s much more fun to authoritatively parrot\ndecades-old adages back to our friends and family (guilty). So, allow me to\nprovide our overdue update. Here\u2019s what\u2019s actually true about lightning safety\nin the backcountry.\n\n#### Similar Reads\n\nThis 10-Day Road Trip Through Utah Is a Hiker\u2019s Dream\n\nI Survived a Lightning Strike\n\nThe 5 Best Hikes on the Appalachian Trail, as Chosen By a Thru-Hiker\n\nA Dozen Ways to Die\n\n## The lightning position is actually bogus.\n\nNOLS teaches that the lightning position is a good option if you find yourself\ntrapped in the open with nowhere else to go. But according to Dr. Ron Holle, a\nmeteorologist and safety specialist for the Lightning Safety Council, that\u2019s\nnot necessarily the case.\n\n\u201cThe lightning position is useless,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of speculative,\n\u2018I suppose this could work,\u2019 sort of advice out there. But I have a file\ncabinet with about 5,000 cases of people being killed or injured by lightning,\nand none of those \u2018I suppose\u2019 methods work.\u201d\n\nDr. Kristin Calhoun, a research scientist with the National Severe Storms\nLaboratory, is inclined to agree.\n\n\u201cIf I was in an open field, I wouldn\u2019t assume that position,\u201d she says. \u201cI\nwould run.\u201d Finding lower ground and getting under uniform tree cover are some\nof the few things that can measurably decrease your lightning risk, she says.\nShe adds that standing or sitting on a sleeping pad \u201cmakes no difference\u201d that\nshe\u2019s aware of. Better to leave the pad in your pack and focus on moving to a\nsafer location.\n\n## You can get struck by a storm that\u2019s up to 10 miles away.\n\nMany of us have stood on a ridge or mountaintop, seen a storm building in the\ndistance, and told ourselves we still had time. That\u2019s a dangerous\nmisconception, says Calhoun.\n\n\u201cPeople often don\u2019t worry about a storm until it\u2019s actively raining over\nthem,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut it\u2019s often the first flash of lightning that\u2019s the\nmost deadly because people haven\u2019t taken protective action yet.\u201d\n\n## Standing under a tree can sometimes be worse than standing out in the open.\n\nLightning tends to strike the tallest object on a landscape. So, if you\u2019re\nstanding on a tall ridge, your head is that high point (not ideal). But\nstanding under a tall or solitary tree can sometimes be worse. That\u2019s because\ndirect strikes\u2014instances where people get hit directly by a bolt\u2014only account\nfor 3 to 5 percent of all lightning-related injuries. But ground\nstrikes\u2014instances where people are shocked by electricity traveling through\nthe ground\u2014account for up to 50 percent of injuries.\n\nIf you\u2019re standing under a tree, you could be at potentially greater risk than\nif you were standing out in the open. That\u2019s because lightning is more likely\nto hit a 100-foot-tall tree than a 5-foot-tall person. And if it does, the\nhiker beneath it is first in line for the aftershock.\n\n\u201cIf lightning hits the tree, the ground current will go down through the tree\nand then back up through the ground,\u201d Calhoun explains. If you\u2019re far from the\ntrunk, the electricity may have time to disperse before it gets to you. But if\nyou\u2019re right next to it, you\u2019ll get the brunt of the shock. Calhoun\u2019s\nrecommendation: find a large patch of shorter trees of uniform height to stand\nunder instead.\n\n## Metal doesn\u2019t actually attract lightning.\n\n\u201cLightning is not attracted to metal,\u201d Holle says. \u201cIt travels through metal,\nbut it\u2019s not attracted to it.\u201d Lightning is only attracted to three things, he\nsays: tall structures, isolated structures, and pointed structures. \u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t matter if those structures are made of metal or wood.\u201d\n\nThat said, if lightning hits a structure because it\u2019s tall, the metal material\nmay conduct the lightning to the ground more quickly and therefore more\npowerfully than if it were wood or plastic. So, if you\u2019re at a campsite with a\nbear-hang pole, try not to pitch your tent near it.\n\n\u201cThe metal can conduct electricity, which can jump to a tent 10 to 20 feet\naway,\u201d Calhoun says.\n\n## Crouching can help\u2014but lying down makes things worse.\n\nCrouching reduces your likelihood of being the tallest point on a landscape.\nBut, paradoxically, lying down puts you in even more danger than standing up.\nThat\u2019s because when you\u2019re lying down, you maximize your contact with the\nground. That makes ground strikes more likely to affect you. It also makes it\nmore likely that a ground strike could enter your body through a foot and exit\nthrough your arm or neck\u2014arcing through your heart along the way.\n\n## A tent provides no shelter from lightning.\n\n\u201cThere are only two real places you\u2019re safe from lightning: in a real building\nwith wiring or plumbing, which creates a Faraday cage effect, or in a metal-\ntopped vehicle,\u201d says Ron Holle, a meteorologist. A tent, however, provides no\nshelter.\n\n\u201cSince 2006, more people have died [from lightning strikes] while camping in\ntents than while hiking by themselves,\u201d Calhoun says. \u201cYou also see these\nhorrific accidents where numerous people are injured at once because they\u2019re\nin a confined area that gets struck.\u201d\n\nSo, if you\u2019re pitching a tent, put it somewhere you wouldn\u2019t mind standing in\na storm: below treeline, away from tall ridges, and ideally between stands of\nuniformly tall trees.\n\n## Hiding in a cave is a bad idea.\n\nIf you\u2019re caught in a storm and encounter a dry cave or rocky overhang, you\nmight think it a gift. Think again, Calhoun says.\n\nIf the electrical strike is traveling along the edge of a cliff and encounters\nthe mouth of a cave, it\u2019s not going to take the trouble to travel around the\nroof of the cave to the floor. Instead, it\u2019s going to jump to you, and use\nyour body as a shortcut. Sheltering from the rain might sound nice, but it\u2019s\nbetter to keep moving.\n\n## There\u2019s no such thing as getting \u201caccidentally\u201d caught in a storm.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t \u2018caught\u2019 in a storm,\u201d Holle says. \u2018There was some error in your\ndecision making.\u201d\n\nModern weather forecasting is extremely accurate, he explains\u2014as long as you\ncheck the weather for your trail or peak, not for the nearest town. If the\nforecast calls for some chance of a storm, there\u2019s no excuse not to heed it.\n\u201cBut over and over again, I see people plan for a specific hike or fourteener\nor whatever, and they feel like they have to go on the day they\u2019ve set aside,\u201d\nhe says. Summit fever is a big problem. And Holle suspects that people on\naverage have less respect for lightning now than they did 10 or 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cThere are so many more people doing these activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a\nnew generation coming up that needs to be reminded of the risks.\u201d\n\n## Bonus: Lightning Fun Facts\n\nLighting may be dangerous, but it\u2019s also one of nature\u2019s greatest wonders.\nOnce you get to safety, feel free to sit back and marvel.\n\n  * Lightning always causes thunder\u2014even if you don\u2019t hear it. When lightning strikes, the air around the bolt heats up and expands so fast that it sends air molecules shooting outward in every direction. This heat-induced shockwave creates the sound we know as thunder. And it\u2019s there even if you don\u2019t hear it. \u201cHeat lightning,\u201d for example, isn\u2019t silent or special\u2014it\u2019s just regular lightning that\u2019s far away.\n  * Different types of lightning sound different. A short, quick bang means a fast, cloud-to-ground flash happened nearby, says Calhoun. But a long, continuous rumble means lightning is arcing more horizontally. Each beat of the rumble is the sound of a leader breaking off from the main streamer and forking away from you through the sky.\n  * A single bolt of lightning can cover a whole state. Geostationary satellites often measure bolts that are hundreds of miles long. In 2021, researchers recorded one that was 477 miles in length and stretched across parts of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n  * Volcanoes can also cause lighting. Clouds of exploding volcanic dust can also build up electric charge. (So can tornado and hurricane clouds.) Often, the charge is sufficient to spark lightning bolts over an erupting volcano.\n  * Lightning helps fertilize the soil. Lightning tears through the air with enough force to break apart airborne nitrogen molecules. That leaves nitrogen atoms free to combine with oxygen, creating molecules called \u201cnitrates\u201d that are essential for soil and plant health.\n\nFrom 2024\n\nCorey Buhay\n\nCorey is a Colorado-based writer and editor specializing in outdoor adventure\njournalism.\n\n### Popular on Backpacker\n\n## NAVIGATION \u2013 DESERT\n\n### Keywords:\n\n### Related content from the Outside Network\n\n#### What\u2019s It Like to Go on a 200-Person Hike?
