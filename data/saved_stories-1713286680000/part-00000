At least one owner has posted a video outlining their experience with\na fault in the design of the Cybertruck's accelerator pedal.\n\nAs shown in the video below, the cover of the pedal can slip off and lodge\nitself into a seam in the driver's side footwell, causing the pedal to remain\npressed.\n\n### Get Fully Charged\n\nThe Cybertruck's Rough Launch\n\nTesla has run the gauntlet with Cybertruck launch problems. From incorrectly\ninstalled door latches to awful panel gaps, and plenty of reports of loss of\npower, critics are rightfully slamming the brand for its quality control. This\naccelerator pedal problem, if widespread, could be Tesla's biggest safety\ndoozy for the Cybertruck to date.\n\nFortunately, the owner who experienced this issue was able to stop the\nacceleration by pressing the brake, which cuts power to the drive motors.\nHowever, as soon as the driver lifted their foot off of the brake, they\nreported that the truck immediately accelerated at full throttle. Kind of\nscary considering the 6,800-pound truck can sprint from 0-60 mph in under 2.7\nseconds.\n\nAt the time of writing, Tesla has not publicly commented on the reason for the\ndelay, nor confirmed if the reported stop-sale is due to the accelerator pedal\nissue. Likewise, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not\npublished any complaints that would indicate a pedal defect or current recall.\n\n### Cookie Settings\n\nThis content is blocked by security settings.\n\nPlease click on button for showing it.\n\nOpen settings\n\nCybertruck buyers across the country, including those in California, North\nCarolina, Missouri and New Jersey, have recently been informed that deliveries\nof their trucks have been delayed. Those affected asked for the reasoning\nbehind the delay but were reportedly met with silence.\n\nWould-be owners theorized that the recent viral post regarding the accelerator\npedal is responsible for the delay. This remains officially unconfirmed,\nthough popular Tesla proponent Omar Qazi, aka WholeMarsCatalog, posted X that\ndeliveries have been halted due to \"an issue with the accelerator pedal.\"\n\nDrive Tesla reports that information shared with the blog attributes the pedal\nshift to \"lubricant residue\" present from production. However, it's worth also\ncalling out that there doesn't appear to be any fasteners holding the pedal\ncover on, which means that the cover could be either friction-fit or held on\nwith adhesive, possibly a product of cost savings. Drive Tesla also reports\nthat Tesla anticipates readying a fix to resume deliveries as early as April\n20.\n\nAnother user on X added that Tesla was working ASAP to source and ship a new\nversion of this cover to service centers and delivery locations. No more\nelectric trucks will be delivered until the new covers are installed, the X\nuser said citing multiple Tesla service centers.\n\nSeveral owners seem to have received the following message from Tesla:\n\n> We have just been informed of an unexpected delay regarding the preparation\n> of your vehicle. We need to cancel your delivery appointment and we will\n> reach out again when we're able to get you back on the schedule. We\n> apologize for the inconvenience and look forward to hosting your Cybertruck\n> delivery soon.\n\nInterestingly, an owner pointed out a problem with their Cybertruck that\nresulted in the truck hitting a pole in early April. The owner posted to the\nCybertruck Owners Club forum where they were met with skepticism until they\nposted photos of the accident. Even still, members of the forum believe there\nwas more to the story.\n\nIf this is indeed a more widespread problem, it will almost certainly result\nin an official recall. The entire situation is reminiscent of Toyota's 2.3\nmillion vehicle recall in 2010 due to the accelerator pedal potentially\nbecoming mechanically stuck and resulting in unintended acceleration. Though\nmany of those claims were overblown and the issue was often due to misuse and\nimproper floor mat placement, the incident was a crushing blow to Toyota's\nreputation and bottom line for several years.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, opinion, and more delivered straight to your\ninbox, daily.\n\nSign Up Today\n\nMeanwhile, the Cybertruck launch has been rough. Owners have been reporting\nproblem after problem, many even finding their trucks on the back of a tow\ntruck, as their vehicles couldn't be driven.\n\nCrowdsourced data from November 2023 suggested that Cybertruck reservations\nhad surpassed 2 million. And the waiting period for new orders hovers around 5\nyears.\n\nTesla previously said that it planned to produce 125,000 Cybertrucks annually\nat its Gigafactory Texas and scale up to 250,000 by 2025. Cox Automotive data\nshowed that Tesla delivered only about 2,803 Cybertrucks in Q1 2024.\n\nAn InsideEVs investigation from earlier this month also found that Cybertruck\nowners were facing teething issues with their trucks. They mentioned problems\nrelated to electrical harnesses, onboard Power Conversion System (PCS)\nfailures, broken drive units and steering and braking problems among several\nothers. Tesla service centers fixed some issues fairly quickly, while others\ntook much longer to resolve.\n\nNew vehicle releases can be hard\u2014just ask Ford. But some of these problems are\nflagging Tesla's vehicles as unreliable, especially if they can't prop up the\nquality control of a $100,000 truck.\n\nThe roadblock in Cybertruck deliveries comes at a time when CEO Elon Musk\u2019s\nbrand is trying to navigate a rocky road, especially in 2024.\n\nThe $25,000 affordable Tesla is reportedly scrapped, with the focus now being\nthe Tesla Robotaxi which will be revealed on August 8. Tesla\u2019s Q1 sales are\ndown significantly whereas an increasing number of EVs from rival brands are\nnow gaining traction, including the Cadillac Lyriq, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq\n6, Kia EV6 and Ford Mustang Mach-E among others.\n\nMore issues with the Cybertruck is the last thing Tesla would want, especially\ngiven all the pomp and pageantry surrounding its launch last year, and the\nbillions of dollars of resources it has poured into its development.\n\nIf this problem results in a recall, it could spell even more issues for Tesla\nas it already deals with a rough sales year.\n\nContact the author: rob.stumpf@insideevs.com\n\nAdditional reporting from Suvrat Kothari\n\nMore Cybertruck News\n\nCouple Loves Tesla's Cybertruck, But Not The Basecamp Tent\n\nTesla Cybertruck Fast Charging Improvements Coming This Quarter\n\nTesla Model X Beats Cybertruck In Towing Range Test\n\nSomeone Paid $262,500 For This Tesla Cybertruck At Auction\n\n++\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Share on Flipboard\n  * Share on Reddit\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n  * Send to email\n\nComment!\n\nGot a tip for us?
