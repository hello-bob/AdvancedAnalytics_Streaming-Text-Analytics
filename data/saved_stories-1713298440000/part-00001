Chemists have found a surprising answer: it doesn't.\n\nAfter you've grasped an iron railing, a door handle or a piece of steel\ncutlery, your hand often gives off what seems to be a metallic odour. But\nDietmar Glindemann of the University of Leipzig, Germany, and his co-workers\nsay that you're not smelling the metal at all.\n\nThey have found that the musty odour comes from chemical compounds in your\nskin, which are transformed in an instant by the touch of iron. They report\nthe results in the international edition of Angewandte Chemie^1.\n\nCopper has a similar effect, accounting for the metallic smell created by\nhandling coins made of copper alloys. \"When a shopkeeper hands you a coin,\"\nsays Glindemann, \"you're smelling his body odour.\"\n\nThe smelly reactions induced by these metals create \"the sensory illusion that\nit is the 'metal in itself' that we smell right after touching it\", the\nresearchers say. In other words, a 'metallic' smell is only deemed to be so by\nassociation.\n\n## Sweaty palms\n\n> \u201cWhen a shopkeeper hands you a coin, you're smelling his body odour.\u201d\n\nDietmar Glindemann, University of Leipzig\n\nGlindemann began studying this question years ago when he became curious about\nthe garlic-tinged metallic aroma of iron after it has been touched by a sweaty\npalm. He found that acids naturally present in sweat induce reactions between\ncarbon and phosphorus impurities typically present in iron, generating smelly,\nvolatile molecules called organophosphines.\n\nBut the 'metallic' smell left on your hands after you handle iron or copper\nwas different from the scent of metals touched by acid in the lab. \"This\nproblem tortured me for five or six years,\" Glindemann says.\n\nThe breakthrough came when he teamed up with environmental chemist Andrea\nDietrich at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg.\nShe was trying to understand why people often complain of a metallic taste in\ndrinking water.\n\nExploring the issue of metallic taste led her to think about metallic smell.\nThat took her to Glindemann, and they cracked the problem together.\n\nThe researchers captured the vapours emitted from the skin of people who had\nhandled iron objects, and studied their chemical composition. The gases\ncontained several compounds called aldehydes and ketones, which often have\nstrong and distinctive smells. The odour of preserving fluid, or formaldehyde,\nmakes for the characteristic reek of old anatomy labs, for example, while the\nketone acetone makes the distinctive solvent whiff of nail-varnish remover.\n\nThese compounds are produced by rapid reactions between iron or copper and\noils on our skin.\n\n## Is that mushrooms?\n\nOne such compound in particular, called 1-octen-3-one, which is found in the\nvapours above skin touched by iron, is particularly smelly. Humans can detect\nit at very low concentrations, and experience it as a mushroom-like, metallic\nodour.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe researchers think that every person generates a subtly different blend of\nodorant molecules when they touch metal, and that this blend may change if the\nindividual has a disease such as cancer. So analysing the chemicals in 'iron\nsmell', for example, might provide a kind of medical diagnostic tool. \"We're\nnow working to see if the smell caused by iron on skin provides a fingerprint\nof disease,\" says Glindemann.\n\nThe reactions could also explain Dietrich's question of why drinking water\nsometimes tastes metallic: organic food particles could be reacting with rust\nin the water to help form the odour compounds.\n\nVisit our metallicsmellisjust_body.html\">newsblog to read and post comments\nabout this story.\n\nUniversity of Leipzig\n\n  * ## References\n\n    1.
