said subscribers jumped 16% from the year-earlier period, but added it would no longer report paid memberships starting next year.\n  * Netflix has focused more on growing profit rather than boosting subscribers.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * NFLX-27.94 (-4.58%)\n\nA couple sits in front of a television with the Netflix logo on it.\n\nPicture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Netflix will no longer provide quarterly membership numbers or\naverage revenue per user starting next year, the company said Thursday as it\nreported earnings that beat on the top and bottom lines.\n\nTotal memberships rose 16% in the first quarter, reaching 269.6 million, well\nabove the 264.2 million Wall Street had expected. However, the quarter marks\none of the last glimpses investors will get of the company\u2019s subscriber base\ngoing forward.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve noted in previous letters, we\u2019re focused on revenue and operating\nmargin as our primary financial metrics \u2014 and engagement (i.e. time spent) as\nour best proxy for customer satisfaction,\u201d the company said in its quarterly\nletter to shareholders. \u201cIn our early days, when we had little revenue or\nprofit, membership growth was a strong indicator of our future potential.\u201d\n\nNetflix said now that it is generating substantial profit and free cash flow \u2014\nas well as developing new revenue streams like advertising and a password-\nsharing crackdown \u2014 its membership numbers are not the only factor in the\ncompany\u2019s growth. It said the metric lost significance after it started to\noffer multiple price points for memberships.\n\nThe company said it would still announce \u201cmajor subscriber milestones as we\ncross them.\u201d\n\nNetflix also noted that it expects paid net additions to be lower in the\nsecond quarter compared to the first quarter \u201cdue to typical seasonality.\u201d Its\nsecond-quarter revenue forecast of $9.49 billion was just shy of Wall Street\u2019s\nestimate of $9.54 billion\n\nShares of the company fell around 4% in extended trading.\n\nHere are Netflix\u2019s first-quarter results:\n\n  * Earnings per share: $5.28 vs. $4.52 expected by LSEG\n  * Revenue: $9.37 billion vs. $9.28 billion expected by LSEG\n  * Total memberships: 269.6 million vs. 264.2 million expected, according to Street Account\n\nNetflix reported first-quarter net income of $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per\nshare, versus $1.30 billion, or $2.88 per share, in the prior-year period.\n\nThe company posted revenue of $9.37 billion for the quarter, up from $8.16\nbillion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe streaming company is navigating its transformation from targeting\nsubscriber growth to focusing on profit, as it uses price hikes, a crackdown\non password sharing and an ad-supported tier to boost revenue. Investors are\nlooking for signs that these efforts are still boosting Netflix and seeking\nmore details about the company\u2019s foray into video games.\n\nNetflix could also provide more insight into its partnership with TKO Group\nHoldings to bring WWE to the platform. The company has teased that it would\nlike to expand its live sports offerings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the very early days of developing our live programming and I would\nlook at this as an expansion of the types of content we offer, the way we\nexpanded to film and unscripted and animation and most recently games,\u201d said\nco-CEO Ted Sarandos during Thursday\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWe believe that these\nkind of event cultural moments like the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight are\njust that kind of television, and we want to be part of winning over those\nmoments with our members as well, so that for me is the excitement part of\nthis.\u201d\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the company\u2019s stock was up 27% year to date and around\n85% over the last 12 months.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Thursday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Tesla, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, eBay, Zoom, JetBlue, BJ\u2019s & more\n  * If you\u2019re worried about a correction and over-invested in Nvidia, replace it with these steady growth stocks instead\n  * It may be time for investors to sell Nvidia on the next bounce, according to the charts\n  * Wall Street is bullish on copper, thanks to AI. Analysts love these stocks, giving one 234% upside\n  * \u2018Hard to Ignore\u2019: Jefferies says this cybersecurity stock could double after 75% rise in the past year\n  * A four-day work week could be coming as AI proliferates \u2014 and these companies could capitalize\n\nTV\n\nMad MoneyWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Last Call 07:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
