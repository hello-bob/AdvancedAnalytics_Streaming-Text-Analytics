We draw on our collective experience to tackle\ntopics that we don't feel are addressed elsewhere. Our hope is that these\nlittle 'value adds' will help you just as much as they have helped us.\n\nThis guide is made available under the permissive Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA\n4.0 license\n\n## Intro\n\nSoftware engineering is something we\u2019d all consider to be a technical\nprofession (whatever that might mean), and we\u2019d like to believe that those who\nare the most technically proficient are the most prominent. However, this\nisn\u2019t always the case. You\u2019ll often find that the people who are the most\nknowledgeable, or have the deepest insights, are the quietest. Unfortunately,\nthose that possess the sharpest communication skills, the gift of the gab as\nit is known colloquially, often have the greatest influence.\n\nIn reality, for many of us in this industry, our focus isn\u2019t all about having\na successful career, climbing the promotions ladder, or sharing our deep\ninsights. It is simply that having your voice heard, and feeling like your\nopinions are valued, is vital to an enjoyable working experience.\n\nThere\u2019s a wealth of materials that help build your technical skills, through\ncourses and certifications, but relatively little that truly helps nurture\ncommunication skills. As a result, this is something that people tend to\noverlook, and those that lack confidence remain quiet. And when this happens,\nwe all lose. Valuable ideas are not surfaced and the individual simply feels a\nlittle less valued.\n\nThis guide isn\u2019t going to fix all of this, but it aims to help empower the\nquieter or less confident among us to speak with real confidence.\n\nIf you\u2019re nervous about communicating your ideas, either in a formal\npresentation setting, or more informally, in meetings and small group\nconversations, this brief guide is for you. It\u2019s a simple collection of\nthoughts and ideas; practical steps that you can take to build confidence, or\nfeel more secure. You don\u2019t need to try them all at once, building\ncommunication skills and confidence in yourself takes time. It\u2019s better to\nintroduce them little-by-little.\n\nAnyhow, enough of the introduction, let\u2019s move onto something more practical.\n\n## Practice, practice and practice some more!\n\nThe heading for this section might seem somewhat obvious. We all know deep\ndown that getting better at something requires practice, and this is certainly\ntrue for communication skills. However, how many of us intentionally practise\ndifferent ways of communicating?\n\nPractice requires repetition, but don\u2019t mistake repetition for effective\npractice.\n\nOne of the keys to effective practice is constructive feedback, if you\u2019re\nincredibly self-aware you may be able to determine areas of improvement\nyourself. But most of us are simply self-critical (finding faults that may not\nexist) rather than self-aware (a more genuine consciousness of your own\nabilities), which isn\u2019t always constructive. You need this feedback to\nunderstand the areas where you are already good at communicating and also\nwhere you can make improvements or try different styles.\n\nSo how do you go about getting some constructive feedback? This isn\u2019t always\neasy, and I\u2019d recommend starting with people you already trust.\n\n### Build a network\n\nIt\u2019s always better to practice in the company of others. If you want to\npractice more formal presentation skills, why not see if you can find one or\ntwo friends or colleagues who are on the same journey? You can try out your\npresentation skills in a small group, with people who will be kind and who\nwant to see you succeed. This helps build trust and empathy.\n\n### Be specific\n\nThe great thing about relying on people you trust is that they genuinely care\nabout you and your feelings, and as a result, you\u2019ll likely receive positive\nfeedback and encouragement. While this is great for your confidence, it isn\u2019t\nalways the feedback you need to improve.\n\nTo help tease out the really helpful feedback you can ask your reviewers to be\nmore specific about an area of focus.\n\n  * Can you please provide feedback on my rate of delivery, am I too fast? Too slow?\n  * Did I waffle a little in that meeting? Did I make my point clearly?\n  * Do my slides support the talk? Or are they a distraction?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, positive feedback (you were awesome!) is great, but you\nneed a balance.\n\n### Group practice\n\nOne of the most effective things you can do is practice as a group, perhaps\nform a \u201cspeaking\u201d club, or a more modestly titled \u201ccommunication skills\u201d\ngroup. This can give you a safe space to try things out.\n\nIf you form a group, set some ground rules. If someone gives a presentation to\nthe group, it is the responsibility of everyone to provide some constructive\nfeedback. This in itself is a good exercise in communication skills.\nDelivering feedback, that some might consider negative, is a challenge in\nitself. And once again, worth practicing.\n\nAnother useful group exercise is to watch presentations from conferences, or\nperhaps the odd TED talk. Watch as a group then discuss the presentation,\nfocussing on the delivery, rather than the content. What techniques did they\nuse that you might want to try yourself? How did they introduce themselves?\nHow did they introduce the topic? Where did they stand on the stage? Who were\nthey talking to, the whole audience or one or two key people? What made them\nappear confident? Did they falter in any way? And if so, how did they recover?\n\nTry to identify the techniques that you thought made the delivery of the\npresentation really good and also not so good. Once you have spotted these you\ncan then try to emulate them yourself, or deliberately avoid the negative\npoints.\n\n### Create opportunities\n\nYou\u2019ll probably need to put a bit of work into creating opportunities to\npractice. If you\u2019re working as part of a team, are there instances where you\ncould take the lead, perhaps as a sprint demo? Or maybe it is worth suggesting\n\u2018lunch and learn\u2019 sessions, where you share a bit more about what you are\nworking on with the team. Maybe your company already has some internal forums\nwhere people present on technical topics?\n\n### Generating ideas\n\nIn all honesty, this is probably the hardest part. So far this section has\ndescribed various ways to practice and elicit feedback, but practice what\nexactly?\n\nIt\u2019s very frequent to hear people say \u201cI couldn\u2019t present on that topic, I\u2019m\nnot an expert\u201d. I\u2019ll let you into a little secret, there are very few genuine\nexperts in the world, and if they were the only ones who are \u2018allowed\u2019 to\nspeak, the world would be a very quiet place!\n\nIt\u2019s easy to think that everyone knows the same things that you do, or perhaps\nmore, but this simply isn\u2019t the case. Furthermore, there are so many ways to\npresent a topic or concept, that sometimes you\u2019ll be surprised by a\npresentation on a familiar topic, where the way it was delivered causes you to\nthink differently. It\u2019s happened to me on numerous occasions, and I always try\nto be an open-minded audience member.\n\nOne top tip to remember is that when people come to your presentation they are\ndoing so because they want to know about your topic. They want you to be\nsuccessful in presenting it because they want to hear about the subject. How\nmany people go to a talk to deliberately watch the presenter fail? Your\naudience is actually your biggest supporter, so you don\u2019t need to feel scared\nof them.\n\nThis still doesn\u2019t quite answer the question of what you should talk about?\nQuite simply I believe you should aim to talk about things that you enjoy and\nthat excite you personally. Developing a talk, and building your own\nconfidence, is hard work - you\u2019re going to have to enjoy the topic to make it\nworthwhile.\n\nIt might be worth keeping a notebook, often you\u2019ll find ideas come to mind\nwhen you\u2019re at your most busy, and don\u2019t have time to act upon them. If you\ndon\u2019t write them down, you\u2019ll likely find you\u2019ve forgotten all about them when\nyou do get a bit of time to spare.\n\nFinally, there is no harm in asking a friend of a colleague, \u201cwould you be\ninterested in a talk on ....?\u201d\n\n## Constructing a presentation\n\nDelivering a talk on a technical topic, whether it is something about\nprogramming, or perhaps a delivery methodology, can feel quite intimidating.\nYou might want to consider presenting on a non-technical topic first,\nespecially if you\u2019ve managed to assemble a group who are all looking to\npractice their presentation skills.\n\nThis section isn\u2019t a recipe or a process you can follow to develop your\npresentation. I really think people approach this in very different ways.\nHowever, regardless of whether a presentation is on a technical topic or not,\nthere are some basic tips that apply, which I\u2019ll share here\n\n### Beginning, middle, end\n\nI always think it helps to consider presentations as a form of storytelling,\nand some of the same basic rules apply. The beginning introduces the topic, or\nproblem, and likely yourself also. The middle is where you dive into the\ncontent itself, and the end will typically refer back to the beginning. For\nmost presentations the beginning and the end are relatively brief, but it is\nstill worth thinking about your presentation as having some sort of narrative\nor story.\n\n### Bring yourself to the presentation\n\nYou may be wondering how a technical topic can have a narrative or be\nconsidered storytelling? That\u2019s a good question - technical topics are by\ntheir very nature quite dry. They lack feelings and emotion!\n\nThis is why \u201cbringing yourself\u201d to a presentation can help add a bit more\nnarrative. There are a great many ways this can be done:\n\n  * If you picked a topic, unit testing for example, why? What is it that interests or excites you about this topic? Why not include that in your talk?\n  * How did you learn about this topic yourself? When? For what reason?\n  * Can you relate this topic to some of your own experiences, good or bad? Specifics and stories bring a topic to life.\n  * How has this topic impacted you and how do you think it could impact others?\n\nSomething you\u2019ll probably be surprised to learn is that people like learning\nabout people. You may think your audience is only here for the technical\nnuggets, but more often than not, they\u2019re just as interested in you and your\nexperiences.\n\nFinally, personal stories are simply more memorable to the audience.\n\n### Include signposts\n\nThis is an extension of the \u201cbeginning, middle, end\u201d structure, for someone to\nfollow your talk and the narrative it is important that they don\u2019t get lost.\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been in a presentation where you\u2019ve lost the thread, or are\nunsure why they are telling you something? Here are some examples you can use:\n\n  * Tell the audience why you are going to tell them something, ahead of telling them the thing - ok, that\u2019s a bit of a mouthful. It\u2019s easy for someone to get lost if they are not quite sure why you are telling them something. If it\u2019s not entirely clear or obvious, simply tell them! ... \u201cThis is a bit of background that I think is important to your understanding\u201d\n  * Segues - no, not the self-balancing two-wheeled devices that were supposed to revolutionise travel. A segue in a talk is a clear transition from one topic to another.\n  * Visible signposts - sometimes it can help to add visible signposts on your slides, similar to the breadcrumb trails you find on websites.\n  * Be clear about why a story matters - your talk will likely include examples, stories, or background information that you have included for a specific reason. However, sometimes this reason isn\u2019t obvious to the audience, and it is worth spelling out, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a little story because it illustrates my point ...\u201d\n\nThe above might sound patronising, but they really do help people follow your\npresentation. Once someone gets a little lost it is very hard for them to pick\nup the thread once again. You can\u2019t rewind a presentation in real life.\n\n### Presenting with friends\n\nPresenting as a \u2018double act\u2019 likely feels like a good way to get started,\nhaving someone next to you can really help reduce your stress levels, and it\nis worth giving it a try.\n\nHowever, presenting as a pair can also be a bit more challenging in other\nways. If you\u2019re \u2018passing the mic\u2019 multiple times in a presentation, this will\nrequire more practice than if you\u2019re doing it yourself. I\u2019ve seen a few\ndouble-act presentations where there is confusion about how and when to hand\noff.\n\nDon\u2019t be put off giving this a try, but do remember to practice the\ntransitions, and if possible minimise them by structuring your presentation\naccordingly.\n\n### Scripts, use with caution\n\nThis topic comes up quite often with people learning to present, there is a\ntemptation to script the entire talk so that you don\u2019t stumble or need to\n\u2018improvise\u2019. However, reading from a script is a skill in itself! You run the\nrisk of a \u2018wooden\u2019 delivery, one that lacks passion and genuine audience\nconnection.\n\nAgain, similar to \u2018presenting with friends\u2019 it\u2019s not something I\u2019d say you\nshould never do, but it is worth practicing in smaller groups to see how well\nyou can read under pressure.\n\nRather than writing a script, I\u2019d recommend using a bullet point style for\ndeveloping your talk. At first these might be quite detailed, where each\nbullet point is a whole sentence, in a way that is not dissimilar to a full\nscript. As you practice, try to compress the amount of material in your bullet\npoints. You might want to make a few words, or key points bold so that they\nstand out when you\u2019re reading your notes. Over time, drop the rest of the text\nso that the key points remain.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with having speaker notes, but as you\npractise, you\u2019ll find yourself using them less and less often. I\u2019d advise\nagainst removing them completely, sometimes just knowing they are there just\ngives you a bit more confidence. However, by having a few key points in bullet\npoints, you\u2019ll find it much easier to pick up the narrative once again if you\nget lost.\n\n### Connecting with the audience\n\nOne of the main issues with a script is that your eyes will likely be glued to\nyour notes rather than looking out into the audience. You\u2019ve probably noticed\nthat the most experienced and confident speakers hold eye contact with their\naudience. This helps create a genuine emotional connection and also holds\ntheir attention. Again, this is something that only comes with practice and\nconfidence.\n\nAt first, look for the people in the audience who are most engaged, perhaps\nyour friends? A bit of eye contact and a reassuring smile, or nod of the head,\ngoes a long way to help lift your tone.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good trick to find 3 or 4 people in your audience who you direct\nthe presentation at. You can move from person to person making eye contact\nwith them. Audience members will never be sure if you are talking to them or\nthe person to their left or right. When you look at one person directly most\nof the people in that general area will feel like you are presenting\nspecifically to them. If you select people who are scattered across the\naudience and talk directly to them, the result will be that most of your\naudience comes away feeling like you were looking at them\n\nYou might also want to experiment with more direct audience interactions as a\nway to build a connection. At first I\u2019d recommend against open-ended\nquestions, \u201cwhat do you think of this ...?\u201d, this might result in unexpected\nfeedback or things you're not prepared for. A safer option might be \u201dhands up\nwho has experienced this problem before\u201d, but do bear in mind that there will\nlikely be some reluctance, people don\u2019t like being singled out or becoming the\ncentre of attention. This is why people often scan the room first before\nraising a hand! Other prompts you might try are \u201cshout out if you know the\nanswer to this ...\u201d, again, this is a more directed question which is less\nlikely to derail you.\n\n### Avoid reading your own slides\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about remembering what to say, or leaving out some important\ndetail, it can be tempting to pack a lot of content, or bullet points, into\nyour slide. Unfortunately this has a few negative side-effects:\n\n  * If you pack your slide full of text, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll start reading it out verbatim, resulting in the \u2018script\u2019 issue discussed earlier\n  * Another risk with a slide packed with text is that people will start reading the slide and will naturally stop focusing on you, the presenter.\n  * Worse still, they\u2019ll be able to read faster than you talk, meaning they\u2019ll get to the end of the slide then have to mentally back-track when their focus returns to you.\n  * And worse again, they might not be able to read the slide at all because the font size is so small to accommodate all the words\n\nTo stop people reading ahead and losing focus on the presenter, some people\nfavour presentation slides that reveal one bullet point at a time, which isn\u2019t\na bad solution. However, it is better to minimise the content of your slides\nso that there is simply very little text and little to distract the audience\nfrom you!\n\nA trick you could use is to replace your bullet points with questions that you\nanswer. For example, if you want to describe the role you have in a team,\nrather than have a slide with three bullet points describing the role, replace\nthem with a question \u201chow would I describe my role in the team?\u201d\n\nAs an aside, don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t say exactly the same thing each time.\nHowever, if there are key points you want to get across, this is information\nto place in your slide notes. On that subject, whether you use PowerPoint,\nKeynote or Google Slides, they all have a presenter mode with notes that only\nyou can see. This is something you should familiarise yourself with ... and\npractice. You need to practice with the tech as well as your delivery. There\nis nothing more embarrassing than not being able to work your own slide deck.\n\n### Ending your presentation\n\nThe end of a presentation is something most people overlook. Here are some\nantipatterns that happen all too often:\n\n  * The \u201cI think I\u2019ve finished\u201d ending - \u201cand that\u2019s me just about done\u201d\n  * The \u201cI want to get off the stage fast\u201d ending - \u201cthank you, goodbye\u201d accompanied by a quick dash off the stage\n  * The \u201cI didn\u2019t think of an ending\u201d ending - \u201cwell, that\u2019s about it for me\u201d\n  * The \u201cI\u2019m out of time now\u201d ending\n  * The apologetic \u201cI hope you enjoyed that\u201d ending\n\nI could go on ...\n\nProbably the worst ending of all is \u201cany questions?\u201d, it seems like a very\nsensible thing to ask the audience, but there\u2019s a big problem with ending this\nway. At the end of your talk people will likely want to show their\nappreciation, hopefully with a polite round of applause. If you immediately\nend with \u201cany questions?\u201d you immediately confuse the audience. Watch what\nhappens next time a presentation ends with that line - you\u2019ll no doubt see a\nbunch of people who have just lifted their arms, ready for applause, but all\nof a sudden are unsure if that is rude, so nervously put them back down again.\nNo-one wants to clap at the wrong time.\n\nAlways, always leave a pause before asking whether there are any questions\nfrom the audience. Give them the opportunity to show their appreciation.\n\nSo what is a good ending? Remember the points about storytelling above. Your\nending should likely refer back to the beginning of your talk. What was the\noverall purpose of your talk? Reiterate what the audience has been told and\nhopefully learnt.\n\nThis still leaves the tricky job of the very last sentence. I\u2019d recommend\nplanning this in advance, without planning there is every likelihood that\nyou\u2019ll trail off at the end. Personally I favour \u2018active\u2019 endings, or a simple\ncall to action. Here are a few ideas:\n\n  * \u201cI hope this has inspired you to give ChatGPT a try, you might be surprised by the result\u201d\n  * \u201cNext time you write a test, why not give BDD a try\u201d\n  * \u201cI hope I\u2019ve given you something to think about, and next time someone suggests using blockchain, you have some concrete questions and polite challenges\u201d\n  * \u201cOpen source is a community endeavour, why not roll-up your sleeves and give it a try?\u201d\n\n### Handling questions\n\nYou\u2019ve delivered your final line, given the audience the chance to applaud\n(which I\u2019m sure they did), what about questions? For starters, there are no\nrules that say you have to take questions - often I feel they are a little\nsuperfluous, and take away from the ending you crafted. One simple option is\nto say \u201cif you\u2019d like to discuss further, come and find me for a chat, I\u2019d\nlove to talk some more ...\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to ask questions, be prepared for a few situations:\n\n  * You may get asked questions you don\u2019t know the answer to. That\u2019s fine, and not something you should hide. A polite response could be \u201cI\u2019d not thought of that, perhaps we could discuss later\u201d.\n  * Some questions are not questions, some people simply want to share their own thoughts, which is fine. Simply thank them for sharing.\n  * Sometimes you will not get any questions, which can be quite embarrassing if you\u2019re not ready for this. I\u2019d have a line ready \u201cI\u2019ve clearly left you with a lot to think about, once it has sunk in, do catch me later for a chat\u201d\n\nAlthough, repeating the above, you don\u2019t have to take questions, and if you\u2019re\nnew to presenting, I\u2019d recommend avoiding putting yourself on the spot like\nthat. At least not the first time around.\n\n## Delivering Technical Talks\n\nThis guide is supposed to be covering technical presentations, but so far I\nhave focussed on generic communication and presentation guidance. So let\u2019s\nshift our focus to the technical part.\n\nFor many people presenting on a \u2018technical\u2019 topic can be particularly\nstressful. Not only do you have the worry of the presentation itself, there\u2019s\nthe additional worry that you might say something wrong. This is why I\u2019d\nrecommend starting off with \u2018non technical\u2019 presentations, where there isn\u2019t\nsuch a clear-cut line between right or wrong.\n\nHowever, at some point you\u2019ll have to take the plunge, and try presenting\nsomething technical.\n\n### Don\u2019t assume your audience are experts\n\nIn fact, assume the opposite.\n\nRegardless of the setting, you\u2019ll likely be presenting to a group with quite\nmixed abilities. Don\u2019t try to immediately impress the experts in the room,\ninstead try to create a presentation that takes everyone on a journey. Try to\nmake sure that everyone stays engaged and follows along. I\u2019d much rather re-\niterate the basics, even if the experts have heard it all before, than jump in\nat the deep end. The risk here is that some of your audience will be lost\nimmediately.\n\nAlso avoid acronyms. Not everybody in the audience will know what the letters\nstand for. Using an acronym can be the difference between a person following\nand enjoying your talk versus losing interest within the first few minutes.\n\n### And you don\u2019t need to be an expert either\n\nThis is a very common problem, \u201cI can\u2019t do a presentation on React, I\u2019m not an\nexpert\u201d. Very few people genuinely are experts, and you certainly don\u2019t have\nto be an expert to present on a topic.\n\nOne way to build confidence and avoid the \u201cI am not the expert\u201d voice in your\nhead is to present something as a personal opinion. Rather than presenting\nsomething as fact, present it as \u201cThis is what I learnt\u201d or \u201cThis is what I\nfound\u201d.\n\n### Technical talks can tell stories\n\nStories can be quite subtle, you don\u2019t have to have characters and a plot! A\nstory can be a simple journey of discovery. They help bring a more human\nelement to a talk, adding a little bit of emotion and connection.\n\nYou can use this as an opportunity to introduce a character if you like, it\ncan be you, or could be someone fictitious, for example \u201cI\u2019m going to tell the\nstory of a Python developer who tried to learn Rust\u201d. But if you do take this\nroute, it\u2019s probably something that you\u2019ll have to maintain for much of the\npresentation or it may seem superfluous.\n\n### Build empathy\n\nThis is one of the most powerful tools for any form of talk (or\ncommunication). Empathy is built around feelings. Technology itself lacks\nfeeling or emotion, so you need to be intentional about how you build empathy.\n\nThis can be really quite simple, share your thoughts and feelings, your likes\nand dislikes. Or you can share what you\u2019ve observed with others, e.g. \u201cI know\na lot of you struggle with ...\u201d\n\nIf you think your own background or circumstance is relevant, maybe the course\nyou studied, or a previous job you had, bring that to the talk. This is a\ngreat way of creating empathy. Consider talking about why this topic means\nsomething to you? Why did you pick it? Why is it a personal interest? What\nexcites you about it?\n\n### When showing code, keep it simple, and direct their focus\n\nThe time people take to absorb and learn, is much longer than you\u2019d expect.\nWhen introducing topics, especially those that are technical in nature, take\nit slowly.\n\nThe need to take it slowly is especially important if you have slides that\ninclude code, API documentation, or simply have quite a few words. When you\nshow code or text people will read it and try to understand it, which takes a\nsurprising amount of time. You can minimise this by keeping the code as simple\nas possible, and also by directing them to specifics, perhaps underlining a\nspecific piece of code when talking about it?\n\n### The perils of live coding\n\nIt\u2019s hard, seriously hard. Being able to talk, write code that works, all\nwhile telling a story, under pressure, with sweaty palms. Don\u2019t put yourself\nin that position without a backup plan.\n\nMy typing skills are quite average, but I\u2019ve learnt the hard way that under\npressure, my typing skills are atrocious! I have given a few talks that\ninvolve live coding, but it has almost always involved a little bit of \u2018off\nscreen\u2019 copy and paste magic. I also have a back-up plan with the code at\nvarious known states in case it all goes horribly wrong, which it does.\n\nSeriously though, this is very advanced stuff, and a skill that takes\npractice. Make sure you have prepared some filler lines to say whilst you are\ntrying to recover the tech. A few seconds of silence in a presentation can\nfeel like an eternity.\n\n### Avoid \u2018bigging yourself up\u2019\n\nAs you\u2019ll likely be reading this guide because you lack confidence right now,\nperhaps this isn\u2019t all that relevant, but something to consider for the\nfuture.\n\nOften, more experienced, more confident speakers will start with their CV,\ncareer history and their biggest achievements. This certainly validates their\nexpertise, but I\u2019m not sure it really builds empathy. You can qualify yourself\ndifferently, rather than what you have done, maybe talk about what has made\nyou proud? What has shaped you? It allows you to talk about your achievements\nin a different and more modest way.\n\nAlso, avoid words like \u2018obviously\u2019. What may be obvious to you could be a\ncomplete revelation to your audience members. Using words like \u2018obviously\u2019\ncarries the risk of making your audience feel inferior and go on to dislike\nyou.\n\n## Smile\n\nThe final piece of advice is simple. Smile.\n\nWhatever your presentation topic, try to put the nerves to one side, take a\ndeep breath, look out into the audience and smile. It\u2019s infectious. You\u2019ll\nalmost certainly be greeted by a sea of faces smiling back at you.\n\nSo now you have the guidance, why not try it out? Be brave, and start with\nsmall steps talking with or presenting to a safe audience. The longer you put\nthis off the more your fear of presenting will grow.\n\nGo on, pick a topic and go for it. Once you have conquered the art you will\ndiscover that what once seemed daunting is actually quite good fun.\n\nNotice something isn't right or needs improving?
