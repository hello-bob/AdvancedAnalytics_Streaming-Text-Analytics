The move could\nboost pay for other scientists as well, because academic institutions often\nfollow guidelines set by the NIH.\n\nBeginning immediately, postdocs who hold one of the agency\u2019s Ruth L.\nKirschstein National Research Service Awards (NRSAs) will earn at least\nUS$61,008 per year \u2014 an 8% increase and the largest year-over-year increase\nthe NIH has implemented since 2017. Postdocs\u2019 salaries, which are adjusted for\nyears of experience, are capped at $74,088 per year. Graduate students\u2019 yearly\nsalaries will rise by $1,000, amounting to an annual salary of $28,224. The\nagency will also provide an extra $500 in subsidies for childcare and $200 for\ntraining-related expenses.\n\n\u201cThis is a major step in the right direction and something that the majority\nwill agree is widely needed to retain talent in the biomedical and academic\nresearch sectors,\u201d says Francisca Acosta, a biomedical engineer and postdoc at\nthe University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, who is herself\nfunded through an NRSA.\n\n## Postdoc shortage\n\nIn 2022, the agency assembled a working group to advise it on how best to\nretain and cultivate postdoctoral talent, after reports that principal\ninvestigators were struggling to fill vacant postdoc positions. In December\nlast year, the panel recommended a minimum salary of $70,000 for postdocs.\n\nThe NIH agreed that a salary increase is indeed needed for the more than\n17,000 trainees covered by the NRSAs. But in its announcement, the agency\nacknowledged that the pay rise it has implemented falls short of the council\u2019s\nrecommendation. It cited its tight budget in recent years as a reason.\n\nCanadian science gets biggest boost to PhD and postdoc pay in 20 years\n\nIt added that \u201cpending the availability of funds through future\nappropriations\u201d, the agency would increase salaries to meet the recommended\n$70,000 target in the next three to five years.\n\nThe agency also suggested that NIH-funded institutions could supplement\nsalaries in other ways. That presents a challenge, according to Sharona\nGordon, a biophysicist at the University of Washington in Seattle, given that\nthe NIH\u2019s modular R01 grants \u2014 one of the main NIH research awards with which\nprincipal investigators fund their labs \u2014 have remained at $250,000 per year\nsince they were introduced in 1998. Such grants cannot be used to supplement\nsalaries, meaning that lab heads have to pull money from other sources to\nincrease trainees\u2019 pay.\n\nEven scientists who approve of the NIH\u2019s move say it could have unintended\nconsequences. \u201cFor institutions such as ours, which mandate that the postdoc\nminimum salary be set to the NIH minimum, there are some concerns that this\nincrease in personnel costs could be a barrier for labs based on funding\nlevels,\u201d Acosta says.\n\nFor some, the five-year timeline for the increase feels insufficient. Haroon\nPopal, a cognitive-science postdoc at the University of Maryland in College\nPark whose work is funded by the NIH, says that although he understands the\npressures on the agency, the new salary will not be enough to support him as\nhe assumes multiple caring responsibilities. Even with the boost, postdoc\nsalaries in academia fall far short of what researchers could make in\ngovernment, industry or non-profit positions.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue of diversity and equity for me,\u201d he says. \u201cThe new postdoc\nsalary is not allowing people like me to be in academia, which is counter to\nthe NIH\u2019s, institutions\u2019 and our scientific community\u2019s goals of increased\ndiversity.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01242-x\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Thousands of early-career NIH researchers forming union for first time\n\n  * US postdocs on strike: how will demands for higher wages be met?\n\n  * The postdoc experience is broken.
