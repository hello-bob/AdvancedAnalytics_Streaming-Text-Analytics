There\u2019s just one problem: Someone\nelse owns the trademark on her name.\n\nVideo: Getty Images; \u00c1ngel Guerra\n\nIn the fall of 2020, bored and restless in Covid-restricted Spain, \u00c1ngel\nGuerra doodled a dream car. The automotive designer, then 38, wanted to make a\ntribute to his first four-wheeled love: the time-traveling DeLorean DMC-12\nthat rolled out of a cloud of steam in Back to the Future. The sketch that\ntook shape on Guerra\u2019s computer had all the iconic elements of the 1980s\noriginal\u2014gull-wing doors, stainless-steel cladding, louver blades over the\nrear window, a rakish black side stripe\u2014plus a few modern touches. Guerra\nsmoothed out the folded-paper angles, widened the body, stretched the wheel\narches to accommodate bigger rims and tires. After two weeks, he decided he\nliked this new DeLorean enough to stick it on Instagram.\n\nThe post blew up. Gearheads raved about the design. The music producer Swizz\nBeatz DM\u2019d Guerra to ask how much it would cost to build. Guerra started to\nthink that maybe his sketch should become a real car. He reached out to a\nTexas firm called DeLorean Motor Company, which years earlier had acquired the\noriginal DeLorean trademarks, but was gently rebuffed. The design seemed\ndestined to live in cyberspace forever. Then, by some algorithmic magic, a\ndifferent kind of DeLorean showed up on Guerra\u2019s Instagram feed in the spring\nof 2022\u2014a human DeLorean by the name of Kat. Her posts showcased her love for\nher puppy, hair dye, and above all her late father, John Z. DeLorean. Although\nthe general public often remembers him as a high-flying CEO with fabulous hair\nand a surgically augmented chin who went down in a federal sting operation,\nGuerra chiefly thought of him as a brilliant engineer. He sent Kat a message\nwith some kind words about her dad and a link to the design. Kat saw it and\ngot stoked.\n\nKat DeLorean at a DeLorean event in Augusta, Georgia, on March 11,\n2023.Photograph: Peyton Fulford\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nNoncompetes Are Dead\u2014and Tech Workers Are Free to Roam\n\nAmanda Hoover\n\n  * Security\n\nCyberspies Hacked Cisco Firewalls to Access Government Networks\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Gear\n\nWe Tested the BYD Seal\u2014the Car That Explains Why Tesla Just Cut Its Prices\n\nMark Andrews\n\n  * Security\n\nChange Healthcare Finally Admits It Paid Ransomware Hackers\u2014and Still Faces a\nPatient Data Leak\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nKat DeLorean is a frequently stoked type of person. At the time, she had\nrecently dyed her long hair in rainbow colors to, in her words, \u201ccreate the\nrainbows in my heart on my head.\u201d Yet for much of her life, her relationship\nto the DeLorean name had been an unhappy one. When people asked why she didn\u2019t\nown a DMC-12, she would reply: \u201cIf there was an iconic representation of your\nentire life falling apart, would you park it in your driveway?\u201d She would say,\nonly half-jokingly, that the initials stood for \u201cDestroy My Childhood.\u201d A\nfortysomething cybersecurity professional, Kat lived in a ramshackle farmhouse\nin New Hampshire with her husband and a few kids. But when Guerra\u2019s note\narrived, she was undergoing a pandemic- and work-stress-induced reevaluation\nof her life\u2019s purpose. She was dreaming up ways to reclaim her father\u2019s\nlegacy. She wanted to launch an engineering education program in his name.\n\nOne thing she insisted she didn\u2019t want was to start a car company. It was a\ncar company, after all, that had ruined her father. But then something\nhappened that changed her mind. In April 2022, the Texas company that had\ngiven Guerra the cold shoulder announced it would soon reveal a new DeLorean.\nKat kept her feelings about this to herself only briefly. First she drew\nattention to Guerra\u2019s design, posting it on Instagram. (\u201cA timeless classic\ngiven the treatment it deserves!\u201d) Two days later, she made her feelings\nexplicit: \u201c@deloreanmotorcompany Is not John DeLorean\u2019s Company,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cHe despised you.\u201d Details about the new Texas DeLorean emerged a few days\nafter that: Called the Alpha5, it would have four seats instead of two, would\nreportedly be built mostly from aluminum rather than stainless steel, and\nwould be available in red. Like many DeLorean purists, Kat hated it.\n\nThe Texas-based DeLorean Motor Company\u2019s Alpha5.Photograph: DeLorean Motor\nCompany\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nNoncompetes Are Dead\u2014and Tech Workers Are Free to Roam\n\nAmanda Hoover\n\n  * Security\n\nCyberspies Hacked Cisco Firewalls to Access Government Networks\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Gear\n\nWe Tested the BYD Seal\u2014the Car That Explains Why Tesla Just Cut Its Prices\n\nMark Andrews\n\n  * Security\n\nChange Healthcare Finally Admits It Paid Ransomware Hackers\u2014and Still Faces a\nPatient Data Leak\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nAs people kept messaging her about the pretty design they\u2019d seen on her\nInstagram feed\u2014some even offered to help build it\u2014a new plan took shape. Kind\nof a crazy one. She started to think: Why not build one car and film the\nprocess of building it for the engineering students? Eventually that turned\ninto: Why not make several and sell them to fund the engineering program? But\nthen why not ...\n\nAs Kat\u2019s ideas tend to do, this one snowballed: an engineering program in\nevery state, funded by cars; her mind could easily leap from there to notions\nof rebuilding the industrial Midwest and rejiggering American work culture in\ngeneral, the ultimate realization of her oft-stated belief that \u201ceveryone\nshould have the same opportunity to live their dream.\u201d John DeLorean had\nplotted to return to the car market until the day he died. Now, she thought,\nshouldn\u2019t she give the nerds what they wanted? Fine, she had zero experience\nrunning a car company, but she could find people for that, and anyway she\u2019d\nspent, by her estimate, thousands of hours talking engine design with her dad.\nShe described herself as having \u201cgasoline in her veins.\u201d\n\nWhich didn\u2019t really change the fundamentals, including how difficult and\noutrageously expensive it is to bring a car to market, not to mention the\nitchy point that the \u201cDeLorean\u201d branding technically belonged to someone else.\nNever mind all that. Kat was a DeLorean\u2014a name, for good or ill, associated\nwith wild ambition.\n\nJohn Z. DeLorean at the wheel of a DMC-12.Photograph: Getty Images\n\nJohn Z. DeLorean was a suave, swashbuckling General Motors executive who dated\nyoung models and palled around with celebrities. He became automotive royalty\nin the mid-1960s, when he had the idea of sticking a bigger engine into an\n\u201cold lady\u201d car, thereby reinventing the Pontiac brand and launching the\n\u201cmuscle car\u201d era. But DeLorean felt stifled at GM, and he dreamed of building\nwhat he called an \u201cethical car\u201d: safe, reliable, affordable, and\nenvironmentally friendly. He left the company in 1973, the same year he\nmarried the supermodel Cristina Ferrare, his third wife. Two years later, he\nfounded the DeLorean Motor Company. And two years after that, DeLorean and\nFerrare, who shared an adopted 6-year-old son named Zach, welcomed their baby\ndaughter Kathryn.\n\nThe original DeLorean Motor Company\u2019s brief and turbulent history spanned\nKathryn\u2019s early childhood. She has few direct memories of the time her dad\nspent assembling a team of mavericks and dreamers enticed by the idea of\nbuilding a whole car company from a blank sheet of paper. With a generous\ninvestment from the British government, DeLorean opted to put his factory\noutside Belfast, Northern Ireland. This was during the Troubles, when the idea\nof Catholics and Protestants working side-by-side seemed impossible. But, for\na time, it worked. \u201cThere was a bog, then there was a factory, then there were\njobs,\u201d William Haddad, an executive for the company, recalled in a 1985\ninterview. \u201cIt was really exciting as hell.\u201d\n\nIt also happened to be an era of inflation and soaring gas prices. An\ninexperienced workforce and frequent bomb scares further complicated\nproduction. Timelines slipped, production costs ballooned, demand collapsed,\ndebt accrued. The company had to recall a couple thousand cars. DeLorean\u2019s\noriginal vision, described by one classic car aficionado as a $12,000\n\u201cCorvette killer\u201d featuring \u201cunprecedented safety and efficiency attributes,\u201d\nmorphed into a $25,000 vehicle with few of those qualities. Then, in October\n1982, with little Kathryn approaching her fifth birthday, came the world-\nfamous denouement: John DeLorean caught on tape with an FBI informant in a\nroom with nearly 60 pounds of cocaine. The informant had pitched the sale of\nthe drugs as a way to raise enough money to save DeLorean\u2019s struggling\ncompany.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nNoncompetes Are Dead\u2014and Tech Workers Are Free to Roam\n\nAmanda Hoover\n\n  * Security\n\nCyberspies Hacked Cisco Firewalls to Access Government Networks\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Gear\n\nWe Tested the BYD Seal\u2014the Car That Explains Why Tesla Just Cut Its Prices\n\nMark Andrews\n\n  * Security\n\nChange Healthcare Finally Admits It Paid Ransomware Hackers\u2014and Still Faces a\nPatient Data Leak\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nKat was 6 when her dad\u2019s high-profile trial ended in an acquittal in the late\nsummer of 1984, on the grounds of entrapment. Her dad\u2019s company and career\nwere destroyed, as he ruefully asked reporters outside the courtroom: \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, would you buy a used car from me?\u201d Also destroyed was a kind of\nchildhood idyll for Kat, who went very suddenly from living in an intact,\nwealthy, and famous New York City family\u2014complete with an apartment on Fifth\nAvenue worth $30 million in today\u2019s dollars\u2014to being a child of bicoastal\ndivorce. Within the year, her mother was remarried to a television executive,\nand Kat was mostly living in California. She was allowed 10 minutes a day on\nthe phone with her dad back East, which she extended by enlisting his help\nwith math homework.\n\nBack to the Future came out a year after John\u2019s acquittal. Although a studio\nofficial had pushed the filmmakers to use a Mustang for their time\nmachine\u2014Ford was willing to pay handsomely for the product placement\u2014the\nscreenwriter reportedly replied, \u201cDoc Brown doesn\u2019t drive a fucking Mustang.\u201d\nThe selection of the DMC-12 for the honor (cue Marty McFly: \u201cAre you telling\nme that you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?\u201d) prompted John to write a\nthank-you letter to the director and screenwriter, who he said had \u201call but\nimmortalized\u201d his car. Unlike Guerra, Kat has no recollection of seeing Back\nto the Future for the first time. \u201cIt just felt like the movies were always\nthere, always a part of my life,\u201d she told me.\n\nAs a teenager, Kat was allowed to choose which parent to live with, and she\npicked her dad. She spent her high school years on a farm in Bedminster, New\nJersey. (The exact site that would later become the Trump National Golf Club\nBedminster.) She rode dirt bikes around the vast property, did musical theater\nin private school, and sometimes endured cocaine jokes from her peers. Her\nbest friend at the time taught Kat how to fix her own computer and inspired\nher habit of tinkering with the machines.\n\nShe modeled for a few years after high school but stayed geeky, spending her\nnights on hacking competitions. Then, in her early twenties, pregnant with her\nfirst child from a brief first marriage, she decided she didn\u2019t want to raise\nher son in the world she\u2019d known as the daughter of a supermodel. (These days\nshe refers to \u201cthat world\u201d of fabulous wealth from an almost mystified remove,\nas if the visit on the Schwarzeneggers\u2019 private jet and the pajama party with\nKourtney Kardashian had happened to someone else.) Instead, she took an IT\ninternship at Countrywide Financial\u2014later to be acquired by Bank of\nAmerica\u2014and started working her way up. She met a systems engineer named Jason\nSeymour at a company Christmas party and married him a little more than a\nmonth later at a drive-thru wedding chapel in Las Vegas. (Jason had wanted an\nElvis impersonator to officiate, but he wasn\u2019t available.) The following year,\nin 2005, her father died. John DeLorean had spent some of his final months\nattempting to trademark the name \u201cDeLorean Automobile Company\u201d through a\ncompany called Ephesians 6:12, which he\u2019d set up with Kat and Zach as co-\nowners. (The name is a reference to a biblical verse about struggling \u201cagainst\nthe rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high\nplaces.\u201d) But he passed away before application could be approved, so it was\nofficially listed as \u201cabandoned.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nNoncompetes Are Dead\u2014and Tech Workers Are Free to Roam\n\nAmanda Hoover\n\n  * Security\n\nCyberspies Hacked Cisco Firewalls to Access Government Networks\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Gear\n\nWe Tested the BYD Seal\u2014the Car That Explains Why Tesla Just Cut Its Prices\n\nMark Andrews\n\n  * Security\n\nChange Healthcare Finally Admits It Paid Ransomware Hackers\u2014and Still Faces a\nPatient Data Leak\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nJohn\u2019s death devastated Kat. Although she remained fiercely proud of her\nfather and kept attending car shows in her capacity as a DeLorean, she went\nprofessionally by her married name, Seymour, and maintained a separation\nbetween those two identities. But in the 2020s, as the DMC-12\u2019s 40th\nanniversary approached, John\u2019s name was popping up in documentaries and movies\nagain, and Kat was not happy with some of the portrayals depicting him as a\nkind of narcissistic hustler. She became determined to get the positive story\nof John DeLorean out.\n\nAs a big \u201ctrust the universe\u201d person, she believed it was meaningful that an\nactual angel (Guerra) had shown up in her life with a design. So through the\nsummer and fall of 2022, Kat\u2019s ambitions took the shape of a car. The model\nwould be called JZD, her dad\u2019s initials, and the company would pour the sales\nrevenue into more education programs\u2014expanding into underserved areas in the\nindustrial Midwest where her dad made his career. She resisted even calling\nthe venture a \u201ccar company\u201d; she much preferred to say it was a \u201cdream-\nempowerment company fueled by automobiles,\u201d in the same way Girl Scouts is a\nyouth-empowerment organization fueled in part by cookies.\n\nWhatever the company was, the New Hampshire farmhouse turned into its de facto\nheadquarters. Kat and Jason took video meetings, recruited talent, and\nentertained wild ideas about what a new car \u201cwith DeLorean DNA\u201d could do. (She\njoked: \u201cLeave it to me to start a car company right when nepo babies are a\nthing.\u201d) Could they source sustainable stainless steel for their first car by\nmelting down old appliances? Could they use recycled computer chips to control\nit? Could they make virtual-reality manufacturing labs for their students, to\nassemble first a virtual car and then a real one? This was going to be a\nbrand-new kind of car company\u2014among the first ever founded by a woman and\nlikely the first intended to be a not-for-profit.\n\nWith these big visions came big promises. In August 2022, Kat posted a\nscreenshot from John\u2019s final automotive business plan, which promised to\n\u201cshake the automotive world\u201d with a car that would kick off \u201can affair with\nman and machine at a price point that will be affordable.\u201d She expressed an\nintent to follow these wishes with her own car company.

Jason was so high on enthusiasm for the new company, and pride in\nhis wife\u2019s ambition, that he dashed off a public promise on the DNG Motors\nInstagram account. \u201cUNVEILED SEPTEMBER 13, 2023,\u201d read an image of white text\non a black background, with Jason\u2019s caption: \u201cDeLorean is back in the Motor\nCity.\u201d He\u2019d just committed them to building a car for the Detroit Auto Show.\nWhen Kat saw the post, she flipped out.\n\nSoon afterward, the DeLorean Motor Company in Texas sent Kat a cease-and-\ndesist, demanding she stop using the DeLorean name for her planned car. She\nand Jason had their lawyer send a reply asserting their rights and expressing\ntheir willingness to litigate, and kept going.\n\nDeLorean Motor Company sits in a squat building off a tangle of highways in\nsuburban Houston\u2014you drive past some shabby lots and fields, and then the\n1980s spring up around a curve in the road, where a retro-looking DMC logo\nlooms over a row of DMC-12s in the parking lot. You might even spot a JIGAWAT\nlicense plate there. Inside the garage/warehouse is an array of disembodied\ngull-wing doors that evoke a flock of injured birds. Old covers of Deloreans\nmagazines stare out from frames in the showroom.\n\nThis is the realm of Stephen Wynne, a Liverpool-born mechanic who has devoted\nhis life to DeLorean the car\u2014to the point of driving his son Cameron to\nkindergarten in DMC-12s that appeared in Back to the Future. Wynne is less\nimpressed with DeLorean the man, however. \u201cI have more respect for the team\nthat he put together,\u201d he says. \u201cAll you hear about is John DeLorean and not\nthe team, and that, to me, is not right.\u201d John was, Wynne said, ahead of his\ntime as an engineer. But: \u201cHe made the company, and he also, you know, killed\nthe company in the end.\u201d\n\nIt was Wynne who picked up the pieces, effectively securing a monopoly on the\nsmall, strange market for DeLorean parts. This was not a decision about\npreserving someone else\u2019s legacy; it was about securing his own future. \u201cIt\nfelt to me like, to control my destiny, going forward, it was to have control\nof the parts,\u201d he told me in the shop as tools clanked against cars behind us.\n\u201cIf someone was going to get it, I wanted it to be me.\u201d He founded the new\nDeLorean Motor Company in 1995.\n\nWynne considers the original buyers of the 1980s DeLorean to have been\n\u201centrepreneurial, outside-of-the-box-thinking type people,\u201d with something a\n\u201clittle bit different about them\u201d\u2014less interested in owning a really fast\nsports car than a piece of cultural history. (The original DeLorean did 0 to\n60 in about 10.5 seconds, something my used Hyundai can easily beat.) \u201cWe\nbelieve that there\u2019s much more wealth in that market these days,\u201d Wynne says.\n\nOver the years, Wynne and team made various plans to serve this market of\n\u201cmodern nerds\u201d with new cars built mostly from original parts. But federal\nregulators were slow to relax the rules that said these historic replicas had\nto meet current safety standards, so the revival of the DMC-12\u2014with its lack\nof airbags, a third brake light, and antilock brakes, for instance\u2014never\nhappened. Still, the company did a thriving business in parts sales and car\nservice. It also made a good buck from the DeLorean brand, which it\nalternately licensed for apparel, video games, and the like, or zealously\nprotected via cease-and-desists and lawsuits.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nNoncompetes Are Dead\u2014and Tech Workers Are Free to Roam\n\nAmanda Hoover\n\n  * Security\n\nCyberspies Hacked Cisco Firewalls to Access Government Networks\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Gear\n\nWe Tested the BYD Seal\u2014the Car That Explains Why Tesla Just Cut Its Prices\n\nMark Andrews\n\n  * Security\n\nChange Healthcare Finally Admits It Paid Ransomware Hackers\u2014and Still Faces a\nPatient Data Leak\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nFinally, Wynne got to talking with a Tesla alum named Joost de Vries, who\u2019d\nbeen involved in previous efforts to electrify the DeLorean. The DeLorean\nbrand, de Vries argued, was so universally beloved, and startup costs for\nelectric vehicles were so much less than even 15 years earlier, that they\ncould partner up to build a brand-new electric DeLorean. Together they formed\na San Antonio\u2013based spinoff of DeLorean Motor Company, called DeLorean Motors\nReimagined, with the Wynne family as the largest shareholders and de Vries as\nCEO. (Wynne\u2019s son, the former time-traveling kindergartner, is now the\ncompanies\u2019 chief brand officer.) De Vries would lead the development of the\ncar, and funding would come largely from private investors. The company\nincorporated in Texas in November 2021 (smack in between when Guerra posted\nhis design in late 2020 and when Kat got involved in mid-2022). Wynne and de\nVries hired Italdesign, the same firm that had drafted the original DMC-12, to\ndesign the Alpha5.\n\nDeLorean Motors Reimagined hoped to build 88 cars to start (88 mph being the\nspeed at which Doc Brown\u2019s DeLorean traveled through time), then about 9,500.\nThe car would be \u201clow volume, high-end, very exclusive, weird, wild\ntechnology,\u201d according to de Vries, an imposing, bald Dutchman with the hard-\ncharging swagger of the Silicon Valley executive he once was. \u201cDeLorean was\nalways attainable luxury. My price tag is not going to be attainable luxury.\u201d\n\nEarly sketches of the Alpha5.Photograph: DeLorean Motor Company\n\nDeLorean Motors Reimagined went from founding to concept car within nine\nmonths. The company even bought a 15-second Super Bowl spot in February 2022,\ncryptically teasing the new car and setting off buzz in the automotive press.\nThe Alpha5 premiered at the Pebble Beach auto show that August. It was only a\nconcept, meant to show off design and technology, not a finished product that\ncould operate on the road. But it was a real object that existed in the real\nworld and was promised to be on sale to the public in 2024.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nNoncompetes Are Dead\u2014and Tech Workers Are Free to Roam\n\nAmanda Hoover\n\n  * Security\n\nCyberspies Hacked Cisco Firewalls to Access Government Networks\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Gear\n\nWe Tested the BYD Seal\u2014the Car That Explains Why Tesla Just Cut Its Prices\n\nMark Andrews\n\n  * Security\n\nChange Healthcare Finally Admits It Paid Ransomware Hackers\u2014and Still Faces a\nPatient Data Leak\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nBy that point, the JZD, Kat\u2019s model, was still in the design phase, living for\nthe most part in computers.\n\nThe steps to getting a new car from invention to production are standard,\nwhether you\u2019re General Motors, DeLorean Motors Reimagined, or DeLorean Next\nGeneration. On average, the process takes about five years. You have to design\nand engineer the car; find suppliers for thousands of parts, from wheels to\nseats to instrument panels; get tools custom-made to stamp out your body\npanels; and find or build the facility and the workforce to put these things\ntogether. This is all before you can actually mass-produce something that\nresembles the original design.\n\nSo it is not at all unusual for a concept car to appear at an auto show and\nthen for nothing resembling it to ever materialize on actual roads. A paint\nfacility alone can set a company back hundreds of millions of dollars. This is\nin fact why the original DeLorean was stainless steel: John DeLorean couldn\u2019t\nafford a paint plant. (His marketing genius, Kat says, was that \u201che made you\nall think it was intentional.\u201d) John Z. DeLorean had his first prototype by\n1976, within about a year of founding his company; the first DMC-12s went on\nsale in 1981.\n\nTheoretically, then, it was possible to build a one-off JZD concept car\u2014if not\na production-ready prototype\u2014in the 11 months Kat and Jason had between\nfounding the company and the 2023 Detroit Auto Show. Kat projected confidence\nonstage at a Miami auto show in January 2023, while a digital rendering of the\nJZD zoomed along mountain roads on a screen behind her. But shortly after that\nappearance, she started getting stressed out about the timeline. Potential\nmanufacturing partners were telling her it was wildly unrealistic. Even\ngetting the doors to open and close the same way every time was its own feat\nof engineering, and Kat couldn\u2019t tell them whether the car would run on gas,\nbatteries, or both. (She wanted students to make that decision as part of an\nengineering challenge she had yet to set up.)

She literally jumped up and down after a green \u201966 Pontiac GTO Tri-Power\npulled onto the lot. She inspected the carburetors under the hood and declared\nthat this model, in midnight blue, was her \u201cultimate dream car,\u201d shout-\nlaughing when the owner confessed to the absurd gas mileage\u2014about 8 miles per\ngallon in the city\u2014then apologizing, through laughter, for laughing.\n\nBy 8 am she was posted up behind a mic to discuss her father and her own\nplans. \u201cMy father was my best friend in the whole world,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the\nsummers, I sat and played gin rummy with him on the couch, to the point where\nthere was a worn spot in each place where we sat\u2014a big one and a little one.\u201d\nShe got teary-eyed during the Q&A period when a kid of maybe 10 told her of\nhis plans to be a robotics engineer. He hoped, he said, to make cars that\ncould turn into robots that could \u201chelp people and protect humans from like,\nanything bad that can happen.\u201d She would later tell me that this moment and\nothers like it in Augusta added up to a turning point for her\u2014that \u201call of a\nsudden it was like, OK, whatever I have to do, whatever pain I have to go\nthrough, if it means building a car company, then I\u2019m going to do it, because\nI want that moment every day for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nAnd when a well-meaning questioner brought up the Alpha5, she spoke carefully\nthrough a tight smile. \u201cThat is being made by the company DeLorean Motor\nCompany Texas, and they\u2019re not affiliated at all with the family or the\noriginal car. And I think that\u2019s about all I\u2019m going to say about that one.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Joost de Vries about Kat DeLorean\u2019s efforts a few weeks later, he\nwas less diplomatic. \u201cThere\u2019s just something loose in her head,\u201d he said.\n\u201cKat\u2019s thing is illegal. And she\u2019s being shut down.\u201d He said in a later\nconversation that she would be \u201chammered with lawsuits\u201d as soon as her car\nappeared at the Detroit Auto Show.\n\nDe Vries and I were in a bland tech office park in San Antonio, where he sat\nin his glass-walled office. He was well aware that the Alpha5 design was\npolarizing in the DeLorean community. (Some DeLorean forum users had groused\nthat the model just looked like another Tesla with gull-wing doors; one called\nthe whole effort \u201clittle more than slapping the name of a beloved car on an\nunrelated vehicle.\u201d) He also knew the discouraging fate that had befallen many\nan EV brand before his. Other high-end EV companies such as Lucid, Rivian, and\nthe failed-then-resurrected Fisker had burned through billions and missed\nproduction targets, and even market leader Tesla was then struggling to bring\nits hyped (stainless-steel) Cybertruck to market. DeLorean Motors Reimagined\nhad hit supply-chain snags and cut its planned production run by more than\nhalf, to 4,000 cars. But de Vries had something most EV companies didn\u2019t: a\nbrand that much of the world already knew. \u201cThe only thing I need to do is put\ngood product into an existing brand,\u201d he said.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nNoncompetes Are Dead\u2014and Tech Workers Are Free to Roam\n\nAmanda Hoover\n\n  * Security\n\nCyberspies Hacked Cisco Firewalls to Access Government Networks\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Gear\n\nWe Tested the BYD Seal\u2014the Car That Explains Why Tesla Just Cut Its Prices\n\nMark Andrews\n\n  * Security\n\nChange Healthcare Finally Admits It Paid Ransomware Hackers\u2014and Still Faces a\nPatient Data Leak\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nThe question, of course, is whose brand \u201cDeLorean\u201d really is. Both companies\ninsist on their own rights to use it. And each calls the other\u2019s claim\ntransparently illegitimate.\n\nStephen Wynne registered and enforced trademarks on \u201cDeLorean\u201d and \u201cDeLorean\nMotor Company\u201d in the 2000s, as John\u2019s trademarks were canceled or abandoned,\nand he has renewed and protected them ever since. Furthermore, in a 2015\nsettlement with John DeLorean\u2019s estate, a woman named Sally Baldwin DeLorean,\nacting as John\u2019s widow, acknowledged \u201cthe worldwide rights of DMC to use,\nregister, and enforce any of the DeLorean Marks for any and all goods and\nservices\u201d related to cars, clothes, and \u201cpromotional items\u201d\u2014for which DMC paid\nher an undisclosed sum. So, yes, it is Kat\u2019s name. But it\u2019s someone else\u2019s\ntrademark, and it\u2019s one she has never tried publicly to contest until now.\n\nKat\u2019s argument includes that seemingly simple but possibly irrelevant\npart\u2014it\u2019s her name\u2014but also a convoluted part. She doesn\u2019t believe John\nactually ever married Sally. Nor do several people I spoke to from John\u2019s\norbit at the time, including his son, Zach, none of whom can recall John\nmentioning a marriage to her. Kat told me she searched for and never found a\nmarriage certificate. Nor did a private detective she hired. (Sally Baldwin\nDeLorean\u2019s lawyer did not return requests for comment, and attempts to reach\nher directly via listed phone numbers were unsuccessful.) John\u2019s will names\nhis son as executor. Zach, balking at the prospect of attorney\u2019s fees, never\nactually filed the will. Kat contends that Baldwin\u2019s settlement with the\nDeLorean Motor Company is illegitimate, as she was never in a position to act\non behalf of the estate in the first place. What should have happened, Kat\nthinks, is for the US Patent and Trademark Office to reach out to her and\nZach, as co-owners of Ephesians 6:12, about her dad\u2019s pending application.\n\nThen there is the question of infringement, a key standard for which is\n\u201clikelihood of causing confusion.\u201d Kat\u2019s DeLorean Next Generation is not using\nthe exact same set of words as Wynne\u2019s DeLorean Motor Company, but it is fair\nto say, based on the Alpha5 question that Kat got in Augusta\u2014and on a well-\nmeaning Reddit commenter who\u2019d tried to buy Kat\u2019s car only to accidentally\nreserve an Alpha5\u2014that some members of the public are indeed confused. Yet\neach side accuses the other of doing the confusing.\n\nBoth sides have told me a lawsuit is inevitable. No jury decision is\nguaranteed\u2014determining \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d itself involves a\n(confusing!) 13-factor test. But New Jersey trademark attorney Richard\nCatalina, who is not affiliated with either party, told me that the \u201cstronger\nlegal arguments\u201d belong to the Texas company. \u201cTrademark rights only accrue\nwith use. If you\u2019re not using the mark, you can lose your rights to it,\u201d\nCatalina said.\n\n\u201cI just learned the. Craziest. Thing,\u201d Kat told me on the phone last summer.\nShe\u2019d recently found the 1985 interview with William Haddad, the executive\nwho\u2019d found it \u201cexciting as hell\u201d how much good DeLorean Motor Company had\nachieved in Northern Ireland. Haddad had been crushed by the company\u2019s\ncollapse, and now, in 1985, called it a \u201cscam\u201d and John himself a thief. (John\nhad always denied this and was never convicted of financial misdeeds.) But\nHaddad was wistful about John\u2019s squandered ambition to locate factories where\nthey could do the most social good. \u201cIf only he had done it ... Can you\nimagine it?\u201d Haddad mused in the interview.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nNoncompetes Are Dead\u2014and Tech Workers Are Free to Roam\n\nAmanda Hoover\n\n  * Security\n\nCyberspies Hacked Cisco Firewalls to Access Government Networks\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Gear\n\nWe Tested the BYD Seal\u2014the Car That Explains Why Tesla Just Cut Its Prices\n\nMark Andrews\n\n  * Security\n\nChange Healthcare Finally Admits It Paid Ransomware Hackers\u2014and Still Faces a\nPatient Data Leak\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\nKat knew the Northern Ireland story well already, but Haddad had put John\u2019s\ngoal and his downfall in terms that suddenly clicked for her. She and Jason\nhad been so caught up in the crazy timeline they\u2019d set for themselves that\nthey were risking following precisely her dad\u2019s path\u2014letting one car distract\nthem from their bigger goal of supporting young engineers. \u201cIf my car company\nfails, that\u2019s OK,\u201d Kat said. Her goal had always been to create an education\nprogram for students who have \u201cdreams that have been robbed from them,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cAnd if I can\u2019t do that with this car, then it\u2019s not worth the car.\u201d\n\nOne thing was obvious: They were moving too fast. Kat decided she would not\nunveil the prototype of the JZD until her father\u2019s 100th birthday, in 2025. In\nthe meantime, they would have students build a clay model for Detroit\u2014not a\nfull-size one, as automakers typically do during development, but one about\nthe size of a shoebox\u2014and debut it not at the Auto Show but concurrently at\nthe Detroit Historical Society. Later on, they\u2019d enlist students to help build\na prototype of their Model JZD on top of a Corvette C8 platform, picking\nparticipants through an online contest in which students described their\ndreams. After that would come a separate line of cars under something called\nProject 42, involving a hand build of 42 customized cars. These would have a\nsales price of probably over a million dollars each (which would also include\ndriving outfits and a motorcycle to go with each car). They\u2019d use the proceeds\nto fund the education program. So if the Alpha5 was going to be \u201cunattainable\nluxury\u201d and its likely market rich tech bros, then these custom cars would be\nyet less attainable and probably serve a market of billionaires.\n\nDeLorean Motor Company Alpha5Photograph: DeLorean Motor Company\n\nDeLorean Next Generation JZDCourtesy of \u00c1ngel Guerra\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since DMC Texas and Kat DeLorean both announced their new\ncar projects. Neither has sued the other yet, and both are cagey about plans\nto do so. Joost de Vries stepped down from the helm of DeLorean Motors\nReimagined last October, for reasons the company won\u2019t disclose. A lawsuit\nagainst de Vries and other DeLorean Motors Reimagined executives, in which de\nVries\u2019 former employer Karma Automotive accused him and others of stealing the\nEV maker\u2019s intellectual property, was dismissed after a reported out-of-court\nsettlement. Timelines have slipped enough now that Cameron Wynne won\u2019t specify\nexactly when the Alpha5 will be on sale\u2014he says sometime in 2025. For Kat\u2019s\nventure, meanwhile, \u00c1ngel Guerra continues to revise the design. The car will\nnot be stainless.\n\nDeLorean fans have been burned many times by promises of the next car, and\ngiven the delays in both projects, skepticism about both potential new ones\npervades DeLorean-related internet forums. (Indeed, as this story went to\npress in April, a San Antonio paper reported that DeLorean Reimagined had shut\ndown its headquarters; a DMC executive told me the company was just moving\nlocations.) Both companies continue to promise big things. Promises, after\nall, are part of the DeLorean legacy too.\n\nLet us know what you think about this article.
