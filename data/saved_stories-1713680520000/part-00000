It came after the Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, forced a series\nof bills onto the floor in the face of fierce resistance within his own\nRepublican party, many of whom oppose spending more on Ukraine\u2019s defense.\n\nRussia-Ukraine war: who will finance Ukraine\u2019s defence?\n\nRead more\n\nVoting began hours ahead of schedule in an extraordinary Saturday session that\ndelayed the House\u2019s planned recess. The House erupted into applause when the\nUkraine bill passed, with the chair, Marc Molinaro of New York, admonishing\nmembers not to wave Ukrainian flags.\n\nIn a powerful effort to sum up the stakes before the vote, the former\nDemocratic speaker, Nancy Pelosi, made a stridently graphic appeal: \u201cI hope\nour colleagues will choose democracy and decency rather than autocracy and\nevil because I fear if you choose the Putin route, you will have blood on your\nhands, blood of the children, blood of their mothers raped in front of their\nparents, raped in front of their children,\u201d she said.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine\u2019s president, recently warned that his country\n\u201cwill lose the war\u201d without US assistance, as its military has struggled with\nammunition and air defense shortages and Russia has pressed a growing\nadvantage in firepower as Congress prevaricated.\n\nImmediately after the bill passed, ZelenskIy released a statement expressing\nhis gratitude to both parties \u201cand personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the\ndecision that keeps history on the right track\u201d.\n\n\u201cDemocracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never\nfail as long as America helps to protect it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vital US aid bill\npassed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and\nthousands of lives, and help both of our nations to become stronger. Just\npeace and security can only be attained through strength. We hope that bills\nwill be supported in the Senate and sent to President Biden\u2019s desk. Thank you,\nAmerica!\u201d\n\nMembers were voting on a package worth close to $95bn in total, but which had\nbeen broken up into four separate bills, as Johnson effectively de-coupled the\nvote on Ukraine from funding for Israel, which is more widely supported among\nboth Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe vote on granting additional funding for Israel also easily passed the\nHouse, with 365 in favor and only 57 opposed: 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans.\n\nBy splitting the bill into four, Johson sought to give recalcitrant far-right\nmembers of his own GOP conference the opportunity to vote with their\nconscience on the parts they disliked.\n\nFirst to be voted on was a bill including legislation on border security,\nwhich failed, as expected. Many rightwing Republicans do not want the Biden\nadministration to win credit for resolving a crisis at the US border with\nMexico, where there has been an upsurge of asylum seekers, during an election\nyear. The GOP\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, is seeking to\nmake the border an election issue.\n\nThe $95bn in total funding includes roughly $61bn for Ukraine (with much of\nthe funding going towards replenishing American munitions); $26bn for Israel;\n$8bn for US allies in the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan; and $9bn in\nhumanitarian assistance for civilians in war zones, such as Haiti, Sudan and\nGaza, though the package also includes a ban on direct US funding for the\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), an\nagency providing key assistance to Gaza, until March 2025.\n\nIn the Ukraine bill, of the $60.7bn, a total of about $23bn would be used by\nthe US to replenish its military stockpiles, opening the door to future US\nmilitary transfers to Ukraine. Another $14bn would go to the Ukraine Security\nAssistance Initiative, in which the Pentagon buys advanced new weapon systems\nfor the Ukrainian military directly from US defense contractors.\n\nThere is also more than $11bn to fund current US military operations in the\nregion, enhancing the capabilities of the Ukrainian military and fostering\nintelligence collaboration between Kyiv and Washington, and about $8bn in non-\nmilitary assistance, such as helping Ukraine\u2019s government continue basic\noperations, including the payment of salaries and pensions.\n\nThe package largely mirrors the foreign aid proposal passed by the Senate in\nFebruary, although it designates $10bn of the Ukraine funding as a repayable\nloan to appease some Republican members.\n\nThe Israel bill includes about $4.4bn to replenish depleted US supplies given\nto Israel; $4bn for missile defense, including the much-vaunted Iron Dome, and\n$1.2bn for the Iron Beam; and $3.5bn to help Israel buy weapons. There are\nalso provisions to make it easier to supply Israel with US munitions held in\nother countries.\n\nThe bill supporting American allies in the Asia-Pacific region, chiefly\nTaiwan, included more than $8bn for countering Chinese activities, about\n$3.3bn for submarines and $2bn of military assistance to Taiwan.\n\nAnother bill included a provision to force the Chinese company ByteDance to\nsell its popular social media app TikTok, which Congress is worried gives\nChina the ability to gain information about American citizens. That bill \u2013 the\n21st Century Peace through Strength Act \u2013 also included the seizure of frozen\nRussian sovereign assets, and more sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe passed bills will be combined into a single package to simplify the voting\nprocess for the Senate, which will need to reapprove the proposal before it\ncan go to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk for his signature.\n\nIn a statement after the vote passed, Biden said: \u201cToday, members of both\nparties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send\na clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At\nthis critical inflection point, they came together to answer history\u2019s call,\npassing urgently needed national security legislation that I have fought for\nmonths to secure.\n\n\u201cThis package will deliver critical support to Israel and Ukraine; provide\ndesperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, Sudan, Haiti and other locations\nimpacted by conflicts and natural disasters around the world; and bolster\nsecurity and stability in the Indo-Pacific. It comes at a moment of grave\nurgency, with Israel facing unprecedented attacks from Iran, and Ukraine under\ncontinued bombardment from Russia.\u201d He called on the Senate to quickly pass\nthe bill \u201cso that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and\nequipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs\u201d.\n\nSimply getting the bills to a vote on the foor required Johnson to seek help\nfrom Democrats across the aisle. A procedural vote to get it to the floor was\n316-94, with 165 Democrats and 151 Republicans supporting the motion.\n\nJohnson\u2019s reliance on Democratic votes to pass key pieces of legislation,\nincluding a major government funding bill that cleared the House last month,\nhas outraged some hard-right Republicans.\n\n\u201cWhat else did Johnson give away while he\u2019s begging Democrats for votes and\nprotection?\u201d Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative of Georgia,\nsaid on Friday on X. \u201cWe do not have a Republican majority anymore, our\nRepublican Speaker is literally controlled by the Democrats and giving them\neverything they want.\u201d\n\nLast month, Greene unveiled a motion to remove Johnson as speaker, although\nshe has not yet moved to force a vote on the matter. In the past week, two\nmore House Republicans \u2013 Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona \u2013\nhave signed on as co-sponsors.\n\nDemocrats have said they may support Johnson in any effort by the Republican\nfar-right to oust him over Ukraine aid.\n\nSpeaking from the Capitol earlier this week, Johnson said providing aid to\nUkraine was \u201ccritically important\u201d and \u201cthe right thing\u201d despite the potential\npower of his opponents to bring him down in yet another internal party coup.\n\n\u201cI really believe the intel and the briefings that we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Johnson\nsaid. \u201cI believe that Xi and Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of\nevil. I think they are in coordination on this. I think that Vladimir Putin\nwould continue to march through Europe.\n\n\u201cI am going to allow an opportunity for every single member of the House to\nvote their conscience and their will,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m willing to take a\npersonal risk for that, because we have to do the right thing. And history\nwill judge us.\u201d\n\nThe US has so far sent Ukraine roughly $111bn in weapons, equipment,\nhumanitarian assistance and other aid since the start of the war more than two\nyears ago.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * House of Representatives\n  * The Observer\n  * Ukraine\n  * Mike Johnson\n  * Russia\n  * US foreign policy\n  * US Congress\n  * Marjorie Taylor Greene\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
