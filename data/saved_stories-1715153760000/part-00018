Luck is, by definition, something that happens to you, not something\nyou can do for yourself. But you can learn behaviors that increase your odds\nof getting lucky in your career. It just boils down to optimizing for exposure\nto random good events. Here are 3 behaviors you can use to increase your\nprofessional luck.\n\nThanks for reading Silicon Ladders.

Cultivate a Broad Professional Network\n\nAfter the first 5-10 years of your career, most opportunities will come\nthrough your network, not recruiters or job postings. You are much more likely\nto get a really good opportunity from your network if your network is large.\n\nIf you\u2019ve only ever worked with 5 people, even if they all thought the world\nof you, they probably won\u2019t have a lot of opportunities to hire you later in\nyour career. And even if they do offer you excellent opportunities, there are\na hundred small details that might not work out. Maybe your friend wants you\nto co-found a startup, but you just bought a house and can\u2019t afford the\nfinancial instability. Maybe you get an offer to lead a large and innovative\nbusiness group in China, but you don\u2019t want to live abroad right now. On and\non. Finding truly excellent career opportunities is a numbers game: the more\nchances you have to play, the more likely you\u2019ll be successful.\n\n##\n\n2\\. Learn Interdisciplinary Skills\n\nIf you have spent 10 years becoming an experienced marketer, you\u2019ll be able to\nsee and resolve some kinds of marketing problems. Let\u2019s just use the variable\nX to stand in for all the marketing problems you can identify and resolve.\n\nIf you spend the next 10 years continuing to double down and deepen your\nmarketing skills, maybe you can increase your skill a bit, but you\u2019ll be\nhitting diminishing returns. Maybe you can get to 1.3X.\n\nBut let\u2019s say that you decide to pivot and spend the next 10 years learning\nsomething else entirely - say corporate accounting. At the end of that time,\nyou will be able to identify and resolve a whole new set of problems. We can\ndenote all of these problems as \u201cY.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s natural to assume that in the latter case, your skill at identifying and\nresolving problems can be expressed as X + Y. But multidisciplinary\nperspectives are at least multiplicative. You\u2019ll be able to identify and fix X\n* Y problems, perhaps even X^Y or Y^X. That means you\u2019ll be massively better-\nequipped to deliver real-world results to the business you work for.\n\n##\n\n3\\. Regularly Seek Out New Problems to Solve\n\nIf you want to get lucky, you need to optimize for breadth. Not just in your\nnetwork and skills, but in the problems you choose to tackle. That means\nregularly seeking out new challenges to work on.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t have to mean switching companies. It could mean switching roles\nwithin a company. It could just mean switching your projects within a team.\nAnd don\u2019t let formal career definitions constrain your search for interesting\nproblems. You could learn to build something with wood in your free time, or\nvolunteer with a nonprofit, or become a career mentor to someone else.\n\nIf you are constantly seeking out new problems to solve, you\u2019ll get better at\nlearning itself. That should enable you to more quickly identify and fix\ncritical issues that come up in your career.\n\n##\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nIf you want to reach the extreme heights of success in your career, it\u2019s not\nenough to be very skilled and very hard working. You also have to be very\nlucky. There are always counter-examples of extreme specialists hitting it\nbig. With that said, I think the dominant way to become very lucky is to\nmaximize your exposure to random opportunities.\n\nRemember that there isn\u2019t a causal relationship between behavior and extreme\nsuccess. There are only strong correlations. You can best correlate your\nbehaviors with extreme success by thinking about the size and quality of your\nnetwork, the breadth of your skills, and your exposure to new challenges.\nThen, maximize your long term gains by investing in each like an index fund.\n\nThanks for reading Silicon Ladders.
