The complex signals are profiled using our in-built software,\nallowing for an electronic nose-like result, with near-lab quality stability\nand sensitivity.\n\n### The key aspect of Scout3 is its modularity - it is made up of separate\nmodules. The modules can be swapped in and out allowing for quick system\nadaptation to testing needs.\n\n## Key features\n\n### The system is built to carefully balance gas chromatography-like precision\nwith the ease of use of modern day field instruments.\n\n  * ### An array of photoionization (PID) sensors for increased specificity, theoretical detection limit of 1 PPB;\n\n  * ### Active airflow pneumatics for faster and targeted analysis;\n\n  * ### Sample delivery via a sample flask for testing without specialist training;\n\n  * ### Optional gas chromatography column for increased molecule separation and identification, with programmable heating up to 70C;\n\n  * ### Filtration cartridge to be able to run analysis anywhere without specialty gas canisters;\n\n  * ### Patent-pending algorithms for enhanced compound detection and identification when comparable sample data is known from GC-MS analysis.\n\n### Modules can be offered individually.\n\nScout3 Enquiry\n\nBy using this website, you agree to our use of cookies.
