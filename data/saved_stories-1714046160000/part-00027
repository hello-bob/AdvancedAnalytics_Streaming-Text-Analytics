It was variously described as\n\u201cfrisky\u201d, \u201cspicy\u201d and \u201cunruly\u201d by commentators.\n\nAnd going back to the preparations ahead of the late Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee\nin 2022, when the media encampment was being set up, a soldier was thrown from\nhis horse outside Buckingham Palace. An embarrassingly public place, but these\nthings happen.\n\nPA MediaCopyright: PA Media\n\nKing Charles on horseback for the Trooping the Colour ceremony in June\n2023.Image caption: King Charles on horseback for the Trooping the Colour\nceremony in June 2023.\n\nArticle share tools\n\n     * Share this post\n\n       * Copy this link\n\nRead more about these links.\n\n  7.

They kept the horses calm\nwhile waiting for a horse box and veterinary team to arrive.\n\n\u201cPCs Brett Daniels and Chris Wilson took over management of traffic control on\nthe busy arterial road enabling PCs Rob Bray and Shaun Gurney on motorbikes to\ncreate a clear path for the horses to be safely led into the horse box and\nescorted back to the Army barracks for urgent medical care.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts are with those people and horses injured in the incident.\u201d\n\nArticle share tools\n\n     * Share this post\n\n       * Copy this link\n\nRead more about these links.\n\n  8.

It\nwas quite the scene with lots of emergency services around putting up cordons.\n\n\u201cOne of the black horses was there. I thought maybe it was a police horse that\nhad come to attend to the scene but obviously I now know it was one of the\nhorses that had escaped.\n\n\u201cThere was a blue tent around what I assume was an injured person.\n\n\u201cI saw what looked like a taxi van that had damage to it, a smashed window.
