The way I made the program\nwas less elegant than I conceived in my head. I thought about an elaborate\nscript that would parse an SVG file I made in a design tool and generate text,\nuntil I learned that what I thought was the best way was more complex than\nexpected.\n\nBy this point, I had a design for a trading card in a design tool, Figma. I\ndidn't want to lose the design, since it was just right and I was proud of the\ndesign I made. Thus, I used a plugin to export the data to HTML. The export\nwas not perfect: the page was divs, but readable and understandable by me, and\nparsable by a computer. Thus, the HTML was fit for purpose.\n\nWith this HTML template of a trading card, I planned to write a script that\nwould generate a trading card and take a screenshot of the page. Semantic\nmarkup was not a requirement since the web page was being captured using a\nscreenshot tool. Thus, the less-than-well-structured HTML was acceptable.\n\nI then wrote a script to generate the trading card. The script isn't perfect;\nthe HTML code could be easier to read. But it works! And I learned a thing or\ntwo about procedural image generation. First, I learned that design tools are\namazing and I should use them more. I had more room to think about the design\nof a page without worrying about development. I ususally do design and\ndevelopment in tandem. That is perhaps a contributing factor to my unrefined\ndesign skills. Second, I learned I should have written the HTML myself!\n\nI see opportunities for improvement in my code, but I have a start. I have a\nscript that generates trading cards. I shared it with friends. Other people\nwere interested. I am making progress on the project. I feel good.\n\nWith that said, there was a little part of me earlier today that worried about\nthe relative inelegance of the code. This had me thinking about other hobby\nprograms I have written. Many programs start off imperfect. A program may be\ntoo long, include an inefficient data structure, not work in all scenarios in\nwhich you want it to work. But, with effort one can address all of these\nimperfections and make a program that is readable, functional, and well-\ntested. I know my project can be better, but I needed to get some code on the\npage -- and to explore a few different avenues -- to chart a path forward.\nNow: Onward I look!\n\nShare this post on Hacker News.\n\nShare this post on Lobste.rs.\n\n## Responses\n\n## Comment on this post\n\nRespond to this post by sending a Webmention.\n\nHave a comment?
