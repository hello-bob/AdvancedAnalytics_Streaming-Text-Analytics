In the coming days, the university administration will\nassemble a team to ensure several imperatives: Students complete their\neducation, faculty and staff are supported, and research obligations are\nappropriately fulfilled.\n\nTexas A&M at Qatar (TAMUQ) opened in 2003 to advance education and research in\nchemical, electrical, mechanical, and petroleum engineering. TAMUQ is one of\nsix U.S. universities in Qatar\u2019s Education City.\n\n\u201cOver the last two decades, the Qatar campus has advanced ideals, graduated\nexceptional Aggie engineers, and is cemented as an important legacy of Texas\nA&M,\u201d said General (Ret.) Mark A. Welsh III, president of Texas A&M\nUniversity. \u201cAs we look to the future of our land-, sea- and space-grant\nuniversity, the global exchange of research and education will continue to be\nintegral to our world-class campuses here in the U.S.\u201d\n\nQatar is a peninsula that shares a land border with Saudi Arabia and sits\nacross the Persian Gulf from Iran. The U.S. considers Qatar an ally. The\nnation hosts the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East. Scores of U.S.\nbusinesses operate in Qatar, including major Texas-based energy companies.\n\nThe Board of Regents decided to reassess the university\u2019s physical presence in\nQatar in fall 2023 due to the heightened instability in the Middle East.\nThursday morning, Regents discussed the topic with Welsh and other top\nadministrators in executive session. In the afternoon\u2019s public session, Regent\nMike Hernandez made a motion to terminate the agreement with the Qatar\nFoundation. The motion was seconded by Regent Randy Brooks and passed on a 7-1\nvote. Regent Michael Plank dissented.\n\nMahomes said the board decided that Texas A&M can best advance its core\nmission \u2014 educating and serving Texans while advancing knowledge and\ninnovation through world-class research \u2014 by concentrating its focus in Texas.\n\n\u201cThe work in Qatar is great work,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cBut it is a fraction of what\nTexas A&M accomplishes year after year.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Texas A&M and affiliated System agencies collaborate on research\nwith about 30 other nations without operating separate campuses on foreign\nsoil.\n\n\u201cThe university has numerous other ways to give international students\nopportunities to be Aggies and to give Aggies opportunities to study\ninternationally,\u201d Mahomes said.\n\nTags:\n\n  * ## About Texas A&M at Qatar\n\n    * Mission and Vision\n    * Senior Leadership\n    * Advisory Boards\n    * Strategic Priorities\n    * Faculty Searches\n    * Internal Faculty Support\n    * Work at TAMUQ\n    * Operations\n    * Aggie Core Values and Traditions\n    * Texas A&M Engineering Building\n\n  * ## Admissions\n\n  * ## Academic Resources\n\n    * Academics\n    * Academic Advising\n    * Library\n    * Writing Center\n    * Science Learning Support\n\n  * ## Emergency Preparedness\n\n    * Emergency Operations Status\n    * Safety and Security\n\n  * Risk, Fraud and Misconduct Hotline\n  * Title IX Reporting\n\n## TAMU at Qatar TAMU at Qatar TAMU at Qatar Facebook TAMU at Qatar Instagram\nTAMU at Qatar LinkedIn TAMU at Qatar Twitter TAMU at Qatar YouTube\n\nBack to top\n\nEmergency Operations Status Safety and Security Emergency Preparedness\nWebmaster Accessibility Policy Risk, Fraud and Misconduct Hotline Title IX at\nTexas A&M at Qatar\n\n", "frontpage": true}
