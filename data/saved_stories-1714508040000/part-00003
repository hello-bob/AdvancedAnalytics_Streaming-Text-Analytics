The top court denied Musk's petition without\ncomment Monday morning in a list of orders.\n\nThe SEC brought a securities fraud charge against Musk after his August 2018\ntweets stating, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured\"\nand \"Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is\nthat it's contingent on a shareholder vote.\"\n\nThe SEC said the tweets were false and misleading because \"Musk had not even\ndiscussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any\npotential funding source,\" and he \"knew that he had not satisfied numerous\nadditional contingencies.\" Musk's tweets caused Tesla's stock price to jump by\nover 6 percent and harmed investors by causing \"significant confusion and\ndisruption in the market for Tesla's stock,\" the SEC alleged.\n\n## Musk claimed \u201ceconomic duress\u201d\n\nMusk claimed he was the victim of \"economic duress\" when he agreed to the\nsettlement and that the SEC \"weaponized\" the deal in order to \"muzzle and\nharass Mr. Musk and Tesla.\" In addition to the clause requiring pre-approval\nof tweets, the settlement required Musk and Tesla to each pay $20 million in\npenalties and forced Musk to step down from his board chairman post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA US District Court judge rejected Musk's attempt to get out of the settlement\nin April 2022. A three-judge panel at the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd\nCircuit unanimously ruled against Musk in May 2023. The appeals court later\ndenied Musk's request for an en banc rehearing in front of all the court's\njudges.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit panel ruling dismissed Musk's argument that the settlement is\na \"prior restraint\" on his speech, writing, \"Parties entering into consent\ndecrees may voluntarily waive their First Amendment and other rights.\" The\njudges also saw \"no evidence to support Musk's contention that the SEC has\nused the consent decree to conduct bad-faith, harassing investigations of his\nprotected speech.\"\n\nMusk's petition to the Supreme Court said the case presents the constitutional\nquestion of whether \"a party's acceptance of a benefit prevents that party\nfrom contending that the government violated the unconstitutional conditions\ndoctrine in requiring a waiver of constitutional rights in exchange for that\nbenefit.\"\n\n## SEC: Settlement designed to prevent securities violations\n\nThe SEC urged the Supreme Court to reject Musk's petition in a March 2024\nfiling. The Supreme Court \"has consistently held that, in resolving\nlitigation, parties may choose to waive even fundamental constitutional\nrights,\" the SEC said.\n\nThe Musk settlement \"was reasonably designed to minimize the likelihood that\npetitioner would make future false or misleading statements in violation of\nthe securities laws,\" the SEC wrote. Musk's reply brief filed a few weeks ago\nclaimed that the agency's \"arguments highlight the need for review. In effect,\nthe SEC argues that the Constitution imposes no limits on its authority to\nextract demands in its settlements.\"\n\nAlthough Musk lost all attempts to terminate the settlement, he persuaded a\njury in February 2023 to reject a class-action lawsuit filed by Tesla\ninvestors who claimed the tweets caused $12 billion in losses.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n196\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
