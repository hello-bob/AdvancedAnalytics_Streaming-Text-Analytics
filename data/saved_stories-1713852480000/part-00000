It\u2019s a\nSpotify companion that shows your current song in the menu bar. It also has a\ncouple other conveniences like Next Track, and Copy Spotify URL. I\u2019d like to\nbriefly share how this came about, and how I feel about making my first app\nfrom scratch.\n\n## How it came about\n\nI suppose I am like Jerry Seinfeld in the sense that I get bothered by life\u2019s\nlittle annoyances. To be clear, I don\u2019t hold grudges or let it get to me, but\nfriction in my day-to-day life is a bother, and I do my best to reduce it.\n\nOne of those annoyances is this: when I\u2019m in the middle of work, listening to\nmusic, I will occasionally hear a great song that I\u2019ve never heard before.\nObviously, I can open my Spotify app to see what it is, but I find this\ndisruptive and I\u2019d rather shift my vision a bit to satisfy my curiosity. For\nsome reason, I wasn\u2019t able to find what I was looking for for several years,\nuntil I recently stumbled upon SpotMenu.\n\nSpotMenu does exactly what my new app does, namely show the currently playing\nsong and artist in the menu bar.\n\nA screenshot of SpotMenu expanded. Playback controls are visible when you\nhover over the album cover.\n\nThis basically solved my problem, though I found out about some things I\ndidn\u2019t like. For example, it does a marquee animation when the text length\nexceeds the available width. This is fine, except for the fact that it can use\nup to 10% of the computer\u2019s CPU time while idling.\n\nThe maintainer of the project either ignored the issue or didn\u2019t have time to\naddress it, which frankly, is fine. Maintaining an open-source project is a\nlot of (sometimes thankless) work. This bugged me though. I had a couple of\noptions: submit a pull request, fork the repository, or start my own project.\nFor a number of reasons, I decided to start my own.\n\n## The work begins\n\nAnd just like that, I was off to the races. I chose the name SoundSeer as a\ncorny pun\u2013you can see the sound. Get it, SoundSeer? I exclusively used Claude\nOpus as my \u201ccopilot\u201d and let me tell you, it made a huge difference.\n\nI had previous experience working on a large iOS web browser at Neeva, but\nthings are quite different when starting from scratch. I had to get familiar\nwith macOS-specific APIs, entitlements, App Store requirements (marketing\ncopy, logos, etc.), and more. I even had Claude draft up a (hopefully)\nbulletproof privacy policy that would get me through review.\n\nI had a sense of what I wanted\u2013something very minimal that used almost no\ncompute. I did not use any mockup software, I just rapidly prototyped the\nsmall app as I went. Eventually, I ended up with this:\n\nA screenshot of SoundSeer\u2019s UI.\n\nI leveraged my almost 2,000-follower base on Threads to spread the word and\nask for feedback. I was (and still am) abundantly grateful to the folks who\nshared, tested, and provided feedback about my app.\n\nDebuting my app on Threads.\n\n## Lessons learned\n\nIt\u2019s always a much different experience when you build something from scratch\nvs. maintaining a legacy project at a large company. My big takeaways from\nthis were:\n\n  * Ruthlessly prioritize. I knew that I wanted to ship the app fast to get feedback and iterate. This meant that only an MVP was necessary to ship to the App Store.\n  * Think of the user first. This was not a vanity engineering project. I was solving a real problem for myself. Every line of code written was to serve the user experience.\n  * Have fun. I honestly can\u2019t remember the last time I had so much fun working on a software project. Using an LLM as my copilot helped a lot, but I also had the freedom to explore my curiosity without worrying about business constraints.\n\n## Where to go from here\n\nNow that SoundSeer is on the App Store (another shameless plug), I feel\nslightly relieved that it is being distributed and tested by external users. I\nam still working relentlessly to improve the product. For example, I have\nalready implemented instant, efficient visual updates, Open at Login, and\ndynamic width resizing to fit in the menu bar. Also on the roadmap is Apple\nMusic and Last.fm support. However, I am taking a bit more time to ship\nupdates now because I want to be confident in the product\u2019s stability.\n\nIf I could wrap up this post in one sentence, it would be this: it feels great\nto build again. I love solving problems (especially my own), and it is such an\namazing feeling to receive comments from users telling you that you made\nsomething useful.\n\nOnwards\n\n## Comments\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nJonathan Garelick\n\n## About\n\n## Privacy\n\n## Social\n\nDesigned with WordPress\n\n", "frontpage": false}
