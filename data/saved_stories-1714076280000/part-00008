We are making changes in that area \u2014 not least due to specific\npatterns in user behavior, and now it's a good time to discuss that.\n\n## Long-Term Support Release Builds\n\nThe approach to building LTS branches will change soon: it will be possible to\nbuild using our online building platform (VyOS Image Builder Enhanced) when\nit\u2019s ready.\n\nThe service will be affordable but not free of charge \u2014 you will be required\nto pay for consumed resources like storage, CPU, and traffic used to build\nimages. The alternative will be to build everything from source \u2014 we will keep\nrolling release package repositories available to everyone, but if you want to\nbuild LTS releases, the process of building custom packages, assembling them\ninto repositories, and building images will be on you.\n\nHistorically, we made building LTS releases exceptionally easy. This is not an\nexaggeration: we are unaware of any distro that would provide an equivalent of\nour make iso.\n\nOne reason for the decision to make it so easy was that in the early days of\nVyOS, users had to choose between an outdated but well-tested \"LTS\" (not yet\ncalled LTS back then) based on the code of Vyatta Core and between the\nexperimental, perpetually broken branch that was to become VyOS 1.2/Crux\neventually.\n\nEven in the early days of 1.2/Crux, our automated testing infrastructure was\nin its infancy, and the rolling release often wouldn't even boot, and if it\ndid boot, it could be broken in unpredictable ways. The only way to give a\nworking image to anyone who needed it but keep the \u201cpay for prebuilt images\u201d\nmodel (rather than introducing more intrusive commercialization) was to keep\nthe LTS branch as easy to build as the rolling release.\n\nWe assumed that a large community of contributors would form once we\neliminated all the technical debt in the old code. This never happened\n\nInstead, we observe more people building LTS images to distribute them online\nrather than for personal use. GitHub repositories with automated LTS builds\nare popping up every month. We try to give all people the benefit of the doubt\nand ask them politely to stop and explain why we want them to stop. Still, we\nalso see people who ignore our requests or refuse to cooperate, pretend that\nwe owe them something, insult us, and think they are entitled to all our work\nbecause it\u2019s all open source, so we have to resort to much more heavy-handed\nmeasures.\n\nLet me reiterate why we don't want people to distribute images under the VyOS\nname.\n\nNo matter who distributes them, \"VyOS\" is associated with us. So, if an\nunofficial image is broken or backdoored, our reputation is at risk. We cannot\ntake responsibility for the actions of random people, and we get to protect\nthe project's reputation because the trust of the Community rests upon it.\n\nThat problem would be solved if people did the right thing and replaced the\nname and the artwork. Just like with RedHat Enterprise Linux, Mozilla Firefox,\nand other projects, the name \"VyOS\" is a registered trademark and the artwork\nis not under a free license \u2014 that's the usual way to protect the project's\nreputation and many other open-source companies guard it a lot more\naggressively than we have done it so far.\n\nIf people replaced the branding and the name with something of their own, or\neven teamed up and started maintaining a \"CentOS of VyOS\", we'd have zero\nproblems with it. But we are still to see anyone do it, even though it's not\nthat hard to do \u2014 not more complex than it ever was to replace the RHEL\nbranding for CentOS or ScientificLinux.\n\nLast but not least, hosting and maintaining repositories in a way that keeps\nthem available on the web all the time is not free, and neither is the\nbandwidth used by image builds, especially cold builds made on GitHub Actions\nthat download the entire repository every time and don't cache packages. So,\nwhat is the benefit for the VyOS project? Does it facilitate contributions\nfrom the user base? The answer is no.\n\nThe era of the perpetually broken rolling release is long gone. Our test suite\nis not perfect, and we are constantly working to expand and improve it, but if\nan image doesn't boot or can't load a relatively wide selection of configs\nwith various features, it's not even published.\n\nWe know some of our customers use rolling releases in production for features\nthat still need to be added to an LTS branch. If it's good enough for them,\nit's certainly good enough for home and lab users.\n\nAll new changes to LTS releases also must go through the rolling release first\nand then be backported when they are proven stable, so having LTS access would\nonly facilitate the contribution of bug fixes unique to older LTS releases \u2014\nwe saw maybe a handful of pull requests of that nature in all time. And\nspeaking of which, let\u2019s objectively examine the state of our community...\n\n## Community\n\nWe love our Community, we are very grateful to all contributors who keep\nworking with us and customers who have stayed with us from the beginning, way\nbefore VyOS was recognized and became what it is today.\n\nContributors have had free-of-charge access to LTS images for a long time \u2014\nyou just need to participate continuously in the project, and we are happy to\nshare our work with you, just like you share your work with us. Customers have\naccess to fantastic software and can focus on their core business, and our\nteam is constantly trying to go beyond just simple support when it comes to\nbusiness needs. We are very proud of our VyOS for Good program, which brings\naccess to VyOS to various organizations, from schools, universities, and\nscientific labs to firefighters and rescue teams.\n\nBut how many contributors do we have? If you look at the GitHub stats, it's\neasy to see that most commits are made by people from the VyOS team (people\npaid by VyOS), with a small number of passionate community members. Then, we\nhad about 150 people who made a few PRs and disappeared. Only 867 people, at\nthe time of writing, bothered to click the \u201cstar\u201d button on the vyos-build\nrepository on GitHub (340 for vyos-1x). The number of people who made more\nthan ten(10) pull requests to our repositories in the ten years of project\nexistence is 52. Fifty two people in ten years. Let that sink in.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some other projects of similar age. OPNSense has twice as many\ncontributors and ten times as many stars. Hugo \u2014 a static site generator \u2014 has\n1500 contributors and 72k stars.\n\nThat's a Contributors Community.\n\nDon't get us wrong: we are grateful to everyone who contributes and will\ncontinue to share our work on LTS releases with them; we hope the numbers will\ngrow.\n\nBut let's not fool ourselves or allow ourselves to get fooled: easily\nbuildable LTS releases did not facilitate Contributor Community growth.\n\nEasily buildable rolling releases and LTS images for established contributors\nare not going anywhere \u2014 we want the project to be easy to contribute to, and\nwe want to reward those who work with us. But if you call yourself a community\nmember, you must put some effort into it \u2014 like we did and keep doing.\n\nThe post categories: community lts contributors\n\nShare:\n\n+\n\n### Subscribe to our Blog\n\n## Comments\n\n#### Jorge perez\n\n4/25/2024, 1:22:18 PM\n\nI didn't even know the star button existed, or what it was even for until this\npost.\n\n#### A\n\n4/25/2024, 1:56:11 PM\n\n\"Historically, we made building LTS releases exceptionally easy\" - You've made\nbuilding rolling releases easy, not LTS.\n\n\"we are unaware of any distro that would provide an equivalent of our make\niso.\" - Ubuntu has 'ubuntu-image', Debian has 'live-build', Alpine has\n'mkimage', openwrt is even easier, just to name a few. You can't possibly\nstate you are unaware of these distributions.\n\n\"Does it facilitate contributions from the user base? The answer is no.\" -\nI've personally contributed to the VyOS project because of the images on\nGitHub, since my number of contributions don't meet your expectations I have\nno other choice when I want a versioned release (which excludes rolling\nreleases). They also provide customizability that I won't be able to get from\nrolling releases, such as adding additional tooling. I would build them\nmyself, but why go through the bother when others that do exactly the same as\nI would have already done it (literally the essence of a open-source\ncommunity)?\n\n\"OPNSense has twice as many contributors and ten times as many stars\" - They\nalso provide their versioned releases for free to everyone. Same goes for\nHugo. And don't kid yourselves, VyOS is a niche product that very few people\nneed or have the patience to understand, while both of the two projects you\ncompare yourselves to are easy to use and get started with in comparison\n(point-and-click in particular for OPNSense, VyOS provides no GUI).\n\nIn essence, your handling of this particular issue, in particular refusing to\nacknowledge the fact that \"LTS\" images are not buildable and the ones that\nworked around that has been threatened with legal action, has alienated a\nwhole range of people that would gladly contribute or promote your product,\nbut are now migrating to one of your competitors, me included.\n\n#### Ganawa\n\n4/25/2024, 2:54:29 PM\n\n\"refusing to acknowledge the fact that \"LTS\" images are not buildable\"\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, you just build from the vyos-build repo and the\nbranches track the LTS release?\n\ngit clone -b sagitta --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build cd\nvyos-build sudo ./build-vyos-image iso --architecture amd64\n\n+\n\n### Subscribe Here!\n\n## Blog Categories\n\nRSS Freed\n\n  * 279Uncategorized\n  * 67announcement\n  * 46release\n  * 45vyos\n  * 341.2\n  * 34security\n  * 30development\n  * 30project updates\n  * 29maintenance\n  * 261.3\n  * 251.4\n  * 22news\n  * 19release candidate\n  * 15tutorial\n  * 14community\n  * 14lts\n  * 11documentation\n  * 10aws\n  * 10epa\n  * 10update\n  * 9announce\n  * 9commercial support\n  * 9ipsec\n  * 9vyos 2.0\n  * 8infrastructure\n  * 8misc\n  * 8vpn\n  * 8vyconf\n  * 7access subscriptions\n  * 7bgp\n  * 7commercial services\n  * 6downtime\n  * 5Maintenance Notification\n  * 5cloud\n  * 5hardware\n  * 5openvpn\n  * 5vyos project\n  * 41.5\n  * 4azure\n  * 4bug\n  * 4cli\n  * 4crux\n  * 4firewall\n  * 4holiday\n  * 4mirror\n  * 4rolling release\n  * 3api\n  * 3beta\n  * 3conference\n  * 3contributors\n  * 3donations\n  * 3frr\n  * 3gre\n  * 3meeting\n  * 3nat\n  * 3offtopic\n  * 3open-source\n  * 3poll\n  * 3scripting\n  * 3vyos foundation\n  * 2SeasonOfDocs\n  * 2amazon\n  * 2automation\n  * 2bigthanks\n  * 2certifications\n  * 2changes\n  * 2dns\n  * 2edgecore\n  * 2equuleus\n  * 2future\n  * 2governance\n  * 2high availability\n  * 2ipv6\n  * 2is-is\n  * 2lanner\n  * 2live stream\n  * 2microsoft\n  * 2migration scripts\n  * 2notification\n  * 2nutanix\n  * 2outage\n  * 2ova\n  * 2portal\n  * 2project insights\n  * 2sentrium\n  * 2snmp\n  * 2special offers\n  * 2survey\n  * 2talk\n  * 2telemetry\n  * 2thanksgiving\n  * 2ubiquiti\n  * 2vmware\n  * 2vrrp\n  * 2vulnerability\n  * 2wiki\n  * 12017\n  * 12020\n  * 12021\n  * 1UI\n  * 1Work\n  * 1as-path\n  * 1australia\n  * 1badges\n  * 1build system\n  * 1christmas\n  * 1controller\n  * 1covid-19\n  * 1cyber monday\n  * 1dellemc\n  * 1dmvpn\n  * 1dummy\n  * 1edgeos\n  * 1eol\n  * 1eos\n  * 1epic fail\n  * 1event\n  * 1evpn\n  * 1fosdem\n  * 1fud\n  * 1get paid\n  * 1giveaway\n  * 1greeting\n  * 1groups\n  * 1hcl\n  * 1hiring\n  * 1ideology\n  * 1ids\n  * 1incident\n  * 1ipip\n  * 1ips\n  * 1issue notification\n  * 1japan\n  * 1jobs\n  * 1kernel\n  * 1lab\n  * 1licensing\n  * 1look at the date\n  * 1look at the post date\n  * 1loopback\n  * 1macsec\n  * 1milestone\n  * 1monitoring\n  * 1mpls\n  * 1mwc\n  * 1mwc2024\n  * 1not-really\n  * 1note the date\n  * 1nutanix ahv\n  * 1opencollective\n  * 1openssl\n  * 1oracle\n  * 1ovf\n  * 1partnerships\n  * 1political statement\n  * 1pppoe\n  * 1private cloud\n  * 1python\n  * 1qos\n  * 1question\n  * 1radhat\n  * 1remote access\n  * 1resolved\n  * 1rewrite\n  * 1rip\n  * 1routing\n  * 1side-projects\n  * 1sit\n  * 1slack\n  * 1social media\n  * 1ssl\n  * 1statistics\n  * 1stoprussia\n  * 1technology exchange\n  * 1tunnel\n  * 1ukraine\n  * 1use cases\n  * 1usg\n  * 1vcne\n  * 1versioning\n  * 1vmworld\n  * 1vpp\n  * 1vrf\n  * 1vyos lab\n  * 1workaround\n  * 1xcp-ng\n\nSee All Categories\n\n", "frontpage": false}
