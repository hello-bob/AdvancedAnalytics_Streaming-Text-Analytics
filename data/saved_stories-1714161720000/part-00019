On Tuesday, by a 3-2 party-line vote, the agency\u2019s Democratic\nmajority decided to do just that.\n\nThough they\u2019ve long been called \u201cagreements,\u201d anyone who\u2019s ever had to sign\none knows that would-be employees seldom have any choice in the matter. You\nagree and get the job, or you don\u2019t and stay on the unemployment line. And,\noh, by the way, 30% to 40% of workers are required to sign non-competes after\nthey\u2019ve already accepted a job.\n\nThat\u2019s why labor unions, liberal think tanks, and millions of employees hate\nthem.\n\nYou might think non-competes are only an issue for top tech engineers,\nsoftware developers, and executives. Wrong \u2014 so, so wrong.\n\nSure, historically, companies used these agreements to lock down highly\nskilled workers and executives with access to trade secrets or proprietary\ninformation. But that hasn\u2019t been the case for decades. According to the\nEconomic Policy Institute, a third of companies now require all their workers\nto sign non-competes. That includes \u201cvalued\u201d employees such as hourly workers\nin minimum wage jobs doing janitorial duties or food service.\n\nCouldn\u2019t this be fought in the courts? Technically, sure it can. But as the\nTrembly law firm put it, \u201cNon-compete litigation is typically fast-paced and\nexpensive.\u201d The key word in that sentence is \u201cexpensive.\u201d If you\u2019re an\nemployee seeking to get free of a non-compete, unless the company you\u2019re\nmoving to will fight for you, you won\u2019t be able to afford the lawsuit.\n\nThe FTC argues that while requiring workers in low-end jobs to sign non-\ncompetes is an overstretch, valuable employees shouldn\u2019t be restricted either.\nAfter all, the agency claims, \u201cTrade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements\n(NDAs) both provide employers with well-established means to protect\nproprietary and other sensitive information. Researchers estimate that over\n95% of workers with a non-compete already have an NDA.\u201d\n\nIn addition, as FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said: \u201cNon-compete clauses keep wages\nlow, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism, including\nfrom the more than 8,500 new startups that would be created a year once non-\ncompetes are banned.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if the end of non-competes would do all that. But I do know that\nin the decades I\u2019ve been writing about technology, I\u2019ve seen non-competes\nbecome iron collars around the necks of tech\u2019s best and brightest workers,\nhelp desk staffers and even the people who keep the offices clean.\n\nI understand businesses want to reduce competition and prevent their workers\nfrom easily jumping ship, but I\u2019ve never thought non-compete agreements were\nthe right way to do so. Want to keep your best staffers? Pay them, let them\nwork from home, and give them a pathway to promotion. This isn\u2019t rocket\nscience.\n\nNevertheless, my attorney friends tell me that their corporate employers or\nclients had fits when word of the FTC ruling came out. You would have thought\na lightning bolt had fried their stock prices out of the blue sky.\n\nReally? While I was surprised by the FTC action, anyone who\u2019s been paying\nattention knew that non-compete agreements were getting walloped left, right,\nand sideways.\n\nTrue, as Republican Commissioner Andrew Ferguson said, the ruling \u201cnullifies\nmore than 30 million existing contracts and forecloses tens of millions of\nfuture contracts.\u201d That\u2019s a big deal. But, again, the writing was on the wall.\n\nThat\u2019s why, while way too many CEOs are having conniptions at the moment,\nbusiness and law-savvy groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce immediately\nsued the FTC, seeking to overturn the decision. They were ready.\n\nTheir lawyers are arguing that the ban applies to a host of contracts that\ncould not harm competition in any way. Besides, the FTC didn\u2019t have the power\nto issue such a ban. And, in any case, such a categorical ban wasn\u2019t legal.\nThose are the arguments, at least.\n\nWho\u2019s right? Who\u2019s wrong? Stick around and find out. I have every expectation\nthat this will grind its way through the court system all the way to the\nSupreme Court sometime in the late 2020s. (I expect, by the way, that the\nissue that will decide the case won\u2019t have anything directly to do with the\nFTC\u2019s ruling; it\u2019ll revolve around whether the FTC has the power to make such\na fundamental legal policy change.)\n\nIn the meantime, you have about four months to decide what to do about your\nnon-compete agreements before the FTC ruling goes into effect. Once it hits,\nall existing non-compete agreements will be nullified, except for those\napplying to executives in \u201cpolicy-making positions\u201d who make at least $151,164\na year. And the ruling won\u2019t let your company impose any new non-competes,\neven on executives.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d dump any non-compete agreements immediately and rewrite my\nemployment contracts to use NDAs and trade secrets in their place. No matter\nwhat the courts decide, employees hate non-compete agreements \u2014 that won\u2019t\nchange.\n\nAnd what does all this mean for top tech talent that\u2019s been feeling trapped?\nIt\u2019s time to talk to your bosses about whether they really want to keep you\naround and explain that the carrot of a better deal will be a whole lot\nsweeter than the threat of a non-compete clause. If they don\u2019t hear you? Get\nready to walk. The doors are opening.\n\n## Related content\n\n  * news analysis\n\n#### Google can\u2019t seem to quit cookies, delays killing them again\n\nGoogle cited regulatory challenges in its oft-delayed plans to phase out\nthird-party cookies from its Chromium products.
