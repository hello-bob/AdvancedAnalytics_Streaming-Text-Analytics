In her household,\ncountry participles like \u201cbrang\u201d were tantamount to slurs. I was a soft boy\nwho spent most of my time indoors, leafing through Mom\u2019s glossy magazines or\nchoreographing dances with my sister to the theme song of \u201cThree\u2019s Company.\u201d\nWell-meaning adults pushed me toward an array of alternative activities:\nsports of all kinds, hunting, shooting guns, driving A.T.V.s. As it turned\nout, I was totally lacking whatever instinct propelled other little boys\ntoward breaking rules and bones. Instead, I ended up engaged in the most\nperilous sport of all: being a pansy in rural America. At home and at school,\nI racked up quite the list of nicknames, including crybaby, sissy, fairy,\nor\u2014as I was known to telemarketers who called on the landline\u2014\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d\n\nMy only exposure to stereotypically masculine pursuits came from my mom\u2019s\nbrother, my Uncle John. He would arrive at the house with little notice,\nwearing hiking boots and a short-sleeved shirt with sunglasses tucked into the\nfront pocket. He was unusually tall for a Hernandez sibling, just over six\nfeet, with salt-and-pepper hair. My sister and I would put on sneakers and\nfollow him to his pickup truck and the adventures, for better or for worse,\nwould begin. \u201cIf you fall, fall to the left!\u201d he would shout, as we teetered\nacross a concrete dam in a wildlife refuge, with water on one side of us and a\nlong fall on the other. \u201cDon\u2019t make any sudden moves!\u201d he\u2019d command, when a\nherd of bison set upon his truck as my sister and I clung to each other in the\nopen bed. \u201cEh, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d he\u2019d say later, sitting at Braum\u2019s, the ice-\ncream place where all excursions ended, as blood seeped from a gash in his\nleg.\n\nThe Food Scene\n\nSign up to get Helen Rosner\u2019s weekly newsletter on what, where, and how to\neat.\n\nJohn was an avid and eccentric interpreter of country customs. He enjoyed\ncommitting asymmetrical warfare against the squirrels and grasshoppers who\nravaged his garden; he would sometimes decapitate the insects and mount their\nheads atop his fence. (He did not, thank God, try this with the squirrels.)\nEach Christmas, he\u2019d gift us decorative gourds that he\u2019d painted himself,\ninlaid with delicate pine-needle stitching that he\u2019d done while watching\nbasketball on TV. He was the darkest-skinned sibling in the family and enjoyed\nmaking people squirm by referring to himself and his wife, my aunt Pat, as\n\u201cchocolate and vanilla.\u201d\n\nFew events combined John\u2019s interests in the natural world, craftsmanship, and\ndanger like the annual Rattlesnake Festival, held in the nearby town of\nApache. The spring I was nine, he took my sister and me. There were some\nperfunctory carnival rides\u2014runtish roller coasters and a swinging Viking\nship\u2014as well as a competition for the best-dressed cowboy and cowgirl. But\nthese were hardly the main draw. For fans of the Western diamondback\nrattlesnake, this was Woodstock. Craft booths sold snakeskin boots, saddles,\nwallets, and belts. Uncle John bought me a keychain fashioned out of a\nrattlesnake head, which seemed to both of us the height of fashion. The star\nattraction was the so-called snake pit, inside an old saloon, where the\ncreatures were exhibited before being skinned.\n\n\u201cLIVE RATTLERS,\u201d a sign on the door promised. Behind a fenced-off area, a\nstubbled cowboy in rubber boots and denim stood in the center of a slithering\nheap, like a redneck Saint George and the Dragon. In his craggy hands he held\na snake out for the crowd to admire. It flicked its tongue, curving its body\ninto a muscular \u201cS.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter this, we\u2019ll eat one,\u201d Uncle John told us.\n\n\u201cA rattlesnake?\u201d It was as though he\u2019d proposed feasting on flamingo meat, or\nroasted kindergartner.\n\nLike many proud Americans, Oklahomans excel at deep-frying everything from\nchicken to Oreos. The state fair, in Oklahoma City, even claims to have\ndiscovered a way to fry coffee. We left the snake pit and passed food trucks\ncrowded with less adventurous patrons buying funnel cakes and corn dogs, until\nwe came to a booth called the Fried Snake Shack. An aproned attendant\nproffered little paper boats filled with what at first looked like fried\ncatfish tenders, battered and golden brown. But a closer inspection revealed\nevidence of an unfamiliar, sinuous anatomy, which I tried to push from my mind\nas I took my first bite.\n\n\u201cHow does it taste?\u201d Uncle John asked. The meat was stringy and full of small\nbones. The taste was hard to detect given the ratio of paltry meat to crispy\ncoating.\n\n\u201cLike chicken,\u201d I remember I said, trying to impress him with my nonchalance.\n\nThe Western diamondback rattlesnake is among the most dangerous snakes in the\nUnited States. Named for the signature zigzag pattern of its skin, it is\naggressive and known to stand its ground against predators and intruders. It\ncan detect body heat and has excellent aim. Its venom is hemotoxic, attacking\nthe blood. In some sense, though, the creature could be considered unusually\ngracious. Its rattle serves as an audible warning system. Anyone seeking to\nhandle a rattlesnake must brazenly disregard this evolutionary \u201cfuck off\u201d\nfeature, and for what? As Anthony Felder, Jr., an Oklahoma rattlesnake\nwrangler who was hospitalized with bites on three separate occasions before\nbeing fatally bitten, in 2016, aptly summed it up, \u201cI jumped out of a\nperfectly good airplane once, so why wouldn\u2019t I play with rattlesnakes?\u201d\n\nApache isn\u2019t the only Oklahoma town to host a rattlesnake festival. In\nWaynoka, an area near the panhandle that\u2019s mysterious even to Okies, the snake\npit is known as \u201cthe Den of Death.\u201d The town of Okeene touts itself as the\noriginator of the so-called rattlesnake roundup, the name of the hunting\nevents where snakes are collected. The roundups began as a way for ranchers to\nprotect their cattle. They would go out, shoot as many rattlesnakes as they\ncould, then nail the limp bodies to the sides of their wagons and roll into\ntown to display their spoils. In Sweetwater, Texas, where the largest annual\nrattlesnake roundup is held today, amateurs can join in the hunts for a small\nfee.\n\nI\u2019d grown up around cowhands, hunters, and farmers, whose unflappable\ncompetence seemed always to rest on a pragmatic approach to the animals they\ndealt with. Mating season, birthing season, and hunting season were dictated\nby the dispassionate rhythms of the natural world. Rattlesnake hunting, in\ncontrast, astounded me with its total lack of utility. Despite decades of\nroundups, the snake population remains substantial, and, besides, snake\nattacks aren\u2019t common or fatal enough to warrant yearly culls. The creatures\ncertainly don\u2019t provide much in the way of nourishment. Even the scrawniest\nbirds offer different cuts of meat to choose from, whereas the meat of a\nrattlesnake is confined to a single, skinny loin running down either side of\nthe spine. The extremities of the creature are dramatically inedible, the\nrattle being made of keratin, the same material as human fingernails, and the\nhead being where the venom is stored. Hunting them, handling them, eating\nthem: it was all pure theatre, a rugged and risky masculine burlesque. The\nmeat was a trophy, edible proof that you\u2019d been willing to tangle with death.\n\nThis might be why rattlesnake hunters, when asked about the meat\u2019s flavor,\ntend to insist, a bit defensively, that, no, it\u2019s nothing like chicken at all.\n\u201cIt tastes like snake,\u201d they\u2019ll say.\n\nI can\u2019t deny my attraction to the ideal of the Oklahoma man\u2014a bit reckless but\nrelentlessly capable, always ready to test himself against nature\u2019s hostile\nterrain. The first local boy I fell for was a high-school classmate whom I\u2019ll\ncall Corey. During the summer before junior year, Corey found God, and he\nreturned to school a proselytizer. Where he\u2019d once swaggered through the\nhalls, chest puffed, cheeks red, a haughty curl in his lower lip, he now\nseemed determined to convey an air of approachability. \u201cYo, what\u2019s your\nrelationship with Christ like?\u201d he\u2019d asked me, extending an invitation to\nchurch.\n\nCorey\u2019s congregation was Pentecostal, which, though bewildering to my Catholic\nsensibilities, wasn\u2019t the wackiest flavor of Protestant that Oklahoma had to\noffer. (For one thing, unlike some Pentecostal churches in Appalachia, the\nones in my vicinity involved no rattlesnakes.) Still, going to a megachurch at\nthe edge of town to hear my classmates speak in tongues sounded deeply\nunappealing. I told Corey that I wouldn\u2019t go to services but that I would meet\nhim for lunch instead.\n\nSoon enough, we\u2019d established a daily routine. Corey would drive the two of us\nto a gas station, where we\u2019d pick up hotdogs. Then we\u2019d sit in the parking lot\nin his car, eating and fighting about God. When we grew bored of this, we\u2019d go\nto Corey\u2019s place, where our pursuits were considerably less theological. We\u2019d\nplay video games while dutifully ignoring his dad\u2019s angry stomping fits\nthrough the house. Whenever Corey and I were alone in a room, we\u2019d close the\ndoor, lock it behind us, strip down, and \u201cwrestle.\u201d Then, in breathy\ninterludes between bouts, we would jerk each other off.\n\nIt was a meagre form of intimacy, but I didn\u2019t dare ask for more. The idea of\nbeing openly gay was unfathomable to either of us. In middle school, I\u2019d\nprobably heard \u201cfaggot\u201d more than my own name. I would hide out in the empty\nauditorium during lunch hour, to avoid a group of boys who\u2019d made it a habit\nof tormenting me. I learned that gay people were targets who existed to be\nmocked and condemned, that \u201csmearing the queer,\u201d in the slang parlance of\nbullies, was another way for guys to prove their manhood. I intended to remain\nas unobtrusive as possible until I got out of Oklahoma, assuming that I ever\ndid. Corey, for his part, told me that he wanted to be \u201cnormal\u201d and was\npursuing relationships with girls.\n\nAfter high school, I moved an hour and a half away, to the city of Norman, to\nattend the University of Oklahoma, but I made regular trips home, where Corey\nhad stayed for college. During one such visit, the two of us went for a hike\nnear Elk Mountain, a popular spot in the wildlife refuge close to my parents\u2019\nhouse. On the trail, we happened upon a mass of reddish-brown fur, which poked\nup its head and looked at us with bulbous eyes: a baby bison. There are around\nsix hundred and fifty bison in the refuge. Their enormous turds loom on the\ntrails as fragrant reminders that they are the largest land mammals in North\nAmerica. Tourists pull over to the side of the road to take the bisons\u2019\npictures, but it is risky to get too close. Corey and I had both grown up\nhearing stories of students who bragged about touching a bison on the head, as\nwell as urban legends of kids who\u2019d been gored to death doing so.\n\n\u201cBro!\u201d was all Corey had time to say before a mother bison hurtled out of the\nbrush. We flung ourselves down the mountainside, half running and half\ntumbling, rocks and branches scratching us as we descended. By the time we\nstopped and dusted ourselves off, we realized we\u2019d lost the trail.\n\nWe wandered around looking for it, to no avail. After a couple of hours, I\ngrew nervous. People wouldn\u2019t realize that we were missing until nighttime.\n\n\u201cCorey,\u201d I said. \u201cWe need to call the rangers.\u201d My own phone was dead, so we\u2019d\nneed to use his.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said, picking his way through the brush. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lost.\u201d\n\nAll of a sudden, I heard a rattling sound and looked down to see a tight coil\nby my hiking boot: a beautiful diamond pattern, a flickering tongue, a\nvibrating tail.\n\nI\u2019d seen rattlesnakes before in the wild. Once, when my sister and I were\nlittle, one threatened us in the garden, until Abuelo retrieved a rusty shovel\nfrom the garage and decapitated the creature with one mighty stroke. \u201cWatch\nout for snakes,\u201d we\u2019d always tell each other before going on hikes, as a way\nof saying \u201ctravel safe.\u201d But this was the first time I\u2019d encountered a rattler\non my own.\n\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Corey said. \u201cStay calm. Back up nice and slow.\u201d\n\nThe snake struck at me. I saw the plush pink insides of its mouth, the twin\nneedles of its fangs extended in my direction. Its eyes were set into a\nfurious expression in its dart-shaped head. I waited to feel a puncture on my\nleg, followed by a fire under my skin. But I felt nothing; it hadn\u2019t bitten\nme. The snake reared back again, still in striking position. I walked backward\nslowly until I was well out of its reach.\n\n\u201cWe need to call the rangers,\u201d I told Corey again, allowing anger into my\nvoice. \u201cRight now.\u201d\n\nHe pulled out his phone but hesitated. \u201cNah, man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nOne stereotype about men is that they don\u2019t know how to ask for directions.\nWas Corey just ashamed of needing help, or was he ashamed of us? Our\nrelationship was predicated upon secrecy. Our domain was lonely car rides and\nlocked rooms. Would calling the rangers, and getting rescued, be a way of\noutting ourselves in his mind?\n\nOrdinarily, I\u2019d have capitulated to Corey\u2019s wishes. Now I took advantage of\nthe adrenaline slamming through my body. I snatched his phone from his hand\nand called the rangers myself. A kind woman answered and directed us toward a\nvalley, which led to a clearing, and then to the parking lot, where she met us\nto make sure that we weren\u2019t too dehydrated to drive ourselves home.\n\nThat night, I didn\u2019t sleep. I couldn\u2019t silence the rattling in my head, or the\nphantom sensation of bites all over my body, the feeling that I was being\neaten alive. I got up, took my car keys off their hook, and went for an\naimless drive toward West Texas on Route 62. A rosy hue was already creeping\ninto the night sky as the sun rose over the Wichita Mountains. The open road\nseemed infinite. I felt as if there was nowhere I couldn\u2019t go, as if there was\nno danger I couldn\u2019t overcome. I suppose I felt like a man.\n\nRecently, I reverse-engineered my own little rattlesnake roundup, which is to\nsay that I went online and purchased a box of rattlesnake meat for delivery to\nmy apartment, in Brooklyn. My purveyor was a Web site called Exotic Meat\nMarket, which also offers such unsettling delicacies as alpaca, zebra, and\niguana meat. After placing my order, I cleared my computer\u2019s browser history,\nvaguely fearing that I might otherwise end up on some sort of government list\nof deviants.\n\n\u201cIf the box shakes or rattles, don\u2019t open it,\u201d my friend Stephen teased. He\nand I, along with his boyfriend, Dan, would be eating the snake together, as\nan exercise in cultural enrichment. My friend Adam, a talented home cook, had\nagreed to prepare it.\n\nWhen the package arrived, I opened it and took a picture of the vacuum-sealed\nspiral of frozen meat inside. I showed it to my friends, my barber, my\nbarista. I was pleased to elicit from others the same mix of sentiments that\nrattlesnakes had once inspired in me: curiosity, fear, revulsion, a sideways\nattraction. Perhaps I was feeling the same thrill that Uncle John, who still\nlives by the mountains, had felt taking me to the festival all those years\nago.\n\nOn the appointed snake-eating day, my friends and I gathered in Adam\u2019s\napartment, in Crown Heights. A YouTube tutorial by a mustachioed Oklahoman who\ngoes by Cowboy Kent Rollins instructed us on how to cook the meat. In the\nvideo, Rollins stood in the sunshine in front of an uncovered wagon, an\nAmerican flag swaying gently in the breeze. A wooden table was cluttered with\nthe relevant ingredients. \u201cYou better put on your snake boots before you come\ninto camp for this episode,\u201d he told the camera.\n\nCowboy Kent had hunted the snake himself. The video showed him driving to his\nson\u2019s house, where a large rattler had been spotted in the yard. It hissed as\nhe scooped it up with a garden hoe. After beheading it offscreen, he skinned\nit by hand, in one effortless stroke. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like pulling off a pair of\nsocks,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cYou just get \u2019er done.\u201d He cut a slit down the\nsnake\u2019s belly and scraped out its guts. Watching him work, I felt a small\nsurge of pride for my home state.\n\nAll through the peculiar dinner party that followed, in fact, I experienced a\nstrange satisfaction. For a long time, I treated Oklahoma like an embarrassing\nrelative. I wanted to put as much distance as possible between myself and my\nhome town. I still sometimes wonder what it would have been like to grow up\nsomewhere less hazardous to gay boys. But as I\u2019ve grown older I\u2019ve developed\nan affection for Oklahoma that stems, I think, from having survived it.\n\nAdam defrosted the meat, which unfurled into a pale, fleshy rope. He chopped\nit into pieces, cutting right through the spine each time with a gnarly crack.\nHe soaked the chunks in buttermilk\u2014Cowboy Kent said that the acid would help\ntenderize the meat\u2014then breaded it with a mixture of flour, cornmeal, paprika,\nand cayenne, which I liked to think would return to the snake some of its lost\nbite. Adam heated canola oil in a Dutch oven and dropped four pieces in. They\nhissed.\n\n\u201cSounds like a snake!\u201d I said proudly.\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Stephen said.\n\nSoon, Adam plucked the crispy, golden pieces out of the pot with tongs and set\nthem on a napkin to drain any excess oil. They looked appetizing, like they\nwouldn\u2019t have been out of place in a bucket of KFC. Once they\u2019d cooled, we\ngathered round the table and ventured a bite.\n\nAs usual, the taste was difficult to place, distant, the texture dominated by\nbones and breading. Finally, Dan blurted out, \u201cThere\u2019s no meat! If you were\ntrying to feed your family, they\u2019d starve.\u201d Dan was the newcomer of the group,\nand he reminded me, in a way, of the men back home. He was stoic, blunt, and a\nfellow Mexican American. Like Uncle John, he enjoyed playing the affable\nprovocateur. I tried to explain that eating snake was never really about\nsustenance, but it felt a bit like spelling out an inside joke.\n\nThere was a buzzing at the door: a supplemental pizza delivery. \u201cThank God,\u201d\nAdam said. But he kindly cooked me four more pieces of rattlesnake and packed\nthem into a to-go box with a plastic window in the top. On the cab ride back\nto my apartment, I eyed the snake guiltily, knowing that I wouldn\u2019t be eating\nit.\n\n\u201cSome real sexy Spanish girls around here,\u201d the driver said to me, as we made\nour way through Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cTotally,\u201d I agreed. \u2666\n\n## The 2024 Food Issue\n\nA digital-only issue about the culinary world.\n\n  * Why you can\u2019t get a restaurant reservation.\n\n  * Padma Lakshmi walks into a bar.\n\n  * The most treasured jar in Ina Garten\u2019s pantry.\n\n  * The kitchen guides that New Yorker writers and editors can\u2019t do without.\n\n  * Photo Booth: When babies rule the dinner table.\n\n  * A crossword puzzle for foodies.\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nJohn Paul Brammer is a writer and illustrator and the author of the book\n\u201c\u00a1Hola Papi!,\u201d based on his advice column of the same name.\n\nMore:SnakesMeatMasculinity\n\n### Goings On\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching, listening to, and doing this week, online, in N.Y.C., and\nbeyond.
