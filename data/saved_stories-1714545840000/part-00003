From a report: The justices turned away a request made by the\nFree Speech Coalition, a pornography industry trade group, as well as several\ncompanies. The challengers said the 2023 law violates the Constitution's First\nAmendment by requiring anyone using the platforms in question, including\nadults, to submit personal information.\n\nOne provision of the law, known as H.B. 1181, mandates that platforms verify\nusers' ages by requiring them to submit information about their identities.\nAlthough the law is aimed at limiting children's access to sexually explicit\ncontent, the lawsuit focuses on how those measures also affect adults.\n\"Specifically, the act requires adults to comply with intrusive age\nverification measures that mandate the submission of personally identifying\ninformation over the internet in order to access websites containing sensitive\nand intimate content,\" the challengers wrote in court papers.\n\n### \u2190\n\n### You may like to read:\n\n### \u2192\n\nHow an Empty S3 Bucket Can Make Your AWS Bill Explode\n\n## Frozen Embryos Are 'Children,' According To Alabama's Supreme Court\n\n## Teenagers Have Bought 'Ghost Guns' Online, Sometimes with Deadly\nConsequences\n\n## Iowa School District Is Using AI To Ban Books\n\n## US Supreme Court Rejects US Student Loan Relief.
