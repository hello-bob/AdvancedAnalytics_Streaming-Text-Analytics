The presence of Iranian drones\nin the country has been reported by Sudanese media and others.\n\nThe senior Sudanese army source denied that the Iranian-made drones came\ndirectly from Iran, and declined to say how they were procured or how many the\narmy had received. Sudan's army had also developed Iranian drones previously\nproduced under joint military programmes before the two countries cut ties in\n2016, he added, without giving details. Details about the drones could not be\nconfirmed independently.\n\nThe source said that while diplomatic cooperation between Sudan and Iran had\nbeen restored last year, official military cooperation was still pending.\n\nA satellite image shows what analysts said was a Boeing 747 at Port Sudan airport, Sudan, on Dec. 7, 2023. | Planet Labs PBC / Handout via REUTERS\n\nAsked about Iranian drones, Sudan's acting foreign minister Ali Sadeq, who\nvisited Iran last year and is aligned with the army, said, \"Sudan did not\nobtain any weapons from Iran.\" The army's media department and Iran's foreign\nministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe RSF acknowledged it had suffered setbacks in Omdurman. Its media office\nsaid the army had received Iranian drones and other weapons, citing\nintelligence it had gathered. It did not respond to requests to provide\nevidence.\n\nTehran's backing for Sudan's army is aimed at strengthening ties with the\nstrategically located country, the Iranian and regional sources said. Sudan\nlies on the coast of the Red Sea, a key site of competition between global\npowers \u2014 including Iran \u2014 as war rages in the Middle East. From the other side\nof the Red Sea, Yemen's Houthis, armed in part by Iran, have launched attacks\nin support of Hamas in Gaza.\n\n\"What does Iran get in return? They now have a staging post on the Red Sea and\non the African side,\" said a Western diplomat, who asked not to be named.\n\nRecent territorial advances are the most significant for the army since the\nfighting began in Sudan's capital last April. The war, between army head Gen.\nAbdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF head Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has pushed\nmillions into extreme hunger, created the world's largest displacement crisis,\nand triggered waves of ethnically driven killings and sexual violence in the\nDarfur region of western Sudan.\n\nA Sudanese family who fled the conflict in Sudan with their belongings after crossing the border between Sudan and Chad in July 2023 | REUTERS\n\nU.N. experts have said the RSF war effort has been aided by backing via\nneighboring African states including Chad, Libya and South Sudan, and that\nallegations of material support from the United Arab Emirates to the RSF were\ncredible.\n\nThe army's success in Omdurman allowed it from February to pursue similar\nattacks using drones, artillery and troops in Bahri, north of Khartoum, to try\nto take control of the key Al Jaili oil refinery, two witnesses there said.\n\nThe army has said that its recent gains have also been helped by recruitment\nof thousands of volunteers in the areas it controls, taking place over more\nthan six months and accelerating since December.\n\nCooperation between Sudan and Iran was strong under former President Omar al-\nBashir, until he turned to Iran's Gulf rivals for economic support late in his\nthree-decade rule and cut relations with Tehran.\n\nAmin Mazajoub, a former Sudanese general, said Sudan had previously\nmanufactured weapons with the help of Iran, and had repurposed drones already\nin its possession to make them more effective during the war. Mazajoub did not\nspecifically comment on the source of the drones recently used in combat.\n\nA regional source close to Iran's clerical rulers said Iranian Mohajer and\nAbabil drones had been transported to Sudan several times since late last year\nby Iran's Qeshm Fars Air. Mohajer and Ababil drones are made by companies\noperating under Iran's defense ministry, which did not immediately respond to\na request for comment.\n\nFlight tracking records collated by Wim Zwijnenburg of Dutch peace\norganization Pax show that in December 2023 and January 2024 a Boeing 747-200\ncargo plane operated by Qeshm Fars Air made six journeys from Iran to Port\nSudan, an important base for the army since the RSF took over strategic sites\nin Khartoum in the first days of the war.\n\nKhartoum, Sudan, in April 2023 | AFP/Getty Images via Bloomberg\n\nThe frequency of these flights has not been previously reported. Emails and\nphone calls to Qeshm Fars Air, which is under U.S. sanctions, went unanswered.\nWhether the details listed for the airline were up to date could not be\nestablished.\n\nA photo provided by satellite imaging company Planet Labs, for which the\nlocation and date could be verified, shows a Boeing 747 with the wingspan\nconsistent with a 747-200 at Port Sudan airport on Dec. 7, the date of the\nfirst of the tracked flights, Zwijnenburg said.\n\nA Mohajer-6 appeared in January on the runway at the Wadi Sayidna base in\nanother satellite photograph dated Jan. 9, Zwijnenburg said.\n\nThe RSF said the army was receiving twice-weekly cargo plane deliveries of\nIranian drones and other arms from Iran. RSF intelligence showed deliveries of\nIranian Mohajer-4, Mohajer-6 and Ababil drones to Port Sudan, it said, adding\nthat it had shot down several of the drones. The RSF did not provide evidence\nfor the drone deliveries.\n\nSourcing weapons from Iran could complicate relations for the Sudanese\nmilitary with the United States, which is leading a push for negotiations\nbetween the warring parties.\n\nU.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello said in an interview Wednesday that\nfear of greater influence for Iran or Islamic extremist elements in Sudan was\none reason the U.S. believed there was momentum for a peace deal.\n\nA U.S. State Department spokesperson said the U.S. had seen the reports on\nIranian support for the army and was monitoring the situation.\n\n\"The United States opposes external involvement to support the Sudan conflict\n\u2014 it will only exacerbate and prolong the conflict and risks further spreading\nregional instability,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nIran(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/iran),\ndrones(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/drones),\nSudan(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/sudan)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
