The\nphotopolarimetry is one of eleven science experiments conducted by the Voyager\nspacecraft and is designed to detect surface and atmospheric chemicals on\nJupiter and Saturn and their moons.\n\nData was received from an identical instrument aboard Voyager 2 during its\nflyby of Jupiter last July 9.\n\nThe two Voyagers, which were launched in the summer of 1977, sent to Earth\nthousands of brilliant TV photos and made major new discoveries about Jupiter\nand its four large moons.\n\nBoth spacecraft are operating normally in their cruise to Saturn. Voyager 1\nwill reach Saturn next November 12 and Voyager 2, on August 25, 1981.\n\nReturn to top\n\n### The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of\nhumanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\n  * About NASA's Mission\n\nJoin Us\n\n  * Home\n  * News & Events\n  * Multimedia\n  * NASA+\n  * Missions\n  * Humans in Space\n  * Earth & Climate\n  * The Solar System\n  * The Universe\n  * Science\n  * Aeronautics\n  * Technology\n  * Learning Resources\n  * About NASA\n  * NASA en Espa\u00f1ol\n\n### Follow NASA\n\n  * More NASA Social Accounts\n  * NASA Newsletters\n\n  * Sitemap\n  * For Media\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * FOIA\n  * No FEAR Act\n  * Office of the IG\n  * Budget & Annual Reports\n  * Agency Financial Reports\n  * Contact NASA\n  * Accessibility\n\n  * Page Last Updated:\n\n2 days ago\n\n  * Page Editor:\n\nSMD Content Editors\n\n  * Responsible NASA Official for Science:\n\nDana Bolles\n\n", "frontpage": false}
