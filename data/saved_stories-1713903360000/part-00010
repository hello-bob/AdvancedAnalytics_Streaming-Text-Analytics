It looks like someone built an evangelical mega-\nchurch in a residential neighborhood and then tried to turn it into a single-\nfamily home by putting in cheap windows and scallop vinyl shingles.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe me that it\u2019s ugly, here is proof: In one of the hottest\nhousing markets in recent history, it was on the market for nine months before\nwe made a lowball offer in early 2023.\n\nThere are many good things about it: it\u2019s spacious, well-located, full of\nlight, and it didn\u2019t need a whole lot of work. Still, when a friend recently\nasked me if it was my \u201cforever home,\u201d I got a pit of anxiety in my stomach.\nLive in the mega-church? Forever? How could I? But in this housing market, how\ncould I afford to move anywhere else?\n\nThe concept of the \u201cforever home\u201d has become extremely popular in the last 15\nyears or so\u2014even before the rise of the HGTV show, Property Brothers: Forever\nHome. The idea is that this is the home you\u2019ll raise your children in, one\nthat\u2019s either perfect or that you will spend a lot of money on to make\nperfect, one that will fulfill all your hopes and dreams. It is the opposite\nof a \u201cstarter home,\u201d which may not exist anymore in today\u2019s real-estate\nmarket, and is sometimes interchangeable with a \u201cdream home.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively new concept. The term was barely used until the mid-2000s,\naccording to Google\u2019s Ngram, which searches how many times a phrase is found\nin printed sources. References to the \u201cforever home\u201d started increasing\nexponentially in 2010, and today the term is ubiquitous \u2014it was used 5,630\ntimes in U.S. for-sale listings in January, according to a Zillow analysis.\n\nThe spike in its use traces to a time when the U.S. economy was still emerging\nfrom the Great Recession. The housing market was in rough shape, with fewer\nhomes being sold and prices still declining. The term \u201cforever home\u201d may have\ngained popularity among real-estate agents as a way to convince people that\nthe resale value of a house didn\u2019t necessarily matter, says Matthew Lasner, a\nhistorian of the built environment who is a professor at Hunter College. \u201cI\nthink it is about convincing people that at a time of low underwater prices,\ncrazy high prices, or wildly fluctuating prices\u2014all of which we\u2019ve seen in the\npast 15 years\u2014it still makes sense to buy \u2018now,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nAfter all, the big reason many Americans have bought a home in the last 50\nyears is because they saw it as a good investment. You could get a government-\nbacked mortgage, favorable tax treatment, and sit back as your house grew in\nvalue. Homeownership, the saying goes, is the best way to create generational\nwealth in America. But that wasn\u2019t the case in the years between 2007 and\n2011, when prices actually fell\u2014and when the term \u201cforever home\u201d began taking\noff.\n\nThe idea of not worrying too much about the resale value of a house probably\nmade sense in 2010. There was no way to know where the market was going, and\nthere were other factors that were more important than resale value at the\ntime, says Lasner. If people liked the house, the neighborhood, and could\nafford it, they could think of their house as a \u201cforever home,\u201d and not dwell\ntoo much on whether the market was going to continue tanking.\n\nBut thinking of houses as \u201cforever homes\u201d has become much less useful since\n2020, as prices have skyrocketed and housing inventory disappeared. If, in\n2010, it was a way to reassure people who were buying a house in an\nunpredictable market, it\u2019s since morphed into a way to goad people into trying\nto find a \u201cperfect\u201d home\u2014and spend more money than they should on it. The idea\nof finding your \u201cforever home\u201d puts into conflict two glaring realities of\nAmerican housing today: there is a vast shortage of housing right now, and\nstill people tie much of their self-worth to what their house looks like.\n\nConstruction for single-family homes slowed significantly after the Great\nRecession, and there are about 7.2 million fewer homes than are needed in\nAmerica today. This shortage is causing prices to climb at a time of rising\ninterest rates, which means people are having to pay more for less.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much information out there as far as what a perfect house looks\nlike, everyone thinks they deserve one,\u201d says Liz Brown, a Virginia realtor\nwho says that she has to constantly lower clients\u2019 expectations when they\nfirst start shopping. It might have been a little easier to find a \u201cperfect\u201d\nhouse in, say, 2017, Brown says, when she could show clients 30 houses in\ntheir price range and they would have liked 10. Now, she says, there\u2019s nothing\nto even look at, and when a great home pops up, it\u2019s gone in a day to someone\npaying cash.\n\nClients tell Brown they want to buy a home and raise their kids in it, just\nlike their parents did, she says, without realizing how much harder that is\nright now. In 2022, the median sale price for a single-family home was 5.6\ntimes higher than the median household income, higher than any point on record\ndating back to the 1970s, according to a 2024 report from the Harvard Joint\nCenter for Housing Studies. Still, Brown says, her clients are hesitant to\nplan to live in a house for only 3 to 5 years and then sell it and move\non\u2014perhaps because anyone who waited to buy a house until after 2020 has\nlearned just how high prices or interest rates can suddenly go, pricing them\nout of the market.\n\nAs a result, people are moving less and less. In December 2023, the average\nAmerican homeowner had lived in their house for 11.9 years, up from 6.5 years\nin December 2005, according to data crunched by the home-listings site Redfin.\nThis is partly because nearly two-thirds of Americans have a sub-4% mortgage\nrate and don\u2019t want to lose it. But even before rates plummeted to historic\nlows, Americans had been moving less than they used to. From 1945 to 1990,\nroughly 15% to 20% of Americans moved every year. That share has been steadily\ndeclining every year since, and now stands at around 10%.\n\nI\u2019m not arguing that the only reason Americans don\u2019t move is because they\u2019re\nholding out for their forever home, but searching for perfection certainly\ndoesn\u2019t help. A survey commissioned by the moving company Mayflower in 2022\nfound that 81% of people said that finding their \u201cperfect forever home\u201d was\nthe most important factor in deciding to buy.\n\nWhen housing prices make up such a large share of Americans\u2019 income, it\u2019s hard\nto blame people for wanting to put all their money into something \u201cperfect.\u201d\nThe rise of HGTV and Instagram have shown us what beautiful homes can look\nlike\u2014and make it seem like you can turn an ugly house into a dream home in the\ncourse of 30 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s about the photographic nature of culture in the\nage of the Internet,\u201d says Lasner, the Hunter College professor.\n\nReal estate didn\u2019t used to be so visual. It wasn\u2019t until the Great Recession\nthat agents began to frequently \u201cstage\u201d houses to sell them, replacing the\nowners\u2019 belongings and decorations with stuff that can help potential sellers\nenvision themselves living there, Lasner says. \u201cIf your parents bought a house\nin the 1980s, they didn\u2019t pull up a set of photos. Their real estate agent\nprobably said, \u2018here\u2019s a house in a neighborhood,\u2019 and they went to the open\nhouse but certainly no one was changing furniture or removing travel\nmementos,\u201d Lasner says. My own parents tell me of running around to different\ntowns and neighborhoods whenever a house in their price range was listed;\noften someone would have gotten there before them and already written a check\nto secure the place. The home they ended up with only had one bathroom; my\ngrandparents told them they\u2019d never ever get back what they put into it. (It\nis now worth roughly 17 times what they bought it for.)\n\nI had been saving to buy a house for so long that I certainly had dreams of\nwhat it would look like when I finally bought it. It would have a front porch\nand an in-law suite and space for a vegetable garden; it would be walking\ndistance from coffee shops and restaurants, it would be on a quiet street and\nI would be able to look out at least one window and not see another house. In\nan ideal world, it would be blue.\n\nBut after looking at dozens of houses in-person in 2022 and 2023, and hundreds\nmore on Zillow, my criteria changed. I was spending a lot of time and energy\nlooking for a house I loved, all while realizing that if I spent what it would\ncost to buy my \u201cforever\u201d home in this market, I\u2019d have gigantic house payments\nuntil I died. So when we saw a house that had been on the market for months\nthat wasn\u2019t horrible, and when we calculated just how much money we\u2019d save by\nnot writing a rent check anymore, we put in an offer. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll\nlive here for five years or 50, and I\u2019m trying to be okay with that.\n\nMaybe that type of uncertainty is fine. \u201cI bristle at the idea of forever\nanything,\u201d says Katie Hawkins-Gaar, a writer who married young and bought her\n\u201cforever home\u201d in St. Petersburg, Fla. in 2015. When her husband died suddenly\nin 2017, Hawkins-Gaar had to come to terms with the idea that she was not\ngoing to have the life she thought she was. What she went through was\ndevastating\u2014but losing her forever home turned out okay. She met someone else,\nmoved somewhere else, and now has a toddler. But she doesn\u2019t think of her\nfamily\u2019s current house as her \u201cforever home,\u201d either, even though they own it.\nShe thought she had a forever marriage, she says, and life taught her\notherwise. Maybe it\u2019s more healthy to just plan for right now. \u201cIt\u2019s good to\nkeep an open mind no matter what your situation in life,\u201d she says, \u201cif we\napproach more things as, \u2018this feels good for this point in my life,\u2019 it opens\nmore opportunities for us to check in.\u2019\u201d\n\nBesides, as I\u2019ve learned, eschewing the term \u201cforever home\u201d can be a good way\nto save money. A contractor recently looked at the duct work that had been\ninstalled in our attic and was not circulating air correctly. He gave us two\noptions: we could do an easy fix for $1,500, or, he said, \u201cif this is your\nforever home,\u201d we could tear out the duct work and put in a new system for\n$40,000.\n\nWe chose the cheaper option. Nothing is forever.\n\n## More Must-Reads From TIME\n\n  * The 100 Most Influential People of 2024\n  * The Revolution of Yulia Navalnaya\n  * 6 Compliments That Land Every Time\n  * What's the Deal With the Bitcoin Halving?\n  * If You're Dating Right Now , You're Brave: Column\n  * The AI That Could Heal a Divided Internet\n  * Fallout Is a Brilliant Model for the Future of Video Game Adaptations\n  * Want Weekly Recs on What to Watch, Read, and More?
