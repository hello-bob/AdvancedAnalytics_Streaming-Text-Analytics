During exposure to sunlight 7-dehydrocholesterol\nin the skin absorbs UV B radiation and is converted to previtamin D3 which in\nturn isomerizes into vitamin D3. Previtamin D3 and vitamin D3 also absorb UV B\nradiation and are converted into a variety of photoproducts some of which have\nunique biologic properties. Sun induced vitamin D synthesis is greatly\ninfluenced by season, time of day, latitude, altitude, air pollution, skin\npigmentation, sunscreen use, passing through glass and plastic, and aging.\nVitamin D is metabolized sequentially in the liver and kidneys into\n25-hydroxyvitamin D which is a major circulating form and\n1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D which is the biologically active form respectively.\n1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D plays an important role in regulating calcium and\nphosphate metabolism for maintenance of metabolic functions and for skeletal\nhealth. Most cells and organs in the body have a vitamin D receptor and many\ncells and organs are able to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. As a result\n1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D influences a large number of biologic pathways which\nmay help explain association studies relating vitamin D deficiency and living\nat higher latitudes with increased risk for many chronic diseases including\nautoimmune diseases, some cancers, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease,\nschizophrenia and type 2 diabetes. A three-part strategy of increasing food\nfortification programs with vitamin D, sensible sun exposure recommendations\nand encouraging ingestion of a vitamin D supplement when needed should be\nimplemented to prevent global vitamin D deficiency and its negative health\nconsequences.\n\nKeywords: 25-hydroxyvitamin D, UV lamp, UV radiation, UVB, autoimmune, cancer,\nlatitude, rickets, sunlight, vitamin D\n\nGo to:\n\n## Prehistoric Perspective\n\nLife forms began to evolve in the oceans over 1 billion years ago. They took\nadvantage of sunlight and used it as an energy source to generate\ncarbohydrates. Curiously some of the earliest phytoplankton including\nEmiliania huxleyi (which is a coccolithophore, i.e., has a calcium carbonate\nexoskeleton) which has existed unchanged in the Sargasso Sea (Atlantic Ocean)\nfor more than 500 million years when exposed to sunlight not only\nphotosynthesized glucose but also produced vitamin D_2 (Fig. 1).^1 This\nphytoplankton produces a large amount of ergosterol that when exposed to\nsunlight absorbs ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and undergoes a photolysis\nreaction to form previtamin D_2. Once formed this thermodynamically unstable\nisomer is transformed into vitamin D_2. Similarly yeast and fungi also contain\nhigh amounts of ergosterol and when exposed to sunlight produce vitamin\nD_2.^1^-^4\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 1. Microscopic picture of Emiliana huxleyi, which is a cocolithophore\ni.e., has a calcium carbonate exoskeleton. Holick, copyright 2013. Reproduced\nwith permission.\n\nAlthough the functions of ergosterol and vitamin D_2 are unknown in these\nprimitive unicellular photosynthesizing factories there are at least three\npossible functions that have been proposed. Ergosterol can efficiently absorb\nUVB radiation, which would make it an ideal natural sunscreen to protect UVB\nsensitive macromolecules in the organism including its proteins, RNA and DNA\n(Fig. 2).^1^,^2\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 2. UV absorption spectra for (A) previtamin D_3, (B) tachysterol, (C)\nprovitamin D_3 (7-dehydrocholesterol), (D) lumisterol, (E) DNA, and (F)\nalbumin. Holick, copyright 2007. Reproduced with permission.\n\nAfter absorbing UVB radiation previtamin D_2 is produced. Its absorption\nspectrum with a wavelength maximum at 260 nm overlaps the UV absorption\nspectrum for both DNA and RNA and thus would be able to protect DNA and RNA\nfrom photodamage (Fig. 2).^2 When previtamin D_2 is exposed to UVB radiation\nit is converted to tachysterol_2 which has a UV absorption spectrum with a\nwavelength maximum at 282 nm which overlaps the UV absorption spectrum for\namino acids in proteins that have conjugated double bonds including tryptophan\nand tyrosine (Fig. 1 and and22).^1^-^4 Thus early in evolution as organisms\nbegan to utilize solar energy for photosynthesis they needed a sun protection\nfactor to absorb solar UVB radiation to minimize damage to UVB sensitive\nmolecules. Ergosterol, previtamin D_2, and its photoproducts could have acted\nas an ideal UVB sunscreen since they could absorb UVB radiation and dissipate\nits energy by the rearrangement of the double bonds.^2\n\nThe amount of previtamin D_2 and photoproducts produced during sun exposure\ncould also have been a photochemical signal (actinometer) to tell the organism\nthat it has been exposed to enough solar UVB radiation and to signal it to\nleave the surface into deeper water where it would no longer be exposed to UVB\nradiation due to the ocean\u2019s ability to absorb this solar energy.^2\n\nIt has also been speculated that if ergosterol was principally present in the\nplasma membrane and contained within the lipid bilayer that this rigid planar\nstructure after exposure to solar UVB radiation would be transformed into a\nmore flexible vitamin D_2 molecule that would likely be released into the\nextracellular space. This process could alter membrane permeability and\npossibly open up a pore to permit the entrance and exit of ions including\ncalcium. This could be the connection for why vertebrates including humans\nhave depended on sun exposure for the maintenance of their calcium\nmetabolism.^2^,^5^-^7\n\nGo to:\n\n## Historical Perspective\n\nAs the industrial revolution swept across Northern Europe in the 1600s\nresulting in buildings built in close proximity and coal burning causing a\npall of air pollution (Fig. 3) so too appeared a bone deforming disease\nrickets in children that had devastating health consequences (Fig. 4).^8^,^9\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 3.

Holick, copyright 2006.\nReproduced with permission.\n\nThe first insight into the possible relationship between the industrialization\nof Northern Europe and rickets was made by \u015aniadecki^10 (Fig. 5A) in 1822 when\nhe concluded that children who lived in the inner city of Warsaw had a high\nincidence of rickets because of their lack of sun exposure. This was based on\nhis clinical observations that children living in rural areas outside of\nWarsaw did not suffer from rickets while children born and raised in Warsaw\nwere plagued with the disease. More than 70 y later Palm^11 came to the same\nconclusion based on reports from his colleagues in third world countries\nincluding India and China that rickets was uncommon compared with the high\nprevalence of the disease in children living in London. Another 30 y would\npass before Huldschinsky^12^,^13 (Fig. 5B) would report that rachitic children\nexposed to a mercury arc lamp had dramatic radiologic improvement of their\nrickets several months later. He cleverly also realized that exposing one arm\nof a child with rickets had the same dramatic radiologic improvement in the\nforearm of the arm not exposed to the mercury arc lamp. He therefore correctly\nconcluded that it was likely that something was being made in the skin and\nentered into the circulation to improve the global bone health of the child\n(Fig. 6).^12^,^13 Finally in 1921 Hess and Unger^8^,^14 (Fig. 5C) exposed\nrachitic children to sunlight on the roof of their hospital in New York City\nand demonstrated significant radiologic improvement in the children\u2019s rickets.\nThese physicians also realized that children of color were at much higher risk\nfor rickets and concluded that they needed longer exposure to sunlight to both\ntreat and prevent rickets.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 5.

This led to the addition of ergosterol to milk followed\nby UVB irradiation or the addition of ergosterol that had been previously\nexposed to UVB radiation or to the addition of vitamin D_2 to the milk (Fig.\n7).^8\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 7.

The United States government also established an agency in\n1931 whose goal was to promote sensible sun exposure of young children to\nprevent rickets and improve their bone health (Fig. 8).^9^,^14 Within a few\nyears these interventions essentially eradicated rickets.^8^,^17^-^19\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 8.

The experts concluded that this was most\nlikely due to vitamin D intoxication since a similar presentation had been\nobserved in neonatal rodents born of mothers who were fed high doses of\nvitamin D.^20^-^22 Legislation quickly followed banning the fortification of\nany food or personal use products with vitamin D in Great Britain.^8^,^17^,^22\nThis ban quickly spread across Europe and for the most part remains in effect\ntoday with the exception of a few foods including margarine and some cereals\nbeing fortified with vitamin D.^8^,^19^-^22 It is however likely that these\nchildren had Williams syndrome which is associated with elfin faces, mental\nretardation, heart problems, and hypercalcemia due to a hypersensitivity to\nvitamin D.^23 Sweden and Finland now permit milk to be fortified with vitamin\nD.^22^,^24 It is worth noting that milk has been fortified with 100 IU vitamin\nD/8 oz for the past 80+ years without any reports of toxicity in infants. In\nthe past 10 y juice products including orange juice have been fortified in the\nUnited States with 100 IU vitamin D/8 oz without any reports of toxicity.^22\n\nGo to:\n\n## Photochemistry of Provitamin D_3\n\nDuring exposure to sunlight solar radiation with wavelengths of 290\u2013315 nm\npenetrate into the skin and are absorbed by proteins, DNA and RNA as well as\n7-dehydrocholesterol.^1^,^2 Most of this UVB radiation is absorbed in the\nepidermis and as a result when exposed to sunlight most of the vitamin D_3\nthat is produced in the skin is made in the living cells in the epidermis.\nThis is the reason why after exposure to sunlight vitamin D_3 remains in the\nskin even when the skin is washed with soap and water immediately after the\nexposure to sunlight.\n\nWhen epidermal 7-dehydrocholesterol absorbs solar UVB radiation with energies\nof 290\u2013315 nm (Fig. 10), it causes an activation of the double bonds causing\nthem to rearrange and open up the B ring to form the seco-steroid (split\nsteroid) previtamin D_3 (Fig. 11).^25\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 10.

In hexane pro-D_3 is photolyzed to\ns-cis,s-cis-pre-D_3. Once formed, this energetically unstable conformation\nundergoes a conformational change to the s-trans,s-cis-pre-D_3. Only the\ns-cis,s-cis-pre-D_3 can undergo thermal isomerization to vitamin D_3. The\ns-cis,s-cis conformer of pre-D_3 is stabilized in the phospholipid bilayer by\nhydrophilic interactions between the 3\u03b2-hydroxl group and the polar head of\nthe lipids, as well as by the van der Waals interactions between the steroid\nring and side-chain structure and the hydrophobic tail of the lipids. These\ninteractions significantly decrease the conversion of the s-cis,s-cis\nconformer to the s-trans,s-cis conformer, thereby facilitating the thermal\nisomerization of s-cis,s-cis-pre-D_3 to vitamin D_3. Holick, copyright 1995.\nReproduced with permission.\n\nPrevitamin D_3 when made in a test tube exists in two confomeric forms, a\n5,6-sec-cis-s-cis (czc) and a 5,6-sec-trans-s-cis (czt) form. The czt\nconformer is the most thermodynamically stable form and thus most of the\nprevitamin D_3 when produced in a test tube exists as this conformer. This\nconformer however being stable cannot isomerize to vitamin D_3. However the\nless thermodynamically stable conformer czc does undergo a 1\u20137 antarafacial\nsigma shift of a hydrogen from C-19 to C-9 causing rearrangement of the double\nbonds to form vitamin D_3. As a result it takes several days in a test tube at\nroom temperature and even at body temperature for the czt conformer to\nisomerize to the czc conformer which then is converted to vitamin D_3 (Fig.\n12).^6^,^7^,^26^,^27\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 12.

Each point represents the mean value from three separate analyses.\nHolick, copyright 1995. Reproduced with permission.\n\nFrom a physiologic perspective it made little sense for it to take several\ndays for previtamin D_3 to convert to vitamin D_3 in the skin as it does in a\ntest tube. Furthermore this was a significant problem for poikilothermic (cold\nblooded) vertebrates since a lower outside temperature would make it take a\nmuch longer time for previtamin D_3 that was produced in the skin to convert\nto vitamin D_3. Studies of lizard skin exposed to simulated sunlight revealed\nthat the conversion of previtamin D_3 to vitamin D_3 was 10 times faster when\ncompared with previtamin D_3 in a isotropic organic solution (Fig. 12).^6 A\nsimilar observation was made in human skin (Fig. 13).^7\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 13. Thermoconversion of pre-D_3 to vitamin D_3 as a function of time in\nhuman skin and in n-hexane at 37\u00b0C.

Reproduced with\npermission from.^7\n\nThis suggested that the skin had some property that accelerated the conversion\nof previtamin D_3 to vitamin D_3. One possible explanation was that an enzyme\nexisted that catalytically converted previtamin D_3 to vitamin D_3. Skin\nhomogenates incubated with previtamin D_3 did not result in an enhancement in\nits conversion to vitamin D_3. Thus another explanation needed to be found. It\nwas hypothesized and finally proven with several studies that\n7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin cell principally existed in the plasma\nmembrane and was incorporated within the fatty acid hydrocarbon side chain and\npolar head group of the triglycerides (Figs. 11 and and14).14). The rigid\nplanar structure of 7-dehydrocholesterol sandwiched in between the\ntriglyceride fatty acid hydrocarbon tails could only be transformed into the\nplanar czc conformer of previtamin D_3 upon exposure to solar UVB radiation\n(Fig. 11).^6^,^26^-^28\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 14. Proposed theoretical structural model for the localization of the\ncZc-previtamin D_3 in the phospholipids of a membrane. Based on the\namphipathic nature and conformational mobility of previtamin D_3, we proposed\nthe following model to show the spatial relationship between previtamin D_3\nand phospholipids. We postulated that in the membrane, the cholesterol like\ncZc-previtamin D_3 is aligned parallel to its neighboring phospholipids, with\nits polar 3\u03b2-hydroxy interacting with the polar head groups of the\nphospholipids through hydrogen bonding, and the hydrophobic rings and side\nchain interacting with the nonpolar acyl chains of the lipids through\nhydrophobic and van der Waals interactions.

Reproduced with permission from.^27\n\nBecause vitamin D_3 is thermodynamically more stable and also more flexible it\nis ejected out of the plasma membrane into the extracellular space and\ndiffuses into the capillary bed in the dermis where it is bound to the vitamin\nD binding protein (DBP) for transport to the liver.^2^,^5^,^6^,^22^,^29^,^30\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion as to whether ingesting vitamin D from the\ndiet or from a supplement is the same as producing vitamin D_3 in the skin.\nBecause it takes approximately ~8 h for previtamin D_3 in the skin to fully\nconvert to vitamin D_3^26^,^27 and it takes additional time for the vitamin\nD_3 to enter the dermal capillary bed this is at least 2 of the explanations\nfor why it was observed that vitamin D_3 produced in the skin last 2\u20133 times\nlonger in the circulation when compared with ingesting it orally (Fig. 16).^29\nFurthermore when vitamin D_3 is produced in the skin 100% of it is potentially\nbound to the vitamin D binding protein (Fig. 17). When vitamin D_3 is ingested\nfrom the diet or supplement it gets incorporated into chylomicrons which are\ntransported into the lymphatic system and then into the venous system were\napproximately 60% of the vitamin D_3 is bound to the vitamin D binding protein\nand 40% is rapidly cleared in the lipoprotein bound fraction.^29\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 16.

A schematic representation of the photochemical and thermal events\nthat result in the synthesis of vitamin D_3 in the skin, and the\nphotodegradation of previtamin D_3 and vitamin D_3 to biologically inert\nphotoproducts. 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in the skin is converted to\nprevitamin D_3 by the action of solar UV B radiation. Once formed, previtamin\nD_3 is transformed into vitamin D_3 by a heat-dependent (\u0394H) process. Vitamin\nD_3 exits the skin into the dermal capillary blood system and is bound to a\nspecific vitamin D-binding protein (DBP). When previtamin D_3 and vitamin D_3\nare exposed to solar UV B radiation, they are converted to a variety of\nphotoproducts that have little or no activity on calcium metabolism.

In addition when vitamin D_3 is made from\nprevitamin D_3 in the skin if it is exposed to solar UVB radiation it will\nabsorb UVB radiation and be converted into several suprasterols and 5,6-trans-\nvitamin D_3 (Figs. 17 and and19).19). In addition previtamin D_3 can also be\nconverted to several toxisterols (Fig. 20).^33^-^36 Therefore no matter how\nmuch sun a human is exposed to vitamin D intoxication will not occur because\nany excess previtamin D_3 and vitamin D_3 is photodegraded into products that\nhave no calcemic activity.^31^,^32\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 18.

One product, lumisterol_3, if converted to\n1,25-dihydroxylumisterol_3 may have anti-tumor effects in the skin.^37 Some of\nthe suprasterols also have antiproliferative activity in cultured human\nkeratinocytes (Fig. 21).

Therefore increasing the path length by which solar UVB has to\ntravel through the ozone layer will result in a decrease in the number of UVB\nphotons that reach the earth's surface (Fig. 22).^40 This is the explanation\nfor why during the winter when living above and below approximately 33\u00b0\nlatitude very little if any vitamin D_3 can be produced in the skin from sun\nexposure. People who live farther North and South often cannot make any\nvitamin D_3 in their skin for up to 6 mo of the year.^41 For example in Boston\nat 42\u00b0 North essentially no vitamin D_3 can be produced in the skin from\nNovember through February. Inhabitants living in Edmonton Canada at 52\u00b0 North,\nBergen Norway at 60\u00b0 North, or Ushuaia Argentina at 55\u00b0 South are unable to\nproduce any significant vitamin D_3 for about 6 mo of the year (Figs. 23 and\nand2424).^2^,^39^,^41\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 22. The solar zenith angle is the angle made by the sun\u2019s light with\nrespect to the vertical (the sun being directly overhead). This angle is\nincreased at higher latitudes, early morning and late afternoon when the sun\nis not directly overhead, and during the winter months. As the solar zenith\nangle increases, the amount of UVB radiation reaching the earth\u2019s surface is\nreduced. Therefore, at higher latitudes, greater distance from the equator,\nmore of the UVB radiation is absorbed by the ozone layer thereby reducing or\neliminating the cutaneous production of vitamin D_3.

This was dramatically demonstrated in Agra (169 M altitude),\nKatmandu (1400 M), and Mount Everest base camp (5300 M), India (27\u00b0 North). An\nanalysis of sun-induced vitamin D_3 synthesis in vitro was conducted at higher\naltitudes at the same latitude during the same month. In November in Agra very\nlittle previtamin D_3 was produced during exposure to the sun. It was observed\nthat there was a direct correlation with increased previtamin D_3 production\nwith increased altitude. At Mt Everest base camp (5300 min) there was almost a\n5-fold increase in previtamin D_3 production compared with what was observed\nin Agra (Fig. 28).^46 Since glass absorbs all UVB radiation, exposure of the\nskin to sunlight that passes through glass, plexiglass, and plastic will not\nresult in any production of vitamin D_3 in the skin (Fig. 29).^31\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 28.

Therefore the topical application of a sunscreen with an SPF of 30\nreduces the capacity of the skin to produce vitamin D_3 by the same amount\ni.e., 95\u201398%.^22 This was confirmed with the report that the application of\nsunscreen with a SPF of only 8 dramatically reduced the blood level of vitamin\nD_3 after exposure to simulated sunlight in a tanning bed (Fig. 30).^47^,^48\nFarmers in the Midwest who had a history of non-melanoma skin cancer and who\nwore a sunscreen all the time before going outdoors for more than a year\ndemonstrated that at the end of the summer their blood levels were\nsignificantly lower (most were vitamin D deficient) than the levels of the\ncontrol group (Fig. 31).^48\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 30.

They were constantly exposed to sunlight and\ndeveloped an efficient natural sunscreen melanin,^49 which has an absorption\nspectrum of 290\u2013700 nm and thus can effectively absorb solar UVB radiation\n(Fig. 32).^45 However even though Africans have extremely dark heavily\npigmented skin a small amount of UVB radiation is able to penetrate into the\nepidermis to produce vitamin D_3. This was demonstrated when adult whites\n(skin type 2) and blacks (skin type 5) were exposed to the same amount of UVB\nradiation in a tanning bed. Whereas the white adults raised their blood levels\nof vitamin D_3 more than 30 fold the black adults demonstrated no significant\nincrease in their blood levels of vitamin D_3. However when the black adults\nwere exposed to 5 times more UVB radiation, they increased their blood level\nby about 15-fold (Fig. 33).^50 This was confirmed when surgically obtained\nwhite and black skin was exposed to sunlight in Boston in summer. After 30 min\napproximately 3% of cutaneous 7-dehydrocholesterol was converted to previtamin\nD_3 in the white skin sample whereas only about 0.3% of 7-dehydrocholesterol\nwas converted to previtamin D_3 in the black skin (Fig. 34).^51 These findings\ncould explain the positive association between skin lightness and\n25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels as found by Armas et al.^52 (Fig. 35).\nThe associations between skin lightness, UVB dose and 25(OH)D are documented\nin Figure 36.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 32.

Africans such as the Maasai\n(Fig. 37) living outdoors exposed to sunlight daily throughout the year have\nrobust circulating concentrations of the major circulating form of vitamin D,\n25(OH)D, in the range of 46 ng/mL.^53\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 37. Maasi men demonstrate their muscle strength who have been reported\nto have 25(OH)D ~46 ng/ml. Holick, copyright 2013, reproduced with permission.\n\nAlthough there have been several explanations for why skin pigment devolved as\nhumans migrated North and South of the equator one of the most likely\nexplanations is as humans migrated farther North and South of the equator the\nzenith angle of the sun increased resulting in a decrease in the amount of\nsolar UVB radiation reaching the earth thereby reducing vitamin D_3 synthesis.\nA decrease in the amount of skin pigment resulted in a decrease in the sun\nscreening protection permitting more of the UVB radiation to reach the\nepidermal cells. This provided an evolutionary advantage by being more\nefficient in producing vitamin D_3.^49 It had long been speculated that our\nNeanderthal ancestors were heavily pigmented hairy creatures. This however did\nnot make a lot of sense since heavy pigmentation and excessive hair would\nmarkedly reduce cutaneous production of vitamin D_3 which was essential for\nmaximizing skeletal health throughout life thereby reducing risk of life-\nthreatening fractures. However, more important is the fact that vitamin D\ndeficiency in utero and during the first few years of life would have caused\ninfantile rickets resulting in a flat deformed pelvis with a small pelvic\noutlet. Furthermore vitamin D is important for muscle function which is also\ncrucial for birthing.^22^,^54 These conditions caused by vitamin D deficiency\nwould have made it difficult for females to give birth. Therefore in order to\nsurvive and procreate skin pigmentation had to markedly decrease in order to\npermit more UVB photons to enter the skin to produce sufficient amounts of\nprevitamin D_3.^54^,^55 Recent evidence has suggested that Neanderthals had a\nmutation of their melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor resulting in them\nbeing redheaded and having Celtic-like fair skin.^56^,^57 This is the likely\nexplanation for why people in Northern Europe have skin types 1 and 2.\n\n### Aging\n\nIt was observed that 7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations in human epidermis\nwere inversely related to age (Fig. 38).^58 The effect of aging on the\ncutaneous production of vitamin D_3 was demonstrated in a study that exposed\nhealthy young adults and older adults to the same amount of UVB radiation in a\ntanning bed. The increase in the blood level of vitamin D_3 in six young\nadults aged 20\u201330 was at least three-fold higher compared with the six older\nadults aged 62\u201380 demonstrating that aging significantly decreased the\ncapacity of the skin to produce vitamin D_3 (Fig. 39).^59 With this marked\nage-related decrease in the cutaneous production of vitamin D_3 could the\nelderly benefit from being exposed to sunlight or UVB radiation? The skin has\na large capacity to produce vitamin D_3. Exposure of a young adult in a\nbathing suit to one minimal erythemal dose (MED) of UV radiation in a tanning\nbed was equivalent to ingesting approximately 20,000 IUs of vitamin D_2 (Fig.\n40).^25 When a healthy 75 y old male in a bathing suit was exposed to UVB\nradiation in a tanning bed three times a week for 7 weeks he was able to raise\nand maintain his blood levels of 25(OH)D into the healthy normal range of ~50\nng/ml (Fig. 41C). The percent increase in circulating 25(OH)D concentrations\nwas similar to what was observed in healthy young adults (Fig. 41B). Ampoules\ncontaining 7-DHC that were also irradiated served to demonstrate the efficacy\nof the tanning bed in producing previtamin D_3 (Fig. 41A).^5 A study in\nelderly in a nursing home that had an activity room with an UVB emitting lamps\non the ceiling (Fig. 42) reported that this was effective in raising and\nmaintaining 25(OH)D levels in these residents (Fig. 43).^60\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 38.

Those who had regular sun\nexposure achieved a blood level of 25(OH)D of ~45 ng/mL compared with women\nwho avoided direct sun exposure had a 25(OH)D of ~23 ng/mL. This was also\nsupported by the fact that hours of sun exposure was directly related to\ncirculating concentrations of 25(OH)D (Fig. 45).^62\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 44.

This may be due\nto the fact that keratinocytes produce \u03b2-endorphin when exposed to UV\nradiation.^67 In the early 1900s Finsen (Fig. 48) observed that exposure to\nsunlight (Fig. 49) dramatically improved cutaneous skin lesions caused by a\ntuberculosis infection (lupus vulgaris) and received the Nobel Prize in 1903\nfor his enlightening observations. This led to the use of solariums as a way\nto treat patients with tuberculosis and gave rise to the use of heliotherapy\nto improve health.^19^,^68^,^69 Heliotherapy was used to treat a wide variety\nof chronic illnesses in the early 1900s and it is still practiced throughout\nthe world and especially in Northern Europe.^19^,^70^-^72 The rise in the use\nof pharmaceuticals to treat acute and chronic diseases led to the demise of\nheliotherapy especially in United States.^19^,^68^,^69^,^73\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 48.

He compared cancer mortality between 1908 and 1912 and observed that\ncancer mortality increased with increasing distance from the equator (Fig.\n50). In 1937 Peller and Stephenson^75 analyzed the incidence of cancer in navy\npersonnel in the United States Navy who were documented to have increased\nexposure to solar UV radiation with age matched controls and reported that the\nrate of skin cancer was eight times higher in the navy personnel while the\ntotal number of deaths from other cancers was 60% less than the civilian\npopulation.^75\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 50. Mortality from cancer in cities according to latitude, 1908\u20131912.\nReproduced with permission from.^74\n\nFour years later, Apperly^76 compared total cancer mortality in the\npopulations studied with the percentage of Americans and Canadians in the same\npopulation who were engaged in agriculture. He concluded that cancer mortality\nwas highest in farmers living in the Northeast compared with those living in\nthe South (Fig. 51).^76 He also reported that farmers living in the South\nexposed to more sunlight were at a higher risk for nonmelanoma skin cancer\nwhich he noted was easy to detect and easy to treat. He concluded that the\nfact that these Southern farmers had nonmelanoma skin cancer resulted in them\ndeveloping an immunity to the skin cancer which also resulted in an immunity\nto all cancers including those with high mortality rate.^76\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 51. Showing the relation of total cancer mortality rates to Smith's\nSolar Radiation Index in the American states, (white population only).\nReproduced with permission from.^76\n\nThese observations essentially went unnoticed and the curious relationship of\nincreased sun exposure and living at a lower latitude reducing risk of cancer\nmortality was buried in the literature. Forty years would pass before Garland\net al.^77 reported that there was a strong significant negative correlation\nwith colon cancer mortality and mean daily solar radiation in the United\nStates (Fig. 52).\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 52.

Reproduced with permission\nfrom.^77\n\nThey followed up these findings with an eight-year prospective case-control\nstudy of adults living in Washington County and reported that the risk of\ngetting colon cancer decreased three-fold in people with a serum 25(OH)D > 20\nng/ml. These results together suggested that living at higher latitudes meant\nless exposure to vitamin D producing sunlight and therefore the connection\nwith the first association with latitude and cancer mortality could be linked\nto an inverse relationship with cancer mortality and vitamin D status.^78 Even\nin California where there is a large difference in latitude there was a\npositive association with colorectal cancer prevalence with latitude (Fig.\n53).^45\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 53.

Grant^79 reported a\ndramatic inverse relationship between premature mortality due to cancer with\nUV exposure in both men and women (Fig. 54). In the United States, inverse\nassociations with exposure to solar UVB radiation and cancer risk and\nmortality were reported for ovarian^80 and breast cancer,^81 cancers of the\ndigestive system^79^,^82 and prostate cancer.^83^,^84 A meta-analysis of\nstudies reporting cancer incidence rates for more than 100 countries including\nAustralia, China, Japan, Spain among others revealed an inverse relationship\nwith solar UVB exposure for 15 types of cancer including bladder, breast,\ncervical, colon, endometrial, esophageal, gastric, lung, ovarian, pancreatic,\nrectal, renal and vulvar cancer as well as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's\nlymphoma.^85 Boscoe and Schymura^86 found that the relative risk of cancer\nincidence and mortality for numerous malignancies was strongly related to\nsolar UVB exposure (Fig. 55). Giovannucci et al.^87 conducted a prospective\nstudy in men relating predictors of vitamin D status and cancer incidence and\nalso found an inverse association (Fig. 56). Luscombe et al.^88 reported men\nwho worked outdoors had a 3-y hiatus before developing prostate cancer\ncompared with indoor workers (Fig. 57). It was also reported that adults who\ndeveloped lymphoma had a decreased risk for mortality if they had more sun\nexposure as a teenager.^89 Knight et al.^90 asked women in Canada who had\nbreast cancer how much sun exposure they had during their teenage and young\nadult life and compared this sun exposure to women matched for age, ethnicity\nand place of residence. She concluded that women who had the most sun exposure\nfrom ages 10 to 19 y reduced their risk of developing breast cancer by more\nthan 60% when comparing the highest quartile of outdoor activities with the\nlowest. Also women over 40 y who had the most sun exposure lost the benefit\nsince their risk was no different than those who had the least sun exposure.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 54.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI)\ninitially reported that women who took 1000 mg of calcium and 400 IUs of\nvitamin D_3 daily for up to 8 y had no reduced risk for colorectal cancer.^106\nHowever the women in this study who had a baseline 25(OH)D < 12 ng/mL had a\n253% increased risk for developing colorectal cancer compared with women who\nhad a baseline 25(OH)D of at least 23 ng/mL. Further scrutiny of the data from\nthe WHI revealed that only 60% of the women admitted taking their calcium and\nvitamin D supplement at least 80% of the time.

It is known for example\nthat influenza infection is most prevalent in the winter months at latitudes\nNorth and South of the equator but is sporadic throughout the year in children\nand adults who live near the equator (Fig. 60). It has been hypothesized that\nthe seasonal variation could be due to a seasonal variation in circulating\nlevels of 25(OH)D.^119 Several observational and intervention studies have\nhelped to support this hypothesis. Healthy adults living in New England who\nhad 25(OH)D blood levels of ~38 ng/mL approximately halved their risk of\ndeveloping acute viral respiratory tract infections.^120 School children in\nJapan who received 1200 IUs of vitamin D_3 daily for 4 mo during the winter\nreduced their risk of developing influenza infection by 42%.^121 A study of\n156 neonates revealed that the risk for acquiring respiratory syncytial virus\n(RSV), a pathogen causing severe lower respiratory tract infection, was 6-fold\nhigher in infants who had a blood level of 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL compared with\ninfants who had a blood level of 25(OH)D > 30 ng/mL.^122\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 60.

This results in the conversion of\n25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)_2D. 1,25(OH)_2D interacts with the VDR and increases the\nexpression of cathelicidin^125 which is a member of the defensin proteins and\nrapidly permealizes susceptible infectious agents resulting in their\ndestruction (Fig. 61). This is one of the mechanisms believed to be\nresponsible for vitamin D reducing risk of infectious diseases. Liu et al.^125\nalso reported that the extent of antimicrobial activity of a monocyte exposed\nto Mycobacterium tuberculosis depended on the 25(OH)D levels of the medium in\nwhich the monocytes were cultured. Monocytes cultured in serum of African-\nAmerican individuals who were vitamin D deficient (mean ~8 ng/mL) mounted an\nineffective cathelicidin mRNA response upon exposure to M. tuberculosis,\nhowever the supplementation of the sera with 25(OH)D (mean ~30 ng/mL) restored\nthe toll-like receptor mediated induction of cathelicidin mRNA. This was\nsubstantiated by Adams et al.^126 who not only showed, that the expression of\ncathelicidin by monocytes exposed to M. tuberculosis lipopeptides was\nsignificantly enhanced by addition of exogenous 25(OH)D to the vitamin D\ndeficient serum but that serum from vitamin D-supplemented subjects had the\nsame effect. This data added support for the importance of maintaining a serum\n25(OH)D > 30 ng/mL to generate an effective cathelicidin response following\nactivation of monocytes/macrophages.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 61. Metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] to\n1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 1,25(OH)_2D for non-skeletal functions. When a\nmonocyte/macrophage is stimulated through its toll-like receptor 2/1 (TLR2/1)\nby an infective agent such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), or its\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS) the signal upregulates the expression of vitamin D\nreceptor (VDR) and the 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-hydroxylase (1-OHase). 25(OH)D\nlevels > 30 ng/mL provides adequate substrate for the 1-OHase to convert it to\n1,25(OH)_2D. 1,25(OH)_2D returns to the nucleus where it increases the\nexpression of cathelicidin which is a peptide capable of promoting innate\nimmunity and inducing the destruction of infective agents such as TB. It is\nalso likely that the 1,25(OH)_2D produced in the monocytes/macrophage is\nreleased to act locally on activated T (AT) and activated B (AB) lymphocytes\nwhich regulate cytokine and immunoglobulin synthesis respectively. When\n25(OH)D levels are ~30 ng/mL, it reduces risk of many common cancers.^22^-^32\nIt is believed that the local production of 1,25(OH)_2D in the breast, colon,\nprostate, and other cells regulates a variety of genes that control\nproliferation. Once 1,25(OH)_2D completes the task of maintaining normal\ncellular proliferation and differentiation, it induces the 25-hydroxyvitamin\nD-24-hydroxylase (24-OHase). The 24-OHase enhances the metabolism of\n1,25(OH)_2D to calcitroic acid which is biologically inert. Thus, the local\nproduction of 1,25(OH)_2D does not enter the circulation and has no influence\non calcium metabolism. The parathyroid glands have 1-OHase activity and the\nlocal production of 1,25(OH)_2D inhibits the expression and synthesis of PTH.\nThe production of 1,25(OH)_2D in the kidney enters the circulation and is able\nto downregulate renin production in the kidney and to stimulate insulin\nsecretion in the \u03b2-islet cells of the pancreas. Holick, copyright 2007.\nReproduced with permission.\n\nIt has also been suggested based on studies in mice and in vitro that the\nlocal keratinocyte production of 1,25(OH)_2D_3 from 25(OH)D_3 in the skin and\noral pharynx enhanced the production of cathelicidin supporting the concept\nthat maintaining serum 25(OH)D above 30 ng/ml may also be important in\nfighting infections in both the skin and oropharynx.^127^-^130 This may also\nhelp explain the observation that the risk for periodontal disease is higher\nin adults who have the lowest circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D.^131\nCalcium and vitamin D supplementation was associated with a lower risk of\ntooth loss in elderly men and women^1 respectively and with better periodontal\nhealth.^132^,^133\n\nGo to:\n\n## Sunlight and Vitamin D: Autoimmunity Protection\n\nThere are a variety of association studies demonstrating that being born or\nliving near the equator reduces risk of several autoimmune\ndiseases.^73^,^134^-^139 Being born and living for the first 10 y at a\nlatitude of ~40\u00b0 North compared with ~33\u00b0 North increases a person's risk of\ndeveloping multiple sclerosis by 100% (Fig. 62).^134^,^140^,^141 Munger et\nal.^142 made the observation that high circulating levels of 25(OH)D were\nassociated with a lower risk of multiple sclerosis and that women who had an\nintake of vitamin D of \u2265 400 IU vitamin D per day reduced their risk of\ndeveloping multiple sclerosis by more than 40%.^143\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 62.

Merlino et al.^148 showed in a study in Iowa that women with the\nhighest intake of vitamin D reduced their risk of developing rheumatoid\narthritis by more than 30%.^73 However, other investigators did not find such\nan association when reviewing the data from this study.^149\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 66.

However when\nthey become activated they express a VDR and are now responsive to the\nimmunomodulatory activity of 1,25(OH)_2D (Fig. 61).^22^,^63^,^150\n\nIn B-cells 1,25(OH)_2D downregulates immunoglobulin synthesis^151 and B-cell\nmemory. Thus by doing so it may reduce production of autoantibodies\nresponsible for causing autoimmune diseases.^152 1,25(OH)_2D also has a\nmultitude of functions in activated T cells.^153^-^158 This hormone decreases\nT cell proliferation^154 as well as the number of Th_1-Th_17 lymphocytes while\nincreasing T-regulatory lymphocytes^155 by increasing the production of\nTh_2-Th_3 lymphocytes.^156 1,25(OH)_2D also directly influences the expression\nand synthesis of several immunomodulatory cytokines. Bouillon et al.^151\nsummarized that 1,25(OH)_2D downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and\ninterleukins (IL) such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1,\nand interferon-\u03b3 and upregulates anti-inflammatory interleukins such as IL-10\n(Fig. 67).\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 67. Overview of the pharmacological effects of 1,25(OH)_2D in the\nimmune system. 1,25(OH)_2D inhibits the surface expression of MHC II-complexed\nantigen and of costimulatory molecules, as well as the production of the\ncytokine IL-12 in antgen presenting cells (such as dendritic cells), thereby\nshifting the polarization of T cells from an (auto-)aggressive effector (Te)\ntoward a protective or regulatory (Tr) phenotype. 1,25(OH)_2D exerts its\nimmunomodulatory effects also directly on the level of T cells. Together,\nthese immunomodulatory effects of 1,25(OH)_2D onto players of the adaptive\nimmune system can lead to the protection of target tissues in autoimmune\ndiseases and transplantation. In the innate immune system on the other hand,\n1,25(OH)_2D strengthens the antimicrobial function of monocytes and\nmacrophages, for example through enhanced expression of the CAMP, eventually\nleading to better clearance of pathogenic microorganisms.

This was followed by the observation of Krause et al.^160 who reported\nthat exposure to UVB radiation in a clinical setting not only improved\ncirculating concentrations of 25(OH)D by more than 160% but also significantly\nreduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with\nhypertension. A control group was exposed to the same UV lamps that were\ncovered by an acrylic shield absorbing all UVB radiation and thus was exposed\nto UVA radiation only. The control group\u2019s subjects demonstrated no\nsignificant change in their circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D as well as\nno change in their hypertension (Fig. 70). These data suggested that vitamin D\nmay somehow be involved in cardiovascular health. One of the first insights as\nto how vitamin D could influence cardiovascular health was the observation\nthat 1,25(OH)_2D_3 suppressed the production of renin.^161 This observation\nwas also supported by the report that VDR knockout mice have a dysregulation\nof the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.^162\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 68.

By contrast teenagers who received 2000 IUs of\nvitamin D daily for 4 mo not only increased their blood level of 25(OH)D from\n13 to 34 ng/mL but also showed a significant decrease in carotid-femoral pulse\nwave velocity (5.41 \u00b1 0.73 m/sec to 5.33 \u00b1 0.79 m/sec; p = 0.031).\n\nTwo major contributing factors for cardiovascular disease are type 2 diabetes\nand obesity.^170 It is well known both in children and adults that there is an\ninverse association with serum concentrations of 25(OH)D with body mass index\n(BMI) due to a sequestration and volumetric dilution of the lipophilic vitamin\nD in the fat tissue.^73^,^171^-^174 Furthermore there is also an association\nwith vitamin D deficiency and increased risk for type 2 diabetes.^175^,^176 A\nsimilar observation was made in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study where a combined\ndaily intake of > 1200 mg calcium and > 800 IU vitamin D was associated with a\n33% lower risk of type 2 diabetes.^177 An inverse association between vitamin\nD status and diabetes was also shown in a study by Scragg et al.^178 The odds\nratio for diabetes in non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans who had\n25(OH)D levels in the highest quartile compared with the lowest was reduced by\nup to 83%.^178 However, this inverse association was not observed in non-\nHispanic blacks.^178\n\nSeveral epidemiologic studies and prospective studies have reported a highly\nsignificant association with vitamin D deficiency with not only type 2\ndiabetes but also hypertension, hyperlipidemia and peripheral vascular disease\nall causative factors for coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction,\nheart failure and stroke.^166^,^175^,^179 The prospective Intermountain Heart\nCollaborative Study revealed that in more than 40,000 participants a\ncirculating concentration of 25(OH)D < 15 ng/mL compared with a concentration\nof > 30 ng/mL significantly increased all of these risk factors.^175 A meta-\nanalysis examining the association between vitamin D status or vitamin D\nsupplementation revealed that adults with the highest circulating\nconcentration of 25(OH)D had a 43% lower risk of developing cardiometabolic\ndisorders compared with adults with low levels of 25(OH)D.^180 Furthermore a\nprospective study following up with more than 2000 adults showed that the risk\nof progression from pretype 2 diabetes to type 2 diabetes was reduced by 48%\nin adults who had the highest circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D compared\nwith those with the lowest.^181\n\nBeta islet cells in the pancreas have a VDR and 1,25(OH)_2D_3 is a potent\nstimulator of insulin production.^182 Improvement in vitamin D status has also\nbeen associated with improvement in insulin sensitivity^183 mediated by\nupregulation of insulin receptors.^184 There is evidence that vascular smooth\nmuscle and cardiomyocytes have a VDR^73^,^166^,^171 and that 1,25(OH)_2D_3\ncauses vascular relaxation by suppressing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\nsystem^73^,^163^,^185^,^186 and improves cardiomyocyte contractility.^171 In\naddition 1,25(OH)_2D_3 inhibits macrophage cholesterol uptake and foam cell\nformation thereby reducing risk for atherosclerotic plaque formation (Fig.\n71).^73^,^166^,^187 Vitamin D deficiency negatively affects numerous\nphysiological processes that are important in the pathogenesis of\ncardiovascular disease.

The face accounts for 9% of the body\nsurface, each arm for 9%, each leg for 18%, and the abdomen and the back for\n18% each.^240 Exposure of the whole body in a bathing suit to 0.5 MED of UVB\nradiation is approximately equivalent to ingesting about 7000\u201310,000 IUs of\nvitamin D_2.^22^,^25^,^31 Therefore exposing 20% of the body surface to an\namount of sunlight equal to 0.5 MED is equivalent to ingesting approximately\n1400\u20132000 IUs of vitamin D_3. This is effective for all skin types and the\nincrease in serum 25(OH)D attained from exposure to UVB radiation is often\nmore effective than ingesting 1000 IU vitamin D_2 or vitamin D_3 daily (Fig.\n83).^241 Always protect the face with a hat or sunscreen since it provides\nvery little vitamin D_3 and is most sun exposed and more prone to skin damage\nand skin cancer from sun exposure.^242^-^244\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 83.

This has\nbeen endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Endocrine Society and\nthe Institute of Medicine.^24^,^213^,^248 However infants who are vitamin D\ndeficient should be aggressively treated with pharmacologic doses of vitamin D\nin order to build up the body stores and quickly correct the vitamin D\ndeficiency. The best method to treat and cure rickets is to give a total dose\nof 5\u201315 mg (200,000\u2013600,000 IUs) of vitamin D_2 or vitamin D_3 orally with\nadequate dietary calcium.^8^,^249 These doses can be given safely either as a\nsingle-day therapy or as daily doses of 2000\u20134000 IUs/day (50\u2013100 \u03bcg/d) for\n3\u20136 mo.^8\n\nChildren one year and older should receive at least 600 IUs of vitamin D\ndaily. The Endocrine Society recommends at least 600 IUs and up to 1000 IUs\ndaily is safe and effective to prevent vitamin D deficiency and\ninsufficiency.^24 Infants and toddlers who received 50,000 IUs of vitamin D_2\nonce a week or 2000 IUs of vitamin D_2 or vitamin D_3 daily for 6 weeks\ncorrected their vitamin D deficiency without any untoward side\neffects.^8^,^24^,^217 A study done in the young Lebanese girls who received\n14,000 IUs of vitamin D weekly for one year were able to maintain their blood\nlevel of 25(OH)D in what is considered to be a healthy physiologic range above\n30 ng/mL.^250\n\nThe Endocrine Society recommends that all adults receive 1500\u20132000 IUs of\nvitamin D daily.^15 A study in healthy adults in Boston who had a baseline\nserum concentration of 25(OH)D ~18 ng/mL in the winter revealed that ingesting\n1000 IUs of vitamin D_2 or vitamin D_3 was ineffective in raising and\nmaintaining blood levels 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL (Fig. 84).^215 This is not at\nall unexpected since it is documented that for every 100 IUs of vitamin D\ningested the circulating concentration of 25(OH)D increases by approximately\n0.6\u20131.0 ng/mL.^215^,^251\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 84.

This strategy has been effective in maintaining blood levels of\n25(OH)D in the range of 40\u201360 ng/mL for up to 6 y without any toxicity (Fig.\n85).^253 Other strategies that have been equally effective have been to take\n50,000 IUs of vitamin D daily for several days followed by maintenance\ntherapy. Patients who have a BMI > 30 often need 3\u20135 times as much vitamin D\nto both treat and prevent recurrence of vitamin D deficiency.^24 Patients with\nmalabsorption syndromes or who have had gastric bypass surgery may require\n50,000 IUs of vitamin D at least up to 7 times a week.^22 Monitoring serum\nlevels of 25(OH)D is important to prevent toxicity. Patients on\nglucocorticoids, anti-seizure medications and AIDS medications may also need\nmore vitamin D to both treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency.^22 Patients\nhowever with granulomatous disorders such as sarcoidosis have a\nhypersensitivity to vitamin D because of the uncontrolled conversion of\n25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)_2D by activated macrophages within the granulomas.

Vitamin D intoxication is associated\nwith hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, suppression of PTH that can lead to\nnephrocalcinosis and soft tissue calcification especially of blood vessels.\nUsually vitamin D intoxication is not observed until a 25(OH)D > 200\nng/mL.^254^-^256\n\nNo matter how much sun exposure a person has this will never cause vitamin D\nintoxication because sunlight itself destroys any excess vitamin D and\nprevitamin D.^256 However there are several reports in adults that ingesting\nup to 1 million IUs of vitamin D_3 daily for several months can raise blood\nlevels of 25(OH)D > 500 ng/mL which was associated with hypercalcemia in the\nrange of 15 mg/dL. Often simply removing all sources of vitamin D along with\nhydration can result in the serum calcium returning to normal within a\nrelatively short period of time and with no sequelae.^254^-^257 A recent\nreport of a 3 mo old inadvertently receiving 14,000 IUs of vitamin D_3 daily\nfor 20 d (i.e., total of 280,000 IUs of vitamin D_3) and achieving a\ncirculating concentration of 25(OH)D of 425 ng/mL with suppression of PTH\ndemonstrated no significant change in either the infant's serum calcium or\nphosphorus level and no change in kidney function demonstrates that short-term\nhigh doses of vitamin D resulting in very high serum concentrations of 25(OH)D\n> 400 ng/mL was well tolerated even in infants.^258 Even pregnant women who\nreceived 4000 IU vitamin D/day through their pregnancy showed no change in\neither serum calcium or urinary calcium secretion.^259 It is prolonged intake\nof extremely high doses of vitamin D for at least several months that not only\nmarkedly increases the circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D > 200 ng/mL but\nalso results in hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and if untreated can lead to\nkidney failure, soft tissue calcification and ultimately death.^22^,^260\n\nGo to:\n\n## Conclusion and Perspective\n\nOur ancestors routinely worshiped the sun for its life giving properties (Fig.\n86).^261^,^262 It is curious that some of the earliest photosynthetic life\nforms for more than 500 million years have been producing vitamin D and that\nthroughout evolution most vertebrates including humans have depended on sun\nexposure for their skeletal health.^263 The driver for the evolution of\nhypopigmented humans i.e., Caucasians is likely due to the need to have more\nvitamin D producing solar UVB radiation to penetrate into the skin to produce\nvitamin D_3. Females born with vitamin D deficiency and suffering from\ninfantile rickets resulted in them having a flat pelvis and a small pelvic\noutlet. These females although fertile would have had a difficult time, if not\nimpossible, to give vaginal birth resulting in both maternal and fetal\ndeath.^54^,^55 Indeed it was because of the vitamin D deficiency pandemic in\nlate 1800s that Cesarean sectioning became common practice for the delivery of\nhealthy children of mothers who had suffered from vitamin D deficiency in\nutero and during their first few years of life.^8^,^54^,^55 Vitamin D\ndeficiency in pregnant women today is still associated with a 400% increase in\nthe predicted probability for a Cesarean section (Fig. 87).^54\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 86. Egyptian painting showing the pharao and the queen being exposed to\nsunshine.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 87. This graph shows the association between mother\u2019s increasing\n25(OH)D level in nmol/L, and decreasing predicted probability of having a\nCesarean section vs. vaginal delivery, with a quadratically fit line. The\npredicted probabilities of Cesarean section are derived from a multivariate\nlogistic regression model controlling for mother\u2019s age, education, insurance\nstatus, and race. Additionally, the model controls for reporting ever drinking\nalcohol during pregnancy, as this was statistically significant in univariate\nanalysis and remained statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level in\nmultivariate analysis.

Not only milk but hot dogs, soda, custard, bread, cereals\nand even beer was fortified with vitamin D (Fig. 9). Schlitz even promoted\ntheir vitamin D fortified beer in the winter with the slogan \u201cif you want to\nkeep sunny energy all winter long drink vitamin D fortified Schlitz beer.\u201d\n(Fig. 88) They may have been correct now with the revelation that vitamin D\ndeficiency was associated with depression, seasonal affective disorder and\nneurocognitive dysfunction.^198^-^200^,^202^,^203^,^210\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 88. Schlitz Beer advertisement with the slogan \u201ckeep sunny energy all\nwinter long drink vitamin D fortified Schlitz beer\u201d from 1936.\n\nUnfortunately in the early 1950s the outbreak of hypercalcemia in British\ninfants, who also had birth defects which included altered facial features,\nmental retardation, and heart problems, was incorrectly attributed to be over\nfortification of milk with vitamin D since it was believed that these were\nsigns of vitamin D intoxication.^20^,^22 The more likely explanation is that\nthese children had a syndrome which is associated with a hypersensitivity to\nvitamin D causing hypercalcemia and also with an elfin appearance and heart\nproblems.^20 However because this \u201coutbreak\u201d was associated with infants who\nhad birth defects and mental retardation laws were quickly passed forbidding\nthe fortification of not only foods but any consumer product including skin\ncream with vitamin D. This legislation was quickly adopted in most European\ncountries and was used as a reason by other countries not to fortify milk with\nvitamin D.\n\nClearly the paranoia about food fortification with vitamin D causing toxicity\nneeds to be reconsidered in light of observations that infants who consumed\n2000 IU vitamin D per day during their first year of life not only did not\nhave any evidence of toxicity but for the ensuing 31 y markedly decreased\ntheir risk for type 1 diabetes.^145\n\nIn the 1970s sunscreens were first introduced as a way to prevent sunburning.\nThe sunscreens contained UVB absorbing chemicals such as paraaminobezoic acid\nbecause it was believed that only UVB radiation damaged the skin and caused\nskin cancer. It is now realized that UVA radiation not only alters the immune\nsystem making it more immunotolerant but also increases risk for non-melanoma\nand melanoma skin cancers. Over the past four decades with very little thought\nas to its consequences, several national and international health\norganizations have condemned any direct sun exposure. The American Academy of\nDermatology has taken the extreme position of recommending that no one should\never be exposed to direct sunlight without sun protection. This radical view\nof sunlight and UVB radiation has led to its designation as a carcinogen. To\nsuggest that one should never be exposed to sunlight because excessive\nexposure to sunlight is linked to an increased risk for non-melanoma skin\ncancer is like suggesting that because breathing 100% oxygen can cause lung\ndamage and death, that no one should breath an atmosphere that contains 20%\noxygen.\n\nThe lack of appreciation of the importance of sensible sun exposure for\nproviding children and adults with their vitamin D requirement has led to a\nworldwide vitamin D deficiency pandemic.^22^,^173 In the United States the\nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 32% of children\nand adults have a circulating concentration of 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL. Reports\nfrom Mexico, South America, Europe, Asia, India and even Africa suggest that\nmore than 50% of the world population is at risk for vitamin D\ndeficiency.^22^,^265^,^266 Even in Australia, the skin cancer capital of the\nworld, it is now recognized that the slip, slap, slop message has led to more\nthan 40% of the population being vitamin D deficient.^265^-^267 Even the\nAustralian Dermatology Society now recommends sensible sun exposure as a\nsource of vitamin D. A study of Australian dermatologists at the end of the\nsummer revealed that 87% had a 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL. More than 90% of the\nphysicians in India were found to be vitamin D deficient.\n\nThe CDC concluded that vitamin D deficiency is becoming more prevalent in the\nUS because of obesity, decrease in the consumption of vitamin D fortified milk\nand increased sun protection.^269 Thus a three-part strategy should be\nemployed worldwide to prevent vitamin D deficiency and its many negative\nhealth consequences (Fig. 89). Sensible sun exposure which is free, eating\nfoods that naturally contain vitamin D or are fortified with vitamin D as well\nas taking a vitamin D supplement should guarantee vitamin D\nsufficiency.^22^,^66 A global strategy to reduce the risk of vitamin D\ndeficiency should be to consider not only increasing programs for food\nfortification not only of dairy products but also juice products, flour, and\nother commonly used food sources. There is no downside to increasing vitamin D\nintake and there could be a substantial upside, i.e., improvement not only of\nmusculoskeletal health but overall health and welfare. It has been estimated\nthat as much as 25% of health care dollars could be saved just by improving\nthe world\u2019s vitamin D status.^78\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 89.
