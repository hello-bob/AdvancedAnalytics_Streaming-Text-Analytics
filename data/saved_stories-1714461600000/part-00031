The news highlights Roku\u2019s growing focus on advertising and an\nalarming trend in the streaming industry that sees ads increasingly forced on\nviewers.\n\nAs spotted by The Streamable, during Roku's Q1 2024 earnings call last week,\nWood, also the company's founder and chairman, boasted about the Roku OS home\nscreen showing users ads \"before they select an app,\" avoiding the possibility\nthat they don't see any ads during their TV-viewing session. (The user might\nonly use Roku to access a video streaming app for which they have an ad-free\nsubscription.)\n\nWood also noted future plans to make the Roku home screen even more ad-laden:\n\n> On the home screen today, there's the premier video app we call the marquee\n> ad and that ad traditionally has been a static ad. We're going to add video\n> to that ad. So that'll be the first video ad that we add to the home screen.\n> That will be a big change for us.\n\nWood's comments didn't address the expected impact on the Roku user experience\nor whether the company thinks this might turn people off its platform. In\nDecember, Amazon made a similar move by adding autoplay video ads to the home\nscreen of the Fire OS (which third-party TVs and Amazon-branded Fire TV sets\nand streaming devices use). Fire OS users who disable the ads' autoplay\nfunction will still see ads as \"a full-screen slide show of image ads,\" per\nAFTVnews. Some users viewed the introduction as an intrusive step that went\ntoo far, and Roku may hear the same feedback.\n\nDuring Roku's earnings call, Wood also said the company is testing \"other\ntypes of video ad units\" and is looking for more ways to bring advertising to\nthe Roku OS home screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis comes after recent efforts to expand ad presence on Roku OS, including\nthrough new FAST (free ad-supported streaming TV) channels and by putting\ncontent recommendations on the home screen for the first time, per Wood, who\nsaid the personalized content row \"will be, obviously, AI-driven\nrecommendations.\"\n\n\"There's lots of ways we're working on enhancing the home screen to make it\nmore valuable to viewers but also increase the monetization on the home\nscreen,\" he said.\n\n## Roku\u2019s revenue rise\n\nRoku saw its average revenue per user (ARPU) drop from $41.03 in Q3 of its\n2023 financial year to $39.92 in Q4 2023 (in Q4 2022, the company reported an\nARPU of $41.68). Last week, Roku reported that ARPU, a key metric for the\nstreaming industry these days, rose to $40.65 in Q1 2024. Meanwhile, Roku's\nactive account count rose by 1.6 million users from the prior quarter to 81.6\nmillion.\n\n\"Roku has a direct relationship with more than 81 million Streaming\nHouseholds, and we are deepening relationships with third-party platforms,\nincluding [demand side platforms], retail media networks, and measurement\npartners. Our business remains well positioned to capture the billions of\ndollars in traditional TV ad budgets that will shift to streaming,\" an April\n25 letter to shareholders [PDF] authored by Wood and Roku CFO Dan Jedda reads.\n\nLike many streaming companies, a shift toward ads has resulted in higher\nrevenue potential and user discontent. In its Q1 2024 results, Roku reported\nthat revenue for its Devices business reached $126.5 million, compared to\n$754.9 for its Platform business, which drives most of its revenue through ad\nsales, representing a 19 percent year-over-year (YoY) increase. Overall,\nrevenue rose 19 percent YoY to $882 million, and Roku's gross profit grew 15\npercent YoY to $388 million.\n\nBut growing revenue doesn't equate to an improved user experience. For\nexample, an Accenture survey of 6,000 \"global consumers\" noted by The\nStreamable found that 52.2 percent of participants thought that streaming\nplatform-recommended content \"did not match their interests.\" Similarly, an\nOctober TiVo survey of 4,500 viewers in the US and Canada ranked \"streaming\napps / home screen / carousel ads\" as the fourth most popular method of\ncontent discovery, after word of mouth, commercials aired during other shows,\nand social media. While Roku is a budget brand associated with more affordable\nTVs and streaming devices, excessive ads could make people reconsider the true\nprice of these savings.\n\nDespite people's ad aversion, Roku intends to find more ways to drive\nadvertising opportunities. Among those ideas being explored is the ability to\nshow ads over anything plugged into the TV.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n127\n\nScharon Harding Scharon is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Product Reviewer writing\nnews, reviews, and analysis on consumer technology, including laptops,\nmechanical keyboards, and monitors.
