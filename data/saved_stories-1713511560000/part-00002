We believe the best builders not only dream\nbut do\u2014and AI is the most thrilling arena to play in.\n\nThe path is exciting but lonely, a vast blue ocean that can seem murky.\nNavigating it alone is tough. That\u2019s why we started Build Club: a second home\nfor top AI founders.\n\nWe\u2019re not tied to any VC, we\u2019re always free, driven purely by our passion for\nAI and a vision to see groundbreaking work come to life.\n\nWe rise by lifting each other. Ready to go hardcore?\n\nApply to the accelerator\n\n-Annie, founder\n\n", "frontpage": false}
