and iPad Pro tablets,\nin a short video posted on its website.\n\n\"This is the biggest day for iPad since its introduction,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook\nsaid.\n\nThe new iPad models are the first Apple has released since Oct. 2022, which is\nthe longest time that Apple has gone without updating the iPad product line\nsince its launch in 2011.\n\nApple shares were flat during trading on Tuesday.\n\nApple's new iPad Pro comes in two sizes, and starts at $999. It also has a new\nadd-on case called Smart Keyboard that makes it feel like a laptop.\n\nThe iPad Pro, Apple's most expensive and advanced tablet, will come in two\nsizes, a 11-inch model and a 13-inch model, Apple said. The company called the\nproduct its thinnest ever, coming in at 5.1mm thick.\n\nThe smaller iPad Pro starts at $999, and the larger 13-inch model starts at\n$1299 with 256GB of storage, a slight price increase from its predecessor.\n\nThe iPad Pro will snap into a new case that Apple calls Magic Keyboard, which\nis made out of aluminum and pairs the tablet with a keyboard and trackpad.\nApple said that using the case will make using an iPad Pro feel similar to a\nlaptop experience, i.e., \"just like a MacBook.\"\n\nApple's new Magic Keyboard accessory.\n\nCNBC/Todd Haselton\n\nThe Magic Keyboard will cost $249 or $299, depending on size. Apple also\nannounced an updated stylus called the Apple Pencil Pro for $129.\n\nThe new iPad models use a new Apple chip called the M4, an update from the M3\nchips that currently power Apple's laptops. Apple said that the M4 chip was a\n\"outrageously powerful chip for AI,\" noting, as an example, its ability to\nhelp power software that isolates subjects from their backgrounds in videos.\n\n\"This stunning design and breakthrough display required we make the leap to\nthe next generation of Apple silicon,\" John Ternus, an Apple hardware\nexecutive said.\n\nApple's new iPad Pro from the back.\n\nCNBC/Todd Haselton\n\nApple said that its iPad Pro tablets will use a new kind of display called the\nOLED \u2014 the same technology Apple uses on its iPhones \u2014 and that the new\ntablets will be brighter and have more vibrant colors than older models. The\ncompany also said it developed a technology called \"tandem OLED\" to create the\nscreens, which are branded as Ultra Retina XDR.\n\nThe company added that the iPad Pro could be a useful tool for professional\nvideo producers, and it announced a new app called Final Cut Camera that can\ncontrol multiple iPhone cameras. The iPad Pro comes with a 12 megapixel rear\ncamera that can record 4K video, according to Apple. The company also\nannounced an update to the camera's flash, which should make scanning\ndocuments easier.\n\nThe new tablets and accessories are up for preorder now and will go on sale\nnext week.\n\nApple's iPad Air starts at $599 and was updated with a faster M2 chip.\n\nCNBC/Todd Haselton\n\nApple said that the iPad Air would come in two sizes: an 11-inch size that\nmatches older models and a larger 13-inch model. Both are equipped with\nApple's M2 chip. The smaller iPad costs $599 for 128GB of storage, and the\nlarger iPad starts at $799.\n\nApple has also moved the front-facing camera to the longer side of the device\n\u2014 landscape mode \u2014 to be better for video conferencing, matching Apple's more-\nexpensive iPad Pro models.\n\nThe iPad Air will be available in stores next week and comes in a variety of\ncolors, including blue, purple, and gold.\n\nApple also dropped the price of its entry-level iPad to $349, a price drop\nfrom its previous $429 price.\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
