From Bloomberg:\n\n> Mark Zuckerberg is asking investors for patience again. Instead, they\u2019re\n> alarmed. After Meta Platforms Inc. revealed that it will spend billions of\n> dollars more than expected this year \u2014 fueled by investments in artificial\n> intelligence \u2014 the company\u2019s chief executive officer did his best to soothe\n> Wall Street. But the spending forecast, coupled with slower sales growth\n> than anticipated, sent the shares tumbling as much as 16% in New York on\n> Thursday morning, the biggest drop since October 2022.\n\n18 months ago I created a meme for exactly this occassion:\n\nI posted that meme in Meta Myths, where I argued that Meta was in far better\nshape than investors realized:\n\n  * Users were not deserting Facebook.\n  * Instagram engagement was growing.\n  * TikTok growth had leveled out.\n  * Digital advertising was recovering from ATT.\n  * Meta\u2019s increase in capital expenditures \u2014 which we now know was mostly for Nvidia GPUs \u2014 was justified.\n\nNotice, though, that the meme implies this happened more than once. Indeed, in\n2018 I had written Facebook Lenses after another stock market meltdown:\n\n  * Using a financial lens, Facebook revenue was in good shape but growing costs were a concern.\n  * Using a product lens, Facebook was in very good shape given the growth opportunities available in its non-Facebook-app properties.\n  * Using an advertising lens, Facebook was in very good shape given the quality of its infrastrcture.\n  * Using a strategic lens, Facebook\u2019s moats were deeper than ever, thanks in part to regulation.\n  * Using a \u201creason-to-exist\u201d lens, Facebook was, as it had been from its founding, underrated by folks who didn\u2019t understand how powerful digitizing the connection between friends and family was.\n\nGiven this history, you might think that I\u2019m here to once again raise the Meta\nflag and declare investors insane; in fact, this time is different: I\nunderstand the market\u2019s reaction and, at least partially, share its skepticism\nabout Meta\u2019s short to medium-term future. The big question is the long run.\n\n### Meta\u2019s Short-Term Capex Costs\n\nThere was one consistent theme across the big tech earnings calls last week:\nspend, baby, spend! From Google\u2019s earnings call:\n\n> With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12\n> billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical\n> infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data\n> centers. The significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters\n> reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our\n> business. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be\n> roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash\n> payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx.\n\nFrom Microsoft\u2019s earnings call:\n\n> Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $14 billion to support\n> our cloud demand, inclusive of the need to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash\n> paid for PP&E was $11 billion. Cash flow from operations was $31.9 billion,\n> up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections...We expect capital\n> expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud\n> and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal\n> quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-\n> outs and the timing of finance leases. We continue to bring capacity online\n> as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI\n> demand is a bit higher than our available capacity.\n\nFrom Meta\u2019s earnings call:\n\n> We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range\n> of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we\n> continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI\n> roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we\n> expect capex will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively\n> to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\n\nThe market reception to Microsoft and Google, though, could not be more\ndifferent than the reaction to Meta; from Bloomberg:\n\n> Microsoft Corp. and Google owner Alphabet Inc. sent a clear message to\n> investors on Thursday: Our spending on artificial intelligence and cloud\n> computing is paying off. The companies trounced Wall Street estimates with\n> their latest quarterly results, lifted by a surge in cloud revenue \u2014 fueled\n> in part by booming use of AI services. Alphabet shares surged as much as\n> 12%, the biggest gain since July 2015, to their highest level ever. The\n> rally pushed Alphabet\u2019s valuation past $2 trillion. Microsoft rose as much\n> as 3.5%.\n>\n> The tech titans have been locked in a fierce battle for dominance in the\n> field of artificial intelligence, with Microsoft joining forces with startup\n> OpenAI to challenge Google\u2019s two-decade stranglehold on internet search. But\n> Thursday\u2019s results showed there\u2019s ample room for both companies to grow.\n\nMicrosoft is the best positioned to benefit from AI in the short-term: first,\nthey have a cloud business in Azure that sells to enterprises eager to\nimplement AI into their businesses; Azure grew 31% with 7 points of that\ngrowth coming from AI services.\n\n^1 Second, they have an enterprise software business that can expand its\naverage revenue per user by selling AI services; Microsoft didn\u2019t report how\nmany CoPilot seat licenses they sold, but they did say it contributed to\nOffice 365\u2019s 15% growth in commercial revenue. These clear opportunities for\nmonetization, along with the potential upside of AI generally, should and do\nmake investors happy about the additional capex investment.\n\nGoogle also clearly benefits from AI, particularly in terms of Google Cloud. I\nwrote a very positive overview of Google Cloud\u2019s prospects earlier this month\nbecause the story is so clear: bringing Google\u2019s massive infrastructure\nadvantages to bear in the Cloud is a very straightforward proposition with\nvery significant upside. Google can not only expand ARPU with existing\ncustomers, but also has a wedge to win new customers, who will then\npotentially shift the rest of their cloud spending to Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle\u2019s consumer story is a bit more complicated: there is obvious consumer\nutility in AI-powered search results, but giving an answer instead of a set of\nlinks is a challenge both to Google\u2019s business model and to its ability to\nserve the entire market without controversy. Even despite those challenges,\nthough, there are benefits in terms of improved recommendations, better ad\ntargeting, generative advertisements, etc. On balance the increased investment\nis clearly worth it.\n\nMeta doesn\u2019t have as many clear applications in terms of short-term revenue\nopportunities: the company does not operate a cloud business, so no one is\nconsuming \u2014 i.e. paying for \u2014 the use of Meta\u2019s capex other than Meta itself.\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s consumer prospects are broadly similar to Google\u2019s:\nyes, Meta can and is improving recommendations and ad targeting and\nimplementing generative advertising, and also has the prospect of making\nclick-to-message ads viable for businesses that can\u2019t afford to pay for a\nhuman on the other end of a chat session. Still, the short-term upside is not\nnearly as clear as it is for Microsoft and Google.\n\n### Meta\u2019s Advertising Cycle and the Mid-Term\n\nThe other big business opportunity Zuckerberg emphasized on the earnings call\nwas MetaAI, which he compared to Stories and Reels:\n\n> You all know our product development playbook by this point. We release an\n> early version of a product to a limited audience to gather feedback and\n> start improving it, and then once we think it\u2019s ready then we make it\n> available to more people. That early release was last fall and with this\n> release we\u2019re now moving to that next growth phase of our playbook. We\n> believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant\n> that you can freely use. And now that we have the superior quality product,\n> we\u2019re making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp,\n> Messenger, Instagram, and Facebook.\n\nBut then what? Zuckerberg offered some vague ideas later in the call:\n\n> I do think that there will be an ability to have ads and paid content in\n> Meta AI interactions over time as well as people being able to pay for,\n> whether it\u2019s bigger models or more compute or some of the premium features\n> and things like that. But that\u2019s all very early in fleshing out.\n\nStories and Reels were not complicated in this regard: sure, Stories ads\nneeded to have a larger visual component than Feed ads, and Reels ads are\nbetter if they are video, but at the end of the day the ad unit is the same\nacross all of Meta\u2019s channels. MetaAI, on the other hand, is going to require\na completely different approach. I\u2019m not saying that Meta won\u2019t figure it out\n\u2014 Google needs to experiment here as well, and one\u2019s experimentation will\nlikely help the other \u2014 but the long-term revenue opportunity is not nearly as\nclearcut as Zuckerberg is painting it out to be.\n\nWhat is clear is that figuring this out will take time, which is a concern\ngiven where Meta is in its advertising cycle. Long-time Stratechery\nsubscribers know that I frequently reference this chart while reviewing Meta\u2019s\nearnings:\n\nThe most important thing to understand about this chart is that the growth in\nimpressions is usually inversely correlated with the growth in price-per-ad,\nwhich makes intuitive sense: more impressions means more supply which, with an\nequivalent amount of demand, results in lower prices. The two big exceptions\nare related to Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency changes: in 2022 the price-\nper-ad decelerated much more quickly than impressions grew, as Meta dealt with\nthe loss of deterministic signal it suffered because of ATT; then, in 2023,\nthe price-per-ad grew even as impressions grew as Meta reworked its targeting\nto operate probabilistically instead of deterministically.\n\nSetting those two anomalies aside, there are two-and-a-half inversions of\nimpression and price-per-ad growth rates on this chart:\n\n  * In 2017 Meta saturated the Instagram feed with ads; this led impressions growth to drop and the price-per-ad to increase; then, in 2018, Instagram started to monetize Stories, leading to increased growth in impressions and corresponding decreases in price-per-ad growth.\n  * In 2020 Meta saturated Instagram Stories; this once again led impressions growth to drop and the price-per-ad to increase; then, while COVID provided a boost in 2021, 2022 saw a significant increase in Reels monetization, leading to increased growth in impressions and a decrease in price-per-ad growth (which, as noted above, was made more extreme by ATT).\n  * Since the middle of last year Meta Impressions growth is once again dropping as Reels becomes saturated; this is leading to an increase in price-per-ad growth (although the lines have not yet crossed).\n\nThe most optimistic time for Meta\u2019s advertising business is, counter-\nintuitively, when the price-per-ad is dropping, because that means that\nimpressions are increasing. This means that Meta is creating new long-term\nrevenue opportunities, even as its ads become cost competitive with more of\nits competitors; it\u2019s also notable that this is the point when previous\ninvestor freak-outs have happened.\n\nNotice, though, that this time is different; CFO Susan Li said on the earnings\ncall:\n\n> One thing I\u2019d share, for example, is that we actually grew conversions at a\n> faster rate than we grew impressions over the course of this quarter. So we\n> are \u2014 we\u2019re expecting to \u2014 which basically suggests that our conversion\n> grade is growing and is one of the ways in which our ads are becoming more\n> performant.\n\nThis is true, but it also means this specific moment in time is a much less\nbullish one for Meta\u2019s advertising business than past stock drops: impressions\ngrowth declining means that price-per-ad is the primary route for revenue\ngrowth, which will happen but will also open the door for more of Meta\u2019s\ncompetitors. Yes, those future advertising opportunities that Zuckerberg\ntalked about will probably lead to another inversion at some point, but not\nonly are those opportunities uncertain as I noted, but they also are quite a\nways in the future (and the bill for GPUs is today).\n\n### Meta\u2019s Long-Term Prospects\n\nThe most interesting thing Zuckerberg said on the earnings call, meanwhile,\nwas about the Metaverse and its relationship to AI:\n\n> In addition to our work on AI, our other long term focus is the metaverse.\n> It\u2019s been interesting to see how these two themes have come together.\n>\n> This is clearest when you look at glasses. I used to think that AR glasses\n> wouldn\u2019t really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic\n> displays \u2014 and I still think that will be awesome and is mature state of the\n> product. But now it seems pretty clear that there\u2019s also a meaningful market\n> for fashionable AI glasses without a display. Glasses are the ideal device\n> for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what\n> you hear, so they have full context on what\u2019s going on around you as they\n> help you with whatever you\u2019re trying to do. Our launch this week of Meta AI\n> with Vision on the glasses is a good example where you can now ask questions\n> about things you\u2019re looking at.\n>\n> One strategy dynamic that I\u2019ve been reflecting on is that an increasing\n> amount of our Reality Labs work is going towards serving our AI efforts. We\n> currently report on our financials as if Family of Apps and Reality Labs\n> were two completely separate businesses, but strategically I think of them\n> as fundamentally the same business with the vision of Reality Labs to build\n> the next generation of computing platforms in large part so that way we can\n> build the best apps and experiences on top of them. Over time, we\u2019ll need to\n> find better ways to articulate the value that\u2019s generated here across both\n> segments so it doesn\u2019t just seem like our hardware costs increase as our\n> glasses ecosystem scales but all the value flows to a different segment.\n\nI have been arguing for a couple of years that generative AI is going to be\ncritical to making the Metaverse a compelling place to be, primarily in the\ncontext of VR; you can make a similar case for AR, particularly in terms of\ntalking to your assistant. It\u2019s interesting that Zuckerberg is making a\nsimilar argument, but backwards: instead of talking about AI costing money\nthat accrues to the hardware division, he is talking about hardware costing\nmoney that accrues to the AI division.\n\nRegardless, the broader point about AI and the metaverse being complements\nseems right to me, and in the long run the metaverse should be the internal\nMeta AI customer that serves a similar function as Microsoft or Google\u2019s cloud\ncustomers in terms of necessitating and monetizing huge amounts of capacity.\nThat, though, is a bit frightening: in Meta Myths I conceded that the\nmetaverse might not amount to anything, but that it was immaterial to the then\nswoon in Meta\u2019s stock. In this case it seems more material: yes, there are\napplications for AI in Meta\u2019s products, but the real upside may depend on\nZuckerberg\u2019s other big bet paying off.\n\nThat, in the end, gets at the real question for Meta shareholders: do you\ntrust Zuckerberg? There was another big Meta sell-off in early 2022, and I\nwrote this in an Update:\n\n> To that end, just as Facebook\u2019s product changes are evidence that TikTok is\n> real competition, today\u2019s stock price drop is also evidence of the benefit\n> of founder control. Meta could have delayed its response to TikTok until ATT\n> worked its way through the system, but instead the company is fundamentally\n> changing its products at the very moment its results are the most impacted\n> by Apple\u2019s changes. The easier decision, particularly for a manager, would\n> have been to wait a quarter or two, when the comps would have been easier,\n> and the excuses clearer, but founders have the freedom to prioritize\n> existential risks over financial ones.\n>\n> Of course they also have the freedom to spend $10 billion on a speculative\n> bet like the Metaverse, an amount that will \u201cincrease meaningfully\u201d in 2022;\n> Meta continues to be first and foremost a bet on Zuckerberg.\n\nI do think that continues to be a bet worth making: Meta met the challenges in\nthe first paragraph \u2014 thanks in part to its last big capex increase \u2014 and is\nmaking the right strategic moves to make that second paragraph pay off, even\nas it doubles down on AI. These are big bets, though, and I understand\nreasonable doubt in the meantime.\n\n  1. One thing to keep in mind with Microsoft\u2019s reporting is that this is where OpenAI spending \u2014 via Azure credits \u2014 shows up on the earnings report\n\n### Share\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n\n### Related\n\nMetaThursday, October 28, 2021\n\nMeta MythsMonday, October 31, 2022\n\nMeta and OpenTuesday, April 23, 2024\n\n# By Ben Thompson\n\nAbout Ben Follow via Email/RSS Twitter\n\n# Stratechery Plus\n\nAbout Stratechery Plus Subscribe Member Forum\n\n# Account\n\n  * Member\n\n  * Delivery Preferences\n  * Manage Account\n  * Sign Out\n\n  * Log In\n  * Sign Up\n\nLoading\n\n# Explore Stratechery\n\n  * Concepts\n  * Companies\n  * Topics\n\n# Archives\n\n  * Articles\n  * Updates\n  * Interviews\n  * Years in Review\n\n# Subscriber\u2019s Daily Update\n\nTuesday, May 7, 2024\n\n# TSMC Earnings, TSMC\u2019s Pricing Mistake, Intel v.
