These patent listings are\ncurrently listed in the FDA\u2019s publication of \u201cApproved Drug Products with\nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d commonly known as the Orange Book, which\nlists drug products approved by the FDA as safe and effective.\n\nTo promote competition, the FTC said it is disputing these patent listings as\nimproper or inaccurate. Improper Orange Book patent listings can delay cheaper\ngeneric alternatives from entering the market, keeping brand name drug prices\nartificially high.\n\n\u201cBy filing bogus patent listings, pharma companies block competition and\ninflate the cost of prescription drugs, forcing Americans to pay sky-high\nprices for medicines they rely on,\u201d said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. \u201cBy\nchallenging junk patent filings, the FTC is fighting these illegal tactics and\nmaking sure that Americans can get timely access to innovative and affordable\nversions of the medicines they need.\u201d\n\nThe warning letters were sent to:\n\n  * AstraZeneca and Novo Nordisk for obesity and type-2 diabetes injectable drugs\n  * Boehringer Ingelheim, Covis Pharma, Glaxo-Smith Kline, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and some of their subsidiaries for asthma and COPD inhalers\n  * Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc. for a glucagon nasal spray to treat severe hypoglycemia in type-1 diabetics\n\nWhen the listing of a patent is disputed under FDA regulations, as the FTC has\ndone here, the FDA will send the dispute to the branded drug manufacturer who\nwill then have 30 days to withdraw or amend the listing, or certify under\npenalty of perjury that the listing complies with applicable statutory and\nregulatory requirements.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of branded drug manufacturers to ensure that Orange\nBook submissions contain information only on the types of patents for which\ninformation should be submitted to FDA,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Robert M.\nCaliff, M.D. \u201cThe FDA will continue to engage with the FTC to identify and\naddress potential efforts to impede competition so that consumers can get\naccess to the medicines they need.\u201d\n\nThe FTC\u2019s latest patent listing dispute filings come after the Commission\nchallenged over 100 patent listings in November for medications specific to\nasthma and other inhaler devices, Restasis multidose bottles, and epinephrine\nautoinjectors. The Commission\u2019s November challenges led to Kaleo Inc., Impax\nLabs, GlaxoSmithKline, and Glaxo Group delisting patents in response to the\nFTC\u2019s warning letters. Subsequently, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, and\nGlaxoSmithKline all announced commitments to cap inhaler out-of-pocket costs\nat $35.\n\nIn September 2023, the FTC issued a policy statement that warned that the\nagency would be scrutinizing the improper submission of patents for listing in\nthe Orange Book. According to the policy statement, costs associated with\nchallenging improperly listed patents can disincentivize investments in\ndeveloping generic drugs, which risks delaying or thwarting competitive\ngeneric alternatives.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission develops policy initiatives on issues that affect\ncompetition, consumers, and the U.S. economy. The FTC will never demand money,\nmake threats, tell you to transfer money, or promise you a prize.
