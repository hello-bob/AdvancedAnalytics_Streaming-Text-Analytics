Research supports this\nconclusion. Some scientists believe that the human body has a set point weight\nthat it returns to. If you lose weight, your body may work to put it back on.\n\nAlthough there is evidence for the set point theory, other factors in weight\nloss are important too. And studies show it is possible to lose weight and\nkeep it off.\n\n## Set Point Theory\n\nSet point theory states that the human body tries to maintain its weight\nwithin a preferred range. Many people stay within a more or less small range\nof body weight throughout their adult life. Some people's systems may keep\nthem lean while young but allow them to gain weight after middle age.\n\nIn set point theory, if you suddenly start eating fewer calories, the way your\nbody burns fuel (your metabolism) will slow down. You will burn fewer calories\neven if your activity level does not change. Your body may also change the way\nit absorbs nutrients. Your hormones could change and make you hungrier. These\nfactors could make it easy for you to put weight back on.\n\nThe idea of a set point weight is just a theory because there is no real\nproof. Researchers have observed that many humans return to a certain weight\nrange, but scientific studies of weight are difficult. It's hard to control\nwhat human subjects eat. Instead, most studies rely on self-reporting, which\ncan be inaccurate.\n\n## Set Point and Weight Gain\n\nIf your body helps you regain weight that you have lost, shouldn't it help you\nlose weight when you gain? If we have a system that regulates body fat, why is\nit so easy to put on pounds? Scientists have worked to answer these questions.\n\nBiologists say that throughout history, starvation has been one of the\ngreatest threats to humans. Our bodies developed a way to protect us against\nstarvation by holding onto fat. Only in recent years has obesity become a\nhealth threat. Possibly our bodies have not yet evolved to address that\nchallenge.\n\n## What Happens When You Cut Calories\n\nReducing the calories you eat triggers several changes in the body. Some of\nthese changes make it hard to keep weight off.\n\nLower calorie burn. Having a smaller body means that you use fewer calories.\nYou may have to cut your intake again in order to keep your weight from\nreturning.\n\nHormonal adjustments. Your levels of leptin may go down. Leptin is the hormone\nthat makes you feel full. You may have to eat more to feel full. You may\nexperience rises in ghrelin, the \"hunger hormone.\" Your appetite may increase.\n\nFocus on food. People who restrict calories often think about food more often.\nResearch suggests that their sense of smell may be enhanced. When food smells\nand tastes better, we often eat more.\n\n## Problems With Set Point Theory\n\nSet point theory can't explain several patterns of weight gain that scientists\nhave observed. These patterns suggest that what's going on in a person's life\nmay be as important in determining weight as the body's set point. Scientists\nhave seen that:\n\n  * College students often gain weight.\n  * Children who watch a lot of television are more likely to be obese.\n  * People often gain weight after marriage.\n  * In Western countries, less affluent people have higher levels of obesity.\n  * People often become heavier after moving from Asia to the West.\n\n## Set Point After Weight Loss Surgery\n\nWe may be able to learn more about set point weight by studying people who\nhave had weight loss surgery. Does the surgery change their set point so that\ntheir bodies are \"happier\" at a lower weight?\n\nWeight loss often triggers slower metabolism and larger appetites. Some\nresearchers say that weight loss surgery does not seem to have the same\nimpact. Scientific studies in humans are lacking. One animal study supports\nthe theory that weight-loss surgery could change the set point.\n\n## How to Keep Weight Off\n\nEven if set point theory is correct, losing weight and keeping it off is\npossible. Avoiding fad diets and losing weight slowly may change your set\npoint. It may give your body time to adjust to your new way of eating. You may\nbe more successful if you get help from a therapist or dietitian.\n\nRecent research shows that about 20% of dieters keep the weight off. The\nNational Weight Control Registry tracks people who have lost at least 30\npounds and have kept it off for at least one year. These individuals regularly\nanswer questions about how they keep the weight from coming back.\n\nThe data so far shows that people are more successful with long-term weight\nloss after a \"medical trigger\" \u2014 a warning about their health. Also,\n\nmembers of the registry practiced these behaviors, which may be tied to\nkeeping weight off:\n\n  * They weighed themselves regularly, often daily.\n  * They attacked small weight gains before they became large gains.\n  * They ate breakfast, often cereal and fruit.\n  * They exercised around an hour a day, often by walking.\n  * They ate a low-calorie, low-fat diet.\n  * They were consistent in sticking to their eating plan, even on weekends and holidays.\n\nPeople who regain weight often blame a lack of willpower. Researchers have\nfound that willpower plays a role in weight control, but that role is\nrelatively small. Other factors are more important.\n\nShare\n\nView privacy policy, copyright and trust info\n\nShare\n\nView privacy policy, copyright and trust info\n\nNext Why Can't I Lose Weight?\n\n### More on Weight Loss & Obesity\n\n#### Understanding Obesity: Risk Factors and More\n\n#### 15 Numbers That Matter as Much as Your Weight\n\n#### Calculate Your BMI & Healthy Weight Range\n\nRecommended\n\n### FEATURED\n\n### Related Links\n\n  * Weight Loss & Obesity News\n  * Weight Loss & Obesity Reference\n  * Weight Loss & Obesity Slideshows\n  * Weight Loss & Obesity Quizzes\n  * Weight Loss & Obesity Videos\n  * Food & Fitness Planner\n  * More Related Topics\n\n### Sign up for our free Good Health Newsletter\n\n#### Get wellness tips to help you live happier and healthier\n\n## Thanks for subscribing!\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, I agree to the WebMD Terms & Conditions & Privacy\nPolicy and understand that I may opt out of WebMD subscriptions at any time.\n\n### Follow WebMD on Social Media\n\n### Download WebMD App\n\nPolicies\n\nAbout\n\nOur Apps\n\nFor Advertisers\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Editorial Policy\n  * Advertising Policy\n  * Correction Policy\n  * Manage Preferences\n  * Terms of Use\n\n\u00a9 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.
