In this work we develop an iterative approach that optimizes the\n> preference between competing generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) candidates by\n> optimizing for winning vs. losing reasoning steps that lead to the correct\n> answer. We train using a modified DPO loss (Rafailov et al., 2023) with an\n> additional negative log-likelihood term, which we find to be crucial. We\n> show reasoning improves across repeated iterations of this scheme. While\n> only relying on examples in the training set, our approach results in\n> increasing accuracy for Llama-2-70B-Chat from 55.6% to 81.6% on GSM8K (and\n> 88.7% with majority voting out of 32 samples), from 12.5% to 20.8% on MATH,\n> and from 77.8% to 86.7% on ARC-Challenge, which outperforms other\n> Llama-2-based models not relying on additionally sourced datasets.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.19733 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.19733v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.19733arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Jason Weston [view email] [v1] Tue, 30 Apr 2024 17:28:05 UTC (8,118 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Iterative Reasoning Preference Optimization, by\nRichard Yuanzhe Pang and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
