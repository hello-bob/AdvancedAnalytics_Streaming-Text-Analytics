It will also stop law enforcement\u2019s ability to obtain and use this\nevidence in investigations to prevent and prosecute the most serious crimes\nsuch as child sexual abuse, human trafficking, drug smuggling, homicides,\neconomic crime and terrorism offences.\n\nThe declaration, published today and supported by Europol and the European\nPolice Chiefs, comes as end-to-end encryption has started to be rolled out\nacross Meta\u2019s messenger platform.\n\n  * Joint Declaration of the European Police Chiefs (pdf)\n\nEuropol\u2019s Executive Director Catherine De Bolle, said:\n\n> Our homes are becoming more dangerous than our streets as crime is moving\n> online. To keep our society and people safe, we need this digital\n> environment to be secured. Tech companies have a social responsibility to\n> develop a safer environment where law enforcement and justice can do their\n> work. If police lose the ability to collect evidence, our society will not\n> be able to protect people from becoming victims of crime.\n\nThis Joint Declaration was agreed upon at an informal meeting of the European\nChiefs of Police in London hosted by the National Crime Agency on 18 April.\n\nPolice Chiefs of all EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries were\ninvited, alongside Europol\u2019s Executive Director.\n\nEarlier that week, Catherine De Bolle met in with Graeme Biggar, Director of\nthe UK National Crime Agency, as part of regular, strategic exchanges on\ncooperation between Europol and the United Kingdom following the country\u2019s\ndeparture from the European Union.\n\n## Downloads\n\n  * Joint Declaration of the European Police Chiefspdfen(62.2 KB)\n\n## Tags\n\n  *     * EU Police Cycle (EMPACT)\n  *     * Press Release/News\n  * Press Release\n  *     * United Kingdom\n\n## Empact\n\nThe European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT)\ntackles the most important threats posed by organised and serious\ninternational crime affecting the EU.
