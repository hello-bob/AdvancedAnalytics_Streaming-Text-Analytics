In his email\nto me, he writes: \u201cI\u2019ve been pondering privacy consent for more than a decade,\nand I think I finally made a breakthrough with this article.\u201d His mini-\nabstract:\n\n> In this Article I argue that most of the time, privacy consent is\n> fictitious. Instead of futile efforts to try to turn privacy consent from\n> fiction to fact, the better approach is to lean into the fictions. The law\n> can\u2019t stop privacy consent from being a fairy tale, but the law can ensure\n> that the story ends well. I argue that privacy consent should confer less\n> legitimacy and power and that it be backstopped by a set of duties on\n> organizations that process personal data based on consent.\n\nFull abstract:\n\n> Consent plays a profound role in nearly all privacy laws. As Professor Heidi\n> Hurd aptly said, consent works \u201cmoral magic\u201d\u2014it transforms things that would\n> be illegal and immoral into lawful and legitimate activities. As to privacy,\n> consent authorizes and legitimizes a wide range of data collection and\n> processing.\n>\n> There are generally two approaches to consent in privacy law. In the United\n> States, the notice-and-choice approach predominates; organizations post a\n> notice of their privacy practices and people are deemed to consent if they\n> continue to do business with the organization or fail to opt out. In the\n> European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) uses the\n> express consent approach, where people must voluntarily and affirmatively\n> consent.\n>\n> Both approaches fail. The evidence of actual consent is non-existent under\n> the notice-and-choice approach. Individuals are often pressured or\n> manipulated, undermining the validity of their consent. The express consent\n> approach also suffers from these problems people are ill-equipped to decide\n> about their privacy, and even experts cannot fully understand what\n> algorithms will do with personal data. Express consent also is highly\n> impractical; it inundates individuals with consent requests from thousands\n> of organizations. Express consent cannot scale.\n>\n> In this Article, I contend that most of the time, privacy consent is\n> fictitious. Privacy law should take a new approach to consent that I call\n> \u201cmurky consent.\u201d Traditionally, consent has been binary\u2014an on/off switch\u2014but\n> murky consent exists in the shadowy middle ground between full consent and\n> no consent. Murky consent embraces the fact that consent in privacy is\n> largely a set of fictions and is at best highly dubious.\n>\n> Because it conceptualizes consent as mostly fictional, murky consent\n> recognizes its lack of legitimacy. To return to Hurd\u2019s analogy, murky\n> consent is consent without magic. Rather than provide extensive legitimacy\n> and power, murky consent should authorize only a very restricted and weak\n> license to use data. Murky consent should be subject to extensive regulatory\n> oversight with an ever-present risk that it could be deemed invalid. Murky\n> consent should rest on shaky ground. Because the law pretends people are\n> consenting, the law\u2019s goal should be to ensure that what people are\n> consenting to is good. Doing so promotes the integrity of the fictions of\n> consent. I propose four duties to achieve this end: (1) duty to obtain\n> consent appropriately; (2) duty to avoid thwarting reasonable expectations;\n> (3) duty of loyalty; and (4) duty to avoid unreasonable risk. The law can\u2019t\n> make the tale of privacy consent less fictional, but with these duties, the\n> law can ensure the story ends well.\n\nTags: academic papers, GDPR, privacy\n\nPosted on April 24, 2024 at 7:05 AM \u2022 35 Comments\n\n  * Two clicks for more privacy: The Facebook Like button will be enabled once you click here.

I\nsee two main reasons to collect data that isn\u2019t absolutely directly necessary:\nadvertising revenue and government control. Both are poor reasons to collect\ndata. Privacy should be the default, period. If anyone wants to collect more\ndata than is strictly necessary they should have to show why it is needed and\nthe users should have to explicitly accept it. Making data collection painful\nto the end user is a good thing. That will make the incentive to allow extra\ndata collection balanced towards privacy.\n\nAndrew Duane \u2022 April 24, 2024 8:55 AM\n\nIsn\u2019t #3 similar to what they had in the UK?

And of course those companies who make billions from our wild\nwest frontier of data regulations will fight tooth and nail against it.

Tmobile would argue that it is unreasonable to\nrun their business with no risk of employees being able to sim swap for\ncriminals, for example 2. There needs to be an executive level mandatory\ncustodial penalty for unecessarily held PII being leaked. Need to prove a new\ncustomer\u2019s identity, Mr Bank? Sure, but retaining that passport image beyond\nthat validation is unecessary.\n\nMarko \u2022 April 24, 2024 10:34 AM\n\nConsent.

Under the GDPR, if express consent is\nnot feasible for your thousands of downstream users, then you have no consent,\nand are not allowed to do what you want to do. Your business model is simply\nwrong, or rather, illegal.\n\n> Rather than provide extensive legitimacy and power, murky consent should\n> authorize only a very restricted and weak license to use data.\n\nI obviously do not understand what is meant here. But, if you collect PII from\nmillions of people there are pretty few legitimate, ie, desired by the\n\u201cconsenter\u201d, use cases where you would really need to address all these people\npersonally. If you make the data non-identifiable (which is very hard, I\nknow), most of the privacy problems go away.\n\nSo, if you want to sell data downstream, make them anonymous. If you can\u2019t,\ndon\u2019t do it\n\n> duty to avoid unreasonable risk\n\nActually, I would consider those originally collecting the data to be fully\nresponsible for everything that happens with the data. Even if they have long\nsold the data on and the wrongs happen downstream. That gives consenters a\ndirect point to get redress.\n\nIf you take a risk with people\u2019s safety, you should fully pay for it when it\ngoes wrong. If you can\u2019t pay for the risk, you are certainly unqualified to do\nwhatever you did.\n\nlurker \u2022 April 24, 2024 1:03 PM\n\n\u201cMurky consent should be subject to extensive regulatory oversight\u201d\n\nThe gummint imposing \u201cduty\u201d on people?

Common law firmly protects your right to control\nyour \u2018tangible\u2019 physical property, BUT NOT intangible non-physical \u2018data\u2019.\n\nPatent & Copyright Laws are exceptions, and do establish an \u2018intellectual-\nproperty-right\u2019 to some intangible data.\n\nHowever, PATENT/COPYRIGHT has always been a chaotic mess, full of abuses on\nall sides, and a costly nightmare economically and legally.\n\nBottomline: legislators cannot even legally define \u201cPrivacy\u201d and there is no\nrational method for the govvernment to intervene and \u2018solve\u2019 this issue for\nthe public.\n\nErdem Memisyazici \u2022 April 25, 2024 12:42 AM\n\nI think it\u2019s important to distinguish between subjective privacy and objective\nprivacy when we discuss the subject.

Something that people won\u2019t want to keep around unless they have a\nspecific compelling use case for. Maybe make civil damages rather harsh if I\u2019m\nharmed as a result of actions a 2nd or 3rd party take with data that 2nd party\ncollected about me unless they can show a compelling benefit to me that\nresults from them keep that date.\n\necho \u2022 April 26, 2024 8:38 PM\n\n> Both approaches fail.

I find almost all US based writers and\nthinkers don\u2019t get this which is why they have so much trouble finding a point\nof view where they argue their way into believing they have squared the circle\nbefore failing spectacularly. This isn\u2019t the first article or policy reference\nby Bruce which I\u2019ve found dodgy because of this.\n\nI think some US based people are beginning to get a slight clue. As per\n@Winter\u2019s comment about US law not being developed in all honesty US human\nrights protection in law and at an institutional level is very crude or none\nexistent which is causing a lot of Supreme Court and political problems\ncurrently, and I\u2019ve noticed some Americans understanding this.\n\nI had a ding dong with a lawyer who trained under one of of America\u2019s most\nsenior judges over bringing international human rights law into US law. They\nresisted because it was \u201csettled law\u201d. So was Roe v Wade and look what\nhappened there. Then there\u2019s the resistance to the International Criminal\nCourt. I\u2019ve learned the current resistance isn\u2019t at a Presidential or foreign\noffice level but in the US DOD.\n\nThere are some things Europe does which are simply better than the US. Sure,\nthe US civil rights movement and other initiatives are very noteworthy and\nhave had a lot of positive influence worldwide to varying degrees. I just\nthink the US needs to onboard some things from where they are done better. It\nwould solve a lot of problems.\n\nWinter \u2022 April 27, 2024 12:44 AM\n\n@echo\n\n> I just think the US needs to onboard some things from where they are done\n> better.\n\nThe US taking an example from others?\n\nThe Pope joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church sounds more likely.\n\nJonKnowsNothing \u2022 April 27, 2024 3:01 AM\n\n@Winter, @echo, All\n\nre: US enactment probability: The Devil went down to Georgia (1)\n\nThe historical and cultural contexts of the USA and other countries globally\nmake the likelihood of USA adopting legal standards from other countries near\nNIL.\n\nOur basic laws decent from English laws, but that ended in 1776. After that We\nDid It Our Way. And that way is not in accordance with anyone else on the\nplanet. No other country sets up their system like we do. There maybe some\naspects, but for the most part other countries know our system is FUBAR.\n\nWe do not have the legal or political infrastructure to make such adaptations.\nAnything we bring in, has to mold into a Murrican Version. After the Murrican\nconversion, there is little left to find of the original concept.\n\nAn example of how hard it is to separate out our mythos from our de facto\nlegal systems, is found over on Marcy Wheeler\u2019s site (2), which specializes in\ndetailed analysis of USA Court Cases based on the legal filings. There are\nmany knowledgeable folks posting comments but there is only 1 person with\nactual legal experience. Recently, there has been a falling out between the\nOne and the rest of the commentators and the site moderators. The One has more\nthorns than a jumping cactus and is well able to spear the \u201cmythos\u201d from the\n\u201cactual court system\u201d. This does not sit well with the folks who believe the\nmythos is the way of the court system.\n\nNo matter how much the folks proposing \u201cmythos\u201d solutions, there is only the\nOne tossing thorns into their imaginings. It\u2019s not so much that the other are\nuninformed but we are woefully uninformed about how the courts work vs how we\nthink they should to work.\n\nSo, while we might want to \u201cthink this is what should happen\u201d, it isn\u2019t going\nto happen because it has to fit into the Murrican Version.\n\n> When the Devil finished, Johnny said\n>\n> \u201cWell, you\u2019re pretty good ol\u2019 son\n>\n> But sit down in that chair right there\n>\n> And let me show you how it\u2019s done\u201d\n>\n> ...\n>\n> He played \u201cFire on the Mountain,\u201d run, boys, run\n>\n> The Devil\u2019s in the house of the risin\u2019 sun\n>\n> The chicken in the bread pan pickin\u2019 out dough\n>\n> Granny, will your dog bite?

The American public was least able to\npredict the outcome, much less so than Europeans.\n\nRegretfully, I have never been able to find that study. However, every time I\nlooked at any application of the law in the USA, it has struck me that\nabsolutely no-one will admit to have any idea about the outcome of a court\ncase whatever the material facts and law are.\n\nI have never seen this in court cases in any of the continental European\ncountries. It can be that the material facts and law are ambiguous, but if\nthere is consensus about the law and the facts, I rarely see surprises in the\noutcomes.\n\nJonKnowsNothing \u2022 April 27, 2024 1:40 PM\n\n@Winter, All\n\nre: outcome of a court case whatever the material facts and law are\n\nWhile the One Prickly Pear from AZ might shoot a bunch of Cholla spines in my\ndirection, I would hazard that the biggest problem is\n\n  * We do NOT know what the law is\n\nWe know what we think the law is but we do not know exactly what the law says.\nIt\u2019s the mythos vs actual problem.\n\nA poor summary:\n\nWe start with 2 root nodes: Civil / Criminal. They have completely different\nrules about how they function and what their function is for and how it is\napplied.\n\nThe civil branch is perhaps the easiest to navigate intellectually as it is\ncontract law. Contract laws are well established and have a global history\n(trade). ElMusko found out that contract laws are absolute; it wasn\u2019t how he\nthought it was. ElMusko thinks this branch will work better in Texas; it\nwon\u2019t.\n\nThe criminal branch is the one that drives headlines. It\u2019s full of nuances and\nterminology not in the common vocabulary (see Latin).\n\nThis is replicated in each State (50 first nodes). Each state is different in\nevery aspect; different rules, procedures and processes.\n\nNext replicate the first nodes to all counties within a state. Some states\nhave more counties than others so the widths of these node will vary. Each has\nits own rules and procedures.\n\nNext replication is to cities. Some cities will have an aggregator court but\nthe rules are by city. The width of this node is variable by the number of\ncities and number of aggregator courts. Each if these has its own laws,\nprocedures and processes.\n\nWithin this entire matrix are legal representatives for contesting parties,\nspecializing in specific case types, and payment structures. Cases represented\nby Officials are paid for by the citizens; everyone else pays out of pocket.\n\nThen we come to the real odd ball in the matrix: The Grand Jury System. (1)\n\nWhen I first learned about the Grand Jury System as a young person taking US\nCivic Classes in school, my jaw fell on the desk. It was one of the founding\nfather\u2019s biggest complaints about remaining Loyal English Subjects was their\ntreatment under the English Courts Grand Jury version. Yet they included this\nas part of our founding system was just eye popping.\n\nNo one really knows much about this system other than the basics. It\u2019s totally\nsecret. It\u2019s a kangaroo court. There is only one side presenting a case: the\nprosecution (ex parte). The people called to the court have no right to legal\nadvice once they enter the doors to the room. The only thing I remember is\nthis:\n\n  * If you answer ONE question; you must answer ALL questions\n\nYou can declare Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination but that\nwon\u2019t help much.\n\nFrom what little I know about it, there are no other courts in any country as\nbad as this one, except for US military courts which have their own entire\nbranches of laws, procedures and processes and punishments for every branch of\nthe military.\n\n  * The law is not what you think it is.\n\n=== 1)\n\nht tps:/ /e n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States\n\nWinter \u2022 April 27, 2024 3:17 PM\n\n@JonKnowsNothing\n\n> We do NOT know what the law is\n\nActually, it is impossible to know what the law of the US is.\n\nThere are more than 88,000 federal rules and regulations (since 1995), 30,000\nstatues enacted (since 1789), and more than 4,000 laws.[1]\n\nAnother publication [2] counts almost 50,000 federal laws.\n\nIt is not possible to know them all, let alone know and understand the case\nlaw needed under the US common law system.\n\nIt always amazes me when in some US lawyer movie a case is won by digging up\nsome esoteric obscure case law no one ever heard of, not even the judge in the\ncase.

That must have made quite an impression about\nthe criminal system.\n\nThen the Sacklers getting away with killing more Americans than SARS.\n\nThe recent comedy about jury selection for Trump\u2019s trial was also awe\ninspiring.\n\nJonKnowsNothing \u2022 April 27, 2024 5:31 PM\n\n@Winter, All\n\nre: televised live streamed live blogged courtrooms\n\nThis is a fairly new aspect to open public viewing of what takes place in a\ncourtroom.\n\nMost of the streams are ignored by the public and are only of interest to the\nparticipants, especially since C19.\n\nThere have \u201calways\u201d been high vis witch hunts that grab the public attention,\nnot just in the USA. It\u2019s something in our psyche of schadenfreude that makes\nus hope that the \u201cdirty dastards get theirs...\u201d. Sometimes it happens.\n\nThere are overlaps of cultural ethos that gravitate around such trials. What\nis acceptable in 1600 is not in 2024. The most horrendous miscarriages of\nlegal process happen when cultural ethos interferes with the concept of legal\nprocess. At the time it\u2019s hard to separate out the facts from the culturally\naccepted manners of the time.\n\n  * The OJ Simpson trial was overflowing with cultural problems and the courts at the time were unprepared for the intensity of public interest. The Media TV legal advice was by and large incorrect. It was a lot of \u201cwhat I think\u201d mythos.\n\nTo examine this aspect recast all the names with non-entities and play with\nvarious gender and race configurations. In the USA at that time mixed race\ncouples had a lot of negative push back. The majority of people having been\nborn ~1900. It makes a difference with or without the gloves.\n\n  * The Sackler Family bribes on a monstrous scale\n\nAbout the only thing that is of similar magnitude was the British Opium Trade\nWars to maintain British dominance as primary supplier. They got Hong Kong and\nfree access to addict as many people as they could. The British don\u2019t like\nbeing called out as Opium Trade Kings much now, but they certainly owned that\ntitle for a long time.\n\nThe British did their work with weapons. The Sackler\u2019s used Austerity\nLibertarian Economic bribes to get their dominion. Billions of USD fed into\nthe Global Health Care System in the USA, UK and EU. The MDs of today are the\nDrug Pushers for Global Addiction. Of course, they don\u2019t like to be called out\non it either. The Governments took bribes in ginormous amounts via \u201clegal\u201d\ntaxation allowances direct and indirect.\n\nThe US Tobacco Industry had a free ride on the same principle. We eventually\npassed laws in the US limiting their influence here but gave open trade\npermission for them to wreak havoc in other countries by selling their\nproducts overseas. Not many are still looking at them.\n\n  * Dec37 the courtrooms of the USA will be filled with drama until 2025 and beyond.\n\nThe outcomes of the court cases for Dec37 will be varied and the Last Singer\nwon\u2019t be on stage for many years. One can expect 30-50 years before it is\n\u201csettled\u201d. However, the same forces that drive Thousand Year Wars and Million\nYear Wars are still at work. It will never be settled.\n\nLike the Irish Question, it is a question of time. Time is infinite. We are\nfinite.\n\n  * What kind of people are we\n  *     * What kind of people do we want to be\n  *     *       * What kind of person am I\n\nWhen you are sworn into a USA jury pool, you take an oath to follow only what\nthe Judge says it\u2019s OK to follow. Everything else is jettisoned for that time\nand place.\n\nThe only overriding rule is:\n\n> The presumption of innocence is a legal principle that every person accused\n> of any crime is considered innocent until proven guilty.\n>\n> Under the presumption of innocence, the legal burden of proof is thus on the\n> prosecution, which must present compelling evidence to the trier of fact (a\n> judge or a jury).\n>\n> If the prosecution does not prove the charges true, then the person is\n> acquitted of the charges.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a bit of a cliche now, as so much is promoted as Guilty Until You\nProve Otherwise under our Global Surveillance System, it still holds in US\nCourts Federal and State.\n\n  * Every person accused of any crime is considered innocent until proven guilty. Means ANY Crime, no matter what type or situation.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough standard for many to hold to. Those that are honest about their\nviews indicate that and are sent home.

It\u2019s a happy\nmythos propaganda line used by which ever side is holding the assets.\n\nConsider: Looted Art\n\nOver hundreds of years, countries have looted art from conquered nations. For\nnations that had embargo laws (Egyptian Antiquities) it did not stop the\nlooting but it does not give ownership to the current holder. Most of this is\nsitting in the the major museums of the world. This is the visible end of the\ntrail. A lot more sits in private collections that only surface at an auction.\n\nProvenance, where something came from, has a long trail. It may take hundreds\nof years to unwind the false paper trail. Eventually it unwinds.\n\nConsider: Confiscated Lands (1,2)\n\nColonial Europe was a great at taking land for their own based on Laws of\nDiscovery. All you needed to do was plant a flag and declaim the lands\nbelonged to the Kings and Queens of Europe. For the USA, we just took the\nlands: no declaiming necessary.\n\nLand titles have long trails of provenance. Taking something that is \u201cnot\nyours by fiat declaration\u201d does not end well. It may take hundreds of years to\nresolve. Eventually the mythos clears away and the actual laws come into play.\n\nAssets forfeited during wars are highly subject to such changes. There are\nmany methods to hide the source of the funds or to clean the title but it is a\nrisky investment.\n\nConsider:\n\n  * Would you be willing to buy a flat in a building constructed with confiscated assets?\n\n===\n\n1)\n\nh t tps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadastre\n\n  * A cadastre or cadaster is a comprehensive recording of the real estate or real property\u2019s metes-and-bounds of a country.

Cadastres are used by many nations around the world, some in conjunction with other records, such as a title register.\n\n2)\n\nht tps:/ /en.w ikipedia.org/wiki/Land_title\n\n  * In property law, title is an intangible construct representing a bundle of rights in (to) a piece of property in which a party may own either a legal interest or equitable interest.\n  * The rights in the bundle may be separated and held by different parties. It may also refer to a formal document, such as a deed, that serves as evidence of ownership.\n  * Conveyance of the document (transfer of title to the property) may be required in order to transfer ownership in the property to another person.\n  * Title is distinct from possession, a right that often accompanies ownership but is not necessarily sufficient to prove it (for example squatting).\n\nWinter \u2022 April 28, 2024 5:50 AM\n\n@JonKnowsNothing\n\n> The law is not what you think it is for confiscated assets.\n\nActually, according to current law, the Russian money cannot be used for\nrebuilding Ukraine, it cannot be used at all. It is not even confiscated.\nHowever, laws can be changed and if a country engages in large scale war\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing, and genocide, a lot becomes possible.\n\nAs the money is in places under the jurisdiction and reach of the Western\nalliance, we get into the realm of Possession is 9/10ths of the Law. And for a\ncountry that does not respect any law, Russia certainly do not have the moral\nhigh ground.\n\nIt is not like Russia had any problems with stealing everything they could lay\ntheir hands on.

George Washington was part of that campaign and\nfrom some sources, his vanity was snubbed by the British Officer Class as he\ncould not get a commission in the English Redcoat armies and was stuck in the\nlower class Bluecoat Colonial army.\n\nHowever, the US would not have lasted out the 1776 war without the direct aid\nof France.

France was a long-term historical rival with the Kingdom of Great Britain, from which the Colonies were attempting to separate.\n  * A Treaty of Alliance between the French and the Continental Army followed in 1778, which led to French money, mat\u00e9riel and troops being sent to the United States.\n\n  * An ignition of a global war with Britain started shortly thereafter. Subsequently, Spain and the Dutch Republic also began to send assistance, which, along with other political developments in Europe, left the British with no allies during the conflict (excluding the Hessians). Spain openly declared war in 1779, and war between British and Dutch followed soon after.\n\n2)\n\nht tps:/ /en.w ikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette\n\n  * Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, Marquis de La Fayette (6 September 1757 \u2013 20 May 1834), known in the United States as Lafayette, was a French aristocrat and military officer who volunteered to join the Continental Army, led by General George Washington, in the American Revolutionary War. Lafayette was ultimately permitted to command Continental Army troops in the decisive siege of Yorktown in 1781, the Revolutionary War\u2019s final major battle that secured American independence.\n  * After returning to France, Lafayette became a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830 and continues to be celebrated as a hero in both France and the United States.\n\n3)\n\nhtt ps:// en.wiki pedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Plains_of_Abraham\n\n  * The Battle of the Plains of Abraham, also known as the Battle of Quebec (French: Bataille des Plaines d\u2019Abraham, Premi\u00e8re bataille de Qu\u00e9bec), was a pivotal battle in the Seven Years\u2019 War (referred to as the French and Indian War to describe the North American theatre). The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought on a plateau by the British Army and Royal Navy against the French Army, just outside the walls of Quebec City on land that was originally owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin\n  * General James Wolfe successfully resisted the column advance of French troops and Canadian militia under General Louis-Joseph, Marquis de Montcalm. Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle\n\n4)\n\nht tps:/ /en.w ikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Acadians\n\n  * The Expulsion of the Acadians was the forced removal between 1755 and 1764 by Britain of inhabitants of the North American region historically known as Acadia. It included the modern Canadian Maritime provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, along with the U.S. state of Maine. The Expulsion occurred during the French and Indian War, the North American theatre of the Seven Years\u2019 War.\n  * Prior to 1758, Acadians were deported to the Thirteen Colonies, then later transported to either Britain or France.\n  * Their land was given to settlers loyal to Britain, mostly immigrants from New England and Scotland. The event is largely regarded as a crime against humanity, though the modern-day use of the term \u201cgenocide\u201d is debated by scholars.\n\nWinter \u2022 April 29, 2024 4:53 AM\n\n@JonKnowsNothing\n\n> The USA has had cordial relationship with France over the long term.\n\nIndeed, but by 1776, Canada (Quebec) had been British for 17 years. France\nitself had no power in Canada anymore. It did not help that the 1775-1776\ninvasion and siege of Quebec by American troops were not exactly a boon for\nthe people living there.\n\nIt might have ended differently if the American invasion had succeeded in\ncapturing Quebec immediately. But it seems the Canadians were not very fanatic\nanti-British revolutionaries to begin with (or they were outnumbered and\noutgunned by the English troops?).\n\nSubscribe to comments on this entry\n\n## Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n\u2190 Microsoft and Security Incentives The Rise of Large-Language-Model\nOptimization \u2192\n\nSidebar photo of Bruce Schneier by Joe MacInnis.\n\nPowered by WordPress Hosted by Pressable\n\n### About Bruce Schneier\n\nI am a public-interest technologist, working at the intersection of security,\ntechnology, and people.
