Sharks leaping out of a muddy sea. Shrimp Jesus:\nOutlandish images that appear to be generated by artificial intelligence are\nracking up reactions on Facebook, leaving users amused, befuddled and on guard\nfor scams.\n\nMost of the images come from dozens of Facebook pages that post nearly every\nhour of the day, many of them inexplicably centered on themes involving Jesus\nand flight attendants. Some of those pages have built sizable followings in\nrecent months, with the posts often garnering comments ranging from bot-like\npraise to snarky remarks aimed at users who seem to believe the images are\nreal.\n\nThe images have received hundreds of millions of engagements on the platform,\naccording to a new Stanford Internet Observatory analysis that studied 120\nsuch pages, some of which are apparently run by the same administrators.\n\nIntricate artistic renditions of Jesus, whether built with plastic bottles or\ncarved out of sand, are among the most common images. More recently, Jesus has\ntaken on sea creature forms, mainly shrimp, crabs and sea horses. \u201cMade it\nwith my own hands! \ud83d\ude0a,\u201d these posts claim, often lamenting, \u201cNo one like my\nartwork \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\u201d\n\nFacebook\n\nAnd female flight attendants, most of whom appear to be East Asian, are\nfrequently depicted praying with Jesus, holding crosses and slathered in mud.\nIn what seems like a crossover event, some images even show flight attendants\nposing with shrimp Jesus.\n\nAlso particularly popular are images of young Black children showing off\nmasterly pieces of artwork they supposedly built, such as Jesus made of fruit,\ncars made of plastic bottles and tigers made of tire treads. These \u201cAfrica\nboys\u201d are \u201c\ud83d\udcaa Of The Best Designer in Village\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude4f,\u201d according to the captions\non some of the posts, which continue to declare, \u201cMade it with my own hands!\u201d\n\nMany of the AI photos draw in streams of users commenting \u201cAmen\u201d on bizarre\nJesus images, praising the impressive work of nonexistent artists or wishing\nhappy birthday to fake children sitting pitifully in mud. 404 Media, a\ntechnology-focused news startup, first reported on AI images flooding\nFacebook.\n\nFacebook\n\nThe vast majority of the synthetic images do not indicate in the posts or on\nthe pages that they are AI-generated, even though Meta requires users to label\nAI-generated content on its platforms while it is working toward methods to\nautomatically detect such content.\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs generative AI technology makes it easier to propagate misleading content\nand outright disinformation, information researchers have grown increasingly\nconcerned about the implications of unchecked AI images\u2019 flooding social\nplatforms.\n\nThough certain hallmarks of AI-generated art can make it easier to tell real\nimages from synthetic ones, the lack of systematic labeling has some users \u2014\nespecially older ones \u2014 falling for falsified content, according to comments\non many of the posts. Those Facebook pages have not exhibited clear motives\nfor their AI spam, but users are already pointing out the potential of a scam\noperation.\n\nThe Stanford study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, also found that some\nof the images have been posted from Facebook pages that were stolen from other\npeople or organizations, including a church in Georgia and a windmill seller,\nand then repurposed into AI spam pages.\n\nOne such page, now filled with AI images of Jesus and flight attendants, has\nkept the name of a high school band from North Carolina. Karen Jarvis, a\nspokesperson for Davie County Schools, confirmed in an email that the page\nDavie High School War Eagle Bands is now unaffiliated with the school, which\nwas forced to create a new page.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it was the original DCHS Band\u2019s Facebook page, but was hijacked from\nour high school band, and has since become what you see today,\u201d Jarvis wrote.\n\u201cThere have been countless attempts (from the band director, school officials,\ncurrent band members, and alumni) to regain control, report the page/images,\netc., but Facebook has been non-responsive.\u201d\n\nThe phenomenon has also caused some observers to speculate that the pages are\nbaiting gullible users to identify potential scam targets.\n\n\u201cAI-generated content appears to be a boon for spam and scam actors because\nthe images are easy to generate, often visually sensational, and attract\nengagement,\u201d the Stanford researchers wrote in their preprint paper.\n\nThey wrote that the pages use \u201cbatches of inauthentic followers\u201d to give\nthemselves a more legitimate appearance, as well as to engage with real\ncommenters, and that the scam accounts would sometimes seek personal\ninformation from commenters or try to sell them fake products.\n\nA search by NBC News found multiple replies from accounts asking to befriend\ncommenters, each one using a similar script. One commenter who wrote, \u201cLove\nit!! So cute!!\u201d on an AI-generated image of a toddler snuggled up in a basket\nof kittens, received a reply within hours from a recently created account\nunder the name Stephen Townsend. The account, which did not respond to a\nrequest for comment, displayed no personal information or posts aside from a\nprofile and a cover photo, both of which were uploaded on the same day.\n\n\u201cHello, Honestly I\u2019m really impressed with your profile and personality. I\nalso admire your good sense of humor here. I don\u2019t normally write in the\ncomment section, but I think you deserve this compliment,\u201d the profile\nreplied. \u201cI would like to be your friend. Kindly send me a friend request\nplease. If you don\u2019t mind. Thank you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the same style of comment found across Facebook, usually left as replies\nto comments on popular AI posts, as well as directly on users\u2019 profile pages.\nSome users suspicious that the pages are driving potential scam campaigns are\nalso leaving their own comments to warn those who may fail to distinguish\ncertain images as AI-generated.\n\nHazel Thayer, a Facebook user who shared several of the bizarre images on\nTikTok after she noticed them in her feed a few weeks ago, said she now gets\nAI images like those maybe every 10 posts: \u201cI\u2019m scrolling right now. I just\ngot one \u2014 that was four posts in.\u201d\n\nAnd from her perspective, it certainly looks like some fake activity.\n\n\u201cBecause if you see the comments of these friggin shrimp Jesuses, it\u2019s all\npeople going \u2018Amen,\u2019\u201d Thayer said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is going\n\u2018Hallelujah\u2019 for our shrimp lord.\u201d\n\nAngela Yang\n\nAngela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
