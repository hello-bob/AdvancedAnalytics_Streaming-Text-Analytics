So I took them seriously.\u201d\n\nNash is hardly the only so-called mad genius in history. Suicide victims like\npainters Vincent Van Gogh and Mark Rothko, novelists Virginia Woolf and Ernest\nHemingway, and poets Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath all offer prime examples.\nEven ignoring those great creators who did not kill themselves in a fit of\ndeep depression, it remains easy to list persons who endured well-documented\npsychopathology, including the composer Robert Schumann, the poet Emily\nDickinson, and Nash. Creative geniuses who have succumbed to alcoholism or\nother addictions are also legion.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nInstances such as these have led many to suppose that creativity and\npsychopathology are intimately related. Indeed, the notion that creative\ngenius might have some touch of madness goes back to Plato and Aristotle. But\nsome recent psychologists argue that the whole idea is a pure hoax. After all,\nit is certainly no problem to come up with the names of creative geniuses who\nseem to have displayed no signs or symptoms of mental illness.\n\n> The most important process underlying strokes of creative genius is the\n> tendency to pay attention to things that normally should be ignored or\n> filtered out.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nOpponents of the mad genius idea can also point to two solid facts. First, the\nnumber of creative geniuses in the entire history of human civilization is\nvery large. Thus, even if these people were actually less prone to\npsychopathology than the average person, the number with mental illness could\nstill be extremely large. Second, the permanent inhabitants of mental asylums\ndo not usually produce creative masterworks. The closest exception that anyone\nmight imagine is the notorious Marquis de Sade. Even in his case, his greatest\n(or rather most sadistic) works were written while he was imprisoned as a\ncriminal rather than institutionalized as a lunatic.\n\nSo should we believe that creative genius is connected with madness or not?\nModern empirical research suggests that we should because it has pinpointed\nthe connection between madness and creativity clearly. The most important\nprocess underlying strokes of creative genius is cognitive disinhibition\u2014the\ntendency to pay attention to things that normally should be ignored or\nfiltered out by attention because they appear irrelevant.^1\n\nWhen Alexander Fleming noticed that a blue mold was killing off the bacteria\nculture in his petri dish, he could have just tossed the latter into the\nautoclave like any of his colleagues might have done. Instead, Fleming won the\nNobel Prize for his discovery of penicillin, the antibacterial agent derived\nfrom the mold Penicillium notatum. Many people have gone for a walk in the\nwoods and returned with annoying burrs attached to their clothing, but only\nGeorge de Mestral decided to investigate further with a microscope, and\nthereby discover the basis for Velcro.\n\nCognitive disinhibition proves no less beneficial in the arts than in the\nsciences. Artistic geniuses will often report how the germ for a major\ncreative project came from hearing a tiny piece of casual conversation or\nseeing a unique but otherwise trivial event during a daily walk. For example,\nHenry James reported in his preface to The Spoils of Poynton that the germ of\nthe story came from an allusion made by a woman sitting beside him at\nChristmas Eve dinner.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

For example, schizophrenics find themselves bombarded with\nhallucinations and delusions that they would be much better off filtering\nout.^2 So why don\u2019t the two groups become the same group? According to Harvard\nUniversity psychologist Shelly Carson, the creative geniuses enjoy the asset\nof superior general intelligence. This intelligence introduces the necessary\ncognitive control that enables the person to separate the wheat from the\nchaff. Bizarre fantasies are divorced from realistic possibilities.\n\nAccording to this conception, high intelligence is essential to creative\ngenius, but only insofar as it collaborates with cognitive disinhibition.\nExceptional intelligence alone yields useful but unoriginal and unsurprising\nideas. Marilyn vos Savant made it into the Guinness Book of Records for the\nworld\u2019s highest recorded IQ, and yet has not managed to find a cure for cancer\nor even build a better mousetrap.\n\nSome domains of creativity put far more emphasis on usefulness than on\noriginality and surprise. In such cases, the vulnerability shared between\ngenius and madness becomes much less critical. For example, psychopathology\ncan be negatively correlated with creative genius in the hard sciences.^3 The\ninteresting exception are the scientific revolutionaries who go against the\nprevailing paradigms.^4 For them, the relation is almost as positive as found\nfor artists and writers.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Creative geniuses who grew up in such\nenvironments will actually be less likely to display traits or symptoms of\npsychopathology!^6\n\nBut many geniuses do walk the line between the normal and the abnormal. For\nthem, the barrage of impulses and ideas they perceive is a fount of\ncreativity. As Nash said after an extended period of delusional thinking, his\nreturn to a more rational phase was \u201cnot entirely a matter of joy.\u201d To explain\nwhy, he gave another simple reply. \u201cRationality of thought imposes a limit on\na person\u2019s concept of his relation to the cosmos.\u201d\n\nDean Keith Simonton is a distinguished professor at the department of\npsychology at the University of California, Davis.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
