However, even if there was an\nample blood supply, it\u2019s not as simple as just giving blood when it\u2019s needed.\n\nEach blood group (A, B, or AB) or type is identified by the presence of A and\nB antigens attached to sugar (oligosaccharide) chains on the surface of red\nblood cells. Blood cells in group O carry no antigens. When a blood\ntransfusion is given, the donor and recipient's blood groups need to match.\nOtherwise, the immune system will attack and destroy the donated blood cells,\ncausing a potentially fatal reaction.\n\nMore Stories\n\nBiology\n\nT. Rex was not as smart as we were made to believe\n\nMedical\n\nOnly half of atrial fibrillation patients survive another 10 years\n\nResearchers at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and Lund University,\nSweden, have used enzymes produced by a common gut bacteria to remove the A\nand B antigens from red blood cells, bringing them one step closer to creating\nuniversal donor blood.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the new enzyme cocktails not only remove the well-\ndescribed A and B antigens, but also extended variants previously not\nrecognized as problematic for transfusion safety,\u201d said Maher Abou Hachem, co-\ncorresponding author of the study and scientist at DTU\u2019s Department of\nBiotechnology and Biomedicine.\n\nAs mentioned, the term \u2018blood group\u2019 denotes the combination of antigens\npresent on the surface of a person\u2019s red blood cells. By \u2018extended variants,\u2019\nAbou Hachem is referring to blood group antigens discovered since the\ncanonical four were more than 120 years ago. The International Society of\nBlood Transfusion (ISBT), defines a blood group system as a genetically\ndiscrete system of one or more antigens. As of November 2023, there were 45\nrecognized blood group systems containing 362 red blood cell antigens that are\ngenetically determined by 50 genes.\n\nThe bacterium the researchers studied was Akkermansia muciniphila, a common\nresident of the healthy human gut lining. As its name, muciniphila, suggests,\nthe bug loves mucins, the major component of the mucus that the lining\nproduces. It uses enzymes to break down the mucins to create a source of\ncarbon, nitrogen, and energy. Coincidentally, in addition to appearing on red\nblood cells, blood group or ABO antigens are also present in this mucosal\nlining.\n\nSchematic of how bacterial enzymes converted A and B group red blood cells to\nuniversal donor blood\n\nMathias Jensen\n\n\u201cWhat is special about the [intestinal] mucosa is that bacteria, which are\nable to live on this material, often have tailor-made enzymes to break down\nmucosal sugar structures, which include blood group ABO antigens,\u201d Abou Hachem\nsaid.\n\nThe researchers tested 24 bacterial enzymes on hundreds of blood samples and\nfound that they were highly efficient at converting A and B group blood into\nuniversal donor blood. Their action was more effective against B antigens than\nA antigens, with one candidate depleting B antigens to negative control\nlevels.\n\n\u201cWe are close to being able to produce universal blood from group B donors,\nwhile there is still work to be done to convert the more complex group A\nblood,\u201d said Abou Hachem. \u201cOur focus is now to investigate in detail if there\nare additional obstacles and how we can improve our enzymes to reach the\nultimate goal of universal blood production.\u201d\n\nThe researchers say that their findings have important implications for the\nfuture of blood transfusions.\n\n\u201cUniversal blood will create a more efficient utilization of donor blood, and\nalso avoid giving ABO-mismatched transfusions by mistake, which can otherwise\nlead to potentially fatal consequences in the recipient,\u201d said Martin Olsson,\nthe study\u2019s other corresponding author. \u201cWhen we can create ABO-universal\ndonor blood, we will simplify the logistics of transporting and administering\nsafe blood products, while at the same time minimizing blood waste.\u201d\n\nIt's noted that the researchers do not mention the Rh factor in their study.\nIn addition to the blood group, blood is further categorized as either Rh-\npositive (red blood cells carry the Rh antigen) or Rh-negative (they don\u2019t).\nFor example, someone might say they are 'AB negative'. The first transfusion\nof Rh-positive blood to a Rh-negative donor causes them to develop anti-Rh\nantibodies so that a subsequent transfusion may produce a reaction like that\nproduced by giving group A blood to a group B person. Namely, the destruction\nof donor blood cells.\n\nThe researchers have applied for a patent on the new enzymes and their method\nof treatment. They expect to further their studies over the next three-and-a-\nhalf years before moving on to controlled patient trials.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Nature Microbiology.\n\nSource: DTU\n\n## Tags\n\nMedicalBloodEnzymeGut BacteriaMicrobiomeTechnical University of Denmark\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\nNo comments\n\nPaul McClure\n\nBefore realizing his writing passion, Paul worked as an intensive care nurse\nand a criminal defense lawyer for many years.
