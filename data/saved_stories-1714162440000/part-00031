I've been thinking about advice\non how to write well. I've argued before that a large proportion of such\nadvice is useless, or self-contradictory, or regularly ignored by the person\ndispensing it. (\"Omit needless words,\" declares William Strunk, in The\nElements of Style. Well, yes, but if you already know a word is needless, you\nshouldn't need to be told to omit it, and if you don't know it's needless, how\nis Strunk's advice going to help?)\n\nStill, three pieces of advice have made a concrete difference to my own\nproductivity as a writer \u2013 and I think also to the quality of my writing,\nthough that's not for me to say. Here they are, in case they might help you\ntoo:\n\nGood writing is pointing out.\n\nAs Steven Pinker notes in his book The Sense of Style, writing is cognitively\nunnatural: it's such a new way of communicating, on the timescale of human\nevolution, that it's little wonder we struggle. So it helps to approach it by\nmeans of an analogy with something we did evolve to do. Quoting the academics\nFrancis-No\u00ebl Thomas and Mark Turner, Pinker suggests approaching writing as if\nyou were pointing something in the environment out to another person \u2013\nsomething that she would notice for herself, if only she knew where to look.\nImagine directing someone's gaze across a valley, to a specific house on the\nother side. \"You should pretend,\" writes Pinker, \"that you, the writer, see\nsomething in the world that's interesting, and that you're directing the\nattention of your reader to that thing.\" He calls this the \"joint attention\"\nstrategy.\n\nWhich sounds obvious, except that it makes immediately clear how many writers\nare doing something else. Academics are often more focused on showing off\ntheir knowledge, or their membership in an exclusive circle (or in Butler's\ncase, trying to create an \"aura of importance\", in Martha Nussbaum's view.)\nJournalists are often trying to inflame your anger, or rally support for some\ncause.\n\nUsing the \"joint attention\" strategy makes it easier to see which details are\nessential and which aren't \u2013 and it helps you tread the narrow path between\npatronizing your reader and providing them with insufficient information. It's\nnot that they're stupid and you're enlightening them, but nor are they already\ninside your head. So you have to show them what you've noticed. Look, over\nthere: can you see?\n\nStopping is as crucial as starting.\n\nYou've presumably read a hundred pieces on the importance of a writing\nschedule, or aiming for a minimum number of words per day. But the big lesson\nI took from Robert Boice's psychology study How Writers Journey to Comfort and\nFluency is that what really matters is stopping once you've met your word goal\nor completed your scheduled writing session. (And Boice suggests these should\nstart very short indeed, like 10 or 15 minutes.) Don't keep going, even if\nyou're on a roll. Make yourself get up, walk away, and do something else.\n\nThis will feel all wrong: shouldn't you seize the momentum and get more done?\nNo, Boice insists. The urge to push onwards \"includes a big component of\nimpatience about not being finished, about not being productive enough, about\nnever again finding such an ideal time\" for work. If you keep going, you'll\nreinforce your worst impulses, whereas walking away helps strengthen the\nmuscle of patience that will permit you to return to your writing project, day\nafter day. And short work periods will ensure that writing remains something\nonly modestly central to your life, which will prevent it becoming too\nintimidatingly scary to confront.\n\nIf you're staring at a blank page, you're doing it wrong.\n\nThis deserves a longer treatment, but here's the short version: consider\nshifting some of the energy you spend on writing away from the creation of\nfinished products (articles, short stories, whatever) and onto the ongoing\nmaintenance of some kind of system for storing and fleshing out your ideas.\nSitting down to write an article or story shouldn't be the beginning of a\nprocess, in which you have to decide what to write about, then go do research,\nthink of things to say, etcetera. That's the arduous path. The easier one is\nto keep a constantly expanding storehouse of notes on what you're reading and\nconversations you're having, observations on life, shower thoughts, and so on.\nThat way, sitting down to write an article is just the end stage of the\nprocess, a matter of bringing together various insights, facts and quotes\nyou've been collecting and cross-fertilizing for months.\n\nThe hardcore way to do this is to create a \"Zettelkasten\" system, as outlined\nby S\u00f6nke Ahrens in his book How to Take Smart Notes (which is worth reading\neven if you don't decide to implement the whole thing). My version of this\napproach is still embryonic. But already it's clear that as it reaches a\ncritical mass, it begins, in an almost magical fashion, to generate its \"own\"\nideas, almost as if it were a human collaborator. At the very least, start\nkeeping an ideas file, and carry a notebook wherever you go. Writing can be\nhard, but there's no need to make matters worse by starting each project from\nscratch.\n\nTo receive posts as soon as they're available, subscribe to my email The\nImperfectionist.\n\n### A book about embracing your limitations, and finally getting round to what\ncounts\n\n###\n\nAvailable now Learn more\n\nHome\n\nBooks\n\nPosts\n\nThe Imperfectionist\n\nAbout\n\nEmail me at oliver@oliverburkeman.com\n\nFollow me on Twitter @oliverburkeman\n\n(c) Oliver Burkeman 2022\n\nbottom of page\n\n", "frontpage": false}
