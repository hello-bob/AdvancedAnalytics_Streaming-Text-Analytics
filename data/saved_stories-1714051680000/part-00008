He is Jewish, and has been made hard\nand cruel by his experiences in the Nazi death camps. He's also a mutant,\ngifted with the power to manipulate metal and the electromagnetic spectrum.\nSince his first appearance in the inaugural X-Men comic, he spent six decades\nof Marvel publication history oscillating between supervillainous heel,\nmessianic terrorist, swaggering nationalist, and increasingly heroic anti-\nfascist. He stood trial for crimes against humanity and tried his hand at\nstate building; he\u2019s variously fought against, allied with, and led the X-Men.\nHe\u2019s taken and abandoned many names: Max, Erik, Magnus. Only one ever stuck:\nMagneto.\n\nThis is the setup for Resurrection of Magneto, an ongoing miniseries by Al\nEwing and Luciano Vecchio. In it, Marvel\u2019s master of magnetism, who is also\nthe company\u2019s most famous Jewish character, counts his many sins, tortured by\nthe fear that he\u2019s wasted his life on a poisoned dream. The comic arrives at a\nfraught time. When it debuted earlier this year, Israeli bombs had been\nfalling on Gaza for three months; 25,000 people were dead. That number has now\ntopped 34,000, and the bombs are still falling.\n\nIt is a low and shameful moment. It is also one that suits Magneto entirely\ntoo well\u2014a distillation of all the ambiguities and anxieties of American\nJudaism as it reckons with the sacrifices made to the promise of \u201cnever\nagain,\u201d and the increasingly fraught question of what that actually means.\n\nMagneto debuted in 1963, as the lead villain of the first issue of Uncanny\nX-Men #1. The comic was a late, weak product of the long-running partnership\nbetween artist Jack Kirby (who did most of the work) and Stan Lee (who claimed\nmost of the credit). The narrative engine was simple: A team of teenage mutant\nsuperheroes, led by kindly mentor Charles Xavier, seek to protect a suspicious\npopulace from the depredations of evil mutants. \u201cThe human race no longer\ndeserves dominion over planet Earth!\u201d Magneto snarls as he slinks through\nKirby\u2019s rushed layouts, swearing to \u201cmake homo sapiens bow to homo superior!\u201d\n\nKirby (n\u00e9e Kurtzberg) and Lee (n\u00e9e Lieber) were both American Jews, and the\nproduct of one of the great Jewish cities: New York. Their relationships with\nthat community varied; Kirby maintained a muscular ethnic and cultural pride\nin his Judaism, while Lee tended to avoid associating with it. The X-Men\u2019s\noriginal creators wrote about people who, though sometimes able to pass as\nWASPs, were inescapably and essentially different, and the subject of both\nelaborate conspiracy and unthinking prejudice. They were human and not;\neternal Others hiding in the upstate suburbs, longing for acceptance from a\nworld that hated and feared them. That otherness would be interpreted in many\nways over the coming decades, as imperfect stand-ins for various identities\nand populations. But the American Jewish anxieties of the midcentury were\nthere first, and undergirded much of what came after.\n\nIf the X-Men can be read as crypto-Jews, what was Magneto? Kirby had fought in\nWorld War II, and Magneto fit alongside his other supervillains\u2014if not\nexplicit Nazis, then fascists and bullyboys and tinpot dictators. Magneto\nhimself is a supremacist lunatic, barely cloaking his conquering urges in\nself-justification. \u201cThey would kill us all if they could!\u201d he says in an\nearly issue, fleeing a nuke that he\u2019s primed to destroy a small country he\u2019s\njust tried to conquer. \u201cWe fight only in self defense!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a revealing line, but only in retrospect. The original incarnation of\nX-Men, canceled due to low sales in 1970, was essentially a rough draft; so\nwas its lead villain. In 1975, Chris Claremont, a young Anglo-American Jewish\nwriter, inherited a freshly reinvented X-Men comic and set about turning the\nbook into a much more explicit metaphor about persecution.\n\nMagneto, he realized, needed an overhaul. Trying to work out where the\ncharacter\u2019s ranting antipathy toward humanity might have come from,\nClaremont\u2014who\u2019d kicked around on a socialist kibbutz in Israel among Holocaust\nsurvivors four years before he got the job\u2014made a change that utterly\nredefined the character: He tied Magneto\u2019s origins and explosive rage to the\nGerman death camps. \u201cI remember my own childhood\u2014the gas chambers at\nAuschwitz, the guards joking as they herded my family to their death,\u201d the\nvillain recalls during his big return in 1981\u2019s X-Men #150. \u201cAs our lives were\nnothing to them, so human lives became nothing to me.\u201d\n\nWhile initially playing coy about whether Magneto was explicitly Jewish,\nClaremont wasn\u2019t quite able to stop himself from implying it, either. From the\nbeginning, Israel and Israeli politics are woven through Claremont\u2019s\nconception of the character. Menachem Begin, founder of Israel\u2019s right-wing\nLikud party and a former terrorist who masterminded the lethal 1946 bombing of\nthe King David Hotel in Jerusalem, was an explicit inspiration. In a later\nissue, Claremont establishes that Magneto and Professor X are old friends who\nhad first met in Haifa after World War II. There, as Jewish militants were\nwaging open war against both the British Mandate and their Palestinian\nneighbors, the two sparred genially over whether oppressed mutants should\npursue Xavier\u2019s liberal integrationism or something more violent. \u201cMutants\nwill not go meekly into the gas chambers,\u201d Magneto tells Xavier. \u201cWe will\nfight, and we will win.\u201d\n\nThe narrative substitution here is deft but familiar\u2014tie the cartoonish\nsupremacist to monumental tragedy, and render him more human. But there were\nother undercurrents here. Throughout the midcentury, the Holocaust went\nlargely unspoken of in America and Europe, and was a source of pity and\nembarrassment in Israel. Even as Claremont took over X-Men, however, a new\nHolocaust memory culture took shape at home and abroad, fueled by a powerful\nsurge of expansionist Israeli nationalism. The spectacle of Israel\u2019s rendition\nand trial of (arguable) Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann in 1961 resurfaced\nthe issue. Wars in 1967 and 1973 against coalitions of Arab nations led by\nEgypt, which effectively destroyed the Labor party\u2019s long dominance in Israeli\npolitics, left the state awash both in the heady rush of military conquest and\na siege mentality. In America, Jewish organizations\u2014rattled by the Arab wars\nand perhaps not immune to the \u201cwhite ethnic revival\u201d that emerged in reaction\nto the civil rights movement\u2014began tying themselves ever more closely to\npolitical Zionism.\n\nIn this context, the slogan \u201cNever Again,\u201d popularized in English by the\nAmerican-born Jewish supremacist and terrorist Meir Kahane in 1971, became a\ncommon rallying cry among American Jews and Israelis alike. Many understood it\nto have a specific meaning: Never again for Jews. Such circumstances favored\nthe rise of men like Begin, who took over as Israeli Prime Minister in 1977\nand invaded Lebanon to attack the PLO in 1982; the war left Beirut a smoking\nruin and tens of thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese dead. Begin was among\nthe first Israeli leaders to seek justification in the Holocaust, both for the\ninvasion of Lebanon\u2014\u201cBelieve me, the alternative to this is Treblinka, and we\nhave decided that there will not be another Treblinka,\u201d he said before the\nwar\u2014and his vision of Israel\u2019s identity. To him, Palestinians and other Arabs\nwere the new Nazis, Palestinian political leader Yasser Arafat the new Hitler,\nand the next genocide forestalled only by Israeli walls and guns.\n\nYet Begin appealed to Claremont as a model not simply for his terrorist past,\nbut also for his participation in the 1978 Camp David Accords that brought\npeace with Egypt, which won him a statesman\u2019s reputation. Over the course of\nthe writer\u2019s run, the regretful Magneto increasingly sought to distance\nhimself from his 1960s behavior, first\u2014in Uncanny X-Men #200\u2014by agreeing to\nstand trial for his crimes, and then by taking over Xavier\u2019s school in the\nprofessor's absence, teaching his students, and furthering his integrationist\ngoals. Whatever his reservations, the old supremacist terrorist would try to\npursue liberalism and coexistence.\n\nUnfortunately, Begin proved a more apt model than Claremont had intended. By\nthe end of the 1980s, Marvel editorial mandated that Magneto turn heel again,\na decision that played a large part in driving Claremont off the book. In the\nabsence of the writer that redefined him, Magneto became an increasingly\nunstable antagonist, spending a good chunk of \u201890s X-Men comics manipulated,\ninsane, or in a coma\u2014but always at war against the non-mutant world. In one\n1999-2000 arc, the supervillain bullied the UN into granting him a mutant\nnation on the fictional island of Genosha, the refugee population of which he\nsoon sought to turn into a conquering army. If the root of Claremont\u2019s\nreinvention could not be wholly ignored, it bubbled out in Magneto\u2019s bristling\nparanoia and monomaniacal focus on mutant power and safety, with ugly hints of\neliminationism underneath. Here was \u201cNever Again\u201d framed as the blind pursuit\nof power and the false safety of the preemptive strike.\n\nIn 2001\u2019s New X-Men, Scottish writer Grant Morrison mined that queasy space\nfor maximum discomfort. That run, a barn-burning 2001 attempt to reinvigorate\nthe series in the wake of the blockbuster 2000 X-Men film, begins by re-\nstaging the Holocaust in grand sci-fi scale, with mutant-killing robots wiping\nout the 16 million mutants of the mutant nation of Genosha, Magneto seemingly\namong them. The terrorist became a martyr, and the island\u2019s ruins a monument\nto his memory. Disaffected students at Xavier\u2019s school don Che-like T-shirts\nemblazoned with his face and the slogan \u201cMagneto Was Right.\u201d\n\nAnd then, in \u201cPlanet X,\u201d the penultimate arc of the comic, Magneto returns and\nwrecks it all. Having infiltrated the Xavier school under a false identity, he\nsubverts students into terrorists, badly thrashes many of the X-Men, and turns\nManhattan into a death camp for humans before the team finally kills him.\n\n\u201cWhat people often forget, of course, is that Magneto, unlike the lovely Sir\nIan McKellen [who played him in the blockbuster], is a mad old terrorist\ntwat,\u201d Morrison once said. \u201cNo matter how he justifies his stupid, brutal\nbehavior, or how anyone else tries to justify it, in the end he's just an old\nbastard.\u201d It\u2019s as thorough a rejection of the Claremont model as could be\nimagined. Morrison\u2019s Magneto is a frightening but strangely feeble presence.\nHis own propaganda of power and grievance\u2014it\u2019s literalized as a sentient\npower-boosting drug because, hey, it\u2019s comics\u2014leaves him utterly unconnected\nfrom reality. He\u2019s reduced to ranting on a rooftop to a crowd that can\u2019t hear\nhim, while marching the humans of New York into abattoirs. \u201cThis all started\nas politics and freedom,\u201d one of his students says in dawning horror. \u201cWhen\ndid we all turn into such total Nazis?\u201d\n\nWhen indeed? Magneto\u2019s broader heel turn coincided with a shift among some\nJews, who began to regard the trajectory of the Jewish state\u2014by then\nexpansionist, swaggering, increasingly adept at leveraging the sympathies and\nshames of Europe and America\u2014with a troubled eye. Survivors of Auschwitz with\ndeep emotional ties to Israel, like Jean Am\u00e9ry and Primo Levi, nonetheless\ncondemned the torture of Arabs in Israeli prisons and the Jewish supremacism\nbehind Begin\u2019s rise. In a clear-eyed 1980 column, the Israeli writer Boaz\nEvron dissected the ways that Israeli politicians increasingly bent the\nHolocaust to their own purposes, as a means of policing diaspora politics and\nexcusing their own nationalist policies. That management created in the\nIsraeli consciousness \u201ca peculiar moral blindness,\u201d Evron observed: an\nideological framework that set Jews as a whole (embodied, in their view, by\nIsrael) outside of humanity\u2014eternally hated, eternally feared, permitted\neverything and forbidden nothing. Orthodox polymath and theologian Yeshayahu\nLeibowitz was more strident still, warning throughout the 1990s that adherence\nto Israeli nationalism was corrupting global Judaism as a whole, a position\nthat led him to eventually decry the \u201cNazification of Israeli society.\u201d\n\nClaremont had drawn a similar connection back in 1981, in his big reinvention\nof Magneto in Uncanny X-Men #150. After almost killing X-Men team member Kitty\nPryde, a 13-year-old Jewish girl, the shocked supervillain collapses to his\nknees. \u201cI believed so much in my destiny, in my personal vision, that I was\nprepared to pay any price, make any sacrifice to achieve it,\u201d he wails in a\nmoment of operatic clarity. \u201cCan you not appreciate the irony? In my zeal to\nremake the world, I have become much like those I have always hated and\ndespised.\u201d Claremont, reflecting on the issue years later, went right at it:\n\u201cHis shattering realization is: 'What kind of monster have I become? Has what\nthe Nazis did to me in the Shoah made me a Nazi?'\u201d\n\nThis kind of comparison quite understandably tends to get people screamed at.\nEquating a Jewish government to the Nazi regime has long been a red line in\nthe discourse, cast as an inherent and particularly vicious antisemitism. Yet\nthe unspeakability of the comparison marks a vulnerable spot. Under Morrison,\nMagneto\u2019s ugliness feels deliberate and pointed, a finger pressing against a\nbruise. Too hard for Marvel, as it turned out: In an impressive feat of\nbackpedaling, the company hastily overturned the entire storyline after\nMorrison left, revealing that the maddened genocidaire had actually been an\nimposter. The real Magneto, revealed by a returning Claremont to be secretly\nalive on Genosha, would never do such a thing. The villainous path was closed;\nhe could get his face-turn after all.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic, considering Morrison\u2019s critique of Magneto, that the lasting\ninfluence of their time writing the character was something they\u2019d intended as\nsatire\u2014the slogan \u201cMagneto Was Right.\u201d It was a fair conclusion for characters\nand fans alike to draw. After a 2005 editorial edict depowered the vast\nmajority of characters in the X-line (though, notably, not the marketable\nones) a succession of writers spent 15 years piling on stories of hate crimes.\nThe battered X-Men and redeemed Magneto thus drifted increasingly into each\nother\u2019s ideological orbits.\n\nAnd why not? Read enough X-Men comics, and you\u2019ll notice that the fundamental\nfeature of the franchise\u2014the idea of mutants as eternal stand-ins for Jews, or\nblack people, or queer people\u2014is its essential pessimism. In X-Men, minority\nlife is wholly defined by oppression. No improvement can last; progress is\nalways an illusion; as figures in an ongoing, eternal piece of intellectual\nproperty, mutants must always be hated and feared. This enforced, recursive\nMarvel-Time unwittingly echoes what we might call Jewish-Time: the idea that\nJewish people were, are, and always will be oppressed by antisemitism, cast as\nthe same villain in different costumes. Persia is Rome, Russia is Germany.\nRather than discrete historical occurrences\u2014contingent, contested,\ncomplex\u2014they are foreordained, essential, and inescapable. There is only the\npogrom, forever.\n\nActual Jewish history isn\u2019t so clear-cut. Most of our communities have\nlived\u2014indeed, still live\u2014under the rule of multiethnic nations, and those\nexperiences have profoundly shaped our culture and religion. In Babylon and\nPersia, Imperial Rome and Charlemagne\u2019s France, in Al Andalus and the vast\nlands of the Ottomans and as far as western China, Jewish communities spread\nand prospered under the disinterested gaze of non-Jewish governments. Such\nminority communities\u2014and in this, Jews are in no way unique\u2014sometimes endured\nspasms of brutal violence. We remember the victims of those horrors, and are\nright to do so. But that is not the only story of Jewish life; it seems\nprofoundly disrespectful to our history to forget the rest, or to subordinate\nit so profoundly to Jewish suffering.\n\nThis Judeopessimism, which centers Jewish identity around past and potential\nfuture trauma, grants a strange kind of privilege even as it elevates danger\ninto the ubiquitous and decisive aspect of Jewish life. That danger can be\nreal\u2014antisemitism is real\u2014but centering it like this also extends the\nentitlement of myth, of living in the four-color world of propaganda, of being\nat once eternally strong and desperately weak. Conceptualize history in this\natavistic way, as many diaspora and Israeli Jews do, and you might see\nnationalistic power as a necessity. If Professor Xavier\u2019s integration can\nnever come, then the hour of Magneto must always be around the corner.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that in 2008, amidst this slow transition, Magneto finally became\ncanonically Jewish, officially and incontestably, in the pages of Greg Pak and\nCarmine Di Giandomenico\u2019s Magneto: Testament. The book, an extensively\nresearched and often brutal retelling of his origin amid the Holocaust death\ncamps, reveals his original name of Max Eisenhardt and follows him from the\npassage of anti-Jewish laws to his time as an Auschwitz Sonderkommando,\ndisposing of the camp dead. By stripping away the heightened sci-fi logic of\nother X-Men comics, Testament forces readers to consider Max not as a\nmetaphorical mutant minority, but a recognizably human one.\n\nMostly, though, this dark past serves as textual justification for an era in\nwhich Magneto is rendered, in effect, as power fantasy. In his 1980 essay,\nEvron dryly observed that American and Israeli Jews both clung tightly to \u201ca\ndouble, contradictory image\u2014the virile [Israeli] superman, and the potential\nHolocaust victim.\u201d The former construction, he argued, offered American Jews a\nchance to indulge their fantasies of toughness and manliness. By 2014, for\nexample, a 21-issue series written by Cullen Bunn had positioned Magneto as a\nmodern Nazi-hunting vigilante, operating out of hotel rooms and killing anti-\nmutant bigots. The series mined a pulp thrill from Magneto\u2019s moral\nambiguities, but ultimately justified them. \u201cPeople say he\u2019s some sort of\nmonster,\u201d a young mutant says. \u201cBut I\u2019m just glad that mutants have someone\nlike him. Someone who can be angry, who can do the bad things, so that we\nmight survive.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the fantasy. Here is a man against whom every bigot, every neo-Nazi,\nevery gay-basher will find that they have bitten off far more than they can\nchew. Isn\u2019t this the way it should have happened? No weapon formed against him\ncan prosper: The mechanical, mechanized means of death that killed so many of\nour ancestors can be set back on their perpetrators with a contemptuous flick\nof the hand. And despite his demonstrated ability to level a city, Magneto\nwill always hit the correct targets, the ones that have it coming. He will be\na superhero, and always Right. He will not have to reckon with himself. He\nwill not have to change.\n\nAnd yet, miraculously, Magneto has. In 2019, after years of languishing in a\nnarrative holding pattern, the X-Men franchise relaunched with a wildly\nambitious five-year story, spearheaded by a group of writers initially led by\nJonathan Hickman. Formed from multiple interweaving series, it is rooted in a\nsimple premise: Mutants have again established their own sovereign nation on\nthe living island of Krakoa. This time, however, Xavier and Magneto are\nworking together as leading partners, and mutants have worked out how to use\ntheir powers to resurrect the dead. The world may hate and fear them, but it\ncan no longer kill them.\n\nFor most of its existence, the Krakoa era has been an impressively precision-\nengineered setup, something that can be plausibly read in multiple ways. You\ncan, if you like, interpret it as a metaphor for the promises and failures of\nZionism, or ethnonationalism more generally. Here is a state formed out of,\nand justified by, the memory of atrocity. It is built on a dream of\nestablishing a new cultural identity (complete with a new language) and a\nquasi-socialist yet techno-capitalist setup.\n\nAnd yet its government never quite gets around to creating a real\nconstitution; its spy agency is too busy pursuing foreign policy debacles and\ninternal power politics to catch the threats rising around them. As time goes\non, the beautiful Krakoan dream is brutally undercut by the agendas of the\nmonsters they allow in\u2014people who see the nation as an avenue to their own\npower and want to twist it into something horrific, and who nearly get their\nwish. You can also read Krakoa just as easily as an invocation of the original\nZionist nightmare: a small nation surrounded on all sides by enemies bent on\nits elimination, who poison its reputation and are ultimately successful in\ndestroying it via brutal sneak attack. (The status quo, recall, can never be\ntranscended for long; Marvel-time is mythic Jewish-time; the next pogrom for\nthe X-Men is always coming.)\n\nOver the course of the narrative, Magneto\u2014subjected to a remarkably sustained\nbit of authorial examination\u2014finally begins to evolve. Under Hickman\u2019s pen, he\nopens the series in fine old form, as a swaggering nationalist atop the\nKrakoan embassy in Jerusalem, browbeating deceitful ambassadors, playing power\npolitics at Davos, indulging in feats of incredible strength. Yet as the story\nwinds on, Magneto finds that mutant nationalism, with all its attendant\ncompromises and failures, is not actually the balm he sought. In his growing\ndisillusionment, he abandons the project. \u201cI tried to build something,\u201d he\nmuses in the pages of 2022\u2019s X-Men: Red #1, written by British writer Al\nEwing. \u201cBut when I tried to wrestle my dream into the world\u2014to make it real\u2014it\nbroke apart. Shattered to pieces. And they cut me to the heart.\u201d\n\nThat disillusionment, too, might sound familiar. By the 2000s, an increasingly\nright-wing Jewish nationalism had both the American and Israeli mainstream in\na chokehold. The dream of peace had been replaced by a fantasy of a perpetual\nmanaged apartheid. Powerful and increasingly reactionary lobbies like AIPAC\ncame down harshly on insufficiently deferential politicians; institutional\nprograms like Birthright worked to funnel diaspora Jews through hasbarist\nfantasies. Over time, as previous Holocaust survivors and Israeli writers had\npredicted, the gravitational pull of the state increasingly twisted the more\nliberal elements of diaspora Judaism out of true. Transferred nationalism, as\nGeorge Orwell caustically observed in 1945, proved \u201ca way of attaining\nsalvation without altering one\u2019s conduct.\u201d Move over, Hashem; we have new gods\nnow.\n\nAmidst a perpetual occupation whose brutality was, in all senses, unspeakable,\nthe Holocaust memory culture that sustained the state took on an increasingly\nacid and farcical edge. Germans scolded refugees for daring to identify with\npersecuted Jews; the increasingly white-nationalist Elon Musk performed the\nstations of the cross at Auschwitz alongside Ben Shapiro, to show how much of\nan antisemite he wasn\u2019t. Even before the October 7 massacre, the Likud and its\npartners even further to the right in Israeli politics had grown fat on\nentitlement, unaware or disdainful of the fact that they were badly\noverspending their credit. A fault-line yawned open within the global Jewish\ncommunity, exposing the divide between those who had understood \u201cNever Again\u201d\nto be a humanistic warning, and those who saw it as permission in advance for\nwhatever they deemed necessary to ensure it. As a villain and antihero,\nMagneto easily stood in for the latter camp; those decades of endless,\nintermittently coherent historical rage, and the way in which it made every\nresponse allowable and indulged.\n\nAnd yet if superhero comics can be a site of bubbling anxiety and creaky\nmetaphor, they can also offer flashes of genuine grace. Let us return, then,\nto where we began: the realm of judgment. In 2022, amid the excellent\n\u201cJudgement Day\u201d crossover, Magneto died, falling in combat against a physical\nembodiment of genocide, in order to save the world. Ewing writes him a\ndeathbed epiphany: \u201cWe must fight together\u2014all of society's so-called\nundesirables,\u201d he whispers. \u201cOr our enemies will destroy us simply for daring\nto exist.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t going to last. Death in superhero comics is an illusion; the only\nquestion was what shape that return might take. In Ewing\u2019s Resurrection Of\nMagneto, it\u2019s a tour-de-force examination of the character, one that sifts and\ndissects and synthesizes his entire creative history, from Kirby/Lee to\nClaremont and Morrison, as the man himself wanders past walls of monumental\nconcrete and fire. There are names, too: the names of all who died by his hand\nor through his inaction, for the sake of his dream, and the too few that he\nhas saved.\n\nIn death, of course, he\u2019s still Magneto. He\u2019s still swift to anger and quick\nto lash out and prone to expediency; his suffering has not necessarily\nennobled him. He is as he\u2019s been written. But, Ewing gently suggests, he might\nalso be something else as well. Magneto can not just evolve, but repent. In\nthe Jewish tradition, repentance is a long and difficult road, and one that\noffers no guarantees\u2014not of comfort, and not of a return to a pleasant status\nquo with one\u2019s sins absolved. It asks us instead to give up our illusions, our\nresentments, our stiff-necked devotion to our own self-determination. It asks\nus to accept both the reality of our sins and our capacity for good. It\ndemands that we abandon our belief in easy miracles. There is only the walk;\nthere is only the work.\n\n\u201cThroughout my life, I have repressed the rage in me until it exploded, or I\nhave given it free reign over all decision,\u201d Magneto says, confronting his old\nKirby/Lee self on the road back to life. \u201cBut I cannot return to the world and\nreturn to the same path. I must change... So I acknowledge all that I have\ndone. I admit all that I am. I own the shadow that is in me. And if this is\nthe engine that drives me\u2014let it drive me to a better world. A world for all\nwho are hated and feared.\u201d\n\nFor all who are hated and feared. \u201cThe true guarantee against ideologically-\nbased extermination is not military power and sovereignty,\u201d Evron wrote in\n1980. That is, not in the building of more and higher walls, but in the\n\u201ceradication of ideologies which remove any human group from the family of\nhumanity.\u201d Such a pursuit offers fewer opportunities to swagger and punish,\nand tickles no atavistic fancies. Yet it is, in its way, a far more grand and\nradical desire.\n\nChange in corporate superhero comics is as much of an illusion as death, of\ncourse, and about as permanent. Any character development is subject to\nreversion, and rare indeed is the development that doesn\u2019t get walked back\nsomewhere down the line. But at this moment, this is what a reborn Magneto has\ncome to stand for\u2014not the wary and vengeful paranoia of \u201cNever Again,\u201d but the\ngreater aspiration of \u201cNever Again\u201d for anyone.\n\nIf to be a Jew of the diaspora is to be, in the Kirby/Lee/Claremont\nformulation, a mutant, then this is what we must remember. We are not immune\nto hatred and fear, and we are not the only ones subject to it. And we cannot\nbe safe until we create that better world for everyone, together.
