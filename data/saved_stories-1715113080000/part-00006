Efforts towards\n> automated ICD coding are dominated by supervised deep learning models.\n> However, difficulties in learning to predict the large number of rare codes\n> remain a barrier to adoption in clinical practice. In this work, we leverage\n> off-the-shelf pre-trained generative large language models (LLMs) to develop\n> a practical solution that is suitable for zero-shot and few-shot code\n> assignment, with no need for further task-specific training. Unsupervised\n> pre-training alone does not guarantee precise knowledge of the ICD ontology\n> and specialist clinical coding task, therefore we frame the task as\n> information extraction, providing a description of each coded concept and\n> asking the model to retrieve related mentions. For efficiency, rather than\n> iterating over all codes, we leverage the hierarchical nature of the ICD\n> ontology to sparsely search for relevant codes.\n\nComments:| Accepted to the NeurIPS 2023 workshop Deep Generative Models For\nHealth (DGM4H). 9 pages, 3 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \nACM classes:| I.2.7; I.2.8  \nCite as:| arXiv:2310.06552 [cs.AI]  \n(or arXiv:2310.06552v3 [cs.AI] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.06552arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Joseph Spartacus Boyle [view email] [v1] Tue, 10 Oct 2023 11:56:48 UTC\n(1,282 KB) [v2] Fri, 10 Nov 2023 14:39:53 UTC (5,248 KB) [v3] Mon, 13 Nov 2023\n12:38:00 UTC (5,248 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Automated clinical coding using off-the-shelf\nlarge language models, by Joseph S.
