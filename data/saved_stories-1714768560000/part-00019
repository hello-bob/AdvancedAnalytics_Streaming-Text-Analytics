When it was conducted, this exercise was the most\nambitious and costly military simulation in American history. It pitted the\nU.S. military (with capabilities projected five years into the future) against\na nameless potential adversary, with outcome intended to inform future\nstrategy and procurement decisions. Controversy immediately arose when the\nopposition force, or red team, learned that the results were scripted to\nassure that the U.S. forces would win. Writing in September 2002, New York\nTimes columnist Nicholas Kristof warned that it \u201cshould teach us one clear\nlesson relating to Iraq: Hubris kills.\u201d (In that same column, Kristof admitted\n\u201cI\u2019m a wimp on Iraq: I\u2019m in favor of invading, but only if we can win\neasily.\u201d) MC \u201902 was later popularized in Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s 2005 book, Blink:\nThe Power of Thinking Without Thinking, where the leader of the red team\nopposition force (OPFOR), retired Marine Corps three-star Paul Van Riper was\npraised for having \u201ccreated the conditions for successful spontaneity\u201d with a\ndecision-making style that \u201cenables rapid cognition.\u201d More recently, a Marine\nCorps Gazette essay proclaimed that \u201cJFCOM controllers changed the scenario\u201d\nof MC \u201902 and that the command \u201cfailed to understand the utility of the\nexercise and the feedback it provided.\u201d\n\nThese perspectives are misleading, and generally told from one person\u2019s view:\nVan Riper\u2019s. Moreover, they lack important historical context and alternative\nperspectives about why the shortcomings of MC \u201902 were inevitable, given\ncongressionally required demands, misunderstandings of objectives, and unclear\n(and shifting) lines of authority. Furthermore, a more comprehensive account\nprovides insights for how the military should think about, design, and conduct\nred team simulations. This article, adapted from my book, Red Team: How to\nSucceed by Thinking Like the Enemy, provides this more complete account as it\nis based upon interviews with most of the relevant senior officials, as well\nas the MC \u201902 after-action report, which was only made public in 2010.\n\nMC \u201902 was intended to be the largest, most expensive, and most elaborate\nconcept-development exercise in U.S. military history. The exercise was\nmandated by Congress to \u201cexplore critical war fighting challenges at the\noperational level of war that will confront United States joint military\nforces after 2010.\u201d Developed over two years at a cost of $250 million, it\nwould grow to include 13,500 service members participating from 17 simulation\nlocations and nine live-force training sites. It was promoted by Pentagon\nofficials as a demonstration of \u201cleap-ahead technologies,\u201d and was intended to\nprovide commanders with \u201cdominant battle space knowledge\u201d to conduct \u201crapid\ndecisive operations\u201d against future adversaries.\n\nThese untested war-fighting theories, however, including many aspects of the\n\u201crevolution in military affairs,\u201d existed only in the PowerPoint presentations\nand minds of defense intellectuals and senior Pentagon officials. MC \u201902 would\nput them to the test over the course of three weeks in the summer of 2002. It\nwas considered such an important event that then Secretary of Defense Donald\nRumsfeld himself visited JFCOM headquarters to endorse the exercise:\n\n> MC02, as I\u2019m told it\u2019s called \u2014 sounds like fizz water in the old days ...\n> will help us create a force that is not only interoperable, responsive,\n> agile and lethal, but one that is capable of capitalizing on the information\n> revolution and the advanced technologies that are available today.\n\nJFCOM Commander Gen. Buck Kernan summarized what was expected: \u201cMC \u201902 is the\nkey to military transformation.\u201d\n\nThe featured activity of MC \u201902 would be a red team war-game simulation. The\nhypothetical joint experiment would feature an anti-access, area-denial\nscenario that was situated in the world of 2007, pitting a U.S. blue team of\n350 personnel led by Army Lt. Gen. B. B. Bell against an OPFOR of 90 personnel\nmodeling an adversary, and initially led by Van Riper. Kernan personally\nselected Van Riper to lead the OPFOR, believing that, since he was a \u201cdevious\nsort of guy\u201d and \u201ca no-nonsense solid professional warfighter,\u201d he was the\nbest possible candidate. The OPFOR, widely understood to represent Iraq or\nIran\u2019s military, had a carefully prepared campaign plan, for which the\nultimate objective was to preserve the red team\u2019s ruling regime and reduce the\npresence of blue forces in the region. The blue team also had a campaign plan,\nwhich included securing shipping lanes, eliminating the OPFOR\u2019s weapons of\nmass destruction facilities, and compelling the red ruling regime to abandon\nits goal of regional hegemony. To most participants, MC \u201902 resembled much of\nthe \u201cRunning Start\u201d plan that U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) planners were\ndeveloping and refining in the summer of 2002 to disarm Saddam Hussein and\nremove him from power.\n\nVan Riper had participated in previous war games for JFCOM, including the\nprevious year\u2019s Unified Vision 2001 exercise in which he played the role of a\nlandlocked regional power. At one crucial engagement during Unified Vision\n2001, Van Riper was informed by the white cell, or \u201ccontrol,\u201d overseeing the\ngame that the United States had destroyed all 21 of the red team\u2019s deeply\nburied ballistic missiles, even though the blue team commander never actually\nknew where they were located. It was simply assumed that in the future the\nUnited States would have the real-time radar and sensor capabilities to\neliminate them. After the Unified Vision 2001 exercise, JFCOM provided a\nreport to Congress that claimed that the exercise had corroborated the\neffects-based operations concepts. When Van Riper complained that that was\nuntrue, he was promised, regarding MC \u201902, that \u201cnext year will be a free play\nand honest exercise.\u201d On the eve of MC \u201902, Kernan even declared: \u201cWe have a\nvery, very determined OPFOR, both live and simulation. ... this is free play.\nThe OPFOR has the ability to win here.\u201d\n\nThis did not mean that MC \u201902 was designed without constraints. It is common\nfor military simulations to test concepts that will inform future personnel,\ntraining, and procurement decisions. For example, there was only a 36-hour\nwindow during which the live-fire, forced-entry component of the experiment\nwas to occur. The participating forces \u2014 including from the 82nd Airborne\nDivision and 1st Marine Regiment \u2014 had been called off their normal training\nschedules, and would only be used in conjunction with the computer-simulated\nmaneuvers during that window. Also, both sides were permitted to reposition\ntheir forces at night, during which time neither could initiate attack. But\nmost notably, while the OPFOR was supposed to use only a limited set of\nmilitary capabilities that it was projected to have in 2007, the blue forces\nwere allowed to have command-and-control relationships, communication\nnetworks, and military capabilities that the Pentagon did not plan to field\nuntil well beyond 2007, including the airborne laser. The white cell was the\narchitect and manager of the exercise, and also monitored events, assessed the\nimpacts of various actions, and provided feedback to the blue and OPFOR teams.\nThe white cell, led by retired Army Gen. Gary Luck, also had the authority to\nintervene in order to ensure fair play and to verify that all the concepts\nwere tested under the exercise\u2019s resource and time constraints.\n\nAt the start of MC \u201902, to fulfill the forced-entry requirement, blue issued\nred an eight-point ultimatum, of which the final point was surrender. Red team\nleader Van Riper knew his country\u2019s political leadership could not accept\nthis, which he believed would lead the blue forces to directly intervene.\nSince the George W. Bush administration had recently announced the \u201cpreemption\ndoctrine,\u201d Van Riper decided that as soon as a U.S. Navy carrier battle group\nsteamed into the Gulf, he would \u201cpreempt the preemptors\u201d and strike first.\nOnce U.S. forces were within range, Van Riper\u2019s forces unleashed a barrage of\nmissiles from ground-based launchers, commercial ships, and planes flying low\nand without radio communications to reduce their radar signature.\nSimultaneously, swarms of speedboats loaded with explosives launched kamikaze\nattacks. The carrier battle group\u2019s Aegis radar system \u2014 which tracks and\nattempts to intercept incoming missiles \u2014 was quickly overwhelmed, and 19 U.S.\nships were sunk, including the carrier, several cruisers, and five amphibious\nships. \u201cThe whole thing was over in five, maybe ten minutes,\u201d Van Riper said.\n\nThe red team had struck a devastating blow against the blue team. The impact\nof the OPFOR\u2019s ability to render a U.S. carrier battle group \u2014 the centerpiece\nof the U.S. Navy \u2014 militarily worthless stunned most of the MC \u201902\nparticipants. Van Riper described the mood as \u201can eerie silence. Like people\ndidn\u2019t really know what to do next.\u201d Blue team leader Bell admitted that the\nOPFOR had \u201csunk my damn navy,\u201d and had inflicted \u201can extremely high rate of\nattrition, and a disaster, from which we all learned a great lesson.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kernan received an urgent phone call from Luck: \u201cSir, Van Riper\njust slimed all of the ships.\u201d Kernan recognized that this was bad news\nbecause it placed at risk JFCOM\u2019s ability to fulfill the remaining live-fire,\nforced-entry component of the exercise \u2014 a central component of MC \u201902. The\nactual forces were awaiting orders at Fort Bragg, off the coast of San Diego,\nand at the Fort Irwin National Training Center. Kernan recalled, \u201cI didn\u2019t\nhave a lot of choice. I had to do the forcible entry piece.\u201d He directed the\nwhite cell to simply refloat the virtual ships to the surface. Bell and his\nblue team \u2014 now including the live-fire forces operating under his direction \u2014\napplied the lessons from the initial attack and fended off subsequent\nengagements from the red team.\n\nVan Riper\u2019s red team prepared itself for an amphibious assault by the Marines.\nHe knew that the first wave would include the V-22 Osprey, a multi-mission,\ntilt-rotor aircraft that the Marines had in the pipeline but would not\nactually field for another five years. The V-22\u2019s twin 38-foot propellers gave\nthe transport aircraft a notoriously large identifiable radar signature that\ncould easily be identified and tracked with crude radars and surface-to-air\nmissiles. The red team was ready to begin shooting down the V-22s when Van\nRiper\u2019s chief of staff received a message from the white cell. Hostile fire\nagainst the V-22s or blue\u2019s C-130 troop transport planes was forbidden. The\nwhite cell also directed the chief of staff that the red team had to position\nits air defense assets out in the open so the blue forces could easily destroy\nthem. Even after some were not destroyed, the red team was forbidden to fire\nupon blue forces as they conducted a live airborne drop. Van Riper asked the\nwhite cell if his forces could at least deploy the chemical weapons that he\npossessed, but he was again denied.\n\nVan Riper was furious. Not only had the white cell\u2019s instructions compromised\nthe integrity of the entire process, but also his own chief of staff \u2014 a\nretired Army colonel \u2014 was receiving conflicting orders about how his force\nshould be deployed. When Van Riper went to Kernan to complain, he was told:\n\u201cYou are playing out of character. The OPFOR would never have done what you\ndid.\u201d Van Riper subsequently gathered the red team and told them to follow the\nchief of staff\u2019s orders. The independence that he believed a red team must be\ngranted to do its job had been corrupted. Six days into the exercise, he\nstepped down as commander and served as an advisor for the remaining 17 days.\nDuring that time, the blue team achieved most of its campaign plan objectives\nby destroying the OPFOR air and naval forces, securing the shipping lanes, and\ncapturing or neutralizing the red regime\u2019s WMD assets. The OPFOR was capable\nof partially preserving the red regime, but it was substantially weakened and\nits regional influence was much diminished.\n\nVan Riper was not willing to let the matter drop. He wrote up a report\ndetailing the numerous shortcomings of the war game, how it was controlled,\nand how the exercise could lead the Pentagon to have misplaced confidence in\nstill-untested military war-fighting concepts. He handed six hard copies of\nthe report to senior JFCOM leaders, but never received any feedback. However,\nunlike the other concept-development exercises, Van Riper believed that MC \u201902\nwas both scripted and carried out in a way that did not realistically reflect\nlikely future U.S. military capabilities or the threats posed by a thinking,\nmotivated adversary. As he recalled: \u201cWar-gaming is not normally corrupted,\nbut this whole thing was prostituted; it was a sham intended to prove what\nthey wanted to prove.\u201d\n\nBefore MC \u201902 even ended, Van Riper e-mailed several colleagues with his\nconcerns about the exercise. He believed that what had happened was going to\nleak to the media because so many of his OPFOR colleagues were irate. \u201cWhat I\ndidn\u2019t want to see happen was JFCOM putting out another press release with my\nname on it,\u201d as it had done after the previous year\u2019s Unified Vision 2001,\n\u201cvalidating a concept that had failed.\u201d Not unexpectedly, Van Riper\u2019s e-mail\nwas immediately leaked to the Army Times, which published a comprehensive\naccount: \u201cFixed war games? General says Millennium Challenge 02 was\n\u2018scripted.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe reaction to the leak was swift. Senior JFCOM and Pentagon officials were\nlivid that the retired lieutenant general had blown the whistle on MC \u201902.\nThey emphasized in press conferences that every major concept had been\nvalidated (there were 11 in total), while discounting what the OPFOR had been\nable to pull off. Kernan, who called Van Riper \u201ca pretty slick fellow,\u201d\nclaimed that the exercise was not about winning or losing, despite contrary\nstatements he had made weeks earlier. Kernan also admitted: \u201cYou [have] got to\nbe careful about the word \u2018free play.\u2019 And I used it, and I wished I hadn\u2019t.\u201d\nVice Adm. Martin Mayer, Kernan\u2019s deputy, claimed, \u201cI want to disabuse anybody\nof any notion that somehow the books were cooked.\u201d Vice Chairman of the Joint\nChiefs of Staff Gen. Peter Pace declared flatly, \u201cI absolutely believe that it\nwas not rigged.\u201d\n\nYet, JFCOM itself later concluded the opposite. The final JFCOM report on MC\n\u201902 ran 752 pages long and was not released to the public for 10 years. The\nreport detailed how the OPFOR had initially caught the blue team off guard, in\nlarge part because the blue team stuck closely to well-known and practiced\nU.S. military tactics. Moreover, to the extent that the blue team was\nperceived to be the winner, it was predominantly due to its quantitatively and\nqualitatively superior military capabilities. Meanwhile, the report admitted\nsignificant limitations and artificialities that were built into the war game.\nIt also details the unexpected shifts in the rules of engagement early on.\nAccording to the report, \u201cThese changes brought about some confusion and\npotentially provided the blue team operational advantages.\u201d\n\nFinally, the JFCOM report explicitly acknowledged:\n\n> As the exercise progressed, the OPFOR free-play was eventually constrained\n> to the point where the end state was scripted. This scripting ensured a blue\n> team operational victory and established conditions in the exercise for\n> transition operations.\n\nIn essence, the white cell determined that once the experiment was scheduled\nto end, the blue team would be allowed to win.\n\nAs a red teaming exercise, MC \u201902 was destined to experience shortcomings.\nBoth the red team and the targeted institution had preconceived objections\ngoing into the exercise. Van Riper thought that the untested concepts and\nmisplaced faith in then-nonexistent technologies were dangerous and\nunnecessarily risky for the military to pursue. Beyond being a prominent\nskeptic of the ongoing revolution in military affairs, he believed that some\nof these untested concepts would be utilized soon in the invasion of Iraq. Van\nRiper\u2019s red team set out to win outright, and thereby demonstrate the\nshortcomings of these concepts. Moreover, he doubted whether the red teaming\nprocess itself would be faithful to the principles of fair play that he had\nbeen promised by JFCOM, which, only three years old at the time, had a\nreputation for conducting unrealistic and scripted concept-development\nexercises.\n\nJFCOM and the Office of the Secretary of Defense were determined to validate\nthe principles and concepts that would support the advanced technological\nmilitary transformation that Rumsfeld and his senior aides had been insisting\nupon.\n\nMost importantly, MC \u201902 had a positive effect on many of the key\nparticipants. Bell described it as \u201ca watershed \u2018eureka\u2019 moment in the\napplication of red teaming.\u201d He believed that Van Riper did exactly what he\nwas supposed to do by attacking the blue forces \u201ca-doctrinally\u201d \u2014 meaning in a\nmanner that JFCOM was totally unprepared for \u2014 and that everybody learned from\nthe results. Soon after MC \u201902, Bell was promoted to four-star general: \u201cThe\nmilitary and civilian leadership must have figured out that, after the\nsignificant butt-kicking I had experienced, I must have learned something.\u201d\nBell became one of the most outspoken proponents of red teaming, and estimates\nthat he directed the formation of at least 20 distinct red teams while in\ncommand positions in Europe and on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nHowever, a different enduring impact was in the minds of the senior military\nofficials who were deployed from the United States to Afghanistan and Iraq or\nprovided support in the years that followed MC \u201902. There, the inherently\nmessy realities of combat negated the aspirational acronyms that conceptual\ndevelopment exercises were supposed to prove. Even during MC \u201902, Kernan\nrecalled that many of the participants were understandably more focused on\ngetting ready to go to war than on the exercise, which probably harmed the\nprocess itself. \u201cI told Rumsfeld afterwards, \u2018If you want to do this again,\nyou have to properly resource it, and if national priorities change, you have\nto be willing to scrub it.\u2019\u201d Yet Rumsfeld and other senior Pentagon officials\nwere unable or unwilling to hear the bad news that came out of the exercise.\n\nMC \u201902 has become a shorthand reference for denigrating the cutting-edge and\nunrealistic notions of military transformation that characterized the Rumsfeld\nera. A concept-development exercise that was intended to socialize the\nmilitary around the inevitability of a leap-ahead, futuristic transformation\nultimately left precisely the opposite impression. That it required a\n$250-million red team simulation, and a motivated and justifiably angered\nformer general officer, to make this apparent, suggests that it was a highly\nuseful experiment after all.\n\nMicah Zenko is author of the new book, Red Team: How to Succeed by Thinking\nLike the Enemy, and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nPhoto credit: Petty Officer 3rd Class Amanda Williams, U.S. Navy\n\nCommentary\n\n  * ### Commentary\n\n#### Small Ocean, Big Hype: Arctic Myths and Realities\n\n  * ### Horns of a Dilemma\n\n#### The Evolution of China\u2019s Navy\n\n  * ### Members\n\n#### Rewind and Reconnoiter: Russia\u2019s Invasion of Ukraine and NATO\u2019s Crisis of\nNuclear Credibility with Tyler Bowen\n\n### ABOUT\n\n  * MISSION\n  * PEOPLE\n  * FOUNDER'S CLUB\n  * CONTACT\n\n### MEMBERS\n\n  * JOIN\n  * WAR HALL\n\n### PODCASTS\n\n  * WOTR\n  * NET ASSESSMENT\n  * JAW-JAW\n  * HORNS OF A DILEMMA\n\n### GET MORE WAR ON THE ROCKS\n\n#### SUPPORT OUR MISSION AND GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT\n\nBECOME A MEMBER\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n### NEWSLETTER\n\nSigning up for this newsletter means you agree to our data policy\n\n  * PRIVACY POLICY\n\n|\n\n  * TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\n|\n\n  * SITEMAP\n\n|\n\n  * COPYRIGHT \u00a9 2024 METAMORPHIC MEDIA.
