Then the case went sideways.\n\n## The probe revealed widespread sports-betting among college athletes \u2013 and a\ndisjointed system to keep corruption in check.\n\nBy Albert Samaha\n\nApril 16, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EDT\n\nIn Iowa, college athletes' gambling has received more scrutiny than in other\nstates. (Illustration by Michael Domine/The Washington Post;iStock/AP/Zach\nBoyden-Holmes/The Register /USA TODAY network)\n\nListen\n\n15 min\n\nShare\n\nComment131\n\nSave\n\nOne day last spring, Isaiah Lee, a defensive lineman for Iowa State\nUniversity, got a visit from a state police investigator who wanted to talk\nabout something on a lot of fans\u2019 minds: sports betting.\n\nLike many young Americans, Lee had begun wagering on games lately. He was old\nenough to legally gamble in Iowa, but the NCAA bars athletes from sports\nbetting, with strict penalties for violations that range from mandatory\ntraining (for any bet at all) to an outright ban (for wagering on their own\nteam).\n\nMark Ludwick, the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigations agent, told Lee\nhe was working on a case focused \u201csolely on gaming operators\u201d such as\nDraftKings and FanDuel, according to a motion filed by defense attorneys\nsummarizing Ludwick\u2019s deposition for the case. He even \u201creassured\u201d Lee he\nfaced \u201cno adverse or criminal consequences.\u201d So Lee opened up. He had created\na FanDuel account in his girlfriend\u2019s name, he admitted, and wagered $885 on a\nvariety of events \u2014 including 12 Iowa State football games.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhen Ludwick reported the interview to his supervisor, the agent quickly\nrealized his assurances to Lee were hollow, according to the summary. His boss\n\u201ccongratulated\u201d him for \u201cobtaining a confession.\u201d Ludwick said he then\n\u201cadvised his superiors that he would no longer participate in the\ninvestigation, and requested reassignment,\u201d according to court records.\n\nThe investigation pushed forward, and three months later prosecutors charged\nLee and nearly two dozen other athletes from Iowa State and the University of\nIowa with crimes related to their gambling activity, spanning from misdemeanor\nunderage betting to felony identity theft for using an account registered\nunder someone else. The NCAA acted, too, suspending all of the players.\n\nSome of the most decorated athletes in the state were implicated. Paniro\nJohnson, a champion wrestler, wagered $45,640 across 1,283 bets, including\nroughly two dozen on Iowa State sporting events, according to a criminal\ncomplaint. Iowa State starting quarterback Hunter Dekkers, authorities said,\nwagered \u201cmore than $2,799\u201d across 366 bets, including a 2021 Iowa State\nfootball game in which he served as a backup. He was one of at least nine\nathletes accused of breaking a long-standing sports taboo: gambling on their\nown games.\n\nThe unprecedented crackdown illuminated how deeply the expansion of legal\nonline gambling has infiltrated some college locker rooms, spurring calls for\nreform that include proposals to ban prop bets in college sports and to\ncurtail harassment by fans.\n\nBut records and interviews with people involved in the case also demonstrate\nhow disjointed the efforts are to hold sportsbooks, schools and athletes\naccountable, spotlighting the tensions emerging between the growing popularity\nof online sports betting and a regulatory system erected on the fly to contain\nit.\n\nWhile the NCAA maintains strict rules against betting, gambling operators have\nadvertised on university campuses and targeted young adults as potential\ncustomers. Law enforcement units designed to root out bookies and organized\ncrime rings find themselves toiling to unearth infractions in an industry no\nlonger hiding in the shadows.\n\n\u201cThis case was investigated like a major, sprawling criminal conspiracy,\u201d said\nMark Weinhardt, a defense attorney representing eight of the athletes. \u201cIt\nyielded some guilty pleas to the equivalent of traffic tickets.\u201d\n\nThe only crimes the athletes in Iowa were accused of were gambling before\nturning 21 or using an account that didn\u2019t belong to them. The only\nconvictions resulted in a $645 fine. Meanwhile, some of the case\u2019s\ninvestigators have raised questions about the roots of their own probe. In the\ndeposition summarized in court records, Ludwick alleged that DCI obtained its\nevidence through illegal searches of a gambling database.\n\n\u201cNumerous other Special Agents,\u201d he said in his deposition, \u201cshare the same\nbelief and have refused to participate in this investigation.\u201d\n\nNone of the agents involved responded to messages seeking comment. The Iowa\nDepartment of Public Safety, which oversees DCI, declined to answer questions\nbut issued a statement defending the probe, saying \u201cagents conferred with\nlegal experts\u201d throughout.\n\nThe athletes in the cases, which have all concluded with plea deals or\ndismissals, declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to interview requests. Their\nsports careers were all derailed or ended, their families and attorneys said.\nSome have transferred, seeking a fresh start. Others didn\u2019t have that option.\nLee\u2019s violation of NCAA policy meant he lost his senior season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being punished for a lifetime by adults who didn\u2019t follow rules,\u201d\nsaid Van Plumb, a lawyer representing Lee and several other players. \u201cThis\nwill haunt them for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\n###\n\nOpening the floodgates\n\nIn the years since the Supreme Court struck down the federal ban on sports\ngambling, the sports betting industry has boomed, with 38 states now allowing\nonline wagers that before 2018 could be made only at casinos or through\nbookies.\n\nIowa was an early adopter. It legalized sports betting in 2019, with 18\noperators rushing into the market. Last year, bettors in the state placed more\nthan $2 billion worth of wagers, generating $186 million in corporate profits\nand $13 million in taxes.\n\nIn 2021, Iowa\u2019s Department of Criminal Investigations started a unit focused\non sports betting. That year, a member of the unit, Special Agent Brian\nSanger, wrote a memo urging the state\u2019s gambling regulator, the Iowa Racing\nand Gaming Commission, to license tracking software from a company called\nGeoComply, according to emails obtained by the Des Moines Register.\n\nThe system, installed in Iowa by September 2022, compiles geolocation data on\nevery account created and every bet placed on many of the country\u2019s biggest\nonline sports betting platforms, including DraftKings and FanDuel. Through the\ncompany\u2019s analytics tool, Kibana, which flags clusters of heavy activity,\nclients can home in on a location deemed suspicious, such as a prison or a\nhigh school, and view every device that opens a betting app there to look into\npotential violations of gambling laws.\n\nBut the state licensed the sophisticated software without establishing clear\npolicies on how exactly the database can be used in criminal investigations.\n\nUnder state law, \u201ccustomer records,\u201d \u201csurveillance records\u201d and other\ninformation gambling companies provide to the Iowa Racing and Gaming\nCommission are \u201cconfidential, unless otherwise ordered by a court, by the\nlawful custodian of the records, or by another person duly authorized to\nrelease such information.\u201d How GeoComply, a third-party contractor holding\nthose records, fits into that clause remains up for interpretation \u2014 Iowa\ncourts have yet to rule on the issue.\n\nUnder its terms of service, GeoComply placed that determination in the hands\nof the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, the regulator licensing the\nsoftware. In an August 2022 email, viewed by The Washington Post, the\ncommission\u2019s administrator, Brian Ohorilko, explained to GeoComply that his\nagency would authorize DCI to use the system only under certain circumstances,\nciting the Iowa legal code containing the confidentially clause. But his\nlanguage listing those conditions was vague and brief, including that criminal\ninvestigators could \u201creview abnormal wagering activity or patterns that may\nindicate a concern about the integrity\u201d of a sporting event. He did not\naddress who was supposed to decide what counted as \u201cabnormal\u201d or a \u201cpattern\u201d\nor whether investigators needed to present any evidence before launching such\na review. With those loose guidelines in place, GeoComply granted DCI agents\nlogin access to Kibana.\n\nOhorilko, who is no longer with the commission, didn\u2019t respond to an interview\nrequest. In response to questions seeking more information about the Kibana\napproval process, Tina Eick, the administrator who replaced Ohorilko, laid the\nresponsibly for legal compliance on DCI: \u201cIRGC has no role in how DCI conducts\ntheir investigations,\u201d she said.\n\nSanger seemed to have a more straight forward understanding of what the law\nallowed. In his 2021 memo, he said he believed GeoComply could \u201cshare all\ntheir data\u201d with \u201cstate investigators,\u201d according to the Register.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn December 2022, Sanger began investigating gambling at Iowa universities,\naccording to his deposition, which is summarized in court records filed by\ndefense attorneys. After examining activity across the campus, he narrowed his\nfocus, setting up a \u201cdigital fence\u201d around the University of Iowa\u2019s athletic\nfacilities. According to the deposition summary, Sanger said he \u201ccannot\nremember\u201d what sparked the inquiry \u201cbut that he was concerned about things\nsuch as people infiltrating Iowa\u2019s sports team to gain insider information or\nmatch fixing.\u201d He soon expanded the probe to include Iowa State\u2019s sports\nfacilities.\n\n\u201cIndividuals with access to these facilities would possess insider\ninformation, could impact outcomes, and tended to be underage,\u201d DPS\ncommissioner Stephan Bayens said in a statement. \u201cSportsbooks must seek to\nprohibit sports wagering by coaches, athletic trainers and players.\u201d\n\nSanger did not apply for a warrant before setting up the digital fence and\nprobing GeoComply\u2019s database, court records show, and attorneys representing\nthe athletes argue he had no probable cause to inspect the athletic\nfacilities. \u201cThis was done without a warrant, tips, complaints or evidence\nthat illegal activity was occurring,\u201d Plumb wrote in a motion.\n\nInvestigators zeroed in on 22 accounts, issuing subpoenas to FanDuel,\nDraftKings and GeoComply seeking records that would identify who the accounts\nwere registered to. Many of the accounts belonged to relatives or other\nassociates of athletes, \u201csuggesting fraudulent activity or identity theft,\u201d\nBayens said in his statement. Some of those athletes were younger than 21, the\nstate\u2019s legal betting age.\n\nAmong the athletes in the probe was Eyioma Uwazurike, who played football at\nIowa State before getting drafted by the Denver Broncos in 2022. Under an\naccount registered to his fianc\u00e9e, Uwazurike placed roughly 800 bets from\nFebruary 2021 to August 2023, records show, including on two Iowa State games\nhe played in and five Broncos games while he was on the team. (The NFL later\nsuspended him indefinitely.)\n\nOther bets resembled the one he placed on an NBA game, cited in court records:\n$10 on a parlay for Mikal Bridges, then of the Phoenix Suns, and Terance Mann\nof the Los Angeles Clippers to each hit three or more three-pointers in a\ngame.\n\nAcross 21\u20442 years of gambling, he wagered roughly $20,000.\n\nOn May 3, 2023, DCI agent Heather Duenow and a local Colorado officer showed\nup at Uwazurike\u2019s home in Arapahoe County, Colo., with a search warrant for\nhis and his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s phones. Duenow gave the impression the investigation\ntargeted the gaming companies in addition to the people placing the bets,\naccording to a recording of the interaction.\n\n\u201cPart of this is also shedding light on the industry and what they\u2019re supposed\nto do in regards to protecting and abiding by state laws in Iowa,\u201d Duenow\nsaid. \u201cI\u2019m not here to get a bunch of people that went to where I just\ngraduated from in trouble.\u201d\n\nSimilar meetings took place in Iowa\u2019s Johnson and Story counties.\n\nBrad Hanika did not hear any panic in his son\u2019s voice when 23-year-old DeShawn\nHanika called to inform him that investigators had shown up to campus to seize\nhis cellphone and that of several of his teammates.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t worried,\u201d Brad said. \u201cHe had no idea it was over what it was over.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have made no claims of match-fixing, which is against the law.\nInvestigators, though, seized on smaller alleged crimes of the student bettors\nand went to prosecutors with the case.\n\nJohnson County Attorney Rachel Zimmermann Smith, whose district includes\nIowa\u2019s campus, only charged student-athletes who were underage when they\ngambled, an infraction that carries a $645 fine. Zimmermann Smith tacked on\ncounts for tampering with records for using someone else\u2019s account, an\naggravated misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of two years behind bars.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory County Attorney Timothy Meals, whose district includes Iowa State\u2019s\ncampus, charged every athlete who used another person\u2019s account, applying\nfelony identity theft counts against Lee, Johnson, Uwazurike and others.\n\nZimmermann Smith and Meals did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBy exposing their gambling activity, investigators also delivered the athletes\nto the NCAA\u2019s wrath. The nine athletes whose wagers involved their own teams\nface a permanent loss of eligibility. The others were suspended for all or\npart of their seasons. In total, roughly 40 college athletes, including more\nthan a dozen who didn\u2019t face criminal charges, received NCAA sanctions based\non evidence of their gambling activity that surfaced during the state\ninvestigation.\n\nThe case laid out a cautionary tale that probably will echo through college\nlocker rooms across the country as coaches and athletic directors warn players\nabout the perils of gambling. But it also left a trail of critics wondering\njust how these athletes ended up under a police spotlight that doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe shining anywhere else.\n\n\u201cWhy those two universities only were targeted?\u201d Iowa football coach Kirk\nFerentz said to reporters. \u201cThere are college students at all kinds of\nuniversities. Sounds like it\u2019s only athletes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are Iowa and Iowa State athletes the only ones in this?\u201d Iowa State\nwrestling coach Kevin Dresser said to the Des Moines Register. \u201cIt just seems\nto be very confusing to me as to why this even happened.\u201d\n\n###\n\n\u2018Philosophical differences\u2019\n\nTo better understand the case against his son, Brad Hanika, a fire\ninvestigator in Kansas, made a series of calls to Ohorilko, the administrator\nat the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, and recorded the calls, court\nrecords show. Those calls gave defense lawyers their first indication the\ninvestigation had raised concerns among state officials.\n\nHanika asked whether the commission, which has unrestricted access to the\nGeoComply database, had tipped off the DCI about gambling activity among\nstudent-athletes.\n\nOhorilko said the commission wasn\u2019t involved in the investigation, but he\ndeclined to give more information. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get myself in criminal\ntrouble,\u201d Ohorilko said in one call, according to a transcript.\n\n\u201cI have strong feelings but it just wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me to tell\nyou,\u201d Ohorilko said. \u201cI do think there\u2019s maybe some philosophical differences\nin how things took place.\u201d\n\nOn a call in September, Ohorilko added: \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t agree with how\nthings have been handled.\u201d\n\nAfter prosecutors missed a filing deadline in Hanika\u2019s case, they dropped the\ncharges. Hanika transferred to play football at Kansas.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nEleven other athletes pleaded guilty to underage gambling in exchange for the\ntampering charges getting dropped. Those who weren\u2019t charged with underage\ngambling, including Isaiah Lee and Eyioma Uwazurike, had no comparable lesser\ncharge to plead down to. So rather than negotiate a plea deal, Lee and\nUwazurike, along with Paniro Johnson and Iowa State football player Jirehl\nBrock, decided to fight their identity theft charges and demand more\ninformation about the investigation\u2019s origins. That choice pulled the thread\nthat ultimately unraveled the case.\n\nIn January, their lawyers questioned Sanger and Ludwick in depositions,\nrevealing that investigators did not obtain a warrant before searching the\ngeolocation database and that DCI\u2019s own agents were divided on the merits of\nthe case.\n\nIn February, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission handed over email exchanges\nwith GeoComply from the weeks and months after the charges were filed. In one\nemail, a GeoComply official informs the commission the company was cutting off\nDCI agents\u2019 access to the software, saying investigators \u201cmay have exceeded\nthe intended and outlined scope of its Kibana access-and-use privileges.\u201d\n\nDefense lawyers filed a motion arguing state authorities had withheld critical\nevidence in the case by not disclosing that GeoComply had cut off DCI access\nfollowing the college athlete investigation. In response to the revelation,\nStory County prosecutors retreated, asking the judge to dismiss the charges\nagainst Lee, Johnson, Brock and Uwazurike. By early March, the criminal case\nwas over.\n\nAnother case is just starting. According to Plumb, at least 37 of the college\nathletes who faced NCAA penalties because of the criminal investigation are\nplanning to sue the state, claiming authorities violated their Fourth\nAmendment rights.\n\n  * All the Capitals\u2019 playoff scenarios entering Game 82 in Philadelphia\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nAll the Capitals\u2019 playoff scenarios entering Game 82 in Philadelphia\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\n  * Pending free agent Tyus Jones feels right at home with the Wizards\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nPending free agent Tyus Jones feels right at home with the Wizards\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n  * Nationals prepare to celebrate five-year anniversary of World Series title\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nNationals prepare to celebrate five-year anniversary of World Series title\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": false}
