(More)\n\nIn his new book Deep Utopia, Nick Bostrom asks how creatures very much like\nhim might want to live for eons if they had total peace, vast wealth, and full\neternal control of extremely competent AI that could do everything better than\nthey. He mostly tries to list as many sensible possibilities as possible.\n\nBoston writes engagingly, though not concisely. He doesn\u2019t overcome the usual\nimpression that it is pretty hard to imagine compelling utopias, though I\nthink he does help clarify some of his life goals.\n\nBut I found it pretty hard to be motivated by his key question. In a future of\ncreatures vastly more capable than us I\u2019m far more interested in what those\nbetter creatures would do than in what a creature like me now might do there.\nAnd I find the idea of creatures like me long being rich, at peace, and in\nfull control of such a world quite unlikely.\n\nFurthermore, in whatever actual future scenarios end up being the closest to\nhis hypothetical, I just don\u2019t believe that creatures at our level of ability\nthere would have values much like Bostrom\u2019s values today. Bostrom asks his\nquestion about people pretty close to him, leftist academics in rich Western\nsocieties. Others in our world today, or folks from past civs, would find much\nless in his book on how to fulfill their desires in his hypothetical scenario.\nAfter all, Bostrom says little about honor, of enjoying the lamentations of\nthose you conquer, or of having \u201cdescendants as numerous as the stars in the\nsky and as the sand on the seashore.\u201d\n\nApparently folks in the USSR once wanted to find aliens because they assumed\nthat, as aliens must be very smart, they\u2019d be communists. But it seems crazy\nto expect a stance less than a century old to feel central to aliens a billion\nyears more advanced. Similarly, a great many futurists try to imagine crazy\nadvanced technology and social institutions in the context of cultural values\nquite close to their own, even if little like those values around here existed\neven a few centuries ago.\n\nThe future will be strange. And as hard as it is to imagine changes to\ntechnology, institutions, and the universe, it can be even harder to imagine\nfuture cultures. But I can assure you, they will change, a lot.\n\n### Subscribe to Overcoming Bias\n\nBy Robin Hanson \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nThis is a blog on why we believe and do what we do, why we pretend otherwise,\nhow we might do better, and what our descendants might do, if they don't all\ndie.\n\n44 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n4 Restacks\n\n44\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Bostrom\u2019s Deep Utopia\n\nwww.overcomingbias.com\n\n13\n\nShare\n\n13 Comments\n\nMo DiddlyMo\u2019s Newsletter21 hrs agoAt equilibrium, creatures in an ecosystem\neither contribute to that ecosystem or are considered parasites.
