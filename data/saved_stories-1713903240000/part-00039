In particular that question mentions that you want\n\"all nodes more or less equidistant\". Searching on the internet, I didn't find\nmuch evidence that this is how go is played on other topologies.\n\nThere are a few reasons why I doubt torus/sphere go has been played on actual\nspheres or tori. Firstly - who has a suitable torus lying around that they\ncould use? Secondly - getting the stones to stay in place would be awkward,\nand examining the position would be even worse!\n\nInstead I suggest that the usual* way to convert a flat board game into one on\na sphere/torus/Klein bottle is by imagining that the edges are joined up. For\nsome diagrams of how the edges of the board should be joined see here.\n\nI found a few references to playing tic tac toe and gomoku (5-in-a-row) on\ndifferent surfaces, and one to playing go. All of these assumed a standard\nsquare grid with the edges defined to be connected in some way. The main\ndifferences from standard go seem to be:\n\n  * Fewer corners and edges: A cylindrical board has just two edges, and a torus or Klein bottle surface game has no corners or edges.\n  * The lack of corners and edges makes it harder to create immortal groups.\n\nI did also come across a game of go on a cylindrical surface which was not\njust made of a standard board with edges connected. Each point still has four\nliberties, but the regions between edges are not all square:\n\n*I'm not sure a 'usual' actually exists here, but this is at least the usual way to draw diagrams on these surfaces in mathematics.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Apr 13, 2017 at 12:19\n\nCommunityBot\n\n1\n\nanswered Aug 18, 2013 at 15:25\n\ntttppptttppp\n\n9,32355 gold badges4545 silver badges8484 bronze badges\n\n4\n\n  * 3\n\n+1 - Well, I could envision a steel go board in a spherical or toroidal form,\ncombined with magnetic \"stones\". Still tough to play and visualize, as you\ncannot see the entire \"board\". In fact, this seems a serious problem for such\na variant. Worse, a Klein bottle board might be a bit difficult to create for\nsale. :)\n\n\u2013 user3264\n\nAug 19, 2013 at 3:12\n\n  * If you play on a standard board, but consider all edge points to wrap around to the other side, you've got a torus. Imagine taking a sheet of paper and rolling it into a tube. Now, take the two ends and bend the tube to connect them. The paper would tear/crumple, but you've got the idea.\n\n\u2013 Dane\n\nAug 23, 2013 at 16:18\n\n  * @Dane That's right. However if you add a twist before joining the first pair of edges then you get a Klein bottle. Have a look at the wikipedia link to see the other surfaces you can make.\n\n\u2013 tttppp\n\nAug 24, 2013 at 6:18\n\n  * It's probably worth pointing out that you can't actually make a Klein bottle-it's a shape that needs four dimensional space. But in theory you would get a Klein bottle!\n\n\u2013 tttppp\n\nAug 24, 2013 at 6:28\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n3\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nI found this program that a guy at university made to abstract Go to any\ntopology, using any number of vertices as well, it is called 3D Tashoku Go.\nOther than as a curiosity I haven't seen anyone take play in this way as a\nserious variant of Go.\n\nJust changing the size of the grid leads to games that feel very different\nfrom a standard 19x19 game.\n\nYou shouldn't let that really dissuade you from exploring weird variants of\nGo, the game was originally played on a 17x17 board and I've seen people play\non up to 31x31 on KGS at times.\n\nThese games are vastly different strategically. At 23x23 and greater the rush\nfor the corners and sides feel less important than the fight for the center.\nLife is easy to be had and the game feels fairly relaxed and open.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Jun 9, 2014 at 17:14\n\nzehaevazehaeva\n\n3122 bronze badges\n\n2\n\n  * 1\n\nLooks like he's not active anymore, but the kgs archives still have game\nrecords for user beerslayer, who played almost exclusively 37x37 games.\n\n\u2013 Gregor Thomas\n\nJun 9, 2014 at 17:30\n\n  * I tried to play a lot of 37 x 37 games on KGS.

Through having a bottom left to top right, and a top left to\nbottom right diagonal go through the centre point. Through having 3 to 5 of\nthese pairs of lines, they significantly change the strategy, also making it\nmore interesting to amateur players. Of course this has significant FTA(first\nturn advantage), which is another reason its useful with large skill\ndifferences.\n\nFinally, with the few diagonal lines running along the board, connect these\nlines at the edges so that they are continuous, while the normal\nvertical/horizontal grid is bound.\n\nNB:Alternative rule: Territory only needs to surround the regular\nvertical/horizontal lines, not the diagonals.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 3.0\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Oct 20, 2014 at 6:01\n\nanswered Oct 19, 2014 at 5:20\n\nBraytonBrayton\n\n11344 bronze badges\n\n2\n\n  * So a number of nodes have 6 liberties?\n\n\u2013 mart\n\nOct 19, 2014 at 19:32\n\n  * 1\n\nIt is like a regular Goban, except with an \"X\" cross through the middle\npoints, and this X is fractal, with multiple diagonals.

Although this board game is still in its early stages, it offers a\nvast expanse of unknown game space to explore. Prior to my experiment, the\ntypical approach was to use a conventional grid-like topology. However, I\nintroduced the concept of Archimedean solids to this domain. As we know, the\nancient Greeks were aware of only five Platonic solids, which is a\nmathematical theorem. However, the vertices of these Platonic solids are too\nfew to make the game interesting. Therefore, I explored the table of\nArchimedean solids\u2014an extension of Platonic solids\u2014and found the snub\ndodecahedron particularly interesting. It most closely resembles a sphere and\nfeatures 60 vertices, 150 edges, and 92 faces, totaling 302 game elements,\nwhich is complex enough. This shows the potential for possibilities, where we\ncan incorporate vertices, edges, and faces\u2014all these geometric elements\u2014into\nan engaging game space. After weeks of research, I discovered a unique board\ntopology that naturally accommodates all 302 elements while still adhering to\nthe traditional Go game rule set.\n\nTo ensure the complex board is easily recognizable, I studied the symmetries\nof the solid and ultimately devised a solution. The design features four\ndistinct 'continents' distributed across the sphere, separated by 'oceans'. In\nthe diagram above, I used a specific color to identify one continent. However,\nglobally, there are four symmetrical axes, which influenced the layout shown\nin the diagram below. This symmetrical arrangement not only enhances visual\nclarity but also underscores the strategic possibilities inherent in the\ngame's topology.\n\nIt should be noted that the terms 'continents' and 'oceans' are purely\nsymbolic labels within the game's design. They do not directly influence\ngameplay decisions, similar to the origin and star points in traditional Go.\nThese labels serve merely as visual aids to help players navigate the complex\ntopology of the board.\n\nThe rules have been slightly modified in terms of area calculation; in this\nversion, pentagons and triangles contribute differently to the final game\nresults. This adjustment accommodates the unique geometry of the board,\nensuring that the varying sizes and shapes of the regions are accurately\nreflected in the scoring.\n\nThe final diagram illustrates how the seven black stones are placed to form a\nshape that possesses sufficient liberties to survive. This configuration is\nthe minimal in the game.\n\nPlease check with this https://github.com/spherical-go/polyclash\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered 2 hours ago\n\nMountainMountain\n\n10122 bronze badges\n\nNew contributor\n\nMountain is a new contributor to this site.
