He hung out with some kids who decided to go to Harvard and\nStanford, and a bunch of kids who decided on Duke. What was similar about all\nof them? They talked openly about having autism.\n\nAt lunch one kid said to Z, \"Do you know you have autism?\"\n\nAnd Z said, \"Yeah. Do you?\"\n\nAnd then a bunch of the kids at the table said they had it. That's all. Then\neveryone moved on to another topic.\n\nKids are so far ahead of parents in how they think about autism. So I've been\ntrying to focus my own research on what makes autistic people so special. Why\nare they overrepresented among top colleges, top earners, artistic success\nstories?\n\nOCD means inventive\n\nThe idea of disability is contextual, and culture determines what we think is\nuseful. For example, OCD is a label for obsessive people, but expertise comes\nfrom obsessive interests as well. Each of the kids asked each other, \"how did\nyou get in\" or \"what was your main essay about?\" and they were really\nanswering the question \"what were you obsessed with in high school?\"\n\nWe can also think of OCD as a way to find fulfillment through consistency. For\nexample Z was able to succeed at cello because he had an obsession with\nplaying in tune -- which is very difficult to do but fulfilling to people who\nplay string instruments very well .\n\nAlso, the process for invention is trial and error. Another word for that is\nOCD. Few people have enough patience for trial and error to actually invent\nsomething. But someone with OCD doesn't need patience to be inventive -- they\nfeel fulfilled even when they're failing because they focus on process.\n\nADHD means hyperfocused\n\nADHD means it's impossible to focus on something boring, but the ability to\nfocus on something interesting is extraordinary. Among kids with ADHD\ninterestingness is the highest value.\n\nTop colleges look for spiked applicants which means admissions committees\ndon't want well-rounded kids but rather kids who have a natural tendency to\nbecome an expert. Because experts make a community more interesting and they\nare more likely to place high value on other interesting kids.\n\nZ stayed overnight in a dorm room and his host was a soccer player who just\nreceived a multi-million dollar contract to play in England. Z said, \"He's\n7'2\" and I almost never saw him because he was at soccer practice.\" Other kids\nmight be sad about the lack of interaction but Z loved being surrounded by\nkids who were hyper focused on their interest.\n\nDyslexia means information-driven\n\nThe type of dyslexia autistic kids have is around reading comprehension. We\nare great at finding the answer to reading comprehension questions, but we\nhave a hard time with open-ended questions about characters e.g. class\ndiscussion. We just don't care.\n\nWhile neurotypical people connect to others by narrating daily life or sharing\npersonal feelings, autistic people connect with people by sharing ideas and\nknowledge. Each group has the same level of drive to connect to other people,\nbut to different ends.\n\nThe way this tendency translates to reading is we get the information we need\nand move on. The way it looks in college is lots of kids at top schools\nconnecting by sharing ideas.\n\nSocial awkwardness means social activist\n\nCognitive empathy is understanding how someone feels and why they feel that\nway. Autistic people are not very good at this type of empathy. But caring\nabout someone is different -- that's affective empathy which is intact in\nautistic people. The result is autistic kids can feel empathy for people as a\nwhole but we have trouble empathizing with individual experiences.\n\nThis explains the autistic tendency toward social justice. Autistic people\nhave empathy for the greater good and this makes autistic kids most likely to\nact in a leadership role to instigate change. When colleges say they're\nlooking for leaders, they are, in effect, looking for people with empathy for\nthe whole rather than for individuals.\n\nAutistic kids also have compromised person-perception which means we can't\naccurately predict an individual's intentions, emotions, or thoughts. But,\nlike all deficits in our brain, it makes room for our brain to focus on\nsomething else. And in this case it's understanding societal intentions and\nneeds.\n\nAutistic social-cognitive skills are extremely high. This means we can predict\nthe needs of a group before the individuals are aware of those needs. Our\nability to predict social phenomena and psycho-social trends enables us to\ncome up with ideas like \"social loafing\" and \"group think\".\n\nPattern seeker means problem solver\n\nAutistic people are drawn to patterns and the systems that create those\npatterns. This can be the way a frisbee moves, how tidal waves emerge, coin\ncollecting, or office politics. The need for systematic thinking in society is\nhuge, and autistic people can solve problems because they see the systems\ndifferently.\n\nFor example, a kid Z met applied from one of the poorest areas on earth. The\nkid got to learning everything there is about US colleges and the application\nprocess, and then systemizing his efforts. He applied to the top 20 schools,\nand schools that offer international scholarships. He got into two colleges:\nDuke and Princeton. That's a great example of how systematizing is a huge\nadvantage.\n\nI listened to Z talk about the kids, and it was so fun to hear how their\nprocess for becoming experts. Teaching me about patterns is my love language.\nI think that's what autistic kids think when they meet each other: relief, and\nexcitement. And that's what makes being together at college so fun.\n\nWant to learn more about these topics and next-generation autism?
