This can\nbe a worthy endeavor, but at what cost?\n\nMay is Mental Health Awareness Month, and here at Founder Reports, we\u2019re\ncommitted to helping entrepreneurs with the specific issues they face. Over\nthe past month, we\u2019ve conducted a survey of entrepreneurs and business owners\nfrom around the world (227 entrepreneurs representing 46 countries) to gather\ninsightful data to help us better serve our audience.\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper to uncover the highlights of the data. The full survey\nresults are included at the end.\n\n## 17 Mental Health Statistics for Entrepreneurs\n\n### 1) 87.7% of entrepreneurs struggle with at least one mental health issue\n\nOur survey asked participants to indicate which mental health issues they face\nin their daily lives. Twelve specific issues were listed, plus the option to\nselect \u201cnone of the above.\u201d 87.7% of respondents selected at least one mental\nhealth issue, and only 12.3% said that they don\u2019t struggle with any of the\nlisted issues.\n\nBeyond the fa\u00e7ade of success lie silent struggles. We\u2019ll highlight some\nspecifics below, but here\u2019s a quick summary of the results:\n\n#### Challenges:\n\n  * Anxiety: 50.2%\n  * High stress: 45.8%\n  * Financial worries: 39.2%\n  * Burnout: 34.4%\n  * Imposter syndrome: 31.7%\n  * Poor work-life balance: 26.9%\n  * Loneliness or isolation: 26.9%\n  * Insomnia or other sleep disorders: 21.6%\n  * Depression: 19.8%\n  * Relationship strain: 13.7%\n  * Hopelessness: 12.3%\n  * No direction or purpose: 11.9%\n  * None of the above: 12.3%\n\n### 2) 50.2% of entrepreneurs struggle with anxiety\n\nOur survey showed that more than half of entrepreneurs struggle with anxiety.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the high-pressure environment makes entrepreneurs more\nsusceptible to anxiety, but our survey showed the concerning reality that many\nentrepreneurs face.\n\nAccording to a study by the National Institute of Mental Health, 31.1% of U.S.\nadults (general population) experience an anxiety disorder at some point in\ntheir lives. Although 31.1% is a significant portion of the population, it\u2019s\ndrastically lower than the percentage of entrepreneurs who struggle with\nanxiety.\n\n#### Pushing Past Anxiety\n\n> \u201cIn my work, we don\u2019t work on trying to prevent anxiety. Anxiety is a\n> feeling just like happiness and madness. Feelings are temporary internal\n> states that we want to approach non-judgementally and descriptively. If the\n> focus is on preventing anxiety, that\u2019s focusing on the outcome which we\n> cannot control. We want our attention on the process which is under our\n> control.\u201d\n>\n> Joanna Hardis, LISW-S\n\nWe published an interview with Joanna Hardis, LISW-S, that provides practical\ntips entrepreneurs and business owners can implement to handle anxiety. If\nyou\u2019re among the 50.2% of entrepreneurs who face challenges with anxiety,\nplease refer to this resource.\n\n### 3) 34.4% of entrepreneurs experience burnout\n\nLong hours and a singular focus on work often lead to burnout, and our survey\nshowed that more than 1/3 of entrepreneurs face this issue.\n\n> \u201cEntrepreneurs, while often finding joy and fulfillment in their autonomy\n> and achievements, may experience burnout differently due to their unique\n> work dynamics. Their work and personal lives often intersect, intensifying\n> the impact of burnout. This can erode their self-esteem and spark\n> existential doubts more acutely than in traditional jobs.\u201d\n>\n> Burnout coach Gabriela Flax\n\nTo learn practical ways to prevent or overcome burnout, please read this in-\ndepth interview with Gabriela Flax.\n\n### 4) 26.9% of entrepreneurs have a poor work-life balance\n\n> \u201cFor entrepreneurs, the blend of personal and professional life often\n> becomes so seamless it\u2019s hard to tell where one ends and the other begins.\u201d\n>\n> Burnout coach Gabriela Flax\n\nEntrepreneurs often have a hard time turning off. You may work long hours,\nthink about work even when you\u2019re \u201coff,\u201d and have trouble sleeping or resting.\nFinding a way to create a healthy balance is essential.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that there\u2019s a cost to everything. The cost of\n> working too much is not doing well personally in your life, health, and\n> relationships. The cost of not working all the time might mean your business\n> grows slower, you miss an opportunity, or you don\u2019t do \u2018everything\u2019 all at\n> once. But what good is having a successful business if your family suffers\n> for it?\u201d\n>\n> Audrey Schoen, LMFT\n\n### 5) More entrepreneurs said they were concerned about mental health than\nphysical health\n\nWhile mental health and physical health are both important, the need for\nmental health is often overlooked or not prioritized. We thought it was\ntelling to see that 58.6% of survey respondents said they were concerned about\ntheir mental health, compared to 54.6% who said they were concerned about\ntheir physical health.\n\nIn coping, we turn to self-care\u2014light workouts, relaxation, and reading.\n\n#### Self-Care Practices:\n\n  * Light workout: 64.3%\n  * Rest/relaxation: 56.8%\n  * Reading: 48%\n  * Intense workout: 42.7%\n  * Television: 38.8%\n  * Meditation: 38.3%\n  * Breathing exercise: 32.6%\n  * Prayer: 27.3%\n  * Other: 19.4%\n  * None of the above: 2.6%\n\n#### Set Clear Boundaries\n\n> \u201cFirst and foremost, I set clear boundaries between work and my personal\n> life, making sure to carve out time for things I enjoy and to relax. I\u2019ve\n> found that regular exercise really helps in keeping both my mind and body\n> feeling good. Talking with other entrepreneurs who understand what I\u2019m going\n> through has been a big help; it\u2019s like we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\n>\n> Ryan Draving, Founder of The Moving Company\n\n### 6) 45.8% of entrepreneurs struggle with high stress\n\nIt\u2019s a given that entrepreneurship and stress go hand in hand. Every\nentrepreneur will face high stress at some point, so managing stress is\nessential for long-term success.\n\n> \u201cEntrepreneurship is a marathon, not a sprint. So rest is actually\n> incredibly important. And rest doesn\u2019t have to be sleep, just something that\n> truly feels restorative. A mindfulness practice is a great tool, but it\n> could be knitting, or playing with your kids, or just something you do\n> because you enjoy it. When we love our work, and it becomes the ONLY thing\n> we do, we often lose the ability to recharge and use different parts of our\n> brains.\u201d\n>\n> Dr. Anne Welsh, Clinical Psychologist & Executive Coach\n\n### 7) 21.6% of entrepreneurs experience insomnia or other sleep disorders\n\nOf course, it\u2019s essential for everyone, entrepreneur or not, to get enough\nsleep. However, the long hours and high-pressure life of an entrepreneur can\ncontribute to insomnia or other sleep disorders.\n\n### 8) 26.9% of entrepreneurs struggle with loneliness and isolation\n\nWhile mental health issues like anxiety, high stress, and burnout are often\nassociated with entrepreneurship, loneliness and isolation are often\noverlooked. However, our survey indicated that 26.9% of entrepreneurs struggle\nwith loneliness and isolation.\n\nThis is especially significant for those who run online businesses and work\nremotely. However, even entrepreneurs and business owners who work in an\noffice may also feel isolated from employees or other team members.\n\n### 9) Only 18.5% of respondents said they were aware of mental health\nresources specifically tailored for entrepreneurs and business owners\n\nHere at Founder Reports, we\u2019re creating a hub of practical content and\nresources on various mental health issues created specifically for\nentrepreneurs. We already have free guides and resources to help with issues\nlike:\n\n  * Burnout\n  * Anxiety\n  * High-performance mindset\n  * Addiction\n  * Loneliness and isolation\n  * Financial worries\n  * Imposter syndrome\n\nThese resources are available from our Founder Life page, and more are on the\nway. Since most entrepreneurs are unfamiliar with mental health resources\ncreated specifically for them, we see a strong need for this content.\n\n## Bridging Disparities and Tailoring Support\n\nDigging deeper, disparities emerge. Women bear the brunt of financial worries\nand imposter syndrome, while men battle burnout and depression.\n\nAs age advances, anxiety tightens its grip. Tailored interventions addressing\ndemographic-specific needs are essential.\n\n### 10) Female entrepreneurs are more likely than males to struggle with\nfinancial worries\n\nOverall, 39.2% of survey respondents said they worry about money (only anxiety\nand high stress were more common issues, according to our survey). However,\nthe issue seems to be more common with female entrepreneurs than males. 44.1%\nof females reported that they worry about finances, compared to 37.1% of\nmales.\n\nMany people associate entrepreneurs and business owners with financial and\nmaterial wealth, but the reality is many entrepreneurs face financial\nuncertainty. The unpredictable and inconsistent income often leads to\nfinancial worries and concerns.\n\n### 11) Female entrepreneurs are more likely than males to struggle with\nimposter syndrome\n\nImposter syndrome is another issue that seems to impact women\ndisproportionately. 41.2% of female entrepreneurs said they struggle with\nimposter syndrome, compared to only 27.8% of men.\n\nIf you face this issue, check out these tips for overcoming imposter syndrome.\n\n### 12) Male entrepreneurs are more likely than females to face burnout\n\nBurnout was the fourth most common issue experienced by our survey respondents\n(behind anxiety, high stress, and financial worries). However, 36.1% of men\nsaid they struggle with burnout compared to 30.9% of women.\n\n### 13) Male entrepreneurs are more likely than females to have poor work-life\nbalance\n\nThis stat likely impacts the previous stat on burnout. 29.1% of male\nentrepreneurs feel they have a poor work-life balance, compared to 22.1% of\nfemale entrepreneurs. Of course, work-life balance and burnout are often\nlinked, so it\u2019s not surprising that more men experience burnout if they also\nstruggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n\n### 14) Male entrepreneurs are more likely than females to struggle with\ndepression\n\n22.2% of male entrepreneurs admitted to struggling with depression, compared\nto only 14.7% of female entrepreneurs.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, 10.3% of adult females\nstruggle with depression, compared to 6.2% of adult males. While our survey\nflip-flopped the comparison among genders, the more significant issue is that\ndepression appears to be far more common among entrepreneurs than the general\npopulation.\n\n### 15) Female entrepreneurs are more likely than males to have a support\nsystem in place\n\nA culture of empathy and understanding is vital in order to navigate struggles\nwithout fear of judgment.\n\nWe asked participants if they had a support system in place to communicate\nopenly with others about mental health struggles, and the responses were\ndrastically different among men and women. 70.6% of female entrepreneurs said\nthey do have a support system in place, compared to only 52.5% of males.\n\nThis gap shows the need for male entrepreneurs to connect with other\ncolleagues, friends, family members, and even professional coaches or\ntherapists who provide support when needed. This collection of entrepreneur\ncommunities may be helpful for finding places to connect with others.\n\n#### Be a Proactive Networker\n\n> \u201cRunning your own business or being an entrepreneur who works from home can\n> sometimes be a lonely experience. One way to overcome this loneliness is to\n> build and utilize your networks. Join B2B groups, business breakfasts, local\n> and online networking events; acquire the contact sheet from each event and\n> reach out to those on the list.\u201d\n>\n> Emily Maguire, Managing Director and Career Consultant at Reflections Career\n> Coaching\n\n### 16) Entrepreneurs 35 and over are more likely to struggle with anxiety\nthan those 34 and under\n\nAlthough anxiety was the most common mental health struggle among our\nrespondents, the results indicate that it\u2019s more significant for older\nentrepreneurs and less common among younger entrepreneurs. 54.5% of\nentrepreneurs 35 and over said they struggle with anxiety, compared to 47.2%\nof those 34 and under.\n\n### 17) Entrepreneurs 34 and under are more likely to struggle with loneliness\nand isolation than those 35 and over\n\nLoneliness and isolation were more common among younger respondents. 30.7% of\nentrepreneurs 34 and under claimed to struggle with loneliness and isolation,\ncompared to 21.2% of those 35 years and older.\n\nThis may be influenced by the fact that a higher percentage of those 35 and\nover have kids and families, and younger entrepreneurs are more likely to be\nsingle.\n\n## Charting the Path Forward\n\nIn conclusion, the journey of entrepreneurship is as much about navigating the\ninternal landscape of the mind as it is about external success. By\nacknowledging the realities of mental health struggles, fostering supportive\ncommunities, and providing accessible resources and interventions, we can\ncreate a more empathetic entrepreneurial ecosystem where mental health is\nprioritized and valued.\n\nTogether, let\u2019s break the silence, bridge divides, and pave the way for a\nhealthier, more resilient future for all entrepreneurs.\n\n> \u201cEntrepreneurs and startup founders can increase their productivity and\n> effectiveness as leaders to the extent they take care of their mental\n> health. Taking care of the mental health aspect is like driving a car with\n> lower emissions. It\u2019s more sustainable for the environment and a more\n> pleasant journey overall for the driver and the passengers alike.\u201d\n>\n> Executive Coach and Leadership Trainer Dr. Ling Lam\n\n## Full Survey Results\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll share the full survey results so you can see details that haven\u2019t\nbeen featured or included in the statistics above.\n\nTotal responses: 227 entrepreneurs and business owners from 46 different\ncountries.\n\nAge range:\n\n  * 18-24: 14.5%\n  * 25-34: 41.4%\n  * 35-44: 30%\n  * 45-54: 11%\n  * 55-64: 1.8%\n  * 65+: 0.9%\n  * Prefer not to answer: 0.4%\n\nGender:\n\n  * Male: 69.6%\n  * Female: 30%\n  * Prefer not to answer: 0.4%\n\nRace:\n\n  * White: 55.1%\n  * Asian: 29.5%\n  * Middle Eastern or North African: 3.5%\n  * Multiracial or Multiethnic: 3.1%\n  * Hispanic or Latino: 2.2%\n  * Black or African American: 1.8%\n  * Other race or ethnicity: 3.1%\n  * Prefer not to answer: 1.8%\n\nChallenges:\n\nRespondents could select all of the issues/challenges that they face.\n\n  * Anxiety: 50.2%\n  * High stress: 45.8%\n  * Financial worries: 39.2%\n  * Burnout: 34.4%\n  * Imposter syndrome: 31.7%\n  * Poor work-life balance: 26.9%\n  * Loneliness or isolation: 26.9%\n  * Insomnia or other sleep disorders: 21.6%\n  * Depression: 19.8%\n  * Relationship strain: 13.7%\n  * Hopelessness: 12.3%\n  * No direction or purpose: 11.9%\n  * None of the above: 12.3%\n\nDo you feel like you have a support system in place that allows you to\ncommunicate openly with others about mental health struggles?\n\n  * Yes: 58.1%\n  * No: 25.6%\n  * Unsure: 16.3%\n\nAre you concerned about any of the following?\n\nRespondents could select more than one.\n\n  * Physical health: 54.6%\n  * Mental health: 58.6%\n  * Spiritual health: 25.1%\n  * None of the above: 21.1%\n\nDo you exercise regularly?\n\n  * Yes: 50.7%\n  * Occasionally: 37%\n  * No: 12.3%\n\nWhat self-care practices do you use?\n\n  * Light workout: 64.3%\n  * Rest/relaxation: 56.8%\n  * Reading: 48%\n  * Intense workout: 42.7%\n  * Television: 38.8%\n  * Meditation: 38.3%\n  * Breathing exercise: 32.6%\n  * Prayer: 27.3%\n  * Other: 19.4%\n  * None of the above: 2.6%\n\nAre you aware of mental health resources specifically tailored for\nentrepreneurs and business owners?\n\n  * Yes: 18.5%\n  * No: 56.4%\n  * Somewhat: 25.1%\n\n### About the Author\n\n##### David Domzalski\n\nDavid Domzalski has covered the stories of entrepreneurs and professionals for\nover 13 years.
