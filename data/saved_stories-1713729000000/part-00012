Why does the legend persist?\n\nBy Jefferson Pooley and Michael J. Socolow\n\nOct 28, 201311:51 PM\n\nOrson Welles, photographed by Carl Van Vechten, March 1, 1937.\n\nPhoto by Carl Van Vechten/Library of Congress via Wikimedia Commons\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\nWednesday marks the 75^th anniversary of Orson Welles\u2019 electrifying War of the\nWorlds broadcast, in which the Mercury Theatre on the Air enacted a Martian\ninvasion of Earth. \u201cUpwards of a million people, [were] convinced, if only\nbriefly, that the United States was being laid waste by alien invaders,\u201d\nnarrator Oliver Platt informs us in the new PBS documentary commemorating the\nprogram. The panic inspired by Welles made War of the Worlds perhaps the most\nnotorious event in American broadcast history.\n\nThat\u2019s the story you already know\u2014it\u2019s the narrative widely reprinted in\nacademic textbooks and popular histories. With actors dramatizing the reaction\nof frightened audience members (based on contemporaneous letters), the new\ndocumentary, part of PBS\u2019s American Experience series, reinforces the notion\nthat na\u00efve Americans were terrorized by their radios back in 1938. So did this\nweekend\u2019s episode of NPR\u2019s Radiolab, which opened with the assertion that on\nOct. 30, 1938, \u201cThe United States experienced a kind of mass hysteria that\nwe\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem: The supposed panic was so tiny as to be practically\nimmeasurable on the night of the broadcast. Despite repeated assertions to the\ncontrary in the PBS and NPR programs, almost nobody was fooled by Welles\u2019\nbroadcast.\n\nHow did the story of panicked listeners begin? Blame America\u2019s newspapers.\nRadio had siphoned off advertising revenue from print during the Depression,\nbadly damaging the newspaper industry. So the papers seized the opportunity\npresented by Welles\u2019 program to discredit radio as a source of news. The\nnewspaper industry sensationalized the panic to prove to advertisers, and\nregulators, that radio management was irresponsible and not to be trusted. In\nan editorial titled \u201cTerror by Radio,\u201d the New York Times reproached \u201cradio\nofficials\u201d for approving the interweaving of \u201cblood-curdling fiction\u201d with\nnews flashes \u201coffered in exactly the manner that real news would have been\ngiven.\u201d Warned Editor and Publisher, the newspaper industry\u2019s trade journal,\n\u201cThe nation as a whole continues to face the danger of incomplete,\nmisunderstood news over a medium which has yet to prove ... that it is\ncompetent to perform the news job.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contrast between how newspaper journalists experienced the supposed panic,\nand what they reported, could be stark. In 1954, Ben Gross, the New York Daily\nNews\u2019 radio editor, published a memoir in which he recalled the streets of\nManhattan being deserted as his taxi sped to CBS headquarters just as War of\nthe Worlds was ending. Yet that observation failed to stop the Daily News from\nsplashing the panic story across this legendary cover a few hours later.\n\nNew York Daily News front page from Oct. 31, 1938.\n\nPhoto by New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom these initial newspaper items on Oct. 31, 1938, the apocryphal apocalypse\nonly grew in the retelling. A curious (but predictable) phenomenon occurred:\nAs the show receded in time and became more infamous, more and more people\nclaimed to have heard it. As weeks, months, and years passed, the audience\u2019s\nsize swelled to such an extent that you might actually believe most of America\nwas tuned to CBS that night. But that was hardly the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFar fewer people heard the broadcast\u2014and fewer still panicked\u2014than most people\nbelieve today. How do we know? The night the program aired, the C.E. Hooper\nratings service telephoned 5,000 households for its national ratings survey.\n\u201cTo what program are you listening?\u201d the service asked respondents. Only 2\npercent answered a radio \u201cplay\u201d or \u201cthe Orson Welles program,\u201d or something\nsimilar indicating CBS. None said a \u201cnews broadcast,\u201d according to a summary\npublished in Broadcasting. In other words, 98 percent of those surveyed were\nlistening to something else, or nothing at all, on Oct. 30, 1938. This\nminiscule rating is not surprising. Welles\u2019 program was scheduled against one\nof the most popular national programs at the time\u2014ventriloquist Edgar Bergen\u2019s\nChase and Sanborn Hour, a comedy-variety show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new PBS documentary allows that, \u201cof the tens of millions of Americans\nlistening to their radios that Sunday evening, few were tuned to the War of\nthe Worlds\u201d when it began, due to Bergen\u2019s popularity. But the documentary\u2019s\nscript goes on to claim that \u201cmillions of listeners began twirling the dial\u201d\nwhen the opening comedy routine on the Chase and Sanborn Hour gave way to a\nmusical interlude. \u201cJust at that moment thousands, hundreds, we don\u2019t how many\nlisteners, started to dial-surf, where they landed on the Mercury Theatre on\nthe Air,\u201d explained Radiolab this weekend. No scholar, however, has ever\nisolated or extrapolated an actual number of dial twirlers. The data collected\nwas simply not specific enough for us to know how many listeners might have\nswitched over to Welles\u2014just as we can\u2019t estimate how many people turned their\nradios off, or switched from Mercury Theatre on the Air over to NBC\u2019s Chase\nand Sanborn Hour either. (Radiolab played the Chase and Sanborn Hour\u2019s musical\ninterlude for its audience, as if the song itself constituted evidence that\npeople of course switched to Welles\u2019 broadcast.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth American Experience and Radiolab also omit the salient fact that several\nimportant CBS affiliates (including Boston\u2019s WEEI) pre-empted Welles\u2019\nbroadcast in favor of local commercial programming, further shrinking its\naudience. CBS commissioned a nationwide survey the day after the broadcast,\nand network executives were relieved to discover just how few people actually\ntuned in. \u201cIn the first place, most people didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d CBS\u2019s Frank\nStanton recalled later. \u201cBut those who did hear it, looked at it is as a prank\nand accepted it that way.\u201d\n\nThe legend of the panic, however, grew exponentially over the following years.\nIn 1940, an esteemed academic solidified the myth in the public mind. Relying\nheavily on a skewed report compiled six weeks after the broadcast by the\nAmerican Institute of Public Opinion, The Invasion From Mars, by Princeton\u2019s\nHadley Cantril, estimated that about 1 million people were \u201cfrightened\u201d by War\nof the Worlds. But the AIPO survey, as Cantril himself admitted, offered an\naudience rating \u201cover 100 per cent higher than any other known measure of this\naudience.\u201d Cantril defended his reliance on AIPO data by noting that it\nsurveyed homes without telephones and small communities often overlooked by\nradio ratings agencies. But this cherry-picked data set was clearly tainted by\nthe sensationalistic newspaper publicity following the broadcast (a\npossibility Cantril also admitted). Worse, Cantril committed an obvious\ncategorical error by conflating being \u201cfrightened,\u201d \u201cdisturbed,\u201d or \u201cexcited\u201d\nby the program with being \u201cpanicked.\u201d In the late 1930s, radio audiences were\nregularly \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201cfrightened\u201d by suspenseful dramas. But what\nsupposedly set Welles\u2019 show apart was the \u201cpanic,\u201d and even terror, it\ninstilled in its audience. Was the small audience that listened to War of the\nWorlds excited by what they heard? Certainly. But that doesn\u2019t mean they ran\ninto the streets fearing for the fate of humanity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet such behavior has become part of the War of the Worlds myth, as\nhighlighted by the PBS program. \u201cAs Welles ran out the broadcast, the deluge\nof calls continued to light up switchboards across the country,\u201d narrator\nOliver Platt explains. \u201cIn some quarters there were even vague reports of\nsuicides and panic-related deaths.\u201d But just as the size of Welles\u2019 audience\nhas been exaggerated, so have reports of audience hysteria. Wire service\nreports did relay sensational stories of (unnamed) panicked listeners saved\nonly by the timely intervention of friends or neighbors, but not one newspaper\nreported a verified suicide connected to the broadcast. Researchers in\nPrinceton\u2019s Office of Radio Research, working under the direction of Cantril,\nsought to verify a rumor that several people were treated for shock at St.\nMichael\u2019s Hospital in Newark, N.J. The rumor was checked and found to be\ninaccurate. When the same researchers surveyed six New York City hospitals six\nweeks after the broadcast, \u201cnone of them had any record of any cases brought\nin specifically on account of the broadcast.\u201d No specific death has ever been\nconclusively attributed to the drama. The Washington Post reported that one\nBaltimore listener died of a heart attack during the show, but unfortunately\nno one followed up to confirm the story or provide corroborative details. One\nparticularly frightened listener did sue CBS for $50,000, claiming the network\ncaused her \u201cnervous shock.\u201d Her lawsuit was quickly dismissed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBy the next morning ... the panic broadcast was front-page news from coast to\ncoast, with reports of traffic accidents, near riots, hordes of panicked\npeople in the streets, all because of a radio play,\u201d the PBS documentary\nrecounts. But did armed citizens and National Guardsmen really assemble\nthroughout America? Did mobs rove the streets? Not really. While newspapers\nmade Oct. 30, 1938, a memorable night in the history of the United States, in\nreality it was a normal fall Sunday evening throughout North America. Four\ndays after its initial, sensational report, the Washington Post published a\nletter from one reader who walked down F Street during the broadcast. He\nnoticed \u201cnothing approximating mass hysteria.\u201d \u201cIn many stores radios were\ngoing, yet I observed nothing whatsoever of the absurd supposed \u2018terror of the\npopulace.\u2019 There was none,\u201d the reader reported. The Chicago Tribune made no\nmention of frightened mobs taking to the Windy City\u2019s streets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf War of the Worlds had in fact caused the widespread terror we\u2019ve been told\nit did, you\u2019d expect CBS and Welles to have been reprimanded for their\nactions. But that wasn\u2019t the case. It\u2019s true that Federal Communications\nCommission chairman Frank McNinch quickly obtained informal agreement from the\nradio networks that fictional news \u201cflashes\u201d would not be used again, but no\nofficial rulings or regulations were promulgated. Nor were CBS or Welles\nsanctioned in any manner. (In fact, the FCC prohibited complaints about the\nprogram from being used in license renewal hearings.) For the FCC and the\nnetworks, the sensationalized newspaper reports were at worst a nuisance.\nJanet Jackson\u2019s 2004 \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d remains far more significant in\nthe history of broadcast regulation than Orson Welles\u2019 trickery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2012, Cathleen O\u2019Connell, the producer and director of the PBS documentary,\ntelephoned one of the authors of this piece (Michael Socolow) to discuss the\nrecent scholarship questioning the scale of the panic. The documentary does\nacknowledge this new work but relegates it to one line, late in the program:\n\u201cUltimately,\u201d Oliver Platt intones, \u201cthe very extent of the panic would come\nto be seen as having been exaggerated by the press.\u201d\n\nBut that one line fails to balance the accounts of hysteria peppered\nthroughout the script. Director and Welles collaborator Peter Bogdanovich\ntells us that Welles \u201cscared half the country.\u201d The documentary further claims\nthat \u201cnewspaper coverage about the broadcast ... continued unabated for two\nfull weeks and amounted to some 12,500 articles in total.\u201d Yet in his\ncomprehensive analysis of contemporaneous reporting on the panic, American\nUniversity professor W. Joseph Campbell found that almost all newspapers\nswiftly dropped the story. \u201cCoverage of the broadcast faded quickly from the\nfront pages, in most cases after just a day or two,\u201d Campbell writes, arguing\nthat had the hysteria truly been widespread, \u201cnewspapers for days and even\nweeks afterward could have been expected to have published detailed reports\nabout the dimensions and repercussions of such an extraordinary event.\u201d Much\nlike the broadcast itself, newspaper coverage was dramatic and sensational\u2014but\nephemeral. The PBS documentary, like so many accounts of War of the Worlds\nbefore it, can\u2019t resist the allure of the myth.\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is this myth so alluring\u2014why does it persist? The answer is complicated,\nmost likely reflecting everything from the structure of our commercial\nbroadcasting system and of our federal regulation, as well as our culture\u2019s\nskepticism about the mass audience and the fear that always accompanies the\nexcitement of new media. Even today, broadcast networks must convince\nadvertisers that they retain commanding powers over their audiences. As such,\nCBS has regularly celebrated the War of the Worlds broadcast and its supposed\neffect on the public. In 1957, Studio One, a CBS anthology series, dramatized\nthe panic as \u201cThe Night America Trembled,\u201d and when the network celebrated its\n75^th anniversary in 2003, War of the Worlds was a noted highlight. On the\nother side of the coin, federal regulators must still persuade politicians\nthat there exists an important protective role for the guardians of the\nairwaves. For both broadcasters and regulators, War of the Worlds provides\nexcellent evidence to justify their claims about media power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome portion of the blame must also go to Hadley Cantril. His scholarly book\nvalidated the popular memory of the event. He gave academic credence to the\npanic and attached real numbers to it. He remains the only source with\nacademic legitimacy who claims there was a sizable panic. Without this\nvalidation, the myth likely would not be in social psychology and mass\ncommunication textbooks, as it still is today\u2014pretty much every high schooler\nand liberal arts undergraduate runs across it at some point. (Both the\nAmerican Experience and Radiolab segments rely on his work.) Though you may\nhave never heard of Cantril, the War of the Worlds myth is very much his\nlegacy.\n\nBut the myth also persists because it so perfectly captures our unease with\nthe media\u2019s power over our lives. \u201cThe \u2018panic broadcast\u2019 may be as much a\nfunction of fantasy as fact,\u201d writes Northwestern\u2019s Jeffrey Sconce in Haunted\nMedia, suggesting that the panic myth is a function of simple displacement:\nIt\u2019s not the Martians invading Earth that we fear, he argues; it\u2019s ABC, CBS,\nand NBC invading and colonizing our consciousness that truly frightens us. To\nSconce, the panic plays a \u201csymbolic function\u201d for American culture\u2014we retell\nthe story because we need a cautionary tale about the power of media. And that\nneed has hardly abated: Just as radio was the new medium of the 1930s, opening\nup exciting new channels of communication, today the Internet provides us with\nboth the promise of a dynamic communicative future and dystopian fears of a\nnew form of mind control; lost privacy; and attacks from scary, mysterious\nforces. This is the fear that animates our fantasy of panicked hordes\u2014both\nthen and now.\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\n  * History\n  * Media\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Work With Us\n  * Contact\n  * Pitch Guidelines\n  * Send Us Tips\n  * Corrections\n  * Commenting\n  * Reprints\n\n#### Subscriptions\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Sign In\n  * Account\n  * Subscription FAQs\n  * Podcast FAQs\n  * Newsletters\n  * Customer Support\n\n#### Advertising\n\n  * AdChoices\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\n#### Follow Us\n\nFacebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Feed\n\n  * User Agreement\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9 2024 The Slate Group LLC.
