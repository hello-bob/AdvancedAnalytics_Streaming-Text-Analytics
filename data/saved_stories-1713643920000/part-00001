It was to launch the memoir of a Mexican-American\nformer Border Patrol agent who had become disillusioned and quit. To the\nsurprise of most of those present, a group of aggressive protesters also\nshowed up, dead set on preventing it from happening. Their objection was to\nthe author\u2019s prior employment in a law enforcement agency that had become\ncentral to Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that the book was critical of the Border Patrol; as the\nprotesters saw it, to treat that agency\u2019s operations with literary nuance and\nmoral complexity was as obscene as doing so with the Gestapo. They tried to\nshame attendees into leaving, then repeatedly shouted down the author,\nderailing the discussion until the store manager called the police. After\nloudly denouncing her, they left.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether any of these hecklers called themselves \u201cAntifa\u201d, but\ntheir disruption of a minor literary event was just one small indication of\nthe extent to which the movement\u2019s values and tactics went mainstream during\nthe Trump era. For decades, Antifa activists had focused their attention on\nshutting down the activities of fringe far-Right groups with violence if\nnecessary. But with Trump in the White House, many concluded the domain of the\nstruggle needed to be extended. In their panicked state post-2016, many\nliberals and mainstream progressives who might have once eschewed Antifa\u2019s\nrejection of free speech and advocacy of violence against ideological\nopponents came to regard them as a last line of defence against a surging\nRight.\n\nIn reaction, Antifa became a central element of conservative demonology in the\nTrump era, especially during the riots set off by George Floyd\u2019s killing in\n2020, in which masked \u201cblack bloc\u201d agitators were often seen setting fires and\ncausing mayhem. As Minneapolis burned, Trump claimed on Twitter that his\nadministration would designate Antifa a terrorist organisation. This never\nhappened \u2014 and since the United States lacks a domestic terrorism law, it is\nunlikely it will in the event of a second Trump term.\n\nAt the local level, however, conservatives are now testing out other ways of\ncracking down on the movement. This month, the District Attorney of San Diego,\nCalifornia, brought conspiracy charges against two Antifa activists who were\ninvolved in street brawls in early 2021, in effect trying to prosecute them\nusing a legal toolkit created to fight organised crime.\n\nBoth the prosecution and the defence in the Antifa trial lay claim to free\nspeech. In her opening statement, the Deputy District Attorney alleged that\nthe defendants conspired \u201cto shut down the speech and the assembly of a\npatriot group\u201d (they were protesting a pro-Trump rally of the Proud Boys and\nother far-Right groups). In response, as well as arguing the prosecution is\npolitically motivated \u2014 plausibly, given that the government opted not to\nprosecute any of the Right-wingers involved in the street fights in question \u2014\ndefence attorneys contend that the conspiracy charge threatens free political\nexpression, because it will have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on anyone protesting\nRight-wing gatherings.\n\nThe irony of the defence attorneys\u2019 argument is that Antifa advocates are\noften explicit about doing what prosecutors allege \u2014 conspiring, or at least\ncoordinating, to prevent those it defines as \u201cfascist\u201d from speaking and\nassembling. They are also open about the fact that they reject the liberal\nconception of free speech. In Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, the historian\nand activist Mark Bray writes: \u201cAt the heart of the anti-fascist outlook is a\nrejection of the classical liberal phrase incorrectly ascribed to Voltaire\nthat \u2018I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right\nto say it\u2019.\u201d Bray, whose book is at once a history of Antifa, an apologia for\nits approach, and a how-to guide for aspiring militants, writes that the\nmovement is \u201ccommitted... to fighting to the death the ability of organized\nNazis to say anything\u201d. (\u201cTo the death\u201d here is literal: Bray approvingly\ncites historical instances of murders committed by anti-fascists.)\n\n\u201cAntifa are open about the fact that they reject the liberal conception of\nfree speech.\u201d\n\nLike many Antifa sympathisers, Bray directs much of his ire at liberal free-\nspeech advocates, whom he believes are na\u00efve devotees of the \u201cmarketplace of\nideas\u201d. The reality, though, is that after Trump\u2019s election, many liberals and\nliberal institutions embraced Bray\u2019s position. Indeed, the popularity of his\nbook \u2014 which garnered many positive reviews in the mainstream press and scored\nBray multiple NPR interviews \u2014 was an indication of this shift. The most\ndramatic about-face occurred at the ACLU, long notorious for defending the\nright of a Nazi group to hold a rally in Skokie, Illinois, in 1977. The\norganisation took the same consistent free-speech stance prior to the 2017\nCharlottesville \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally, but after the deadly events of that\nday, it began to waver, with many of its employees publicly disavowing its\nprior position.\n\nIn another sign of the patina of respectability Antifa acquired in the Trump\nera, in early 2018 Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison \u2014 then the deputy chair\nof the Democratic National Committee \u2014 promoted Bray\u2019s book on Twitter, saying\nit would \u201cstrike fear in the heart of [Donald Trump]\u201d. This was quite a\nreputational upgrade for a movement that, as Bray\u2019s historical account\ndetails, existed for many decades mainly as a minor skinhead subculture\ndevoted mainly to brawling with equally marginal groups of neo-Nazi skinheads.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### The Constitution won't save America\n\nBy N.S. Lyons\n\nFor much of its existence, however, Antifa had a more ambivalent relationship\nwith the liberal mainstream than its frequent denunciations of liberal\nproceduralism would imply. The movement first emerged alongside and in\nresponse to the rise of fascism in interwar Europe; the first anti-fascist\nmilitants were communists, socialists and anarchists who took to the streets\nto confront fascist paramilitary groups such as the SA in Germany and the\nBlackshirts in Italy. At this time, their violent struggle was part of a\nbroader revolutionary agenda. Defeating fascists, viewed as the shock troops\nof capital, was one piece of the larger radical social transformation they\nsought, often inspired by the recent Bolshevik triumph in Russia (the\nfascists, for their part, saw their violent activities as justified by the\nthreat of Bolshevism). Yet in nearly every country, they failed not only to\nbring about a communist revolution but to block the rise of the far-Right.\n\nIt was only in the post-war era, with the West settled under liberal-\ndemocratic rule, that Antifa re-emerged in something like its current form.\nWith the dream of universal communist revolution deferred, the movement\nfocused largely on beating back the scattered far-Right groups that persisted.\nWhile still deploying the rhetoric of the revolutionary Left, these militants\nwere for the most part resigned to policing the outer fringes of acceptable\ndiscourse, following terms set by the liberal mainstream they despised. To the\nextent their use of political violence was tolerated, it was in large part\nbecause their far-Right targets had already been pushed to the margins of\nsociety by other means, or because they unfolded in subcultural spaces of\nlittle broad political significance.\n\nIn making the case for the efficacy of Antifa tactics, Bray and other\napologists often point to concrete successes at preventing some particular\nneo-Nazi group from gathering or speaker from speaking. But it was the\nsubtler, more comprehensive methods of enforcing ideological consensus\nemployed by the liberal mainstream that rendered these fringe groups\nvulnerable to the antics of a handful of activists in the first place.\nConversely, Antifa has had less success lately at shutting down Right-populist\nleaders and parties it dubs fascist, from Trump to Marine Le Pen and Giorgia\nMeloni \u2014 for the simple reason that it is unable to muster sufficient numbers\nto physically confront their mass base of support. Even Bray concedes the\nmovement\u2019s tactics are inadequate to take on this new enemy.\n\nHence, Antifa faces the problem that its approach is more likely to rack up\nsuccesses when the stakes are lowest; when those it dubs \u201cfascist\u201d manage to\ncommand a broad base of support, it seems unable to scale up its approach. An\napproach calibrated to shutting down a bar show by a neo-Nazi hardcore band is\nunlikely to have much effect on a Trump rally. The liberal establishment, it\nwould seem, began to embrace Antifa just as its tactics were becoming\nirrelevant.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### Has Beyonc\u00e9 killed Jolene?\n\nBy Kat Rosenfield\n\nAnd yet, the possibility of effective collaboration between the centre-left\nand Antifa activists was on view this week, in the briefly successful attempt\nto shut down the National Conservatism conference in Brussels. Belgian anti-\nfascists had repeatedly demanded the conference be prevented from happening,\nand the local mayor used the pretext of potential violence from counter-\nprotesters to justify asking the police to break up the gathering on public\nsafety grounds. Ultimately, a court forced the city government to allow the\nconference to go forward, but the affair revealed something novel: that\nAntifa\u2019s willingness to use violence can furnish sympathetic authorities with\na useful rationale for limiting the freedom of speech and assembly of their\nenemies.\n\nIf Antifa has contributed anything to public discourse other than shrill\nslogans, it is having forced the consideration of what the limits of tolerance\nand freedom are in a society that claims to revere these values. But this\nquestion also applies to them too, as the San Diego prosecution\u2019s case makes\nclear. Can a liberal society tolerate the activities of a group that openly\nseeks to deny the speech and assembly rights of whomever its members deem\n\u201cfascist\u201d? (In the final chapter of his book, Bray implies all Trump voters\nare \u201ceveryday fascists\u201d, but doesn\u2019t clarify whether he and his comrades\ntherefore consider half the US electorate legitimate targets for violence.)\n\nLately, Antifa has lost much of the prominence it enjoyed in the Trump era but\nthe questions raised by its activities persist. Amid the Gaza war, pro-\nPalestinian protesters have used Antifa-style tactics to prevent pro-Israel\nspeakers and groups from holding events, but have also fallen victim to\ntactics long used by Antifa, such as doxxing. If the San Diego prosecution of\nAntifa succeeds, we can expect further crackdowns on Left-wing protest by\nconservative DAs along similar lines \u2014 but this, in turn, may only confirm\nfascism is imminent, prompting more aggressive action on the Left. The\nquestion, it seems, is less whether we are lurching into a new age of\nilliberalism than which side will go further, sooner.\n\nGeoff Shullenberger is managing editor of Compact.\n\ng_shullenberger\n\n## Join the discussion\n\n### Join like minded readers that support our journalism by becoming a paid\nsubscriber\n\n### To join the discussion in the comments, become a paid subscriber.\n\n#### Join like minded readers that support our journalism, read unlimited\narticles and enjoy other subscriber-only benefits.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\n103 Comments\n\nMost Voted\n\nNewest Oldest\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\nArthur King\n\n1 day ago\n\nLike BLM, Antifa function as Brownshirts for the Democrats.

This article comes close to doing this. The author refers to the\ncollaboration between the Mayor in Brussels shutting down the Conservatism\nconference and the Antifa types threatening it as \u201csomething novel\u201d. It\u2019s not\nnovel. It was the macro tactic that helped delegitimize Trump prior to the\n2020 election. It is what lies behind the over the top prosecution of the 6th\nJanuary rioters and demonstrators. The author conflates \u201cprotest\u201d with\nviolence. Also he describes Antifa as a \u2018movement\u2019. Your right to protest is a\n1st Amendment right. It is not a right to disrupt other people\u2019s right to\nspeak or to go about their business, or to intimidate them. Suggesting that\nhow we handle Antifa is some kind of nuanced problem is naive. There is no\nnuanced debate to be had here. There is no \u201cforced...consideration of what the\nlimits of tolerance and freedom are in a society that claims to revere these\nvalues.\u201d Violent thugs are violent thugs. Period. If one steps back to look at\na larger scale, one can see a good case to be made that the US 2020 election\nwas stolen on the grounds that Antifa / BLM violent protests served as the\nmilitary / brown-shirt wing of the left. Street disorder, violence, shutting\ndown the speech of others, and even physical intimidation were explicitely\nsupported and endorsed by Democratic politicians. The consequence was a\nrolling Kristallnacht through much of the Trump presidency and especially\nthrough 2020, that had similar purposes to the Brown Shirt / SA original. It\nwas a strategy not just a tactic to use chaos and violence to delegitimize\nopposition. The strategic goal was that people just wanted peace and so would\nvote for Biden. The Mayor of Etterbeek in Brussels, just like US college\nadministrators, showed this logic in microcosm on April 16th last. The\nradical-left threatens violence and so, because there might be violence, we\nthe administrators who politically agree with the radical left will do what\nthe radical left says because, well, nobody wants violence. The radical left\nare our military wing. This shows the corruption of the left and why it has to\nbe removed from every institution it controls. It\u2019s also the basis of the\nNorthern Ireland Good Friday Agreement so, as a principle, it\u2019s already baked\ninto mainstream social democratic opinion. Violence pays. Violence might be\nbad but it is the voice of the people and you ignore it at your peril. The\nauthor\u2019s perspective implicitly permits this kind of relativizing. He argues\nthat the DA in San Diego charging those guilty of street violence with\nconspiracy is a \u201cthreat\u201d to their freedom of speech. This is a sleight of\nhand. Once you understand that street violence is not \u201cprotest\u201d and therefore\ncannot have anything to do with freedom of speech. I suspect the author\ndoesn\u2019t know this. I also suspect that he doesn\u2019t know that he doesn\u2019t know\nthis. This is where we are in 2024. Where journalism that passes for cogent\nanalysis of the left allows, in its implicit framing of the discussion, the\none element of the left\u2019s argument that legitimizes its violent nature and is\nessential for its success.\n\n43\n\n-1\n\nReply\n\nopop anax\n\n1 day ago\n\nReply to Paul MacDonnell\n\nThis is a very good post.

But of course that doesn\u2019t fit the narrative of how Muslims are\nalways the victims does it?\n\n2\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nAlex Lekas\n\n21 hours ago\n\nReply to McLovin\n\nIronically, when you look at current events, with whom does the American left\nside? First, it was Hamas and now, it\u2019s the Islamic Republic. And I say this\nas someone who thinks Israel may be creating its own problems with its current\noffensive and refusal to lets its back-and-forth with the mullahs die\npeacefully.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nAJ Mac\n\n22 hours ago\n\nReply to Katharina Bloem\n\nBe aware that there is a sizable minority of people on a comment board like\nthis who are neither nauseated by or opposed to much of the historical fascist\nagenda. Often they lurk silently, contributing their up and downvotes.\nSometimes they are provoked into a self-reveal, as with the commenter who\nstarted his post \u201cwhite supremacist here\u201d\u2013and received dozens of upvotes\n(before they showed separate green and red thumbs for up and down).\n\n0\n\n-1\n\nReply\n\nDavid L\n\n20 hours ago\n\nReply to Katharina Bloem\n\nYou are Titania McGrath, and I claim my five pounds\n\n1\n\n0\n\nReply\n\n##### Explore\n\n  * Politics\n  * Culture\n  * Science\n  * Faith\n  * War\n  * Society\n\n##### Quick Links\n\n  * Events Calendar\n  * UnHerd Club\n  * Our Mission\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * Contact Us\n\n##### Contribute to UnHerd\n\nWe welcome applications to contribute to UnHerd \u2013 please fill out the form\nbelow including examples of your previously published work.
