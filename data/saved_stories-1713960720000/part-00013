They requested an increase in the value, and number, of federal\ngovernment scholarships, and got more than they asked for. Stipends for\nmaster\u2019s students will rise from Can$17,500 (US$12,700) to $27,000 per year,\nPhDs stipends that ranged from $20,000 to $35,000 will be set to a uniform\nannual $40,000 and most postdoctoral-fellowship salaries will increase from\n$45,000 to $70,000 per annum. The number of scholarships and fellowships\nprovided will also rise over time, building to around 1,720 more per year\nafter five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very thrilled with this significant new investment, the largest\ninvestment in graduate students and postdocs in over 21 years,\u201d says Kaitlin\nKharas, a PhD student at the University of Toronto, Canada, and executive\ndirector of Support Our Science. \u201cIt will directly support the next generation\nof researchers.\u201d\n\nAlthough only a small proportion of students and postdoctoral fellows receive\nthese federal scholarships, other funders tend to use them as a guide for\ntheir own stipends.\n\nMany postgraduates said that low pay was forcing them to consider leaving\nCanada to pursue their scientific career, says Kharas, so this funding should\nhelp to retain talent in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is going to move us from a searing brain drain to a brain gain, and\nposition us to compete on the world stage,\u201d says Chad Gaffield, chief\nexecutive of the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities, based in\nOntario, which supported the campaign.\n\n## \u2018Determined to thrive\u2019\n\nThe budget also includes marked boosts for basic research. There is an extra\n$1.8 billion over five years in core funding for the three federal grant-\nawarding research councils, as well as $400 million for upgrades to the TRIUMF\nparticle accelerator in Vancouver, and more cash for several other large\nfacilities and institutes across the country. There will also be more than $2\nbillion for the artificial-intelligence sector in Canada.\n\n\u201c[This budget] really emphasizes that Canada is determined to thrive in the\ntwenty-first century based on science and research,\u201d says Gaffield.\n\nCanada announces new innovation agency \u2014 and it\u2019s not modelled on DARPA\n\nOthers have pointed out that the vast majority of the money in the budget for\nthe research councils is backloaded, with just $228 million coming in the next\ntwo years. This means that the gains will be slow, and could be vulnerable to\nchanges in the political climate, says Alex Usher, president of Higher\nEducation Strategy Associates, a consultancy in Toronto. \u201cDo not count on this\nmoney being there after an election,\u201d he posted on X (formerly Twitter).\nCanada\u2019s next federal election is due in October 2025, and the opposition\nConservative Party is campaigning on reigning in spending.\n\nThe budget also makes some changes to how science funding is organized.\nInstead of ten different programmes for scholarships and fellowships, with\ndiffering levels of support, there will now be a single programme with just\nthree levels \u2014 master\u2019s degrees, PhDs and postdoctoral fellowships. Kharas\nsays that this should simplify the system.\n\nThe government will also create a new \u201ccapstone\u201d research-funding organization\nto better coordinate the work of the three granting councils and \u201chelp to\nadvance internationally collaborative, multi-disciplinary and mission-driven\nresearch\u201d, the budget says. It will also create an advisory Council on Science\nand Innovation, comprised of leaders from academia, industry and the non-\nprofit sector, which will develop a national science-and-innovation strategy\nto guide priority setting and increase the impact of federal investments.\n\u201cThis should help move us towards a more efficient, well-coordinated and\nnimble way of supporting research in Canada,\u201d says Gaffield. \u201cI look forward\nto working with the government to optimize it.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01124-2\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Canadian PhD students and postgrads plan mass walkout over low pay\n\n  * Canada announces new innovation agency \u2014 and it\u2019s not modelled on DARPA\n\n  * Biden seeks to boost science funding \u2014 but his budget faces an ominous future\n\n  * Brazil budget cuts could leave science labs without power and water\n\n  * South Korean scientists\u2019 outcry over planned R&D budget cuts\n\n  * Japanese researchers say science-budget hike isn't enough\n\n  * Mexican science suffers under debilitating budget cuts\n\n  * How Canada stacks up in science against its closest competitors\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Scientific community\n  * Politics\n  * Policy\n  * Funding\n\n## Latest on:\n\nChemistry lab destroyed by Taiwan earthquake has physical and mental impacts\n\nCorrespondence 23 APR 24\n\nBreaking ice, and helicopter drops: winning photos of working scientists\n\nCareer Feature 23 APR 24\n\nIndia\u2019s 50-year-old Chipko movement is a model for environmental activism\n\nCorrespondence 23 APR 24\n\nHow India can become a science powerhouse\n\nEditorial 16 APR 24\n\nUS COVID-origins hearing puts scientific journals in the hot seat\n\nNews 16 APR 24\n\nWhat the India election means for science\n\nNews 10 APR 24\n\nIndia\u2019s 50-year-old Chipko movement is a model for environmental activism\n\nCorrespondence 23 APR 24\n\nThe Middle East\u2019s largest hypersaline lake risks turning into an environmental\ndisaster zone\n\nCorrespondence 23 APR 24\n\nMore work is needed to take on the rural wastewater challenge\n\nCorrespondence 23 APR 24\n\nChemistry lab destroyed by Taiwan earthquake has physical and mental impacts\n\nCorrespondence 23 APR 24\n\nBreaking ice, and helicopter drops: winning photos of working scientists\n\nCareer Feature 23 APR 24\n\nIndia\u2019s 50-year-old Chipko movement is a model for environmental activism\n\nCorrespondence 23 APR 24\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * #### Postdoctoral Associate\n\nHouston, Texas (US)\n\nBaylor College of Medicine (BCM)\n\n  * #### Postdoctoral Research Fellow\n\nDescription Applications are invited for a postdoctoral fellow position at the\nLunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health, to participate...\n\nToronto (City), Ontario (CA)\n\nSinai Health\n\n  * #### Postdoctoral Research Associate - Surgery\n\nMemphis, Tennessee\n\nSt. Jude Children's Research Hospital (St. Jude)\n\n  * #### Open Rank Faculty Position in Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics\n\nThe Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Genetics (www.virginia.edu/bmg) and\nthe University of Virginia Cancer Center\n\nCharlottesville, Virginia\n\nBiochemistry & Molecular Genetics\n\n  * #### Postdoctoral Position - Synthetic Cell/Living Cell Spheroids for Interactive Biomaterials\n\nCo-assembly of artificial cells and living cells to make co-spheroid\nstructures and study their interactive behavior for biomaterials applications.\n\nMainz, Rheinland-Pfalz (DE)\n\nUniversity of Mainz\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Canadian PhD students and postgrads plan mass walkout over low pay\n\n  * Canada announces new innovation agency \u2014 and it\u2019s not modelled on DARPA\n\n  * Biden seeks to boost science funding \u2014 but his budget faces an ominous future\n\n  * Brazil budget cuts could leave science labs without power and water\n\n  * South Korean scientists\u2019 outcry over planned R&D budget cuts\n\n  * Japanese researchers say science-budget hike isn't enough\n\n  * Mexican science suffers under debilitating budget cuts\n\n  * How Canada stacks up in science against its closest competitors\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Scientific community\n  * Politics\n  * Policy\n  * Funding\n\n## Sign up to Nature Briefing\n\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your\ninbox every weekday.\n\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter \u2014 what matters in science, free to\nyour inbox daily.\n\nGet the most important science stories of the day, free in your inbox.
