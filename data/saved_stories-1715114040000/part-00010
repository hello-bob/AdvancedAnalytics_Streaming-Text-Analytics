Sometimes while trying to come up with an explanation, I\nrealize I don\u2019t actually understand the topic as well as I thought! One of\nthese topics is heuristics for the A* algorithm.While trying to understand the\ntopic better, I came up with this example:\n\nDiagrams showing a nearby and faraway goal, with the same distance heuristic\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the first attempt at an explanation. But I was still unhappy with\nit. I decided to remake the diagrams again. The problem I\u2019m trying to\ndemonstrate isn\u2019t specific to grids, so I decided to use a non-grid example.\nConveniently, I had a non-grid example at the top of the A* page, so I adapted\nit for this page. I wanted to display numbers on the map but they didn\u2019t fit\nin some of the smaller cells so I removed all the small cells.\n\nNew diagram\n\nI rewrote not only the diagrams but also the introductory text. But I\u2019m still\nnot happy with it! I think the grid has some advantages for visualization.\nI\u2019ll try rewriting this section again at some point.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot more to work on. The introductory section is just to set\nup the motivation. Section 2 is about basic insight for improving the\nheuristic. Section 3 is about the solution. Section 4 is the code. Then there\nare several more sections, including demos with maps from real games.\n\nI\u2019ve been working on the differential heuristics page since 2015 and I\u2019m still\nnot happy with it! Maybe I need to rethink my strategy, either by reducing the\nscope of the page or by planning to rewrite the page after I publish it. I\nlove the idea \u2014 it\u2019s very little code (<20 lines?), can produce a big speedup,\nand not limited to grid maps like some other A* optimizations. My general\nheuristics page is in even worse shape. The demos on that page are completely\nbroken. I feel bad that after all this time I still haven\u2019t finished these\npages. I\u2019ll keep working on them (slowly).\n\nEmail me redblobgames@gmail.com, or tweet @redblobgames, or comment:\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Red Blob Games RSS Feed\n\nCreated 05 May 2024; Last modified: 06 May 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
