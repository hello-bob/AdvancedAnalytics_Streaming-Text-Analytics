The subject had\nalready dominated hours and hours of postnatal therapy. How or when would I\never feel ready to have another child?\n\nIn fact, my most-searched phrase on Google became: \u2018How likely am I to get\npostnatal depression (PND) twice?\u2019.\n\nFor those not familiar with PND, it is a condition causing low mood and often\nanxiety in the postpartum period. Estimates from the NHS put the number of new\nmothers and those expecting a baby experiencing mental health difficulties at\n27%.\n\nI thought I\u2019d never be able to overcome this fear, but I\u2019m now seven months\npregnant \u2013 and really excited.\n\nBefore I had my son, I spent my whole life dreaming of him. In this imagined\nfuture, there\u2019d be a troop! A squad! A gang of kids that each knew me as Mum.\n\nSo when I met my partner in the Covid-19 lockdowns, I was so relieved to learn\nthat he shared my vision, which shifted from dream to reality in June 2022\nwith the birth of our first son.\n\nHe was genuinely the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen. There was so much joy\nin the room, and I felt a profound love for him immediately.\n\nBut from the moment he was placed in my arms, I started to worry about whether\nI would (or could) be enough of a mother for him.\n\nHave you faced fears about having a second child due to past\nexperiences?Comment Now\n\nVery soon after delivery, I began to cry and asked the midwife if there was\nsomething wrong with me. I was shocked and exhausted, and very much not on the\npost-birth \u2018high\u2019 that I had been told was a given.\n\nThe midwife assured me this was completely normal and I put it to the back of\nmy mind, assuming it was just a fleeting worry. We muddled through our first\nday and night, before being discharged and allowed to go home.\n\nAs the first few blurry days passed, we were struck by numerous challenges. He\nwanted to be held all of the time, which put an abrupt stop to the idea we\nboth had to catch up on sleep after a long few days of labour.\n\nBreastfeeding was truly impossible too, and didn\u2019t get any easier as the days\nwore on. As a result, he was jaundiced and dropping weight.\n\nThe little thread I\u2019d found unpicked on the day I birthed him began to unravel\nmore and more as I pulled it \u2013 until soon, huge seams began to burst. The idea\nthat I was not capable of looking after him took hold.\n\nI would spend all day ruminating on all my perceived failures as a mother and\non how to fix them, obsessively scrolling Google for \u2018magical solutions\u2019. At\nnight I would lie in my bed, between my sleeping husband and baby drenched in\nsweat, panicking and completely unable to drift off.\n\nI became convinced I was a defective mother and always would be. I felt\nprofound guilt towards my son for the fact I struggled so much, when others \u2013\nI presumed \u2013 were finding things much easier. I also felt as though I\u2019d let my\nhusband down.\n\nThere were many twists and turns but to keep it brief: I was diagnosed with\npostnatal depression and anxiety (PND/A) in August 2022.\n\n### More Trending\n\nI'm 74 but feel 40 because of my once-a-week expense\n\nI rented a room to a nice young woman.

That the beautiful\nfamily my husband and I had dreamed of together was just that: a dream.\n\nThanks to medication and therapy, the dark clouds had become fewer and further\nbetween (Picture: Rose Stokes)\n\nUnder the weight of all of this, one of the most confronting feelings I\nexperienced was a sense of grief for the other children we were supposed to\nhave together. I felt certain that because I had buckled so easily under the\nweight of the transition to motherhood that I could never have another child.\nHow would I survive it?\n\nAfter such a tough year \u2013 in which my partner had been such a huge emotional\nsupport for me as I recovered, alongside managing the transition himself into\nnew parenthood \u2013 how could we survive it?\n\nBut despite this crippling fear, things around me had started to move and\nshift. We\u2019d left London and my nervous system had exhaled so deeply I felt\npeaceful for the first time in years.\n\nThanks to medication and therapy, the dark clouds became fewer and further\nbetween \u2013 which was around a year after my PND diagnosis.\n\nI was finding myself in motherhood and really enjoying it. We finally all felt\nlike we\u2019d hit our rhythm.\n\nUntil one day in September 2023, my husband let me know that he was ready to\nhave another child if I ever changed my mind. He reassured me that if I really\nfelt I couldn\u2019t, he would accept it. \u2018We do make good babies though,\u2019 was his\nclosing statement.\n\nWe went to bed and my brain went into overdrive. But in the space where\nanxiety had once been crippling, I started to imagine our life as a family of\nfour.\n\nI let myself think of our son as a big brother. I thought about future\nholidays, of my children bickering in the back of the car as we came home from\nthe beach, covered in sand and full of love. I felt the flutters of excitement\nbuild until, the next morning, I announced that I was ready.\n\nI am now 30 weeks pregnant with our second son.\n\nMan walks the length of the UK to raise awareness about postnatal depression\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nLoaded: 1.72%\n\n00:00\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 11:22\n\nMan walks the length of the UK to raise awareness about postnatal\ndepressionhttps://metro.co.uk/video/man-walks-length-uk-raise-awareness-\npostnatal-depression-2658419/2658419\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

Over time, I was\nable to see that my difficult experience, and recovery \u2013 rather than deeming\nme unqualified to do it all again \u2013 were actually the perfect training for the\njob.\n\nI am under no illusion that it will be hard and I know that my mental health\nmay struggle. But I\u2019ve also seen the other side now; I know that it really\ndoes get easier. And I am confident that whatever happens, we can handle it.\n\nIn the darkest days of my depression, I would search the internet desperately\nfor stories of women who had PND but who had still gone on to have more\nchildren.\n\nI found so much strength in learning that though the condition had robbed me\nof a lot of my mental peace during my son\u2019s first year of life, it was not a\nreflection on my success as a mother. Nor did it disqualify me from having\nmore children.\n\nIf anyone is in the thick of it now and stumbles across this article engaged\nin the very same search as me, here\u2019s your evidence that not only can you\nrecover from PND, but you can get to a place of acceptance where you feel\ncapable of having another child.\n\nAnd even excited. There is so much life beyond fear \u2013 and you can get there in\ntime.\n\nIf you or anyone else you know is struggling with their mental health\npostnatally, please do get in touch with PaNDAS either via their website or\ntheir helpline on 0808 1961 776.\n\nDo you have a story you\u2019d like to share?
