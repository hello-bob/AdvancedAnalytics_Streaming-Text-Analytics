Specifically,\n> we propose Socratic reasoning, a general framework that promotes in-depth\n> thinking with LLMs for complex problem-solving. Socratic reasoning\n> encourages LLMs to recursively discover, solve, and integrate problems while\n> facilitating self-evaluation and refinement. Our pilot study on the P vs. NP\n> problem shows that GPT-4 successfully produces a proof schema and engages in\n> rigorous reasoning throughout 97 dialogue turns, concluding \"P \\neq NP\",\n> which is in alignment with (Xu and Zhou, 2023). The investigation uncovers\n> novel insights within the extensive solution space of LLMs, shedding light\n> on LLM for Science.\n\nComments:| 73 pages  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2309.05689 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2309.05689v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.05689arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Li Dong [view email] [v1] Mon, 11 Sep 2023 17:49:27 UTC (128 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Large Language Model for Science: A Study on P\nvs. NP, by Qingxiu Dong and 6 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2309\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
