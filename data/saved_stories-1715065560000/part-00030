The HTML page, Title and Favicon are all in dark\nmode. There are two parts to this:\n\n\u2705 HTML Webpage\n\n\u2705 Favicon\n\nThe HTML Webpage uses simple code to create a \"dark mode\" page. It points to a\nblack colored Favicon, so the tab will be in dark mode as well. The HTML\ntitle, which appears on the browser tab, is also blank, with the following\ncode:\n\n    \n    \n    <title>&#65279;</title>\n\nHow to setup:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Decide where you will store the two files (HTML and Favicon). I recommend\nMy Documents.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Change the below code in the HTML file to reflect the directory where you\nwill store the Favicon:\n\n    \n    \n    <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/Users/name/Documents/favicon.ico\">\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Put the HTML file in the same directory as the Favicon.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Rename the HTML file as you wish.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 In your browser, set the Homepage to the HTML file that you renamed.\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 Make sure your browser is set to display the homepage icon.\n\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 Click the homepage icon and enjoy a few moments of quiet thinking..\n\nHere is the HTML if you want to copy and paste it:\n\n    \n    \n    <html> <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"/Users/name/Documents/favicon.ico\"> <head><title>&#65279;</title></head> <body bgcolor=\"black\"> </body> </html>\n\n\u2b50 Bonus Section \u2b50\n\nRedirect to HTML pages based on the time of day. Someone may want two sets of\nlinks - one for day (work related) and one for night. In the below, you create\ntwo additional webpages - index-day.html and index-night.html. The code is\ncurrently set to redirect to index-day.html between 6am and 7pm (the 6 and 19\nvariables). No special code needed for the day and night index pages. Change\nthe links as you wish (perhaps to even non-HTML links). A downloadable HTML\nfile of the below is available.\n\n    \n    \n    <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /> <title>Links</title> </head> <body> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> // var SpecialRedirectURL = ['night.html','morning.html','day.html','eve.html']; var SpecialRedirectURL = [ 'index-night.html', 'index-day.html' ]; function specRedirect() { var currentTime = new Date(); var currentHour = currentTime.getHours(); var Hour = 0; if ( (currentHour >= 6) && (currentHour < 19) ) { Hour = 1; } // alert(Hour+' goes to: '+SpecialRedirectURL[Hour]); window.location.href = SpecialRedirectURL[Hour]; } window.onload = function() { specRedirect(); } </script> </body> </html>\n\nIdeas for forks..\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Change the colors.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Add minimalist content like the weather.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Whatever else you can think of..\n\nEnjoy!\n\n## About\n\nNo distraction, dark mode, html webpage and redirect to HTML pages (or\nanything) based on the time of day\n\n### Topics\n\nhtml webpage favicon homepage relax distraction-free dark-mode\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n1 star\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * HTML 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
