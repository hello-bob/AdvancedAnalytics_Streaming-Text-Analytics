In other\ncases, hackers working in nation-state-backed advanced persistent threat\ngroups take control of devices previously hacked by the cybercrime groups.\nSometimes the devices are independently compromised multiple times by\ndifferent groups. The result is a free-for-all inside routers and, to a lesser\nextent, VPN devices and virtual private servers provided by hosting companies.\n\n\u201cCybercriminals and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors share a common\ninterest in proxy anonymization layers and Virtual Private Network (VPN) nodes\nto hide traces of their presence and make detection of malicious activities\nmore difficult,\u201d Trend Micro researchers Feike Hacquebord and Fernando Merces\nwrote. \u201cThis shared interest results in malicious internet traffic blending\nfinancial and espionage motives.\u201d\n\n## Pawn Storm, a spammer, and a proxy service\n\n### Further Reading\n\nHackers backed by Russia and China are infecting SOHO routers like yours, FBI\nwarns\n\nA good example is a network made up primarily of EdgeRouter devices sold by\nmanufacturer Ubiquiti. After the FBI discovered it had been infected by a\nKremlin-backed group and used as a botnet to camouflage ongoing attacks\ntargeting governments, militaries, and other organizations worldwide, it\ncommenced an operation in January to temporarily disinfect them.\n\nThe Russian hackers gained control after the devices were already infected\nwith Moobot, which is botnet malware used by financially motivated threat\nactors not affiliated with the Russian government. These threat actors\ninstalled Moobot after first exploiting publicly known default administrator\ncredentials that hadn\u2019t been removed from the devices by the people who owned\nthem. The Russian hackers\u2014known by a variety of names including Pawn Storm,\nAPT28, Forest Blizzard, Sofacy, and Sednit\u2014then exploited a vulnerability in\nthe Moobot malware and used it to install custom scripts and malware that\nturned the botnet into a global cyber espionage platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trend Micro researchers said that Pawn Storm was using the hijacked botnet\nto proxy (1) logins that used stolen account credentials and (2) attacks that\nexploited a critical zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange that went\nunfixed until March 2023. The zero-day exploits allowed Pawn Storm to obtain\nthe cryptographic hash of users\u2019 Outlook passwords simply by sending them a\nspecially formatted email. Once in possession of the hash, Pawn Storm\nperformed a so-called NTLMv2 hash relay attack that funneled logins to the\nuser accounts through one of the botnet devices. Microsoft provided a diagram\nof the attack pictured below:\n\nEnlarge\n\nMicrosoft\n\nTrend Micro observed the same botnet being used to send spam with\npharmaceutical themes that have the hallmarks of what\u2019s known as the Canadian\nPharmacy gang. Yet another group installed malware known as Ngioweb on botnet\ndevices. Ngioweb was first found in 2019 running on routers from DLink,\nNetgear, and other manufacturers, as well as other devices running Linux on\ntop of x86, ARM, and MIPS hardware. The purpose of Ngioweb is to provide\nproxies individuals can use to route their online activities through a series\nof regularly changing IP addresses, particularly those located in the US with\nreputations for trustworthiness. It\u2019s not clear precisely who uses the\nNgioweb-powered service.\n\nThe Trend Micro researchers wrote:\n\n> In the specific case of the compromised Ubiquiti EdgeRouters, we observed\n> that a botnet operator has been installing backdoored SSH servers and a\n> suite of scripts on the compromised devices for years without much attention\n> from the security industry, allowing persistent access. Another threat actor\n> installed the Ngioweb malware that runs only in memory to add the bots to a\n> commercially available residential proxy botnet. Pawn Storm most likely\n> easily brute forced the credentials of the backdoored SSH servers and thus\n> gained access to a pool of EdgeRouter devices they could abuse for various\n> purposes.\n\nThe researchers provided the following table, summarizing the botnet-sharing\narrangement among Pawn Storm and the two other groups, tracked as Water Zmeu\nand Water Barghest:\n\nEnlarge\n\nTrend Micro\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if either of the groups was responsible for installing the\npreviously mentioned Moobot malware that the FBI reported finding on the\ndevices. If not, that would mean routers were independently infected by three\nfinancially motivated groups, in addition to Pawn Storm, further underscoring\nthe ongoing rush by multiple threat groups to establish secret listening posts\ninside routers. Trend Micro researchers weren\u2019t available to clarify.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe post went on to report that while the January operation by the FBI put a\ndent in the infrastructure Pawn Storm depended on, legal constraints prevented\nthe operation from preventing reinfection. What\u2019s more, the botnet also\ncomprised virtual public servers and Raspberry Pi devices that weren't\naffected by the FBI action.\n\n\u201cThis means that despite the efforts of law enforcement, Pawn Storm still has\naccess to many other compromised assets, including EdgeServers,\u201d the Trend\nMicro report said. \u201cFor example, IP address 32[.]143[.]50[.]222 was used as an\nSMB reflector around February 8, 2024. The same IP address was used as a proxy\nin a credential phishing attack on February 6 2024 against various government\nofficials around the world.\u201d\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n23\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
