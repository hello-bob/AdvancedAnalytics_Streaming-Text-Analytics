In\nthis paper, we present Video2Game, a novel approach that automatically\nconverts videos of real-world scenes into realistic and interactive game\nenvironments. At the heart of our system are three core components:(i) a\nneural radiance fields (NeRF) module that effectively captures the geometry\nand visual appearance of the scene; (ii) a mesh module that distills the\nknowledge from NeRF for faster rendering; and (iii) a physics module that\nmodels the interactions and physical dynamics among the objects. By following\nthe carefully designed pipeline, one can construct an interactable and\nactionable digital replica of the real world. We benchmark our system on both\nindoor and large-scale outdoor scenes. We show that we can not only produce\nhighly-realistic renderings in real-time, but also build interactive games on\ntop.\n\nView arXiv page View PDF Add to collection\n\n### Community\n\n\u00b7 Sign up or log in to comment\n\nUpvote\n\n16\n\n## Models citing this paper 0\n\nNo model linking this paper\n\nCite arxiv.org/abs/2404.09833 in a model README.md to link it from this page.\n\n## Datasets citing this paper 0\n\nNo dataset linking this paper\n\nCite arxiv.org/abs/2404.09833 in a dataset README.md to link it from this\npage.\n\n### Spaces citing this paper 0\n\nNo Space linking this paper\n\nCite arxiv.org/abs/2404.09833 in a Space README.md to link it from this page.\n\n## Collections including this paper 3\n\n", "frontpage": true}
