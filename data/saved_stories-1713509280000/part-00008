It\u2019s also about amplifying their voices and\nfostering a culture of discussion and discovery.\n\nThe following piece was written by one of our Pioneers, Jesse Duffield, who\nruns a fantastic blog of his own\u2014Pursuit of Laziness.\n\n\\-------\n\nRecently, I was lucky enough to be chosen as a Pioneer in Codacy\u2019s Pioneers\nProgram, which offers mentoring and funding for open-source developers. During\na promotional interview with the Codacy team, I was asked whether I believe\nopen-source developers should be paid for their work.\n\nI would love to say that I had a reasonable and charming answer up my sleeve,\nbut the truth is that I completely botched it. I would give an answer, retract\nit, think again, then give another answer. I did this a few times.\n\nTo the team\u2019s credit, I was given plenty of time to sort out my thoughts but\nthe truth is, the question was too big for me to tackle in real time.\n\nWhich is why it\u2019s so good to be back in the cosy comfort of the written form,\nwhere I have all the time in the world to think things through. This post is\nmy attempt to properly answer the question: should open-source developers get\npaid?\n\n\u201cShould\u201d is a magical word: it takes a topic from the boring world of\npragmatism and incentives and elevates it into the world of ethics, where\ninternet thought leaders wage daily battles over what we\u2019re morally obligated\nto do.\n\nPeople generally don\u2019t like being told that they\u2019re falling short of their\nmoral obligations (just ask my dad what he thinks about vegetarians), so when\nsomebody says \u2018We should definitely be paying open source developers more!\u2019\nit\u2019s bound to ruffle some feathers.\n\nSo what do our thought leader overlords have to say?\n\nWhat Others Are Saying\n\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), creator of hugely successful open-source\nproject Ruby on Rails, decries the encroachment of market-based thinking into\nopen source. Instead, he advocates for keeping money out of it so that open-\nsource developers don\u2019t feel indebted to their users (or donors):\n\n\"Open source, as seen through the altruistic lens of the MIT gift license, has\nthe power to break us free from this overly rational cost-benefit analysis\nbull**** that\u2019s impoverishing our lives in so many other ways.\"\n\nDHH sees open-source development as a pure form of self expression which can\nonly be tarnished by introducing money into the equation. He believes you have\ntwo choices: introduce money and become a slave to your customers (be it\nsponsors or paying users), or eschew money and retain complete freedom.\n\nIt\u2019s a deliberately provocative dichotomy, but I have to say it does resonate.\nBurnout is a big thing in open source and most burnout happens when you start\nto feel like you\u2019re working because you have to, and not because you want to.\nIf you accept money for your open-source product, it\u2019s often with strings\nattached like providing support or prioritising tickets, which can be dull and\nunsatisfying work.\n\nBut hang on, accepting money in exchange for dull and unsatisfying work: isn\u2019t\nthat the typical day job? Indeed it is, with the difference being that unless\nyou\u2019re Linus Torvalds, the typical day job pays much better than an open-\nsource income. Let\u2019s contrast DHH\u2019s thoughts against those of Salvatore\nSanfilippo, creator of the world\u2019s de-facto standard distributed key-value\nstore, Redis. Salvatore believes that given the amount of value that open-\nsource projects create for companies, it\u2019s unfair that they are compensated so\npoorly:\n\n\"In my opinion, instead, what the open source does not get back in a fair\namount is money, not patches. The new startups movement, and the low costs of\noperations of many large IT companies, are based on the existence of so much\nopen source code working well. Businesses should try to share a small fraction\nof the money they earn with the people who wrote the open-source software that\nis a key factor for their success, and I think that a sane way to redistribute\npart of the money is by hiring those people to just write open source software\n(like VMware did with me), or to provide donations.\"\n\nSalvatore also claims that if you could compensate open-source devs better,\nthe increased output from open source would have a far better impact on the\neconomy than whatever they produce at their day job.\n\nMany developers do a lot of work in their free time for passion, only a small\npercentage happens to be payed for their contribution to open source. Some\nredistribution may allow more people to focus on the code they write for\npassion and that possibly has a much [more] important effect on the economy\ncompared to what they do at work to get the salary every month. And\nunfortunately it is not possible to pay bills with pull requests, so why\nproviding help to the project with source contributions is a good and sane\nthing to do, it is not enough in my opinion.\n\nAs you can see, DHH and Salvatore have little overlap in their perspectives.\nDHH sees money as a corrupting force which gets in the way of self-\nactualisation, whereas Salvatore sees money as a means of giving devs the\nfreedom to work on their open-source projects in the first place. DHH believes\nthat so long as an open-source dev has not asked for money, no money is owed,\nwhereas Salvatore believes that the creation of value by open-source projects\nis sufficient to obligate companies to compensate the devs.\n\n## Ethics and Incentives\n\nSo there are two separate questions in play: the ethical question of whether\nopen-source devs deserve more money, and the practical question of whether\nmore money actually incentivises better outcomes.\n\nThe ethical question, at its root, is a question about desert. Not desert as\nin camels and sand dunes, but desert as in \u2018Does X deserve Y?\u2019.\n\nThis is probably a good time to mention that I don\u2019t believe in free will, and\nthis has a huge impact on how I approach ethical questions. I don\u2019t think that\nanybody deserves anything, good or bad! I don\u2019t think the worst possible\ncriminals deserve punishment, or that the best possible heroes deserve medals.\nBut (bear with me) I do think it\u2019s great that criminals are punished and\nheroes are rewarded because it incentivises good behaviour.\n\nThis brings us to the practical question: regardless of whether open-source\ndevs deserve more money, does money actually incentivise open-source devs to\ncreate more value?\n\nAt a basic level, if money couldn\u2019t incentivise hard work, there would be no\npoint in companies paying high salaries to attract talent. By this logic money\nshould have the power to create more open-source value. Open source tools like\nMagit would not be where they are today were it not for its maintainer Jonas\nBernoulli running a successful kickstarter campaign to fund a year of full-\ntime work on the project. And, to this day, he continues working on his open-\nsource work full-time.\n\nThe burnout we typically associate with open source is not from a developer\nworking on open source, but from a developer balancing open source with a\ndemanding full-time job, which is only needed to pay the bills because open\nsource work can\u2019t.\n\n## My Open Source Experience\n\nI\u2019m an above-average earner from open source\u2014which is not hard when the median\nis zero dollars. And yet if you consider the time I\u2019ve poured into Lazygit\nover the last five years I\u2019m easily being paid less hourly than a minimum wage\nworker!\n\nI don\u2019t consider this an injustice at all: I\u2019ve had a complete blast working\non the project and it\u2019s my proudest achievement in life so far. Even if it\ndoesn\u2019t pay proper salary, every time I\u2019m notified that somebody has sponsored\nme, I get a warm feeling that really does motivate me to continue maintaining\nand improving the project.\n\nAnd as I\u2019m moving into a new role where I\u2019ll be making zero dollars from my\nday job (at least for the next year), Lazygit is (absurdly) now my main source\nof income. This creates an even larger incentive for me to continue\nmaintaining it.\n\nBut can I honestly say that if all donations stopped I would stop working on\nLazgit? As much as it contradicts the above, the answer is a resounding no.\nHumans do things for many reasons, and money is only one of them.\n\nFor one, I\u2019m an avid Lazygit user (as you can imagine), so I directly benefit\nfrom every improvement to it. But more generally, working on Lazygit is fun.\nFun encapsulates various things like problem-solving, creativity, street cred,\nself-expression, and utility\u2014all of which can be found in the world of open-\nsource development.\n\nPerhaps it is tragic that most of the fun things in life pay the worst, but\nthat doesn\u2019t stop them from being fun.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo me, the important question is not \"Should open source devs get paid?\" but\n\"Why do open source devs work without pay in the first place?\"\n\nThe answer is that there is much to love about the experience of open-source\nwork that has nothing to do with money: creative problem-solving,\ncollaboration, personal utility from the tool you\u2019re building, and the list\ngoes on.\n\nI don\u2019t see money as a corrupting force like DDH does, nor do share Salvatore\nSanfilippo\u2019s perspective that the lack of money in open-source is unfair. I\nsee money as a nice bonus on top of the existing perks of working on an open-\nsource project.\n\nSo, I\u2019m all in favour of open-source devs being paid more, but I expect that\nthings will continue chugging along just fine whether or not society finds\nways to channel more money to the open-source cause.\n\nAs for me, I\u2019ll continue working on Lazygit until it stops being fun.\n\n\\-------\n\nShameless plug: I recently quit my job to co-found Zenbu, a web app that helps\nyou manage your company's SaaS subscriptions.
