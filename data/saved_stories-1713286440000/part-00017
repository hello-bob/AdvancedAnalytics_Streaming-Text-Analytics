We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for\n> efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon\n> inherits the architecture of Mega (exponential moving average with gated\n> attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve\n> its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average\n> (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and\n> pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head\n> comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than\n> Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training\n> tokens. Megalodon reaches a training loss of 1.70, landing mid-way between\n> Llama2-7B (1.75) and 13B (1.67).
