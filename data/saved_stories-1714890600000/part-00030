Because the term \"neural\" comes with a lot of\n> historical baggage, I prefer the simpler term \"differentiable models\" in the\n> text. The focus of this 250-pages volume is on building efficient blocks for\n> processing nD data, including convolutions, transformers, graph layers, and\n> modern recurrent models (including linearized transformers and structured\n> state-space models). Because the field is evolving quickly, I have tried to\n> strike a good balance between theory and code, historical considerations and\n> recent trends. I assume the reader has some exposure to machine learning and\n> linear algebra, but I try to cover the preliminaries when necessary. The\n> volume is a refined draft from a set of lecture notes for a course called\n> Neural Networks for Data Science Applications that I teach in Sapienza. I do\n> not cover many advanced topics (generative modeling, explainability,\n> prompting, agents), which will be published over time in the companion\n> website.\n\nComments:| Companion website for additional chapters: this https URL  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.17625 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.17625v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Simone Scardapane [view email] [v1] Fri, 26 Apr 2024 15:19:58 UTC\n(13,152 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Alice's Adventures in a Differentiable\nWonderland -- Volume I, A Tour of the Land, by Simone Scardapane\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
