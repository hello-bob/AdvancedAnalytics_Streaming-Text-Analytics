(NASA's Goddard Space\nFlight Center Conceptual Image Lab)\n\nIf you thought you had a voracious appetite, you've got nothing on a newly\ndiscovered supermassive black hole.\n\nThe black hole at the center of a quasar galaxy called J0529-4351 is guzzling\ndown so much material it basically swallows about a Sun's worth of gas and\ndust a day, onto a black hole that is already around 17 billion Suns' worth of\nmass.\n\nThat's the hungriest black hole we've spotted yet, says a team of astronomers\nled by Christian Wolf of the Australian National University, growing so fast\nthat it's practically at the maximum limit of how much material it can\naccrete.\n\nIt represents a fascinating laboratory for understanding how supermassive\nblack holes grow and evolve on the extreme end of the scale. But also, it's\njust really freaking awesome.\n\nSupermassive black holes are a mind-boggling proposition. They're black holes\nmillions to billions of times the mass of the Sun, and they can usually be\nfound at the centers of galaxies, the giant gravitational blob around which\nthe entire thing rotates.\n\nThe thing is, scientists don't really know how they got that way. Much smaller\nblack holes \u2013 ones that are a few tens of solar masses \u2013 form from the direct\ncollapse of the cores of massive stars when they die, and they can grow\nthrough collisions with other stellar-mass black holes.\n\nBut supermassive black holes are, frankly, too big for this formation channel\nto be efficient, particularly early in the Universe's history.\n\nThere are other theoretical formation channels, but one way we can better\nunderstand how supermassive black holes get so chonky is by looking for ones\nthat are growing, and study them. This is where quasars \u2013 like J0529-4351 \u2013\nenter the scene. These are galaxies with central black holes that are feeding\nravenously.\n\nThe black hole sits at the center of a huge, roiling, rotating mass of\nmaterial that swirls around the black hole, feeding into it like water\ngurgling down a drain.\n\nThe intense friction and gravity causes this material to heat up to billions\nor even trillions of degrees, blazing brightly across space in light across\nthe spectrum. Astronomers can study this light, teasing it apart to work out\nthe properties of the black hole within.\n\nQuasar J0529-4351, as seen in the Dark Energy Survey, being photobombed by a\nforeground red dwarf star. (Wolf et al., Nat. Astron., 2024)\n\nJ0529-4351 is a quasar found in the Cosmic Noon, around 1.5 billion years\nafter the Big Bang. That's very early in the history of the Universe \u2013 its\nlight has traveled for more than 12 billion years to reach us \u2013 which makes\nits huge mass of 17 to 19 billion times the mass of the Sun (not the heftiest\never seen, but certainly getting up there) challenging to understand.\n\nHowever, the rate at which the black hole is consuming matter could shed some\nlight on its colossal size. Wolf and his team calculated that the black hole\nis growing at a rate of around 370 solar masses per year. That's a little more\nthan the mass of the Sun falling onto the black hole every day.\n\nGiven the mass of the black hole, that's very close to a limit known as the\nEddington limit. That's the maximum stable rate at which a black hole can\nfeed. A black hole can briefly undergo super-Eddington accretion, but at these\nrates, the material starts to glow so strongly that the radiation pressure\nwill push away the material around the black hole until it is out of\ngravitational reach.\n\nThat means that the black hole powering J0529-4351 is growing about as fast as\nit is able. Many quasars, in fact, appear to host black holes close to\nEddington accretion; but J0529-4351 takes the biscuit. It's the brightest and\nmost rapacious supermassive black hole we've seen to date.\n\n\"In terms of luminosity and likely growth rate,\" the researchers write,\n\"J0529-4351 is the most extreme quasar known.\"\n\nThere's a lot we don't understand yet about J0529-4351. The mechanisms for its\nmassive accretion are not yet known; a closer look using the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array in Chile could reveal how gas is moving around\nin the galaxy, and how the galaxy is spinning. The team also hopes to find\nother extreme quasars lurking in the distant reaches of space and time.\n\nAlthough such extreme examples of these objects are rare, Wolf and his\ncolleagues believe there lie more, waiting to be discovered, out there in the\nwide and wonderful cosmos.\n\nThe research has been published in Nature Astronomy.\n\nTrending News\n\nFasting-Style Diet Seems to Result in Dynamic Changes to Human Brain Health2\ndays ago\n\nThe Polar Vortex Has Shifted Into Reverse \u2013 And Is Now Spinning Backwards\nEnvironment5 days ago\n\nScientists Accidentally Made a Mouse Grow Legs in Place of Genitals Health3\ndays ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
