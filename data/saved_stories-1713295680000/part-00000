Target bored young men who want to make a fortune.\n\nThe boys-who-like-to-bet bank is open, and a slew of companies are making as\nmany withdrawals as they can. iStock; Rebecca Zisser/BI\n\nEmily Stewart\n\nApr 16, 2024, 9:22 AM UTC\n\nFacebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link\n\nRead in app\n\nHOMEPAGE\n\nNewsletters\n\nLog in\n\nSubscribe\n\nIf you want to gamble in America these days, you have more ways to put your\nmoney on the line than ever. You've got the real-life casino, the casino on\nyour phone, sports betting, crypto, meme stocks \u2014 even complex financial\nproducts like zero-day options can give you a quick hit of risk. For young men\nin particular, it's an enticing, if a bit troubling, prospect. But for a\nvariety of companies, from sportsbooks to investing apps, an increased\nwillingness to make some kind of gamble means business is booming. The boys-\nwho-like-to-bet bank is open, and companies are making as many withdrawals as\nthey can.\n\nThe level at which gambling has become normalized in the United States in\nrecent years is stunning. Americans legally bet a record $119.84 billion on\nsports in 2023, up from $93 billion in 2022. Since the Supreme Court in 2018\nstruck down a federal law prohibiting sports gambling, more than three dozen\nstates have embraced it in some form. Seven states have also legalized\niGaming, meaning online blackjack, roulette, and slot machines.\n\nAnd while not explicitly gambling, free trading apps such as Robinhood have\ngotten an increasing number of ordinary people into investing \u2014 for fun, to\nalleviate boredom, to try to make some extra cash. While many people have used\nthe apps to build a stable portfolio, a good chunk of people are doing high-\nrisk day trading or piling into meme stocks like GameStop, AMC, or, as Donald\nTrump's people are hoping, his newly public social-media company. Crypto is\nback again, and this time around, almost nobody is pretending the endeavor is\nabout anything other than \"number go up.\" Many video games have a gambling-\nlike aspect, too, that gets kids and adolescents into the risk-minded\npipeline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile plenty of people across demographics are participating in these trends,\ndata suggests the crowds skew younger and male. A 2023 survey from the NCAA\nfound that sports gambling was prevalent among young adults, specifically on\ncollege campuses and among Black and Latino respondents. Pew Research found in\n2022 that men and people under 50 were likelier to bet on sports than women\nand the over-50 crowd. Younger men tend to be more into crypto and meme-stock\ntrading as well.\n\nThis isn't surprising. Men tend to take more financial risks than women. As\ninvestors, they're more prone to overconfidence, which often leads them to\ntrade more \u2014 and, as a result, get lower returns. Men generally gamble more\nthan women, and they've been found to have lower levels of impulsive coping in\ngambling settings.\n\nThe precise reason for this behavior is hard to pin down, said Timothy Fong, a\nclinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA and the codirector of its gambling-\nstudies program. There's a cultural component: In the '80s, young men were fed\nmovies like \"Wall Street,\" shown flashy cars and money, and told that greed is\ngood. In the '90s and early 2000s, they were sold on more traditional forms of\ngambling and poker. Now they're being marketed sports betting and crypto. But\nit also goes deeper than that.\n\n\"For years, when we've studied gambling behaviors as well as other addictive\nbehaviors, the trend has always been males more than females are impacted,\"\nFong said. \"People have said, well, is that a biological risk? Is that a\nculturally driven risk? Is that a psychological risk or a social risk factor?\nAnd basically, what I can say is that it's probably a combination.\"\n\nThere may be FOMO, as in fear of missing out. Younger men see their friends\nplaying in crypto or betting on sports, and they want to join in. Many of them\nhave income they're not doing more productive things with, especially in the\nwake of a pandemic that has a lot of consumers who were once trying to save up\nthinking, \"Eh, screw it.\" Maybe 40 years ago a 28-year-old had a mortgage and\na family to support. Now he doesn't have those responsibilities and can direct\ndisposable income toward whichever stock he just saw recommended on Reddit or\na bet on whether the next pitch in a baseball game will be a ball or a strike.\n\n> \"For years, when we've studied gambling behaviors as well as other addictive\n> behaviors, the trend has always been males more than females are impacted\"\n\nKahlil Philander, a Washington State University professor who focuses on\npublic policy and gambling, said this gambling boom is being compounded by a\nnovelty effect. Many young people are being exposed to gambling for the first\ntime. and a wide variety of products are being marketed aggressively to them.\nAll the advertising dollars that have been spent on sports-betting platforms\nand crypto exchanges, for example, have amplified the exposure effect. The\nother part of the story is that many of these people haven't gambled before:\nUnlike a 60-year-old who's been there, done that, they haven't internalized\nthe downsides.\n\n\"If there are risks or risk-mitigating strategies that individuals can take,\nthey might not have learned those lessons yet,\" Philander said. \"That can lead\nto higher levels of involvement, more harmful activity, all the types of\nthings that people with more experience might have figured out for themselves\none way or another.\"\n\nAt the heart of this is technology is the idea that guys don't have to walk\nover to the casino to place a bet or call a broker to trade a stock \u2014 they can\njust take out their phones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The technology that brings us that intersection between gambling, gaming,\ninvesting, and financial risk, that technology barrier is so low right now,\"\nFong said.\n\nFor some young men, a level of nihilism about the economy leads to an impetus\nto take some risks. It shows up in movies like \"Dumb Money,\" about the\nGameStop phenomenon, or \"This Is Not Financial Advice,\" a documentary about\ndogecoin where the protagonists are portrayed as Davids against Goliaths \u2014\nhedge funds, but also the economic system at large.\n\n\"We're at a place as a society where there are many new forms of gambling\nwhere the nature of investing and financial risk-taking is much different than\nit was before,\" Philander said.\n\nThe billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has a penchant for doing some\nfinger-wagging from time to time, described the shifting nature of investing\nin his latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors.\n\n\"For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than\nthey did when I was young,\" he wrote. \"The casino now resides in many homes\nand daily tempts the occupants.\"\n\nAlong with the rise of new customers, problem-gambling behavior is increasing,\nespecially among young men. A 2023 report on the prevalence of gambling in New\nJersey \u2014 where sports betting and online gambling are legal, and where\nAtlantic City is \u2014 found that men had double the rate of high-risk problem\ngambling than women and that those ages 18 to 44 were at the highest risk. The\nNew Jersey report identified a significant prevalence of high-risk stock\ntrading among young men. In the state, which pushed to have the federal law\nprohibiting sports betting overturned, calls to its problem-gambling hotline\ntripled in five years, with people 25 to 34 being the likeliest to reach out.\n\n> \"The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants\" Warren\n> Buffett\n\nMost people who gamble don't wind up with an addiction. According to the\nNational Council on Problem Gambling, some 2.5 million Americans have a severe\ngambling problem, and another 5 million to 8 million have a problem it\nconsiders mild or moderate. That's a small sliver of the population. Plenty of\npeople do some amount of betting and eventually fall off, or they dip in from\ntime to time and are just fine. The public's interest in crypto ebbs and\nflows, and just because someone got into meme stocks for a while doesn't mean\nthey're living on Wall Street Bets forever.\n\nStill, the explosion of playing so much with money in the US is worrying,\nespecially without a lot going on in the way of regulations, education, or\nsafeguards to keep problem gambling in check. At least a sports-betting app\nwill nudge someone to slow down if they go too far \u2014 there are virtually no\nprotections in place if your day-trading habit gets out of hand, and many\npeople don't even realize that what they're doing really is gambling. Fong\ntold me he sees patients who will have lost thousands of dollars playing\nstocks and insist they just didn't time the market right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The one question I'll ask folks, I'll say, 'Does this behavior make your life\nbetter, or does it create problems?'\" he said. \"And that's it.\"\n\nCasinos, sportsbooks, and trading platforms want to make money off bettors,\nand the way to do that is to get them to play more, not less. While many young\nmen will eventually move on from their betting habits, not all of them will \u2014\nand the company's hope is to turn them into clients for life.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about\nbusiness and the economy.\n\n#### About Discourse Stories\n\nThrough our Discourse journalism, Business Insider seeks to explore and\nilluminate the day\u2019s most fascinating issues and ideas.
