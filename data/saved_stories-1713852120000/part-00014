Gitlin - 4/22/2024, 2:40 PM\n\nEnlarge / Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" system just got a third cheaper.\n\nEdie Leong for The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n333\n\nTesla has dropped the price of its controversial \"Full Self Driving\" partially\nautomated driver assist. Last week, getting access to FSD would cost you\n$12,000\u2014today, it's a third cheaper at $8,000. Alternatively, customers can\nsubscribe to the feature for $99 a month.\n\nTesla has bet heavily on FSD for the future of the company. It's one of two\npartially automated driving systems offered by Tesla\u2014Autopilot is the older\nand less-capable system. FSD includes features such as auto lane changes, auto\nparking, the ability to summon the car from its parking space, and lane\nkeeping (Autosteer in Tesla-speak) on surface streets.\n\nTesla claims that \"[y]our car will be able to drive itself almost anywhere\nwith minimal driver intervention and will continuously improve,\" but then also\nnotes that \"[t]he currently enabled features require active driver supervision\nand do not make the vehicle autonomous.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Autopilot, which has now been blamed for multiple deaths, there are\nsafety concerns with using FSD.\n\nLast year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration forced Tesla to\nrecall nearly 363,000 cars, as the driver assist system could \"allow the\nvehicle to act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through\nan intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled\nintersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an\nintersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution.\"\n\nThe same year, a group of Tesla investors sued the company, claiming that\nTesla CEO Elon Musk repeatedly made false statements about the safety and\ncapabilities of the FSD system.\n\nBut FSD is now more critical than ever to Tesla's long-term success. The\ncompany has no replacements for its increasingly antiquated Models S, X, 3, or\nY, and it recently canceled plans for a $25,000 Model 2 EV. Instead, Musk has\ndecided to double down on a plan to develop a Tesla robotaxi leveraging the\nFSD system. All new Teslas come with a 30-day trial of FSD, and even at $8,000\nper car, that's a healthy extra slug of cash at a time when the company's\nonce-envied profit margins are shrinking faster than its quarterly deliveries.\n\nTesla will deliver its Q1 2024 financial results tomorrow afternoon.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n333\n\nJonathan M.

Tesla sold people a $15,000 software package that would\nmake the buyer money. In other words, the owner stood to profit because they\ncould pay off the price of the car (which would be marked up) AND the software\nand then keep making money. Few problems here:\n\nHow many people actually want strangers in their car. Go ahead and tell me\nwhat\u2019s in your car right now. Possessions? Keys? Potential weapons? Maybe a\npiece of mail with your address on it? Shit, they don\u2019t really need your\naddress, the car won\u2019t know it\u2019s being followed.\n\nOkay, so take all your stuff out, right? Easy! Now all you have to worry about\nis people damaging your car surreptitiously, the cleaning bills from folks\nthrowing up in it, wearing out the parts of your car faster, extra battery\ndegradation from constant use, accidents, the car being physically trapped,\nmassive increases in liability insurance....and so on.\n\nSo maybe it wasn\u2019t likely for individuals to use it (even though it was sold\nthat way). Maybe it was for fleet operators. Great? They buy a bunch of cars\nwith markup, software licenses with markup, and still make money. Let\u2019s say\nthey spent 100,000 on the car and software. That\u2019s Tesla\u2019s revenue. Say the\ncar cost $65,000 to make, so a profit of $35,000. Now the fleet operator uses\nit and makes $135,000. Now their profit is $35,000. Which means Tesla could\nhave made $70,000 profit if they just ran the taxi themselves. Which they\u2019d\ngive up because....?\n\nThe idea was never smart. If buying and running the taxi can make you money,\nTesla loses money by not running it themselves. I suspect that stunning bit of\nbusiness savvy may be why they pivoted to robotaxi. Though I\u2019m going to laugh\nmy ass off if they make the same mistake and try to sell the vehicles\nthemselves.\n\nApril 22, 2024 at 4:24 pm\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\nToday on War Stories, Ars Technica is joined by Dan Greenawalt, Creative\nDirector of the Forza franchise, who takes us through the colossal potential\n(and many challenges) of utilizing deep neural networks to build sophisticated\nracing AI. Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
