Help you understand the value of writing great customer updates.\n  2. Provide extensively researched examples of customer updates.\n  3. Break down best practices derived from our research into rules you can follow, and\n  4. Offer you some easy-to-use templates.\n\nRemember, you\u2019re already improving your product; you deserve credit for that\nhard work.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n## Why don\u2019t we send customer updates?\n\nI\u2019ve spent many years consulting with product teams in one way or another.\nDespite having been convinced of the value of product updates for some time,\nI\u2019ve been somewhat surprised by how few teams decide to write frequent product\nupdates.\n\nWhen I ask directly I\u2019ve gotten several reasons why teams don\u2019t publish\nproduct updates more frequently, including:\n\n  1. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an existing process to write and format the update.\u201d\n  2. \u201cWe\u2019re already so busy building the product, we don\u2019t have time to publish updates.\u201d\n  3. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a team or person who\u2019s accountable for publishing updates.\u201d\n\nThese are all pretty reasonable, and generally delivered with a straight face\nfrom a sane person.\n\nI have two parallel theories here.\n\nThe first theory is that if you\u2019re not in the habit of doing anything, the\nactivation energy required to start is high.\n\nCompanies of every size, from startups to the largest companies in the world,\nfeel overworked. So the notion of spending 10 hours building and 10 hours\nwriting updates is rejected in favor of 20 hours of building.\n\nMoreover, it can be surprisingly complex to figure out who \u201cowns\u201d this\nprocess. The developers are most familiar with the changes, but are also\nstereotypically the worst at communicating with customers. The marketing team\nis great at talking to customers, but might not have the full story on the\nchanges that are happening.\n\nThere\u2019s definitely a team effort involved which gets way easier once the\nprocess is in motion.\n\nThe second theory is that most teams dramatically underestimate the value of\nwhat great customer updates can do for them.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about that.\n\n## Why should we send customer updates?\n\nBy the way\u2014if you're overwhelmed by trying to write these frequent, churn\nreducing, upsell inducing customer updates while also running your business...\nChangebot can do this for you automatically.\n\nclick here to get started\n\nor sign up for email updates.\n\nJust like a customer reading your product update, you want to know: \u201cWhat\u2019s it\nin for me? How does following this make my business better?\u201d\n\nAwesome customer updates benefit your business by:\n\n  * Preventing churn\n  * Increasing new customers\n  * Boosting expansion revenue\n  * Setting up for a price increase\n  * Building trust\n  * Earning referrals and testimonials\n\n### Preventing churn\n\nGreat customer updates prevent churn in two key ways.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s easy to toil away on the product without updating your customers.\nYou might reason that if you\u2019re going to spend 10 hours improving the product,\nand 10 hours writing an update, it\u2019d be better spending 20 hours improving the\nproduct.\n\nWrong!\n\n(Actually, doubly so, as writing customer updates should be fast. We\u2019ll cover\nthat later.)\n\nYou need to get credit for your code. Without updates, customers cannot see\nyour hard effort, and most products appear to stagnate. Getting frequent\ncustomer updates does triple duty: it shows that your team is hard at work, it\nshows that you\u2019re always delivering more customer value, and it shows that\nyour team is thoughtful and customer-focused.\n\nConsider this from your customer\u2019s perspective.\n\nSay you\u2019re a business that has two software subscriptions billed monthly, both\nare right on the edge of how much you\u2019d like to pay a la Van Westendorp\u2019s\nPrice Sensitivity Meter where \u201cthe price is starting to get expensive, but you\nwould still purchase the product.\u201d\n\nOne company sends weekly updates with new features, changes, and ways that\npeople are using their product to make more money.\n\nThe second company sends nothing.\n\nWhich product is more likely to get cut when the budget tightens?\n\nI\u2019ve heard this line directly from customers: every monthly invoice is a\ndecision on whether they should churn. Most subscription products auto-renew.\nDon\u2019t mistake that to mean staying is the presumptive choice for every\ncustomer.\n\nYou\u2019ll be right until the moment you\u2019re wrong, and then they\u2019re gone.\n\nYou must strive to win your customers' business with every invoice and never\ntake them for granted. Frequent customer updates are our way of showing\ncustomers that they are important to us.\n\nAlso, It turns out that small, frequent updates appeal to investors too!\n\nShaan Puri on portfolio company updates.\n\n### Increasing new customers\n\nMany businesses mistakenly think that only existing customers are interested\nin product updates.\n\nThis misconception is self-reinforcing since many businesses hide product\nupdates behind a login screen, and new customers never see them.\n\nThe reality is that many potential customers will review the past customer\nupdates to gauge whether the product is stagnating or improving.\n\nAfter an extended sales process, a large customer I was courting chose a\ncompetitor. Since I had formed a strong working relationship with this\ncompany, they were willing to share their \u201cconsiderations spreadsheet\u201d with\nme. The spreadsheet captured all of the reasons they went with our competitor.\n\nThis was eye-opening on a few fronts. Notably, one item stood out: the number\nof product updates last quarter. Ours was at zero \u2013 not because we hadn\u2019t made\nany updates, but because they couldn\u2019t find them on our blog.\n\nIt felt awful reading this because we had published updates to our customers\nover this timeline, but there wasn\u2019t any way for their team to find them. We\nwere marked with a big \u201cX\u201d \u2013 not even a zero, but an \u201cX\u201d.\u201d\n\nHowever, there are two silver linings.\n\nFirst, since prospective customers aren't using the product and may not\nunderstand the significance of each update, their evaluation is binary. \u201cDoes\nthe company we\u2019re considering have frequent updates, yes or no?\u201d\n\nThis means that you can get into the \u201cyes\u201d column by simply showing up.\n\nSecond, once you establish a reputation for frequent updates, this becomes a\npotent selling point. Ensure that anyone speaking to leads or trials\nemphasizes your commitment to frequent updates; it will differentiate you!\n\nThough it\u2019s not really my style, if you\u2019re aware of a competitor consistently\nfailing to update their customers, you could use this to your advantage.\n\nYou always hear stories like \u201cworse product but better marketing, so they won\nthe market.\u201d\n\nFrequent customer updates are a big part of that marketing advantage.\n\n### Boosting expansion revenue\n\n\u201cAs the complexity of a product increases, the proportion of customers\nfamiliar with all of its features decreases.\u201d - Sierakowski\u2019s Law.\n\nPut another way, the more effort you put into your product, the harder you\nmust work to educate customers about it.\n\nIf you really want your eyes opened on this I\u2019d recommend conducting\nsynchronous cancellation calls (as opposed to self serve/email cancellation).\nSimply ask, \u201cWhy are you leaving?\u201d and/or \u201cIs there anything we could have\ndone to keep you?\u201d\n\nThe number of customers who could have been retained had they known about a\nspecific feature \u2013 one that you indeed offer \u2013 is maddening.\n\nThis happened to me all the time at Baremetrics:\n\n> Me: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry we couldn\u2019t meet your needs. To help us improve our\n> product for future customers, is there anything we could have done to keep\n> your business?\u201d\n>\n> Ex-Customer: \u201cYeah, no worries, we\u2019ve found a product that works better for\n> us. We would have loved to have stayed but we needed a product that\n> supported custom dashboards.\u201d\n>\n> Me: \u201cOh, wild. We actually do offer custom dashboards!\u201d\n>\n> Ex-Customer: \u201cOh, weird! Haha. We would have stayed if we would have known\n> that.\u201d\n>\n> Me: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s wild you left because you thought we didn\u2019t have that.\u201d\n>\n> Ex-Customer: \u201cYeah, hahaha, wild.\u201d\n>\n> Me: \u201c...\u201d\n>\n> Ex-Customer: \u201c......\u201d\n>\n> Me: \u201cWell, thanks for your time!\u201d\n\nThis dialogue highlights a significant oversight: the assumption that\ncustomers are aware of the entire product. If a customer isn\u2019t using a\nspecific feature we assume they know about it, but just don\u2019t want it.\n\nThis is particularly true for add-on features, or those that are exclusive to\nhigher-tier plans. With add-ons \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d it\u2019s very likely\nthat your customers are simply unaware these features exist.\n\nFrequent customer updates can bring these features to light. Below, in the\nresearch section, we explore various techniques to maximize expansion revenue\nthrough customer updates, including:\n\n  1. Finding new ways to talk about add-on features, repeatedly.\n  2. Clearly stating feature availability, for example, \u201cavailable to business plan customers and above\u201d or \u201cfor users of our commerce hub add-on.\u201d\n  3. Providing space for persistent reminders, such as, keeping an add-on feature on the \"what's new\" page for several months after launch.\n\nIn short, great customer updates tell your customer when add-on features are\navailable, remind them they exist, and keep those items top of mind when\nthey\u2019re ready to upgrade.\n\n### Setting up for a price increase\n\nPrice increases are an often inevitable aspect of running a business.\n\nManaging a company is challenging, and the likelihood that you nailed your\npricing in those early tumultuous days is slim.\n\nEven if you were successful in picking the right price, external factors like\ninflation and internal factors such as expanding expenses are likely to\nrequire adjustments.\n\nWhile your expenses in year one were a $5 Heroku dyno and a $7.99/year domain,\nyou might find yourself in year five with a 20-person team, a $160k per month\nsalary expense, an $80k per month cloud bill, and a $7.99 domain.\n\nWhen all other options are exhausted and you realize a price increase is\nnecessary, best practices dictate transparent communication with customers.\nThis involves outlining the forthcoming changes with your customers,\nemphasizing the improvements made over the past five years in order to justify\nthe increase.\n\n14 seconds after this email goes out you will get a spike of traffic as\ncustomers beeline towards whatever list of product updates you have available\nto decide for themselves. Woe be upon anyone who decided not to frequently\nupdate this list.\n\nPerson who did not update their changelog before emailing customers about a\nprice increase\n\nIf customers visit the update log and see that there\u2019s only seven updates\nspread across the past three years\u2013you\u2019re in trouble.\n\nI\u2019ve been there. I know the feeling of being so overwhelmed by a massive\nfeature and bug backlog that you devote 100% of the team\u2019s time to tackling\nit. Know that if you do this you\u2019re opening yourself for a gigantic pain when\nits price increase season.\n\nNow let\u2019s totally change perspective.\n\nImagine yourself as the customer who\u2019s receiving the price increase update\nemail in this scenario.\n\nYou get the price increase email. It is well-crafted and includes\njustifications, but you want to see these justifications with your own eyes.\nYou go to the customer update log and scroll back to three years ago, the date\nwhen you became a customer.\n\nYou see how many posts are ahead of you, they\u2019ve done one a week for the past\nthree years, 156 updates since you started paying for the product.\n\nYou can be annoyed, and you can also determine that the price is just too much\nfor the value you get, but no one can start to make the argument that that\ncompany hasn\u2019t been extremely busy, wholly focused on making the product\nbetter for their customers.\n\nThis is the experience we\u2019re looking to create for our customers should we\never need to increase our prices.\n\n### Building Trust\n\nTrust is a simple but powerful outcome of frequent updates.\n\nPeople are wary of strangers, but tend to trust those they hear from\nfrequently. In entertainment, for example, viewers of Twitch streamers often\nbegin to think they\u2019re friends with them.\n\nMy advice is to strive for regular communication without getting your\ncustomers to fall in love with you. If you can avoid it.\n\nBuilding trust opens the door to two-way communication, a vital asset. If\nyou\u2019ve ever tried to speak to a customer who hasn\u2019t been contacted in a long\ntime, it can be challenging to get anything back from them at all.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit shocking when you experience this first hand. Once, after a\nprolonged silence, I sent a simple three question survey to over 100k active\ncustomers, and only received 14 responses.\n\nWhen I ran TeamPassword, I sent out similar surveys. Our list was much\nsmaller, but because I was actively in touch with most customers our surveys\nwould get opened by 30% of recipients, completed by 90% of the people who\nstarted them, and 50% of the respondents responded \u201cyes\u201d to \u201cmay we follow up\nwith you for more information?\u201d\n\nWhen customers hear from you frequently, they\u2019re less likely to think there\u2019s\na hidden agenda. They might even reach out to you first, or at least be more\nreceptive when you ask for product feedback, check in with an account review,\nor casually inquire if a new add-on might be something they\u2019d find useful.\n\n### Earning referrals and testimonials\n\nSending frequent updates starts a conversation. Each customer interaction is a\nlottery ticket, and the jackpot is them responding: \u201cThis is great!\u201d\n\nCompanies invest significant time and money in obtaining testimonials,\nreviews, and referrals because these elements are highly valuable, making the\neffort worthwhile.\n\nHaving a customer respond to an update positively is the difference between\ninbound and outbound sales. Occasionally, a customer\u2019s note is comprehensive\nenough to screenshot it and feature it on your marketing site (with their\npermission).\n\nAt other times you might be able to get to that full testimonial with a few\nfollow-up questions.\n\nThis process is much easier than collecting customer quotes through an\noutbound approach.\n\nWith positive sentiment coming in from your customers, referrals and reviews\nare just an ask away. Great reviews and referrals exist in a funnel; only a\nsmall percentage of customers will write a positive note, and only a fraction\nof those wlll follow through with a testimonial.\n\nThat\u2019s OK; maintaining open communication is valuable itself. However, I\u2019ve\nnever seen this level of interaction fail to result in referrals and\ntestimonials, so hopefully, that motivates you to keep the updates coming.\n\n## The Research: Examples in the wild\n\nBy the way\u2014if you're overwhelmed by trying to write these frequent, churn\nreducing, upsell inducing customer updates while also running your business...\nChangebot can do this for you automatically.\n\nclick here to get started\n\nor sign up for email updates.\n\nI scoured the internet through both space and time to find both the best and\nworst practices, from the fortune 500 to indie hackers. Below is a summary of\nmy research notes so you can see (and draw your own conclusion) about the best\ncustomer update practices and tactics.\n\nResearched Companies:\n\n  * Slack\n  * Trello\n  * Github\n  * Basecamp\n  * Mailchimp\n  * HubSpot\n  * Baremetrics\n\n### Slack\n\nSlack is perhaps THE customer update OG. I decided to jump into the wayback\nmachine to see how they got on the path of solid customer updates.\n\nHere\u2019s a fairly typical update from March 2018:\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like here.\n\nThe updates are clear and concise, with a lot of links for people who want to\nread more (hint: basically no one wants to read more.) Being concise is\ngenerally preferred by customers, and it's less work for us to do! Win win.\n\nAs a matter of style the language matches their brand, ala \u201cQuicker\nswitcheroos,\u201d making the updates feel relevant. This doesn\u2019t mean that your\nupdates should be cheeky, in fact it\u2019s a bit cringe when a serious brand tries\nto be fun, but it is a best practice observed in the best updates to make sure\nthe language you use in the updates matches your brand.\n\nSerious updates are fine for serious companies, I don\u2019t want an update from my\ndoctor that my \u201cpanky is all inflamoed.\u201d\n\nSlack is not afraid to promote boring updates which is a rare but powerful\nstrength. One of the reasons why Slack has pages of updates every month is\nthat they\u2019re not afraid to take credit for their work.\n\n\u201cAdmin can delete private channels\u201d actually sounds like it could have been a\nbug (or at least an oversight,) but that\u2019s no reason not to share the update.\nThe people who are impacted by this change will be thrilled to read the\nupdate, the people who don\u2019t care will skim past.\n\nThe outcomes for promoting boring updates are either excitement that you made\nthe product better for them or basic appreciation that you\u2019re generally making\nthe product better. The only way to lose is to say nothing (which is what most\nteams do.)\n\nSlack is also not afraid to share bad news in updates, consider this note from\nthe may 2018 update:\n\nIf you don\u2019t remember this was a big deal at the time, and people were pretty\nupset! Slack had the option to put this update outside of the normal stream,\nor, not say anything at all. But including this bad news allowed them to get\nahead of the conversation by explaining their reasoning, and heading off the\nbiggest area of real concern: accessibility.\n\nAs a running theme, turning things off and removing features is also work, so\nif you truly have the conviction that this is best for your customer or your\nbusiness, take credit for that work too. Removing IRC gateways from Slack\ninfuriated many nerds at the time, but I\u2019m willing to bet exactly zero people\nremember this, and they seem to have done pretty well subsequently.\n\nSlack also excels by having a persistent location to keep track of wins on a\nschedule. When you visit their releases page (https://slack.com/releases) they\nshow the latest product updates chronologically, but support their biggest\ncustomer benefits directly below:\n\nBecause our goal is to have frequent updates we can\u2019t be sure that our most\nrecent updates cover all of the major benefits we provide to customers. Having\na hard-coded benefits section in the same place where a potential customer\nmight review product updates ensures that you have your bases covered, it\u2019s\nthe multi-vitamin of benefits focused language.\n\nWhile I think basically everyone could do a better job at connecting the dots\nfrom feature releases to customer benefit, having a relatively static section\nlike the one above makes sure you always have a foundation to work off of.\n\n### Trello\n\nInstead of focusing on individual releases Trello tends to keep their schedule\nby rolling up posts which feature new improvements alongside old improvements.\nWhile this can make it difficult to see what\u2019s new at a glance, it has the\nintended effect of seeing a large number of what seem like very large features\nevery time you visit the product page on their blog.\n\nTrello shows off a powerful technique, featuring popular posts, at the top of\ntheir product page:\n\nThey still have posts sorted by most recent below, however having popular\nposts up top make sure that everyone visiting this page is always hit by the\n\u201cbest of.\u201d This is particularly powerful for prospects, Trello puts their best\nfoot forward in public for any potential customers considering the product.\n\nLet\u2019s do a deeper dive on the \u201cAdvanced Checklists\u201d roll up post.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Trello\u2019s goal is to be comprehensive. Because they\u2019re bringing up\ndifferent checklist use cases and all the associated features they provide a\nvery three dimensional view on what it\u2019s like using checklists in Trello. This\nalso has the added benefit of making the post customer focused since it only\nexists to help their customers make their way around this feature set,\nsupported by customer quotes.\n\nI also love their strategy of adding clarity by focusing on a specific user\ntype. I barely use checklists in Trello, I\u2019d skip this post. Knowing that only\nthe diehard checklist users will be reading the post allows them to go deep\ninto the topic, spending more time going deep into the specifics:\n\nIf your goal is to get every update out to every customer you have to\nappreciate that most users are not going to geek out over a niche feature like\nchecklist task automations. Focusing on a specific user type lets you go deep,\npresenting each nuance in full detail.\n\nA hugely winning strategy from this section is including customer quotes.\nHaving a quote from a customer means two things. First, the feature being\ndescribed actually solved a real problem in the world. Second, it proves that\nsomeone cares enough to write a quote.\n\nThe more you can defer to customer quotes the better, they\u2019re the ones that\nmatter. And it might even be less work for you if they proactively write the\nquote... but more often than not you\u2019ll need to craft or edit the quote as\nthey did (spy the usage of ...\u2019s in their quotes.)\n\nI have no evidence, but I suspect that this quote was either cherry picked or\nco-created given the inclusion of the last line \u201cX feature has been the\nbiggest upgrade to Trello for me in a long time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d guess that one of the major reasons for churn and general customer\nsatisfaction is that \u201cTrello hasn\u2019t been upgraded in forever.\u201d This quote arms\nthe team with a bit of backup against that point. </conjecture>\n\nLightning round:\n\n  * They build clarity via a modified bottom line up front, they\u2019re super clear on what makes them \u201cadvanced checklists\u201d at the beginning of the article.\n  * Great \u201cyou\u201d language. For example \u201cview all of your work in one place\u201d and \u201cGet more done by changing your POV.\u201d\n  * They feature both being precise and highlight specific benefits by specifying who gets access to what feature. Trello has a large number of different plans, they include inline which plan gets which feature.\n  * They dip into being multimedia and increase clarity by providing plentiful product pictures which pervade the post.\n\nTrello\u2019s approach is great to wow current and potential customers who visit\nthe product updates page. Everything is so well crafted and deliberate.\n\nThat obviously comes at the cost of needing to spend a good amount of time and\neffort writing these posts.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of style, this post begins with a quote from the\nbook \u201cThe Checklist Manifesto.\u201d I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s words well\nspent, serving as a counter example of being concise and relevant.\n\nIf the person is digging into a 5 minute read on your checklist features I\nthink this space would be much better used including the benefit by explaining\nhow much time or money is made / saved using great checklists.\n\nThe benefit in the form of a business bottom line is implied, but they never\ntake the last step. I\u2019ll give two examples:\n\nHere we\u2019re presenting the feature of being able to copy / paste checklists.\nThey broach the topic: \u201ccreate them, save them (same thing), and use them\nrepeatedly to decrease your workload\u201d but I\u2019d love to take the last step to a\nbenefit, how much time?\n\nAnd I\u2019ll bet businesses get other benefits like accuracy\u2014how many times have\nyou created a checklist for a new project and left out a critical step? The\nbest case result is that you\u2019re embarrassed, the worst case result is losing a\ncustomer.\n\nUse advanced checklists, save time, save customers, stay cool. Coca cola.\n\nOne more example:\n\nThis is SO CLOSE.\n\nWe have an easy to understand feature and a raving customer quote. Just take\nthe extra moment to be like \u201cwhat was the cost of not having all these tasks\nin one place?\u201d What direct benefit do I get as a customer by using this\nfeature?\n\nBeyond just being frustrating I\u2019ll bet the customer spent way more time\ngetting through their checklists, slowing down production and billable hours,\nespecially if a critical task waiting for their approval sits in limbo.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly a benefit to the business that could have been promoted.\n\n### Github\n\nGithub is no stranger to detailed customer updates, especially in the era of\nAI.\n\nBecause Github sells primarily to developers, we see a new tactic in their\nproduct update \u201cGitHub Copilot Chat now generally available for organizations\nand individuals\u201d: \u201ccustomer language\u201d in the form of quotes from their\ndevelopment team.\n\nAs you can see this is a serious quote, two full paragraphs from a very senior\nengineer at Github, with a specific real world scenario. Since Github sells to\nand is used by engineers, this stands in for a customer quote in a pretty\ncompelling way.\n\nOf the 1,000 words in the update, almost 600 are directly from their\ndevelopers.\n\nThis is specifically a good approach for Github, but also generally good to\nget a quote from your development team. One benefit in frequent, detailed\ncustomer updates is building trust. It\u2019s really hard to trust someone you\nnever hear from, and hearing directly from the development team further builds\nthat trust.\n\nIt\u2019s like when the chef of a fancy restaurant comes out to talk to you.\n\nGithub also embraces being multimedia by including a video of the update as\nwell since this was announced at their conference, they smartly included a 10\nminute clip during the announcement:\n\nWhile adding a considerable amount of work to the update, I do like providing\nthe option for the people who prefer video, and for the distribution. This\nvideo is on YouTube with 81k views, and comments are open allowing them to get\nmessages like this:\n\nThey could farm these comments for customer quotes, and since it\u2019s YouTube\nthere\u2019s also plenty of complaints they could use to make some improvements.\n\nA few final notes on Github:\n\n  * When talking about tech they increase clarity by addressing the common questions up front. For example, they specify that copilot chat is powered by GPT-4, which is a phrase likely everyone who\u2019s familiar with copilot will understand, and, one that most people would be happy with. (of course with consideration to the wide array of opinions on AI technologies, no one is happy about everything.)\n  * Outside of this one post Github is on a schedule, constantly updating their blog with product updates and developments from the field, averaging 3-4 updates a month!\n  * I was surprised they weren\u2019t explicit on customer benefits, AI tools for developers are prime to say \u201cyour company will save X money, Y time, and get through your backlog X00% faster.\u201d They hit on it in the video \u201cEven adding a small feature can take hours out of your day.\u201d\n\nThis last point of not taking the final step to customer benefit is extremely\ncommon and drives me a bit crazy. I think to myself as companies release\nfeature updates \u201cwhat was the point of building this? How does this make our\nbusiness stronger? Why are we here?\u201d\n\nPerhaps Github specifically avoids this language because developers hate being\n\u201csold\u201d to, but there\u2019s plenty of room for Github to walk up to that line.\n\n### Basecamp\n\nBasecamp has made a name for themselves by constantly innovating on \u201cthe\nformat\u201d (for whichever \u201cformat\u201d you can imagine.)\n\nThe way that they provide customer updates is no different.\n\nThey don\u2019t really do product updates in the way that we can compare apples to\napples, but they do so much right that I wanted to include their approach in\nmy research anyway.\n\nTo start, they have a public page fotemr all their features,\nhttps://basecamp.com/features, which includes an intelligently organized and\nprioritized set of features, interspersed with customer testimonials:\n\nLots to love here, the copy is clear and concise (\u201cproject management\u2019s\ngreatest hits\u201d,) multimedia via large product screenshots, and each link takes\nyou to a larger, sometimes annotated screenshots:\n\nBeautiful drop shadow courtesy of Basecamp.\n\nThe closest thing Basecamp has to a traditional changelog of customer updates\nis their \u201cnew\u201d page, https://basecamp.com/new, which features large,\nbeautiful, annotated screenshots of all the updates Basecamp has made over the\npast year:\n\nThis is a fairly brilliant approach, instead of posting constant feature\nupdates, they\u2019ve created a structure where every time you want to see what\nfeatures are new, they get to take credit for all feature development over the\npast year.\n\nI wish I would have taken a screenshot when this was \u201cNEW for 2023,\u201d but I\nthink that this is the overall feature recap for their newest version of\nBasecamp (\u201cBasecamp 4.\u201d)\n\nSince there\u2019s no timestamping the reader is free to infer whatever they want,\nand one of those readings would be \u201cthis is all new functionality as of 2024.\u201d\n\nThis is probably the best optimized page I\u2019ve reviewed so far at giving a\nprospective customer that sense of wow that Basecamp is really turning out\nmeaningful product improvements quickly.\n\nThere\u2019s not much more here that conforms to the rest of my research such that\nI can categorize their approach into categories, other than to say that\nthey\u2019ve done something very cool, that very much works for 37signals, and\nperhaps has some transferable principles for the rest of us.\n\nI can see two downsides to this approach, first there\u2019s a lot more room to be\nmore clear about customer benefits on each feature, and second this approach\nloses the sense of schedule for people to be able to stay up to speed with the\nlatest feature.\n\nThe first note is a recurring theme, my position is that basically everyone\ncan do a better job of connecting that last step to customer benefits. For\nexample, Basecamp says the following about their todo lists on their features\npage:\n\nThis copy is super strong (I tried to pick a good one!) but I\u2019m not sure that\n\u201csleep well knowing it\u2019ll get done\u201d walks us all the way to the benefit.\n\nPerhaps I picked too good of an example, but I imagine that small businesses\nlose tons of time, money, reputation, and customers all to the root cause of\nballs getting dropped.\n\nWith a project management tool I\u2019d love to see the impact on project\ncompletion with this and every other feature, presenting some version of\nproducts getting done more quickly with fewer people with happier customers\nseems like a direct way to let these features speak to how they benefit the\nbottom line.\n\nOn the second point (not establishing a schedule): they also don\u2019t post to a\nBasecamp twitter account instead favoring their 37signals account. This\nprovides some cool upside that they can post about features that tie all of\ntheir products together, but if you\u2019re considering buying basecamp and want to\nsee what the last three months has looked like from a development perspective,\nit might be hard to figure that out.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine they\u2019ve tested this and realized that they can put all\nthe week over week effort they\u2019d put into having regular customer updates and\nspend that time once on a polished, beautiful, descriptive page that they only\nneed to update once a major release.\n\nGiven how unique and beautiful the combination of the \u201cfeatures\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d\npages are it's hard to argue with the overall effect they\u2019ve created, and it's\njust as challenging to recommend emulating.\n\nIt\u2019s uniquely 37signals in style and substance, which prompts the question:\nwhat\u2019s the \u201cuniquely you\u201d way to keep your customers in the loop?\n\n### Mailchimp\n\nMailchimp runs some of the greatest hits that we\u2019ve seen so far while also\nadding a few extra bananas.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with their big, beautiful \u201cWhat's new\u201d page which serves as their\nentry point to learn about their product updates:\n\nThe button labeled \u201cTry new features now\u201d takes you right to the login page:\n\nThis got a laugh out of me the first time I clicked it. My expectation was\nthat I\u2019d get more details on new features... but they\u2019re right! I\u2019m not sure\nwhat I expected, but if I want to \u201ctry new features now\u201d logging in would be\nthe way to do it.\n\nPerhaps eclipsing that was my experience on clicking on the following CTA for\n\u201cDraft emails with AI\u201d:\n\nGuess where the \"Draft emails with AI\" button goes?\n\nDid you guess... the pricing page?\n\nResearching Mailchimp reset my thought process on being direct and conversion\noptimized. Why was it my expectation that there should be steps in between\n\u201chere is the feature\u201d and just straight up using the feature, either by\nlogging in or signing up.\n\nIf Mailchimp, a marketing automation company with near infinite incentive to\ncreate marketing content funnels you right to the login / sign up page, we\nshould take notice.\n\nMailchimp's \u201cwhat\u2019s new\u201d page also features (haha) a few other great\nmultimedia touches:\n\n  * Large, well designed screenshots\n  * A video overview for the entire page\n  * A lot of \u201cyou\u201d language, like \u201cRespond to customer and client inquiries 1-to-1 in your Mailchimp Inbox\u201d and \u201cLet AI help generate emails and automations to welcome new customers, recover abandoned carts, and promote new products. You only need to review and send!\u201d\n\nOne tactic that I\u2019m not sure about is \u201cComing Soon\u201d features:\n\nOf the nine feature headers on the What\u2019s New page, three of them are marked\nas coming soon.\n\nMy personal preference would be zero. Showing coming soon is a double edged\nsword.\n\nIt\u2019s great that they\u2019re providing a public view into the roadmap, however,\ntrying to sell more than what\u2019s in the product today can lead to heartbreak\n(when someone inevitably doesn\u2019t read the \u201ccoming soon\u201d part), or can cause\npeople to second guess\u2014should I wait until they have this new feature I really\nwant now that I read it? Should I see if any of their competitors have this\nfeature that I can use today?\n\nThis needs more research but my assumption is that very few people will say\n\u201cthere\u2019s more features being added eventually? I\u2019ll sign up today!\u201d\n\nSwitching gears, let\u2019s take a look at a more traditional product update, this\nis Mailchimp\u2019s fall release 2020 update.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of the comprehensive update style, I especially like the\nmultimedia style with a video up top which supports the detailed sections\nbelow:\n\nThis is a nine minute video featuring their chief product officer and other\nexecs within the company, showing how important customer updates are to them.\n\nThis is perhaps one of the strongest examples of a company showing through\neffort and attendance that the product updates the company is pushing is front\nand center to the leadership team.\n\nThe video also covers a rare product update tenant, which is covering the why\nbehind these new features. This gets bonus points because it\u2019s also directly\nadjacent to what business benefit a customer would get from using the new\nfeatures.\n\nMailchimp\u2019s overall goal is to make your marketing more effective, which\nprovides a direct path for potential customers to understand how using\nMailchimp makes you more money.\n\nThe video also speaks to their different user types between small business\nowners, marketers, and developers.\n\nEach of the feature sections have some great \u201cyou\u201d language in addition to\nlinks which take you to more details on each feature (which was my initial\nexpectation on the What\u2019s New page):\n\nOverall a strong update. Light on specific customer benefits (how does this\nmake us more money, how much more money does this make us?), but provides a\nconcise description of what the company built and how it\u2019s used by customers,\nusually with an accompanying screenshot.\n\nIn all my research I\u2019ve been left wanting for more focus on the business\nimpact of feature development, but their video is as close to being direct on\nthis point as I\u2019ve seen.\n\n### HubSpot\n\nHubSpot has been credited with inventing (or at least popularizing (but I\nthink they invented)) content marketing, and as such their website includes\nthousands of tactical posts ranging from how-to content, basic 101 style\ncontent, advanced tips, and of course product specific items.\n\nDid HubSpot invented the flywheel?\n\nHubSpot\u2019s customer updates start with their \u201cwhat\u2019s new\u201d page which shows\n(what appears to be) a chronological recap of their most recent three major\nfeatures.\n\nI love the layout they\u2019ve used. Focusing on three major updates helps focus\nthe current or potential customer coming to this page. Breaking each feature\ndown into a title, short description, screenshot, long description, and a\n\u201clearn more\u201d link is a fantastic structure which we\u2019ll come back around to in\nour templates section.\n\nThe overall effect is impressive, but, this is not an overwhelming amount of\nwork for each feature release, finding that beautiful middle ground of\nimpressive looking, fast and easy to do, and highly converting.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why \u201cTikTok Integration\u201d is a different color and adorned with\nsparkles. I\u2019m guessing that this is their way of having a main or featured\nupdate of the three. Feels like overkill to me unless these are truly the\nthree most recent updates and not curated. Three is curated enough!\n\nOne other note of interest: two of the three items (Webflow and TikTok) are\nintegrations! They have no fear of promoting the \u201cboring\u201d stuff. It also seems\nthat the Webflow app is in the Hubspot app marketplace, meaning the Webflow\nteam built it.\n\nThis is a challenging play to recreate, but if you can ever find a way to get\nanother business to build on top of your product, you promoting that work is\nwin/win.\n\nThe company who built the integration gets eyes to the addon / app / content\nthey created, you get the benefit of whatever they built plus customer update\ncredit.\n\nCommerceHub, the third \u201cwhat\u2019s new\u201d item, is the newest \u201chub\u201d in HubSpot. If\nyou\u2019re not familiar with HubSpot the way they\u2019ve decided to keep a sense of\nsanity while trying to build around every department is breaking the product\nup into \u201chubs\u201d.\n\nThe most popular hub is the marketing hub, which does all the stuff you\nprobably think of HubSpot to do, landing pages and campaigns and whatnot. They\nalso have a sales hub which is their CRM.\n\nThis lesson on HubSpot to underscore that a new hub is not a small amount of\nwork, my outsider analysis is that the structure of the what\u2019s new page might\nbe one feature a \u201cpartner\u201d has created, one feature that we\u2019ve created, and\nthen the most recent hub or other major section of the app we want to push.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that this is one of the most recent features they\u2019ve pushed\nbecause it\u2019s quite a bit larger than a feature (ie, there\u2019s lots of\nfunctionality within the commerce hub that could be promoted,) and that they\nwere doing events around commerce hub ~4 months prior.\n\nUnrelated, here\u2019s a screenshot that I found researching commerce hub that I\nthink everyone who\u2019s ever spoken to a customer will feel:\n\nYes HubSpot, when will this simple feature be added?\n\nHubs are also a source of expansion revenue, so that could be a part of the\nanalysis of how they construct their \u2018what\u2019s new\u2019 list.\n\nBelow the fold is the \u201cwhat\u2019s new\u201d section there\u2019s a section for \u201crelease\nmaterials\u201d where we can dive into a traditional customer product update.\n\nFor further analysis we\u2019ll dive into the \u201cNovember 2023 Release Notes.\u201d\n\nOff the bat the list of changes is huge.\n\nI count 43 updates across 12 sections (mostly organized by hubs, but some that\nfall outside like mobile, app marketplace, and multi-hub updates.) This\nhappens on schedule every month, so the impact snowballs over time.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to wow a customer or a prospect to show that your team is\nhard at work improving the product, 43 updates a month, every month is a great\nplace to start.\n\nHypothetically if you\u2019re frustrated that Hubspot hasn\u2019t added 28 day billing\ncycles to the commerce hub? Well, it\u2019s not like they aren\u2019t doing anything!\nEven though that\u2019s a simple feature request...\n\nHow do they get so many updates? They don\u2019t ignore boring updates.\n\nThey do a good job of providing a concise update on each new feature, and\nsince HubSpot has many plan tiers they\u2019re explicit about who gets access to\nwhich new feature.\n\nOn the downside.. This list doesn\u2019t feel prioritized and isn\u2019t written with\n\u201cyou\u201d language. For example, this is the first update:\n\n\u201cHubSpot has rolled out an update to our integration with Facebook's\nConversions API. The Conversions API is designed to create a direct connection\nbetween your marketing data and the systems which help optimize ad targeting,\ndecrease cost per action and measure results across Meta technologies.\u201d\n\nA good start would be to flip this, start with the fact that this new feature\nwill help you decrease your cost per action while being able to better measure\nresults\u2014get more customers for less money with more confidence! This brings\nthe benefit up front while also using \u201cyou\u201d language.\n\nWith the update being this long they definitely could have gotten many more\nupdates, and perhaps have separate places to see those updates.\n\nThe video is really great\u2014great energy. Super strong way to be multimedia.\n\nHowever, the list of features discussed is different from the post. And we\u2019re\nstill not talking benefits.\n\nThe first update discussed is conditional properties, which allows customers\nto filter one set of attributes based on the selection of another property,\nthe example they gave is that if you set a customers country to Canada, the\nproperty \u201cstate/province\u201d will automatically be set to just Canada.\n\nThis is really cool! But, I think it\u2019d cut through just a bit better if they\nexplained a bit of business value... what was the problem that got them to\nbuild that feature? I\u2019m sure HubSpot customers lose TONS of money because of\nincorrect CRM data!\n\nOverall Hubspot has found a great blend of highlighting their best \u201crecent\u201d\nupdates (even if it\u2019s a few months old) while supporting those cornerstone\nupdates with a HUGE list of monthly updates, presented with text and video.\n\n### Baremetrics\n\nBaremetrics is a saas finance analytics platform best known for having a very\nhandsome CEO from mid 2020 through mid 2023.\n\nSecondary to that Josh Pigford, the founder of Baremetrics invented a number\nof tactics we see used, abused, and debated over today.\n\nThe main principle we see carried through is the idea of radical transparency,\nsharing not just roadmap items, not just feature updates, but the entire state\nof the business, which includes both the ups and the downs and the specific\nfinancial details of the business.\n\nThis makes a bit of sense when you\u2019ve built a platform to show MRR, new\ncustomers, churn rate, etc, but I don\u2019t think most people would say \u201chey...\nlets share all this info with the world.\u201d\n\nNerds continue to debate if this is a good idea to this date, but Baremetrics\nneeds to be included in our analysis of what a great customer update looks\nlike. We\u2019ll take a look at an early product focused customer update, and then\nfor fun we\u2019ll look at a transparency focused customer update.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Baremetrics, New Feature: Customer Profiles.\n\nScreenshot courtesy of the Wayback Machine\n\nThis is one of the oldest feature updates from Baremetrics, dated almost 10\nyears ago. Despite its age we see all the critical pieces of a great customer\nupdate.\n\nThe update is hyper concise, providing an exact screenshot and a clear\ndescription of what features are being added:\n\nJust two sentences to completely cover an entire new section of the product:\n\n1\\. Each customer gets their own individual profile showing you that\ncustomer\u2019s individual LTV and MRR along with social and location information.\n\n2\\. In addition, you can view the entire transaction history of that customer\nfrom signup to charges to failed charges and cancellation.\u201d\n\nThey also do a great job of providing further examples without being\nprescriptive:\n\nThe pattern of showing real world use is fantastic. This is best by taking\nquotes directly from customers, but that takes time and effort, and our goal\nis to get meaningful updates out the door quickly and easily. Using a quote\nfrom an internal team member or \u201cthe company\u201d instead can provide real world\nusage examples while getting the update out quickly.\n\nTo nitpick a customer update from 10 years ago, I\u2019d focus on two things:\n\nFirst, the update has a lot of \u201cwe\u201d language, talking about Baremetrics both\nas the creator of the feature and the user of the feature. If you\u2019re reading\nin order you\u2019ll know that my goal is to include as much \u201cyou\u201d language as\npossible, focusing on the problems your customers are experiencing, and how\nmuch benefit they get out of using the feature.\n\nSecond, the update doesn\u2019t take the last step to business value. For example\nfrom the opening paragraph: \u201cBaremetrics has largely taken a high-level\napproach to your metrics, showing you a 40,000-foot view of how your business\nis doing financially. Today, we\u2019re bringing that view much closer and making\nit much more personal.\u201d\n\nWhy are we doing that? What issues prompted Baremetrics to make this feature?\nAnd to what business impact? In my research the golden formula for a feature\nlike this is [the problem customers had that made us make it], [what we did],\n[business impacts of that feature.]\n\nFor example, If I were to rewrite the opening to the update with these two\npoints in mind, it might look something like:\n\n> \u201cAs a customer of Baremetrics you\u2019ve already been able to see the high level\n> effects of business changes on your metrics, like what a change in pricing\n> does to ARPU or what impact a new feature has on retention.\n>\n> But, we\u2019ve heard from our customers that not every change is so clear from\n> the high level, what happens at the individual customer level has a huge\n> impact on our ability to effectively pilot our business.\n>\n> So today I\u2019m happy to announce customer profiles, the ground level truth on\n> each and every one of your customers, making sure that as you make changes\n> to boost new revenue, create more expansion revenue, and decrease churn that\n> you can track the impact of those changes down to a user level.\n>\n> Anecdotally with the additional information gained from customer profiles we\n> were able to troubleshoot why a specific type of customer left Baremetrics,\n> improving our churn by .5% which will add up to a six figure impact by the\n> end of the year. And it\u2019s just month one!\u201d\n\nSomething like that. I understand that it\u2019s about 250% larger than the\noriginal text, but it\u2019s sort of my move to increase Baremetrics' things by\n250%.\n\nThe point is that we start with a business problem, we discuss quickly how we\nsolved it, then we finish with outcomes. We should use as much \u201cyou\u201d language\nas possible in order to help current and potential customers visualize what\ngiving us a few bucks will yield to them in return.\n\nAs an extra bonus, let\u2019s take a look at the most popular blog post Baremetrics\nhad during my tenure: I Sold Baremetrics.\n\nSince this isn\u2019t a traditional product focused customer update I\u2019ll keep it\nshort here (says the dude writing 10k words on customer updates.)\n\nA few highlights:\n\n  * This post is an example of a great way to provide a major customer update, quickly, in a way that they\u2019ll understand.\n  * He\u2019s very clear on the specifics, including the information that everyone wants to know (eg, how much??)\n  * For a potential bombshell he provides the bottom line up front: I\u2019ve been building this thing for 7 years, I\u2019m selling the business. Also... the title is \u201cI sold Baremetrics.\u201d\n  * The post tells the story in a very honest way (eg \u201cthis rollercoaster reminded me of all the things I don\u2019t love about running a company.\u201d)\n  * He also includes \u201cthe future of Baremetrics\u201d, which in keeping with the theme of this article is the \u201cyou\u201d language people will most want to hear (after the acquisition number)\n\n### Reference companies without complete research\n\nI used (quite a few) more companies in my research, here's a short list of a\nfew of the other companies referenced. If there's interest and requests I'll\nhappily release another round of research with best practices.\n\nHere's that list:\n\n  * WP Engine, see \u201cWP Engine eCommerce Hosting\u2014Now With Stripe Connect!\u201d\n  * Signwell\n  * Dingboard (great example of updates integrated into the product)\n  * Intercom\n  * Transistor\n  * SendSpark\n  * Notion\n  * Sprout Social\n  * OpenAI\n  * CleanShot\n\n## Act 3, The Science of great updates\n\nBy the way\u2014if you're overwhelmed by trying to write these frequent, churn\nreducing, upsell inducing customer updates while also running your business...\nChangebot can do this for you automatically.\n\nclick here to get started\n\nor sign up for email updates.\n\nThrough matrix multiplication of our research set we can generalize a set of\nrules for our customer updates.\n\nThere are two sets of lessons to learn.\n\nFirst, how can we create more customer updates? The goal is to fill the\nchangelog with useful, interesting updates, thus reminding our customers of\nour hard work and fostering dialogue.\n\nSecond, how can we improve the quality of these updates? We want to identify\nthe characteristics that the best updates use to efficiently communicate\nproduct improvements. The goal is to increase the frequency of updates without\nspending more time on them than the product improvements themselves.\n\nAs a reminder, achieving these two goals helps our business by:\n\n  * Preventing churn\n  * Increasing new customers\n  * Boosting expansion revenue\n  * Setting up for a price increase\n  * Building trust\n  * Earning referrals and testimonials\n\n(If you need more convincing on that, re-read the \u201cWhy should we?\u201d section.)\n\nIn order to get all these benefits for our business, we need to frequently\nship great customer updates.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\nThe principles of more updates:\n\n  1. Being on schedule\n  2. Being public\n  3. Being concise\n  4. Including the \u201cboring\u201d stuff\n  5. Including the \u201cbad\u201d news\n  6. Being relevant\n\nThe principles of better updates:\n\n  1. Using \u201cyou\u201d language\n  2. Being multimedia\n  3. Including customer quotes\n  4. Being clear\n  5. Including the benefit\n\n(+ a few bonus tips)\n\n### The principles of more updates\n\nPut simply, most companies do not update their customers enough. The 40th-\npercentile company doesn\u2019t update their customers at all.\n\nProviding any form of regular customer updates places you in the top half of\ncompanies, akin to the way any return on investment positions a VC in the\nupper echelons.\n\nConsider our earlier tweet about investor updates:\n\nTo directly apply it to our domain\n\n  * Updates only when there\u2019s a big issue = mediocre business\n  * No updates = 90% chance of death\n  * Short updates w/ customer benefits = business will succeed\n\nWith this in mind our research identified several techniques used by companies\nsuccessful in maintaining a high velocity of updates.\n\n#### Being on Schedule\n\nIn a high-velocity update environment every decision to publish an update can\nfeel like hitting the brakes. Figuring out the perfect timing for sharing news\nis a double-edged sword.\n\nOn one hand, you\u2019re caught up thinking about the best time to drop an update,\nwhich eats into the actual time you could be polishing the announcement.\n\nOn the other hand, you\u2019re chasing down all the dependencies, like the details\nof the new feature that\u2019s shipping, customer testimonials, or the perfect\nscreenshot. Scrambling for these details last-minute when you\u2019re supposed to\ngo live is not ideal.\n\nHere\u2019s where a little planning goes a long way. Sketching out a timeline in\nyour head \u2013 or a mental Gantt chart, if you will \u2013 helps ensure you\u2019ve got\neverything ready for launch day. .\n\nPlus, sticking to a schedule can actually sharpen your updates, making them\ntighter and more focused. Think of it as borrowing a page from the agile\nplaybook: we tailor our updates to fit the time we've got.\n\nFinally, having a schedule gets you into a rhythm. I swear to you as the\nperson who\u2019s writing thousands of words about customer updates, I would have\nPROMISED you that I was doing updates every two to three weeks for a product I\nwas building.\n\nI would have made an oath to you that was the case. I would have bet a\nsignificant amount of my net worth that I was sticking to that timeline.\n\nBut here\u2019s how it actually went down:\n\nThe timeline was:\n\n  * Aug 24th, Initial intro video\n  * Aug 28th, got my blue belt (unrelated, but pretty cool)\n  * Sept 18th, update one\n  * Oct 25th, update two\n  * Jan 2nd, update three\n\nSince my schedule was \u201cwhen I felt like it\u201d I sent four updates over six\nmonths. This turned out to be almost one update a month, with updates coming\nalmost at the end of every month. Which, in hindsight, sounds like a\nreasonable plan!\n\nBut the reality was more hit or miss, with updates being published\ninconsistently throughout the month, or, sometimes not at all.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve researched customer update best practices I\u2019d handle the\nscheduling of these updates much differently. The main change I would make is\nsetting a schedule to publish an update every two weeks. This is how\nfrequently I thought I was publishing updates before I checked, and the\ndifference in frequency is stark.\n\nThe once every two week schedule would have provided 12 updates to customers\nover this timeline, while my inconsistent schedule only published 4.\n\nDon\u2019t be like me. Set a schedule. Save lives.\n\nA great example of a company that publishes on a schedule is HubSpot. They\nhave an evergreen \u201cwhat\u2019s new\u201d page which features three recent updates, a\nmonthly cumulative release notes blog post, and a monthly presentation shared\npublicly as well.\n\nSprout Social is another great example. They include a monthly view of their\nproduct updates, and a day by day drill down view. I love the commitment to\nshow updates on a monthly cadence, but also keep track of the daily view. This\nshows a huge internal focus on customer communication \u2013 and on shipping! You\ncan\u2019t document thirteen updates in the month of December without product\nupdates being a priority.\n\n#### Being public\n\nAn interesting finding from my research was that many companies didn\u2019t do any\nsort of regular updates. Some were in the habit of weaving product updates\ninto their main blog (totally fine,) but others ONLY published product updates\nto internal customers, either through in app banners, embedded widgets, or\njust via a customer only email list.\n\nThere\u2019s two reasons this happens.\n\nFirst, they make the assumption that only current customers care. Rationally,\nif they\u2019re announcing a certain feature is faster, or some bug is fixed, if\nyou\u2019re not currently using the product why would you care? The potential\ncustomer has no basis for comparison, and probably doesn\u2019t even know why it\u2019s\nimportant that something is fast or that that bug is fixed.\n\n\u201cWhy tell someone that something is better or fixed when they have no basis of\ncomparison?\u201d they ask.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s a self esteem issue. Companies, especially early stage\ncompanies, can be embarrassed they had the issue in the first place. For\nexample, if they improved the performance of some key feature, they think\n\u201cthat means it was too slow in the first place.\u201d A fixed bug promotes the fact\nthat they had the bug in the first place.\n\nThis is of course true.\n\nThese companies are not dumb, announcing that a bug is fixed may alert people\nunaware that the bug existed. This doesn\u2019t mean the company is not completely\nirrational.\n\nThey\u2019re just a bit socially awkward :).\n\nTo address this directly: every product has bugs. Every team ships software\nthat needs to be improved. Most products are more wrong than right at launch.\n\nThe difference between you and the rest of these losers is that your team is\nputting the hard work in to flip the ratio from mostly wrong to mostly right.\n\nA customer who is a normal functioning member of society will be glad to see\nthat the product is faster. They\u2019ll be happy to see that bugs are being fixed,\nespecially if they were affected by it.\n\nWe\u2019re also hyperfocusing on the updates that potentially could be seen as bad\nthings. We also ship improvements! New features! Super powers!\n\nThere\u2019s an art to sharing updates with customers that might not be immediately\nseen as positive, especially by including the benefit (read more below, I\npromise there\u2019s examples of how to turn what seem like bugs into updates\ncustomers will love to read.)\n\nYou also need to accept that some dissatisfied customers will respond\nnegatively to any update.\n\nIf you build a feature other than the one they want, they will complain. If\nyou fix a bug that\u2019s not their main bug, they will complain. If you fix an\nissue that was their biggest concern... they will complain that you didn\u2019t do\nit sooner!\n\nThese are the loudest voices, and I can see why if you\u2019re not committed to\ncustomer updates why this immediate negative interaction would scare you off.\nKeeping the long term view and understanding the benefits of having your\nupdates be public will help you weather the storm.\n\nTo summarize, one of the key reasons to do frequent, well written customer\nupdates is to increase the number of new customers you get. If you don\u2019t share\nthese updates publicly, you\u2019re not getting credit for the hard work your team\nis putting into the product, and you\u2019re not even getting credit for the hard\nwork you\u2019re doing on writing the customer updates.\n\nTo be totally binary, if you aren\u2019t sharing customer updates publicly there\u2019s\nno way to get marketing and sales lift out of customer updates, meaning you\nget zero new customers from these efforts.\n\nGreat examples of being public include... literally every company researched\nin this article. Sorry, it\u2019s really a very good principle, if your updates\naren\u2019t public I\u2019d sort of recommend you do so.\n\nJust for form I\u2019ll give a shout out to Github for the publicness of their\nupdates because they also include internal engineer quotes in their updates,\ngiving further insight into their thought process, and to OpenAI for including\nboth a weekly view into their platform changes AND a look into their internal\npolitics (remember that one time that Sam Altman got kicked out of the\ncompany? That was crazy.)\n\n#### Being concise\n\nThe strongest weapon in the \u201cmore updates\u201d arsenal is being concise.\n\nI fully appreciate the irony of this advice in this delivery mechanism.\n\nAs people who are focused on their craft we feel the urge to create lasting\nstructures. This often means providing context through related information,\nteaching through other examples, and the creation of a meta narrative\u2014making\nour updates into episodes of the series that is our company.\n\nI CLEARLY get that. And, if you can do all of the above while sending customer\nupdates on a weekly basis, go for it. But if you can\u2019t do both, we\u2019ve seen the\nbest of the best strip out the pretense and send simple updates on a regular\nbasis.\n\nHere\u2019s why that extra context might be fluff.\n\nFirst off, only a small percent of people will fully read an update. A\npotential customer might not read the updates AT ALL, but instead just look\nfor the number of updates to answer \u201cis this product maintained?\u201d\n\nSecond, the people who do read it probably don\u2019t need context. See \u201ckeep it\nrelevant\u201d below for more on this. For now just trust me.\n\nThere is some value in reminding people about benefits, we\u2019ll talk about that\nin including the benefit, but do an internal audit and ask \u201cis this fluff?\u201d If\nthe answer is yes, congrats, you found an opportunity for efficiency.\n\nLook at the updates from HubSpot, Sprout Social, and Open AI.\n\nHubSpot:\n\nSprout Social:\n\nOpenAI:\n\nSimple ships.\n\n#### Including the \"boring\" stuff\n\nThe leading reason that companies don\u2019t frequently update their customers is\nthe idea that they didn\u2019t do anything interesting.\n\nThis is a similar mentality of not being public. It\u2019s lacking that touch of\nconfidence that if you decided to work on it, it\u2019s important enough to talk\nabout. If you introspect and realize that truly no one cares and no one\nbenefits from the things you\u2019re working on then it\u2019s truly a remarkable result\nof forcing customer updates that you make better use of your time!\n\nIn reality it\u2019s hard for an improvement that customers experience to be too\nsmall to write about.\n\nPerhaps bumping your ruby version from 3.1.0 up to 3.2.2 might not be\nnoteworthy*, but even the small bug fixes and minor improvements are\nnoteworthy. The goal is to show a constant pulse, the heartbeat of our\nproduct.\n\nWe should take credit for all our work.\n\n(* however, updating to this version of ruby fixed a few security issues,\nclosed dozens of bugs, improved performance, and provided new language\nfeatures for the team to use... sounds pretty material to me! So if a Ruby\nversion bump feels noteworthy, whatever small improvement you made is too.)\n\nThen the question is, how can we make these boring updates newsworthy?\n\nFirst, I just told you they\u2019re not actually boring. Stop that.\n\nWhen Slack wrote in their update \u201cAdmins can delete private channels\u201d, do you\nthink they were thinking \u201coh, this is too boring to include.\u201d\n\nWrong. This stuff matters to our customers, and even if the user reading the\nupdate isn\u2019t specifically impacted they will take note that things are getting\nfixed, and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nSecond, we strip down some of the boredom by choosing our words correctly.\nThis requires us to move past step one and believe internally that this is an\ninteresting update, and in that case \u201cFixed crappy slow code\u201d becomes\n\u201cImproved speed for customers, you should find (activity X) to be much\nquicker, getting you to (benefit) faster than ever before.\u201d\n\nBORING \u274c| Good update \u2705  \n---|---  \nChannel switch feature works correctly| The Quick Switcher got a makeover.\nIt\u2019s quicker and sleeker. And now it helps you switch between channels in\nother workspaces.  \nFixed filter persistence| Improved reliability when switching between views.\nWe\u2019ll no longer forget your filtered settings as you travel from page to page,\nmaking it faster to get from idea to insight.  \nApple integration works| We know how important it is to get accurate reporting\nfrom Apple. We\u2019ve added several layers of checks and have rolled out a new\ndata collection method in order to make sure that when you view your Apple\ndata it\u2019s MORE correct than what you\u2019d get directly from them.  \n  \nI\u2019ve had this conversation many times. Teams don\u2019t want to announce bug fixes,\nespecially if the bug has been around for a while, because you feel like\nyou\u2019re drawing attention to the bug.\n\nFirst off, not looking at the bug does not make the bug go away. Secondly,\nyour customers know about the bug, they reported it.\n\nLastly, they\u2019ll be happy to see it gone!\n\nA great example of boring done right are the updates included from our Slack\nresearch, followed by HubSpot.\n\nYou will be amazed what impact a positive attitude, a bit of copywriting, and\na deadline will do for your ability to ship tons and tons of customer updates.\n\n#### Including the bad news\n\nSimilar to not including \u201cboring\u201d updates, many companies will shy away from\nwhat they think will be received as bad news.\n\nA great example of this from the research is Slack dropping support for IRC\nand XMPP:\n\nYou might not remember this happening, but at the time it was a BIG deal.\nPeople were pretty upset!\n\nSlack had the option to put this update outside of the normal stream, or, not\nsay anything at all.\n\nBut instead they looked at the issue, evaluated their options, made a\ndecision, and then faced it head on. Not only did they make the decision, but\nthe language in their update is unequivocal: the gateways are now closed.\nThere\u2019s no way to read that and not know that it\u2019s GG for IRC.\n\nIncluding this bad news in their standard updates allowed them to get ahead of\nthe conversation by explaining their reasoning (can\u2019t support our features),\nand allowed them to head off the biggest area of real concern: accessibility.\n\nA lot of time we think of our product as a collection of lines of code,\ncollected in a repository and deployed to a server. However our product is\nmuch more than that.\n\nIt\u2019s our goals, it\u2019s the way that we think the world should be, it\u2019s the\nresearch we collect, it\u2019s the taste of the people making the product, and as a\nresult it\u2019s the collection of decisions we make as a team.\n\nWe agonize over these decisions internally, these choices ARE the work, and\nyou should get credit for your work.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit from Jason Fried to increase confidence in your judgment:\n\nKeep it relevant\n\nWriting fewer things is faster than writing more things.\n\nIrrelevant information is a thing that requires writing.\n\nTherefore, Socrates is a dog.\n\nGenerally it\u2019s not the goal of the writer to provide irrelevant information\n(and yet we do.) Generally this is packaged in the format of wanting to\nprovide more context or additional examples.\n\nThere was some class we all took that taught us that we need to provide three\nexamples for everything, and that\u2019s generally what we tend to do in a business\ncontext.\n\nHowever, the strongest updates are just the distilled essence of what benefit\nthe customer is getting, including some AMAZING one line customer updates.\n\nAs an example, the Trello update for the \u201cadvanced checklists\u201d feature set has\na quote from The Checklist Manifesto on why checklists are important.\n\nThis is a great book that I recommend reading, but do we really think that the\npeople who are likely to be interested in \u201cadvanced checklists\u201d don\u2019t already\nknow why they\u2019re important?\n\nQuantity has its own quality. If you\u2019re writing updates frequently you don\u2019t\nhave to fluff by adding quotes, referencing books, or even adding too many\nmemes.\n\nAs an aside: I\u2019ve heard teams say they have \u201cno time to write updates\u201d a\nhundred times. I\u2019ve never once heard \u201cwe don't have time to meme.\u201d\n\nHaving the pulse of relevant updates can be a starting point, there\u2019s always\nthe chance to create rollup updates (more below) or to add some additional\nmedia. Hubspot and Github do a great job including videos with their updates.\n\nGreat examples include the Hubspot monthly updates where they comfortably\nprovide many one line updates in their monthly recaps.\n\nIt\u2019s OK to stay focused.\n\n### The principles of better updates\n\n#### Using \"you\" language\n\nYou\u2019ve seen me refer to \u201cyou\u201d language a lot in this piece.\n\nI thought I made this phrase up, but as I started to dig into the entomology,\nevidently there\u2019s the concept of \u201cI\u201d vs \u201cYou\u201d language in the field of couples\ncounseling... whoops.\n\nIt still makes a ton of sense here, I\u2019m going to roll with it and I\u2019ll talk\nabout the ramifications with my therapist.\n\nAll of the best updates included this \u201cyou\u201d language.\n\nThe features, benefits, and even motivation to build the thing in the first\nplace is based on YOU, the customer, and not \u201cI\u201d, the company / team /\ndeveloper / marketer that did the work.\n\nRemember: the goal is to remind our current customers why they\u2019re paying us\nand to get new customers to sign up. The gold standard is \u201cYOU will now be\nable to do thing X,\u201d or even better \u201cYOU will make more money because you\u2019re\ngetting benefit Y.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s some quick examples to drive the point home.\n\nGreat \u201cyou\u201d language:\n\nTransistor.fm:\n\nSendspark:\n\nIntercom:\n\nEven in this article, see how I\u2019ll say stuff like \u201cmy research, my experience,\nmy companies...\u201d isn\u2019t that annoying? Don\u2019t you just care about how you can\nimprove your business and solve your problems to make more money?\n\nThis is exactly the spirit of \u201cyou\u201d language.\n\n#### Being multimedia\n\nIf you skip this tip because you think it\u2019ll be too time consuming:\nunderstandable, have a great day.\n\nFor those of us interested in going maximum effort mode on updates, going\nbeyond text is a great way to catch a wider audience for your updates, go into\ngreater detail, and frankly to show off.\n\nMost of the big tech companies provide a video update alongside their text\nupdates, so if we want to look a bit bigger than we are we can copy off of\nthem.\n\nI\u2019m personally a fan of video since you can get across a ton of information,\ncontrol the flow (ie, people not skipping around), and you can get across some\nof your personality too.\n\nI generally record a video for each launch and update, you can find all of\nthem on my twitter highlights. Whenever I launch something you\u2019ll see this\ngoofball face staring back at you:\n\nEveryone has their own style, but I like to include some sort of upbeat\nbackground music, a slideshow to keep me on script, and a live demo of\nwhatever I\u2019m showing.\n\nSome people go even further, recording podcast episodes on their updates,\ncreating infographics and charts (which are also nice for the sales /\nmarketing team to share), and the biggest companies throw full on events for\nproduct announcements.\n\nThis is definitely more work and if you\u2019re having troubles getting updates out\nthe door frequently I\u2019d skip this step in a heartbeat. However, if you\u2019ve got\na great update that makes customers want to buy, it\u2019s not a bad idea to go\nmultimedia and squeeze the maximum juice out of it.\n\n#### Include customer language\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for you to say how great an improvement is, but it\u2019s such a\nlarger statement when you have a customer quote in a product update.\n\nIt says two things, first that the thing you did actually helped at least one\ncustomer, AND that the customer cared enough to provide a quote.\n\nIf you\u2019re already doing a good job getting updates out the door, getting these\ncustomer quotes might be easier than you think. When a feature is requested or\na bug is reported, capture the specific words that customer (or lead) says.\n\nWhen you fix it you let that customer know (you do let them know, right?),\ngenerally they\u2019ll respond and let you know if it actually worked or if you\nstill have problems to fix.\n\nIf it\u2019s fixed they might have already gone above and beyond with their\nlanguage, saying \u201cthis is going to make my daily process 5 times faster!!\u201d\nYour job is easy at that point, you say \u201cAwesome\u2014do you mind if we add that\nquote to the product update?\u201d\n\nConversely if they just respond \u201cgreat, fixed\u201d you can ask them to elaborate\nwith a quote if they don\u2019t mind. You can provide a tshirt or some other token\nof appreciation... but that\u2019s a topic for another day. *\n\nIf you don\u2019t have that open dialog going with customers another great standin\nis providing quotes from people on your team.\n\nGenerally this is used by companies like Github, where they frequently quote\nsenior members of their development team. I think this might work with other\nroles, but for whatever reason developers tend to be regarded as being fairly\nanti sales and marketing, so promoting a quote from a developer might seem apt\nwhere a quote from the CEO may seem disingenuous.\n\nI have no data to back that up other than seeing press releases from fast food\ncompanies that feature quotes from their CMO.\n\nThe vibe is like \u201cyeah VP of Marketing of Dunkin Donuts... of course you think\nthe Salted Caramel Creamer is great and \u2018wanted to bring that same excitement\nto the at-home coffee experience\u2019\u201d.\n\nFeel free to experiment. Getting language from a real customer is the best\ncase, but even a stand-in quote from a persona might help frame the update\nfrom the perspective of a customer. An internal quote can also provide needed\ncontext and trust in the process.\n\nUltimately our goal is to show that what we\u2019re building matters to a customer\nand solves enough of a problem that they\u2019re willing to take time out of their\nday to write about it.\n\n* This is getting a bit off topic but you can even get customer quotes when something breaks. Stripe did this with me when they accidentally took too much money from me way back in 2013. They explained what happened, said sorry, and asked if I wanted a shirt! Happy ending for all.\n\n#### Being Clear\n\nThis is a similar mentality of not being public\n\nClarity is the gift we give our customer negative words at a time.\n\nBeing clear helps us, because fewer specific words are less things for us to\ntype, speeding up the process.\n\nBeing clear helps your customers because they are not interacting with our\nupdates in a sensory deprivation tank. Everyone is in their own world with\ntheir own goals, dreams, and hurdles to overcome. Being clear helps your\ncustomer quickly scan your update and move forward with their day empowered.\n\nBeing clear generally requires two things, picking a set of words to use and\nsimplifying concepts.\n\nWhile \u201cpicking a set of words to use\u201d literally describes the act of writing,\nwhat I mean here is that there should be a few key phrases which and\nunambiguous and that your customers will understand.\n\nI\u2019ll give an example from my history, my first real business was called\nTeamPassword, it\u2019s a password manager for teams. So far so good at picking a\nlimited set of words.\n\nOne of the hardest naming challenges we had was \u201cwhat do you call the things\nstored inside the password manager?\u201d I just used the obvious option, it\u2019s a\npassword manager, they\u2019re \u201cpasswords.\u201d\n\nThe hold up on that reasoning was that each record included a title, url,\nusername, password, and notes. Does it make sense to call the whole thing a\npassword when it contains a password? Would that cause confusion when they put\nin a support ticket with a password issue? And since passwords are shared on\nteams, would that cause internal confusion?\n\n\u201cI need the login info for that account, I don\u2019t have answers to the security\nquestions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I just shared the password with you\u201d\n\n\u201c... bro.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s usually tradeoffs in what words you pick, the important thing is to\npick a specific set of phrases and stick with them.\n\nA side note for the curious: We decided to use the phrase \u201clogins\u201d in\nTeamPassword to refer to that combination of fields. There were shared logins\nand private logins, and logins could be categorized by a group. This still\ncaused a lot of confusion and I wish we would have just called it the\ntechnically incorrect yet intuitive \u201cpassword!\u201d\n\nFor clarity through simplifying concepts we can rely on a few of our other\nprinciples. Including the benefit (directly below) is a fantastic way to bring\nabout clarity, not much mental energy is required when you\u2019re saying a few\nwords about how you\u2019re helping them.\n\nIncluding the benefit lets you cut a lot of the fluff, too. If you\u2019re\ncompletely focused on communicating the benefit of a feature to your customers\nyou can skip the story about how this feature came to you on a hike, how you\nstruggled to choose the right database, and how your lucky yellow socks really\nbrought this thing together.\n\nThere\u2019s a joke that I tried to find to illustrate this... it\u2019s basically\nsomeone being really long winded and providing irrelevant information to the\nlistener, and the punchline is as they go to walk away they\u2019re like \u201cOh,\nright, by the way your house is on fire.\u201d If anyone can point me in the\ndirection of what joke I\u2019m thinking of I think that\u2019ll really bring this piece\ntogether.\n\nActually, I\u2019m talking so much about including the benefit, let's just get into\nit.\n\n#### Including the Benefit\n\nI saved this one for last because basically no one does this. Taking this last\nstep to customer benefit is the secret jutsu / forbidden spell / limit break /\nultimate ability of customer updates (depending on what type of nerd you are.)\n\nWhen I say \u201cIncluding the Benefit\u201d I mean spelling out how exactly the change\nthat you made will make your customer\u2019s business better. If you\u2019re not sure\nwhere to start, the closest resource I\u2019ve made in the past is the \u201cfive\npillars of growth\u201d published through Baremetrics. This is focused on saas\nbusinesses, and the TL;DR are that the five pillars are:\n\n  1. New customer revenue\n  2. Expansion revenue\n  3. Reduce churn\n  4. Reduce downgrades\n  5. Increase reactivations\n\nThis isn\u2019t the worst place to start when thinking of the benefits you can pass\non to your customers.\n\nThrough using your product, are your customers going to get more customers?\nCan they increase expansion revenue? Are you protecting against the downside\nof churn and downgrades? Or can you help them get their customers back?\n\nThis can take a bit of creativity, which is ok!\n\nFor example, one creative interpretation is that saving a marketing team time\non a routine reporting task gives them more time to focus on marketing,\nscoring more new customers for their business.\n\nSimilarly, improving some aspect of marketing reporting may help the marketing\nteam identify which channels are converting, decreasing cost of conversion and\nacquiring customers more effectively, which either means more customers for\nthe same budget, or the same number of customers for cheaper.\n\nThere are lots of reasons customers churn, but goofs, gaffs, and f-ups is a\nsure fire way to burn customer loyalty. Any feature you deploy that prevents\ncustomer facing mistakes can be targeted at keeping customers happy.\n\nThe goal here is to \u201ctake the final step\u201d and tell your customer exactly how\nusing your product is making them more money than not using your product.\n\n(One funny note, you might also try to include the benefit and realize... the\nupdates we\u2019re making will have no impact on our customer\u2019s bottom line. That\u2019s\nnot good, and by focusing on this question perhaps we can do a bit of a better\njob with our roadmap.)\n\nRemember the different audiences reading your updates.\n\nToo many people assume the only audience for updates are the power users and\noldest, most entrenched customers. Brand new customers who have ZERO context\nread the updates. Prospects and trial customers read the updates to see if\nthis product gets improved. Anyone you\u2019ve increased pricing on will scour the\nupdates to see if it\u2019s justified.\n\nDon\u2019t make them work for it, tell them right up front how using your product\nmakes their business better.\n\nExamples are in limited supply, but this update from Transistor FM does a\ngreat job:\n\nWhy aren\u2019t all updates this clear?\n\n\u201cAdd another income stream\u201d !\n\nAka \u201cyou will make more money\u201d which is what all of our customers want to\nhear.\n\n#### Bonus tips and tricks\n\nThese are our hail marys (hail maries?), the tools we can pull out of our back\npocket when we\u2019re in a bind.\n\nOften we need to have the team \u201cgo long\u201d when we\u2019re sticking to our schedule\nbut we legitimately have nothing to talk about. Sometimes you need a\n\u201ctouchdown\u201d but haven\u2019t... done the yards? Sorry, they haven\u2019t made an NFL\nanime yet so I don\u2019t really know the rules that well.\n\nSo we\u2019re on our schedule for an update and have nothing in the hopper, what\ncan we do?\n\nOur first option is to feature some \u201cpopular updates\u201d in addition to our\nchronological updates. You can see these callouts on the customer updates\npages from both Trello and Hubspot. I think this is generally a good idea even\nif you have something to talk about, but featuring a previously popular update\non the week that you don\u2019t have anything else to say might just be a\nconvenient solution to our lack of update problem.\n\nAnother option is to do a round up over a longer timeline. Basecamp\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d\npage is a great example, showing how they highlight all the new features of\nthe latest version of their product. The \u201cnew\u201d features are all the features\nincluded in the latest version, which I\u2019m sure they must have worked on for\nmany months (or years) to build.\n\nA smaller option would be a \u201cbest of\u201d for this month, quarter, half year,\nyear... and if you burn through all of these and still have nothing to say go\nfor \u201cbest of all time.\u201d\n\nAnother option is to roll up groups of features into one post (like our\n\u201cadvanced checklists\u201d post by Trello.) One of our guiding principles is\ngetting credit for every single line of code you write, but by doing these\nfeature roll up posts this is actually like double credit, which feels like\ncheating.\n\nIf you have time to focus on making an update but no update to write about,\nanother option is to feature a customer\u2019s usage pattern or specific use case.\nThe contents will be different but the approach is the same\u2014figure out a usage\npattern in the product and highlight it sort of like it\u2019s a feature.\n\nFor example if you found out a customer is using the dashboards in your\nproduct to make important and lucrative decisions, that could be its own\nproduct update (\u201cBecome a millionaire with you dashboards.\u201d) I\u2019ve had\nsuperusers on every product that have shocked me in the way that they use the\nproduct, it\u2019s always fun to show how engaged some customers are and share\ntheir pro skills with other customers.\n\nThe same is true for a specific use case as well. For example, if you have a\ncross section of customers who own marketing agencies, thinking about the\n\u201cDriving new customer acquisition as a marketing agency\u201d update is a solid way\nto fill the space.\n\nYou could also just generally get a customer shout out. I can\u2019t take credit\nbecause this was done after I sold the business but this is an amazing video\nfor a customer of my last company TeamPassword:\n\nBeyond that... you just gotta vamp.\n\nIt\u2019s jazz baby!\n\nDo what you need to do to stick on schedule, and let this chilling time\ninspire you to get those customer updates planned in advance.\n\n## The Templates\n\nBy the way\u2014if you're overwhelmed by trying to write these frequent, churn\nreducing, upsell inducing customer updates while also running your business...\nChangebot can do this for you automatically.\n\nclick here to get started\n\nor sign up for email updates.\n\nThis guide includes a pretty wide array of tips, tricks, rules, mantras,\nschemas, and blueprints.

I have a lot to say about customer updates, and\n  2. SEO focused short term content kinda sucks.\n\nWe\u2019ve all searched for things, landed on the top result, only to realize that\nthe article just restates the question 10 times and maybe answers the\nquestion.\n\nThis drains the world of time since every reader is paying the 5 minutes of\ntime reading an article that took them like 30 minutes to write. The balance\nflips after 6 people read the article, which sucks.\n\nI realized in creating this that we severely lack \u201cmaximum effort\u201d content,\nwhere I want to drop 200+ hours reading, researching, writing, and rewriting.\nI want to deliver that in a format that a reader can skim through and have\nthem leave with a careers worth of ideas and context.\n\nHopefully you feel that way. If you don\u2019t please let me know.\n\nTo close out the key concepts of this article, here\u2019s a mega TL;DR:\n\n  1. We should get credit for every line of code we write\n  2. Companies, especially early stage tech companies, are roasted for spending all their time on product and no time on marketing. Not updating your customers is what this looks like in practice.\n  3. Most companies don\u2019t update their customers frequently enough.\n  4. Most companies are not explicit about the business benefits they\u2019ll get from using your product.\n  5. Of the companies that do publish updates, too few of them realize that it's marketing to all audiences, beyond just our current customers to prospects and leads as well.\n\nMy mission in the proceeding ~70 pages is addressing these points so you\u2019re in\nthe top 1% of customer updaters.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far I\u2019d love to hear from you, specifically on:\n\n  1. Did any part of this document stand out as particularly good?\n  2. Did any part of this document stand out as particularly bad?\n  3. What do you think is missing?\n  4. Do you have any great examples that I\u2019ve missed?\n  5. Any other feedback that springs to mind as you read the document.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis beast of a document started as a short, SEO focused article.
