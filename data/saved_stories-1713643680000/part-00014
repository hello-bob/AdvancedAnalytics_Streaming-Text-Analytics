The writing was so good that it made me look up Langewiesche and go\nthrough his bibliography. In there I found out he\u2019s written a book. It\u2019s\ncalled the The Outlaw Sea and I immediately bought it on my Kindle. On the\nvery same Kindle that three other unfinished books are waiting for me.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help it after peeking into the sample. Here\u2019s the first paragraph\non the first page:\n\n> Since we live on land, and usually beyond sight of the sea, it is easy to\n> forget that our world is an ocean world, and to ignore what in practice that\n> means. Some shores perhaps can be tamed, but beyond the horizon lies the\n> wave-maker, an anarchic expanse, the open ocean of the high seas. Under its\n> many names, and with variations in color and mood, this single ocean spreads\n> across three fourths of the globe. Geographically it is not the exception to\n> our world but by far its greatest defining feature. By social measures it is\n> important too. At a time when every last patch of land is claimed by one\n> government or another, and when citizenship is treated as an absolute\n> condition of human existence, it is a place that remains radically free.\n\nIf you were to divide humanity into mountain and sea people (right after\ndescribing everyone as either a cat or a dog person) I\u2019d very much be one of\nthe mountain folk. I don\u2019t like beaches that much, I\u2019ve never had a thought\nother than \u201cit\u2019s pretty flat, alright\u201d when staring at the sea, and every time\nI\u2019ve been on a boat I was disappointed like someone who saw their favorite\nband play live for the first time and after two hours of standing and\nexpensive drinks realized that they prefer to watch concerts from their couch\non the TV.\n\nDescribe the ocean world as an \u201canarchic expanse\u201d though and you got me\nhooked.\n\nBut here\u2019s the interesting bit, the thing that truly put the sea on my mind\nthis week: while I\u2019m reading The Outlaw Sea, The Verge publishes this piece\ncalled The Cloud Under The Sea, which starts with these two sentences:\n\n> The internet is carried around the world by hundreds of thousands of miles\n> of slender cables that sit at the bottom of the ocean. These fragile wires\n> are constantly breaking \u2013 a precarious system on which everything from banks\n> to governments to TikTok depends.\n\nHell yes. I haven\u2019t read the article yet \u2013 I\u2019m saving it for when I finished\nThe Outlaw Sea \u2013 but even if you tried you couldn\u2019t make me hit that bookmark\nbutton (actually: the \u201cemail to myself\u201d buttons) faster than with these two\nsentences.\n\nThat opening made me immediately think of the article on undersea cables: Neal\nStephenson\u2019s Mother Earth Mother Board, published in Wired magazine in 1996.\nIt now sits behind a paywall, but it seems like people want to share it anyway\n- and who\u2019s to tell them they\u2019re wrong? It\u2019s an amazing piece of writing. It\u2019s\nvery long (the senior editor who edited it back in 1996 commented on it to say\n\u201ca typical feature piece in a magazine is 5000 words, and a long one hits\n10,000 words. This was 42,000 words.\u201d) and very good.\n\nThinking about Stephenson\u2019s article, I remembered another another fantastic\nWired article, that\u2019s also about technology and the sea: High Tech Cowboys of\nthe Deep Seas: The Race to Save the Cougar Ace. Also behind a paywall, but it\nseems like they still have it available under a different name. I just said\n\u201cremember\u201d as if I hadn\u2019t thought of the following two paragraph every few\nmonths for years now:\n\n> Jolted awake in Wyoming, Habib pushes himself out of bed. His dogs cluster\n> around him. Clearly they want to go along, but he\u2019ll need a little more help\n> than they can give. It\u2019s time to mobilise the Titan A-Team.\n>\n> In Seattle, it\u2019s warm and breezy as Marty Johnson zips through the traffic\n> in his black BMW Z3 convertible. He\u2019s wearing shades and, although he just\n> turned 40, he has a boyish look that suits the car. Since graduating first\n> in his class from New York\u2019s Webb Institute, a pre-eminent undergraduate\n> naval architecture school, he has travelled the world with his laptop,\n> building 3D models and helping refloat sunken things. He oversaw a system to\n> lift a submerged F-14 from 70 metres of water near San Diego in 2004.\n\nWhile I\u2019m following the associations in my head - the sea, undersea cables,\nmother board, cowboys of the deep - someone recommends another Langewiesche\narticle to me: What Really Happened to Malaysia\u2019s Missing Airplane, an article\nabout flight MH370, the one that \u201cvanished into the Indian Ocean.\u201d\n\nAgain: the sea. Again: technology versus the sea.\n\nThat\u2019s what Langewiesche\u2019s book and these articles point at and what will\nforever fascinate me - that\u2019s why the sea\u2019s been on my mind this whole week.\n\nWe might feel as if we\u2019re living in a digital world - detached from the\nphysical one once we\u2019re inside our houses, living more or less in an ether\ncalled the internet - but that feeling only holds as long as the physical\nworld plays along. When it doesn\u2019t, our world glitches - things that seem\nimpossible, that can\u2019t happen, happen.\n\nHere\u2019s Langewiesche on MH370 and the absurdity of a plane simply disappearing\nin a world that can be examined, step by step, on Google Maps:\n\n> The idea that a sophisticated machine, with its modern instruments and\n> redundant communications, could simply vanish seems beyond the realm of\n> possibility. It is hard to permanently delete an email, and living off the\n> grid is nearly unachievable even when the attempt is deliberate. A Boeing\n> 777 is meant to be electronically accessible at all times.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nWith that: happy reading!\n\nIf you, too, like glitches, subscribe here:\n\n1 Like\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Glitching on the Sea\n\nregisterspill.thorstenball.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nTwo types of software engineers\n\nOne assumes it's easy because it's a non-technical problem, the other assumes\nthat's why it's hard\n\nApr 9, 2023 \u2022\n\nThorsten Ball\n\n51\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Two types of software engineers\n\nregisterspill.thorstenball.com\n\n14\n\nFrom 1s to 4ms\n\nSo zero-cost abstractions exist?\n\nFeb 17 \u2022\n\nThorsten Ball\n\n27\n\nShare this post\n\n#### From 1s to 4ms\n\nregisterspill.thorstenball.com\n\n8\n\nA Few Words on Testing\n\nOr: Losing Faith\n\nMar 16 \u2022\n\nThorsten Ball\n\n38\n\nShare this post\n\n#### A Few Words on Testing\n\nregisterspill.thorstenball.com\n\n6\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Thorsten Ball\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
