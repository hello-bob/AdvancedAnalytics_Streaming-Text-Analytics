However, any compiler framework we apply must be\n> prepared to handle the wide range of EDA tasks, including not only\n> compilation tasks like technology mapping and optimization (the \"there\"} in\n> our title), but also decompilation tasks like loop rerolling (the \"back\n> again\"). In this paper, we advocate for equality saturation -- a term\n> rewriting framework -- as the framework of choice when building hardware\n> toolchains. Through a series of case studies, we show how the needs of EDA\n> tasks line up conspicuously well with the features equality saturation\n> provides.\n\nSubjects:| Hardware Architecture (cs.AR); Programming Languages (cs.PL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.00786 [cs.AR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.00786v1 [cs.AR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.00786arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Gus Henry Smith [view email] [v1] Sun, 31 Mar 2024 20:20:48 UTC (1,083\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled There and Back Again: A Netlist's Tale with\nMuch Egraphin', by Gus Henry Smith and 8 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.PL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
