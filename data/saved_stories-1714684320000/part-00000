States:\nAR, IL, IN, KY, LA, MO, MS, TN  \n  \n## When will they emerge?\n\nGenerally speaking, these cicadas will begin to emerge when the soil 8\u2032\u2032\nbeneath the ground reaches 64 degrees Fahrenheit (Heath, 1968). A nice, warm\nrain will often trigger an emergence. They typically emerge in May but have\nbeen known to emerge in late April or early June. It all depends on the\nweather.\n\n## What should you look for before they emerge?\n\n### Chimneys / Turrets\n\nLook for cicada chimneys a.k.a. turrets. These are structures cicadas build\nout of the soil, positioned above the hole where they will emerge.\n\n### Holes\n\nLook for holes in the diameter of an adult\u2019s finger near the root system of a\ntree. These are sure signs that cicadas will emerge in the area.\n\n### Cicadas Under Stones & Slates\n\nYou might discover some cicada nymphs while turning over stones or when\nperforming landscaping chores.\n\n## What do they look like when they emerge:\n\nHere is a great video of Magicicada nymphs once they have emerged from the\nground:\n\nThis is a recently emerged nymph crawling up a tree. Note that its eyes are\nred.\n\nOnce cicadas nymphs have emerged from the ground, they will try to find a tree\n(or similar vertical surface), and then begin the process of shedding their\nold nymph skins (ecdysis), expanding their wings, and changing to their adult\ncoloring. Watch this amazing transformation.\n\n## How to tell the difference between the seven Magicicada species:\n\nLeft to right: Magicicada cassini, Magicicada septendecula, Magicicada\nseptendecim:\n\nThe first way is based on the Brood. Take a look at the Brood chart above, and\nsee which species appear with the Brood.\n\nThere are 3 basic types of Magicicada: \u201c\u2018Decims\u201d, \u201c\u2018Cassini\u201d and \u201c\u2018Deculas\u201d.\n\n### \u201cDecims\u201d aka Pharaoh Cicadas\n\nThere are three species in this category:\n\n  1. Magicicada septendecim (Linnaeus, 1758). 17-year life cycle. Broods: I-X, XIII, XIV.\n  2. Magicicada neotredecim Marshall and Cooley 2000. 13-year life cycle. Broods: XIX, XXIII.\n  3. Magicicada tredecim (Walsh and Riley, 1868). 13-year life cycle. Brood: XIX, XXII, XXIII.\n\nTheir songs are very similar, however, when M. neotredecim & M. tredecim\nemerge in the same location, M. neotredecim\u2019s song takes a higher pitch.\nSounds like \u201cPharaoh, Pharaoh!\u201d.\n\nAudio Player\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\n#### Visual Appearance:\n\nMale on left; Female on right.\n\nM. neotredecim & M. septendecim have broad orange stripes with more orange\nthan black on their abdomens.\n\nM. tredecim, by comparison, have almost entirely orange abdomens.\n\nM. septendecim cicadas also have an area of orange coloring between the eye\nand the wing (pronotal extension).\n\n### \u201cCassini\u201d aka Dwarf Cicadas\n\nThere are two species in this category:\n\n  1. Magicicada cassini (Fisher, 1851). 17-year life cycle. Broods: I-V, VIII-X, XIII, XIV.\n  2. Magicicada tredecassini Alexander and Moore, 1962. 13-year life cycle. Broods: XIX, XXII, XXII.\n\nTheir songs are essentially identical:\n\n#### M. cassini Call and Court:\n\nAudio Player\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\nNote how it makes a quick burst of sound, followed by some rapid clicks.\n\n#### Visual Appearance:\n\nFemale on left; Male on right. M. tredecassin & M. cassini cicadas have black\nabdomens with virtually no orange at all. Orange stripes are possible in the\nmid-west (important to note for Brood IV).\n\n### \u201cDecula\u201d\n\nThere are two species in this category:\n\n  1. Magicicada septendecula Alexander and Moore, 1962. 17-year life cycle. Broods: I-VI, VIII-X, XIII, XIV.\n  2. Magicicada tredecula Alexander and Moore, 1962. 13-year life cycle. Broods: XIX, XXII, XXIII.\n\nTheir songs are essentially identical:\n\n#### M. tredecula Call:\n\nAudio Player\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\nNote the \u201ctick, tick, tick\u201d rhythm of the call.\n\n#### Visual Appearance:\n\nFemale on left; Male on right. M. septendecula & M. tredecula have stripes\nthat feature more black than orange. Otherwise, they\u2019re very similar to M.\ncassini.\n\n## How to figure out if they\u2019re coming to your town?\n\n  1. Verify that they\u2019re coming to your state. Check the Magicicada Brood Chart on this page.\n  2. Check Cicada Brood Maps linked from this page to see if they\u2019re coming to your general area.\n  3. Check to see if they\u2019re coming to your neighborhood. Good sources include:\n\n    1. Check the Cicada Central Magicicada Database to see the counties where cicadas have appeared in the past.\n    2. Ask someone who lived there 17 (or 13) years before.\n    3. Old timers (hint: old timers usually call them locusts).\n    4. Check your local Library for old newspaper articles.\n    5. Check with a local college: contact the entomology, forestry, or agriculture-related departments.\n    6. Your local national, state, county, and town parks department (parks and rec). Some county parks departments plan events around cicada emergences.\n  4. When will they emerge?\n\n    1. They will emerge sometime in the Spring, for sure.\n    2. They typically emerge once the soil 8 inches (20 cm) below the surface gets to 64 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celcius). At that temperature, they will start digging their tunnels to the surface. After a couple of days with above-ground temperatures near the 80\u2019s F, and after a good rain, they will emerge. Read this paper for more info: Thermal Synchronization of Emergence in Periodical \u201c17-year\u201d Cicadas (Homoptera, Cicadidae, Magicicada) by James Edward Heath, American Midland Naturalist, Vol. 80, No. 2. (Oct. 1968), pp. 440-448.\n    3. Cicadas in sunny areas of your yard will emerge before cicadas in shady areas.\n    4. Cicadas in the southernmost states will emerge before cicadas in the northern states.\n    5. You can try the Cicada Emergence Formula as well.\n  5. If you don\u2019t want them to damage your young or ornamental trees\n\n    1. Spray them off with a garden hose.\n    2. Foil around the trunk (to keep them from crawling up) (thanks Deborah).\n    3. Insect barrier tape.\n    4. Netting placed around & over the tree. \u201cInsect barrier netting\u201d. \u201cFruit tree covers\u201d.\n    5. Bagpipes (no joke, it worked at my friend\u2019s wedding).\n    6. Don\u2019t use pesticides \u2013 we like all insects (especially pollinating bees).\n  6. Are you scared of insects?\n\n     * Unlike some other insects & arthropods. cicadas are not poisonous or venomous.\n     * Try a hat, an umbrella, a bee-keepers outfit, a suit of armor...\n  7. They\u2019re coming, and they\u2019re going to ruin my wedding!\n\n     * Try our Cicada Wedding Planner\n\n## Questions about the Brood Chart\n\nQuestion: Why do I have cicadas in my neighborhood, but your chart indicates\nthat I shouldn\u2019t?\n\nAnswer: Some possibilities: 1) they are stragglers, periodical cicadas that\nemerge too soon or late, 2) they are not periodical cicadas, but are a\ndifferent North American species, 3) you live on a continent other than North\nAmerica, in which case, try one of these pages, or 4) SURPRISE! The U.S. is a\nbig place and some cicada populations have yet to be documented.\n\nQuestion: Why don\u2019t I have periodical cicadas in my area, but the information\non your website indicates that I should?\n\nAnswer: Two possibilities: 1) they went extinct or otherwise died off in your\narea, or 2) they aren\u2019t everywhere in a state \u2013 normally there are large gaps\nin their range.\n\nQuestion: What are stragglers?\n\nAnswer: Stragglers can emerge 1 or 4 years early or 1 or 4 years late. Don\u2019t\nbe surprised if you see some periodical cicadas emerge earlier than planned\nthis year. 17-year brood members are most likely to straggle 4 years early,\nand 13-year brood members are most likely to straggle 4 years late. Straggler\nprobability chart.\n\nQuestion: Why are there no Brood XI, XII, XV, XVI... ?\n\nAnswer: Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed there are no Broods XI (11), XII (12), XV (15),\nXVI (16), XVII (17), XVIII (18), XX (20), XXI (21), XXIV (24), etc. Don\u2019t\nworry about that. They never existed or are extinct (XI, XXI).\n\n## Example Emergence Timeline\n\nThis is an example of a typical cicada emergence. The exact dates will depend\non the weather and density of the emergence in your location. Hot weather\nmeans an early start and quicker finish to the season \u2014 cool weather means a\nlater start, and a protracted season.\n\nHere\u2019s an Excel version of the chart. Feel free to use it and adjust it to\nmatch your experience.\n\nOr watch the video version:\n\n## More Magicicada websites:\n\n  1.

Was talking to a friend about species emergence; she\nforwarded this article: https://insights.osu.edu/science/17-year-cicadas\nGranted, 3 individuals total of two species is a rather meager sample size for\nBrood X, but I have not seen anything elsewhere in my references or on line\nabout the emergence of each species peaking at different times during the\nwhole emergence timespan. Do you have any other sources or websites you can\ndirect me to about this? Thanks!\n\nReply\n\n    1. Dan says:\n\nMay 23, 2021 at 8:45 am\n\nAnecdotally, the smaller species emerge after M. septendecim, but they reach\ntheir crescendo at the same time and are gone by the same time. All three\ncicadas prefer different slightly different habitats. The M. septendecim is\nmore of a generalist and will occupy any level of the canopy. M. cassini, I\u2019ve\nheard, prefer wet areas, but I\u2019ve also seen them dominate suburban\nneighborhoods. They seem to prefer higher elevations. M. septendecula are\nparticularly hard to find \u2014 when I do find them, they seem to occupy ravines,\nsmall and small shady areas of less than an acre.\n\nReply\n\n  10.

There are cicadas in\nCanada, but they have different lifecycles.\n\nReply\n\n  15. Kenneth Carl says:\n\nApril 15, 2021 at 9:18 am\n\nI started seeing the 17-year cicadas emerging from the ground. Lots of wholes\na few cicadas.\n\nReply\n\n  16. Doug Wechsler says:\n\nApril 7, 2021 at 12:32 pm\n\nHow many eggs does Magicicada casinii lay in one slit into the twig? They seem\nto be in pairs. I believe it lays one side then the parallet set.\n\nReply\n\n  17. D. Jones says:\n\nApril 3, 2021 at 12:12 pm\n\nWas there a cicada emergence in the coastal desert area of California during\nthe summer of 2020? A friend said they were unable to sleep due to the noise\nlevel. Thank you.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Dan says:\n\nApril 3, 2021 at 3:09 pm\n\nCalifornia \u2014 there might have been. The species in California don\u2019t emerge in\na predictable cycle, like these 17-year cicadas, but many do have \u201cproto\nperiodical\u201d peak years based on weather events \u2014 like a year with a lot of\nrain \u2014 or maybe other factors like overcrowding. Here is a list of cicadas in\nCalifornia.\n\nReply\n\n  18. Chris Swenson says:\n\nMarch 25, 2021 at 10:10 am\n\nI saw a cicada in Vienna, Virginia this morning, at least I think it is a\ncicada.

This\nmorning I looked for any carcasses and found one and a dead one. I can send\npictures if anyone is interested. Are they mapped to be this Far East ?\n\nReply\n\n    1.

If the last\nperiodic brood was 2014 what brood are these?\n\nReply\n\n    1. Dan says:\n\nAugust 24, 2020 at 6:45 pm\n\nAt this time of year, it\u2019s just annual (not periodical) cicadas. Here\u2019s the\nIowa list. Probably a Megatibicen or Neotibicen.\n\nReply\n\n  21.

I live in northern NJ and it seems to me like we ALWAYS have\ncicadas\u2013every year. I love that sound on a hot summer morning. My son asked me\nwhy we haven\u2019t heard any yet this year and I don\u2019t have an answer. I could\nhave SWORN I heard them this past Saturday morning, and got all happy again.\nBut then\u2013nothing since. What is going on?

It\u2019s around 67 degrees and supposed to drop into the upper\n50\u2019s tonight. Will the cooler temperatures have a negative impact on the\ncicada activity? Not to mention yesterday\u2019s high winds associated with\nTropical Depression Cristobal, which took down a lot of smaller branches and\ntwigs throughout the area.

Tracy Mulhausen says:\n\nJune 8, 2020 at 11:07 am\n\nI live in Chicago\u2019s southwest suburb of Orland Park. We must have the Brood\nXIII stragglers here too. I initially saw nymphs climbing walls of my house on\nWednesday,June 3rd. By the weekend, my shrubs, trees, wood retaining walls and\ncedar siding were strewn with hundreds of not thousands of nymph shells.\nToday, it\u2019s simply a massive chorus when you sit outside.\n\nReply\n\n  36. howard diehl says:\n\nJune 8, 2020 at 9:20 am\n\nI live in the west suburbs of Chicago, and for the past week we have had a\ngrowing symphony of cicada calls.

If they\u2019re \u201cstragglers\u201d of brood 13 there sure is a lot of them.\nAlmost as big as full emergence. Could a different brood have expanded or\nmoved its territory?\n\nReply\n\n    1. Dan says:\n\nJune 6, 2020 at 12:37 pm\n\n@tim, its Brood XIII, but it may be \u201caccelerating\u201d to establish a new brood,\nor at least demonstrating the biological mechanisms that allow a brood to form\nanother brood.\n\nIn the eastern states we have a series of broods \u2014 XIV (14), X (10), VI (6),\nand II (2) \u2014 that are believed to have have derived from on another.\n\nReply\n\n    2. howard diehl says:\n\nJune 8, 2020 at 9:22 am\n\nI live in Wheaton, and have had the same experience.
