The flagship GNOME edition\nshowcases GNOME 46, the beta of which we covered back in February and which\nwill also appear in Ubuntu 24.04 mere days later. That's no coincidence. At\nfirst, both distributions were based on the GNOME desktop and their release\ncycles were intended to synchronize with GNOME's semi-annual releases. The\nGNOME edition replaces the trusty Cheese webcam app with the new Snapshot app\nthat appeared with GNOME 45.\n\nThe most significant changes are found in the KDE edition among the desktop\nversions. Fedora doesn't have long-term support releases, which is one reason\nit's able to include newer components. As such, unlike Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 40\nwill have the shiny new KDE Plasma 6 desktop \u2013 specifically, version 6.0.3,\nand with only a Wayland session available by default. (Indeed, there's a\nproposal open to switch the Workstation edition to KDE, although we doubt it\nwill happen.)\n\nThe Fedora Project has recycled primary sponsor Red Hat's old Atomic brand\n(which the company sunset after acquiring CoreOS), and will use it to group\nits growing collection of immutable desktop distributions: Silverblue (with\nGNOME), Kinoite (with KDE Plasma), Sericea (with Sway), and Onyx (with\nBudgie).\n\nFedora aims to be the best distro for software developers, and Red Hat's\nannouncement of the beta highlighted some of the tools for machine learning\nand large language model development that it will include, including the\nPython-based PyTorch and version 6 of AMD's ROCm framework complete with\nsupport for AMD's latest MI300 accelerators.\n\nCompared to the rise of LLMs, containers are positively old hat now, but\nFedora IoT is revamping its tooling around bootable containers, which are\nbuilt using ostree and updated using bootc.\n\n  * Lightweight LXQt 2.0.0 updates to same toolkit as KDE Plasma 6\n  * Qt Ubuntu 24.04 betas show that there's room to innovate\n  * Debian spices up APT package manager with a dash of color, squishes ancient bug\n  * AlmaLinux 9.4 beta prepares to tread where RHEL dares not\n\nDevelopers get fresh versions of the heavyweight tool suites, including LLVM\n18 and GCC 14, along with which come binutils 2.41, glibc 2.39, and gdb 14.1.\nOther updates include Ruby 3.3, GoLang 1.22, PHP 8.3, PostgreSQL 16, Podman 5,\nand OpenJDK 21. Under the hood, it uses RFC 5227 Address Conflict Detection\nfor handling IPv4 address conflicts, and the Wget downloader has been upgraded\nto Wget 2. Version 5 of the DNF package manager, which was held back from\nFedora 38 early last year, still didn't make it in two releases later, but\nit's being evaluated in some subsidiary roles. However, there have been\nseveral simplifications to the way DNF downloads files and metadata. For a\ndetailed list of all the components and versions, there is a full changeset.\n\nThe KDE edition has the newest shiny to show off, with Plasma 6.0.3 and\nnothing but a Wayland session \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nWe gave very quick test drives to both the GNOME and KDE editions in virtual\nmachines. Our advice for Fedora 39 still holds \u2013 don't try to run Fedora in\nVirtualBox. Even using the latest version 7.0.16, we experienced so many\nproblems it was unusable. Using the UTM hypervisor, though, which uses QEMU\nunder the hood, both versions ran much more smoothly, just without sound. The\nGNOME edition feels very responsive, and the new global search function in the\nFiles app is handy. The search is not truly global \u2013 while it instantly found\nthings in our home directory, it doesn't seem to search the parts of the file\nsystem where the OS lives \u2013 but it's a useful addition. We had to disable 3D\nacceleration to install the KDE version, but once installed we saw no problems\nafter re-enabling it.\n\nThese are not lightweight OSes, though. Immediately after startup, KDE 6 used\n1.5 GB of RAM, and 4.1 GB of disk. The GNOME Workstation used 1.3 GB of RAM\nand 3.5 GB of disk. This is an OS for modern hardware, and while it should\nperform well, it will want plenty of fast storage and a recent model of GPU,\nsupported by the latest drivers, to do it.\n\nCompared to some previous releases, the changes in Fedora 40 are not massively\ndisruptive. Linux is in its mid-30s \u2013 after all, it predates Windows 3.1, and\nOS/2 2.0, and the first release of Windows NT. Its wild anarchic youth is a\nfading memory. As a software stack, it's not only mature, it's showing\ndistinct signs of middle-aged spread. This means fewer dramatic changes, but\nit also signals that it's moving away from its former territory as a low-end\nOS for older hardware. \u00ae\n\n### Bootnote\n\nThis aging vulture has to perform a web search to check which name denotes\nwhich desktop in each Fedora immutable edition, every single time. The same\napplies to the openSUSE project's immutable distros, which were, the last time\nhe checked, openSUSE Aeon for the GNOME edition, openSUSE Kalpa for the KDE\nedition, and openSUSE Baldur for the Xfce edition.\n\nIf anyone has a hypothesis to explain why distro vendors are so fond of giving\ntheir immutable distributions whimsical names, please send in your ideas on a\npostcard comment below.\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Fedora\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Fedora\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Red Hat\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Firmware\n  * FOSDEM\n  * GNOME\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * macOS\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OpenShift\n  * OS/2\n  * Qubes\n  * RHEL\n  * Ubuntu\n  * UEFI\n  * Unix\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Linus Torvalds\n\n#### More about\n\n4 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Fedora\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Fedora\n  * Linux\n  * Open Source\n  * Operating System\n  * Red Hat\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Android\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * Audacity\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Elementary OS\n  * Firmware\n  * FOSDEM\n  * GNOME\n  * iOS\n  * Jenkins\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * macOS\n  * MySQL\n  * One Way Forward\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OpenShift\n  * OS/2\n  * Qubes\n  * RHEL\n  * Ubuntu\n  * UEFI\n  * Unix\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Linus Torvalds\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### AlmaLinux 9.4 beta prepares to tread where RHEL dares not\n\nCIQ also has an alternative approach to compatible kernels with RockyLinux\n\nOSes6 days | 6\n\n#### NetBSD 10 proves old tech can still kick apps and take names three\ndecades later\n\nFOSDEM 2024 Proper old-school Unix, not like those lazy, decadent Linux types\n\nOSes6 days | 39\n\n#### Linux Foundation is leading fight against fauxpen source\n\nOpinion Shifts its transmission from vendor neutral into open source gear\n\nApplications11 days | 37\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Lightweight LXQt 2.0.0 updates to same toolkit as KDE Plasma 6\n\n4-letter survivor's move to Qt 6 means that, love it or hate it, Wayland is\nlooming\n\nOSes3 days | 17\n\n#### Debian spices up APT package manager with a dash of color, squishes\nancient bug\n\n2.9 gives a taste of what's to come\n\nOSes5 days | 34\n\n#### Torvalds intentionally complicates his use of indentation in Linux\nKconfig\n\nParamount penguin forces more robust whitespace handling\n\nOSes7 days | 90\n\n#### Qt Ubuntu 24.04 betas show that there's room to innovate\n\nHot on the heels of Ubuntu Noble beta come the betas of the Qt-based remixes,\nwith some interesting differences\n\nOSes4 days | 39\n\n#### OpenBSD 7.5 locks down with improved disk encryption support and syscall\nlimitations\n\nThe most secure Unix-like OS to date?\n\nOSes11 days | 49\n\n#### German state ditches Windows, Microsoft Office for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n'Complete digital sovereignty' ... sounds familiar\n\nSoftware19 days | 189\n\n#### Open sourcerers say suspected xz-style attacks continue to target\nmaintainers\n\nSocial engineering patterns spotted across range of popular projects\n\nSecurity7 days | 29\n\n#### VMS Software prunes OpenVMS hobbyist program\n\nVintage OS editions go the way of the dodo as VSI cranks up exclusivity\n\nApplications14 days | 54\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
