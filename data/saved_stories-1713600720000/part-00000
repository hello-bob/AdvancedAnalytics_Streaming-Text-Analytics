Well, here's a first shot at it. It's not pretty, but rtf2html will convert MS Word documents using a specific style sheet into HTML. The source code is available for anon FTP from: oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu in /public/unix/WWW/rtf2html.tar\n\n## Here's the READ ME:\n\n    \n    \n    This is the first cut at a RTF to HTML converter. It has several limitations that users should be aware of. First, unless you want to make some changes to tables within the source, you need to use the style sheet that is defined in Sample.rtf to format your Word documents. It's easiest to just start with Sample.rtf as your basic document and cut out what you don't need. rtf2html is dependent on the style numbers in the style sheet matching those in the conversion table in the code. This is an UGLY hack, but I really didn't want to parse the style sheet. Hey, it's free. To build the code, type \"make\". This code should build on anything with a C compiler. It was written on a Mac using Think C and moved to Unix with no changes.
