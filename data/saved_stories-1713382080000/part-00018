Much like taking a religious vow of poverty, scientists gain the\nbenefit of a higher calling, along with the public perception of piety, for\nthe tradeoff of low pay (at least, lower than what you could get in\nindustry\u2014successful scientists are usually financially comfortable). They are,\nat least supposedly, devoted to Truth with a capital-T. Which is why most\npeople still highly approve of scientists, despite modern science being in\npractice a bundle of contradictions, living stuffed as it does within higher\neducation institutions that are increasingly unpopular (public confidence in\nhigher-ed has fallen rapidly, declining by 20% in the last eight years).\n\nOccasionally I\u2019ll get asked how one becomes a scientist, for I\u2019ve been a\nworking scientist.

But before\nthat I was named as one of the Forbes 30 Under 30 in science (to my chagrin),\nand have held positions or associations with a myriad of institutions, across\ndifferent roles and across different research styles, from the hectically-busy\nColumbia University to the calmative (one might even say soporific) Institute\nfor Advanced Study at Princeton.\n\nSo how does one do it? What follows is a guide, written not just for\nprospective scientists. It\u2019s also an inside peak at a process and career path\nhidden in shadow. Science is still, in many ways, a medieval institution (to\nits credit, as I\u2019ll explain). Just as the inner workings of the Catholic\nChurch are disguised, science has its own analogous secular cloisterism. Taken\nto be just another member of the modern world, a common misconception is that\nthe path to becoming a scientist is via GPA or test scores or academic\nperformance. This is not true. Science is a guild. And to become a guild\nmember, it\u2019s critical to start with...\n\n## This post is for paid subscribers\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
